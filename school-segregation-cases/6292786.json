INTRODUCTION\n\n       This complex products-liability action arises out of a tragic event in the life of\n\nCaroline Kubicki, a Type-I diabetic who began using a mechanical pump and an\n\nassociated infusion set to administer the insulin necessary to manage her diabetes when\n\nshe was 12 years old. Caroline was 19 and a sophomore at George Washington\n\nUniversity (“GW”) in early September of 2007, when she experienced severe\n\nhypoglycemia in her dormitory room and suffered a traumatic brain injury as a result of\n\nthe low blood sugar levels. Caroline currently resides in a group home in a persistent\n\nvegetative state, and her parents, John and Karen Kubicki (“Plaintiffs” or “the\n\nKubickis”), have filed the instant lawsuit against the company that designed and\n\nmanufactured the insulin pump and a component of the associated infusion set that\n\nCaroline was using at the time of the incident—Medtronic, Inc.—along with certain of\n\nits subsidiaries, Medtronic Diabetes and Medtronic MiniMed, Inc. (collectively,\n\n“Medtronic”). The Kubickis have also sued Unomedical Devices SA de CV, the\n\nmanufacturer and assembler of the infusion set, and one of that company’s affiliates,\n\nUnomedical A/S (collectively, “Unomedical”).\n\n       The Kubickis’ amended complaint contains 25 state law claims that concern two\n\nmedical devices: the Medtronic MiniMed Paradigm® Insulin Pump Model MMT-522\n\n(“the MMT-522 Pump”) and the Medtronic MiniMed Paradigm® Quick-set Infusion\n\nSet, Model MMT-396 (“the MMT-396 Infusion Set”). (See Second Am. Compl. (“2nd\n\nAm. Compl.”), ECF No. 124, ¶¶ 6, 20.) The complaint’s myriad claims can generally\n\nbe grouped into five categories. The first five counts (hereinafter referred to as “the\n\fnegligence claims”) generally allege that the defendants committed common law\n\nnegligence with respect to the design and manufacturing of both the MMT-522 Pump\n\nand the MMT-396 Infusion Set, and that defendants breached both the duty to provide\n\nadequate consumer instructions, labels, and warnings with respect to these devices, and\n\nthe duty to take “reasonable care in documenting, logging, investigating, and reporting\n\nto the FDA” public complaints about these devices. (Id. ¶ 91; see id. ¶¶ 88–117\n\n(Counts I–V).) Counts VI through X cast similar allegations as common law “strict\n\nliability” claims (see, e.g., id. ¶ 149 (contending that defendants “sold the [insulin-\n\ndelivery devices] to Ms. Kubicki in a defective condition what was unreasonably\n\ndangerous to consumers”); see also id. ¶¶ 118–152 (Counts VI–X)), while Counts XI\n\nthrough XV (hereinafter the “express warranty claims”) assert that each defendant\n\nbreached an express warranty upon which Caroline, her parents, and her physicians\n\nrelied (see id. ¶¶ 153–203). The final two groups of claims in the complaint (the\n\n“failure to warn” claims) allege that the defendants failed to warn users and the FDA\n\n“of the foreseeable harm associated with the use” of the insulin-delivery devices (id.\n\n¶ 205; see id. ¶¶ 204–253 (Counts XVI–XX)), and that the Kubickis are entitled to\n\n“punitive damages” because each defendant company “acted maliciously, willfully,\n\nwantonly, and recklessly without regard to the safety of others” (id. ¶ 262; see id.\n\n¶¶ 254–263 (Counts XXI–XXV)). To date, the parties have completed fact discovery—\n\nbut not expert discovery—in this matter, and Plaintiffs have pared down the charges\n\nagainst Unomedical, such that the only claims remaining against the Unomedical\n\ndefendants are the failure to warn claims that appear in the complaint both as separate\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\fclaims and as part of the negligence and strict liability theories. (See Mot. Hr’g Tr.,\n\nECF No. 152, at 5:5–6:1 (Nov. 3, 2016).)\n\n        Before this Court at present are two motions for summary judgment that\n\nMedtronic and Unomedical have filed. (See Medtronic Mot. for Summ. J. or, in the\n\nAlternative, for Partial Summ. J. (“Medtronic’s MSJ”), ECF No. 133; Unomedical Mot.\n\nfor Summ. J. (“Unomedical’s MSJ”), ECF No. 134.) 1 Plaintiffs oppose these motions,\n\nbut have not cross-moved for summary judgment. (See Pls.’ Opp’n to Defs.’ Mots. for\n\nSumm. J. (“Pls.’ Opp’n”), ECF No. 141.) Medtronic first argues that Plaintiffs cannot\n\nestablish the requisite causation because, among other things, the existing record\n\nevidence definitively establishes that Caroline was not wearing her insulin pump at the\n\ntime of the hypoglycemic incident. 2 In addition, Medtronic also maintains that the\n\nKubickis’ common law tort and express warranty claims are entirely preempted and/or\n\nbarred by the applicable statutes of limitations (see Mem. in Support of Medtronic’s\n\nMot. for Summ. J. or, in the alternative, for Partial Summ. J. (“Medtronic’s Mem.”),\n\nECF No. 133-1, at 31–62), and Medtronic further contends that, because the record\n\ncontains no evidence of intentional wrongdoing, it is entitled to summary judgment on\n\nthe punitive damages counts (id. at 63–70). Unomedical’s motion for summary\n\njudgment argues that the failure to warn claims it faces are untimely and impliedly\n\n\n\n\n1\n Page numbers cited herein, except for transcript and deposition citations, refer to those that the\nCourt’s electronic case-filing system automatically assigns.\n2\n  Medtronic’s motion for summary judgment references an expert declaration from Helena W. Rodbard,\nM.D., FACP, MACE, which sets forth Dr. Rodbard’s expert opinion regarding various other potential\ncauses of Caroline Kubicki’s injuries. (See Decl. of Helena W. Rodbard (“Rodbard Decl.”), ECF No.\n133-6.) Because the parties have yet to engage in expert discovery, this Court previously granted\nPlaintiffs’ motion to strike the portions of this declaration (and related briefing) that suggest possible\nalternative causes of Caroline’s hypoglycemic event. (See Min. Order of Apr. 8, 2016.)\n\n\n\n                                                    3\n\fpreempted, and it also presses the same causation and punitive damages arguments that\n\nMedtronic makes. (See Mem. in Support of Unomedical’s Mot. for Summ. J.\n\n(“Unomedical’s Mem.”), ECF No. 134-1, at 25–34, 37–47.)\n\n       This Court has carefully parsed the defendants’ myriad summary judgment\n\narguments regarding causation, timeliness, preemption, and other issues, along with the\n\nprior written ruling of the Court that resolved the Medtronic defendants’ initial motion\n\nto dismiss. See Kubicki v. Medtronic, No. 12cv0734, 2013 WL 1739580 (D.D.C. Mar.\n\n21, 2013). As explained fully below, this Court now concludes that Medtronic’s\n\nMotion for Summary Judgment must be GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN\n\nPART, and that Unomedical’s Motion for Summary Judgment must be GRANTED in\n\nfull. In sum, this Court has determined that neither defendant is entitled to summary\n\njudgment on causation grounds at this point in the litigation (prior to expert discovery),\n\nbut that summary judgment can and will be entered in Unomedical’s favor on the basis\n\nof the statute of limitations. The Court will also grant summary judgment to Medtronic\n\nwith respect to certain claims in the complaint—i.e., all claims that pertain to the\n\nMMT-522 Pump (with the exception of Plaintiffs’ manufacturing defect claim) and the\n\nfailure to report claims that relate to the MMT-396 Infusion Set—because federal law\n\neither expressly or impliedly preempts such claims. In addition, the Court will grant\n\nMedtronic’s motion for summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ breach of warranty claim\n\nbecause the statements on which Plaintiffs predicate their claim do not create an\n\nactionable warranty. The Court will also grant Medtronic’s motion for summary\n\njudgment with respect to Plaintiffs’ stand-alone claim for punitive damages, because\n\nD.C. law does not recognize such a claim, but the Court finds that any ruling on the\n\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\favailability of punitive damages as a remedy is premature prior to the completion of\n\nexpert discovery. This Court sees no other basis for granting summary judgment in\n\nMedtronic’s favor with respect to the remaining infusion set claims (negligent design,\n\nmanufacture, and labeling, and failure to warn) at this time. However, Medtronic can\n\nseek summary judgment on causation grounds upon the parties’ completion of expert\n\ndiscovery.\n\n        A separate Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion will follow.\n\n\nII.     FACTS RELATED TO CAROLINE AND HER INJURIES\n\n        A.      The Hypoglycemic Event\n\n        Caroline was diagnosed with Type I diabetes at the age of six, and was first\n\nprescribed an insulin pump in March of 2001, at age 12, after she had experienced\n\ndifficulty controlling her blood glucose levels with self-administered insulin shots.\n\n(See Medtronic’s Stmt. of Undisputed Material Facts (“Medtronic’s Stmt. of Facts”),\n\nECF No. 133-2, ¶¶ 13–14, 17; see also Pls.’ Stmt. of Genuine Issues of Material Fact\n\n(“Pls.’ Stmt. of Facts”), ECF No. 138-70, ¶¶ 8–9) (noting that Caroline had experienced\n\nthree hypoglycemic events prior to receiving a prescription for the insulin pump in\n\n2001).) 3 In October of 2006, Caroline’s physician, Dr. Paresh Dandona, prescribed\n\nCaroline the MMT-522 Pump and the MMT-396 Infusion Set that are at issue in this\n\ncase. (See Dep. of John Kubicki (“J. Kubicki Dep.”), Ex. E to Decl. of Michael K.\n\nBrown (“Brown Decl.”), ECF No. 133-5 at 67–92, at 114:6–14.) Nearly one year\n\n\n3\n  The pancreas of an individual with Type I diabetes is unable to produce insulin, which is a hormone\nthat allows the body to process glucose. (See Medtronic’s Stmt. of Facts, ¶ 1.) Type I diabetics rely on\ndaily doses of insulin to control their levels of blood glucose and to prevent hypoglycemia (blood\nglucose levels that are too low) and hyperglycemia (blood glucose levels that are too high). (See id.\n¶¶ 1, 3.)\n\n\n\n                                                   5\n\flater—sometime between the late evening of September 8, 2007, and the early morning\n\nof September 9, 2007—Caroline experienced the hypoglycemic event that gives rise to\n\nthe claims at issue here. (See Unomedical’s Stmt. of Material Facts as to Which There\n\nIs No Genuine Issue (“Unomedical’s Stmt. of Facts”), ECF No. 132-10, ¶ 34.)\n\n      Although there are gaps in the timeline, the following basic facts are undisputed.\n\nCaroline and her roommate, Magdelena Posthumus, were together in their shared dorm\n\nroom on GW’s campus from approximately 7:00 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. on the evening of\n\nSeptember 8, 2007. (See Dep. of Magdelena E. Posthumus (“Posthumus Dep.”), Ex. G\n\nto Brown Decl., ECF No. 139-1 at 68–82, at 58:4–59:2.) During that time, Posthumus\n\nobserved Caroline napping, waking and eating a bowl of cereal, and then returning to\n\nbed. (See id.) The various data points that Caroline’s parents were able to retrieve\n\nfrom Caroline’s pump and glucometer indicate that Caroline’s blood sugar level was 77\n\nmg/dL at approximately 7:02 p.m., and that Caroline gave herself six units of insulin at\n\napproximately 8:30 p.m. (See Dep. of Karen Kubicki (“K. Kubicki Dep.”), Ex. F to\n\nBrown Decl., ECF No. 133-5 at 94–106, at 129:20–130:8; J. Kubicki Dep. at 212:3–24;\n\nsee also Handwritten Glucometer Readings, Ex. 21 to K. Kubicki Dep., ECF 133-5, at\n\n117.) Posthumus left the dorm for a couple of hours beginning at around 11:00 p.m.,\n\nand Caroline was sleeping both when Posthumus left and when she returned around\n\n12:30 a.m. (See Posthumus Dep. at 60:3–61:20.) At 8:00 a.m. the following morning,\n\nPosthumus discovered Caroline in distress in her bed; Caroline was foaming at the\n\nmouth and was otherwise unresponsive. (See Medtronic’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 28.)\n\n      Posthumus immediately notified a resident advisor, Siobhan Chapman, who in\n\nturn notified another resident advisor, Rebecca Barloon. (See Dep. of Rebecca Barloon\n\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\f(“Barloon Dep.”), Ex. 1 to Pls.’ Opp’n, ECF No. 138-3, at 42:21–23.) Posthumus also\n\ncalled 911 and reported that Caroline was unconscious and vomiting. (See GW Police\n\nDep’t Incident Report, Ex. 11 to Pls.’ Opp’n, ECF No. 138-13, at 2.) Emergency\n\npersonnel responded, and when they checked Caroline’s blood sugar, it registered at 20\n\nmg/dL—an extraordinarily low level. (See DCFEMS Incident Report, Ex. 13 to Pls.’\n\nOpp’n, ECF No. 138-15, at 3.) The paramedics gave Caroline an emergency injection\n\nof glucose, and then transported her to GW Hospital, where doctors administered\n\nfurther glucose; however, none of these efforts changed Caroline’s condition. (See id.;\n\nGW Hosp. Recs., Ex. 2 to Pls.’ Opp’n, ECF No. 138-4, at 6.) At GW Hospital, a CT\n\nhead scan revealed that Caroline was suffering from “diffuse cerebral edema.” (GW\n\nHosp. Recs. at 2.) 4 Caroline now resides in a nursing facility in a persistent vegetative\n\nstate, with no realistic possibility of recovery. (See Mot. Hr’g Tr. at 9:23–10:8.)\n\n       The readings that Plaintiffs were able to recover from Caroline’s glucometer\n\nshowed that Caroline’s insulin levels had fluctuated in the days leading up to her\n\ninjury—from a low of 43 mg/dL to a high of 568 mg/dL. (See Handwritten Glucometer\n\nReadings.) The full set of data could not be recovered from the MMT-522 Pump’s\n\nmemory because Mr. Kubicki removed the battery from the pump after a Medtronic\n\ncustomer service representative told him that doing so would not impact the data saved\n\non the device. (See Tr. of Tele. Call, Ex. 17 to Pls.’ Opp’n, ECF No. 138-19, at 9.)\n\nThe parties conducted joint non-destructive testing of Caroline’s pump, which did not\n\n\n\n4\n  “A CT scan is a computed tomography scan, also referred to as a CAT scan or computed axial\ntomography scan. The CT scan generates a three dimensional image of the inside of an object from a\nlarge series of two-dimensional X-ray images taken around a single axis of rotation.” McCarty v.\nAstrue, Civ. No. 08–432, 2008 WL 4922323, at *6 n.11 (M.D. Pa. Nov. 13, 2008).\n\n\n\n                                                 7\n\freveal any defects. (See Pls.’ Opp’n at 67–68.) 5 The MMT-396 Infusion Set that\n\nCaroline was using was discarded at an unknown time shortly after Caroline’s injury,\n\nand therefore the parties were not able to conduct any testing on that device. (See K.\n\nKubicki Dep. at 322:14–325:16.)\n\n        In the days after the hypoglycemic event, the Kubickis began gathering\n\ninformation in an attempt to determine what had caused Caroline’s blood sugar to drop\n\nso low. Their efforts included speaking to Caroline’s treating physicians at GW\n\nHospital, one of whom suggested to the Kubickis that they preserve and test the MMT-\n\n522 Pump because it appeared that Caroline had suffered an insulin overdose. (See J.\n\nKubicki Dep. at 23:25–25:13.) The Kubickis collected and retained Caroline’s medical\n\nsupplies, including the packaging materials for the discarded infusion set, and they\n\nconsulted with an attorney approximately five weeks after the incident. (See id. at\n\n22:22–23:18.)\n\n        B.      The Medtronic Paradigm Insulin Pump Model MMT-522 And\n                The Medtronic MiniMed Paradigm Quick-set Infusion Set,\n                Model MMT-396\n\n                1.      The Design And Operation Of These Medical Devices\n\n        The MMT-522 Pump is an FDA-regulated, insulin-pumping medical device that a\n\npatient wears outside her body. The device both monitors the patient’s blood glucose\n\nlevels and delivers insulin at rates that the patient programs. (See Decl. of Donna\n\nTwisdom (“Twisdom Decl.”), ECF No. 35-4, ¶ 3.) The MMT-522 Pump and the MMT-\n\n\n\n\n5\n  The only reported abnormality was the pump’s registering of an alarm code for “A45 Alarm after\nPrime/A33 Test.” (Pls.’ Opp’n at 19.) The record does not reveal what this alarm code means, but\nPlaintiffs represent that they “have reason to believe that it is triggered based on the amount of insulin\ndelivered by the Insulin Pump.” (Id. at 19 n.7.)\n\n\n                                                     8\n\f396 Infusion Set work together as a system, and appear as follows when attached to a\n\npatient:\n\n\n\n\n       Generally speaking, the insulin pump works by delivering background insulin\n\nthroughout the day according to the “basal rate” that the user sets, and the user can also\n\ngive herself a dose of insulin (called a “bolus”) on demand when she eats. (See Mot.\n\nHr’g Tr. at 59:21–60:21.) A cylindrical reservoir housed in the pump contains the insulin\n\nitself, and the insulin is delivered to the body through the infusion set. The infusion\n\nset, which is a separate medical device, consists of a thin plastic tube that has a tubing\n\nconnector—called a “p-cap”—at one end; the p-cap connects the tube to the insulin\n\nreservoir. (See Decl. of Rabi Gharabli (“Gharabli Decl.”), ECF 132-1, ¶ 10.) On the\n\nother end of the tube, there is a small needle that the user inserts into her body. (See\n\nid.)\n\n       Notably, when the pump’s insulin reservoir needs to be refilled, the user must\n\nfollow a number of steps carefully to accomplish this goal successfully. Specifically,\n\nthe user must disconnect the infusion set from her body; remove the empty reservoir\n\n\n                                             9\n\ffrom the pump; fill a new reservoir with insulin from an insulin vial; rewind the pump;\n\ninsert the new reservoir into the pump; and push insulin through to the infusion set—all\n\nbefore reattaching the infusion set to her body. (See User Guide, Ex. B to Twisdom\n\nDecl., ECF No. 35-4, at 66–72.) The portion of the manual instructing users on how to\n\nfill the reservoir, disconnect the vial, and attach the infusion set in 2007 (when Caroline\n\nwas injured) is reproduced below:\n\n\n\n\n(Id. at 67.) Significantly for present purposes, when removing the vial from the\n\nreservoir, the user is required to keep the reservoir upright, and she must ensure that the\n\ninside of the p-cap connector and the top of the reservoir are not wet when they are\n\nreconnected. (See infra Part II.C.3.)\n\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\f       The design and operation of the infusion set’s p-cap connecter is at the center of\n\nthe products-liability claims in this case. As Medtronic describes it, this particular\n\nconnector is a marvel of biomedical mechanical engineering:\n\n              [it] contains four small one-way vent openings which provide\n              airflow to equalize the pressure in the reservoir compartment\n              with the surrounding atmospheric pressure. The p-cap vent\n              openings are covered by a polytetrafluoroethylene (“PTFE”)\n              membrane that allows air to flow in and out of the\n              compartment thus eliminating any pressure differential\n              between the insulin reservoir and the end of the infusion set\n              (such as may be created when completing a manual prime of\n              the pump or during a rapid and dramatic change in altitude).\n\n(Medtronic’s Mem. at 17 (citations omitted).) Notably, the p-cap’s vent covering is\n\ncomprised of two different materials: the PFTE membrane is only on the topside, while\n\nthe underside (the part of the p-cap that touches the reservoir) is comprised of\n\npolyester. (See Dep. of Mark Curtis (“Curtis Dep.”), Ex. 22 to Pls.’ Opp’n, ECF No.\n\n138-24, at 211:7–19.)\n\n       Medtronic purportedly adopted this vented p-cap design for its insulin pumps so\n\nthat the pump can be watertight. (See Dep. of Susan McConnell Montalvo (“McConnell\n\nDep.”), Ex. 20 to Pls.’ Opp’n, ECF No. 138-22, at 43:17–44:14, 49:15–20, 53:5–9.)\n\nThe proper functioning of the vents is key to ensuring that the reservoir maintains\n\nappropriate internal pressure and that the pump delivers insulin at the appropriate rates.\n\n(See id. at 49:17–20; 94:22–95:19.) If the pressure inside the reservoir is too high\n\n(which can occur if the vents are blocked), the stopper in the pump will push insulin\n\ninto the infusion set in order to achieve pressure equilibrium, even if the pump is not\n\nprogrammed to deliver that insulin, resulting in an unscheduled delivery of insulin.\n\n(See id. at 94:2–4; 96:6–19.)\n\n\n\n\n                                            11\n\f                 2.     The Approval, Manufacturing, And Marketing Of These\n                        Medical Devices\n\n         The MMT-522 Pump and MMT-396 Infusion Set are two of a number of medical\n\ndevices that Medtronic markets for the management of diabetes. In June of 1999, the\n\nFDA approved a PMA Application that Medtronic submitted for a precursor device—\n\nthe Guardian Continuous Glucose Monitoring System, which consisted of a Guardian\n\nRT sensor and an external machine that measured and recorded an individual’s glucose\n\nlevels. See PMA Application No. P980022, Summary of Safety & Effectiveness Data 6;\n\nsee also infra Part VII.A.1 (discussing the FDA’s “premarket approval” (“PMA”)\n\nprocess). This system did not include an insulin pump as a component.\n\n         Medtronic first released its “Paradigm” insulin pump system into the market in\n\n2001, and it received 510(k) approval for its Paradigm MMT-515 Insulin Pump in May\n\nof 2004. See 510(k) Premarket Notification. 7 Thereafter, in October of 2005,\n\nMedtronic sought “approval for modifications to the MMT 515/715 external insulin\n\npump and to the Guardian RT sensor to enable the pump to accept data from the sensor,\n\nand to enable the sensor to communicate directly to the pump.” (Ex. A. to Decl. of\n\nMark Faillance (“PMA Approval”), ECF No. 35-5, at 9.) The FDA approved this new,\n\ncombined system, known as the Paradigm Real Time System, through a PMA\n\nSupplement on April 7, 2006. (See Decl. of Mark Faillance (“Faillance Decl.”), ECF\n\n\n\n\n6\n    Available at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf/P980022B.pdf.\n7\n  Available at\nhttps://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm?ID=K040676\n\n\n\n\n                                                  12\n\fNo. 35-5, ¶ 8.) The pump component of this approved device is the Paradigm MMT-\n\n522. 8\n\n         The FDA cleared the MMT-396 Infusion Set, including the vented p-cap\n\nconnector that is at the center of this case, on June 7, 2001, through the 510(k)\n\nclearance process. (See Decl. of Mark O’Donnell (“O’Donnell Decl.”), ECF No. 133-3,\n\n¶ 8.) Medtronic designed and manufactured the p-cap connector, while Unomedical,\n\nwhich owns the 510(k) for the MMT-396 Infusion Set, designed and manufactured all\n\nthe other components of the MMT-396 Infusion Set. (See id. ¶¶ 8–9.) Printed on the\n\nexterior of the MMT-396 Infusion Set packaging is the notation, “Assembled for\n\nUnomedical AS in Mexico,” (Packaging Photos, Ex. 61 to Pls.’ Opp’n, ECF No. 138-\n\n63, at 2), and Unomedical’s name also appears on the instruction sheet for the MMT-\n\n396 Infusion Set (Infusion Set Instructions, Ex. F to Gharabli Decl., ECF No. 134-3, at\n\n22), as well as on the individual MMT-396 Infusion Sets themselves (Mot. Hr’g Tr.\n\n73:19–74:6).\n\n         Unomedical’s role with respect to the p-cap was limited to the assembling of its\n\nMMT-396 Infusion Set tubing with the p-cap that Medtronic provided. (See\n\nUnomedical’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 29.) Unomedical then provided the assembled MMT-396\n\nInfusion Set to Medtronic, which Medtronic in turn sold to users in connection with its\n\nline of Paradigm insulin pumps, including the MMT-522 Pump. (See id. ¶ 30;\n\nO’Donnell Decl. ¶ 9.) The MMT-522 Pump and MMT-396 Infusion Set are\n\n\n\n\n8\n  Medtronic claims that the FDA advised it to proceed through the PMA Supplement process rather\nthan the 510(k) process because “creation of a new pump that incorporated a continuous glucose\nmonitoring system software was a significant change, and the new pump would not be substantially\nequivalent to any existing or pre-amendment device.” (Faillance Decl. ¶ 7.)\n\n\n\n                                                13\n\fprescription-only devices (see Medtronic’s Stmt. of Fact, ECF No. 131-2, ¶¶ 7, 9),\n\nwhich means that the devices are “available to the public only through a physician and\n\nare to be [used] only under a physician’s supervision[.]” MacPherson v. Searle & Co.,\n\n775 F. Supp. 417 , 422 (D.D.C. 1991).\n\n          C.    Infusion Set Recalls In 2009 And 2013\n\n                1.     2009 Return And Replace Recall Of The “Lot 8” Batch\n\n          On June 29, 2009, approximately 22 months after Caroline’s injury, Medtronic\n\nissued a recall for the “Lot 8” batch of its Paradigm infusion sets because of a possible\n\nmanufacturing defect. Specifically, Medtronic determined that a silicone lubricant used\n\nduring manufacturing could clog the vents in the p-cap of the infusion sets in the\n\nimpacted lot, and thus could cause the pump to deliver too much or too little insulin.\n\n(See Lot 8 Recall Notice, Ex. 26 to Pls.’ Opp’n, ECF No. 138-28.) Patients with\n\nimpacted infusion sets were instructed not to use them and to return the sets to\n\nMedtronic for replacements. (See id.) The MMT-396 Infusion Set that Caroline had at\n\nthe time of her injury did not come from Lot 8 and therefore would not have been part\n\nof this recall. (See Medtronic’s Resp. to Pls.’ Fourth Set of Reqs. for Produc., Ex. 28 to\n\nPls.’ Opp’n, ECF No. 138-30 at 4.)\n\n          In connection with the Lot 8 recall, Medtronic issued a “Questions & Answers”\n\nsheet in which it stated that all other Medtronic infusion sets were safe to use. (See\n\nQuestions & Answers Regarding the “Lot 8” Quick-set Induction Set Recall, Ex. 27 to\n\nPls.’ Opp’n, ECF No. 138-29, at 2–3.) Medtronic made no mention of Unomedical—\n\nwhich had manufactured the parts of the infusion set other than the p-cap and had\n\nassembled the infusion sets, as explained above—in the documents associated with this\n\nrecall.\n\n\n                                             14\n\f              2.       2013 Paradigm Infusion Set Recall\n\n       Four years after the Lot 8 recall, on June 7, 2013, Medtronic issued a broad\n\n“Class I recall” of its Paradigm infusion sets, including the MMT-396 Infusion Set that\n\nCaroline had owned at the time of her injury. (See Infusion Sets Recall Notice (“2013\n\nRecall Notice”), Ex. 18 to Pls.’ Opp’n, ECF No. 138-20, at 2.) Unlike the Lot 8 recall,\n\nthis recall did not involve replacement of the recalled device; rather, Medtronic\n\nprovided more information to users, explaining in the recall announcement that there\n\nwas a risk of under- or over-delivery of insulin if the top of the insulin reservoir or the\n\ninside of the p-cap becomes wet while the user is refilling the reservoir with insulin.\n\n(See id.) The impetus for this recall was Medtronic’s discovery (first through viewing\n\nvideos uploaded on YouTube) that some users were holding the insulin reservoir\n\nhorizontally when refilling it, which can result in fluid touching the inside of the p-cap\n\nand blocking the vents. (See E-Mail from S. Schriever (June 11, 2013), Ex. 57 to Pls.’\n\nOpp’n, ECF No. 138-59, at 2.) In the notification sent to pump users in connection with\n\nthe recall, Medtronic specifically instructed users to ensure that the insulin vial is\n\nupright when removing it from the reservoir in order to prevent liquid transfer to the p-\n\ncap, and it also declared that users should ensure that the reservoir tip and p-cap are dry\n\nbefore connecting them. (See Letter from Shirajul Karim (June 10, 2013) (“Dear User\n\nLetter”), Ex. 29 to Pls.’ Opp’n, ECF No. 138-31, at 2-3.) The recall notice identified\n\nUnomedical A/S as one of the manufacturers of the recalled infusion sets. (See 2013\n\nRecall Notice at 2.)\n\n       The pictures from the safety notification, which were issued to remind users\n\nabout the correct way to refill the reservoir, are reproduced below.\n\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\f                   Hold insulin vial upright when removing reservoir.\n\n\n\n\n                        Make sure these are dry when connecting.\n\n(Dear User Letter at 2–3.)\n\n       In the context of the instant litigation, Medtronic characterizes the issue that led\n\nto the 2013 infusion set recall as a “temporary blocked vent,” and it asserts that “[t]he\n\nprecise sequence of events required for the temporary blocked vent to occur (spilled\n\nfluid on the interior of the p-cap connector, saturation of all four vents, and excess\n\npressure building) make it a rare occurrence.” (Medtronic’s Mem. at 29.) Medtronic\n\nfurther maintains that it is even more unlikely that a temporary blocked vent will injure\n\nan infusion set user, because the user should have detached the pump and infusion set\n\nfrom herself while the reservoir was being refilled. (See id. at 29–30.) Medtronic\n\nclaims that it has received fewer than 100 complaints per year from users regarding\n\ntemporary blocked vents (out of approximately 425,000 pump users), and that it\n\n“implemented [the 2013 recall as a] voluntary field corrective action” after “becoming\n\n\n                                            16\n\faware of the sequence of events that could le[a]d to a temporary blocked vent[.]” (Id.\n\nat 29–30.)\n\n                3.      2013 FDA Warning Letter\n\n        On September 19, 2013, the FDA issued a formal “warning” letter to Medtronic\n\nfollowing an inspection of Medtronic’s Northridge, California office. (See Ex. 55 to\n\nPls.’ Opp’n (“2013 Warning Letter”), ECF No. 131-3.) This warning was purportedly\n\nbased on the agency’s finding that Medtronic had violated certain rules known as the\n\n“current good manufacturing process regulations” (“CGMPs”) with respect to its\n\nParadigm insulin pumps (including the MMT-522 model pumps) in a number of ways.\n\n(Id. at 2.) 9 The FDA cited various deficiencies, including Medtronic’s “[f]ailure to\n\nestablish and maintain procedures for implementing corrective and preventative action,\n\nas required by 21 C.F.R. 820.100(a)[,]” (id. at 3); “failure to identify actions needed to\n\ncorrect and prevent recurrence of the Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps (MMT-5XX,\n\n7XX) device failure” (id.); and “failure to review and evaluate all complaints to\n\ndetermine whether an investigation is necessary and to maintain a record that includes\n\nthe reason no investigation was made and the name of the individual responsible for the\n\ndecision not to investigate when no investigation is made” (id. at 5). The FDA also\n\nannounced the agency’s conclusion that, due to the 13 different CGMP violations the\n\nthat agency had found, Paradigm insulin pumps dating back to 2002 qualify as\n\n“adulterated” under 21 U.S.C. § 351(h), and also “misbranded under section 502(t)(2)\n\n\n\n\n9\n  CGMPs are general regulations that the FDA has promulgated which govern “the methods used in,\nand the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage,\ninstallation, and servicing of all finished devices intended for human use.” 21 C.F.R. § 820.1(a)(1).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  17\n\fof the Act.” (Id. at 2, 15.) None of the 13 CGMP violations that are discussed in the\n\nwarning letter pertain to the temporary-block-vent condition of the MMT-396 Infusion\n\nSet that the Kubickis allege in their complaint. 10\n\n       Notably, in the text of its 2013 letter to Medtronic, the FDA expressly\n\nadmonished Medtronic for its reporting failures. (See id. at 25–26 (asserting that\n\nMedtronic’s “Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps are misbranded . . . in that your firm\n\nfailed or refused to furnish material or information respecting the device that is required\n\nby or under the [MDA]” regarding incidents where users reportedly received an\n\noverdose of insulin from the pump).) 11 The FDA further faulted Medtronic for not\n\n“establish[ing] internal systems that provide for timely and effective indication,\n\ncommunication, and evaluation of events that may be subject to [medical device\n\nreporting] requirements[,]” and for not “establish[ing] internal systems that provide for\n\na standardized review process to determine when an event meets the criteria for\n\nreporting under this part.” (Id. at 26.)\n\n\n\n\n10\n   One potentially similar defect identified in the FDA warning letter is a failure to take corrective\naction regarding “overlay leaks . . . which could cause moisture ingress into the pump and pump\nfailure.” (2013 Warning Letter at 3.) However, the root cause of these leaks is identified as the\n“ultrasonic window welding process [which] causes initiation of stress-cracks, thus causing adverse\neffects to the finished device.” (Id. at 4.) And Plaintiffs do not contend that Caroline’s injury was\ncaused by any such “overlay leak.” Similarly, the 2013 Warning Letter faults Medtronic for failing to\nreview and investigate pump-related complaints properly, citing as examples a pump where “the keypad\noverlay had weak adhesive bond at locations[;]” two pumps with “loose motor support disk[s;]” and one\npump with “faulty FSR (gold).” (Id. at 7.) None of the cited examples involved the failure to\ninvestigate temporary blocked vent problems.\n11\n   The FDCA bars both the misbranding of any medical device in interstate commerce, and the\nintroduction of any misbranded device into interstate commerce. 21 U.S.C. § 331(a), (b). The statute\ndelineates a number of ways in which a medical device can be deemed misbranded, including where the\nproduct labeling is defective, see id. § 352 (b), (c), where the device was manufactured in an\nunregistered facility, see id. § 352 (o), or where a manufacturer or importer has failed to comply with\nadverse event reporting requirements, see id. § 352(t).\n\n\n                                                  18\n\fIII.    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n        A.      The Initial Pump-Related Legal Action The Plaintiffs Brought\n                Against Medtronic Alone\n\n        On September 2, 2010, the Kubickis filed a lawsuit against Medtronic on\n\nCaroline’s behalf in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. (See Brown Decl.\n\n¶ 3.) That complaint was dismissed without prejudice after the parties entered into a\n\ntolling agreement, and when the agreement expired, the Kubickis initiated the instant\n\nlawsuit by refiling their complaint against Medtronic in Superior Court. (See id.) Their\n\ninitial complaint asserted claims for negligence, strict liability, misrepresentation,\n\nfraud, breach of express and implied warranties, violation of the District of Columbia\n\nDeceptive Trade Practices Act, and failure to warn under Restatement of Torts § 388,\n\nbased on Caroline’s use of the “Medtronic MiniMed Paradigm® Insulin Pump Model\n\nMMT-522.” (See Compl., Ex. A to Notice of Removal, ECF No. 1, ¶ 4.) This initial\n\ncomplaint did not contain any specific allegations pertaining to the MMT-396 Infusion\n\nSet. (See generally id.)\n\n        Medtronic removed the complaint to federal court on May 8, 2012. (See Notice\n\nof Removal, ECF No. 1-2.) 12 Shortly after removal, Medtronic filed a motion to\n\ndismiss the Kubickis’ complaint, asserting that Plaintiffs had failed to plead their\n\nclaims sounding in fraud with particularity; that their implied warranty claims were\n\nduplicative of their strict liability claims; and that the doctrines of express and implied\n\npreemption barred all of the claims. (See Medtronic Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 4.) The\n\nCourt granted this motion in part, dismissing without prejudice the Kubickis’ fraud-\n\n\n12\n   U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly presided over this case until it was transferred to the\nundersigned in July of 2013.\n\n\n\n                                                   19\n\fbased claims, as well as their implied warranty claims. See Kubicki v. Medtronic, No.\n\n12cv0734, 2013 WL 1739580, at *1 (D.D.C. Mar. 21, 2013). However, the Court\n\nrejected Medtronic’s contention that the remaining claims in the complaint should be\n\ndismissed on either express or implied preemption grounds. Id. at *9–11. 13\n\n        With respect to express preemption, the Court found that the Kubickis had\n\n“assert[ed] violations of the requirements set forth by the FDA as the cause of the\n\nalleged defects and ensuing violation of District of Columbia law[,]” such that the state\n\nlaw claims survived a challenge under Rule 12(b)(6). Id. at *8. However, in so\n\nholding, the Court kept the door open for Medtronic to renew its express preemption\n\nchallenge following discovery, noting that “[w]hile the Court finds Plaintiffs’ pleading\n\nsufficient to pass muster at this motion to dismiss stage, the Court does expect that as\n\nthis action proceeds, Plaintiffs will refine their claims to more specifically articulate the\n\nparallel relationship between the alleged common law duties and the federal\n\nrequirements.” Id. at *9.\n\n        As for implied preemption, the Court rejected Medtronic’s preemption argument\n\non the grounds that Plaintiffs were not seeking to assert claims based on violation of\n\nFDA regulations (which the Supreme Court has found improper), but instead were\n\npleading claims under “‘traditional state tort law.’” Id. at *11 (quoting Buckman\n\nCompany v. Plaintiffs’ Legal Committee, 531 U.S. 341, 352 (2001)).\n\n\n\n\n13\n   See infra Part VI.A.2 and VI.A.3 for a discussion of the doctrines of express and implied\npreemption.\n\n\n\n                                                  20\n\f        B.      Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint, Which Adds Unomedical And\n                Claims That Relate Specifically To The Infusion Set\n\n        The Kubickis filed an amended complaint on January 10, 2014. (See Am.\n\nCompl., ECF No. 51.) With leave of Court and over Medtronic’s objection (see Pls.’\n\nMot. for Leave to Amend the Compl., ECF No. 38; Medtronic Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. for\n\nLeave to Amend the Compl., ECF No. 41), the Kubickis’ amended complaint included\n\nUnomedical as a defendant, and also, for the first time in the course of the litigation,\n\nmade specific allegations regarding defects in the MMT-396 Infusion Set. (See Am.\n\nCompl. ¶ 27.) 14 Medtronic and Unomedical then filed pre-discovery dispositive\n\nmotions related to the amended complaint, which this Court denied on January 14,\n\n2015; the Court instructed the parties instead to proceed to engage in fact discovery,\n\nand it provided both defendants with the opportunity to file either an answer or an\n\nomnibus motion addressing all issues regarding the legal sufficiency of the complaint in\n\nresponse to a second amended complaint that the plaintiffs proposed to file after\n\ndiscovery. (See Order Revising Schedule for Pretrial Proceedings, ECF No. 111.)\n\n        On July 31, 2015, after the scheduled period of fact discovery ended, the\n\nKubickis filed a second amended complaint, which is the operative complaint for the\n\npurpose of the instant motions. (See 2d Am. Compl.). As noted above, this complaint\n\nasserts causes of action for negligence (Counts I–V), strict liability (Counts VI–X),\n\nbreach of express warranties (Counts XI–XV), failure to warn (Counts XVI–XX), and\n\npunitive damages (Counts XXI-XXV). (See generally id.) There are multiple counts\n\n\n\n14\n   Plaintiffs also added Flextronics International USA, Inc, as a defendant in their amended complaint,\nalleging that the company was involved in the manufacture and/or sale of the Infusion Set (see Am.\nCompl. ¶ 11), but later voluntarily dismissed the claims against Flextronics (see Stip. of Dismissal as to\nFlextronics Int’l USA, Inc., ECF No. 69).\n\n\n\n                                                   21\n\fpertaining to each theory of liability because each theory is asserted separately against\n\neach of the five entities named as defendants in the complaint (Medtronic, Inc.,\n\nMedtronic Diabetes, Medtronic MiniMed Inc., Unomedical Devices SA de CV, and\n\nUnomedical Devices A/S, respectively). (See generally id.) The claims against\n\nMedtronic pertain to both the MMT-522 Pump and the MMT-396 Infusion Set (see id.\n\nCounts I–III, VI–VIII, XI–XIII, XVI–XVIII, XXI–XXVIII, while the claims against\n\nUnomedical pertain only to the MMT-396 Infusion Set (see id. Counts IV–V, IX–X,\n\nXIV–XV, XIX–XX, XXIV–XXV).\n\n       Notably, the Kubickis’ negligence claims against Medtronic allege that\n\nMedtronic violated various duties in connection with the company’s design and\n\nmarketing of the MMT-522 Pump and MMT-396 Infusion Set, including:\n\n                 “[the D]uty to act with reasonable care in designing the\n                  MiniMed Insulin Pump and Paradigm Infusion Sets\n                  [which] parallels the federal requirements set forth in 21\n                  C.F.R. § 820.30 et seq. related to design controls[]” (id.\n                  ¶ 89);\n\n                 “[the D]uty to act with reasonable care in providing\n                  adequate instructions for use, labeling and warnings for\n                  the MiniMed Insulin Pump and Paradigm Infusion Sets\n                  [which] parallels the federal requirements set forth in 21\n                  C.F.R. § 801, et seq. and 21 U.S.C. § 352[]” (id. ¶ 90);\n\n                 “[the D]uty to act with reasonable care in documenting,\n                  logging, investigating, and reporting to the FDA and the\n                  public any complaints it received from users concerning\n                  instances of unintended overdelivery of insulin in the\n                  MiniMed Insulin Pump and Paradigm Infusion Sets\n                  [which] parallels the requirements set forth in 21 C.F.R.\n                  § 820, et seq. and 21 C.F.R. 803, et seq[]” (id. ¶ 91); and\n\n                 “[the D]uty to act with reasonable care in manufacturing\n                  the MiniMed Insulin Pump and Paradigm Infusion Sets\n\n\n\n\n                                            22\n\f                 [which] parallels the requirements set forth in 21 C.F.R.\n                 § 820, et seq” (id. ¶ 92).\n\n(See also id. at ¶¶ 95–98, 101–04.) The Kubickis assert these same alleged negligent\n\nbreaches of duty with respect to Unomedical regarding the MMT-396 Infusion Set.\n\n(See id. ¶¶ 107–10, 113–16.)\n\n       As for their strict liability claims against Medtronic, which are asserted under the\n\nRestatement of Torts § 402A, the Kubickis allege that Medtronic sold “MiniMed Insulin\n\nPumps and Paradigm Infusion Sets to Ms. Kubicki in a defective condition that was\n\nunreasonably dangerous to consumers such as Ms. Kubicki[]” due to the inadequate\n\nlabeling, inadequate instructions for priming and filling, inadequate warnings\n\nconcerning the devices’ potential to cause an unintended overdelivery of insulin,\n\nimproper design in violation of FDA design control regulations, improper manufacture\n\nin violation of FDA CGMPs, and failure to provide notice of complaints and adverse\n\nevents. (Id. ¶¶ 121, 128, 135.) The Kubickis make identical allegations against\n\nUnomedical with respect to the MMT-396 Infusion Set. (See id. ¶¶ 142–49.)\n\n       The Kubickis’ breach of warranty claims assert that Medtronic breached an\n\nexpress warranty allegedly set forth in the product packaging that the MMT-522 Pump\n\nwould be free from “defects in materials and workmanship for a period of four years\n\nfrom the date of purchase[,]” (id. ¶ 158), as well as the express guarantee that the\n\nMMT-396 Infusion Set would be free from “defects in materials and workmanship for a\n\nperiod of up to three days from the date the packaging of the individual infusion set was\n\nopened” (id. ¶ 160). Plaintiffs further allege that Medtronic had “warranted in\n\nadvertising and promotional materials” that the MMT-522 Pump and MMT-396\n\nInfusion Set were “safe for use because the company had modified the design from\n\n\n\n                                            23\n\fprevious models to move the pressure-venting component from the insulin pump to the\n\ninfusion set . . . [and] that this [design modification] would make the updated models of\n\nthe devices safer than the previous versions and other models on the market by\n\npreventing vent blockage[,]” and that Medtronic had breached this warranty. (Id. ¶ 162;\n\nsee also id. at ¶¶ 164–85.) Plaintiffs likewise assert that Unomedical breached the\n\nthree-day warranty that it offered on the MMT-396 Infusion Set, in addition to the\n\npromotional warranty that the design changes made the device safer. (See id. ¶¶ 191–\n\n93, 200–02.)\n\n       C.      Medtronic’s And Unomedical’s Motions For Summary\n               Judgment\n\n       Medtronic and Unomedical have each moved for summary judgment with respect\n\nto Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint. (See Medtronic’s MSJ; Unomedical’s MSJ.)\n\nMedtronic makes three overarching arguments, each of which would dispose of this\n\ncase in its entirety: (1) there is no evidence of causation (Medtronic’s Mem. at 21–31),\n\n(2) Plaintiffs’ claims are expressly and impliedly preempted (see id. at 31–45), and (3)\n\nthe statute of limitations bars Plaintiffs’ claims (see id. at 45–53). Medtronic further\n\nargues that Medtronic is entitled to summary judgment on the punitive damages claim\n\nbecause the record contains no evidence of intentional wrongdoing. (See id. at 58–60.)\n\nUnomedical asserts that it is entitled to summary judgment on the basis of the statute of\n\nlimitations and implied preemption (Unomedical’s Mem. at 25–26; 44–47), and it also\n\nseeks summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ punitive damages claims, arguing that its\n\nalleged misconduct is not sufficiently outrageous or egregious to state a claim for\n\npunitive damages (see id. at 49–50).\n\n\n\n\n                                            24\n\f       This Court held a hearing on these motions on November 3, 2016, during which\n\nPlaintiffs represented to the Court that they were abandoning all of the claims against\n\nUnomedical except for the failure to warn claims that are brought under both the\n\nnegligence and strict liability theories. (See Mot. Hr’g Tran. at 5:5–6:1.)\n\n\nIV.    LEGAL STANDARD FOR MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n\n       The standard that applies to motions for summary judgment brought under\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 is clear beyond cavil. A court must grant summary\n\njudgment to the movant if the moving party “shows that there is no genuine dispute as\n\nto any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 56(a). “A fact is material if it ‘might affect the outcome of the suit under the\n\ngoverning law,’ and a dispute about a material fact is genuine ‘if the evidence is such\n\nthat a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.’” Steele v.\n\nSchafer, 535 F.3d 689, 692 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,\n\n477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986)).\n\n       The moving party has the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine\n\ndispute as to any material fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).\n\nOnce the moving party has met this burden, the non-moving party must “designate\n\n‘specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.’” Id. at 324 (quoting Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 56(e)). Although the Court must view the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inference in that party’s\n\nfavor, see, e.g., Grosdidier v. Broad. Bd. of Governors, Chairman, 709 F.3d 19, 23\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2013) (citation omitted), the non-moving party must show more than “[t]he\n\nmere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of” his or her position, Anderson,\n\n\n\n                                            25\n\f477 U.S. at 252. That is, in order to advance to trial, “there must be evidence on which\n\nthe jury could reasonably find” for the non-moving party. Id. Thus, the non-moving\n\nparty “may not rest upon mere allegation or denials of his pleading but must present\n\naffirmative evidence showing a genuine issue for trial.” Laningham v. U.S. Navy, 813\n\nF.2d 1236, 1241 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n\nV.     RULING ON CAUSATION\n\n       As explained, Medtronic’s summary judgment brief opens with an argument that\n\nit maintains disposes of this entire case: that the record contains insufficient evidence\n\nto support a jury finding that either the MMT-522 Pump or the MMT-396 Infusion Set\n\nactually caused Caroline’s injuries, and thus there is no genuine dispute of fact\n\nregarding the causation element, which pertains to all of Plaintiffs’ claims. (See\n\nMedtronic’s Mem. at 31–32.) 15 To be specific, Medtronic insists that the record\n\nevidence indisputably demonstrates that Caroline was not connected to her insulin pump\n\nat the time of her hypoglycemic incident, which means that the pump and infusion set\n\ncould not possibly have caused her injury. (See id. at 35.) And Medtronic offers\n\nvarious alternative causes for the precipitous drop in Caroline’s blood sugar level—\n\nsuch as “inadequate monitoring of blood sugar levels, hypoglycemia unawareness,\n\ninadequate food intake, excessive exercise, dosing error by the patient, or some\n\ncombination of these things[,]” (id.)—to bolster its causation argument, as laid out in an\n\naffidavit from Helena W. Rodbard, M.D., FACP, MACE, one of Medtronic’s retrained\n\nexpert witnesses (see Rodbard Decl.).\n\n\n15\n  As noted above, Unomedical has adopted Medtronic’s arguments regarding causation (see\nUnomedical’s Mem. at 10 n.1), and therefore the analysis in this section of the Memorandum Opinion\napplies to Unomedical’s request for summary judgment on causation grounds as well.\n\n\n\n                                                26\n\f        This Court has already found that, by offering Dr. Rodbard’s assessment of\n\npotential alternative causes for Caroline’s injuries prior to the parties’ formal entry into\n\nthe expert-discovery phase of this litigation, Medtronic has jumped the gun. (See Min.\n\nOrder of Apr. 8, 2016 (holding that “Medtronic’s submission of an expert declaration\n\n(and related argument) regarding causation is premature”).) As a result, the Court\n\npreviously granted Plaintiffs’ motion to strike the causation-hypothesis-related portions\n\nof Dr. Rodbard’s declaration, as well as the parts of Medtronic’s summary judgment\n\nbrief that rely on the stricken parts of the declaration. (See id.) Thus, today, this Court\n\nconsiders only whether Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on causation\n\ngrounds based on what the (admittedly incomplete) record that is now before this Court\n\nreveals.\n\n        As explained below, this Court finds that the record is such that a genuine\n\ndispute currently exists regarding the material question of whether Caroline was, in\n\nfact, connected to her insulin pump at the time of the hypoglycemic incident, which\n\nmeans that summary judgment is inappropriate at this time. However, the Court will\n\npermit Defendants to renew their causation arguments following the close of the\n\nforthcoming period of expert discovery. 16\n\n\n\n16\n   Thus, today’s causation ruling pertains only to what the current record demonstrates regarding the\nissue of whether Caroline was connected to the pump when the hypoglycemic incident occurred. The\nstatements that Medtronic makes to suggest that (a) Caroline did not experience a temporary blocked\nvent even if she was connected to the pump, and (b) such a blockage could not have caused her injury\nin any event (see Medtronic’s Mem. at 37–39), have not been squarely presented as a basis for the\ninstant request for summary judgment, nor could they be, given that expert discovery is still pending.\nTherefore, the instant Memorandum Opinion addresses only one aspect of Defendants’ causation-\nrelated contentions—i.e., that Caroline was not in fact connected to the insulin pump at the time of her\ninjury—and should not be construed more broadly. (See Min. Order of Apr. 8, 2016 (preserving for\ncurrent consideration only “the portions of Medtronic’s brief [relating to causation] that argue that\nthere is no evidence that Caroline Kubicki was wearing her insulin pump at the time of her underlying\ninjury”).)\n\n\n\n                                                   27\n\f       A.     The Record Evidence Thus Far Submitted Is Not Sufficient To\n              Warrant Granting Summary Judgment To Defendants On\n              Causation Grounds\n\n       As Medtronic itself acknowledges, “[b]ecause [Caroline] was alone for a\n\nsignificant portion” of the evening of September 8, 2007, “we are left with an\n\nincomplete picture of exactly what happened to [her].” (Medtronic’s Mem. at 21–22.)\n\nNevertheless, Medtronic maintains that it is entitled to summary judgment at this\n\njuncture, because, in its view, what we do know from the facts that the parties have\n\ngathered thus far indicates that Caroline was not actually using her insulin pump and\n\nthe associated infusion set at the time of her hypoglycemic event. (Id. at 35.) The\n\ncenterpiece of Medtronic’s causation claim is the deposition testimony of Caroline’s\n\nroommate (Magdelena Posthumus) that the MMT-522 Pump was “not attached to\n\n[Caroline]” when Posthumus discovered Caroline in distress on the morning of\n\nSeptember 9, 2007, but instead was laying on Caroline’s desk. (See Medtronic’s Mem.\n\nat 22 (“According to Ms. Posthumus, when she discovered Ms. Kubicki at 8:00 a.m., the\n\nMMT-522 Pump was not attached to Ms. Kubicki.” (citing Posthumus Dep. at 20:5–12,\n\n20:20–23, 67:24–68:22, 70:5–13)) (emphasis omitted); see also Medtronic’s Stmt. of\n\nFacts ¶ 29.) In addition, Medtronic points to Posthumus’s statement to the 911\n\ndispatcher, made shortly after she discovered her roommate, that Caroline, “‘ha[d]\n\nsomething that’s supposed to attach to her body but it’s not attached[,]’” and that\n\nPosthumus did not know whether Caroline “‘took it out herself[.]’” (Medtronic’s Mem.\n\nat 22 (quoting 911 Call Transcript, Ex. W to Brown Decl., ECF No. 133-5, at 221) (first\n\nalteration in original).)\n\n       Medtronic further maintains that the police officers who responded to the scene\n\nreported that Posthumus had told them that Caroline “‘carried around a device that\n\n\n                                           28\n\fperiodically dosed medication into her body’” and that “‘there was no indication that\n\nthe device was attached’” to Caroline’s body when Posthumus discovered her. (Id.\n\n(quoting Police Report, Ex. V to Brown Decl., ECF No. 133-5, at 214).) Caroline’s\n\nmedical records also appear to indicate that the responding paramedics “‘found [the]\n\ninsulin pump disconnected’” on Caroline’s desk, but that, in the paramedics’ view, it\n\nwas “‘unclear’” whether Posthumus “‘did this when [Caroline was] found\n\nunresponsive[.]’” (Id. (quoting GWU Medical Records, Ex. U to Brown Decl., ECF No.\n\n133-5, at 209) (first alteration in original).)\n\n       Plaintiffs vociferously dispute Medtronic’s contention that the pump was\n\ndetached from Caroline’s body (see Pls.’ Stmt. of Fact ¶ 1), characterizing Posthumus’s\n\ntestimony as “equivocal and unreliable” (Pls.’ Opp’n at 55), and noting that not only\n\nhad Posthumus failed to recall certain details about the insulin pump (id. at 59 (citing\n\nPosthumus Dep. at 133:3–25)), she did not even remember the fact that she had called\n\n911 on the morning in question (id. (citing Posthumus Dep. at 131:10–16)). Plaintiffs\n\nfurther argue that Posthumus had been out late with her friends on the evening of\n\nSeptember 8, 2017, “and it is unclear whether she was consuming alcohol, affecting her\n\nmemory and cognition the following morning.” (Id.) Plaintiffs also point out that\n\nPosthumus testified that Caroline was wearing pajamas and that Posthumus could not\n\nrule out the pump being underneath Caroline’s sleep clothes; that Posthumus did not\n\nnotice the location of the pump on the desk until several minutes had passed, during\n\nwhich time numerous people had entered and left the dorm room; and that she did not\n\nknow when the pump was placed on the desk. (See id. at 59–60 (citing Posthumus Dep.\n\nat 134:5–13, 160:19–21, 163:12–14).)\n\n\n\n\n                                              29\n\f      The Kubickis further maintain that, far from establishing that Caroline was not\n\nusing the pump on the night in question, Caroline’s medical records actually support the\n\ncontention that Caroline was, in fact, connected to her pump. For instance, Plaintiffs\n\nread Caroline’s hospital records to state that Caroline’s pump was covered in vomit, and\n\nthey argue that the pump “could not feasibly have been covered with pink vomit unless\n\nit was with Caroline at the time she suffered her acute hypoglycemic injury.” (Id. at 61\n\n(citing GWU Hosp. Records, ECF No. 138-4, at 4).) Plaintiffs also point to other\n\nstatements in Caroline’s medical records that suggest that it was Posthumus who\n\nremoved the pump from Caroline’s body (id. at 61 (citing GWU Hosp. Records at 4)),\n\nor that Caroline had removed the pump herself on the morning of September 9 (id. at 61\n\n(citing GWU Hops. Records at 6)). Plaintiffs also note that a resident advisor had\n\nrecalled seeing an small plastic box on Caroline’s body while Caroline was unconscious\n\nin her bed (id. at 61–62 (citing Barloon Dep. at 59, 96:18–25, 89:25–93:23, 97:8–15)),\n\nand that a paramedic has removed a “sticker” attached to Caroline’s abdomen, which\n\nthey surmise was the “the adhesive attached to her infusion set” (id. at 62 (citing\n\nHumphrey Dep. at 46:21–47:10, 59:8–15)). Additionally, when deposed, both of the\n\nKubickis testified that it simply was not Caroline’s practice to take her pump off at\n\nnight. (See id. (citing J. Kubicki Dep. at 418:2–4; K. Kubicki Dep. at 395:15–21).)\n\n      In response, Medtronic insists that the Kubickis “mischaracteriz[e]” the evidence\n\n(Reply in Support of Medtronic’s Mot. (“Medtronic’s Reply”), ECF No. 145, at 11), and\n\nit provides detailed, alternative characterizations of the deposition testimony and\n\nmedical records at issue (id. at 10–14). Moreover, Medtronic reiterates that “[t]he only\n\ntestimony concerning what Ms. Kubicki was doing on the evening in question came\n\n\n\n\n                                            30\n\ffrom Posthumus, who testified Ms. Kubicki was asleep when Posthumus left for the\n\nevening and remained in that state from the time Posthumus returned to her dorm and\n\nread a book for an hour to when she awoke and discovered Ms. Kubicki in distress the\n\nfollowing morning.” (Medtronic’s Reply at 15 (citing Medtronic Mem at 22).)\n\n       This Court has no doubt that the instant record is not sufficient to establish\n\nindisputably that Caroline was not connected to her insulin pump on the night in\n\nquestion, because there is evidence the points in both directions, and because the issue\n\nprimarily turns on Ms. Postumus’s recollection of events, as Medtronic appears to have\n\nacknowledged. It is well established that “[c]redibility determinations, the weighing of\n\nthe evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions,\n\nnot those of a judge at summary judgment.” Barnett v. PA Consulting Grp., Inc., 715\n\nF.3d 354, 358 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (citation omitted). And, indeed, this Court’s role in\n\ndeciding a motion for summary judgment is not to “determine the truth of the matter,\n\nbut instead [to] decide only whether there is a genuine issue for trial.” Id.\n\n       As this Court views the current record, there is evidence from which a reasonable\n\njury could conclude either that the insulin pump was involved in Caroline’s injury\n\nbecause it was attached to her on the night in question (see, e.g., GWU Hosp. Records\n\nat 4, 6; Barloon Dep. at 59, 96:18–25, 89:25–93:23, 97:8–15) or that the insulin pump\n\nhad nothing to do with Caroline’s injury because it was laying on her desk unused at the\n\ntime that Postumous discovered Caroline (see, e.g., Posthumus Dep. at 20:5–12, 20:20–\n\n23, 67:24–68:22, 70:5–13; 911 Call Transcript). Drilling down even farther, it appears\n\nthat, even if the jury were to conclude that the pump was on Caroline’s desk, the\n\ncausation question would not be entirely resolved, because the current record does not\n\n\n\n\n                                            31\n\fexplain when or how Caroline’s insulin pump ended up there. Based on the existing\n\nrecord evidence, then, a jury could only reasonably infer that the pump was placed on\n\nthe desk sometime between 8:30 p.m. on the evening of September 8th—when Caroline\n\ngave herself six units of insulin (see K. Kubicki Dep. at 129:20–130:8)—and the\n\nmorning of September 9th—when emergency personnel took Caroline to the hospital.\n\nWithin this key block of time is a substantial period for which no competent individual\n\ncan provide eyewitnesses testimony, because Posthumus was out with friends from\n\n10:30 p.m. the evening of September 8th until 12:30 a.m. the following morning, and\n\nwas asleep thereafter. Thus, Posthumus’s testimony does not go far enough in\n\nanswering the question of whether the pump did or did not contribute to Caroline’s\n\ninjury, even if it is deemed credible, which means that expert opinion regarding whether\n\nthe factual circumstances reflected in the record indicate that Caroline was actually\n\nusing the allegedly defective pump within the pertinent timeframe on the night of\n\nSeptember 8th and the morning of September 9th is likely to be necessary.\n\n       Consequently, the current testimony and documentary evidence are simply not\n\nsufficient to establish that there is no issue of fact for trial with respect to the material\n\nissue of whether Caroline was using her insulin pump at the time of her injury. If\n\nnothing else, it is patently obvious that the parties’ volley of competing evidentiary\n\ninterpretations and witness-credibility assessments raise more causation questions than\n\nthe record presently answers, and these lingering questions are plainly ones that a\n\njury—and not this Court—must resolve. See In re Fort Totten Metrorail Cases Arising\n\nOut of Events of June 22, 2009, 895 F. Supp. 2d 48, 70 (D.D.C. 2012) (noting that\n\n“proximate causation is ordinarily a question of fact for the jury. . . . [and] that it is\n\n\n\n\n                                              32\n\fonly the exceptional case in which questions of proximate cause pass from the realm of\n\nfact to one of law” (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)); see also Boodoo v.\n\nCary, 21 F.3d 1157, 1161 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (“The court may not substitute its judgment\n\nfor that of the jury: it neither assesses witness credibility nor weighs evidence.”\n\n(citation omitted)); Ferebee v. Chevron Chem. Co., 736 F.2d 1529, 1536 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1984) (finding that, where there was conflicting evidence regarding causation, court\n\nproperly submitted the question to jury).\n\n       B.     The Parties Will Be Permitted To Revisit The Causation\n              Question After Expert Discovery Is Completed\n\n       To be clear: this Court’s ruling on causation is a relatively narrow one, in that it\n\npertains only to the pending motions for summary judgment. (See supra n.16.) The\n\nCourt anticipates that the parties will undertake expert discovery in this matter (see\n\nOrder Revising Schedule for Pretrial Proceedings, ECF No. 11, at 1–3 (setting schedule\n\nfor fact discovery and initial motions, and providing that “[i]f any claims remain after\n\nthis Court rules on the dispositive motions, the Court will schedule an additional period\n\nof expert discovery in preparation for trial”)), and in complex medical product liability\n\ncases such as this one, expert testimony regarding causation is ordinarily indispensable\n\nunder District of Columbia law. See, e.g., Otis Elevator Co. v. Tuerr, 616 A.2d 1254,\n\n1260 (D.C. 1992) (noting the necessity of expert testimony “when recovery is sought\n\nfor permanent injuries or where there are complicated medical questions related to\n\ncausation of such injuries”) (citations omitted); see also Baltimore v. B.F. Goodrich\n\nCo., 545 A.2d 1228, 1231 (D.C. 1988) (explaining that expert testimony is necessary to\n\nestablish causation in cases involving “medically complicated” claims with “multiple\n\nand/or preexisting causes”) (citations omitted).\n\n\n\n                                            33\n\f       As detailed below, the Court is permitting certain claims against Medtronic to\n\nproceed (see infra Part VII.B, VII.C)), and therefore, the Court will issue a separate\n\norder that requires the parties to submit a joint proposed schedule for a period of expert\n\ndiscovery to commence forthwith. Once this expert discovery period has concluded, the\n\nCourt will permit Medtronic to renew and supplement its request for summary judgment\n\non the issue of causation.\n\n\nVI.    RULING ON TIMELINESS\n\n       Turning to another major argument that Medtronic and Unomedical raise in the\n\ncontext of their motions for summary judgment—timeliness—the Court notes that the\n\nparties do not dispute that Plaintiffs’ product-liability claims for negligence, strict\n\nliability, and failure to warn are subject to the three-year statute of limitations laid out\n\nin D.C. Code § 12-301. (See Medtronic’s Mem. at 55; Unomedical’s Mem. at 25; Pls.’\n\nOpp’n at 63.) See also D.C. Code § 12-301(8) (actions “for which a limitation is not\n\notherwise specially prescribed” must be brought within three years “from the time the\n\nright to maintain the action accrues”). And the parties also appear to agree that the\n\nKubickis’ claims as they relate to the MMT-522 Pump are timely. (See Medtronic’s\n\nMem. at 55.) The statute of limitations dispute is over whether the tort claims that\n\npertain to the MMT-396 Infusion Set—which were first introduced into this litigation\n\non November 19, 2013, six years after Caroline’s injury—are time-barred. (See id. at\n\n55–62; Unomedical’s Mem. at 25–34; Pls.’ Opp’n. at 63–76; Pls.’ Mot. for Leave to\n\nFile the First Am. Compl., ECF No. 38.) For the reasons explained below, this Court\n\nfinds that the infusion set-related tort claims that the Kubickis have brought against\n\nUnomedical are not timely, because such claims could have (and should have) been\n\n\n\n                                             34\n\fdiscovered shortly after Caroline’s injury in 2007, and Unomedical had no notice of the\n\ninfusion set claims against it until the Kubickis filed an amended complaint, six years\n\nafter the injury occurred. However, the infusion set-related tort claims against\n\nMedtronic are not time-barred, because these otherwise untimely claims concerning the\n\nMMT-396 Infusion Set relate back to the timely claims that the Kubickis had filed\n\nagainst Medtronic concerning the MMT-522 Pump.\n\n       A.     The Law Pertaining To Timeliness: Statutes Of Limitations,\n              The Discovery Rule, And The Relation Back Doctrine\n\n       A statute of limitations is the legislatively prescribed time period (usually a\n\nperiod of years) within which an authorized legal claim must be filed. See Statute of\n\nLimitations, Black’s Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (defining statute of limitations);\n\nsee also Rudder v. Williams, 47 F. Supp. 3d 47, 52 (D.D.C. 2014) (“‘Statutes of\n\nlimitations . . . represent a pervasive legislative judgment that it is unjust to fail to put\n\nthe adversary on notice to defend within a specified period of time and that the right to\n\nbe free of stale claims in time comes to prevail over the right to prosecute them.’”\n\n(quoting United States v. Kubrick, 444 U.S. 111, 117 (1979) (alteration in original))).\n\nClaims that are brought beyond the statutory time period are ordinarily barred. See\n\nUntalasco v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 249 F. Supp. 3d 318, 323 (D.D.C. 2017) (“[T]he\n\ngeneral rule that one can glean from [precedent] is that courts should apply the [District\n\nof Columbia] statute of limitations strictly, even though barring actions often seems\n\narbitrary and inequitable.” (internal quotation marks, citation, and emphasis omitted)).\n\nHowever, when a plaintiff files a timely legal action regarding an injury, and then later\n\nseeks to assert a potentially out-of-time claim in the context of an amended complaint,\n\ntwo independent and alternative concepts can apply to permit such an amendment: “the\n\n\n\n                                              35\n\fdiscovery rule” (which considers when the plaintiff knew or should have known of the\n\npotential claim), see Bussineau v. President & Directors of Georgetown Coll., 518 A.2d\n\n423, 425 (D.C. 1986), and “the relation back doctrine” (which considers the connection\n\nbetween the old claim and the new one to determine whether the defendant knew or\n\nshould have known of the claim), see Meijer, Inc. v. Biovail Corp., 533 F.3d 857, 866\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2008). The contours of each of these doctrines is laid out below.\n\n              1.     The Discovery Rule\n\n       The discovery rule alters the typical understanding of when the statute of\n\nlimitations starts to run, (i.e., when it “accrues.”) It is well established that, “[w]here\n\nthe fact of an injury can be readily determined, a claim accrues for purposes of the\n\nstatute of limitations at the time the injury actually occurs.” Colbert v. Georgetown\n\nUniv., 641 A.2d 469, 472 (D.C. 1994) (citations omitted). But, if the injury is not\n\napparent, and/or if the causal link between tortious conduct and injury is not\n\nimmediately clear, District of Columbia courts apply the “discovery rule[,]” which\n\nholds that the statute of limitations begins to run not on the date that the injury\n\nhappened, but “‘when the plaintiff has knowledge of (or by the exercise of reasonable\n\ndiligence should have knowledge of) (1) the existence of the injury, (2) its cause in fact,\n\nand (3) some evidence of wrongdoing.’” Lee v. Wolfson, 265 F. Supp. 2d 14, 17\n\n(D.D.C. 2003) (quoting Bussineau, 518 A.2d at 425); see also Colbert, 641 A.2d at 473\n\n(holding that plaintiff’s claim for medical malpractice did not accrue until she\n\n“discovered or reasonably should have discovered all of the essential elements of her\n\npossible cause of actions”) (quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n       The District of Columbia Court of Appeals has made clear that, per the discovery\n\nrule, “the statute of limitation[s] for negligence begins to run at such time a prospective\n\n\n                                             36\n\fplaintiff gains inquiry notice that wrongdoing may be involved.” Bussineau, 518 A.2d\n\nat 427–28. This means that what a plaintiff knows, or should have known, about the\n\ndefendant’s potential fault is key. Id. Nevertheless, the statute of limitations will be\n\ndeemed to run even if the plaintiff does not fully comprehend the extent to which a\n\npotential defendant may have caused the injury. See Baker v. A.H. Robins Co., 613 F.\n\nSupp. 994, 996 (D.D.C. 1985). Furthermore, a plaintiff who has suffered an injury must\n\nact reasonably and diligently to investigate the possibility of a claim, and a litigant is\n\ndeemed to have inquiry notice of a claim that he should have discovered by exercising\n\nthis reasonable diligence. See id. at 996; see also Reeves v. Eli Lilly & Co., 368 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 11, 21 (D.D.C. 2005) (emphasizing that the reasonableness of an investigation\n\nis evaluated under an objective standard). Put another way:\n\n              In every case, the plaintiff has a duty to investigate matters\n              affecting her affairs with reasonable diligence under all of the\n              circumstances. Once the plaintiff actually knows, or with the\n              exercise of reasonable diligence would have known, of some\n              injury, its cause-in-fact, and some evidence of wrongdoing,\n              then she is bound to file her cause of action within the\n              applicable limitations period, measured from the date of her\n              acquisition of the actual or imputed knowledge.\n\nDiamond v. Davis, 680 A.2d 364, 381 (D.C. 1996). In the context of the discovery rule,\n\nit is the defendant’s burden to show that the plaintiff has not acted with reasonable\n\ndiligence. See Smith v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 108 F. Supp. 2d 12, 17\n\n(D.D.C. 2000).\n\n              2.     The Relation Back Doctrine\n\n       Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c) “governs when an amended pleading\n\n‘relates back’ to the date of a timely filed original pleading and is thus itself timely\n\neven though it was filed outside an applicable statute of limitations.” Krupski v. Costa\n\n\n\n                                             37\n\fCrociere S. p. A., 560 U.S. 538, 541 (2010). Rule 15(c) addresses three instances where\n\nrelation back is appropriate; Plaintiffs here rely on the second of the three: where “the\n\namendment asserts a claim or defense that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or\n\noccurrence set out—or attempted to be set out—in the original pleading.” Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 15(c)(1)(B). (See Pls.’ Opp’n at 74 (“The allegations concerning the Infusion Set\n\n‘arise out of the same conduct’ alleged in the original complaint and Plaintiffs have not\n\nintroduced any new legal theories since their original complaint.” (quoting Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 15(c)(1)(B))).)\n\n       Significantly for present purposes, the relation-back doctrine and the discovery\n\nrule both generally pertain to knowledge of the claim; however, these doctrines address\n\ndifferent parties. The discovery rule focuses on the knowledge of the plaintiff, while\n\nthe relation back doctrine focuses on whether a defendant has had fair notice of the\n\nplaintiff’s claim. Compare Lee, 265 F. Supp. 2d at 17 (holding that the statute of\n\nlimitations begins to run under the discovery rule when a plaintiff knows, or should\n\nknow, of an injury, its causation, and some wrongdoing on the part of the defendant)\n\nwith Meijer, Inc., 533 F.3d at 866 (“The underlying question is whether the original\n\ncomplaint adequately notified the defendants of the basis for liability the plaintiffs\n\nwould later advance in the amended complaint.”); Hartley v. Wilfert, 931 F. Supp. 2d\n\n230, 233 (D.D.C. 2013) (explaining that, for purposes of the relation back doctrine,\n\n“notice to the defendant is relevant to the inquiry”); see also, e.g., Dover v. Medstar\n\nWash. Hosp. Ctr., 989 F. Supp. 2d 57, 59, 61–62 (D.D.C. 2013) (holding that claims for\n\nviolations of D.C.’s overtime statute did not relate back to timely claims for intentional\n\ninterference with prospective advantage and economic expectancy, intentional\n\n\n\n\n                                            38\n\fmisrepresentation, and defamation because of defendants’ lack of notice of the alleged\n\nwage payment violations). Ultimately, “[s]o long as the original and amended\n\n[complaints] state claims that are tied to a common core of operative facts, relation\n\nback will be in order.” Mayle v. Felix, 545 U.S. 644, 664 (2005).\n\n\n      B.     Plaintiffs Could Have Discovered Their Claims Against\n             Unomedical Regarding The MMT-396 Infusion Set Near The\n             Time Of Caroline’s Injury; Therefore, The Infusion Set Claims\n             That Plaintiffs Belatedly Asserted Against Unomedical Are\n             Untimely\n\n      Plaintiffs first named Unomedical as a defendant, and made associated claims\n\narising from Unomedical’s manufacture of the MMT-396 Infusion Set, on January 10,\n\n2014—more than six years after Caroline’s hypoglycemic event. (See Am. Compl.) In\n\nresponse to the timeliness objection that both Medtronic and Unomedical raise in their\n\nsummary judgment motions, Plaintiffs insist that their newly-asserted infusion set\n\nclaims are not time-barred, because Plaintiffs “could not have conceivably connected\n\nCaroline Kubicki’s severe hypoglycemic injury” to a defect or malfunction in the\n\nMMT-396 Infusion Set prior to June 2013 Paradigm Infusion Set recall. (Pls.’ Opp’n at\n\n65; see also id. at 66 (“[T]he public was not made aware of the role of the Infusion Set\n\nin the over-delivery of insulin until June 7, 2013, when the Class I recall concerning the\n\ntemporary vent block condition was issued.” (citation omitted)).) This Court rejects the\n\nKubickis’ contention that their product-liability claims arising from the MMT-396\n\nInfusion Set accrued only as of June 2013, and that prior to that date they could not\n\npossibly have discovered that the infusion set—and its manufacturer, Unomedical—\n\nmight have been the cause of Caroline’s injuries, for the following reasons.\n\n\n\n\n                                           39\n\f              1.     Caroline’s Insulin-Delivery Device Is A Multifaceted\n                     Medical Product, And The Manufacturers Of The Various\n                     Components Are Clearly Identified\n\n       First of all, as explained in Part II.B, supra, a mechanical insulin-delivery pump\n\nis a complex medical device that has many intricate parts, even to the lay observer. In\n\nthe wake of Caroline’s injury, basic due diligence in evaluating the suspected source of\n\nthe alleged insulin overdose would have led a reasonable plaintiff to discover relatively\n\nquickly that Caroline’s insulin-delivery device has various components; moreover, a\n\nreasonable plaintiff certainly would have surmised that any one of the device’s various\n\ncomponents could have been responsible for Caroline’s injury. Indeed, the record\n\nestablishes that the Kubickis understood at the time of Caroline’s injury that the MMT-\n\n522 Pump and the MMT-396 Infusion Set worked together to provide insulin to\n\nCaroline (see J. Kubicki Dep. at 85:3-9; K. Kubicki Dep. at 324:3-16), which makes it\n\nall the more unreasonable for Plaintiffs to have filed an initial complaint that only\n\ncontained claims related to an alleged defect in one component of Caroline’s insulin-\n\ndelivery device (the MMT-522 Pump).\n\n       The fact that Karen Kubicki may have subjectively believed that the potentially\n\ndefective insulin-delivery product was a unitary object (see K. Kubicki Dep. at 324:3–\n\n16 (asserting that she considered the pump and infusion set as “one [and] the same”)) is\n\nof no moment. As explained, the applicable standard of knowledge for the purposes of\n\nthe discovery rule is an objective one, see Baker, 613 F. Supp. at 996, and given the\n\ntotality of the facts and circumstances here, (including those that would have been\n\nuncovered by a diligent investigation), it is clear to this Court that an objectively\n\nreasonable plaintiff would have readily discovered that the pump and the infusion set\n\nwere distinct components of the Caroline’s insulin-delivery device, especially after one\n\n\n                                             40\n\fof Caroline’s physicians specifically expressed to the Kubickis a concern about the fact\n\nthat Caroline’s MMT-396 Infusion Set had been discarded after the injury. (See K.\n\nKubicki Dep. at 322:6-7 (acknowledging that the doctor had told them “you would want\n\neverything that [Caroline] was using” in trying to figure out what happened); see also\n\nid. at 322:14–23, 324:3–16.) And even without such pointed statements from persons\n\nwith knowledge of the device in question, a reasonable plaintiff would have at least\n\nconsulted the packaging materials that accompanied the seemingly defective medical\n\ndevice, and thereby would have discovered that the infusion set tubing that delivers\n\ninsulin to the body was packaged separately from the potentially defective mechanical\n\npump—another indisputable marker of a separate piece of medical equipment.\n\n       Plaintiffs’ contention that, as laypeople, they could not possibly have known that\n\na defect in the p-cap valve of the MMT-396 Infusion Set caused Caroline’s injury\n\nbefore the recall in June of 2013 (see Pls.’ Opp’n at 66) misses the mark entirely,\n\ninsofar as it suggests that the statute of limitations does not accrue on a products-\n\nliability claim until the plaintiff has sufficient information to make specific allegations\n\nwith respect to causation. Quite to the contrary, it is well established that, while a\n\nplaintiff must have “knowledge of wrongdoing to commence the statute of\n\nlimitation[s,]” Bussineau, 518 A.2d at 432 n.11, he need not “have certain knowledge of\n\ncausation[,]” Dawson, 543 F. Supp. at 1334. Thus, it was sufficient that the Kubickis\n\nsuspected wrongdoing related to the mechanism by which insulin went from the MMT-\n\n522 Pump’s reservoir, through the infusion set, and into Caroline’s body—even if they\n\ndid not understand the precise failure mode—and they had developed this suspicion by\n\nat least the year 2010. This Court has no doubt that, under such circumstances, a\n\n\n\n\n                                             41\n\freasonable plaintiff would have discovered, and presumably raised, tort claims that\n\npertain to all of the components of that allegedly faulty insulin-delivery system.\n\n        In this case, there is an additional wrinkle: the Kubickis’ unreasonable failure to\n\nassert timely product-liability tort claims relating to a key component of Caroline’s\n\ninsulin-delivery device also means they failed to identify Unomedical, and to include\n\nthat company as a defendant in this action in a timely fashion. Again, while Karen\n\nKubicki may not have actually known that there was another company involved in the\n\nmanufacture of the medical device that she suspected caused Caroline’s injury (see Pls.’\n\nOpp’n at 68 (referencing Karen Kubicki’s statement that she “did not know who made\n\nthe Infusion Set and only thought that Medtronic was involved”)), and in this Court’s\n\nview, an objectively reasonable plaintiff would easily have discovered at the time of\n\nCaroline’s injury that a potential tort claim arising from the MMT-396 Infusion Set\n\nexisted and was assertable against that product’s manufacturer. What is more, the\n\nproduct packaging and instructions related to the MMT-396 Infusion Set clearly state\n\nthat the MMT-396 Infusion Set was “Assembled in Mexico for Unomedical A/S”\n\n(Packaging Photos; Infusion Set Instructions), and Unomedical’s name also appears on\n\nthe MMT-396 Infusion Set itself (Mot. Hr’g Tr. 73:19–74:6.), which makes the\n\nKubickis’ failure to conduct even the most minimal investigation all the more obvious\n\nhere.\n\n        In any event, there is no question that the Kubickis had an obligation to conduct\n\nan investigation into all of the potential sources of the product that they suspected was\n\nthe cause of Caroline’s injury. They were certainly aware that someone had\n\nmanufactured all of the components of the device in question; thus, they were on\n\n\n\n\n                                             42\n\f“inquiry” notice that medical-device manufacturers had a role in making Caroline’s\n\ninfusion set, and should have looked into whether any companies other than Medtronic\n\nwere involved. See Berkow v. Lucy Webb Hayes Nat’l Training Sch. for Deaconesses &\n\nMissionaries Conducting Sibley Mem’l Hosp., 841 A.2d 776, 781 (D.C. 2004) (noting\n\nthat “a plaintiff’s knowledge of one defendant’s misconduct will ‘create inquiry notice\n\nof claims against a potential co-defendant . . . if (1) a reasonable plaintiff would have\n\nconducted an investigation as to the co-defendant, and (2) such an investigation would\n\nhave revealed some evidence of wrongdoing[,]’” and holding that plaintiff’s knowledge\n\nof one doctor’s misdiagnosis of him placed him on inquiry notice of claims against\n\nother doctors who allegedly contributed to the misdiagnosis (quoting Cevenini v.\n\nArchbishop of Wash., 707 A.2d 768, 773 (D.C. 1998) (alteration in original))).\n\n       This all means that nothing about the circumstances here persuades this Court\n\nthat it was reasonable for the Kubickis to forego an investigation of all of the potential\n\nproducers of the various parts of Caroline’s insulin-delivery device when they\n\nundertook to bring a timely products-liability lawsuit in 2010. It is undisputed that the\n\nMMT-396 Infusion Set works together with the MMT-522 Pump, and even setting aside\n\nthe obvious indications on the packaging materials and the device itself that a company\n\nother than Medtronic was involved with the manufacture of that component, a\n\nreasonable plaintiff would have investigated the origins of the device in question, and\n\nsuch investigation would have revealed that Unomedical had a sufficient connection to\n\nthe manufacturing of the MMT-396 Infusion Set to warrant naming Unomedical as a co-\n\ndefendant in the 2010 complaint. See also 21 C.F.R. § 803.3(1) (FDA regulations\n\ndefining manufacturer as “any person who manufactures, prepares, propagates,\n\n\n\n\n                                            43\n\fcompounds, assembles, or processes a [medical] device”). In other words, although the\n\nKubickis were intent upon suing Medtronic based on their concerns about the operation\n\nof the insulin pump, the company that the manufactured the infusion set—a component\n\nof Medtronic’s insulin-delivery device—was readily ascertainable by the public at the\n\ntime of Caroline’s injury, and should have been known to Plaintiffs as well, long before\n\nto the 2013 Recall.\n\n              2.      Plaintiffs Rely On Dissimilar Cases To Support Their\n                      Contention That Their Infusion Set Claims Accrued In 2013\n\n       The functional connection between the MMT-522 Pump and the MMT-396\n\nInfusion Set, and the fact that the Kubickis suspected a defect in Caroline’s insulin-\n\ndelivery system immediately but chose to file a timely action against only one of the\n\ncompanies involved in the manufacture of the components of that system, differentiates\n\nthis case from Lee v. Wolfson, 265 F. Supp. 2d 14 (D.D.C. 2003), on which Plaintiffs\n\nrely. The plaintiff in Lee sued for damages as a result of injuries that she suffered when\n\nan unattended vehicle in a parking garage struck her. Notably, after testing showed no\n\nissues with the parking break mechanism, Lee’s complaint alleged that the cause of her\n\ninjury was human error in either failing to set the parking brake or inadvertently\n\nreleasing it, id. at 16, and consistent with this theory, Lee initially named the owner of\n\nthe rolling car and the parking garage as defendants, id. The National Highway Traffic\n\nSafety Administration subsequently issued a recall to correct a defect in the parking\n\nbrake design, which prompted Lee to seek to amend her complaint to add the car’s\n\nmanufacturer, id. at 16–17, and the Court authorized the amendment as timely. In\n\nfinding that Lee’s claims against the manufacturer did not accrue until the recall notice\n\nissued, the Lee court held that “plaintiff here cannot automatically be expected to know\n\n\n\n                                            44\n\fthat wrongful conduct on the part of [the manufacturer] might have caused the release\n\nof the [rolling car’s] parking brake at the time of her injury, particularly when no defect\n\nin the parking brake was revealed during the investigation of the accident by the police\n\nor plaintiff’s expert.” Id. at 18.\n\n       Here, by contrast, the Kubickis’ initial claim of wrongdoing concerned an\n\nalleged product-related defect pertaining to the insulin-infusion system that Caroline\n\nused (otherwise they could not have in good faith sued Medtronic). And having\n\nsuspected a problem with that system, it was incumbent upon the Kubickis to conduct a\n\nreasonable inquiry into all of the possible components of that system in a timely\n\nfashion. See Diamond, 680 A.2d at 381; see also Colbert, 641 A.2d at 472–73 (holding\n\nthat “[w]here the fact of an injury can be readily determined, a claim accrues for\n\npurposes of the statute of limitations at the time the injury actually occurs[,]” but\n\n“[w]here the relationship between the fact of injury and the alleged tortious conduct\n\nmay be obscure,” the claim accrues when the plaintiff “knew or should have known that\n\nshe had suffered injury as a result of the defendants’ negligence”). In other words, the\n\ninstant case is substantially different from Lee, because while the plaintiff in Lee lacked\n\nfair notice of any wrongdoing with respect to the parking brake system of the car that\n\nhad injured her and was instead proceeding on a human-error tort theory, the Kubickis\n\nsuspected a product defect from the outset, and therefore, had the obligation to examine\n\ntimely all of the aspects of the allegedly defective product for statute of limitations\n\npurposes.\n\n       A more analogous case is Colarossi v. Schmid Laboratories, Inc., 830 F. Supp.\n\n230 (D.N.J. 1993), in which the court found that a claim against a manufacturer of\n\n\n\n\n                                             45\n\fintrauterine devices (“IUDs”) was untimely under District of Columbia law. The\n\nplaintiff in Colarossi learned from her doctor in 1978 that her IUD might have caused\n\nan infection that led to permanent injuries. Id. at 237. The court found that her claim\n\naccrued at that point in time, noting that “[f]aced with permanent injury and [a]\n\nstatement by her doctor that her IUD may have been the cause, wrongdoing by someone\n\nwas more than a hypothetical possibility and the wrongdoing element was met.” Id.\n\n(alterations, internal quotation marks, and citation omitted); see also id. at 236 (“The\n\nwrongdoing element does not, however, require that the plaintiff know the identity of\n\nthe party responsible for the injury.”). In the alternative, the court found that the claim\n\naccrued no later than 1986, which was when the plaintiff learned of, and participated in,\n\nlitigation related to Dalkon Shield IUDs. Id. at 237. Notably, the Colarossi plaintiff\n\nmade a critical mistake in connection with that litigation: she failed to review her own\n\nmedical records to determine the specific manufacturer of the IUD that she had used,\n\nand as a result, she only sued the manufacturer of Dalkon Shield IUDs, not the\n\nmanufacturer of the brand of IUD that was identified in her medical records. Id. When\n\nthe plaintiff later learned of her error and tried to sue the correct manufacturer, the\n\ncourt pegged 1986 as the latest possible accrual date because, at that point, “not only\n\nwas [the plaintiff] aware of the possibility of wrongdoing, she took affirmative action to\n\nobtain legal redress.” Id.; see also id. (faulting plaintiff for failing to exercise due\n\ndiligence because she failed to examine her medical records before initiating suit).\n\n       So it is here. The Kubickis knew of potential wrongdoing on the part of the\n\nmanufacturers of Caroline’s insulin-deilvery system in 2007, when Caroline suffered\n\nher injury and when her treating physician advised them that Caroline’s insulin-delivery\n\n\n\n\n                                             46\n\fsystem (consisting of the MMT-522 pump and MMT-396 Infusion Set) could be the\n\ncause. (See J. Kubicki Dep. at 23:25–25:13.) And even if it was reasonable for the\n\nKubickis to fail to make a connection between the insulin-deilvery system and potential\n\nwrongdoing in 2007, they undeniably had made that connection by the time they filed a\n\nlawsuit against Medtronic in 2010, which means that, at the very latest, their product-\n\nliability claims accrued in 2010 (see Brown Decl. ¶ 3), four years before they undertook\n\nto litigate tort claims specifically pertaining to the MMT-396 Infusion Set.\n\n       The 2009 Lot 8 recall—through which Medtronic recalled certain MMT-396\n\nInfusion Sets from a particular manufacturing lot but provided public assurances that all\n\nother lots were safe and effective (see 2009 Recall Notice, Ex. 18 to Pls.’ Opp’n, ECF\n\nNo. 138-28, at 1)—has no bearing on the aforementioned analysis of the accrual of the\n\nKubickis’ claims. Plaintiffs assert that Medtronic’s safety assurances with respect to\n\nnon-Lot 8 infusion sets “led Plaintiffs to not consider the MMT-396 Infusion Set as a\n\npotential cause in fact.” (Pls.’ Opp’n at 70.) But, if anything, the 2009 recall notice\n\nwould have spurred a reasonable plaintiff to inquire further regarding this component of\n\nthe Caroline’s insulin-deilvery system, because in the context of the Lot 8 recall,\n\nMedtronic expressly identified a particular fault mechanism in the MMT-396 Infusion\n\nSet that could result in the over-delivery of insulin, i.e., the blocking of air vents in the\n\ntubing connector. (See Questions & Answers Regarding the “Lot 8” Quick-set Infusion\n\nSet Recall, Ex. 27 to Pls.’ Opp’n, ECF No. 138-29, at 3; see also 2009 Recall Notice at\n\n1 (explaining, specifically, that Lot 8 MMT-396 Infusion Sets potentially had a\n\nmanufacturing defect that “may not allow the insulin pump to vent air pressure properly\n\n\n\n\n                                             47\n\f[which] could potentially result in the device delivering too much or too little insulin\n\nand may cause serious injury or death.”)\n\n        Thus, armed with the general knowledge that blockage of the infusion set air\n\nvents could lead to an over-delivery of insulin, and believing that Caroline was injured\n\nas the result of an over-delivery of insulin, an objectively reasonable plaintiff would by\n\nno means have felt “reassured” by Medtronic’s assertions; instead, she would have even\n\nmore vigorously investigated, and pursued, tort claims against any entity that had\n\nplayed a role in the manufacture of Caroline’s MMT-396 Infusion Set, including\n\nUnomedical. 17\n\n                3.       The Relation Back Doctrine Does Not Save The Infusion\n                         Set-Related Claims Against Unomedical\n\n        Plaintiffs have invoked the “relation back” doctrine to maintain that, even if this\n\nCourt concludes that the amended complaint’s claims related to the MMT-396 Infusion\n\nSet are untimely because those claims could have been discovered long before Plaintiffs\n\nfiled the amended complaint, the infusion set claims should nevertheless be deemed\n\ntimely. (See Pls.’ Opp’n at 74.) To support this argument, Plaintiffs cite to Federal\n\nRule of Civil Procedure 15(c)(1)(B), which provides that an amended pleading relates\n\nback to the date of the original pleading when “the amendment asserts a claim or\n\ndefense that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out—or attempted\n\n\n17\n   The holdings of the cases that Plaintiffs cite to support their contention that they “justifiably relied\non Defendants to provide information about the safety risks of their products[,]” (Pls.’ Opp’n at 70),\nare inapposite. The court in Diamond, for example, noted that it could take into account the existence\nof a “confidential or fiducial relationship between the plaintiff and defendant” in determining whether\nthe plaintiff rightfully relied on representations the defendant made. 680 A.2d at 381. No such\nfiduciary or confidential relationship exists in this case. Nor is this a circumstance where there is a\nlatent product defect that only becomes evident after the limitations period had run. See, e.g.,\nEhrenhaft v. Malcolm Price, Inc., 483 A.2d 1192, 1202 (D.C. 1984). Here, the injury itself was\nimmediately evident, and Plaintiffs unquestionably had knowledge of the insulin-deilvery system’s\npotential role in Caroline’s injury by at least 2010.\n\n\n\n                                                     48\n\fto be set out—in the original pleading[.]” Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(B). In this regard,\n\nPlaintiffs argue that “the Second Amended Complaint does not introduce any new legal\n\ntheories into this litigation, but instead only amplifies the original factual allegations to\n\ninclude the Infusion Set” (Pls.’ Opp’n at 75 (emphasis added) (internal citations and\n\nquotation marks omitted)). Be that as it may, this Court concludes that the infusion set-\n\nrelated claims against Unomedical cannot be considered to relate back to the original\n\ncomplaint for statute of limitations purposes, for the following reasons.\n\n       It is clear beyond cavil that relation back under Rule 15(c)(1)(B) is permissible\n\nonly if the defendant had “sufficient notice of the facts and claims giving rise to the\n\nproposed amendment” prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations. United States\n\nv. Hicks, 283 F.3d 380, 388 (D.C. Cir. 2002). Thus, the general rule is that “new\n\nparties, either plaintiffs or defendants, cannot be added to an action by amendment after\n\nthe applicable limitations period has expired[,]” 6A Charles A. Wright, et al., Federal\n\nPractice & Procedure § 1498 (3d ed. 2017), because a new defendant typically would\n\nnot be aware of the claims, having not been named in the original suit. Rule\n\n15(c)(1)(C) alters this general rule, but it allows the addition of a new party if Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 15(c)(1)(B) is satisfied and if the party to be added “(i) received such notice of\n\nthe action [within the time allotted for service of the original complaint] that it would\n\nnot be prejudiced in defending on the merits; and (ii) knew or should have known that\n\nthe action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper\n\nparty’s identity.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(C); see also Bayatfshar v. Aeronautical\n\nRadio, Inc., 934 F. Supp. 2d 138, 144 (D.D.C. 2013) (an amendment adding a new party\n\nrelates back to the prior complaint “‘when the requisite notice and identity of interests\n\n\n\n\n                                             49\n\fshowings’” that Rule 15(c)(1)(C) requires are made (quoting Stoppelman v. Owens, 580\n\nF. Supp. 944, 946 (D.D.C. 1983))).\n\n       Thus, “relation back under Rule 15(c)(1)(C) depends on what the party to be\n\nadded knew or should have known, not on the amending party’s knowledge or its\n\ntimeliness in seeking to amend the pleading.” Krupski, 560 U.S. at 541 (emphasis\n\nadded); see also Philogene v. Dist. of Columbia, 864 F. Supp. 2d 127, 133 (D.D.C.\n\n2012) (“This Circuit has explained that the purpose of [Rule 15(c)(1)(C)] is to ‘avoid\n\nthe harsh consequences of a mistake that is neither prejudicial nor a surprise to the\n\nmisnamed party.’” (quoting Rendall-Speranza v. Nassim, 107 F.3d 913, 918 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1997))); see, e.g., Placide Ayissi-Etoh v. Mae, 49 F. Supp. 3d 9, 13–14 (D.D.C. 2014)\n\n(holding that amendment adding individual capacity claims to employment\n\ndiscrimination suit did not relate back under Rule 15(c)(1)(C) to original complaint\n\nalleging corporate capacity claims where record “strongly support[ed] an inference that\n\nthe individual [d]efendants did not have notice” of potential for individual capacity\n\nclaims, such that the amendment “would be highly prejudicial”). Consequently, “[a]\n\npotential defendant who has not been named in a lawsuit by the time the statute of\n\nlimitations has run is entitled to repose—unless it is or should be apparent to that\n\nperson that he is the beneficiary of a mere slip of the pen, as it were.” Rendall-\n\nSperanza, 107 F.3d at 918.\n\n       The Kubickis here have presented no evidence that contradicts Unomedical’s\n\ncontention that it was not aware of this litigation until 2014. (See Decl. of Rabi\n\nGharabit, Ex. D to Unomedical’s Reply, ECF No. 142-5, ¶ 4.) Nor is this a\n\ncircumstance where the omission of Unomedical was due to clerical error or confusion\n\n\n\n\n                                            50\n\fabout closely-related corporate entities. Cf. Krupski, 560 U.S. at 554–55 (concluding\n\nthat the district court erred in denying relation back where the corporate defendant that\n\nplaintiff sought to add under Rule 15(c)(1)(C) was related to named defendant, had\n\n“constructive notice” of the original complaint within the Rule 4(m) period, and should\n\nhave known that it would have been named in the original complaint but for plaintiff’s\n\nmistake about which corporate entity was the proper defendant); Miller v. Holzmann,\n\nCivil Action No. 95-1231, 2007 WL 778599, at *2–3 (D.D.C. Mar. 6, 2007) (holding\n\nthat an amended complaint adding a new defendant related back to prior complaint\n\nwhere all defendants were closely-related members of the same corporate family and\n\nrepresented by the same counsel and the newly-named defendant should have known\n\nthat it was the intended defendant all along). Indeed, the Kubickis did not make any\n\nspecific product-defect allegations regarding the MMT-396 Infusion Set—the only\n\nportion of the insulin-delivery system to which Unomedical had any connection—until\n\n2014, and Unomedical therefore would have no reason to suspect before that time that it\n\ncould be subject to liability for Caroline’s injuries. This lack of notice undoubtedly\n\nforecloses the Kubicki’s reliance on the relation back doctrine to render timely their tort\n\nclaims against Unomedical. See, e.g., Meijer, Inc., 533 F.3d at 866.\n\n       C.     Plaintiffs’ Infusion Set Claims Against Medtronic Relate Back\n              To Their Preexisting MMT-522 Pump Claims Against That\n              Defendant, And Thus Are Deemed Timely\n\n       As a party to the original action, Medtronic stands in markedly different shoes\n\nthan Unomedical does, as far as the Kubicki’s infusion set claims are concerned. As\n\nexplained above, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c)(1)(B) specifically contemplates\n\nthe circumstances under which an amendment to a pleading “relates back to the date of\n\nthe original pleading” for the purpose of the statute of limitations, and unlike the\n\n\n                                            51\n\finfusion set claims against Unomedical (which had nothing to relate back to because\n\nUnomedical was not named in the original complaint), the relation-back question with\n\nrespect to the MMT-396 Infusion Set claims that Plaintiffs have belatedly brought\n\nagainst Medtronic is whether these claims “arose out of the conduct, transaction, or\n\noccurrence” laid out in Plaintiffs’ initial pleading, Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(B), such that\n\nMedtronic had “been put on notice regarding the claim . . . raised by the amended\n\npleading[,]” 6A Charles A. Wright, et al., Federal Practice & Procedure § 1497 (3d ed.\n\n2017).\n\n         Not surprisingly, Medtronic says ‘no’: it argues that the initial complaint\n\nprovided no notice of the potential infusion set claims, and that “[t]he addition of an\n\nentirely new device as a potential cause of Ms. Kubicki’s injuries is a ‘substantial’\n\nalteration to this case and provides Plaintiffs with an entirely new legal theory for why\n\nMs. Kubicki was injured.” (Medtronic’s Mem. at 62.) Elsewhere in its brief, however,\n\nMedtronic acknowledges that “the MMT-522-Pump and MMT-396 Infusion Set worked\n\ntogether to deliver insulin[,]” such that one component of the system would be useless\n\nfor insulin-delivery without the other. (Id. at 61.) In addition, Medtronic does not\n\ndispute the fact that both medical devices are sold under Medtronic’s name, and are\n\ncomponents of the same system that Medtronic markets for use to deliver insulin to\n\nconsumers. (See Product Photos, Ex. 61 to Pls.’ Opp’n, ECF 138-63, at 2; Infusion Set\n\nUser Guide, Ex F. to Decl. of Michael Wallace, ECF No. 133-4, at 12 (“The Quick-set\n\nis indicated for the subcutaneous infusion of medicine, including insulin, from a\n\nParadigm infusion pump and reservoir.”); Pump User Guide, Ex. 24 to Pl.’s Opp’n, ECF\n\n\n\n\n                                             52\n\fNo. 138-26, at 4 (instructing user to “insert the infusion set into your body as described\n\nin the next section.”).)\n\n       Thus, Medtronic’s insistence that it had no notice of any potential claims arising\n\nfrom the design or operation of Caroline’s infusion set is unpersuasive. The initial\n\ncomplaint clearly alleges that Caroline was injured when she received an overdose of\n\ninsulin as a result of being connected to the MMT-522 Pump. (See Compl. ¶¶ 14 (“A\n\nnumber of technical problems have been reported with the use of insulin pumps\n\nincluding, but not limited to, the pumps’ delivery of too much insulin resulting in\n\nhypoglycemia.”); 16 (“On or about September 9, 2007, Caroline Kubicki. . . was found\n\nto be unresponsive and unarousable by her roommate as a result of her malfunctioning\n\nMiniMed Insulin Pump.”); 72 (“If Caroline had known the true facts concerning the\n\nrisks of the use of the MiniMed Insulin Pump, in particular, the risk of significant\n\nhypoglycemic event with anoxic brain injury, she would not have used the product.”).)\n\nConsequently, Medtronic knew from the outset that the company was facing timely\n\nallegations of product-related deficiencies that had allegedly caused a serious injury,\n\nand the subsequent addition of even more specific allegations regarding another\n\ncomponent of the insulin-delivery device in question—the MMT-396 Infusion Set—\n\ndoes not give rise to “an entirely new legal theory[,]” as Medtronic argues.\n\n(Medtronic’s Mem. at 62.) Instead, it is reasonably clear that Plaintiffs’ amendment\n\nmerely refines the theory of liability that Plaintiffs had already pled in their timely\n\ncomplaint. See Hicks, 283 F.3d at 388 (concluding that, where an amended complaint\n\n“amplif[ies] the facts already alleged,” the amended complaint relates back to the initial\n\ncomplaint); Jones v. Ottenberg’s Bakers, Inc., No. 13-814, 2013 WL 6119322, *3\n\n\n\n\n                                             53\n\f(D.D.C. Nov. 21, 2013) (holding that an amended complaint relates back to the original\n\ncomplaint if the “amended complaint is logically related to, and seeks recovery for, the\n\nsame acts alleged in the initial complaint”).\n\n       In short, as explained above, the relation back doctrine deems timely an\n\notherwise untimely amendment to a complaint when the defendant had adequate notice\n\nof the claims that are subsequently added, and this Court is confident that such is the\n\ncase with respect to the Kubicki’s infusion set claims against Medtronic. Given the\n\nallegations of the original complaint and the interrelation between the pump and the\n\ninfusion set in delivering insulin to users, Medtronic knew or should have known from\n\nPlaintiffs’ initial allegations that infusion set claims existed and may yet be asserted,\n\nand Medtronic can hardly be heard to complain that it was not sufficiently alerted to a\n\npotential problem with MMT-396 Infusion Set and the p-cap valve in particular, when\n\nthese components play a crucial role in ensuring that the pump delivers insulin at the\n\ncorrect rate and when the Kubickis’ core allegation was over-delivery of insulin to a\n\npump-user. Therefore, although the claims in Plaintiffs’ complaint concerning the\n\nMMT-396 Infusion Set were not asserted timely in the first instance, this Court\n\nconcludes that these otherwise time-barred claims relate back to the timely claims\n\nregarding the MMT-522 Pump that Plaintiffs brought against Medtronic in the initial\n\ncomplaint, and as a result, these claims against Medtronic are deemed timely for statute\n\nof limitations purposes.\n\n\nVII.   RULING ON PREEMPTION\n\n       The thorniest legal issue that Medtronic raises as grounds for dismissal of the\n\nKubickis’ claims is preemption—a doctrine that has its roots in the Supremacy Clause\n\n\n\n                                             54\n\fof the U.S. Constitution. See Gade v. Nat’l Solid Wastes Mgmt. Ass’n, 505 U.S. 88, 108\n\n(1992) (“[U]nder the Supremacy Clause, from which our pre-emption doctrine is\n\nderived, any state law, however clearly within a State’s acknowledged power, which\n\ninterferes with or is contrary to federal law, must yield.” (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted)). As relevant here, Congress has vested the Food and Drug\n\nAdministration (“FDA”) with the authority to regulate medical devices; consequently,\n\nstate law legal claims that pertain to such devices implicate questions of both express\n\npreemption and implied preemption. As a general matter, express preemption occurs\n\nwhen a federal statute explicitly sets forth the particular circumstances in which state\n\nlaw claims cannot be maintained. See Waterview Mgmt. Co. v. FDIC, 105 F.3d 696,\n\n700 (D.C. Cir. 1997). By contrast, as relevant here, “[i]mplied preemption occurs . . .\n\nwhere the scheme of federal regulation is sufficiently comprehensive to make\n\nreasonable the inference that Congress left no room for supplementary state\n\nregulation[,]” Armstrong v. Accrediting Council for Continuing Edu. & Training, 168\n\nF.3d 1362, 1369 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), which\n\nrenders state law claims that seek merely to enforce federal duties effectively barred.\n\nSee Buckman, 531 U.S. at 352.\n\n       Medtronic argues that Section 360k(a) of the Medical Device Amendments to the\n\nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) expressly preempts the Kubickis’ MMT-522\n\nPump claims, and furthermore, that the claims in the Kubickis’ complaint pertaining to\n\nboth components of Medtronic’s insulin-deilvery system (the pump and the MMT-396\n\nInfusion Set) are impliedly preempted because the Kubickis are seeking to enforce FDA\n\nregulations rather than attempting to vindicate independent state law duties. (See\n\n\n\n\n                                            55\n\fMedtronic’s Mem. at 44–55.) The Kubickis have myriad responses to Medtronic’s\n\npreemption contentions (see Pls.’ Opp’n at 36–53), including the argument that there is\n\nno express preemption of their MMT-522 Pump claims because the state laws on which\n\nthe claims are based track the federal requirements (see id. at 38–40), and the implied\n\npreemption doctrine is inapplicable because the complaint asserts stand-alone state law\n\nclaims that do not usurp the FDA’s enforcement authority (see id. at 51–53).\n\n       The parties’ arguments are largely based on established law concerning the\n\nexpress and implied preemption of state law claims involving medical devices—law\n\nthat is “charitably speaking, utterly conflicted[,]” In re Medtronic, Inc. Sprint Fidelis\n\nLeads Prod. Liab. Litig., 592 F. Supp. 2d 1147, 1150 (D. Minn. 2009)—and as\n\nexplained below, the parties’ various contentions yield mixed results. In sum, this\n\nCourt concludes that all of the claims pertaining to the MMT-522 Pump are expressly\n\npreempted, with the exception of one narrow aspect of the claim alleging a pump-\n\nrelated manufacturing defect, and that none of the claims pertaining to the MMT-396\n\nInfusion Set are impliedly preempted, except for one claim that pertains to Medtronic’s\n\nallegedly tortious failure to report adverse events to the FDA. What remains, then, is a\n\nsingle manufacturing defect claim concerning the MMT-522 Pump, as well as almost all\n\nof the claims against Medtronic that pertain to the MMT-396 Infusion Set; these will be\n\nthe claims at issue during the forthcoming period of expert discovery.\n\n\n\n\n                                            56\n\f       A.      The Law Pertaining To Classification Of Medical Devices And\n               The Express And Implied Preemption Of State Law Claims\n               Under The Medical Device Amendments To The Food, Drug\n               And Cosmetics Act\n\n               1.      The MDA’s Device-Classification Scheme\n\n       In 1976, Congress responded to “a bevy of state laws regulating medical devices\n\nlargely enacted due to the failure of the Dalkon Shield contraceptive in the 1970s,” id.\n\nat 1150, by enacting the Medical Device Amendment (“MDA”) to the Federal Food,\n\nDrug and Cosmetics Act (“FDCA”), 21 U.S.C. §§ 301–399h. In essence, the MDA\n\nexpanded the regulatory scope of the FDCA to include medical devices. See In re\n\nMedtronic, 592 F. Supp. 2d at 1150–51 (citing 21 U.S.C. § 360k). As amended, the\n\nFDCA “classifies medical devices in three categories based on the risk that they pose to\n\nthe public[,]” Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U.S. 470, 476 (1996), with Class III being\n\nreserved for those devices that pose the most significant risk of illness or injury to\n\nusers. 18 “The [MDA] makes Class III the default category for new (that is, post–1976)\n\nmedical devices,” Ivy Sports Med., LLC v. Burwell, 767 F.3d 81, 83 (D.C. Cir. 2014),\n\nand it requires that such devices be subjected to a rigorous and time-consuming\n\npremarket approval (“PMA”) process, during which a manufacturer must prove to the\n\nFDA that the device is both safe and effective, see Lohr, 518 U.S. at 477; see also\n\nRiegel v. Medtronic, Inc., 552 U.S. 312, 317 (2008) (noting that the PMA process\n\n\n\n18\n   Class I devices “present no unreasonable risk of illness or injury . . . and are subject only to\nminimal regulation by ‘general controls.’” Lohr, 518 U.S. at 477 (quoting 21 U.S.C. § 360c(a)(1)(A)).\nClass II devices are “potentially more harmful[,]” and are subject to federal performance regulations\nknown as “‘special controls[,]’” though the FDA need not approve the marketing of Class II devices in\nadvance. Id. (quoting 21 U.S.C. § 360c(a)(1)(B)). Class III devices are those that either “presen[t] a\npotential unreasonable risk of illness or injury,” or are “purported or represented to be for a use in\nsupporting or sustaining human life or for a use which is of substantial importance in preventing\nimpairment of human health[.]” Id. at 477 (quoting 21 U.S.C. § 360c(a)(1)(C)) (quotation marks\nomitted).\n\n\n                                                  57\n\ftypically requires a manufacturer to submit a multi-volume application). When it\n\nanalyzes the device-related application that manufacturers submit, “the FDA must\n\nweigh the ‘probable benefit to health from the use of the device against any probable\n\nrisk of injury or illness from such use.’” In re Medtronic, 592 F. Supp. 2d at 1150\n\n(quoting 21 U.S.C. § 360c(a)(2)(C)). And pursuant to this calculus, the FDA “may thus\n\napprove devices that present great risks if they nonetheless offer great benefits in light\n\nof available alternatives.” Riegel, 552 U.S. at 318.\n\n       Notably, once the FDA has granted premarket approval to a device, the\n\nmanufacturer generally may not make changes to the design, labeling, manufacturing\n\nprocess, or any other aspect of the device without further FDA approval. See id. at 319;\n\nsee also id. at 323 (“[T]he FDA requires a device that has received premarket approval\n\nto be made with almost no deviations from the specifications in its approval application,\n\nfor the reason that the FDA has determined that the approved form provides a\n\nreasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.”). “If the applicant wishes to make\n\nsuch a change, it must submit, and the FDA must approve, an application for\n\nsupplemental premarket approval, to be evaluated under largely the same criteria as an\n\ninitial application.” Id. (citing § 360e(d)(6), 21 C.F.R. § 814.39(c)). Furthermore, a\n\nPMA device manufacturer also has certain post-approval reporting duties, including the\n\nobligation to report to the FDA all known incidents in which the device “(1) [m]ay have\n\ncaused or contributed to death or serious injury, or (2) [may have] malfunctioned and\n\n. . . would be likely to cause or contribute to death or serious injury, if the malfunction\n\nwere to recur[.]” 21 CFR § 803.50(a). Such reporting must take place within 30 days of\n\n\n\n\n                                             58\n\fwhen the manufacturer “receive[s] or otherwise become[s] aware of [the] information.”\n\nId.\n\n       In recognition of the fact that the lengthy PMA process can substantially delay\n\nthe introduction of improvements to existing medical devices, “the [MDA] . . . permits\n\ndevices that are ‘substantially equivalent’ to pre-existing devices to avoid the PMA\n\nprocess.” Lohr, 518 U.S. at 478 (quoting 21 U.S.C. § 360e(b)(1)(B)). To be\n\nsubstantially equivalent to a pre-existing Class I, II, or III medical device, “the new\n\ndevice must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either (i) have the\n\nsame technological characteristics as the predicate device or (ii) be shown to be as safe\n\nand effective as the predicate devices.” Ivy Sports, 767 F.3d at 83 (quoting 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 360c(i)(1)(A) (internal quotation marks omitted). The FDA has a process for\n\nconducting a substantial equivalence review—known as the “§ 510(k) process”—which\n\nis triggered when a manufacturer who intends to introduce a new medical device into\n\nthe market submits to the FDA a “premarket notification” that “states the new device’s\n\nintended use, identifies the predicate devices to which the new device is substantially\n\nequivalent, and offers a proposed classification.” Id. at 83 (citing 21 C.F.R. § 807.87).\n\n       It is important to recognize that “[t]he § 510(k) notification process is by no\n\nmeans comparable to the PMA process; in contrast to the 1,200 hours necessary to\n\ncomplete a PMA review, the § 510(k) review is completed in an average of only 20\n\nhours.” Lohr, 518 U.S. at 478–79 (citation omitted). This is in large part because,\n\nwhile the PMA process focuses on the safety and efficacy of a device, the § 510(k)\n\nprocess focuses only on whether the new device is equivalent to an existing device. Id.\n\nat 493. Thus, “‘[t]he attraction of substantial equivalence to manufacturers is clear.\n\n\n\n\n                                            59\n\f[Section] 510(k) notification requires little information, rarely elicits a negative\n\nresponse from the FDA, and gets processed very quickly.’” Id. at 479 (quoting Robert\n\nAdler, The 1976 Medical Device Amendments: A Step in the Right Direction Needs\n\nAnother Step in the Right Direction, 43 Food Drug Cosm. L.J. 511, 516 (1988)) (second\n\nalteration in original). Consequently, the abbreviated § 510(k) process has become the\n\nroute by which the vast majority of new medical devices—including Class III devices,\n\nwhich by definition pose the highest level of risk to the patient—enter the marketplace.\n\nSee id.; see also Riegel, 552 U.S. at 1004 (“In 2005, for example, the FDA authorized\n\nthe marketing of 3,148 devices under § 510(k) and granted premarket approval to just\n\n32 devices.”).\n\n              2.      Express Preemption Of State Law Claims Under the MDA\n\n       Manufacturers who opt to engage in the expensive and time-consuming PMA\n\nprocess with respect to new medical devices get the benefit of express statutory\n\nprotection from certain state law claims relating to the device. See 21 U.S.C. § 360k(a);\n\nLohr, 518 U.S. at 492–94. In this regard, section 360k(a) of Title 21 of the U.S. Code\n\nstates (in relevant part) that\n\n              [N]o State or political subdivision of a State may establish or\n              continue in effect with respect to a device intended for human use any\n              requirement—\n\n                   (1) which is different from, or in addition to, any\n                   requirement applicable under this chapter to the device,\n                   and\n                   (2) which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the\n                   device or to any other matter included in a requirement\n                   applicable to the device under this chapter.\n\n21 U.S.C. § 360k(a). The reach of this express exemption clause has been extensively\n\nlitigated over the past three decades, and as a result, the Supreme Court has established\n\n\n\n                                             60\n\fa two-part test that courts must use when evaluating whether state law claims fall within\n\nthe scope of 21 U.S.C. § 360k(a). See Riegel, 552 U.S. at 321–22. Pursuant to the\n\nprescribed analysis, courts must consider, first, “whether the Federal Government has\n\nestablished requirements applicable to” the device, and second, “whether the\n\n[plaintiff’s] common-law claims are based upon [state] requirements with respect to the\n\ndevice that are ‘different from, or in addition to,’ the federal ones, and that relate to\n\nsafety and effectiveness.” Id. (quoting 21 U.S.C. § 360k(a)).\n\n        It is by now well established that the FDA’s affirmative grant of premarket\n\napproval to a medical device through the PMA review process satisfies the first prong\n\nof this two-part inquiry. Id. at 322–23 (noting that premarket approval “imposes\n\nrequirements under the MDA” because “the FDA requires a device that has received\n\npremarket approval to be made with almost no deviations from the specifications in its\n\napproval application” (internal quotation marks omitted)). By contrast, if a device has\n\nbeen approved through the less-arduous Section 510(k) substantial equivalence process,\n\nthe first part of the Supreme Court’s express preemption test does not apply. See Lohr,\n\n518 U.S. at 493–94; see also Duggan v. Medtronic, Inc., 840 F. Supp. 2d 466, 469 (D.\n\nMass. 2012) (explaining that “medical devices entering the market pursuant to the\n\n§ 510(k) process are not subject to specific federal requirements under the MDA,\n\nbecause those devices receive less scrutiny from the FDA”). 19\n\n\n19\n   Per the Supreme Court’s reasoning, the FDA’s Section 510(k) substantial equivalence process “is\nfocused on equivalence, not safety[,]”Lohr, 518 U.S. at 493 (emphasis in original; internal quotation\nmarks and citation omitted); therefore, when the FDA grants marketing approval through the substantial\nequivalence review process, it does not actually “require” that the device at issue “take any particular\nform for any particular reason” as is necessary to trigger express preemption, id. at 493 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The Lohr Court further concluded that permitting state law claims to\nproceed with respect to devices that have only undergone substantial equivalence review as opposed to\nPMA review is consistent with congressional intent. See id. at 494 (explaining that “[t]here is no\n\n\n\n                                                  61\n\f        With respect to the second prong of the express preemption inquiry, the Supreme\n\nCourt has held that state common law claims for negligence, strict liability, and breach\n\nof warranty, among other things, qualify as “requirements. . . with respect to devices”\n\nfor the purpose of the MDA’s express preemption clause. Riegel, 552 U.S. at 324, 327.\n\nThus, current express preemption disputes in the medical-device context often involve\n\nthe issue of whether the asserted state common law claims effectively impose\n\nobligations on manufacturers that are “different from, or in addition to” the federal\n\nrequirements. Id. at 321 (quoting § 360k(a)(1)); see, e.g., Cupek v. Medtronic, Inc., 405\n\nF.3d 421, 424–25 (6th Cir. 2005); In re Medtronic, Inc., 592 F. Supp. 2d at 1156–65;\n\nsee also Duggan, 840 F. Supp. 2d at 469 (commenting that “[m]any state common law\n\nclaims impose duties with respect to devices that are “different from, or in addition to”\n\nfederal requirements, satisfying the preemption test’s second prong” (citations\n\nomitted)).\n\n        It is important to underscore the fact that, as the MDA has been interpreted, the\n\nexpress preemption clause does not afford the manufacturer of a PMA-approved\n\nmedical device absolute immunity from all device-related lawsuits arising under state\n\nlaw, but only those that are based on requirements that differ from, or augment, the\n\nfederal requirements. See Hughes v. Boston Sci. Corp., 631 F.3d 762, 767 (5th Cir.\n\n2011) (“[A] manufacturer is not protected from state tort liability when the claim is\n\nbased on the manufacturer’s violation of applicable federal requirements.”). This\n\n\n\n\nsuggestion in either the statutory scheme or the legislative history that the § 510(k) exemption process\nwas intended to do anything other than maintain the status quo with respect to the marketing of existing\nmedical devices and their substantial equivalents[,]” and “[t]hat status quo included the possibility that\nthe manufacturer of the device would have to defend itself against state-law claims of negligent\ndesign”).\n\n\n                                                   62\n\fmeans that “[Section] 360k does not prevent a State from providing a damages remedy\n\nfor claims premised on a violation of FDA regulations; the state duties in such a case\n\n‘parallel,’ rather than add to, federal requirements.” Riegel, 552 U.S. at 330 (citations\n\nomitted). However, “[p]laintiffs cannot simply incant the magic words ‘[the\n\nmanufacturer] violated FDA regulations’ in order to avoid preemption.” In re\n\nMedtronic, 592 F. Supp. 2d at 1158. Rather, for such a “parallel” claim to survive, a\n\nplaintiff must (1) point to specific federal requirements that the manufacturer violated;\n\n(2) specifically identify a state law claim that is parallel to the federal requirements, and\n\n(3) causally connect the simultaneous violations of federal and state law and to the\n\nalleged injury. See Caplinger v. Medtronic, Inc., 921 F. Supp. 2d 1206, 1214 (W.D.\n\nOkla. 2013), aff’d, 784 F.3d 1335 (10th Cir. 2015).\n\n       Thus, while it is the device manufacturer’s burden to invoke the MDA’s express\n\npreemption clause based on the FDA’s premarket approval of the device at issue, see\n\nBruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC, 562 U.S. 223, 251 n.2 (2011) (noting that federal preemption\n\nis an affirmative defense which a defendant must invoke and establish in the first\n\ninstance), once the defendant does so, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to establish that\n\nthe state law claims it seeks to maintain are truly parallel to the federal requirements at\n\nissue, and that the alleged breach of these parallel duties caused the plaintiff’s injury,\n\ncf. Carter v. Novartis Consumer Health, Inc., 582 F. Supp. 2d 1271, 1287–88 (C.D. Cal.\n\n2008) (applying burden shifting framework to an FDCA express preemption clause\n\nrelating to prescription drugs). And it is in the context of demonstrating that the state\n\nlaw claims are not expressly preempted because the state law duty is “genuinely\n\nequivalent” to the applicable federal law requirements for a device, Wolicki–Gables v.\n\n\n\n\n                                             63\n\fArrow Int’l, Inc., 634 F.3d 1296, 1300 (11th Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted), that the plaintiff must specify the particular federal requirement at\n\nissue, identify the truly parallel state law claim, and establish the requisite causation.\n\nSee McAfee v. Medtronic, Inc., No. 12-cv-417, 2016 WL 2588807, at *1 (N.D. Ind. May\n\n5, 2016); see also Wolicki–Gables, 634 F.3d at 1300 (explaining that “[s]tate and\n\nfederal requirements are not genuinely equivalent if a manufacturer could be held liable\n\nunder the state law without having violated the federal law” (quoting McMullen v.\n\nMedtronic, Inc., 421 F.3d 482, 489 (7th Cir. 2005)).\n\n              3.     Implied Preemption Of State Law Claims Under the MDA\n\n       Unlike express preemption, the doctrine of implied preemption does not rest on\n\nthe provisions of a statute; instead, it necessarily follows from the legislature’s intent to\n\nconfer all regulatory authority to a federal body. For example, the FDCA vests the\n\nFDA with exclusive authority to investigate potential violations of medical device\n\nrequirements, regardless of whether the FDA has approved the device through the\n\nrigorous PMA process or the less onerous § 510(k) substantial equivalence process.\n\nSee, e.g., Martin v. Medtronic, Inc., No. 15-cv-0994, 2017 WL 825410, at *9 (E.D. Ca.\n\nFeb. 24, 2017) (finding that doctrine of implied preemption barred warranty claim\n\nrelating to PMA-approved device); Jones v. Medtronic, Inc., 89 F. Supp. 3d 1035, 1046\n\n(D. Ariz. 2015) (noting that implied preemption is available where device is approved\n\nthrough the 510(k) process)). Thus, a plaintiff’s attempt to enforce federal requirements\n\nin the context of private litigation (even a suit that ostensibly involves only state law\n\nclaims) may run afoul of this delegation.\n\n       In Buckman Company v. Plaintiffs’ Legal Committee, 531 U.S. 341 (2001), the\n\nSupreme Court held that if establishing the defendant’s liability for the plaintiff’s state\n\n\n                                             64\n\flaw claim requires demonstrating that the FDCA has been violated, then prosecution of\n\nthe state law action intrudes upon the FDA’s exclusive province to enforce the FDCA,\n\nrendering the suit impliedly preempted. Id. at 349–53. The Supreme Court was also\n\nclear in Buckman that implied preemption is by no means absolute; that is, a plaintiff\n\nmay rely on a violation of an FDCA requirement as a predicate for a state tort claim\n\nwhere the plaintiff brings a claim for a “traditional state tort law which [] predated the\n\nfederal enactments in question[.]” Id. at 353. By contrast, if the state law claim would\n\nnot exist in the absence of the FDCA, “then the plaintiff is effectively suing for a\n\nviolation of the FDCA (no matter how the plaintiff labels the claim), and the plaintiff’s\n\nclaim is thus impliedly preempted under Buckman.” Riley v. Cordis Corp., 625 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 769, 777 (D. Minn. 2009) (citation omitted).\n\n       All this means that the doctrines of express and implied preemption, though\n\nrelated, are analytically distinct. The MDA’s express preemption provision prohibits a\n\nplaintiff from imposing additional requirements on a PMA-approved device, but allows\n\nenforcement of genuinely parallel state law requirements with respect to that device.\n\nImplied preemption in the medical-device context prohibits a plaintiff from enforcing\n\nFDCA requirements in the absence of a preexisting state law claim that addresses those\n\nsame duties, irrespective of whether the device was approved through the PMA process\n\n(as was the case with Medtronic’s MMT-522 Pump) or the § 510(k) substantial\n\nequivalence process (as was the case with the MMT-396 Infusion Set). With respect to\n\nPMA-approved medical devices, then, the interrelation between express preemption and\n\nimplied preemption produces a “narrow gap” in which plaintiffs can proceed to\n\nvindicate established state law duties that exist entirely independent of federal law, but\n\n\n\n\n                                            65\n\fonly to the extent that such common law tort claims are truly parallel to the\n\nrequirements of federal law. See Cupek, 405 F.3d at 423. But where applicable, either\n\ndoctrine suffices to prevent a plaintiff from advancing state common law claims\n\nregarding alleged injuries from the use of FDA-approved medical devices.\n\n        B.      With One Exception, The MDA Expressly Preempts All Of The\n                Kubickis’ MMT-522 Pump Claims\n\n        As a threshold matter, the instant parties dispute whether the insulin pump that\n\nwas prescribed to Caroline Kubicki at the time of her injury—Medtronic’s MMT-522\n\nPump—is a PMA-approved medical device such that express preemption applies at all.\n\n(See Medtronic’s Mem. at 15–16; Pls.’ Opp’n at 40–42.) They also disagree regarding\n\n(a) whether Plaintiffs have identified specific federal requirements that can form the\n\nbasis for a parallel state claim under Riegel (see Medtronic’s Mem. at 47–52; Pls.’\n\nOpp’n at 44–51); (b) whether Plaintiffs have, in fact, asserted state law claims that are\n\ngenuinely parallel to any such federal requirement (see Pls.’ Opp’n at 50–51;\n\nMedtronic’s Reply at 19); and (c) whether the alleged violation of state and federal law\n\ncaused Caroline’s injury (see Medtronic’s Mem. at 49–52, 52 n.12; Pls.’ Opp’n at 53–\n\n55; Medtronic’s Reply at 19–20). For the reasons explained below, this Court\n\nconcludes that Medtronic is entitled to summary judgment based on express preemption\n\nfor all of the tort claims that pertain to the MMT-522 Pump, with the exception of\n\nPlaintiffs’ pump-related manufacturing defect claim, which cannot be adequately\n\nassessed prior to expert discovery. 20 The Court’s conclusions regarding express\n\n\n20\n   With respect to this carve-out, the Court rejects Medtronic’s argument that it is entitled to summary\njudgment “because there is absolutely no evidence of any manufacturing defect with the MMT-522\nPump . . . Caroline was allegedly using at the time of the incident.” (Medtronic’s Mem. at 33; see also\nid. at 33–34 (arguing that manufacturing records show that Caroline’s pump using at the time\n\n\n\n                                                   66\n\fpreemption are based on its finding that (1) the FDA approved the MMT-522 Pump\n\nthrough the PMA process, and thus the MDA’s express preemption provision is\n\napplicable to that device, and (2) with respect to the non-manufacturing pump-related\n\nclaims, Plaintiffs have either failed to identify a specific FDA requirement upon which\n\ntheir allegedly parallel state law claims can be based, or failed to establish that any\n\ngenuinely equivalent parallel state law claim exists.\n\n                1.      State Law Claims Pertaining To The MMT-522 Pump Are\n                        Subject To The MDA’s Express Preemption Provision\n                        Because That Device Was Approved Pursuant To The FDA’s\n                        Premarket Approval Process\n\n        In support of its argument that the Kubickis’ pump-related claims are expressly\n\npreempted under the MDA, Medtronic points to evidence that it says “conclusively\n\ndemonstrates [that] the MMT-522 Pump has Premarket Approval.” (Medtronic’s Mem.\n\nat 44 (citing a declaration that it says establishes that “the FDA approved the MMT-522\n\nPump as a PMA supplement—PMA No. P980022/S013”).) Plaintiffs appear to accept\n\nthe representation that the insulin-delivery system of which the MMT-522 Pump is a\n\npart received the FDA’s stamp of premarket approval, but they argue that the FDA’s\n\napproval was not all-encompassing for the purpose of the MDA’s express preemption\n\nclause, because “the FDA did not approve the use of the MMT-522 Insulin Pump in\n\nisolation, but instead approved the Real Time System [consisting of the pump and a\n\n\nconformed with all applicable specifications and were free from manufacturing defects).) While\nPlaintiffs concede that they “do not have evidence at this point that there were any deviations from any\n. . . manufacturing specifications that the FDA approved[,]” (Mot. Hr’g Tr. at 28:21–24), their experts\nhave yet to conduct any destructive testing of the pump, (see id. at 29:2–30:6). Thus, this Court finds\nthat it would be premature to dismiss the claims that are based on the assertion that Medtronic deviated\nfrom the manufacturing specifications for the MMT-522 pump, and that such a deviation caused\nCaroline’s injury, prior to expert discovery. (See id. at 28:11–30:6.) See also Riegel, 552 U.S. at 321–\n22. If the proposed destructive testing of the pump is conducted during the expert discovery process,\nand if it does not reveal any evidence of a manufacturing defect, Medtronic may renew its preemption\ncontention with respect to the manufacturing defect claim.\n\n\n\n                                                   67\n\fblood glucose sensor] ‘as a whole’ and on the basis that it would purportedly be\n\nmarketed, sold, and ultimately used as a system[.]” (Pls.’ Opp’n at 41 (emphasis\n\nadded).) As a result, Plaintiffs say, Medtronic cannot rely on the express preemption\n\ndoctrine with respect to the MMT-522 Pump standing alone.\n\n      At least two federal district courts have rejected this same argument in the\n\ncontext of litigation pertaining to this same pump model. See Duggan, 840 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 471-73; Bentzley v. Medtronic, 827 F. Supp. 2d 443, 450–51 (E.D. Pa. 2011). The\n\nplaintiffs in both Duggan and Bentzley argued—as Plaintiffs do here—that although\n\nMedtronic’s Paradigm Real Time System (which consists of both the MMT-522 Pump\n\nand a continuous glucose monitor) was approved through the PMA process, the MMT-\n\n522 Pump should be considered to be substantially equivalent to Medtronic’s earlier\n\nmodel MMT-515 pump, which had only “entered the market through the § 510k process\n\nand not the premarket approval process.” Duggan, 840 F. Supp. 2d at 471 (“The\n\nDuggans argue that while certain aspects of the Paradigm Real Time System may have\n\nreceived premarket approval, the [MMT-522] pump itself did not; instead, they contend,\n\nonly the capacity of the pump and the sensor to communicate with each other was\n\ngranted premarket approval.”); see Bentzley, 827 F. Supp. 2d at 451 (“Plaintiff attempts\n\nto raise an issue of material fact by arguing that the MMT–522 pump is separate and\n\napart from the insulin infusion system and did not gain approval through the PMA\n\nprocess.” (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Both courts rejected this\n\ncontention, noting that it is well-established that “once premarket approval is granted,\n\nall claims relating to all components of the device are preempted.” Duggan, 840 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 471 (citations omitted); Bentzley, 827 F. Supp. 2d at 452 (“Plaintiff’s\n\n\n\n\n                                           68\n\fcontention that, in considering a preemption issue, the Court must break a medical\n\ndevice into its component parts, is without legal support. In fact, courts that have dealt\n\nwith this issue have done just the opposite.” (citations omitted)); see also, e.g., Aaron.\n\nv. Medtronic, Inc., 209 F. Supp. 3d 994, 1003 (S.D. Ohio 2016) (“Premarket approval\n\nextends to all components of an approved device, even when a physician uses the\n\ncomponents separately.”); Hawkins v. Medtronic, No. 13cv0499, 2014 WL 346622, at\n\n*5 (E.D. Cal. Jan. 30, 2014) (“The requirements set forth in the premarket approval for\n\nthe entire device are just as applicable to the components that together form the FDA-\n\napproved device as the device itself.”). This Court agrees with the persuasive views\n\nexpressed in these prior cases for several reasons.\n\n       To begin with, it is clear that breaking down a PMA-approved medical device\n\ninto its components for the purpose of evaluating the reach of the MDA’s express\n\npreemption clause, as Plaintiffs suggest, runs afoul of the statutory definition of\n\n“device” under the MDA. That is, per the statute, a medical “device” includes “any\n\ncomponent, part, or accessory[,]” 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), and in the context of the\n\nParadigm Infusion System, there is no question that the MMT-522 Pump is precisely\n\nsuch a component part. Thus, the MMT-522 Pump falls within the scope of the device-\n\nrelated PMA approval that Medtronic received.\n\n       Nor can this Court accept the Kubickis’ related argument that the FDA has\n\nconceded that only the Paradigm Infusion System as a whole—and not the MMT-522\n\nPump standing alone—was approved through the PMA process. (See Pls.’ Opp’n at 41\n\n(citing FDA Response to Citizen Petition, Sept. 23, 2011, Ex. C to Decl. of Michael\n\nBrown, ECF No. 133-5, at 56–58)). In this regard, Plaintiffs point to a Citizen Petition\n\n\n\n\n                                            69\n\fthat was submitted to the FDA in 2010, requesting that the FDA modify the PMA letter\n\nthe agency had issued for the Paradigm Infusion System to include the following\n\nlanguage: “This approval is limited solely to the ability of the pump to accept data\n\nfrom the sensor and the ability for the sensor to communicate directly to the pump, and\n\nthis approval does not extend to the pump itself.” (Id. at 57 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).) The FDA rejected this request, stating that it had “approved the PMA\n\nsupplement for the Paradigm System, including both the 522 pump and the Guardian RT\n\nsensor, on April 7, 2006[,]” and that the amendment request was being denied\n\n“[b]ecause the approval letter, as issued, applies to the Paradigm System as a whole[.]”\n\n(Id. at 58.) Like the Duggan and Bentzley courts (which considered and rejected the\n\nsame Citizen Petition argument Plaintiffs make here, see Duggan, 840 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n472; Bentzley, 827 F. Supp. 2d at 451), this Court sees no ambiguity in the agency’s\n\nstatements regarding the scope of the PMA approval: the letter states unequivocally\n\nthat “both the 522 pump and the Guardian RT sensor” had received premarket approval.\n\n(FDA Response to Citizen Petition at 58 (emphasis added).) And the fact that the\n\nagency expressly declined to amend its materials to exclude the pump from its PMA\n\napproval further underscores that it was not the agency’s intention for any such\n\nexclusion to be made. See Duggan, 840 F. Supp. 2d at 472 (“To the extent there was\n\nany ambiguity about the scope of the approval letter, this rejection of the Citizen\n\nPetition is the cherry on the icing.”).\n\n       In arguing that the MMT-522 Pump was not PMA approved and is therefore\n\nineligible for express-preemption treatment, the Kubickis actually make no mention of\n\nDuggan or Bentzley (see Pls.’ Opp’n at 40–42), and this Court sees no obvious reason to\n\n\n\n\n                                            70\n\freach a different conclusion than its sister courts did when those courts carefully\n\nconsidered whether Medtronic’s MMT-522 Pump should have received premarket\n\napproval for the purpose of the expression-preemption analysis. Therefore, this Court\n\nlikewise holds that the FDA granted the MMT-522 pump premarket approval, and that\n\nthe first prong of the Riegel test for express preemption (i.e., whether the medical\n\ndevice at issue is subject to federal requirements) is satisfied. See Duggan, 840 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 469 (explaining that “[t]he FDA’s premarket approval (‘PMA’) process\n\nimposes federal requirements on a medical device under the MDA”). 21\n\n                2.       Plaintiffs Have Not Established That Their Pump-Related\n                         State Law Claims Are Genuinely Equivalent To Specific\n                         Federal Law Requirements\n\n        Turning to the next step in the Riegel analysis, as explained above, plaintiffs who\n\nseek to counter a defendant’s authorized invocation of the MDA’s express preemption\n\nprovision with respect to a medical device that received premarket approval must\n\nidentify specific federal requirements with respect to which genuinely parallel state law\n\nclaims exist, and must plausibly allege that the defendants’ violation of state (and\n\nfederal) law in the claimed manner caused the plaintiffs’ injury. The Kubickis’ early\n\n\n21\n   The recent authority that Plaintiffs have brought to this Court’s attention, see Brackin v. Medtronic,\nNo. 12-cv-00734-KGB (W.D. Tenn. September 14, 2017), does not alter this Court’s conclusion. (See\nEx. 1 to Pls.’ Notice of Supp. Auth., ECF No. 156-1.) Brackin involved a motion to dismiss, and that\ncourt merely concluded that it could not “conclusively determine whether [the pump at issue has]\nreceived premarket approval” at that early stage of the litigation. Brackin, slip op. at 10; see also id. at\n6 (considering the express preemption defense but “emphasiz[ing] that this issue arises at the motion to\ndismiss stage”). The Brackin court also noted that the pump at issue therein was the MMT-523 Pump,\nand that defendants’ assertion that the MMT-522 Pump was a predecessor to the MMT-523 Pump was\n“insufficient to establish that the 523 pump was subject to premarket approval within the meaning of\nRiegel.” Brackin, slip. op. at 9. By contrast, this case concerns the MMT-522 Pump, and the record\nhere contains unrefuted evidence that the MMT-522 Pump received premarket approval as a component\nof the Real Time System. (See FDA Response to Citizen’s Petition.) Moreover, Brackin’s reasoning is\nnot binding on this Court, and to the extent that the Brackin court’s holding could be read to allow a\ncourt to break a PMA-approved system into component parts for purposes of the express preemption\nanalysis, this Court finds that the decision runs counter to the prevailing weight of authority cited\nabove and is unpersuasive.\n\n\n                                                    71\n\fattempts to accomplish this difficult task were “admittedly skimpy[,]” Kubicki, 2013\n\nWL 1739580, at *8, but the Court deemed them passable for the purpose of Medtronic’s\n\nmotion to dismiss, id. Notably, however, in its opinion regarding the motion to dismiss,\n\nthe Court expressly announced its expectation that “as this action proceeds, Plaintiffs\n\nwill refine their claims to more specifically articulate the parallel relationship between\n\nthe alleged common law duties and the federal requirements.” Id. at *9. And it further\n\nwarned that “[s]hould Plaintiffs fail to do so, Defendants may renew their express\n\npreemption objections at a later, appropriate time.” Id.\n\n        This means that the express preemption arguments that Medtronic makes in the\n\ninstant motion for summary judgment are both anticipated and well-founded. 22 Yet,\n\nPlaintiffs are correct to note that the mere fact that the FDA has granted premarket\n\napproval to a device does not render all state law claims relating to the product\n\npreempted carte blanche. (See Pls.’ Opp’n at 38 (“A PMA-approved medical device\n\nmanufacturer ‘is protected by law from civil liability so long as they comply with\n\nfederal law[.]’” (quoting Bausch v. Stryker Corp., 630 F.3d 546, 550 (7th Cir. 2010)\n\n(emphasis in original))).) See also Bryant v. Medtronic, Inc., 623 F.3d 1200, 1205 (8th\n\nCir. 2010) (explaining that a state law claim that “parallel[s]” federal requirements and\n\nis “premised on a violation of FDA regulations” can survive express preemption).\n\n\n22\n   Plaintiffs make the odd suggestion that the Court’s ruling on Medtronic’s motion to dismiss disposed\nof the preemption question in their favor such that Medtronic cannot raise a preemption argument now.\n(See Pls.’ Opp’n at 38–39 (“Medtronic. . . has re-couched its failed motion to dismiss as a motion for\nsummary judgment, asserting the precise arguments this Court has already rejected.”)). Given the\nlanguage of the Court’s ruling on the motion to dismiss, however, any such contention is misguided;\nindeed, the Court’s opinion sought to stave off this very argument by expressly stating that the\npreemption findings therein “should in no way be viewed as discounting Defendants’ argument that in\norder to avoid preemption, a plaintiff must specifically identify a federal requirement applicable to the\ndevice which the defendant allegedly violated and a valid, pre-existing state law duty that is genuinely\nparallel to that federal requirement, and [must] also explain how the alleged federal violation caused\nthe alleged injury.” Kubicki, 2013 WL 1739580, at *8 (emphasis omitted).\n\n\n                                                   72\n\fTherefore, for present purposes, the key question is which violations of state law are the\n\nKubickis claiming in regard to the MMT-522 Pump in the context of this action, and are\n\nthose state law claims truly parallel to identified federal law requirements applicable to\n\nthat device?\n\n        The Kubickis have brought five categories of state law claims in the instant\n\naction, including negligence, breach of warranty, and failure to warn (see supra Part\n\nIII.B), and importantly, they maintain that these state law claims do not impose any\n\nrequirements that are “different from, or in addition to” the FDA’s requirements, 21\n\nU.S.C. § 360(k)(a)(1), because these claims are predicated on the MMT-522 Pump\n\nhaving been “manufactured, designed, and labeled in violation of federal law[.]” (Pls.’\n\nOpp’n at 44(emphasis added).) 23 The federal requirements that Plaintiffs say Medtronic\n\nhas violated with respect to the design, manufacturing, and labeling of the MMT-522\n\nPump are certain of the FDA’s “current good manufacturing practice” (CGMP)\n\nrequirements—i.e., the generic FDA regulations that “govern the methods used in, and\n\nthe facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling,\n\nstorage, installation, and servicing of all finished devices intended for human use[,]” 21\n\nC.F.R. § 820.1(a)(1)—and also the FDA regulations that require medical device\n\nmanufacturers to monitor and report adverse events involving their products (see 21\n\nC.F.R. § 803, and to adhere to certain standards with respect to the product’s labeling\n\nand use instructions, see 21 C.F.R. §§ 801.5, 801.15. Furthermore, as proof that the\n\n\n23\n   Plaintiffs have forcefully disclaimed any contention that their complaint alleges “that the Insulin\nPump should have been designed, labeled, or manufactured differently from its FDA-approved\nstandards.” (Pls.’ Opp’n at 44.) See Kubicki, 2013 WL 1739580, at *7 (“Plaintiffs[] expressly and\nunambiguously confirm[] that each claim is premised exclusively upon post-approval violations of\nfederal law—a representation on which this Court today relies, and to which Plaintiff shall, in the\nfuture course of this litigation, be bound.”) This is to be expected, as any such claims would clearly be\npreempted. See Riegel, 552 U.S. at 321–22.\n\n\n                                                   73\n\fMMT-522 Pump violates these particular federal standards, Plaintiffs cite the 2013\n\nWarning Letter that memorialized the FDA’s determination that Medtronic’s\n\nmanufacture and distribution of the MMT-522 Pump had transgressed certain CGMPs\n\n(see supra Part II.C.3), and they also point to the fact that Medtronic indisputably failed\n\nto report to the FDA certain post-approval adverse incidents regarding the pump. (See\n\nPls.’s Opp’n at 44–51.)\n\n       Plaintiffs are correct that the FDA once determined that Medtronic violated\n\nvarious CGMPs with respect to its production and marketing of the MMT-522 Pump,\n\nand it is undisputed that Medtronic failed to notify the FDA of certain adverse events\n\nthat were allegedly pump-related (including Caroline’s injury) in a timely manner. (See\n\n2013 Warning Letter at 25–26). But for the reasons that follow, this Court finds that\n\nthe CGMPs that Plaintiffs cite are generally insufficient to be the basis for an allegedly\n\nparallel state law claim regarding the MMT-522 Pump, and that there is no truly\n\nparallel state common law claim that pertains to the one sufficiently-specific federal\n\nlaw requirement that Plaintiffs rely upon (the requirement that manufacturers report\n\nadverse incidents).\n\n              a.      The CGMPs and general labeling and instruction\n                      regulations that Plaintiffs cite are insufficient to support a\n                      parallel state law claim asserting a design, manufacturing,\n                      or labeling defect, or a breach of warranty\n\n       The Kubickis say that their negligent design, manufacturing, labeling, and breach\n\nof warranty common law claims parallel the following CGMPs and other regulations\n\nthat pertain to product labeling and use instructions:\n\n          •   21 C.F.R. § 820.25 (requiring manufacturers to hire “sufficient”\n              personnel and ensure that they have the “necessary” education,\n              training and experience);\n\n\n\n                                             74\n\f•   21 CFR § 820.30 (requiring manufacturers, in general, to\n    establish maintain “procedures to control the design of the\n    device” in order to ensure that specified design requirements are\n    met);\n\n•   21 CFR § 820.50 (requiring manufacturers, in general, to\n    establish procedures to ensure products and services conform to\n    specified requirements);\n\n•   21 CFR § 820.70 (requiring manufacturers, in general, to\n    “establish and maintain process control procedures that describe\n    any process controls necessary to ensure conformance to\n    specifications”);\n\n•   21 CFR § 820.72 (requiring manufacturers to ensure that all\n    inspection, measuring, and test equipment is “suitable”);\n\n•   21 CFR § 820.75 (requiring manufacturers to establish,\n    maintain, and update process parameters and conduct\n    revalidations when processes or designs change, and to ensure\n    that “qualified individuals” perform the validated processes);\n\n•   21 CFR § 820.80 (requiring manufacturers, in general, to\n    “establish and maintain procedures for acceptance activities”);\n\n•   21 C.F.R. § 820.90 (requiring manufacturers, in general, to\n    “establish and maintain procedures to control product that does\n    not conform to specified requirements”);\n\n•   21 C.F.R. § 820.100 (requiring manufacturers, in general, to\n    “establish and maintain procedures for implementing corrective\n    and preventive action”);\n\n•   21 C.F.R. § 820.198 (requiring manufacturers to “establish and\n    maintain procedures for receiving, reviewing, and evaluating\n    complaints by a formally designated unit[,]” including ensuring\n    “timely” and “uniform” review of complaints);\n\n•   21 CFR § 820.250 (requiring manufacturers, “[w]here\n    appropriate,” to “establish and maintain procedures for\n    identifying valid statistical techniques required for establishing,\n    controlling, and verifying the acceptability of process capability\n    and product characteristics”);\n\n•   21 C.F.R. § 801.5 (requiring device manufacturers to provide\n    “adequate directions for use”); and\n\n\n\n                                  75\n\f          •   21 C.F.R. § 801.15 (requiring medical device labeling to be\n              “prominen[t] and “conspicuous[]”).\n\n(See 2d Am. Compl. ¶¶ 43–53.)\n\n       Medtronic insists that because these CGMPs and regulations pertaining to\n\nproduct labels and use instructions “are not device-specific regulations[,]” they cannot\n\nqualify as “device specific federal requirements” that can be the basis for any\n\npurportedly parallel state law claim “within the meaning of [the MDA’s express\n\npreemption clause].” (Medtronic’s Mem. at 48; see also id. at 49.) Thus, Medtronic\n\nappears to have invoked one side of an existing circuit split over whether the CGMPs\n\n“can[] support any viable parallel claim surviving express preemption[.]” (Id. at 48.)\n\nThe Eighth and Eleventh Circuits have held that a plaintiff cannot rely on the CGMPs to\n\nescape the MDA’s express preemption mandate, because the CGMPs are too general to\n\ncreate specific federal requirements that can be enforced under state law. See Wolicki-\n\nGables v. Arrow Int’l, Inc., 634 F.3d 1296, 1301-02 (11th Cir. 2011); In re Medtronic,\n\nInc., Sprint Fidelis Leads Prods. Liab. Litig., 623 F.3d 1200, 1206–07 (8th Cir. 2010).\n\nBy contrast, the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Circuits have found that certain CGMPs are\n\nsufficiently specific to create federal requirements that a plaintiff can enforce through a\n\nparallel state law tort action. See, e.g., Bass v. Stryker Corp., 669 F.3d 501, 511–13\n\n(5th Cir. 2012); Howard v. Sulzer Orthopedics, Inc., 382 F. App’x 436, 440 (6th Cir.\n\n2010); Bausch v. Stryker Corp., 630 F.3d 546, 554–56 & 554 n.1 (7th Cir. 2010).\n\n       Notably, the courts that refuse to find that the FDA’s CGMPs can give rise to\n\nparallel state law claims for express preemption purposes note that the CGMPs are\n\ngeneral prescriptions that “govern ‘the methods used in, and the facilities and controls\n\nused for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage installation and\n\n\n\n                                            76\n\fservicing of all finished devices intended for human use.’” In re Medtronic, 592 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 1157 (emphasis added) (quoting 21 C.F. R. § 820.1(a)(1)). Accordingly,\n\nthese courts reason, the CGMPs “are simply too generic, standing alone, to serve as the\n\nbasis for [a] manufacturing-defect claim[]” because “the CGMPs[] provide specific\n\nmethods to be used for only a small number of medical devices” and “[i]n most cases, it\n\nis left to the manufacturer to determine the best methods to obtain quality objectives.”\n\nId.

Aug. 26,\n\n2011) (concluding that a claim based on the alleged breach of FDA regulations was\n\npreempted where the regulations at issue “fail to provide any tangible or concrete\n\nstandard” because “to allow a violation of such a flexible standard to result in liability\n\nwould, in itself, be imposing a standard ‘different from, or in addition to’ those imposed\n\nby the MDA” (quoting 21 U.S.C. § 360k(a)(1))). In the absence of any guidance from\n\nthe D.C. Circuit on this issue, this Court finds such reasoning compelling, and thus it,\n\ntoo, concludes that the CGMPs that Plaintiffs have cited are insufficient to qualify as a\n\nfederal requirement upon which the Kubickis’ purportedly parallel state law claims can\n\nbe based.\n\n       As previously explained, in order to have a viable—i.e., not expressly\n\npreempted—state law claim for an injury allegedly caused by a medical device that\n\n\n\n\n                                            77\n\freceived premarket approval, the plaintiff must identify specific, concrete federal\n\nrequirements that are applicable to the device in question and that the manufacturer has\n\nallegedly violated in a manner that also gives rise to liability under state law. See\n\nCaplinger, 921 F. Supp. 2d at 1214. There is no question that if a state law claim is to\n\nbe identified as truly “parallel” (i.e., not demanding anything more of the manufacturer\n\nthan the federal law requires), the federal-requirement baseline must be specifically\n\nestablished; yet, by their nature, the CGMPs merely prescribe overarching guidelines\n\nfor manufacturers to follow when developing their own procedures, rather than\n\nspecifically enforceable duties. Indeed, the FDA itself has noted the flexibility that the\n\nCGMPs afford to manufacturers:\n\n              Because this regulation must apply to so many different types\n              of devices, the regulation does not prescribe in detail how a\n              manufacturer must produce a specific device. Rather, the\n              regulation provides the framework that all manufacturers must\n              follow by requiring that manufacturers develop and follow\n              procedures and fill in the details that are appropriate to a\n              given device according to the current state-of-the-art\n              manufacturing for that specific device.\n\nMedical Devices; Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) Final Rule; Quality\n\nSystem Regulation, 61 Fed. Reg. 52,602, 52,603 (Oct. 7, 1996) (emphasis added). This\n\nCourt is persuaded that federal regulations that admittedly “do[] not prescribe in detail\n\nhow a manufacturer must produce a specific device[,]” id., are incapable of serving as\n\nthe benchmark for a reasoned determination of whether state law claims that impose\n\nliability for a manufacturer’s failure to produce the device in a certain way establish\n\nduties that are truly parallel to the federal law.\n\n       The Sixth Circuit’s decision in Howard v. Sulzer Orthopedics, Inc., 382 F. App’x\n\n436, 440 (6th Cir. 2010), which Plaintiffs cite (see Pls.’ Opp’n at 45), is not to the\n\n\n\n                                              78\n\fcontrary. The plaintiff in Howard brought a claim for negligence per se, seeking relief\n\nfor injuries that he suffered when his implanted artificial knee failed due to oily residue\n\nleft behind on the implant as the result of the manufacturing processes. The Howard\n\ncourt concluded that these claims were not expressly preempted because the plaintiff\n\nhad “identif[ied] a specific GMP that he thought had been violated” and “the particular\n\nGMP that he cites is not so vague as to be incapable of enforcement.” 382 F. App’x at\n\n440 (emphasis added). The court in Bausch v. Stryker Corp., 630 F.3d 546 (7th Cir.\n\n2010), another case on which Plaintiffs rely (see Pls.’ Opp’n at 44), likewise recognized\n\nthat the court must evaluate whether particular CGMPs prescribe duties specifically\n\nenough to permit evaluation of the parallel character of a state law claim. Cf. Bausch,\n\n630 F.3d at 556 (“First, the meaning of the FDA’s requirements will present questions\n\nof law for the court to decide, not questions of fact for a jury to decide. Second, those\n\nquestions of law will be questions of federal law, subject to the usual processes for\n\nreconciling conflicting views.”).\n\n       Here, this Court finds that, for the most part, the CGMPs that Plaintiffs cite are\n\nsimply too vague and generic to form the foundation for a reasoned assessment of a\n\nparallel state claim for a design, manufacturing, or labeling defect, or for breach of\n\nwarranty. In their amended complaint, for example, Plaintiffs cite to 21 C.F.R.\n\n§ 820.25(a), which requires every manufacturer to “have sufficient personnel with the\n\nnecessary education, background, training, and experience to assure that all activities\n\nrequired by this part are correctly performed.” 21 C.F.R. § 820.25(a). (See also 2d\n\nAm. Compl. ¶ 48.) The federal regulations do not specify any ratio of employees to\n\nproducts, nor does it say whether “necessary education” means a GED, high school\n\n\n\n\n                                            79\n\fdiploma, bachelor’s degree, or otherwise. How, then, can a court reasonably determine\n\nthat common law negligence liability based on an allegedly insufficient number of\n\nqualified employees extends no farther than the federal regulation that it purportedly\n\nparallels? Similarly, elsewhere in their amended complaint, Plaintiffs cite to the CGMP\n\nregulation that requires manufacturers to “establish and maintain procedures to ensure\n\nthat the design requirements relating to a device are appropriate and address the\n\nintended use of the device, including the needs of the user and patient.” 21 C.F.R.\n\n§ 820.30(c). (See also 2d Am. Compl. ¶ 62.) Here, again, this regulation provides no\n\nguidance on what is specifically required to achieve compliance, and thus cannot serve\n\nas a genuine comparator for any considered evaluation of the scope of similar state law\n\nduties.\n\n          With respect to product labeling and use instructions, the non-CGMP regulations\n\nthat Plaintiffs cite similarly only require that information on a label be “conspicuous[]”\n\nand “prominen[t],” see 21 C.F. R. § 801.15, and that the manufacturer provide\n\n“adequate directions . . . under which the layman can use a device safely and for the\n\npurposes for which it is intended[,]” 21 C.F.R. § 801.5. Again, the lack of specificity\n\nwith respect to the demands of federal law means that there is no meaningful baseline\n\nagainst which to compare the requirements of the state common law, and thus no\n\nreasonable way to determine whether Plaintiffs’ state common law claims are truly\n\nparallel. And none of the other CGMPs and regulations that Plaintiffs reference—save\n\nthe adverse event reporting requirements, discussed below—are any more specific. 24\n\n\n24\n   See, e.g., 21 C.F.R. § 820.30(c) (“Each manufacturer shall establish and maintain procedures to\nensure that the design requirements relating to a device are appropriate and address the intended use of\nthe device, including the needs of the user and patient.”); id § 820.30(e) (“Each manufacturer shall\n\n\n\n                                                   80\n\f        Consequently, the FDA’s 2013 Warning Letter that put Medtronic on notice of\n\nits violation of certain generalized CGMP provisions is really of no moment,. To be\n\nsure, the FDA did find that Medtronic had violated certain CGMPs in the exercise of its\n\nexpertise and discretion, but none of the delineated violations specifically pertained to\n\nthe blocking of the vents on the p-cap (see infra Part III.C.3; 2013 Warning Letter at 2–\n\n25), and the FDA did not flesh out any of the general CGMPs in a manner that is\n\nsufficient to establish that the exact requirements of federal law such that Plaintiffs can\n\ncredibly claim that truly parallel state law requirements exist. The 2013 Warning Letter\n\nalso says nothing about the non-CGMP labeling and use instruction regulations on\n\nwhich Plaintiffs rely, and to this Court’s knowledge, the FDA has no otherwise\n\nilluminated the specific contours of those general federal standards.\n\n\n\nestablish and maintain procedures to ensure that formal documented reviews of the design results are\nplanned and conducted at appropriate stages of the device’s design development.

Design verification shall\nconfirm that the design output meets the design input requirements. The results of the design\nverification, including identification of the design, method(s), the date, and the individual(s)\nperforming the verification, shall be documented in the DHF.”); id. § 820.70(g) (“Each manufacturer\nshall ensure that all equipment used in the manufacturing process meets specified requirements and is\nappropriately designed, constructed, placed, and installed to facilitate maintenance, adjustment,\ncleaning, and use.”); id. § 820.72(a) (“Each manufacturer shall ensure that all inspection, measuring,\nand test equipment . . . is suitable for its intended purposes and is capable of producing valid results.\nEach manufacturer shall establish and maintain procedures to ensure that equipment is routinely\ncalibrated, inspected, checked, and maintained.

Plaintiffs have not identified a genuinely equivalent parallel\n                     state law claim pertaining to Medtronic’s failure to report\n                     events to the FDA\n\n       With respect to Plaintiffs’ reliance on 21 C.F.R. § 803 to support the state\n\ncommon law claims that arise from Medtronic’s alleged failure to track incidents and\n\nmake required reports to the FDA (see, e.g., 2d Am. Compl. ¶ 49), a slightly different\n\npreemption analysis is required. This particular regulation stands in stark contrast to\n\nthe general CGMPs and the product labeling and use instruction regulations described\n\nabove, because the reporting mandates laid out in this regulation are fairly specific\n\nabout what types of events must be reported to the agency and when. For example,\n\nsection 803.50(a) requires device manufacturers to make certain reports within 30 days\n\nof the manufacturer’s receipt of certain information, as follows:\n\n              (a) If you are a manufacturer, you must report to us the\n              information required by § 803.52 in accordance with the\n              requirements of § 803.12(a), no later than 30 calendar days\n              after the day that you receive or otherwise become aware of\n              information, from any source, that reasonably suggests that a\n              device that you market:\n\n                     (1) May have caused or contributed to a death or\n                     serious injury or\n\n                     (2) Has malfunctioned and this device or a similar\n                     device that you market would be likely to cause or\n                     contribute to a death or serious injury, if the\n                     malfunction were to recur.\n\nId. Another provision of this federal regulation requires Medtronic to report certain\n\ninformation within five days of becoming aware of an “event [that] necessitates\n\nremedial action to prevent an unreasonable risk of substantial harm to the public\n\nhealth[,]” id. § 803.53(a), and the precise information that such reports must contain is\n\nalso specified in the regulation, see id. § 803.52(a)–(c) (requiring the reporting of\n\n\n\n                                            82\n\f“[p]atient information[,]” including name, age, gender, and weight; the “[a]dverse event\n\nor product problem[,]” including the nature of the event, the date of the event, the date\n\nof the report, and any test results; and “[d]evice information[,]” including brand,\n\nmanufacture location, model number, and date the device was implanted). Thus, unlike\n\nthe general, flexible guidelines that the various CGMPs to which Plaintiffs point\n\nestablish, see supra Part VII.B.2, these particular reporting requirements are plainly\n\n“not so vague as to be incapable of enforcement.” Howard, 382 F. App’x at 440.\n\n        Where Plaintiffs’ preemption arguments fall short is with respect to Plaintiffs’\n\nobligation to assert state common law claims that are “genuinely equivalent” to these\n\nFDA regulations, Wolicki–Gables, 634 F.3d at 1300, such that the lawsuit does not\n\nimpose any requirements that are “different from, or in addition to, the federal ones,”\n\nRiegel, 552 U.S. at 321–22 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The\n\nKubickis’ counsel all but admitted during this Court’s motions hearing that no\n\nequivalent adverse event reporting claims exist under state law. (See Mot. Hr’g Tr. at\n\n17:9–14 (“So if you’re asking whether or not the District of Columbia has an identical\n\nrequirement, either codified in a state statute or that exists in common law, regarding\n\nthe tracking of complaints to take an example, the answer is no.”).) And that admission\n\nis, in effect, a concession that the Kubickis’ state law failure to warn claims that are\n\nbased on Medtronic’s alleged failure to report adverse events to the FDA are expressly\n\npreempted. See Riley, 625 F. Supp. 2d at 777. 25\n\n\n\n25\n   The cases on which Plaintiffs rely in this context—Hughes v. Boston Scientific Corp., 631 F.3d 762\n(5th Cir. 2011), and Stengel v. Medtronic Inc., 704 F.3d 1224 (9th Cir. 2013)—are inapposite. In\nHughes, the plaintiffs were able to point to a specific Mississippi statute that contained reporting\nrequirements, see 631 F.3d at 769, and in Stengel, the court found that a failure to warn claim survived\na motion to dismiss where the state law “contemplates a warning to a third party such as the FDA[,]”\n704 F.3d at 1233.\n\n\n                                                   83\n\f      In their papers, Plaintiffs struggle mightily to avoid the implications of the\n\nundisputed fact that there is no D.C. common law claim that imposes liability for a\n\nmanufacturer’s failure to report to the FDA adverse incidents concerning an approved\n\nmedical device. For example, they point to the established D.C. common law claim for\n\nfailure to warn consumers of foreseeable harm associated with use of the product (see,\n\ne.g., 2d Am. Compl. Counts XVI–XVIII), and construct the following argument:\n\nbecause Medtronic failed to track adverse events adequately and to notify the FDA in a\n\ntimely manner of adverse events involving the over-delivery of insulin to patients,\n\nMedtronic deprived the FDA of important information regarding the pump that the\n\nagency could have then used to require Medtronic to change its label in order to provide\n\nthe adequate warnings to Caroline and her physicians regarding risks associated with\n\nthe pump that D.C. law requires. (See, e.g., 2d Am. Compl. ¶ 49 (“Medtronic’s failure\n\nto track and report adverse events kept important safety information from the FDA and,\n\ntherefore, device users such as Caroline Kubicki.”).) Thus, Plaintiffs insist that\n\nMedtronic’s violation of the federal reporting requirements effectively amounted to a\n\nfailure to warn consumers for the purpose of D.C.’s common law tort. (See, e.g., id.\n\n¶ 212.)\n\n      This creative effort to craft a D.C. common law claim that is substantially\n\nequivalent to the federal law’s adverse-event reporting requirements fails for at least\n\ntwo reasons. First of all, it ignores the overarching mandate that the state claim and the\n\nfederal claim must be genuinely—as opposed to effectively—equivalent. That is, if\n\nPlaintiffs’ core contention is that the state common law was violated because Medtronic\n\nfailed to warn consumers of device-related risks upon learning new adverse\n\n\n\n\n                                            84\n\finformation, then the federal requirement that such a claim actually parallels is a duty\n\nto warn consumers of device-related risks in light of new adverse events (i.e., the duty\n\nto update product labels post-approval), not the C.F.R.’s requirement that manufacturers\n\nreport such events to the FDA. Put another way, the common law failure to warn claim\n\nis not, in fact, the functional equivalent of a manufacturer’s failure to report adverse\n\nincidents to the FDA in violation of federal law, and Plaintiffs have not identified a\n\nfederal regulation that imposes upon manufacturers the specific obligation to warn\n\nconsumers of adverse post-approval events.\n\n       Second, Plaintiffs’ parallel state law claim argument ultimately relies on sheer\n\nspeculation: Plaintiffs contend that, if Medtronic had complied with the federal\n\nrequirement to report adverse events to the FDA, and if the FDA had directed Medtronic\n\nto update the label of the MMT-522 Pump based on these reported events, then\n\nMedtronic would have had the duty to provide adequate warnings to consumers, as D.C.\n\ncommon law requires. But it is by no means certain that the FDA would have directed\n\nMedtronic to give consumers different or additional information about the MMT-522\n\nPump if the agency had been made aware of other incidents that predated Caroline’s\n\nhypoglycemic injury. And unless such label changes would necessarily have occurred\n\nas a result of Medtronic’s failure to notify the FDA, Plaintiffs’ contention that\n\nMedtronic’s failure to notify the agency is the functional equivalent of failing to warn\n\nconsumers in violation of state law cannot be sustained. Cf. Webster, 259 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 36 (“Nor can plaintiffs create an issue of fact regarding their defective warning claim\n\nby speculating that if the FDA had known of the delayed perforation and tamponade\n\nincidents during the clinical trials and if defendant had investigated all the adverse\n\n\n\n\n                                            85\n\fincidents, the FDA would have either recalled the lead or placed it on alert, and\n\ntherefore, Dr. Lewis would not have implanted it in plaintiff’s heart.” (emphasis\n\nomitted)). Thus, this Court does not accept Plaintiffs’ argument that Medtronic’s\n\nestablished reporting failures are truly parallel to the complaint’s claims that Medtronic\n\nis liable for failing to provide adequate warnings to Caroline and her physicians\n\nregarding risks associated with the pump under District of Columbia law.\n\n       The court in In re Medtronic, Inc. Sprint Fidelis Leads Products Liability\n\nLitigation, 592 F. Supp. 2d 1147 (D. Minn. 2009), reached a similar conclusion about\n\nthe plaintiffs’ purportedly parallel state law claims in the context of a multi-district\n\nlitigation relating to another Medtronic product, when it characterized the state law\n\nclaims as actually and plainly imposing additional requirements on Medtronic under\n\nthese circumstances. It reasoned that a defective-labeling state law claim that is tied to\n\nthe manufacturer’s alleged failure to disclose new information it discovered after the\n\nFDA’s premarket approval of its medical device falls squarely within the preemptive\n\nscope of Riegel:\n\n              Plaintiffs cannot escape that under their theory of liability,\n              Medtronic would have been required to provide warnings\n              above and beyond those on the [] product label—a label that\n              was specifically approved by the FDA as part of the PMA\n              process. Mandating that a manufacturer provide warnings\n              beyond those on the device label would impose requirements\n              different from, or in addition to those approved by the FDA,\n              and are thus preempted.         Simply put, Section 360k(a)\n              preempts claims that are, as here, premised on a post-sale duty\n              to warn, where the plaintiff alleges the defendant was required\n              to provide additional warnings in light of later-received\n              reports of injury to others caused by the same medical device.\n\nId. at 1159 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                             86\n\f       The instant case involves this same dynamic, because the Kubickis’ pump-related\n\nfailure to warn claim are fundamentally based on the contention that Medtronic\n\nbreached a duty to provide additional warnings, and to recall the pump for label\n\nchanges, in light of the deficiencies in the device that the post-approval events revealed.\n\nBut the MDA’s express preemption clause prohibits the Court (or a jury) from making\n\nany such liability determination. See id.; see also Cupek, 405 F.3d at 424 (“Any claim,\n\nunder state law . . . that Defendant failed to warn patients beyond warnings required by\n\nthe FDA, or that Defendant failed to recall a product without first going through the\n\nPMA supplement process[,] would constitute state requirements ‘different from’ or ‘in\n\naddition to’ the requirements of the federal PMA application and supplement process.”\n\n(quoting 21 U.S.C. § 360k(a))); Horn v. Thoratec Corp., 376 F.3d 163, 176–77 (3d Cir.\n\n2004) (holding that failure to warn claims are preempted if they would require the\n\nmanufacturer “to provide different warnings and instructions from those approved by\n\nthe FDA[,]” since the manufacturer was “prohibited . . . by the FDA’s PMA approval\n\norder from making any such changes” (citations omitted)).\n\n       All things considered, then, this Court is confident that the one claimed violation\n\nof federal law that is sufficiently specific to support a parallel state law claim\n\nconcerning the MMT-522 Pump—i.e., Medtronic’s established failure to report\n\nsubsequent adverse events to the FDA in a timely manner, as the adverse reporting\n\nregulations require (see 2013 Warning Letter at 25–26)—does not actually equate with\n\nthe D.C. common law failure to warn claims that the Kubickis allege (see 2d Am.\n\nCompl. ¶¶ 495, & Counts I–III (failure to warn as element of negligence); XVI–XVIII\n\n\n\n\n                                             87\n\f(failure to warn under Restatement of Torts)), and as a result, the MDA’s express\n\npreemption provision bar these state law claims.\n\n      C.     The Implied Preemption Doctrine Does Not Bar Plaintiffs’\n             Claims Against Medtronic For The Allegedly Negligent Design,\n             Manufacture, And Labeling Of The MMT-396 Infusion Set,\n             And The Claims Based On Medtronic’s Alleged Failure To\n             Warn Consumers About That Product Also Survive\n\n      At this point, it is crucial to recall that the FDA authorized Medtronic to market\n\nthe allegedly defective components of the insulin-delivery system that Caroline was\n\nusing at the time of her injury through two different processes: the MMT-522 Pump\n\nwas subjected to the PMA process, while the agency cleared the MMT-396 Infusion Set\n\nthrough the § 510(k) “substantial equivalence” route. (See Medtronic’s Stmt. of Facts\n\n¶¶ 7–9.) Thus, the doctrine of express preemption is inapplicable to claims pertaining\n\nto the MMT-396 Infusion Set, see Lohr, 518 U.S. at 492–94, and the Kubickis can\n\nproceed with their infusion set-related state law tort claims so long as those claims do\n\nnot implicate the FDA’s exclusive authority to enforce the FDCA and its implementing\n\nregulations. See 21 U.S.C. § 337(a); see also Buckman, 531 U.S. at 349 n.4 (“The\n\nFDCA leaves no doubt that it is the Federal Government rather than private litigants\n\nwho are authorized to file suit for noncompliance with the medical device provisions.”).\n\n      In its prior opinion denying Medtronic’s motion to dismiss, the Court addressed\n\nthe issue of whether Plaintiffs’ claims relating to the MMT-522 Pump (the only claims\n\nasserted in the complaint at that time) were impliedly preempted, and determined that\n\nthey were not. See Kubicki, 2013 WL 1739580, at *11 (“Because Plaintiffs are\n\nasserting breach of recognized state law duties which are parallel to federal regulations\n\n(as opposed to an independent implied right action under the MDA to directly enforce\n\nthose regulation), their claims are not impliedly preempted under Buckman.” (citations\n\n\n                                            88\n\fand emphasis omitted)). This Court need not revisit the pump-related implied\n\npreemption evaluation now, because it has already decided that the Kubickis’ pump-\n\nrelated claims are expressly preempted in any event. (See supra Part VI.B.) 26 Thus, the\n\nonly preemption question that remains at this time is whether implied preemption bars\n\nthe Kubickis’ state law claims against Medtronic concerning the MMT-396 Infusion\n\nSet.\n\n        It is well established that state law tort claims with respect to a § 510(k) device\n\ncan persist unabated if they “rely[] on traditional state tort law [that] had predated the\n\nfederal enactments” that purportedly preempt them, Buckman, 531 U.S. at 353; and\n\nalternatively, state law claims are deemed impliedly preempted if “the existence of the\n\nfederal enactments is a critical element in their case[,]” id. The seminal Supreme Court\n\ncase on implied preemption—Buckman Company v. Plaintiffs’ Legal Committee, 531\n\nU.S. 341 (2001)—involved an allegation that a medical device manufacturer had made\n\nfraudulent representations to the FDA regarding the intended use of a medical device,\n\nwhich had led the FDA to grant § 510(k) approval to the device that injured the\n\nplaintiff. See id. at 343. The Supreme Court ruled that such a “fraud-on-the-FDA”\n\nclaim could not be established apart from the federal approval process, and would\n\n“inevitably conflict with the FDA’s responsibility to police fraud consistently with the\n\nAdministration’s judgment and objectives.” Id. at 350. Therefore, the Court held that\n\nthe fraud claim was impliedly preempted. See id. at 348; see also id. at 347–48 (noting\n\n\n26\n   As suggested above, when it comes to PMA-approved devices, the overly of express and implied\npreemption analyses results in a particularly complex, nuanced inquiry. See In re Medtronic, Inc., 623\nF.3d at 1204 (citing Riley, 625 F. Supp. 2d at 777) (explaining that “[t]he plaintiff must be suing for\nconduct that violates the FDCA (or else his claim is expressly preempted by § 360k(a)), but the\nplaintiff must not be suing because the conduct violates the FDCA (such a claim would be impliedly\npreempted under Buckman).”).\n\n\n\n                                                  89\n\fthat “petitioner’s dealings with the FDA were prompted by the MDA, and the very\n\nsubject matter of petitioner’s statements were dictated by that statute’s provisions”).\n\nAccordingly, courts have held that “a private litigant cannot bring a state-law claim\n\nagainst a defendant when the state-law claim is in substance (even if not in form) a\n\nclaim for violating the FDCA—that is, when the state claim would not exist if the\n\nFDCA did not exist.” Riley, 625 F. Supp. 2d at 777 (citing Buckman, 531 U.S. at 352–\n\n53); see also Schouest v. Medtronic, Inc., 13 F. Supp. 3d 692, 705 (S.D. Tex. 2014)\n\n(“Because these claims would apply to a seller of a product not subject to any federal\n\nregulations who engaged in similar alleged misconduct, they are not impliedly\n\npreempted.”).\n\n       Applying these standards, and keeping in mind the Supreme Court’s admonition\n\nin Lohr that, a medical device manufacturer that elects to proceed through § 510(k)\n\nfaces the possibility of having “to defend itself against state-law claims” that would\n\nhave been expressly preempted if it had instead opted for the more arduous PMA\n\nprocess, see Lohr, 518 U.S. at 494, this Court concludes that the Kubickis’ claims\n\nagainst Medtronic that allege the negligent design, manufacture, and labeling of the\n\nMMT-396 Infusion Set exist independently of the FDCA, and in fact, are precisely the\n\ntype of claims that the Lohr Court anticipated would be allowed to proceed. See, e.g.,\n\nSchouest, 13 F. Supp. 3d at 704 (finding that state law fraud, negligence, and breach of\n\nwarranty claims relating to medical device were not impliedly preempted where they\n\n“would exist in a world without the FDCA”); In re Medtronic, Inc. Implantable\n\nDefibrillators Litig., 465 F. Supp. 2d 886, 899–900 (D. Minn. 2006) (holding that\n\nnegligence and strict liability claims were not impliedly preempted because plaintiffs\n\n\n\n\n                                            90\n\frelied on traditional state causes of action and did not seek to recover for fraud on the\n\nFDA).\n\n        In addition, although Plaintiffs have conceded that no common law claim for\n\nfailure to report adverse events to the FDA exists under District of Columbia law, to the\n\nextent that the Kubickis’ failure to warn claim alleges that Medtronic breached “a duty\n\nof reasonable care” owed to Caroline Kubicki, her parents, and her physicians “to\n\nadequately warn of the foreseeable harm associated with the use” of the MMT-396\n\nInfusion Sets (2d Am. Compl. ¶ 205)—including “a duty to provide specific directions\n\nfor the safe use” of the product (id. ¶ 206 (emphasis in original)) and “sufficient\n\nwarnings and instructions for use” (id. ¶ 210)—this claim, too, survives Defendant’s\n\nimplied preemption argument. 27 Under D.C. law, there has long been a recognized tort\n\nclaim that can be brought against manufacturers that fail to warn consumers of known\n\nproduct defects. See, e.g., Payne v. Soft Sheen Prods., 486 A.2d 712, 721–22 (D.C.\n\n\n\n27\n    Once again, the distinction between the alleged negligent failure to report adverse events to the\nFDA, on the one hand, and the failure to warn the public about foreseeable risks associated with a\ndevice, on the other, matters. The courts of appeals have split over whether a state law failure to report\nclaim (when one is recognized) is impliedly preempted: the Sixth and Eighth Circuits have refused to\nallow state law tort claims based on alleged violations of FDA reporting requirements to proceed,\nfinding that such claims encroach on the FDA’s exclusive province to enforce the FDCA, see, e.g.,\nMarsh v. Genentech, Inc., 693 F.3d 546, 553 (6th Cir. 2012) (holding that “failure to submit reports to\nthe FDA that the FDA requires is arguably a species of fraud on the agency under the state Act” that\ndirectly implicates that Supreme Court’s holding in Buckman); In re Medtronic, Inc., 623 F.3d at 1204,\nwhile the Fifth, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits have held that state law failure to report claims based on\nallegations that a manufacturer failed to report adverse events to the FDA are not impliedly preempted\nunder Buckman, because such claims are based on an alleged “breach of a ‘recognized state-law duty’\nrather than ‘an implied right of action under federal law[,]’” Hughes, 631 F.3d at 775 (quoting Bausch,\n630 F.3d at 557–58); see also, e.g., Stengel, 704 F.3d at 1233 (“The Stengels’ proposed new claim\nunder Arizona law, insofar as the state-law duty parallels a federal-law duty under the MDA, is not\npreempted.”). The D.C. Circuit has not waded into this dispute, and this Court finds no reason to do so\nhere, given Plaintiffs’ admission that there is no common law claim for failing to report adverse events\nto the FDA in this jurisdiction. The resulting inevitable conclusion is that the only potentially viable\nfailure to warn claim in Plaintiffs’ complaint is the contention that Medtronic breached its duty to warn\nconsumers directly. (See, e.g., 2d Am. Compl. ¶ 212 (alleging that Medtronic “breached its duty to\nwarn Caroline Kubicki, her parents, her physicians and the FDA of the foreseeable harm associated\nwith the use” of its product).)\n\n\n                                                   91\n\f1985); Russell v. G. A. F. Corp., 422 A.2d 989, 991 (D.C. 1980). Therefore, this Court\n\nis persuaded that the Kubickis’ failure to warn consumers claim (i.e., their contention\n\nthat Medtronic negligently failed to warn consumers about the dangers of the MMT-396\n\nInfusion Set and to provide sufficient instructions for its safe use) exists independently\n\nof federal law in a manner that withstands Defendants’ implied preemption argument.\n\n       In sum, with respect to Medtronic’s preemption contentions, this Court concludes\n\nthat (1) Medtronic is entitled to summary judgment, on the basis of express preemption,\n\nwith respect to the all of the claims that pertain to the MMT-522 Pump (with the\n\nexception of Plaintiffs’ manufacturing defect claim), and (2) the Kubickis cannot\n\nmaintain a (non-existent) state law claim for Medtronic’s alleged failure to report to the\n\nFDA adverse events involving the MMT-396 Infusion Set, and thus Medtronic is\n\nentitled to summary judgment on any such claim on the basis of implied preemption,\n\nbut (3) the doctrine of implied preemption presents no bar to the Kubickis’ claims\n\nrelating to design, manufacture, and labeling of the MMT-396 Infusion Set, or to their\n\nclaims that Medtronic violated established state common law by failing to warn\n\nconsumers about risks associated with the MMT-396 Infusion Set.\n\n\nVIII. RULING ON THE LEARNED INTERMEDIARY DOCTRINE, THE\n      KUBICKIS’ INFUSION SET WARRANTY CLAIM, AND PUNITIVE\n      DAMAGES\n\n       Finally, this Court turns to a series of alternative and miscellaneous arguments\n\nthat Medtronic makes in support of its contention that it is entitled to an award of\n\nsummary judgment in this case.\n\n\n\n\n                                            92\n\f      A.     Medtronic Is Not Entitled To Summary Judgment With Respect\n             To The Failure To Warn Claims On The Basis Of The Learned\n             Intermediary Doctrine\n\n      To further assail the Kubickis’ unpreempted infusion set-related failure to warn\n\nconsumers claims, Medtronic points to “the learned intermediary doctrine” (Medtronic\n\nMem. at 63–66), which “holds that, because prescription [devices] are available to the\n\npublic only through a physician and are to be administered only under a physician’s\n\nsupervision, the [device] manufacturer’s duty is to adequately inform the physician,\n\nwho is expected to function as a ‘learned intermediary’ between the company and the\n\npatient in protecting the patient and providing direct information about the [device] to\n\nthe patient.’” MacPherson, 775 F. Supp. at 422-23; see also Patteson v. AstraZeneca,\n\nLP, 876 F. Supp. 2d 27, 34 (D.D.C. 2012) (“As long as the [prescription] manufacturer\n\nproperly warns a prescribing physician of the dangerous propensities of its product, the\n\nmanufacturer is excused from warning each patient who receives the [product].”). In\n\nthis regard, Medtronic argues that, because “Medtronic’s duty to warn of any dangers\n\nassociated with these products ran [only] to the licensed medical professional who\n\nprescribed them[,]” and because Dr. Dandona (Caroline’s physician) testified that “he\n\ndid not read or rely upon the warnings and would not have altered his decision to\n\nprescribe the MMT-522 Pump and MMT-396 Infusion Set” to Caroline even if the\n\nwarnings had been sufficient (Medtronic’s Mem. at 64), the Kubickis cannot establish\n\nthat Medtronic’s alleged failure to warn caused Caroline’s injury. In other words,\n\nthrough the learned intermediary doctrine, Medtronic maintains that the allegedly\n\ninadequate warnings—which Dr. Dandona admittedly did not see or read—could not\n\nhave caused Caroline’s injury, and thus the company cannot be held liable for its\n\nalleged failure to warn. (See id. (arguing that when the physician would have\n\n\n                                           93\n\fprescribed the medical device regardless of what he “may have read or not read,” or\n\n“when the prescribing physician did not read, or rely upon, the warnings that were\n\nactually provided, there can . . . be no liability”).)\n\n       This Court rejects Medtronic’s conclusion that there is no genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact related to its potential liability for the allegedly faulty labels and\n\ninstructions that purportedly failed to warn Caroline, her parents, and Dr. Dandona of\n\nthe risks pertaining to improper use of the MMT-396 Infusion Set for at least two\n\nreasons. First of all, the case law makes clear that, for the learned intermediate doctrine\n\nto absolve a manufacturer, the warning that is given to the professional must be\n\nadequate. See McNeil v. Wyeth, 462 F.3d 364, 368 (5th Cir. 2006 (“[E]ven in the\n\ncontext of a learned intermediary, if the warning to the intermediary is inadequate or\n\nmisleading, the manufacturer remains liable for injuries sustained by the ultimate user.”\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Patteson, 876 F. Supp. 2d at 34 (holding\n\nthat if the manufacturer “properly warns a prescribing physician of the dangerous\n\npropensities of its product, the manufacturer is excused from warning each patient”\n\n(emphasis added)). The adequacy of the label and insert that Medtronic provided with\n\nthe MMT-396 Infusion Set is indisputably still at issue in this case, which plainly\n\nprecludes summary judgment in Medtronic’s favor on learned intermediary grounds.\n\nSee Payne, 486 A.2d at 723 (“[I]n cases in which there is a potential for serious injury,\n\nthe adequacy of even a relatively clear warning should not be determined as a matter of\n\nlaw but is a question of fact for the jury[.]”).\n\n       Second, and possibly even more significant, while Medtronic is correct to\n\nobserve that the professional’s actual reliance on the allegedly inadequate information\n\n\n\n\n                                              94\n\fthat a manufacturer provides is key to assessing causation, see Patteson, 876 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 34 (“An inadequate warning alone, however, is not enough; the learned-\n\nintermediary doctrine also requires that the inadequate warning be a ‘producing cause’\n\nof the plaintiff’s injury.”), Medtronic has not successfully established that there is no\n\ngenuine issue of fact regarding causation in the instant case. This is primarily because,\n\nalthough Dr. Dandona did testify that he did not review or rely upon the instructions for\n\nthe infusion set (see Dep. of Paresh Dandona (“Dandona Dep.”). Ex. 5 to Pls.’ Opp’n,\n\nECF No. 138-7, at 7:16–20), his sworn testimony reveals that Dr. Dandona was not the\n\nmedical professional who was responsible for reviewing Medtronic’s materials and\n\nexplaining to patients how to use the device. In response to a direct deposition question\n\nabout whether or not he had “ever reviewed [] the instructions for use for . . . the\n\ninfusion set?” Dr. Dandona stated:\n\n                 No. I’m – I’m not into the technology of each individual\n          pump. It’s too much. And that function is given to the CDEs,\n          who are the pump trainers, and they have all the details of that.\n                 So I sort of decide on the policy of installing a pump, the\n          kind of infusion rates that should be appropriate for a patient,\n          but the rest of the functions are carried out by the educators.\n\n(Id. at 7:19–8:2.) Thus, the record makes crystal clear that Dr. Dandona viewed his role\n\nas determining the overall “policy of installing a pump” and setting “the kind of\n\ninfusion rates that should be appropriate for a patient,” and that he delegated the\n\ntechnical responsibility of providing patients with instructions for using the prescribed\n\ninsulin-delivery device properly to agents he calls “pump trainers.” Yet, to this Court’s\n\nknowledge, the pump trainers have not testified in the context of this matter, so nothing\n\nin the record establishes that the pump trainers who instructed Caroline on how to use\n\nthe infusion set eschewed reading or relying upon the allegedly inadequate instructions\n\n\n\n                                            95\n\fand warnings that Medtronic included in the infusion set packaging. Furthermore,\n\nunder District of Columbia law, there is a presumption that the functional user of a\n\ndevice (here, the trainers) would have read the manufacturers’ instructions and would\n\nhave known how to use the device based on those instructions, in the absence of any\n\nevidence about what the trainers actually knew and said. See Payne, 486 A.2d at 725\n\n(explaining that the law presumes that “the user would have read an adequate warning,\n\nand that in the absence of evidence rebutting the presumption, a jury may find that the\n\ndefendant’s product was the producing cause of the plaintiff’s injury”).\n\n       Consequently, on the record the parties have provided, a reasonable jury might\n\nwell conclude that Medtronic’s infusion set instructions (imparted to Caroline by the\n\npump trainers) were inadequate and ultimately caused Caroline’s injury, despite Dr.\n\nDandona’s testimony regarding his own personal lack of review and reliance on any\n\nsuch instructions when he prescribed the device to Caroline. Put another way, contrary\n\nto Medtronic’s contentions, it was Caroline’s pump trainer, not Dr. Dandona, who was\n\nthe pertinent ‘learned intermediary’ for the purpose of Plaintiffs’ failure to warn claim,\n\nand thus, Dr. Dandona’s testimony about his own personal lack of reliance on\n\nMedtronic’s materials (without regard to what the agents who served as the relevant\n\ninstructing professionals for present purposes relied upon) is manifestly insufficient to\n\nbreak the chain of causation between the allegedly inadequate instructions and\n\nCaroline’s injury as a matter of law.\n\n\n\n\n                                            96\n\f       B.      Medtronic Is Entitled To Summary Judgment On Plaintiffs’\n               Breach Of Express Warranty Claim Because The Statements\n               On Which Plaintiffs Rely Do Not Create An Actionable\n               Warranty\n\n       Medtronic also insists that summary judgment is warranted with respect to the\n\nthe MMT-396 Infusion Set breach of warranty claims that Plaintiffs have brought. (See\n\nMedtronic’s Mem. at 67–68; Medtronic’s Reply at 30–31.) 28 As clarified in Plaintiffs’\n\nopposition brief, the Kubickis allege that Medtronic warrantied that the MMT-396\n\nInfusion Set was safe and functional through advertising and promotional statements\n\nabout that product, and Medtronic also represented that design modifications to the\n\nventing system made the insulin-deilvery system safer, but that turned out not to be so.\n\n(See Pls.’ Opp’n at 81–82 (pointing to statements that Medtronic made in advertising\n\nmaterials, including that Medtronic infusion sets “ensure success”; that the vents in the\n\np-cap would reduce “clogging and malfunction”; and that Medtronic infusion sets “are\n\nmade with patented tubing, which is clog and kink resistant, assuring that the insulin is\n\nbeing safely delivered” (quoting Medtronic Infusion Set Brochure, Ex. 65 to Pls.’\n\nOpp’n, ECF No. 138-68, at 3).) 29 As explained below, this Court finds that Medtronic\n\nis entitled to summary judgment on these express warranty claims, because the\n\nstatements to which Plaintiffs point do not amount to an enforceable warranty.\n\n\n\n28\n   This Court has already held that any warranty claims relating to the MMT-522 Pump are expressly\npreempted. See supra Part VII.B.\n29\n   Notably, the Kubickis’ express warranty contentions, which reference Medtronic’s advertising and\npromotional materials, differ from the complaint’s related claim that Medtronic included an express\nwarranty in the product packaging for the MMT-396 Infusion Set. (See 2d Am. Compl. ¶ 160.)\nPlaintiffs appear to have abandoned their product-packaging express warranty claim, as they have not\ncountered Medtronic’s representation that the infusion set lots at issue in this case “were not\naccompanied by any warranty.” (Medtronic’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 27; see also Pls.’ Opp’n at 81–82\n(arguing that, with respect to the infusion set, a warranty existed as a result of statements made in\nadvertisements).)\n\n\n\n                                                  97\n\f       In order to succeed on a breach of warranty claim under District of Columbia\n\nlaw, a plaintiff must prove “that the defendant breached an express promise made about\n\nthe product sold.” Witherspoon v. Philip Morris Inc., 964 F. Supp. 455, 464 (D.D.C.\n\n1997). The D.C. Code explains that an enforceable express warranty arises when the\n\nseller makes to the buyer “(a) [a]ny affirmation of fact or promise . . . which relates to\n\nthe goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain” or “(b) [a]ny description of the\n\ngoods which is made part of the basis of the bargain[.]” D.C. Code § 28:2-313(1). In\n\neither case, such an expression “creates an express warranty that the goods shall\n\nconform to the [description], affirmation or promise.” Id. An express warranty can\n\nexist even if the seller does not use the words “warrant” or “guarantee,” but it is well\n\nestablished that “an affirmation merely of the value of the goods or a statement\n\npurporting to be merely the seller’s opinion or commendation of the goods does not\n\ncreate a warranty.” D.C. Code. § 28:2-313(2). Furthermore, when the plaintiff alleges\n\nonly that a manufacturer’s “advertisements and promotionals statements contained\n\nbroad claims amounting to a warranty[,]” the alleged breach of warranty claim cannot\n\nsurvive. Witherspoon, 964 F. Supp. at 465 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks\n\nand citation omitted); see also, e.g., Forouzesh v. Starbucks Co., No. CV 16-3830, 2016\n\nWL 4443203, at * 4 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 19, 2016) (dismissing breach of warranty claim\n\npredicated on the defendant’s representations that its beverages were sold “in cups of\n\nvarious sizes[,]” because a reasonable consumer would not have interpreted the\n\ndefendant’s representation to be an affirmation of fact or description regarding the\n\n“specific amount of liquid” in the cups); Hubbard v. Gen. Motors Corp., No.\n\n95Civ.4362, 1996 WL 274018, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. May 22, 1996) (holding that statements\n\n\n\n\n                                            98\n\fmade in advertisements that vehicles are “the most dependable, long-lasting trucks on\n\nthe planet” constituted “puffery” rather than an actionable warranty regarding vehicle’s\n\nbraking system, particularly where the statements made “no reference whatsoever to the\n\ntype or quality of the vehicles’ braking system”).\n\n       Here, it is clear to this Court that any warranty claim that is based on the\n\nstatements in Medtronic’s advertising materials to which Plaintiffs point to fails as a\n\nmatter of law, due to the nature of the statements at issue. For example, Plaintiffs\n\ncontend that Medtronic warrantied the MMT-396 Infusion Set’s p-cap vent design by\n\nasserting that the vents in the p-cap would reduce “clogging and malfunction” and that\n\nMedtronic infusion sets “are made with patented tubing, which is clog and kink\n\nresistant, assuring that the insulin is being safely delivered” (see Pls.’ Opp’n at 81–82\n\n(quoting Medtronic Infusion Set Brochure in the advertising materials)), but such a\n\ngeneralized endorsement of the product’s purportedly superior structure is not a fact-\n\nbased promise that the product will perform in a certain way. See Witherspoon, 964 F.\n\nSupp. at 464; Hoffman v. A.B. Chance Co., 339 F. Supp. 1385, 1387 (M.D. Pa. 1972)\n\n(holding that advertisements representing that a brake lock device “offered\n\nunprecedented safety” did not create an actionable warranty). Indeed, to qualify as an\n\nexpress promise of the type that is enforceable as a warranty, the manufacturer must do\n\nmore than make generalized statements commending the product; instead, it must\n\narticulate verifiable facts about product performance, such that lack of conformity with\n\nthose representations can plausibly be established. See, e.g., City of Wyoming v.\n\nProcter & Gamble Co., No. 15-2101, 2016 WL 5496321, at *9–10 (D. Minn. Sept. 28,\n\n2016) (holding that packaging and advertising statements describing wet wipes as\n\n\n\n\n                                            99\n\f“flushable” were “affirmations of fact” sufficient to create an express warranty). By\n\ncontrast, Medtronic’s statements about the MMT-396 Infusion Set appear to this\n\nCourt’s eye to be more in the nature of advertising “puffery,” see Pearson v. Chung,\n\n961 A.2d 1067, 1076 (D.C. 2008), rather than specific affirmations of fact upon which a\n\nreasonable consumer could reasonably rely and ultimately seek to enforce.\n\n       In this regard, In re General Motors Corp. Anti–Lock Brake Products Liability\n\nLitigation, 966 F. Supp. 1525 (E.D. Mo. 1997), is instructive. In that case, plaintiffs\n\nsought to assert a breach of warranty claim against General Motors, arguing that\n\nGeneral Motors’s advertising statements that a vehicles’ crash avoidance system was\n\n“99 percent more effective” than a crash protection system, and that “[a] driver is 100\n\ntimes more likely to benefit from a vehicle’s crash-avoidance capabilities (such as anti-\n\nlock brakes) than from its crash-survival capabilities (such as air bags)[,]” created a\n\nwarranty that the vehicles’ systems were free of safety defects, and that General Motors\n\nhad breached this warranty because the systems were defective and not, in fact, safe.\n\nId. at 1531. The court dismissed this warranty claim, finding that “comparative claims\n\n[such as these], often involving large numbers, are puffing because a consumer cannot\n\nreasonably believe that there is a test behind the claims.” Id.; cf. In re XM Satellite\n\nRadio Holdings Sec. Litig., 479 F. Supp. 2d 165, 180 (D.D.C. 2007) (dismissing\n\nsecurities fraud claim that was predicated on adverting statements because “generalized\n\npositive statements about ‘cost effective,’ ‘smart,’ ‘sound’ and ‘efficient’ growth are\n\nvague and incapable of objective verification, they are not the type of statement upon\n\nwhich a reasonable investor would rely” and instead constitute mere “puffery”); Hoyte\n\nv. Yum! Brands, Inc., 489 F. Supp. 2d 24, 30 (D.D.C. 2007) (granting motion to\n\n\n\n\n                                            100\n\fdismiss negligent misrepresentation claim based on “KFC’s claims that its restaurants\n\nserve the ‘best food’” because such a statement “is a non-measurable, ‘bald statement of\n\nsuperiority’ that is non-actionable puffery”).\n\n       The bottom line is this: in this Court’s considered judgment, much of the\n\nadvertising language that Plaintiffs say gives rise to their breach of warranty claims\n\nactually dooms these allegations, because instead of essentially guaranteeing that the\n\nMMT-396 Infusion Set will operate a certain specified way, Medtronic’s statements\n\nappear to be merely the type of general commendation that courts have long held does\n\nnot create an enforceable warranty. See Witherspoon, 964 F. Supp. at 464.\n\n       C.     While Medtronic Is Entitled To Summary Judgment On\n              Plaintiffs’ Stand-Alone Punitive Damages Claim, It Is\n              Premature To Foreclose Punitive Damages As A Remedy\n\n       Finally, Medtronic argues that summary judgment should be entered in its favor\n\nwith respect to Plaintiffs’ punitive damages claims. (See Medtronic Mem. at 68–70.)\n\nPlaintiffs’ complaint alleges that all of Medtronic’s failures and deficiencies with\n\nrespect to the medical devices at issue in this case were malicious, willful, and wanton,\n\nand that the company has acted without regard for the safety of others—facts that,\n\nPlaintiffs say, entitle them to an award of punitive damages. (See 2d Am. Compl.\n\n¶¶ 254–259.) See also Rogers v. Ingersoll-Rand Co., 971 F. Supp. 4, 12 (D.D.C. 1997)\n\n(“Punitive damages are properly awarded where the act of the defendant is accompanied\n\nby fraud, ill will, recklessness, wantonness, oppressiveness, willful disregard of the\n\nplaintiff’s rights, or other circumstances tending to aggravate the injury.”). To the\n\nextent that Plaintiffs seek punitive damages as a separate cause of action, Medtronic’s\n\nmotion is well-founded, and this Court can easily dispose of such claims, as it is clear\n\nbeyond cavil that the District of Columbia only recognizes punitive damages as a\n\n\n                                           101\n\fremedy and not an independent cause of action. See, e.g., Mitchell v. E. Sav. Bank,\n\nFSB, 890 F. Supp. 2d 104, 110 (D.D.C. 2012); Gharib v. Wolf, 518 F. Supp. 2d 50, 56\n\n(D.D.C. 2007) (citing Int’l Kitchen Exhaust Cleaning Ass’n v. Power Washers of N.\n\nAm., 81 F. Supp. 2d 70, 74 (D.D.C. 2000)). Therefore, and on this basis alone,\n\nMedtronic is entitled to summary judgment on Counts XXI, XXII, and XXIII of\n\nPlaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint.\n\n       However, notably, nothing in this Court’s decision should be construed as\n\nprecluding Plaintiffs from seeking punitive damages as a remedy at the appropriate\n\ntime. That is, insofar as Medtronic argues that no such remedy is available on the\n\ncurrent record (see Medtronic’s Mem. at 69–70), the parties are reminded that the\n\nrecord is subject to further development in this case, because they have yet to engage in\n\nexpert discovery. (See supra Part V.) This Court will not accept Medtronic’s\n\nsuggestion that it evaluate—and foreclose completely—any punitive damages remedy\n\nnow; instead, the Court will await future discussion of the appropriateness of Plaintiffs’\n\nrequest for punitive damages in the context of the parties’ preparations for trial. Cf.\n\nD.C. Std. Civ. Jury Instr. Nos. 13-12, 16-2, 16-3.\n\n\nIX.    CONCLUSION\n\n       The facts of this matter are relatively straightforward—a tragic, devastating\n\ninjury purportedly caused by Defendants’ allegedly tortious conduct with respect to a\n\nwidely marketed insulin-delivery device—but the intersection of law and life can be\n\nquite complicated. Even prior to engaging in expert discovery, Medtronic and\n\nUnomedical have vigorously maintained that the Kubickis cannot persist with the\n\nvarious state law claims they have filed pertaining to the MMT-522 Pump and MMT-\n\n\n\n                                           102\n\f396 Infusion Set for several nuanced reasons, and having carefully reviewed the parties’\n\nsummary judgment filings and the exhibits thereto, as well as their statements of fact,\n\nthis Court agrees with Defendants with respect to certain claims, and disagrees with\n\nrespect to others. For the reasons explained at length above, the Court finds that\n\nUnomedical is entitled to summary judgment with respect to all of the claims Plaintiffs\n\nhave brought against it on timeliness grounds, and Medtronic is entitled to summary\n\njudgment with respect to certain claims, as follows: (1) all of Plaintiffs’ claims that\n\npertain to the MMT-522 Pump, except Plaintiffs’ manufacturing defect claim, (2)\n\nPlaintiffs’ claims that Medtronic failed to report to the FDA adverse events regarding\n\nthe MMT-396 Infusion Set in violation of state law, (3) Plaintiffs’ breach of warranty\n\nclaims, and (4) Plaintiffs’ stand-alone claim for punitive damages. However, the Court\n\nconcludes that genuine issues of material fact remain with respect to Plaintiffs’\n\nnegligent design, manufacture, labeling, and failure to warn consumers claims relating\n\nto the MMT-396 Infusion Set, and that there are also triable issues of fact with respect\n\nto causation—at least for now. Thus, as set forth in the accompanying order,\n\nUnomedical’s Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED, Medtronic’s\n\nMotion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part, and the\n\nparties are ordered to submit a joint proposed schedule for expert discovery.\n\n\n\nDATE: February 5, 2018                    Ketanji Brown Jackson\n                                          KETANJI BROWN JACKSON\n                                          United States District Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                           103\n\f",

INTRODUCTION\n\n       This complex products-liability action arises out of a tragic event in the life of\n\nCaroline Kubicki, a Type-I diabetic who began using a mechanical pump and an\n\nassociated infusion set to administer the insulin necessary to manage her diabetes when\n\nshe was 12 years old. Caroline was 19 and a sophomore at George Washington\n\nUniversity (“GW”) in early September of 2007, when she experienced severe\n\nhypoglycemia in her dormitory room and suffered a traumatic brain injury as a result of\n\nthe low blood sugar levels. Caroline currently resides in a group home in a persistent\n\nvegetative state, and her parents, John and Karen Kubicki (“Plaintiffs” or “the\n\nKubickis”), have filed the instant lawsuit against the company that designed and\n\nmanufactured the insulin pump and a component of the associated infusion set that\n\nCaroline was using at the time of the incident—Medtronic, Inc.—along with certain of\n\nits subsidiaries, Medtronic Diabetes and Medtronic MiniMed, Inc. (collectively,\n\n“Medtronic”). The Kubickis have also sued Unomedical Devices SA de CV, the\n\nmanufacturer and assembler of the infusion set, and one of that company’s affiliates,\n\nUnomedical A/S (collectively, “Unomedical”).\n\n       The Kubickis’ amended complaint contains 25 state law claims that concern two\n\nmedical devices: the Medtronic MiniMed Paradigm® Insulin Pump Model MMT-522\n\n(“the MMT-522 Pump”) and the Medtronic MiniMed Paradigm® Quick-set Infusion\n\nSet, Model MMT-396 (“the MMT-396 Infusion Set”). (See Second Am. Compl. (“2nd\n\nAm. Compl.”), ECF No. 124, ¶¶ 6, 20.) The complaint’s myriad claims can generally\n\nbe grouped into five categories. The first five counts (hereinafter referred to as “the\n\fnegligence claims”) generally allege that the defendants committed common law\n\nnegligence with respect to the design and manufacturing of both the MMT-522 Pump\n\nand the MMT-396 Infusion Set, and that defendants breached both the duty to provide\n\nadequate consumer instructions, labels, and warnings with respect to these devices, and\n\nthe duty to take “reasonable care in documenting, logging, investigating, and reporting\n\nto the FDA” public complaints about these devices. (Id. ¶ 91; see id. ¶¶ 88–117\n\n(Counts I–V).) Counts VI through X cast similar allegations as common law “strict\n\nliability” claims (see, e.g., id. ¶ 149 (contending that defendants “sold the [insulin-\n\ndelivery devices] to Ms. Kubicki in a defective condition what was unreasonably\n\ndangerous to consumers”); see also id. ¶¶ 118–152 (Counts VI–X)), while Counts XI\n\nthrough XV (hereinafter the “express warranty claims”) assert that each defendant\n\nbreached an express warranty upon which Caroline, her parents, and her physicians\n\nrelied (see id. ¶¶ 153–203). The final two groups of claims in the complaint (the\n\n“failure to warn” claims) allege that the defendants failed to warn users and the FDA\n\n“of the foreseeable harm associated with the use” of the insulin-delivery devices (id.\n\n¶ 205; see id. ¶¶ 204–253 (Counts XVI–XX)), and that the Kubickis are entitled to\n\n“punitive damages” because each defendant company “acted maliciously, willfully,\n\nwantonly, and recklessly without regard to the safety of others” (id. ¶ 262; see id.\n\n¶¶ 254–263 (Counts XXI–XXV)). To date, the parties have completed fact discovery—\n\nbut not expert discovery—in this matter, and Plaintiffs have pared down the charges\n\nagainst Unomedical, such that the only claims remaining against the Unomedical\n\ndefendants are the failure to warn claims that appear in the complaint both as separate\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\fclaims and as part of the negligence and strict liability theories. (See Mot. Hr’g Tr.,\n\nECF No. 152, at 5:5–6:1 (Nov. 3, 2016).)\n\n        Before this Court at present are two motions for summary judgment that\n\nMedtronic and Unomedical have filed. (See Medtronic Mot. for Summ. J. or, in the\n\nAlternative, for Partial Summ. J. (“Medtronic’s MSJ”), ECF No. 133; Unomedical Mot.\n\nfor Summ. J. (“Unomedical’s MSJ”), ECF No. 134.) 1 Plaintiffs oppose these motions,\n\nbut have not cross-moved for summary judgment. (See Pls.’ Opp’n to Defs.’ Mots. for\n\nSumm. J. (“Pls.’ Opp’n”), ECF No. 141.) Medtronic first argues that Plaintiffs cannot\n\nestablish the requisite causation because, among other things, the existing record\n\nevidence definitively establishes that Caroline was not wearing her insulin pump at the\n\ntime of the hypoglycemic incident. 2 In addition, Medtronic also maintains that the\n\nKubickis’ common law tort and express warranty claims are entirely preempted and/or\n\nbarred by the applicable statutes of limitations (see Mem. in Support of Medtronic’s\n\nMot. for Summ. J. or, in the alternative, for Partial Summ. J. (“Medtronic’s Mem.”),\n\nECF No. 133-1, at 31–62), and Medtronic further contends that, because the record\n\ncontains no evidence of intentional wrongdoing, it is entitled to summary judgment on\n\nthe punitive damages counts (id. at 63–70). Unomedical’s motion for summary\n\njudgment argues that the failure to warn claims it faces are untimely and impliedly\n\n\n\n\n1\n Page numbers cited herein, except for transcript and deposition citations, refer to those that the\nCourt’s electronic case-filing system automatically assigns.\n2\n  Medtronic’s motion for summary judgment references an expert declaration from Helena W. Rodbard,\nM.D., FACP, MACE, which sets forth Dr. Rodbard’s expert opinion regarding various other potential\ncauses of Caroline Kubicki’s injuries. (See Decl. of Helena W. Rodbard (“Rodbard Decl.”), ECF No.\n133-6.) Because the parties have yet to engage in expert discovery, this Court previously granted\nPlaintiffs’ motion to strike the portions of this declaration (and related briefing) that suggest possible\nalternative causes of Caroline’s hypoglycemic event. (See Min. Order of Apr. 8, 2016.)\n\n\n\n                                                    3\n\fpreempted, and it also presses the same causation and punitive damages arguments that\n\nMedtronic makes. (See Mem. in Support of Unomedical’s Mot. for Summ. J.\n\n(“Unomedical’s Mem.”), ECF No. 134-1, at 25–34, 37–47.)\n\n       This Court has carefully parsed the defendants’ myriad summary judgment\n\narguments regarding causation, timeliness, preemption, and other issues, along with the\n\nprior written ruling of the Court that resolved the Medtronic defendants’ initial motion\n\nto dismiss. See Kubicki v. Medtronic, No. 12cv0734, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1739580</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.D.C. Mar.\n\n21, 2013). As explained fully below, this Court now concludes that Medtronic’s\n\nMotion for Summary Judgment must be GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN\n\nPART, and that Unomedical’s Motion for Summary Judgment must be GRANTED in\n\nfull. In sum, this Court has determined that neither defendant is entitled to summary\n\njudgment on causation grounds at this point in the litigation (prior to expert discovery),\n\nbut that summary judgment can and will be entered in Unomedical’s favor on the basis\n\nof the statute of limitations. The Court will also grant summary judgment to Medtronic\n\nwith respect to certain claims in the complaint—i.e., all claims that pertain to the\n\nMMT-522 Pump (with the exception of Plaintiffs’ manufacturing defect claim) and the\n\nfailure to report claims that relate to the MMT-396 Infusion Set—because federal law\n\neither expressly or impliedly preempts such claims. In addition, the Court will grant\n\nMedtronic’s motion for summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ breach of warranty claim\n\nbecause the statements on which Plaintiffs predicate their claim do not create an\n\nactionable warranty. The Court will also grant Medtronic’s motion for summary\n\njudgment with respect to Plaintiffs’ stand-alone claim for punitive damages, because\n\nD.C. law does not recognize such a claim, but the Court finds that any ruling on the\n\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\favailability of punitive damages as a remedy is premature prior to the completion of\n\nexpert discovery. This Court sees no other basis for granting summary judgment in\n\nMedtronic’s favor with respect to the remaining infusion set claims (negligent design,\n\nmanufacture, and labeling, and failure to warn) at this time. However, Medtronic can\n\nseek summary judgment on causation grounds upon the parties’ completion of expert\n\ndiscovery.\n\n        A separate Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion will follow.\n\n\nII.     FACTS RELATED TO CAROLINE AND HER INJURIES\n\n        A.      The Hypoglycemic Event\n\n        Caroline was diagnosed with Type I diabetes at the age of six, and was first\n\nprescribed an insulin pump in March of 2001, at age 12, after she had experienced\n\ndifficulty controlling her blood glucose levels with self-administered insulin shots.\n\n(See Medtronic’s Stmt. of Undisputed Material Facts (“Medtronic’s Stmt. of Facts”),\n\nECF No. 133-2, ¶¶ 13–14, 17; see also Pls.’ Stmt. of Genuine Issues of Material Fact\n\n(“Pls.’ Stmt. of Facts”), ECF No. 138-70, ¶¶ 8–9) (noting that Caroline had experienced\n\nthree hypoglycemic events prior to receiving a prescription for the insulin pump in\n\n2001).) 3 In October of 2006, Caroline’s physician, Dr. Paresh Dandona, prescribed\n\nCaroline the MMT-522 Pump and the MMT-396 Infusion Set that are at issue in this\n\ncase. (See Dep. of John Kubicki (“J. Kubicki Dep.”), Ex. E to Decl. of Michael K.\n\nBrown (“Brown Decl.”), ECF No. 133-5 at 67–92, at 114:6–14.) Nearly one year\n\n\n3\n  The pancreas of an individual with Type I diabetes is unable to produce insulin, which is a hormone\nthat allows the body to process glucose. (See Medtronic’s Stmt. of Facts, ¶ 1.) Type I diabetics rely on\ndaily doses of insulin to control their levels of blood glucose and to prevent hypoglycemia (blood\nglucose levels that are too low) and hyperglycemia (blood glucose levels that are too high). (See id.\n¶¶ 1, 3.)\n\n\n\n                                                   5\n\flater—sometime between the late evening of September 8, 2007, and the early morning\n\nof September 9, 2007—Caroline experienced the hypoglycemic event that gives rise to\n\nthe claims at issue here. (See Unomedical’s Stmt. of Material Facts as to Which There\n\nIs No Genuine Issue (“Unomedical’s Stmt. of Facts”), ECF No. 132-10, ¶ 34.)\n\n      Although there are gaps in the timeline, the following basic facts are undisputed.\n\nCaroline and her roommate, Magdelena Posthumus, were together in their shared dorm\n\nroom on GW’s campus from approximately 7:00 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. on the evening of\n\nSeptember 8, 2007. (See Dep. of Magdelena E. Posthumus (“Posthumus Dep.”), Ex. G\n\nto Brown Decl., ECF No. 139-1 at 68–82, at 58:4–59:2.) During that time, Posthumus\n\nobserved Caroline napping, waking and eating a bowl of cereal, and then returning to\n\nbed. (See id.) The various data points that Caroline’s parents were able to retrieve\n\nfrom Caroline’s pump and glucometer indicate that Caroline’s blood sugar level was 77\n\nmg/dL at approximately 7:02 p.m., and that Caroline gave herself six units of insulin at\n\napproximately 8:30 p.m. (See Dep. of Karen Kubicki (“K. Kubicki Dep.”), Ex. F to\n\nBrown Decl., ECF No. 133-5 at 94–106, at 129:20–130:8; J. Kubicki Dep. at 212:3–24;\n\nsee also Handwritten Glucometer Readings, Ex. 21 to K. Kubicki Dep., ECF 133-5, at\n\n117.) Posthumus left the dorm for a couple of hours beginning at around 11:00 p.m.,\n\nand Caroline was sleeping both when Posthumus left and when she returned around\n\n12:30 a.m. (See Posthumus Dep. at 60:3–61:20.) At 8:00 a.m. the following morning,\n\nPosthumus discovered Caroline in distress in her bed; Caroline was foaming at the\n\nmouth and was otherwise unresponsive. (See Medtronic’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 28.)\n\n      Posthumus immediately notified a resident advisor, Siobhan Chapman, who in\n\nturn notified another resident advisor, Rebecca Barloon. (See Dep. of Rebecca Barloon\n\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\f(“Barloon Dep.”), Ex. 1 to Pls.’ Opp’n, ECF No. 138-3, at 42:21–23.) Posthumus also\n\ncalled 911 and reported that Caroline was unconscious and vomiting. (See GW Police\n\nDep’t Incident Report, Ex. 11 to Pls.’ Opp’n, ECF No. 138-13, at 2.) Emergency\n\npersonnel responded, and when they checked Caroline’s blood sugar, it registered at 20\n\nmg/dL—an extraordinarily low level. (See DCFEMS Incident Report, Ex. 13 to Pls.’\n\nOpp’n, ECF No. 138-15, at 3.) The paramedics gave Caroline an emergency injection\n\nof glucose, and then transported her to GW Hospital, where doctors administered\n\nfurther glucose; however, none of these efforts changed Caroline’s condition. (See id.;\n\nGW Hosp. Recs., Ex. 2 to Pls.’ Opp’n, ECF No. 138-4, at 6.) At GW Hospital, a CT\n\nhead scan revealed that Caroline was suffering from “diffuse cerebral edema.” (GW\n\nHosp. Recs. at 2.) 4 Caroline now resides in a nursing facility in a persistent vegetative\n\nstate, with no realistic possibility of recovery. (See Mot. Hr’g Tr. at 9:23–10:8.)\n\n       The readings that Plaintiffs were able to recover from Caroline’s glucometer\n\nshowed that Caroline’s insulin levels had fluctuated in the days leading up to her\n\ninjury—from a low of 43 mg/dL to a high of 568 mg/dL. (See Handwritten Glucometer\n\nReadings.) The full set of data could not be recovered from the MMT-522 Pump’s\n\nmemory because Mr. Kubicki removed the battery from the pump after a Medtronic\n\ncustomer service representative told him that doing so would not impact the data saved\n\non the device. (See Tr. of Tele. Call, Ex. 17 to Pls.’ Opp’n, ECF No. 138-19, at 9.)\n\nThe parties conducted joint non-destructive testing of Caroline’s pump, which did not\n\n\n\n4\n  “A CT scan is a computed tomography scan, also referred to as a CAT scan or computed axial\ntomography scan.

(See Pls.’ Opp’n at 67–68.) 5 The MMT-396 Infusion Set that\n\nCaroline was using was discarded at an unknown time shortly after Caroline’s injury,\n\nand therefore the parties were not able to conduct any testing on that device. (See K.\n\nKubicki Dep. at 322:14–325:16.)\n\n        In the days after the hypoglycemic event, the Kubickis began gathering\n\ninformation in an attempt to determine what had caused Caroline’s blood sugar to drop\n\nso low. Their efforts included speaking to Caroline’s treating physicians at GW\n\nHospital, one of whom suggested to the Kubickis that they preserve and test the MMT-\n\n522 Pump because it appeared that Caroline had suffered an insulin overdose. (See J.\n\nKubicki Dep. at 23:25–25:13.) The Kubickis collected and retained Caroline’s medical\n\nsupplies, including the packaging materials for the discarded infusion set, and they\n\nconsulted with an attorney approximately five weeks after the incident. (See id. at\n\n22:22–23:18.)\n\n        B.      The Medtronic Paradigm Insulin Pump Model MMT-522 And\n                The Medtronic MiniMed Paradigm Quick-set Infusion Set,\n                Model MMT-396\n\n                1.      The Design And Operation Of These Medical Devices\n\n        The MMT-522 Pump is an FDA-regulated, insulin-pumping medical device that a\n\npatient wears outside her body. The device both monitors the patient’s blood glucose\n\nlevels and delivers insulin at rates that the patient programs. (See Decl. of Donna\n\nTwisdom (“Twisdom Decl.”), ECF No. 35-4, ¶ 3.) The MMT-522 Pump and the MMT-\n\n\n\n\n5\n  The only reported abnormality was the pump’s registering of an alarm code for “A45 Alarm after\nPrime/A33 Test.” (Pls.’ Opp’n at 19.) The record does not reveal what this alarm code means, but\nPlaintiffs represent that they “have reason to believe that it is triggered based on the amount of insulin\ndelivered by the Insulin Pump.” (Id. at 19 n.7.)\n\n\n                                                     8\n\f396 Infusion Set work together as a system, and appear as follows when attached to a\n\npatient:\n\n\n\n\n       Generally speaking, the insulin pump works by delivering background insulin\n\nthroughout the day according to the “basal rate” that the user sets, and the user can also\n\ngive herself a dose of insulin (called a “bolus”) on demand when she eats. (See Mot.\n\nHr’g Tr. at 59:21–60:21.) A cylindrical reservoir housed in the pump contains the insulin\n\nitself, and the insulin is delivered to the body through the infusion set. The infusion\n\nset, which is a separate medical device, consists of a thin plastic tube that has a tubing\n\nconnector—called a “p-cap”—at one end; the p-cap connects the tube to the insulin\n\nreservoir. (See Decl. of Rabi Gharabli (“Gharabli Decl.”), ECF 132-1, ¶ 10.) On the\n\nother end of the tube, there is a small needle that the user inserts into her body. (See\n\nid.)\n\n       Notably, when the pump’s insulin reservoir needs to be refilled, the user must\n\nfollow a number of steps carefully to accomplish this goal successfully. Specifically,\n\nthe user must disconnect the infusion set from her body; remove the empty reservoir\n\n\n                                             9\n\ffrom the pump; fill a new reservoir with insulin from an insulin vial; rewind the pump;\n\ninsert the new reservoir into the pump; and push insulin through to the infusion set—all\n\nbefore reattaching the infusion set to her body. (See User Guide, Ex. B to Twisdom\n\nDecl., ECF No. 35-4, at 66–72.) The portion of the manual instructing users on how to\n\nfill the reservoir, disconnect the vial, and attach the infusion set in 2007 (when Caroline\n\nwas injured) is reproduced below:\n\n\n\n\n(Id. at 67.) Significantly for present purposes, when removing the vial from the\n\nreservoir, the user is required to keep the reservoir upright, and she must ensure that the\n\ninside of the p-cap connector and the top of the reservoir are not wet when they are\n\nreconnected. (See infra Part II.C.3.)\n\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\f       The design and operation of the infusion set’s p-cap connecter is at the center of\n\nthe products-liability claims in this case. As Medtronic describes it, this particular\n\nconnector is a marvel of biomedical mechanical engineering:\n\n              [it] contains four small one-way vent openings which provide\n              airflow to equalize the pressure in the reservoir compartment\n              with the surrounding atmospheric pressure. The p-cap vent\n              openings are covered by a polytetrafluoroethylene (“PTFE”)\n              membrane that allows air to flow in and out of the\n              compartment thus eliminating any pressure differential\n              between the insulin reservoir and the end of the infusion set\n              (such as may be created when completing a manual prime of\n              the pump or during a rapid and dramatic change in altitude).\n\n(Medtronic’s Mem. at 17 (citations omitted).) Notably, the p-cap’s vent covering is\n\ncomprised of two different materials: the PFTE membrane is only on the topside, while\n\nthe underside (the part of the p-cap that touches the reservoir) is comprised of\n\npolyester. (See Dep. of Mark Curtis (“Curtis Dep.”), Ex. 22 to Pls.’ Opp’n, ECF No.\n\n138-24, at 211:7–19.)\n\n       Medtronic purportedly adopted this vented p-cap design for its insulin pumps so\n\nthat the pump can be watertight. (See Dep. of Susan McConnell Montalvo (“McConnell\n\nDep.”), Ex. 20 to Pls.’ Opp’n, ECF No. 138-22, at 43:17–44:14, 49:15–20, 53:5–9.)\n\nThe proper functioning of the vents is key to ensuring that the reservoir maintains\n\nappropriate internal pressure and that the pump delivers insulin at the appropriate rates.\n\n(See id. at 49:17–20; 94:22–95:19.) If the pressure inside the reservoir is too high\n\n(which can occur if the vents are blocked), the stopper in the pump will push insulin\n\ninto the infusion set in order to achieve pressure equilibrium, even if the pump is not\n\nprogrammed to deliver that insulin, resulting in an unscheduled delivery of insulin.\n\n(See id. at 94:2–4; 96:6–19.)\n\n\n\n\n                                            11\n\f                 2.     The Approval, Manufacturing, And Marketing Of These\n                        Medical Devices\n\n         The MMT-522 Pump and MMT-396 Infusion Set are two of a number of medical\n\ndevices that Medtronic markets for the management of diabetes. In June of 1999, the\n\nFDA approved a PMA Application that Medtronic submitted for a precursor device—\n\nthe Guardian Continuous Glucose Monitoring System, which consisted of a Guardian\n\nRT sensor and an external machine that measured and recorded an individual’s glucose\n\nlevels. See PMA Application No. P980022, Summary of Safety & Effectiveness Data 6;\n\nsee also infra Part VII.A.1 (discussing the FDA’s “premarket approval” (“PMA”)\n\nprocess). This system did not include an insulin pump as a component.\n\n         Medtronic first released its “Paradigm” insulin pump system into the market in\n\n2001, and it received 510(k) approval for its Paradigm MMT-515 Insulin Pump in May\n\nof 2004. See 510(k) Premarket Notification. 7 Thereafter, in October of 2005,\n\nMedtronic sought “approval for modifications to the MMT 515/715 external insulin\n\npump and to the Guardian RT sensor to enable the pump to accept data from the sensor,\n\nand to enable the sensor to communicate directly to the pump.” (Ex. A. to Decl. of\n\nMark Faillance (“PMA Approval”), ECF No. 35-5, at 9.) The FDA approved this new,\n\ncombined system, known as the Paradigm Real Time System, through a PMA\n\nSupplement on April 7, 2006. (See Decl. of Mark Faillance (“Faillance Decl.”), ECF\n\n\n\n\n6\n    Available at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf/P980022B.pdf.\n7\n  Available at\nhttps://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm?ID=K040676\n\n\n\n\n                                                  12\n\fNo. 35-5, ¶ 8.) The pump component of this approved device is the Paradigm MMT-\n\n522. 8\n\n         The FDA cleared the MMT-396 Infusion Set, including the vented p-cap\n\nconnector that is at the center of this case, on June 7, 2001, through the 510(k)\n\nclearance process. (See Decl. of Mark O’Donnell (“O’Donnell Decl.”), ECF No. 133-3,\n\n¶ 8.) Medtronic designed and manufactured the p-cap connector, while Unomedical,\n\nwhich owns the 510(k) for the MMT-396 Infusion Set, designed and manufactured all\n\nthe other components of the MMT-396 Infusion Set. (See id. ¶¶ 8–9.) Printed on the\n\nexterior of the MMT-396 Infusion Set packaging is the notation, “Assembled for\n\nUnomedical AS in Mexico,” (Packaging Photos, Ex. 61 to Pls.’ Opp’n, ECF No. 138-\n\n63, at 2), and Unomedical’s name also appears on the instruction sheet for the MMT-\n\n396 Infusion Set (Infusion Set Instructions, Ex. F to Gharabli Decl., ECF No. 134-3, at\n\n22), as well as on the individual MMT-396 Infusion Sets themselves (Mot. Hr’g Tr.\n\n73:19–74:6).\n\n         Unomedical’s role with respect to the p-cap was limited to the assembling of its\n\nMMT-396 Infusion Set tubing with the p-cap that Medtronic provided. (See\n\nUnomedical’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 29.) Unomedical then provided the assembled MMT-396\n\nInfusion Set to Medtronic, which Medtronic in turn sold to users in connection with its\n\nline of Paradigm insulin pumps, including the MMT-522 Pump. (See id. ¶ 30;\n\nO’Donnell Decl. ¶ 9.) The MMT-522 Pump and MMT-396 Infusion Set are\n\n\n\n\n8\n  Medtronic claims that the FDA advised it to proceed through the PMA Supplement process rather\nthan the 510(k) process because “creation of a new pump that incorporated a continuous glucose\nmonitoring system software was a significant change, and the new pump would not be substantially\nequivalent to any existing or pre-amendment device.” (Faillance Decl. ¶ 7.)\n\n\n\n                                                13\n\fprescription-only devices (see Medtronic’s Stmt. of Fact, ECF No. 131-2, ¶¶ 7, 9),\n\nwhich means that the devices are “available to the public only through a physician and\n\nare to be [used] only under a physician’s supervision[.]” MacPherson v.

Infusion Set Recalls In 2009 And 2013\n\n                1.     2009 Return And Replace Recall Of The “Lot 8” Batch\n\n          On June 29, 2009, approximately 22 months after Caroline’s injury, Medtronic\n\nissued a recall for the “Lot 8” batch of its Paradigm infusion sets because of a possible\n\nmanufacturing defect. Specifically, Medtronic determined that a silicone lubricant used\n\nduring manufacturing could clog the vents in the p-cap of the infusion sets in the\n\nimpacted lot, and thus could cause the pump to deliver too much or too little insulin.\n\n(See Lot 8 Recall Notice, Ex. 26 to Pls.’ Opp’n, ECF No. 138-28.) Patients with\n\nimpacted infusion sets were instructed not to use them and to return the sets to\n\nMedtronic for replacements. (See id.) The MMT-396 Infusion Set that Caroline had at\n\nthe time of her injury did not come from Lot 8 and therefore would not have been part\n\nof this recall. (See Medtronic’s Resp. to Pls.’ Fourth Set of Reqs. for Produc., Ex. 28 to\n\nPls.’ Opp’n, ECF No. 138-30 at 4.)\n\n          In connection with the Lot 8 recall, Medtronic issued a “Questions & Answers”\n\nsheet in which it stated that all other Medtronic infusion sets were safe to use. (See\n\nQuestions & Answers Regarding the “Lot 8” Quick-set Induction Set Recall, Ex. 27 to\n\nPls.’ Opp’n, ECF No. 138-29, at 2–3.) Medtronic made no mention of Unomedical—\n\nwhich had manufactured the parts of the infusion set other than the p-cap and had\n\nassembled the infusion sets, as explained above—in the documents associated with this\n\nrecall.\n\n\n                                             14\n\f              2.       2013 Paradigm Infusion Set Recall\n\n       Four years after the Lot 8 recall, on June 7, 2013, Medtronic issued a broad\n\n“Class I recall” of its Paradigm infusion sets, including the MMT-396 Infusion Set that\n\nCaroline had owned at the time of her injury. (See Infusion Sets Recall Notice (“2013\n\nRecall Notice”), Ex. 18 to Pls.’ Opp’n, ECF No. 138-20, at 2.) Unlike the Lot 8 recall,\n\nthis recall did not involve replacement of the recalled device; rather, Medtronic\n\nprovided more information to users, explaining in the recall announcement that there\n\nwas a risk of under- or over-delivery of insulin if the top of the insulin reservoir or the\n\ninside of the p-cap becomes wet while the user is refilling the reservoir with insulin.\n\n(See id.) The impetus for this recall was Medtronic’s discovery (first through viewing\n\nvideos uploaded on YouTube) that some users were holding the insulin reservoir\n\nhorizontally when refilling it, which can result in fluid touching the inside of the p-cap\n\nand blocking the vents. (See E-Mail from S. Schriever (June 11, 2013), Ex. 57 to Pls.’\n\nOpp’n, ECF No. 138-59, at 2.) In the notification sent to pump users in connection with\n\nthe recall, Medtronic specifically instructed users to ensure that the insulin vial is\n\nupright when removing it from the reservoir in order to prevent liquid transfer to the p-\n\ncap, and it also declared that users should ensure that the reservoir tip and p-cap are dry\n\nbefore connecting them. (See Letter from Shirajul Karim (June 10, 2013) (“Dear User\n\nLetter”), Ex. 29 to Pls.’ Opp’n, ECF No. 138-31, at 2-3.) The recall notice identified\n\nUnomedical A/S as one of the manufacturers of the recalled infusion sets. (See 2013\n\nRecall Notice at 2.)\n\n       The pictures from the safety notification, which were issued to remind users\n\nabout the correct way to refill the reservoir, are reproduced below.\n\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\f                   Hold insulin vial upright when removing reservoir.\n\n\n\n\n                        Make sure these are dry when connecting.\n\n(Dear User Letter at 2–3.)\n\n       In the context of the instant litigation, Medtronic characterizes the issue that led\n\nto the 2013 infusion set recall as a “temporary blocked vent,” and it asserts that “[t]he\n\nprecise sequence of events required for the temporary blocked vent to occur (spilled\n\nfluid on the interior of the p-cap connector, saturation of all four vents, and excess\n\npressure building) make it a rare occurrence.” (Medtronic’s Mem. at 29.) Medtronic\n\nfurther maintains that it is even more unlikely that a temporary blocked vent will injure\n\nan infusion set user, because the user should have detached the pump and infusion set\n\nfrom herself while the reservoir was being refilled. (See id. at 29–30.) Medtronic\n\nclaims that it has received fewer than 100 complaints per year from users regarding\n\ntemporary blocked vents (out of approximately 425,000 pump users), and that it\n\n“implemented [the 2013 recall as a] voluntary field corrective action” after “becoming\n\n\n                                            16\n\faware of the sequence of events that could le[a]d to a temporary blocked vent[.]” (Id.\n\nat 29–30.)\n\n                3.      2013 FDA Warning Letter\n\n        On September 19, 2013, the FDA issued a formal “warning” letter to Medtronic\n\nfollowing an inspection of Medtronic’s Northridge, California office. (See Ex. 55 to\n\nPls.’ Opp’n (“2013 Warning Letter”), ECF No. 131-3.) This warning was purportedly\n\nbased on the agency’s finding that Medtronic had violated certain rules known as the\n\n“current good manufacturing process regulations” (“CGMPs”) with respect to its\n\nParadigm insulin pumps (including the MMT-522 model pumps) in a number of ways.\n\n(Id. at 2.) 9 The FDA cited various deficiencies, including Medtronic’s “[f]ailure to\n\nestablish and maintain procedures for implementing corrective and preventative action,\n\nas required by 21 C.F.R. 820.100(a)[,]” (id. at 3); “failure to identify actions needed to\n\ncorrect and prevent recurrence of the Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps (MMT-5XX,\n\n7XX) device failure” (id.); and “failure to review and evaluate all complaints to\n\ndetermine whether an investigation is necessary and to maintain a record that includes\n\nthe reason no investigation was made and the name of the individual responsible for the\n\ndecision not to investigate when no investigation is made” (id. at 5). The FDA also\n\nannounced the agency’s conclusion that, due to the 13 different CGMP violations the\n\nthat agency had found, Paradigm insulin pumps dating back to 2002 qualify as\n\n“adulterated” under 21 U.S.C. § 351(h), and also “misbranded under section 502(t)(2)\n\n\n\n\n9\n  CGMPs are general regulations that the FDA has promulgated which govern “the methods used in,\nand the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage,\ninstallation, and servicing of all finished devices intended for human use.” 21 C.F.R. § 820.1(a)(1).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  17\n\fof the Act.” (Id. at 2, 15.) None of the 13 CGMP violations that are discussed in the\n\nwarning letter pertain to the temporary-block-vent condition of the MMT-396 Infusion\n\nSet that the Kubickis allege in their complaint. 10\n\n       Notably, in the text of its 2013 letter to Medtronic, the FDA expressly\n\nadmonished Medtronic for its reporting failures. (See id. at 25–26 (asserting that\n\nMedtronic’s “Paradigm Insulin Infusion Pumps are misbranded . . . in that your firm\n\nfailed or refused to furnish material or information respecting the device that is required\n\nby or under the [MDA]” regarding incidents where users reportedly received an\n\noverdose of insulin from the pump).) 11 The FDA further faulted Medtronic for not\n\n“establish[ing] internal systems that provide for timely and effective indication,\n\ncommunication, and evaluation of events that may be subject to [medical device\n\nreporting] requirements[,]” and for not “establish[ing] internal systems that provide for\n\na standardized review process to determine when an event meets the criteria for\n\nreporting under this part.” (Id. at 26.)\n\n\n\n\n10\n   One potentially similar defect identified in the FDA warning letter is a failure to take corrective\naction regarding “overlay leaks . . . which could cause moisture ingress into the pump and pump\nfailure.” (2013 Warning Letter at 3.) However, the root cause of these leaks is identified as the\n“ultrasonic window welding process [which] causes initiation of stress-cracks, thus causing adverse\neffects to the finished device.” (Id. at 4.) And Plaintiffs do not contend that Caroline’s injury was\ncaused by any such “overlay leak.” Similarly, the 2013 Warning Letter faults Medtronic for failing to\nreview and investigate pump-related complaints properly, citing as examples a pump where “the keypad\noverlay had weak adhesive bond at locations[;]” two pumps with “loose motor support disk[s;]” and one\npump with “faulty FSR (gold).” (Id. at 7.) None of the cited examples involved the failure to\ninvestigate temporary blocked vent problems.\n11\n   The FDCA bars both the misbranding of any medical device in interstate commerce, and the\nintroduction of any misbranded device into interstate commerce. 21 U.S.C. § 331(a), (b). The statute\ndelineates a number of ways in which a medical device can be deemed misbranded, including where the\nproduct labeling is defective, see id. § 352 (b), (c), where the device was manufactured in an\nunregistered facility, see id. § 352 (o), or where a manufacturer or importer has failed to comply with\nadverse event reporting requirements, see id. § 352(t).\n\n\n                                                  18\n\fIII.    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n        A.      The Initial Pump-Related Legal Action The Plaintiffs Brought\n                Against Medtronic Alone\n\n        On September 2, 2010, the Kubickis filed a lawsuit against Medtronic on\n\nCaroline’s behalf in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. (See Brown Decl.\n\n¶ 3.) That complaint was dismissed without prejudice after the parties entered into a\n\ntolling agreement, and when the agreement expired, the Kubickis initiated the instant\n\nlawsuit by refiling their complaint against Medtronic in Superior Court. (See id.) Their\n\ninitial complaint asserted claims for negligence, strict liability, misrepresentation,\n\nfraud, breach of express and implied warranties, violation of the District of Columbia\n\nDeceptive Trade Practices Act, and failure to warn under Restatement of Torts § 388,\n\nbased on Caroline’s use of the “Medtronic MiniMed Paradigm® Insulin Pump Model\n\nMMT-522.” (See Compl., Ex. A to Notice of Removal, ECF No. 1, ¶ 4.) This initial\n\ncomplaint did not contain any specific allegations pertaining to the MMT-396 Infusion\n\nSet. (See generally id.)\n\n        Medtronic removed the complaint to federal court on May 8, 2012. (See Notice\n\nof Removal, ECF No. 1-2.) 12 Shortly after removal, Medtronic filed a motion to\n\ndismiss the Kubickis’ complaint, asserting that Plaintiffs had failed to plead their\n\nclaims sounding in fraud with particularity; that their implied warranty claims were\n\nduplicative of their strict liability claims; and that the doctrines of express and implied\n\npreemption barred all of the claims. (See Medtronic Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 4.) The\n\nCourt granted this motion in part, dismissing without prejudice the Kubickis’ fraud-\n\n\n12\n   U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly presided over this case until it was transferred to the\nundersigned in July of 2013.\n\n\n\n                                                   19\n\fbased claims, as well as their implied warranty claims. See Kubicki v. Medtronic, No.\n\n12cv0734, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1739580</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1 (D.D.C. Mar. 21, 2013). However, the Court\n\nrejected Medtronic’s contention that the remaining claims in the complaint should be\n\ndismissed on either express or implied preemption grounds. Id. at *9–11. 13\n\n        With respect to express preemption, the Court found that the Kubickis had\n\n“assert[ed] violations of the requirements set forth by the FDA as the cause of the\n\nalleged defects and ensuing violation of District of Columbia law[,]” such that the state\n\nlaw claims survived a challenge under Rule 12(b)(6). Id. at *8. However, in so\n\nholding, the Court kept the door open for Medtronic to renew its express preemption\n\nchallenge following discovery, noting that “[w]hile the Court finds Plaintiffs’ pleading\n\nsufficient to pass muster at this motion to dismiss stage, the Court does expect that as\n\nthis action proceeds, Plaintiffs will refine their claims to more specifically articulate the\n\nparallel relationship between the alleged common law duties and the federal\n\nrequirements.” Id. at *9.\n\n        As for implied preemption, the Court rejected Medtronic’s preemption argument\n\non the grounds that Plaintiffs were not seeking to assert claims based on violation of\n\nFDA regulations (which the Supreme Court has found improper), but instead were\n\npleading claims under “‘traditional state tort law.’” Id. at *11 (quoting Buckman\n\nCompany v. Plaintiffs’ Legal Committee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118406\"><a href=\"/opinion/118406/buckman-co-v-plaintiffs-legal-comm/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 352 (2001)).\n\n\n\n\n13\n   See infra Part VI.A.2 and VI.A.3 for a discussion of the doctrines of express and implied\npreemption.\n\n\n\n                                                  20\n\f        B.      Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint, Which Adds Unomedical And\n                Claims That Relate Specifically To The Infusion Set\n\n        The Kubickis filed an amended complaint on January 10, 2014. (See Am.\n\nCompl., ECF No. 51.) With leave of Court and over Medtronic’s objection (see Pls.’\n\nMot. for Leave to Amend the Compl., ECF No. 38; Medtronic Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. for\n\nLeave to Amend the Compl., ECF No. 41), the Kubickis’ amended complaint included\n\nUnomedical as a defendant, and also, for the first time in the course of the litigation,\n\nmade specific allegations regarding defects in the MMT-396 Infusion Set. (See Am.\n\nCompl. ¶ 27.) 14 Medtronic and Unomedical then filed pre-discovery dispositive\n\nmotions related to the amended complaint, which this Court denied on January 14,\n\n2015; the Court instructed the parties instead to proceed to engage in fact discovery,\n\nand it provided both defendants with the opportunity to file either an answer or an\n\nomnibus motion addressing all issues regarding the legal sufficiency of the complaint in\n\nresponse to a second amended complaint that the plaintiffs proposed to file after\n\ndiscovery. (See Order Revising Schedule for Pretrial Proceedings, ECF No. 111.)\n\n        On July 31, 2015, after the scheduled period of fact discovery ended, the\n\nKubickis filed a second amended complaint, which is the operative complaint for the\n\npurpose of the instant motions. (See 2d Am. Compl.). As noted above, this complaint\n\nasserts causes of action for negligence (Counts I–V), strict liability (Counts VI–X),\n\nbreach of express warranties (Counts XI–XV), failure to warn (Counts XVI–XX), and\n\npunitive damages (Counts XXI-XXV). (See generally id.) There are multiple counts\n\n\n\n14\n   Plaintiffs also added Flextronics International USA, Inc, as a defendant in their amended complaint,\nalleging that the company was involved in the manufacture and/or sale of the Infusion Set (see Am.\nCompl. ¶ 11), but later voluntarily dismissed the claims against Flextronics (see Stip. of Dismissal as to\nFlextronics Int’l USA, Inc., ECF No. 69).\n\n\n\n                                                   21\n\fpertaining to each theory of liability because each theory is asserted separately against\n\neach of the five entities named as defendants in the complaint (Medtronic, Inc.,\n\nMedtronic Diabetes, Medtronic MiniMed Inc., Unomedical Devices SA de CV, and\n\nUnomedical Devices A/S, respectively). (See generally id.) The claims against\n\nMedtronic pertain to both the MMT-522 Pump and the MMT-396 Infusion Set (see id.\n\nCounts I–III, VI–VIII, XI–XIII, XVI–XVIII, XXI–XXVIII, while the claims against\n\nUnomedical pertain only to the MMT-396 Infusion Set (see id. Counts IV–V, IX–X,\n\nXIV–XV, XIX–XX, XXIV–XXV).\n\n       Notably, the Kubickis’ negligence claims against Medtronic allege that\n\nMedtronic violated various duties in connection with the company’s design and\n\nmarketing of the MMT-522 Pump and MMT-396 Infusion Set, including:\n\n                 “[the D]uty to act with reasonable care in designing the\n                  MiniMed Insulin Pump and Paradigm Infusion Sets\n                  [which] parallels the federal requirements set forth in 21\n                  C.F.R. § 820.30 et seq. related to design controls[]” (id.\n                  ¶ 89);\n\n                 “[the D]uty to act with reasonable care in providing\n                  adequate instructions for use, labeling and warnings for\n                  the MiniMed Insulin Pump and Paradigm Infusion Sets\n                  [which] parallels the federal requirements set forth in 21\n                  C.F.R. § 801, et seq. and 21 U.S.C. § 352[]” (id. ¶ 90);\n\n                 “[the D]uty to act with reasonable care in documenting,\n                  logging, investigating, and reporting to the FDA and the\n                  public any complaints it received from users concerning\n                  instances of unintended overdelivery of insulin in the\n                  MiniMed Insulin Pump and Paradigm Infusion Sets\n                  [which] parallels the requirements set forth in 21 C.F.R.\n                  § 820, et seq. and 21 C.F.R. 803, et seq[]” (id. ¶ 91); and\n\n                 “[the D]uty to act with reasonable care in manufacturing\n                  the MiniMed Insulin Pump and Paradigm Infusion Sets\n\n\n\n\n                                            22\n\f                 [which] parallels the requirements set forth in 21 C.F.R.\n                 § 820, et seq” (id. ¶ 92).\n\n(See also id. at ¶¶ 95–98, 101–04.) The Kubickis assert these same alleged negligent\n\nbreaches of duty with respect to Unomedical regarding the MMT-396 Infusion Set.\n\n(See id. ¶¶ 107–10, 113–16.)\n\n       As for their strict liability claims against Medtronic, which are asserted under the\n\nRestatement of Torts § 402A, the Kubickis allege that Medtronic sold “MiniMed Insulin\n\nPumps and Paradigm Infusion Sets to Ms. Kubicki in a defective condition that was\n\nunreasonably dangerous to consumers such as Ms. Kubicki[]” due to the inadequate\n\nlabeling, inadequate instructions for priming and filling, inadequate warnings\n\nconcerning the devices’ potential to cause an unintended overdelivery of insulin,\n\nimproper design in violation of FDA design control regulations, improper manufacture\n\nin violation of FDA CGMPs, and failure to provide notice of complaints and adverse\n\nevents. (Id. ¶¶ 121, 128, 135.) The Kubickis make identical allegations against\n\nUnomedical with respect to the MMT-396 Infusion Set. (See id. ¶¶ 142–49.)\n\n       The Kubickis’ breach of warranty claims assert that Medtronic breached an\n\nexpress warranty allegedly set forth in the product packaging that the MMT-522 Pump\n\nwould be free from “defects in materials and workmanship for a period of four years\n\nfrom the date of purchase[,]” (id. ¶ 158), as well as the express guarantee that the\n\nMMT-396 Infusion Set would be free from “defects in materials and workmanship for a\n\nperiod of up to three days from the date the packaging of the individual infusion set was\n\nopened” (id. ¶ 160). Plaintiffs further allege that Medtronic had “warranted in\n\nadvertising and promotional materials” that the MMT-522 Pump and MMT-396\n\nInfusion Set were “safe for use because the company had modified the design from\n\n\n\n                                            23\n\fprevious models to move the pressure-venting component from the insulin pump to the\n\ninfusion set . . . [and] that this [design modification] would make the updated models of\n\nthe devices safer than the previous versions and other models on the market by\n\npreventing vent blockage[,]” and that Medtronic had breached this warranty. (Id. ¶ 162;\n\nsee also id. at ¶¶ 164–85.) Plaintiffs likewise assert that Unomedical breached the\n\nthree-day warranty that it offered on the MMT-396 Infusion Set, in addition to the\n\npromotional warranty that the design changes made the device safer. (See id. ¶¶ 191–\n\n93, 200–02.)\n\n       C.      Medtronic’s And Unomedical’s Motions For Summary\n               Judgment\n\n       Medtronic and Unomedical have each moved for summary judgment with respect\n\nto Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint. (See Medtronic’s MSJ; Unomedical’s MSJ.)\n\nMedtronic makes three overarching arguments, each of which would dispose of this\n\ncase in its entirety: (1) there is no evidence of causation (Medtronic’s Mem. at 21–31),\n\n(2) Plaintiffs’ claims are expressly and impliedly preempted (see id. at 31–45), and (3)\n\nthe statute of limitations bars Plaintiffs’ claims (see id. at 45–53). Medtronic further\n\nargues that Medtronic is entitled to summary judgment on the punitive damages claim\n\nbecause the record contains no evidence of intentional wrongdoing. (See id. at 58–60.)\n\nUnomedical asserts that it is entitled to summary judgment on the basis of the statute of\n\nlimitations and implied preemption (Unomedical’s Mem. at 25–26; 44–47), and it also\n\nseeks summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ punitive damages claims, arguing that its\n\nalleged misconduct is not sufficiently outrageous or egregious to state a claim for\n\npunitive damages (see id. at 49–50).\n\n\n\n\n                                            24\n\f       This Court held a hearing on these motions on November 3, 2016, during which\n\nPlaintiffs represented to the Court that they were abandoning all of the claims against\n\nUnomedical except for the failure to warn claims that are brought under both the\n\nnegligence and strict liability theories. (See Mot. Hr’g Tran. at 5:5–6:1.)\n\n\nIV.    LEGAL STANDARD FOR MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n\n       The standard that applies to motions for summary judgment brought under\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 is clear beyond cavil. A court must grant summary\n\njudgment to the movant if the moving party “shows that there is no genuine dispute as\n\nto any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 56(a). “A fact is material if it ‘might affect the outcome of the suit under the\n\ngoverning law,’ and a dispute about a material fact is genuine ‘if the evidence is such\n\nthat a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.’” Steele v.\n\nSchafer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187238\"><a href=\"/opinion/187238/steele-v-schafer/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">689</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 692 (D.C.

Civ. P. 56(e)). Although the Court must view the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inference in that party’s\n\nfavor, see, e.g., Grosdidier v.

That is, in order to advance to trial, “there must be evidence on which\n\nthe jury could reasonably find” for the non-moving party. Id.

Cir. 1987) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n\nV.     RULING ON CAUSATION\n\n       As explained, Medtronic’s summary judgment brief opens with an argument that\n\nit maintains disposes of this entire case: that the record contains insufficient evidence\n\nto support a jury finding that either the MMT-522 Pump or the MMT-396 Infusion Set\n\nactually caused Caroline’s injuries, and thus there is no genuine dispute of fact\n\nregarding the causation element, which pertains to all of Plaintiffs’ claims. (See\n\nMedtronic’s Mem. at 31–32.) 15 To be specific, Medtronic insists that the record\n\nevidence indisputably demonstrates that Caroline was not connected to her insulin pump\n\nat the time of her hypoglycemic incident, which means that the pump and infusion set\n\ncould not possibly have caused her injury. (See id. at 35.) And Medtronic offers\n\nvarious alternative causes for the precipitous drop in Caroline’s blood sugar level—\n\nsuch as “inadequate monitoring of blood sugar levels, hypoglycemia unawareness,\n\ninadequate food intake, excessive exercise, dosing error by the patient, or some\n\ncombination of these things[,]” (id.)—to bolster its causation argument, as laid out in an\n\naffidavit from Helena W. Rodbard, M.D., FACP, MACE, one of Medtronic’s retrained\n\nexpert witnesses (see Rodbard Decl.).\n\n\n15\n  As noted above, Unomedical has adopted Medtronic’s arguments regarding causation (see\nUnomedical’s Mem. at 10 n.1), and therefore the analysis in this section of the Memorandum Opinion\napplies to Unomedical’s request for summary judgment on causation grounds as well.\n\n\n\n                                                26\n\f        This Court has already found that, by offering Dr. Rodbard’s assessment of\n\npotential alternative causes for Caroline’s injuries prior to the parties’ formal entry into\n\nthe expert-discovery phase of this litigation, Medtronic has jumped the gun. (See Min.\n\nOrder of Apr. 8, 2016 (holding that “Medtronic’s submission of an expert declaration\n\n(and related argument) regarding causation is premature”).) As a result, the Court\n\npreviously granted Plaintiffs’ motion to strike the causation-hypothesis-related portions\n\nof Dr. Rodbard’s declaration, as well as the parts of Medtronic’s summary judgment\n\nbrief that rely on the stricken parts of the declaration. (See id.) Thus, today, this Court\n\nconsiders only whether Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on causation\n\ngrounds based on what the (admittedly incomplete) record that is now before this Court\n\nreveals.\n\n        As explained below, this Court finds that the record is such that a genuine\n\ndispute currently exists regarding the material question of whether Caroline was, in\n\nfact, connected to her insulin pump at the time of the hypoglycemic incident, which\n\nmeans that summary judgment is inappropriate at this time. However, the Court will\n\npermit Defendants to renew their causation arguments following the close of the\n\nforthcoming period of expert discovery. 16\n\n\n\n16\n   Thus, today’s causation ruling pertains only to what the current record demonstrates regarding the\nissue of whether Caroline was connected to the pump when the hypoglycemic incident occurred. The\nstatements that Medtronic makes to suggest that (a) Caroline did not experience a temporary blocked\nvent even if she was connected to the pump, and (b) such a blockage could not have caused her injury\nin any event (see Medtronic’s Mem. at 37–39), have not been squarely presented as a basis for the\ninstant request for summary judgment, nor could they be, given that expert discovery is still pending.\nTherefore, the instant Memorandum Opinion addresses only one aspect of Defendants’ causation-\nrelated contentions—i.e., that Caroline was not in fact connected to the insulin pump at the time of her\ninjury—and should not be construed more broadly. (See Min. Order of Apr. 8, 2016 (preserving for\ncurrent consideration only “the portions of Medtronic’s brief [relating to causation] that argue that\nthere is no evidence that Caroline Kubicki was wearing her insulin pump at the time of her underlying\ninjury”).)\n\n\n\n                                                   27\n\f       A.     The Record Evidence Thus Far Submitted Is Not Sufficient To\n              Warrant Granting Summary Judgment To Defendants On\n              Causation Grounds\n\n       As Medtronic itself acknowledges, “[b]ecause [Caroline] was alone for a\n\nsignificant portion” of the evening of September 8, 2007, “we are left with an\n\nincomplete picture of exactly what happened to [her].” (Medtronic’s Mem. at 21–22.)\n\nNevertheless, Medtronic maintains that it is entitled to summary judgment at this\n\njuncture, because, in its view, what we do know from the facts that the parties have\n\ngathered thus far indicates that Caroline was not actually using her insulin pump and\n\nthe associated infusion set at the time of her hypoglycemic event. (Id. at 35.) The\n\ncenterpiece of Medtronic’s causation claim is the deposition testimony of Caroline’s\n\nroommate (Magdelena Posthumus) that the MMT-522 Pump was “not attached to\n\n[Caroline]” when Posthumus discovered Caroline in distress on the morning of\n\nSeptember 9, 2007, but instead was laying on Caroline’s desk. (See Medtronic’s Mem.\n\nat 22 (“According to Ms. Posthumus, when she discovered Ms. Kubicki at 8:00 a.m., the\n\nMMT-522 Pump was not attached to Ms. Kubicki.” (citing Posthumus Dep. at 20:5–12,\n\n20:20–23, 67:24–68:22, 70:5–13)) (emphasis omitted); see also Medtronic’s Stmt. of\n\nFacts ¶ 29.) In addition, Medtronic points to Posthumus’s statement to the 911\n\ndispatcher, made shortly after she discovered her roommate, that Caroline, “‘ha[d]\n\nsomething that’s supposed to attach to her body but it’s not attached[,]’” and that\n\nPosthumus did not know whether Caroline “‘took it out herself[.]’” (Medtronic’s Mem.\n\nat 22 (quoting 911 Call Transcript, Ex. W to Brown Decl., ECF No. 133-5, at 221) (first\n\nalteration in original).)\n\n       Medtronic further maintains that the police officers who responded to the scene\n\nreported that Posthumus had told them that Caroline “‘carried around a device that\n\n\n                                           28\n\fperiodically dosed medication into her body’” and that “‘there was no indication that\n\nthe device was attached’” to Caroline’s body when Posthumus discovered her. (Id.\n\n(quoting Police Report, Ex. V to Brown Decl., ECF No. 133-5, at 214).) Caroline’s\n\nmedical records also appear to indicate that the responding paramedics “‘found [the]\n\ninsulin pump disconnected’” on Caroline’s desk, but that, in the paramedics’ view, it\n\nwas “‘unclear’” whether Posthumus “‘did this when [Caroline was] found\n\nunresponsive[.]’” (Id. (quoting GWU Medical Records, Ex. U to Brown Decl., ECF No.\n\n133-5, at 209) (first alteration in original).)\n\n       Plaintiffs vociferously dispute Medtronic’s contention that the pump was\n\ndetached from Caroline’s body (see Pls.’ Stmt. of Fact ¶ 1), characterizing Posthumus’s\n\ntestimony as “equivocal and unreliable” (Pls.’ Opp’n at 55), and noting that not only\n\nhad Posthumus failed to recall certain details about the insulin pump (id. at 59 (citing\n\nPosthumus Dep. at 133:3–25)), she did not even remember the fact that she had called\n\n911 on the morning in question (id. (citing Posthumus Dep. at 131:10–16)). Plaintiffs\n\nfurther argue that Posthumus had been out late with her friends on the evening of\n\nSeptember 8, 2017, “and it is unclear whether she was consuming alcohol, affecting her\n\nmemory and cognition the following morning.” (Id.) Plaintiffs also point out that\n\nPosthumus testified that Caroline was wearing pajamas and that Posthumus could not\n\nrule out the pump being underneath Caroline’s sleep clothes; that Posthumus did not\n\nnotice the location of the pump on the desk until several minutes had passed, during\n\nwhich time numerous people had entered and left the dorm room; and that she did not\n\nknow when the pump was placed on the desk. (See id. at 59–60 (citing Posthumus Dep.\n\nat 134:5–13, 160:19–21, 163:12–14).)\n\n\n\n\n                                              29\n\f      The Kubickis further maintain that, far from establishing that Caroline was not\n\nusing the pump on the night in question, Caroline’s medical records actually support the\n\ncontention that Caroline was, in fact, connected to her pump. For instance, Plaintiffs\n\nread Caroline’s hospital records to state that Caroline’s pump was covered in vomit, and\n\nthey argue that the pump “could not feasibly have been covered with pink vomit unless\n\nit was with Caroline at the time she suffered her acute hypoglycemic injury.” (Id. at 61\n\n(citing GWU Hosp. Records, ECF No. 138-4, at 4).) Plaintiffs also point to other\n\nstatements in Caroline’s medical records that suggest that it was Posthumus who\n\nremoved the pump from Caroline’s body (id. at 61 (citing GWU Hosp. Records at 4)),\n\nor that Caroline had removed the pump herself on the morning of September 9 (id. at 61\n\n(citing GWU Hops. Records at 6)). Plaintiffs also note that a resident advisor had\n\nrecalled seeing an small plastic box on Caroline’s body while Caroline was unconscious\n\nin her bed (id. at 61–62 (citing Barloon Dep. at 59, 96:18–25, 89:25–93:23, 97:8–15)),\n\nand that a paramedic has removed a “sticker” attached to Caroline’s abdomen, which\n\nthey surmise was the “the adhesive attached to her infusion set” (id. at 62 (citing\n\nHumphrey Dep. at 46:21–47:10, 59:8–15)). Additionally, when deposed, both of the\n\nKubickis testified that it simply was not Caroline’s practice to take her pump off at\n\nnight. (See id. (citing J. Kubicki Dep. at 418:2–4; K. Kubicki Dep. at 395:15–21).)\n\n      In response, Medtronic insists that the Kubickis “mischaracteriz[e]” the evidence\n\n(Reply in Support of Medtronic’s Mot. (“Medtronic’s Reply”), ECF No. 145, at 11), and\n\nit provides detailed, alternative characterizations of the deposition testimony and\n\nmedical records at issue (id. at 10–14). Moreover, Medtronic reiterates that “[t]he only\n\ntestimony concerning what Ms. Kubicki was doing on the evening in question came\n\n\n\n\n                                            30\n\ffrom Posthumus, who testified Ms. Kubicki was asleep when Posthumus left for the\n\nevening and remained in that state from the time Posthumus returned to her dorm and\n\nread a book for an hour to when she awoke and discovered Ms. Kubicki in distress the\n\nfollowing morning.” (Medtronic’s Reply at 15 (citing Medtronic Mem at 22).)\n\n       This Court has no doubt that the instant record is not sufficient to establish\n\nindisputably that Caroline was not connected to her insulin pump on the night in\n\nquestion, because there is evidence the points in both directions, and because the issue\n\nprimarily turns on Ms. Postumus’s recollection of events, as Medtronic appears to have\n\nacknowledged. It is well established that “[c]redibility determinations, the weighing of\n\nthe evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions,\n\nnot those of a judge at summary judgment.” Barnett v. PA Consulting Grp., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">715</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">354</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 358 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (citation omitted). And, indeed, this Court’s role in\n\ndeciding a motion for summary judgment is not to “determine the truth of the matter,\n\nbut instead [to] decide only whether there is a genuine issue for trial.” Id.\n\n       As this Court views the current record, there is evidence from which a reasonable\n\njury could conclude either that the insulin pump was involved in Caroline’s injury\n\nbecause it was attached to her on the night in question (see, e.g., GWU Hosp. Records\n\nat 4, 6; Barloon Dep. at 59, 96:18–25, 89:25–93:23, 97:8–15) or that the insulin pump\n\nhad nothing to do with Caroline’s injury because it was laying on her desk unused at the\n\ntime that Postumous discovered Caroline (see, e.g., Posthumus Dep. at 20:5–12, 20:20–\n\n23, 67:24–68:22, 70:5–13; 911 Call Transcript). Drilling down even farther, it appears\n\nthat, even if the jury were to conclude that the pump was on Caroline’s desk, the\n\ncausation question would not be entirely resolved, because the current record does not\n\n\n\n\n                                            31\n\fexplain when or how Caroline’s insulin pump ended up there. Based on the existing\n\nrecord evidence, then, a jury could only reasonably infer that the pump was placed on\n\nthe desk sometime between 8:30 p.m. on the evening of September 8th—when Caroline\n\ngave herself six units of insulin (see K. Kubicki Dep. at 129:20–130:8)—and the\n\nmorning of September 9th—when emergency personnel took Caroline to the hospital.\n\nWithin this key block of time is a substantial period for which no competent individual\n\ncan provide eyewitnesses testimony, because Posthumus was out with friends from\n\n10:30 p.m. the evening of September 8th until 12:30 a.m. the following morning, and\n\nwas asleep thereafter. Thus, Posthumus’s testimony does not go far enough in\n\nanswering the question of whether the pump did or did not contribute to Caroline’s\n\ninjury, even if it is deemed credible, which means that expert opinion regarding whether\n\nthe factual circumstances reflected in the record indicate that Caroline was actually\n\nusing the allegedly defective pump within the pertinent timeframe on the night of\n\nSeptember 8th and the morning of September 9th is likely to be necessary.\n\n       Consequently, the current testimony and documentary evidence are simply not\n\nsufficient to establish that there is no issue of fact for trial with respect to the material\n\nissue of whether Caroline was using her insulin pump at the time of her injury. If\n\nnothing else, it is patently obvious that the parties’ volley of competing evidentiary\n\ninterpretations and witness-credibility assessments raise more causation questions than\n\nthe record presently answers, and these lingering questions are plainly ones that a\n\njury—and not this Court—must resolve.

The Parties Will Be Permitted To Revisit The Causation\n              Question After Expert Discovery Is Completed\n\n       To be clear: this Court’s ruling on causation is a relatively narrow one, in that it\n\npertains only to the pending motions for summary judgment. (See supra n.16.) The\n\nCourt anticipates that the parties will undertake expert discovery in this matter (see\n\nOrder Revising Schedule for Pretrial Proceedings, ECF No. 11, at 1–3 (setting schedule\n\nfor fact discovery and initial motions, and providing that “[i]f any claims remain after\n\nthis Court rules on the dispositive motions, the Court will schedule an additional period\n\nof expert discovery in preparation for trial”)), and in complex medical product liability\n\ncases such as this one, expert testimony regarding causation is ordinarily indispensable\n\nunder District of Columbia law. See, e.g., Otis Elevator Co. v. Tuerr, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">616</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1254</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1260 (D.C. 1992) (noting the necessity of expert testimony “when recovery is sought\n\nfor permanent injuries or where there are complicated medical questions related to\n\ncausation of such injuries”) (citations omitted); see also Baltimore v. B.F.

Once this expert discovery period has concluded, the\n\nCourt will permit Medtronic to renew and supplement its request for summary judgment\n\non the issue of causation.\n\n\nVI.    RULING ON TIMELINESS\n\n       Turning to another major argument that Medtronic and Unomedical raise in the\n\ncontext of their motions for summary judgment—timeliness—the Court notes that the\n\nparties do not dispute that Plaintiffs’ product-liability claims for negligence, strict\n\nliability, and failure to warn are subject to the three-year statute of limitations laid out\n\nin D.C. Code § 12-301. (See Medtronic’s Mem. at 55; Unomedical’s Mem. at 25; Pls.’\n\nOpp’n at 63.) See also D.C. Code § 12-301(8) (actions “for which a limitation is not\n\notherwise specially prescribed” must be brought within three years “from the time the\n\nright to maintain the action accrues”). And the parties also appear to agree that the\n\nKubickis’ claims as they relate to the MMT-522 Pump are timely. (See Medtronic’s\n\nMem. at 55.) The statute of limitations dispute is over whether the tort claims that\n\npertain to the MMT-396 Infusion Set—which were first introduced into this litigation\n\non November 19, 2013, six years after Caroline’s injury—are time-barred. (See id. at\n\n55–62; Unomedical’s Mem. at 25–34; Pls.’ Opp’n. at 63–76; Pls.’ Mot. for Leave to\n\nFile the First Am. Compl., ECF No. 38.) For the reasons explained below, this Court\n\nfinds that the infusion set-related tort claims that the Kubickis have brought against\n\nUnomedical are not timely, because such claims could have (and should have) been\n\n\n\n                                             34\n\fdiscovered shortly after Caroline’s injury in 2007, and Unomedical had no notice of the\n\ninfusion set claims against it until the Kubickis filed an amended complaint, six years\n\nafter the injury occurred. However, the infusion set-related tort claims against\n\nMedtronic are not time-barred, because these otherwise untimely claims concerning the\n\nMMT-396 Infusion Set relate back to the timely claims that the Kubickis had filed\n\nagainst Medtronic concerning the MMT-522 Pump.\n\n       A.     The Law Pertaining To Timeliness: Statutes Of Limitations,\n              The Discovery Rule, And The Relation Back Doctrine\n\n       A statute of limitations is the legislatively prescribed time period (usually a\n\nperiod of years) within which an authorized legal claim must be filed. See Statute of\n\nLimitations, Black’s Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (defining statute of limitations);\n\nsee also Rudder v. Williams, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 52 (D.D.C. 2014) (“‘Statutes of\n\nlimitations . . . represent a pervasive legislative judgment that it is unjust to fail to put\n\nthe adversary on notice to defend within a specified period of time and that the right to\n\nbe free of stale claims in time comes to prevail over the right to prosecute them.’”\n\n(quoting United States v. Kubrick, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110159\"><a href=\"/opinion/110159/united-states-v-kubrick/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 117 (1979) (alteration in original))).\n\nClaims that are brought beyond the statutory time period are ordinarily barred.

President & Directors of Georgetown Coll., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">423</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 425 (D.C. 1986), and “the relation back doctrine” (which considers the connection\n\nbetween the old claim and the new one to determine whether the defendant knew or\n\nshould have known of the claim), see Meijer, Inc. v. Biovail Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187198\"><a href=\"/opinion/187198/meijer-inc-v-biovail-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">857</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 866\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2008). The contours of each of these doctrines is laid out below.\n\n              1.     The Discovery Rule\n\n       The discovery rule alters the typical understanding of when the statute of\n\nlimitations starts to run, (i.e., when it “accrues.”) It is well established that, “[w]here\n\nthe fact of an injury can be readily determined, a claim accrues for purposes of the\n\nstatute of limitations at the time the injury actually occurs.” Colbert v. Georgetown\n\nUniv., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">641</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 472 (D.C. 1994) (citations omitted). But, if the injury is not\n\napparent, and/or if the causal link between tortious conduct and injury is not\n\nimmediately clear, District of Columbia courts apply the “discovery rule[,]” which\n\nholds that the statute of limitations begins to run not on the date that the injury\n\nhappened, but “‘when the plaintiff has knowledge of (or by the exercise of reasonable\n\ndiligence should have knowledge of) (1) the existence of the injury, (2) its cause in fact,\n\nand (3) some evidence of wrongdoing.’” Lee v. Wolfson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2459403\"><a href=\"/opinion/2459403/lee-v-wolfson/\"><span class=\"volume\">265</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17\n\n(D.D.C. 2003) (quoting Bussineau, 518 A.2d at 425); see also Colbert, 641 A.2d at 473\n\n(holding that plaintiff’s claim for medical malpractice did not accrue until she\n\n“discovered or reasonably should have discovered all of the essential elements of her\n\npossible cause of actions”) (quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n       The District of Columbia Court of Appeals has made clear that, per the discovery\n\nrule, “the statute of limitation[s] for negligence begins to run at such time a prospective\n\n\n                                             36\n\fplaintiff gains inquiry notice that wrongdoing may be involved.” Bussineau, 518 A.2d\n\nat 427–28. This means that what a plaintiff knows, or should have known, about the\n\ndefendant’s potential fault is key. Id. Nevertheless, the statute of limitations will be\n\ndeemed to run even if the plaintiff does not fully comprehend the extent to which a\n\npotential defendant may have caused the injury. See Baker v. A.H. Robins Co., 613 F.\n\nSupp. 994, 996 (D.D.C. 1985). Furthermore, a plaintiff who has suffered an injury must\n\nact reasonably and diligently to investigate the possibility of a claim, and a litigant is\n\ndeemed to have inquiry notice of a claim that he should have discovered by exercising\n\nthis reasonable diligence. See id. at 996; see also Reeves v. Eli Lilly & Co., 368 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 11, 21 (D.D.C. 2005) (emphasizing that the reasonableness of an investigation\n\nis evaluated under an objective standard). Put another way:\n\n              In every case, the plaintiff has a duty to investigate matters\n              affecting her affairs with reasonable diligence under all of the\n              circumstances. Once the plaintiff actually knows, or with the\n              exercise of reasonable diligence would have known, of some\n              injury, its cause-in-fact, and some evidence of wrongdoing,\n              then she is bound to file her cause of action within the\n              applicable limitations period, measured from the date of her\n              acquisition of the actual or imputed knowledge.\n\nDiamond v.

Plaintiffs Could Have Discovered Their Claims Against\n             Unomedical Regarding The MMT-396 Infusion Set Near The\n             Time Of Caroline’s Injury; Therefore, The Infusion Set Claims\n             That Plaintiffs Belatedly Asserted Against Unomedical Are\n             Untimely\n\n      Plaintiffs first named Unomedical as a defendant, and made associated claims\n\narising from Unomedical’s manufacture of the MMT-396 Infusion Set, on January 10,\n\n2014—more than six years after Caroline’s hypoglycemic event. (See Am. Compl.) In\n\nresponse to the timeliness objection that both Medtronic and Unomedical raise in their\n\nsummary judgment motions, Plaintiffs insist that their newly-asserted infusion set\n\nclaims are not time-barred, because Plaintiffs “could not have conceivably connected\n\nCaroline Kubicki’s severe hypoglycemic injury” to a defect or malfunction in the\n\nMMT-396 Infusion Set prior to June 2013 Paradigm Infusion Set recall. (Pls.’ Opp’n at\n\n65; see also id. at 66 (“[T]he public was not made aware of the role of the Infusion Set\n\nin the over-delivery of insulin until June 7, 2013, when the Class I recall concerning the\n\ntemporary vent block condition was issued.” (citation omitted)).) This Court rejects the\n\nKubickis’ contention that their product-liability claims arising from the MMT-396\n\nInfusion Set accrued only as of June 2013, and that prior to that date they could not\n\npossibly have discovered that the infusion set—and its manufacturer, Unomedical—\n\nmight have been the cause of Caroline’s injuries, for the following reasons.\n\n\n\n\n                                           39\n\f              1.     Caroline’s Insulin-Delivery Device Is A Multifaceted\n                     Medical Product, And The Manufacturers Of The Various\n                     Components Are Clearly Identified\n\n       First of all, as explained in Part II.B, supra, a mechanical insulin-delivery pump\n\nis a complex medical device that has many intricate parts, even to the lay observer. In\n\nthe wake of Caroline’s injury, basic due diligence in evaluating the suspected source of\n\nthe alleged insulin overdose would have led a reasonable plaintiff to discover relatively\n\nquickly that Caroline’s insulin-delivery device has various components; moreover, a\n\nreasonable plaintiff certainly would have surmised that any one of the device’s various\n\ncomponents could have been responsible for Caroline’s injury. Indeed, the record\n\nestablishes that the Kubickis understood at the time of Caroline’s injury that the MMT-\n\n522 Pump and the MMT-396 Infusion Set worked together to provide insulin to\n\nCaroline (see J. Kubicki Dep. at 85:3-9; K. Kubicki Dep. at 324:3-16), which makes it\n\nall the more unreasonable for Plaintiffs to have filed an initial complaint that only\n\ncontained claims related to an alleged defect in one component of Caroline’s insulin-\n\ndelivery device (the MMT-522 Pump).\n\n       The fact that Karen Kubicki may have subjectively believed that the potentially\n\ndefective insulin-delivery product was a unitary object (see K. Kubicki Dep. at 324:3–\n\n16 (asserting that she considered the pump and infusion set as “one [and] the same”)) is\n\nof no moment. As explained, the applicable standard of knowledge for the purposes of\n\nthe discovery rule is an objective one, see Baker, 613 F. Supp. at 996, and given the\n\ntotality of the facts and circumstances here, (including those that would have been\n\nuncovered by a diligent investigation), it is clear to this Court that an objectively\n\nreasonable plaintiff would have readily discovered that the pump and the infusion set\n\nwere distinct components of the Caroline’s insulin-delivery device, especially after one\n\n\n                                             40\n\fof Caroline’s physicians specifically expressed to the Kubickis a concern about the fact\n\nthat Caroline’s MMT-396 Infusion Set had been discarded after the injury. (See K.\n\nKubicki Dep. at 322:6-7 (acknowledging that the doctor had told them “you would want\n\neverything that [Caroline] was using” in trying to figure out what happened); see also\n\nid. at 322:14–23, 324:3–16.) And even without such pointed statements from persons\n\nwith knowledge of the device in question, a reasonable plaintiff would have at least\n\nconsulted the packaging materials that accompanied the seemingly defective medical\n\ndevice, and thereby would have discovered that the infusion set tubing that delivers\n\ninsulin to the body was packaged separately from the potentially defective mechanical\n\npump—another indisputable marker of a separate piece of medical equipment.\n\n       Plaintiffs’ contention that, as laypeople, they could not possibly have known that\n\na defect in the p-cap valve of the MMT-396 Infusion Set caused Caroline’s injury\n\nbefore the recall in June of 2013 (see Pls.’ Opp’n at 66) misses the mark entirely,\n\ninsofar as it suggests that the statute of limitations does not accrue on a products-\n\nliability claim until the plaintiff has sufficient information to make specific allegations\n\nwith respect to causation. Quite to the contrary, it is well established that, while a\n\nplaintiff must have “knowledge of wrongdoing to commence the statute of\n\nlimitation[s,]” Bussineau, 518 A.2d at 432 n.11, he need not “have certain knowledge of\n\ncausation[,]” Dawson, 543 F. Supp. at 1334. Thus, it was sufficient that the Kubickis\n\nsuspected wrongdoing related to the mechanism by which insulin went from the MMT-\n\n522 Pump’s reservoir, through the infusion set, and into Caroline’s body—even if they\n\ndid not understand the precise failure mode—and they had developed this suspicion by\n\nat least the year 2010. This Court has no doubt that, under such circumstances, a\n\n\n\n\n                                             41\n\freasonable plaintiff would have discovered, and presumably raised, tort claims that\n\npertain to all of the components of that allegedly faulty insulin-delivery system.\n\n        In this case, there is an additional wrinkle: the Kubickis’ unreasonable failure to\n\nassert timely product-liability tort claims relating to a key component of Caroline’s\n\ninsulin-delivery device also means they failed to identify Unomedical, and to include\n\nthat company as a defendant in this action in a timely fashion. Again, while Karen\n\nKubicki may not have actually known that there was another company involved in the\n\nmanufacture of the medical device that she suspected caused Caroline’s injury (see Pls.’\n\nOpp’n at 68 (referencing Karen Kubicki’s statement that she “did not know who made\n\nthe Infusion Set and only thought that Medtronic was involved”)), and in this Court’s\n\nview, an objectively reasonable plaintiff would easily have discovered at the time of\n\nCaroline’s injury that a potential tort claim arising from the MMT-396 Infusion Set\n\nexisted and was assertable against that product’s manufacturer. What is more, the\n\nproduct packaging and instructions related to the MMT-396 Infusion Set clearly state\n\nthat the MMT-396 Infusion Set was “Assembled in Mexico for Unomedical A/S”\n\n(Packaging Photos; Infusion Set Instructions), and Unomedical’s name also appears on\n\nthe MMT-396 Infusion Set itself (Mot. Hr’g Tr. 73:19–74:6.), which makes the\n\nKubickis’ failure to conduct even the most minimal investigation all the more obvious\n\nhere.\n\n        In any event, there is no question that the Kubickis had an obligation to conduct\n\nan investigation into all of the potential sources of the product that they suspected was\n\nthe cause of Caroline’s injury. They were certainly aware that someone had\n\nmanufactured all of the components of the device in question; thus, they were on\n\n\n\n\n                                             42\n\f“inquiry” notice that medical-device manufacturers had a role in making Caroline’s\n\ninfusion set, and should have looked into whether any companies other than Medtronic\n\nwere involved.

It is undisputed that the\n\nMMT-396 Infusion Set works together with the MMT-522 Pump, and even setting aside\n\nthe obvious indications on the packaging materials and the device itself that a company\n\nother than Medtronic was involved with the manufacture of that component, a\n\nreasonable plaintiff would have investigated the origins of the device in question, and\n\nsuch investigation would have revealed that Unomedical had a sufficient connection to\n\nthe manufacturing of the MMT-396 Infusion Set to warrant naming Unomedical as a co-\n\ndefendant in the 2010 complaint. See also 21 C.F.R. § 803.3(1) (FDA regulations\n\ndefining manufacturer as “any person who manufactures, prepares, propagates,\n\n\n\n\n                                            43\n\fcompounds, assembles, or processes a [medical] device”). In other words, although the\n\nKubickis were intent upon suing Medtronic based on their concerns about the operation\n\nof the insulin pump, the company that the manufactured the infusion set—a component\n\nof Medtronic’s insulin-delivery device—was readily ascertainable by the public at the\n\ntime of Caroline’s injury, and should have been known to Plaintiffs as well, long before\n\nto the 2013 Recall.\n\n              2.      Plaintiffs Rely On Dissimilar Cases To Support Their\n                      Contention That Their Infusion Set Claims Accrued In 2013\n\n       The functional connection between the MMT-522 Pump and the MMT-396\n\nInfusion Set, and the fact that the Kubickis suspected a defect in Caroline’s insulin-\n\ndelivery system immediately but chose to file a timely action against only one of the\n\ncompanies involved in the manufacture of the components of that system, differentiates\n\nthis case from Lee v. Wolfson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2459403\"><a href=\"/opinion/2459403/lee-v-wolfson/\"><span class=\"volume\">265</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.D.C. 2003), on which Plaintiffs\n\nrely. The plaintiff in Lee sued for damages as a result of injuries that she suffered when\n\nan unattended vehicle in a parking garage struck her. Notably, after testing showed no\n\nissues with the parking break mechanism, Lee’s complaint alleged that the cause of her\n\ninjury was human error in either failing to set the parking brake or inadvertently\n\nreleasing it, id. at 16, and consistent with this theory, Lee initially named the owner of\n\nthe rolling car and the parking garage as defendants, id. The National Highway Traffic\n\nSafety Administration subsequently issued a recall to correct a defect in the parking\n\nbrake design, which prompted Lee to seek to amend her complaint to add the car’s\n\nmanufacturer, id. at 16–17, and the Court authorized the amendment as timely. In\n\nfinding that Lee’s claims against the manufacturer did not accrue until the recall notice\n\nissued, the Lee court held that “plaintiff here cannot automatically be expected to know\n\n\n\n                                            44\n\fthat wrongful conduct on the part of [the manufacturer] might have caused the release\n\nof the [rolling car’s] parking brake at the time of her injury, particularly when no defect\n\nin the parking brake was revealed during the investigation of the accident by the police\n\nor plaintiff’s expert.” Id. at 18.\n\n       Here, by contrast, the Kubickis’ initial claim of wrongdoing concerned an\n\nalleged product-related defect pertaining to the insulin-infusion system that Caroline\n\nused (otherwise they could not have in good faith sued Medtronic). And having\n\nsuspected a problem with that system, it was incumbent upon the Kubickis to conduct a\n\nreasonable inquiry into all of the possible components of that system in a timely\n\nfashion. See Diamond, 680 A.2d at 381; see also Colbert, 641 A.2d at 472–73 (holding\n\nthat “[w]here the fact of an injury can be readily determined, a claim accrues for\n\npurposes of the statute of limitations at the time the injury actually occurs[,]” but\n\n“[w]here the relationship between the fact of injury and the alleged tortious conduct\n\nmay be obscure,” the claim accrues when the plaintiff “knew or should have known that\n\nshe had suffered injury as a result of the defendants’ negligence”). In other words, the\n\ninstant case is substantially different from Lee, because while the plaintiff in Lee lacked\n\nfair notice of any wrongdoing with respect to the parking brake system of the car that\n\nhad injured her and was instead proceeding on a human-error tort theory, the Kubickis\n\nsuspected a product defect from the outset, and therefore, had the obligation to examine\n\ntimely all of the aspects of the allegedly defective product for statute of limitations\n\npurposes.\n\n       A more analogous case is Colarossi v. Schmid Laboratories, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">830</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">230</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.N.J. 1993), in which the court found that a claim against a manufacturer of\n\n\n\n\n                                             45\n\fintrauterine devices (“IUDs”) was untimely under District of Columbia law. The\n\nplaintiff in Colarossi learned from her doctor in 1978 that her IUD might have caused\n\nan infection that led to permanent injuries. Id. at 237. The court found that her claim\n\naccrued at that point in time, noting that “[f]aced with permanent injury and [a]\n\nstatement by her doctor that her IUD may have been the cause, wrongdoing by someone\n\nwas more than a hypothetical possibility and the wrongdoing element was met.” Id.\n\n(alterations, internal quotation marks, and citation omitted); see also id. at 236 (“The\n\nwrongdoing element does not, however, require that the plaintiff know the identity of\n\nthe party responsible for the injury.”). In the alternative, the court found that the claim\n\naccrued no later than 1986, which was when the plaintiff learned of, and participated in,\n\nlitigation related to Dalkon Shield IUDs. Id. at 237. Notably, the Colarossi plaintiff\n\nmade a critical mistake in connection with that litigation: she failed to review her own\n\nmedical records to determine the specific manufacturer of the IUD that she had used,\n\nand as a result, she only sued the manufacturer of Dalkon Shield IUDs, not the\n\nmanufacturer of the brand of IUD that was identified in her medical records. Id. When\n\nthe plaintiff later learned of her error and tried to sue the correct manufacturer, the\n\ncourt pegged 1986 as the latest possible accrual date because, at that point, “not only\n\nwas [the plaintiff] aware of the possibility of wrongdoing, she took affirmative action to\n\nobtain legal redress.” Id.; see also id. (faulting plaintiff for failing to exercise due\n\ndiligence because she failed to examine her medical records before initiating suit).\n\n       So it is here. The Kubickis knew of potential wrongdoing on the part of the\n\nmanufacturers of Caroline’s insulin-deilvery system in 2007, when Caroline suffered\n\nher injury and when her treating physician advised them that Caroline’s insulin-delivery\n\n\n\n\n                                             46\n\fsystem (consisting of the MMT-522 pump and MMT-396 Infusion Set) could be the\n\ncause. (See J. Kubicki Dep. at 23:25–25:13.) And even if it was reasonable for the\n\nKubickis to fail to make a connection between the insulin-deilvery system and potential\n\nwrongdoing in 2007, they undeniably had made that connection by the time they filed a\n\nlawsuit against Medtronic in 2010, which means that, at the very latest, their product-\n\nliability claims accrued in 2010 (see Brown Decl. ¶ 3), four years before they undertook\n\nto litigate tort claims specifically pertaining to the MMT-396 Infusion Set.\n\n       The 2009 Lot 8 recall—through which Medtronic recalled certain MMT-396\n\nInfusion Sets from a particular manufacturing lot but provided public assurances that all\n\nother lots were safe and effective (see 2009 Recall Notice, Ex. 18 to Pls.’ Opp’n, ECF\n\nNo. 138-28, at 1)—has no bearing on the aforementioned analysis of the accrual of the\n\nKubickis’ claims. Plaintiffs assert that Medtronic’s safety assurances with respect to\n\nnon-Lot 8 infusion sets “led Plaintiffs to not consider the MMT-396 Infusion Set as a\n\npotential cause in fact.” (Pls.’ Opp’n at 70.) But, if anything, the 2009 recall notice\n\nwould have spurred a reasonable plaintiff to inquire further regarding this component of\n\nthe Caroline’s insulin-deilvery system, because in the context of the Lot 8 recall,\n\nMedtronic expressly identified a particular fault mechanism in the MMT-396 Infusion\n\nSet that could result in the over-delivery of insulin, i.e., the blocking of air vents in the\n\ntubing connector. (See Questions & Answers Regarding the “Lot 8” Quick-set Infusion\n\nSet Recall, Ex. 27 to Pls.’ Opp’n, ECF No. 138-29, at 3; see also 2009 Recall Notice at\n\n1 (explaining, specifically, that Lot 8 MMT-396 Infusion Sets potentially had a\n\nmanufacturing defect that “may not allow the insulin pump to vent air pressure properly\n\n\n\n\n                                             47\n\f[which] could potentially result in the device delivering too much or too little insulin\n\nand may cause serious injury or death.”)\n\n        Thus, armed with the general knowledge that blockage of the infusion set air\n\nvents could lead to an over-delivery of insulin, and believing that Caroline was injured\n\nas the result of an over-delivery of insulin, an objectively reasonable plaintiff would by\n\nno means have felt “reassured” by Medtronic’s assertions; instead, she would have even\n\nmore vigorously investigated, and pursued, tort claims against any entity that had\n\nplayed a role in the manufacture of Caroline’s MMT-396 Infusion Set, including\n\nUnomedical. 17\n\n                3.       The Relation Back Doctrine Does Not Save The Infusion\n                         Set-Related Claims Against Unomedical\n\n        Plaintiffs have invoked the “relation back” doctrine to maintain that, even if this\n\nCourt concludes that the amended complaint’s claims related to the MMT-396 Infusion\n\nSet are untimely because those claims could have been discovered long before Plaintiffs\n\nfiled the amended complaint, the infusion set claims should nevertheless be deemed\n\ntimely. (See Pls.’ Opp’n at 74.) To support this argument, Plaintiffs cite to Federal\n\nRule of Civil Procedure 15(c)(1)(B), which provides that an amended pleading relates\n\nback to the date of the original pleading when “the amendment asserts a claim or\n\ndefense that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out—or attempted\n\n\n17\n   The holdings of the cases that Plaintiffs cite to support their contention that they “justifiably relied\non Defendants to provide information about the safety risks of their products[,]” (Pls.’ Opp’n at 70),\nare inapposite. The court in Diamond, for example, noted that it could take into account the existence\nof a “confidential or fiducial relationship between the plaintiff and defendant” in determining whether\nthe plaintiff rightfully relied on representations the defendant made. 680 A.2d at 381. No such\nfiduciary or confidential relationship exists in this case. Nor is this a circumstance where there is a\nlatent product defect that only becomes evident after the limitations period had run. See, e.g.,\nEhrenhaft v. Malcolm Price, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1192</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1202 (D.C. 1984). Here, the injury itself was\nimmediately evident, and Plaintiffs unquestionably had knowledge of the insulin-deilvery system’s\npotential role in Caroline’s injury by at least 2010.\n\n\n\n                                                     48\n\fto be set out—in the original pleading[.]” Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(B). In this regard,\n\nPlaintiffs argue that “the Second Amended Complaint does not introduce any new legal\n\ntheories into this litigation, but instead only amplifies the original factual allegations to\n\ninclude the Infusion Set” (Pls.’ Opp’n at 75 (emphasis added) (internal citations and\n\nquotation marks omitted)). Be that as it may, this Court concludes that the infusion set-\n\nrelated claims against Unomedical cannot be considered to relate back to the original\n\ncomplaint for statute of limitations purposes, for the following reasons.\n\n       It is clear beyond cavil that relation back under Rule 15(c)(1)(B) is permissible\n\nonly if the defendant had “sufficient notice of the facts and claims giving rise to the\n\nproposed amendment” prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations.

Indeed, the Kubickis did not make any\n\nspecific product-defect allegations regarding the MMT-396 Infusion Set—the only\n\nportion of the insulin-delivery system to which Unomedical had any connection—until\n\n2014, and Unomedical therefore would have no reason to suspect before that time that it\n\ncould be subject to liability for Caroline’s injuries. This lack of notice undoubtedly\n\nforecloses the Kubicki’s reliance on the relation back doctrine to render timely their tort\n\nclaims against Unomedical. See, e.g., Meijer, Inc., 533 F.3d at 866.\n\n       C.     Plaintiffs’ Infusion Set Claims Against Medtronic Relate Back\n              To Their Preexisting MMT-522 Pump Claims Against That\n              Defendant, And Thus Are Deemed Timely\n\n       As a party to the original action, Medtronic stands in markedly different shoes\n\nthan Unomedical does, as far as the Kubicki’s infusion set claims are concerned. As\n\nexplained above, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c)(1)(B) specifically contemplates\n\nthe circumstances under which an amendment to a pleading “relates back to the date of\n\nthe original pleading” for the purpose of the statute of limitations, and unlike the\n\n\n                                            51\n\finfusion set claims against Unomedical (which had nothing to relate back to because\n\nUnomedical was not named in the original complaint), the relation-back question with\n\nrespect to the MMT-396 Infusion Set claims that Plaintiffs have belatedly brought\n\nagainst Medtronic is whether these claims “arose out of the conduct, transaction, or\n\noccurrence” laid out in Plaintiffs’ initial pleading, Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(B), such that\n\nMedtronic had “been put on notice regarding the claim . . . raised by the amended\n\npleading[,]” 6A Charles A. Wright, et al., Federal Practice & Procedure § 1497 (3d ed.\n\n2017).\n\n         Not surprisingly, Medtronic says ‘no’: it argues that the initial complaint\n\nprovided no notice of the potential infusion set claims, and that “[t]he addition of an\n\nentirely new device as a potential cause of Ms. Kubicki’s injuries is a ‘substantial’\n\nalteration to this case and provides Plaintiffs with an entirely new legal theory for why\n\nMs. Kubicki was injured.” (Medtronic’s Mem. at 62.) Elsewhere in its brief, however,\n\nMedtronic acknowledges that “the MMT-522-Pump and MMT-396 Infusion Set worked\n\ntogether to deliver insulin[,]” such that one component of the system would be useless\n\nfor insulin-delivery without the other. (Id. at 61.) In addition, Medtronic does not\n\ndispute the fact that both medical devices are sold under Medtronic’s name, and are\n\ncomponents of the same system that Medtronic markets for use to deliver insulin to\n\nconsumers. (See Product Photos, Ex. 61 to Pls.’ Opp’n, ECF 138-63, at 2; Infusion Set\n\nUser Guide, Ex F. to Decl. of Michael Wallace, ECF No. 133-4, at 12 (“The Quick-set\n\nis indicated for the subcutaneous infusion of medicine, including insulin, from a\n\nParadigm infusion pump and reservoir.”); Pump User Guide, Ex. 24 to Pl.’s Opp’n, ECF\n\n\n\n\n                                             52\n\fNo. 138-26, at 4 (instructing user to “insert the infusion set into your body as described\n\nin the next section.”).)\n\n       Thus, Medtronic’s insistence that it had no notice of any potential claims arising\n\nfrom the design or operation of Caroline’s infusion set is unpersuasive. The initial\n\ncomplaint clearly alleges that Caroline was injured when she received an overdose of\n\ninsulin as a result of being connected to the MMT-522 Pump. (See Compl. ¶¶ 14 (“A\n\nnumber of technical problems have been reported with the use of insulin pumps\n\nincluding, but not limited to, the pumps’ delivery of too much insulin resulting in\n\nhypoglycemia.”); 16 (“On or about September 9, 2007, Caroline Kubicki. . . was found\n\nto be unresponsive and unarousable by her roommate as a result of her malfunctioning\n\nMiniMed Insulin Pump.”); 72 (“If Caroline had known the true facts concerning the\n\nrisks of the use of the MiniMed Insulin Pump, in particular, the risk of significant\n\nhypoglycemic event with anoxic brain injury, she would not have used the product.”).)\n\nConsequently, Medtronic knew from the outset that the company was facing timely\n\nallegations of product-related deficiencies that had allegedly caused a serious injury,\n\nand the subsequent addition of even more specific allegations regarding another\n\ncomponent of the insulin-delivery device in question—the MMT-396 Infusion Set—\n\ndoes not give rise to “an entirely new legal theory[,]” as Medtronic argues.\n\n(Medtronic’s Mem. at 62.) Instead, it is reasonably clear that Plaintiffs’ amendment\n\nmerely refines the theory of liability that Plaintiffs had already pled in their timely\n\ncomplaint. See Hicks, 283 F.3d at 388 (concluding that, where an amended complaint\n\n“amplif[ies] the facts already alleged,” the amended complaint relates back to the initial\n\ncomplaint); Jones v. Ottenberg’s Bakers, Inc., No. 13-814, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">6119322</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *3\n\n\n\n\n                                             53\n\f(D.D.C. Nov. 21, 2013) (holding that an amended complaint relates back to the original\n\ncomplaint if the “amended complaint is logically related to, and seeks recovery for, the\n\nsame acts alleged in the initial complaint”).\n\n       In short, as explained above, the relation back doctrine deems timely an\n\notherwise untimely amendment to a complaint when the defendant had adequate notice\n\nof the claims that are subsequently added, and this Court is confident that such is the\n\ncase with respect to the Kubicki’s infusion set claims against Medtronic. Given the\n\nallegations of the original complaint and the interrelation between the pump and the\n\ninfusion set in delivering insulin to users, Medtronic knew or should have known from\n\nPlaintiffs’ initial allegations that infusion set claims existed and may yet be asserted,\n\nand Medtronic can hardly be heard to complain that it was not sufficiently alerted to a\n\npotential problem with MMT-396 Infusion Set and the p-cap valve in particular, when\n\nthese components play a crucial role in ensuring that the pump delivers insulin at the\n\ncorrect rate and when the Kubickis’ core allegation was over-delivery of insulin to a\n\npump-user. Therefore, although the claims in Plaintiffs’ complaint concerning the\n\nMMT-396 Infusion Set were not asserted timely in the first instance, this Court\n\nconcludes that these otherwise time-barred claims relate back to the timely claims\n\nregarding the MMT-522 Pump that Plaintiffs brought against Medtronic in the initial\n\ncomplaint, and as a result, these claims against Medtronic are deemed timely for statute\n\nof limitations purposes.\n\n\nVII.   RULING ON PREEMPTION\n\n       The thorniest legal issue that Medtronic raises as grounds for dismissal of the\n\nKubickis’ claims is preemption—a doctrine that has its roots in the Supremacy Clause\n\n\n\n                                             54\n\fof the U.S. Constitution.

As relevant here, Congress has vested the Food and Drug\n\nAdministration (“FDA”) with the authority to regulate medical devices; consequently,\n\nstate law legal claims that pertain to such devices implicate questions of both express\n\npreemption and implied preemption. As a general matter, express preemption occurs\n\nwhen a federal statute explicitly sets forth the particular circumstances in which state\n\nlaw claims cannot be maintained. See Waterview Mgmt.

Cir. 1999) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), which\n\nrenders state law claims that seek merely to enforce federal duties effectively barred.\n\nSee Buckman, 531 U.S. at 352.\n\n       Medtronic argues that Section 360k(a) of the Medical Device Amendments to the\n\nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) expressly preempts the Kubickis’ MMT-522\n\nPump claims, and furthermore, that the claims in the Kubickis’ complaint pertaining to\n\nboth components of Medtronic’s insulin-deilvery system (the pump and the MMT-396\n\nInfusion Set) are impliedly preempted because the Kubickis are seeking to enforce FDA\n\nregulations rather than attempting to vindicate independent state law duties. (See\n\n\n\n\n                                            55\n\fMedtronic’s Mem. at 44–55.) The Kubickis have myriad responses to Medtronic’s\n\npreemption contentions (see Pls.’ Opp’n at 36–53), including the argument that there is\n\nno express preemption of their MMT-522 Pump claims because the state laws on which\n\nthe claims are based track the federal requirements (see id. at 38–40), and the implied\n\npreemption doctrine is inapplicable because the complaint asserts stand-alone state law\n\nclaims that do not usurp the FDA’s enforcement authority (see id. at 51–53).\n\n       The parties’ arguments are largely based on established law concerning the\n\nexpress and implied preemption of state law claims involving medical devices—law\n\nthat is “charitably speaking, utterly conflicted[,]” In re Medtronic, Inc.

In sum, this\n\nCourt concludes that all of the claims pertaining to the MMT-522 Pump are expressly\n\npreempted, with the exception of one narrow aspect of the claim alleging a pump-\n\nrelated manufacturing defect, and that none of the claims pertaining to the MMT-396\n\nInfusion Set are impliedly preempted, except for one claim that pertains to Medtronic’s\n\nallegedly tortious failure to report adverse events to the FDA. What remains, then, is a\n\nsingle manufacturing defect claim concerning the MMT-522 Pump, as well as almost all\n\nof the claims against Medtronic that pertain to the MMT-396 Infusion Set; these will be\n\nthe claims at issue during the forthcoming period of expert discovery.\n\n\n\n\n                                            56\n\f       A.

Id. (quoting 21 U.S.C. § 360c(a)(1)(B)). Class III devices are those that either “presen[t] a\npotential unreasonable risk of illness or injury,” or are “purported or represented to be for a use in\nsupporting or sustaining human life or for a use which is of substantial importance in preventing\nimpairment of human health[.]” Id. at 477 (quoting 21 U.S.C. § 360c(a)(1)(C)) (quotation marks\nomitted).\n\n\n                                                  57\n\ftypically requires a manufacturer to submit a multi-volume application). When it\n\nanalyzes the device-related application that manufacturers submit, “the FDA must\n\nweigh the ‘probable benefit to health from the use of the device against any probable\n\nrisk of injury or illness from such use.’” In re Medtronic, 592 F. Supp. 2d at 1150\n\n(quoting 21 U.S.C. § 360c(a)(2)(C)). And pursuant to this calculus, the FDA “may thus\n\napprove devices that present great risks if they nonetheless offer great benefits in light\n\nof available alternatives.” Riegel, 552 U.S. at 318.\n\n       Notably, once the FDA has granted premarket approval to a device, the\n\nmanufacturer generally may not make changes to the design, labeling, manufacturing\n\nprocess, or any other aspect of the device without further FDA approval. See id. at 319;\n\nsee also id. at 323 (“[T]he FDA requires a device that has received premarket approval\n\nto be made with almost no deviations from the specifications in its approval application,\n\nfor the reason that the FDA has determined that the approved form provides a\n\nreasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.”). “If the applicant wishes to make\n\nsuch a change, it must submit, and the FDA must approve, an application for\n\nsupplemental premarket approval, to be evaluated under largely the same criteria as an\n\ninitial application.” Id. (citing § 360e(d)(6), 21 C.F.R. § 814.39(c)). Furthermore, a\n\nPMA device manufacturer also has certain post-approval reporting duties, including the\n\nobligation to report to the FDA all known incidents in which the device “(1) [m]ay have\n\ncaused or contributed to death or serious injury, or (2) [may have] malfunctioned and\n\n. . . would be likely to cause or contribute to death or serious injury, if the malfunction\n\nwere to recur[.]” 21 CFR § 803.50(a). Such reporting must take place within 30 days of\n\n\n\n\n                                             58\n\fwhen the manufacturer “receive[s] or otherwise become[s] aware of [the] information.”\n\nId.\n\n       In recognition of the fact that the lengthy PMA process can substantially delay\n\nthe introduction of improvements to existing medical devices, “the [MDA] . . . permits\n\ndevices that are ‘substantially equivalent’ to pre-existing devices to avoid the PMA\n\nprocess.” Lohr, 518 U.S. at 478 (quoting 21 U.S.C. § 360e(b)(1)(B)). To be\n\nsubstantially equivalent to a pre-existing Class I, II, or III medical device, “the new\n\ndevice must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either (i) have the\n\nsame technological characteristics as the predicate device or (ii) be shown to be as safe\n\nand effective as the predicate devices.” Ivy Sports, 767 F.3d at 83 (quoting 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 360c(i)(1)(A) (internal quotation marks omitted). The FDA has a process for\n\nconducting a substantial equivalence review—known as the “§ 510(k) process”—which\n\nis triggered when a manufacturer who intends to introduce a new medical device into\n\nthe market submits to the FDA a “premarket notification” that “states the new device’s\n\nintended use, identifies the predicate devices to which the new device is substantially\n\nequivalent, and offers a proposed classification.” Id. at 83 (citing 21 C.F.R. § 807.87).\n\n       It is important to recognize that “[t]he § 510(k) notification process is by no\n\nmeans comparable to the PMA process; in contrast to the 1,200 hours necessary to\n\ncomplete a PMA review, the § 510(k) review is completed in an average of only 20\n\nhours.” Lohr, 518 U.S. at 478–79 (citation omitted). This is in large part because,\n\nwhile the PMA process focuses on the safety and efficacy of a device, the § 510(k)\n\nprocess focuses only on whether the new device is equivalent to an existing device. Id.\n\nat 493. Thus, “‘[t]he attraction of substantial equivalence to manufacturers is clear.\n\n\n\n\n                                            59\n\f[Section] 510(k) notification requires little information, rarely elicits a negative\n\nresponse from the FDA, and gets processed very quickly.’” Id. at 479 (quoting Robert\n\nAdler, The 1976 Medical Device Amendments: A Step in the Right Direction Needs\n\nAnother Step in the Right Direction, 43 Food Drug Cosm. L.J. 511, 516 (1988)) (second\n\nalteration in original). Consequently, the abbreviated § 510(k) process has become the\n\nroute by which the vast majority of new medical devices—including Class III devices,\n\nwhich by definition pose the highest level of risk to the patient—enter the marketplace.\n\nSee id.; see also Riegel, 552 U.S. at 1004 (“In 2005, for example, the FDA authorized\n\nthe marketing of 3,148 devices under § 510(k) and granted premarket approval to just\n\n32 devices.”).\n\n              2.

In this regard, section 360k(a) of Title 21 of the U.S. Code\n\nstates (in relevant part) that\n\n              [N]o State or political subdivision of a State may establish or\n              continue in effect with respect to a device intended for human use any\n              requirement—\n\n                   (1) which is different from, or in addition to, any\n                   requirement applicable under this chapter to the device,\n                   and\n                   (2) which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the\n                   device or to any other matter included in a requirement\n                   applicable to the device under this chapter.\n\n21 U.S.C. § 360k(a). The reach of this express exemption clause has been extensively\n\nlitigated over the past three decades, and as a result, the Supreme Court has established\n\n\n\n                                             60\n\fa two-part test that courts must use when evaluating whether state law claims fall within\n\nthe scope of 21 U.S.C. § 360k(a). See Riegel, 552 U.S. at 321–22. Pursuant to the\n\nprescribed analysis, courts must consider, first, “whether the Federal Government has\n\nestablished requirements applicable to” the device, and second, “whether the\n\n[plaintiff’s] common-law claims are based upon [state] requirements with respect to the\n\ndevice that are ‘different from, or in addition to,’ the federal ones, and that relate to\n\nsafety and effectiveness.” Id. (quoting 21 U.S.C. § 360k(a)).\n\n        It is by now well established that the FDA’s affirmative grant of premarket\n\napproval to a medical device through the PMA review process satisfies the first prong\n\nof this two-part inquiry. Id. at 322–23 (noting that premarket approval “imposes\n\nrequirements under the MDA” because “the FDA requires a device that has received\n\npremarket approval to be made with almost no deviations from the specifications in its\n\napproval application” (internal quotation marks omitted)). By contrast, if a device has\n\nbeen approved through the less-arduous Section 510(k) substantial equivalence process,\n\nthe first part of the Supreme Court’s express preemption test does not apply. See Lohr,\n\n518 U.S. at 493–94; see also Duggan v. Medtronic, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">840</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The Lohr Court further concluded that permitting state law claims to\nproceed with respect to devices that have only undergone substantial equivalence review as opposed to\nPMA review is consistent with congressional intent. See id. at 494 (explaining that “[t]here is no\n\n\n\n                                                  61\n\f        With respect to the second prong of the express preemption inquiry, the Supreme\n\nCourt has held that state common law claims for negligence, strict liability, and breach\n\nof warranty, among other things, qualify as “requirements. . . with respect to devices”\n\nfor the purpose of the MDA’s express preemption clause. Riegel, 552 U.S. at 324, 327.\n\nThus, current express preemption disputes in the medical-device context often involve\n\nthe issue of whether the asserted state common law claims effectively impose\n\nobligations on manufacturers that are “different from, or in addition to” the federal\n\nrequirements.

Implied Preemption Of State Law Claims Under the MDA\n\n       Unlike express preemption, the doctrine of implied preemption does not rest on\n\nthe provisions of a statute; instead, it necessarily follows from the legislature’s intent to\n\nconfer all regulatory authority to a federal body. For example, the FDCA vests the\n\nFDA with exclusive authority to investigate potential violations of medical device\n\nrequirements, regardless of whether the FDA has approved the device through the\n\nrigorous PMA process or the less onerous § 510(k) substantial equivalence process.\n\nSee, e.g., Martin v. Medtronic, Inc., No. 15-cv-0994, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2017</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">825410</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *9 (E.D.

Supp. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1035</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1046\n\n(D. Ariz. 2015) (noting that implied preemption is available where device is approved\n\nthrough the 510(k) process)). Thus, a plaintiff’s attempt to enforce federal requirements\n\nin the context of private litigation (even a suit that ostensibly involves only state law\n\nclaims) may run afoul of this delegation.\n\n       In Buckman Company v. Plaintiffs’ Legal Committee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118406\"><a href=\"/opinion/118406/buckman-co-v-plaintiffs-legal-comm/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2001), the\n\nSupreme Court held that if establishing the defendant’s liability for the plaintiff’s state\n\n\n                                             64\n\flaw claim requires demonstrating that the FDCA has been violated, then prosecution of\n\nthe state law action intrudes upon the FDA’s exclusive province to enforce the FDCA,\n\nrendering the suit impliedly preempted. Id. at 349–53. The Supreme Court was also\n\nclear in Buckman that implied preemption is by no means absolute; that is, a plaintiff\n\nmay rely on a violation of an FDCA requirement as a predicate for a state tort claim\n\nwhere the plaintiff brings a claim for a “traditional state tort law which [] predated the\n\nfederal enactments in question[.]” Id. at 353. By contrast, if the state law claim would\n\nnot exist in the absence of the FDCA, “then the plaintiff is effectively suing for a\n\nviolation of the FDCA (no matter how the plaintiff labels the claim), and the plaintiff’s\n\nclaim is thus impliedly preempted under Buckman.” Riley v. Cordis Corp., 625 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 769, 777 (D. Minn. 2009) (citation omitted).\n\n       All this means that the doctrines of express and implied preemption, though\n\nrelated, are analytically distinct. The MDA’s express preemption provision prohibits a\n\nplaintiff from imposing additional requirements on a PMA-approved device, but allows\n\nenforcement of genuinely parallel state law requirements with respect to that device.\n\nImplied preemption in the medical-device context prohibits a plaintiff from enforcing\n\nFDCA requirements in the absence of a preexisting state law claim that addresses those\n\nsame duties, irrespective of whether the device was approved through the PMA process\n\n(as was the case with Medtronic’s MMT-522 Pump) or the § 510(k) substantial\n\nequivalence process (as was the case with the MMT-396 Infusion Set). With respect to\n\nPMA-approved medical devices, then, the interrelation between express preemption and\n\nimplied preemption produces a “narrow gap” in which plaintiffs can proceed to\n\nvindicate established state law duties that exist entirely independent of federal law, but\n\n\n\n\n                                            65\n\fonly to the extent that such common law tort claims are truly parallel to the\n\nrequirements of federal law. See Cupek, 405 F.3d at 423. But where applicable, either\n\ndoctrine suffices to prevent a plaintiff from advancing state common law claims\n\nregarding alleged injuries from the use of FDA-approved medical devices.\n\n        B.      With One Exception, The MDA Expressly Preempts All Of The\n                Kubickis’ MMT-522 Pump Claims\n\n        As a threshold matter, the instant parties dispute whether the insulin pump that\n\nwas prescribed to Caroline Kubicki at the time of her injury—Medtronic’s MMT-522\n\nPump—is a PMA-approved medical device such that express preemption applies at all.\n\n(See Medtronic’s Mem. at 15–16; Pls.’ Opp’n at 40–42.) They also disagree regarding\n\n(a) whether Plaintiffs have identified specific federal requirements that can form the\n\nbasis for a parallel state claim under Riegel (see Medtronic’s Mem. at 47–52; Pls.’\n\nOpp’n at 44–51); (b) whether Plaintiffs have, in fact, asserted state law claims that are\n\ngenuinely parallel to any such federal requirement (see Pls.’ Opp’n at 50–51;\n\nMedtronic’s Reply at 19); and (c) whether the alleged violation of state and federal law\n\ncaused Caroline’s injury (see Medtronic’s Mem. at 49–52, 52 n.12; Pls.’ Opp’n at 53–\n\n55; Medtronic’s Reply at 19–20). For the reasons explained below, this Court\n\nconcludes that Medtronic is entitled to summary judgment based on express preemption\n\nfor all of the tort claims that pertain to the MMT-522 Pump, with the exception of\n\nPlaintiffs’ pump-related manufacturing defect claim, which cannot be adequately\n\nassessed prior to expert discovery. 20 The Court’s conclusions regarding express\n\n\n20\n   With respect to this carve-out, the Court rejects Medtronic’s argument that it is entitled to summary\njudgment “because there is absolutely no evidence of any manufacturing defect with the MMT-522\nPump . . . Caroline was allegedly using at the time of the incident.” (Medtronic’s Mem. at 33; see also\nid. at 33–34 (arguing that manufacturing records show that Caroline’s pump using at the time\n\n\n\n                                                   66\n\fpreemption are based on its finding that (1) the FDA approved the MMT-522 Pump\n\nthrough the PMA process, and thus the MDA’s express preemption provision is\n\napplicable to that device, and (2) with respect to the non-manufacturing pump-related\n\nclaims, Plaintiffs have either failed to identify a specific FDA requirement upon which\n\ntheir allegedly parallel state law claims can be based, or failed to establish that any\n\ngenuinely equivalent parallel state law claim exists.\n\n                1.      State Law Claims Pertaining To The MMT-522 Pump Are\n                        Subject To The MDA’s Express Preemption Provision\n                        Because That Device Was Approved Pursuant To The FDA’s\n                        Premarket Approval Process\n\n        In support of its argument that the Kubickis’ pump-related claims are expressly\n\npreempted under the MDA, Medtronic points to evidence that it says “conclusively\n\ndemonstrates [that] the MMT-522 Pump has Premarket Approval.” (Medtronic’s Mem.\n\nat 44 (citing a declaration that it says establishes that “the FDA approved the MMT-522\n\nPump as a PMA supplement—PMA No. P980022/S013”).) Plaintiffs appear to accept\n\nthe representation that the insulin-delivery system of which the MMT-522 Pump is a\n\npart received the FDA’s stamp of premarket approval, but they argue that the FDA’s\n\napproval was not all-encompassing for the purpose of the MDA’s express preemption\n\nclause, because “the FDA did not approve the use of the MMT-522 Insulin Pump in\n\nisolation, but instead approved the Real Time System [consisting of the pump and a\n\n\nconformed with all applicable specifications and were free from manufacturing defects).) While\nPlaintiffs concede that they “do not have evidence at this point that there were any deviations from any\n. . . manufacturing specifications that the FDA approved[,]” (Mot. Hr’g Tr. at 28:21–24), their experts\nhave yet to conduct any destructive testing of the pump, (see id. at 29:2–30:6). Thus, this Court finds\nthat it would be premature to dismiss the claims that are based on the assertion that Medtronic deviated\nfrom the manufacturing specifications for the MMT-522 pump, and that such a deviation caused\nCaroline’s injury, prior to expert discovery. (See id. at 28:11–30:6.) See also Riegel, 552 U.S. at 321–\n22. If the proposed destructive testing of the pump is conducted during the expert discovery process,\nand if it does not reveal any evidence of a manufacturing defect, Medtronic may renew its preemption\ncontention with respect to the manufacturing defect claim.\n\n\n\n                                                   67\n\fblood glucose sensor] ‘as a whole’ and on the basis that it would purportedly be\n\nmarketed, sold, and ultimately used as a system[.]” (Pls.’ Opp’n at 41 (emphasis\n\nadded).) As a result, Plaintiffs say, Medtronic cannot rely on the express preemption\n\ndoctrine with respect to the MMT-522 Pump standing alone.\n\n      At least two federal district courts have rejected this same argument in the\n\ncontext of litigation pertaining to this same pump model. See Duggan, 840 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 471-73; Bentzley v. Medtronic, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2176199\"><a href=\"/opinion/2176199/bentzley-v-medtronic-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">827</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The\n\nplaintiffs in both Duggan and Bentzley argued—as Plaintiffs do here—that although\n\nMedtronic’s Paradigm Real Time System (which consists of both the MMT-522 Pump\n\nand a continuous glucose monitor) was approved through the PMA process, the MMT-\n\n522 Pump should be considered to be substantially equivalent to Medtronic’s earlier\n\nmodel MMT-515 pump, which had only “entered the market through the § 510k process\n\nand not the premarket approval process.” Duggan, 840 F. Supp. 2d at 471 (“The\n\nDuggans argue that while certain aspects of the Paradigm Real Time System may have\n\nreceived premarket approval, the [MMT-522] pump itself did not; instead, they contend,\n\nonly the capacity of the pump and the sensor to communicate with each other was\n\ngranted premarket approval.”); see Bentzley, 827 F. Supp. 2d at 451 (“Plaintiff attempts\n\nto raise an issue of material fact by arguing that the MMT–522 pump is separate and\n\napart from the insulin infusion system and did not gain approval through the PMA\n\nprocess.” (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).

In fact, courts that have dealt\n\nwith this issue have done just the opposite.” (citations omitted)); see also, e.g., Aaron.\n\nv.

This Court agrees with the persuasive views\n\nexpressed in these prior cases for several reasons.\n\n       To begin with, it is clear that breaking down a PMA-approved medical device\n\ninto its components for the purpose of evaluating the reach of the MDA’s express\n\npreemption clause, as Plaintiffs suggest, runs afoul of the statutory definition of\n\n“device” under the MDA. That is, per the statute, a medical “device” includes “any\n\ncomponent, part, or accessory[,]” 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), and in the context of the\n\nParadigm Infusion System, there is no question that the MMT-522 Pump is precisely\n\nsuch a component part. Thus, the MMT-522 Pump falls within the scope of the device-\n\nrelated PMA approval that Medtronic received.\n\n       Nor can this Court accept the Kubickis’ related argument that the FDA has\n\nconceded that only the Paradigm Infusion System as a whole—and not the MMT-522\n\nPump standing alone—was approved through the PMA process. (See Pls.’ Opp’n at 41\n\n(citing FDA Response to Citizen Petition, Sept. 23, 2011, Ex. C to Decl. of Michael\n\nBrown, ECF No. 133-5, at 56–58)). In this regard, Plaintiffs point to a Citizen Petition\n\n\n\n\n                                            69\n\fthat was submitted to the FDA in 2010, requesting that the FDA modify the PMA letter\n\nthe agency had issued for the Paradigm Infusion System to include the following\n\nlanguage: “This approval is limited solely to the ability of the pump to accept data\n\nfrom the sensor and the ability for the sensor to communicate directly to the pump, and\n\nthis approval does not extend to the pump itself.” (Id. at 57 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).) The FDA rejected this request, stating that it had “approved the PMA\n\nsupplement for the Paradigm System, including both the 522 pump and the Guardian RT\n\nsensor, on April 7, 2006[,]” and that the amendment request was being denied\n\n“[b]ecause the approval letter, as issued, applies to the Paradigm System as a whole[.]”\n\n(Id. at 58.) Like the Duggan and Bentzley courts (which considered and rejected the\n\nsame Citizen Petition argument Plaintiffs make here, see Duggan, 840 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n472; Bentzley, 827 F. Supp. 2d at 451), this Court sees no ambiguity in the agency’s\n\nstatements regarding the scope of the PMA approval: the letter states unequivocally\n\nthat “both the 522 pump and the Guardian RT sensor” had received premarket approval.\n\n(FDA Response to Citizen Petition at 58 (emphasis added).) And the fact that the\n\nagency expressly declined to amend its materials to exclude the pump from its PMA\n\napproval further underscores that it was not the agency’s intention for any such\n\nexclusion to be made. See Duggan, 840 F. Supp. 2d at 472 (“To the extent there was\n\nany ambiguity about the scope of the approval letter, this rejection of the Citizen\n\nPetition is the cherry on the icing.”).\n\n       In arguing that the MMT-522 Pump was not PMA approved and is therefore\n\nineligible for express-preemption treatment, the Kubickis actually make no mention of\n\nDuggan or Bentzley (see Pls.’ Opp’n at 40–42), and this Court sees no obvious reason to\n\n\n\n\n                                            70\n\freach a different conclusion than its sister courts did when those courts carefully\n\nconsidered whether Medtronic’s MMT-522 Pump should have received premarket\n\napproval for the purpose of the expression-preemption analysis. Therefore, this Court\n\nlikewise holds that the FDA granted the MMT-522 pump premarket approval, and that\n\nthe first prong of the Riegel test for express preemption (i.e., whether the medical\n\ndevice at issue is subject to federal requirements) is satisfied. See Duggan, 840 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 469 (explaining that “[t]he FDA’s premarket approval (‘PMA’) process\n\nimposes federal requirements on a medical device under the MDA”). 21\n\n                2.       Plaintiffs Have Not Established That Their Pump-Related\n                         State Law Claims Are Genuinely Equivalent To Specific\n                         Federal Law Requirements\n\n        Turning to the next step in the Riegel analysis, as explained above, plaintiffs who\n\nseek to counter a defendant’s authorized invocation of the MDA’s express preemption\n\nprovision with respect to a medical device that received premarket approval must\n\nidentify specific federal requirements with respect to which genuinely parallel state law\n\nclaims exist, and must plausibly allege that the defendants’ violation of state (and\n\nfederal) law in the claimed manner caused the plaintiffs’ injury. The Kubickis’ early\n\n\n21\n   The recent authority that Plaintiffs have brought to this Court’s attention, see Brackin v. Medtronic,\nNo. 12-cv-00734-KGB (W.D. Tenn. September 14, 2017), does not alter this Court’s conclusion. (See\nEx. 1 to Pls.’ Notice of Supp. Auth., ECF No. 156-1.) Brackin involved a motion to dismiss, and that\ncourt merely concluded that it could not “conclusively determine whether [the pump at issue has]\nreceived premarket approval” at that early stage of the litigation. Brackin, slip op. at 10; see also id. at\n6 (considering the express preemption defense but “emphasiz[ing] that this issue arises at the motion to\ndismiss stage”). The Brackin court also noted that the pump at issue therein was the MMT-523 Pump,\nand that defendants’ assertion that the MMT-522 Pump was a predecessor to the MMT-523 Pump was\n“insufficient to establish that the 523 pump was subject to premarket approval within the meaning of\nRiegel.” Brackin, slip. op. at 9. By contrast, this case concerns the MMT-522 Pump, and the record\nhere contains unrefuted evidence that the MMT-522 Pump received premarket approval as a component\nof the Real Time System. (See FDA Response to Citizen’s Petition.) Moreover, Brackin’s reasoning is\nnot binding on this Court, and to the extent that the Brackin court’s holding could be read to allow a\ncourt to break a PMA-approved system into component parts for purposes of the express preemption\nanalysis, this Court finds that the decision runs counter to the prevailing weight of authority cited\nabove and is unpersuasive.\n\n\n                                                    71\n\fattempts to accomplish this difficult task were “admittedly skimpy[,]” Kubicki, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1739580</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *8, but the Court deemed them passable for the purpose of Medtronic’s\n\nmotion to dismiss, id.

Given the\nlanguage of the Court’s ruling on the motion to dismiss, however, any such contention is misguided;\nindeed, the Court’s opinion sought to stave off this very argument by expressly stating that the\npreemption findings therein “should in no way be viewed as discounting Defendants’ argument that in\norder to avoid preemption, a plaintiff must specifically identify a federal requirement applicable to the\ndevice which the defendant allegedly violated and a valid, pre-existing state law duty that is genuinely\nparallel to that federal requirement, and [must] also explain how the alleged federal violation caused\nthe alleged injury.” Kubicki, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1739580</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *8 (emphasis omitted).\n\n\n                                                   72\n\fTherefore, for present purposes, the key question is which violations of state law are the\n\nKubickis claiming in regard to the MMT-522 Pump in the context of this action, and are\n\nthose state law claims truly parallel to identified federal law requirements applicable to\n\nthat device?\n\n        The Kubickis have brought five categories of state law claims in the instant\n\naction, including negligence, breach of warranty, and failure to warn (see supra Part\n\nIII.B), and importantly, they maintain that these state law claims do not impose any\n\nrequirements that are “different from, or in addition to” the FDA’s requirements, 21\n\nU.S.C. § 360(k)(a)(1), because these claims are predicated on the MMT-522 Pump\n\nhaving been “manufactured, designed, and labeled in violation of federal law[.]” (Pls.’\n\nOpp’n at 44(emphasis added).) 23 The federal requirements that Plaintiffs say Medtronic\n\nhas violated with respect to the design, manufacturing, and labeling of the MMT-522\n\nPump are certain of the FDA’s “current good manufacturing practice” (CGMP)\n\nrequirements—i.e., the generic FDA regulations that “govern the methods used in, and\n\nthe facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling,\n\nstorage, installation, and servicing of all finished devices intended for human use[,]” 21\n\nC.F.R. § 820.1(a)(1)—and also the FDA regulations that require medical device\n\nmanufacturers to monitor and report adverse events involving their products (see 21\n\nC.F.R. § 803, and to adhere to certain standards with respect to the product’s labeling\n\nand use instructions, see 21 C.F.R. §§ 801.5, 801.15.

See Riegel, 552 U.S. at 321–22.\n\n\n                                                   73\n\fMMT-522 Pump violates these particular federal standards, Plaintiffs cite the 2013\n\nWarning Letter that memorialized the FDA’s determination that Medtronic’s\n\nmanufacture and distribution of the MMT-522 Pump had transgressed certain CGMPs\n\n(see supra Part II.C.3), and they also point to the fact that Medtronic indisputably failed\n\nto report to the FDA certain post-approval adverse incidents regarding the pump. (See\n\nPls.’s Opp’n at 44–51.)\n\n       Plaintiffs are correct that the FDA once determined that Medtronic violated\n\nvarious CGMPs with respect to its production and marketing of the MMT-522 Pump,\n\nand it is undisputed that Medtronic failed to notify the FDA of certain adverse events\n\nthat were allegedly pump-related (including Caroline’s injury) in a timely manner. (See\n\n2013 Warning Letter at 25–26). But for the reasons that follow, this Court finds that\n\nthe CGMPs that Plaintiffs cite are generally insufficient to be the basis for an allegedly\n\nparallel state law claim regarding the MMT-522 Pump, and that there is no truly\n\nparallel state common law claim that pertains to the one sufficiently-specific federal\n\nlaw requirement that Plaintiffs rely upon (the requirement that manufacturers report\n\nadverse incidents).\n\n              a.      The CGMPs and general labeling and instruction\n                      regulations that Plaintiffs cite are insufficient to support a\n                      parallel state law claim asserting a design, manufacturing,\n                      or labeling defect, or a breach of warranty\n\n       The Kubickis say that their negligent design, manufacturing, labeling, and breach\n\nof warranty common law claims parallel the following CGMPs and other regulations\n\nthat pertain to product labeling and use instructions:\n\n          •   21 C.F.R. § 820.25 (requiring manufacturers to hire “sufficient”\n              personnel and ensure that they have the “necessary” education,\n              training and experience);\n\n\n\n                                             74\n\f•   21 CFR § 820.30 (requiring manufacturers, in general, to\n    establish maintain “procedures to control the design of the\n    device” in order to ensure that specified design requirements are\n    met);\n\n•   21 CFR § 820.50 (requiring manufacturers, in general, to\n    establish procedures to ensure products and services conform to\n    specified requirements);\n\n•   21 CFR § 820.70 (requiring manufacturers, in general, to\n    “establish and maintain process control procedures that describe\n    any process controls necessary to ensure conformance to\n    specifications”);\n\n•   21 CFR § 820.72 (requiring manufacturers to ensure that all\n    inspection, measuring, and test equipment is “suitable”);\n\n•   21 CFR § 820.75 (requiring manufacturers to establish,\n    maintain, and update process parameters and conduct\n    revalidations when processes or designs change, and to ensure\n    that “qualified individuals” perform the validated processes);\n\n•   21 CFR § 820.80 (requiring manufacturers, in general, to\n    “establish and maintain procedures for acceptance activities”);\n\n•   21 C.F.R. § 820.90 (requiring manufacturers, in general, to\n    “establish and maintain procedures to control product that does\n    not conform to specified requirements”);\n\n•   21 C.F.R. § 820.100 (requiring manufacturers, in general, to\n    “establish and maintain procedures for implementing corrective\n    and preventive action”);\n\n•   21 C.F.R. § 820.198 (requiring manufacturers to “establish and\n    maintain procedures for receiving, reviewing, and evaluating\n    complaints by a formally designated unit[,]” including ensuring\n    “timely” and “uniform” review of complaints);\n\n•   21 CFR § 820.250 (requiring manufacturers, “[w]here\n    appropriate,” to “establish and maintain procedures for\n    identifying valid statistical techniques required for establishing,\n    controlling, and verifying the acceptability of process capability\n    and product characteristics”);\n\n•   21 C.F.R. § 801.5 (requiring device manufacturers to provide\n    “adequate directions for use”); and\n\n\n\n                                  75\n\f          •   21 C.F.R. § 801.15 (requiring medical device labeling to be\n              “prominen[t] and “conspicuous[]”).\n\n(See 2d Am. Compl. ¶¶ 43–53.)\n\n       Medtronic insists that because these CGMPs and regulations pertaining to\n\nproduct labels and use instructions “are not device-specific regulations[,]” they cannot\n\nqualify as “device specific federal requirements” that can be the basis for any\n\npurportedly parallel state law claim “within the meaning of [the MDA’s express\n\npreemption clause].” (Medtronic’s Mem. at 48; see also id. at 49.) Thus, Medtronic\n\nappears to have invoked one side of an existing circuit split over whether the CGMPs\n\n“can[] support any viable parallel claim surviving express preemption[.]” (Id. at 48.)\n\nThe Eighth and Eleventh Circuits have held that a plaintiff cannot rely on the CGMPs to\n\nescape the MDA’s express preemption mandate, because the CGMPs are too general to\n\ncreate specific federal requirements that can be enforced under state law.

Aug. 26,\n\n2011) (concluding that a claim based on the alleged breach of FDA regulations was\n\npreempted where the regulations at issue “fail to provide any tangible or concrete\n\nstandard” because “to allow a violation of such a flexible standard to result in liability\n\nwould, in itself, be imposing a standard ‘different from, or in addition to’ those imposed\n\nby the MDA” (quoting 21 U.S.C. § 360k(a)(1))). In the absence of any guidance from\n\nthe D.C. Circuit on this issue, this Court finds such reasoning compelling, and thus it,\n\ntoo, concludes that the CGMPs that Plaintiffs have cited are insufficient to qualify as a\n\nfederal requirement upon which the Kubickis’ purportedly parallel state law claims can\n\nbe based.\n\n       As previously explained, in order to have a viable—i.e., not expressly\n\npreempted—state law claim for an injury allegedly caused by a medical device that\n\n\n\n\n                                            77\n\freceived premarket approval, the plaintiff must identify specific, concrete federal\n\nrequirements that are applicable to the device in question and that the manufacturer has\n\nallegedly violated in a manner that also gives rise to liability under state law. See\n\nCaplinger, 921 F. Supp. 2d at 1214. There is no question that if a state law claim is to\n\nbe identified as truly “parallel” (i.e., not demanding anything more of the manufacturer\n\nthan the federal law requires), the federal-requirement baseline must be specifically\n\nestablished; yet, by their nature, the CGMPs merely prescribe overarching guidelines\n\nfor manufacturers to follow when developing their own procedures, rather than\n\nspecifically enforceable duties. Indeed, the FDA itself has noted the flexibility that the\n\nCGMPs afford to manufacturers:\n\n              Because this regulation must apply to so many different types\n              of devices, the regulation does not prescribe in detail how a\n              manufacturer must produce a specific device. Rather, the\n              regulation provides the framework that all manufacturers must\n              follow by requiring that manufacturers develop and follow\n              procedures and fill in the details that are appropriate to a\n              given device according to the current state-of-the-art\n              manufacturing for that specific device.\n\nMedical Devices; Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) Final Rule; Quality\n\nSystem Regulation, 61 Fed. Reg. 52,602, 52,603 (Oct. 7, 1996) (emphasis added). This\n\nCourt is persuaded that federal regulations that admittedly “do[] not prescribe in detail\n\nhow a manufacturer must produce a specific device[,]” id., are incapable of serving as\n\nthe benchmark for a reasoned determination of whether state law claims that impose\n\nliability for a manufacturer’s failure to produce the device in a certain way establish\n\nduties that are truly parallel to the federal law.\n\n       The Sixth Circuit’s decision in Howard v. Sulzer Orthopedics, Inc., 382 F. App’x\n\n436, 440 (6th Cir. 2010), which Plaintiffs cite (see Pls.’ Opp’n at 45), is not to the\n\n\n\n                                              78\n\fcontrary. The plaintiff in Howard brought a claim for negligence per se, seeking relief\n\nfor injuries that he suffered when his implanted artificial knee failed due to oily residue\n\nleft behind on the implant as the result of the manufacturing processes. The Howard\n\ncourt concluded that these claims were not expressly preempted because the plaintiff\n\nhad “identif[ied] a specific GMP that he thought had been violated” and “the particular\n\nGMP that he cites is not so vague as to be incapable of enforcement.” 382 F. App’x at\n\n440 (emphasis added). The court in Bausch v.

Cf. Bausch,\n\n630 F.3d at 556 (“First, the meaning of the FDA’s requirements will present questions\n\nof law for the court to decide, not questions of fact for a jury to decide. Second, those\n\nquestions of law will be questions of federal law, subject to the usual processes for\n\nreconciling conflicting views.”).\n\n       Here, this Court finds that, for the most part, the CGMPs that Plaintiffs cite are\n\nsimply too vague and generic to form the foundation for a reasoned assessment of a\n\nparallel state claim for a design, manufacturing, or labeling defect, or for breach of\n\nwarranty. In their amended complaint, for example, Plaintiffs cite to 21 C.F.R.\n\n§ 820.25(a), which requires every manufacturer to “have sufficient personnel with the\n\nnecessary education, background, training, and experience to assure that all activities\n\nrequired by this part are correctly performed.” 21 C.F.R. § 820.25(a). (See also 2d\n\nAm. Compl. ¶ 48.) The federal regulations do not specify any ratio of employees to\n\nproducts, nor does it say whether “necessary education” means a GED, high school\n\n\n\n\n                                            79\n\fdiploma, bachelor’s degree, or otherwise. How, then, can a court reasonably determine\n\nthat common law negligence liability based on an allegedly insufficient number of\n\nqualified employees extends no farther than the federal regulation that it purportedly\n\nparallels? Similarly, elsewhere in their amended complaint, Plaintiffs cite to the CGMP\n\nregulation that requires manufacturers to “establish and maintain procedures to ensure\n\nthat the design requirements relating to a device are appropriate and address the\n\nintended use of the device, including the needs of the user and patient.” 21 C.F.R.\n\n§ 820.30(c). (See also 2d Am. Compl. ¶ 62.) Here, again, this regulation provides no\n\nguidance on what is specifically required to achieve compliance, and thus cannot serve\n\nas a genuine comparator for any considered evaluation of the scope of similar state law\n\nduties.\n\n          With respect to product labeling and use instructions, the non-CGMP regulations\n\nthat Plaintiffs cite similarly only require that information on a label be “conspicuous[]”\n\nand “prominen[t],” see 21 C.F. R. § 801.15, and that the manufacturer provide\n\n“adequate directions . . . under which the layman can use a device safely and for the\n\npurposes for which it is intended[,]” 21 C.F.R. § 801.5. Again, the lack of specificity\n\nwith respect to the demands of federal law means that there is no meaningful baseline\n\nagainst which to compare the requirements of the state common law, and thus no\n\nreasonable way to determine whether Plaintiffs’ state common law claims are truly\n\nparallel. And none of the other CGMPs and regulations that Plaintiffs reference—save\n\nthe adverse event reporting requirements, discussed below—are any more specific. 24\n\n\n24\n   See, e.g., 21 C.F.R. § 820.30(c) (“Each manufacturer shall establish and maintain procedures to\nensure that the design requirements relating to a device are appropriate and address the intended use of\nthe device, including the needs of the user and patient.”); id § 820.30(e) (“Each manufacturer shall\n\n\n\n                                                   80\n\f        Consequently, the FDA’s 2013 Warning Letter that put Medtronic on notice of\n\nits violation of certain generalized CGMP provisions is really of no moment,. To be\n\nsure, the FDA did find that Medtronic had violated certain CGMPs in the exercise of its\n\nexpertise and discretion, but none of the delineated violations specifically pertained to\n\nthe blocking of the vents on the p-cap (see infra Part III.C.3; 2013 Warning Letter at 2–\n\n25), and the FDA did not flesh out any of the general CGMPs in a manner that is\n\nsufficient to establish that the exact requirements of federal law such that Plaintiffs can\n\ncredibly claim that truly parallel state law requirements exist. The 2013 Warning Letter\n\nalso says nothing about the non-CGMP labeling and use instruction regulations on\n\nwhich Plaintiffs rely, and to this Court’s knowledge, the FDA has no otherwise\n\nilluminated the specific contours of those general federal standards.\n\n\n\nestablish and maintain procedures to ensure that formal documented reviews of the design results are\nplanned and conducted at appropriate stages of the device’s design development.

Plaintiffs have not identified a genuinely equivalent parallel\n                     state law claim pertaining to Medtronic’s failure to report\n                     events to the FDA\n\n       With respect to Plaintiffs’ reliance on 21 C.F.R. § 803 to support the state\n\ncommon law claims that arise from Medtronic’s alleged failure to track incidents and\n\nmake required reports to the FDA (see, e.g., 2d Am. Compl. ¶ 49), a slightly different\n\npreemption analysis is required. This particular regulation stands in stark contrast to\n\nthe general CGMPs and the product labeling and use instruction regulations described\n\nabove, because the reporting mandates laid out in this regulation are fairly specific\n\nabout what types of events must be reported to the agency and when. For example,\n\nsection 803.50(a) requires device manufacturers to make certain reports within 30 days\n\nof the manufacturer’s receipt of certain information, as follows:\n\n              (a) If you are a manufacturer, you must report to us the\n              information required by § 803.52 in accordance with the\n              requirements of § 803.12(a), no later than 30 calendar days\n              after the day that you receive or otherwise become aware of\n              information, from any source, that reasonably suggests that a\n              device that you market:\n\n                     (1) May have caused or contributed to a death or\n                     serious injury or\n\n                     (2) Has malfunctioned and this device or a similar\n                     device that you market would be likely to cause or\n                     contribute to a death or serious injury, if the\n                     malfunction were to recur.\n\nId. Another provision of this federal regulation requires Medtronic to report certain\n\ninformation within five days of becoming aware of an “event [that] necessitates\n\nremedial action to prevent an unreasonable risk of substantial harm to the public\n\nhealth[,]” id. § 803.53(a), and the precise information that such reports must contain is\n\nalso specified in the regulation, see id. § 803.52(a)–(c) (requiring the reporting of\n\n\n\n                                            82\n\f“[p]atient information[,]” including name, age, gender, and weight; the “[a]dverse event\n\nor product problem[,]” including the nature of the event, the date of the event, the date\n\nof the report, and any test results; and “[d]evice information[,]” including brand,\n\nmanufacture location, model number, and date the device was implanted). Thus, unlike\n\nthe general, flexible guidelines that the various CGMPs to which Plaintiffs point\n\nestablish, see supra Part VII.B.2, these particular reporting requirements are plainly\n\n“not so vague as to be incapable of enforcement.” Howard, 382 F. App’x at 440.\n\n        Where Plaintiffs’ preemption arguments fall short is with respect to Plaintiffs’\n\nobligation to assert state common law claims that are “genuinely equivalent” to these\n\nFDA regulations, Wolicki–Gables, 634 F.3d at 1300, such that the lawsuit does not\n\nimpose any requirements that are “different from, or in addition to, the federal ones,”\n\nRiegel, 552 U.S. at 321–22 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The\n\nKubickis’ counsel all but admitted during this Court’s motions hearing that no\n\nequivalent adverse event reporting claims exist under state law. (See Mot. Hr’g Tr. at\n\n17:9–14 (“So if you’re asking whether or not the District of Columbia has an identical\n\nrequirement, either codified in a state statute or that exists in common law, regarding\n\nthe tracking of complaints to take an example, the answer is no.”).) And that admission\n\nis, in effect, a concession that the Kubickis’ state law failure to warn claims that are\n\nbased on Medtronic’s alleged failure to report adverse events to the FDA are expressly\n\npreempted. See Riley, 625 F. Supp. 2d at 777. 25\n\n\n\n25\n   The cases on which Plaintiffs rely in this context—Hughes v. Boston Scientific Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"183315\"><a href=\"/opinion/183315/hughes-v-boston-scientific-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">631</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">762</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(5th Cir. 2011), and Stengel v.

In\nHughes, the plaintiffs were able to point to a specific Mississippi statute that contained reporting\nrequirements, see 631 F.3d at 769, and in Stengel, the court found that a failure to warn claim survived\na motion to dismiss where the state law “contemplates a warning to a third party such as the FDA[,]”\n704 F.3d at 1233.\n\n\n                                                   83\n\f      In their papers, Plaintiffs struggle mightily to avoid the implications of the\n\nundisputed fact that there is no D.C. common law claim that imposes liability for a\n\nmanufacturer’s failure to report to the FDA adverse incidents concerning an approved\n\nmedical device. For example, they point to the established D.C. common law claim for\n\nfailure to warn consumers of foreseeable harm associated with use of the product (see,\n\ne.g., 2d Am. Compl. Counts XVI–XVIII), and construct the following argument:\n\nbecause Medtronic failed to track adverse events adequately and to notify the FDA in a\n\ntimely manner of adverse events involving the over-delivery of insulin to patients,\n\nMedtronic deprived the FDA of important information regarding the pump that the\n\nagency could have then used to require Medtronic to change its label in order to provide\n\nthe adequate warnings to Caroline and her physicians regarding risks associated with\n\nthe pump that D.C. law requires. (See, e.g., 2d Am. Compl. ¶ 49 (“Medtronic’s failure\n\nto track and report adverse events kept important safety information from the FDA and,\n\ntherefore, device users such as Caroline Kubicki.”).) Thus, Plaintiffs insist that\n\nMedtronic’s violation of the federal reporting requirements effectively amounted to a\n\nfailure to warn consumers for the purpose of D.C.’s common law tort. (See, e.g., id.\n\n¶ 212.)\n\n      This creative effort to craft a D.C. common law claim that is substantially\n\nequivalent to the federal law’s adverse-event reporting requirements fails for at least\n\ntwo reasons. First of all, it ignores the overarching mandate that the state claim and the\n\nfederal claim must be genuinely—as opposed to effectively—equivalent. That is, if\n\nPlaintiffs’ core contention is that the state common law was violated because Medtronic\n\nfailed to warn consumers of device-related risks upon learning new adverse\n\n\n\n\n                                            84\n\finformation, then the federal requirement that such a claim actually parallels is a duty\n\nto warn consumers of device-related risks in light of new adverse events (i.e., the duty\n\nto update product labels post-approval), not the C.F.R.’s requirement that manufacturers\n\nreport such events to the FDA. Put another way, the common law failure to warn claim\n\nis not, in fact, the functional equivalent of a manufacturer’s failure to report adverse\n\nincidents to the FDA in violation of federal law, and Plaintiffs have not identified a\n\nfederal regulation that imposes upon manufacturers the specific obligation to warn\n\nconsumers of adverse post-approval events.\n\n       Second, Plaintiffs’ parallel state law claim argument ultimately relies on sheer\n\nspeculation: Plaintiffs contend that, if Medtronic had complied with the federal\n\nrequirement to report adverse events to the FDA, and if the FDA had directed Medtronic\n\nto update the label of the MMT-522 Pump based on these reported events, then\n\nMedtronic would have had the duty to provide adequate warnings to consumers, as D.C.\n\ncommon law requires. But it is by no means certain that the FDA would have directed\n\nMedtronic to give consumers different or additional information about the MMT-522\n\nPump if the agency had been made aware of other incidents that predated Caroline’s\n\nhypoglycemic injury. And unless such label changes would necessarily have occurred\n\nas a result of Medtronic’s failure to notify the FDA, Plaintiffs’ contention that\n\nMedtronic’s failure to notify the agency is the functional equivalent of failing to warn\n\nconsumers in violation of state law cannot be sustained. Cf. Webster, 259 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 36 (“Nor can plaintiffs create an issue of fact regarding their defective warning claim\n\nby speculating that if the FDA had known of the delayed perforation and tamponade\n\nincidents during the clinical trials and if defendant had investigated all the adverse\n\n\n\n\n                                            85\n\fincidents, the FDA would have either recalled the lead or placed it on alert, and\n\ntherefore, Dr. Lewis would not have implanted it in plaintiff’s heart.” (emphasis\n\nomitted)). Thus, this Court does not accept Plaintiffs’ argument that Medtronic’s\n\nestablished reporting failures are truly parallel to the complaint’s claims that Medtronic\n\nis liable for failing to provide adequate warnings to Caroline and her physicians\n\nregarding risks associated with the pump under District of Columbia law.\n\n       The court in In re Medtronic, Inc. Sprint Fidelis Leads Products Liability\n\nLitigation, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1816705\"><a href=\"/opinion/1816705/in-re-medtronic-inc-sprint-fidelis-leads-prods/\"><span class=\"volume\">592</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1147</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D. Minn. 2009), reached a similar conclusion about\n\nthe plaintiffs’ purportedly parallel state law claims in the context of a multi-district\n\nlitigation relating to another Medtronic product, when it characterized the state law\n\nclaims as actually and plainly imposing additional requirements on Medtronic under\n\nthese circumstances. It reasoned that a defective-labeling state law claim that is tied to\n\nthe manufacturer’s alleged failure to disclose new information it discovered after the\n\nFDA’s premarket approval of its medical device falls squarely within the preemptive\n\nscope of Riegel:\n\n              Plaintiffs cannot escape that under their theory of liability,\n              Medtronic would have been required to provide warnings\n              above and beyond those on the [] product label—a label that\n              was specifically approved by the FDA as part of the PMA\n              process. Mandating that a manufacturer provide warnings\n              beyond those on the device label would impose requirements\n              different from, or in addition to those approved by the FDA,\n              and are thus preempted.         Simply put, Section 360k(a)\n              preempts claims that are, as here, premised on a post-sale duty\n              to warn, where the plaintiff alleges the defendant was required\n              to provide additional warnings in light of later-received\n              reports of injury to others caused by the same medical device.\n\nId. at 1159 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                             86\n\f       The instant case involves this same dynamic, because the Kubickis’ pump-related\n\nfailure to warn claim are fundamentally based on the contention that Medtronic\n\nbreached a duty to provide additional warnings, and to recall the pump for label\n\nchanges, in light of the deficiencies in the device that the post-approval events revealed.\n\nBut the MDA’s express preemption clause prohibits the Court (or a jury) from making\n\nany such liability determination. See id.; see also Cupek, 405 F.3d at 424 (“Any claim,\n\nunder state law . . . that Defendant failed to warn patients beyond warnings required by\n\nthe FDA, or that Defendant failed to recall a product without first going through the\n\nPMA supplement process[,] would constitute state requirements ‘different from’ or ‘in\n\naddition to’ the requirements of the federal PMA application and supplement process.”\n\n(quoting 21 U.S.C. § 360k(a))); Horn v.

(See Medtronic’s Stmt. of Facts\n\n¶¶ 7–9.) Thus, the doctrine of express preemption is inapplicable to claims pertaining\n\nto the MMT-396 Infusion Set, see Lohr, 518 U.S. at 492–94, and the Kubickis can\n\nproceed with their infusion set-related state law tort claims so long as those claims do\n\nnot implicate the FDA’s exclusive authority to enforce the FDCA and its implementing\n\nregulations. See 21 U.S.C. § 337(a); see also Buckman, 531 U.S. at 349 n.4 (“The\n\nFDCA leaves no doubt that it is the Federal Government rather than private litigants\n\nwho are authorized to file suit for noncompliance with the medical device provisions.”).\n\n      In its prior opinion denying Medtronic’s motion to dismiss, the Court addressed\n\nthe issue of whether Plaintiffs’ claims relating to the MMT-522 Pump (the only claims\n\nasserted in the complaint at that time) were impliedly preempted, and determined that\n\nthey were not. See Kubicki, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1739580</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *11 (“Because Plaintiffs are\n\nasserting breach of recognized state law duties which are parallel to federal regulations\n\n(as opposed to an independent implied right action under the MDA to directly enforce\n\nthose regulation), their claims are not impliedly preempted under Buckman.” (citations\n\n\n                                            88\n\fand emphasis omitted)). This Court need not revisit the pump-related implied\n\npreemption evaluation now, because it has already decided that the Kubickis’ pump-\n\nrelated claims are expressly preempted in any event. (See supra Part VI.B.) 26 Thus, the\n\nonly preemption question that remains at this time is whether implied preemption bars\n\nthe Kubickis’ state law claims against Medtronic concerning the MMT-396 Infusion\n\nSet.\n\n        It is well established that state law tort claims with respect to a § 510(k) device\n\ncan persist unabated if they “rely[] on traditional state tort law [that] had predated the\n\nfederal enactments” that purportedly preempt them, Buckman, 531 U.S. at 353; and\n\nalternatively, state law claims are deemed impliedly preempted if “the existence of the\n\nfederal enactments is a critical element in their case[,]” id.

See id. at 343. The Supreme Court ruled that such a “fraud-on-the-FDA”\n\nclaim could not be established apart from the federal approval process, and would\n\n“inevitably conflict with the FDA’s responsibility to police fraud consistently with the\n\nAdministration’s judgment and objectives.” Id. at 350. Therefore, the Court held that\n\nthe fraud claim was impliedly preempted. See id. at 348; see also id. at 347–48 (noting\n\n\n26\n   As suggested above, when it comes to PMA-approved devices, the overly of express and implied\npreemption analyses results in a particularly complex, nuanced inquiry.

The courts of appeals have split over whether a state law failure to report\nclaim (when one is recognized) is impliedly preempted: the Sixth and Eighth Circuits have refused to\nallow state law tort claims based on alleged violations of FDA reporting requirements to proceed,\nfinding that such claims encroach on the FDA’s exclusive province to enforce the FDCA, see, e.g.,\nMarsh v. Genentech, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">693</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">546</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 553 (6th Cir. 2012) (holding that “failure to submit reports to\nthe FDA that the FDA requires is arguably a species of fraud on the agency under the state Act” that\ndirectly implicates that Supreme Court’s holding in Buckman); In re Medtronic, Inc., 623 F.3d at 1204,\nwhile the Fifth, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits have held that state law failure to report claims based on\nallegations that a manufacturer failed to report adverse events to the FDA are not impliedly preempted\nunder Buckman, because such claims are based on an alleged “breach of a ‘recognized state-law duty’\nrather than ‘an implied right of action under federal law[,]’” Hughes, 631 F.3d at 775 (quoting Bausch,\n630 F.3d at 557–58); see also, e.g., Stengel, 704 F.3d at 1233 (“The Stengels’ proposed new claim\nunder Arizona law, insofar as the state-law duty parallels a federal-law duty under the MDA, is not\npreempted.”). The D.C. Circuit has not waded into this dispute, and this Court finds no reason to do so\nhere, given Plaintiffs’ admission that there is no common law claim for failing to report adverse events\nto the FDA in this jurisdiction. The resulting inevitable conclusion is that the only potentially viable\nfailure to warn claim in Plaintiffs’ complaint is the contention that Medtronic breached its duty to warn\nconsumers directly. (See, e.g., 2d Am. Compl. ¶ 212 (alleging that Medtronic “breached its duty to\nwarn Caroline Kubicki, her parents, her physicians and the FDA of the foreseeable harm associated\nwith the use” of its product).)\n\n\n                                                   91\n\f1985); Russell v.

Therefore, this Court\n\nis persuaded that the Kubickis’ failure to warn consumers claim (i.e., their contention\n\nthat Medtronic negligently failed to warn consumers about the dangers of the MMT-396\n\nInfusion Set and to provide sufficient instructions for its safe use) exists independently\n\nof federal law in a manner that withstands Defendants’ implied preemption argument.\n\n       In sum, with respect to Medtronic’s preemption contentions, this Court concludes\n\nthat (1) Medtronic is entitled to summary judgment, on the basis of express preemption,\n\nwith respect to the all of the claims that pertain to the MMT-522 Pump (with the\n\nexception of Plaintiffs’ manufacturing defect claim), and (2) the Kubickis cannot\n\nmaintain a (non-existent) state law claim for Medtronic’s alleged failure to report to the\n\nFDA adverse events involving the MMT-396 Infusion Set, and thus Medtronic is\n\nentitled to summary judgment on any such claim on the basis of implied preemption,\n\nbut (3) the doctrine of implied preemption presents no bar to the Kubickis’ claims\n\nrelating to design, manufacture, and labeling of the MMT-396 Infusion Set, or to their\n\nclaims that Medtronic violated established state common law by failing to warn\n\nconsumers about risks associated with the MMT-396 Infusion Set.\n\n\nVIII. RULING ON THE LEARNED INTERMEDIARY DOCTRINE, THE\n      KUBICKIS’ INFUSION SET WARRANTY CLAIM, AND PUNITIVE\n      DAMAGES\n\n       Finally, this Court turns to a series of alternative and miscellaneous arguments\n\nthat Medtronic makes in support of its contention that it is entitled to an award of\n\nsummary judgment in this case.\n\n\n\n\n                                            92\n\f      A.     Medtronic Is Not Entitled To Summary Judgment With Respect\n             To The Failure To Warn Claims On The Basis Of The Learned\n             Intermediary Doctrine\n\n      To further assail the Kubickis’ unpreempted infusion set-related failure to warn\n\nconsumers claims, Medtronic points to “the learned intermediary doctrine” (Medtronic\n\nMem. at 63–66), which “holds that, because prescription [devices] are available to the\n\npublic only through a physician and are to be administered only under a physician’s\n\nsupervision, the [device] manufacturer’s duty is to adequately inform the physician,\n\nwho is expected to function as a ‘learned intermediary’ between the company and the\n\npatient in protecting the patient and providing direct information about the [device] to\n\nthe patient.’” MacPherson, 775 F. Supp. at 422-23; see also Patteson v. AstraZeneca,\n\nLP, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 34 (D.D.C. 2012) (“As long as the [prescription] manufacturer\n\nproperly warns a prescribing physician of the dangerous propensities of its product, the\n\nmanufacturer is excused from warning each patient who receives the [product].”). In\n\nthis regard, Medtronic argues that, because “Medtronic’s duty to warn of any dangers\n\nassociated with these products ran [only] to the licensed medical professional who\n\nprescribed them[,]” and because Dr. Dandona (Caroline’s physician) testified that “he\n\ndid not read or rely upon the warnings and would not have altered his decision to\n\nprescribe the MMT-522 Pump and MMT-396 Infusion Set” to Caroline even if the\n\nwarnings had been sufficient (Medtronic’s Mem. at 64), the Kubickis cannot establish\n\nthat Medtronic’s alleged failure to warn caused Caroline’s injury. In other words,\n\nthrough the learned intermediary doctrine, Medtronic maintains that the allegedly\n\ninadequate warnings—which Dr. Dandona admittedly did not see or read—could not\n\nhave caused Caroline’s injury, and thus the company cannot be held liable for its\n\nalleged failure to warn. (See id. (arguing that when the physician would have\n\n\n                                           93\n\fprescribed the medical device regardless of what he “may have read or not read,” or\n\n“when the prescribing physician did not read, or rely upon, the warnings that were\n\nactually provided, there can . . . be no liability”).)\n\n       This Court rejects Medtronic’s conclusion that there is no genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact related to its potential liability for the allegedly faulty labels and\n\ninstructions that purportedly failed to warn Caroline, her parents, and Dr. Dandona of\n\nthe risks pertaining to improper use of the MMT-396 Infusion Set for at least two\n\nreasons. First of all, the case law makes clear that, for the learned intermediate doctrine\n\nto absolve a manufacturer, the warning that is given to the professional must be\n\nadequate. See McNeil v. Wyeth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"48254\"><a href=\"/opinion/48254/mcneil-v-wyeth/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 368 (5th Cir. 2006 (“[E]ven in the\n\ncontext of a learned intermediary, if the warning to the intermediary is inadequate or\n\nmisleading, the manufacturer remains liable for injuries sustained by the ultimate user.”\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Patteson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 34 (holding\n\nthat if the manufacturer “properly warns a prescribing physician of the dangerous\n\npropensities of its product, the manufacturer is excused from warning each patient”\n\n(emphasis added)). The adequacy of the label and insert that Medtronic provided with\n\nthe MMT-396 Infusion Set is indisputably still at issue in this case, which plainly\n\nprecludes summary judgment in Medtronic’s favor on learned intermediary grounds.\n\nSee Payne, 486 A.2d at 723 (“[I]n cases in which there is a potential for serious injury,\n\nthe adequacy of even a relatively clear warning should not be determined as a matter of\n\nlaw but is a question of fact for the jury[.]”).\n\n       Second, and possibly even more significant, while Medtronic is correct to\n\nobserve that the professional’s actual reliance on the allegedly inadequate information\n\n\n\n\n                                              94\n\fthat a manufacturer provides is key to assessing causation, see Patteson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 34 (“An inadequate warning alone, however, is not enough; the learned-\n\nintermediary doctrine also requires that the inadequate warning be a ‘producing cause’\n\nof the plaintiff’s injury.”), Medtronic has not successfully established that there is no\n\ngenuine issue of fact regarding causation in the instant case. This is primarily because,\n\nalthough Dr. Dandona did testify that he did not review or rely upon the instructions for\n\nthe infusion set (see Dep. of Paresh Dandona (“Dandona Dep.”). Ex. 5 to Pls.’ Opp’n,\n\nECF No. 138-7, at 7:16–20), his sworn testimony reveals that Dr. Dandona was not the\n\nmedical professional who was responsible for reviewing Medtronic’s materials and\n\nexplaining to patients how to use the device. In response to a direct deposition question\n\nabout whether or not he had “ever reviewed [] the instructions for use for . . . the\n\ninfusion set?” Dr. Dandona stated:\n\n                 No. I’m – I’m not into the technology of each individual\n          pump. It’s too much. And that function is given to the CDEs,\n          who are the pump trainers, and they have all the details of that.\n                 So I sort of decide on the policy of installing a pump, the\n          kind of infusion rates that should be appropriate for a patient,\n          but the rest of the functions are carried out by the educators.\n\n(Id. at 7:19–8:2.) Thus, the record makes crystal clear that Dr. Dandona viewed his role\n\nas determining the overall “policy of installing a pump” and setting “the kind of\n\ninfusion rates that should be appropriate for a patient,” and that he delegated the\n\ntechnical responsibility of providing patients with instructions for using the prescribed\n\ninsulin-delivery device properly to agents he calls “pump trainers.” Yet, to this Court’s\n\nknowledge, the pump trainers have not testified in the context of this matter, so nothing\n\nin the record establishes that the pump trainers who instructed Caroline on how to use\n\nthe infusion set eschewed reading or relying upon the allegedly inadequate instructions\n\n\n\n                                            95\n\fand warnings that Medtronic included in the infusion set packaging. Furthermore,\n\nunder District of Columbia law, there is a presumption that the functional user of a\n\ndevice (here, the trainers) would have read the manufacturers’ instructions and would\n\nhave known how to use the device based on those instructions, in the absence of any\n\nevidence about what the trainers actually knew and said. See Payne, 486 A.2d at 725\n\n(explaining that the law presumes that “the user would have read an adequate warning,\n\nand that in the absence of evidence rebutting the presumption, a jury may find that the\n\ndefendant’s product was the producing cause of the plaintiff’s injury”).\n\n       Consequently, on the record the parties have provided, a reasonable jury might\n\nwell conclude that Medtronic’s infusion set instructions (imparted to Caroline by the\n\npump trainers) were inadequate and ultimately caused Caroline’s injury, despite Dr.\n\nDandona’s testimony regarding his own personal lack of review and reliance on any\n\nsuch instructions when he prescribed the device to Caroline. Put another way, contrary\n\nto Medtronic’s contentions, it was Caroline’s pump trainer, not Dr. Dandona, who was\n\nthe pertinent ‘learned intermediary’ for the purpose of Plaintiffs’ failure to warn claim,\n\nand thus, Dr. Dandona’s testimony about his own personal lack of reliance on\n\nMedtronic’s materials (without regard to what the agents who served as the relevant\n\ninstructing professionals for present purposes relied upon) is manifestly insufficient to\n\nbreak the chain of causation between the allegedly inadequate instructions and\n\nCaroline’s injury as a matter of law.\n\n\n\n\n                                            96\n\f       B.      Medtronic Is Entitled To Summary Judgment On Plaintiffs’\n               Breach Of Express Warranty Claim Because The Statements\n               On Which Plaintiffs Rely Do Not Create An Actionable\n               Warranty\n\n       Medtronic also insists that summary judgment is warranted with respect to the\n\nthe MMT-396 Infusion Set breach of warranty claims that Plaintiffs have brought. (See\n\nMedtronic’s Mem. at 67–68; Medtronic’s Reply at 30–31.) 28 As clarified in Plaintiffs’\n\nopposition brief, the Kubickis allege that Medtronic warrantied that the MMT-396\n\nInfusion Set was safe and functional through advertising and promotional statements\n\nabout that product, and Medtronic also represented that design modifications to the\n\nventing system made the insulin-deilvery system safer, but that turned out not to be so.\n\n(See Pls.’ Opp’n at 81–82 (pointing to statements that Medtronic made in advertising\n\nmaterials, including that Medtronic infusion sets “ensure success”; that the vents in the\n\np-cap would reduce “clogging and malfunction”; and that Medtronic infusion sets “are\n\nmade with patented tubing, which is clog and kink resistant, assuring that the insulin is\n\nbeing safely delivered” (quoting Medtronic Infusion Set Brochure, Ex. 65 to Pls.’\n\nOpp’n, ECF No. 138-68, at 3).) 29 As explained below, this Court finds that Medtronic\n\nis entitled to summary judgment on these express warranty claims, because the\n\nstatements to which Plaintiffs point do not amount to an enforceable warranty.\n\n\n\n28\n   This Court has already held that any warranty claims relating to the MMT-522 Pump are expressly\npreempted. See supra Part VII.B.\n29\n   Notably, the Kubickis’ express warranty contentions, which reference Medtronic’s advertising and\npromotional materials, differ from the complaint’s related claim that Medtronic included an express\nwarranty in the product packaging for the MMT-396 Infusion Set. (See 2d Am. Compl. ¶ 160.)\nPlaintiffs appear to have abandoned their product-packaging express warranty claim, as they have not\ncountered Medtronic’s representation that the infusion set lots at issue in this case “were not\naccompanied by any warranty.” (Medtronic’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 27; see also Pls.’ Opp’n at 81–82\n(arguing that, with respect to the infusion set, a warranty existed as a result of statements made in\nadvertisements).)\n\n\n\n                                                  97\n\f       In order to succeed on a breach of warranty claim under District of Columbia\n\nlaw, a plaintiff must prove “that the defendant breached an express promise made about\n\nthe product sold.” Witherspoon v.

Code explains that an enforceable express warranty arises when the\n\nseller makes to the buyer “(a) [a]ny affirmation of fact or promise . . . which relates to\n\nthe goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain” or “(b) [a]ny description of the\n\ngoods which is made part of the basis of the bargain[.]” D.C. Code § 28:2-313(1). In\n\neither case, such an expression “creates an express warranty that the goods shall\n\nconform to the [description], affirmation or promise.” Id. An express warranty can\n\nexist even if the seller does not use the words “warrant” or “guarantee,” but it is well\n\nestablished that “an affirmation merely of the value of the goods or a statement\n\npurporting to be merely the seller’s opinion or commendation of the goods does not\n\ncreate a warranty.” D.C. Code. § 28:2-313(2). Furthermore, when the plaintiff alleges\n\nonly that a manufacturer’s “advertisements and promotionals statements contained\n\nbroad claims amounting to a warranty[,]” the alleged breach of warranty claim cannot\n\nsurvive.

Ingersoll-Rand Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1872688\"><a href=\"/opinion/1872688/rogers-v-ingersoll-rand-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">971</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

To the\n\nextent that Plaintiffs seek punitive damages as a separate cause of action, Medtronic’s\n\nmotion is well-founded, and this Court can easily dispose of such claims, as it is clear\n\nbeyond cavil that the District of Columbia only recognizes punitive damages as a\n\n\n                                           101\n\fremedy and not an independent cause of action.

Therefore, and on this basis alone,\n\nMedtronic is entitled to summary judgment on Counts XXI, XXII, and XXIII of\n\nPlaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint.\n\n       However, notably, nothing in this Court’s decision should be construed as\n\nprecluding Plaintiffs from seeking punitive damages as a remedy at the appropriate\n\ntime. That is, insofar as Medtronic argues that no such remedy is available on the\n\ncurrent record (see Medtronic’s Mem. at 69–70), the parties are reminded that the\n\nrecord is subject to further development in this case, because they have yet to engage in\n\nexpert discovery. (See supra Part V.) This Court will not accept Medtronic’s\n\nsuggestion that it evaluate—and foreclose completely—any punitive damages remedy\n\nnow; instead, the Court will await future discussion of the appropriateness of Plaintiffs’\n\nrequest for punitive damages in the context of the parties’ preparations for trial. Cf.\n\nD.C. Std. Civ. Jury Instr. Nos. 13-12, 16-2, 16-3.\n\n\nIX.    CONCLUSION\n\n       The facts of this matter are relatively straightforward—a tragic, devastating\n\ninjury purportedly caused by Defendants’ allegedly tortious conduct with respect to a\n\nwidely marketed insulin-delivery device—but the intersection of law and life can be\n\nquite complicated. Even prior to engaging in expert discovery, Medtronic and\n\nUnomedical have vigorously maintained that the Kubickis cannot persist with the\n\nvarious state law claims they have filed pertaining to the MMT-522 Pump and MMT-\n\n\n\n                                           102\n\f396 Infusion Set for several nuanced reasons, and having carefully reviewed the parties’\n\nsummary judgment filings and the exhibits thereto, as well as their statements of fact,\n\nthis Court agrees with Defendants with respect to certain claims, and disagrees with\n\nrespect to others. For the reasons explained at length above, the Court finds that\n\nUnomedical is entitled to summary judgment with respect to all of the claims Plaintiffs\n\nhave brought against it on timeliness grounds, and Medtronic is entitled to summary\n\njudgment with respect to certain claims, as follows: (1) all of Plaintiffs’ claims that\n\npertain to the MMT-522 Pump, except Plaintiffs’ manufacturing defect claim, (2)\n\nPlaintiffs’ claims that Medtronic failed to report to the FDA adverse events regarding\n\nthe MMT-396 Infusion Set in violation of state law, (3) Plaintiffs’ breach of warranty\n\nclaims, and (4) Plaintiffs’ stand-alone claim for punitive damages. However, the Court\n\nconcludes that genuine issues of material fact remain with respect to Plaintiffs’\n\nnegligent design, manufacture, labeling, and failure to warn consumers claims relating\n\nto the MMT-396 Infusion Set, and that there are also triable issues of fact with respect\n\nto causation—at least for now. Thus, as set forth in the accompanying order,\n\nUnomedical’s Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED, Medtronic’s\n\nMotion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part, and the\n\nparties are ordered to submit a joint proposed schedule for expert discovery.\n\n\n\nDATE: February 5, 2018                    Ketanji Brown Jackson\n                                          KETANJI BROWN JACKSON\n                                          United States District Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                           103\n\f</pre>",
