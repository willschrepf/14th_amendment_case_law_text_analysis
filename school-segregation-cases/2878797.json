In his Bivens action, Davis alleges that officials at\n\fthe United States Penitentiary-Allenwood retaliated against him for taking legal or\n\nadministrative action against a program coordinator at the prison. Specifically, Davis\n\ncontends that the defendants planted a seven-inch sharpened metal rod in his locked\n\nlocker (located within his two-person cell) and charged him with possession,\n\nmanufacture, or introduction of a weapon. Davis also claims that his right to due process\n\nwas violated during the subsequent disciplinary hearing and resulting sentence of 60 days\n\nin disciplinary segregation.\n\n       In response to the complaint, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the\n\ncomplaint or, alternatively, for summary judgment. The District Court entered summary\n\njudgment in the defendants’ favor; this timely appeal followed.1 Because the appeal\n\nlacks arguable merit, we will dismiss it pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B).\n\n       To prove retaliation, a prisoner must demonstrate 1) that he engaged in\n\nconstitutionally-protected conduct, 2) an adverse action by prison officials, sufficient to\n\ndeter a person of ordinary firmness from exercising his constitutional rights, and 3) a\n\ncausal link between the exercise of the rights and the adverse action taken against him.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n         We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We exercise plenary review over\nthe District Court’s decision to grant summary judgment. See Torres v. Fauver, 292 F.3d\n141, 145 (3d Cir. 2002). Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine\nissue of material fact. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. A genuine issue of material fact exists only\nwhere a reasonable jury could find for the non-moving party in light of the evidence\npresented. See Childers v. Joseph, 842 F.2d 689, 693-94 (3d Cir. 1988). We review the\nfacts in a light most favorable to the party against whom summary judgment was entered,\nand where the parties’ evidence is in conflict, we accept the non-movant’s as true. See\nPastore v. Bell Telephone Co. of Pa., 24 F.3d 508, 512 (3d Cir. 1994).\n\n                                              2\n\fSee Mitchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d 523, 530 (3d Cir. 2003). In granting summary judgment,\n\nthe District Court concluded that because Davis was not prevented from pursuing this\n\nsuit or administratively exhausting his claims, any adverse action failed the deterrence\n\nprong. The District Court also found Davis’ evidence of a causal link lacking.\n\n       We agree that Davis’ retaliation claim fails, but for different reasons. Though his\n\nallegations are not precisely clear, Davis claims either that prison officials planted a\n\nseven-inch knife-like metal rod in his locker, or that officials legitimately found a pair of\n\ngloves and a metal sardine can top (prohibited items), and later changed the paperwork to\n\nmake it look as if they had found the knife. We find no credible evidence to support\n\neither claim. Davis provides no support for his assertion that the defendants deliberately\n\ndestroyed a surveillance tape that would show that the weapon was not legitimately\n\ndiscovered. Instead, the evidence shows that by the time the appropriate staff member\n\nwas contacted nearly two months after the incident, the tape was recorded over as part of\n\na regular practice of recycling surveillance tapes after a certain amount of time has\n\npassed. There is also evidence, not addressed by Davis, that even if it existed, the tape\n\nwould not be fruitful because the surveillance system does not record activity inside the\n\ncell. Davis’ allegation that the weapon that prison officials planted was one previously\n\nseized from another inmate is refuted by the disciplinary hearing officer’s specific\n\nfinding that the two weapons are not similar. Davis offers no evidence to support his\n\nassertion that the disciplinary report documenting the event originally charged him with\n\npossession of an unauthorized item, but was then changed to the more serious weapon\n\n                                              3\n\fcharge. Finally, Davis’ allegations regarding time discrepancies in reports documenting\n\nthe events do not support his larger planted-weapon claim. For these reasons, we\n\nconclude that Davis has not shown adverse action by prison officials.\n\n       With regard to the due process claim, Davis’ procedural due process rights are\n\ntriggered by deprivation of a legally cognizable liberty interest. See Mitchell, 318 F.3d at\n\n531. If Davis has no protected liberty interest in remaining free of disciplinary custody,\n\nthen the Fourteenth Amendment does not obligate the state to provide him with process.\n\nId. Here, the District Court concluded that because Davis’ sanction did not include the\n\nloss of good conduct time, he did not possess a liberty interest, and accordingly, was not\n\nentitled to due process rights.\n\n       Though we agree with the conclusion, the analysis is incomplete. Though the\n\nSupreme Court has found that the loss of good time credits entitles prisoners to\n\nappropriate due process, see Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 556-57 (1974), the\n\nquestion of whether a sanction implicates a liberty interest is not answered by looking at\n\ngood time credits alone. A liberty interest may also be present where a punishment\n\nentails an “atypical and significant hardship.” Mitchell, 318 F.3d at 532 (citation\n\nomitted). Courts are required to look into this possibility. See id. at 533 n.6. In order to\n\ndo so, a court should perform a fact-specific inquiry evaluating “the duration of\n\ndisciplinary confinement and the conditions of that confinement in relation to other\n\nprison conditions.” Id. at 532 (citation omitted).\n\n       Applying these criteria, we conclude that Davis has not shown that he had a liberty\n\n                                              4\n\finterest at stake. He has provided no evidence that the conditions during his 60 days of\n\ndisciplinary segregation involved atypical or significant hardship. Contra id. at 528, 533\n\n(“deplorable” conditions of prisoner’s cell in restricted housing unit included human\n\nwaste smeared on the walls, infestation by insects, and nightly kicking and banging on\n\nthe walls by other inmates). In addition, this Court has found several times that\n\nrestrictive confinement for a much longer period than that imposed upon Davis does not\n\nimplicate the prisoner’s liberty interests. See Smith v. Mensinger, 293 F.3d 641, 645,\n\n654 (3d Cir. 2002) (seven months disciplinary confinement); Torres v. Fauver, 292 F.3d\n\n141, 151-52 (3d Cir. 2002) (disciplinary detention for fifteen days and administrative\n\nsegregation for 120 days); Griffin v. Vaughn, 112 F.3d 703, 706-09 (3d Cir. 1997)\n\n(fifteen months administrative detention). Davis offers no other reason why the sanction\n\nagainst him meets the standard.\n\n       In sum, we conclude that the District Court properly dismissed Davis’ claims.\n\nBecause this appeal lacks merit, we will dismiss it pursuant to 28 U.S.C.§ 1915(e)(2)(B).\n\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\f",

McDonnell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109097\"><a href=\"/opinion/109097/wolff-v-mcdonnell/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">539</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 556-57 (1974), the\n\nquestion of whether a sanction implicates a liberty interest is not answered by looking at\n\ngood time credits alone. A liberty interest may also be present where a punishment\n\nentails an “atypical and significant hardship.” Mitchell, 318 F.3d at 532 (citation\n\nomitted). Courts are required to look into this possibility. See id. at 533 n.6. In order to\n\ndo so, a court should perform a fact-specific inquiry evaluating “the duration of\n\ndisciplinary confinement and the conditions of that confinement in relation to other\n\nprison conditions.” Id. at 532 (citation omitted).\n\n       Applying these criteria, we conclude that Davis has not shown that he had a liberty\n\n                                              4\n\finterest at stake. He has provided no evidence that the conditions during his 60 days of\n\ndisciplinary segregation involved atypical or significant hardship. Contra id. at 528, 533\n\n(“deplorable” conditions of prisoner’s cell in restricted housing unit included human\n\nwaste smeared on the walls, infestation by insects, and nightly kicking and banging on\n\nthe walls by other inmates). In addition, this Court has found several times that\n\nrestrictive confinement for a much longer period than that imposed upon Davis does not\n\nimplicate the prisoner’s liberty interests.

Mensinger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778006\"><a href=\"/opinion/778006/carl-m-smith-v-robin-mensinger-david-novitsky-jerome-paulukonis-mary/\"><span class=\"volume\">293</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 645,\n\n654 (3d Cir. 2002) (seven months disciplinary confinement); Torres v.

Davis offers no other reason why the sanction\n\nagainst him meets the standard.\n\n       In sum, we conclude that the District Court properly dismissed Davis’ claims.\n\nBecause this appeal lacks merit, we will dismiss it pursuant to 28 U.S.C.§ 1915(e)(2)(B).\n\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\f</pre>",
