May Oil & Gas Company, Ltd. (the “Herbsts”)\n                   assert that Murphy Exploration & Production Co.-USA\n                   breached its obligations under the offset well provisions\n                   in both leases.\n\nTrial Court:       Plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment on\n                   the issue of the breach. Supplemental Clerk’s Record\n                   (SCR) 401. Murphy filed a motion for partial summary\n                   judgment on that issue as well. SCR 119. After a hearing\n                   on the motions, the trial court sent a letter to the parties\n                   stating that she was granting Murphy’s motion and\n                   denying Plaintiffs’ motion.        SCR 433.     Instead of\n                   submitting an order on the partial summary judgment\n                   motions, Murphy submitted a Motion for Entry of Final\n                   Judgment, seeking attorney’s fees in addition to the\n                   ruling on the breach issue. SCR 379.\nTrial Court\nDisposition:       Without conducting a hearing on the Motion for Entry of\n                   Final Judgment, the trial court entered judgment for\n                   Murphy. SCR 414. The judgment denied Murphy an\n                   award of trial court fees but awarded Murphy $150,000 in\n                   fees in the event Plaintiffs pursued an unsuccessful\n                   appeal. Plaintiffs filed motions for new trial and to\n                   vacate, modify or reconsider the judgment. SCR 417.\n                   After a hearing on Plaintiffs’ motions, the trial court\n                   entered an amended final judgment that reduced the\n                   amount of fees to be awarded on appeal but left intact the\n                   summary judgment for Murphy.

Provisions like the one here exist in many oil\n\nand gas leases.    Alfred Steinle, who drafted the leases at issue here,\n\nsubmitted an amicus letter to the trial court in which he stated that he has\n\n“prepared hundreds of leases that contain this same offset clause provision\n\nfor mineral interest owners in this part of the State.” SCR 448.\n\n      Lessors and lessees alike need to know how the rules of contract\n\nconstruction apply to these offset clauses.\n\n      Oral argument will assist the Court in resolving this issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                     xiii\n\f                     ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n1.    The district court erred in granting Murphy’s motion for\nsummary judgment, which allows Murphy to satisfy its\nobligation to drill an offset well simply by drilling a well\nanywhere on the Herbst Leases.\n\n2.    The district court erred in awarding Murphy attorney’s\nfees on appeal because (a) the district court had no authority to\naward fees and (b) the award was an abuse of discretion.\n\n\n\n\n                               xiv\n\f                         STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\nA.    The Dispute.\n\n      The Herbsts are the royalty owners under two oil and gas leases\n\n(“Leases”) on two 302-acre tracts of land in Atascosa County. SCR 6-7, 150-\n\n70. Shirley Mae Herbst Adams is the owner of the executive rights in one\n\ntract (“Shirley Tract”), and William Albert Herbst is the owner of the\n\nexecutive rights in the other tract (“William Tract”).\n\n      Murphy is the lessee/operator under those Leases. SCR 120. Each\n\nlease contains an Offset Clause, paragraph 25, which imposes obligations\n\non the lessee when a well is drilled on adjacent property within 467 feet of\n\nthe boundary or lease line. SCR 155, 166 (¶ 25). Murphy contends that, as\n\na matter of law, it has drilled an offset well in compliance with the Offset\n\nClauses. The Herbsts contend Murphy has not drilled such a well.\n\n      The Offset Clauses in the Herbst Leases state that, if a well “is\n\ncompleted as a producer of oil and/or gas on land adjacent and contiguous\n\nto the leased premises, and within 467 feet of the premises covered by this\n\nlease, … [then], within 120 days after the completion date of the well or\n\nwells on the adjacent acreage,” the lessee must either:\n\n\n\n                                       1\n\f      (1) commence drilling operations on the leased acreage and\n      thereafter continue the drilling of such off-set well or wells with\n      due diligence to a depth adequate to test the same formation\n      from which the well or wells are producing from on the\n      adjacent acreage; or\n\n      (2) pay the Lessor royalties as provided for in this lease as if an\n      equivalent amount of production of oil and/or gas were being\n      obtained from the off-set location on these leased premises as\n      that which is being produced from the adjacent well or wells; or\n\n      (3) release an amount of acreage sufficient to constitute a\n      spacing unit equivalent in size to the spacing unit that would\n      be allocated under this lease to such well or wells on the\n      adjacent lands, as to the zones or strata producing in such\n      adjacent well.\n\nSCR 155, 166 (¶ 25).\n\n      These provisions do not leave the lessee without protection from\n\nhaving to drill an uneconomic well. The lessee has three options: drill the\n\noffset well, pay substitute royalties equal to what the royalties would be on\n\nthe neighboring well, or release acreage.         Thus, if the lessee believes\n\ndrilling the offset well is not in its best interests, it has the option either to\n\npay the substitute royalties or to release acreage so that the Herbsts can\n\neither drill the well themselves or seek another operator for that part of\n\ntheir mineral estate.\n\n\n\n\n                                        2\n\f      Comstock Oil & Gas, LP drilled a well, the Lucas A (the “Lucas\n\nWell”) on the tract just to the southwest of the Shirley and William Tracts.\n\nSCR 86-87; 114, ¶ 9; 148. The well was completed in the Eagleville (Eagle\n\nFord-1) Field, and began producing.        The lateral of the Lucas Well is\n\nlocated 350 feet from the boundaries of the Shirley and William Tracts,\n\nthereby triggering Murphy’s duties under the Offset Clauses. SCR 121.\n\n      Murphy did not pay royalties or release acreage, as permitted under\n\nthe Offset Clauses.    Instead, Murphy asserts that it exercised the first\n\noption: it “chose to drill an offset well.” SCR 123.\n\n      Murphy claims that a horizontal well it drilled on the opposite\n\nboundaries/lease lines of Shirley’s and William’s Tracts – the Herbst Unit B\n\n#1H well (“Herbst B”) – qualifies as an offset well under both Leases. SCR\n\n121-22. As permitted and drilled, the lateral of the Herbst B well runs\n\nparallel to and approximately 450 feet from the northeast line of the Shirley\n\nand William Tracts. SCR 148. Thus, the Herbst B well is over 2,100 feet\n\nfrom the Lucas well, almost as far away from the Lucas well as it could\n\npossibly be and still be located on the Shirley and William Tracts.\n\n      Provided below is a simplified sketch of the tracts and the horizontal\n\nwells, which run the length of the black lines depicting them:\n                                      3\n\f     B.    The Lawsuit.\n\n     The Herbsts sued Murphy for failure to comply with Murphy’s\n\nobligations under the Offset Clauses, seeking the substitute royalties\n\nattributable to the Lucas well and filing a motion for partial summary\n\njudgment on the issue of the breach. SCR 5-11; 40. Murphy filed a motion\n\n\n                                   4\n\ffor partial summary judgment on the breach issue as well. SCR 119. After\n\na hearing on the motions, the trial court sent a letter to the parties stating\n\nthat it was granting Murphy’s motion and denying Plaintiffs’ motion. SCR\n\n433. Instead of submitting an order on the partial summary judgment\n\nmotions as instructed, Murphy submitted a Motion for Entry of Final\n\nJudgment, seeking attorney’s fees in addition to the ruling on the breach\n\nissue. SCR 379.\n\n       Without conducting a hearing on the Motion for Entry of Final\n\nJudgment, the trial court signed a judgment for Murphy. SCR 414. The\n\njudgment crossed out Murphy’s proposed award of trial court fees but\n\nawarded Murphy $150,000 in fees in the event the Herbsts pursued an\n\nunsuccessful appeal. SCR 414. The Herbsts filed motions for new trial and\n\nto vacate, modify or reconsider the judgment. SCR 417. After a hearing on\n\nthose motions, the trial court entered an amended final judgment that left\n\nthe other relief granted to Murphy intact, continued to deny trial court fees\n\nbut still awarded fees on appeal – this time in a reduced amount. SCR 485.\n\n       From that judgment, the Herbsts timely perfected this appeal. SCR\n\n490.\n\n\n\n                                      5\n\f                         SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n      The district court erred in granting a summary judgment that holds\n\nMurphy’s drilling of a well more than 2,100 feet from a well on adjacent\n\nproperty satisfies its obligation to drill an offset well. The purpose of an\n\noffset well is to protect against drainage from a mineral owner’s property\n\nby a well drilled on a neighboring tract. The plain language of the Leases\n\nmakes clear that an offset well must be in close proximity to the well it is\n\nsupposed to offset. Murphy argues there is no distance requirement. But\n\nthere is a distance that triggers Murphy’s offset obligations – that distance\n\nis the location of a neighboring well 467 feet from Plaintiffs’ lease\n\nboundary.    Murphy claims that a well located 2,100 feet from that\n\nneighboring well – 1,800 feet from the Leases’ boundaries – is an offset well\n\nwithin the meaning of the Offset Clauses. If all Murphy had to do to satisfy\n\nthe Offset Clauses was drill a well, the offset clause would have said that.\n\nIt did not; it added the term “offset” to describe the well that had to be\n\ndrilled.\n\n      Murphy’s and the trial court’s interpretation of the Leases renders the\n\nword “offset” meaningless.     Take that word out, and the trial court’s\n\n\n\n                                      6\n\finterpretation makes sense. However, all words in the Offset Clauses must\n\nbe given effect.\n\n      The trial court’s acceptance of Murphy’s interpretation of the Leases\n\nviolates basic rules of contract construction by failing to give meaning and\n\neffect to each provision of the Leases and by failing to the give the words in\n\nthe Offset Clauses their plain meaning.       The holding undermines the\n\npurpose of explicit offset clauses, which is to eliminate the need to actually\n\nprove drainage. The holding is also inconsistent with the understanding in\n\nthe industry of what constitutes an offset well.\n\n      Murphy relied on a conclusory expert affidavit regarding the\n\nmeaning of the term “offset well” as support for its motion.           Expert\n\ntestimony is not needed to interpret the Offset Clauses. Their meaning can\n\nbe readily determined from the plain language and the context in which\n\nthe Offset Clauses were used. Provisions like those found in these Leases\n\nare designed to explicitly define what lessees must do when a well is\n\ndrilled on adjacent property within a specific distance from the lease line.\n\nThat plain language is consistent with every dictionary and industry\n\ndefinition provided by either the Herbsts or by Murphy.\n\n\n\n                                      7\n\f      Murphy’s expert affidavit is conclusory, misreads the regulatory\n\ndecisions on which the expert based his opinions, and is improperly based\n\non terms not found in the Leases. The affidavit is either no evidence at all\n\nor, at best, raises a fact issue on the meaning of the Offset Clauses.\n\n      In addition to erring in granting summary judgment on the meaning\n\nof the Offset Clauses, the trial court both erred and abused its discretion in\n\nawarding appellate attorney’s fees.        The trial court had no statutory\n\nauthority to award Murphy fees – the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act\n\ncannot be used to award fees for defending against a breach of contract\n\nclaim. In addition, even if the trial court had authority to award fees, its\n\ndecision to award fees only in the event the Herbsts pursued an\n\nunsuccessful appeal creates an improper disincentive for the exercise of the\n\nright of appeal and is a clear abuse of discretion.\n\n                                ARGUMENT\n\nI.

App.—San\n\nAntonio 2012, no pet.) (holding Court cannot review denial of a motion\n\nfor partial summary judgment after reversing the trial court’s grant of the\n\nother side’s summary judgment motion).\n\n     The issues on the award of appellate attorney’s fees are twofold. The\n\nfirst issue, whether fees may be awarded under the statute on which\n\nMurphy based its request, is a question of law to be reviewed de novo. See\n                                     9\n\fHolland v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 1 S.W.3d 91, 94 (Tex. 1999) (“The\n\navailability of attorney's fees under a particular statute is a question of law\n\nfor the court.”). The second issue is whether the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in awarding fees for an appeal when it had determined that it\n\nwas not appropriate to award fees incurred in the trial court because of the\n\nHerbsts’ right to litigate their claim without being burdened with\n\nMurphy’s attorney’s fees. Whether a trial court abused its discretion is also\n\na question of law but is reviewed differently from whether a court had the\n\nstatutory authority to award fees. The test for abuse of discretion is\n\n“whether the court acted without reference to any guiding rules and\n\nprinciples” or “whether the act was arbitrary or unreasonable.” Downer v.\n\nAquamarine Operators, Inc., 701 S.W.2d 238, 241-42 (Tex. 1985).\n\nII.   The trial court erred in granting summary judgment for Murphy.\n      (Issue One)\n\n      The trial court’s grant of summary judgment for Murphy is wrong.\n\nA well drilled pursuant to the Offset Clauses must be close to the well it is\n\ndesigned to offset.     A well drilled more than 2,100 feet from the\n\nneighboring well is not remotely close to and does not “offset” the\n\nneighboring well. The Offset Clauses require an offset well to be drilled\n\n\n                                      10\n\fwhen the neighboring well is within 467 feet of the lease line. The Lucas\n\nwell was within 350 feet of the lease line. The trial court’s holding here is\n\nthat, as a matter of law, a well drilled more than 2,100 feet from the\n\nneighboring well satisfies Murphy’s offset obligations. This interpretation\n\nof the Leases is unreasonable, contrary to the plain language of the Leases\n\nand inconsistent with the clear purpose of the Offset Clauses.\n\n     A.    The trial court violated basic rules of contract construction in holding\n           Murphy’s well qualified, as a matter of law, as an offset well.\n\n     The Herbst Leases are governed by the basic rules of contract\n\ninterpretation. Application of those rules precludes summary judgment for\n\nMurphy.\n\n     “An oil and gas lease is a contract, and its terms are interpreted as\n\nsuch.” Tittizer v.

The trial court failed to give meaning and effect to each\n                    provision of the Leases.\n\n      A primary consideration in interpreting oil and gas leases is the need\n\nto make sure every provision of the lease has meaning and effect. See BP\n\nAm. Prod. Co. v. Zaffirini, 419 S.W.3d 485, 497 (Tex. App.—San Antonio\n\n2013, pet. denied) (Courts “examine the plain language of the entire lease\n\nagreement, consider the interaction between each of its provisions, and\n\nseek ‘to harmonize and give effect to all the [lease] provisions.’”). As part\n\nof the effort to give effect to all provisions, courts “examine the entire\n\ndocument and consider each part with every other part so that the effect\n\nand meaning of one part on any other part may be determined.” Heritage\n\nResources, Inc. v. NationsBank, 939 S.W.2d 118, 121 (Tex. 1996).      Courts\n\n“presume that the parties to a contract intend every clause to have some\n\neffect.” Id.\n\n      An oil and gas lease typically has many provisions, and each of them\n\nserves a different purpose. See Sutton v. SM Energy Co., 421 S.W.3d 153, 158\n\n(Tex. App.—San Antonio 2013, no pet.) (observing different purposes of\n\ncontinuous drilling clause versus retained acreage clause). Here, Offset\n\nClauses, which impose a duty to drill an offset well to protect against\n\n\n                                      12\n\fdrainage, have completely different purposes from the lease provisions\n\nrequiring Murphy to develop the property by drilling a well. See Stanolind\n\nOil & Gas Co. v. Christian, 83 S.W.2d 408, 409 (Tex. Civ. App.—Texarkana\n\n1935, writ ref’d)2 (“[T]he implied covenant to drill offset wells for\n\nprotection of the property from drainage is a distinct obligation from the\n\nobligation imposed by the implied covenant to develop the property.”).\n\n        “Courts should examine and consider the entire writing in an\n\neffort to harmonize and give effect to all the provisions of the contract so\n\nthat none will be rendered meaningless.” State Farm Lloyds v. Gulley, 399\n\nS.W.3d 242, 247 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2012, writ denied) (emphasis\n\nadded).

App.—San Antonio 2001, pet.\n\ndenied).\n\n        The district court’s holding that drilling a well anywhere on the\n\nLeases satisfies Murphy’s obligations under the Offset Clauses undermines\n\nthe meaning and operative purpose of those provisions. Murphy already\n\n\n2\n A writ refused decision in 1935 has the same authority as a Supreme Court decision. See Yancy v. United Surgical\nPartners Int’l Inc., 236 S.W.3d 778, 786 at n. 6. (Tex. 2007) (stating writ refused decisions from this time period\n“have equal precedential value with the Texas Supreme Court's own opinions”).\n\n                                                        13\n\fneeded to drill a well in order to hold and develop the Leases under\n\nparagraph 2, which provides that the Leases will terminate after a period of\n\nthree years unless “operations, as hereinafter defined are conducted upon\n\nsaid land . . . .”   SCR 150, 161.     Paragraph 6 of the Leases defines\n\n“operations” as “drilling, testing, completing, reworking, recompleting,\n\ndeepening, plugging back or repairing of a well . . . .” SCR 152, 163.\n\n      Murphy’s position that drilling an oil well anywhere on the leased\n\npremises can constitute an offset well works only if the term “off-set” is\n\nremoved from the Offset Clauses. The clause, with the term “off-set”\n\nremoved, would then state:\n\n      (1) commence drilling operations on the leased acreage and\n      thereafter continue the drilling of such [] well or wells with due\n      diligence to a depth adequate to test the same formation from\n      which the well or wells are producing from on the adjacent\n      acreage.\n\nWith the term “off-set” removed, Murphy’s claim that drilling a well\n\nanywhere on the tract would satisfy Murphy’s obligations under this\n\nprovision would be correct.       But courts do not write words out of\n\ncontracts. On the contrary, the rules of contract construction require\n\nthem to strive to give all words meaning and effect.             See Heritage\n\nResources, 939 S.W.2d at 121.\n                                      14\n\f     The “effect of a lease is governed by a fair reading of its text.”\n\nChesapeake Exploration, L.L.C., v. Hyder, No. 14-0302, ___ S.W.3d ___, 2015\n\nWL 3653446 at *5 (Tex. June 12, 2015). Allowing the drilling of a well\n\nanywhere on the property to satisfy Murphy’s offset obligations is not\n\nconsistent with a “fair reading” of the Leases. Such a result defeats the\n\npurpose of the Offset Clauses’ requirement that Murphy drill a well to\n\nprotect the lease from drainage by the neighboring well, which drainage is\n\npresumed whenever a neighboring well is within 467 feet of the lease line.\n\nThe trial court’s decision thus undermines the separate meaning and\n\npurpose inherent in the requirement to drill an offset well.\n\n     In support of its claim that it has the discretion to locate the well\n\nanywhere on the Leases, Murphy cited in the trial court Davis v. CIG\n\nExploration, Inc., 789 F.2d 328, 332 (5th Cir. 1986). SCR 121. Davis did\n\nnot involve an offset clause and is inapposite. The passage Murphy\n\nquoted – that the “lessee decides when to drill, where to drill, and how\n\nmany wells to drill” – must be read in context. That statement follows\n\nthe observation that “Texas law has long recognized that an oil and gas\n\nlessor is often at the mercy of his lessee.” Id. The Offset Clauses here\n\n\n\n                                     15\n\fare contractual provisions specifically designed to protect the Herbsts\n\nfrom being at the “mercy” of Murphy.\n\n            2.     The trial court failed to give the words of the Offset Clauses\n                   their plain meaning.\n\n      The district court’s decision is contrary to the plain, common sense\n\nmeaning of the term “offset.” When examining the language in a lease,\n\ncourts “give terms their plain, ordinary, and generally accepted meaning\n\nunless the instrument shows that the parties used them in a technical or\n\ndifferent sense.” Heritage Resources, 939 S.W.2d at 121. The term “offset” is\n\nan “ordinary” term with a “plain” meaning.\n\n      The   noun     “offset”   is   commonly      understood     to    mean   a\n\n“counterbalance to or compensation for something else.”                THE NEW\n\nSHORTER OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY 1985 (1993 ed.). See also\n\nTHE    AMERICAN        HERITAGE       DICTIONARY         OF   THE      ENGLISH\n\nLANGUAGE 1224 (5th ed. 2011) (“agent, element, or thing that balances,\n\ncounteracts or compensates for something else”). The verb “offset” means\n\nto “[s]et off as an equivalent against; cancel out by something on the other\n\nside ….” THE NEW SHORTER OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY 1985\n\n(1993 ed.) (emphasis added).         See also THE AMERICAN HERITAGE\n\n\n                                       16\n\fDICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 1224 (5th ed. 2011) (to\n\noffset is “to counterbalance, counteract, or compensate for”).\n\n     Courts regularly “rely on definitions listed in commonly used\n\ndictionaries to discern the plain meaning of terms . . . ” when, as here,\n\nthose terms are not otherwise defined.         CenterPoint Energy Entex v.\n\nRailroad Comm’n, 208 S.W.3d 608, 619 (Tex. App.—Austin 2006, pet.\n\ndenied) (interpreting a statute). Ordinary dictionary definitions are not\n\nextrinsic evidence but, instead, confirmation of the generally accepted\n\nplain meaning of words. These dictionary definitions indicate that an\n\noffset well must be close to the well drilled on the neighboring tract so\n\nthat it can actually “offset” or “counterbalance” the neighboring well.\n\nA well located 2,100 feet away from the well it is supposed to “offset”\n\ndoes not comport with this plain meaning.\n\n     The common-sense reading of the Offset Clauses is that the offset\n\nwell will be close to the well drilled on the neighboring tract so that it can\n\ntruly “offset” or “counterbalance” the neighboring well.             Railroad\n\nCommission Field Rules for the Eagle Ford-1 Field where these wells are\n\nlocated prohibit drilling a well “nearer than THREE HUNDRED THIRTY\n\n(330) feet to any property line, lease line, or subdivision line” without\n                                     17\n\fobtaining a spacing exception. See SCR 98 (RRC Final Order, Rule 2).\n\nTherefore, Murphy could, and should, have drilled its offset well close to\n\nthat 330 foot distance. Instead, Murphy drilled a well that was situated\n\n1,800 feet from the boundary of the lease and over 2,100 feet from the\n\nneighboring well – a distance over 6 times longer than the distance allowed\n\nunder the applicable RRC Field Rules.\n\n     In fact, Murphy drilled the well within 450 feet of the opposite side of\n\nthe Shirley and William tracts – almost as far away from the Lucas well as\n\nit possibly could have drilled. A well situated along the opposite boundary\n\n– the far northeastern edge of the leased premises – does not constitute an\n\noffset well. Were that a proper reading of these Offset Clauses, a well on\n\nthe opposite end of a 30,000 acre lease – some 5 or 6 miles away – could be\n\nconsidered an offset well. These provisions are common in oil and gas\n\nleases; the trial court’s ruling, if affirmed, will likely affect tracts much\n\nlarger than the Herbsts. Mr. Steinle, a local attorney and scrivener of these\n\nleases, informed the trial court that he has “prepared hundreds of leases”\n\nwith these provisions. SCR 448. Under the “plain, ordinary, and generally\n\naccepted meaning” of the term offset well, Murphy has not complied with\n\n\n\n                                     18\n\fits offset obligations under either of the two Leases. Heritage Resources, 939\n\nS.W.2d at 121.\n\n      Murphy claims it placed the well where it did because it believed a\n\nwell located on the northeast side of the properties would be more\n\nproductive than a well drilled on the southwest side closest to the Lucas\n\nwell. SCR 132-33, ¶ 12 (claiming the Herbst B well was in “the best location\n\nto optimize production from the Lease”). The Herbsts are not challenging\n\nMurphy’s right to choose to drill a well where the Herbst B well is located.\n\nBut that well does not satisfy the Offset Clauses. Murphy needed either to\n\ndrill another well close to the Lucas well or utilize one of its two other\n\noptions – pay substitute royalties or release acreage so that the Herbsts\n\ncould lease that land to someone else. Murphy did neither but, instead,\n\nclaimed a well it already planned to drill – the Herbst B – constituted an\n\noffset well. Under the plain, common-sense meaning of the Offset Clauses,\n\nit does not.\n\n      Murphy also claims that it satisfied its drilling obligation because the\n\nwell was “drilled ‘to a depth adequate to test the same formation from\n\nwhich the well or wells are producing from on the adjacent acreage.’” SCR\n\n123 (quoting paragraph 25 of the Leases).         The Herbsts have never\n                                     19\n\fchallenged the adequacy of the depth of the Herbst B well. But drilling a\n\nwell deep enough does not equate to drilling a well close enough. Murphy\n\nhas provided no evidence that its drilling of the Herbst B well in any way\n\nprotected against drainage from the Lucas well.        On the contrary, it\n\nasserted in the trial court that no drainage has occurred, suggesting that as\n\nan additional reason why it could put the well anywhere it chose. SCR 296\n\n(“the Eagle Ford does not contain freely migrating hydrocarbons in a\n\ncommon reservoir that can be drained from the adjacent lease”). Whether\n\ndrainage is, in fact, occurring from the Lucas well is beside the point. The\n\nvery purpose of the Offset Clauses is to eliminate the need for proof of\n\ndrainage by presuming drainage is occurring whenever a neighboring well\n\nis located within 467 feet of the lease line. If Murphy believed no drainage\n\nwas possible in the Eagle Ford, Murphy should not have accepted leases\n\nwith these offset provisions.\n\n     Murphy also argued in the trial court that it could locate the well\n\nanywhere on the Leases because the Leases do not specify the distance\n\nfrom the boundary for the offset well. SCR 125. This argument ignores the\n\nfact that the Leases do define the distance for the neighboring well and\n\npresume drainage whenever that neighboring well is within 467 feet of the\n                                     20\n\flease line. The logical inference from the presumption created by these\n\nprovisions is that the offset well must be at least within 467 feet on the\n\nother side the boundary. No logic supports holding, as a matter of law,\n\nthat a well 1,800 feet from the boundary satisfies the offset well obligation.\n\n            3.    The trial court’s decision ignores the reasons offset clauses\n                  like this one are included in leases.\n\n      The trial court’s decision here undermines the very purpose for\n\nwhich offset clauses like the ones here are included in oil and gas leases.\n\nConsideration of the context in which offset clauses like these came to be\n\nincluded in leases is relevant to interpreting them. See Houston Exploration\n\nCo. v. Wellington Underwriting Agencies, Ltd., 352 S.W.3d 462, 469 (Tex. 2011)\n\n(parol evidence rule “does not prohibit consideration of surrounding\n\ncircumstances that inform, rather than vary from or contradict, the contract\n\ntext”). Courts consider the “setting in which the contract was negotiated\n\nand other objectively determinable factors that give a context to the\n\ntransaction between the parties.” Id.\n\n      Texas law has long recognized that an implied covenant exists in an\n\noil and gas lease to protect the lessor from drainage of the oil and gas\n\nunder his tract by a well drilled on neighboring property. See Amoco Prod.\n\n\n                                        21\n\fCo. v. Alexander, 622 S.W.2d 563, 568 (Tex. 1981). Under such an implied\n\ncovenant, lessees have the duty of a “reasonably prudent operator to\n\nprotect from field-wide drainage.” Id. A lessee’s duty to protect against\n\ndrainage even extends to seeking permission from the Texas Railroad\n\nCommission (RRC), which regulates the oil and gas industry, so as to locate\n\na well closer to the lease boundary than RRC rules would ordinarily\n\npermit.     Id. (stating duties under the implied covenant could include\n\n“seeking Rule 37 exceptions from the Railroad Commission”).\n\n        Over the course of oil and gas development in Texas, many leases\n\nincorporated the implied covenant with express language requiring\n\nprotection against drainage. These leases typically required a lessee to drill\n\nonly if a “reasonably prudent operator” would choose to drill the offset\n\nwell.     Thus, under both these express lease provisions as well as the\n\nimplied covenant, the lessor was required to establish that the lessee failed\n\nto act as a reasonably prudent operator. To do so, the lessor had to show\n\nnot only that actual drainage was occurring but also that the lessee could\n\nmake a profit from the offset well. See States v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 161\n\nS.W.2d 366, 367-68 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1942, writ ref’d w.o.m.)\n\n(affirming judgment for lessee because lessor failed to show lessee could\n                                      22\n\fmake a profit from the offset well); Menking v. Tar Heel Energy Corp., 621\n\nS.W.2d 447, 449 (Tex. Civ. App.—Corpus Christi 1981, no writ) (same\n\nholding); Chapman v. Sohio Petroleum Co., 297 S.W.2d 885, 886-87 (Tex. Civ.\n\nApp.—El Paso 1956, writ ref’d n.r.e.)(same holding).\n\n     As these cases illustrate, lessors often failed to prevail in suits based\n\non either the implied or the express covenant because of the difficulty of\n\nproving either that drainage had, in fact, occurred or that the offset well\n\nwould be profitable to the lessee.\n\n     The Offset Clauses in the Herbst Leases eliminate the proof problems\n\nthat arose in these earlier cases by eliminating the need to prove either that\n\ndrainage was actually occurring or that drilling a well would be profitable.\n\nInstead, under these provisions, the lessee’s duties are explicit. Murphy’s\n\nargument that proximity to the neighboring well is irrelevant because there\n\nis no risk of drainage ignores this context and undermines the very reasons\n\nthese explicit provisions were included in the Leases.\n\n           4.    The trial court’s decision       is   inconsistent   with   the\n                 understanding in the industry.\n\n     Courts properly use the generally accepted meaning that a term has\n\nbeen given in the oil and gas industry, if it is consistent with the plain\n\n\n                                     23\n\flanguage of the lease. See BP Am. Prod. Co. v. Zaffirini, 419 S.W.3d at 497.\n\n(“If a lease term has a generally accepted meaning in the oil and gas\n\nindustry, [courts] use its generally accepted meaning.”).        Provisions\n\naddressing “offset well obligations” are “common terms” in oil and gas\n\nleases. Oakrock Exploration Co. v. Killam, 87 S.W.3d 685, 691 (Tex. App.—\n\nSan Antonio 2002, pet. denied).

(recent case with offset well\n\nprovisions at issue).\n\n      Contrary to Murphy’s position and the district court’s holding,\n\nindustry definitions are consistent with the dictionary definitions for\n\nwhat constitutes an “offset.” In Williams & Meyer’s Manual of Oil and\n\nGas Terms, p. 718 (1994 Ed.), an offset well is defined as a “well drilled\n\non one tract of land to prevent the drainage of oil or gas to an adjoining\n\ntract of land, on which a well is being drilled or is already in\n\nproduction.” The common industry understanding of an offset well\n\nrequirement in a lease is that the well will be as close as regulations\n\npermit it to be to the well it is “offsetting.”       See Babylon Online\n\nDictionary,         Glossary         of        Petroleum          Industry,\n                                     24\n\fhttp://dictionary.babylon.com/offset_well (last visited July 6, 2015)\n\n(defining an offset well as “(1) A well drilled on the next location to the\n\noriginal well. The distance from the first well to the offset well depends\n\nupon spacing regulations and whether the original well produces oil or\n\ngas. (2) A well drilled on one tract of land to prevent the Drainage of oil\n\nor gas to an adjoining tract where a well is being drilled or is already\n\nproducing”). See also R. D. Langenkamp, HANDBOOK         OF   OIL INDUSTRY\n\nTERMS & PHRASES, p. 344 (6th ed. 2014) (same definition).\n\n     Murphy’s expert, John McBeath, claimed he had never seen these\n\ndefinitions before and relied, instead, on his “personal copy of ‘A\n\nDictionary of Petroleum Terms’ 2nd ed.” SCR 178, ¶ 21. He stated this\n\ndictionary defined an offset well as “a well drilled on a tract of land\n\nnext to another owner’s tract on which there is a producing well.” SCR\n\n178, ¶ 21 (emphasis added).         This definition similarly connotes\n\nproximity – describing the offset well as one “next to” another owner’s\n\ntract. A well 1,800 feet from the lease boundary is not “next to” the\n\nother owner’s tract.\n\n\n\n\n                                    25\n\f     B.    Murphy’s expert affidavit does not support the trial court’s\n           summary judgment.\n\n     In its motion for summary judgment, Murphy contended extrinsic\n\nevidence provided by an expert was necessary to address what Murphy\n\nclaimed were industry standards. SCR 123-27. Extrinsic, expert testimony\n\nis not necessary to determine that Murphy failed to comply with its\n\nobligations under the Offset Clauses.       Industry understanding can be\n\ndetermined without resort to Murphy’s expert affidavit.       If, however,\n\nexpert testimony is appropriate, Murphy’s expert’s testimony is in no way\n\nconclusive but is, instead, both illogical and contradicted by the very RRC\n\ndocuments on which he relies.       It is also directly controverted by the\n\nHerbsts’ expert, Gregg Robertson, who has over 35 years of experience in\n\nthe oil and gas industry. SCR 238-42.\n\n           1.    Expert testimony is not appropriate here.\n\n     In the trial court, Murphy relied on Mescalero Energy Inc. v.\n\nUnderwriters Indemn. Gen. Agency, Inc., 56 S.W.3d 313, 320 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2001, pet. denied), as support for its reliance on\n\nexpert testimony.    SCR 123-25.      Mescalero, however, allowed expert\n\ntestimony only because the contract term was ambiguous. At issue was\n\n\n                                      26\n\fan insurance policy that provided coverage for underground blowouts\n\nby oil and gas wells and defined a blowout as a sudden flow of oil, gas\n\nor water “between two or more separate formations.” Id. at 316. The\n\ncourt held that the policy was ambiguous. Id. at 325.\n\n     Mescalero recognizes that when the meaning of a word is plain,\n\nexpert testimony is not proper. “A term not specifically defined by [the\n\ncontract] must be given its plain, ordinary and generally accepted\n\nmeaning, unless consideration of the [contract] shows it to have been\n\nused in a different sense.” Id. at 320. The word “offset” has a plain\n\ndictionary meaning; it is not ambiguous.\n\n     The other cases Murphy cited in the trial court (SCR at 124) also\n\ndo not support use of expert testimony. Contreras v. Clint Ind. Sch. Dist.,\n\n347 S.W.3d 413, 420 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2011, no pet.), involved an\n\nexpert affidavit to explain the medical term “complication” in a\n\nsettlement agreement – a word not readily understood in the medical\n\ncontext. Zurich Am. Ins. Co. v. Hunt Petroleum (AEC), Inc., 157 S.W.3d\n\n462, 467 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2004, pet. denied), involved\n\nan ambiguous contract and, therefore, a fact issue. GTE Southwest, Inc.\n\nv. Public Util. Comm’n, 102 S.W.3d 282 (Tex. App.—Austin 2003, pet.\n                                    27\n\fdenied), did not involve expert testimony but merely consideration of\n\nthe “‘commercial context of the transaction.’”           Id. at 295.     The\n\n“commercial context” of offset wells is clear from the language of the\n\nLeases:   they must be drilled – or the lessee must pay substitute\n\nroyalties or release acreage – whenever a neighboring well is within 467\n\nfeet of the Herbsts’ lands.\n\n           2.    If expert testimony is appropriate, Murphy’s expert affidavit\n                 is not conclusive for several reasons, particularly his\n                 misreading of RRC form, rules and orders.\n\n     Even if expert testimony were appropriate, Murphy’s expert\n\naffidavit from Mr. McBeath cannot establish Murphy’s interpretation of\n\nthe Offset Clauses as a matter of law for several reasons. First, opinion\n\ntestimony generally raises only a question of fact. Uniroyal Goodrich\n\nTire co. v. Martinez, 977 S.W.2d 328, 338 (Tex. 1998) (“The general rule is\n\nthat opinion testimony, even when uncontroverted, does not bind the\n\njury unless the subject matter is one for experts alone.”).\n\n     Second, Mr. McBeath’s testimony contradicts the plain language\n\nin the Leases. Mr. McBeath’s opinion is that any well anywhere on the\n\nLeases constitutes an offset well. SCR 176 ¶ 13. Expert testimony that\n\n“does not comport with the plain language of the leases” is “no\n\n                                     28\n\fevidence.” Occidental Permian Ltd. v. Helen Jones Foundation, 333 S.W.3d\n\n392, 399 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2011, pet. denied). See also Nat’l Union\n\nFire Ins. Co. v. CBI Industries, 907 S.W.2d at 517, 521 (Tex. 1995)\n\n(extrinsic evidence inadmissible to “contradict or vary the meaning of\n\nthe explicit language”).\n\n     To support his claims regarding what constitutes an offset well,\n\nMr. McBeath introduces terms not found in the Leases. He asserts that\n\na “direct offset well” is a “specialized term within the oil and gas\n\nindustry, and is commonly understood to be a well that is located\n\ndirectly across a lease line or other legal boundary.” SCR 176 at ¶ 13.\n\nHe also refers to “immediate offset wells” – another term not found in\n\nthe Leases – and claims this means the same thing as a “direct offset\n\nwell.” Id. In other words, he suggests that, unless the term “offset\n\nwell” has the adjective “direct” or “immediate” preceding it, the offset\n\nwell need not be in close proximity to the well it is offsetting.\n\n     Third, Mr. McBeath has nothing more than his own bare opinion\n\nto support his claims that these terms are commonly used in the\n\nindustry.   “[I]t is the basis of the witness’s opinion, and not the\n\nwitness’s qualifications or his bare opinions alone, that can settle an\n                                     29\n\fissue as a matter of law; a claim will not stand or fall on the mere ipse\n\ndixit of a credentialed witness.” Burrow v. Arce, 997 S.W.2d 229, 235\n\n(Tex. 1999).\n\n     Mr. McBeath cites and relies on, but does not attach to his\n\naffidavit, numerous RRC Rules, Orders and a form and suggests these\n\nRRC documents support his differentiation between “regular” offset\n\nwells and “direct” or “immediate” offset wells. SCR 176-77. The RRC\n\nrules, orders, and form do not support the special meanings Mr.\n\nMcBeath has attempted to give to the term offset well. The RRC has\n\n“no authority to determine title and ownership of property, to construe\n\na lease . . . .” Arkla Exploration Co. v. Haywood, Rice & William Venture,\n\n863 S.W.2d 112, 117 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 1993, writ dism’d by agr.)\n\n(citing Amarillo Oil Co. v. Energy-Agri Products, Inc., 794 S.W.2d 20, 26\n\n(Tex. 1990)).\n\n     More important, these RRC documents, placed in the record by\n\nthe Herbsts, do not support Mr. McBeath’s strained interpretation of\n\nwhat constitutes an offset well. SCR 244-89. Mr. McBeath states that\n\nthe RRC’s H-1 form “shows that the term ‘offset well’ is understood\n\nwithin the industry to describe any well drilled on adjacent property”\n                                    30\n\fand asserts the form “requires offset wells within 1/2 mile of the\n\nsubject well to be identified on a map.” SCR 176, ¶ 15. Mr. McBeath\n\nmisrepresents the form. Quoted below is the only portion of Form H-1\n\nthat mentions offset wells:\n\n           7. Plat of Leases, Notice and Hearings\n\n           (a) Plat of Leases. Attach a plat of leases showing\n     producing wells, injection wells, offset wells and identifying\n     ownership of all surrounding leases within one-half (1/2)\n     mile.\n\nSCR 245.\n\n     This provision does not indicate that an offset well is any well\n\nlocated within one-half mile of the lease. The one-half mile refers to the\n\nleases in the vicinity, not to the locations of the wells within those\n\nleases. Moreover, the form distinguishes between “producing wells”\n\nand “offset wells,” indicating that an offset well is not the same thing as\n\na producing well. In other words, this form undermines Mr. McBeath’s\n\nclaim that any producing well is an offset well.\n\n     Similarly, a review of the examiner’s proposal for decision and the\n\nRRC’s final order in RRC Oil and Gas Docket No. XX-XXXXXXX – another\n\nRRC document relied on by Mr. McBeath – shows that the terms “direct\n\n\n                                    31\n\foffset well” and “immediate offset well” are not used at all in the\n\ndiscussion. SCR 247-55. The sole reference to the term offset well is in\n\nthe examiner’s recommendation that the requested disposal well be\n\nallowed only if the applicant can demonstrate “through plume analysis\n\nand offset well construction/plugging evaluation that the injected\n\nfluids will be confined to the proposed disposal zone.” See SCR 247 ¶ 2.\n\nThis statement does not support Mr. McBeath’s opinion.\n\n        RRC Rule 37 decisions, also relied on by Mr. McBeath, do not\n\nsupport his claim that “direct” or “immediate” offset wells are\n\nsomehow closer to the boundary line or otherwise different from “offset\n\nwells.” RRC Rule 37 is a spacing rule that, absent special field rules,\n\nrequires operators to drill wells no closer than 467 feet from the\n\nboundary of the lease. See 16 Tex. Admin. Code § 3.37(a)(1). Operators\n\nmay seek what is called a Rule 37 exception, which allows operators to\n\ndrill wells closer to a boundary line than the applicable field rules\n\npermit, if the operators can show drainage resulting from a neighboring\n\nwell.\n\n        Rule 37 decisions do not assign specialized definitions to describe\n\nthe offset wells that are allowed to prevent drainage. For example, in\n                                     32\n\fRRC Docket No. 0213270, the operator sought a Rule 37 exception to\n\nlocate an offset well 349 feet from the nearest lease line in a field where\n\nthe normal distance was 467 feet. SCR 259. The examiner granted the\n\nexception. He used the term offset to describe both the neighboring\n\nwell that was draining the tract and also a well that could offset the\n\ndraining well. See SCR 259. Examiners sometimes use adjectives such\n\nas “nearby” or “direct” (SCR 268), but there is no special significance\n\nascribed to those words.\n\n     What is clear from all of the Rule 37 decisions Mr. McBeath cites,\n\nwhich require proof of actual drainage to drill closer to the boundary\n\nline than the RRC field rules otherwise permit, is that an offset well is\n\nalways in close proximity to the boundary line.         Operators sought\n\npermission in these cases to locate the offset wells 254 feet (SCR 265),\n\n100 feet (SCR 273), 349 feet (SCR 259), and 75 feet (SCR 281) from the\n\nboundary/lease line.       These RRC orders hurt Murphy’s position,\n\nillustrating the unreasonableness of Mr. McBeath’s attempt to\n\ncharacterize a well 1,800 feet from the boundary line as an offset well.\n\n     The RRC rules Mr. McBeath cites also provide no support for his\n\nipse dixit that the industry considers any well an offset well regardless\n                                    33\n\fof its distance from the neighboring well. Neither 16 Tex. Admin. Code\n\n§ 3.46 (Rule 46) nor § 3.37 (Rule 37) has the term “offset well” in it. 16\n\nTex. Admin. Code § 3.36 (Rule 36) uses the term once with respect to\n\ndetermining the escape rate for hydrogen sulfide in subsection\n\n3.36(c)(3)(C). The phrase does not indicate where the offset well may be\n\nlocated.\n\n                 3.       If expert testimony is appropriate, the affidavit of the\n                          Herbsts’ expert Gregg Robertson either is conclusive as the\n                          only testimony that makes sense or at least raises a fact\n                          issue.\n\n        Although expert testimony is neither necessary nor appropriate\n\nhere, the Herbsts provided in response to Mr. McBeath a competing\n\nexpert affidavit from Gregg Robertson, who has worked in the oil and\n\ngas business for 35 years and joined with Petrohawk Energy to drill the\n\ninitial discovery wells for the Eagle Ford Shale field.3 SCR 238, ¶ 2. If\n\nexpert testimony is appropriate, the experts disagree. The Court should\n\neither accept Mr. Robertson’s affidavit as conclusive because Mr.\n\nMcBeath’s affidavit is unsupported by anything other than his personal\n\n\n3\n  Murphy filed but did not set for hearing a motion to strike Mr. Robertson’s affidavit as conclusory because Mr.\nRobertson did not cite treatises, dictionaries or regulations in support of his opinion. The motion was waived and\nthe claims are false and meritless. Mr. Robertson references that he reviewed the Herbsts’ motion, which included\ndictionary and industry definitions, RRC filings, and the McBeath affidavit in preparation of his affidavit, which\nrefuted in considerable non-conclusory detail Mr. McBeath’s opinions. SCR 238-42.\n\n                                                       34\n\fopinion or should hold there is a fact issue on the meaning of the term\n\n“offset well.”\n\n     Mr. Robertson states that he been involved in “the construction of\n\nseveral hundred oil and gas leases, and specifically over one hundred\n\noil and gas leases in the past five years for the development of Eagle\n\nFord Shale reserves.” SCR 240, ¶ 8. He further states that has “never\n\nseen in any written contract nor heard in any conversation” the\n\ndistinction Mr. McBeath purports to make between “an offset well” and\n\n“a direct offset well.”   SCR 241, ¶ 9.     Mr. Robertson refutes Mr.\n\nMcBeath’s claim that the terms “direct offset well” and “immediate\n\noffset well” are terms commonly used in the oil and gas industry. SCR\n\n239-42, ¶¶ 5-9.\n\n     The Court should reject Mr. McBeath’s claim (SCR 177,¶ 19) that\n\nthe purpose of the offset clause is not to protect acreage from drainage.\n\nThis claim defies common sense, as well as dictionary and industry\n\ndefinitions and court decisions.   It is also expressly refuted by Mr.\n\nRobertson. SCR 240, ¶ 8. Mr. McBeath opines that no drainage would\n\nactually occur here because experience has shown that only “a\n\nrelatively modest amount of reservoir is drained by each horizontal\n                                   35\n\fwell.” SCR 177, ¶ 19. Mr. McBeath’s claim that no drainage has, in fact,\n\noccurred is precisely the kind of factual dispute the Offset Clause\n\nrenders irrelevant. Mr. McBeath’s claim that the purpose of an offset\n\nwell is not to protect against drainage is nonsensical.              The “sole\n\npurpose” of an offset well is “to prevent, compensate and mitigate the\n\ndrainage of the leased premises by the offending well. Common sense\n\nprecludes any other construction.” SCR 175, ¶ 8 (Robertson Aff.).\n\nIII.   The trial court erred in awarding Murphy attorney’s fees. (Issue\n       Two)\n\n       A.   The trial court had no statutory authority to award attorney’s\n            fees.\n\n       There is no legal basis for awarding Murphy any attorney’s fees in\n\nthis case. The Herbsts sued Murphy for breach of contract. SCR 5-11.\n\nMurphy counterclaimed for attorneys’ fees under Chapters 37 and 38 of the\n\nTexas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. SCR 116. Neither provides a\n\nbasis for a recovery of fees by Murphy.\n\n       Murphy cannot recover fees under Chapter 38, which defines when\n\nfees are recoverable in a breach of contract case. Chapter 38 limits recovery\n\nof fees to when the prevailing party has recovered damages in the breach of\n\ncontract action. See, e.g., Green Int’l, Inc. v. Solis, 951 S.W.2d 384, 390 (Tex.\n\n                                       36\n\f1997) (“To recover attorney’s fees under Section 38.001, a party must (1)\n\nprevail on a cause of action for which attorney’s fees are recoverable, and\n\n(2) recover damages.”) (emphasis added). Murphy has no claim for damages\n\nand, therefore cannot recover fees under Chapter 38. Murphy conceded as\n\nmuch in its Motion for Final Judgment, wherein it does not seek recovery\n\nof fees under Chapter 38 but, instead, seeks fees under Chapter 37.\n\n     Murphy may not recover fees under Chapter 37 either. Chapter 37\n\ncontains the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (UDJA) and, when the\n\nUDJA is properly invoked, § 37.009 gives the trial court the discretion to\n\naward such fees “as are equitable and just.” The UDJA, however, may not\n\nbe used “as a vehicle to obtain otherwise impermissible attorney’s fees.”\n\nMBM Fin. Corp. v. Woodlands Operating Co., L.P., 292 S.W.3d 660, 669 (Tex.\n\n2009).   When, as here, the core issue lies in contract, a defendant like\n\nMurphy cannot simply “replead[] a claim as a declaratory judgment.” Id.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s reasoning in MBM Financial is controlling here:\n\n     [W]hile declaratory relief may be obtained under the Act in all\n     these circumstances, that does not mean attorney’s fees can too.\n     Texas has long followed the “American Rule” prohibiting fee\n     awards unless specifically provided by contract or statute. By\n     contrast, the Declaratory Judgments Act allows fee awards to\n     either party in all cases. If repleading a claim as a declaratory\n     judgment could justify a fee award, attorney’s fees would be\n                                     37\n\f      available for all parties in all cases. That would repeal not only\n      the American Rule but also the limits imposed on fee awards in\n      other statutes. Accordingly, the rule is that a party cannot use\n      the Act as a vehicle to obtain otherwise impermissible\n      attorney’s fees.\n\n      The Act was originally “intended as a speedy and effective\n      remedy” for settling disputes before substantial damages were\n      incurred. It is “intended to provide a remedy that is simpler\n      and less harsh than coercive relief, if it appears that a\n      declaration might terminate the potential controversy.” But\n      when a claim for declaratory relief is merely tacked onto a\n      standard suit based on a matured breach of contract, allowing\n      fees under Chapter 37 would frustrate the limits Chapter 38\n      imposes on such fee recoveries. And granting fees under\n      Chapter 37 when they are not permitted under the specific\n      common-law or statutory claims involved would violate the\n      rule that specific provisions should prevail over general ones.\n      While the Legislature intended the Act to be remedial, it did\n      not intend to supplant all other statutes and remedies.\n\nMBM Financial, 292 S.W.3d at 669-70 (footnotes omitted).\n\n      Thus, a request for declaratory judgment that is merely “tacked onto”\n\na breach of contract claim cannot be a basis for a fee award. Id. at 670; see\n\nalso Etan Indus. v. Lehmann, 359 S.W.3d 620, 624 (Tex. 2011) (“When a claim\n\nfor declaratory relief is merely ‘tacked onto’ statutory or common-law\n\nclaims that do not permit fees, allowing the UDJA to serve as a basis for\n\nfees ‘would violate the rule that specific provisions should prevail over\n\ngeneral ones.’”).\n\n\n                                     38\n\f     Here, Murphy’s UDJA counterclaim sought to determine whether\n\nMurphy had breached the Leases. SCR 115-16. That counterclaim is “part\n\nand parcel” of the contract claim. MBM Fin. Corp., 292 S.W.3d at 671.\n\nThus, Murphy cannot recover fees. See Mungia v. Via Metro. Transit, 441\n\nS.W.3d 542, 550 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2014, pet. denied) (“[A]ttorney's\n\nfees under the UDJA [are not authorized] simply because declaratory relief\n\nis sought as a means to obtain relief quicker and more effectively than that\n\nauthorized by another asserted cause of action.”).\n\n     In its Motion for Final Judgment, Murphy cited Save Our Springs\n\nAlliance, Inc. v. Lazy Nine Mun. Util. Dist., 198 S.W.3d 300 (Tex. App.—\n\nTexarkana 2006, pet. denied), as authority for awarding fees under the\n\nUDJA. Save Our Springs is inapposite -- it was not a breach of contract case.\n\nSee id. at 308-310.      Instead, Plaintiff in that case challenged the\n\nconstitutionality of a statute. Id. at 308. Plaintiff’s sole claim was as a\n\ndeclaratory judgment. Id. at 318. Here, the Herbsts’ claim is for breach of\n\ncontract and recovery of damages.\n\n     That the Herbsts also sought a declaratory judgment does not give\n\nMurphy the right to recover fees. The Herbsts’ UDJA claim was, on its\n\nface, redundant of its breach of contract action. See SCR 9-10.\n                                     39\n\f         Courts have distinguished Save Our Springs from cases involving\n\ncommon law claims similar to the present one, in which Murphy’s\n\nrequested declaratory judgment relief is supplementary and incidental to\n\nPlaintiffs’ contract claim. These courts have held that, when a party files a\n\ncommon-law claim and “only s[eeks] declarations accepting the premises\n\non which its [common law] claim i[s] based,” fees are unwarranted. See\n\nWashington Square Fin., LLC v. RSL Funding, LLC, 418 S.W.3d 761, 776 (Tex.\n\nApp.— Houston [14th Dist.] 2013, pet. denied); see also, Mungia, 441 S.W.3d.\n\nat 550 (distinguishing case law in which there is “only one claim . . . for\n\ndeclaratory relief under the UDJA” from cases involving more than one\n\nclaim and finding trial court had no discretion to award UDJA attorneys’\n\nfees).\n\n         B.   If the trial court had authority to award fees under the UDJA,\n              it abused its discretion in awarding fees on appeal after\n              determining fees in the trial court were not appropriate.\n\n         If, however, the Court holds that a fee award under the UDJA is\n\navailable, the Court should nevertheless reverse the district court’s award\n\nof attorney’s fees here as an abuse of its discretion. An award of fees under\n\nthe UDJA is discretionary. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 37.009\n\n(Vernon 2013) (stating the court “may” award fees and costs). A court\n\n                                      40\n\f“may conclude that it is not equitable or just to award even reasonable and\n\nnecessary fees.” Bocquet v. Herring, 972 S.W.2d 19, 21 (Tex. 1998).\n\n      The test for abuse of discretion is “whether the court acted without\n\nreference to any guiding rules and principles” or was “arbitrary or\n\nunreasonable.” Downer v. Aquamarine Operators, Inc., 701 S.W.2d at 241-42.\n\nSee also Woodglen Homeowners Ass’n v. Odom, 452 S.W.3d 489, 490 (Tex.\n\nApp.—San Antonio 2014, no pet.) (“A trial court abuses its discretion if its\n\ndecision is arbitrary, unreasonable, and without any reference to any\n\nguiding rules or principles.”).\n\n      The district court here exercised its discretion to deny Murphy an\n\naward of fees incurred in the trial court, stating:\n\n      And frankly my thinking on not awarding attorney’s fees as a\n      result of the trial proceeding was that the Plaintiffs were\n      certainly entitled to their thoughts as to the offset well needing\n      to be drilled closer and had the right to present their arguments\n      to the Court for the Court to make a determination on that, and\n      should not be penalized by having to pay huge amounts of\n      attorney’s fees. And so attorney’s fees were not awarded.\n\nRR 46, l. 22 – 47, l. 6.\n\n      The trial court then proceeded to award conditional fees to Murphy\n\nin the event the Herbsts sought review in this Court and, if necessary, in\n\nthe Supreme Court. SCR 494. Having effectively found that it was not\n                                       41\n\f“equitable or just” to award trial court fees, the court had no basis for then\n\nholding that the Herbsts should be “penalized” with fees if they sought\n\nreview in this Court.\n\n      The trial court held the Herbsts had a legitimate issue to litigate and\n\nshould not be burdened with their opponents’ trial court fees for that\n\nlitigation. That reasoning applies equally to the Herbsts’ appeal. The\n\ncourt’s ruling that it is not “equitable and just” to award trial fees but it is\n\n“equitable and just” to impose those fees in the event of an appeal is\n\narbitrary and capricious and without guiding principles. Such an award\n\n“could serve only to place a financial disincentive” for the Herbsts to\n\nexercise their right to appeal to this Court and, as such, constitutes an\n\nabuse of discretion. Reagan v. Marathon Oil Co., 50 S.W.3d 70, 83-84 (Tex.\n\nApp-Waco 2001, no pet.) (holding trial court abused its discretion when it\n\ndeclined to award trial fees but did award appellate fees). See also United\n\nInterests, Inc. v. Brewington, Inc., 729 S.W.2d 897, 906 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 1987, writ ref’d n.r.e.) (same). The Court should reverse the\n\ntrial court’s award of fees in the event of an unsuccessful appeal as an\n\nabuse of discretion.\n\n\n\n                                      42\n\f                      CONCLUSION AND PRAYER\n     For the reasons stated, the Herbsts respectfully pray that the Court\n\nreverse the trial court’s grant of summary judgment for Murphy as well as\n\nits award of fees and remand this case to the trial court for further\n\nproceedings. The Herbsts seek such other and further relief, including the\n\ncosts of this appeal, to which they may be entitled.\n\n                                   Respectfully submitted,\n                                   GRAVES DOUGHERTY HEARON &\n                                   MOODY, P.C.\n                                   By: /s/ Mary A.

The Herbst #1H Well, on which Murphy commenced drilling\n\n                            operations June 8, 2012, was drilled as an off-set well pursuant to\n\n                            Paragraph 25 of the Leases and satisfies the requirements of Paragraph 25\n\n                            of the Leases; and\n\n                            c.     Murphy has not breached the Leases with regard to the drilling and\n\n                            completion of the Herbst #1H Well and does not owe compensatory or\n\n                            other royalties or any other obligations under Paragraph 25 as a result.\n\n                    2.      The Court has found that Murphy's attorneys' fees in the amount of\n\n      $120,853.36 and costs in the amount of $5,119.71 are reasonable and necessary and it is\n                                  CIVIL\n415\n                                     VOL              PAGE       1   16\n\f      equitable and just for Plaintiffs to pay Murphy's                 -and costs. Therefore, Plaintiffs\n\n      are ORDERED to pay          AllE1   •\n\n\n\n\n      5-1-20,853.36 anktcosts in the amount of $5,119.71.\n\n                       3.   The Court has further found that, should Plaintiffs appeal this Final\n\n      Judgment, Murphy will expend reasonable and necessary attorneys' fees in the amount of\n\n      $150,000 to defend the appeal. Therefore, should Plaintiffs unsuccessfully appeal this Final\n\n      Judgment, they are ORDERED to pay Murphy's reasonable and necessary attorneys' fees on\n\n      appeal in the amount of $150,000.\n\n                       4.   Plaintiffs TAKE NOTHING by their claims.\n\n                       5.

The amended Field Rules are\n     set out in their entirety as follows:\n\n            RULE 1: The entire correlative interval from 10,294 feet to 10,580 feet as shown\n     on the log of the EOG Resources, Inc. - Milton Unit, Well No. 1 (API. No. 42-255-31608),\n     Section 64, John Randon Survey, A-247, Karnes County, Texas, shall be designated as\n     a single reservoir for proration purposes and be designated as the Eagleville (Eagle Ford-\n     1) Field.\n\n            RULE 2: No well for oil or gas shall hereafter be drilled nearer than THREE\n     HUNDRED THIRTY (330) feet to any property line, lease line, or subdivision line. There\n     is no minimum between well spacing requirement. The aforementioned distances in the\n     above rule are minimum distances to allow an operator flexibility in locating a well; and the\n\n\n\n\n98\n\f     OIL AND GAS DOCKET NO. XX-XXXXXXX\n\n\n     above spacing rule and the other rules to follow are for the purpose of permitting only one\n     well to each drilling and proration unit. Provided however, that the Commission will grant\n     exceptions to permit drilling within shorter distances and drilling more wells than herein\n     prescribed, whenever the Commission shall have determined that such exceptions are\n     necessary either to prevent waste or to prevent the confiscation of property. When\n     exception to these rules is desired, application therefor shall be filed and will be acted upon\n     in accordance with the provisions of Commission Statewide Rules 37 and 38, which\n     applicable provisions of said rules are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n           In applying this rule, the general order of the Commission with relation to the\n     subdivision of property shall be observed.\n\n            Provided, however, that for purposes of spacing for horizontal wells, the following\n     shall apply:\n\n            a.     A take point in a horizontal drainhole well is any point along a horizontal\n                   drainhole where oil and/or gas can be produced from the reservoir/field\n                   interval. The first take point may be at a different location than the\n                   penetration point and the last take point may be at a location different than\n                   the terminus point.\n\n            b.     No horizontal drain hole well for oil or gas shall hereafter be drilled such that\n                   the first and last take point are nearer than ONE HUNDRED (100) feet to any\n                   property line, lease line or subdivision line.\n\n            c.     For each horizontal drainhole well, the perpendicular distance from any take\n                   point on such horizontal 'drainhole between the first take point and the last\n                   take point to any point on any property line, lease line or subdivision line\n                   shall be a minimum of THREE HUNDRED THIRTY (330) feet.\n\n           For the purpose of assigning additional acreage to a horizontal well pursuant to\n     Statewide Rule 86, the distance from the first take point to the last take point in the\n     horizontal drainhole shall be used in such determination, in lieu of the distance from\n     penetration point to terminus.\n\n             In addition to the penetration point and the terminus of the wellbore required to be\n     identified on the drilling permit application (Form W-1H) and plat, the first and last take\n     points must also be identified on the drilling permit application (Remarks Section) and plat.\n     Operators shall file an as-drilled plat showing the path, penetration point, terminus and the\n     first and last take points of all drainholes in horizontal wells, regardless of allocation\n     formula.\n\n            If the applicant has represented in the drilling application that there will be one or\n\n\n\n\n99\n\f                             •                                         •\n      OIL AND GAS DOCKET NO. XX-XXXXXXX\n\n\n      more no perf zones or \"NPZ's\" (portions of the wellbore within the field interval without take\n      points), then the as-drilled plat filed after completion of the well shall be certified by a\n      person with knowledge of the facts pertinent to the application that the plat is accurately\n      drawn to scale and correctly reflects all pertinent and required data. In addition to the\n      standard required data, the certified plat shall include the as-drilled track of the wellbore,\n      the location of each take point on the wellbore, the boundaries of any wholly or partially\n      unleased tracts within a Rule 37 distance of the wellbore, and notations of the shortest\n      distance from each wholly or partially unleased tract within a Rule 37 distance of the\n      wellbore to the nearest take point on the wellbore.\n\n             A properly permitted horizontal drainhole Will be considered to be in compliance with\n      the spacing rules set forth herein if the as-drilled location falls within a rectangle\n      established as follows:\n\n             a.     Two sides of the rectangle are parallel to the permitted drainhole and 33 feet\n                    on either side of the drainhole;\n\n             b.     The other two sides of the rectangle are perpendicular to the sides described\n                    in (a) above, with one of those sides passing through the first take point and\n                    the other side passing through the last take point.\n\n             Any point of a horizontal drainhole outside of the described rectangle must conform\n      to the permitted distance of the nearest property line, lease line or subdivision line\n      measured perpendicular from the wellbore.\n\n              For any well permitted in this field, the penetration point need not be located on the\n      same lease, pooled unit or unitized tract on which the well is permitted and may be located\n      on an Offsite Tract. When the penetration point is located on such Offsite Tract, the\n      applicant for such a drilling permit must give 21 days notice by certified mail, return receipt\n      requested to the mineral owners of the Offsite Tract. For the purposes of this rule, the\n      mineral owners of the Offsite Tract are (1) the designated operator; (2) all lessees of record\n      for the Offsite Tract where there is no designated operator; and (3) all owners of unleased\n      mineral interests where there is no designated operator or lessee. In providing such\n      notice, applicant must provide the mineral owners of the Offsite Tract with a plat clearly\n      depicting the projected path of the entire wellbore. In the event the applicant is unable,\n      after due diligence, to locate the whereabouts of any person to whom notice is required by\n      this rule, the applicant must publish notice of this application pursuant to the Commission's\n      Rules of Practice and Procedure. If any mineral owner of the Offsite Tract objects to the\n      location of the penetration point, the applicant may request a hearing to demonstrate the\n      necessity of the location of the penetration point of the well to prevent waste or to protect\n      correlative rights. Notice of Offsite Tract penetration is not required if (a) written waivers\n      of objection are received from all mineral owners of the Offsite Tract; or, (b) the applicant\n      is the only mineral owner of the Offsite Tract. To mitigate the potential for well collisions,\n\n\n\n\n100\n\f                              •                                          •\n      OIL AND GAS DOCKET NO. XX-XXXXXXX\n\n\n      applicant shall promptly provide copies of any directional surveys to the parties entitled to\n      notice under this section, upon request.\n\n               RULE 3: The acreage assigned to the individual oil well for the purpose of\n      allocating allowable oil production thereto shall be known as a proration unit. The standard\n      drilling and proration units are established hereby to be EIGHTY (80) acres. No proration\n      unit shall consist of more than EIGHTY (80) acres except as hereinafter provided. All\n      proration units shall consist of continuous and contiguous acreage which can reasonably\n      be considered to be productive of oil. No double assignment of acreage will be accepted.\n      Additional acreage may be assigned to each horizontal drainhole well in accordance with\n      Statewide Rule 86.\n\n             If after the drilling of the last well on any lease' and the assignment of acreage to\n      each well thereon in accordance with the regulations of the Commission there remains an\n      additional unassigned acreage of less than EIGHTY (80) acres, then and in such event the\n      remaining unassigned acreage up to and including a total of FORTY (40) acres may be\n      assigned as tolerance acreage to the last well drilled on such lease or may be distributed\n      among any group of wells located thereon, so long as the proration units resulting from the\n      inclusion of such additional acreage meet the limitations prescribed by the Commission.\n\n             An operator, at his option, shall be permitted to form optional drilling units of FORTY\n      (40) acres. A proportional acreage allowable credit will be given for a well on a fractional\n      proration unit.\n\n              For the determination of acreage credit in this field, operators shall file for each oil\n      or gas well in this field a Form P-15 Statement of Productivity of Acreage Assigned to\n      Proration Units. On that form or an attachment thereto, the operator shall list the number\n      of acres that are being assigned to each well on the lease or unit for proration purposes.\n      For oil or gas wells, operators shall be required to file, along with the Form P-15, a plat of\n      the lease, unit or property; provided that such plat shall not be required to show individual\n      proration units. There is no maximum diagonal limitation in this field.\n\n             RULE 4: The maximum daily oil allowable for a well in the field shall be determined\n      by multiplying 2,000 barrels of oil per day by a fraction, the numerator of which is the\n      acreage assigned to the well for proration purposes and the denominator of which is the\n      maximum acreage authorized by these field rules for a vertical well for proration purposes,\n      exclusive of tolerance acreage. Each oil well shall have unlimited net gas-oil ratio\n      authority.\n\n             RULE 5: A flowing oil well will be granted administratively, without necessity of filing\n      fees unless the Commission requires filing fees in the future for Statewide Rule 13(b)(4)(A)\n      exceptions, a six month exception to Statewide Rule 13(b)(4)(A) regarding the requirement\n      of having to be produced through tubing. A revised completion report will be filed once the\n\n\n\n\n101\n\f                             •                                          •\n      OIL AND GAS DOCKET NO. XX-XXXXXXX\n\n\n      oil well has been equipped with the required tubing string to reflect the actual completion\n      configuration. This exception would be applicable for new drills, reworks, recompletions\n      or for new fracture stimulation treatments for any flowing oil well in the field. For good\n      cause shown, which shall include the well flowing at a pressure in excess of 300 psi, an\n      operator may obtain administratively from the district director, without the necessity of filing\n      fees unlessthe Commission requires filing fees in the future for Statewide Rule 13(b)(4)(A)\n      exceptions, one or more extensions each with a duration of up to six months. If the\n      request for an extension of time is denied, the operator may request a hearing. If a hearing\n      is requested the exception shall remain in effect pendin2 final Commission action on the\n      request for an extension.\n\n              RULE 6: An oil well will be granted administratively, without necessity of filing fees\n      unless the Commission requires filing fees in the future for Statewide Rule 51(a)\n      exceptions, a six month exception to the provisions of Statewide Rule 51(a) regarding the\n      10 day rule for filing the potential test after testing of the well. This will allow for the\n      backdating of allowables on the oil wells without requiring a waiver to be secured from all\n      field operators. This rule will grant the Commission the authority to issue an allowable\n      back to the initial completion date for all oil wells in the field to prevent unnecessary shut-\n      ins to alleviate potential overproduction issues related to the completion paperwork filings\n      and producing the oil wells without tubing. If an extension of time is granted under Rule\n      5, the exception to Statewide Rule 51(a) under this rule is automatically extended for the\n      additional lime.\n\n            The Eagleville (Eagle Ford-1) Field is a hydrogen sulfide field and shall be regulated\n      pursuant to Statewide Rule 36.\n\n             Done this 6th day of August, 2013.\n\n                                                  RAILROAD COMMISSION OF TEXAS\n\n                                                  (Order approved and signatures affixed by\n                                                  Hearings Division's Unprotested Master\n                                                  Order dated August 6, 2013)\n\n\n\n\n102\n\f      TAB 5\nAffidavit of John McBeath\n\f                                         CAUSE NO. 13-05-0466-CVA\n\n      SHIRLEY ADAMS, CHARLENE                                     IN THE DISTRICT COURT\n      BURGESS, WILLIE MAY HERBST\n      JASIK, WILLIAM ALSBERT HERBST,\n      HELEN HERBST and\n      R.

My employer, Platt Sparks is a petroleum engineering consulting firm that provides\n\n            consulting services to its clients in the oil and gas industry with regard to a wide array of\n\n            oil and gas related issues including, but not limited to, regulatory compliance and filings,\n\n            reservoir engineering studies, log analysis, reserve determination, economic analysis, fair\n\n            market value determinations, reservoir simulation, damage analysis, and lease royalty\n\n            provision analysis. A significant portion of my practice involves advising clients with\n\n            respect to Eagle Ford Shale (\"EFS\") formation exploration and development issues. I\n\n           have numerous clients involved in this trend and routinely advise them on issues such as\n\n           permitting wells, regulatory compliance, operational issues and other petroleum\n\n           engineering matters. As such, I am familiar with terminology and issues applicable to\n\n           operations within the EFS.\n\n      4.   I am a 1987 graduate of the University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor of Science\n\n           degree in Petroleum Engineering. I am a licensed Professional Engineer in Texas,\n\n           Wyoming, and California, a member of the Society of Petrophysicists and Well Log\n\n           Analysts, and a member of the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers. A copy of\n\n           my resume is attached as Exhibit JCM 1.\n\n      5.   I have reviewed PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n\n           dated September 5, 2013.. I have been asked by counsel for Murphy to respond to\n\n           Plaintiffs' assertion that the Herbst B 1H Well is not an \"offset well\" under paragraph 25\n\n           of the leases at issue. (\"Shirley Lease\" and \"William Lease\") Specifically, I have been\n\n           asked whether the term \"offset well\" is a specialized term within the industry, and if so,\n\n           whether it has a commonly understand meaning within the industry.\n\n      6.

The EFS is a formation that underlies much of South Texas. It lies directly below the\n\n           Austin Chalk formation and has long been recognized as the hydrocarbon source rock for\n\n           the Austin Chalk. The EFS lies directly above the Buda Limestone formation. The EFS\n\n           varies in thickness from 20 feet to over 500 feet and in quality from top to bottom with\n\n           the Upper portion being carbonate-rich and the Lower portion shale-rich. The productive\n\n           part of the EFS is divided into oil, wet gas and dry gas areas. Exhibit ICM 1 contains a\n\n           map from the Energy Information Administration (\"EIA\") showing the different\n\n           producing areas of the EFS. Although a few wells historically produced from the\n\n           formation, development began in earnest in 2008 with the drilling of wells in La Salle\n\n           County by PetroHawk. These wells were the discovery of the Hawkville (Eagle Ford)\n\n           Field. Development has continued through current with most activity concentrated in the\n\n           oil and wet gas windows due to attractive liquids prices. Drilling efficiency has\n\n           improved significantly as well as the fine tuning of hydraulic fracture stimulation\n\n           treatments. Current development includes twenty-six Counties located in six RRC\n\n\n      AFFIDAVIT OF JOHN C. McBEATH, P.E.                                            Page 3\n\n174\n\f            districts. Exhibit JCM 3 is map from the RRC website showing the EFS development as\n\n            of January 2014.\n\n      8.    The Lucas \"A\" 1H well was drilled by Comstock Oil & Gas, LP in December 2011,\n\n            targeting the EFS. The RRC well completion papers and directional surveys all indicate\n\n            that the horizontal lateral was landed in the EFS. The form W-2 filed by Comstock\n\n            indicates that the well was completed on February 23, 2012. Exhibit JCM 4 is a\n\n            collection of RRC forms relating to the Lucas \"A\" 1H well. I have also reviewed the\n\n            RRC completion papers and directional survey for the Murphy Herbst B 1H well.\n\n            Drilling was initiated on Murphy's Herbst B 1H well on June 8, 2012. The Herbst well\n\n            horizontal lateral was also completed in the EFS. Exhibit JCM 5 is a collection of RRC\n\n            forms relating to the Herbst B 1H well.\n\n      9.    Drilling began on the Murphy Herbst 13 1H well less than 120 days after the Comstock\n\n            Lucas \"A\" 1H well was completed.\n\n      10.   Based on the information contained in the Affidavit of Mr. Kane Heinen, it is clear that\n\n            the Herbst B 1H well was drilled by Murphy to fulfill their obligation under paragraph 25\n\n            of the Shirley and Williams leases.\n\n      11.   The Murphy Herbst B 1H well was drilled to a depth adequate to test the same formatidn\n\n            from which the Comstock Lucas \"A\" 1H well produces.\n\n      12.   Based on my review of Plaintiffs' petition and motion for summary judgment, it is my\n\n            understanding that Plaintiffs contend that the Murphy Herbst B 1H well is not an offset\n\n            well to the Lucas \"A\" 1FI well because it is not as close as legally possible to the lease\n\n            line of the Lucas \"A\" lease. Plaintiffs' use of the term \"offset well\" is not consistent with\n\n            the industry use of the term.\n\n\n      AFFIDAVIT OF JOHN C. McBEATH, P.E.                                                  Page 4\n\n175\n\f      13.   The term \"offset well\" is a specialized term within the oil and gas industry and is\n\n            commonly understood within the industry as describing any well drilled on an adjacent\n\n            lease or property. The term \"offset well\" can also refer to the closest well, even if it is\n\n            located on another lease. It is my opinion that Plaintiffs are viewing the term \"offset\n\n            well,\" as used in paragraph 25 of the Lease, as \"direct offset well\". A direct offset well is\n\n            also a specialized term within the oil and gas industry, and is commonly understood to be\n\n            a well that is located directly across a lease line or other legal boundary. A direct offset\n\n            well can be located at the closest legal location or even closer if the operator applies for\n\n            and receives an RRC Rule 37 exception. A direct offset well is sometime called an\n\n            immediate offset well. Direct offset wells and immediate offset wells are included within\n\n            the term offset wells, but not all offset wells are direct or immediate offset wells.\n\n      14.   The term \"offset well\" is used in RRC Rule 36 to define which wells can be used to\n\n            estimate the escape rate for use in calculating a radius of exposure for a well subject to\n\n            Rule 36. The RRC has never limited the wells available in this determination to wells\n\n            directly across the lease line, and Rule 36 is further evidence of how the term offset well\n\n            is understood within the industry.\n\n      15.   RRC form H-1, related to RRC Rule 46, shows that the term \"offset well\" is understoOd\n\n            within the industry to describe any well drilled on adjacent property. The H-1 form\n\n            requires offset wells within Y2 mile of the subject well to be identified on a map.\n\n      16.   Finally, RRC Proposals for Decisions (\"PFD\") and Final Orders (\"FO\") XX-XXXXXXX, 8A-\n\n            0211820, XX-XXXXXXX and 7C-0240684 contain further examples of the RRC's use of the\n\n            terms offset well, direct offset well and immediate offset well. These PFDs and FOs\n\n            further confirm that each of these specialized terms have a commonly understood\n\n\n      AFFIDAVIT OF JOHN C. McBEATH, P.E.                                                   Page 5\n\n176\n\f            industry meaning, and that the term \"offset well\" is any well located on an adjacent\n\n            property, not just a well located directly across the lease line at the closest legal location.\n\n            That is a \"direct offset well.\"\n\n      17.   Based on my experience working with operators and other participants within the\n\n            industry, the usage of these terms by the RRC is consistent with how the terms are\n\n            commonly understood within the industry.\n\n      18.   I have reviewed the Shirley lease, dated August 14, 2009, and it is my opinion that the\n\n            Lease was drafted specifically for horizontal drilling in the EFS. The lease contains\n\n            specific language regarding horizontal wells and the size of pooled units associated with\n\n            horizontal wells. By August 2009, there was significant EFS development activity\n\n            nearby in Live Oak and Karnes Counties.\n\n      19.   Plaintiffs' contention that an offset well, as used in the Lease, exists to protect their\n\n            acreage from drainage is not correct. Due to the reservoir characteristics of the EFS, the\n\n            formation will not produce without large multi-stage hydraulic fracture jobs that provide\n\n            pathways between the formation and the wellbore. In the early development of the trend,\n\n            it was recognized that even with these hydraulic fracture stimulation jobs, a relatively\n\n            modest amount of reservoir is drained by each horizontal well. The RRC assigned leae\n\n            line spacing rules that reflect this reality. Recently, several operators have installed pilot\n\n            programs to test the sensitivity of well spacing to well recoveries. Early indications\n\n            confirm that spacing horizontal laterals as close as 225 feet results in well recoveries\n\n            comparable to much wider spaced laterals.\n\n\n\n\n      AFFIDAVIT OF JOHN C. McI3EATH, P.E.                                                  Page 6\n177\n\f      20.   The reservoir characteristics of the EFS further support my conclusion that the\n\n            specialized term \"offset well,\" as used in Paragraph 25 of the Lease, is not commonly\n\n            understood as a well drilled within 350 feet of the Lease line, as Plaintiffs contend.\n\n      21.   Plaintiffs refer to Williams and Meyers' Manual of Oil & Gas Terms for the definition of\n\n            Offset Clause. The definition of Offset Clause refers to Offset Well, another definition in\n\n            Williams & Meyers. Although Williams and Meyers states that the Offset Well is\n\n            intended to prevent drainage, neither definitions refer to a specific distance requirement\n\n            for an Offset Well. As stated above, the conventional concept of drainage across lease\n\n            lines has limited application in the EFS. Williams & Meyers offset well definition does\n\n            refer to \"direct offsetting\" when discussing wells that are directly across lease line on\n\n            equal-sized spacing units. Plaintiffs also refer to two on-line dictionaries having the same\n\n            definition of offset well. Before reading the Plaintiffs' motion I had not encountered\n\n            these sources. As stated above, it is my opinion that the term offset well encompasses the\n\n            more narrowly defined direct offset well. The on-line definitions used by Plaintiffs' more\n\n            accurately describe direct offset wells. My personal copy of \"A Dictionary of Petroleum\n\n            Terms\" 2\" ed. contains the following definition:\n\n                   offset well n: a well drilled on a tract of land next to another owner's tract on\n                   which there is a producing well.\n\n      22.   Based on my review of the information discussed above and my professional experience\n\n            in the industry for the past 25 years, it is my opinion that the Herbst B 1H well drilled by\n\n            Murphy on the Shirley and William leases is an offset well as that term is commonly\n\n            understood and used in the industry and paragraph 25 of the leases.\n\n\n\n\n      AFFIDAVIT OF JOHN C.

Regency also requests that a new field, the Tilden,S. (Wilcox H2S Disposal)\n      Field, be set up for this disposal well. A permit for injection pursuant to Statewide Rule 46\n      can be administratively granted. However, Statewide Rule 36(c)(10)(A) requires that a\n      public hearing be held before the injection of fluid containing hydrogen sulfide (\" H2S\" or\n      \"sour gas\").\n\n             The Commission's Field Operations section has reviewed the application and\n      contingency plan and recommends approval of the application contingent on the following\n      conditions:\n\n             1.     That a new field designation is approved for the well, with such field name\n                    reflecting the potential presence of H2S in this area; and\n\n\n             2.     That Regency demonstrates through plume analysis and offset well\n                    construction/plugging evaluation that the injected fluids will be confined to the\n                    proposed disposal zone.\n\n                                                                                             EXHIBIT\n\n247\n\f                               •                                       •\n      Oil & Gas Docket No. XX-XXXXXXX                                                        Page 2\n\n       '    This application was unprotested and the examiner recommends approval of the\n      Rule 36 and Rule 46 authority.\n\n                                  DISCUSSION OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n             Regency's Tilden Gas Processing Plant has been in operation for many years,\n      removing carbon dioxide (\"CO2\") and 112S from the gas stream produced by wells in the\n      area. The waste CO2 and •H2S gas has been flared under TCEQ authority. Regency is\n      proposing that this waste gas, or acid gas, be compressed into a liquid and disposed of into\n      the proposed Tilden GPI No. 1. The Tilden GPI No. 1 has not yet been drilled, but is\n      proposed to be located within the fenced area of the Tilden plant.\n\n             Regency requests authority to dispose of a maximum of 1,924 BPD of compressed\n      acid gas. This is the equivalent of approximately 5,000 MCFD. The requested maximum\n      surface injection pressure is 2,925 psig.\n\n               The Tilden GPI No. 1 will be drilled to a total depth of approximately 6,900 feet. The\n      well will have three strings of casing cemented to surface: 13 3/s\" to 350 feet, 9 %\" to 5,200\n      feet and 5W' to total depth. The TCEQ recommends that useable quality water be\n      protected to a depth of 100 feet and that the Carrizo be protected between 4,400 feet and\n      5,100 feet. Injection will be through tubing set on a packer at approximately 5,800 feet.\n      All of the tubular equipment which may come in contact with H2S are H2S-resistant stainless\n      steels and alloys that meet all Commission and industry standards for handling H2S.\n\n              The proposed disposal interval is the Wilcox between 5,870 feet and 6,800 feet.\n      This zone has not been produced in any well within a /z mile radius but the application was\n      filed pursuant to Rule 46 because Regency has not established that there is no production\n      from this interval within. 21/2 miles. Establishing a new field designation called Tilden, S.\n      (Wilcox H2S Disposal). Field will identify the proposed disposal zone as a formation now\n      containing hydrogen sulfide. Any operators drilling in the area will be aware of the potential\n      of H2S existing in an otherwise non-sour formation.\n\n             There are 11 wellbores within 1/2 mile of the proposed well. Three of the wells did\n      not penetrate the proposed Wilcox disposal interval. Of the eight wells which penetrated\n      the disposal interval, four were dry holes with no production casing set. All four of these\n      wells have cement plugs across the base of useable quality water. The four remaining\n      wells have production casing cemented to surface from deeper horizons. The completion\n      and/or plugging of these wells is such that the proposed disposal will not affect useable\n      quality water.\n\n              To estimate reservoir parameters at the location of the proposed Tilden GPI No. 1,\n      Regency analyzed the log of the Vaughn Petroleum Company - J.M. Dickinson No. 2. This\n      well is the closest well which penetrated the disposal interval and is approximately 1,600\n      feet to the southwest of the proposed disposal well. The Dickinson No. 2 was drilled in\n      1970 to a total depth of approximately 6,900 feet and was plugged and abandoned as a dry\n\n\n\n248\n\f                                  •\n        Oil & Gas Docket No. XX-XXXXXXX                                                           Page 3\n\n       hole. In the Dickinson No. 2, the average porosity of the Wilcox interval proposed for\n       disposal is 17% over 117 feet of thickness. Average permeability is 10.8 md. The log of\n       this well indicates the presence of at least 250 feet of shale overlying the disposal interval\n       and at least 100 feet of shale below the disposal interval. These shale barriers will prevent\n       the migration of acid gas from the disposal zone. Regency submitted two cross-sections\n       of area wells demonstrating that both the proposed disposal interval and the confining shale\n       barriers are continuous across the area.\n\n              Computer simulations of pressure and fluid migration were performed to predict the\n       maximum probable extent of waste migrations. The numerical model SWIFT was used for\n       the predictions. Input data included . the porosity and thickness determined from the\n       Dickinson No. 2 well, a project life of 40 years, and an average daily rate of 2,100 BPD\n       (which exceeds the requested rate of 1,924 BPD). This model has been accepted\n       nationally for hazardous waste wells by the EPA and has been previously accepted by the\n       Railroad Commission.\n\n               The initial pressure in the proposed disposal interval is assumed to be 3,400 psi.\n       After 40 years.of injection, the pressure increase near the wellbore is calculated to be 3,975\n       psi. Approximately one mile away, the pressure is predicted to be 3,725 Psi after 40 years\n       of injection.\n\n               The waste being disposed of consists of approximately 34% hydrogen sulfide, 64%\n       carbon dioxide and 2% natural gas. Acid gas concentrations were calculated and mapped\n       based on the modeling. The outer edge of the injection plume is represented by a. 1%\n       contour line, where the fluid is 99% formation fluid and 1% acid gas. The maximum extent\n       of this 1% line is 2,200 feet from the injection well after 40 years of injection. There are five\n       vvellbores within 2,200 feet of the proposed well. Two of the five wells within 2,200 feet did\n       not penetrate the disposal interval. Another two of the five wells have production casing\n       cemented through the disposal.interval. The fifth well within 2,200 feet is the Dickinson No.\n       2 drilled in 1970 to a total depth of 6,913 feet. This well has no production casing but has\n       a plug set at 4,960 feet and at 5,409 feet. The only interval open in the Dickinson No. 2 is\n       the proposed Wilcox disposal interval, about 300 feet of shale above the disposal interval,\n       and about 100 feet of shale below the disposal interval. Therefore, no existing wellbore\n       within the injection, plume will be a conduit for migration of injected fluid outside the disposal\n       interval.\n\n                 To estimate maximum blowout release rate and pressures, Regency employed\n        Fekete Associates, Inc. Fekete's study assumes that the acid gas injection well has been\n      . drilled, completed and is actively injecting, prior to a loss-of-control incident at the wellhead.\n        Worst case conditions are also assumed. The results of the study indicate a maximum\n        escape rate through the 27/8\" tubing of 14 MMCFD. Similarly, if the loss-of-control events\n        occurs through the 5%\" casing, the maximum escape rate would be 21.5 MMCFD.\n\n             Regency employed Quest Consultants, Inc. to perform gas dispersion modeling\n       based on the results of the maximum escape rates previously determined by Fekete.\n\n\n\n249\n\f                               •                                       •\n      Oil & Gas Docket No. XX-XXXXXXX                                                        Page 4\n      Quest used a dispersion model called CANARY to determine the radius of exposure\n      (\"ROE\") to. H2S. This model calculates release conditions, initial dilution of the vapor, and\n      subsequent vapor dispersion. The model accounts for thermodynamics, mixture behavior,\n      transient release rates, gas cloud density, initial velocity of the gas and heat transfer\n      effects. This model has been previously accepted by the Railroad Commission. The\n      calculated ROE for 100 ppm H2S, due to the maximum catastrophic release on the\n      proposed injection well, is 2,655 feet. For 500 ppm, the calculated ROE is 1,495 feet. Both\n      of these calculated ROE's are already within the area covered by the approved\n      contingency plan for the Tilden Gas Processing Plant.\n\n              Regency has modified the contingency plan for the Tilden Gas Processing Plant to\n      incorporate the proposed disposal operations. There are no residences or public places\n      within the 100 ppm ROE for the disposal well and no public roads within the 500 ppm ROE\n      for the well. The contingency plan for the plant covers a much larger area.\n\n             The injection system is designed with numerous safeguards. The wellhead will be\n      equipped with emergency shut-down valves and down-hole check valves will be installed\n      to prevent surface flow through the tubing. The tubing and casing pressure, tubing and\n      casing temperature, injection rate, and H2S detection equipment will be continuously\n      monitored. The gas processing plant is manned 24 hours a day with personnel trained in\n      the recognition of and response to H2S alarms.\n\n                                          FINDINGS OF FACT\n\n      1.     Notice of this application to inject fluid containing hydrogen sulfide was issued to all.\n             surface owners and offsetting operators within % mile of the proposed well, and the\n             McMullen County Clerk.on September 22, 2006.

Notice of the application was published in The Progress, a newspaper of general\n            circulation in McMullen County, Texas, on September 20, September 27, October\n            4, and October 11, 2006.\n\n      3.    The proposed injection well, the Tilden GPI Well No. 1, will dispose of compressed\n            waste gas containing H2S. This waste gas is removed from hydrocarbon gas at\n            Regency's Tilden Gas Processing Plant.\n\n      4.    The Tilden GPI No. 1 will inject at rates up to 1,924 BPD of compressed acid gas.\n            This is the equivalent of approximately 5,000 MCFD. This acid gas contains\n            approximately 34% hydrogen sulfide, 64% carbon dioxide and 2% natural gas.\n\n      5.    The proposed Tilden GPI No. 1 will be drilled, cased and cemented to confine the\n            injected fluid to the proposed Wilcox disposal zone.\n\n             a.     The requested injection interval is the Wilcox between 5,870 feet and 6,800\n                    feet. This interval has not been completed in any well within 1/2 mile.\n\n\n\n250\n\f                               •                                       •\n      Oil & Gas Docket No. XX-XXXXXXX                                                        Page 5\n\n\n            b.     The TCEQ recommends that useable quality water be protected to a depth\n                   of 100 feet and that the Carrizo be protected between 4,400 feet and 5,100\n                   feet.\n\n            c.     The well will have three strings of casing cemented to surface: 13 3/8\" to 350\n                   feet, 9 W to 5,200 feet and 5W to total depth.\n\n            d.     Injection will be through tubing set on a packer at approximately 5,800 feet.\n\n            e.     All of the equipment installed that might come in contact with H2S will be\n                   stainless steel and alloys that meet all Commission and industry safety\n                   standards.\n\n            f.     If the injection fluid is not confined to the approved strata, then the disposal\n                   well permit will be suspended and disposal cease until the fluid 'migration\n                   from such strata is eliminated.\n\n      6.    The field name of Tilden, S. (Wilcox H2S Disposal) should be approved for the\n            disposal interval to alert other operators in the area to the possibility of encountering\n            sour gas in this otherwise non-sour formation.\n\n      7.    The disposal well is inside the fenced area which surrounds the Tilden Gas\n            Processing Plant.\n\n      8.    The requested maximum surface injection pressure is 2,925 psig.\n\n      9.    The injection well, compressor and flow lines transmitting sour gas, will be designed\n            to contain the sour gas, and monitoring devices will immediately shut down the\n            system if any leakage of sour gas is detected.\n\n      10.   The proposed disposal well is within the area covered by the contingency plan for\n            the processing plant.\n\n      11.   The calculated ROE for 100 ppm H2S due to a catastrophic release from the well is\n            2,655,2feet. The calculated exposure radius ROE for 500 ppm H2S due to a\n            catastrophic release from the well is 1,495 feet.\n\n      12.   There are no residences or public places within the 100 ppm ROE for the disposal\n            well and no public roads within the 500 ppm ROE for the well.\n\n      13.   No existing well will be a conduit for migration of injected fluid outside the disposal\n            interval.\n\n            a.     The maximum extent of the 1% acid gas plume is 2,200 feet from the\n\n\n\n251\n\f      Oil & Gas Docket No. XX-XXXXXXX                                                        Page.6\n\n                   injection well after 40 years of injection.\n\n            b.     There are five wellbores within 2,200 feet of the proposed well.\n\n            c.     Two of the five wells within 2,200 feet did not penetrate the disposal interval.\n\n            d.     Two of the five wells within 2,200 feet have production casing cemented\n                   through the disposal interval.\n\n            e.     The fifth well within 2,200 feet is the Dickinson No. 2 drilled in 1970 to a total\n                   depth of 6,913 feet. This well has no production casing but has a plug set at\n                   4,960 feet and at 5,409 feet. The only interval open in the Dickinson No. 2\n                   is the proposed Wilcox disposal interval, about 300 feet of shale above the\n                   disposal interval, and about 100 feet of shale below the disposal interval.\n\n      14.   Regency has met the conditions for approval' set forth by the Field Operations\n            section of the Railroad Commission.\n\n                                      CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\n      1.    Proper notice was issued as applicable in all statutes and regulatory codes.\n\n      2.    Altthings have.occurred and been accomplished to give the Commission jurisdiction\n            in this matter.\n\n      3.    The application of Regency FS LP to inject hydrogen sulfide gas into the Tilden GPI\n            No. 1, Tilden, S. (Wilcox H2S Disposal) Field, McMullen County, complies with the\n            applicable provisions of Statewide Rules 46 and 36, 16 T.A.C. §3.46 and §3.36.\n\n                                EXAMINER'S RECOMMENDATION\n\n            Based on the above findings and conclusions, the examiner recommends that the\n      application of Regency FS LP be APPROVED. A new field designation of Tilden, S.\n      (Wilcox H2S Disposal) Field should be approved for the disposal interval.\n\n                                                        Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n                                                        Donna K.

Coastal\n      requests a Rule 37 permit for the following fields: the Jeffress, N.E. (Vicksburg Lo)\n      Field, which is the primary objective; the Jeffress, N.E. (T, Lo-FB,A) Field; the\n      Jeffress, N.E. (Vicksburg T) Field; the Jeffress, N.E. Nicks. T-Lower) Field; the\n      Jeffress, N.E. (Vicksburg L.) Field; and Wildcat (above 16,500').\n\n             Coastal proposes to locate the well 349' from its nearest lease line, whereas\n      field rules for all applied-for fields require a distance of 467'. Therefore, a Rule 37\n      exception is necessary.\n\n              Coastal's application is protested by Coates Energy, Trust (\"Coates\"). Coates\n      owns a royalty interest and appears to own an unleased mineral interest below\n      13,710' under an immediately offsetting tract.      Initially, Coastal challenged Coates'\n      standing to protest but withdrew its objection after conceding that Coates probably\n      has mineral ownership below • 13,710' on the tract to the east of the Adame Gas Unit.\n      Coates also claims ownership of a strip of land within the Adame Gas Unit on its\n      eastern edge. .This claim has resulted in a title dispute between Coastal and Coates\n      that is now before the courts. The proposed well is not located on this disputed strip.\n\n             Before presenting its technical case on the merits, Coastal established its good\n      faith claim to title to the disputed strip through deeds, oil and gas leases, and an\n      affidavit of adverse possession. Coates did not contend that Coastal failed to prove\n      a -good faith claim to title.    The parties recognize that the title question must be\n      resolved by the courts.\n\n\n                                  DISCUSSION OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n            Coastal presented the only evidence concerning the merits of its Rule 37\n      application. Its case is based on conftcation; the issue of waste was not addressed.\n\n             The primary target, the Jeffress, N.E. (Vicksburg Lo) Field, was referred to\n      throughout the hearing as the \"W\" sand. The lower Vicksburg in Hidalgo County is\n      composed of a sequence of sands amid a series of down-to-the-basin and antithetic\n      faults. Coastal designated four sand objectives in this area, the \"W\" sand being the\n      deepest at approximately 13,400'.\n\n             The original recoverable reserves under the Adame Gas Unit in the \"W\" sand\n      were 7.3 billion cubic feet (\"BCF\") of gas. Decline curve analysis indicates that the\n      existing well, the Adame Well No. 1, will ultimately recover only 2 BCF. Because of\n      faulting in the upper lobe of the \"W\" sand, approximately 240' of section is missing\n      from the Adame Well No. 1. Therefore, the net pay that is characteristic of that upper\n      lobe in surrounding wells is not available to the Adame Well No. 1. An offset well, the\n      Coastal E-1, is draining the area of the proposed well on the Adame Gas Unit.\n      Ultimately, if this drainage continues unchecked, the Coastal E-1 will recover\n\n\n\n\n259\n\f      Rule 37 Case No. 0213270                                                           Page 3\n\n      approximately 2.9 BCF from under the Adame Gas Unit.            (Total recovery for the\n      Coastal E-1 is estimated to be 10.5 BCF.) There remain current recoverable reserves\n      under the Adame Gas Unit that will be unrecovered by Coastal if Coastal does not\n      drill a second well on The unit. Royalty owners within the Adame Gas Unit do not\n      participate in production in the \"W\" sand from any offset well.\n\n             There are no regular locations that will afford the mineral owners an opportunity\n      to .recover their share of the hydrocarbons in the \"W\" sand. Due to extensive faulting\n      in the area, a regular location to the east of the proposed location would encounter\n      the downthrown side of Fault \"E\". All regular locations in the southern portion of the\n      Adame Gas Unit fall in the middle of Fault \"D\".\n\n              If Coastal drilled at these regular locations, it would again lose a large section\n      of the \"W\" sand, with significant. decrease in the well's recoverable reserves. This\n      loss of a large section of the reservoir combined with reduced net pay (less than 50')\n      as one moves west in the reservoir on the southern portion of .the tract make it\n      impossible for applicant to recover its fair share from this portion of the tract. The net\n      pay is approximately 50' at the proposed location.\n\n\n                                       EXAMINERS' OPINION\n\n             The examiners are of the opinion that an additional well on the Adame Gas Unit\n      is necessary to protect the correlative rights of the Adame royalty owners, who do not\n      share in production 'from the \"W\" sand from any offset well. Because of loss of a\n      section of reservoir due to the fault, the existing well will recover only 2 BCF of the\n      recoverable gas of 7.3 BCF under the Adame Gas Unit.\n\n             A Rule 37. location is necessary. Wells at regular locations would encounter\n      the numerous faults and consequent loss of a portiori of the reservoir.        At such\n      locations Coastal and its royalty owners would not have an opportunity to recover the\n      hydrocarbons under the Adame Gas Unit.            The proposed_ Rule 37 location is\n      reasonable. It is a location that offsets the Coastal El well and counters the ongoing\n      drainage of. the Adame Gas Unit on the \"W\" sand.              The proposed location is\n      approximately 900' from the Adame Gas Unit's east lease line, which separates the\n      applicant's and protestant's leases.\n\n             Coastal did not present any evidence of the amount of recoverable reserves\n      under the Adame Gas Unit in the Jeffress, N.E. (T, LO.-FB,A), Jeffress, N.E.\n      (Vicksburg T), Jeffress, N.E. (Vicksburg T Lo), and Jeffress, N.E. (Vicksburg L) Fields.\n      Similarly, Coastal did not present any evidence that a well at a regular location could\n      not produce Coastal's fair share of these reserves.\n\n\n\n                                        FINDINGS OF FACT\n\n      1.    At least ten (10) days notice of hearing was sent to all designated operators,\n\n\n\n\n260\n\f          Rule 37 Case No. 0213270                                                          Page 4\n\n                lessees of record for tracts having no designated operator, and owners of\n                record of unleased mineral interests, for each adjacent tract and each tract\n                nearer than 467' to the applicant's proposed well.\n\n          2.    Coastal Oil and Gas Corporation, the applicant herein, has requested on Form\n                W-1 a Rule 37 exception to drill Well No. 2 on the Adame Gas Unit in Hidalgo\n                County, Texas. The proposed well will be 349' from the nearest lease line,\n                whereas field rules for the applied-for fields require a ,distance of 467'.\n\n          3.    Coastal's application is for the following primary objective:      Jeffress, N.E.\n                (Vicksburg Lo) Field (\"the \"W\" sand\"). Secondary objectives are Jeffress, N.E.\n                (T, LoFB,A), Jeffress, N.E. (Vicksburg T), Jeffress, N.E. Nicks. T-Lower),\n•               Jeffress, N.E. (Vicksburg L.), and Wildcat (above 16,500') Fields.\n\n          4.    The existing.. well, the Adame No. 1, is incapable of producing all of the\n                recoverable gas under the Adame Unit in the \"W\" sand.\n\n                a.     The Adame Well No. 1 is expected to produce ultimately approximately\n                       2 BCF of gas. Ultimate recoveries by adjacent wells producing from the\n                       \"W\" sand range from 19 BCF to 10.4 BCF.\n\n                b.     The poor performance of the Adame No. 1 relative to the other wells in\n                       the field is attributable to a fault cut in the \"W\" sand.\n\n          5.    A well at any regular location on the Adame Gas Unit could also be expected\n                to be cut by a fault, lose a portion of the reservoir, and not recover the tract's\n                reserves.\n\n          6.    There are recoverable gas reserves of approximately 7.3 BCF under the\n                Adame Gas Unit. The existing well will not recover 5.3 BCF under the Adame\n                Gas Unit.\n\n          7.    A well at the proposed location is necessary to allow penetration of the entire\n                \"W\" sand interval and is necessary to give the mineral interest owners of the\n                Adame tract a reasonable opportunity to recover the reserves under the tract.\n\n          8.    Royalty owners of the Adame Gas Unit do not participate in production in the\n                \"W\" sand from any adjacent well.\n\n          9.    Regular locations exist on the Adame Gas Unit, and there is insufficient\n                evidence that a Rule 37 location \"is necessary to recover the reserves, which\n                were not quantified, in the Jeffress, N.E.

Proper notice was issued timely to all persons legally entitled to notice.\n\n      2.    All things have been done or have occurred to give the Railroad Commission\n            jurisdiction to decide this matter.\n\n      3.    The applicant proved that Well No. 2 at the proposed Rule 37 exception .\n            location is necessary, to give the mineral owners of the Adame. Gas Unit an\n            opportunity to recover their fair share of the hydrocarbons from the Jeffress\n            N.E. (Vicksburg Lo) and Wildcat (above 16,500') Fields.\n\n      4.

(\"Applicant\" or \"Encore\") seeks an exception to Statewide Rule 37\n      to drill Well No. 2 on the Vada Bean Lease as a gas well in the Ozona (Canyon Sand) Field.' The\n      Vada Bean Lease is a narrow rectangular shaped 63.30 acre tract with no locations regular to lease\n      line spacing requirements in the Ozona (Canyon Sand) Field due to the configuration of the lease.\n      Encore previously drilled the Vada Bean No. 1 Well on the southernmost 40 acres of the lease, 938\n      feet south of the proposed location for the Vada Bean No. 2. The proposed well will be located 275\n      feet from the eastern lease line and 2.54 feet from the western lease line on the remaining 23.30\n      acres.' The proposed well is regular to all other lease line boundaries. A copy of the plat filed with\n      Applicant's W-1 Application for Permit to Drill, Deepen, Plug.Back or Re-Enter is attached. The\n      Ozona (Canyon. Sand) Field is subject to spacing requirements of 467 feet minimum distance to the\n      nearest lease line and 1200 feet minimum distance between wells for oil wells and 660 feet\n      minimum distance to the nearest lease line and 933 feet minimum distance between wells for gas\n      wells.\n\n           The application is protested by Devon Energy Production, L.P. (\"Devon\"), the offset\n  • operator of the adjacent eastern tract. The offset operator to the west did not protest Encore's\n    application.\n\n                                             APPLICANT'S POSITION AND EVIDENCE\n\n              Encore claims that the applied-for well is necessary to prevent confiscation as its existing\n      Well No. '1 will not recover its fair share of the remaining recoverable natural gas underlying the\n      Vada Bean Lease. Encore also claims that the proposed well would produce a significant volume\n      of natural gas underlying the northernmost 23 acres of the Vada Bean Lease in the Ozona (Canyon\n      Sand) Field which would not be recovered by either any existing wells or wells which would be\n      located at any regular location, thereby warranting an exception permit to prevent waste.\n\n              With respect to its confiscation argument, Encore's volumetric analysis estimates that\n      between 2.2 Bcf and .365 Bcf. f natural gas underlying its Vada Bean Lease will not be recovered\n      from the existing Vada Bean No. 1 Well. For its high end estimate, Encore believes that the low\n      permeability in the Ozona (Canyon Sand) Field, prevented any offsetting wells from draining\n      reserves from the Vada Bean Lease. Encore therefore asserts that the original recoverable gas in\n      place of 3.2 Bcf, less the estimated cumulative reserves which will be recovered from the Vada Bean\n      No. 1 Well of .97 Bcf, is a proper measure for calculating its fair share of reserves currently\n      underlying its lease.\n\n\n                 t Field Rules for the Ozona (Canyon Sand) Field reference both the oil field rules and the gas field rules. Encore's\n      presentation and all evidence was limited to the drilling of a gas well, accordingly the proposed final order is limited to a gas\n      well at the proposed location.\n                2\n                  The Field Rules for gas wells in the Ozona (Canyon Sand) Field allow for 320 acre units, with optional 40 acre units.\n      Statewide Rule 38(c) allows for \"tolerance wells\", without a density exception, if the remaining acreage on a lease is equal or\n      greater to 50% of the smallest amount established for an optional drilling unit.\n\n\n\n\n265\n\f      RULE 37 CASE No. 0240684                                                                                                   Page 3\n\n\n\n\n             In support of the high estimate, Encore contends that its Vada Bean No. 1 Well came in at\n      or near virgin reservoir pressure. Assuming virgin pressure of 2604 psig as the bottomhole\n      pressure, the calculated recoverable reserves of the Veda Bean Lease under original conditions were\n      3.2 Bcf. Encore believes a well at the proposed location will also encounter virgin reservoir\n      conditions due to the low reservoir permeability.\n\n               With respect to its low estimate of .365 Bcf, Encore's volumetric analysis uses a reservoir\n      pressure of 1530 psig to calculate the remaining recoverable reserves. This pressure was calculated\n      from the shut-in tubing pressure test measured in Encore's Vada Bean No. 1 Well after it had\n      produced for three days. Encore does not believe that the shut-in tubing pressure test accurately\n      reflects current reservoir conditions as the test was not performed over a long enough period of time.\n      Encore suggests that an accurate test in such a tight formation would require a well to be shut in for\n      several hundred hours. Using 1530 psig in Encore's volumetric calculations yields an estimate of\n      recoverable gas in place of 1.336 Bcf. Subtracting the estimated cumulative recovery from the Vada\n      Bean No. 1 Well of . 972 Bcf yields a remainder of .365 Bcf of recoverable reserves that will not\n      be produced by the existing well.\n\n             Encore also relies on maps depicting the drainage patterns .of the existing wells on and\n      adjacent to its Vada Bean Lease to support its case. Based on these maps, Encore asserts that the\n      acreage in the northern end of the Vada Bean Lease has not and will not be drained by its existing\n      well, other existing wells offsetting its lease, or any well which would be drilled at a regular\n      location.\n\n              Encore's volumetric analysis relies on a phi h3 isopach map derived from its geologic\n      interpretation of reservoir and digital log analyses estimating the total net pay encountered from a\n      cross section of wells completed in the Ozona (Canyon Sand) Field, including its Vada Bean No.\n      1 Well. Encore contends that a high phi h value for the Vada Bean No. 1 Well is justified by the\n      current production from that well, which came in among the top wells in the field. Encore also\n      presented a decline curve analysis for its existing Vada Bean No. 1 well to show that the estimated\n      cumulative recovery from that well will only be .972 Bcf. Finally, Encore further asserts that the\n      location is reasonable because there are no regular locations on the tract and the location is roughly\n      equidistant between the eastern and western lease lines.\n\n               Encore also claims that Devon's competing phi h isopach map does not accurately depict the\n      Ozona (Canyon Sand) Field, pointing out several inaccuracies in contouring and reported phi h\n      values for individual wells. Encore also asserts that Devon's volumetric analysis is flawed because\n      it relies on an inaccurate 24 hour pressure test result reported from Devon's Vada Bean No. 12 well.\n\n\n\n\n               3\n                  Phi h is a dimensionless number calculated by multiplying the number of feet of net pay by the estimated porosity in\n      that net pay.\n\n\n\n\n266\n\f                                                                           •\n      RULE 37 CASE No. 0240684                                                                       Page 4\n\n\n\n                                  PROTESTANT'S POSITION AND EVIDENCE\n\n              Devon contends that Encore has.overestimated the amount of remaining recoverable natural\n      gas underlying the Vada Bean Lease in the Ozona (Canyon Sand) Field. Devon argues that using\n      Encore's own decline curve analysis with a volumetric analysis based on more current pressure data,\n      Encore's Vada Bean No. I Well will ultimately recover more than its fair share of the remaining\n      recoverable natural gas underlying the Vada Bean Lease.\n\n              Devon did not offer a competing geologic interpretation for the depositional environment\n      or a top of structure map for the Ozona (Canyon Sand) Field. However, Devon challenges the\n      precision of Encore's estimates of pay from the digital log studies and phi h values Encore assigns\n      to the Vada Bean No. 1 Well.\n\n              Devon asserts that Encore overestimates the net pay for the Ozona (Canyon Sand) Field for\n      its Vada Bean No. 1 Well. Devon claims that Encore's log analysis for its Vada Bean No. 1 Well\n      erred because the porosity log was run on a limestone matrix instead of a sandstone matrix, thereby\n      overestimating porosity by at least 4%. Devon further argues that Encore failed to account for\n      spalling in its Vada Bean No. 1 Well, a common phenomenon during drilling in this area. Spalling\n      occurs when rock particles break off into the borehole face of the wellbore, leading to an inaccurate\n      and inflated porosity reading. Devon contends that Encore's estimates should have capped\n      maximum porosity readings at 14%. Encore considered the log reading as accurate even where it\n      indicated as much as 30% porosity, thereby leading to a significantly higher phi h value for Encore's\n      Vada Bean No. I Well than Devon believes is correct. Devon urges that its own phi h isopach map\n      is based on proper porosity cut-offs at both the upper and lower ends of the scale, thereby showing\n      a more accurate depiction of the reservoir conditions on Encore's Vada Bean Lease.\n\n              Devon also contends that the bottomhole pressure tested in the Vada Bean No. 1 Well of\n      1530 psi in October 2004 was correct. Devon further asserts that Encore's volumetric calculations\n      and decline curve analysis ignore recent pressure data from Devon's Vada Bean No. 12 Well which\n      offsets the Encore acreage. This pressure data comes from a build up test in January 2005 from\n      which the reservoir pressure can be calculated at 1395 psi. Using this reservoir pressure and its phi\n      h isopach map, Devon's calculations find that the remaining recoverable reserves underlying the\n      Vada Bean Lease total approximately .84 Bcf. Devon calculates that the remaining recovery from\n      the Vada Bean No. 1 Well will be .86 Bcf, which exceeds what Devon asserts is its more accurate\n      estimate of the remaining recoverable reserves underlying Encore's Vada Bean Lease.\n\n                                            EXAMINERS' OPINION\n\n               As discussed below, Encore asserts that an exception to the lease line spacing requirements\n      is justified both to prevent confiscation and waste. It is the examiners' opinion that Encore has\n      established that an exception permit is warranted under the confiscation test. Accordingly, no\n      discussion is required on Encore's claim that an exception is necessary to prevent waste.\n\n\n\n\n267\n\f                                   •                                           •\n      RULE 37 CASE No. 0240684                                                                           Pa.ge 5\n\n\n\n             To establish entitlement to an exception to Rule 37 to prevent confiscation, an applicant must\n      show that, absent the applied-for well, it will be denied a reasonable opportunity to recover its fair\n      share of hydrocarbons currently in place under the lease, or its equivalent in kind. The applicant\n      must satisfy a two pronged test: 1) the applicant must show that it will not be afforded a reasonable\n      opportunity to recover its fair share of hydrocarbons currently in place by drilling a well at a regular\n      location; and 2) the applicant must show that the proposed irregular location is reasonable.\n      Generally, the applicant must also provide a calculation of the current reserves underlying its lease.\n\n              As noted in Gulf Land Co. v. Atlantic Refining Co., 131 S.W.2d 73, 80 (Tex. 1939):\n\n              It is the law that every owner or lessee of land is entitled to a fair chance to recover\n              the oil and gas in or under his land, or their equivalents in kind. Any denial of such\n              fair chance would be 'confiscation' within the meaning of Rule 37 and the Rule of\n              May 29th.\n\n              Encore presented volumetric evidence based on its interpretation of the geology and reservoir\n      structure, determinations of net pay from .digital analysis of a cross-section, of well logs, and its phi\n      h isopach map derived from the structural interpretation and the log analyses to estimate that, at the\n      very least, approximately 1.336 Bcf of recoverable natural gas was present beneath its Vada Bean\n      Lease at original conditions. Due to the low permeability in the Ozona (Canyon Sand). Field, the\n      estimated recoverable reserves at original conditions, less the total cumulative recovery from the\n      Vada Bean No. 1 well, is a sufficient measure to determine the current recoverable reserves\n      underlying the Vada Bean Lease. Additionally, maps depicting the estimated drainage area of the\n      wells on and offsetting the Vada Bean Lease establish that the northernmost 23.30 acres in the 63.30\n      acre tract have not been affected by any existing well.\n\n             Encore's decline curve analysis for its existing Vada Bean No. 1 well shows that the\n      estimated cumulative recovery from that well will only be .972 Bcf, leaving a remainder of at least\n      .365 Bcf of current recoverable reserves which will not be recovered by its existing well.\n      Accordingly, this evidence satisfies the first element for an exception to prevent confiscation.\n\n              The examiners specifically note that while Encore's phi h value for its Vada Bean No. 1 Well\n      may be higher than other wells in the field, the production history for this well supports its\n      interpretation. Devon's proposed correction to the phi h value for the Vada Bean No. 1 Well would\n      place it at or below the same capability as several wells drilled by Devon as direct offsets to\n      Encore's Vada Bean Lease which are not reporting production capability at or near the reported\n      production from the Vada Bean No. 1 Well. The examiners therefore believe that, while Encore's\n      estimated phi h value for the Vada Bean No. 1 Well may be high in relation to the nearby offset\n      wells, the empirical production data supports a higher value compared to the well's nearest\n      neighbors.\n\n             Encore also presented evidence to establish that the proposed location is reasonable. The\n      proposed well is located roughly equidistant from the lease lines on the narrow rectangular tract.\n\n\n\n268\n\f      RULE 37 CASE No. 0240684                                                                        Page 6\n\n      Additionally, maps depicting the drainage pattern from the existing wells, including the Vada Bean\n      No. 1, show that the proposed well will recover reserves from the northern portion of its lease which\n      will not be recovered from any other existing well. This evidence satisfies the second element\n      necessary to support an application for an exception to prevent confiscation. Accordingly, it is the\n      examiner's recommendation that Encore's application be approved on this basis.\n\n                                                 CONCLUSION\n\n              Encore is entitled to an exception to Rule 37 to prevent confiscation of natural gas\n      underlying its Vada Bean Lease in the Ozona (Canyon Sand) Field. Accordingly, the application\n      for an exception to Rule 37 should be granted.\n\n             Based on the record in this Docket,. the examiners recommend adoption of the following\n      Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.\n\n                                              FINDINGS OF FACT\n\n      1.     Encore Operating, L.P. (\"Applicant\" or \"Encore\") seeks an exception to Statewide Rule 37\n             to drill Well No. 2 on the Vada Bean Lease in the Ozona (Canyon Sand) Field, Crockett\n             County. Encore appeared at the hearing and presented evidence in support of its application.\n\n      2.     Encore's application is protested by Devon Energy Production, L.P., the operator of an\n             offsetting tract to the east of the Vada Bean Lease. Devon appeared at the hearing and\n             presented evidence in protest of Encore's application..\n\n      3.     The Vada Bean Lease is a narrow rectangular shaped 63.30 acre tract with no locations\n             regular to lease line spacing requireinents in the Ozona (Canyon Sand) Field due to the\n             configuration of the lease. The proposed well will be located 275 feet from the western lease\n             line and 254 feet from the eastern lease line. The proposed well is regular to all other lease\n             line boundaries.\n\n      4.     The Ozona (Canyon Sand) Field is subject to spacing requirements of 467 feet minimum\n             distance to the nearest lease line and 1200 feet minimum distance between wells for oil wells\n             and 660 feet minimum distance to the nearest lease line and 933 feet minimum distance\n             between wells for gas wells.\n\n      5.     Encore's Vada Bean No. 1 Well will not recover its fair share of current recoverable reserves\n             in the Ozona (Canyon Sand) Field currently underlying its Vada Bean Lease.\n\n             a.

(\"Candleridge\" or \"applicant\") seeks an exception to Statewide Rule\n      37 to drill its proposed Well No. 1 on the Sanders-Hodge \"A\" Unit for the Levelland Field. The\n      application is protested by Texaco E&P, Inc., (\"Texaco\" or \"protestant\"). The Levelland field rules\n      mandate spacing of 440 feet from unit lines and 880 feet between wells, with 42.5 acre regular units\n      and optional units of 21.25 acres.\n\n              The applied-for location is regular as to between-well spacing but is only 100 feet from the\n      nearest unit line. Accordingly, an exception to the Levelland Field Rules pursuant to Statewide Rule\n      37 is necessary. The Sanders-Hodge \"A\" Unit contains 21.25 contiguous acres and the proposed\n      well will be the only well on the unit producing from the Levelland Field.\n\n             The hearing in this docket on May 3, 1996, was consolidated with Rule 37 Case No.\n      0211519, which was the application of Texaco for an exception to rule 37 for its Ira P. DeLoache\n      Lease Well No. 85 in the Levelland Field. Candleridge protested Texaco's application but was\n      deemed to be unaffected based on the evidence presented at the hearing. Rule 37 Case 0211519 was\n      approved administratively on May 20, 1996.\n\n\n                                     UNCONTROVERTED EVIDENCE\n\n              The relative locations of the wells proposed by Texaco and Candleridge and the nearby\n      existing wells are illustrated on Exhibit A to this Proposal for Decision. Exhibit A is a portion of\n      Candleridge's Exhibit 1 annotated to highlight the location of Texaco's applied-for Well No. 85 and\n      Candleridge's applied-for Well No. 1.\n\n              Candleridge operates six small leases on the northern end of the very large Levelland Field.\n      Texaco operates much larger leases, including the Ira P. DeLoache Lease, adjacent and to the\n      southwest of Candleridge's acreage. The Ira P. DeLoache lease has 45 producing wells and 32\n      injection wells. Immediately to the east of the Ira P. DeLoache Lease is Texaco's Montgomery\n      Estate-Davies Lease which has 73 producing wells and 48 injection wells. The injection pattern on\n      Texaco's two leases is approximately a forty acre line drive wherein rows of injection wells alternate\n      with rows of producing wells. Texaco's application for its Ira P. Deloache Well No. 85 required a\n      Rule 37 exception because the proposed well was closer than 440' to Texaco's Montgomery Estate-\n      Davies Lease. Well 85 needed to be placed 175' from the Montgomery Estate-Davies Lease in order\n      to complete Texaco's pattern flood.\n\n             The productive San Andres reservoir is porous and permeable and Texaco has been\n      successfully water flooding the DeLoache Lease for some time. Prior to the administrative grant of\n      Texaco's Rule 37 exception for Well No. 85, Texaco presented evidence that when it drilled two\n      previous producing wells to fill in holes in the waterflood pattern, those wells had no effect on the\n      production of their direct offset producing wells. The direct offset producing wells are only 900 -\n      1000' away from the infill producing wells. Texaco testified that its proposed Well No. 85 \"would\n\n\n273\n\f      Proposal for Decision\n                                                                             •                       Page 3\n      Rule 37 Case No. 0211820\n\n      have no impact of its two immediate offsets.\" Texaco's witnesses testified that Well No. 85 will\n      recover 129,000 BO from a 45' thick pay section and that this \"129,000 BO ...would not be recovered\n      by any other well due to the nature of the flood.\"\n\n             Candleridge's property is approximately 2900' north of Well No. 85 and there are four\n      producing wells between the proposed location of Texaco's proposed Well No. 85 and Candleridge's\n      acreage. In 1994, Candleridge's predecessor, S.K. Rogers Oil, converted four producing wells, the\n      Hodge Estate No. 2, the Hodge \"A\" No. 1-A, and the Sanders Nos. 2 and 4 to injection.\n\n\n                     APPLICANT CANDLERIDGE'S EVIDENCE AND POSITION\n\n             Candleridge protested Texaco's Rule 37 application after receiving notice as an offset\n      operator. Candleridge did not present evidence to contradict Texaco's case but took the position that\n      the Commission should not grant Texaco's Rule 37 application without granting the application of\n      Candleridge:for a Rule 37. The examiners ruled on May 20, 1996, that Candleridge was unaffected\n      by Texaco's proposed Well No. 85 and Candleridge did not contest the examiners' ruling.\n\n              Candleridge's injection wells are located to compliment Texaco's waterflood pattern as\n      Candleridge hoped to make a co-operative lease-line waterflood arrangement with Texaco.\n      Candleridge is now receiving response to its waterflood in its producing wells but, due to the absence\n      of a co-operative waterflood agreement with Texaco, Candleridge is losing a large part of the benefit\n      of the waterflood. The injection wells are pushing a substantial volume of oil off Candleridge's\n      leases and onto Texaco's property.\n\n              Two of Candleridge's injection wells, the Sanders No. 2 and Hodge \"A\" No. 1A, are located\n      2200 feet apart and 440 feet north of the common lease line with Texaco. The square formed by\n      lines between the two wells and the lease line covers about 22 acres. If the proposed well is not\n      drilled any remaining oil within this square will be pushed to Texaco's acreage and will not be\n      recovered by Candleridge.\n\n              Texaco's Well Nos. 25 and 27 are producing wells just to the south of the common lease line\n      with Candleridge. They are on the pattern lines of Texaco's injection wells. Candleridge's injection\n      wells are on the same pattern lines and extend the pattern established by Texaco's wells. Candleridge\n      anticipated that Texaco would convert these two producing wells to injection which would, complete\n      the pattern, facilitate the waterflood and thereby protect correlative rights across the lease line.\n      Candleridge offered Texaco the same type of cooperative development agreement that Texaco has\n      with its southern boundary offset operator but Texaco declined the offer. Candleridge claims that\n      oil under the entire 72 acres between 440' and the lease line of its property cannot be recovered\n      without a co-operative lease line waterflood pattern or lease line producing wells.\n\n             Candleridge assumed the same reservoir parameters as Texaco in its original application with\n      the exception of reservoir thickness. Texaco assumed a reservoir thickness of 45 feet around its\n      proposed No. 85, while Candleridge has assumed only 18 feet of net pay around its proposed well.\n      Candleridge then calculated that about 70,000 barrels of oil were recoverable from the square\n\n\n274\n\f      Proposal for Decision\n                                   i                                          •                       Page 4\n      Rule 37 Case No. 0211820\n\n      between the injection wells and the lease lines by both primary and secondary efforts. The water\n      injected into the Candleridge Sanders No. 2 and Hodge \"A\" No. 1A has already swept the oil from\n      about 8.9 of the acres in the square, which leaves 42,000 (70,000 - 28,000) barrels of recoverable\n      oil in this square that Candleridge believes only its proposed Sanders-Hodge \"A\" Unit No. 1 can\n      recover.\n\n             Candleridge believes that the oil which its injection wells are sweeping off its lease will be\n      only partially recovered by Texaco's wells. About half of the oil swept off the lease will be\n      unrecovered by either party unless the injection pattern is completed.\n\n              Texaco and the predecessor operator to Candleridge, S.K. Rogers had been discussing a co-\n      operative lease-line injection program but Texaco had indicated in late 1993 that it would wait to\n      decide on the agreement. Rogers made another offer for a lease-line injection agreement to Texaco\n      by a letter written in January of 1995. There is no evidence of a written response from Texaco.\n\n\n                       PROTESTANT TEXACO'S EVIDENCE AND POSITION\n\n              If Candleridge's proposed location is drilled only 100 feet• from Texaco's lease, and the\n      producing well has an assumed square drainage area of 21.25 acres, then about 8 of those acres\n      would be under lease to Texaco. According to Texaco, Candleridge could recover some of the\n      reserves being pushed by the Candleridge's two injection wells by drilling in between the two\n      injection wells at a distance of 440 feet from Texaco's lease. This location would be regular with\n      respect to lease lines and Texaco agreed to waive any objection to a Rule 37 exception based on\n      between well spacing.\n\n              Texaco also pointed out that Candleridge chose to convert to injection two of its producing\n      wells that are closest to Texaco's leases. Texaco's witnesses testified that if Texaco had been in\n      Candleridge's position and not had a co-operative lease-line agreement in writing, it would have\n      protected its lease-line rather than maintaining the same waterflood pattern as an offset operator.\n      Texaco's witnesses also testified that if they were protecting a waterflood lease from confiscation\n      they would have drilled an additional five wells and used a five-spot injection pattern which\n      maintained lease-line producing wells.\n\n\n                                           EXAMINERS' OPINION\n\n              Exceptions to Statewide Rule 37 may be granted to prevent waste or to protect correlative\n      rights/prevent confiscation. An applicant seeking an exception to Rule 37 based on waste must\n      establish three elements: 1) that unusual conditions, different from conditions in adjacent parts of\n      the field, exist under the tract for which the exception is sought; 2) that, as a result of these\n      conditions, hydrocarbons will be recovered by the well for which a permit is sought that would not\n      be recovered by any existing well or by additional wells drilled at regular locations; and, 3) that the\n      volume of otherwise unrecoverable hydrocarbons is substantial. The evidence of both parties\n      indicates that a substantial volume of oil being swept by Candleridge's injection wells cannot be\n\n\n275\n\f      Proposal for Decision\n                                  •                                            •                        Page 5\n      Rule 37 Case No. 0211820\n\n      recovered by any regularly located well. Applicant Candleridge did not, however, present any\n      evidence of an unusual condition which would authorize granting an exception based on waste.\n\n             To obtain an exception to Statewide Rule 37 to protect correlative rights, the applicant must\n      show that: 1) It is not possible for the applicant to recover its fair share of minerals under its tract\n      from regular locations; and, 2) that the proposed irregular location is reasonable. Because\n      Candleridge's Sanders-Hodge \"A\" Unit was formed after field rules were established, the size and\n      shape of the pooled unit are not being considered in determining whether confiscation is occurring.\n      See Tex. R.R. Comm'n, 16 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 3.37(g)(1) (West Jan. 1, 1996) [Statewide rule\n      37(g)(1)].\n\n              Candleridge's evidence that, unless the application is granted, Candleridge's injection wells\n      will sweep an additional 42,000 barrels of oil off of tracts operated by Candleridge and onto Texaco's\n      lease was unrefuted. Texaco has deviated from its established line-drive pattern and has not\n      converted any of its producing wells along its common lease-lines with Candleridge to injection.\n      Texaco's six producing \"border guard\" wells along the lease-lines between Candleridge and Texaco\n      insure that Texaco's injection wells will not sweep any significant volume of oil from Texaco's leases\n      onto Candleridge's leases. A well located at a regular location 440 feet from lease-lines would be\n      directly between the two injection wells and the same distance from the Texaco lease-line as the two\n      injection wells and, as a result, would only recover a small fraction of the oil being swept onto\n      Texaco's lease.\n\n              The proposed location is reasonable. Texaco's \"border guard\" producing wells will capture\n      the secondary. oil being swept by Texaco's injection wells before it reaches Candleridge's leases\n      and/or the proposed well location. Further, Texaco's evidence regarding its own Rule 37 application\n      suggests that a well at the location proposed by Candleridge will not interfere with the production\n      of Texaco's existing wells and will recover oil that cannot be recovered by existing Texaco wells.\n      Texaco's witnesses testified that all or the great majority of the production to be recovered by\n      Texaco's applied-for Well No. 85 would not be recovered by any other well. The producing wells\n      nearest Well No. 85 are only about 900 feet from Well 85 yet Texaco expects the production from\n      these wells to be unaffected by Well No. 85. Candleridge's applied-for location is more then 900 feet\n      from the nearest Texaco prodUcing wells. Texaco's evidence that its well will recover oil that would\n      not be recovered by any adjacent producing well indicates that the applied-for Candleridge well on\n      the adjacent lease will similarly recover oil that would not be recovered by any existing well.\n\n              Texaco's own evidence indicates that a well at the location proposed by Candleridge will\n      recover little, if any, oil from Texaco's tract. Conversely, it is undisputed that a well at the applied-\n      for location would recover a substantial volume of \"secondary\" oil from the Candleridge leases that\n      would otherwise be swept off the leases.\n\n             The examiners recommend adoption of the following proposed findings of fact and\n      conclusions of law:\n\n\n\n\n276\n\f      Proposal for Decision\n      Rule 37 Case No. 0211820\n                               •                                           •                        Page 6\n\n\n                                           FINDINGS OF FACT\n\n      1.    Notice of the hearing was given at least 10 days prior to the hearing to all designated\n            operators, lessees of record for tracts that have no designated operator, and owners of record'\n            of unleased mineral interests for each adjacent tract and each tract nearer to the well than the\n            prescribed minimum lease-line spacing distance.\n\n      2.    Candleridge Oil, Inc., (\"applicant\") has applied on Form W-1 for a permit to drill Well No.\n            1 on the Sanders-Hodge \"A\" Unit. Applicant proposes to drill its well at a location 100 feet\n            from the south line and 962 feet from the east line of the unit, and -0- feet from the east line\n            and 100 feet from the south line of the Reeves CSL, Lge 78, Lab 9 Survey (A-201).\n            Applicant has applied to drill its proposed well for the Levelland Field.\n\n      3.    The Levelland Field has field rules requiring spacing of 440 feet from unit lines and 880 feet\n            between wells. The field rules further specify a density pattern of 42.5 acres per well with\n            options of 21.25 acres per well.\n\n      4.    Applicant's Sanders-Hodge \"A\" Unit is a tract containing 21.25 acres.\n\n      5.    The volume of remaining primary recoverable reserves in the Levelland Field under the\n            applicant's Sanders-Hodge \"A\" Unit and the surrounding tracts is insignificant.\n\n      6.    There is a line pattern of injection and producing wells that extends•from the adjoining lease\n            onto applicant's Sanders-Hodge \"A\" Unit.\n\n      7.    Applicant's existing injection wells in the line pattern will sweep approximately 42,000\n            barrels of oil off of applicant's leases.\n\n      8.    The injection wells on tracts adjacent to applicant's Sanders-Hodge \"A\" Unit will not sweep\n            oil from other tracts onto the leases operated by applicant.\n\n      9.    A well at the applied-for location will recover approximately 42,000 barrels of oil which no\n            existing Candleridge well could recover.\n\n      10.   A well a regular distance from the lease-line between the applicant's leases and the adjoining\n            leases operated by Texaco would recover substantially less than 42,000 barrels of oil.\n\n      11.   A well at the applied-for location will not interfere with existing producing wells on adjacent\n            leases operated by protestant Texaco.\n\n\n                                        CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\n      1.    Proper notice of hearing was timely given to all persons legally entitled to notice.\n\n\n\n277\n\f      Proposal for Decision                                                                            Page 7\n      Rule 37 Case No. 0211820\n\n      2.          All things have occurred or have been done that are necessary to give the Commission\n                  jurisdiction to decide this matter.\n\n      3.         An exception pursuant to Statewide Rule 37 to the Levelland Field rules regarding well\n                 spacing is necessary to permit drilling the applied-for well.\n\n      4.         Approval of the requested permit to drill a well at the proposed location is necessary to give\n                 the owners of the Sanders-Hodge \"A\" Unit a reasonable opportunity to recover their fair\n                 share of oil underlying their leases from the Levelland Field.\n\n      5.         The applied-for location is reasonable.\n\n      6.         An exception to Statewide Rule 37 is necessary to prevent confiscation of oil from the\n                 Levelland Field currently in place under the Sanders-Hodge \"A\" Unit.\n\n\n                                                 RECOMMENDATION\n\n             The examiners recommend that the subject application be approved in accordance with the\n      attached final order.\n\n                                                               Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n\n\n                            Colin K.

(\"Applicant\" or \"Chesapeake\") seeks an exception to Statewide\n      Rule 37 to drill Well No. 4 on the Green Gas Unit Lease, Oak Hill (Cotton Valley) Field. The Green\n      Gas Unit is an irregularly shaped 683 acre pooled unit which includes land owned by the State of\n      Texas and private lands. The 307.8 acres owned by the state is an approximately 10 mile long\n      section of the Sabine River. The remaining 375.2 acres are privately owned tracts. This\n      configuration is very atypical. A square 640 acre unit is one mile wide, but this unit is over 10 miles\n      wide. The proposed well would be the fourth well on the unit. Chesapeake has also requested an\n      exception to the maximum diagonal requirement for the proposed proration unit associated with the\n      Green No. 4 well. The application is protested by Anadarko E & P Company, L.P. (\"Anadarko\"),\n      the offset operator on both sides of the river tract where the proposed well is located.\n\n              The Oak Hill (Cotton Valley) Field is subject to spacing requirements of 467 feet minimum\n      distance to the nearest lease line and 1200 feet minimum distance between wells. The proposed\n      bottom hole location is in the center of the river tract, 75 feet from the offsetting property on both\n      sides. A copy of the plat filed with Applicant's W-1 (Application for Permit to Drill, Deepen, Plug\n      Back or Re-Enter) is attached for reference.\n\n               The maximum diagonal requirement for the Oak Hill (Cotton Valley) Field is 5500 feet for\n      160 acre units, 3250 feet for 80 acre units, and 2100 feet for 40 acre units. Chesapeake proposes two\n      alternative proration units for its Green No. 4 Well. The first unit includes176 acres with a diagonal\n      of approximately 58,000 feet. This lengthy diagonal is required because the proposed unit assigns\n      a portion of the entire length of the Sabine River tract to the Green No. 4 Well. Alternatively,\n      Chesapeake proposes a 40 acre proration unit with a diagonal of approximately 15,815 feet. The\n      40 acre proration unit assigns a portion of the river tract from the general vicinity of the proposed\n      well to the easternmost terminus of the river tract, approximately 3 miles from the proposed location.\n\n                                   APPLICANT'S POSITION AND EVIDENCE\n\n              The Oak Hill (Cotton Valley) Field is productive from the lower Taylor sand, a uniform\n      marine bar deposit, and from the Upper Cotton Valley, a group of independent sand lenses formed\n      in a fluvial depositional environment. Both formations are recognized as tight and require fracture\n      stimulation of the producing interval.\n\n              The Taylor sand is present throughout the Green Gas Unit. Chesapeake's structural cross\n      section of wells over the entire area shows that the Taylor sand thins and becomes more water\n      saturated on an east to west trend. The Upper Cotton Valley is described as \"hit and miss\" and does\n      not exhibit a reliable trend within the Green Gas Unit.\n\n\n\n\n281\n\f      Rule 37 Case No. 0245869                                                                        Page 3\n      Proposal for Decision\n\n             The Oak Hill (Cotton Valley) Field underlies the entire unit as shown by Chesapeake's net\n      pay and isopach maps for the area. However, Chesapeake contends the Cotton Valley is thicker and\n      less water saturated in the eastern portion of the Green Gas Unit. Chesapeake's maps and\n      volumetric analysis of the Green Gas Unit reflect the entire Cotton Valley interval.\n\n             Chesapeake currently operates three wells on the Green Gas Unit. The Green Gas Unit No.\n      1 was completed in December 1995 on an 80 acre pooled unit comprised of 62.8 acres of the State's\n      Sabine River lands and 17.2 acres of private property adjacent to the river. The Green No. 1 Well\n      has produced over 1 Bcf since it was completed.\n\n              The Green No. 2 and No. 3 wells were drilled and completed in January 2006. Performance\n      from both of these wells has been marginal. Cumulative production from the Green No. 2 is .091\n      Bcf while the Green No. 3 is .18 Bcf. These two wells were drilled under an amended unit\n      agreement which increased the overall size of the unit to its present 683 acres by adding an\n      additional 358 acres of privately owned land and 245 acres of the State's Sabine River lands.\n      Additionally, the proration units for the Green No. 1, Green No. 2 and Green No. 3 were drawn so\n      that each well included a portion of the complete 10 mile Sabine River lands, and a portion of the\n      privately held land. Exceptions to the maximum diagonal requirements were approved\n      administratively for these three wells.\n\n              The proposed Green No. 4 well would be located on a portion of the Sabine River acreage\n      which was originally assigned to the Green No. 1 well. Chesapeake claims that the Green.No. 4 is\n      necessary to prevent confiscation as the three existing wells will not recover a significant portion\n      of the remaining recoverable natural gas underlying under the Green Gas Unit. As of the hearing\n      date, the three existing wells cumulative production was 1.274 Bcf. The estimated ultimate recovery\n      from the 3 existing wells is 1A68 Bcf of natural gas. Chesapeake's volumetric analysis shows 62.1\n      Bcf in currently recoverable reserves underlying the entire Green Gas Unit, and 23 Bcf underlying\n      the easternmost 160 acres of the State's river lands. Chesapeake therefore urges that an exception\n      is necessary because there are significant reserves which will not be recovered by the existing wells.\n\n               Chesapeake admits regular locations exist on the unit. However, it claims a well drilled at\n      a regular location, while productive, would not be economic to drill. The nearest offset well to the\n      portion.of the unit with regular locations is the Gibson \"A\" No. 2 Well. The Gibson \"A\" No. 2 Well\n      first reported production in October 2007. Through April 2008, the cumulative production from the\n      well is .094 Bcf. Chesapeake's EUR for the well ranges between .16 and .22 Bcf based only on the\n      current completion in the Taylor sand. Chesapeake claims that with this EUR, the Gibson \"A\" No.\n      2 Well will never be profitable using current economic projections. Chesapeake therefore asserts\n      that no reasonable regular locations exist on the Green Gas Unit.\n\n               Chesapeake also relies on maps depicting the drainage patterns of the existing wells as\n      estimated by Anadarko. Based on these maps, Chesapeake asserts that some of the acreage in the\n      river tract is being drained by offsetting wells. Chesapeake urges it therefore needs the well at the\n      proposed location to protect its correlative rights.\n\n\n\n282\n\f      Rule 37 Case No. 0245869                                                                           Page 4\n      Proposal for Decision\n\n              Chespeake also requests an exception to the maximum diagonal requirement in the field.\n      Chesapeake proposes that the Green No. 4 well further split the Sabine River lands so that a portion\n      is assigned to all four wells. This results in several \"ribbons\" necessary to create four proration units\n      which will include all of the State's river acreage. Each ribbon is approximately 10 miles in length.\n      Alternatively, Chesapeake requests that the acreage for the Green No. 1 well be split with the Green\n      No. 4 well with exceptions to the maximum diagonal requirement consistent with the alternative\n      proposed 160 acre unit.\n\n                                   PROTESTANT'S POSITION AND EVIDENCE\n\n              Anadarko contends that Chesapeake failed to submit the required evidence to support a well\n      at the exception location because there are multiple regular locations available on the 683 acre Green\n      Gas Unit. It is undisputed that regular locations on the Green Gas Unit will encounter both the\n      Taylor and Upper Cotton Valley sands. While Chesapeake argues its proposed location is more\n      reasonable due to the economic risk associated with developing the regular locations, Anadarko\n      asserts that the proper standard for supporting an exception to prevent confiscation is whether the\n      exception is necessary. Anadarko further notes that no prior Commission case has granted an\n      exception to spacing rules on the basis of economic risk alone. Anadarko urges that until\n      Chesapeake has developed its regular locations that it cannot seek exception locations on the basis\n      of donfiscation.\n\n               Anadarko also questions the technical basis for Chesapeake's confiscation case. Anadarko\n      first argued that Chesapeake's central premise of an east-west trend in the Oak Hill (Cotton Valley)\n      Field was based on a flawed analysis. Anadarko claims that Chesapeake inappropriately evaluated\n      the Oak Hill (Cotton Valley) Field in its hydrocarbon pore volume and net pay maps by aggregating\n      the Upper Cotton Valley sand with the Taylor sand in its analysis. The Taylor sand is a structural\n      trap while the Upper Cotton Valley is a series of laterally discontinuous sands which form\n      stratigraphic traps. Stratigraphic traps are not likely to be affected by the syncline Chesapeake posits\n      for the formation. Further, published studies of the Oak Hill (Cotton Valley) Field relied on by both\n      parties specifically caution against using the Upper Cotton Valley as a predictive tool of estimated\n      ultimate recovery (EUR) trends. Anadarko therefore urges that Chesapeake's maps are fatally\n      flawed as the aggregate values do not establish a trend for all of the contributing sands and do not\n      accurately reflect recoverable reserves.\n\n              Anadarko also challenges Chesapeake's assertion that the Gibson \"A\" No. 2 Well will never\n      be profitable using current economic projections. Anadarko's own economic analysis predicts that\n      the Gibson \"A\" No. 2 Well will be economic currently; and will be even more profitable if the well\n      is later completed in the Upper Cotton Valley sand. Anadarko also notes that with the\n      unpredictability of Upper Cotton Valley production in the field, it is inappropriate to rule out\n      potential reserves from that formation contributing to production at the regular locations on the\n      Green Gas Unit.\n\n\n\n\n283\n\f      Rule 37 Case No. 0245869                                                                         Page 5\n      Proposal for Decision\n\n              Finally, Anadarko urges the additional acreage added to the Green Gas Unit was a deliberate\n      attempt to support a drilling program for 16 additional wells on the easternmost river acreage\n      without obtaining density exceptions. Anadarko notes that 358 acres were leased from the Eastman\n      Chemical Company underlying a large facility it operates and added to the Green Gas Unit with\n      additional State lands in the Sabine River. However, the Eastman lease agreements include\n      covenants prohibiting the use of the surface or subsurface for development of the underlying mineral\n      estate. Anadarko argues that the restrictions in the lease are an effective moratorium on the\n      development of the Eastman acreage. It believes the only purpose of agreeing to such restrictions\n      was to support drilling at greater density along the river acreage through gerrymandering the\n      proration units to encompass the entire unit. Anadarko admits the proration units technically comply\n      with Commission rules if a maximum diagonal exception is obtained. However, Anadarko argues\n      that this process is designed to circumvent Commission's rules regarding density and double\n      assignment of acreage.\n\n                                             EXAMINERS' OPINION\n\n              Chesapeake contends it is entitled to an exception at the proposed location for its Green No.\n      4 Well. Chesapeake argues that the proposed well is necessary to prevent confiscation on the full\n      683 acre unit. Alternatively, Chesapeake argues that the proposed well is necessary to prevent\n      confiscation on the easternmost 160 acres of the unit. Finally, Chesapeake seeks an exception to the\n      maximum diagonal requirement in order to assign a portion of the Sabine river acreage and the\n      privately held acreage to each of its 4 wells on the 683. acre unit.\n\n               The examiners recommend that Chesapeake's application be denied because Chesapeake did\n      not provide reliable evidence to support an exception at th6 proposed. location. Additionally,\n      Chesapeake cannot subdivide the 683 acre unit identified in its drilling permit application to argue\n      that it is entitled to a well on a portion of the unit.\n\n      Exceptions to Prevent Confiscation\n\n              To establish entitlement to an exception to Rule 37 to prevent confiscation, an applicant must\n      show that absent the applied-for well, it will be denied a reasonable opportunity to recover its fair\n      share of hydrocarbons currently in place under the lease, or its equivalent in kind. The applicant\n      must satisfy a two pronged test: 1) the applicant must show that it will not be afforded a reasonable\n      opportunity to recover its fair share of hydrocarbons currently in place by drilling wells at regular\n      locations; and 2) the applicant must show that the proposed irregular location is reasonable.\n\n              It is the basic right of every landowner or lessee to a fair and reasonable chance to recover\n      the oil and gas under his property as recognized by the Texas Supreme Court in Gulf Land Co. v.\n      Atlantic Refining Co., 131 S.W.2d 73, 80 (Tex. 1939). Denial of that fair chance is confiscation\n      within the meaning of Rule 37. Id. Because an application cannot seek redress for past drainage,\n      an applicant must provide evidence that it will not be afforded an opportunity to recover the reserves\n      currently in place under its lease - this is its \"fair share\".\n\n\n\n\n284\n\f      Rule 37 Case No. 0245869                                                                          Page 6\n      Proposal for Decision\n\n      Chesapeake Failed to Establish the Necessity for an Exception to Prevent Confiscation.\n\n              Chesapeake failed to establish that it is entitled to a well at the proposed location to prevent\n      confiscation on the Green Gas Unit. Chesapeake submitted a volumetric estimate of 62.1 Bcf in\n      current recoverable reserves underlying the entire 683 acre Green Gas Unit. Chesapeake argues its\n      existing three wells will only recover 1.5 Bcf and that the proposed well is therefore necessary to\n      give it an opportunity to recover its fair share of reserves. As discussed below, Chesapeake's\n      volumetric analysis is flawed and does not provide a reliable estimate of the remaining reserves\n      underlying the unit.\n\n              Chesapeake's estimates of the current recoverable reserves underlying the full 683 acre unit\n      are unreliable because it inappropriately consolidated the Upper Cotton Valley and Taylor when\n      analyzing the remaining reserves. Because each interval has different characteristics, they must be\n      analyzed separately. Chesapeake's own geologist confirmed this when describing the characteristics\n      of the Upper Cotton Valley interval as a \"hit or miss\" play.\n\n               Chesapeake's analysis lumped the two intervals together and then mapped the cumulative\n      total to provide the basis for the volumetric analysis. The proper methodology here would have been\n      to separately map each interval, perform separate volumetric analyses and then add the volumetric\n      results together to arrive at an accurate and reliable estimate of the remaining recoverable reserves.\n      Because the proper methodology was not , followed, it is not reliable evidence to support an\n      exception based on confiscation. In the absence of reliable volumetrics, there are insufficient facts\n      upon which to base Chesapeake's application for an exception based on confiscation.\n\n              The examiners also question the reliability of Chesapeake's study based on the extrapolation\n      of estimated reserves from the eastern 160 acres to the full 10 mile wide 683 acre Green Gas Unit.\n      Normally, the issue of reservoir characteristics would not be an issue on a single pooled unit.\n      However, the issue is relevant here to the unusual configuration of a 10 mile wide unit.\n\n               It is unquestioned that there has been heavy development in the Oak Hill (Cotton Valley)\n      Field in the easternmost area of the Green Gas Unit. However, there have been very few wells\n      drilled in the western area. Further, Chesapeake argues' that the closest well drilled to the regular\n      locations on the Green Gas Unit, the Gibson \"A\" No. 2 Well, will only be a marginal well with .2\n      Bcf of production. The absence of well control in the western portion of the unit, coupled with the\n      limited expected performance of the Gibson \"A\" No. 2 well indicate that Chesapeake's estimates\n      of over 60 Bcf of recoverable reserves are speculative at best.\n\n               Chesapeake's witnesses claim they need the applied-for irregular location to allow them to\n      have a commercial well. However, neither Chesapeake nor any other operator is guaranteed a well\n      that meets its self-imposed criteria for economic viability - each mineral interest owner is entitled\n      to a fair and equal opportunity to recover its fair share of the hydrocarbons under its tract. Economic\n      requirements: 1) vary from company to company (applicant to applicant); 2) are not evenly applied;\n      and, 3) are not specific to the property rights on a given tract. An operator's economic requirements\n\n\n\n285\n\f      Rule 37 Case No. 0245869                                                                                                Page 7\n      Proposal for Decision\n\n      therefore cannot be the basis for granting an exception to Statewide Rule 37 to protect correlative\n      rights. See Rule 37 Case No. 0206334: Application of Enron Oil & Gas Company for an exception\n      to Statewide Rule 37 to Drill Its No. 17 Well, Frank Reed 117 Lease, Sawyer (Canyon) Field, Sutton\n      County, Texas.\n\n             Rule 37 is equally applicable to all operators. While the non-discriminatory application of\n      Commission spacing rules may result in some economic loss by an operator, this loss does not\n      amount to legal confiscation. See Railroad Commission v. Manziel, 361 S.W.2d 560, 565 (Tex.\n      1962); Railroad Commission v. Fain, 161 S.W.2d 498, 500 (Tex. Civ. App. -- Austin 1942, writ\n      dism'd w.o.in.). The determination of what is a fair opportunity must be based on the relationship\n      between potential drilisite locations and the currently recoverable reserves' under a tract, not on\n      economic viability guidelines that each operator selects for itself.\n\n              Chesapeake's economic assessment that regular wells would not be commercial is not\n      reliable evidence for ruling out the other regular locations on the Green Gas Unit. The claim 'that\n      it would not be economic for Chesapeake to drill a regular well is not sufficient to establish that an.\n      exception at the proposed location is necessary to afford it a reasonable opportunity to recover the\n      reserves in the Green Gas Unit. Therefore, the examiners do not believe that this argument supports\n      Chesapeake's request for a well at the proposed location.\n\n      Chesapeake cannot Legally Assert a Confiscation Exception on an Alternative 160 acre unit.\n\n              Chesapeake alternatively argued that it is entitled to a fourth well on the easternmost 160\n      acres to prevent confiscation. This argument should be rejected because Chesapeake has not applied\n      for a well at an exception location on a 160 acre unit, and cannot carve out a portion of its Green Gas\n      Unit for consideration of an exception based on confiscation.\n\n              When an operator voluntarily designates a pooled unit for the purpose of permitting wells\n      or for subsequent production, any application for additional wells on the designated pooled unit must\n      stand or fall on the basis of the existing unit. Chesapeake created the Green Gas Unit by pooling\n      several tracts together for the purpose of cooperative development of 683 acres. When it formed the\n      pooled unit, it assigned its one existing well, the Green No. 1 for production purposes. It then\n      permitted and drilled two additional wells on the 683 acre unit. The current application for a fourth\n      well therefore must be considered under the existing 683 acre pooled unit.\n\n              This is particularly relevant when considering the potential application of Statewide Rule.\n      38(d)(3).' The Commission Form P-12 (Certificate of Pooling Authority) filed with the permit\n      applications for the Green No. 2 and No. 3 wells, as well as the proposed Green No. 4 well identifies\n      7 tracts which are substandard under the field rules for the Oak Hill (Cotton Valley) Field.\n\n\n\n                 Statewide Rule 38(d)(3) requires Commission approval of the dissolution of a pooled unit where the pooled unit\n      includes any tract composed of substandard acreage in the field.\n\n\n\n\n286\n\f      Rule 37 Case No. 0245869                                                                      Page 8\n      Proposal for Decision\n\n\n\n              Chesapeake could potentially dissolve the existing pooled unit. After Commission approval\n      of the unit dissolution under Statewide Rule 38(d)(3), it could then create a new pooled unit on 160\n      acres. However, until the Commission approves dissolution of the Green Gas Unit, any application\n      for a new well must be evaluated on the basis of the 683 acre unit Chesapeake voluntarily identified\n      when it assigned the Green No. 1 well to the unit, and permitted and drilled the Green No. 2 and No.\n      3 wells. Accordingly, Chesapeake's alternative argument that it is entitled to a well on the\n      easternmost 160 acres of the Green Gas Unit is not a legally permissible basis to support an\n      exception to prevent confiscation.\n\n                                                CONCLUSION\n\n             Chesapeake failed to establish that is entitled to an exception to Rule 37 to prevent\n      confiscation of natural gas underlying the Green Gas Unit in the Oak Hill (Cotton Valley) Field.\n      Accordingly, the application for an exception to Rule 37 should be denied.\n\n             Based on the record in this Docket, the examiners recommend adoption of the following\n      Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.\n\n                                              FINDINGS OF FACT\n\n      1.      Chesapeake Operating, Inc. (\"Applicant\" or \"Chesapeake\") seeks an exception to Statewide\n              Rule 37 to drill Well No. 4 on the-Green Gas Unit Lease, Oak Hill (Cotton Valley) Field.\n              Chesapeake has also requested an exception to the maximum diagonal requirement for the\n              proposed proration unit associated with the Green No. 4 well.\"Chesapeake appeared at the\n              hearing and presented evidence in support of its application.\n\n      2.      The application is protested by Anadarko E & P Company, L.P. (\"Anadarko\"), the offset\n              operator on both sides of the river tract where the proposed well is-located. Anadarko also\n              appeared at the hearing.\n\n      3.      The Green Gas Unit is an irregularly shaped 683 acre pooled unit which includes land owned\n              by the State of Texas and private lands. The 307.8 acres owned by the state is an\n              approximately 10 mile long section of the Sabine River. The remaining 375.2 acres are\n              privately owned tracts. The proposed well would be the fourth' well on the unit.\n\n      4.      The Oak Hill (Cotton Valley) Field is subject to spacing requirements of 467 feet minimum\n              distance to the nearest lease line and 1200 feet minimum distance between wells. The\n              maximum diagonal requirement for the Oak Hill (Cotton Valley) Field is 5500 feet for 160\n              acre units, 3250 feet for 80 acre units, and 2100 feet for 40 acre units.\n\n      5.      The proposed bottom hole location is in the center of the river tract, 75 feet from the\n              offsetting property on both sides.\n\n\n\n287\n\f      Rule 37 Case No. 0245869                                                                       • Page 9\n      Proposal for Decision\n\n\n\n      6.     . Chesapeake proposes two alternative proration units for its Green No. 4 Well. The first unit\n               includesl76 acres with a diagonal of approximately 58,000 feet. This lengthy diagonal is\n               required because the proposed unit assigns a portion of the entire length of the Sabine River\n               tract to the Green No. 4 Well. Alternatively, Chesapeake proposes a 40 acre proration unit\n               with a diagonal of approximately 15,815 feet. The 40 acre proration unit assigns a portion\n               of the river tract from the general vicinity of the proposed well to the easternmost terminus\n               of the river tract, approximately 3 miles from the proposed location.\n\n      7.      Regular locations exist on the Green Gas Unit in the Oak Hill (Cotton Valley) Field.\n\n      8.      Chesapeake did not provide evidence establishing that regular locations on the Green Gas\n              unit would not afford it a reasonable opportunity to recover the reserves currently\n              underlying the subject lease in the Oak Hill (Cotton Valley) Field.\n\n      9.      Chesapeake did not provide reliable evidence of the estimated current recoverable reserves\n              underlying the Green Gas Unit.\n\n              a.      The Oak Hill (Cotton Valley)' Field is productive from the lower Taylor sand, a\n                      uniform marine bar deposit, and from the Upper Cotton Valley, a group of\n                      independent sand lenses formed in a fluvial depositional environment.\n\n              b.   • The Taylor sand is a structural trap while the Upper Cotton Valley is a series of\n                      laterally discontinuous sands which form stratigraphic traps.\n\n              c.      Both formations are recognized as tight and require fracture stimulation of the\n                      producing interval.\n\n              d.      The Upper Cotton Valley is described as \"hit and miss\" and does not exhibit a\n                      reliable trend within the Green Gas Unit:\n\n              e.      Chesapeake inappropriately evaluated the Oak Hill (Cotton Valley) Field in its\n                      hydrocarbon pore volume and net pay maps by aggregating the Upper Cotton Valley\n                      sand with the Taylor sand in its analysis.\n\n              f.      Published studies of the Oak Hill (Cotton Valley) Field relied on by both parties\n                      specifically caution against using the Upper Cotton Valley as a predictive tool of\n                      estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) trends.\n\n             g.       Chesapeake's analysis considered the two intervals together and then mapped the\n                      cumulative total to provide the basis for the volumetric analysis.\n\n\n\n\n288\n\f      Rule 37 Case No. 0245869                                                                        Page 10\n      Proposal for Decision\n\n                                             CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\n      1.

It is ray opinion that the Murphy -#1H. Herbst \"B\" Well is not an \"Offset well\" to\n\n      the Comstock #1.H. Lucas \"A\" Well, as that term is used in 'the industry] and in the oil and gas.\n\n      lease. An \"offset well\", as that term is used in the industry, is a. well drille4 as close as.possible to\n\n      the offending well in order 'to prevent or minimize drainage from -the feased premises by the,\n\n      offending well.\n\n              6.     • It is my understanding that there is no dispute that the gioveming Oil, Gas, and\n\n      Mineral Leases are in effect and contain a Paragraph 25 with the \"offset 4vell provision\", that the\n\n      Comstock well was permitted and actually drilled closer than the 467' buffer provided by the\n\n      offset :Well provision, and that. Murphy is relying upon the Herbst \"B\" OH well to satisfy the\n\n      remedies .reqUired by the lease when. a well is drilled within. 467 feet of the leased premises.\n\n\n\n\n                                                         2\n                                                                                                       208321.9:1\n\n\n\n239\n\f              7.\n                                  •                                         •\n                      Mr. McBeath's affidavit has two arguments to support his opinion that the\n\n       Murphy CH Herbst \"B\" Well satisfies Murphy's obligations under Paragraph 25 of the Herbst\n\n       leases: First, Mr. McBeath makes a distinction between the term. \"offset Well\" and the conjecture\n\n      of a more specifically used term in the industry of \"direct offset well\". Second, Mr. McBeath\n\n      argues that the lease provision relating to. an offset well has nothing to do with the potential for\n\n      drainage of the leased premises by the Comstock well (\"Plaintiffs contention that an offset well,\n\n      as used in the Lease, exists to protect their acreage from drainage is not! correct.\" — Mel3eath,\n\n      page 6). Neither of these arguments has any credibility based upon conventional oilfield usage,\n\n      traditional' construction. of the English language nor Common seti8e,\n\n              8.      Regarding Mr. McBeath's argument as to the purpose or Paragraph 25 of the\n\n      leases: based upon my involvement in the 'construction of several hundredi' oil and gas leases, and\n\n      specifically over one hundred oil and gas leases in the past five years 4r the development of\n                                                                                 i\n      Eagle Ford Shale reserves, the inclusion of a provision such as the one in Paragraph 25 requiring.\n\n      'remedies by the Lessee should a well be drilled on offset acreage has only one, sole purpose - to\n\n      prevent, compensate and mitigate the drainage of the leased premises ig the offending well.\n\n      Common sense precludes any other construction. In fact, Paragraph 25 requires .the lessee to drill\n\n      an \"offset well\" if an offending well is drilled, which is specifically defined in the lease as a well\n\n      drilled within 467' of the leased premises, Which at the time the lease was executed, defined a\n\n      well drilled closer to the lease than Railroad Commission rules would allOw. The stated distance\n\n      of a well from the leased premises defines the specific intent that the coriesponding location of\n\n      an \"off-set well\" drilled under Paragraph 2'5 (1) should be equally as close to the offending well\n\n      as possible to protect the Lessors' reserves from drainage by the offending well. For Murphy to\n\n      state that the Herbst well, located over 2100 feet away from the offending well and being also as\n\n\n\n                                                        3\n                                                                                                    2083219.1\n240\n\f                                                                           S\n       far away as the configuration of the lease would allow, satisfies the Leases' offset remedy cannot\n\n      be. supported by standard oilfield practice, the intent of the parties in negotiating the lease, or\n\n      common sense.\n\n               9.       Mr. McBeath's attempt to explain a presumed difference between \"an offset well\"\n\n      and \"a direct offset well\" has no basis in standard oilfield practices. I, Have never seen in any\n\n      written contract nor heard in any conversation, such a distinction being made. Asserting that\n\n      there is no connection between. the term \"offset well\" and a specific distance from a lease line is\n\n      a contrived and desperate attempt to explain .Mtuphy's actions in this !matter. It deserves no\n\n      further i:ebtittal.\n\n               10.. In the highly competitive and intense development setting ,of the Eagle Ford Shale\n\n      Trend, it has been my practice and that of my partners in the drilling of over 300 wells across-\n\n      265,000 acres, to contact offset operators prior to setting up a drilling pattern that begins 330 feet\n\n      from the common property boundary. There are numerous alternatives to; starting a development\n\n      program on an adjacent lease to another operator rather than drilling the losest offset.well first.\n\n      To do so without- attempting to contact the offset operator first is akin t4 dropping -the glove\n\n      start a duel. Likewise, should this event -occur, it is incomprehensibly that a Lessee would\n\n      unilaterally drill a. knowingly contentious location such as' the Iviurphyi #1-H Herbst \"B\" Well\n\n      without conducting transparent conversations with the Lessors first. If the Herbst tract of land\n\n      Merited the drilling of a well, there was no purpose served for either MUrphy or the Lessors by\n\n      leaving the potential for drainage by the offsetting Comstock well un4hallenged. in fact, the\n\n      proper development of the Herbst tract Will require at least two additional wells, which will both\n\n      be significantly closer to the Comstock well than the current Herbst \"B\" Well, There is nothing in\n\n      the facts, viewed through the' perspective of standard oilfield practices. nor in Mr.. McBeath's\n\n\n\n                                                       4.\n                                                                                                   2083219.1\n241\n\f                                   •                                     •\n      affidavit., (which become specious when viewed through the perspective of the standard\n\n      construction of the English language and by common sense); that supports Murphy's claim that\n\n      its # l H Herbst \"B\" Well is an adequate remedy to satisfy its obligations under Paragraph 25 for\n\n      protection froth an offending offset well. \"\n\n\n\n  •FURTHER, AFFIANT SAYETH NOT\n\n\n\n\n      STATE OF TEXAS\n\n      COUNTY OFNUECES\n\n              •Subscribed and sworn to before me, the undersigned authority on this the:.ieday of April,\n      2014.\n\n\n\n                      DOWANNVE$MER\n                     MYtOMMI$SION.

That Mr. Stei n1 e i f he\n\n13   wanted and the parti es wanted to I i mi t where that\n\n14   offset dri I I needed to be pl aced on the adj acent\n\n15   property in terms of how many feet from the I ease\n\n16   I i ne that coul d have been put i n the I ease, but i t\n\n17   wasn' t.    And so the wel I was dri I I ed wi thi n the\n\n18   ti meframe requi red. And the Court has found i t to be\n\n19   an offset wel I.

I am not a big fan\n\n22   of I I mi ti ng parti es access to the courts.     And\n\n23   frankl y my thinking on not awarding attorney's fees\n\n24   as a result of the tri al proceeding was that the\n\n25   PI ai nti ffs were certai n1 y enti tI ed to thei r thoughts\n\n\n                              (210) 415-6628\n\f                                                             47\n\n 1   as to the offset well needing to be drilled closer\n\n 2   and had the right to present their arguments to the\n\n 3   Court for the Court to make a determination on that,\n\n 4   and should not be penalized by having to pay huge\n\n 5   amounts of attorney's fees. And so attorney's fees\n\n 6   were not awarded. And I will change my order to the\n\n 7   extent of reducing the amount of attorney's fees\n\n 8   reasonable and necessary on appeal. And the Court of\n\n 9   Appeals can then determine whether or not that's an\n\n10   appropriate decision by this Court as well.    So fix\n\n11   me up something that comports with my ruling, y'all\n\n12   both sign i t, and I will be happy to sign it as well.\n\n13                MS.

A copy of this letter is also being mailed to the\n      Honorable Russell Wilson, the district judge now presiding over this case.\n\n              I was the attorney who drafted the leases at issue in this case. In particular, I drafted the\n      offset clause provision in both leases. I have prepared hundreds of leasps that contain this same\n      offset clause provision for mineral interest owners in this -part of the State. The ruling in this\n      case — which allows a well located anywhere on the leased property to constitute an offset well —\n      effectively renders meaningless these offset clause provisioni and will -adversely impact all -of-\n      these mineral interest owners. This offset well provision is intended to protect against drainage.\n      I purposefully omitted the word drainage from the test for the offending well because of the\n      difficulty and expense involved in proving that an offending well is draining the lease tract. By,\n      using a stipulated distance of 467 feet from the lease line, the parties contractually agree that any\n      well drilled within 467 feet of the lease line is draining the lease tract. However, to protect\n      against drainage, the offset well should be drilled as close as reasonably possible; but in any\n      event within the stipulated 467 feet from the lease line, next to the well it is intended to offset.\n      To say, as a matter of law, that a well drilled more than three times this contractual drainage\n      distance of 467 feet is an offset well completely negates the intent and contractual protection of\n      this clause.\n\n                                                             Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n\n\n          ,FILED• . ) -          O'CLOCK -    M              Alffed A.

A person acquainted with the facts pertinent to the application shall\ncertify that all facts stated in it are true and within the knowledge of that person.\n\n   (A) When an exception to only the minimum lease-line spacing requirement is desired, the\napplicant shall file a list of the mailing addresses of all affected persons, who, for tracts closer to\nthe well than the greater of one-half of the prescribed minimum between-well spacing distance or\nthe minimum lease-line spacing distance, include:\n\n   (i) the designated operator;\n\n   (ii) all lessees of record for tracts that have no designated operator; and\n\n   (iii) all owners of record of unleased mineral interests.\n\n   (B) When an exception to the minimum between-well spacing requirement of this section is\ndesired, the applicant is required to file the mailing addresses of those persons identified in\nsubparagraph (A)(i)-(iii) of this paragraph for each adjacent tract and each tract nearer to the well\nthan the greater of one-half the prescribed minimum between-well spacing distance or the\nminimum lease-line spacing.\n\f (3) An exception may be granted pursuant to subsection (h)(2) of this section, or after a public\nhearing held after at least 10 days notice to all persons described in paragraph (2) of this\nsubsection. At any such hearing, the burden shall be on the applicant to establish that an exception\nto this section is necessary either to prevent waste or to prevent the confiscation of property. For\npurposes of giving notice of an application for an exception, the commission will presume that\nevery person described in paragraph (2) of this subsection will be affected by the application,\nunless the Oil and Gas Division director or the director's delegate determines they are unaffected.\nSuch determination will be made only upon written request and a showing by the applicant that:\n\n   (A) competent, conclusive geological or engineering data indicate that no drainage of\nhydrocarbons from the particular tract(s) subject to the request will occur due to production from\nthe applicant's proposed well; and\n\n  (B) notice to the particular operator(s), lessee(s) of record, or owner(s) of record of unleased\nmineral interest would be unduly burdensome or expensive.\n\n(b) The distances mentioned in subsection (a) of this section are minimum distances to provide\nstandard development on a pattern of one well to each 40 acres in areas where proration units have\nnot been established.\n\n(c) In filing an application for an exception to the distance requirements of this section, in addition\nto the plat requirements in §3.5 of this title (relating to Application to Drill, Deepen, Reenter, or\nPlug Back) (Statewide Rule 5), the applicant shall attach to each copy of the form a plat that:\n\n (1) shows to scale the property on which the exception is sought; all other applied for, permitted,\nand completed oil, gas, or oil and gas wells in the same field and reservoir on said property; and all\nadjoining surrounding properties and completed wells in the same field and reservoir within the\nprescribed minimum between-well spacing distance of the applicant's well;\n\n (2) shows the entire lease, pooled unit, or unitized tract indicating the names and offsetting\nproperties of all affected offset operators;\n\n (3) corresponds to the listing required under subsection (a)(2) of this section;\n\n (4) is certified by a person acquainted with the facts pertinent to the application that the plat is\naccurately drawn to scale and correctly reflects all pertinent and required data.\n\n(d) In the interest of protecting life and for the purpose of preventing waste and preventing the\nconfiscation of property, the commission reserves the right in particular oil, gas, and geothermal\nresource fields to enter special orders increasing or decreasing the minimum distances provided by\nthis section.\n\f(e) No well drilled in violation of this section without special permit obtained, issued, or granted in\nthe manner prescribed in said section, and no well drilled under such special permit or on the\ncommission's own order which does not conform in all respects to the terms of such permit shall be\npermitted to produce either oil, gas, or geothermal resources and any such well so drilled in\nviolation of said section or on the commission's own order shall be plugged.\n\n(f) No operator shall commence the drilling of a well, either on a regular location or on a Rule 37\nexception location, until first having been notified by the commission that the regular location has\nbeen approved, or that the Rule 37 exception location has been approved. Failure of an operator to\ncomply with this subsection will cause such well to be closed in and the holding up of the\nallowable of such well.\n\n(g) Subdivision of property.\n\n  (1) In applying Rule 37 (Statewide Spacing Rule) of statewide application and in applying every\nspecial rule with relation to spacing in every field in this state, no subdivision of property made\nsubsequent to the adoption of the original spacing rule will be considered in determining whether or\nnot any property is being confiscated within the terms of such spacing rule, and no subdivision of\nproperty will be regarded in applying such spacing rule or in determining the matter of confiscation\nif such subdivision took place subsequent to the promulgation and adoption of the original spacing\nrule.\n\n (2) Any subdivision of property creating a tract of such size and shape that it is necessary to\nobtain an exception to the spacing rule before a well can be drilled thereon is a voluntary\nsubdivision and not entitled to a permit to prevent confiscation of property if it were either:\n\n  (A) segregated from a larger tract in contemplation of oil, gas, or geothermal resource\ndevelopment; or\n\n  (B) segregated by fee title conveyance from a larger tract after the spacing rule became effective\nand the voluntary subdivision rule attached.\n\n (3) The date of attachment of the voluntary subdivision rule is the date of discovery of oil, gas, or\ngeothermal resource production in a certain continuous reservoir, regardless of the subsequent\nlateral extensions of such reservoir, provided that such rule does not attach in the case of a\nsegregation of a small tract by fee title conveyance which is not located in an oil, gas, or\ngeothermal resource field having a discovery date prior to the date of such segregation.\n\n (4) The date of attachment of the voluntary subdivision rule for multiple reservoir fields located in\nthe same structural feature and separated vertically but not laterally (i.e., the multiple reservoirs\noverlap geographically at least in part), shall be the same date as that assigned to the earliest\ndiscovery well for such multiple reservoir structure.\n\f (5) If a newly discovered reservoir is located outside the then productive limits of any previously\ndiscovered reservoirs and is classified by the commission as a newly discovered field, then the date\nof discovery of such newly found reservoir remains the date of attachment for the voluntary\nsubdivision rule, even though subsequent development may result in the extension of such newly\ndiscovered reservoir until it overlies or underlies older reservoirs with prior discovery dates.\n\n  (6) The date of attachment of the voluntary subdivision rule for a reservoir that has been\ndeveloped through expansion of separately recognized fields into a recognized single reservoir and\nis merged by commission order is the earliest discovery date of production from such merged\nreservoir, and that date will be used subsequent to the date of merger of the fields into a single\nfield.\n\n (7) The date of attachment of the voluntary subdivision rule for a reservoir under any special\ncircumstance which the commission deems sufficient to provide for an exception may be\nestablished other than as prescribed in this section, so that innocent parties may have their rights\nprotected.\n\n(h) Exceptions to Rule 37.\n\n (1) An order granting exception to Rule 37 wherein protest is had shall carry as its last paragraph\nthe following language: It is further ordered by the commission that this order shall not be final\nuntil 20 days after it is actually mailed to the parties by the commission; provided that if a motion\nfor rehearing of the application is filed by any party at interest within such 20-day period, this order\nshall not become final until such motion is overruled, or if such motion is granted, this order shall\nbe subject to further action by the commission. Permits issued pursuant to paragraph (2) of this\nsubsection shall be issued without the 20-day waiting period.\n\n (2) The director of the Oil and Gas Division or a delegate of the director may issue an exception\npermit for drilling, deepening, or additional completion, recompletion, or reentry in an existing well\nbore if:\n\n     (A) a notice of at least 10 days has been given, and no protest has been made to the application;\nor\n\n  (B) written waivers of objection are received from all persons to whom notice would be given\npursuant to subsection (a)(2) of this section.\n\n (3) Applications filed for drilling, deepening, or additional completion, recompletion, or reentry\nwill be processed and permit issued in accordance with this regulation, subject to the commission's\ndiscretion to set any application for hearing. If the director or a delegate of the director declines to\ngrant an application, the operator may request a hearing.\n\n(i) Rule 37 permits.\n\f (1) Unless otherwise specified in a permit or in a final order granting an exception to this section,\npermits issued by the commission for completions requiring an exception to this section shall\nexpire two years from the effective date of the permit unless drilling operations are commenced in\ngood faith within the two-year permit period. The permit period will not be extended.\n\n (2) So long as a Rule 37 exception is in litigation, the two-year permit period will not commence.\nOn final adjudication and decree from the last court of appeal the two-year permit period will\ncommence, beginning on the date of final decree.\n\n(j) Once an application for a spacing exception has been denied, no new application shall be\nentertained except on changed conditions. Changed conditions in the commission's administration\nof its Spacing Rule 37 and amendments thereto applicable to the various special fields and\nreservoirs of Texas and in passing upon applications for permits under said rule and amendments\nshall include, among other things, the following.\n\n (1) Any material changes in the physical conditions of the producing reservoir under the tract\nunder consideration or under the area surrounding said tract which would materially affect the\nrecovery of oil, gas, or geothermal resource from the given tract.\n\n (2) Any material changes in the distribution or allocation of allowable production in the area\nsurrounding the tract under consideration which would materially affect or tend to affect the\nrecovery of oil, gas, or geothermal resource from the given tract.\n\n (3) Any additional permits granted by the commission for wells drilled in the area surrounding or\non offset tracts to the tract under consideration which would materially affect or tend to affect the\nrecovery of oil, gas, or geothermal resource from the given tract.\n\n (4) Any additional facts or evidence thereof materially affecting or tending to affect the recovery\nof oil, gas, or geothermal resource from the applicant's tract, or the property rights of applicant,\nwhich were not known of and considered by the commission at any previous hearing or application\nthereon.\n\n(k) Exceptions to Statewide Rule 37 apply to the total depth for which the permit is granted or if\nspecial field rules are applicable, an exception to the spacing rule shall be granted only for the\nreservoir or reservoirs or applicable depth to which the well is projected. Subsequent recompletion\nof the well to reservoirs other than that covered by the permit issued would be granted only after\nthe filing and processing of a new application.\n\n(1) Salt dome oil or gas fields.\n\n (1) The provisions of this section shall not apply to certain approved salt dome oil or gas fields.\nAn application for classification as a salt dome oil or gas field shall include the following:\n\f   (A) geological evidence proving that an oil or gas field is a piercement-type salt dome, that\nfaulting has caused the producing formation to be at a 45 angle or greater, and that each well is\nlikely to be completed in a separate reservoir;\n\n  (B) establishment, by plat or otherwise, of the probable productive limits of the salt dome area;\n\nCont'd...\n\n\n                                Next Page            Previous Page\n\n\n                                  List of Titles         Back to List\n\n\n              HOME    TEXAS REGISTER       TEXAS ADMINISTRATIVE CODE    OPEN MEETINGS\n\f<<Prey Rule                                                                               Next Rule»\n                             Texas Administrative Code\n                    TITLE 16             ECONOMIC REGULATION\n                    PART 1               RAILROAD COMMISSION OF TEXAS\n                    CHAPTER 3            OIL AND GAS DIVISION\n                    RULE §3.46           Fluid Injection into Productive Reservoirs\n\n(a) Permit required. Any person who engages in fluid injection operations in reservoirs productive\nof oil, gas, or geothermal resources must obtain a permit from the commission. Permits may be\nissued when the injection will not endanger oil, gas, or geothermal resources or cause the pollution\nof freshwater strata unproductive of oil, gas, or geothermal resources. Permits from the commission\nissued before the effective date of this section shall continue in effect until revoked, modified, or\nsuspended by the commission.\n\n(b) Filing of application.\n\n (1) Application.\n\n   (A) An application to conduct fluid injection operations in a reservoir productive of oil, gas, or\ngeothermal resources shall be filed in Austin on the form prescribed by the commission\naccompanied by the prescribed fee. On the same date, one copy shall be filed with the appropriate\ndistrict office. The form shall be executed by a party having knowledge of the facts entered on the\nform.\n\n  (B) The applicant shall file the freshwater injection data form if fresh water is to be injected.\n\n  (C) The applicant for a disposal well permit under this section shall include with the permit\napplication a printed copy or screenshot showing the results of a survey of information from the\nUnited States Geological Survey (USGS) regarding the locations of any historical seismic events\nwithin a circular area of 100 square miles (a circle with a radius of 9.08 kilometers) centered\naround the proposed disposal well location.\n\n   (D) The commission may require an applicant for a disposal well permit under this section to\nprovide the commission with additional information such as logs, geologic cross-sections, pressure\nfront boundary calculations, and/or structure maps, to demonstrate that fluids will be confined if the\nwell is to be located in an area where conditions exist that may increase the risk that fluids will not\nbe confined to the injection interval. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, complex\ngeology, proximity of the basement rock to the injection interval, transmissive faults, and/or a\nhistory of seismic events in the area as demonstrated by information available from the USGS.\n\f (2) Commercial disposal well. An applicant for a permit to dispose of oil and gas waste in a\ncommercial disposal well shall clearly indicate on the application and in the notice of application\nthat the application is for a commercial disposal well permit. For the purposes of this rule,\n\"commercial disposal well\" means a well whose owner or operator receives compensation from\nothers for the disposal of oil field fluids or oil and gas wastes that are wholly or partially trucked or\nhauled to the well, and the primary business purpose for the well is to provide these services for\ncompensation.\n\n(c) Notice and opportunity for hearing.\n\n  (1) The applicant shall give notice by mailing or delivering a copy of the application to affected\npersons who include the owner of record of the surface tract on which the well is located; each\ncommission-designated operator of any well located within one half mile of the proposed injection\nwell; the county clerk of the county in which the well is located; and the city clerk or other\nappropriate city official of any city where the well is located within the corporate limits of the city,\non or before the date the application is mailed to or filed with the commission. For the purposes of\nthis section, the term \"of record\" means recorded in the real property or probate records of the\ncounty in which the property is located.\n\n (2) In addition to the requirements of subsection (c)(1), a commercial disposal well permit\napplicant shall give notice to owners of record of each surface tract that adjoins the proposed\ninjection tract by mailing or delivering a copy of the application to each such surface owner.\n\n (3) If, in connection with a particular application, the commission or its delegate determines that\nanother class of persons should receive notice of the application, the commission or its delegate\nmay require the applicant to mail or deliver a copy of the application to members of that class. Such\nclasses of persons could include adjacent surface owners or underground water conservation\ndistricts.\n\n (4) In order to give notice to other local governments, interested, or affected persons, notice of the\napplication shall be published once by the applicant in a newspaper of general circulation for the\ncounty where the well will be located in a form approved by the commission or its delegate. The\napplicant shall file with the commission in Austin proof of publication prior to the hearing or\nadministrative approval.\n\n (5) Protested applications:\n\n  (A) If a protest from an affected person or local government is made to the commission within\n15 days of receipt of the application or of publication, whichever is later, or if the commission or its\ndelegate determines that a hearing is in the public interest, then a hearing will be held on the\napplication after the commission provides notice of hearing to all affected persons, local\ngovernments, or other persons, who express an interest, in writing, in the application.\n\f  (B) For purposes of this section, \"affected person\" means a person who has suffered or will\nsuffer actual injury or economic damage other than as a member of the general public or as a\ncompetitor, and includes surface owners of property on which the well is located and commission-\ndesignated operators of wells located within one-half mile of the proposed disposal well.\n\n (6) If no protest from an affected person is received by the commission, the commission's delegate\nmay administratively approve the application. If the commission's delegate denies administrative\napproval, the applicant shall have a right to a hearing upon request. After hearing, the examiner\nshall recommend a final action by the commission.\n\n(d) Subsequent commission action.\n\n  (1) An injection well permit may be modified, suspended, or terminated by the commission for\njust cause after notice and opportunity for hearing, if:\n\n   (A) a material change of conditions occurs in the operation or completion of the injection well,\nor there are material changes in the information originally furnished;\n\n  (B) fresh water is likely to be polluted as a result of continued operation of the well;\n\n  (C) there are substantial violations of the terms and provisions of the permit or of commission\nrules;\n\n  (D) the applicant has misrepresented any material facts during the permit issuance process;\n\n  (E) injected fluids are escaping from the permitted injection zone;\n\n  (F) for a disposal well permit under this section, injection is likely to be or determined to be\ncontributing to seismic activity; or\n\n  (G) waste of oil, gas, or geothermal resources is occurring or is likely to occur as a result of the\npermitted operations.\n\n  (2) An injection well permit may be transferred from one operator to another operator provided\nthat the commission's delegate does not notify the present permit holder of an objection to the\ntransfer prior to the date the lease is transferred on commission records.\n\n (3) Voluntary permit suspension.\n\n   (A) An operator may apply to temporarily suspend its injection authority by filing a written\nrequest for permit suspension with the commission in Austin, and attaching to the written request\nthe results of an MIT test performed during the previous three-month period in accordance with the\nprovisions of subsection (j)(4) of this section. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to\nany well that is permitted as a commercial injection well.\n\f   (B) The commission or its delegate may grant the permit suspension upon determining that the\nresults of the MIT test submitted under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph indicate that the well\nmeets the performance standards of subsection (j)(4) of this section.\n\n   (C) During the period of permit suspension, the operator shall not use the well for injection or\ndisposal purposes.\n\n   (D) During the period of permit suspension, the operator shall comply with all applicable well\ntesting requirements of §3.14 of this title (relating to plugging, and commonly referred to as\nStatewide Rule 14) but need not perform the MIT test that would otherwise be required under the\nprovisions of subsection (j)(4) of this section or the permit. Further, during the period of permit\nsuspension, the provisions of subsection (i)(1) - (3) of this section shall not apply.\n\n  (E) The operator may reinstate injection authority under a suspended permit by filing a written\nnotification with the commission in Austin. The written notification shall be accompanied by an\nMIT test performed during the three-month period prior to the date notice of reinstatement is filed.\nThe MIT test shall have been performed in accordance with the provisions and standards of\nsubsection (j)(4) of this section.\n\n(e) Area of Review.\n\n (1) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the applicant shall review the data of public\nrecord for wells that penetrate the proposed disposal zone within a 1/4 mile radius of the proposed\ndisposal well to determine if all abandoned wells have been plugged in a manner that will prevent\nthe movement of fluids from the disposal zone into freshwater strata. The applicant shall identify in\nthe application any wells which appear from such review of public records to be unplugged or\nimproperly plugged and any other unplugged or improperly plugged wells of which the applicant\nhas actual knowledge.\n\n (2) The commission or its delegate may grant a variance from the area-of-review requirements of\nparagraph (1) of this subsection upon proof that the variance will not result in a material increase in\nthe risk of fluid movement into freshwater strata or to the surface. Such a variance may be granted\nfor an area defined both vertically and laterally (such as a field) or for an individual well. An\napplication for an areal variance need not be filed in conjunction with an individual permit\napplication or application for permit amendment. Factors that may be considered by the\ncommission or its delegate in granting a variance include:\n\n  (A) the area affected by pressure increases resulting from injection operations;\n\n  (B) the presence of local geological conditions that preclude movement of fluid that could\nendanger freshwater strata or the surface; or\n\f   (C) other compelling evidence that the variance will not result in a material increase in the risk of\nfluid movement into freshwater strata or to the surface.\n\n (3) Persons applying for a variance from the area-of-review requirements of paragraph (1) of this\nsubsection on the basis of factors set out in paragraph (2)(B) or (C) of this subsection for an\nindividual well shall provide notice of the application to those persons given notice under the\nprovisions of subsection (c)(1) of this section. The provisions of subsection (c) of this section shall\napply in the case of an application for a variance from the area-of-review requirements for an\nindividual well.\n\n (4) Notice of an application for an areal variance from the area-of-review requirements under\nparagraph (1) of this subsection shall be given on or before the date the application is filed with the\ncommission:\n\n   (A) by publication once in a newspaper having general circulation in each county, or portion\nthereof, where the variance would apply. Such notice shall be in a form approved by the\ncommission or its delegate prior to publication and must be at least three inches by five inches in\nsize. The notice shall state that protests to the application may be filed with the commission during\nthe 15-day period following the date of publication. The notice shall appear in a section of the\nnewspaper containing state or local news items;\n\n   (B) by mailing or delivering a copy of the application, along with a statement that any protest to\nthe application should be filed with the commission within 15 days of the date the application is\nfiled with the commission, to the following:\n\n   (i) the manager of each underground water conservation district in which the variance would\napply, if any;\n\n   (ii) the city clerk or other appropriate official of each incorporated city in which the variance\nwould apply, if any;\n\n   (iii) the county clerk of each county in which the variance would apply; and\n\n    (iv) any other person or persons that the commission or its delegate determines should receive\nnotice of the application.\n\n (5) If a protest to an application for an areal variance is made to the commission by an affected\nperson, local government, underground water conservation district, or other state agency within 15\ndays of receipt of the application or of publication, whichever is later, or if the commission's\ndelegate determines that a hearing on the application is in the public interest, then a hearing will be\nheld on the application after the commission provides notice of the hearing to all local\ngovernments, underground water conservation districts, state agencies, or other persons, who\nexpress an interest, in writing, in the application. If no protest from an affected person is received\n\fby the commission, the commission's delegate may administratively approve the application. If the\napplication is denied administratively, the person(s) filing the application shall have a right to\nhearing upon request. After hearing, the examiner shall recommend a final action by the\ncommission.\n\nCont'd...\n\n\n                               Next Page             Previous Page\n\n                                  List of Titles         Back to List\n\n\n             HOME    TEXAS REGISTER        TEXAS ADMINISTRATIVE CODE    OPEN MEETINGS\n\f",

May Oil & Gas Company, Ltd. (the “Herbsts”)\n                   assert that Murphy Exploration & Production Co.-USA\n                   breached its obligations under the offset well provisions\n                   in both leases.\n\nTrial Court:       Plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment on\n                   the issue of the breach. Supplemental Clerk’s Record\n                   (SCR) 401. Murphy filed a motion for partial summary\n                   judgment on that issue as well. SCR 119. After a hearing\n                   on the motions, the trial court sent a letter to the parties\n                   stating that she was granting Murphy’s motion and\n                   denying Plaintiffs’ motion.        SCR 433.     Instead of\n                   submitting an order on the partial summary judgment\n                   motions, Murphy submitted a Motion for Entry of Final\n                   Judgment, seeking attorney’s fees in addition to the\n                   ruling on the breach issue.

SCR 414. The judgment denied Murphy an\n                   award of trial court fees but awarded Murphy $150,000 in\n                   fees in the event Plaintiffs pursued an unsuccessful\n                   appeal.

SCR 417.\n                   After a hearing on Plaintiffs’ motions, the trial court\n                   entered an amended final judgment that reduced the\n                   amount of fees to be awarded on appeal but left intact the\n                   summary judgment for Murphy.

Provisions like the one here exist in many oil\n\nand gas leases.    Alfred Steinle, who drafted the leases at issue here,\n\nsubmitted an amicus letter to the trial court in which he stated that he has\n\n“prepared hundreds of leases that contain this same offset clause provision\n\nfor mineral interest owners in this part of the State.” SCR 448.\n\n      Lessors and lessees alike need to know how the rules of contract\n\nconstruction apply to these offset clauses.\n\n      Oral argument will assist the Court in resolving this issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                     xiii\n\f                     ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n1.    The district court erred in granting Murphy’s motion for\nsummary judgment, which allows Murphy to satisfy its\nobligation to drill an offset well simply by drilling a well\nanywhere on the Herbst Leases.\n\n2.    The district court erred in awarding Murphy attorney’s\nfees on appeal because (a) the district court had no authority to\naward fees and (b) the award was an abuse of discretion.\n\n\n\n\n                               xiv\n\f                         STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\nA.    The Dispute.\n\n      The Herbsts are the royalty owners under two oil and gas leases\n\n(“Leases”) on two 302-acre tracts of land in Atascosa County. SCR 6-7, 150-\n\n70. Shirley Mae Herbst Adams is the owner of the executive rights in one\n\ntract (“Shirley Tract”), and William Albert Herbst is the owner of the\n\nexecutive rights in the other tract (“William Tract”).\n\n      Murphy is the lessee/operator under those Leases. SCR 120. Each\n\nlease contains an Offset Clause, paragraph 25, which imposes obligations\n\non the lessee when a well is drilled on adjacent property within 467 feet of\n\nthe boundary or lease line. SCR 155, 166 (¶ 25). Murphy contends that, as\n\na matter of law, it has drilled an offset well in compliance with the Offset\n\nClauses. The Herbsts contend Murphy has not drilled such a well.\n\n      The Offset Clauses in the Herbst Leases state that, if a well “is\n\ncompleted as a producer of oil and/or gas on land adjacent and contiguous\n\nto the leased premises, and within 467 feet of the premises covered by this\n\nlease, … [then], within 120 days after the completion date of the well or\n\nwells on the adjacent acreage,” the lessee must either:\n\n\n\n                                       1\n\f      (1) commence drilling operations on the leased acreage and\n      thereafter continue the drilling of such off-set well or wells with\n      due diligence to a depth adequate to test the same formation\n      from which the well or wells are producing from on the\n      adjacent acreage; or\n\n      (2) pay the Lessor royalties as provided for in this lease as if an\n      equivalent amount of production of oil and/or gas were being\n      obtained from the off-set location on these leased premises as\n      that which is being produced from the adjacent well or wells; or\n\n      (3) release an amount of acreage sufficient to constitute a\n      spacing unit equivalent in size to the spacing unit that would\n      be allocated under this lease to such well or wells on the\n      adjacent lands, as to the zones or strata producing in such\n      adjacent well.\n\nSCR 155, 166 (¶ 25).\n\n      These provisions do not leave the lessee without protection from\n\nhaving to drill an uneconomic well. The lessee has three options: drill the\n\noffset well, pay substitute royalties equal to what the royalties would be on\n\nthe neighboring well, or release acreage.         Thus, if the lessee believes\n\ndrilling the offset well is not in its best interests, it has the option either to\n\npay the substitute royalties or to release acreage so that the Herbsts can\n\neither drill the well themselves or seek another operator for that part of\n\ntheir mineral estate.\n\n\n\n\n                                        2\n\f      Comstock Oil & Gas, LP drilled a well, the Lucas A (the “Lucas\n\nWell”) on the tract just to the southwest of the Shirley and William Tracts.\n\nSCR 86-87; 114, ¶ 9; 148. The well was completed in the Eagleville (Eagle\n\nFord-1) Field, and began producing.        The lateral of the Lucas Well is\n\nlocated 350 feet from the boundaries of the Shirley and William Tracts,\n\nthereby triggering Murphy’s duties under the Offset Clauses. SCR 121.\n\n      Murphy did not pay royalties or release acreage, as permitted under\n\nthe Offset Clauses.    Instead, Murphy asserts that it exercised the first\n\noption: it “chose to drill an offset well.” SCR 123.\n\n      Murphy claims that a horizontal well it drilled on the opposite\n\nboundaries/lease lines of Shirley’s and William’s Tracts – the Herbst Unit B\n\n#1H well (“Herbst B”) – qualifies as an offset well under both Leases. SCR\n\n121-22. As permitted and drilled, the lateral of the Herbst B well runs\n\nparallel to and approximately 450 feet from the northeast line of the Shirley\n\nand William Tracts. SCR 148. Thus, the Herbst B well is over 2,100 feet\n\nfrom the Lucas well, almost as far away from the Lucas well as it could\n\npossibly be and still be located on the Shirley and William Tracts.\n\n      Provided below is a simplified sketch of the tracts and the horizontal\n\nwells, which run the length of the black lines depicting them:\n                                      3\n\f     B.    The Lawsuit.\n\n     The Herbsts sued Murphy for failure to comply with Murphy’s\n\nobligations under the Offset Clauses, seeking the substitute royalties\n\nattributable to the Lucas well and filing a motion for partial summary\n\njudgment on the issue of the breach. SCR 5-11; 40. Murphy filed a motion\n\n\n                                   4\n\ffor partial summary judgment on the breach issue as well. SCR 119. After\n\na hearing on the motions, the trial court sent a letter to the parties stating\n\nthat it was granting Murphy’s motion and denying Plaintiffs’ motion. SCR\n\n433. Instead of submitting an order on the partial summary judgment\n\nmotions as instructed, Murphy submitted a Motion for Entry of Final\n\nJudgment, seeking attorney’s fees in addition to the ruling on the breach\n\nissue. SCR 379.\n\n       Without conducting a hearing on the Motion for Entry of Final\n\nJudgment, the trial court signed a judgment for Murphy. SCR 414. The\n\njudgment crossed out Murphy’s proposed award of trial court fees but\n\nawarded Murphy $150,000 in fees in the event the Herbsts pursued an\n\nunsuccessful appeal. SCR 414. The Herbsts filed motions for new trial and\n\nto vacate, modify or reconsider the judgment. SCR 417. After a hearing on\n\nthose motions, the trial court entered an amended final judgment that left\n\nthe other relief granted to Murphy intact, continued to deny trial court fees\n\nbut still awarded fees on appeal – this time in a reduced amount. SCR 485.\n\n       From that judgment, the Herbsts timely perfected this appeal. SCR\n\n490.\n\n\n\n                                      5\n\f                         SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n      The district court erred in granting a summary judgment that holds\n\nMurphy’s drilling of a well more than 2,100 feet from a well on adjacent\n\nproperty satisfies its obligation to drill an offset well. The purpose of an\n\noffset well is to protect against drainage from a mineral owner’s property\n\nby a well drilled on a neighboring tract. The plain language of the Leases\n\nmakes clear that an offset well must be in close proximity to the well it is\n\nsupposed to offset. Murphy argues there is no distance requirement. But\n\nthere is a distance that triggers Murphy’s offset obligations – that distance\n\nis the location of a neighboring well 467 feet from Plaintiffs’ lease\n\nboundary.    Murphy claims that a well located 2,100 feet from that\n\nneighboring well – 1,800 feet from the Leases’ boundaries – is an offset well\n\nwithin the meaning of the Offset Clauses. If all Murphy had to do to satisfy\n\nthe Offset Clauses was drill a well, the offset clause would have said that.\n\nIt did not; it added the term “offset” to describe the well that had to be\n\ndrilled.\n\n      Murphy’s and the trial court’s interpretation of the Leases renders the\n\nword “offset” meaningless.     Take that word out, and the trial court’s\n\n\n\n                                      6\n\finterpretation makes sense. However, all words in the Offset Clauses must\n\nbe given effect.\n\n      The trial court’s acceptance of Murphy’s interpretation of the Leases\n\nviolates basic rules of contract construction by failing to give meaning and\n\neffect to each provision of the Leases and by failing to the give the words in\n\nthe Offset Clauses their plain meaning.       The holding undermines the\n\npurpose of explicit offset clauses, which is to eliminate the need to actually\n\nprove drainage. The holding is also inconsistent with the understanding in\n\nthe industry of what constitutes an offset well.\n\n      Murphy relied on a conclusory expert affidavit regarding the\n\nmeaning of the term “offset well” as support for its motion.           Expert\n\ntestimony is not needed to interpret the Offset Clauses. Their meaning can\n\nbe readily determined from the plain language and the context in which\n\nthe Offset Clauses were used. Provisions like those found in these Leases\n\nare designed to explicitly define what lessees must do when a well is\n\ndrilled on adjacent property within a specific distance from the lease line.\n\nThat plain language is consistent with every dictionary and industry\n\ndefinition provided by either the Herbsts or by Murphy.\n\n\n\n                                      7\n\f      Murphy’s expert affidavit is conclusory, misreads the regulatory\n\ndecisions on which the expert based his opinions, and is improperly based\n\non terms not found in the Leases. The affidavit is either no evidence at all\n\nor, at best, raises a fact issue on the meaning of the Offset Clauses.\n\n      In addition to erring in granting summary judgment on the meaning\n\nof the Offset Clauses, the trial court both erred and abused its discretion in\n\nawarding appellate attorney’s fees.        The trial court had no statutory\n\nauthority to award Murphy fees – the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act\n\ncannot be used to award fees for defending against a breach of contract\n\nclaim. In addition, even if the trial court had authority to award fees, its\n\ndecision to award fees only in the event the Herbsts pursued an\n\nunsuccessful appeal creates an improper disincentive for the exercise of the\n\nright of appeal and is a clear abuse of discretion.\n\n                                ARGUMENT\n\nI.

Whether a trial court abused its discretion is also\n\na question of law but is reviewed differently from whether a court had the\n\nstatutory authority to award fees.

The trial court erred in granting summary judgment for Murphy.\n      (Issue One)\n\n      The trial court’s grant of summary judgment for Murphy is wrong.\n\nA well drilled pursuant to the Offset Clauses must be close to the well it is\n\ndesigned to offset.     A well drilled more than 2,100 feet from the\n\nneighboring well is not remotely close to and does not “offset” the\n\nneighboring well. The Offset Clauses require an offset well to be drilled\n\n\n                                      10\n\fwhen the neighboring well is within 467 feet of the lease line. The Lucas\n\nwell was within 350 feet of the lease line. The trial court’s holding here is\n\nthat, as a matter of law, a well drilled more than 2,100 feet from the\n\nneighboring well satisfies Murphy’s offset obligations. This interpretation\n\nof the Leases is unreasonable, contrary to the plain language of the Leases\n\nand inconsistent with the clear purpose of the Offset Clauses.\n\n     A.    The trial court violated basic rules of contract construction in holding\n           Murphy’s well qualified, as a matter of law, as an offset well.\n\n     The Herbst Leases are governed by the basic rules of contract\n\ninterpretation. Application of those rules precludes summary judgment for\n\nMurphy.\n\n     “An oil and gas lease is a contract, and its terms are interpreted as\n\nsuch.” Tittizer v.

App.—Austin 2006, pet.\n\ndenied) (interpreting a statute). Ordinary dictionary definitions are not\n\nextrinsic evidence but, instead, confirmation of the generally accepted\n\nplain meaning of words. These dictionary definitions indicate that an\n\noffset well must be close to the well drilled on the neighboring tract so\n\nthat it can actually “offset” or “counterbalance” the neighboring well.\n\nA well located 2,100 feet away from the well it is supposed to “offset”\n\ndoes not comport with this plain meaning.\n\n     The common-sense reading of the Offset Clauses is that the offset\n\nwell will be close to the well drilled on the neighboring tract so that it can\n\ntruly “offset” or “counterbalance” the neighboring well.             Railroad\n\nCommission Field Rules for the Eagle Ford-1 Field where these wells are\n\nlocated prohibit drilling a well “nearer than THREE HUNDRED THIRTY\n\n(330) feet to any property line, lease line, or subdivision line” without\n                                     17\n\fobtaining a spacing exception. See SCR 98 (RRC Final Order, Rule 2).\n\nTherefore, Murphy could, and should, have drilled its offset well close to\n\nthat 330 foot distance. Instead, Murphy drilled a well that was situated\n\n1,800 feet from the boundary of the lease and over 2,100 feet from the\n\nneighboring well – a distance over 6 times longer than the distance allowed\n\nunder the applicable RRC Field Rules.\n\n     In fact, Murphy drilled the well within 450 feet of the opposite side of\n\nthe Shirley and William tracts – almost as far away from the Lucas well as\n\nit possibly could have drilled. A well situated along the opposite boundary\n\n– the far northeastern edge of the leased premises – does not constitute an\n\noffset well. Were that a proper reading of these Offset Clauses, a well on\n\nthe opposite end of a 30,000 acre lease – some 5 or 6 miles away – could be\n\nconsidered an offset well. These provisions are common in oil and gas\n\nleases; the trial court’s ruling, if affirmed, will likely affect tracts much\n\nlarger than the Herbsts. Mr. Steinle, a local attorney and scrivener of these\n\nleases, informed the trial court that he has “prepared hundreds of leases”\n\nwith these provisions. SCR 448. Under the “plain, ordinary, and generally\n\naccepted meaning” of the term offset well, Murphy has not complied with\n\n\n\n                                     18\n\fits offset obligations under either of the two Leases. Heritage Resources, 939\n\nS.W.2d at 121.\n\n      Murphy claims it placed the well where it did because it believed a\n\nwell located on the northeast side of the properties would be more\n\nproductive than a well drilled on the southwest side closest to the Lucas\n\nwell. SCR 132-33, ¶ 12 (claiming the Herbst B well was in “the best location\n\nto optimize production from the Lease”). The Herbsts are not challenging\n\nMurphy’s right to choose to drill a well where the Herbst B well is located.\n\nBut that well does not satisfy the Offset Clauses. Murphy needed either to\n\ndrill another well close to the Lucas well or utilize one of its two other\n\noptions – pay substitute royalties or release acreage so that the Herbsts\n\ncould lease that land to someone else. Murphy did neither but, instead,\n\nclaimed a well it already planned to drill – the Herbst B – constituted an\n\noffset well. Under the plain, common-sense meaning of the Offset Clauses,\n\nit does not.\n\n      Murphy also claims that it satisfied its drilling obligation because the\n\nwell was “drilled ‘to a depth adequate to test the same formation from\n\nwhich the well or wells are producing from on the adjacent acreage.’” SCR\n\n123 (quoting paragraph 25 of the Leases).         The Herbsts have never\n                                     19\n\fchallenged the adequacy of the depth of the Herbst B well. But drilling a\n\nwell deep enough does not equate to drilling a well close enough. Murphy\n\nhas provided no evidence that its drilling of the Herbst B well in any way\n\nprotected against drainage from the Lucas well.        On the contrary, it\n\nasserted in the trial court that no drainage has occurred, suggesting that as\n\nan additional reason why it could put the well anywhere it chose. SCR 296\n\n(“the Eagle Ford does not contain freely migrating hydrocarbons in a\n\ncommon reservoir that can be drained from the adjacent lease”). Whether\n\ndrainage is, in fact, occurring from the Lucas well is beside the point. The\n\nvery purpose of the Offset Clauses is to eliminate the need for proof of\n\ndrainage by presuming drainage is occurring whenever a neighboring well\n\nis located within 467 feet of the lease line. If Murphy believed no drainage\n\nwas possible in the Eagle Ford, Murphy should not have accepted leases\n\nwith these offset provisions.\n\n     Murphy also argued in the trial court that it could locate the well\n\nanywhere on the Leases because the Leases do not specify the distance\n\nfrom the boundary for the offset well. SCR 125. This argument ignores the\n\nfact that the Leases do define the distance for the neighboring well and\n\npresume drainage whenever that neighboring well is within 467 feet of the\n                                     20\n\flease line. The logical inference from the presumption created by these\n\nprovisions is that the offset well must be at least within 467 feet on the\n\nother side the boundary. No logic supports holding, as a matter of law,\n\nthat a well 1,800 feet from the boundary satisfies the offset well obligation.\n\n            3.    The trial court’s decision ignores the reasons offset clauses\n                  like this one are included in leases.\n\n      The trial court’s decision here undermines the very purpose for\n\nwhich offset clauses like the ones here are included in oil and gas leases.\n\nConsideration of the context in which offset clauses like these came to be\n\nincluded in leases is relevant to interpreting them.

Thus, under both these express lease provisions as well as the\n\nimplied covenant, the lessor was required to establish that the lessee failed\n\nto act as a reasonably prudent operator.

If expert testimony is appropriate, Murphy’s expert affidavit\n                 is not conclusive for several reasons, particularly his\n                 misreading of RRC form, rules and orders.\n\n     Even if expert testimony were appropriate, Murphy’s expert\n\naffidavit from Mr. McBeath cannot establish Murphy’s interpretation of\n\nthe Offset Clauses as a matter of law for several reasons. First, opinion\n\ntestimony generally raises only a question of fact. Uniroyal Goodrich\n\nTire co. v.

Mr. McBeath’s opinion is that any well anywhere on the\n\nLeases constitutes an offset well. SCR 176 ¶ 13. Expert testimony that\n\n“does not comport with the plain language of the leases” is “no\n\n                                     28\n\fevidence.” Occidental Permian Ltd. v.

He asserts that\n\na “direct offset well” is a “specialized term within the oil and gas\n\nindustry, and is commonly understood to be a well that is located\n\ndirectly across a lease line or other legal boundary.” SCR 176 at ¶ 13.\n\nHe also refers to “immediate offset wells” – another term not found in\n\nthe Leases – and claims this means the same thing as a “direct offset\n\nwell.” Id. In other words, he suggests that, unless the term “offset\n\nwell” has the adjective “direct” or “immediate” preceding it, the offset\n\nwell need not be in close proximity to the well it is offsetting.\n\n     Third, Mr. McBeath has nothing more than his own bare opinion\n\nto support his claims that these terms are commonly used in the\n\nindustry.   “[I]t is the basis of the witness’s opinion, and not the\n\nwitness’s qualifications or his bare opinions alone, that can settle an\n                                     29\n\fissue as a matter of law; a claim will not stand or fall on the mere ipse\n\ndixit of a credentialed witness.” Burrow v.

SCR 244-89. Mr. McBeath states that\n\nthe RRC’s H-1 form “shows that the term ‘offset well’ is understood\n\nwithin the industry to describe any well drilled on adjacent property”\n                                    30\n\fand asserts the form “requires offset wells within 1/2 mile of the\n\nsubject well to be identified on a map.” SCR 176, ¶ 15. Mr. McBeath\n\nmisrepresents the form. Quoted below is the only portion of Form H-1\n\nthat mentions offset wells:\n\n           7. Plat of Leases, Notice and Hearings\n\n           (a) Plat of Leases. Attach a plat of leases showing\n     producing wells, injection wells, offset wells and identifying\n     ownership of all surrounding leases within one-half (1/2)\n     mile.\n\nSCR 245.\n\n     This provision does not indicate that an offset well is any well\n\nlocated within one-half mile of the lease. The one-half mile refers to the\n\nleases in the vicinity, not to the locations of the wells within those\n\nleases. Moreover, the form distinguishes between “producing wells”\n\nand “offset wells,” indicating that an offset well is not the same thing as\n\na producing well. In other words, this form undermines Mr. McBeath’s\n\nclaim that any producing well is an offset well.\n\n     Similarly, a review of the examiner’s proposal for decision and the\n\nRRC’s final order in RRC Oil and Gas Docket No. XX-XXXXXXX – another\n\nRRC document relied on by Mr. McBeath – shows that the terms “direct\n\n\n                                    31\n\foffset well” and “immediate offset well” are not used at all in the\n\ndiscussion. SCR 247-55. The sole reference to the term offset well is in\n\nthe examiner’s recommendation that the requested disposal well be\n\nallowed only if the applicant can demonstrate “through plume analysis\n\nand offset well construction/plugging evaluation that the injected\n\nfluids will be confined to the proposed disposal zone.” See SCR 247 ¶ 2.\n\nThis statement does not support Mr. McBeath’s opinion.\n\n        RRC Rule 37 decisions, also relied on by Mr. McBeath, do not\n\nsupport his claim that “direct” or “immediate” offset wells are\n\nsomehow closer to the boundary line or otherwise different from “offset\n\nwells.” RRC Rule 37 is a spacing rule that, absent special field rules,\n\nrequires operators to drill wells no closer than 467 feet from the\n\nboundary of the lease. See 16 Tex. Admin. Code § 3.37(a)(1). Operators\n\nmay seek what is called a Rule 37 exception, which allows operators to\n\ndrill wells closer to a boundary line than the applicable field rules\n\npermit, if the operators can show drainage resulting from a neighboring\n\nwell.\n\n        Rule 37 decisions do not assign specialized definitions to describe\n\nthe offset wells that are allowed to prevent drainage. For example, in\n                                     32\n\fRRC Docket No. 0213270, the operator sought a Rule 37 exception to\n\nlocate an offset well 349 feet from the nearest lease line in a field where\n\nthe normal distance was 467 feet. SCR 259. The examiner granted the\n\nexception. He used the term offset to describe both the neighboring\n\nwell that was draining the tract and also a well that could offset the\n\ndraining well. See SCR 259. Examiners sometimes use adjectives such\n\nas “nearby” or “direct” (SCR 268), but there is no special significance\n\nascribed to those words.\n\n     What is clear from all of the Rule 37 decisions Mr. McBeath cites,\n\nwhich require proof of actual drainage to drill closer to the boundary\n\nline than the RRC field rules otherwise permit, is that an offset well is\n\nalways in close proximity to the boundary line.         Operators sought\n\npermission in these cases to locate the offset wells 254 feet (SCR 265),\n\n100 feet (SCR 273), 349 feet (SCR 259), and 75 feet (SCR 281) from the\n\nboundary/lease line.       These RRC orders hurt Murphy’s position,\n\nillustrating the unreasonableness of Mr. McBeath’s attempt to\n\ncharacterize a well 1,800 feet from the boundary line as an offset well.\n\n     The RRC rules Mr. McBeath cites also provide no support for his\n\nipse dixit that the industry considers any well an offset well regardless\n                                    33\n\fof its distance from the neighboring well. Neither 16 Tex. Admin. Code\n\n§ 3.46 (Rule 46) nor § 3.37 (Rule 37) has the term “offset well” in it. 16\n\nTex. Admin. Code § 3.36 (Rule 36) uses the term once with respect to\n\ndetermining the escape rate for hydrogen sulfide in subsection\n\n3.36(c)(3)(C). The phrase does not indicate where the offset well may be\n\nlocated.\n\n                 3.       If expert testimony is appropriate, the affidavit of the\n                          Herbsts’ expert Gregg Robertson either is conclusive as the\n                          only testimony that makes sense or at least raises a fact\n                          issue.\n\n        Although expert testimony is neither necessary nor appropriate\n\nhere, the Herbsts provided in response to Mr. McBeath a competing\n\nexpert affidavit from Gregg Robertson, who has worked in the oil and\n\ngas business for 35 years and joined with Petrohawk Energy to drill the\n\ninitial discovery wells for the Eagle Ford Shale field.3 SCR 238, ¶ 2. If\n\nexpert testimony is appropriate, the experts disagree. The Court should\n\neither accept Mr. Robertson’s affidavit as conclusive because Mr.\n\nMcBeath’s affidavit is unsupported by anything other than his personal\n\n\n3\n  Murphy filed but did not set for hearing a motion to strike Mr. Robertson’s affidavit as conclusory because Mr.\nRobertson did not cite treatises, dictionaries or regulations in support of his opinion. The motion was waived and\nthe claims are false and meritless. Mr. Robertson references that he reviewed the Herbsts’ motion, which included\ndictionary and industry definitions, RRC filings, and the McBeath affidavit in preparation of his affidavit, which\nrefuted in considerable non-conclusory detail Mr. McBeath’s opinions. SCR 238-42.\n\n                                                       34\n\fopinion or should hold there is a fact issue on the meaning of the term\n\n“offset well.”\n\n     Mr. Robertson states that he been involved in “the construction of\n\nseveral hundred oil and gas leases, and specifically over one hundred\n\noil and gas leases in the past five years for the development of Eagle\n\nFord Shale reserves.” SCR 240, ¶ 8. He further states that has “never\n\nseen in any written contract nor heard in any conversation” the\n\ndistinction Mr. McBeath purports to make between “an offset well” and\n\n“a direct offset well.”   SCR 241, ¶ 9.     Mr. Robertson refutes Mr.\n\nMcBeath’s claim that the terms “direct offset well” and “immediate\n\noffset well” are terms commonly used in the oil and gas industry. SCR\n\n239-42, ¶¶ 5-9.\n\n     The Court should reject Mr. McBeath’s claim (SCR 177,¶ 19) that\n\nthe purpose of the offset clause is not to protect acreage from drainage.\n\nThis claim defies common sense, as well as dictionary and industry\n\ndefinitions and court decisions.   It is also expressly refuted by Mr.\n\nRobertson. SCR 240, ¶ 8. Mr. McBeath opines that no drainage would\n\nactually occur here because experience has shown that only “a\n\nrelatively modest amount of reservoir is drained by each horizontal\n                                   35\n\fwell.” SCR 177, ¶ 19. Mr. McBeath’s claim that no drainage has, in fact,\n\noccurred is precisely the kind of factual dispute the Offset Clause\n\nrenders irrelevant. Mr. McBeath’s claim that the purpose of an offset\n\nwell is not to protect against drainage is nonsensical.              The “sole\n\npurpose” of an offset well is “to prevent, compensate and mitigate the\n\ndrainage of the leased premises by the offending well. Common sense\n\nprecludes any other construction.” SCR 175, ¶ 8 (Robertson Aff.).\n\nIII.   The trial court erred in awarding Murphy attorney’s fees. (Issue\n       Two)\n\n       A.   The trial court had no statutory authority to award attorney’s\n            fees.\n\n       There is no legal basis for awarding Murphy any attorney’s fees in\n\nthis case. The Herbsts sued Murphy for breach of contract. SCR 5-11.\n\nMurphy counterclaimed for attorneys’ fees under Chapters 37 and 38 of the\n\nTexas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. SCR 116. Neither provides a\n\nbasis for a recovery of fees by Murphy.\n\n       Murphy cannot recover fees under Chapter 38, which defines when\n\nfees are recoverable in a breach of contract case. Chapter 38 limits recovery\n\nof fees to when the prevailing party has recovered damages in the breach of\n\ncontract action. See, e.g., Green Int’l, Inc. v. Solis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2382247\"><a href=\"/opinion/2382247/green-intern-inc-v-solis/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">384</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 390 (Tex.\n\n                                       36\n\f1997) (“To recover attorney’s fees under Section 38.001, a party must (1)\n\nprevail on a cause of action for which attorney’s fees are recoverable, and\n\n(2) recover damages.”) (emphasis added). Murphy has no claim for damages\n\nand, therefore cannot recover fees under Chapter 38. Murphy conceded as\n\nmuch in its Motion for Final Judgment, wherein it does not seek recovery\n\nof fees under Chapter 38 but, instead, seeks fees under Chapter 37.\n\n     Murphy may not recover fees under Chapter 37 either. Chapter 37\n\ncontains the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (UDJA) and, when the\n\nUDJA is properly invoked, § 37.009 gives the trial court the discretion to\n\naward such fees “as are equitable and just.” The UDJA, however, may not\n\nbe used “as a vehicle to obtain otherwise impermissible attorney’s fees.”\n\nMBM Fin. Corp. v. Woodlands Operating Co., L.P., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">660</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 669 (Tex.\n\n2009).   When, as here, the core issue lies in contract, a defendant like\n\nMurphy cannot simply “replead[] a claim as a declaratory judgment.” Id.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s reasoning in MBM Financial is controlling here:\n\n     [W]hile declaratory relief may be obtained under the Act in all\n     these circumstances, that does not mean attorney’s fees can too.\n     Texas has long followed the “American Rule” prohibiting fee\n     awards unless specifically provided by contract or statute. By\n     contrast, the Declaratory Judgments Act allows fee awards to\n     either party in all cases. If repleading a claim as a declaratory\n     judgment could justify a fee award, attorney’s fees would be\n                                     37\n\f      available for all parties in all cases. That would repeal not only\n      the American Rule but also the limits imposed on fee awards in\n      other statutes. Accordingly, the rule is that a party cannot use\n      the Act as a vehicle to obtain otherwise impermissible\n      attorney’s fees.\n\n      The Act was originally “intended as a speedy and effective\n      remedy” for settling disputes before substantial damages were\n      incurred. It is “intended to provide a remedy that is simpler\n      and less harsh than coercive relief, if it appears that a\n      declaration might terminate the potential controversy.” But\n      when a claim for declaratory relief is merely tacked onto a\n      standard suit based on a matured breach of contract, allowing\n      fees under Chapter 37 would frustrate the limits Chapter 38\n      imposes on such fee recoveries. And granting fees under\n      Chapter 37 when they are not permitted under the specific\n      common-law or statutory claims involved would violate the\n      rule that specific provisions should prevail over general ones.\n      While the Legislature intended the Act to be remedial, it did\n      not intend to supplant all other statutes and remedies.\n\nMBM Financial, 292 S.W.3d at 669-70 (footnotes omitted).\n\n      Thus, a request for declaratory judgment that is merely “tacked onto”\n\na breach of contract claim cannot be a basis for a fee award.

Aquamarine Operators, Inc., 701 S.W.2d at 241-42.\n\nSee also Woodglen Homeowners Ass’n v.

(“A trial court abuses its discretion if its\n\ndecision is arbitrary, unreasonable, and without any reference to any\n\nguiding rules or principles.”).\n\n      The district court here exercised its discretion to deny Murphy an\n\naward of fees incurred in the trial court, stating:\n\n      And frankly my thinking on not awarding attorney’s fees as a\n      result of the trial proceeding was that the Plaintiffs were\n      certainly entitled to their thoughts as to the offset well needing\n      to be drilled closer and had the right to present their arguments\n      to the Court for the Court to make a determination on that, and\n      should not be penalized by having to pay huge amounts of\n      attorney’s fees. And so attorney’s fees were not awarded.\n\nRR 46, l. 22 – 47, l. 6.\n\n      The trial court then proceeded to award conditional fees to Murphy\n\nin the event the Herbsts sought review in this Court and, if necessary, in\n\nthe Supreme Court. SCR 494. Having effectively found that it was not\n                                       41\n\f“equitable or just” to award trial court fees, the court had no basis for then\n\nholding that the Herbsts should be “penalized” with fees if they sought\n\nreview in this Court.\n\n      The trial court held the Herbsts had a legitimate issue to litigate and\n\nshould not be burdened with their opponents’ trial court fees for that\n\nlitigation. That reasoning applies equally to the Herbsts’ appeal. The\n\ncourt’s ruling that it is not “equitable and just” to award trial fees but it is\n\n“equitable and just” to impose those fees in the event of an appeal is\n\narbitrary and capricious and without guiding principles. Such an award\n\n“could serve only to place a financial disincentive” for the Herbsts to\n\nexercise their right to appeal to this Court and, as such, constitutes an\n\nabuse of discretion. Reagan v.

The Herbst #1H Well, on which Murphy commenced drilling\n\n                            operations June 8, 2012, was drilled as an off-set well pursuant to\n\n                            Paragraph 25 of the Leases and satisfies the requirements of Paragraph 25\n\n                            of the Leases; and\n\n                            c.     Murphy has not breached the Leases with regard to the drilling and\n\n                            completion of the Herbst #1H Well and does not owe compensatory or\n\n                            other royalties or any other obligations under Paragraph 25 as a result.\n\n                    2.      The Court has found that Murphy's attorneys' fees in the amount of\n\n      $120,853.36 and costs in the amount of $5,119.71 are reasonable and necessary and it is\n                                  CIVIL\n415\n                                     VOL              PAGE       1   16\n\f      equitable and just for Plaintiffs to pay Murphy's                 -and costs. Therefore, Plaintiffs\n\n      are ORDERED to pay          AllE1   •\n\n\n\n\n      5-1-20,853.36 anktcosts in the amount of $5,119.71.\n\n                       3.   The Court has further found that, should Plaintiffs appeal this Final\n\n      Judgment, Murphy will expend reasonable and necessary attorneys' fees in the amount of\n\n      $150,000 to defend the appeal. Therefore, should Plaintiffs unsuccessfully appeal this Final\n\n      Judgment, they are ORDERED to pay Murphy's reasonable and necessary attorneys' fees on\n\n      appeal in the amount of $150,000.\n\n                       4.   Plaintiffs TAKE NOTHING by their claims.\n\n                       5.

The amended Field Rules are\n     set out in their entirety as follows:\n\n            RULE 1: The entire correlative interval from 10,294 feet to 10,580 feet as shown\n     on the log of the EOG Resources, Inc. - Milton Unit, Well No. 1 (API. No. 42-255-31608),\n     Section 64, John Randon Survey, A-247, Karnes County, Texas, shall be designated as\n     a single reservoir for proration purposes and be designated as the Eagleville (Eagle Ford-\n     1) Field.\n\n            RULE 2: No well for oil or gas shall hereafter be drilled nearer than THREE\n     HUNDRED THIRTY (330) feet to any property line, lease line, or subdivision line. There\n     is no minimum between well spacing requirement. The aforementioned distances in the\n     above rule are minimum distances to allow an operator flexibility in locating a well; and the\n\n\n\n\n98\n\f     OIL AND GAS DOCKET NO. XX-XXXXXXX\n\n\n     above spacing rule and the other rules to follow are for the purpose of permitting only one\n     well to each drilling and proration unit. Provided however, that the Commission will grant\n     exceptions to permit drilling within shorter distances and drilling more wells than herein\n     prescribed, whenever the Commission shall have determined that such exceptions are\n     necessary either to prevent waste or to prevent the confiscation of property. When\n     exception to these rules is desired, application therefor shall be filed and will be acted upon\n     in accordance with the provisions of Commission Statewide Rules 37 and 38, which\n     applicable provisions of said rules are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n           In applying this rule, the general order of the Commission with relation to the\n     subdivision of property shall be observed.\n\n            Provided, however, that for purposes of spacing for horizontal wells, the following\n     shall apply:\n\n            a.     A take point in a horizontal drainhole well is any point along a horizontal\n                   drainhole where oil and/or gas can be produced from the reservoir/field\n                   interval. The first take point may be at a different location than the\n                   penetration point and the last take point may be at a location different than\n                   the terminus point.\n\n            b.     No horizontal drain hole well for oil or gas shall hereafter be drilled such that\n                   the first and last take point are nearer than ONE HUNDRED (100) feet to any\n                   property line, lease line or subdivision line.\n\n            c.     For each horizontal drainhole well, the perpendicular distance from any take\n                   point on such horizontal 'drainhole between the first take point and the last\n                   take point to any point on any property line, lease line or subdivision line\n                   shall be a minimum of THREE HUNDRED THIRTY (330) feet.\n\n           For the purpose of assigning additional acreage to a horizontal well pursuant to\n     Statewide Rule 86, the distance from the first take point to the last take point in the\n     horizontal drainhole shall be used in such determination, in lieu of the distance from\n     penetration point to terminus.\n\n             In addition to the penetration point and the terminus of the wellbore required to be\n     identified on the drilling permit application (Form W-1H) and plat, the first and last take\n     points must also be identified on the drilling permit application (Remarks Section) and plat.\n     Operators shall file an as-drilled plat showing the path, penetration point, terminus and the\n     first and last take points of all drainholes in horizontal wells, regardless of allocation\n     formula.\n\n            If the applicant has represented in the drilling application that there will be one or\n\n\n\n\n99\n\f                             •                                         •\n      OIL AND GAS DOCKET NO. XX-XXXXXXX\n\n\n      more no perf zones or \"NPZ's\" (portions of the wellbore within the field interval without take\n      points), then the as-drilled plat filed after completion of the well shall be certified by a\n      person with knowledge of the facts pertinent to the application that the plat is accurately\n      drawn to scale and correctly reflects all pertinent and required data. In addition to the\n      standard required data, the certified plat shall include the as-drilled track of the wellbore,\n      the location of each take point on the wellbore, the boundaries of any wholly or partially\n      unleased tracts within a Rule 37 distance of the wellbore, and notations of the shortest\n      distance from each wholly or partially unleased tract within a Rule 37 distance of the\n      wellbore to the nearest take point on the wellbore.\n\n             A properly permitted horizontal drainhole Will be considered to be in compliance with\n      the spacing rules set forth herein if the as-drilled location falls within a rectangle\n      established as follows:\n\n             a.     Two sides of the rectangle are parallel to the permitted drainhole and 33 feet\n                    on either side of the drainhole;\n\n             b.     The other two sides of the rectangle are perpendicular to the sides described\n                    in (a) above, with one of those sides passing through the first take point and\n                    the other side passing through the last take point.\n\n             Any point of a horizontal drainhole outside of the described rectangle must conform\n      to the permitted distance of the nearest property line, lease line or subdivision line\n      measured perpendicular from the wellbore.\n\n              For any well permitted in this field, the penetration point need not be located on the\n      same lease, pooled unit or unitized tract on which the well is permitted and may be located\n      on an Offsite Tract. When the penetration point is located on such Offsite Tract, the\n      applicant for such a drilling permit must give 21 days notice by certified mail, return receipt\n      requested to the mineral owners of the Offsite Tract. For the purposes of this rule, the\n      mineral owners of the Offsite Tract are (1) the designated operator; (2) all lessees of record\n      for the Offsite Tract where there is no designated operator; and (3) all owners of unleased\n      mineral interests where there is no designated operator or lessee. In providing such\n      notice, applicant must provide the mineral owners of the Offsite Tract with a plat clearly\n      depicting the projected path of the entire wellbore. In the event the applicant is unable,\n      after due diligence, to locate the whereabouts of any person to whom notice is required by\n      this rule, the applicant must publish notice of this application pursuant to the Commission's\n      Rules of Practice and Procedure. If any mineral owner of the Offsite Tract objects to the\n      location of the penetration point, the applicant may request a hearing to demonstrate the\n      necessity of the location of the penetration point of the well to prevent waste or to protect\n      correlative rights. Notice of Offsite Tract penetration is not required if (a) written waivers\n      of objection are received from all mineral owners of the Offsite Tract; or, (b) the applicant\n      is the only mineral owner of the Offsite Tract. To mitigate the potential for well collisions,\n\n\n\n\n100\n\f                              •                                          •\n      OIL AND GAS DOCKET NO. XX-XXXXXXX\n\n\n      applicant shall promptly provide copies of any directional surveys to the parties entitled to\n      notice under this section, upon request.\n\n               RULE 3: The acreage assigned to the individual oil well for the purpose of\n      allocating allowable oil production thereto shall be known as a proration unit. The standard\n      drilling and proration units are established hereby to be EIGHTY (80) acres. No proration\n      unit shall consist of more than EIGHTY (80) acres except as hereinafter provided. All\n      proration units shall consist of continuous and contiguous acreage which can reasonably\n      be considered to be productive of oil. No double assignment of acreage will be accepted.\n      Additional acreage may be assigned to each horizontal drainhole well in accordance with\n      Statewide Rule 86.\n\n             If after the drilling of the last well on any lease' and the assignment of acreage to\n      each well thereon in accordance with the regulations of the Commission there remains an\n      additional unassigned acreage of less than EIGHTY (80) acres, then and in such event the\n      remaining unassigned acreage up to and including a total of FORTY (40) acres may be\n      assigned as tolerance acreage to the last well drilled on such lease or may be distributed\n      among any group of wells located thereon, so long as the proration units resulting from the\n      inclusion of such additional acreage meet the limitations prescribed by the Commission.\n\n             An operator, at his option, shall be permitted to form optional drilling units of FORTY\n      (40) acres. A proportional acreage allowable credit will be given for a well on a fractional\n      proration unit.\n\n              For the determination of acreage credit in this field, operators shall file for each oil\n      or gas well in this field a Form P-15 Statement of Productivity of Acreage Assigned to\n      Proration Units. On that form or an attachment thereto, the operator shall list the number\n      of acres that are being assigned to each well on the lease or unit for proration purposes.\n      For oil or gas wells, operators shall be required to file, along with the Form P-15, a plat of\n      the lease, unit or property; provided that such plat shall not be required to show individual\n      proration units. There is no maximum diagonal limitation in this field.\n\n             RULE 4: The maximum daily oil allowable for a well in the field shall be determined\n      by multiplying 2,000 barrels of oil per day by a fraction, the numerator of which is the\n      acreage assigned to the well for proration purposes and the denominator of which is the\n      maximum acreage authorized by these field rules for a vertical well for proration purposes,\n      exclusive of tolerance acreage. Each oil well shall have unlimited net gas-oil ratio\n      authority.\n\n             RULE 5: A flowing oil well will be granted administratively, without necessity of filing\n      fees unless the Commission requires filing fees in the future for Statewide Rule 13(b)(4)(A)\n      exceptions, a six month exception to Statewide Rule 13(b)(4)(A) regarding the requirement\n      of having to be produced through tubing. A revised completion report will be filed once the\n\n\n\n\n101\n\f                             •                                          •\n      OIL AND GAS DOCKET NO. XX-XXXXXXX\n\n\n      oil well has been equipped with the required tubing string to reflect the actual completion\n      configuration. This exception would be applicable for new drills, reworks, recompletions\n      or for new fracture stimulation treatments for any flowing oil well in the field. For good\n      cause shown, which shall include the well flowing at a pressure in excess of 300 psi, an\n      operator may obtain administratively from the district director, without the necessity of filing\n      fees unlessthe Commission requires filing fees in the future for Statewide Rule 13(b)(4)(A)\n      exceptions, one or more extensions each with a duration of up to six months. If the\n      request for an extension of time is denied, the operator may request a hearing. If a hearing\n      is requested the exception shall remain in effect pendin2 final Commission action on the\n      request for an extension.\n\n              RULE 6: An oil well will be granted administratively, without necessity of filing fees\n      unless the Commission requires filing fees in the future for Statewide Rule 51(a)\n      exceptions, a six month exception to the provisions of Statewide Rule 51(a) regarding the\n      10 day rule for filing the potential test after testing of the well. This will allow for the\n      backdating of allowables on the oil wells without requiring a waiver to be secured from all\n      field operators. This rule will grant the Commission the authority to issue an allowable\n      back to the initial completion date for all oil wells in the field to prevent unnecessary shut-\n      ins to alleviate potential overproduction issues related to the completion paperwork filings\n      and producing the oil wells without tubing. If an extension of time is granted under Rule\n      5, the exception to Statewide Rule 51(a) under this rule is automatically extended for the\n      additional lime.\n\n            The Eagleville (Eagle Ford-1) Field is a hydrogen sulfide field and shall be regulated\n      pursuant to Statewide Rule 36.\n\n             Done this 6th day of August, 2013.\n\n                                                  RAILROAD COMMISSION OF TEXAS\n\n                                                  (Order approved and signatures affixed by\n                                                  Hearings Division's Unprotested Master\n                                                  Order dated August 6, 2013)\n\n\n\n\n102\n\f      TAB 5\nAffidavit of John McBeath\n\f                                         CAUSE NO. 13-05-0466-CVA\n\n      SHIRLEY ADAMS, CHARLENE                                     IN THE DISTRICT COURT\n      BURGESS, WILLIE MAY HERBST\n      JASIK, WILLIAM ALSBERT HERBST,\n      HELEN HERBST and\n      R.

My employer, Platt Sparks is a petroleum engineering consulting firm that provides\n\n            consulting services to its clients in the oil and gas industry with regard to a wide array of\n\n            oil and gas related issues including, but not limited to, regulatory compliance and filings,\n\n            reservoir engineering studies, log analysis, reserve determination, economic analysis, fair\n\n            market value determinations, reservoir simulation, damage analysis, and lease royalty\n\n            provision analysis. A significant portion of my practice involves advising clients with\n\n            respect to Eagle Ford Shale (\"EFS\") formation exploration and development issues. I\n\n           have numerous clients involved in this trend and routinely advise them on issues such as\n\n           permitting wells, regulatory compliance, operational issues and other petroleum\n\n           engineering matters. As such, I am familiar with terminology and issues applicable to\n\n           operations within the EFS.\n\n      4.   I am a 1987 graduate of the University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor of Science\n\n           degree in Petroleum Engineering. I am a licensed Professional Engineer in Texas,\n\n           Wyoming, and California, a member of the Society of Petrophysicists and Well Log\n\n           Analysts, and a member of the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers. A copy of\n\n           my resume is attached as Exhibit JCM 1.\n\n      5.   I have reviewed PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n\n           dated September 5, 2013.. I have been asked by counsel for Murphy to respond to\n\n           Plaintiffs' assertion that the Herbst B 1H Well is not an \"offset well\" under paragraph 25\n\n           of the leases at issue. (\"Shirley Lease\" and \"William Lease\") Specifically, I have been\n\n           asked whether the term \"offset well\" is a specialized term within the industry, and if so,\n\n           whether it has a commonly understand meaning within the industry.\n\n      6.

The EFS is a formation that underlies much of South Texas. It lies directly below the\n\n           Austin Chalk formation and has long been recognized as the hydrocarbon source rock for\n\n           the Austin Chalk. The EFS lies directly above the Buda Limestone formation. The EFS\n\n           varies in thickness from 20 feet to over 500 feet and in quality from top to bottom with\n\n           the Upper portion being carbonate-rich and the Lower portion shale-rich. The productive\n\n           part of the EFS is divided into oil, wet gas and dry gas areas. Exhibit ICM 1 contains a\n\n           map from the Energy Information Administration (\"EIA\") showing the different\n\n           producing areas of the EFS. Although a few wells historically produced from the\n\n           formation, development began in earnest in 2008 with the drilling of wells in La Salle\n\n           County by PetroHawk. These wells were the discovery of the Hawkville (Eagle Ford)\n\n           Field. Development has continued through current with most activity concentrated in the\n\n           oil and wet gas windows due to attractive liquids prices. Drilling efficiency has\n\n           improved significantly as well as the fine tuning of hydraulic fracture stimulation\n\n           treatments. Current development includes twenty-six Counties located in six RRC\n\n\n      AFFIDAVIT OF JOHN C. McBEATH, P.E.                                            Page 3\n\n174\n\f            districts. Exhibit JCM 3 is map from the RRC website showing the EFS development as\n\n            of January 2014.\n\n      8.    The Lucas \"A\" 1H well was drilled by Comstock Oil & Gas, LP in December 2011,\n\n            targeting the EFS. The RRC well completion papers and directional surveys all indicate\n\n            that the horizontal lateral was landed in the EFS. The form W-2 filed by Comstock\n\n            indicates that the well was completed on February 23, 2012. Exhibit JCM 4 is a\n\n            collection of RRC forms relating to the Lucas \"A\" 1H well. I have also reviewed the\n\n            RRC completion papers and directional survey for the Murphy Herbst B 1H well.\n\n            Drilling was initiated on Murphy's Herbst B 1H well on June 8, 2012. The Herbst well\n\n            horizontal lateral was also completed in the EFS. Exhibit JCM 5 is a collection of RRC\n\n            forms relating to the Herbst B 1H well.\n\n      9.    Drilling began on the Murphy Herbst 13 1H well less than 120 days after the Comstock\n\n            Lucas \"A\" 1H well was completed.\n\n      10.   Based on the information contained in the Affidavit of Mr. Kane Heinen, it is clear that\n\n            the Herbst B 1H well was drilled by Murphy to fulfill their obligation under paragraph 25\n\n            of the Shirley and Williams leases.\n\n      11.   The Murphy Herbst B 1H well was drilled to a depth adequate to test the same formatidn\n\n            from which the Comstock Lucas \"A\" 1H well produces.\n\n      12.   Based on my review of Plaintiffs' petition and motion for summary judgment, it is my\n\n            understanding that Plaintiffs contend that the Murphy Herbst B 1H well is not an offset\n\n            well to the Lucas \"A\" 1FI well because it is not as close as legally possible to the lease\n\n            line of the Lucas \"A\" lease. Plaintiffs' use of the term \"offset well\" is not consistent with\n\n            the industry use of the term.\n\n\n      AFFIDAVIT OF JOHN C. McBEATH, P.E.                                                  Page 4\n\n175\n\f      13.   The term \"offset well\" is a specialized term within the oil and gas industry and is\n\n            commonly understood within the industry as describing any well drilled on an adjacent\n\n            lease or property. The term \"offset well\" can also refer to the closest well, even if it is\n\n            located on another lease. It is my opinion that Plaintiffs are viewing the term \"offset\n\n            well,\" as used in paragraph 25 of the Lease, as \"direct offset well\". A direct offset well is\n\n            also a specialized term within the oil and gas industry, and is commonly understood to be\n\n            a well that is located directly across a lease line or other legal boundary. A direct offset\n\n            well can be located at the closest legal location or even closer if the operator applies for\n\n            and receives an RRC Rule 37 exception. A direct offset well is sometime called an\n\n            immediate offset well. Direct offset wells and immediate offset wells are included within\n\n            the term offset wells, but not all offset wells are direct or immediate offset wells.\n\n      14.   The term \"offset well\" is used in RRC Rule 36 to define which wells can be used to\n\n            estimate the escape rate for use in calculating a radius of exposure for a well subject to\n\n            Rule 36. The RRC has never limited the wells available in this determination to wells\n\n            directly across the lease line, and Rule 36 is further evidence of how the term offset well\n\n            is understood within the industry.\n\n      15.   RRC form H-1, related to RRC Rule 46, shows that the term \"offset well\" is understoOd\n\n            within the industry to describe any well drilled on adjacent property. The H-1 form\n\n            requires offset wells within Y2 mile of the subject well to be identified on a map.\n\n      16.   Finally, RRC Proposals for Decisions (\"PFD\") and Final Orders (\"FO\") XX-XXXXXXX, 8A-\n\n            0211820, XX-XXXXXXX and 7C-0240684 contain further examples of the RRC's use of the\n\n            terms offset well, direct offset well and immediate offset well. These PFDs and FOs\n\n            further confirm that each of these specialized terms have a commonly understood\n\n\n      AFFIDAVIT OF JOHN C. McBEATH, P.E.                                                   Page 5\n\n176\n\f            industry meaning, and that the term \"offset well\" is any well located on an adjacent\n\n            property, not just a well located directly across the lease line at the closest legal location.\n\n            That is a \"direct offset well.\"\n\n      17.   Based on my experience working with operators and other participants within the\n\n            industry, the usage of these terms by the RRC is consistent with how the terms are\n\n            commonly understood within the industry.\n\n      18.   I have reviewed the Shirley lease, dated August 14, 2009, and it is my opinion that the\n\n            Lease was drafted specifically for horizontal drilling in the EFS. The lease contains\n\n            specific language regarding horizontal wells and the size of pooled units associated with\n\n            horizontal wells. By August 2009, there was significant EFS development activity\n\n            nearby in Live Oak and Karnes Counties.\n\n      19.   Plaintiffs' contention that an offset well, as used in the Lease, exists to protect their\n\n            acreage from drainage is not correct. Due to the reservoir characteristics of the EFS, the\n\n            formation will not produce without large multi-stage hydraulic fracture jobs that provide\n\n            pathways between the formation and the wellbore. In the early development of the trend,\n\n            it was recognized that even with these hydraulic fracture stimulation jobs, a relatively\n\n            modest amount of reservoir is drained by each horizontal well. The RRC assigned leae\n\n            line spacing rules that reflect this reality. Recently, several operators have installed pilot\n\n            programs to test the sensitivity of well spacing to well recoveries. Early indications\n\n            confirm that spacing horizontal laterals as close as 225 feet results in well recoveries\n\n            comparable to much wider spaced laterals.\n\n\n\n\n      AFFIDAVIT OF JOHN C. McI3EATH, P.E.                                                  Page 6\n177\n\f      20.   The reservoir characteristics of the EFS further support my conclusion that the\n\n            specialized term \"offset well,\" as used in Paragraph 25 of the Lease, is not commonly\n\n            understood as a well drilled within 350 feet of the Lease line, as Plaintiffs contend.\n\n      21.   Plaintiffs refer to Williams and Meyers' Manual of Oil & Gas Terms for the definition of\n\n            Offset Clause. The definition of Offset Clause refers to Offset Well, another definition in\n\n            Williams & Meyers. Although Williams and Meyers states that the Offset Well is\n\n            intended to prevent drainage, neither definitions refer to a specific distance requirement\n\n            for an Offset Well. As stated above, the conventional concept of drainage across lease\n\n            lines has limited application in the EFS. Williams & Meyers offset well definition does\n\n            refer to \"direct offsetting\" when discussing wells that are directly across lease line on\n\n            equal-sized spacing units. Plaintiffs also refer to two on-line dictionaries having the same\n\n            definition of offset well. Before reading the Plaintiffs' motion I had not encountered\n\n            these sources. As stated above, it is my opinion that the term offset well encompasses the\n\n            more narrowly defined direct offset well. The on-line definitions used by Plaintiffs' more\n\n            accurately describe direct offset wells. My personal copy of \"A Dictionary of Petroleum\n\n            Terms\" 2\" ed. contains the following definition:\n\n                   offset well n: a well drilled on a tract of land next to another owner's tract on\n                   which there is a producing well.\n\n      22.   Based on my review of the information discussed above and my professional experience\n\n            in the industry for the past 25 years, it is my opinion that the Herbst B 1H well drilled by\n\n            Murphy on the Shirley and William leases is an offset well as that term is commonly\n\n            understood and used in the industry and paragraph 25 of the leases.\n\n\n\n\n      AFFIDAVIT OF JOHN C.

Regency also requests that a new field, the Tilden,S. (Wilcox H2S Disposal)\n      Field, be set up for this disposal well. A permit for injection pursuant to Statewide Rule 46\n      can be administratively granted. However, Statewide Rule 36(c)(10)(A) requires that a\n      public hearing be held before the injection of fluid containing hydrogen sulfide (\" H2S\" or\n      \"sour gas\").\n\n             The Commission's Field Operations section has reviewed the application and\n      contingency plan and recommends approval of the application contingent on the following\n      conditions:\n\n             1.     That a new field designation is approved for the well, with such field name\n                    reflecting the potential presence of H2S in this area; and\n\n\n             2.     That Regency demonstrates through plume analysis and offset well\n                    construction/plugging evaluation that the injected fluids will be confined to the\n                    proposed disposal zone.\n\n                                                                                             EXHIBIT\n\n247\n\f                               •                                       •\n      Oil & Gas Docket No. XX-XXXXXXX                                                        Page 2\n\n       '    This application was unprotested and the examiner recommends approval of the\n      Rule 36 and Rule 46 authority.\n\n                                  DISCUSSION OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n             Regency's Tilden Gas Processing Plant has been in operation for many years,\n      removing carbon dioxide (\"CO2\") and 112S from the gas stream produced by wells in the\n      area. The waste CO2 and •H2S gas has been flared under TCEQ authority. Regency is\n      proposing that this waste gas, or acid gas, be compressed into a liquid and disposed of into\n      the proposed Tilden GPI No. 1. The Tilden GPI No. 1 has not yet been drilled, but is\n      proposed to be located within the fenced area of the Tilden plant.\n\n             Regency requests authority to dispose of a maximum of 1,924 BPD of compressed\n      acid gas. This is the equivalent of approximately 5,000 MCFD. The requested maximum\n      surface injection pressure is 2,925 psig.\n\n               The Tilden GPI No. 1 will be drilled to a total depth of approximately 6,900 feet. The\n      well will have three strings of casing cemented to surface: 13 3/s\" to 350 feet, 9 %\" to 5,200\n      feet and 5W' to total depth. The TCEQ recommends that useable quality water be\n      protected to a depth of 100 feet and that the Carrizo be protected between 4,400 feet and\n      5,100 feet. Injection will be through tubing set on a packer at approximately 5,800 feet.\n      All of the tubular equipment which may come in contact with H2S are H2S-resistant stainless\n      steels and alloys that meet all Commission and industry standards for handling H2S.\n\n              The proposed disposal interval is the Wilcox between 5,870 feet and 6,800 feet.\n      This zone has not been produced in any well within a /z mile radius but the application was\n      filed pursuant to Rule 46 because Regency has not established that there is no production\n      from this interval within. 21/2 miles. Establishing a new field designation called Tilden, S.\n      (Wilcox H2S Disposal). Field will identify the proposed disposal zone as a formation now\n      containing hydrogen sulfide. Any operators drilling in the area will be aware of the potential\n      of H2S existing in an otherwise non-sour formation.\n\n             There are 11 wellbores within 1/2 mile of the proposed well. Three of the wells did\n      not penetrate the proposed Wilcox disposal interval. Of the eight wells which penetrated\n      the disposal interval, four were dry holes with no production casing set. All four of these\n      wells have cement plugs across the base of useable quality water. The four remaining\n      wells have production casing cemented to surface from deeper horizons. The completion\n      and/or plugging of these wells is such that the proposed disposal will not affect useable\n      quality water.\n\n              To estimate reservoir parameters at the location of the proposed Tilden GPI No. 1,\n      Regency analyzed the log of the Vaughn Petroleum Company - J.M. Dickinson No. 2. This\n      well is the closest well which penetrated the disposal interval and is approximately 1,600\n      feet to the southwest of the proposed disposal well. The Dickinson No. 2 was drilled in\n      1970 to a total depth of approximately 6,900 feet and was plugged and abandoned as a dry\n\n\n\n248\n\f                                  •\n        Oil & Gas Docket No. XX-XXXXXXX                                                           Page 3\n\n       hole. In the Dickinson No. 2, the average porosity of the Wilcox interval proposed for\n       disposal is 17% over 117 feet of thickness. Average permeability is 10.8 md. The log of\n       this well indicates the presence of at least 250 feet of shale overlying the disposal interval\n       and at least 100 feet of shale below the disposal interval. These shale barriers will prevent\n       the migration of acid gas from the disposal zone. Regency submitted two cross-sections\n       of area wells demonstrating that both the proposed disposal interval and the confining shale\n       barriers are continuous across the area.\n\n              Computer simulations of pressure and fluid migration were performed to predict the\n       maximum probable extent of waste migrations. The numerical model SWIFT was used for\n       the predictions. Input data included . the porosity and thickness determined from the\n       Dickinson No. 2 well, a project life of 40 years, and an average daily rate of 2,100 BPD\n       (which exceeds the requested rate of 1,924 BPD). This model has been accepted\n       nationally for hazardous waste wells by the EPA and has been previously accepted by the\n       Railroad Commission.\n\n               The initial pressure in the proposed disposal interval is assumed to be 3,400 psi.\n       After 40 years.of injection, the pressure increase near the wellbore is calculated to be 3,975\n       psi. Approximately one mile away, the pressure is predicted to be 3,725 Psi after 40 years\n       of injection.\n\n               The waste being disposed of consists of approximately 34% hydrogen sulfide, 64%\n       carbon dioxide and 2% natural gas. Acid gas concentrations were calculated and mapped\n       based on the modeling. The outer edge of the injection plume is represented by a. 1%\n       contour line, where the fluid is 99% formation fluid and 1% acid gas. The maximum extent\n       of this 1% line is 2,200 feet from the injection well after 40 years of injection. There are five\n       vvellbores within 2,200 feet of the proposed well. Two of the five wells within 2,200 feet did\n       not penetrate the disposal interval. Another two of the five wells have production casing\n       cemented through the disposal.interval. The fifth well within 2,200 feet is the Dickinson No.\n       2 drilled in 1970 to a total depth of 6,913 feet. This well has no production casing but has\n       a plug set at 4,960 feet and at 5,409 feet. The only interval open in the Dickinson No. 2 is\n       the proposed Wilcox disposal interval, about 300 feet of shale above the disposal interval,\n       and about 100 feet of shale below the disposal interval. Therefore, no existing wellbore\n       within the injection, plume will be a conduit for migration of injected fluid outside the disposal\n       interval.\n\n                 To estimate maximum blowout release rate and pressures, Regency employed\n        Fekete Associates, Inc. Fekete's study assumes that the acid gas injection well has been\n      . drilled, completed and is actively injecting, prior to a loss-of-control incident at the wellhead.\n        Worst case conditions are also assumed. The results of the study indicate a maximum\n        escape rate through the 27/8\" tubing of 14 MMCFD. Similarly, if the loss-of-control events\n        occurs through the 5%\" casing, the maximum escape rate would be 21.5 MMCFD.\n\n             Regency employed Quest Consultants, Inc. to perform gas dispersion modeling\n       based on the results of the maximum escape rates previously determined by Fekete.\n\n\n\n249\n\f                               •                                       •\n      Oil & Gas Docket No. XX-XXXXXXX                                                        Page 4\n      Quest used a dispersion model called CANARY to determine the radius of exposure\n      (\"ROE\") to. H2S. This model calculates release conditions, initial dilution of the vapor, and\n      subsequent vapor dispersion. The model accounts for thermodynamics, mixture behavior,\n      transient release rates, gas cloud density, initial velocity of the gas and heat transfer\n      effects. This model has been previously accepted by the Railroad Commission. The\n      calculated ROE for 100 ppm H2S, due to the maximum catastrophic release on the\n      proposed injection well, is 2,655 feet. For 500 ppm, the calculated ROE is 1,495 feet. Both\n      of these calculated ROE's are already within the area covered by the approved\n      contingency plan for the Tilden Gas Processing Plant.\n\n              Regency has modified the contingency plan for the Tilden Gas Processing Plant to\n      incorporate the proposed disposal operations. There are no residences or public places\n      within the 100 ppm ROE for the disposal well and no public roads within the 500 ppm ROE\n      for the well. The contingency plan for the plant covers a much larger area.\n\n             The injection system is designed with numerous safeguards. The wellhead will be\n      equipped with emergency shut-down valves and down-hole check valves will be installed\n      to prevent surface flow through the tubing. The tubing and casing pressure, tubing and\n      casing temperature, injection rate, and H2S detection equipment will be continuously\n      monitored. The gas processing plant is manned 24 hours a day with personnel trained in\n      the recognition of and response to H2S alarms.\n\n                                          FINDINGS OF FACT\n\n      1.     Notice of this application to inject fluid containing hydrogen sulfide was issued to all.\n             surface owners and offsetting operators within % mile of the proposed well, and the\n             McMullen County Clerk.on September 22, 2006.

Notice of the application was published in The Progress, a newspaper of general\n            circulation in McMullen County, Texas, on September 20, September 27, October\n            4, and October 11, 2006.\n\n      3.    The proposed injection well, the Tilden GPI Well No. 1, will dispose of compressed\n            waste gas containing H2S. This waste gas is removed from hydrocarbon gas at\n            Regency's Tilden Gas Processing Plant.\n\n      4.    The Tilden GPI No. 1 will inject at rates up to 1,924 BPD of compressed acid gas.\n            This is the equivalent of approximately 5,000 MCFD. This acid gas contains\n            approximately 34% hydrogen sulfide, 64% carbon dioxide and 2% natural gas.\n\n      5.    The proposed Tilden GPI No. 1 will be drilled, cased and cemented to confine the\n            injected fluid to the proposed Wilcox disposal zone.\n\n             a.     The requested injection interval is the Wilcox between 5,870 feet and 6,800\n                    feet. This interval has not been completed in any well within 1/2 mile.\n\n\n\n250\n\f                               •                                       •\n      Oil & Gas Docket No. XX-XXXXXXX                                                        Page 5\n\n\n            b.     The TCEQ recommends that useable quality water be protected to a depth\n                   of 100 feet and that the Carrizo be protected between 4,400 feet and 5,100\n                   feet.\n\n            c.     The well will have three strings of casing cemented to surface: 13 3/8\" to 350\n                   feet, 9 W to 5,200 feet and 5W to total depth.\n\n            d.     Injection will be through tubing set on a packer at approximately 5,800 feet.\n\n            e.     All of the equipment installed that might come in contact with H2S will be\n                   stainless steel and alloys that meet all Commission and industry safety\n                   standards.\n\n            f.     If the injection fluid is not confined to the approved strata, then the disposal\n                   well permit will be suspended and disposal cease until the fluid 'migration\n                   from such strata is eliminated.\n\n      6.    The field name of Tilden, S. (Wilcox H2S Disposal) should be approved for the\n            disposal interval to alert other operators in the area to the possibility of encountering\n            sour gas in this otherwise non-sour formation.\n\n      7.    The disposal well is inside the fenced area which surrounds the Tilden Gas\n            Processing Plant.\n\n      8.    The requested maximum surface injection pressure is 2,925 psig.\n\n      9.    The injection well, compressor and flow lines transmitting sour gas, will be designed\n            to contain the sour gas, and monitoring devices will immediately shut down the\n            system if any leakage of sour gas is detected.\n\n      10.   The proposed disposal well is within the area covered by the contingency plan for\n            the processing plant.\n\n      11.   The calculated ROE for 100 ppm H2S due to a catastrophic release from the well is\n            2,655,2feet. The calculated exposure radius ROE for 500 ppm H2S due to a\n            catastrophic release from the well is 1,495 feet.\n\n      12.   There are no residences or public places within the 100 ppm ROE for the disposal\n            well and no public roads within the 500 ppm ROE for the well.\n\n      13.   No existing well will be a conduit for migration of injected fluid outside the disposal\n            interval.\n\n            a.     The maximum extent of the 1% acid gas plume is 2,200 feet from the\n\n\n\n251\n\f      Oil & Gas Docket No. XX-XXXXXXX                                                        Page.6\n\n                   injection well after 40 years of injection.\n\n            b.     There are five wellbores within 2,200 feet of the proposed well.\n\n            c.     Two of the five wells within 2,200 feet did not penetrate the disposal interval.\n\n            d.     Two of the five wells within 2,200 feet have production casing cemented\n                   through the disposal interval.\n\n            e.     The fifth well within 2,200 feet is the Dickinson No. 2 drilled in 1970 to a total\n                   depth of 6,913 feet. This well has no production casing but has a plug set at\n                   4,960 feet and at 5,409 feet. The only interval open in the Dickinson No. 2\n                   is the proposed Wilcox disposal interval, about 300 feet of shale above the\n                   disposal interval, and about 100 feet of shale below the disposal interval.\n\n      14.   Regency has met the conditions for approval' set forth by the Field Operations\n            section of the Railroad Commission.\n\n                                      CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\n      1.    Proper notice was issued as applicable in all statutes and regulatory codes.\n\n      2.    Altthings have.occurred and been accomplished to give the Commission jurisdiction\n            in this matter.\n\n      3.    The application of Regency FS LP to inject hydrogen sulfide gas into the Tilden GPI\n            No. 1, Tilden, S. (Wilcox H2S Disposal) Field, McMullen County, complies with the\n            applicable provisions of Statewide Rules 46 and 36, 16 T.A.C. §3.46 and §3.36.\n\n                                EXAMINER'S RECOMMENDATION\n\n            Based on the above findings and conclusions, the examiner recommends that the\n      application of Regency FS LP be APPROVED. A new field designation of Tilden, S.\n      (Wilcox H2S Disposal) Field should be approved for the disposal interval.\n\n                                                        Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n                                                        Donna K.

Coastal\n      requests a Rule 37 permit for the following fields: the Jeffress, N.E. (Vicksburg Lo)\n      Field, which is the primary objective; the Jeffress, N.E. (T, Lo-FB,A) Field; the\n      Jeffress, N.E. (Vicksburg T) Field; the Jeffress, N.E. Nicks. T-Lower) Field; the\n      Jeffress, N.E. (Vicksburg L.) Field; and Wildcat (above 16,500').\n\n             Coastal proposes to locate the well 349' from its nearest lease line, whereas\n      field rules for all applied-for fields require a distance of 467'. Therefore, a Rule 37\n      exception is necessary.\n\n              Coastal's application is protested by Coates Energy, Trust (\"Coates\"). Coates\n      owns a royalty interest and appears to own an unleased mineral interest below\n      13,710' under an immediately offsetting tract.      Initially, Coastal challenged Coates'\n      standing to protest but withdrew its objection after conceding that Coates probably\n      has mineral ownership below • 13,710' on the tract to the east of the Adame Gas Unit.\n      Coates also claims ownership of a strip of land within the Adame Gas Unit on its\n      eastern edge. .This claim has resulted in a title dispute between Coastal and Coates\n      that is now before the courts. The proposed well is not located on this disputed strip.\n\n             Before presenting its technical case on the merits, Coastal established its good\n      faith claim to title to the disputed strip through deeds, oil and gas leases, and an\n      affidavit of adverse possession. Coates did not contend that Coastal failed to prove\n      a -good faith claim to title.    The parties recognize that the title question must be\n      resolved by the courts.\n\n\n                                  DISCUSSION OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n            Coastal presented the only evidence concerning the merits of its Rule 37\n      application. Its case is based on conftcation; the issue of waste was not addressed.\n\n             The primary target, the Jeffress, N.E. (Vicksburg Lo) Field, was referred to\n      throughout the hearing as the \"W\" sand. The lower Vicksburg in Hidalgo County is\n      composed of a sequence of sands amid a series of down-to-the-basin and antithetic\n      faults. Coastal designated four sand objectives in this area, the \"W\" sand being the\n      deepest at approximately 13,400'.\n\n             The original recoverable reserves under the Adame Gas Unit in the \"W\" sand\n      were 7.3 billion cubic feet (\"BCF\") of gas. Decline curve analysis indicates that the\n      existing well, the Adame Well No. 1, will ultimately recover only 2 BCF. Because of\n      faulting in the upper lobe of the \"W\" sand, approximately 240' of section is missing\n      from the Adame Well No. 1. Therefore, the net pay that is characteristic of that upper\n      lobe in surrounding wells is not available to the Adame Well No. 1. An offset well, the\n      Coastal E-1, is draining the area of the proposed well on the Adame Gas Unit.\n      Ultimately, if this drainage continues unchecked, the Coastal E-1 will recover\n\n\n\n\n259\n\f      Rule 37 Case No. 0213270                                                           Page 3\n\n      approximately 2.9 BCF from under the Adame Gas Unit.            (Total recovery for the\n      Coastal E-1 is estimated to be 10.5 BCF.) There remain current recoverable reserves\n      under the Adame Gas Unit that will be unrecovered by Coastal if Coastal does not\n      drill a second well on The unit. Royalty owners within the Adame Gas Unit do not\n      participate in production in the \"W\" sand from any offset well.\n\n             There are no regular locations that will afford the mineral owners an opportunity\n      to .recover their share of the hydrocarbons in the \"W\" sand. Due to extensive faulting\n      in the area, a regular location to the east of the proposed location would encounter\n      the downthrown side of Fault \"E\". All regular locations in the southern portion of the\n      Adame Gas Unit fall in the middle of Fault \"D\".\n\n              If Coastal drilled at these regular locations, it would again lose a large section\n      of the \"W\" sand, with significant. decrease in the well's recoverable reserves. This\n      loss of a large section of the reservoir combined with reduced net pay (less than 50')\n      as one moves west in the reservoir on the southern portion of .the tract make it\n      impossible for applicant to recover its fair share from this portion of the tract. The net\n      pay is approximately 50' at the proposed location.\n\n\n                                       EXAMINERS' OPINION\n\n             The examiners are of the opinion that an additional well on the Adame Gas Unit\n      is necessary to protect the correlative rights of the Adame royalty owners, who do not\n      share in production 'from the \"W\" sand from any offset well. Because of loss of a\n      section of reservoir due to the fault, the existing well will recover only 2 BCF of the\n      recoverable gas of 7.3 BCF under the Adame Gas Unit.\n\n             A Rule 37. location is necessary. Wells at regular locations would encounter\n      the numerous faults and consequent loss of a portiori of the reservoir.        At such\n      locations Coastal and its royalty owners would not have an opportunity to recover the\n      hydrocarbons under the Adame Gas Unit.            The proposed_ Rule 37 location is\n      reasonable. It is a location that offsets the Coastal El well and counters the ongoing\n      drainage of. the Adame Gas Unit on the \"W\" sand.              The proposed location is\n      approximately 900' from the Adame Gas Unit's east lease line, which separates the\n      applicant's and protestant's leases.\n\n             Coastal did not present any evidence of the amount of recoverable reserves\n      under the Adame Gas Unit in the Jeffress, N.E. (T, LO.-FB,A), Jeffress, N.E.\n      (Vicksburg T), Jeffress, N.E. (Vicksburg T Lo), and Jeffress, N.E. (Vicksburg L) Fields.\n      Similarly, Coastal did not present any evidence that a well at a regular location could\n      not produce Coastal's fair share of these reserves.\n\n\n\n                                        FINDINGS OF FACT\n\n      1.    At least ten (10) days notice of hearing was sent to all designated operators,\n\n\n\n\n260\n\f          Rule 37 Case No. 0213270                                                          Page 4\n\n                lessees of record for tracts having no designated operator, and owners of\n                record of unleased mineral interests, for each adjacent tract and each tract\n                nearer than 467' to the applicant's proposed well.\n\n          2.    Coastal Oil and Gas Corporation, the applicant herein, has requested on Form\n                W-1 a Rule 37 exception to drill Well No. 2 on the Adame Gas Unit in Hidalgo\n                County, Texas. The proposed well will be 349' from the nearest lease line,\n                whereas field rules for the applied-for fields require a ,distance of 467'.\n\n          3.    Coastal's application is for the following primary objective:      Jeffress, N.E.\n                (Vicksburg Lo) Field (\"the \"W\" sand\"). Secondary objectives are Jeffress, N.E.\n                (T, LoFB,A), Jeffress, N.E. (Vicksburg T), Jeffress, N.E. Nicks. T-Lower),\n•               Jeffress, N.E. (Vicksburg L.), and Wildcat (above 16,500') Fields.\n\n          4.    The existing.. well, the Adame No. 1, is incapable of producing all of the\n                recoverable gas under the Adame Unit in the \"W\" sand.\n\n                a.     The Adame Well No. 1 is expected to produce ultimately approximately\n                       2 BCF of gas. Ultimate recoveries by adjacent wells producing from the\n                       \"W\" sand range from 19 BCF to 10.4 BCF.\n\n                b.     The poor performance of the Adame No. 1 relative to the other wells in\n                       the field is attributable to a fault cut in the \"W\" sand.\n\n          5.    A well at any regular location on the Adame Gas Unit could also be expected\n                to be cut by a fault, lose a portion of the reservoir, and not recover the tract's\n                reserves.\n\n          6.    There are recoverable gas reserves of approximately 7.3 BCF under the\n                Adame Gas Unit. The existing well will not recover 5.3 BCF under the Adame\n                Gas Unit.\n\n          7.    A well at the proposed location is necessary to allow penetration of the entire\n                \"W\" sand interval and is necessary to give the mineral interest owners of the\n                Adame tract a reasonable opportunity to recover the reserves under the tract.\n\n          8.    Royalty owners of the Adame Gas Unit do not participate in production in the\n                \"W\" sand from any adjacent well.\n\n          9.    Regular locations exist on the Adame Gas Unit, and there is insufficient\n                evidence that a Rule 37 location \"is necessary to recover the reserves, which\n                were not quantified, in the Jeffress, N.E.

Proper notice was issued timely to all persons legally entitled to notice.\n\n      2.    All things have been done or have occurred to give the Railroad Commission\n            jurisdiction to decide this matter.\n\n      3.    The applicant proved that Well No. 2 at the proposed Rule 37 exception .\n            location is necessary, to give the mineral owners of the Adame. Gas Unit an\n            opportunity to recover their fair share of the hydrocarbons from the Jeffress\n            N.E. (Vicksburg Lo) and Wildcat (above 16,500') Fields.\n\n      4.

(\"Applicant\" or \"Encore\") seeks an exception to Statewide Rule 37\n      to drill Well No. 2 on the Vada Bean Lease as a gas well in the Ozona (Canyon Sand) Field.' The\n      Vada Bean Lease is a narrow rectangular shaped 63.30 acre tract with no locations regular to lease\n      line spacing requirements in the Ozona (Canyon Sand) Field due to the configuration of the lease.\n      Encore previously drilled the Vada Bean No. 1 Well on the southernmost 40 acres of the lease, 938\n      feet south of the proposed location for the Vada Bean No. 2. The proposed well will be located 275\n      feet from the eastern lease line and 2.54 feet from the western lease line on the remaining 23.30\n      acres.' The proposed well is regular to all other lease line boundaries. A copy of the plat filed with\n      Applicant's W-1 Application for Permit to Drill, Deepen, Plug.Back or Re-Enter is attached. The\n      Ozona (Canyon. Sand) Field is subject to spacing requirements of 467 feet minimum distance to the\n      nearest lease line and 1200 feet minimum distance between wells for oil wells and 660 feet\n      minimum distance to the nearest lease line and 933 feet minimum distance between wells for gas\n      wells.\n\n           The application is protested by Devon Energy Production, L.P. (\"Devon\"), the offset\n  • operator of the adjacent eastern tract. The offset operator to the west did not protest Encore's\n    application.\n\n                                             APPLICANT'S POSITION AND EVIDENCE\n\n              Encore claims that the applied-for well is necessary to prevent confiscation as its existing\n      Well No. '1 will not recover its fair share of the remaining recoverable natural gas underlying the\n      Vada Bean Lease. Encore also claims that the proposed well would produce a significant volume\n      of natural gas underlying the northernmost 23 acres of the Vada Bean Lease in the Ozona (Canyon\n      Sand) Field which would not be recovered by either any existing wells or wells which would be\n      located at any regular location, thereby warranting an exception permit to prevent waste.\n\n              With respect to its confiscation argument, Encore's volumetric analysis estimates that\n      between 2.2 Bcf and .365 Bcf. f natural gas underlying its Vada Bean Lease will not be recovered\n      from the existing Vada Bean No. 1 Well. For its high end estimate, Encore believes that the low\n      permeability in the Ozona (Canyon Sand) Field, prevented any offsetting wells from draining\n      reserves from the Vada Bean Lease. Encore therefore asserts that the original recoverable gas in\n      place of 3.2 Bcf, less the estimated cumulative reserves which will be recovered from the Vada Bean\n      No. 1 Well of .97 Bcf, is a proper measure for calculating its fair share of reserves currently\n      underlying its lease.\n\n\n                 t Field Rules for the Ozona (Canyon Sand) Field reference both the oil field rules and the gas field rules. Encore's\n      presentation and all evidence was limited to the drilling of a gas well, accordingly the proposed final order is limited to a gas\n      well at the proposed location.\n                2\n                  The Field Rules for gas wells in the Ozona (Canyon Sand) Field allow for 320 acre units, with optional 40 acre units.\n      Statewide Rule 38(c) allows for \"tolerance wells\", without a density exception, if the remaining acreage on a lease is equal or\n      greater to 50% of the smallest amount established for an optional drilling unit.\n\n\n\n\n265\n\f      RULE 37 CASE No. 0240684                                                                                                   Page 3\n\n\n\n\n             In support of the high estimate, Encore contends that its Vada Bean No. 1 Well came in at\n      or near virgin reservoir pressure. Assuming virgin pressure of 2604 psig as the bottomhole\n      pressure, the calculated recoverable reserves of the Veda Bean Lease under original conditions were\n      3.2 Bcf. Encore believes a well at the proposed location will also encounter virgin reservoir\n      conditions due to the low reservoir permeability.\n\n               With respect to its low estimate of .365 Bcf, Encore's volumetric analysis uses a reservoir\n      pressure of 1530 psig to calculate the remaining recoverable reserves. This pressure was calculated\n      from the shut-in tubing pressure test measured in Encore's Vada Bean No. 1 Well after it had\n      produced for three days. Encore does not believe that the shut-in tubing pressure test accurately\n      reflects current reservoir conditions as the test was not performed over a long enough period of time.\n      Encore suggests that an accurate test in such a tight formation would require a well to be shut in for\n      several hundred hours. Using 1530 psig in Encore's volumetric calculations yields an estimate of\n      recoverable gas in place of 1.336 Bcf. Subtracting the estimated cumulative recovery from the Vada\n      Bean No. 1 Well of . 972 Bcf yields a remainder of .365 Bcf of recoverable reserves that will not\n      be produced by the existing well.\n\n             Encore also relies on maps depicting the drainage patterns .of the existing wells on and\n      adjacent to its Vada Bean Lease to support its case. Based on these maps, Encore asserts that the\n      acreage in the northern end of the Vada Bean Lease has not and will not be drained by its existing\n      well, other existing wells offsetting its lease, or any well which would be drilled at a regular\n      location.\n\n              Encore's volumetric analysis relies on a phi h3 isopach map derived from its geologic\n      interpretation of reservoir and digital log analyses estimating the total net pay encountered from a\n      cross section of wells completed in the Ozona (Canyon Sand) Field, including its Vada Bean No.\n      1 Well. Encore contends that a high phi h value for the Vada Bean No. 1 Well is justified by the\n      current production from that well, which came in among the top wells in the field. Encore also\n      presented a decline curve analysis for its existing Vada Bean No. 1 well to show that the estimated\n      cumulative recovery from that well will only be .972 Bcf. Finally, Encore further asserts that the\n      location is reasonable because there are no regular locations on the tract and the location is roughly\n      equidistant between the eastern and western lease lines.\n\n               Encore also claims that Devon's competing phi h isopach map does not accurately depict the\n      Ozona (Canyon Sand) Field, pointing out several inaccuracies in contouring and reported phi h\n      values for individual wells. Encore also asserts that Devon's volumetric analysis is flawed because\n      it relies on an inaccurate 24 hour pressure test result reported from Devon's Vada Bean No. 12 well.\n\n\n\n\n               3\n                  Phi h is a dimensionless number calculated by multiplying the number of feet of net pay by the estimated porosity in\n      that net pay.\n\n\n\n\n266\n\f                                                                           •\n      RULE 37 CASE No. 0240684                                                                       Page 4\n\n\n\n                                  PROTESTANT'S POSITION AND EVIDENCE\n\n              Devon contends that Encore has.overestimated the amount of remaining recoverable natural\n      gas underlying the Vada Bean Lease in the Ozona (Canyon Sand) Field. Devon argues that using\n      Encore's own decline curve analysis with a volumetric analysis based on more current pressure data,\n      Encore's Vada Bean No. I Well will ultimately recover more than its fair share of the remaining\n      recoverable natural gas underlying the Vada Bean Lease.\n\n              Devon did not offer a competing geologic interpretation for the depositional environment\n      or a top of structure map for the Ozona (Canyon Sand) Field. However, Devon challenges the\n      precision of Encore's estimates of pay from the digital log studies and phi h values Encore assigns\n      to the Vada Bean No. 1 Well.\n\n              Devon asserts that Encore overestimates the net pay for the Ozona (Canyon Sand) Field for\n      its Vada Bean No. 1 Well. Devon claims that Encore's log analysis for its Vada Bean No. 1 Well\n      erred because the porosity log was run on a limestone matrix instead of a sandstone matrix, thereby\n      overestimating porosity by at least 4%. Devon further argues that Encore failed to account for\n      spalling in its Vada Bean No. 1 Well, a common phenomenon during drilling in this area. Spalling\n      occurs when rock particles break off into the borehole face of the wellbore, leading to an inaccurate\n      and inflated porosity reading. Devon contends that Encore's estimates should have capped\n      maximum porosity readings at 14%. Encore considered the log reading as accurate even where it\n      indicated as much as 30% porosity, thereby leading to a significantly higher phi h value for Encore's\n      Vada Bean No. I Well than Devon believes is correct. Devon urges that its own phi h isopach map\n      is based on proper porosity cut-offs at both the upper and lower ends of the scale, thereby showing\n      a more accurate depiction of the reservoir conditions on Encore's Vada Bean Lease.\n\n              Devon also contends that the bottomhole pressure tested in the Vada Bean No. 1 Well of\n      1530 psi in October 2004 was correct. Devon further asserts that Encore's volumetric calculations\n      and decline curve analysis ignore recent pressure data from Devon's Vada Bean No. 12 Well which\n      offsets the Encore acreage. This pressure data comes from a build up test in January 2005 from\n      which the reservoir pressure can be calculated at 1395 psi. Using this reservoir pressure and its phi\n      h isopach map, Devon's calculations find that the remaining recoverable reserves underlying the\n      Vada Bean Lease total approximately .84 Bcf. Devon calculates that the remaining recovery from\n      the Vada Bean No. 1 Well will be .86 Bcf, which exceeds what Devon asserts is its more accurate\n      estimate of the remaining recoverable reserves underlying Encore's Vada Bean Lease.\n\n                                            EXAMINERS' OPINION\n\n               As discussed below, Encore asserts that an exception to the lease line spacing requirements\n      is justified both to prevent confiscation and waste. It is the examiners' opinion that Encore has\n      established that an exception permit is warranted under the confiscation test. Accordingly, no\n      discussion is required on Encore's claim that an exception is necessary to prevent waste.\n\n\n\n\n267\n\f                                   •                                           •\n      RULE 37 CASE No. 0240684                                                                           Pa.ge 5\n\n\n\n             To establish entitlement to an exception to Rule 37 to prevent confiscation, an applicant must\n      show that, absent the applied-for well, it will be denied a reasonable opportunity to recover its fair\n      share of hydrocarbons currently in place under the lease, or its equivalent in kind. The applicant\n      must satisfy a two pronged test: 1) the applicant must show that it will not be afforded a reasonable\n      opportunity to recover its fair share of hydrocarbons currently in place by drilling a well at a regular\n      location; and 2) the applicant must show that the proposed irregular location is reasonable.\n      Generally, the applicant must also provide a calculation of the current reserves underlying its lease.\n\n              As noted in Gulf Land Co. v.

Any denial of such\n              fair chance would be 'confiscation' within the meaning of Rule 37 and the Rule of\n              May 29th.\n\n              Encore presented volumetric evidence based on its interpretation of the geology and reservoir\n      structure, determinations of net pay from .digital analysis of a cross-section, of well logs, and its phi\n      h isopach map derived from the structural interpretation and the log analyses to estimate that, at the\n      very least, approximately 1.336 Bcf of recoverable natural gas was present beneath its Vada Bean\n      Lease at original conditions. Due to the low permeability in the Ozona (Canyon Sand). Field, the\n      estimated recoverable reserves at original conditions, less the total cumulative recovery from the\n      Vada Bean No. 1 well, is a sufficient measure to determine the current recoverable reserves\n      underlying the Vada Bean Lease. Additionally, maps depicting the estimated drainage area of the\n      wells on and offsetting the Vada Bean Lease establish that the northernmost 23.30 acres in the 63.30\n      acre tract have not been affected by any existing well.\n\n             Encore's decline curve analysis for its existing Vada Bean No. 1 well shows that the\n      estimated cumulative recovery from that well will only be .972 Bcf, leaving a remainder of at least\n      .365 Bcf of current recoverable reserves which will not be recovered by its existing well.\n      Accordingly, this evidence satisfies the first element for an exception to prevent confiscation.\n\n              The examiners specifically note that while Encore's phi h value for its Vada Bean No. 1 Well\n      may be higher than other wells in the field, the production history for this well supports its\n      interpretation. Devon's proposed correction to the phi h value for the Vada Bean No. 1 Well would\n      place it at or below the same capability as several wells drilled by Devon as direct offsets to\n      Encore's Vada Bean Lease which are not reporting production capability at or near the reported\n      production from the Vada Bean No. 1 Well. The examiners therefore believe that, while Encore's\n      estimated phi h value for the Vada Bean No. 1 Well may be high in relation to the nearby offset\n      wells, the empirical production data supports a higher value compared to the well's nearest\n      neighbors.\n\n             Encore also presented evidence to establish that the proposed location is reasonable. The\n      proposed well is located roughly equidistant from the lease lines on the narrow rectangular tract.\n\n\n\n268\n\f      RULE 37 CASE No. 0240684                                                                        Page 6\n\n      Additionally, maps depicting the drainage pattern from the existing wells, including the Vada Bean\n      No. 1, show that the proposed well will recover reserves from the northern portion of its lease which\n      will not be recovered from any other existing well. This evidence satisfies the second element\n      necessary to support an application for an exception to prevent confiscation. Accordingly, it is the\n      examiner's recommendation that Encore's application be approved on this basis.\n\n                                                 CONCLUSION\n\n              Encore is entitled to an exception to Rule 37 to prevent confiscation of natural gas\n      underlying its Vada Bean Lease in the Ozona (Canyon Sand) Field. Accordingly, the application\n      for an exception to Rule 37 should be granted.\n\n             Based on the record in this Docket,. the examiners recommend adoption of the following\n      Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.\n\n                                              FINDINGS OF FACT\n\n      1.     Encore Operating, L.P. (\"Applicant\" or \"Encore\") seeks an exception to Statewide Rule 37\n             to drill Well No. 2 on the Vada Bean Lease in the Ozona (Canyon Sand) Field, Crockett\n             County. Encore appeared at the hearing and presented evidence in support of its application.\n\n      2.     Encore's application is protested by Devon Energy Production, L.P., the operator of an\n             offsetting tract to the east of the Vada Bean Lease. Devon appeared at the hearing and\n             presented evidence in protest of Encore's application..\n\n      3.     The Vada Bean Lease is a narrow rectangular shaped 63.30 acre tract with no locations\n             regular to lease line spacing requireinents in the Ozona (Canyon Sand) Field due to the\n             configuration of the lease. The proposed well will be located 275 feet from the western lease\n             line and 254 feet from the eastern lease line. The proposed well is regular to all other lease\n             line boundaries.\n\n      4.     The Ozona (Canyon Sand) Field is subject to spacing requirements of 467 feet minimum\n             distance to the nearest lease line and 1200 feet minimum distance between wells for oil wells\n             and 660 feet minimum distance to the nearest lease line and 933 feet minimum distance\n             between wells for gas wells.\n\n      5.     Encore's Vada Bean No. 1 Well will not recover its fair share of current recoverable reserves\n             in the Ozona (Canyon Sand) Field currently underlying its Vada Bean Lease.\n\n             a.

(\"Candleridge\" or \"applicant\") seeks an exception to Statewide Rule\n      37 to drill its proposed Well No. 1 on the Sanders-Hodge \"A\" Unit for the Levelland Field. The\n      application is protested by Texaco E&P, Inc., (\"Texaco\" or \"protestant\"). The Levelland field rules\n      mandate spacing of 440 feet from unit lines and 880 feet between wells, with 42.5 acre regular units\n      and optional units of 21.25 acres.\n\n              The applied-for location is regular as to between-well spacing but is only 100 feet from the\n      nearest unit line. Accordingly, an exception to the Levelland Field Rules pursuant to Statewide Rule\n      37 is necessary. The Sanders-Hodge \"A\" Unit contains 21.25 contiguous acres and the proposed\n      well will be the only well on the unit producing from the Levelland Field.\n\n             The hearing in this docket on May 3, 1996, was consolidated with Rule 37 Case No.\n      0211519, which was the application of Texaco for an exception to rule 37 for its Ira P. DeLoache\n      Lease Well No. 85 in the Levelland Field. Candleridge protested Texaco's application but was\n      deemed to be unaffected based on the evidence presented at the hearing. Rule 37 Case 0211519 was\n      approved administratively on May 20, 1996.\n\n\n                                     UNCONTROVERTED EVIDENCE\n\n              The relative locations of the wells proposed by Texaco and Candleridge and the nearby\n      existing wells are illustrated on Exhibit A to this Proposal for Decision. Exhibit A is a portion of\n      Candleridge's Exhibit 1 annotated to highlight the location of Texaco's applied-for Well No. 85 and\n      Candleridge's applied-for Well No. 1.\n\n              Candleridge operates six small leases on the northern end of the very large Levelland Field.\n      Texaco operates much larger leases, including the Ira P. DeLoache Lease, adjacent and to the\n      southwest of Candleridge's acreage. The Ira P. DeLoache lease has 45 producing wells and 32\n      injection wells. Immediately to the east of the Ira P. DeLoache Lease is Texaco's Montgomery\n      Estate-Davies Lease which has 73 producing wells and 48 injection wells. The injection pattern on\n      Texaco's two leases is approximately a forty acre line drive wherein rows of injection wells alternate\n      with rows of producing wells. Texaco's application for its Ira P. Deloache Well No. 85 required a\n      Rule 37 exception because the proposed well was closer than 440' to Texaco's Montgomery Estate-\n      Davies Lease. Well 85 needed to be placed 175' from the Montgomery Estate-Davies Lease in order\n      to complete Texaco's pattern flood.\n\n             The productive San Andres reservoir is porous and permeable and Texaco has been\n      successfully water flooding the DeLoache Lease for some time. Prior to the administrative grant of\n      Texaco's Rule 37 exception for Well No. 85, Texaco presented evidence that when it drilled two\n      previous producing wells to fill in holes in the waterflood pattern, those wells had no effect on the\n      production of their direct offset producing wells. The direct offset producing wells are only 900 -\n      1000' away from the infill producing wells. Texaco testified that its proposed Well No. 85 \"would\n\n\n273\n\f      Proposal for Decision\n                                                                             •                       Page 3\n      Rule 37 Case No. 0211820\n\n      have no impact of its two immediate offsets.\" Texaco's witnesses testified that Well No. 85 will\n      recover 129,000 BO from a 45' thick pay section and that this \"129,000 BO ...would not be recovered\n      by any other well due to the nature of the flood.\"\n\n             Candleridge's property is approximately 2900' north of Well No. 85 and there are four\n      producing wells between the proposed location of Texaco's proposed Well No. 85 and Candleridge's\n      acreage. In 1994, Candleridge's predecessor, S.K. Rogers Oil, converted four producing wells, the\n      Hodge Estate No. 2, the Hodge \"A\" No. 1-A, and the Sanders Nos. 2 and 4 to injection.\n\n\n                     APPLICANT CANDLERIDGE'S EVIDENCE AND POSITION\n\n             Candleridge protested Texaco's Rule 37 application after receiving notice as an offset\n      operator. Candleridge did not present evidence to contradict Texaco's case but took the position that\n      the Commission should not grant Texaco's Rule 37 application without granting the application of\n      Candleridge:for a Rule 37. The examiners ruled on May 20, 1996, that Candleridge was unaffected\n      by Texaco's proposed Well No. 85 and Candleridge did not contest the examiners' ruling.\n\n              Candleridge's injection wells are located to compliment Texaco's waterflood pattern as\n      Candleridge hoped to make a co-operative lease-line waterflood arrangement with Texaco.\n      Candleridge is now receiving response to its waterflood in its producing wells but, due to the absence\n      of a co-operative waterflood agreement with Texaco, Candleridge is losing a large part of the benefit\n      of the waterflood. The injection wells are pushing a substantial volume of oil off Candleridge's\n      leases and onto Texaco's property.\n\n              Two of Candleridge's injection wells, the Sanders No. 2 and Hodge \"A\" No. 1A, are located\n      2200 feet apart and 440 feet north of the common lease line with Texaco. The square formed by\n      lines between the two wells and the lease line covers about 22 acres. If the proposed well is not\n      drilled any remaining oil within this square will be pushed to Texaco's acreage and will not be\n      recovered by Candleridge.\n\n              Texaco's Well Nos. 25 and 27 are producing wells just to the south of the common lease line\n      with Candleridge. They are on the pattern lines of Texaco's injection wells. Candleridge's injection\n      wells are on the same pattern lines and extend the pattern established by Texaco's wells. Candleridge\n      anticipated that Texaco would convert these two producing wells to injection which would, complete\n      the pattern, facilitate the waterflood and thereby protect correlative rights across the lease line.\n      Candleridge offered Texaco the same type of cooperative development agreement that Texaco has\n      with its southern boundary offset operator but Texaco declined the offer. Candleridge claims that\n      oil under the entire 72 acres between 440' and the lease line of its property cannot be recovered\n      without a co-operative lease line waterflood pattern or lease line producing wells.\n\n             Candleridge assumed the same reservoir parameters as Texaco in its original application with\n      the exception of reservoir thickness. Texaco assumed a reservoir thickness of 45 feet around its\n      proposed No. 85, while Candleridge has assumed only 18 feet of net pay around its proposed well.\n      Candleridge then calculated that about 70,000 barrels of oil were recoverable from the square\n\n\n274\n\f      Proposal for Decision\n                                   i                                          •                       Page 4\n      Rule 37 Case No. 0211820\n\n      between the injection wells and the lease lines by both primary and secondary efforts. The water\n      injected into the Candleridge Sanders No. 2 and Hodge \"A\" No. 1A has already swept the oil from\n      about 8.9 of the acres in the square, which leaves 42,000 (70,000 - 28,000) barrels of recoverable\n      oil in this square that Candleridge believes only its proposed Sanders-Hodge \"A\" Unit No. 1 can\n      recover.\n\n             Candleridge believes that the oil which its injection wells are sweeping off its lease will be\n      only partially recovered by Texaco's wells. About half of the oil swept off the lease will be\n      unrecovered by either party unless the injection pattern is completed.\n\n              Texaco and the predecessor operator to Candleridge, S.K. Rogers had been discussing a co-\n      operative lease-line injection program but Texaco had indicated in late 1993 that it would wait to\n      decide on the agreement. Rogers made another offer for a lease-line injection agreement to Texaco\n      by a letter written in January of 1995. There is no evidence of a written response from Texaco.\n\n\n                       PROTESTANT TEXACO'S EVIDENCE AND POSITION\n\n              If Candleridge's proposed location is drilled only 100 feet• from Texaco's lease, and the\n      producing well has an assumed square drainage area of 21.25 acres, then about 8 of those acres\n      would be under lease to Texaco. According to Texaco, Candleridge could recover some of the\n      reserves being pushed by the Candleridge's two injection wells by drilling in between the two\n      injection wells at a distance of 440 feet from Texaco's lease. This location would be regular with\n      respect to lease lines and Texaco agreed to waive any objection to a Rule 37 exception based on\n      between well spacing.\n\n              Texaco also pointed out that Candleridge chose to convert to injection two of its producing\n      wells that are closest to Texaco's leases. Texaco's witnesses testified that if Texaco had been in\n      Candleridge's position and not had a co-operative lease-line agreement in writing, it would have\n      protected its lease-line rather than maintaining the same waterflood pattern as an offset operator.\n      Texaco's witnesses also testified that if they were protecting a waterflood lease from confiscation\n      they would have drilled an additional five wells and used a five-spot injection pattern which\n      maintained lease-line producing wells.\n\n\n                                           EXAMINERS' OPINION\n\n              Exceptions to Statewide Rule 37 may be granted to prevent waste or to protect correlative\n      rights/prevent confiscation. An applicant seeking an exception to Rule 37 based on waste must\n      establish three elements: 1) that unusual conditions, different from conditions in adjacent parts of\n      the field, exist under the tract for which the exception is sought; 2) that, as a result of these\n      conditions, hydrocarbons will be recovered by the well for which a permit is sought that would not\n      be recovered by any existing well or by additional wells drilled at regular locations; and, 3) that the\n      volume of otherwise unrecoverable hydrocarbons is substantial. The evidence of both parties\n      indicates that a substantial volume of oil being swept by Candleridge's injection wells cannot be\n\n\n275\n\f      Proposal for Decision\n                                  •                                            •                        Page 5\n      Rule 37 Case No. 0211820\n\n      recovered by any regularly located well. Applicant Candleridge did not, however, present any\n      evidence of an unusual condition which would authorize granting an exception based on waste.\n\n             To obtain an exception to Statewide Rule 37 to protect correlative rights, the applicant must\n      show that: 1) It is not possible for the applicant to recover its fair share of minerals under its tract\n      from regular locations; and, 2) that the proposed irregular location is reasonable. Because\n      Candleridge's Sanders-Hodge \"A\" Unit was formed after field rules were established, the size and\n      shape of the pooled unit are not being considered in determining whether confiscation is occurring.\n      See Tex. R.R. Comm'n, 16 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 3.37(g)(1) (West Jan. 1, 1996) [Statewide rule\n      37(g)(1)].\n\n              Candleridge's evidence that, unless the application is granted, Candleridge's injection wells\n      will sweep an additional 42,000 barrels of oil off of tracts operated by Candleridge and onto Texaco's\n      lease was unrefuted. Texaco has deviated from its established line-drive pattern and has not\n      converted any of its producing wells along its common lease-lines with Candleridge to injection.\n      Texaco's six producing \"border guard\" wells along the lease-lines between Candleridge and Texaco\n      insure that Texaco's injection wells will not sweep any significant volume of oil from Texaco's leases\n      onto Candleridge's leases. A well located at a regular location 440 feet from lease-lines would be\n      directly between the two injection wells and the same distance from the Texaco lease-line as the two\n      injection wells and, as a result, would only recover a small fraction of the oil being swept onto\n      Texaco's lease.\n\n              The proposed location is reasonable. Texaco's \"border guard\" producing wells will capture\n      the secondary. oil being swept by Texaco's injection wells before it reaches Candleridge's leases\n      and/or the proposed well location. Further, Texaco's evidence regarding its own Rule 37 application\n      suggests that a well at the location proposed by Candleridge will not interfere with the production\n      of Texaco's existing wells and will recover oil that cannot be recovered by existing Texaco wells.\n      Texaco's witnesses testified that all or the great majority of the production to be recovered by\n      Texaco's applied-for Well No. 85 would not be recovered by any other well. The producing wells\n      nearest Well No. 85 are only about 900 feet from Well 85 yet Texaco expects the production from\n      these wells to be unaffected by Well No. 85. Candleridge's applied-for location is more then 900 feet\n      from the nearest Texaco prodUcing wells. Texaco's evidence that its well will recover oil that would\n      not be recovered by any adjacent producing well indicates that the applied-for Candleridge well on\n      the adjacent lease will similarly recover oil that would not be recovered by any existing well.\n\n              Texaco's own evidence indicates that a well at the location proposed by Candleridge will\n      recover little, if any, oil from Texaco's tract. Conversely, it is undisputed that a well at the applied-\n      for location would recover a substantial volume of \"secondary\" oil from the Candleridge leases that\n      would otherwise be swept off the leases.\n\n             The examiners recommend adoption of the following proposed findings of fact and\n      conclusions of law:\n\n\n\n\n276\n\f      Proposal for Decision\n      Rule 37 Case No. 0211820\n                               •                                           •                        Page 6\n\n\n                                           FINDINGS OF FACT\n\n      1.    Notice of the hearing was given at least 10 days prior to the hearing to all designated\n            operators, lessees of record for tracts that have no designated operator, and owners of record'\n            of unleased mineral interests for each adjacent tract and each tract nearer to the well than the\n            prescribed minimum lease-line spacing distance.\n\n      2.    Candleridge Oil, Inc., (\"applicant\") has applied on Form W-1 for a permit to drill Well No.\n            1 on the Sanders-Hodge \"A\" Unit. Applicant proposes to drill its well at a location 100 feet\n            from the south line and 962 feet from the east line of the unit, and -0- feet from the east line\n            and 100 feet from the south line of the Reeves CSL, Lge 78, Lab 9 Survey (A-201).\n            Applicant has applied to drill its proposed well for the Levelland Field.\n\n      3.    The Levelland Field has field rules requiring spacing of 440 feet from unit lines and 880 feet\n            between wells. The field rules further specify a density pattern of 42.5 acres per well with\n            options of 21.25 acres per well.\n\n      4.    Applicant's Sanders-Hodge \"A\" Unit is a tract containing 21.25 acres.\n\n      5.    The volume of remaining primary recoverable reserves in the Levelland Field under the\n            applicant's Sanders-Hodge \"A\" Unit and the surrounding tracts is insignificant.\n\n      6.    There is a line pattern of injection and producing wells that extends•from the adjoining lease\n            onto applicant's Sanders-Hodge \"A\" Unit.\n\n      7.    Applicant's existing injection wells in the line pattern will sweep approximately 42,000\n            barrels of oil off of applicant's leases.\n\n      8.    The injection wells on tracts adjacent to applicant's Sanders-Hodge \"A\" Unit will not sweep\n            oil from other tracts onto the leases operated by applicant.\n\n      9.    A well at the applied-for location will recover approximately 42,000 barrels of oil which no\n            existing Candleridge well could recover.\n\n      10.   A well a regular distance from the lease-line between the applicant's leases and the adjoining\n            leases operated by Texaco would recover substantially less than 42,000 barrels of oil.\n\n      11.   A well at the applied-for location will not interfere with existing producing wells on adjacent\n            leases operated by protestant Texaco.\n\n\n                                        CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\n      1.    Proper notice of hearing was timely given to all persons legally entitled to notice.\n\n\n\n277\n\f      Proposal for Decision                                                                            Page 7\n      Rule 37 Case No. 0211820\n\n      2.          All things have occurred or have been done that are necessary to give the Commission\n                  jurisdiction to decide this matter.\n\n      3.         An exception pursuant to Statewide Rule 37 to the Levelland Field rules regarding well\n                 spacing is necessary to permit drilling the applied-for well.\n\n      4.         Approval of the requested permit to drill a well at the proposed location is necessary to give\n                 the owners of the Sanders-Hodge \"A\" Unit a reasonable opportunity to recover their fair\n                 share of oil underlying their leases from the Levelland Field.\n\n      5.         The applied-for location is reasonable.\n\n      6.         An exception to Statewide Rule 37 is necessary to prevent confiscation of oil from the\n                 Levelland Field currently in place under the Sanders-Hodge \"A\" Unit.\n\n\n                                                 RECOMMENDATION\n\n             The examiners recommend that the subject application be approved in accordance with the\n      attached final order.\n\n                                                               Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n\n\n                            Colin K.

(\"Applicant\" or \"Chesapeake\") seeks an exception to Statewide\n      Rule 37 to drill Well No. 4 on the Green Gas Unit Lease, Oak Hill (Cotton Valley) Field. The Green\n      Gas Unit is an irregularly shaped 683 acre pooled unit which includes land owned by the State of\n      Texas and private lands. The 307.8 acres owned by the state is an approximately 10 mile long\n      section of the Sabine River. The remaining 375.2 acres are privately owned tracts. This\n      configuration is very atypical. A square 640 acre unit is one mile wide, but this unit is over 10 miles\n      wide. The proposed well would be the fourth well on the unit. Chesapeake has also requested an\n      exception to the maximum diagonal requirement for the proposed proration unit associated with the\n      Green No. 4 well. The application is protested by Anadarko E & P Company, L.P. (\"Anadarko\"),\n      the offset operator on both sides of the river tract where the proposed well is located.\n\n              The Oak Hill (Cotton Valley) Field is subject to spacing requirements of 467 feet minimum\n      distance to the nearest lease line and 1200 feet minimum distance between wells. The proposed\n      bottom hole location is in the center of the river tract, 75 feet from the offsetting property on both\n      sides. A copy of the plat filed with Applicant's W-1 (Application for Permit to Drill, Deepen, Plug\n      Back or Re-Enter) is attached for reference.\n\n               The maximum diagonal requirement for the Oak Hill (Cotton Valley) Field is 5500 feet for\n      160 acre units, 3250 feet for 80 acre units, and 2100 feet for 40 acre units. Chesapeake proposes two\n      alternative proration units for its Green No. 4 Well. The first unit includes176 acres with a diagonal\n      of approximately 58,000 feet. This lengthy diagonal is required because the proposed unit assigns\n      a portion of the entire length of the Sabine River tract to the Green No. 4 Well. Alternatively,\n      Chesapeake proposes a 40 acre proration unit with a diagonal of approximately 15,815 feet. The\n      40 acre proration unit assigns a portion of the river tract from the general vicinity of the proposed\n      well to the easternmost terminus of the river tract, approximately 3 miles from the proposed location.\n\n                                   APPLICANT'S POSITION AND EVIDENCE\n\n              The Oak Hill (Cotton Valley) Field is productive from the lower Taylor sand, a uniform\n      marine bar deposit, and from the Upper Cotton Valley, a group of independent sand lenses formed\n      in a fluvial depositional environment. Both formations are recognized as tight and require fracture\n      stimulation of the producing interval.\n\n              The Taylor sand is present throughout the Green Gas Unit. Chesapeake's structural cross\n      section of wells over the entire area shows that the Taylor sand thins and becomes more water\n      saturated on an east to west trend. The Upper Cotton Valley is described as \"hit and miss\" and does\n      not exhibit a reliable trend within the Green Gas Unit.\n\n\n\n\n281\n\f      Rule 37 Case No. 0245869                                                                        Page 3\n      Proposal for Decision\n\n             The Oak Hill (Cotton Valley) Field underlies the entire unit as shown by Chesapeake's net\n      pay and isopach maps for the area. However, Chesapeake contends the Cotton Valley is thicker and\n      less water saturated in the eastern portion of the Green Gas Unit. Chesapeake's maps and\n      volumetric analysis of the Green Gas Unit reflect the entire Cotton Valley interval.\n\n             Chesapeake currently operates three wells on the Green Gas Unit. The Green Gas Unit No.\n      1 was completed in December 1995 on an 80 acre pooled unit comprised of 62.8 acres of the State's\n      Sabine River lands and 17.2 acres of private property adjacent to the river. The Green No. 1 Well\n      has produced over 1 Bcf since it was completed.\n\n              The Green No. 2 and No. 3 wells were drilled and completed in January 2006. Performance\n      from both of these wells has been marginal. Cumulative production from the Green No. 2 is .091\n      Bcf while the Green No. 3 is .18 Bcf. These two wells were drilled under an amended unit\n      agreement which increased the overall size of the unit to its present 683 acres by adding an\n      additional 358 acres of privately owned land and 245 acres of the State's Sabine River lands.\n      Additionally, the proration units for the Green No. 1, Green No. 2 and Green No. 3 were drawn so\n      that each well included a portion of the complete 10 mile Sabine River lands, and a portion of the\n      privately held land. Exceptions to the maximum diagonal requirements were approved\n      administratively for these three wells.\n\n              The proposed Green No. 4 well would be located on a portion of the Sabine River acreage\n      which was originally assigned to the Green No. 1 well. Chesapeake claims that the Green.No. 4 is\n      necessary to prevent confiscation as the three existing wells will not recover a significant portion\n      of the remaining recoverable natural gas underlying under the Green Gas Unit. As of the hearing\n      date, the three existing wells cumulative production was 1.274 Bcf. The estimated ultimate recovery\n      from the 3 existing wells is 1A68 Bcf of natural gas. Chesapeake's volumetric analysis shows 62.1\n      Bcf in currently recoverable reserves underlying the entire Green Gas Unit, and 23 Bcf underlying\n      the easternmost 160 acres of the State's river lands. Chesapeake therefore urges that an exception\n      is necessary because there are significant reserves which will not be recovered by the existing wells.\n\n               Chesapeake admits regular locations exist on the unit. However, it claims a well drilled at\n      a regular location, while productive, would not be economic to drill. The nearest offset well to the\n      portion.of the unit with regular locations is the Gibson \"A\" No. 2 Well. The Gibson \"A\" No. 2 Well\n      first reported production in October 2007. Through April 2008, the cumulative production from the\n      well is .094 Bcf. Chesapeake's EUR for the well ranges between .16 and .22 Bcf based only on the\n      current completion in the Taylor sand. Chesapeake claims that with this EUR, the Gibson \"A\" No.\n      2 Well will never be profitable using current economic projections. Chesapeake therefore asserts\n      that no reasonable regular locations exist on the Green Gas Unit.\n\n               Chesapeake also relies on maps depicting the drainage patterns of the existing wells as\n      estimated by Anadarko. Based on these maps, Chesapeake asserts that some of the acreage in the\n      river tract is being drained by offsetting wells. Chesapeake urges it therefore needs the well at the\n      proposed location to protect its correlative rights.\n\n\n\n282\n\f      Rule 37 Case No. 0245869                                                                           Page 4\n      Proposal for Decision\n\n              Chespeake also requests an exception to the maximum diagonal requirement in the field.\n      Chesapeake proposes that the Green No. 4 well further split the Sabine River lands so that a portion\n      is assigned to all four wells. This results in several \"ribbons\" necessary to create four proration units\n      which will include all of the State's river acreage. Each ribbon is approximately 10 miles in length.\n      Alternatively, Chesapeake requests that the acreage for the Green No. 1 well be split with the Green\n      No. 4 well with exceptions to the maximum diagonal requirement consistent with the alternative\n      proposed 160 acre unit.\n\n                                   PROTESTANT'S POSITION AND EVIDENCE\n\n              Anadarko contends that Chesapeake failed to submit the required evidence to support a well\n      at the exception location because there are multiple regular locations available on the 683 acre Green\n      Gas Unit. It is undisputed that regular locations on the Green Gas Unit will encounter both the\n      Taylor and Upper Cotton Valley sands. While Chesapeake argues its proposed location is more\n      reasonable due to the economic risk associated with developing the regular locations, Anadarko\n      asserts that the proper standard for supporting an exception to prevent confiscation is whether the\n      exception is necessary. Anadarko further notes that no prior Commission case has granted an\n      exception to spacing rules on the basis of economic risk alone. Anadarko urges that until\n      Chesapeake has developed its regular locations that it cannot seek exception locations on the basis\n      of donfiscation.\n\n               Anadarko also questions the technical basis for Chesapeake's confiscation case. Anadarko\n      first argued that Chesapeake's central premise of an east-west trend in the Oak Hill (Cotton Valley)\n      Field was based on a flawed analysis. Anadarko claims that Chesapeake inappropriately evaluated\n      the Oak Hill (Cotton Valley) Field in its hydrocarbon pore volume and net pay maps by aggregating\n      the Upper Cotton Valley sand with the Taylor sand in its analysis. The Taylor sand is a structural\n      trap while the Upper Cotton Valley is a series of laterally discontinuous sands which form\n      stratigraphic traps. Stratigraphic traps are not likely to be affected by the syncline Chesapeake posits\n      for the formation. Further, published studies of the Oak Hill (Cotton Valley) Field relied on by both\n      parties specifically caution against using the Upper Cotton Valley as a predictive tool of estimated\n      ultimate recovery (EUR) trends. Anadarko therefore urges that Chesapeake's maps are fatally\n      flawed as the aggregate values do not establish a trend for all of the contributing sands and do not\n      accurately reflect recoverable reserves.\n\n              Anadarko also challenges Chesapeake's assertion that the Gibson \"A\" No. 2 Well will never\n      be profitable using current economic projections. Anadarko's own economic analysis predicts that\n      the Gibson \"A\" No. 2 Well will be economic currently; and will be even more profitable if the well\n      is later completed in the Upper Cotton Valley sand. Anadarko also notes that with the\n      unpredictability of Upper Cotton Valley production in the field, it is inappropriate to rule out\n      potential reserves from that formation contributing to production at the regular locations on the\n      Green Gas Unit.\n\n\n\n\n283\n\f      Rule 37 Case No. 0245869                                                                         Page 5\n      Proposal for Decision\n\n              Finally, Anadarko urges the additional acreage added to the Green Gas Unit was a deliberate\n      attempt to support a drilling program for 16 additional wells on the easternmost river acreage\n      without obtaining density exceptions. Anadarko notes that 358 acres were leased from the Eastman\n      Chemical Company underlying a large facility it operates and added to the Green Gas Unit with\n      additional State lands in the Sabine River. However, the Eastman lease agreements include\n      covenants prohibiting the use of the surface or subsurface for development of the underlying mineral\n      estate. Anadarko argues that the restrictions in the lease are an effective moratorium on the\n      development of the Eastman acreage. It believes the only purpose of agreeing to such restrictions\n      was to support drilling at greater density along the river acreage through gerrymandering the\n      proration units to encompass the entire unit. Anadarko admits the proration units technically comply\n      with Commission rules if a maximum diagonal exception is obtained. However, Anadarko argues\n      that this process is designed to circumvent Commission's rules regarding density and double\n      assignment of acreage.\n\n                                             EXAMINERS' OPINION\n\n              Chesapeake contends it is entitled to an exception at the proposed location for its Green No.\n      4 Well. Chesapeake argues that the proposed well is necessary to prevent confiscation on the full\n      683 acre unit. Alternatively, Chesapeake argues that the proposed well is necessary to prevent\n      confiscation on the easternmost 160 acres of the unit. Finally, Chesapeake seeks an exception to the\n      maximum diagonal requirement in order to assign a portion of the Sabine river acreage and the\n      privately held acreage to each of its 4 wells on the 683. acre unit.\n\n               The examiners recommend that Chesapeake's application be denied because Chesapeake did\n      not provide reliable evidence to support an exception at th6 proposed. location. Additionally,\n      Chesapeake cannot subdivide the 683 acre unit identified in its drilling permit application to argue\n      that it is entitled to a well on a portion of the unit.\n\n      Exceptions to Prevent Confiscation\n\n              To establish entitlement to an exception to Rule 37 to prevent confiscation, an applicant must\n      show that absent the applied-for well, it will be denied a reasonable opportunity to recover its fair\n      share of hydrocarbons currently in place under the lease, or its equivalent in kind. The applicant\n      must satisfy a two pronged test: 1) the applicant must show that it will not be afforded a reasonable\n      opportunity to recover its fair share of hydrocarbons currently in place by drilling wells at regular\n      locations; and 2) the applicant must show that the proposed irregular location is reasonable.\n\n              It is the basic right of every landowner or lessee to a fair and reasonable chance to recover\n      the oil and gas under his property as recognized by the Texas Supreme Court in Gulf Land Co. v.\n      Atlantic Refining Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3911258\"><a href=\"/opinion/4147205/gulf-land-co-v-atlantic-ref-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">73</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 80 (Tex. 1939). Denial of that fair chance is confiscation\n      within the meaning of Rule 37. Id. Because an application cannot seek redress for past drainage,\n      an applicant must provide evidence that it will not be afforded an opportunity to recover the reserves\n      currently in place under its lease - this is its \"fair share\".\n\n\n\n\n284\n\f      Rule 37 Case No. 0245869                                                                          Page 6\n      Proposal for Decision\n\n      Chesapeake Failed to Establish the Necessity for an Exception to Prevent Confiscation.\n\n              Chesapeake failed to establish that it is entitled to a well at the proposed location to prevent\n      confiscation on the Green Gas Unit. Chesapeake submitted a volumetric estimate of 62.1 Bcf in\n      current recoverable reserves underlying the entire 683 acre Green Gas Unit. Chesapeake argues its\n      existing three wells will only recover 1.5 Bcf and that the proposed well is therefore necessary to\n      give it an opportunity to recover its fair share of reserves. As discussed below, Chesapeake's\n      volumetric analysis is flawed and does not provide a reliable estimate of the remaining reserves\n      underlying the unit.\n\n              Chesapeake's estimates of the current recoverable reserves underlying the full 683 acre unit\n      are unreliable because it inappropriately consolidated the Upper Cotton Valley and Taylor when\n      analyzing the remaining reserves. Because each interval has different characteristics, they must be\n      analyzed separately. Chesapeake's own geologist confirmed this when describing the characteristics\n      of the Upper Cotton Valley interval as a \"hit or miss\" play.\n\n               Chesapeake's analysis lumped the two intervals together and then mapped the cumulative\n      total to provide the basis for the volumetric analysis. The proper methodology here would have been\n      to separately map each interval, perform separate volumetric analyses and then add the volumetric\n      results together to arrive at an accurate and reliable estimate of the remaining recoverable reserves.\n      Because the proper methodology was not , followed, it is not reliable evidence to support an\n      exception based on confiscation. In the absence of reliable volumetrics, there are insufficient facts\n      upon which to base Chesapeake's application for an exception based on confiscation.\n\n              The examiners also question the reliability of Chesapeake's study based on the extrapolation\n      of estimated reserves from the eastern 160 acres to the full 10 mile wide 683 acre Green Gas Unit.\n      Normally, the issue of reservoir characteristics would not be an issue on a single pooled unit.\n      However, the issue is relevant here to the unusual configuration of a 10 mile wide unit.\n\n               It is unquestioned that there has been heavy development in the Oak Hill (Cotton Valley)\n      Field in the easternmost area of the Green Gas Unit. However, there have been very few wells\n      drilled in the western area. Further, Chesapeake argues' that the closest well drilled to the regular\n      locations on the Green Gas Unit, the Gibson \"A\" No. 2 Well, will only be a marginal well with .2\n      Bcf of production. The absence of well control in the western portion of the unit, coupled with the\n      limited expected performance of the Gibson \"A\" No. 2 well indicate that Chesapeake's estimates\n      of over 60 Bcf of recoverable reserves are speculative at best.\n\n               Chesapeake's witnesses claim they need the applied-for irregular location to allow them to\n      have a commercial well. However, neither Chesapeake nor any other operator is guaranteed a well\n      that meets its self-imposed criteria for economic viability - each mineral interest owner is entitled\n      to a fair and equal opportunity to recover its fair share of the hydrocarbons under its tract. Economic\n      requirements: 1) vary from company to company (applicant to applicant); 2) are not evenly applied;\n      and, 3) are not specific to the property rights on a given tract. An operator's economic requirements\n\n\n\n285\n\f      Rule 37 Case No. 0245869                                                                                                Page 7\n      Proposal for Decision\n\n      therefore cannot be the basis for granting an exception to Statewide Rule 37 to protect correlative\n      rights. See Rule 37 Case No. 0206334: Application of Enron Oil & Gas Company for an exception\n      to Statewide Rule 37 to Drill Its No. 17 Well, Frank Reed 117 Lease, Sawyer (Canyon) Field, Sutton\n      County, Texas.\n\n             Rule 37 is equally applicable to all operators. While the non-discriminatory application of\n      Commission spacing rules may result in some economic loss by an operator, this loss does not\n      amount to legal confiscation.

Manziel, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2464693\"><a href=\"/opinion/2464693/railroad-commission-of-texas-v-manziel/\"><span class=\"volume\">361</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 565 (Tex.\n      1962); Railroad Commission v.

Civ. App. -- Austin 1942, writ\n      dism'd w.o.in.). The determination of what is a fair opportunity must be based on the relationship\n      between potential drilisite locations and the currently recoverable reserves' under a tract, not on\n      economic viability guidelines that each operator selects for itself.\n\n              Chesapeake's economic assessment that regular wells would not be commercial is not\n      reliable evidence for ruling out the other regular locations on the Green Gas Unit. The claim 'that\n      it would not be economic for Chesapeake to drill a regular well is not sufficient to establish that an.\n      exception at the proposed location is necessary to afford it a reasonable opportunity to recover the\n      reserves in the Green Gas Unit. Therefore, the examiners do not believe that this argument supports\n      Chesapeake's request for a well at the proposed location.\n\n      Chesapeake cannot Legally Assert a Confiscation Exception on an Alternative 160 acre unit.\n\n              Chesapeake alternatively argued that it is entitled to a fourth well on the easternmost 160\n      acres to prevent confiscation. This argument should be rejected because Chesapeake has not applied\n      for a well at an exception location on a 160 acre unit, and cannot carve out a portion of its Green Gas\n      Unit for consideration of an exception based on confiscation.\n\n              When an operator voluntarily designates a pooled unit for the purpose of permitting wells\n      or for subsequent production, any application for additional wells on the designated pooled unit must\n      stand or fall on the basis of the existing unit. Chesapeake created the Green Gas Unit by pooling\n      several tracts together for the purpose of cooperative development of 683 acres. When it formed the\n      pooled unit, it assigned its one existing well, the Green No. 1 for production purposes. It then\n      permitted and drilled two additional wells on the 683 acre unit. The current application for a fourth\n      well therefore must be considered under the existing 683 acre pooled unit.\n\n              This is particularly relevant when considering the potential application of Statewide Rule.\n      38(d)(3).' The Commission Form P-12 (Certificate of Pooling Authority) filed with the permit\n      applications for the Green No. 2 and No. 3 wells, as well as the proposed Green No. 4 well identifies\n      7 tracts which are substandard under the field rules for the Oak Hill (Cotton Valley) Field.\n\n\n\n                 Statewide Rule 38(d)(3) requires Commission approval of the dissolution of a pooled unit where the pooled unit\n      includes any tract composed of substandard acreage in the field.\n\n\n\n\n286\n\f      Rule 37 Case No. 0245869                                                                      Page 8\n      Proposal for Decision\n\n\n\n              Chesapeake could potentially dissolve the existing pooled unit. After Commission approval\n      of the unit dissolution under Statewide Rule 38(d)(3), it could then create a new pooled unit on 160\n      acres. However, until the Commission approves dissolution of the Green Gas Unit, any application\n      for a new well must be evaluated on the basis of the 683 acre unit Chesapeake voluntarily identified\n      when it assigned the Green No. 1 well to the unit, and permitted and drilled the Green No. 2 and No.\n      3 wells. Accordingly, Chesapeake's alternative argument that it is entitled to a well on the\n      easternmost 160 acres of the Green Gas Unit is not a legally permissible basis to support an\n      exception to prevent confiscation.\n\n                                                CONCLUSION\n\n             Chesapeake failed to establish that is entitled to an exception to Rule 37 to prevent\n      confiscation of natural gas underlying the Green Gas Unit in the Oak Hill (Cotton Valley) Field.\n      Accordingly, the application for an exception to Rule 37 should be denied.\n\n             Based on the record in this Docket, the examiners recommend adoption of the following\n      Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.\n\n                                              FINDINGS OF FACT\n\n      1.      Chesapeake Operating, Inc. (\"Applicant\" or \"Chesapeake\") seeks an exception to Statewide\n              Rule 37 to drill Well No. 4 on the-Green Gas Unit Lease, Oak Hill (Cotton Valley) Field.\n              Chesapeake has also requested an exception to the maximum diagonal requirement for the\n              proposed proration unit associated with the Green No. 4 well.\"Chesapeake appeared at the\n              hearing and presented evidence in support of its application.\n\n      2.      The application is protested by Anadarko E & P Company, L.P. (\"Anadarko\"), the offset\n              operator on both sides of the river tract where the proposed well is-located. Anadarko also\n              appeared at the hearing.\n\n      3.      The Green Gas Unit is an irregularly shaped 683 acre pooled unit which includes land owned\n              by the State of Texas and private lands. The 307.8 acres owned by the state is an\n              approximately 10 mile long section of the Sabine River. The remaining 375.2 acres are\n              privately owned tracts. The proposed well would be the fourth' well on the unit.\n\n      4.      The Oak Hill (Cotton Valley) Field is subject to spacing requirements of 467 feet minimum\n              distance to the nearest lease line and 1200 feet minimum distance between wells. The\n              maximum diagonal requirement for the Oak Hill (Cotton Valley) Field is 5500 feet for 160\n              acre units, 3250 feet for 80 acre units, and 2100 feet for 40 acre units.\n\n      5.      The proposed bottom hole location is in the center of the river tract, 75 feet from the\n              offsetting property on both sides.\n\n\n\n287\n\f      Rule 37 Case No. 0245869                                                                       • Page 9\n      Proposal for Decision\n\n\n\n      6.     . Chesapeake proposes two alternative proration units for its Green No. 4 Well. The first unit\n               includesl76 acres with a diagonal of approximately 58,000 feet. This lengthy diagonal is\n               required because the proposed unit assigns a portion of the entire length of the Sabine River\n               tract to the Green No. 4 Well. Alternatively, Chesapeake proposes a 40 acre proration unit\n               with a diagonal of approximately 15,815 feet. The 40 acre proration unit assigns a portion\n               of the river tract from the general vicinity of the proposed well to the easternmost terminus\n               of the river tract, approximately 3 miles from the proposed location.\n\n      7.      Regular locations exist on the Green Gas Unit in the Oak Hill (Cotton Valley) Field.\n\n      8.      Chesapeake did not provide evidence establishing that regular locations on the Green Gas\n              unit would not afford it a reasonable opportunity to recover the reserves currently\n              underlying the subject lease in the Oak Hill (Cotton Valley) Field.\n\n      9.      Chesapeake did not provide reliable evidence of the estimated current recoverable reserves\n              underlying the Green Gas Unit.\n\n              a.      The Oak Hill (Cotton Valley)' Field is productive from the lower Taylor sand, a\n                      uniform marine bar deposit, and from the Upper Cotton Valley, a group of\n                      independent sand lenses formed in a fluvial depositional environment.\n\n              b.   • The Taylor sand is a structural trap while the Upper Cotton Valley is a series of\n                      laterally discontinuous sands which form stratigraphic traps.\n\n              c.      Both formations are recognized as tight and require fracture stimulation of the\n                      producing interval.\n\n              d.      The Upper Cotton Valley is described as \"hit and miss\" and does not exhibit a\n                      reliable trend within the Green Gas Unit:\n\n              e.      Chesapeake inappropriately evaluated the Oak Hill (Cotton Valley) Field in its\n                      hydrocarbon pore volume and net pay maps by aggregating the Upper Cotton Valley\n                      sand with the Taylor sand in its analysis.\n\n              f.      Published studies of the Oak Hill (Cotton Valley) Field relied on by both parties\n                      specifically caution against using the Upper Cotton Valley as a predictive tool of\n                      estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) trends.\n\n             g.       Chesapeake's analysis considered the two intervals together and then mapped the\n                      cumulative total to provide the basis for the volumetric analysis.\n\n\n\n\n288\n\f      Rule 37 Case No. 0245869                                                                        Page 10\n      Proposal for Decision\n\n                                             CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\n      1.

McBeathJ P.B., and the Railroad\n\n      Commission filings for the Comstrock Oil & Gas, LP #11-I Lucas \"A\". well. and the .Murphy\n\n      Exploration and Production #111 Herbst \"B\" well, as well as the relevant portion of the Oil, Gas\n\n      and Mineral Leases covering the land where the Herbst well is drilled. I have been asked whether\n\n      the term \"offset well\" is a specialized term within the industry, and what its 'commonly\n\n      understood meaning is within the industry. More specifically, I have Veen asked whether. the\n\n      Murphy OH Herbst '13\" Well is an \"offset well\" to the Comstock #114 1i,ucas \"A\" Welt, as that\n\n      term is used in Paragraph 25 of the Herbst leases.\n\n              5.      It is ray opinion that the Murphy -#1H. Herbst \"B\" Well is not an \"Offset well\" to\n\n      the Comstock #1.H. Lucas \"A\" Well, as that term is used in 'the industry] and in the oil and gas.\n\n      lease. An \"offset well\", as that term is used in the industry, is a. well drille4 as close as.possible to\n\n      the offending well in order 'to prevent or minimize drainage from -the feased premises by the,\n\n      offending well.\n\n              6.     • It is my understanding that there is no dispute that the gioveming Oil, Gas, and\n\n      Mineral Leases are in effect and contain a Paragraph 25 with the \"offset 4vell provision\", that the\n\n      Comstock well was permitted and actually drilled closer than the 467' buffer provided by the\n\n      offset :Well provision, and that. Murphy is relying upon the Herbst \"B\" OH well to satisfy the\n\n      remedies .reqUired by the lease when. a well is drilled within. 467 feet of the leased premises.\n\n\n\n\n                                                         2\n                                                                                                       208321.9:1\n\n\n\n239\n\f              7.\n                                  •                                         •\n                      Mr. McBeath's affidavit has two arguments to support his opinion that the\n\n       Murphy CH Herbst \"B\" Well satisfies Murphy's obligations under Paragraph 25 of the Herbst\n\n       leases: First, Mr. McBeath makes a distinction between the term. \"offset Well\" and the conjecture\n\n      of a more specifically used term in the industry of \"direct offset well\". Second, Mr. McBeath\n\n      argues that the lease provision relating to. an offset well has nothing to do with the potential for\n\n      drainage of the leased premises by the Comstock well (\"Plaintiffs contention that an offset well,\n\n      as used in the Lease, exists to protect their acreage from drainage is not! correct.\" — Mel3eath,\n\n      page 6). Neither of these arguments has any credibility based upon conventional oilfield usage,\n\n      traditional' construction. of the English language nor Common seti8e,\n\n              8.      Regarding Mr. McBeath's argument as to the purpose or Paragraph 25 of the\n\n      leases: based upon my involvement in the 'construction of several hundredi' oil and gas leases, and\n\n      specifically over one hundred oil and gas leases in the past five years 4r the development of\n                                                                                 i\n      Eagle Ford Shale reserves, the inclusion of a provision such as the one in Paragraph 25 requiring.\n\n      'remedies by the Lessee should a well be drilled on offset acreage has only one, sole purpose - to\n\n      prevent, compensate and mitigate the drainage of the leased premises ig the offending well.\n\n      Common sense precludes any other construction. In fact, Paragraph 25 requires .the lessee to drill\n\n      an \"offset well\" if an offending well is drilled, which is specifically defined in the lease as a well\n\n      drilled within 467' of the leased premises, Which at the time the lease was executed, defined a\n\n      well drilled closer to the lease than Railroad Commission rules would allOw. The stated distance\n\n      of a well from the leased premises defines the specific intent that the coriesponding location of\n\n      an \"off-set well\" drilled under Paragraph 2'5 (1) should be equally as close to the offending well\n\n      as possible to protect the Lessors' reserves from drainage by the offending well. For Murphy to\n\n      state that the Herbst well, located over 2100 feet away from the offending well and being also as\n\n\n\n                                                        3\n                                                                                                    2083219.1\n240\n\f                                                                           S\n       far away as the configuration of the lease would allow, satisfies the Leases' offset remedy cannot\n\n      be. supported by standard oilfield practice, the intent of the parties in negotiating the lease, or\n\n      common sense.\n\n               9.       Mr. McBeath's attempt to explain a presumed difference between \"an offset well\"\n\n      and \"a direct offset well\" has no basis in standard oilfield practices. I, Have never seen in any\n\n      written contract nor heard in any conversation, such a distinction being made. Asserting that\n\n      there is no connection between. the term \"offset well\" and a specific distance from a lease line is\n\n      a contrived and desperate attempt to explain .Mtuphy's actions in this !matter. It deserves no\n\n      further i:ebtittal.\n\n               10.. In the highly competitive and intense development setting ,of the Eagle Ford Shale\n\n      Trend, it has been my practice and that of my partners in the drilling of over 300 wells across-\n\n      265,000 acres, to contact offset operators prior to setting up a drilling pattern that begins 330 feet\n\n      from the common property boundary. There are numerous alternatives to; starting a development\n\n      program on an adjacent lease to another operator rather than drilling the losest offset.well first.\n\n      To do so without- attempting to contact the offset operator first is akin t4 dropping -the glove\n\n      start a duel. Likewise, should this event -occur, it is incomprehensibly that a Lessee would\n\n      unilaterally drill a. knowingly contentious location such as' the Iviurphyi #1-H Herbst \"B\" Well\n\n      without conducting transparent conversations with the Lessors first. If the Herbst tract of land\n\n      Merited the drilling of a well, there was no purpose served for either MUrphy or the Lessors by\n\n      leaving the potential for drainage by the offsetting Comstock well un4hallenged. in fact, the\n\n      proper development of the Herbst tract Will require at least two additional wells, which will both\n\n      be significantly closer to the Comstock well than the current Herbst \"B\" Well, There is nothing in\n\n      the facts, viewed through the' perspective of standard oilfield practices. nor in Mr.. McBeath's\n\n\n\n                                                       4.\n                                                                                                   2083219.1\n241\n\f                                   •                                     •\n      affidavit., (which become specious when viewed through the perspective of the standard\n\n      construction of the English language and by common sense); that supports Murphy's claim that\n\n      its # l H Herbst \"B\" Well is an adequate remedy to satisfy its obligations under Paragraph 25 for\n\n      protection froth an offending offset well. \"\n\n\n\n  •FURTHER, AFFIANT SAYETH NOT\n\n\n\n\n      STATE OF TEXAS\n\n      COUNTY OFNUECES\n\n              •Subscribed and sworn to before me, the undersigned authority on this the:.ieday of April,\n      2014.\n\n\n\n                      DOWANNVE$MER\n                     MYtOMMI$SION.

And frankl y, my\n\n11   rul i ng was and sti II is that Murphy compl i ed with the\n\n12   speci fi c terms of the I ease.     That Mr. Stei n1 e i f he\n\n13   wanted and the parti es wanted to I i mi t where that\n\n14   offset dri I I needed to be pl aced on the adj acent\n\n15   property in terms of how many feet from the I ease\n\n16   I i ne that coul d have been put i n the I ease, but i t\n\n17   wasn' t.    And so the wel I was dri I I ed wi thi n the\n\n18   ti meframe requi red. And the Court has found i t to be\n\n19   an offset wel I. And the Court of Appeal s may very\n\n20   wel I tel I me that was i ncorrect.       And I wel come that\n\n21   fi ndi ng i f that i s the fi ndi ng.   I am not a big fan\n\n22   of I I mi ti ng parti es access to the courts.     And\n\n23   frankl y my thinking on not awarding attorney's fees\n\n24   as a result of the tri al proceeding was that the\n\n25   PI ai nti ffs were certai n1 y enti tI ed to thei r thoughts\n\n\n                              (210) 415-6628\n\f                                                             47\n\n 1   as to the offset well needing to be drilled closer\n\n 2   and had the right to present their arguments to the\n\n 3   Court for the Court to make a determination on that,\n\n 4   and should not be penalized by having to pay huge\n\n 5   amounts of attorney's fees. And so attorney's fees\n\n 6   were not awarded. And I will change my order to the\n\n 7   extent of reducing the amount of attorney's fees\n\n 8   reasonable and necessary on appeal. And the Court of\n\n 9   Appeals can then determine whether or not that's an\n\n10   appropriate decision by this Court as well.    So fix\n\n11   me up something that comports with my ruling, y'all\n\n12   both sign i t, and I will be happy to sign it as well.\n\n13                MS.

A copy of this letter is also being mailed to the\n      Honorable Russell Wilson, the district judge now presiding over this case.\n\n              I was the attorney who drafted the leases at issue in this case. In particular, I drafted the\n      offset clause provision in both leases. I have prepared hundreds of leasps that contain this same\n      offset clause provision for mineral interest owners in this -part of the State. The ruling in this\n      case — which allows a well located anywhere on the leased property to constitute an offset well —\n      effectively renders meaningless these offset clause provisioni and will -adversely impact all -of-\n      these mineral interest owners. This offset well provision is intended to protect against drainage.\n      I purposefully omitted the word drainage from the test for the offending well because of the\n      difficulty and expense involved in proving that an offending well is draining the lease tract. By,\n      using a stipulated distance of 467 feet from the lease line, the parties contractually agree that any\n      well drilled within 467 feet of the lease line is draining the lease tract. However, to protect\n      against drainage, the offset well should be drilled as close as reasonably possible; but in any\n      event within the stipulated 467 feet from the lease line, next to the well it is intended to offset.\n      To say, as a matter of law, that a well drilled more than three times this contractual drainage\n      distance of 467 feet is an offset well completely negates the intent and contractual protection of\n      this clause.\n\n                                                             Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n\n\n          ,FILED• . ) -          O'CLOCK -    M              Alffed A.

A person acquainted with the facts pertinent to the application shall\ncertify that all facts stated in it are true and within the knowledge of that person.\n\n   (A) When an exception to only the minimum lease-line spacing requirement is desired, the\napplicant shall file a list of the mailing addresses of all affected persons, who, for tracts closer to\nthe well than the greater of one-half of the prescribed minimum between-well spacing distance or\nthe minimum lease-line spacing distance, include:\n\n   (i) the designated operator;\n\n   (ii) all lessees of record for tracts that have no designated operator; and\n\n   (iii) all owners of record of unleased mineral interests.\n\n   (B) When an exception to the minimum between-well spacing requirement of this section is\ndesired, the applicant is required to file the mailing addresses of those persons identified in\nsubparagraph (A)(i)-(iii) of this paragraph for each adjacent tract and each tract nearer to the well\nthan the greater of one-half the prescribed minimum between-well spacing distance or the\nminimum lease-line spacing.\n\f (3) An exception may be granted pursuant to subsection (h)(2) of this section, or after a public\nhearing held after at least 10 days notice to all persons described in paragraph (2) of this\nsubsection. At any such hearing, the burden shall be on the applicant to establish that an exception\nto this section is necessary either to prevent waste or to prevent the confiscation of property. For\npurposes of giving notice of an application for an exception, the commission will presume that\nevery person described in paragraph (2) of this subsection will be affected by the application,\nunless the Oil and Gas Division director or the director's delegate determines they are unaffected.\nSuch determination will be made only upon written request and a showing by the applicant that:\n\n   (A) competent, conclusive geological or engineering data indicate that no drainage of\nhydrocarbons from the particular tract(s) subject to the request will occur due to production from\nthe applicant's proposed well; and\n\n  (B) notice to the particular operator(s), lessee(s) of record, or owner(s) of record of unleased\nmineral interest would be unduly burdensome or expensive.\n\n(b) The distances mentioned in subsection (a) of this section are minimum distances to provide\nstandard development on a pattern of one well to each 40 acres in areas where proration units have\nnot been established.\n\n(c) In filing an application for an exception to the distance requirements of this section, in addition\nto the plat requirements in §3.5 of this title (relating to Application to Drill, Deepen, Reenter, or\nPlug Back) (Statewide Rule 5), the applicant shall attach to each copy of the form a plat that:\n\n (1) shows to scale the property on which the exception is sought; all other applied for, permitted,\nand completed oil, gas, or oil and gas wells in the same field and reservoir on said property; and all\nadjoining surrounding properties and completed wells in the same field and reservoir within the\nprescribed minimum between-well spacing distance of the applicant's well;\n\n (2) shows the entire lease, pooled unit, or unitized tract indicating the names and offsetting\nproperties of all affected offset operators;\n\n (3) corresponds to the listing required under subsection (a)(2) of this section;\n\n (4) is certified by a person acquainted with the facts pertinent to the application that the plat is\naccurately drawn to scale and correctly reflects all pertinent and required data.\n\n(d) In the interest of protecting life and for the purpose of preventing waste and preventing the\nconfiscation of property, the commission reserves the right in particular oil, gas, and geothermal\nresource fields to enter special orders increasing or decreasing the minimum distances provided by\nthis section.\n\f(e) No well drilled in violation of this section without special permit obtained, issued, or granted in\nthe manner prescribed in said section, and no well drilled under such special permit or on the\ncommission's own order which does not conform in all respects to the terms of such permit shall be\npermitted to produce either oil, gas, or geothermal resources and any such well so drilled in\nviolation of said section or on the commission's own order shall be plugged.\n\n(f) No operator shall commence the drilling of a well, either on a regular location or on a Rule 37\nexception location, until first having been notified by the commission that the regular location has\nbeen approved, or that the Rule 37 exception location has been approved. Failure of an operator to\ncomply with this subsection will cause such well to be closed in and the holding up of the\nallowable of such well.\n\n(g) Subdivision of property.\n\n  (1) In applying Rule 37 (Statewide Spacing Rule) of statewide application and in applying every\nspecial rule with relation to spacing in every field in this state, no subdivision of property made\nsubsequent to the adoption of the original spacing rule will be considered in determining whether or\nnot any property is being confiscated within the terms of such spacing rule, and no subdivision of\nproperty will be regarded in applying such spacing rule or in determining the matter of confiscation\nif such subdivision took place subsequent to the promulgation and adoption of the original spacing\nrule.\n\n (2) Any subdivision of property creating a tract of such size and shape that it is necessary to\nobtain an exception to the spacing rule before a well can be drilled thereon is a voluntary\nsubdivision and not entitled to a permit to prevent confiscation of property if it were either:\n\n  (A) segregated from a larger tract in contemplation of oil, gas, or geothermal resource\ndevelopment; or\n\n  (B) segregated by fee title conveyance from a larger tract after the spacing rule became effective\nand the voluntary subdivision rule attached.\n\n (3) The date of attachment of the voluntary subdivision rule is the date of discovery of oil, gas, or\ngeothermal resource production in a certain continuous reservoir, regardless of the subsequent\nlateral extensions of such reservoir, provided that such rule does not attach in the case of a\nsegregation of a small tract by fee title conveyance which is not located in an oil, gas, or\ngeothermal resource field having a discovery date prior to the date of such segregation.\n\n (4) The date of attachment of the voluntary subdivision rule for multiple reservoir fields located in\nthe same structural feature and separated vertically but not laterally (i.e., the multiple reservoirs\noverlap geographically at least in part), shall be the same date as that assigned to the earliest\ndiscovery well for such multiple reservoir structure.\n\f (5) If a newly discovered reservoir is located outside the then productive limits of any previously\ndiscovered reservoirs and is classified by the commission as a newly discovered field, then the date\nof discovery of such newly found reservoir remains the date of attachment for the voluntary\nsubdivision rule, even though subsequent development may result in the extension of such newly\ndiscovered reservoir until it overlies or underlies older reservoirs with prior discovery dates.\n\n  (6) The date of attachment of the voluntary subdivision rule for a reservoir that has been\ndeveloped through expansion of separately recognized fields into a recognized single reservoir and\nis merged by commission order is the earliest discovery date of production from such merged\nreservoir, and that date will be used subsequent to the date of merger of the fields into a single\nfield.\n\n (7) The date of attachment of the voluntary subdivision rule for a reservoir under any special\ncircumstance which the commission deems sufficient to provide for an exception may be\nestablished other than as prescribed in this section, so that innocent parties may have their rights\nprotected.\n\n(h) Exceptions to Rule 37.\n\n (1) An order granting exception to Rule 37 wherein protest is had shall carry as its last paragraph\nthe following language: It is further ordered by the commission that this order shall not be final\nuntil 20 days after it is actually mailed to the parties by the commission; provided that if a motion\nfor rehearing of the application is filed by any party at interest within such 20-day period, this order\nshall not become final until such motion is overruled, or if such motion is granted, this order shall\nbe subject to further action by the commission. Permits issued pursuant to paragraph (2) of this\nsubsection shall be issued without the 20-day waiting period.\n\n (2) The director of the Oil and Gas Division or a delegate of the director may issue an exception\npermit for drilling, deepening, or additional completion, recompletion, or reentry in an existing well\nbore if:\n\n     (A) a notice of at least 10 days has been given, and no protest has been made to the application;\nor\n\n  (B) written waivers of objection are received from all persons to whom notice would be given\npursuant to subsection (a)(2) of this section.\n\n (3) Applications filed for drilling, deepening, or additional completion, recompletion, or reentry\nwill be processed and permit issued in accordance with this regulation, subject to the commission's\ndiscretion to set any application for hearing. If the director or a delegate of the director declines to\ngrant an application, the operator may request a hearing.\n\n(i) Rule 37 permits.\n\f (1) Unless otherwise specified in a permit or in a final order granting an exception to this section,\npermits issued by the commission for completions requiring an exception to this section shall\nexpire two years from the effective date of the permit unless drilling operations are commenced in\ngood faith within the two-year permit period. The permit period will not be extended.\n\n (2) So long as a Rule 37 exception is in litigation, the two-year permit period will not commence.\nOn final adjudication and decree from the last court of appeal the two-year permit period will\ncommence, beginning on the date of final decree.\n\n(j) Once an application for a spacing exception has been denied, no new application shall be\nentertained except on changed conditions. Changed conditions in the commission's administration\nof its Spacing Rule 37 and amendments thereto applicable to the various special fields and\nreservoirs of Texas and in passing upon applications for permits under said rule and amendments\nshall include, among other things, the following.\n\n (1) Any material changes in the physical conditions of the producing reservoir under the tract\nunder consideration or under the area surrounding said tract which would materially affect the\nrecovery of oil, gas, or geothermal resource from the given tract.\n\n (2) Any material changes in the distribution or allocation of allowable production in the area\nsurrounding the tract under consideration which would materially affect or tend to affect the\nrecovery of oil, gas, or geothermal resource from the given tract.\n\n (3) Any additional permits granted by the commission for wells drilled in the area surrounding or\non offset tracts to the tract under consideration which would materially affect or tend to affect the\nrecovery of oil, gas, or geothermal resource from the given tract.\n\n (4) Any additional facts or evidence thereof materially affecting or tending to affect the recovery\nof oil, gas, or geothermal resource from the applicant's tract, or the property rights of applicant,\nwhich were not known of and considered by the commission at any previous hearing or application\nthereon.\n\n(k) Exceptions to Statewide Rule 37 apply to the total depth for which the permit is granted or if\nspecial field rules are applicable, an exception to the spacing rule shall be granted only for the\nreservoir or reservoirs or applicable depth to which the well is projected. Subsequent recompletion\nof the well to reservoirs other than that covered by the permit issued would be granted only after\nthe filing and processing of a new application.\n\n(1) Salt dome oil or gas fields.\n\n (1) The provisions of this section shall not apply to certain approved salt dome oil or gas fields.\nAn application for classification as a salt dome oil or gas field shall include the following:\n\f   (A) geological evidence proving that an oil or gas field is a piercement-type salt dome, that\nfaulting has caused the producing formation to be at a 45 angle or greater, and that each well is\nlikely to be completed in a separate reservoir;\n\n  (B) establishment, by plat or otherwise, of the probable productive limits of the salt dome area;\n\nCont'd...\n\n\n                                Next Page            Previous Page\n\n\n                                  List of Titles         Back to List\n\n\n              HOME    TEXAS REGISTER       TEXAS ADMINISTRATIVE CODE    OPEN MEETINGS\n\f<<Prey Rule                                                                               Next Rule»\n                             Texas Administrative Code\n                    TITLE 16             ECONOMIC REGULATION\n                    PART 1               RAILROAD COMMISSION OF TEXAS\n                    CHAPTER 3            OIL AND GAS DIVISION\n                    RULE §3.46           Fluid Injection into Productive Reservoirs\n\n(a) Permit required. Any person who engages in fluid injection operations in reservoirs productive\nof oil, gas, or geothermal resources must obtain a permit from the commission. Permits may be\nissued when the injection will not endanger oil, gas, or geothermal resources or cause the pollution\nof freshwater strata unproductive of oil, gas, or geothermal resources. Permits from the commission\nissued before the effective date of this section shall continue in effect until revoked, modified, or\nsuspended by the commission.\n\n(b) Filing of application.\n\n (1) Application.\n\n   (A) An application to conduct fluid injection operations in a reservoir productive of oil, gas, or\ngeothermal resources shall be filed in Austin on the form prescribed by the commission\naccompanied by the prescribed fee. On the same date, one copy shall be filed with the appropriate\ndistrict office. The form shall be executed by a party having knowledge of the facts entered on the\nform.\n\n  (B) The applicant shall file the freshwater injection data form if fresh water is to be injected.\n\n  (C) The applicant for a disposal well permit under this section shall include with the permit\napplication a printed copy or screenshot showing the results of a survey of information from the\nUnited States Geological Survey (USGS) regarding the locations of any historical seismic events\nwithin a circular area of 100 square miles (a circle with a radius of 9.08 kilometers) centered\naround the proposed disposal well location.\n\n   (D) The commission may require an applicant for a disposal well permit under this section to\nprovide the commission with additional information such as logs, geologic cross-sections, pressure\nfront boundary calculations, and/or structure maps, to demonstrate that fluids will be confined if the\nwell is to be located in an area where conditions exist that may increase the risk that fluids will not\nbe confined to the injection interval. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, complex\ngeology, proximity of the basement rock to the injection interval, transmissive faults, and/or a\nhistory of seismic events in the area as demonstrated by information available from the USGS.\n\f (2) Commercial disposal well. An applicant for a permit to dispose of oil and gas waste in a\ncommercial disposal well shall clearly indicate on the application and in the notice of application\nthat the application is for a commercial disposal well permit. For the purposes of this rule,\n\"commercial disposal well\" means a well whose owner or operator receives compensation from\nothers for the disposal of oil field fluids or oil and gas wastes that are wholly or partially trucked or\nhauled to the well, and the primary business purpose for the well is to provide these services for\ncompensation.\n\n(c) Notice and opportunity for hearing.\n\n  (1) The applicant shall give notice by mailing or delivering a copy of the application to affected\npersons who include the owner of record of the surface tract on which the well is located; each\ncommission-designated operator of any well located within one half mile of the proposed injection\nwell; the county clerk of the county in which the well is located; and the city clerk or other\nappropriate city official of any city where the well is located within the corporate limits of the city,\non or before the date the application is mailed to or filed with the commission. For the purposes of\nthis section, the term \"of record\" means recorded in the real property or probate records of the\ncounty in which the property is located.\n\n (2) In addition to the requirements of subsection (c)(1), a commercial disposal well permit\napplicant shall give notice to owners of record of each surface tract that adjoins the proposed\ninjection tract by mailing or delivering a copy of the application to each such surface owner.\n\n (3) If, in connection with a particular application, the commission or its delegate determines that\nanother class of persons should receive notice of the application, the commission or its delegate\nmay require the applicant to mail or deliver a copy of the application to members of that class. Such\nclasses of persons could include adjacent surface owners or underground water conservation\ndistricts.\n\n (4) In order to give notice to other local governments, interested, or affected persons, notice of the\napplication shall be published once by the applicant in a newspaper of general circulation for the\ncounty where the well will be located in a form approved by the commission or its delegate. The\napplicant shall file with the commission in Austin proof of publication prior to the hearing or\nadministrative approval.\n\n (5) Protested applications:\n\n  (A) If a protest from an affected person or local government is made to the commission within\n15 days of receipt of the application or of publication, whichever is later, or if the commission or its\ndelegate determines that a hearing is in the public interest, then a hearing will be held on the\napplication after the commission provides notice of hearing to all affected persons, local\ngovernments, or other persons, who express an interest, in writing, in the application.\n\f  (B) For purposes of this section, \"affected person\" means a person who has suffered or will\nsuffer actual injury or economic damage other than as a member of the general public or as a\ncompetitor, and includes surface owners of property on which the well is located and commission-\ndesignated operators of wells located within one-half mile of the proposed disposal well.\n\n (6) If no protest from an affected person is received by the commission, the commission's delegate\nmay administratively approve the application. If the commission's delegate denies administrative\napproval, the applicant shall have a right to a hearing upon request. After hearing, the examiner\nshall recommend a final action by the commission.\n\n(d) Subsequent commission action.\n\n  (1) An injection well permit may be modified, suspended, or terminated by the commission for\njust cause after notice and opportunity for hearing, if:\n\n   (A) a material change of conditions occurs in the operation or completion of the injection well,\nor there are material changes in the information originally furnished;\n\n  (B) fresh water is likely to be polluted as a result of continued operation of the well;\n\n  (C) there are substantial violations of the terms and provisions of the permit or of commission\nrules;\n\n  (D) the applicant has misrepresented any material facts during the permit issuance process;\n\n  (E) injected fluids are escaping from the permitted injection zone;\n\n  (F) for a disposal well permit under this section, injection is likely to be or determined to be\ncontributing to seismic activity; or\n\n  (G) waste of oil, gas, or geothermal resources is occurring or is likely to occur as a result of the\npermitted operations.\n\n  (2) An injection well permit may be transferred from one operator to another operator provided\nthat the commission's delegate does not notify the present permit holder of an objection to the\ntransfer prior to the date the lease is transferred on commission records.\n\n (3) Voluntary permit suspension.\n\n   (A) An operator may apply to temporarily suspend its injection authority by filing a written\nrequest for permit suspension with the commission in Austin, and attaching to the written request\nthe results of an MIT test performed during the previous three-month period in accordance with the\nprovisions of subsection (j)(4) of this section. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to\nany well that is permitted as a commercial injection well.\n\f   (B) The commission or its delegate may grant the permit suspension upon determining that the\nresults of the MIT test submitted under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph indicate that the well\nmeets the performance standards of subsection (j)(4) of this section.\n\n   (C) During the period of permit suspension, the operator shall not use the well for injection or\ndisposal purposes.\n\n   (D) During the period of permit suspension, the operator shall comply with all applicable well\ntesting requirements of §3.14 of this title (relating to plugging, and commonly referred to as\nStatewide Rule 14) but need not perform the MIT test that would otherwise be required under the\nprovisions of subsection (j)(4) of this section or the permit. Further, during the period of permit\nsuspension, the provisions of subsection (i)(1) - (3) of this section shall not apply.\n\n  (E) The operator may reinstate injection authority under a suspended permit by filing a written\nnotification with the commission in Austin. The written notification shall be accompanied by an\nMIT test performed during the three-month period prior to the date notice of reinstatement is filed.\nThe MIT test shall have been performed in accordance with the provisions and standards of\nsubsection (j)(4) of this section.\n\n(e) Area of Review.\n\n (1) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the applicant shall review the data of public\nrecord for wells that penetrate the proposed disposal zone within a 1/4 mile radius of the proposed\ndisposal well to determine if all abandoned wells have been plugged in a manner that will prevent\nthe movement of fluids from the disposal zone into freshwater strata. The applicant shall identify in\nthe application any wells which appear from such review of public records to be unplugged or\nimproperly plugged and any other unplugged or improperly plugged wells of which the applicant\nhas actual knowledge.\n\n (2) The commission or its delegate may grant a variance from the area-of-review requirements of\nparagraph (1) of this subsection upon proof that the variance will not result in a material increase in\nthe risk of fluid movement into freshwater strata or to the surface. Such a variance may be granted\nfor an area defined both vertically and laterally (such as a field) or for an individual well. An\napplication for an areal variance need not be filed in conjunction with an individual permit\napplication or application for permit amendment. Factors that may be considered by the\ncommission or its delegate in granting a variance include:\n\n  (A) the area affected by pressure increases resulting from injection operations;\n\n  (B) the presence of local geological conditions that preclude movement of fluid that could\nendanger freshwater strata or the surface; or\n\f   (C) other compelling evidence that the variance will not result in a material increase in the risk of\nfluid movement into freshwater strata or to the surface.\n\n (3) Persons applying for a variance from the area-of-review requirements of paragraph (1) of this\nsubsection on the basis of factors set out in paragraph (2)(B) or (C) of this subsection for an\nindividual well shall provide notice of the application to those persons given notice under the\nprovisions of subsection (c)(1) of this section. The provisions of subsection (c) of this section shall\napply in the case of an application for a variance from the area-of-review requirements for an\nindividual well.\n\n (4) Notice of an application for an areal variance from the area-of-review requirements under\nparagraph (1) of this subsection shall be given on or before the date the application is filed with the\ncommission:\n\n   (A) by publication once in a newspaper having general circulation in each county, or portion\nthereof, where the variance would apply. Such notice shall be in a form approved by the\ncommission or its delegate prior to publication and must be at least three inches by five inches in\nsize. The notice shall state that protests to the application may be filed with the commission during\nthe 15-day period following the date of publication. The notice shall appear in a section of the\nnewspaper containing state or local news items;\n\n   (B) by mailing or delivering a copy of the application, along with a statement that any protest to\nthe application should be filed with the commission within 15 days of the date the application is\nfiled with the commission, to the following:\n\n   (i) the manager of each underground water conservation district in which the variance would\napply, if any;\n\n   (ii) the city clerk or other appropriate official of each incorporated city in which the variance\nwould apply, if any;\n\n   (iii) the county clerk of each county in which the variance would apply; and\n\n    (iv) any other person or persons that the commission or its delegate determines should receive\nnotice of the application.\n\n (5) If a protest to an application for an areal variance is made to the commission by an affected\nperson, local government, underground water conservation district, or other state agency within 15\ndays of receipt of the application or of publication, whichever is later, or if the commission's\ndelegate determines that a hearing on the application is in the public interest, then a hearing will be\nheld on the application after the commission provides notice of the hearing to all local\ngovernments, underground water conservation districts, state agencies, or other persons, who\nexpress an interest, in writing, in the application. If no protest from an affected person is received\n\fby the commission, the commission's delegate may administratively approve the application. If the\napplication is denied administratively, the person(s) filing the application shall have a right to\nhearing upon request. After hearing, the examiner shall recommend a final action by the\ncommission.\n\nCont'd...\n\n\n                               Next Page             Previous Page\n\n                                  List of Titles         Back to List\n\n\n             HOME    TEXAS REGISTER        TEXAS ADMINISTRATIVE CODE    OPEN MEETINGS\n\f</pre>",
