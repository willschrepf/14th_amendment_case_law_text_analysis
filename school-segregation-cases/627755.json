Goodstein, Magistrate Judge.\n\n\n\n   A RGUED S EPTEMBER 7, 2010—D ECIDED F EBRUARY 3, 2012\n\n\n\n\n  Before F LAUM, R OVNER, and S YKES, Circuit Judges.\n  S YKES, Circuit Judge. We are asked in these consolidated\nappeals to review multiple procedural and substantive\norders in a long-running class-action lawsuit seeking\n\f2                                   Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\nstructural reform of special education in the Milwaukee\npublic school district. Under the Individuals with Dis-\nabilities Education Act (the “IDEA” or “the Act”), 20 U.S.C.\n§§ 1400 et seq., the States receive federal funding for\nthe education of disabled children on the condition that\ntheir local school districts comply with the procedural\nrequirements of the Act and provide a “free appropriate\npublic education” to all resident children with disabilities.\nId. § 1412(a)(1)(A). As relevant here, local districts must\nidentify children with disabilities, determine whether\nthese children require special-education services, and\ndevelop individualized education programs (“IEPs”)\ntailored to each student’s specific needs. Each step in the\nprocess is highly individualized because every child is\nunique.\n  In 2001 seven students with disabilities sued the Mil-\nwaukee Public Schools (“MPS”) and the Wisconsin De-\npartment of Public Instruction (“DPI”) on behalf of them-\nselves and a class of “all school age children with dis-\nabilities who reside in the Milwaukee Public School\nDistrict boundaries and who are or may be eligible for\nspecial education and related services under IDEA and\nWisconsin law.” The complaint alleged widespread\nviolations of the IDEA touching on nearly every aspect\nof MPS’s implementation of the Act. The district court\nrejected the plaintiffs’ ambitious proposed class but\ncertified a somewhat more modest one: students eligible\nto receive special education from MPS “who are, have\nbeen or will be” denied or delayed entry into or partic-\nipation in the IEP process. This narrower class definition\nhad the effect of focusing the case on alleged violations\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                     3\n\nof the so-called “child find” requirements of the IDEA.\nId. § 1412(a)(3)(A).\n  The district court held a bench trial and found MPS\nand DPI liable for various “systemic” IDEA violations.\nDPI then settled with the class by agreeing to order MPS\nto meet certain compliance benchmarks; the district court\napproved the settlement over MPS’s objection. On June 9,\n2009, the court ordered a complex remedial scheme\nrequiring MPS to set up a court-monitored system to\nidentify disabled children who were delayed or denied\nentry into the IEP process, implement “hybrid” IEP\nmeetings, and craft compensatory-education remedies.\n   MPS appealed the remedial order and also challenged\nthe district court’s class-certification decision, the\nliability order, and the approval of the DPI settlement.\nThe plaintiffs sought review of the order rejecting their\nsweeping class definition but missed the filing deadline\nfor a cross-appeal. On August 19 the district court issued\ntwo follow-up orders appointing an independent\nmonitor and approving the class notice. The plaintiffs\nappealed from these orders but do not contest either\ndecision; instead, they ask us to review the order denying\ntheir original class-certification motion.\n   Both sides moved to dismiss on jurisdictional grounds.\nWe took the motions with the merits and now dismiss\nthe plaintiffs’ appeal. The orders from which the plain-\ntiffs appealed are not final orders; nor are they the equiva-\nlent of injunctions, so they do not qualify for immediate\nappeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). Moreover, the plain-\ntiffs are attempting a flagrantly improper procedural\n\f4                                   Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\nmaneuver; they may not revive their untimely appeal\nby appealing from orders they do not want reviewed.\nWe deny the motion to dismiss MPS’s appeal. The June 9\nremedial order is the functional equivalent of an injunc-\ntion and may be immediately appealed under § 1292(a)(1);\nwe have pendent appellate jurisdiction over the\nrelated orders.\n  On the merits we vacate the class-certification order.\nLike the Title VII claims in Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes,\n131 S. Ct. 2541 (2011), the IDEA claims in this case are\nhighly individualized and vastly diverse, making this\ncase unsuitable for class-action treatment under Rule 23\nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The class itself\nis fatally indefinite, the claims lack the commonality\nrequired by Rule 23(a)(2), and it’s not possible to order\nfinal injunctive or corresponding declaratory relief on a\nclass-wide basis, as required by Rule 23(b)(2). Because\nthe class should not have been certified, the liability\nand remedial orders must be vacated as well. Finally,\nDPI’s settlement with the class prejudiced MPS’s legal\nrights by requiring more of MPS than DPI had the statu-\ntory authority to demand. In any case, because the\nclass was certified in error, the order approving the\nDPI settlement must also be vacated.\n\n\n                      I. Background\nA. Legal Framework\n  The IDEA requires participating States to provide to\nall disabled students a “free appropriate public education.”\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                      5\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(1)(A). Complying with this require-\nment is a complex and inherently child-specific under-\ntaking. First, the IDEA requires that “[a]ll children with\ndisabilities residing in the State . . . and who are in need\nof special education and related services” be “identified,\nlocated, and evaluated,” a process known as “child find.”\nId. § 1412(a)(3)(A). Once a disabled child in need of\nspecial education is identified, the local school district\nmust evaluate the child’s specific needs and develop\nan “individualized educational program,” or “IEP,”\noutlining the particular special-education services that\nare necessary to allow the child to learn in the “least\nrestrictive environment.” Id. §§ 1412(a)(4)-(5), 1414. The\ncontent of an IEP and the meaning of “least restrictive\nenvironment” are nuanced topics that we need not\nexplore here. With limited exceptions, an “IEP Team”\nmust be convened and meet within 90 days of the child’s\ninitial referral, see W IS. S TAT. § 115.78(3)(a) (1998);1 the\nIEP Team must include various educational professionals\nand the child’s parent or guardian, see 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1414(d)(1)(B). Once an IEP is in place, the school must\nprovide the services listed in it, and the IDEA sets out\nmany rules governing the process of amending an IEP.\nThese topics, too, are beyond the scope of inquiry here.\n  To ensure that each disabled child receives a free ap-\npropriate public education, the IDEA also requires\nStates to provide various procedural safeguards to stu-\n\n\n\n1\n  The statutory time frame has since been shortened to\n60 days. See W IS . S TAT § 115.78(3)(a).\n\f6                                  Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\ndents and parents. See id. § 1415. A parent may file a\ncomplaint “with respect to any matter relating to the\nidentification, evaluation, or educational placement of\nthe child,” id. § 1415(b)(6)(A), and may request an\nimpartial due-process hearing to resolve the complaint,\nid. § 1415(f). After receiving a final decision from the\nhearing officer, the parent may appeal to the state educa-\ntional agency. Id. § 1415(g). Finally, a still-aggrieved\nparent may file a civil action seeking review of the deci-\nsion. Id. § 1415(i)(2). The IDEA also requires that parents\nbe given notice of their procedural rights at various\ntimes, including when the school district first proposes\nor refuses to evaluate a child for a disability. Id.\n§ 1415(b)(3), (c)(1).\n  Wisconsin implements the IDEA through sections\n115.758-115.90 of the Wisconsin Statutes, which track the\nIDEA’s requirements while adding functional detail.\nOne provision of particular importance here, section\n115.90, gives DPI—the state educational agency charged\nwith overseeing Wisconsin’s IDEA compliance—various\nenforcement mechanisms if individual schools or school\ndistricts are not fulfilling their statutory obligations.\nSpecifically, DPI may order a school district to submit\na “corrective plan” that addresses the area of noncom-\npliance, withhold state funding until the violation is\nfixed, or if the first two methods are unsuccessful, ask\nthe state attorney general to bring a lawsuit against the\nschool district to force compliance. W IS. S TAT. § 115.90.\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                  7\n\nB. Proceedings Below\n  The procedural history of this case is lengthy and\ncomplex; we will simplify where we can. In 2001 Jamie S.\nand six other named plaintiffs brought this class-action\nsuit against MPS and DPI alleging a host of IDEA viola-\ntions. Jamie is cognitively impaired and was at that time\nan eight-year-old student in an MPS school. The other\nnamed plaintiffs are (or were) MPS students with disabili-\nties ranging from deafness to Asperger’s syndrome to\nvarious emotional disturbances. The parties consented\nto the jurisdiction of a magistrate judge, see 28 U.S.C.\n§ 636(c)(1), and the plaintiffs moved to certify a class\nof all Milwaukee-area students who “are or may be\neligible for special education and related services under\nIDEA and Wisconsin law due to their disabilities.” The\nmagistrate judge declined to certify a class of this\nscope based largely on concerns about exhaustion of\nadministrative remedies. But the judge believed that\nsome of plaintiffs’ claims could be litigated as a class\nnotwithstanding their failure to exhaust administrative\nremedies.\n  To that end, the judge divided the proposed class\ninto two categories: those having “pre-determination\nclaims” and those having “post-determination claims.”\nThese were terms of the court’s own creation and referred\nto IDEA violations arising before an IEP meeting takes\nplace and IDEA violations arising after an IEP takes\nplace. Although the IDEA generally requires plaintiffs\nto use the administrative dispute-resolution process\nbefore filing suit, the judge thought that exhaustion of\n\f8                                  Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\nadministrative remedies for “pre-determination claims”\nwould be futile because parents of children with these\nkinds of claims might not know they have a right to\nadministrative review. For this reason the judge\nexcused, on a class-wide basis, the failure to exhaust\nadministrative remedies for pre-determination claims.\nOn the other hand, the judge thought that parents who\nhad attended an IEP meeting would understand their\nright to administrative review. Accordingly, the judge\nheld that the administrative system is adequate for post-\ndetermination claims and declined to excuse the exhaus-\ntion requirement for this category.\n  This approach meant the plaintiffs could litigate\ntheir pre-determination claims as a class, but their post-\ndetermination claims had to proceed individually (or\nnot at all if administrative remedies had not been ex-\nhausted). Accordingly, the judge invited the plaintiffs to\ntry again at class certification using the court’s pre-\ndetermination/post-determination distinction. After two\nmore rounds of briefing, the judge settled on his own\nclass definition. On November 14, 2003, the court entered\nan order certifying the following class:\n    Those students eligible for special education services\n    from the Milwaukee Public School System who are,\n    have been or will be either denied or delayed entry\n    or participation in the processes which result in a\n    properly constituted meeting between the IEP team\n    and the parents or guardians of the student.\n  Following class certification and several years of dis-\ncovery, the court conducted a two-phase bench trial on\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                   9\n\nliability. In Phase I the court heard testimony from\nexperts regarding MPS’s and DPI’s compliance with the\nIDEA. Satisfied that a full trial was warranted, the court\nconducted lengthy Phase II proceedings in which the\nparties presented further evidence regarding the basis for\nthe experts’ opinions. In a written decision issued on\nSeptember 11, 2007, the court found both MPS and DPI\nliable for “systemic” violations of the child-find require-\nments of the IDEA. Specifically, the court found that\nfrom September 2000 to June 2005, MPS committed the\nfollowing IDEA violations on a system-wide basis: it\nfailed to identify children with suspected disabilities\nand refer them for evaluation within the statutory 90-\nday time frame; improperly extended the 90-day time\nframe; imposed suspensions in a way that frustrated\ndisability referrals; and failed to ensure that parents\nattended IEP meetings. The court also found that DPI\nfailed in its oversight duties.\n  The court based its liability findings primarily on\nthe opinion testimony of Dr. Diana Rogers-Adkinson,\na special-education professor at the University of\nWisconsin-Whitewater who served as the plaintiffs’\nprimary expert. She reviewed approximately 200 MPS\nstudent files but engaged in no statistical analysis or\nother accepted analytical method to determine whether\nany particular violation of the IDEA could properly be\ncharacterized as “systemic.” Instead, she based her\nopinion entirely on “patterns” or “trends” she observed\nin the student files. During the time period in question,\nMPS annually enrolled 95,000 to 97,000 students, ap-\nproximately 16,000 of whom were eligible for special\n\f10                                  Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\neducation every year. Dr. Rogers-Adkinson did not\nexplain how a review of 200 student files could yield\na conclusion that MPS was in systemic violation of the\nIDEA during the relevant five-year period.\n   Indeed, the court’s 64-page liability order does not\ncontain any analysis subjecting Dr. Rogers-Adkinson’s\ntestimony to the standards applicable to expert witnesses\nunder Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. To the\ncontrary, the court expressly acknowledged that her\nopinion was not based on any scientific method but\ninstead rested on what she loosely termed a “qualitative\nanalysis” of the student files she reviewed. After iden-\ntifying “certain patterns” and “trends” in the student files,\nDr. Rogers-Adkinson simply “projected” the patterns and\ntrends “over the entire MPS district” and said she\n“believe[d] . . . the same trends would appear if a\nscientific or true random sampling of files had been\nconducted.” Without mentioning the requirements of\nRule 702, the court summarily accepted Dr. Rogers-\nAdkinson’s methodology as an adequate factual founda-\ntion for finding MPS in systemic violation of the IDEA:\n“The court accepts the qualitative analysis methodology\nused by Dr. Rogers-Adkinson. The court further\naccepts her Child Find trends or patterns and applies\nthem system wide to MPS.”\n  In response to the court’s liability order, DPI entered\ninto settlement negotiations with the plaintiff class and\neventually presented a settlement agreement to the\ncourt for approval. We will describe it in more detail\nlater, but in brief, DPI agreed to order MPS to meet\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                  11\n\nvarious compliance benchmarks within a certain time\nframe and to pay for an independent monitor to oversee\nMPS’s performance. In exchange the plaintiff class dis-\nmissed its claims against DPI and gave away the rights\nof class members to bring representative suits against\nDPI for IDEA violations predating the agreement. Over\nMPS’s vigorous objection, the district court approved\nthe settlement.\n   The case then proceeded to the remedial phase of the\ntrial against MPS alone. The court heard evidence\nand argument on possible remedies, and on November 17,\n2008, ordered the parties to submit posttrial briefs re-\ngarding their final remedial proposals. This order\nincluded two pages of detailed questions, the answers to\nwhich informed the content of the parties’ final pro-\nposals. For example, the court directed the parties to\naddress how putative members of the class were to be\nevaluated for inclusion in the class; how individual\nliability and compensatory-education determinations\nshould be made; which party should prevail when the\nevidence is inconclusive; how disputes between the\nparties should be resolved; and who should pay for the\ndispute-resolution process. The parties submitted briefs\noutlining their preferred remedies and responded to\neach other’s proposal.\n  On June 9, 2009, the court issued a lengthy order setting\nforth an elaborate court-monitored remedial scheme. The\ncourt ordered both general and specific class notice\ndesigned to reach the parent or guardian of as many\npotential class members as possible. Recipients would\n\f12                                 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\nidentify their children as potential class members by\nsubmitting response forms that would initiate a process\nof professional evaluation to determine whether or not\nthe child was a member of the class. The court ordered\nthe creation of a “hybrid” IEP team, closely resembling\nthe IEP team required by the IDEA but including a court-\nappointed independent monitor to oversee its operation.\n  The hybrid IEP team was charged with evaluating the\nresponses to the class notice to determine how to\nproceed in each individual case. In some cases it might be\nobvious that the child is not disabled, and no further\nevaluation would be required. In others a professional\nevaluation would be required to determine whether the\nchild has a disability. In others a full IEP meeting\nwould be needed to determine whether the child requires\nspecial-education services in order to receive a free ap-\npropriate public education. And finally, in some cases\nthe child might be entitled to compensatory education—\na remedy available under the IDEA—to compensate for\na past denial of a free appropriate public education.\nThe hybrid IEP team was given the authority to grant\ncompensatory-education awards, subject to the court’s\noversight. The estimated cost to MPS to implement this\nremedy: between $11.5 and $40 million, depending on\nhow many parents responded and the extent of the com-\npensatory education awarded to qualifying children.\n  The June 9 remedial order also rejected some of the\nremedial proposals made by the parties. For example, the\njudge rejected the plaintiffs’ request for a segregated\ncompensatory-education fund and for “parent advocates”\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                    13\n\nseparate from the independent monitor and denied\nMPS’s request for a binding-arbitration system to\nresolve disputes. Finally, the court ordered the parties to\nnegotiate regarding the independent monitor and the\nform of the class notice. If they could not agree, the\nparties were to submit nominations for the independent\nmonitor and a proposed class-notice form.\n  MPS appealed the June 9 remedial order and also\nsought review of the court’s class-certification decision,\nthe liability order, and the court’s order approving the\nDPI settlement. The plaintiffs sought review of the\ndistrict court’s rejection of their original class definition\nbut missed the deadline for filing a cross-appeal. In the\nmeantime the parties could not agree on an independent\nmonitor or class-notice form, so they submitted competing\nproposals on these two follow-on matters.\n  On August 19, 2009, the court entered an order naming\nthe independent monitor and charging her with the\nresponsibility of “implement[ing] the remedy set forth\nwithin” the June 9 order. This brief order also summarizes\nthe independent monitor’s duties, explains how she is to\nbe paid, and provides some detail about how she would\ninteract with the parties and the court. In a second order\nissued on August 19, the court approved the class-\nnotice form and explained how it should be distributed.\n   The plaintiffs appealed the August 19 orders, but they\nhave no quarrel with the substance of these decisions. That\nis, they do not disagree with the judge’s choice of an\nindependent monitor or the form of the class notice.\nInstead, they ask us to review the denial of their original\nclass-certification motion.\n\f14                                  Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\n  Both sides moved to dismiss the other’s appeal for\nlack of jurisdiction. MPS also moved to stay the June 9\nremedial order pending resolution of its appeal. We\nconsolidated the cases, stayed the remedial order, and\nasked the parties to brief the jurisdictional questions\nalong with the merits.\n\n\n                      II. Discussion\n  These consolidated appeals raise important procedural\nand substantive issues regarding the suitability of IDEA\nclaims for class certification, the kind and degree of\nevidence necessary to find a local school district in sys-\ntemic violation of the IDEA, and the propriety of a federal-\ncourt takeover of a school district’s special-education\nprogram as a remedy for individual IDEA violations.\nWe begin, however, with jurisdictional issues.\n\n\nA. Jurisdiction\n   Both appeals claim appellate jurisdiction under 28\nU.S.C. § 1292(a)(1), which permits immediate appeal\nfrom an interlocutory order “granting, continuing, modi-\nfying, refusing or dissolving” an injunction. Section\n1292(a)(1) “creates an exception from the long-established\npolicy against piecemeal appeals,” but “[t]he exception is\na narrow one and is keyed to the ‘need to permit\nlitigants to effectually challenge interlocutory orders of\nserious, perhaps irreparable, consequence.’ ” Gardner v.\nWestinghouse Broad. Co., 437 U.S. 478, 480 (1978) (quoting\nBalt. Contractors v. Bodinger, 348 U.S. 176, 181 (1955)).\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                           15\n\nAccordingly, mandatory interlocutory orders are con-\nsidered injunctions reviewable under § 1292(a)(1) “only\nif they effectively grant or withhold the relief sought on\nthe merits and affect one party’s ability to obtain such\nrelief in a way that cannot be rectified by a later appeal\n(that is, ‘irreparably’).” In re City of Springfield, Ill., 818 F.2d\n565, 567 (7th Cir. 1987) (citing Stringfellow v. Concerned\nNeighbors in Action, 480 U.S. 370, 377-79 (1987), and Carson\nv. Am. Brands, Inc., 450 U.S. 79, 84 (1981)). Stated differ-\nently, “[a]n order . . . is properly characterized as an\n‘injunction’ when it substantially and obviously alters\nthe parties’ pre-existing legal relationship.” Jones-El v.\nBerge, 374 F.3d 541, 544 (7th Cir. 2004) (citing Gautreaux\nv. Chi. Hous. Auth., 178 F.3d 951, 958 (7th Cir. 1999)).\n  The parties agree that by ordering the creation of\nthe hybrid IEP system, the district court granted an\ninjunction within the meaning of § 1292(a)(1), but they\ndisagree about which order achieved that result. MPS\nappealed from the June 9 remedial order and contends\nthat this order is the functional equivalent of an injunc-\ntion. The plaintiffs argue that MPS’s appeal was prema-\nture. They maintain that the remedial order did not fully\n“ripen” into an appealable injunction until the district\ncourt appointed the independent monitor and approved\nthe class notice on August 19.\n  The plaintiffs direct our attention to Sherpell v. Humnoke\nSchool District No. 5, 814 F.2d 538, 539-40 (8th Cir. 1987),\nand Groseclose v. Dutton, 788 F.2d 356, 361 (6th Cir. 1986),\nboth of which held that an order requiring parties to\nsubmit proposed remedial plans is generally not an\n\f16                                 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\ninjunction for purposes of § 1292(a)(1). In our decision\nin Springfield, we agreed with that general principle:\n“[O]nly directives awarding the relief plaintiffs seek or\nputting the case on a collision course with that relief are\n‘injunctions’ under § 1292(a)(1).” 818 F.2d at 568. The\nplaintiffs insist that the June 9 order was merely an\norder to formulate proposals for the independent\nmonitor and class notice and that it was only after the\nAugust 19 orders appointing the monitor and approving\nthe class notice that the hybrid IEP system was truly\nin place.\n  This characterization of the June 9 order is disingen-\nuous. It’s true that the court directed the parties\nto consult with each other about the identity of the inde-\npendent monitor and the form of the class notice, and\nto submit proposals if they could not agree. But the bulk\nof the court’s 71-page order was devoted to evaluating\nthe comprehensive remedial proposals the parties had\nalready submitted and explaining the elaborate remedial\nscheme the court had crafted. The order established in\nfine detail the remedial program MPS was required to\nimplement—a scheme designed to produce indi-\nvidualized compensatory-education awards, the ulti-\nmate relief sought in the case.\n  Although the June 9 order left the identity of the inde-\npendent monitor and the content of the class notice to\nbe worked out by the parties, MPS’s obligations were\nnot contingent on those details. Whoever the monitor, and\nwhatever the form of the class notice, the June 9 order\nrequired MPS to create a massive identification and\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                     17\n\nevaluation system consuming significant educational\nresources and costing millions of dollars. Even if the\nhybrid IEP system could not begin operating until the\nindependent monitor was appointed and the class\nnotice was approved, the June 9 order gave the plaintiffs\nthe relief they were seeking and substantially altered\nMPS’s legal rights. The remedial order is the functional\nequivalent of an injunction for purposes of § 1292(a)(1). See\nSpringfield, 818 F.2d at 568. We have jurisdiction over\nMPS’s appeal; the plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss is denied.\n  In contrast, the plaintiffs’ jurisdictional argument in\nsupport of their own appeal is at best inconsistent and at\nworst incoherent. The plaintiffs initially tried to cross-\nappeal from the June 9 remedial order, seeking review\nof the denial of their original class-certification mo-\ntion. But they missed the filing deadline, so they tried a\ndifferent route to get their preferred class definition\nbefore this court: They appealed the August 19 orders\nappointing the independent monitor and approving\nthe class notice, insisting that these orders are the “injunc-\ntion” for purposes of § 1292(a)(1). They are not. Unlike\nthe June 9 order, the August 19 orders do not grant relief\non the merits or substantively alter the parties’ legal\nrelationship. See Jones-El, 374 F.3d at 544; Springfield,\n818 F.2d at 567. They do not require the parties to do\nor refrain from doing anything at all. The district\ncourt had already announced the remedial scheme in\nthe June 9 order, including the appointment of an inde-\npendent monitor and the requirement of general and\nspecific class notice. All that remained was to decide the\nidentity of the monitor and approve the form of the\n\f18                                   Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\nclass notice. These details were surely important, but\nresolving them did not amount to an appealable injunc-\ntion. Cf. Jones-El, 374 F.3d at 544 (“[A]n unappealable\norder is one that interprets or clarifies a prior order and\ndoes not create new rights or obligations independently\nenforceable through a contempt action.”).\n  Moreover, the plaintiffs are plainly engaged in a boot-\nstrapping procedural maneuver. They have no com-\nplaint about the independent monitor or the class notice,\nthough they appealed those decisions; rather, they want\nus to review the denial of their original class-certifica-\ntion motion. This is an improper attempt to revive\ntheir untimely cross-appeal from the June 9 remedial\norder. We dismiss the plaintiffs’ appeal.\n  Finally, MPS seeks review of the district court’s orders\ncertifying the class, finding liability, and approving\nDPI’s settlement. Ordinarily these interlocutory orders\nwould be unappealable, but MPS argues that the doc-\ntrine of pendent appellate jurisdiction applies. In Swint\nv. Chambers County Commission, 514 U.S. 35, 51 (1995),\nthe Supreme Court ” ‘set out a general rule against exer-\ncising pendent jurisdiction over related rulings.’ ”\nMcKinney v. Duplain, 463 F.3d 679, 692 (7th Cir. 2006)\n(quoting Watkins v. City of Oakland, Cal., 145 F.3d 1087, 1092\n(9th Cir. 1998)). Pendent appellate jurisdiction “may be\ninvoked ‘only if there are compelling reasons for not\ndeferring the appeal of the former order to the end of the\nlawsuit.’ ” Montano v. City of Chicago, 375 F.3d 593, 599\n(7th Cir. 2004) (quoting U.S. for Use of Valders Stone &\nMarble, Inc. v. C-Way Constr. Co., 909 F.2d 259, 262 (7th\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                   19\n\nCir. 1990)). We may “review an otherwise unappealable\ninterlocutory order if it is ‘inextricably intertwined\nwith an appealable one.’ ” Research Automation, Inc. v.\nSchrader-Bridgeport Int’l, Inc., 626 F.3d 973, 977 (7th\nCir. 2010) (quoting Montano, 375 F.3d at 599). In other\nwords, ” ‘it must be practically indispensable that we\naddress the merits of the unappealable order in order to\nresolve the properly-taken appeal.’ ” Montano, 375 F.3d\nat 600 (quoting Valders Stone & Marble, 909 F.2d at 262).\nIf an otherwise unappealable order is sufficiently inter-\ntwined to permit pendent appellate jurisdiction, we\nmay exercise our discretion to review it. Jones v. InfoCure\nCorp., 310 F.3d 529, 536-37 (7th Cir. 2002).\n  The decision to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction\nis inherently case specific. See Montano, 375 F.3d at 600.\nHere, our review of the appealable order—the June 9 order\nimposing the remedial scheme—simply cannot be con-\nducted in isolation from the earlier orders. The June 9\norder imposes a remedy for MPS’s liability to the\nplaintiff class; deferring review of the class-certification\nand liability decisions until after final judgment would\nmake our present review of the remedial scheme mean-\ningless. As this case comes to us, it is “practically indis-\npensable” that we review the class-certification and\nliability orders now “in order to resolve the properly-\ntaken appeal.” Id.; see also Asset Allocation & Mgmt. Co. v.\nW. Emp’rs Ins. Co., 892 F.2d 566, 569 (7th Cir. 1989)\n(“[A]ny ruling on which the validity of the [appealable\norder] turns is reviewable . . . .”).\n  The court’s order approving DPI’s settlement presents\na closer question, but viewing the case as a whole, we\n\f20                                  Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\nthink this order is so closely linked with the others that\nit cannot be separated. Because we vacate the class certifi-\ncation, declining to exercise pendent jurisdiction over\nthe order approving DPI’s settlement would create the\nstrangely anomalous result of a free-standing district\ncourt order approving and incorporating a settlement\nbetween a defendant and a class that no longer exists.\nFurthermore, with essentially the entire case already\nbefore us, deferring appellate review of the settlement\nwould create rather than prevent piecemeal appeals; this\ntoo favors pendent appellate review. See Greenwell v.\nAztar Ind. Gaming Corp., 268 F.3d 486, 491 (7th Cir. 2001).\n\n\nB. Class Certification\n  “The class action is ‘an exception to the usual rule\nthat litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the indi-\nvidual named parties only.’ ” Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.\nDukes, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 2550 (2011) (quoting Califano v.\nYamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 700-01 (1979)). A district court\nmay certify a case for class-action treatment only if it\nsatisfies the four requirements of Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 23(a)—numerosity, commonality, typicality,\nand adequacy of representation—and one of the condi-\ntions of Rule 23(b). See F ED. R. C IV. P. 23. In addition, a\nclass must be sufficiently definite that its members\nare ascertainable. Oshana v. Coca-Cola Co., 472 F.3d 506,\n513 (7th Cir. 2006); see Simer v. Rios, 661 F.2d 655, 669\n(7th Cir. 1981) (“It is axiomatic that for a class action\nto be certified a ‘class’ must exist.”).\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                       21\n\n  Class certification is appropriate only if, “after a\nrigorous analysis,” the trial court is satisfied that the\nrequirements of Rule 23 have been met. Wal-Mart, 131\nS. Ct. at 2551 (quotation marks omitted). “Frequently,\nthat ‘rigorous analysis’ will entail some overlap with the\nmerits of the plaintiff’s underlying claim. That cannot be\nhelped.” Id.; see also Kartman v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.\nCo., 634 F.3d 883, 890 n.6 (7th Cir. 2011) (citing Szabo v.\nBridgeport Machs., Inc., 249 F.3d 672, 676 (7th Cir. 2001)).\nWe review the district court’s class-certification order\nfor abuse of discretion, but legal determinations made\nin support of the decision are reviewed de novo. Andrews\nv. Chevy Chase Bank, 545 F.3d 570, 573 (7th Cir. 2008).\n  There are several basic flaws in the district court’s class-\ncertification decision. First, the class is both fatally indefi-\nnite and lacks the commonality required by Rule 23(a)(2).\nFurthermore, although the case was certified as a class\naction for injunctive and declaratory relief under\nRule 23(b)(2), final injunctive or corresponding de-\nclaratory relief cannot be ordered on a class-wide basis,\nas required for a Rule 23(b)(2) class.\n  We begin with the terms of the class definition, some-\nthing over which the parties and the judge struggled\nmightily. The plaintiffs initially sought to represent a\nclass so broad that it effectively included all students\neligible for special education and related services from\nMPS. The original proposed class thus joined together\nall Milwaukee-area disabled students, regardless of\ndifferences in their disabilities or educational situations,\nwhose procedural or substantive rights under the IDEA\n\f22                                      Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\nwere violated in any way. The district court properly\nrejected this sweeping class definition, but not for the\nobvious reason that it sought to lump together thousands\nof disparate plaintiffs with widely varying individual\nclaims. Rather, the court rejected the plaintiffs’ proposed\nclass definition based on difficulties associated with the\nIDEA’s requirement that administrative remedies be\nexhausted before filing suit.\n  The district court was justifiably concerned about the\nadministrative-exhaustion requirement. But the court’s\neffort to resolve the problem was misguided. The court\nsua sponte divided the class into two categories: those\nwith “pre-determination claims” and those with “post-\ndetermination claims.” These designations were ap-\nparently meant to categorize individual violations of the\nIDEA, separating those that occurred prior to an IEP\nmeeting from those that occurred after an IEP meeting.\nThe judge thought this categorization made it possible\nto excuse the exhaustion requirement for “pre-deter-\nmination claims” and allow these alleged IDEA viola-\ntions to be litigated on a class-wide basis, while\nenforcing the exhaustion requirement for “post-determina-\ntion claims,” excluding them from class-action treatment.\n  There is reason to doubt the propriety of this approach,\nbut for present purposes we will address it on its own\nterms. Ordinarily, a plaintiff may not file an IDEA\nlawsuit without first exhausting available administrative\nremedies. See 20 U.S.C. § 1415; Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305,\n326-27 (1988); Charlie F. v. Bd. of Educ. of Skokie Sch. Dist. 68,\n98 F.3d 989, 991 (7th Cir. 1996). However, exhaustion may\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                       23\n\nbe excused if administrative review would be futile or\ninadequate. Honig, 484 U.S. at 326-27. The district court\napplied this exception to all pre-determination claims,\nreasoning that the parents of disabled students might\nnot be fully aware of the right to administrative\nremedies prior to a properly constructed IEP meeting,\nmaking exhaustion an exercise in futility.2 Once an IEP\nmeeting is convened, however, the court thought that\n\n\n2\n   We question this reasoning. Wisconsin law requires that\nparents be notified of their administrative-review rights when\na child is initially referred for evaluation, well before an IEP\nmeeting occurs. W IS . S TAT . § 115.792(1)(b). For this reason\nthe defendants argued below that if exhaustion was to be\nexcused on a class-wide basis for violations occurring before\nparents received notice of their right to administrative\nremedies, it should be excused for pre-referral claims only.\nThe district court rejected this argument, perceiving “too\ngreat” a “potential of having parties unwittingly forgo their\nrights.” Even when notice of administrative remedies was\nprovided, the judge was “not sanguine with the fact that this\ninformation is always properly delivered or that the parents\nhave a full understanding of the information.” Let’s assume\nfor the sake of argument that it was appropriate to waive the\nexhaustion requirement on a class-wide basis on the rationale\nthat parents “lacked full understanding” of their rights. The\nplaintiffs, as the proponents of the futility exception to\nthe exhaustion requirement, would bear the burden of estab-\nlishing this lack of understanding. See Polera v. Bd. of Educ.\nof Newburgh Enlarged City Sch. Dist., 288 F.3d 478, 488 n.8 (2d\nCir. 2002). That burden is not satisfied by the district court’s\nunsupported intuition that notice might not always be\n“properly delivered” or that parents might not always under-\nstand it.\n\f24                                      Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\nparents would sufficiently understand their rights,\nmaking administrative review adequate and keeping\nthe IDEA’s exhaustion requirement intact for post-determi-\nnation claims. On this rationale the court was willing\nto certify a class defined to include only pre-determina-\ntion claims, for which it excused the plaintiffs’ failure\nto exhaust administrative remedies.3\n\n\n3\n   In settling on the pre-determination/post-determination\nline of demarcation, the district court relied heavily on the\nconcept of “systemic” IDEA violations developed by other\ncircuits, most prominently the Ninth Circuit in Doe ex rel.\nBrockhuis v. Arizona Department of Education, 111 F.3d 678, 681\n(9th Cir. 1997). Doe discussed the distinction between “systemic”\nand “nonsystemic” IDEA claims in the context of deciding\nwhether to apply the futility exception to excuse the plaintiffs’\nfailure to exhaust administrative remedies prior to bringing a\nclass-action suit. Here, however, the district court applied the\nNinth Circuit’s definition of a “systemic” IDEA violation in\ndetermining MPS’s liability, using it as the substantive legal\nstandard for evaluating whether MPS was in noncompliance\nwith the IDEA system-wide. We question whether Doe’s\ndefinition of “systemic” IDEA noncompliance has any value\noutside its specific context—that is, outside the context of\ndeciding as a threshold matter in a proposed IDEA class action\nwhether to excuse the failure to exhaust administrative reme-\ndies. And even in that context, the line drawn in Doe between\nsystemic and nonsystemic violations for purposes of the\nexhaustion requirement seems rather arbitrary. While some\nIDEA violations may implicate the structure of a school\ndistrict’s special-education program and may not be\nremediable through ordinary administrative review, it does\nnot necessarily follow that administrative review is futile or\n                                                    (continued...)\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                       25\n\n    The court thus certified a class of its own creation:\n      Those students eligible for special education services\n      from the Milwaukee Public School System who are,\n      have been or will be either denied or delayed entry\n      or participation in the processes which result in a\n      properly constituted meeting between the IEP team\n      and the parents or guardians of the student.\nIn other words, the certified class combined all disabled\nstudents eligible for special education from MPS who\nwere not identified as potentially eligible for services, not\ntimely referred for evaluation after identification, not\ntimely evaluated after referral, not evaluated in a\nproperly constituted IEP meeting, or whose parents did\nnot (for whatever reason) attend an otherwise proper\nIEP meeting. The court made it clear that students\nwho suffered a pre-determination violation but have\nsince received a proper IEP meeting—for example, stu-\ndents who received a late IEP meeting—are also in-\ncluded in the class.\n  One immediately obvious defect in this class is its\nindefiniteness. A significant segment of the class (of\nunknown and unknowable size) comprises disabled\nstudents who may have been eligible for special education\n\n\n3\n  (...continued)\ninadequate for all violations that are alleged to be “systemic.”\nHowever, because our decision rests on other flaws in the class-\ncertification decision and does not reach the substance of the\ncourt’s liability decision, we neither accept nor reject the\nNinth Circuit’s reasoning in Doe.\n\f26                                      Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\nbut were not identified and remain unidentified. There is\nno question that MPS has a legal obligation under the\nIDEA to seek out disabled students and refer for evalua-\ntion those it reasonably believes are disabled and in\nneed of special education. See 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(3)(A);\nW IS. S TAT. § 115.77(1m)(a). The failure to properly\nidentify a disabled student can itself be a violation of\nthe IDEA if the failure results in the denial of a free ap-\npropriate public education to a qualifying child with a\ndisability. Cf. Forest Grove Sch. Dist. v. T.A., 129 S. Ct. 2484,\n2495 (2009) (“A reading of the Act that left parents\nwithout an adequate remedy when a school district\nunreasonably failed to identify a child with disabilities\nwould not comport with Congress’ acknowledgment of\nthe paramount importance of properly identifying each\nchild eligible for services.”). The problem with a class\nof potentially eligible but unidentified students is not\nthat their rights might not been violated but that the\nrelevant criteria for class membership are unknown.\nBy what standard is class membership to be determined?\nHow is the court to decide whether there was reason\nto believe in 2000-2005 that a presently unidentified child\nwas potentially eligible for special-education services\nfrom MPS? It’s not hard to see how this class lacks the\ndefiniteness required for class certification; there is no\nway to know or readily ascertain who is a member of the\nclass.4 See Oshana, 472 F.3d at 513; Simer, 661 F.2d at 669.\n\n\n4\n  Typical suits for child-find-violations focus on a school\ndistrict’s failure to timely identify a qualifying disability in an\nidentified student, e.g., Richard S. v. Wissahickon Sch. Dist., 334\n                                                     (continued...)\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                         27\n\n  Of course, unidentified but potentially eligible disabled\nstudents are defined not only by having not been\nidentified but also by having a disability. If we could\neasily identify all Milwaukee students with disabilities\nduring the relevant time period, perhaps we could cross-\ncheck that list against a list of known disabled students\nto determine which students MPS failed to identify and\nrefer for an IEP evaluation. But identifying disabled\nstudents who might be eligible for special-education\nservices is a complex, highly individualized task, and\ncannot be reduced to the application of a set of simple,\nobjective criteria. Every step of the child-find inquiry\nand IEP process under the IDEA is child specific and\nrequires the application of trained and particularized\nprofessional educational judgment. In short, a class of\nunidentified but potentially IDEA-eligible disabled stu-\ndents is inherently too indefinite to be certified.\n  This conclusion draws support from Adashunas v.\nNegley, 626 F.2d 600 (7th Cir. 1980). The plaintiffs in\nAdashunas alleged widespread violations of the child-\nfind requirements in the IDEA’s predecessor statute\nand proposed a class consisting of “all children within\n\n\n4\n   (...continued)\nF. App’x 508, 510 (3d Cir. 2009), or a school district’s failure\nto identify a disability despite a parental referral, e.g., Forest\nGrove Sch. Dist. v. T.A., 129 S. Ct. 2484, 2488 (2009). In both\nsituations the identity of the student is known. The class\nhere includes all students not properly identified as\npotentially eligible for special education, the vast majority of\nwhom are not individually known.\n\f28                                 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\nthe State of Indiana entitled to a public education\nwho have learning disabilities who are not properly\nidentified and/or who are not receiving such special\ninstruction as to guarantee them of minimally adequate\neducation.” Id. at 601. We noted the practical difficulty\nin defining the class in this way: “How does one\nidentify class members consisting of persons not identi-\nfied?” Id. at 603. In theory such a class might make sense\nif the process of identifying unknown class members\nwas relatively simple. But because the task of identifying\nlearning-disabled children is a “long, arduous process,”\nand the proposed class of plaintiffs was “so highly\ndiverse and so difficult to identify,” we held that the\nclass was “not adequately defined or nearly ascertain-\nable” and the class action could not be maintained. Id. at\n603-04 (citing DeBremaecker v. Short, 433 F.2d 733, 734\n(5th Cir. 1970)). The same is true here.\n  The plaintiffs insist that because the class is defined\nby reference to MPS’s illegal actions—that is, by MPS’s\nfailure to comply with the IDEA—the defect of indefinite-\nness may be forgiven. For this principle they rely on\nAlliance to End Repression v. Rochford, 565 F.2d 975, 977-\n78 (7th Cir. 1977), in which we upheld the certification\nof two plaintiff classes consisting of organizations and\npersons in Chicago who had been unconstitutionally\nmonitored and harassed by various municipal and\nfederal defendants in retaliation for exercising their\nFirst Amendment rights. The defendants in Rochford\nargued that this class—potentially large in scope and\nwith no ready means of identifying its members—was\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                     29\n\ntoo indefinite to be certified. We concluded that “a\nclass that satisfies all of the other requirements of\nRule 23 will not be rejected as indefinite when its con-\ntours are defined by the defendants’ own conduct.” Id.\nat 978.\n  Rochford’s tolerance of a wildly indefinite class defini-\ntion under Rule 23 is no longer the norm. We have\nnoted that “[Rochford] is a relic of a time when the\nfederal judiciary thought that structural injunctions\ntaking control of executive functions were sensible. That\ntime is past.” Rahman v. Chertoff, 530 F.3d 622, 626 (7th\nCir. 2008). Moreover, the class certified in Rochford is\ndifferent from the one here in at least two critical respects.\nFirst, for reasons we will explain in a moment, class\ncertification in this case does not comply with other\nrequirements of Rule 23; more specifically, the class does\nnot satisfy Rule 23(a)(2)’s commonality requirement,\nand it does not satisfy Rule 23(b)(2). Second, the defen-\ndants’ actions in Rochford provided at least some means\nof identifying class members: Each class member was\nthe victim of some discrete act of harassment that once\nrevealed—for example, through discovery—would in\nturn reveal the identity of the victimized class member.\nNot so with the present class. MPS’s alleged failure to\nidentify disabled students in no way pins down the\nidentities of the class members; the relevant conduct\nhere is not a discrete action as in Rochford but rather a\nfailure to act. The liability and remedial orders are power-\nful evidence of this difference; the elaborate scheme\nfor identifying class members via a hybrid IEP process\n\f30                                    Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\ndramatically illustrates the fatal indefiniteness of this\nclass. Rochford is no help to the plaintiffs here.5\n  Beyond its inherent indefiniteness, the class certified\nhere fails to satisfy Rule 23(a)(2)’s commonality prereq-\nuisite, which requires that the class claims involve\n“questions of law or fact common to the class.” FED. R. C IV.\nP. 23(a)(2). It’s true that ” ‘[e]ven a single [common] ques-\ntion’ will do.” Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2556 (quoting\nRichard A. Nagareda, The Preexistence Principle and the\nStructure of the Class Action, 103 C OLUM . L. R EV . 149, 176,\nn.110 (2003)) (alteration in original). But the Supreme\nCourt explained in Wal-Mart that superficial common\nquestions—like whether each class member is an MPS\nstudent or whether each class member “suffered a viola-\ntion of the same provision of law”—are not enough. Id. at\n2551. Rather, “[c]ommonality requires the plaintiffs to\ndemonstrate that the class members ‘have suffered the\nsame injury.’ ” Id. (quoting Gen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon,\n457 U.S. 147, 157 (1982)). The class “claims must depend\nupon a common contention,” and “[t]hat common con-\ntention, moreover, must be of such a nature that it\nis capable of classwide resolution—which means that\ndetermination of its truth or falsity will resolve an\nissue that is central to the validity of each one of the\nclaims in one stroke.” Id.\n\n\n\n5\n  Our conclusion that a class of child-find claims does not fit\nwithin Rochford’s carve-out is reinforced by the fact that we\ndecided Adashunas less than three years after Rochford but\ndid not even cite it.\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                    31\n\n   The plaintiffs identify the following common issue:\n“[A]ll potential class members have suffered as a result\nof MPS’ failure to ensure their Child Find rights under\nIDEA and Wisconsin law.” This completely misunder-\nstands Rule 23(a)(2). Whether MPS failed in its obliga-\ntions under the IDEA and thereby deprived an eligible\ndisabled child of a free appropriate public education is\nthe bottom-line liability question in any individual plain-\ntiff’s IDEA claim. To bring individual IDEA claims\ntogether to litigate as a class, the plaintiffs must show\nthat they share some question of law or fact that can be\nanswered all at once and that the single answer to\nthat question will resolve a central issue in all class mem-\nbers’ claims. That all the class members have “suffered”\nas a result of disparate individual IDEA child-find viola-\ntions is not enough; it does not establish that the\nindividual claims have any question of law or fact in com-\nmon. The plaintiffs have identified no common factual\nor legal question that satisfies the Rule 23(a)(2) standard,\nand it is their burden to do so. See Oshana, 472 F.3d at 513.\n  To illustrate the commonality problem in the certified\nclass, consider two hypothetical students within the\nclass: one has a disability and would be eligible for\nspecial education but has never been identified as being\ndisabled nor gone through the IEP process; another\nwas identified as disabled and received a timely IEP\nmeeting, but the child’s parents did not attend the IEP\nmeeting and were not notified of their right to do so. Both\nscenarios involve violations of the IDEA, but what\ncommon question can be answered that would assist\nthe court in determining MPS’s liability for each? On the\n\f32                                   Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\nplaintiffs’ theory, that question is something like this:\nDid MPS fulfill its IDEA obligations to each child? But\nwhile that generic question is surely a part of both chil-\ndren’s claims, it must be answered separately for each\nchild based on individualized questions of fact and law,\nand the answers are unique to each child’s particular\nsituation.\n  This was the basic commonality problem in Wal-Mart,\nwhich involved a nationwide class-action suit on\nbehalf of female employees of the discount retailer\nfor alleged sex discrimination in violation of Title VII.\nThe Supreme Court summarized the lack of com-\nmonality in this way:\n     In this case, proof of commonality necessarily\n     overlaps with respondents’ merits contention that Wal-\n     Mart engages in a pattern or practice of discrimina-\n     tion. That is so because, in resolving an individual’s\n     Title VII claim, the crux of the inquiry is the reason\n     for a particular employment decision . . . . Here respon-\n     dents wish to sue about literally millions of employ-\n     ment decisions at once. Without some glue holding\n     the alleged reasons for all those decisions together,\n     it will be impossible to say that examination of all\n     the class members’ claims for relief will produce a\n     common answer to the crucial question why was\n     I disfavored.\nWal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2552 (internal quotation marks and\ncitations omitted). Here, too, resolving any individual\nclass member’s claim for relief under the IDEA requires\nan inherently particularized inquiry into the cir-\ncumstances of the child’s case.\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                      33\n\n  That the court narrowed its focus to child-find viola-\ntions (what the court called “pre-determination claims”)\nis not enough. Child-find inquiries, like other aspects of\nthe IDEA, are necessarily child specific. There is no such\nthing as a “systemic” failure to find and refer individual\ndisabled children for IEP evaluation—except perhaps if\nthere was “significant proof” that MPS operated under\nchild-find policies that violated the IDEA. See id. at 2553.\nAs the Supreme Court noted in Wal-Mart, an illegal\npolicy might provide the “glue” necessary to litigate\notherwise highly individualized claims as a class. Id. at\n2552-54. But again, as in Wal-Mart, proof of an illegal\npolicy “is entirely absent here.” Id. at 2553; see also J.B. ex\nrel. Hart v. Valdez, 186 F.3d 1280, 1289 (10th Cir. 1999)\n(affirming the denial of class certification because the\n“plaintiffs merely attempt to broadly conflate a variety\nof claims [under the IDEA and other statutes] to\nestablish commonality via an allegation of ‘systematic\nfailures’ ”). Lacking any common questions, the class\nfails to satisfy Rule 23(a)(2) and should not have been\ncertified.\n  Finally, it should be clear from our discussion thus\nfar that the district court also erred when it certified\nan injunction class under Rule 23(b)(2). Rule 23(b)(2)\npermits the court to certify a case for class-action treat-\nment if “the party opposing the class has acted or refused\nto act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so\nthat final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory\nrelief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.” FED.\nR. C IV. P. 23(b)(2). The final clause is important: The\n\f34                                  Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\ninjunctive or declaratory relief sought must be “final” to\n“the class as a whole.” See Kartman, 634 F.3d at 892-94. In\nother words, “claims for individualized relief . . . do not\nsatisfy [Rule 23(b)(2)].” Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2557. To\nthe contrary, “Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a single\ninjunction or declaratory judgment would provide\nrelief to each member of the class. It does not authorize\nclass certification when each individual class member\nwould be entitled to a different injunction or declaratory\njudgment against the defendant.” Id.\n   That the plaintiffs have superficially structured\ntheir case around a claim for class-wide injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief does not satisfy Rule 23(b)(2) if as a\nsubstantive matter the relief sought would merely\ninitiate a process through which highly individualized\ndeterminations of liability and remedy are made; this\nkind of relief would be class-wide in name only, and\nit would certainly not be final. See id. (“The key to the\n(b)(2) class is ‘the indivisible nature of the injunctive\nor declaratory remedy warranted . . . .’ ” (quoting\nRichard A. Nagareda, Class Certification in the Age of\nAggregate Proof, 84 N.Y.U. L. R EV. 97, 132 (2009))); see\nalso id. at 2558 (“[T]he relief sought [under Rule 23(b)(2)]\nmust perforce affect the entire class at once . . . .”);\nKartman, 634 F.3d at 892-94; Andrews, 545 F.3d at 577. If\nindividualized relief is sought—even individual injunc-\ntive relief—the named plaintiffs must look elsewhere\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                      35\n\nin Rule 23(b) to obtain certification.6 See Wal-Mart, 131\nS. Ct. at 2558-59; Kartman, 634 F.3d at 895.\n   The relief sought here does not come close to satisfying\nRule 23(b)(2)’s standard. That much is clear from the\nintricate remedial scheme ordered by the district court,\nwhich requires thousands of individual determinations\nof class membership, liability, and appropriate remedies.\nWhile the compensatory-education remedies will often\nor always be injunctive in nature, there can be no\nsingle injunction that provides final relief to the class\nas a whole. It is no answer to say that the June 9 remedial\norder affects the entire class; that order merely estab-\nlishes a system for eventually providing individualized\nrelief. It does not, on its own, provide “final” relief to\nany class member. See Andrews, 545 F.3d at 577. More-\nover, the remedial order requires class notice as a neces-\nsary element of its operation: Only those class members\nwho respond are to be evaluated within the hybrid\nIEP system; nonresponders are unaffected. That the\nputative class members must opt in after notice and then\nbe evaluated for membership in the class—before making\na claim for entitlement to compensatory education—\nbelies the notion that the court can provide final injunc-\ntive relief to the class as a whole. This is not the stuff of\na proper Rule 23(b)(2) class.\n\n\n\n6\n  Our discussion of commonality makes it clear that the present\nclass does not satisfy Rule 23(b)(3). Without even a single\ncommon question of law or fact, common questions cannot\npredominate. See F ED . R. C IV . P. 23(b)(3).\n\f36                                     Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\n  So the class-certification order must be vacated. It\nfollows that without a class to whom MPS can be liable\nand provide a remedy, the liability and remedial orders\nmust be vacated as well. What remains are the claims of\nthe individual plaintiffs; the district court did not find\na denial of a free appropriate public education in any\nindividual case.7 Furthermore, the court’s reasons for\nexcusing administrative exhaustion appear to have\nbeen tied to the class allegations, and it’s not clear\nwhether the court would have excused exhaustion for\nany of the individual claims. Finally, it’s possible—perhaps\nlikely—that some of the named plaintiffs’ individual\nfactual circumstances have changed such that their\nclaims are now moot. We leave to the district court on\nremand the task of determining whether anything\nremains of this case and what, if anything, should\nhappen next.\n\n\nC. DPI Settlement\n  Finally, we turn to DPI’s settlement with the plaintiff\nclass. A district court may approve a class settlement if\nit is “fair, reasonable, and adequate.” FED. R. C IV. P.\n23(e)(2). We review an order approving a class settlement\n\n\n7\n  As stated in the remedial order: “[A]t no point did the court\nreceive specific evidence from educational professionals\nwho engaged in an individualized assessment of the named\nplaintiffs, determined the nature of any denial of [a free appro-\npriate public education], and determined precisely what sorts\nof services were necessary . . . .”\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                       37\n\nfor an abuse of discretion. Mirfasihi v. Fleet Mortg. Corp., 450\nF.3d 745, 748 (7th Cir. 2006). As with any order\nreviewed under this standard, if the district court’s analy-\nsis turned on an error of law, the court necessarily\nabused its discretion. Wis. Right to Life State PAC\nv. Barland, 644 F.3d 139, 150 (7th Cir. 2011).\n  After the district court found MPS and DPI liable for\nIDEA violations, DPI commenced settlement negotia-\ntions with class counsel and eventually submitted a\nsettlement agreement for court approval. DPI agreed to\nappoint an independent monitor to oversee MPS’s IDEA\ncompliance and develop a compliance plan for MPS—\nwith input from class counsel and the independent\nmonitor—establishing specific requirements that DPI\nwould in turn impose on MPS. The plan’s implementa-\ntion would be tied to several benchmarks DPI promised\nto enforce against MPS. Among other things, DPI agreed\nthat MPS would evaluate 95% of referred students\nwithin the statutory time frame; that MPS would make\nreasonable attempts to include a parent in 95% of IEP\nmeetings; and that MPS would refer 95% of students\nwith a specified number of suspensions and 95% of\nstudents retained in grade to an early intervention\nsystem for the possibility of disability evaluations. The\nsettlement also gave the independent monitor sig-\nnificant oversight authority over MPS, including the\nability to order MPS to make administrative changes to\ncomply with the settlement agreement. In exchange\nfor these and other promises, the settlement released\nDPI from all claims in this suit and also purported to\n\f38                                    Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\npreclude all class members from bringing any representa-\ntive suit against DPI for IDEA violations that occurred\nprior to the settlement date.\n  It should be apparent from the foregoing description\nthat this settlement agreement is highly unusual. DPI’s\nprimary concessions require performance from MPS,\nwhich is not a party to the agreement and did not con-\nsent. Sensing the problem, the district court allowed MPS\nto file an objection to the settlement. MPS argued that the\nsettlement agreement impermissibly affected its legal\nrights and conflicted with state statutes governing DPI’s\noversight authority. The district court framed the\nquestion this way: Does “DPI ha[ve] the authority to\norder MPS to take the actions called for in the pro-\nposed settlement agreement[?]” If DPI has the legal\nauthority to command MPS to take the specified actions,\nthen the state agency’s agreement to impose mandates\non MPS would pose no problem. But if DPI does not\nhave that legal authority—stated differently, if MPS has\na legal right to resist such a demand from DPI—then a\nsettlement agreement binding DPI to impose mandates\non MPS, a nonparty, infringes MPS’s legal rights.\n  “The general rule . . . is that a non-settling party does not\nhave standing to object to a settlement between other\nparties.” Agretti v. ANR Freight Sys., Inc., 982 F.2d 242,\n246 (7th Cir. 1992). There is an exception when the\nnonsettling party “can show plain legal prejudice\nresulting from the settlement.” See id. at 246-47 (citing\nQuad/Graphics, Inc. v. Fass, 724 F.2d 1230, 1233 (7th Cir.\n1983), and other cases). That a settling defendant creates\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                  39\n\na tactical disadvantage for another defendant is not\nsufficient to support standing to object; the prejudice to\nthe nonsettling defendant must be legal, such as (for\nexample) interference with contractual or contribution\nrights or the stripping away of a cross-claim. Id. at 247.\nHere, as the district court correctly acknowledged,\nMPS’s substantive objection to the settlement and its\nbasis for standing are one and the same: If the settlement\nagreement prejudiced MPS’s legal rights, MPS may\nobject, and its objection has merit.\n  The district court ultimately held that MPS did not\nhave standing to object because DPI has authority to\nimplement the agreement. As the state agency with\nauthority to dispense federal special-education\nfunding, DPI is responsible for ensuring local compliance\nwith the IDEA’s requirements. See 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(11).\nSection 115.90 of the Wisconsin Statutes outlines the\nthree enforcement mechanisms available to DPI should\na local school district fail to comply:\n   (1) If, as the result of a monitoring procedure or a\n   complaint investigation, the state superintendent finds\n   that a local educational agency has violated this\n   subchapter, the state superintendent may require the\n   local educational agency to submit a corrective plan ad-\n   dressing the violation.\n   (2) If the state superintendent, after reasonable notice\n   and an opportunity for a hearing, finds that a local\n   educational agency has failed to comply with any\n   requirement in this subchapter, the state superinten-\n   dent shall reduce or eliminate special education aid to\n\f40                                   Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\n     the local educational agency until he or she is satisfied\n     that the local educational agency is complying with\n     that requirement.\n     (3) If the state superintendent finds that a corrective\n     plan under sub. (1) has not been implemented, or\n     that withholding aid under sub. (2) has been inade-\n     quate to ensure compliance with this subchapter, the\n     state superintendent shall request the attorney general\n     to proceed against the local educational agency for in-\n     junctive or other appropriate relief.\n(Emphasis added.)\n  The district court focused on DPI’s statutory authority\nunder subsection (2) to withhold MPS’s funding for\nfailure to comply with the IDEA’s requirements. Because\nMPS retained the right to appeal any suspension of funds\nto the Department of Education, see 34 C.F.R. § 76.401,\nthe district court concluded that the settlement did not\nviolate MPS’s rights but rather “could be viewed as\nessentially another corrective action, similar to any one\nof the numerous other corrective action plans previously\nestablished by DPI.”\n  This analysis overlooks key parts of Wisconsin’s en-\nforcement scheme. It’s true that DPI has the authority\nto reduce MPS’s federal funding or eliminate it alto-\ngether. But the settlement agreement does not im-\nplicate DPI’s authority over the disbursement of\nfederal funds; rather, DPI bound itself to impose a cor-\nrective plan on MPS. DPI does not, however, have the\nunilateral authority to impose a corrective plan on a\nnoncompliant local school district. To the contrary,\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                     41\n\nDPI may only require that a local school district develop\nand submit a plan to address areas of IDEA noncompli-\nance; the details of the plan are left to the local school\ndistrict. See W IS. S TAT. § 115.90(1). DPI can force a local\nschool district to take specific remedial action only if\nthe district fails to implement its own corrective plan.\nAlternatively, DPI can withhold or reduce federal funds,\nand if this more dramatic action does not induce compli-\nance, the state superintendent of public instruction can\nask the state attorney general to sue to bring the\nschool district into compliance. See id. § 115.90(3).\n  The local school district’s autonomous authority to\ndevelop its own corrective plan is no small distinction\nin the context of this case. Because DPI cannot\nunilaterally force MPS to take specific remedial action, a\nsettlement that attempts to do exactly that prejudices\nMPS’s legal rights by requiring more of MPS than Wis-\nconsin law permits DPI to impose. The district court’s\nconclusion to the contrary was an error of law, and\nbecause the decision to approve DPI’s settlement turned\nin large part on this legal error, that decision was an\nabuse of discretion.8\n\n\n8\n  The parties note a change in Wisconsin law during the\npendency of these appeals. Under 2009 Wisconsin Act 215\n(published May 13, 2010), the state superintendent of public\ninstruction is empowered to order certain low-performing\nschool districts to take certain remedial actions. However,\nAct 215 does not amend section 115.90, or any other provision\nin the Wisconsin Statutes, Chapter 115, Subchapter V, the\n                                                (continued...)\n\f42                                    Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\n  Apart from this misunderstanding about DPI’s\nstatutory oversight authority, the district court’s approval\nof DPI’s settlement must be vacated for a much simpler\nreason: There can be no class settlement if the class should\nnot have been certified in the first place. See Ortiz v.\nFibreboard Corp., 527 U.S. 815, 858 (1999) (“[T]he determina-\ntion whether ‘proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive\nto warrant adjudication’ must focus on ‘questions that\npreexist any settlement.’ ” (quoting Amchem Prods., Inc. v.\nWindsor, 521 U.S. 591, 622-23 (1997))). Although class\ncertification and settlement approval were sought sepa-\nrately here, the caselaw on so-called “settlement only”\nclasses is instructive.9 The Supreme Court has made\nclear that a settlement-only class must satisfy the bulk\nof Rule 23’s requirements in order to be certified. See id.\nat 864; Amchem, 521 U.S. at 620. And when a district\ncourt abuses its discretion in certifying a settlement-only\nclass, we unwind not only the class certification but\nalso the class settlement. See, e.g., Crawford v. Equifax\nPayment Servs., Inc., 201 F.3d 877, 881-82 (7th Cir. 2000)\n(vacating order approving class settlement because\nclass did not satisfy Rule 23(b)). Basic principles of due\nprocess prevent individual named plaintiffs from\nbinding—through litigation or court-approved settle-\n\n\n8\n  (...continued)\nstatutory scheme relevant to special education. Accordingly,\nAct 215 does not appear to affect the state regulatory apparatus\npertaining to the IDEA.\n9\n   Settlement-only classes are those for which class certifica-\ntion and settlement approval are sought simultaneously.\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                              43\n\nment—absent class members the plaintiffs do not legally\nrepresent.10\n  As we have explained, the class here is fatally indefinite,\nlacks the commonality required by Rule 23(a)(2), and was\nimproperly certified under Rule 23(b)(2). Because the\nnamed plaintiffs do not legally represent the absent class\nmembers, they cannot settle the absent class members’\nclaims. The district court’s order approving DPI’s settle-\nment must be vacated.\n\n\n\n\n10\n     As summarized by the Court in Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp .:\n       [Class actions] implicate the due process “principle of\n       general application in Anglo-American jurisprudence\n       that one is not bound by a judgment in personam in a\n       litigation in which he is not designated as a party or to\n       which he has not been made a party by service of process,”\n       Hansberry v. Lee, [311 U.S. 32, 40 (1940)], it being “our ‘deep-\n       rooted historic tradition that everyone should have his own\n       day in court,’ ” Martin v. Wilkes, [490 U.S. 755, 762 (1989)]\n       (quoting 18 C. Wright, A. Miller & E. Cooper, Federal\n       Practice and Procedure § 4449, p. 417 (1981)); see Richards\n       v. Jefferson County, [517 U.S. 793, 798-99 (1996)]. Although\n       “ ‘[w]e have recognized an exception to the general rule\n       when, in certain limited circumstances, a person, although\n       not a party, has his interests adequately represented by\n       someone with the same interests who is a party,’ ” . . .\n       Martin, [490 U.S. at 762 n.2], the burden of justification rests\n       on the exception.\n527 U.S. 815, 846 (1999).\n\f44                                 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\n                     III. Conclusion\n   For the foregoing reasons, we D ISMISS the plaintiffs’\nappeal (number 09-3274) for lack of appellate jurisdiction.\nWe D ENY the motion to dismiss MPS’s appeal (number 09-\n2741). We V ACATE the district court’s class-certification\norder, its liability order following Phase II of the trial,\nits order approving DPI’s settlement, and its remedial\norder following Phase III of the trial. We R EMAND\nthe case for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\n  R OVNER, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting\nin part. I share many of my colleagues’ concerns about\nthe way in which the class was defined in this case, and\nI further agree that because DPI lacked the authority\nto unilaterally impose a corrective plan on a local\nschool district, it was error to approve DPI’s settlement\nwith the plaintiffs. However, I am not convinced that\nno class was feasible in this case, nor do I believe\nthat the inability to identify class members until the\nremedial phase of the litigation precludes certification\nof the class. For these reasons, I write separately.\n  On its face, the class certified in this case bears the\nhallmarks of the sort of open-ended classes of which we\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                    45\n\ndisapproved in Adashunas v. Negley, 626 F.2d 600, 603-04\n(7th Cir. 1980), and Rahman v. Chertoff, 530 F.3d 622, 625-26\n(7th Cir. 2008). Although the class that the district court\napproved (all school age children with disabilities who\nreside within the MPS district, who are or may be\neligible for special education services, and who are,\nhave been, or will be denied or delayed entry into or\nparticipation in the IEP process) is considerably more\nnarrow than the class originally proposed by the\nplaintiffs (all school age children with disabilities who\nreside within the MPS district and who are or may be\neligible for special education services), it was never\nformally delimited by the particular types of violations\nthat the plaintiffs were alleging. The consequence of\nsuch an open-ended description of the class, as we noted\nin Rahman, is that “every time plaintiffs file a brief or\nmotion, membership in the class[ ] may change.” Id. at 625.\nThus, at any given point during the litigation, it may not\nbe possible to know from the class definition itself what\nthe true parameters of the class are and what types of\nindividuals might be in the class. Id. at 625-26. In this\ncase, the class has been defined to include all students\neligible for special services who have been denied or\ndelayed entry into the IEP system. That definition\nliterally may include students who were delayed or\ndenied entry due to circumstances having little or\nnothing to do with the defendants’ actions, by essentially\nrandom circumstances that are unique to one student\nor limited to a small number of students, or by circum-\nstances that the class representatives have not identified\nas a basis for relief to the class.\n\f46                                   Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\n   I am mindful that the parties and the court, from the\ntime that the class was certified forward, appear to\nhave developed an understanding that the class would\ninclude the four sets of individuals that the court later\nexpressly identified in its liability decision: (1) students\nwith suspected disabilities who were never referred for\nan evaluation; (2) students who were referred for evalua-\ntion, but whose evaluations were not completed within\nthe requisite 90-day limit; (3) students who were sus-\npended in such a way as to frustrate their evaluation;\nand (4) students whose IEP meetings took place in the\nabsence of their parents. See ante at 9; R. 195 at 3-6; R. 389\nat 61. Moreover, the court’s liability decision was limited\nto the time period commencing in September 2000 and\nending in June 2005. R. 389 at 3. In these respects, the\nlitigation ultimately focused on a class of students that\nwas much more limited than the certified class was on\nits face, and one that in the end was much more definite\nthan the sweeping class we criticized in Adashunas,\nfor example.\n  But even as confined to these four groups of students\nand this roughly five-year period, the class includes\nunknown numbers of variations. To cite one example:\nWhen, in her 2004 report, Dr. Rogers-Adkinson addressed\nMPS’s failure to meet statutory deadlines during the\nassessment process, she identified at least four differ-\nent patterns of delays: (1) delays occasioned by the initial\nmis-categorization of a student’s suspected disability;\n(2) delays caused by extensions of time routinely\nrequested for disability assessments solicited during the\nspring semester; (3) delays triggered by the need for\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                       47\n\nadditional medical records; and (4) delays for reasons not\nrevealed in the files she reviewed. Plaintiffs’ Ex. 8 at 6, 8-9.\nEach of these four scenarios might be a manifesta-\ntion of MPS’s failure to timely identify students with\ndisabilities and to convene IEP meetings to address those\ndisabilities, but it is difficult to discern a common, wrong-\nful policy or practice that might account for them all.\nInstead, this looks more like an effort to sweep many\nindividual plaintiffs and sets of facts into one class on\nthe premise that all reflect illegal conduct by the\ndefendant in practice and culture if not in policy. As the\nmajority points out, ante at 32, that is precisely the sort\nof class that the Supreme Court recently rejected in Wal-\nMart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 131 S. Ct. 2541 (2011). Like\nmy colleagues, I am not convinced that the certified class\nin this case is united by common legal or factual issues.\n   Nonetheless, I do not rule out the possibility that a\nclass properly could be certified in this case or one like\nit, and it is to this limited extent that I dissent. My col-\nleagues have concerns both with the notion that a class\naction may be premised on “systemic” violations of a\nschool district’s child-find obligations and with a class\ncomposed of individuals whose identity cannot be\nknown until the remedial phase of the litigation. How-\never, I believe that notwithstanding the inherently child\nspecific nature of child-find inquiries, a class action\nbased on a truly systemic child-find failure may be\nviable. And the fact that it may not be possible to\nidentify individual class members until the remedial\nphase of the litigation, when prospective members of the\nclass are invited to come forward and establish that\n\f48                                    Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\nthey were among those injured by this systemic failure,\nshould not preclude a class action, which may be the\nonly realistic avenue of relief for those injured by\nsystemic violations of their rights.\n   Systemic violations of the IDEA are cognizable. See\nDoe ex rel. Brockhuis v. Ariz. Dep’t of Educ., 111 F.3d 678, 681\n(9th Cir. 1997) (coll. cases). The problem here is that\nthe plaintiffs’ claims appear to be based on multiple,\ndisparate failures to comply with the school district’s\nstatutory child-find obligations rather than a truly\nsystemic policy or practice which affects them all. But\nmy colleagues go so far as to state that “[t]here is\nno such thing as a ‘systemic’ failure to find and refer\nindividual disabled children for IEP evaluation—except\nperhaps if there was ‘significant proof’ that MPS\noperated under child-find policies that violated the\nIDEA.” Ante at 33 (emphasis in original) (citing Wal-Mart,\n130 S. Ct. at 2553). Certainly I agree that an illegal policy\nwould support a claim for a systemic violation of the\nIDEA’s child-find mandate. But I also think that wide-\nspread practices might also support such a claim. Cf.\nKing ex rel. King v. E. St. Louis School Dist. 189, 496 F.3d\n812, 817 (7th Cir. 2007) (citing Calhoun v. Ramsey, 408\nF.3d 375, 379 (7th Cir. 2005)) (noting that municipal\nliability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 may be based on customs\nand practices as well as formal, written policies). Suppose,\nfor example, that MPS ignored and did not refer for\nevaluation students with a particular type of potential\ndisability—e.g., dyslexia—and as a result, large numbers\nof students with that disability went unidentified and\nwere deprived of the educational services to which they\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                   49\n\nwere entitled under the IDEA. To my mind, this would\nbe a genuinely systemic violation of the district’s child-\nfind obligations that would be amenable to recognition\nand remediation in a class action: Notwithstanding the\nfact that each student is unique and is entitled to his\nown, individualized IEP, all members of the class\nwould suffer a common injury resulting from the school\ndistrict’s failure to have appropriate systems in place to\nidentify students with that particular disability. Insisting\ninstead that each student exhaust his administrative\nremedies and/or sue independently would surely mean\nthat many such students would reamin unidentified\nand denied their right to free appropriate public educa-\ntion (if only because they would be unaware of their\nrights) and likely would mean that the systemic viola-\ntion underlying their claims to relief would persist, as\nany individual proceedings would result in individual\nrather than structural relief.\n  A key reason why my colleagues are reluctant to ac-\nknowledge the possibility of a systemic violation of a\nschool district’s child-find obligations is the inability to\nidentify individual class members except by asking\nthe parents of putative class members to come forward\nat the remedial phase of the litigation and to establish, in\nindividual hearings, that their children were in fact\nthe victims of the district’s child-find failures. But this\nmethod of identifying class members is hardly unprece-\ndented. Our decision in McDonald v. United Air Lines, Inc.,\n745 F.2d 1081 (7th Cir. 1984), reflects a similar approach.\nThe class in McDonald comprised women who had lost\ntheir jobs as a result of United Air Line’s rule (dating\nback to the 1930s) prohibiting marriage for its female\n\f50                                  Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\ncabin attendants. Once this court declared the no-marriage\nrule to be a violation of Title VII’s ban on sex discrim-\nination in Sprogis v. United Air Lines, Inc., 444 F.2d 1194\n(7th Cir. 1971), any woman who had lost her position as\na result of that rule between the date Title VII took effect\nin 1965 and United’s abolition of the rule in 1968\nbecame entitled to relief. See McDonald v. United Air Lines,\nInc., 587 F.2d 357 (7th Cir. 1978). But many if not most\nof the class members had simply resigned their positions\nin contemplation of the no-marriage rule rather than\nformally protesting the rule or waiting for the company\nto discharge them, so there was no record enabling\neasy identification of those women who left because\nof the no-marriage rule as opposed to another reason.\nConsequently, the onus was on former flight attendants\nto come forward at the final stage of the litigation and\nclaim entitlement to relief, at which point individual,\nadversarial hearings were convened before special\nmasters in order to establish whether each claimant\nin fact left her position because of the illegal rule. See\nMcDonald, 745 F.2d at 1087-88.\n  As in McDonald, there will be times when the nature\nof the challenged conduct makes it difficult if not impos-\nsible to identity who is in the class and is entitled to\nrelief absent some sort of opt-in procedure by putative\nclass members coupled with an adjudicatory procedure\nto confirm that they in fact qualify as class members. In\nMcDonald this was true because so many class members\nsilently resigned their jobs in deference to their em-\nployer’s illegal rule; in a child-find case like this one\nit would be true because the school district neglected\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                    51\n\nits obligation under the IDEA to identify students with\npotential disabilities. This is not a function of a poor or\nopen-ended class definition as in Rahman, but rather\ndue to the fact that the defendant’s conduct did not\nproduce a tidy record of the individuals harmed by\nthat conduct. Identifying class members in such circum-\nstances necessarily will require a relatively cumbersome,\nafter-the-fact inquiry of the sort employed in McDonald\nand as the district court envisioned here. The only alter-\nnative is to foreclose class-wide relief in such cases\nand leave each individual harmed by the defendant’s\nconduct to pursue relief on his or her own, if he or she\nis even aware that a wrong has been committed. Realisti-\ncally, that will mean no relief at all for most individuals.\n  For all of these reasons, I concur in the court’s conclu-\nsion that the class certified in this case was improper, but\nI do not join its conclusion that no class would be\nviable in this case or other litigation alleging violation\nof a school district’s child-find obligations absent an\nability to identify an express policy that violates the IDEA.\n\n\n\n\n                            2-3-12\n\f",

We are asked in these consolidated\nappeals to review multiple procedural and substantive\norders in a long-running class-action lawsuit seeking\n\f2                                   Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\nstructural reform of special education in the Milwaukee\npublic school district. Under the Individuals with Dis-\nabilities Education Act (the “IDEA” or “the Act”), 20 U.S.C.\n§§ 1400 et seq., the States receive federal funding for\nthe education of disabled children on the condition that\ntheir local school districts comply with the procedural\nrequirements of the Act and provide a “free appropriate\npublic education” to all resident children with disabilities.\nId. § 1412(a)(1)(A). As relevant here, local districts must\nidentify children with disabilities, determine whether\nthese children require special-education services, and\ndevelop individualized education programs (“IEPs”)\ntailored to each student’s specific needs. Each step in the\nprocess is highly individualized because every child is\nunique.\n  In 2001 seven students with disabilities sued the Mil-\nwaukee Public Schools (“MPS”) and the Wisconsin De-\npartment of Public Instruction (“DPI”) on behalf of them-\nselves and a class of “all school age children with dis-\nabilities who reside in the Milwaukee Public School\nDistrict boundaries and who are or may be eligible for\nspecial education and related services under IDEA and\nWisconsin law.” The complaint alleged widespread\nviolations of the IDEA touching on nearly every aspect\nof MPS’s implementation of the Act. The district court\nrejected the plaintiffs’ ambitious proposed class but\ncertified a somewhat more modest one: students eligible\nto receive special education from MPS “who are, have\nbeen or will be” denied or delayed entry into or partic-\nipation in the IEP process. This narrower class definition\nhad the effect of focusing the case on alleged violations\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                     3\n\nof the so-called “child find” requirements of the IDEA.\nId. § 1412(a)(3)(A).\n  The district court held a bench trial and found MPS\nand DPI liable for various “systemic” IDEA violations.\nDPI then settled with the class by agreeing to order MPS\nto meet certain compliance benchmarks; the district court\napproved the settlement over MPS’s objection. On June 9,\n2009, the court ordered a complex remedial scheme\nrequiring MPS to set up a court-monitored system to\nidentify disabled children who were delayed or denied\nentry into the IEP process, implement “hybrid” IEP\nmeetings, and craft compensatory-education remedies.\n   MPS appealed the remedial order and also challenged\nthe district court’s class-certification decision, the\nliability order, and the approval of the DPI settlement.\nThe plaintiffs sought review of the order rejecting their\nsweeping class definition but missed the filing deadline\nfor a cross-appeal. On August 19 the district court issued\ntwo follow-up orders appointing an independent\nmonitor and approving the class notice. The plaintiffs\nappealed from these orders but do not contest either\ndecision; instead, they ask us to review the order denying\ntheir original class-certification motion.\n   Both sides moved to dismiss on jurisdictional grounds.\nWe took the motions with the merits and now dismiss\nthe plaintiffs’ appeal. The orders from which the plain-\ntiffs appealed are not final orders; nor are they the equiva-\nlent of injunctions, so they do not qualify for immediate\nappeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). Moreover, the plain-\ntiffs are attempting a flagrantly improper procedural\n\f4                                   Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\nmaneuver; they may not revive their untimely appeal\nby appealing from orders they do not want reviewed.\nWe deny the motion to dismiss MPS’s appeal. The June 9\nremedial order is the functional equivalent of an injunc-\ntion and may be immediately appealed under § 1292(a)(1);\nwe have pendent appellate jurisdiction over the\nrelated orders.\n  On the merits we vacate the class-certification order.\nLike the Title VII claims in Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.

The class itself\nis fatally indefinite, the claims lack the commonality\nrequired by Rule 23(a)(2), and it’s not possible to order\nfinal injunctive or corresponding declaratory relief on a\nclass-wide basis, as required by Rule 23(b)(2). Because\nthe class should not have been certified, the liability\nand remedial orders must be vacated as well. Finally,\nDPI’s settlement with the class prejudiced MPS’s legal\nrights by requiring more of MPS than DPI had the statu-\ntory authority to demand. In any case, because the\nclass was certified in error, the order approving the\nDPI settlement must also be vacated.\n\n\n                      I. Background\nA. Legal Framework\n  The IDEA requires participating States to provide to\nall disabled students a “free appropriate public education.”\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                      5\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(1)(A). Complying with this require-\nment is a complex and inherently child-specific under-\ntaking. First, the IDEA requires that “[a]ll children with\ndisabilities residing in the State . . . and who are in need\nof special education and related services” be “identified,\nlocated, and evaluated,” a process known as “child find.”\nId. § 1412(a)(3)(A). Once a disabled child in need of\nspecial education is identified, the local school district\nmust evaluate the child’s specific needs and develop\nan “individualized educational program,” or “IEP,”\noutlining the particular special-education services that\nare necessary to allow the child to learn in the “least\nrestrictive environment.” Id. §§ 1412(a)(4)-(5), 1414. The\ncontent of an IEP and the meaning of “least restrictive\nenvironment” are nuanced topics that we need not\nexplore here. With limited exceptions, an “IEP Team”\nmust be convened and meet within 90 days of the child’s\ninitial referral, see W IS. S TAT. § 115.78(3)(a) (1998);1 the\nIEP Team must include various educational professionals\nand the child’s parent or guardian, see 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1414(d)(1)(B). Once an IEP is in place, the school must\nprovide the services listed in it, and the IDEA sets out\nmany rules governing the process of amending an IEP.\nThese topics, too, are beyond the scope of inquiry here.\n  To ensure that each disabled child receives a free ap-\npropriate public education, the IDEA also requires\nStates to provide various procedural safeguards to stu-\n\n\n\n1\n  The statutory time frame has since been shortened to\n60 days. See W IS . S TAT § 115.78(3)(a).\n\f6                                  Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\ndents and parents. See id. § 1415. A parent may file a\ncomplaint “with respect to any matter relating to the\nidentification, evaluation, or educational placement of\nthe child,” id. § 1415(b)(6)(A), and may request an\nimpartial due-process hearing to resolve the complaint,\nid. § 1415(f). After receiving a final decision from the\nhearing officer, the parent may appeal to the state educa-\ntional agency. Id. § 1415(g). Finally, a still-aggrieved\nparent may file a civil action seeking review of the deci-\nsion. Id. § 1415(i)(2). The IDEA also requires that parents\nbe given notice of their procedural rights at various\ntimes, including when the school district first proposes\nor refuses to evaluate a child for a disability. Id.\n§ 1415(b)(3), (c)(1).\n  Wisconsin implements the IDEA through sections\n115.758-115.90 of the Wisconsin Statutes, which track the\nIDEA’s requirements while adding functional detail.\nOne provision of particular importance here, section\n115.90, gives DPI—the state educational agency charged\nwith overseeing Wisconsin’s IDEA compliance—various\nenforcement mechanisms if individual schools or school\ndistricts are not fulfilling their statutory obligations.\nSpecifically, DPI may order a school district to submit\na “corrective plan” that addresses the area of noncom-\npliance, withhold state funding until the violation is\nfixed, or if the first two methods are unsuccessful, ask\nthe state attorney general to bring a lawsuit against the\nschool district to force compliance. W IS. S TAT. § 115.90.\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                  7\n\nB. Proceedings Below\n  The procedural history of this case is lengthy and\ncomplex; we will simplify where we can. In 2001 Jamie S.\nand six other named plaintiffs brought this class-action\nsuit against MPS and DPI alleging a host of IDEA viola-\ntions. Jamie is cognitively impaired and was at that time\nan eight-year-old student in an MPS school. The other\nnamed plaintiffs are (or were) MPS students with disabili-\nties ranging from deafness to Asperger’s syndrome to\nvarious emotional disturbances. The parties consented\nto the jurisdiction of a magistrate judge, see 28 U.S.C.\n§ 636(c)(1), and the plaintiffs moved to certify a class\nof all Milwaukee-area students who “are or may be\neligible for special education and related services under\nIDEA and Wisconsin law due to their disabilities.” The\nmagistrate judge declined to certify a class of this\nscope based largely on concerns about exhaustion of\nadministrative remedies. But the judge believed that\nsome of plaintiffs’ claims could be litigated as a class\nnotwithstanding their failure to exhaust administrative\nremedies.\n  To that end, the judge divided the proposed class\ninto two categories: those having “pre-determination\nclaims” and those having “post-determination claims.”\nThese were terms of the court’s own creation and referred\nto IDEA violations arising before an IEP meeting takes\nplace and IDEA violations arising after an IEP takes\nplace. Although the IDEA generally requires plaintiffs\nto use the administrative dispute-resolution process\nbefore filing suit, the judge thought that exhaustion of\n\f8                                  Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\nadministrative remedies for “pre-determination claims”\nwould be futile because parents of children with these\nkinds of claims might not know they have a right to\nadministrative review. For this reason the judge\nexcused, on a class-wide basis, the failure to exhaust\nadministrative remedies for pre-determination claims.\nOn the other hand, the judge thought that parents who\nhad attended an IEP meeting would understand their\nright to administrative review. Accordingly, the judge\nheld that the administrative system is adequate for post-\ndetermination claims and declined to excuse the exhaus-\ntion requirement for this category.\n  This approach meant the plaintiffs could litigate\ntheir pre-determination claims as a class, but their post-\ndetermination claims had to proceed individually (or\nnot at all if administrative remedies had not been ex-\nhausted). Accordingly, the judge invited the plaintiffs to\ntry again at class certification using the court’s pre-\ndetermination/post-determination distinction. After two\nmore rounds of briefing, the judge settled on his own\nclass definition. On November 14, 2003, the court entered\nan order certifying the following class:\n    Those students eligible for special education services\n    from the Milwaukee Public School System who are,\n    have been or will be either denied or delayed entry\n    or participation in the processes which result in a\n    properly constituted meeting between the IEP team\n    and the parents or guardians of the student.\n  Following class certification and several years of dis-\ncovery, the court conducted a two-phase bench trial on\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                   9\n\nliability. In Phase I the court heard testimony from\nexperts regarding MPS’s and DPI’s compliance with the\nIDEA. Satisfied that a full trial was warranted, the court\nconducted lengthy Phase II proceedings in which the\nparties presented further evidence regarding the basis for\nthe experts’ opinions. In a written decision issued on\nSeptember 11, 2007, the court found both MPS and DPI\nliable for “systemic” violations of the child-find require-\nments of the IDEA. Specifically, the court found that\nfrom September 2000 to June 2005, MPS committed the\nfollowing IDEA violations on a system-wide basis: it\nfailed to identify children with suspected disabilities\nand refer them for evaluation within the statutory 90-\nday time frame; improperly extended the 90-day time\nframe; imposed suspensions in a way that frustrated\ndisability referrals; and failed to ensure that parents\nattended IEP meetings. The court also found that DPI\nfailed in its oversight duties.\n  The court based its liability findings primarily on\nthe opinion testimony of Dr. Diana Rogers-Adkinson,\na special-education professor at the University of\nWisconsin-Whitewater who served as the plaintiffs’\nprimary expert. She reviewed approximately 200 MPS\nstudent files but engaged in no statistical analysis or\nother accepted analytical method to determine whether\nany particular violation of the IDEA could properly be\ncharacterized as “systemic.” Instead, she based her\nopinion entirely on “patterns” or “trends” she observed\nin the student files. During the time period in question,\nMPS annually enrolled 95,000 to 97,000 students, ap-\nproximately 16,000 of whom were eligible for special\n\f10                                  Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\neducation every year. Dr. Rogers-Adkinson did not\nexplain how a review of 200 student files could yield\na conclusion that MPS was in systemic violation of the\nIDEA during the relevant five-year period.\n   Indeed, the court’s 64-page liability order does not\ncontain any analysis subjecting Dr. Rogers-Adkinson’s\ntestimony to the standards applicable to expert witnesses\nunder Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. To the\ncontrary, the court expressly acknowledged that her\nopinion was not based on any scientific method but\ninstead rested on what she loosely termed a “qualitative\nanalysis” of the student files she reviewed. After iden-\ntifying “certain patterns” and “trends” in the student files,\nDr. Rogers-Adkinson simply “projected” the patterns and\ntrends “over the entire MPS district” and said she\n“believe[d] . . . the same trends would appear if a\nscientific or true random sampling of files had been\nconducted.” Without mentioning the requirements of\nRule 702, the court summarily accepted Dr. Rogers-\nAdkinson’s methodology as an adequate factual founda-\ntion for finding MPS in systemic violation of the IDEA:\n“The court accepts the qualitative analysis methodology\nused by Dr. Rogers-Adkinson. The court further\naccepts her Child Find trends or patterns and applies\nthem system wide to MPS.”\n  In response to the court’s liability order, DPI entered\ninto settlement negotiations with the plaintiff class and\neventually presented a settlement agreement to the\ncourt for approval. We will describe it in more detail\nlater, but in brief, DPI agreed to order MPS to meet\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                  11\n\nvarious compliance benchmarks within a certain time\nframe and to pay for an independent monitor to oversee\nMPS’s performance. In exchange the plaintiff class dis-\nmissed its claims against DPI and gave away the rights\nof class members to bring representative suits against\nDPI for IDEA violations predating the agreement. Over\nMPS’s vigorous objection, the district court approved\nthe settlement.\n   The case then proceeded to the remedial phase of the\ntrial against MPS alone. The court heard evidence\nand argument on possible remedies, and on November 17,\n2008, ordered the parties to submit posttrial briefs re-\ngarding their final remedial proposals. This order\nincluded two pages of detailed questions, the answers to\nwhich informed the content of the parties’ final pro-\nposals. For example, the court directed the parties to\naddress how putative members of the class were to be\nevaluated for inclusion in the class; how individual\nliability and compensatory-education determinations\nshould be made; which party should prevail when the\nevidence is inconclusive; how disputes between the\nparties should be resolved; and who should pay for the\ndispute-resolution process. The parties submitted briefs\noutlining their preferred remedies and responded to\neach other’s proposal.\n  On June 9, 2009, the court issued a lengthy order setting\nforth an elaborate court-monitored remedial scheme. The\ncourt ordered both general and specific class notice\ndesigned to reach the parent or guardian of as many\npotential class members as possible. Recipients would\n\f12                                 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\nidentify their children as potential class members by\nsubmitting response forms that would initiate a process\nof professional evaluation to determine whether or not\nthe child was a member of the class. The court ordered\nthe creation of a “hybrid” IEP team, closely resembling\nthe IEP team required by the IDEA but including a court-\nappointed independent monitor to oversee its operation.\n  The hybrid IEP team was charged with evaluating the\nresponses to the class notice to determine how to\nproceed in each individual case. In some cases it might be\nobvious that the child is not disabled, and no further\nevaluation would be required. In others a professional\nevaluation would be required to determine whether the\nchild has a disability. In others a full IEP meeting\nwould be needed to determine whether the child requires\nspecial-education services in order to receive a free ap-\npropriate public education. And finally, in some cases\nthe child might be entitled to compensatory education—\na remedy available under the IDEA—to compensate for\na past denial of a free appropriate public education.\nThe hybrid IEP team was given the authority to grant\ncompensatory-education awards, subject to the court’s\noversight. The estimated cost to MPS to implement this\nremedy: between $11.5 and $40 million, depending on\nhow many parents responded and the extent of the com-\npensatory education awarded to qualifying children.\n  The June 9 remedial order also rejected some of the\nremedial proposals made by the parties. For example, the\njudge rejected the plaintiffs’ request for a segregated\ncompensatory-education fund and for “parent advocates”\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                    13\n\nseparate from the independent monitor and denied\nMPS’s request for a binding-arbitration system to\nresolve disputes. Finally, the court ordered the parties to\nnegotiate regarding the independent monitor and the\nform of the class notice. If they could not agree, the\nparties were to submit nominations for the independent\nmonitor and a proposed class-notice form.\n  MPS appealed the June 9 remedial order and also\nsought review of the court’s class-certification decision,\nthe liability order, and the court’s order approving the\nDPI settlement. The plaintiffs sought review of the\ndistrict court’s rejection of their original class definition\nbut missed the deadline for filing a cross-appeal. In the\nmeantime the parties could not agree on an independent\nmonitor or class-notice form, so they submitted competing\nproposals on these two follow-on matters.\n  On August 19, 2009, the court entered an order naming\nthe independent monitor and charging her with the\nresponsibility of “implement[ing] the remedy set forth\nwithin” the June 9 order. This brief order also summarizes\nthe independent monitor’s duties, explains how she is to\nbe paid, and provides some detail about how she would\ninteract with the parties and the court. In a second order\nissued on August 19, the court approved the class-\nnotice form and explained how it should be distributed.\n   The plaintiffs appealed the August 19 orders, but they\nhave no quarrel with the substance of these decisions. That\nis, they do not disagree with the judge’s choice of an\nindependent monitor or the form of the class notice.\nInstead, they ask us to review the denial of their original\nclass-certification motion.\n\f14                                  Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\n  Both sides moved to dismiss the other’s appeal for\nlack of jurisdiction. MPS also moved to stay the June 9\nremedial order pending resolution of its appeal. We\nconsolidated the cases, stayed the remedial order, and\nasked the parties to brief the jurisdictional questions\nalong with the merits.\n\n\n                      II. Discussion\n  These consolidated appeals raise important procedural\nand substantive issues regarding the suitability of IDEA\nclaims for class certification, the kind and degree of\nevidence necessary to find a local school district in sys-\ntemic violation of the IDEA, and the propriety of a federal-\ncourt takeover of a school district’s special-education\nprogram as a remedy for individual IDEA violations.\nWe begin, however, with jurisdictional issues.\n\n\nA. Jurisdiction\n   Both appeals claim appellate jurisdiction under 28\nU.S.C. § 1292(a)(1), which permits immediate appeal\nfrom an interlocutory order “granting, continuing, modi-\nfying, refusing or dissolving” an injunction. Section\n1292(a)(1) “creates an exception from the long-established\npolicy against piecemeal appeals,” but “[t]he exception is\na narrow one and is keyed to the ‘need to permit\nlitigants to effectually challenge interlocutory orders of\nserious, perhaps irreparable, consequence.’ ” Gardner v.\nWestinghouse Broad.

In our decision\nin Springfield, we agreed with that general principle:\n“[O]nly directives awarding the relief plaintiffs seek or\nputting the case on a collision course with that relief are\n‘injunctions’ under § 1292(a)(1).” 818 F.2d at 568. The\nplaintiffs insist that the June 9 order was merely an\norder to formulate proposals for the independent\nmonitor and class notice and that it was only after the\nAugust 19 orders appointing the monitor and approving\nthe class notice that the hybrid IEP system was truly\nin place.\n  This characterization of the June 9 order is disingen-\nuous. It’s true that the court directed the parties\nto consult with each other about the identity of the inde-\npendent monitor and the form of the class notice, and\nto submit proposals if they could not agree. But the bulk\nof the court’s 71-page order was devoted to evaluating\nthe comprehensive remedial proposals the parties had\nalready submitted and explaining the elaborate remedial\nscheme the court had crafted. The order established in\nfine detail the remedial program MPS was required to\nimplement—a scheme designed to produce indi-\nvidualized compensatory-education awards, the ulti-\nmate relief sought in the case.\n  Although the June 9 order left the identity of the inde-\npendent monitor and the content of the class notice to\nbe worked out by the parties, MPS’s obligations were\nnot contingent on those details. Whoever the monitor, and\nwhatever the form of the class notice, the June 9 order\nrequired MPS to create a massive identification and\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                     17\n\nevaluation system consuming significant educational\nresources and costing millions of dollars. Even if the\nhybrid IEP system could not begin operating until the\nindependent monitor was appointed and the class\nnotice was approved, the June 9 order gave the plaintiffs\nthe relief they were seeking and substantially altered\nMPS’s legal rights. The remedial order is the functional\nequivalent of an injunction for purposes of § 1292(a)(1). See\nSpringfield, 818 F.2d at 568. We have jurisdiction over\nMPS’s appeal; the plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss is denied.\n  In contrast, the plaintiffs’ jurisdictional argument in\nsupport of their own appeal is at best inconsistent and at\nworst incoherent. The plaintiffs initially tried to cross-\nappeal from the June 9 remedial order, seeking review\nof the denial of their original class-certification mo-\ntion. But they missed the filing deadline, so they tried a\ndifferent route to get their preferred class definition\nbefore this court: They appealed the August 19 orders\nappointing the independent monitor and approving\nthe class notice, insisting that these orders are the “injunc-\ntion” for purposes of § 1292(a)(1). They are not. Unlike\nthe June 9 order, the August 19 orders do not grant relief\non the merits or substantively alter the parties’ legal\nrelationship. See Jones-El, 374 F.3d at 544; Springfield,\n818 F.2d at 567. They do not require the parties to do\nor refrain from doing anything at all. The district\ncourt had already announced the remedial scheme in\nthe June 9 order, including the appointment of an inde-\npendent monitor and the requirement of general and\nspecific class notice. All that remained was to decide the\nidentity of the monitor and approve the form of the\n\f18                                   Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\nclass notice. These details were surely important, but\nresolving them did not amount to an appealable injunc-\ntion. Cf. Jones-El, 374 F.3d at 544 (“[A]n unappealable\norder is one that interprets or clarifies a prior order and\ndoes not create new rights or obligations independently\nenforceable through a contempt action.”).\n  Moreover, the plaintiffs are plainly engaged in a boot-\nstrapping procedural maneuver. They have no com-\nplaint about the independent monitor or the class notice,\nthough they appealed those decisions; rather, they want\nus to review the denial of their original class-certifica-\ntion motion. This is an improper attempt to revive\ntheir untimely cross-appeal from the June 9 remedial\norder. We dismiss the plaintiffs’ appeal.\n  Finally, MPS seeks review of the district court’s orders\ncertifying the class, finding liability, and approving\nDPI’s settlement.

First, the class is both fatally indefi-\nnite and lacks the commonality required by Rule 23(a)(2).\nFurthermore, although the case was certified as a class\naction for injunctive and declaratory relief under\nRule 23(b)(2), final injunctive or corresponding de-\nclaratory relief cannot be ordered on a class-wide basis,\nas required for a Rule 23(b)(2) class.\n  We begin with the terms of the class definition, some-\nthing over which the parties and the judge struggled\nmightily. The plaintiffs initially sought to represent a\nclass so broad that it effectively included all students\neligible for special education and related services from\nMPS. The original proposed class thus joined together\nall Milwaukee-area disabled students, regardless of\ndifferences in their disabilities or educational situations,\nwhose procedural or substantive rights under the IDEA\n\f22                                      Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\nwere violated in any way. The district court properly\nrejected this sweeping class definition, but not for the\nobvious reason that it sought to lump together thousands\nof disparate plaintiffs with widely varying individual\nclaims. Rather, the court rejected the plaintiffs’ proposed\nclass definition based on difficulties associated with the\nIDEA’s requirement that administrative remedies be\nexhausted before filing suit.\n  The district court was justifiably concerned about the\nadministrative-exhaustion requirement. But the court’s\neffort to resolve the problem was misguided. The court\nsua sponte divided the class into two categories: those\nwith “pre-determination claims” and those with “post-\ndetermination claims.” These designations were ap-\nparently meant to categorize individual violations of the\nIDEA, separating those that occurred prior to an IEP\nmeeting from those that occurred after an IEP meeting.\nThe judge thought this categorization made it possible\nto excuse the exhaustion requirement for “pre-deter-\nmination claims” and allow these alleged IDEA viola-\ntions to be litigated on a class-wide basis, while\nenforcing the exhaustion requirement for “post-determina-\ntion claims,” excluding them from class-action treatment.\n  There is reason to doubt the propriety of this approach,\nbut for present purposes we will address it on its own\nterms. Ordinarily, a plaintiff may not file an IDEA\nlawsuit without first exhausting available administrative\nremedies. See 20 U.S.C. § 1415; Honig v.

The district court\napplied this exception to all pre-determination claims,\nreasoning that the parents of disabled students might\nnot be fully aware of the right to administrative\nremedies prior to a properly constructed IEP meeting,\nmaking exhaustion an exercise in futility.2 Once an IEP\nmeeting is convened, however, the court thought that\n\n\n2\n   We question this reasoning. Wisconsin law requires that\nparents be notified of their administrative-review rights when\na child is initially referred for evaluation, well before an IEP\nmeeting occurs. W IS . S TAT . § 115.792(1)(b). For this reason\nthe defendants argued below that if exhaustion was to be\nexcused on a class-wide basis for violations occurring before\nparents received notice of their right to administrative\nremedies, it should be excused for pre-referral claims only.\nThe district court rejected this argument, perceiving “too\ngreat” a “potential of having parties unwittingly forgo their\nrights.” Even when notice of administrative remedies was\nprovided, the judge was “not sanguine with the fact that this\ninformation is always properly delivered or that the parents\nhave a full understanding of the information.” Let’s assume\nfor the sake of argument that it was appropriate to waive the\nexhaustion requirement on a class-wide basis on the rationale\nthat parents “lacked full understanding” of their rights. The\nplaintiffs, as the proponents of the futility exception to\nthe exhaustion requirement, would bear the burden of estab-\nlishing this lack of understanding. See Polera v. Bd. of Educ.\nof Newburgh Enlarged City Sch.

That burden is not satisfied by the district court’s\nunsupported intuition that notice might not always be\n“properly delivered” or that parents might not always under-\nstand it.\n\f24                                      Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\nparents would sufficiently understand their rights,\nmaking administrative review adequate and keeping\nthe IDEA’s exhaustion requirement intact for post-determi-\nnation claims. On this rationale the court was willing\nto certify a class defined to include only pre-determina-\ntion claims, for which it excused the plaintiffs’ failure\nto exhaust administrative remedies.3\n\n\n3\n   In settling on the pre-determination/post-determination\nline of demarcation, the district court relied heavily on the\nconcept of “systemic” IDEA violations developed by other\ncircuits, most prominently the Ninth Circuit in Doe ex rel.\nBrockhuis v. Arizona Department of Education, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739735\"><a href=\"/opinion/739735/john-doe-a-juvenile-by-and-through-his-surrogate-parent-barbara/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">678</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 681\n(9th Cir. 1997). Doe discussed the distinction between “systemic”\nand “nonsystemic” IDEA claims in the context of deciding\nwhether to apply the futility exception to excuse the plaintiffs’\nfailure to exhaust administrative remedies prior to bringing a\nclass-action suit. Here, however, the district court applied the\nNinth Circuit’s definition of a “systemic” IDEA violation in\ndetermining MPS’s liability, using it as the substantive legal\nstandard for evaluating whether MPS was in noncompliance\nwith the IDEA system-wide. We question whether Doe’s\ndefinition of “systemic” IDEA noncompliance has any value\noutside its specific context—that is, outside the context of\ndeciding as a threshold matter in a proposed IDEA class action\nwhether to excuse the failure to exhaust administrative reme-\ndies. And even in that context, the line drawn in Doe between\nsystemic and nonsystemic violations for purposes of the\nexhaustion requirement seems rather arbitrary. While some\nIDEA violations may implicate the structure of a school\ndistrict’s special-education program and may not be\nremediable through ordinary administrative review, it does\nnot necessarily follow that administrative review is futile or\n                                                    (continued...)\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                       25\n\n    The court thus certified a class of its own creation:\n      Those students eligible for special education services\n      from the Milwaukee Public School System who are,\n      have been or will be either denied or delayed entry\n      or participation in the processes which result in a\n      properly constituted meeting between the IEP team\n      and the parents or guardians of the student.\nIn other words, the certified class combined all disabled\nstudents eligible for special education from MPS who\nwere not identified as potentially eligible for services, not\ntimely referred for evaluation after identification, not\ntimely evaluated after referral, not evaluated in a\nproperly constituted IEP meeting, or whose parents did\nnot (for whatever reason) attend an otherwise proper\nIEP meeting. The court made it clear that students\nwho suffered a pre-determination violation but have\nsince received a proper IEP meeting—for example, stu-\ndents who received a late IEP meeting—are also in-\ncluded in the class.\n  One immediately obvious defect in this class is its\nindefiniteness. A significant segment of the class (of\nunknown and unknowable size) comprises disabled\nstudents who may have been eligible for special education\n\n\n3\n  (...continued)\ninadequate for all violations that are alleged to be “systemic.”\nHowever, because our decision rests on other flaws in the class-\ncertification decision and does not reach the substance of the\ncourt’s liability decision, we neither accept nor reject the\nNinth Circuit’s reasoning in Doe.\n\f26                                      Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\nbut were not identified and remain unidentified. There is\nno question that MPS has a legal obligation under the\nIDEA to seek out disabled students and refer for evalua-\ntion those it reasonably believes are disabled and in\nneed of special education. See 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(3)(A);\nW IS. S TAT. § 115.77(1m)(a). The failure to properly\nidentify a disabled student can itself be a violation of\nthe IDEA if the failure results in the denial of a free ap-\npropriate public education to a qualifying child with a\ndisability.

The problem with a class\nof potentially eligible but unidentified students is not\nthat their rights might not been violated but that the\nrelevant criteria for class membership are unknown.\nBy what standard is class membership to be determined?\nHow is the court to decide whether there was reason\nto believe in 2000-2005 that a presently unidentified child\nwas potentially eligible for special-education services\nfrom MPS? It’s not hard to see how this class lacks the\ndefiniteness required for class certification; there is no\nway to know or readily ascertain who is a member of the\nclass.4 See Oshana, 472 F.3d at 513; Simer, 661 F.2d at 669.\n\n\n4\n  Typical suits for child-find-violations focus on a school\ndistrict’s failure to timely identify a qualifying disability in an\nidentified student, e.g., Richard S. v. Wissahickon Sch.

If we could\neasily identify all Milwaukee students with disabilities\nduring the relevant time period, perhaps we could cross-\ncheck that list against a list of known disabled students\nto determine which students MPS failed to identify and\nrefer for an IEP evaluation. But identifying disabled\nstudents who might be eligible for special-education\nservices is a complex, highly individualized task, and\ncannot be reduced to the application of a set of simple,\nobjective criteria. Every step of the child-find inquiry\nand IEP process under the IDEA is child specific and\nrequires the application of trained and particularized\nprofessional educational judgment. In short, a class of\nunidentified but potentially IDEA-eligible disabled stu-\ndents is inherently too indefinite to be certified.\n  This conclusion draws support from Adashunas v.\nNegley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"380494\"><a href=\"/opinion/380494/joseph-d-adashunas-a-minor-by-his-parents-alvin-and-olga-adashunas-on/\"><span class=\"volume\">626</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">600</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 1980).

We noted the practical difficulty\nin defining the class in this way: “How does one\nidentify class members consisting of persons not identi-\nfied?” Id. at 603. In theory such a class might make sense\nif the process of identifying unknown class members\nwas relatively simple. But because the task of identifying\nlearning-disabled children is a “long, arduous process,”\nand the proposed class of plaintiffs was “so highly\ndiverse and so difficult to identify,” we held that the\nclass was “not adequately defined or nearly ascertain-\nable” and the class action could not be maintained. Id. at\n603-04 (citing DeBremaecker v.

The same is true here.\n  The plaintiffs insist that because the class is defined\nby reference to MPS’s illegal actions—that is, by MPS’s\nfailure to comply with the IDEA—the defect of indefinite-\nness may be forgiven. For this principle they rely on\nAlliance to End Repression v. Rochford, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"350702\"><a href=\"/opinion/350702/alliance-to-end-repression-v-james-m-rochford-etc-american-civil/\"><span class=\"volume\">565</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">975</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 977-\n78 (7th Cir. 1977), in which we upheld the certification\nof two plaintiff classes consisting of organizations and\npersons in Chicago who had been unconstitutionally\nmonitored and harassed by various municipal and\nfederal defendants in retaliation for exercising their\nFirst Amendment rights. The defendants in Rochford\nargued that this class—potentially large in scope and\nwith no ready means of identifying its members—was\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                     29\n\ntoo indefinite to be certified.

We have\nnoted that “[Rochford] is a relic of a time when the\nfederal judiciary thought that structural injunctions\ntaking control of executive functions were sensible. That\ntime is past.” Rahman v. Chertoff, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1189682\"><a href=\"/opinion/1189682/rahman-v-chertoff/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 626 (7th\nCir. 2008). Moreover, the class certified in Rochford is\ndifferent from the one here in at least two critical respects.\nFirst, for reasons we will explain in a moment, class\ncertification in this case does not comply with other\nrequirements of Rule 23; more specifically, the class does\nnot satisfy Rule 23(a)(2)’s commonality requirement,\nand it does not satisfy Rule 23(b)(2). Second, the defen-\ndants’ actions in Rochford provided at least some means\nof identifying class members: Each class member was\nthe victim of some discrete act of harassment that once\nrevealed—for example, through discovery—would in\nturn reveal the identity of the victimized class member.\nNot so with the present class. MPS’s alleged failure to\nidentify disabled students in no way pins down the\nidentities of the class members; the relevant conduct\nhere is not a discrete action as in Rochford but rather a\nfailure to act. The liability and remedial orders are power-\nful evidence of this difference; the elaborate scheme\nfor identifying class members via a hybrid IEP process\n\f30                                    Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\ndramatically illustrates the fatal indefiniteness of this\nclass. Rochford is no help to the plaintiffs here.5\n  Beyond its inherent indefiniteness, the class certified\nhere fails to satisfy Rule 23(a)(2)’s commonality prereq-\nuisite, which requires that the class claims involve\n“questions of law or fact common to the class.” FED. R. C IV.\nP. 23(a)(2). It’s true that ” ‘[e]ven a single [common] ques-\ntion’ will do.” Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2556 (quoting\nRichard A. Nagareda, The Preexistence Principle and the\nStructure of the Class Action, 103 C OLUM . L. R EV . 149, 176,\nn.110 (2003)) (alteration in original). But the Supreme\nCourt explained in Wal-Mart that superficial common\nquestions—like whether each class member is an MPS\nstudent or whether each class member “suffered a viola-\ntion of the same provision of law”—are not enough. Id. at\n2551. Rather, “[c]ommonality requires the plaintiffs to\ndemonstrate that the class members ‘have suffered the\nsame injury.’ ” Id. (quoting Gen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110737\"><a href=\"/opinion/110737/general-telephone-co-of-southwest-v-falcon/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 157 (1982)). The class “claims must depend\nupon a common contention,” and “[t]hat common con-\ntention, moreover, must be of such a nature that it\nis capable of classwide resolution—which means that\ndetermination of its truth or falsity will resolve an\nissue that is central to the validity of each one of the\nclaims in one stroke.” Id.\n\n\n\n5\n  Our conclusion that a class of child-find claims does not fit\nwithin Rochford’s carve-out is reinforced by the fact that we\ndecided Adashunas less than three years after Rochford but\ndid not even cite it.\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                    31\n\n   The plaintiffs identify the following common issue:\n“[A]ll potential class members have suffered as a result\nof MPS’ failure to ensure their Child Find rights under\nIDEA and Wisconsin law.” This completely misunder-\nstands Rule 23(a)(2). Whether MPS failed in its obliga-\ntions under the IDEA and thereby deprived an eligible\ndisabled child of a free appropriate public education is\nthe bottom-line liability question in any individual plain-\ntiff’s IDEA claim. To bring individual IDEA claims\ntogether to litigate as a class, the plaintiffs must show\nthat they share some question of law or fact that can be\nanswered all at once and that the single answer to\nthat question will resolve a central issue in all class mem-\nbers’ claims. That all the class members have “suffered”\nas a result of disparate individual IDEA child-find viola-\ntions is not enough; it does not establish that the\nindividual claims have any question of law or fact in com-\nmon. The plaintiffs have identified no common factual\nor legal question that satisfies the Rule 23(a)(2) standard,\nand it is their burden to do so. See Oshana, 472 F.3d at 513.\n  To illustrate the commonality problem in the certified\nclass, consider two hypothetical students within the\nclass: one has a disability and would be eligible for\nspecial education but has never been identified as being\ndisabled nor gone through the IEP process; another\nwas identified as disabled and received a timely IEP\nmeeting, but the child’s parents did not attend the IEP\nmeeting and were not notified of their right to do so. Both\nscenarios involve violations of the IDEA, but what\ncommon question can be answered that would assist\nthe court in determining MPS’s liability for each? On the\n\f32                                   Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\nplaintiffs’ theory, that question is something like this:\nDid MPS fulfill its IDEA obligations to each child? But\nwhile that generic question is surely a part of both chil-\ndren’s claims, it must be answered separately for each\nchild based on individualized questions of fact and law,\nand the answers are unique to each child’s particular\nsituation.\n  This was the basic commonality problem in Wal-Mart,\nwhich involved a nationwide class-action suit on\nbehalf of female employees of the discount retailer\nfor alleged sex discrimination in violation of Title VII.\nThe Supreme Court summarized the lack of com-\nmonality in this way:\n     In this case, proof of commonality necessarily\n     overlaps with respondents’ merits contention that Wal-\n     Mart engages in a pattern or practice of discrimina-\n     tion. That is so because, in resolving an individual’s\n     Title VII claim, the crux of the inquiry is the reason\n     for a particular employment decision . . . . Here respon-\n     dents wish to sue about literally millions of employ-\n     ment decisions at once. Without some glue holding\n     the alleged reasons for all those decisions together,\n     it will be impossible to say that examination of all\n     the class members’ claims for relief will produce a\n     common answer to the crucial question why was\n     I disfavored.\nWal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2552 (internal quotation marks and\ncitations omitted). Here, too, resolving any individual\nclass member’s claim for relief under the IDEA requires\nan inherently particularized inquiry into the cir-\ncumstances of the child’s case.\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                      33\n\n  That the court narrowed its focus to child-find viola-\ntions (what the court called “pre-determination claims”)\nis not enough. Child-find inquiries, like other aspects of\nthe IDEA, are necessarily child specific. There is no such\nthing as a “systemic” failure to find and refer individual\ndisabled children for IEP evaluation—except perhaps if\nthere was “significant proof” that MPS operated under\nchild-find policies that violated the IDEA. See id. at 2553.\nAs the Supreme Court noted in Wal-Mart, an illegal\npolicy might provide the “glue” necessary to litigate\notherwise highly individualized claims as a class. Id. at\n2552-54. But again, as in Wal-Mart, proof of an illegal\npolicy “is entirely absent here.” Id. at 2553; see also J.B. ex\nrel. Hart v. Valdez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"158421\"><a href=\"/opinion/158421/kl-v-valdez/\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1280</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1289 (10th Cir. 1999)\n(affirming the denial of class certification because the\n“plaintiffs merely attempt to broadly conflate a variety\nof claims [under the IDEA and other statutes] to\nestablish commonality via an allegation of ‘systematic\nfailures’ ”). Lacking any common questions, the class\nfails to satisfy Rule 23(a)(2) and should not have been\ncertified.\n  Finally, it should be clear from our discussion thus\nfar that the district court also erred when it certified\nan injunction class under Rule 23(b)(2). Rule 23(b)(2)\npermits the court to certify a case for class-action treat-\nment if “the party opposing the class has acted or refused\nto act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so\nthat final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory\nrelief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.” FED.\nR. C IV. P. 23(b)(2). The final clause is important: The\n\f34                                  Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\ninjunctive or declaratory relief sought must be “final” to\n“the class as a whole.” See Kartman, 634 F.3d at 892-94. In\nother words, “claims for individualized relief . . . do not\nsatisfy [Rule 23(b)(2)].” Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2557. To\nthe contrary, “Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a single\ninjunction or declaratory judgment would provide\nrelief to each member of the class. It does not authorize\nclass certification when each individual class member\nwould be entitled to a different injunction or declaratory\njudgment against the defendant.” Id.\n   That the plaintiffs have superficially structured\ntheir case around a claim for class-wide injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief does not satisfy Rule 23(b)(2) if as a\nsubstantive matter the relief sought would merely\ninitiate a process through which highly individualized\ndeterminations of liability and remedy are made; this\nkind of relief would be class-wide in name only, and\nit would certainly not be final. See id. (“The key to the\n(b)(2) class is ‘the indivisible nature of the injunctive\nor declaratory remedy warranted . . . .’ ” (quoting\nRichard A. Nagareda, Class Certification in the Age of\nAggregate Proof, 84 N.Y.U. L. R EV. 97, 132 (2009))); see\nalso id. at 2558 (“[T]he relief sought [under Rule 23(b)(2)]\nmust perforce affect the entire class at once . . . .”);\nKartman, 634 F.3d at 892-94; Andrews, 545 F.3d at 577. If\nindividualized relief is sought—even individual injunc-\ntive relief—the named plaintiffs must look elsewhere\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                      35\n\nin Rule 23(b) to obtain certification.6 See Wal-Mart, 131\nS. Ct. at 2558-59; Kartman, 634 F.3d at 895.\n   The relief sought here does not come close to satisfying\nRule 23(b)(2)’s standard. That much is clear from the\nintricate remedial scheme ordered by the district court,\nwhich requires thousands of individual determinations\nof class membership, liability, and appropriate remedies.\nWhile the compensatory-education remedies will often\nor always be injunctive in nature, there can be no\nsingle injunction that provides final relief to the class\nas a whole. It is no answer to say that the June 9 remedial\norder affects the entire class; that order merely estab-\nlishes a system for eventually providing individualized\nrelief. It does not, on its own, provide “final” relief to\nany class member. See Andrews, 545 F.3d at 577. More-\nover, the remedial order requires class notice as a neces-\nsary element of its operation: Only those class members\nwho respond are to be evaluated within the hybrid\nIEP system; nonresponders are unaffected. That the\nputative class members must opt in after notice and then\nbe evaluated for membership in the class—before making\na claim for entitlement to compensatory education—\nbelies the notion that the court can provide final injunc-\ntive relief to the class as a whole. This is not the stuff of\na proper Rule 23(b)(2) class.\n\n\n\n6\n  Our discussion of commonality makes it clear that the present\nclass does not satisfy Rule 23(b)(3). Without even a single\ncommon question of law or fact, common questions cannot\npredominate. See F ED . R. C IV . P. 23(b)(3).\n\f36                                     Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\n  So the class-certification order must be vacated. It\nfollows that without a class to whom MPS can be liable\nand provide a remedy, the liability and remedial orders\nmust be vacated as well. What remains are the claims of\nthe individual plaintiffs; the district court did not find\na denial of a free appropriate public education in any\nindividual case.7 Furthermore, the court’s reasons for\nexcusing administrative exhaustion appear to have\nbeen tied to the class allegations, and it’s not clear\nwhether the court would have excused exhaustion for\nany of the individual claims. Finally, it’s possible—perhaps\nlikely—that some of the named plaintiffs’ individual\nfactual circumstances have changed such that their\nclaims are now moot. We leave to the district court on\nremand the task of determining whether anything\nremains of this case and what, if anything, should\nhappen next.\n\n\nC.

DPI agreed to\nappoint an independent monitor to oversee MPS’s IDEA\ncompliance and develop a compliance plan for MPS—\nwith input from class counsel and the independent\nmonitor—establishing specific requirements that DPI\nwould in turn impose on MPS. The plan’s implementa-\ntion would be tied to several benchmarks DPI promised\nto enforce against MPS. Among other things, DPI agreed\nthat MPS would evaluate 95% of referred students\nwithin the statutory time frame; that MPS would make\nreasonable attempts to include a parent in 95% of IEP\nmeetings; and that MPS would refer 95% of students\nwith a specified number of suspensions and 95% of\nstudents retained in grade to an early intervention\nsystem for the possibility of disability evaluations. The\nsettlement also gave the independent monitor sig-\nnificant oversight authority over MPS, including the\nability to order MPS to make administrative changes to\ncomply with the settlement agreement. In exchange\nfor these and other promises, the settlement released\nDPI from all claims in this suit and also purported to\n\f38                                    Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\npreclude all class members from bringing any representa-\ntive suit against DPI for IDEA violations that occurred\nprior to the settlement date.\n  It should be apparent from the foregoing description\nthat this settlement agreement is highly unusual. DPI’s\nprimary concessions require performance from MPS,\nwhich is not a party to the agreement and did not con-\nsent. Sensing the problem, the district court allowed MPS\nto file an objection to the settlement. MPS argued that the\nsettlement agreement impermissibly affected its legal\nrights and conflicted with state statutes governing DPI’s\noversight authority. The district court framed the\nquestion this way: Does “DPI ha[ve] the authority to\norder MPS to take the actions called for in the pro-\nposed settlement agreement[?]” If DPI has the legal\nauthority to command MPS to take the specified actions,\nthen the state agency’s agreement to impose mandates\non MPS would pose no problem. But if DPI does not\nhave that legal authority—stated differently, if MPS has\na legal right to resist such a demand from DPI—then a\nsettlement agreement binding DPI to impose mandates\non MPS, a nonparty, infringes MPS’s legal rights.\n  “The general rule . . . is that a non-settling party does not\nhave standing to object to a settlement between other\nparties.” Agretti v.

Id. at 247.\nHere, as the district court correctly acknowledged,\nMPS’s substantive objection to the settlement and its\nbasis for standing are one and the same: If the settlement\nagreement prejudiced MPS’s legal rights, MPS may\nobject, and its objection has merit.\n  The district court ultimately held that MPS did not\nhave standing to object because DPI has authority to\nimplement the agreement. As the state agency with\nauthority to dispense federal special-education\nfunding, DPI is responsible for ensuring local compliance\nwith the IDEA’s requirements. See 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(11).\nSection 115.90 of the Wisconsin Statutes outlines the\nthree enforcement mechanisms available to DPI should\na local school district fail to comply:\n   (1) If, as the result of a monitoring procedure or a\n   complaint investigation, the state superintendent finds\n   that a local educational agency has violated this\n   subchapter, the state superintendent may require the\n   local educational agency to submit a corrective plan ad-\n   dressing the violation.\n   (2) If the state superintendent, after reasonable notice\n   and an opportunity for a hearing, finds that a local\n   educational agency has failed to comply with any\n   requirement in this subchapter, the state superinten-\n   dent shall reduce or eliminate special education aid to\n\f40                                   Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\n     the local educational agency until he or she is satisfied\n     that the local educational agency is complying with\n     that requirement.\n     (3) If the state superintendent finds that a corrective\n     plan under sub. (1) has not been implemented, or\n     that withholding aid under sub. (2) has been inade-\n     quate to ensure compliance with this subchapter, the\n     state superintendent shall request the attorney general\n     to proceed against the local educational agency for in-\n     junctive or other appropriate relief.\n(Emphasis added.)\n  The district court focused on DPI’s statutory authority\nunder subsection (2) to withhold MPS’s funding for\nfailure to comply with the IDEA’s requirements. Because\nMPS retained the right to appeal any suspension of funds\nto the Department of Education, see 34 C.F.R. § 76.401,\nthe district court concluded that the settlement did not\nviolate MPS’s rights but rather “could be viewed as\nessentially another corrective action, similar to any one\nof the numerous other corrective action plans previously\nestablished by DPI.”\n  This analysis overlooks key parts of Wisconsin’s en-\nforcement scheme. It’s true that DPI has the authority\nto reduce MPS’s federal funding or eliminate it alto-\ngether. But the settlement agreement does not im-\nplicate DPI’s authority over the disbursement of\nfederal funds; rather, DPI bound itself to impose a cor-\nrective plan on MPS. DPI does not, however, have the\nunilateral authority to impose a corrective plan on a\nnoncompliant local school district. To the contrary,\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                     41\n\nDPI may only require that a local school district develop\nand submit a plan to address areas of IDEA noncompli-\nance; the details of the plan are left to the local school\ndistrict. See W IS. S TAT. § 115.90(1). DPI can force a local\nschool district to take specific remedial action only if\nthe district fails to implement its own corrective plan.\nAlternatively, DPI can withhold or reduce federal funds,\nand if this more dramatic action does not induce compli-\nance, the state superintendent of public instruction can\nask the state attorney general to sue to bring the\nschool district into compliance. See id. § 115.90(3).\n  The local school district’s autonomous authority to\ndevelop its own corrective plan is no small distinction\nin the context of this case. Because DPI cannot\nunilaterally force MPS to take specific remedial action, a\nsettlement that attempts to do exactly that prejudices\nMPS’s legal rights by requiring more of MPS than Wis-\nconsin law permits DPI to impose. The district court’s\nconclusion to the contrary was an error of law, and\nbecause the decision to approve DPI’s settlement turned\nin large part on this legal error, that decision was an\nabuse of discretion.8\n\n\n8\n  The parties note a change in Wisconsin law during the\npendency of these appeals. Under 2009 Wisconsin Act 215\n(published May 13, 2010), the state superintendent of public\ninstruction is empowered to order certain low-performing\nschool districts to take certain remedial actions. However,\nAct 215 does not amend section 115.90, or any other provision\nin the Wisconsin Statutes, Chapter 115, Subchapter V, the\n                                                (continued...)\n\f42                                    Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\n  Apart from this misunderstanding about DPI’s\nstatutory oversight authority, the district court’s approval\nof DPI’s settlement must be vacated for a much simpler\nreason: There can be no class settlement if the class should\nnot have been certified in the first place. See Ortiz v.\nFibreboard Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118319\"><a href=\"/opinion/118319/ortiz-v-fibreboard-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">815</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 858 (1999) (“[T]he determina-\ntion whether ‘proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive\nto warrant adjudication’ must focus on ‘questions that\npreexist any settlement.’ ” (quoting Amchem Prods., Inc. v.\nWindsor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118142\"><a href=\"/opinion/118142/amchem-products-inc-v-windsor/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">591</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 622-23 (1997))).

Although the class that the district court\napproved (all school age children with disabilities who\nreside within the MPS district, who are or may be\neligible for special education services, and who are,\nhave been, or will be denied or delayed entry into or\nparticipation in the IEP process) is considerably more\nnarrow than the class originally proposed by the\nplaintiffs (all school age children with disabilities who\nreside within the MPS district and who are or may be\neligible for special education services), it was never\nformally delimited by the particular types of violations\nthat the plaintiffs were alleging. The consequence of\nsuch an open-ended description of the class, as we noted\nin Rahman, is that “every time plaintiffs file a brief or\nmotion, membership in the class[ ] may change.” Id. at 625.\nThus, at any given point during the litigation, it may not\nbe possible to know from the class definition itself what\nthe true parameters of the class are and what types of\nindividuals might be in the class. Id. at 625-26. In this\ncase, the class has been defined to include all students\neligible for special services who have been denied or\ndelayed entry into the IEP system. That definition\nliterally may include students who were delayed or\ndenied entry due to circumstances having little or\nnothing to do with the defendants’ actions, by essentially\nrandom circumstances that are unique to one student\nor limited to a small number of students, or by circum-\nstances that the class representatives have not identified\nas a basis for relief to the class.\n\f46                                   Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\n   I am mindful that the parties and the court, from the\ntime that the class was certified forward, appear to\nhave developed an understanding that the class would\ninclude the four sets of individuals that the court later\nexpressly identified in its liability decision: (1) students\nwith suspected disabilities who were never referred for\nan evaluation; (2) students who were referred for evalua-\ntion, but whose evaluations were not completed within\nthe requisite 90-day limit; (3) students who were sus-\npended in such a way as to frustrate their evaluation;\nand (4) students whose IEP meetings took place in the\nabsence of their parents. See ante at 9; R. 195 at 3-6; R. 389\nat 61. Moreover, the court’s liability decision was limited\nto the time period commencing in September 2000 and\nending in June 2005. R. 389 at 3. In these respects, the\nlitigation ultimately focused on a class of students that\nwas much more limited than the certified class was on\nits face, and one that in the end was much more definite\nthan the sweeping class we criticized in Adashunas,\nfor example.\n  But even as confined to these four groups of students\nand this roughly five-year period, the class includes\nunknown numbers of variations. To cite one example:\nWhen, in her 2004 report, Dr. Rogers-Adkinson addressed\nMPS’s failure to meet statutory deadlines during the\nassessment process, she identified at least four differ-\nent patterns of delays: (1) delays occasioned by the initial\nmis-categorization of a student’s suspected disability;\n(2) delays caused by extensions of time routinely\nrequested for disability assessments solicited during the\nspring semester; (3) delays triggered by the need for\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                       47\n\nadditional medical records; and (4) delays for reasons not\nrevealed in the files she reviewed. Plaintiffs’ Ex. 8 at 6, 8-9.\nEach of these four scenarios might be a manifesta-\ntion of MPS’s failure to timely identify students with\ndisabilities and to convene IEP meetings to address those\ndisabilities, but it is difficult to discern a common, wrong-\nful policy or practice that might account for them all.\nInstead, this looks more like an effort to sweep many\nindividual plaintiffs and sets of facts into one class on\nthe premise that all reflect illegal conduct by the\ndefendant in practice and culture if not in policy. As the\nmajority points out, ante at 32, that is precisely the sort\nof class that the Supreme Court recently rejected in Wal-\nMart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"219618\"><a href=\"/opinion/219618/wal-mart-stores-inc-v-dukes/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Like\nmy colleagues, I am not convinced that the certified class\nin this case is united by common legal or factual issues.\n   Nonetheless, I do not rule out the possibility that a\nclass properly could be certified in this case or one like\nit, and it is to this limited extent that I dissent. My col-\nleagues have concerns both with the notion that a class\naction may be premised on “systemic” violations of a\nschool district’s child-find obligations and with a class\ncomposed of individuals whose identity cannot be\nknown until the remedial phase of the litigation. How-\never, I believe that notwithstanding the inherently child\nspecific nature of child-find inquiries, a class action\nbased on a truly systemic child-find failure may be\nviable. And the fact that it may not be possible to\nidentify individual class members until the remedial\nphase of the litigation, when prospective members of the\nclass are invited to come forward and establish that\n\f48                                    Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\nthey were among those injured by this systemic failure,\nshould not preclude a class action, which may be the\nonly realistic avenue of relief for those injured by\nsystemic violations of their rights.\n   Systemic violations of the IDEA are cognizable.

The problem here is that\nthe plaintiffs’ claims appear to be based on multiple,\ndisparate failures to comply with the school district’s\nstatutory child-find obligations rather than a truly\nsystemic policy or practice which affects them all. But\nmy colleagues go so far as to state that “[t]here is\nno such thing as a ‘systemic’ failure to find and refer\nindividual disabled children for IEP evaluation—except\nperhaps if there was ‘significant proof’ that MPS\noperated under child-find policies that violated the\nIDEA.” Ante at 33 (emphasis in original) (citing Wal-Mart,\n130 S. Ct. at 2553). Certainly I agree that an illegal policy\nwould support a claim for a systemic violation of the\nIDEA’s child-find mandate. But I also think that wide-\nspread practices might also support such a claim. Cf.\nKing ex rel. King v. E.

Suppose,\nfor example, that MPS ignored and did not refer for\nevaluation students with a particular type of potential\ndisability—e.g., dyslexia—and as a result, large numbers\nof students with that disability went unidentified and\nwere deprived of the educational services to which they\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                   49\n\nwere entitled under the IDEA. To my mind, this would\nbe a genuinely systemic violation of the district’s child-\nfind obligations that would be amenable to recognition\nand remediation in a class action: Notwithstanding the\nfact that each student is unique and is entitled to his\nown, individualized IEP, all members of the class\nwould suffer a common injury resulting from the school\ndistrict’s failure to have appropriate systems in place to\nidentify students with that particular disability. Insisting\ninstead that each student exhaust his administrative\nremedies and/or sue independently would surely mean\nthat many such students would reamin unidentified\nand denied their right to free appropriate public educa-\ntion (if only because they would be unaware of their\nrights) and likely would mean that the systemic viola-\ntion underlying their claims to relief would persist, as\nany individual proceedings would result in individual\nrather than structural relief.\n  A key reason why my colleagues are reluctant to ac-\nknowledge the possibility of a systemic violation of a\nschool district’s child-find obligations is the inability to\nidentify individual class members except by asking\nthe parents of putative class members to come forward\nat the remedial phase of the litigation and to establish, in\nindividual hearings, that their children were in fact\nthe victims of the district’s child-find failures. But this\nmethod of identifying class members is hardly unprece-\ndented. Our decision in McDonald v. United Air Lines, Inc.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"442904\"><a href=\"/opinion/442904/liane-buix-mcdonald-on-her-own-behalf-and-on-behalf-of-all-others/\"><span class=\"volume\">745</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1081</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 1984), reflects a similar approach.\nThe class in McDonald comprised women who had lost\ntheir jobs as a result of United Air Line’s rule (dating\nback to the 1930s) prohibiting marriage for its female\n\f50                                  Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\n\ncabin attendants. Once this court declared the no-marriage\nrule to be a violation of Title VII’s ban on sex discrim-\nination in Sprogis v. United Air Lines, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"297609\"><a href=\"/opinion/297609/mary-burke-sprogis-v-united-air-lines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1194</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(7th Cir. 1971), any woman who had lost her position as\na result of that rule between the date Title VII took effect\nin 1965 and United’s abolition of the rule in 1968\nbecame entitled to relief. See McDonald v. United Air Lines,\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">587</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">357</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 1978). But many if not most\nof the class members had simply resigned their positions\nin contemplation of the no-marriage rule rather than\nformally protesting the rule or waiting for the company\nto discharge them, so there was no record enabling\neasy identification of those women who left because\nof the no-marriage rule as opposed to another reason.\nConsequently, the onus was on former flight attendants\nto come forward at the final stage of the litigation and\nclaim entitlement to relief, at which point individual,\nadversarial hearings were convened before special\nmasters in order to establish whether each claimant\nin fact left her position because of the illegal rule. See\nMcDonald, 745 F.2d at 1087-88.\n  As in McDonald, there will be times when the nature\nof the challenged conduct makes it difficult if not impos-\nsible to identity who is in the class and is entitled to\nrelief absent some sort of opt-in procedure by putative\nclass members coupled with an adjudicatory procedure\nto confirm that they in fact qualify as class members. In\nMcDonald this was true because so many class members\nsilently resigned their jobs in deference to their em-\nployer’s illegal rule; in a child-find case like this one\nit would be true because the school district neglected\n\fNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274                                    51\n\nits obligation under the IDEA to identify students with\npotential disabilities. This is not a function of a poor or\nopen-ended class definition as in Rahman, but rather\ndue to the fact that the defendant’s conduct did not\nproduce a tidy record of the individuals harmed by\nthat conduct. Identifying class members in such circum-\nstances necessarily will require a relatively cumbersome,\nafter-the-fact inquiry of the sort employed in McDonald\nand as the district court envisioned here. The only alter-\nnative is to foreclose class-wide relief in such cases\nand leave each individual harmed by the defendant’s\nconduct to pursue relief on his or her own, if he or she\nis even aware that a wrong has been committed. Realisti-\ncally, that will mean no relief at all for most individuals.\n  For all of these reasons, I concur in the court’s conclu-\nsion that the class certified in this case was improper, but\nI do not join its conclusion that no class would be\nviable in this case or other litigation alleging violation\nof a school district’s child-find obligations absent an\nability to identify an express policy that violates the IDEA.\n\n\n\n\n                            2-3-12\n\f</pre>",
