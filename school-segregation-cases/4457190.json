Procedural History\n\n   This is an administrative appeal of a Public Utility Commission order\n\nthat set retail electric rates for Entergy in PUC Docket 39896. The\n\nCommission continues to set retail electric rates for Entergy, which is\n\nsituated outside the interconnected grid operated by the Electric Reliability\n\nCouncil of Texas (ERCOT), using traditional rate-setting procedures\n\nprescribed in Chapter 36 of the Utilities Code.\n\n   Entergy initiated the rate case (SAR, ETI Exs. 1–6),1 and after notice was\n\nsent, many parties intervened. (AR, Item 185, Proposal for Decision (PFD)\n\nat 3, Binder 5.) Commission Staff also participated as a party, introducing\n\nevidence and presenting argument. (Id.)\n\n   Administrative law judges (ALJs) conducted the hearing, and then the\n\nparties filed briefs with the ALJs. (AR, Items 152–155, 157–158, Binder 3;\n\n159–162, 164, 167–175, Binder 4; 176–177, Binder 5.) The ALJs issued their\n\n\n\n      1\n           The administrative record in this case was admitted into evidence as Joint\nExhibits Nos. 1 through 13. R.R. at 5:11–5:19. Exhibits 1–3 are indices to the\nadministrative record. Exhibits 4–10 and 13 include seven volumes of filings, which are\nreferenced as “Item”; thirty-five volumes of exhibits; and one transcript. Citations to\nthat part of the Administrative Record will be in the form “AR, Item(s) ___,” for filings,\n“AR, ___ Ex(s). ___,” for exhibits, and “AR, Tr. at ___” for transcripts. Exhibits 11 and\n12 contain Entergy’s entire rate-filing package. They are two boxes containing six items\nnumbered 1–6. Because different documents are numbered 1–6 in the other parts of the\nadministrative record, citations to the Supplemental Administrative Record will be in\nthe form “SAR, Item(s) ___.”\n\n                                            1\n\fproposal for decision (AR, Item 185 (PFD)) that discussed the evidence and\n\narguments and proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Parties\n\nfiled exceptions to the PFD, and the case was sent to the Commission. (AR,\n\nItems 191–197, 200–206, Binder 6; AR, Items 207–208, Binder 7.)\n\n   After considering the case in open meeting, the Commission issued its\n\norder (AR, Item 227, Binder 7), parties filed motions for rehearing (AR,\n\nItems 228–29, 231–42, Binder 7), and the Commission granted those\n\nmotions in part and denied them in part in its order on rehearing (Order).\n\n(AR, Item 244, Binder 7.) The Order, the Commission’s final, appealable\n\norder, adopted much of the PFD. (AR, Order at 1.)\n\n   Entergy, the utility, filed a suit for judicial review against the\n\nCommission. So did the following ratepayer groups: Cities, a group of\n\ncities in Entergy’s service area; OPUC; and State Agencies, certain Texas\n\nagencies that receive electric service from Entergy.2 The cases were\n\nconsolidated, parties filed briefs, and the district court heard argument at\n\nits hearing on the merits.\n\n   After considering the briefing of the parties, the administrative record,\n\nand the argument of the parties at the hearing on the merits, the district\n\n\n\n\n      2\n          Shortly before the hearing on the merits, State Agencies moved to withdraw\ntheir appeal, and the district court granted that motion. (C.R. 2079–83, 2084.)\n\n                                          2\n\fcourt issued its judgment that affirmed the Commission on all but one\n\nissue.\n\n      The Commission, Entergy, and OPUC filed notices of appeal, and have\n\nfiled their appellants’ briefs. The Commission files this brief in response to\n\nthe appellants’ briefs of Entergy and OPUC.\n\nII.      Rate Setting\n\n      Ratemaking is a legislative function. Pub. Util. Comm’n v. GTE-Sw.,\n\nInc., 901 S.W.2d. 401, 406 (Tex. 1995). The Commission exercises\n\ndiscretion when setting rates, which, pursuant to the Administrative\n\nProcedure Act, is done in a contested case. Tex. Gov’t Code § 2001.003(1).\n\nAnd the Public Utility Regulatory Act, (Tex. Util. Code §§ 11.01–66.016)\n\n(PURA), sets out the procedure for the Commission to set rates.\n\n      First, the Commission decides how much revenue the utility needs to\n\nrecover. This revenue requirement is the rate of return multiplied by the\n\nutility’s invested capital (rate base) plus the utility’s reasonable and\n\nnecessary operating expenses:\n\n         (rate base × rate of return) + expenses = revenue requirement.\n\nSee Tex. Util. Code § 36.051. Next, the Commission must design the\n\nrates—determine how much should be collected from different rate classes\n\nand what method to use to collect those amounts.\n\n\n                                       3\n\f   So there are four main components to a Commission rate case: (1) the\n\nutility’s invested capital or rate base; (2) the reasonable rate of return the\n\nutility should earn on its invested capital; (3) the utility’s reasonable and\n\nnecessary operating expenses; and (4) the rate design. In addition, fuel\n\ncosts are recovered through temporary rates called “fuel factors.” In all\n\ncomponents of a rate case, the burden of proof is on the utility. Tex. Util.\n\nCode § 36.006.\n\n   The issues addressed in this brief concern both rate base and expenses.\n\n   A.     Rate Base\n\n   Investments in physical assets are a large part of a utility’s rate base, but\n\nit also includes other assets: regulatory assets—expenses that the\n\nregulatory authority allows the utility to capitalize and recover over time by\n\namortization—and a utility’s self-insurance storm-reserve account.\n\n        1. Hurricane Rita Regulatory Asset\n\n   The issue about the Hurricane Rita regulatory asset (Rita Asset) traces\n\nback to Entergy’s costs of reconstruction after Hurricane Rita. Those costs\n\nwere so great that the Legislature allowed utilities to recover them through\n\nsecuritization—selling bonds. Tex. Util. Code §§ 39.458–.463.\n\n\n\n\n                                       4\n\f   When the Commission authorized Entergy to securitize its Hurricane\n\nRita reconstruction costs in PUC Docket 32907 (Securitization Order),3 the\n\nparties agreed on the amount of Hurricane Rita reconstruction costs, and\n\nEntergy estimated the amount of those costs it would receive through\n\ninsurance proceeds. Securitization Order, FF 24 at 4–5. The amount\n\nsecuritized was reconstruction costs minus estimated insurance proceeds.\n\nSecuritization Order, FF 35 at 7. The parties agreed to true up the amount\n\nof insurance proceeds later. Securitization Order, FF 29 at 5–6.\n\n   Four years later Entergy realized that it would receive approximately\n\n$20 million less in insurance proceeds than it had anticipated, and asked\n\nthe Commission in its 2010 rate case, the Black-box Case, to recover that\n\n$20 million with accrued interest as a regulatory asset. (AR, PFD at 16.)\n\n      2. Self-Insurance Storm Reserve and the 1997 Ice Storm\n\n   The 1997 ice-storm issue concerns Entergy’s self-insurance plan. The\n\nCommission allows a utility to keep funds on hand to cover costs of natural\n\ndisasters rather than paying a third party for insurance to cover those costs.\n\nThe Commission’s rules provide that “a self insurance plan is a plan\n\nproviding for accruals to be credited to reserve accounts.” 16 Tex. Admin.\n\n\n      3\n          Tex. Pub. Util.

The amount in a self-insurance account is\n\ndeducted from rate base. 16 Tex. Admin. Code § 25.231(c)(2)(C)(iii).\n\n   “The reserve accounts are to be charged with property and liability\n\nlosses which occur, and which could not have been reasonably anticipated\n\nand included in operating and maintenance expenses, and are not paid or\n\nreimbursed by commercial insurance.” Id. Shortages in the reserve\n\naccount increase the rate base and any surpluses in the reserve account are\n\nsubtracted from rate base. 16 Tex. Admin. Code § 25.231(c)(2)(E).\n\n   The Commission’s rules also require the utility to “maintain appropriate\n\nbooks and records to permit the commission to properly review all charges\n\nto the reserve account and determine whether the charges being booked to\n\nthe reserve account are reasonable and correct.” Id. Due to an earlier\n\nstatutory rate freeze and later settled rate cases, the Commission, for the\n\nfirst time in this case, addressed charges to Entergy’s storm-damage\n\naccount based on several storm events, including reconstruction and repair\n\ncosts after a severe ice storm in 1997.\n\n   B.    Reasonable and Necessary Expenses\n\n   Entergy raises two issues about expenses: the cost of purchasing\n\ncapacity and the cost of transmission services. In both, Entergy asked the\n\nCommission to increase the amount of expenses used to set rates from the\n\n\n                                          6\n\famount of those expenses in the test year, and in both, the Commission\n\nfound that Entergy failed to meet its burden to prove that the post-test-year\n\nchanges were known and measurable.\n\n   Only reasonable-and-necessary expenses can be recovered in rates. Tex.\n\nUtil. Code § 36.051. Although rates are set for the future, the expenses are\n\nbased on the actual expenses the utility incurred in the test year. 16 Tex.\n\nAdmin. Code § 25.231(b). The test year is “[t]he most recent 12 months for\n\nwhich operating data for an electric utility … are available and shall\n\ncommence with a calendar quarter or a fiscal year quarter.” 16 Tex. Admin.\n\nCode § 25.5(134). The actual test-year expenses that are reasonable and\n\nnecessary will only be adjusted for known-and-measurable changes. 16\n\nTex. Admin. Code § 25.231(b). Because the utility bears the burden of\n\nproof in a rate case (Tex. Util. Code § 36.006), Entergy had to convince the\n\nCommission that any post-test-year expenses it wanted to include in rates\n\nare known-and-measurable changes.\n\n                       Summary of the Argument\n\n   The Commission’s Order should be affirmed. The Commission\n\nreasonably interpreted its prior rate-case order, the Black-box Order, to\n\nauthorize Entergy to book and amortize a regulatory asset for unrecovered\n\nHurricane Rita reconstruction costs. The Black-box Order was ambiguous\n\n\n                                      7\n\fconcerning the Rita Asset. That order was based on a “black box”\n\nsettlement—one where only the amount of rates to be collected was set\n\nforth, not all of the individual components of a rate case. Because the\n\nBlack-box Order did not explicitly state whether booking and amortizing\n\nthe regulatory asset had been authorized, it was ambiguous. Courts defer\n\nto an agency’s interpretation of its prior, ambiguous order, and the\n\nevidence in the record supports the Commission’s decision.\n\n   Substantial evidence supports the Commission’s decision that\n\n$13 million should be added to Entergy’s storm reserve based on the\n\nexpenses Entergy incurred to repair equipment after a severe ice storm in\n\n1997. A prior Commission decision that faulted Entergy for poor service\n\nquality did not amount to a finding that Entergy could not include the\n\nrepair costs in the insurance reserve amount.\n\n   Substantial evidence supports the Commission’s decision that Entergy\n\nfailed to meet its burden of proof to increase the cost of purchasing capacity\n\nand the cost for transmission charges from the amount of those costs\n\nshown in the test-year amounts. The record supports the Commission’s\n\ndecision that Entergy did not meet its burden of proving that requested\n\nchanges were known and measurable.\n\n\n\n\n                                      8\n\f   For example, Entergy based its arguments about purchasing capacity on\n\nthe assumption that it would always purchase the maximum amount under\n\nnew contracts. Entergy claimed that it would have more customers in the\n\nfuture. Not only is that speculative, but the utility failed to account for how\n\nadditional customers would otherwise affect its recovery through rates.\n\nAnd Entergy’s arguments about transmission charges are controlled by\n\nnumerous unknown variables used in a complex formula. The\n\nCommission’s test-year rule is created to avoid just such unknowns.\n\nMoreover, most of Entergy’s request for post-test-year changes to\n\ntransmission costs were based on an agreement that was still waiting for\n\napproval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. That is\n\npatently not a “known” change. Because substantial evidence supports the\n\nCommission’s decisions, the Order should be affirmed.\n\n                                 Argument\n\nI. Standard of Review\n\n   As in any lawsuit, plaintiffs bear the burden of proof. For an\n\nadministrative appeal of the Commission’s order in a contested case, those\n\nchallenging the order must show reversible error; the substantial-evidence\n\nrule described in Section 2001.174 of the Administrative Procedure Act\n\ncontrols. See Anderson v. R.R. Comm’n, 963 S.W.2d 217, 219 (Tex.\n\n\n                                       9\n\fApp.—Austin 1998, pet. denied); Tex. Util. Code § 15.001; Tex. Gov’t Code\n\n§ 2001.174. That rule is very deferential to the agency, but the deference\n\nowed varies depending on the type of error alleged. Issues raised by\n\nEntergy and OPUC invoke the substantial-evidence standard and the\n\narbitrary-and-capricious standard.\n\n   Substantial-evidence Standard\n\n   When reviewing an agency’s fact finding, a court uses the deferential\n\nsubstantial-evidence standard. It prohibits a court from substituting its\n\njudgment for the agency’s as to the weight of evidence. Pub. Util. Comm’n\n\nv. Gulf States Utils. Co., 809 S.W.2d 201, 211 (Tex. 1991). “A court that is\n\nreviewing purely factual administrative findings … may determine only\n\nwhether substantial evidence supports those findings.” Cities of Abilene v.\n\nPub. Util. Comm’n, 146 S.W.3d 742, 748 (Tex. App.—Austin 2004, no pet.).\n\nThe true test is not whether the agency reached the correct conclusion, but\n\nwhether some reasonable basis exists in the record for the agency’s action.\n\nTex. Health Facilities Comm’n v. Charter Med.-Dallas, Inc., 665 S.W.2d\n\n446, 452 (Tex. 1984). “At its core, the substantial evidence rule is a\n\nreasonableness test or a rational basis test.” City of El Paso v. Pub. Util.\n\nComm’n, 883 S.W.2d 179, 185 (Tex. 1994).\n\n\n\n\n                                       10\n\f      Arbitrary-and-capricious Standard\n\n      The Texas Supreme Court has recognized the narrowness of the\n\narbitrary-and-capricious standard of review when applied to agency\n\ndecisions: “[W]e do not think that the legislature intended it to be\n\ninterpreted as a broad, all-encompassing standard for reviewing the\n\nrationale of agency actions.” Charter Med., 665 S.W.2d at 454.\n\n      Courts must uphold a Commission decision if “some reasonable basis\n\nexists in the record for the action taken by the agency.” City of El Paso,\n\n883 S.W.2d at 185.\n\nII.     The district court properly affirmed the Commission’s\n        decision about the amount of the Hurricane Rita regulatory\n        asset to include in Entergy’s rate base. (Responds to\n        Entergy Issue 1)\n\n      The district court properly affirmed the Commission’s determination of\n\nthe amount of the Hurricane Rita regulatory asset (Rita Asset) that was in\n\nEntergy’s rate base when it set rates in this case. Substantial evidence\n\nsupports the Commission’s reasonable decision that Entergy began\n\namortizing that amount through rates set by the Black-box Order. In\n\nEntergy’s 2010 Black-box Case, the Commission allowed the utility to\n\nrecover nearly $20 million of Rita recovery costs by creating and\n\namortizing a regulatory asset. Considering the deference due to the\n\nCommission’s interpretation of its prior ambiguous order, this Court\n\n                                       11\n\fshould also affirm the Commission’s decision about the amount of the Rita\n\nAsset in rate base.\n\n   A.       Factual Background\n\n   The Rita Asset was an issue in Entergy’s preceding rate case, the Black-\n\nbox Case. As explained below, because that case was resolved based on the\n\nparties’ “black box” settlement, the Commission’s order in that earlier case\n\nis ambiguous as to how the Rita Asset was decided.\n\n   The Commission’s Black-box Order4 contained little more detail than the\n\ntotal amount to be recovered in rates and the rate design used to recover\n\nthat amount. In contrast, a typical Commission order adopting rates, like\n\nthe order in this case, spells out in some detail the amounts in each\n\ncategory of invested capital (rate base)5 as well as the total rate base,6 each\n\npart of debt and return on equity used to determine the rate of return,7 the\n\namounts of reasonable and necessary expenses in each category,8 and the\n\n\n        4\n          Tex.

(showing $1,700,128,144 as the total invested capital).\n        7\n            AR, Order at 6–7, FF 64–71 at 18–19.\n        8\n            AR, Order at FF 72–170 at 19–29, Schedules II, IV, & V.\n\n                                             12\n\frate design listing each rate class and explaining how the rates to be paid by\n\neach class will be determined.9 But to reach a settlement in the Black-box\n\nCase, the parties omitted that detail.\n\n   Finding of Fact 16 of the Black-box Order explained that the parties to\n\nthat case agreed that Entergy “should be allowed to implement an initial\n\noverall increase in base-rate revenues of $59 million for usage on and after\n\nAugust 15, 2010.” Black-box Order, FF 16 at 15. And they agreed that\n\nEntergy “should be allowed to implement an additional overall increase in\n\nbase-rate revenues of $9 million on an annualized basis effective for bills\n\nrendered on and after May 2, 2011.” Id. The lack of detail in the Black-box\n\nOrder created an issue in the current rate case about how much of the Rita\n\nAsset was in Entergy’s current rate base.\n\n   In this case, the parties disputed what part of the Rita Asset Entergy\n\nrecovered under the Black-box Order. Entergy argued that it had not\n\nreceived any part of the Rita Asset from the Black-box Order, but in the\n\nalternative argued that only part of the Rita Asset had been recovered\n\nunder the Black-box Order. (AR, Item 157 at 9-13, Binder 3.) Cities argued\n\nthat the rates based on the Black-box Case settlement included\n\namortization of the Rita Asset so that only a portion of that amount\n\n\n      9\n          AR, Order at FF 175–213 at 29–35.\n\n                                         13\n\fremained to be recovered in this rate case. (AR, Item 161 at 10-12, Binder\n\n4.) Commission Staff argued that Entergy had recovered all of the Rita\n\nAsset through the rates set in the Black-box Order, but in the alternative\n\nargued that only part of the Rita Asset had been recovered under the Black-\n\nbox Order. (AR, Item 164 at 10, Binder 4; AR, Staff Ex. 1 (Givens Direct) at\n\n32, Binder 40.)\n\n  The ALJs decided that the Rita Asset had been partially amortized\n\nthrough the Black-box Case rates, but found that the amount recovered\n\nthrough those rates was different from the amounts proposed by any of the\n\nparties. (AR, PFD at 4.) The Commission adopted that part of the PFD.\n\n(AR, Order at 1.)\n\n  B.     Substantial evidence supports the Commission’s\n         reasonable interpretation of its prior, ambiguous order.\n\n       1. The Black-box Order decided the Rita Asset issue.\n\n  The Commission approved creation and amortization of the Rita Asset\n\nin the Black-box Order. All parties in the Black-box Case agreed that\n\nEntergy was entitled to recover the $20 million of overestimated insurance\n\nproceeds that it requested. And, by the terms of the Black-box Order,\n\nEntergy’s request that the Commission approve booking and amortizing the\n\nRita Asset was either approved or denied in that case—it could not have\n\n\n\n                                     14\n\fbeen ignored by the order. Thus, the Black-box Order had to have\n\napproved amortizing the Rita Asset.\n\n  The PFD weighed several factors to determine what the Commission\n\ndecided about the Rita Asset in the Black-box Case:\n\n• The Securitization Order said there would be a true up after the\n\n  insurance proceeds were received.\n\n• Utilities Code Section 39.459(c) says if the timing of receiving insurance\n\n  proceeds means that they were not included in securitization, they\n\n  should be included in the next rate case.\n\n• The Black-box Case was the next rate case.\n\n• In the Black-box Case, no one objected to the regulatory asset or\n\n  amortizing it.\n\n• The Black-box Order said that it resolved all issues except the\n\n  Competitive Generation Services proposal.\n\n• The Black-box Order did not specifically exclude the Rita regulatory\n\n  asset but did specifically exclude some other regulatory assets; some\n\n  others were expressly approved.\n\n(AR, PFD at 20–21.) The last factor shows the ambiguity in the Black-box\n\nOrder. All the other factors weighed in favor of holding that the\n\n\n\n\n                                      15\n\fCommission approved booking and amortizing the Rita Asset in the Black-\n\nbox Order. (Id.)\n\n   Although the Commission relied on all of these considerations, Entergy\n\nattacks the factors individually. But as shown factor-by-factor below,\n\nEntergy’s arguments are unavailing.\n\n         Securitization Docket\n\n   As both the Commission and Entergy note, the Securitization Order said\n\nthat there would be a true up after insurance proceeds were received. And\n\nall agree that once Entergy showed that it would not recover $20 million of\n\nthe Rita reconstruction costs through estimated insurance proceeds, the\n\nCommission should take action to allow Entergy to recover those costs.\n\nThat supports the idea that the Commission would act quickly—in the\n\nBlack-box Case where it was first asked—to approve booking and\n\namortizing the Rita Asset so that Entergy could quickly recover the\n\noverestimated insurance proceeds.\n\n         The statute requires action in the next rate case.\n\n   That the Black-box Case was the “next” base-rate case supports the\n\nCommission’s conclusion that it approved booking and amortizing the Rita\n\nAsset in that case. Entergy’s argument about which statute applies is\n\nirrelevant because all the cited statutes indicate that the utility should\n\n\n                                       16\n\frecover its Rita reconstruction costs as soon as possible; as soon as Entergy\n\nraised the issue in a base-rate case.\n\n   Both the statute cited by the Commission and that cited by Entergy\n\nemphasize the need to get funds to the utility quickly. Utilities Code\n\n§ 39.459(c), cited by the Commission states: “If the timing of a utility’s\n\nreceipt of [insurance proceeds] prevents their inclusion as a reduction to\n\nthe hurricane reconstruction costs that are securitized, the commission\n\nshall take those amounts into account in (1) the utility’s next base rate\n\nproceeding; or (2) any proceeding in which the commission considers\n\nhurricane reconstruction costs.” Section 39.462(a) cited by Entergy stated\n\nthat the utility is entitled to seek recovery “in its next base rate proceeding\n\nor through any other proceedings authorized by Subchapter C, Chapter 39.”\n\nAnd a stated purpose of the hurricane-recovery statutes is “to enable an\n\nelectric utility subject to this subchapter to obtain timely recovery of\n\nhurricane reconstruction costs.” Tex. Util. Code § 39.458(a) (emphasis\n\nadded). Thus, whichever statute applies, the Commission can reasonably\n\nexpect to address insurance proceeds in the next base-rate case or other\n\npermitted Commission case.\n\n   The Commission’s analysis is correct, whichever statute applies: the\n\nCommission should address questions about insurance proceeds for Rita\n\n\n                                        17\n\freconstruction costs when the utility raises the issue in a base-rate case.\n\n(Since both the Black-box Case and this case are base-rate proceedings,\n\nthere is no need to address what other types of proceedings were available.)\n\n             Which is the next rate case?\n\n   The Black-box Case was the “next” base-rate proceeding. “[N]ext base\n\nrate proceeding” (Tex. Util. Code §§ 39.459(c) & .462(a)) refers to “the\n\ntiming of a utility’s receipt of those amounts.” (Tex. Util. Code § 39.459(c)).\n\nThe statute does not refer to the next proceeding after the Commission\n\nauthorized securitization. Thus, the fact that Docket 34800 was Entergy’s\n\nnext rate case10 after securitization did not make it the appropriate docket\n\nto address the $20 million of overestimated insurance proceeds.\n\n   The Black-box Case was the first time Entergy asked to recover the Rita\n\nAsset. And the record indicates that the Black-box Case was the “next”\n\nEntergy rate case after the utility knew that it would not receive the\n\nanticipated $20 million of insurance proceeds. Entergy did not state\n\nexactly when it finally realized that it would not receive $20 million of\n\nanticipated insurance proceeds. But factors indicate that the Black-box\n\n\n      10\n          Tex. Pub. Util.

That is another factor that supports the\n\nCommission’s conclusion that booking and amortizing the Rita Asset was\n\napproved in the Black-box Order.\n\n   The evidence in this case shows that no party to the Black-box Case\n\ndisputed that the $20 million needed to be included in rates. In this case,\n\nPUC Staff Witness Givens testified that, other than a minor adjustment to\n\nthe amount that he recommended, “No other adjustments were\n\nrecommended to the Company’s request for inclusion of the regulatory\n\nasset in rate base or the amortization expense associated with the asset.”\n\n\n\n\n                                     19\n\f(AR, Staff Ex. 1 (Givens Direct) at 33,11 Binder 40.) And Cities witness\n\nGarrett testified: “[E]ven though the last rate case settled, since no party\n\nopposed the Company’s inclusion in rates of the Rita regulatory costs, the\n\nCompany should have been amortizing the Rita regulatory balance since\n\nthe last case, … .” (AR, Cities Ex. 2 (Garrett Direct) at 11, Binder 8.)\n\n   Based on that testimony, the Commission, in this case, decided that in\n\nthe Black-box Case “there was no objection to [Entergy]’s proposed\n\nHurricane Rita regulatory asset, it was authorized by the prior settlement in\n\n[the Securitization Order docket], and the Commission was directed by\n\nPURA § 39.459(c) to take into account [Entergy]’s insurance proceeds\n\nrelated to the Hurricane Rita securitized costs in [Entergy]’s next rate case,\n\nwhich was [the Black-box Case].” (AR, PFD at 21–22.)\n\n             All issues resolved in the Black-box Order\n\n   The Black-box Order states that the parties entered into “a stipulation\n\nand settlement agreement that resolves all of the issues in this proceeding\n\nexcept the issues related to [Entergy]’s proposal for competitive generation\n\nservice.” Black-box Order at 1 (emphasis added). No parties to this case\n\ndispute that “[i]n [the Black-box Case], [Entergy] requested recovery of the\n\n\n\n      11\n           Several exhibits in the Administrative Record have multiple page numbers.\nCitations are to the Bates stamped number on the bottom right of the exhibit unless\nthere is no such number on the page.\n\n                                          20\n\fOverestimated Insurance Proceeds by establishing a regulatory asset of\n\n$19,686,096, plus accrued carrying costs, to be amortized over five years.”\n\n(AR, PFD at 16). And Ordering Paragraph 15 in the Black-box Order states:\n\n“All other motions, requests for entry of specific findings of fact,\n\nconclusions of law, and ordering paragraphs, and any other requests for\n\ngeneral or specific relief, if not expressly granted in this order, are hereby\n\ndenied.” Thus, if the Commission did not address the Rita Asset in that\n\nPUC docket, the Commission denied Entergy’s request.\n\n      Entergy’s attempt to argue that the Commission approved the Rita\n\nAsset but did not order the utility to begin recovering it through\n\namortization is unavailing. As explained above, evidence in this case shows\n\nthat Entergy requested both in the Black-box Case. And, the utility fails to\n\nexplain how only one part of its request could have been approved given the\n\nlanguage of the Black-box Order.\n\n      In this rate case, Entergy bears the burden to prove how much of the\n\nRita Asset is in rate base. The Utilities Code places the burden of proof in a\n\nrate case on the utility. Tex. Util. Code § 36.006. Rate base (also called\n\ninvested capital) is one of the inputs to determine the utility’s revenue\n\nrequirement. Thus, the utility bears the burden to prove the amount of its\n\nrate base. See Cities of Abilene v. Pub. Util. Comm’n, 854 S.W.2d 932,\n\n\n                                       21\n\f936–37 (Tex. App.—Austin 1993) (recognizing the utility’s burden of proof\n\nand that determining rate base is one of the three factors used to determine\n\na utility’s rates), aff’d in part, rev’d in part on other grounds, 909 S.W. 2d\n\n493 (Tex. 1995). This Court recently recognized the utility’s burden to\n\nprove the amount in its rate base when the Court cited the prudence\n\nstandard used to determine whether assets purchased by a utility should be\n\nincluded in rate base. See State Agencies & Insts. of Higher Learning v.\n\nPub. Util. Comm’n, 450 S.W.3d 615, 635 (Tex. App.—Austin 2014, pet.\n\nfiled) (applying the prudence standard to Oncor Electric Delivery\n\nCompany’s purchase of smart meters). And in Entergy Gulf States, Inc. v.\n\nPub. Util. Comm’n, 112 S.W.3d 208 (Tex. App.—Austin 2003, pet. denied),\n\nthe entire case is about the utility’s burden to prove the amount of its rate\n\nbase.\n\n        Because the Rita-Asset question concerns how much is included in\n\nEntergy’s rate base, Entergy bore the burden of proving that amount.\n\n              2.    The Court should defer to the Commission’s\n                    interpretation of its ambiguous Black-box Order.\n\n        A court generally defers to an agency’s interpretation of its prior\n\norder. “Just as we give great weight to an agency’s interpretation of its own\n\nrules and regulations, we give great weight to an agency’s interpretation of\n\nits administrative orders.” AEP Tex. N. Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm’n, 297\n\n                                        22\n\fS.W.3d 435, 447 (Tex. App.—Austin 2009, pet. denied). “If the Settlement\n\nOrder is ambiguous, we will affirm the Commission’s interpretation of it in\n\nthe Final Order if the interpretation is supported by substantial evidence.”\n\nCities of Abilene v. Pub. Util. Comm’n, 146 S.W.3d at 748.\n\n      The Court should defer to the Commission’s reasonable\n\ninterpretation of its prior, ambiguous order.\n\nIII. The Commission properly included the 1997 ice-storm\n     recovery costs in the storm-damage reserve account.\n     (Responds to OPUC Issue)\n\n      Substantial evidence shows that the expenses for the 1997 ice-storm\n\nrecovery belong in Entergy’s self-insurance storm-reserve account.\n\n      A.     Background of the storm-reserve account.\n\n      In this case, Entergy showed that it had overdrawn its storm-reserve\n\naccount. In PUC Docket 16705 and in the Black-box Order, Entergy was\n\nallowed to maintain a storm damage reserve of about $15.6 million.12 (AR,\n\nPFD at 45.) But over the course of the 15 years prior to this case, more than\n\n200 storms occurred. (Id.) So Entergy had charged about $101.7 million to\n\nthe reserve account in costs of restoring service (not counting securitized\n\n\n      12\n           Tex. Pub. Util. Comm’n, Application of Entergy Texas for Approval of its\nTransition To Competition Plan and the Tariffs Implementing the Plan, and for the\nAuthority to Reconcile Fuel Costs, to Set Revised Fuel Factors, and to Recover a\nSurcharge for Under-Recovered Fuel Costs, Docket No. 16705 available at\nhttp://interchange.puc.state.tx.us/WebApp/Interchange/Documents/98171.TIF (Oct.\n14, 1998) (second order on rehearing at FOF 120).\n\n                                         23\n\fexpenses). At the same time, Entergy had accrued only about $29.8 million\n\nin its reserve. (Id.) Thus, in this case, Entergy asked the Commission to\n\nagree that the current amount of its storm-reserve account was about a\n\nnegative $59.8 million. (Id.)\n\n     The Commission agreed (AR, Order, FF 50) and ordered the reserve\n\nto be replenished in increments, eventually establishing a $17.6 million\n\nstorm-reserve account. (AR, Order, FF 157-159.) The $13 million of 1997\n\nice-storm costs that OPUC complains about is included in the $59.8 million\n\nnegative storm reserve.\n\n     B.    The Commission did not decide in earlier dockets\n           whether the 1997 ice-storm expenses were properly\n           charged against the storm-reserve account.\n\n     Although there were several Entergy rate cases before this case, none\n\nof them determined whether expenses were properly charged against the\n\nstorm-reserve account. In fact, the Commission did not have the\n\nopportunity to consider whether the 1997 ice-storm expenses were properly\n\ncharged against the storm-reserve account until this 2012 rate case.\n\n     No party disputes that the Commission carried the question whether\n\nthe 1997 ice-storm repair expenses were properly booked against Entergy’s\n\nstorm-reserve account for over a decade. In October 1998, the Commission\n\nordered Entergy to prove the reasonableness and prudence of charging the\n\n\n                                     24\n\fice-storm expenditures against the storm-reserve account in its next\n\n(November 1998) rate case. But that rate case settled in June 1999 without\n\naddressing the 1997 ice-storm expenditures.13 Entergy’s next rate case was\n\ndismissed by the Commission in October 2004 because of a statutory rate\n\nfreeze.14 A March 2009 rate case settled without specifically addressing the\n\nice-storm expenditures, and the Black-box Case settled in December 2010\n\nwithout addressing the expenditures. Accordingly, 15 years after the\n\noriginal storm, the Commission considered the ice storm expenditures in\n\nthis case.\n\n      C.     The reasonableness and prudence of the 1997 ice-\n             storm expenses was based on the evidence in this case;\n             it was not decided in Docket No. 18249.\n\n      OPUC’s reliance on the Service-quality Order is misplaced because it\n\nis based on an incorrect premise. Both here and at the Commission OPUC\n\nclaimed that the Commission had decided that the expenses for the 1997\n\nIce Storm were imprudently incurred in PUC Docket No. 18249 (the\n\n\n\n      13\n          Tex.

(Service-quality Order, at\n\n39.) In the Service-quality Order, the Commission addressed maintenance\n\npolicies, Entergy’s level of spending in the area of operations and\n\nmaintenance, the experience of its personnel, and the consequent quality of\n\nits service. (Id. at 7.) In that 1998 decision, the Commission stated that\n\n“[t]he January 1997 ice storm was certainly a severe storm that would have\n\nadversely affected even the best-maintained distribution system” (Id. at 18;\n\nPFD at p. 56), but the agency also determined that Entergy’s poor service\n\nquality and vegetation management failures aggravated the situation. (Id.\n\nat 18-19.) In response to all the poor service-quality issues shown, the\n\nCommission (1) reduced Entergy’s return on equity by 60 basis points, (2)\n\nrequired Entergy to make refunds to its customers, and (3) imposed\n\nsignificant spending requirements and quantified performance guarantees.\n\n(Id. at 51-53.)\n\n\n      15\n          Tex. Pub. Util. Comm’n, Entergy Gulf States, Inc. Service Quality Issues\n(Severed From Docket 16705), Docket 18249, available at\nhttp://interchange.puc.state.tx.us/WebApp/Interchange/Documents/18249_109_5520\n77.PDF (Apr. 22, 1998) (order on rehearing) (the Service-quality Order).\n\n                                       26\n\f      In this case, the 1997 ice-storm issue was not about the general level\n\nof service provided by Entergy in 1996 but whether the utility proved the\n\n$13 million it spent for repairs after the ice storm was properly charged\n\nagainst the storm-reserve account. The PFD states that Entergy established\n\nthat the expenses it incurred to repair damage and restore service after the\n\nice storm “were reasonable and necessary, and the ALJs find that they\n\nshould be included in the storm damage reserve.” (AR, PFD at 57.) Thus,\n\nthe Commission found that the statements in its 1998 order were not\n\nenough to overcome Entergy’s showing that the actual expenditures were\n\nreasonable, necessary, and prudent.\n\n      D.    Substantial evidence supports the expenses of\n            restoring service after the 1997 Ice Storm.\n\n      Substantial evidence supports the determination that the expenses\n\nEntergy incurred to restore power after the ice storm were reasonable,\n\nnecessary, and prudent. Entergy Witness Shawn Corkran testified that he\n\nreviewed the expenses and “determined that the costs were reasonable and\n\nnecessary to reliably restore service to customers as quickly as possible\n\nafter the ice storm.” (AR, ETI Ex. 48 (Corkran Rebuttal) at 10, Binder 37,\n\nEx. SBC-R-1, at 22.) Entergy backed up this testimony with exhibits\n\ncontaining a breakdown of expenses for labor, materials, transportation,\n\nlodging, and other expenses. (Id.) “[O]nce the ice storm occurred,\n\n                                      27\n\f[Entergy] had to take appropriate action to repair the damage and restore\n\nservice.” (AR, PFD at 57.)\n\n      Substantial evidence also supports the determination that the\n\nexpenses were not reasonably anticipated. Entergy’s Corkran provided 11\n\npages of testimony backed by exhibits providing a detailed breakdown of\n\nthe expenses incurred to take appropriate action to repair the damage and\n\nrestore service once the storm occurred. (AR, ETI Ex. 48 (Corkran\n\nRebuttal) at 4–14, Binder 37, and Ex. SBC-R-1, at 22.) Corkran established\n\nthat the ice storm was the most destructive winter storm to ever hit the\n\nEntergy system. (Id. at 7.) The storm de-energized approximately 3,400\n\nmiles of distribution lines and 560 miles of transmission lines. (Id.) The\n\naffected service area was within the light ice-loading zone according to the\n\nNational Electric Safety Code (“NESC”) in effect at the time, (id. at 9) and\n\nthe light ice-loading zone is defined by no ice accumulation on the\n\ndistribution lines. (Id.) The majority of the damage at issue was caused by\n\nan accumulation of one to three inches of ice while temperatures remained\n\nbelow freezing for more than two days after the storm’s initial onset. (Id.)\n\n      Corkran testified that although Entergy generally exceeds NESC\n\nstrength requirements, the ice storm put an extraordinary burden on the\n\nfacilities, causing the wires, poles, and other equipment to collapse from\n\n\n                                      28\n\fthe weight of the accumulated ice, and causing tree limbs weighed down by\n\nice accumulation to fall on Entergy’s lines. (Id.) Thus, the severe impact of\n\nthe ice storm was not reasonably anticipated in the NESC or by Entergy. In\n\nconclusion, Corkran stated that the ice storm restoration and recovery\n\nexpenses were “reasonable, necessary and prudently incurred.” (Id. at 13-\n\n14.)\n\n       OPUC’s complaint that Entergy failed to identify and quantify which\n\nof its expenses were imprudent is unavailing. Entergy claimed all its\n\nexpenses were reasonable, and a utility is not required to identify which\n\nexpenses are imprudent. Tex. Utils. Elec. Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm’n, 881\n\nS.W.2d 387, 404 (Tex. App.—Austin 1994) (“Nowhere does the supreme\n\ncourt state that a utility must segregate imprudent costs.”), aff’d in part,\n\nrev’d in part on other grounds, 935 S.W.2d 109 (Tex. 1997).\n\n       E.   OPUC’s additional complaints do not show error.\n\n       OPUC’s further complaints are without merit. OPUC has not shown\n\nthat the Commission’s decision is arbitrary and capricious despite being\n\nsupported by substantial evidence.\n\n       The Commission was not required to make an ultimate finding of fact\n\nin statutory language that storm-reserve expenses were “not reasonably\n\nanticipated” as OPUC contends. Neither the Commission’s rule nor the\n\n\n                                      29\n\fUtilities Code require such a finding of fact. See 16 Tex. Admin. Code\n\n§ 25.231(b)(1)(G); Tex. Util. Code § 36.064(a). And, as stated above, the\n\nCommission’s findings in the PFD show the Commission considered that it\n\nwould not have been reasonable to anticipate the devastation caused by the\n\n1997 Ice Storm. An ultimate finding of fact in statutory language is not\n\nrequired if the findings reflect that the Commission considered the required\n\nunderlying criteria. See Meier Infiniti v. Motor Vehicle Bd. 918 S.W.2d 95,\n\n100-01 (Tex. App.—Austin 1996, writ denied).\n\n     Moreover, the Commission did not consider an irrelevant factor when\n\nit decided to include the 1997 ice-storm recovery costs in the storm reserve.\n\nOPUC’s assertion that the Commission improperly considered the passage\n\nof time and “absolved the Company of its burden to prove” its expenditures\n\nwere imprudent is unfounded. (OPUC Appellant’s Brief at 38.) This is\n\nmerely a continuation of OPUC’s incorrect assertion that the utility must\n\nidentify its imprudence.\n\n     OPUC’s requested relief should be denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                     30\n\fIV.   Substantial evidence supports the Commission’s\n      determination that Entergy failed to meet its burden to\n      prove that predicted purchased-power capacity costs were\n      known-and-measurable changes to the test-year data.\n      (Responds to Entergy’s Issue 2).\n\n      Substantial evidence supports the Commission’s determination that\n\nEntergy failed to meet its burden to prove that certain projected costs for\n\npurchasing capacity were known-and-measurable changes from the costs\n\nincurred during the test year. Some contracts Entergy relied upon were not\n\nyet in place, and inputs for the variables in formulas for Entergy’s contracts\n\nwith its affiliates were unknown. Thus, the Commission determined that\n\nEntergy failed meet its burden. The district court properly affirmed this\n\ndetermination, and its judgment should be upheld.\n\n      A.    The Commission uses the utility’s actual expenses\n            during a test year to determine what expenses to\n            include in rates, and they can only be changed for\n            known-and-measurable changes.\n\n      The Commission’s rules require the expenses included in rates to be\n\nbased on the utility’s actual expenses during a test year that ends before the\n\nutility applies to change rates. And only expenses that are reasonable and\n\nnecessary can be recovered. Tex. Util. Code § 36.051. Although rates are\n\nset for the future, “[i]n computing an electric utility’s allowable expenses,\n\nonly the electric utility’s historical test year expenses as adjusted for known\n\nand measurable changes will be considered, … .” 16 Tex. Admin. Code\n\n                                      31\n\f§ 25.231(b). The test year is “[t]he most recent 12 months for which\n\noperating data for an electric utility, electric cooperative, or municipally-\n\nowned utility are available and shall commence with a calendar quarter or a\n\nfiscal year quarter.” 16 Tex. Admin. Code § 25.5(134). Because the utility\n\nbears the burden of proof in a rate case (Tex. Util. Code § 36.006), that\n\nincludes the burden to prove that the post-test-year, purchased-power\n\nagreements are known-and-measurable changes.\n\n      Courts have recognized the Commission’s broad discretion over\n\ndeciding whether to allow post-test-year adjustments. “[T]he\n\nCommission’s authority to allow post-test-year adjustments for ‘known and\n\nmeasurable changes to historical test-year data’ is discretionary.” Cent.\n\nPower & Light v. Pub. Util. Comm’n, 36 S.W.3d 547, 563 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Austin 2000, pet. denied); see also Cities of Corpus Christi v. Pub.\n\nUtil. Comm’n, No. 03-06-00585-CV, 2008 WL 615417 (Tex.

Entergy sought adjustments outside the test year for\n            alleged future capacity expenses.\n\n      Entergy sought adjustments for the capacity costs it alleged would be\n\nincurred outside the test year. Capacity costs, generally, are those “costs\n\nassociated with providing the capability to deliver energy (primarily the\n\ncapital costs of facilities).” Gulf States Utils. Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm’n, 841\n\nS.W.2d 459, 461 (Tex. App.—Austin 1992, writ denied). “‘Capacity costs’\n\nrefers to one element of the price charged by a seller of electric power—an\n\nelement that represents the seller’s fixed costs in generating the power.”\n\nCity of El Paso v. El Paso Elec. Co., 851 S.W.2d 896, 898 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Austin 1993, writ denied). These costs, unlike fuel expenses, are\n\ngenerally recovered through base rates. See City of El Paso v. Pub. Util.\n\nComm’n, 344 S.W.3d 609, 614 (Tex. App.—Austin 2011, no pet.).\n\n      In this case, during the test year, Entergy had purchased-power\n\ncapacity costs of $245.4 million. But Entergy sought to recover an\n\nadditional $31 million based upon what it believed would be the purchased-\n\npower agreements in place during the “rate year,” the first year of new rates\n\nset by the case. Commission Staff and several intervenors opposed\n\nEntergy’s request to recover the additional $31 million and offered\n\ntestimony and argument against Entergy’s proposed adjustment.\n\n\n\n                                       33\n\f      Staff and intervenors pointed out several problems with Entergy’s\n\nproposed post-test-year adjustments, arguing that these additional costs\n\nare mere projections. For example, Entergy relied on projections, rather\n\nthan known actual payments, when estimating what it would pay under\n\nthird-party contracts in the future. Indeed, many of the contracts do not\n\ncontain fixed-price terms, and Entergy’s costs will fluctuate based on\n\nfactors such as required availability and performance. (PFD at 101-02\n\n(citing AR, Tr. at 704-05).) Nevertheless, Entergy “simply assumed it\n\nwould pay the maximum amount possible under each of its third party\n\ncontracts, and disregarded any of the contractual factors that might reduce\n\nits Rate Year payments.” (AR, PFD at 102 (citing AR, Tr. at 704-05).)\n\n      Likewise, the expenses requested under Entergy’s contractual\n\nagreements with its affiliates rest on several assumptions. The contracts do\n\nnot definitively fix prices or quantities, which will fluctuate based on the\n\nspecific operational conditions experienced in the future. (AR, PFD at 102\n\n(citing AR, Tr. at 606).) The ultimate determination of payments will be\n\nbased on a formula set out in a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\n\ntariff, schedule MSS-4. Entergy could not know what variables should be\n\ninserted in that formula. Instead, to project its costs, Entergy made\n\nassumptions about each of the several variables contained in the formula.\n\n\n                                      34\n\f(Id.) Intervenors argued that this was too speculative to constitute a known\n\nand measurable change.\n\n      To illustrate their position that Entergy’s proposed costs were\n\ninherently speculative, the intervenors pointed to a new Entergy contract\n\n(the EA WBL Contract). That contract, which was executed only days\n\nbefore the SOAH hearing, accounted for more than a third of Entergy’s\n\nproposed $31 million increase in expenses. Not only would pricing under\n\nthe contract be determined pursuant to the complex formula in MSS-4, but\n\nalso how much capacity Entergy ultimately purchased would be based on\n\nan allocation percentage between Entergy and other companies that had\n\nnot yet been determined. Moreover, the contract itself might never go into\n\neffect because it is subject to Entergy receiving regulatory approval from\n\nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Even if the contract became\n\neffective in the future, it would still be subject to at least two further\n\nrevisions before any power could be received under the contract. (AR, PFD\n\nat 102-03 (citing AR, ETI Ex. 47 (Cooper Rebuttal) at RRC-R-1, Binder 37,\n\nand AR, Tr. at 628-29).)\n\n      Changes Entergy proposed based on estimated payments under\n\nanother FERC tariff, the MSS-1, also required several assumptions about\n\nthe future. To calculate its obligations under MSS-1, Entergy had to\n\n\n                                        35\n\fforecast not only its own future loads, but the future loads of all the other\n\nOperating Companies16 in the Entergy family of companies. If those\n\nassumptions regarding future loads are incorrect, Entergy’s projected costs\n\ncould be significantly different. (AR, PFD at 103 (citing AR, Tr. at\n\n651–52).) The intervenors pointed out the inconsistency in Entergy’s\n\nposition on the measurability of future load growth, noting that elsewhere\n\nin the case, Entergy took the position that future projected loads should not\n\nbe considered known and measurable. (AR, PFD at 103 (citing AR, Tr. at\n\n1907; see also AR, Item 164 at 28, Binder 4; AR, Item 159 at 27-28, Binder\n\n4.) (emphasis added).) The ALJs also noted the following testimony of\n\nEntergy Witness Phillip May regarding the certainty of Entergy’s MSS-1\n\nprojections:\n\n      Q:     Do you think that the projection . . . of rate year sales that\n             is implicit in the calculation of MSS-1 costs . . . is a known\n             and measurable change?\n\n      A:     I think there is some uncertainty with regard to that\n             projection, yes, sir.\n\n(AR, PFD at 103-04 (citing AR, Tr. at 1918-19).)\n\n      The intervenors also argued that it was inappropriate to impose the\n\nfuture costs of securing capacity to serve a larger, future load on existing\n\n\n\n      16\n          Entergy is one of several related electric companies in Texas, Louisiana,\nArkansas, and Mississippi. Those are called “operating companies” in this case.\n\n                                           36\n\fcustomers without taking into account increased customer growth and\n\nsales revenue. The result, they argued, would violate the “matching\n\nprinciple” whereby “the attendant impacts on all aspects of a utility’s\n\noperations (including revenue, expenses, and invested capital) can with\n\nreasonable certainty be identified, quantified, and matched.” (AR, PFD at\n\n104 (citing AR, Cities Ex. 6 (Nalepa Direct) at 12, Binder 9, citing 16 Tex.\n\nAdmin. Code § 25.231(c)(2)(F)(i)(IV).) “The argument, essentially, is that\n\nthe various new or expanded contracts that [Entergy] has entered into were\n\nexecuted so that, in whole or part, [Entergy] would be able to meet future\n\ndemand, but that [Entergy] is seeking to recover the costs of those new\n\ncontracts from its existing customers.” (AR, PFD at 104 (citing AR, Cities\n\nEx. 6 (Nalepa Direct) at 11, Binder 9; see also AR, Item 161 at 38, Binder 4;\n\nAR, Item 164 at 30, Binder 4; AR, Item 159 at 35-39, Binder 4.).)\n\n      C.    Entergy failed to prove that the adjustments were\n            known-and-measurable changes.\n\n      Weighing all the evidence, the ALJs “conclude[d] that [Entergy]\n\nfailed to meet its burden to prove that the adjustment it seeks to its Test\n\nyear [Purchase Power Capacity Contracts] is known and measurable.” (AR,\n\nPFD at 108.) And the ALJs found that the intervenors had “presented\n\nsubstantial evidence that all of the components of [Entergy]’s purchased\n\n\n\n                                      37\n\fpower capacity contain significant variability and uncertainty in costs.” AR,\n\nPFD at 109.)\n\n      The Commission agreed.17 It denied Entergy’s request for post-test-\n\nyear costs, as set out in Findings of Fact 72 through 86. (AR, Order, FF\n\n72–86.) In its briefing, Entergy cites particular provisions of various\n\ncontracts and argues that it was unreasonable for the Commission to deny\n\nall of the proposed expenses. But Entergy bore the burden to prove that\n\nthese adjustments were known and measurable. Both because whether to\n\nallow post-test-year adjustments is within the Commission’s discretion,\n\nand because these findings are supported by substantial evidence,\n\nEntergy’s complaint should be rejected.\n\nV.    Substantial evidence supports the Commission’s\n      determination that Entergy failed to meet its burden to\n      prove that predicted transmission-equalization charges\n      were known-and-measurable changes to the test-year data.\n      (Responsive to Entergy’s Issue 3).\n\n      As with the purchased-power capacity costs, substantial evidence\n\nsupports the Commission’s determination that Entergy failed to meet its\n\nburden to prove that transmission-equalization expenses that the utility\n\nalleged it would incur outside the test year were known and measurable.\n\n\n\n      17\n          However, after Entergy pointed to an additional $522,002 of purchased\npower capacity costs incurred during the test year, the Commission modified the ALJs’\nproposal to allow for a total recovery of $245,965,886.\n\n                                          38\n\f      A.    Entergy recovers transmission equalization expenses\n            through rates.\n\n      The Entergy-system transmission grid is a large, integrated network\n\nthat is operated for the mutual benefit of all of the Entergy Operating\n\nCompanies. The costs of operating this system are allocated among the\n\nOperating Companies pursuant to Service Schedule MSS-2, a FERC tariff,\n\nunder which each Operating Company contributes its just and reasonable\n\nshare of the costs. Those costs are referred to as “transmission\n\nequalization” payments, and Entergy recovers them as expenses in rates.\n\n      As the ALJs explained, “In any given month, some of the Operating\n\nCompanies might be ‘long’ on the amount of transmission capacity they\n\nown (meaning that they own more capacity than they need) while others\n\nmight be ‘short’ on capacity (meaning they own less capacity than they\n\nneed). In such a month, the long Operating Companies would receive\n\nMSS-2 payments from the short Operating Companies for use of their\n\ntransmission facilities.” (AR, PFD at 110 (citing AR, Tr. at 731, 735).)\n\n      B.    Entergy sought an adjustment based on anticipated\n            post-test-year transmission expenses.\n\n      Entergy sought to recover $9 million more for transmission expenses\n\nthat it incurred in its test year. During the test year, Entergy was short and\n\npaid more than $1.7 million in MSS-2 payments to other Operating\n\n\n                                      39\n\fCompanies. (AR, PFD at 110 (citing AR, Tr. at 723-24, 737; AR, Cities\n\nEx. 28 (ETI response to Cities RFI 3-3), Binder 9.).) Entergy does not\n\ndispute that this $1.7 million represents its total transmission-equalization\n\ncosts incurred during the test year. But, Entergy asked for post-test-year\n\nadjustments based on its estimates of transmission construction projects\n\nexpected to be completed after the test year. These projects would result in\n\nchanges to the relative transmission-line-ownership ratios among the\n\nOperating Companies, with the apparent result that Entergy would be\n\nincreasingly short and its payments under MSS-2 would grow.\n\n      Commission Staff and other parties opposed including these post-\n\ntest-year expenses, arguing that they were not sufficiently known or\n\nmeasurable to include in rates set in this case. Payments under MSS-2 are\n\ncalculated using a complex mathematical formula involving many\n\nvariables, such as the amount of investments in transmission facilities\n\nmade by each Operating Company, the costs of capital for each Operating\n\nCompany, the size of the load demanded by each Operating Company, and\n\nthe amount of state and federal tax paid by each Operating Company.\n\nChanges in any of these variables would change the amount Entergy would\n\nowe—or be due—under the formula. (AR, PFD at 111 (citing AR, ETI Ex. 39\n\n(Cicio Direct) at PJC-1 at 38-43, Binder 36; AR, Tr. at 454-55.).) TIEC\n\n\n                                      40\n\fWitness Pollock testified that any attempt to estimate these many variables\n\n“is susceptible to a host of uncertainties.” (AR, TIEC Ex. 1 (Pollock Direct)\n\nat 29, Binder 41.)\n\n      Aside from the difficulties involved in estimating several variables for\n\nseveral companies, the transmission projects involved had not yet come\n\ninto service and were still in the planning or construction phase. Entergy\n\nacknowledged that if the projects were not completed on schedule, then its\n\nprojected MSS-2 costs would be inaccurate. (AR, PFD at 112 (citing AR, Tr.\n\nat 800-801).) TIEC argued that it would be bad policy for the Commission\n\nto rely on “speculative construction end dates to form the basis of a known\n\nand measurable change to test year costs.” (AR, PFD at 113 (citing AR,\n\nItem 159 at 47, Binder 4).) The intervenors argued that Entergy had\n\noffered scant evidentiary support for some of its estimates, and contended\n\nthat it would be unfair to allow Entergy to immediately begin recovery of\n\nMSS-2 payments that would not be incurred for many months. (AR, PFD\n\nat 113.)\n\n      Cities pointed out an additional uncertainty: Entergy and the various\n\nOperating Companies had announced a plan to sell all of their transmission\n\nassets to a third party. If that transaction took place, it would be\n\nimpossible to know what transmission equalization expenses—if\n\n\n                                      41\n\fany—Entergy would incur. (AR, PFD at 113 n.370 (citing AR, Item 171 at\n\n67-68, Binder 4; AR, Tr. at 113-14; AR, Cities Ex. 4 (Goins Direct) at 20-21,\n\nBinder 8).) In addition, TIEC noted that there are cost-recovery\n\nmechanisms available in the event that Entergy’s rate-year costs deviate\n\nsubstantially from its test-year costs.18 Therefore, Entergy’s proposed post-\n\ntest-year transmission costs were unnecessary.\n\n       C.     Entergy failed to meet its burden, and the Commission\n              denied its requested adjustments.\n\n       Entergy did not convince the ALJs that the utility’s proposed\n\nexpenses were known-and-measurable changes to the test-year expenses.\n\nThe ALJs concluded “that [Entergy] failed to meet its burden to prove that\n\nits proposed Rate Year MSS-2 costs are known and measurable.” (AR, PFD\n\nat 116.) The ALJs noted that the MSS-2 formula requires assumptions\n\nabout a great number of variables. “Changes to any of the variables could\n\noccur during the Rate Year, thereby altering the amount paid by (or\n\nreceived by) [Entergy] during the Rate Year.” (Id.) Moreover, “projects\n\nthat underlie [Entergy]’s Rate Year request are largely not yet built, and\n\nmight never be built.” (Id.) And estimates provided by different parties\n\n\n       18\n           Specifically, a Transmission Cost Recovery Factor under 16 Tex. Admin. Code\n§25.239(c) could allow the utility to “recover its reasonable and necessary costs for\ntransmission infrastructure improvement and changes in wholesale transmission\ncharges to the electric utility under a tariff approved by a federal regulatory authority to\nthe extent that the costs or charges have not otherwise been recovered.”\n\n                                            42\n\fvaried widely. That “illustrat[ed] the problem of deviating from actual Test\n\nyear data in an area that involves so many future contingencies and\n\nunknowns.” (Id.)\n\n      And the ALJs were persuaded by the intervenors’ evidence which\n\ndemonstrated that Entergy’s estimate of its rate-year MSS-2 costs are not\n\nknown and measurable. (Id.)\n\n      The Commission agreed that Entergy had not met its burden to\n\ndemonstrate its estimated expenses were known and measurable and\n\ndetermined that Entergy’s recoverable expenses should be limited to those\n\nincurred during the test year. (AR, Order, FF 87-94.) Substantial evidence\n\nsupports these findings, and Entergy’s complaint should be overruled.\n\n                                   Prayer\n\n      The Commission asks the Court to affirm the district court’s\n\njudgment on the issues raised by Entergy and OPUC, but to reverse the\n\ndistrict court’s judgment to the extent that it found error in the\n\nCommission’s order. The Commission asks the Court for such other relief\n\nas it may be entitled.\n\n                                Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                KEN PAXTON\n                                Attorney General of Texas\n\n\n\n                                      43\n\fCHARLES E.

In its application, Entergy requested approval of an increase in annual base-\nrate revenues of approximately $111.8 million (later lowered to $104.8 million), proposed tariff\nschedules, including new riders to recover costs related to purchased-power capacity and\nrenewable-energy credit requirements, requested final reconciliation of its fuel costs, and\nrequested waivers to the rate-filing package requirements.\n\n       On July 6, 2012, the State Office of Administrative Hearings (SOAH) administrative law\njudges (ALJs) issued a proposal for decision in which they recommended an overall rate increase\nfor Entergy of $28.3 million resulting in a total revenue requirement of approximately $781\nmillion. The ALJs also recommended approving total fuel costs of approximately $1.3 billion.\nThe ALJs did not recommend approving the renewable-energy credit rider and the Commission\nearlier removed the purchased-power capacity rider as an issue to be addressed in this docket. 1\nOn August 8, 2012, the ALJs filed corrections to the proposal for decision based on the\nexceptions and replies of the parties.2 Except as discussed in this Order, the Commission adopts\nthe proposal for decision, as corrected, including findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n\n       Parties filed motions for rehearing on September 25 and October 4, 2012 and filed replies\nto the motions for rehearing on October I 5, 2012. The Commission considered the motions for\n\n\n       1\n           Supplemental Preliminary Order at 2. 3 (Jan. 19, 2012).\n       2\n           Letter from SOAHjudges to PUC (Aug. 8, 20 12).\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                                  Order on Rehearing                          Page 2 of 44\nSOAH Docket No.\n\n\nrehearing at the October 25, 2012 open meeting. The Commission granted Commission Staffs\nmotion for rehearing that requested technical corrections to reflect the rates that resulted from the\nCommission Staff number-running memo that was filed on August 28, 2012. The Commission\nmodifies findings of fact 205, 206, 208, and 210 as requested by Commission Staff and attaches\nCommission schedules I through V to reflects its decisions.                The Commission granted the\nDepartment of Energy's motion for rehearing requesting that finding of fact 198 be modified to\nreflect the applicable off-season for the schedulable intermittent pwnping service. Finding of\nfact 198 is modified to reflect that the off-season is October through May. In its motion for\nrehearing, Entergy noted that findings of fact 178 and 170 should be modified to more\naccurately reflect the procedural history. The Commission modifies findings of fact 178 and\n170 to state that Entergy agreed to extend time to provide the Commission sufficient time to\nconsider the issues in this proceeding on two occasions-at the July 27 and August 30, 2012\nopen meetings.\n\n\n                                                   I. Discussion\n\n                                     A. Prepaid Pension Asset Balance\n        Entergy included in rate base an approximately $56 million item named Unfunded\nPension. 3 This amount represents. the accumulated difference between the annual pension costs\ncalculated in accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SF AS) No. 87\nand the actual contributions made by Entergy to the pension fund-Entergy contributed nearly\n$56 million more to its pension fund than the minimum required by SFAS No. 87. 4\n\n        In Docket No. 33309, the Commission allowed a pension prepayment asset, excluding\nthe portion of the asset that is capitalized to construction work in progress (CWIP), less accrued\ndeferred federal income taxes (ADFIT) to be included in rate base. 5 For the excluded portion,\nthe Commission allowed the accrual of an allowance for funds used during construction\n\n\n\n        3\n            Proposal for Decision at 23 (July 6. 201 2) (PFD).\n        4\n            PFD at 23-24.\n        s Application of AEP Texas Central Company f or Authority to Change Rates, Docket No. 33 309, Order on\nRehearing (March 4, 2008).\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                               Order on Rehearing                                 Page J   or 44\nSOAH Docket N o . -\n\n\n               6\n(AFUDC).           The ALJs concluded that this approach was sound and should be followed in this\n     7\ncase. Thus, the ALJs recommended that the CWIP-related portion of Entergy's prepaid pension\nasset ($25,311,236) should be excluded from the asset and should accrue AFUDC.8 However.\nthe ALJs did not address ADFIT.\n\n         The Commission agrees that the CWIP-related portion of Entergy's pension asset should\nbe excluded from the asset and that this excluded portion should accrue AFUDC . However, the\nCommi ssion also finds that the impact of this exclusion on Entergy 's ADFIT should be reflected.\nWhen items are excluded from rate base, the related ADFIT should also be excluded. The\nadjusted ADFIT for the prepaid pension asset remaining in Entergy's rate base should be reduced\nby $8,858,933, the deferred taxes related to the excluded $25 million. The Commission adds\nnew finding of fact 28A to reflect this modification to Entergy's AD FIT.\n\n\n                                                  B. FIN 48\n         The Financial Accounting Standards Board's Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48) prescribes\nthe way in which a company must analyze, quantify, and disclose the potential consequences of\ntax positions that the company has taken that are legally uncertain. Entergy reported that its\nuncertain tax positions totaled $5,916,46 1. FIN 48 requires that this amount be recorded on\nEntergy' s balance sheet as a tax liability. Entergy also reported that it made a cash deposit with\nthe IRS in the amount of $1,294,683 associated with its FIN 48 liability.9\n\n         The ALJs concluded that Entergy's FIN 48 liability should be included in its ADFIT\nbalance, but the amount of the cash deposit made by Entergy to the lRS attributable to Entergy ' s\nFIN 48 liability should not be included in Entergy's ADFIT balance. Accordingly, the ALJs\nrecommended that $4,621,778 (Entergy's FIN 48 liability of $5,916,461 less the $1,294,683 cash\ndeposit Entergy has already made with the IRS) be added to Entergy's AOFIT balance and thus\n\n\n\n\n         6\n           Remand of Docket No. 33309 {Application of AEP Texas Central Company for Authority to Change\nRates), Docket No. 38772, Order on Remand (Jan. 20, 2011 ).\n         7\n             PFO at 26.\n         8\n             Id. at 24-26.\n         9\n           PFD at 26-27 (citing Rebuttal Testimony of Roberts, Entergy Ex. 64 at 6), 29 (c iting Rebuttal Testimony\nof Roberts, Entergy Ex. 64 at 8).\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                              Order on Rehearing                            Page 4 of 44\nSOAH Docket N o . -\n\n                                           10\nbe used to offset Entergy's rate base.          The ALJs did not recommend the addition of a deferred-\ntax-account rider because no party expressly advocated the addition of such a rider. 11\n\n        The Commission adopts the proposal for decision regarding the adjustment to Entergy's\nADFIT for the amount attributable to Entergy's FIN 48 liability. However, the Commission also\nfollows its precedent regarding the creation of a deferred-tax-account tracker and modifies the\nproposal for decision on this point. In CenterPoint's Electric Delivery Company's last rate case,\nDocket No. 38339, 12 the Commission found that tax schedule UTP-on which companies must\ndescribe, list, and rank each uncertain tax position-would provide the IRS auditors sufficient\ninformation to quickly determine which uncertain tax positions are of a magnitude worth\ninvestigating and that an IRS audit would be more likely to occur on some uncertain tax\npositions. If an IRS audit of a FIN 48 uncertain tax position results in an unfavorable outcome,\nthe utility would not be able to earn a return on the amount paid to the IRS until the next rate\ncase.\n\n        Accordingly, the Commission authorizes Entergy to establish a rider to track unfavorable\nFIN-48 rulings by the IRS. The rider will also allow Entergy to recover on a prospective basis\nan after-tax return of 8.27% on the amounts paid to the IRS that result from an unfavorable FIN-\n48 unfavorable-tax-position audit. The return will be applied prospectively to FIN-48 amounts\ndisallowed by an IRS audit after such amounts are actually paid to the federal government. If\nEntergy subsequently prevails in an appeal of an unfavorable FIN-48 unfavorable-tax-position\ndecision by the IRS, then any amounts collected under rider related to that overturned decision\nshall be credited back to ratepayers.\n\n        The Commission adds new finding of fact 40A and deletes finding of fact 41 consistent\nwith its decision to authorize the deferred-tax-account tracker.\n\n\n\n\n        10\n             PFD at 29.\n        11\n             /d.at 29.\n        12\n             Application of CenterPoint Electric Delivery Company, LLC for Authority to Change Rates, Docket\nNo. 38339, Order on Rehearing at 3-4 (June 23, 2011).\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                                  Order on Rehearing                                   Page 5 or 44\nSOAH Docket No•. . _\n\n\n                                  C. Capitalized Incentive Compensation\n        Entergy capitalized into plant-in-service accounts some of the incentive payments made\nto employees and sought to include those amounts in rate base. The ALJs determined that\nEntergy should not be able to recover its financially based incentive-compensation costs. 13\nTherefore, the portion of Entergy's incentive-compensation costs capitalized during the period\nJuly 1, 2009 through June 30, 20 I 0 that were financially based was excluded from Entergy's rate\nbase. The ALJs also determined that the actual percentages should be used to determine the\namount that is financially based. 14\n\n        In discussing Entergy's incentive compensation as a component of operating expenses,\nthe ALJs adopted the method advocated by Texas Industrial Energy Consumers (TIEC) fo r\ncalculating the amount of the financially based incentive costs. This method uses the actual\npercentage reductions applicable to each of the annual incentive programs that included a\ncomponent of financially-based costs. 15\n\n        In its exceptions regarding capitalized incentive compensation, Entergy advocated for the\nuse of T IEC's methodology to also calculate the amount of capitalized incentive compensation\nthat is financiall y based. Entergy also noted that the amount of the disallowance reflected in the\nschedules, $1,333,352, was calculated using a disallowance factor that included incentive\ncompensation tied to cost-control measures, which the ALJs found to be recoverable in the\noperating-cost incentive-compensation calculation. 16 When the TIEC methodology is applied to\nthe capitalized incentive-compensation costs in rate base, the net result under TIEC ' s\n                                                                                                 17\nmethodology is that only $335,752.96 should be disallowed from capital costs.\n\n       The Commission agrees that capitalized incentive compensation that is financially based\nshould be excluded from rate base and that the exclusion only applies to incentive costs that\nEntergy capitalized during the period from July I, 2009 through June 30, 2010. However, the\nCommission finds that a consistent methodology should be used to calculate the amount to be\n\n\n        13\n             PFD at 171.\n        14\n             Id at 72.\n        15\n             Id. at 174; see also Entergy's Exceptions to the Proposal for Decision at 25-26 (July 23, 2012).\n        16\n             Entergy's Exceptions to the Proposal for Decision at 25-26.\n        17\n             Id.   at 25-26.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                            Order on Rehearing                       Page 6 of 44\nSOAH Docket No.\n\n\nexcluded and therefore that TIEC 's methodology should also be used for calculating the amount\nof capitalized financially based incentive-compensation costs that should be excluded from rate\nbase. Accordingly, the total amount of capitalized incentive-compensation costs that should be\ndisallowed from rate base is $335,752.96.            Finding of fact 61 is modified to reflect this\ndetennination.\n\n        As noted by Commission Staff, this disallowance to plant-in-service alters the expense\nfor ad valorem taxes. Accounting for this disallowance, the appropriate expense amount for ad\nvalorem taxes is $24,921 ,022, 18 an adjustment of $1 ,222,106 to Entergy's test year amount.\nFinding of fact 15 l is modified to reflect this adjustment to property taxes.\n\n\n                                 D. Rate of Return and Cost of Capital\n        The A Us found the proper range of an acceptable return on equity for Entergy would be\nfrom 9.3 percent to 10.0 percent. 19 The mid-point of the range is 9.65 percent. The ALJs found\nthat the effe·ct of unsettled economic conditions facing utilities on the appropriate return on\nequity should be taken into account and that the effect would be to move the ultimate return on\nequity towards the upper limits of the range that was determined to be reasonable.20 The ALJs\nfound that the reasonable adjustment would be 15 basis points, moving the reasonable return on\nequity to 9.80 percent. 21\n\n        The Commission must establish a reasonable return for a utility and must consider\napplicable factors. 22 The Commission disagrees with the ALJs that a utility's return on equity\nshould be detennined using an adder to reflect unsettled economic conditions facing utilities.\nThe Commission agrees with the ALJs, however, that a return on equity of 9.80 percent will\nallow Entergy a reasonable opportunity to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital, but\nfinds this rate appropriate independent of the 15-point adder recommended by the ALJs. A\nreturn on equity of 9.80 percent is within the range of an acceptable return on equity found by\n\n\n        18\n             Commission Number-Run Memorandum at 2 (Aug. 28, 2012).\n        19\n             PFD at 94.\n        20   Id\n        21\n             Id at 94.\n        22\n             PURA §§ 36.051 , .052.\n\fPUC O~ket No. 39896                                   Order on Rehearing                  Page 7 of 44\nSOAH Docket N o . -\n\n\nthe ALJs.

Purchased-Power Capacity Expense\n       The ALJs rejected Entergy's request to recover $31 million more in purchased-power\ncapacity costs than its actual test-year expenses because Entergy had fai led to prove that the\nadjustment was known and measurable,23 and because the request violated the matching\nprinciple.24       Consequently, the ALJs recommended that Entergy' s test-year expenses of\n$245,432,884 be used to set rates in this docket. 25\n\n        Entergy pointed to an additional $533,002 of purchased-power capacity expenses that\nwere properly included in Entergy's rate-filing package, but not provided for in the proposal for\ndeci sion.26 The Commission finds that an additional $533,002 ($6,132 for test-year expenses for\nSouthwest Power Pool fees, $654,082 for Toledo Bend hydro fixed-charges, and -$127,212 for\nan Entergy intra-system billing adjustment that were all recorded in FERC account 555) of\npurchased-power capacity costs were incurred during the test-year and should be added to the\npurchased-power capacity costs in Entergy' s revenue requirement. The Commission modifies\nfindings of fact 72 and 86 to reflect the inclusion of the additional $533,002 of test-year\npurchased-power capacity costs, increasing the total amount to $245,965,886.\n\n\n                                 F. Labor Costs - Incentive Compensation\n        The ALJs found that $6, 196,03 7, representing Entergy's financially-based incentives paid\n                                                                           27\nin the test-year, should be removed from Entergy' s O&M expenses.               The ALJs agreed with\nCommission Staff and Cities that an additional reduction should be made to account for the\nFICA taxes that Entergy would have paid for those costs, 28 but did not include this reduction in a\nfinding of fact.\n\n\n        23\n             PFD at 108-09.\n        24\n             Id. at 109.\n        15\n             Id\n        26\n             Entergy's Exceptions to the Proposal for Decision at 51 .\n        27\n             PFD at 175.\n        28\n             Id at 175-76.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                               Order on Rehearing                         Page 8of 44\nSOAH Docket N o . -\n\n\n        The Commission agrees with the ALJs, but modifies finding of fact 133 to specifically\ninclude the decision that an additional reduction should be made to account for the FICA taxes\nEntergy would have paid on the disallowed financially-based incentive compensation.                   The\nCommission notes that this reduction for FICA taxes is reflected in the schedules attached to this\nOrder.29\n\n\n                                         G. AffiJiate Transactions\n        OPUC argued that Entergy's sales and marketing expenses exclusively benefit the larger\ncommercial and industrial customers, but the majority of the sales, marketing, and customer\nservice expenses are allocated to the operating companies based on customer counts. Therefore,\nthe majority of these expenses are allocated to residential and small business customers. OPUC\nargued that it is inappropriate for residential and small business customers to pay for these\nexpenses.30 The ALJs did not adopt OPUC's position on this issue.\n\n        The Commission agrees with OPUC and reverses the proposal for decision regarding\nallocation of Entergy's sales and marketing expense and finds that $2.086 million of sales and\nmarketing expense should be reallocated using direct assignment.                 The Commission has\npreviously expressed its preference for direct assignment of affiliate expenses. 31                  The\nCommission finds that the following amounts should be allocated based on a total-number-of-\ncustomers basis: ( l ) $46,490 for Project El OPCR56224 - Sales and Marketing - EGSI Texas;\n(2) $17,013 for Project F3PCD10049 - Regulated Retail Systems O&M; and (3) $30,167 fo r\nProject F3PPMMALl2 - Middle Market Mkt. Development. The remainder, $1,992,475, should\nbe assigned to (l) General Service, (2) Large General Service and (3) Large Industrial Power\nService.32 The reallocation has the effect of increasing the revenue requirement allocated to the\nlarge business class customers and reduces the revenue requirement for small business and\nresidential customers. New finding of fact l64A is added to reflect the proper allocation of these\naffiliate transactions.\n\n\n        29\n             See Commission Number Run-Memorandum at 3 (Aug. 28, 2012).\n        30\n             Direct Testimony of Carol Szerszen, OPUC Ex.

Fuel Reconciliation\n       Entergy proposed to allocate costs for the fuel reconciliation to customers using a line-\nloss study performed in 1997. Entergy conducted a line-loss study for the year ending December\n3 1, 2010, which falls in the middle of the two year fuel reconciliation period- July 2009 through\nJune 20 I I- and therefore reflects the actual line losses experienced by the customer classes\nduring the reconciliation period. Cities argued that the allocation of fuel costs incurred over the\nreconciliation period should reflect the current line-loss study performed by Entergy for this case\nand recommended approval on a going-forward basis.                             Fuel factors under P.U.C. SUBST.\nR. 25.237(a)(3) are temporary rates subject to revision in a reconciliation proceeding described\nin P.U.C. SussT. R. 25.236.                   P.U.C. SussT. R. 25.236(d)(2) defines the scope of a fuel\nreconciliation proceeding to include any issue related to the reasonableness of a utility's fuel\nexpenses and whether the utility has over- or under-recovered its reasonable fuel expenses.33\nCities calculated a $3,981 ,27 1 reduction to the Texas retail fuel expenses incurred over the\nreconciliation period using the current line-losses.                       The ALJs rejected Cities' proposed\nadjustment finding that the P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.237(c)(2)(B) requires the use of Commission-\napproved line losses that were in effect at the time fuel costs were billed to customers in a fuel\nreconciliation.34\n\n       The Commission agrees with Cities and reverses the proposal for decision regarding\nwhich line-loss factors should be used in Entergy's fuel reconciliation. Entergy used the 2010\nstudy line-loss calculations to calculate the demand- and energy-related allocations in its cost of\nservice analysis supporting its requested base rates. These same currently available line-loss\nfactors should have been uti lized in Entergy's fuel reconciliation. The Commission finds that\nEntergy' s 20 l 0 line-loss factors should be used to calculate Entergy ' s fuel reconciliation\nover-recovery. As a result, Entergy's fuel reconciliation over-recovery should be reduced by\n$3,981 ,271. Finding of fact 246A and conclusions of law l 9A and 198 are added to reflect the\nCommission's finding that the 2010 line-loss factors be used to reconcile Entergy's fuel costs.\n\n\n\n\n       33\n                Cities' Exceptions to the Proposal for Decision at 20-21 (July 23, 2012) .\n            4\n       .1       PFD at 327-328.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                            Order on Rehearing                    Page lO of 44\nSOAH Docket No.\n\n\n                                    I. MISO Transition Expenses\n       During the Commission' s consideration of the proposal for decision, the parties that\ncontested the amount of Entergy's MISO transition expenses and how the transition expenses\nshould be accounted for reached announced on the record that they had reached an agreement on\nthese issues.35 Those parties agreed that the MISO transition expenses would not be deferred and\nthat Entergy' s base rates should include $1.6 million for MISO transition expense. 36 The\nCommission adopts the agreement of the parties and accordingly modifies finding of fact 251\nand deletes finding of fact 252.\n\n\n                           J. Purchased-Power Capacity Cost Baseline\n       The Commission modified the amount of purchased-power capacity expense in the\ntest-year to be $245,965,886 (see section E above). Finding of fact 255 is modified to reflect the\nchange to the proper test-year purchased-power capacity expense.\n\n\n                                            K. Other Issues\n       New findings of fact 17A, 17B, 17C, 170, and 17 E are added to reflect procedural\naspects of the case after issuance of the proposal for decision.\n\n       In addition, to reflect corrections recommended by the ALJs, findings of fact 116, 123,\n192, 194, and 202 are modified; and new finding of fact l 82A is added.\n\n\nThe Commission adopts the following findings of fact and conclusions of law:\n\n\n                                         II.

ETI serves retail and wholesale electric customers in Texas. As of June 30, 2011 , ETI\n       served approximately 412,000 Texas retail customers. The Federal Energy Regulatory\n       Commission (FERC) regulates ETl ' s wholesale electric operations.\n\n3.     On November 28, 2011, ETI fi led an application requesting approval of: (I) a proposed\n       increase in annual base rate revenues of approximately $ 111 .8 million over adjusted test-\n       year revenues; (2) a set of proposed tariff schedules presented in the Electric Utility Rate\n       Filing Package for Generating Utilities (RFP) accompanying ETI's application and\n       including new riders for recovery of costs related to purchased-power capacity and\n       renewable energy credit requirements; (3) a request for final reconciliation of ETI's fuel\n       and purchased-power costs for the reconciliation period from July 1, 2009 to\n       June 30, 201 l; and (4) certain waivers to the instructions in RFP Schedule V\n       accompanying ETI's application.\n\n4.     The 12-month test-year employed in ETI' s filing ended on June 30, 20 11 (test-year).\n\n5.     ETI provided notice by publication for four consecutive weeks before the effective date\n       of the proposed rate change in newspapers having general circulation in each county of\n       ETI's Texas service territory. ETI also mailed notice of its proposed rate change to all of\n       its customers. Additionally, ETI timely served notice of its statement of intent to change\n       rates on all municipalities retaining original jurisdiction over its rates and services.\n\n6.

On December 7, 2011, the Commission issued its order requesting briefing on threshold\n       legal/policy issues.\n\n9.     On December 19, 2011, the Commission issued its Preliminary Order, identifying 31\n       issues to be addressed in this proceeding.\n\n10.    On December 20, 2011, the Administrative Law Judges (ALJs) issued SOAH Order\n       No. 2, which approved an agreement among the parties to establish a June 30, 2012\n       effective date for the company 's new rates resulting from this case pursuant to certain\n       agreed language and consolidate Application of Entergy Texas, Inc. for Authority to Defer\n       Expenses Related to its Proposed Transition to Membership in the Midwest Independent\n       System Operator, Docket No. 39741 (pending) into this proceeding. Although it did not\n       agree, Staff did not oppose the consolidation.\n\n11.    On January 13, 2012, the ALJs issued SOAH Order No. 4 granting the motions for\n       admission pro hac vice filed by Kurt J. Boehm and Jody M.

On January 19, 2012, the Commission issued a supplemental preliminary order\n       identifying two additional issues to be addressed in this case and concluding that the\n       company's proposed purchased-power capacity rider should not be addressed in this case\n       and that such costs should be recovered through base rates.\n\n13.    ETI timely filed with the Commission petitions for review of the rate ordinances of the\n       municipalities exercising original jurisdiction within its service territory.     All such\n       appeals were consolidated for determination in this proceeding.\n\n14.    On April 4, 2012, the ALJs issued SOAH Order No. 13 severing rate case expense issues\n       into Application of Entergy Texas, Inc. for Rate Case Expenses Severed from PUC\n       Docket No. 39896, Docket No. 40295 (pending).\n\n15.    On April 13, 2012, ETI adjusted its request for a proposed increase in annual base rate\n       revenues to approximately $104.8 million over adjusted test-year revenues.\n\n16.    The hearing on the merits commenced on April 24 and concluded on May 4, 2012.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                           Order on Rehearing                     Page 13 of 44\nSOAH Docket No. -\n\n\n17.     Initial post-hearing briefs were filed on May 18 and reply briefs were filed on May 30,\n        2012.\n\nl7A.    On August 7, 2012, the SOAH ALJs tiled a letter with the Commission recommending\n        changes to the PFD.\n\nl 7B    At the July 27, 20 12 open meeting, ETI agreed to extend time to August 31, 20 12 to\n        provide the Commission sufficient time to consider the issues in this proceeding.\n\nl 7C.   The Commission considered the proposal for decision at the August 17, 2012 and August\n        30, 2012 open meetings.\n\n170.    At the August 30, 20 12 open meeting, ETI agreed to extend time to September 14, 20 12\n        to provide the Commission sufficient time to consider the issues in this proceeding.\n\nl 7E.   At the August 17, 2012 open meeting, parties announced on the record a settlement of the\n        amount of costs for the transition to MISO.\n\nRate Base\n18.     Capital additions that were closed to ETI's plant-in-service between July 1, 2009 and\n        June 30, 2011, are used and useful in providing service to the public and were prudently\n        incurred.\n\n19.     ETI ' s proposed Hurricane Rita regulatory asset was an issue resolved by the black-box\n        settlement in Application of Entergy Texas, Inc. for Authority to Change Rates and\n        Reconcile Fuel Costs, Docket No. 37744 (Dec. 13, 2010).\n\n20.     Accrual of carrying charges on the Hurricane Rita regulatory asset shou ld have ceased\n        when Docket No. 37744 concluded because the asset would have then begun earning a\n        rate of return as part of rate base.\n\n21.     The appropriate calculation of the Hurricane Rita regulatory asset should begin with the\n        amount claimed by ETI in Docket No. 37744, less amortization accruals to the end of the\n        test-year in the present case, and less the amount of additional insurance proceeds\n        received by ETI after the conclusion of Docket No. 37744.\n\n22.     A Test-Year-end balance of $15, 175,563 for the Hurricane Rita regulatory asset should\n        remain in rate base, applying a five-year amortization rate beginning August 15, 2010.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                        Order on Rehearing                         Page 14 of 44\nSOAH Docket N o . -\n\n\n23 .   The Hurricane Rita regulatory asset should not be moved to the storm damage insurance\n       reserve.\n\n24.    The company requested in rate base its prepaid pension assets balance of $55,973,545,\n       which represents the accumulated difference between the Statement of Financial\n       Accounting Standards (SF AS) No. 87 calculated pension costs each year and the actual\n       contributions made by the company to the pension fund.\n\n25.    The prepaid pension assets balance includes $25,311 ,236 capitalized to construction work\n       in progress (CWIP).\n\n26.    It is not necessary to the financial integrity of ETI to include CWIP in rate base, and there\n       was insufficient evidence showing that major projects under construction were efficiently\n       and prudently managed.\n\n27.    The portion of the prepaid pension assets balance that is capitalized to CWIP should not\n       be included in ETI 's rate base.\n\n28.    The remainder of the prepaid pension assets balance should be included in ETI's rate\n       base.\n\n28A.   When items are excluded from rate base, the related ADFIT should also be excluded.\n       The amount of ADFIT associated with the $25 million capitalized to CWIP and excluded\n       from rate base is $8,858,93 3.      The adjusted ADFIT for the prepaid pension asset\n       remaining in Entergy's rate base should be reduced by $8,858,933.\n\n29.    ETI should be permitted to accrue an allowance for funds used during construction on the\n       portion of ETI ' s Prepaid Pension Assets Balance capitalized to CWIP.\n\n30.    The Financial Accounting Standard Board (F ASB) Financial Interpretation No. 48\n       (FIN 48), \"Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,\" requires ETI to identify each of\n       its uncertain tax positions by evaluating the tax position on its technical merits to\n       determine whether the position, and the corresponding deduction, is more-likely-than-not\n       to be sustained by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) if audited.\n\n31.    FIN 48 requires ETI to remove the amount of its uncertain tax positions from its\n       Accumulated Deferred Federal Income Tax (ADFIT) balance for financial reporting\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                         Order on Rehearing                        Page IS of 44\nSOAH Docket No•• •\n\n\n       purposes and record it as a potential liability with interest to better reflect the company's\n       financial condition.\n\n32.    At test-year-end, ETI had $5,916,461 in FIN 48 liabi lities, meaning ETI has, thus far,\n       avoided paying to the IRS $5,916,46 1 in tax dollars (the FIN 48 liability) in reliance upon\n       tax positions that the company believes will not prevail in the event the positions are\n       challenged, via an audit, by the IRS.\n\n33.    ETI has deposited $ 1,294,683 with the IRS in connection with the FIN 48 liability.\n\n34.    The IRS may never audit ETI as to its uncertain tax positions creating the FIN 48\n       liability.\n\n35.    Even if ETI is audited, ETI might prevail on its uncertain tax positions.\n\n36.    ETI may never have to pay the IRS the FIN 48 liabi lity.\n\n37.    Other than the amount of its deposit with the IRS, ETI has current use of the FIN 48\n       liability funds.\n\n38.    Until actually paid to the IRS, the FIN 48 liability represents cost-free capital and should\n       be deducted from rate base.\n\n39.    The amount of $4,621,778 (representing ETl's full FIN 48 liability of $5,916,461 less the\n       $ 1,294,683 cash deposit ETI has made with the IRS for the FIN 48 liability) should be\n       added to ETI's ADFIT and thus be used to reduce ETI's rate base.\n\n40.    ETI 's application and proposed tariffs do not include a request for a tracking mechanism\n       or rider to collect a return on the FfN 48 liability.\n\n40A.   It is appropriate for ETI to create a deferred-tax-account tracker in the form of a rider to\n       recover on a prospective basis an after- tax return of 8.27% on the amounts paid to the\n       IRS that result from an unfavorable FfN 48 audit. The rider will track unfavorable FIN\n       48 rulings and the return will be applied prospectively to FIN 48 amounts disallowed by\n       an IRS audit after such amounts are actually paid to the tederal government. If ETI\n       prevails in an appeal of a FIN 48 decision, then any amounts collected under the rider\n       related to that decision should be credited back to ratepayers.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                       Order on Rehearing                        Page 16 of 44\nSOAH Docket No•. . _\n\n\n41 .   Deleted.\n\n42.    Investor-owned electric utilities may include a reasonable allowance for cash working\n       capital in rate base as determined by a lead-lag study conducted in accordance with the\n       Commission's rules.\n\n43.    Cash working capital represents the amount of working capital, not specifically addressed\n       in other rate base items, that is necessary to fund the gap between the time expenditures\n       are made and the time corresponding revenues are received.\n\n44.    The lead-lag study conducted by ETl considered the actual operations of ETI, adjusted\n       for known and measurable changes, and is consistent with P.U.C.                    SUBST.\n\n       R. 25.231 (c)(2)(B)(iii).\n\n45.    It is reasonable to establish ETI's cash working capital requirement based on ETI's lead-\n       lag study as updated in Jay Joyce's rebuttal testimony and on the cost of service approved\n       for ETI in this case.\n\n46.    As a result of the black-box settlements in Application of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. for\n       Authority to Change Rates and to Reconcile Fuel Costs, Docket No. 34800 (Nov. 7,\n       2008) and Docket No. 37744, the Commission did not approve ETI's storm damage\n       expenses since 1996 and its storm damage reserve balance.\n\n47.    ETI established a prima facie case concerning the prudence of its storm damage expenses\n       incurred since 1996.\n\n48.    Adjustments to the storm damage reserve balance proposed by intervenors should be\n       denied.\n\n49.    The Hurricane Rita regulatory asset should not be moved to the storm damage insurance\n       reserve.\n\n50.    ETI's appropriate Test-Year-end storm reserve balance was negative $59,799,744.\n\n51.    The amount of $9,846,037, representing the value of the average coal inventory\n       maintained at ETI ' s coal-burning facilities, is reasonable, necessary, and should be\n       included in rate base.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                        Order on Rehearing                          Page 17 of 44\nSOAH Docket N o -\n\n\n52.    The Spindletop gas storage facility (Spindlctop facility) is used and useful in providing\n       reliable and flexible natural gas supplies to ETI's Sabine Station and Lewis Creek\n       generating plants.\n\n53.    The Spindletop facility is critical to the economic, reliable operation of the Sabine Station\n       and Lewis Creek generating plants due to their geographic location in the far western\n       region of the Entergy system.\n\n54.    It is reasonable and appropriate to include ETI' s share of the costs to operate the\n       Spindletop facil ity in rate base.\n\n55.    Staff recommended updating ETI' s balance amounts for short-term assets to the 13-\n       month period ending December 20 11 , which was the most recent information available.\n       Staff's proposed adjustments should be incorporated into the calculation of ETI's rate\n       base.\n\n56.    The following short-term asset amounts should be included in rate base: prepayments at\n       $8, 134,35 1; materials and supplies at $29,285,42 1; and fuel inventory at $52,693,485.\n\n57.    The amount of $1, 127,778, representing costs incurred by ETI when it acquired the\n       Spindletop facility, represent actual costs incurred to process and close the acquisition,\n       not mere mark-up costs.\n\n58.    ETI' s $1,127,778 in capitalized acquisition costs should be included in rate base because\n       ETI incurred these costs in conjunction with the purchase of a viable asset that benefits\n       its retail customers.\n\n59.    In its application, ETI capitalized into plant in service accounts some of the incentive\n       payments ETI made to its employees. ETI seeks to include those amounts in rate base.\n\n60.    A portion of those capitalized incentive accounts represent payments made by ETI for\n       incentive compensation tied to financial goals.\n\n6 1.   The portion of ETI's incentive payments that are capitalized and that are financially-\n       based should be excluded from ETI's rate base because the benefits of such payments\n       inure most immediately and predominantly to ETI' s shareholders, rather than its electric\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                         Order on Rehearing                       Page 18 of 44\nSOAH Docket No.\n\n\n       customers.      ETl' s capitalized incentive compensation that is financially based is\n       $335,752.96 and should be removed for rate base.\n\n62.    The test-year for ETI's prior ratemaking proceeding ended on June 30, 2009, and the\n       reasonableness of ETI's capital costs (including capitalized incentive compensation) for\n       that prior period was dealt with by the Commission in that proceeding and is not at issue\n       in this proceeding.\n\n63.    In this proceeding, ETI's capitalized incentive compensation that is financially-based\n       should be excluded from rate base, but only for incentive costs that ETI capitalized\n       during the period from July l , 2009 (the end of the prior test-year) through June 30, 2010\n       (the commencement of the current test-year).\n\nRate ofReturn and Cost of Caoital\n64.    A return on common equity (ROE) of 9.80 percent will allow ETI a reasonable\n       opportunity to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital.\n\n65.    The results of the discounted cash flow model and risk premium approach support a ROE\n       of 9.80 percent.\n\n65A.   It is not appropriate to add 15 points to the ROE due to unsettled economic conditions\n       facing utilities.\n\n66.    A 9.80 percent ROE is consistent with ETI's business and regulatory risk.\n\n67.    ETI's proposed 6.74 percent embedded cost of debt is reasonable.\n\n68.    The appropriate capital structure for ETI is 50.08 percent long-term debt and\n       49.92 percent common equity.\n\n69.    A capital structure composed of 50.08 percent debt and 49.92 percent equity is\n       reasonable in light of ETI' s business and regulatory risks.\n\n70.    A capital structure composed of 50.08 percent debt and 49.92 percent equity will help\n       ETI attract capital from investors.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                         Order on Reheuing                         Page 19 or 44\nSOAH Docket N o . -\n\n\n71.

ETI's test-year purchased capacity expenses were $245,965,886.\n\n73.    ETI requested an upward adjustment of $30,809,355 as a post-test-year adjustment to its\n       purchased capacity costs. This request was based on ETl's projections of its purchased\n       capacity expenses during a period beginning June I, 2012 and ending May 31 , 20 13 (the\n       rate-year).\n\n74.    ETl's purchased capacity expense projections were based on estimates of rate-year\n       expenses for: (a) reserve equalization payments under Schedule MSS-1; (b) payments\n       under third-party capacity contracts; and (c) payments under affiliate contracts.\n\n75.    ETI's projection of its rate-year reserve equalization payments under Schedule MSS-1 is\n       based on numerous assumptions, including load growths for ETI and its affiliates, future\n       capacity contracts for ETI and its affiliates, and future values of the generation assets of\n       ETI and its affiliates.\n\n76.    There is substantial uncertainty with regard to ETI' s projection of its rate-year reserve\n       equalization payments under Schedule MSS-1.\n\n77.    ETI 's projection of its rate-year third-party capacity contract payments includes\n       numerous assumptions, one of which is that every single third-party supplier will perform\n       at the maximum level under the contract, even though that assumption is inconsistent\n       with ETI's historical experience.\n\n78.    There is substantial uncertainty with regard to ETI's projection of its rate-year third-party\n       capacity-contract payments.\n\n79.    ETI's estimates of its rate-year purchases under affili ate contracts are based on a\n       mathematical formula set out in Schedule MSS-4.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                         Order on Rehearing                      Page 20 of 44\nSOAH Docket No.\n\n\n80.    The MSS-4 fonnula for rate-year af1iliate capacity payments reflects that these payments\n       will be based on ratios and costs that cannot be determined until the month that the\n       payments are to be made.\n\n81.    Over $11 million of ETI's affiliate transactions were based on a 2013 contract (the EAi\n       WBL Contract) that was not signed until April 11 , 2012.\n\n82.    There is uncertainty about whether the EAi WBL Contract will ever go into effect\n\n83.    ETI projects purchasing over 300 megawatts (MW) more in purchased capacity in the\n       rate-year than it purchased in the test-year.\n\n84.    ETI experienced substantial load growth in the two years before the test-year, and it\n       continues to project similar load growth in the future.\n\n85.    ETI did not meet its burden of proof to demonstrate that a known and measurable\n       adjustment of $30,809,355 should be made to its test-year purchased capacity expenses.\n\n86.    ETI's purchased capacity expense in this case should be based on the test-year level of\n       $245,965,886.\n\n87.    ETI incurred $1,753,797 of transmission equalization expense during the test-year.\n\n88.    ETI proposed an upward adjustment of $8,942,785 for its transmission equalization\n       expense. This request was based on ETI' s projections of its transmission equalization\n       expenses during the rate-year.\n\n89.    The transmission equalization expense that ETI will pay in the rate-year will depend on\n       future costs and loads for each of the Entergy operating companies.\n\n90.    ETI's projection of its rate-year transmission equalization expenses is uncertain and\n       speculati ve because it depends on a number of variables, including future transmission\n       investments, deterred taxes, depreciation reserves, costs of capital, tax rates, operating\n       expenses, and loads of each of the Entergy operating companies.\n\n91.    ETI seeks increased transmission equalization expenses for transmission projects that are\n       not currently used and useful in providing electric service.          ETI's post-test-year\n       adjustment is based on the assumption that certain planned transmission projects will go\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                            Order on Rthtuing                         Page 21or44\nSOAH Docket N o . -\n\n\n         into service after the test-year.      At the close of the hearing, none of the planned\n         transmission projects had been fully completed and some were still in the planning phase.\n\n92.      It is not reasonable for ETI to charge it-; retail ratepayers for transmission equalization\n         expenses related to projects that are not yet in-service.\n\n93.      ETI's request for a post-test-year adjustment of $8,942,785 for rate-year transmission\n         equalization expenses should be denied because those expenses are not known and\n         measurable. Ell's post-test-year adjustment does not with reasonable certainty reflect\n         what ETI's transmission equalization expense will be when rates are in effect.\n\n94.      ETl's transmission equalization expense in this case should be based on the test-year\n         level of$1,753,797.\n\n95.      P.U.C. SuBST. R. 25.23 l(c)(2)(ii) states that the reserve for depreciation is the\n         accumulation of recognized allocations of original cost, representing the recovery of\n         initial investment over the estimated useful life of the asset.\n\n96.      Except in the case of the amortization of the general plant deficiency, the use of the\n         remaining life depreciation method to recover differences between theoretical and actual\n         depreciation reserves is the most appropriate method and should be continued.\n\n97.      It is reasonable for ETI to calculate depreciation reserve allocations on a straight-line\n         basis over the remaining, expected useful life of the item or facility.\n\n98.      Except as described below, the service lives and net salvage rates proposed by the\n         company are reasonable, and these service lives and net salvage rates should be used in\n         calculating depreciation rates for the company's production, transmission, distribution,\n         and general plant assets.\n\n99.      A 60-year life for Sabine Units 4 and 5 is reasonable for purposes of establishing\n         production plant depreciation rates.\n\nI 00.    The retirement (actuarial) rate method, rather than the interim retirement method, should\n         be used in the development of production plant depreciation rates.\n\nl0 I .   Production plant net salvage is reasonably based on the negative five percent net salvage\n         in existing rates.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                        Order on Rehearing                        Page 22 of44\nSOAH Docket No.\n\n\nI02.     The net salvage rate of negative IO percent for ETI 's transmission structures and\n         improvements (FERC Account 352) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should\n         be adopted.\n\n103.     The net salvage rate of negative 20 percent for ETI's transmission station equipment\n         (FERC Account 353) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be adopted.\n\n104.     The net salvage rate of negative five percent for ETI's transmission towers and fixtures\n         (FERC Account 354) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be adopted.\n\n105.     The net salvage rate of negative 30 percent for ETI's transmission poles and fixtures\n         (FERC Account 355) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be adopted.\n\nI06.     The net salvage rate of negative 30 percent for ETI 's transmission overhead conductors\n         and devices (FERC Account 356) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be\n         adopted.\n\nI 07.    A service life of 65 years and a dispersion curve of R3 for ETI's distribution structures\n         and improvements (FERC Account 361) are the most reasonable of those proposed and\n         should be approved.\n\nI 08.    A service life of 40 years and a dispersion curve of RI for ETI's distribution poles,\n         towers, and fixtures (FERC Account 364) are the most reasonable of those proposed and\n         should be approved.\n\nI09.

A service life of 26 years and a dispersion curve of L4 for ETI's distribution overhead\n        service (FERC Account 369.1) are the most reasonable of those proposed and should be\n        approved.\n\n11 3.   The net salvage rate of negative five percent for ETI's distribution structures and\n        improvements (FERC Account 36 1) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should\n        be adopted.\n\n114.    The net salvage rate of negative 10 percent for ETl's distribution station equipment\n        (FERC Account 362) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be adopted.\n\n11 5.   The net salvage rate of negative seven percent for ETl's distribution overhead conductors\n        and devices (FERC Account 365) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be\n        adopted.\n\n116.    The net salvage rate of positive five percent for ETl's distribution line transformers\n        (FERC Account 368) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be adopted.\n\n117.    The net salvage rate of negative 10 percent for ETl's distribution overhead services\n        (FERC Account 369. l) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be adopted.\n\n118.    The net salvage rate of negative 10 percent for ETI' s distribution underground services\n        (FERC Account 369.2) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be adopted.\n\n119.    A service life of 45 years and a dispersion curve of R2 for ETI's general structures and\n        improvements (FERC Account 390) are the most reasonable of those proposed and\n        should be approved.\n\n120.    The net salvage rate of negative 10 percent for ETl' s general structures and\n        improvements (FERC Account 390) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should\n        be adopted.\n\n121.    It is reasonable to convert the $21.3 million deficit that has developed over time in the\n        reserve for general plant accounts to General Plant Amortization.\n\n122.    A ten-year amortization of the deficit in the reserve for general plant accounts is\n        reasonable and should be adopted.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                         Order on Rehearing                        Page 24 of 44\nSOAH Docket No.\n\n\n123.   FERC pronouncement AR-15 requires amortization over the same life as recommended\n       based on standard life analysis. A standard life analysis determined that a five-year life\n       was appropriate for general plant computer equipment (FERC Account 391.2).\n       Therefore, a five year amortization for this account is reasonable and should be adopted.\n\n124.   ETI proposed adjustments to its test-year payroll costs to reflect: (a) changes to employee\n       headcount levels at ETI and Entergy Services. Inc. (ESI); and (b) approved wage\n       increases set to go into effect after the end of the test-year.\n\n125.   The proposed payroll adjustments are reasonable but should be updated to reflect the\n       most recent available information on headcount levels as proposed by Commission Staff.\n       In addition to adjusting payroll expense levels, the more recent headcount numbers\n       should be used to adjust the level of payroll tax expense, benefits expense, and savings\n       plan expense.\n\n126.   Staff has appropriately updated headcount levels to the most recent available data but\n       errors made by Staff should be corrected. The corrections related to:        (a) a double\n       counting of three ETI and one ES I employee; (b) inadvertent use of the ETI benefits cost\n       percentage in the calculation of ESI benefits costs; (c) an inappropriate reduction of\n       savings plan costs when such costs were already included in the benefits percentage\n       adjustments; and (d) corrections for full-time equivalents calculations.        Staffs ETI\n       headcount adjustment (AG-7) overstated operation and maintenance (O&M) payroll\n       reduction by $224,217, and ESI headcount adjustment (AG-7) understated O&M payroll\n       increase by $37,531.\n\n127.   ETI included $14,187,744 for incentive compensation expenses in its cost of service.\n\n128.   The compensation packages that ETI offers its employees include a base payroll amount,\n       annual incentive programs, and long-term incentive programs. The majority of the\n       compensation is for operational measures, but some is for financial measures.\n\n129.   Incentive compensation that is based on financial measures is of more immediate and\n       predominant benefit to shareholders, whereas incentive compensation based on\n       operational measures is of more immediate and predominant benefit to ratepayers.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                           Order on Rehearing                    Page 25 of 44\nSOAH Docket No.\n\n\n130.   Incentives to achieve operational measures are necessary and reasonable to provide utility\n       services but those to achieve financial measures are not.\n\n131.   The $5,3 76,975 that was paid for long term incentive programs was tied to financial\n       measures and, therefore, should not be included in ETI' s cost of service.\n\n132.   Of the amounts that were paid pursuant to the Executive Annual Incentive Plan, $819,062\n       was tied to financia l measures and, therefore, should be disallowed.\n\n133.   In total, the amount of incentive compensation that should be disallowed is $6, 196,037\n       because it was related to financial measures that are not reasonable and necessary for the\n       provision of electric service. An additional reduction should be made to account for the\n       FICA taxes ETI would have paid on the disallowed financially based incentive\n       compensation.\n\n134.   The amount of incentive compensation that should be included in the cost of service is\n       $7,991, 707.\n\n135.   To attract and retain highly qualified employees, the Entergy companies provide a total\n       package of compensation and benefits that is equivalent in scope and cost with what other\n       comparable companies within the utility business and other industries provide for their\n       employees.\n\n136.   When using a benchmark analysis to compare companies' levels of compensation, it is\n       reasonable to view the market level of compensation as a range rather than a precise,\n       single point.\n\n137.   ETI' s base pay levels are at market.\n\n138.   ETI's benefits plan levels are within a reasonable range of market levels.\n\n139.   ETI's level of compensation and benefits expense is reasonable and necessary.\n\n140.   ETI provides non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plans for highly\n       compensated individuals such as key managerial employees and executives that, because\n       of limitations imposed under the Internal Revenue Code, would otherwise not receive\n       retirement benefits on their annual compensation over $245,000 per year.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                        Order on Rehearing                         Page 26 of 44\nSOAH Docket No•. . . _\n\n\n141.   ETI' s non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plans are discretionary costs\n       designed to attract, retain, and reward highly compensated employees whose interests are\n       more closely aligned with those of the shareholders than the customers.\n\n142.   ETI's non-qualified executive retirement benefits in the amount of $2, 114,931 are not\n       reasonable or necessary to provide utility service to the public, not in the public interest,\n       and should not be included in ETI's cost of service.\n\n143.   For the employee market in which ETI operates, most peer companies offer moving\n       assistance. Such assistance is expected by employees, and ETI would be placed at a\n       competitive disadvantage if it did not offer relocation expenses.\n\n144.   ETI's relocation expenses were reasonable and necessary.\n\n145.   The company's requested operating expenses should be reduced by $40,620 to reflect the\n       removal of certain executive prerequisites proposed by Staff.\n\n146.   Staff properly adjusted the company's requested interest expense of$68,985 by removing\n       $25,938 from FERC account 431 (using the interest rate of 0.12 percent for calendar year\n       2012), leaving a recommended interest expense of $43,047.\n\n147.   During the test-year, ETI's property tax expense equaled $23,708,829.\n\n148.   ETI requested an upward proforma adjustment of $2,592,420, to account for the property\n       tax expenses ETI estimates it will pay in the rate-year.\n\n149.   ETI's requested proforma adjustment is not reasonable because it is based, in part, upon\n       the prediction that ETI's property tax rate will be increased in 2012, a change that is\n       speculative is not known and measurable.\n\n150.   Staff's recommendation to increase ETI's test-year property tax expenses by $1,214,688\n       is based on the historical effective tax rate applied to the known test-year-end plant in\n       service value, consistent with Commission precedent, and based upon known and\n       measurable changes.\n\n151.   ETI's test-year property tax burden should be adjusted upward by $1,222,106 for a total\n       expense of $24,921,022.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                        Order on Rehearing                          Page 27 or44\nSOAH Docket N o . -\n\n\n152.    Staff recommended reducing ETI's advertising, dues, and contributions expenses by\n       $12,800. The recommendation, which no party contested, should be adopted.\n\n153.   The final cost of service should reflect changes to cost of service that affect other\n       components of the revenue requirement such as the calculation of the Texas state gross\n        receipts tax, the local gross receipts tax, the PUC Assessment Tax and the Uncollectible\n        Expenses.\n\n154.    The company's requested Federal income tax expense is reasonable and necessary.\n\n155.    ETI's request for $2,019,000 to be included in its cost of service to account for the\n        company' s annual decommissioning expenses associated with River Bend is not\n        reasonable because it is not based upon \"the most current information reasonably\n        available regarding the cost of decommissioning\" as required by P.U.C. SuesT.\n        R. 25.231(b)(l)(F)(i).\n\n156.    Based on the most current information reasonably available, the appropriate level of\n        decommissioning costs to be included in ETI's cost of service is $1, 126,000.\n\n157.    ETI' s appropriate total annual self-insurance storm damage reserve expense is\n        $8,270,000, comprised of an annual accrual of $4,400,000 to provide for average annual\n        expected storm losses, plus an annual accrual of $3,870,000 for 20 years to restore the\n        reserve from its current deficit.\n\n158.    ETI' s appropriate target self-insurance storm damage reserve is $17,595,000.\n\n159.    ETI should continue recording its annual storm damage reserve accrual until modified by\n        a Commission order.\n\n160.    The operating costs of the Spindletop facility are reasonable and necessary.\n\n161.    The operating costs of the Spindletop facility paid to PB Energy Storage Services are\n        eligible fuel expenses.\n\nAffiliate Transactions\n162.    ETI affiliates charged ETI $78,998,777 for services during the test-year. The majority of\n        these O&M expenses- $69,098,041- were charged to ETI by ESL                The remaining\n        affiliate services were charged (or credited) to ETI by: Entergy Gulf States Louisiana,\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                         Order on Rehearing                         Page 28 of 44\nSOAH Docket No.\n\n\n       L.L.C.; Entergy Arkansas, Inc.; Entergy Louisiana, LLC; Entergy Mississippi, Inc.;\n       Entergy Operations, Inc.; and non-regulated affiliates.\n\n163.   ESI follows a number of processes to ensure that affiliate charges are reasonable and\n       necessary and that ETI and its affiliates are charged the same rate for similar services.\n       These processes include: (a) the use of service agreements to define the level of service\n       required and the cost of those services; (b) direct billing of affiliate expenses where\n       possible; (c) reasonable allocation methodologies for costs that cannot be directly billed;\n       (d) budgeting processes and controls to provide budgeted costs that are reasonable and\n       necessary to ensure appropriate levels of service to its customers; and (e) oversight\n       controls by ETI's Affiliate Accounting and Allocations Department.\n\n164.   Affiliates charged expenses to ETI through 1292 project codes during the test-year.\n\nl 64A. The $2,086, 145 in affiliate transactions related to sales and marketing expenses should be\n       reallocated using direct assignment. The following amounts should be allocated to all\n       retail classes in proportion to number of customers:                ( I) $46,490 for Project\n       EIOPCR56224 - Sales and Marketing - EGSI Texas; (2) $ 17,013 for Project\n       F3PCD10049 - Regulated Retail Systems O&M; and (3) $30,167 for Project\n       F3PPMMALI2 - Middle Market Mkt. Development. The remainder, $1 ,992,475, should\n       be assigned to ( 1) General Service, (2) Large General Service and (3) Large Industrial\n       Power Service.\n\n165.   ETI agreed to remove the following affiliate transactions from its application:\n       ( I) Project F3PPCASHCT (Contractual Alternative/Cashpo) in the amount of $2,553;\n       (2) Project F3 PCS PETE I (Entergy-Tulane Energy Institute) in the amount of $14,288;\n       and (3) Project F5PPKATRPT (Stonn Cost Processing & Review) in the amount of $929.\n\n166.   The $356,151 (which figure includes the $112,53 1 agreed to by ETI) of costs associated\n       with Projects F5PCZUBENQ (Non-Qualified Post Retirement) and F5PPZNQBDU (Non\n       Qual Pension/Benf Dom Utl) are costs that are not reasonable and necessary for the\n       provision of electric utility service and are not in the public interest.\n\n167.   The $10,279 of costs associated with Project F3PPFXERSP (Evaluated Receipts\n       Settlement) are not nonnally-recurring costs and should not be recoverable.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                         Order on Rehearing                         Page 29 of44\nSOAH Docket N o . -\n\n\n168.   The $19,714 of costs associated with Project F3PPEASTIN (Willard Eastin et al) are\n        related to ESl's operations, it is more immediately related to Entergy Louisiana, Inc. and\n        Entergy New Orleans, Inc. As such, they are not recoverable from Texas ratepayers.'\n\n169.   The $171,032 of costs associated with Project F3PPE9981S (Integrated Energy\n        Management for ESI) are research and development costs related to energy efficiency\n        programs. As such, they should be recovered through the energy efficiency cost recovery\n        factor rather than base rates.\n\n170.    Except as noted in the above findings of fact Nos. 162-169, all remaining affiliate\n        transactions were reasonable and necessary, were allowable, were charged to ETI at a\n        price no higher than was charged by the supplying affiliate to other affiliates, and the rate\n        charged is a reasonable approximation of the cost of providing service.\n\nJurisdictional Cost Allocation\n171.    ETI has one full or partial requirements wholesale customer - East Texas Electric\n        Cooperative, Inc.\n\n172.    ETI proposes that 150 MW be set as the wholesale load for developing retail rates in this\n        docket. Using 150 MW to set the wholesale load is reasonable. The 150 MW used to set\n        the wholesale load results in a retail production demand allocation factor of\n        95.3838 percent.\n\n173.    The 12 Coincident Peak (12 CP) allocation method is consistent with the approach used\n        by the FERC to allocate between jurisdictions.\n\n174.    Using l 2CP methodology to allocate production costs between the wholesale and retail\n       jurisdictions is the best method to reflect cost responsibility and is appropriate based on\n        ETI's reliance on capacity purchases.\n\nClass Cost Allocg/ion and Rate Design\n175.   There is no express statutory authorization for ETI's proposed Renewable Energy Credits\n       rider (REC rider).\n\n176.   REC rider constitutes improper piecemeal ratemaking and should be rejected.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                            Order on Rehearing                      Page JO of 44\nSOAH Docket No.\n\n\n177.   ETI's test-year expense for renewable energy credits, $623,303, is reasonable and\n       necessary and should be included in base rates.\n\n178.   Municipal Franchise Fees (MFF) is a rental expense paid by utilities for the right to use\n       public rights-of-way to locate its facilities within municipal limits.\n\n179.   ETI is an integrated utility system.         ETI's facilities located within municipal limits\n       benefit all customers, whether the customers are located inside or outside of the\n       municipal limits.\n\n180.   Because all customers benefit from ETI' s rental of municipal right-of-way, municipal\n       franchise fees should be charged to all customers in ETI's service area, regardless of\n       geographic location.\n\n181.   It is reasonable and consistent with the Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA)\n       § 33.008(b) that MFF be allocated to each customer class on the basis of in-city kilowatt\n       hour (kWh) sales, without an adjustment for the MFF rate in the municipality in which a\n       given kWh sale occurred.\n\n182.   The same reasons for allocating and collecting MFF as set out in Finding of Fact\n       Nos. 178-181 also apply to the allocation and collection of Miscellaneous Gross Receipts\n       Taxes. The company's proposed allocation of these costs to all retail customer classes\n       based on customer class revenues relative to total revenues is appropriate.\n\n182A. ETI's proposed gross plant-based allocator is an appropriate method for allocating the\n       Texas franchise tax.\n\n183.   The Average and Excess ( A&E) 4CP method for allocating capacity-related production\n       costs, including reserve equalization payments, to the retail classes is a standard\n       methodology and the most reasonable methodology.\n\n184.   The A&E 4CP method for allocating transmission costs to the retail classes is standard\n       and the most reasonable methodology.\n\n185.   ETI appropriately followed the rate class revenue requirements from its cost of service\n       study to allocate costs among customer classes. ETl's revenue allocation properly sets\n       rates at each class's cost of service.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                          Order on Rehearing                         PageJI of44\nSOAH Docket No. -\n\n\n186.    It is reasonable for ETI to eliminate the service condition for Rate Groups A and C in\n        Schedule SHL [Street and Highway Lighting Service] that charges a $50 fee for any\n        replacement of a functioning light with a lower-wattage bulb.\n\n187.    It is appropriate to require ETI to prepare and fil e, as part of its next base rate case, a\n        study regarding the foasi bil ity of instituting LED-based rates and, if the study shows that\n        such rates are feasible, ETI should file proposals for LED-based lighting and traffic\n        signal rates in its next rate case.\n\n188.    An agreement was reached by the parties and approved by the Commission in Docket\n        No. 37744 that directed ETI to exclude, in its next rate case, the life-of-contract demand\n        ratchet for existing customers in the Large Industrial Power Service (LI PS), Large\n        Industrial Power Service-Time of Day, General Service, General Service-Time of Day,\n        Large General Service, and Large General Service-Time of Day rate schedules.\n\n189.    ETI's proposed tariffs in this case did not remove the life-of -contract demand ratchet\n        from these rate schedules consistent with the parties' agreement in Docket No. 37744.\n\n190.    A perpetual billing obl igation based on a life-of-contract demand ratchet, as ETI\n        proposed, is not reasonable.\n\n19 1.   ETI's proposed LIPS and LIPS Time of Day tariffs should be modified to reflect the\n        agreement that was adopted by the Commission as just and reasonable in Docket\n        No. 37744. Accordingly, these tariffs should be modified as set out in Findings of Fact\n        No. 192-1 94.\n\nl 92.   ETI's Schedule LIPS and LIPS Time of Day§ Vl should be changed to read:\n                        DETERMINATION OF BILLING LOAD\n\n                        The kW of Billing Load will be the greatest of the fo llowing:\n\n                        {A) The Customer's maximum measured 30-minute\n                        demand during any 30-minute interval of the current billing\n                        month, subject to §§ Ill , IV and V above; or\n\n                         (B) 75% of Contract Power as defined in § Vil; or\n\n                        (C) 2,500 kW.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                        Order on Rehearing                         Page 32 of44\nSOAH Docket No.\n\n\n193.   ETl's Schedule LIPS and LIPS Time of Day§ VU should be changed to read:\n                       DETERMINATION OF CONTRACT POWER\n\n                       Unless Company gives customer written notice to the contrary,\n                       Contract Power will be defined as below:\n\n                       Contract Power - the highest load established under § VI(A) above\n                       during the 12 months ending with the current month. For the\n                       initial 12 months of Customer's service under the currently\n                       effective contract, the Contract Power shall be the kW specified in\n                       the currently effective contract unless exceeded in any month\n                       during the initial 12-month period.\n\n194.   The Large General Service, Large General Service-Time of Day, General Service, and\n       General Service-Time of Day schedules should be similarly revised to eliminate ETI's\n       life-of-contract demand ratchet.\n\n195.   In its proposed rate design for the LIPS class, the company took a conservative approach\n       and increased the current rates by an equal percentage. This minimized customer bill\n       impacts while maintaining cost causation principles on a rate class basis.\n\n196.   It is a reasonable move towards cost of service to add a customer charge of $630 to the\n       LIPS rate schedule with subsequent increases to be considered in subsequent base rate\n       cases.\n\n197.   It is a reasonable move towards cost of service to slightly decrease the LIPS energy\n       charges   and    increase   the    demand   charges   as   proposed    by    Staff   witness\n       William B. Abbott.\n\n198.   DOE proposed a new Schedule LIPS rider-Schedule \"Schedulable Intermittent\n       Pumping Service\" (SIPS) for load schedulable at least four weeks in advance, that occurs\n       in the off-season (October through May), that can be cancelled at any time, and for load\n       not lasting more than 80 hours in a year. For customers whose loads match these SIPS\n       characteristics (for example, DOE's Strategic Petroleum Reserve), the 12-month demand\n       ratchet provision of Schedule LIPS does not apply to demands set under the provisions of\n       the SCPS rider. The monthly demand set under the SIPS provisions would be applicable\n       for billing purposes only in the month in which it occurred. In short, if a customer set a\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                       Ortler on Rehearing                       Page 33 of 44\nSOAH Docket No. -\n\n\n       12-month ratchet demand in that month, it would be forgiven and not applicable in the\n       succeeding 12 months.\n\n199.   DOE's proposed Schedule SIPS ts not restricted solely to the DOE and should be\n       adopted. It more closely addresses specific customer characteristics and provides for\n       cost-based rates, as does another ETI rider applicable to Pipeline Pumping Service.\n\n200.   Standby Maintenance Service (SMS) is available to customers who have their own\n       generation equipment and who contract for this service from ETI.\n\n201.   P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.242(k)(l) provides that rates for sales of standby and maintenance\n       power to qualifying faci lities should recognize system wide costing principles and should\n       not be discriminatory.\n\n202.   It is reasonable to move Schedule SMS toward cost of service by: (a) adding a customer\n       charge equivalent to that of the LIPS rate schedule only for SMS customers not\n       purchasing supplementary power under another applicable rate; and (b) revising the tariff\n       as follows:\n                                       Distribution         Transmission\n                         Charge\n                                    (less than 69KV)     (69KV and greater)\n                       Billing Load Charge ($/kW):\n                       Standby            $2.46                  $0.79\n                       Maintenance        $2.27                  $0.60\n                       Non-Fuel Ener!!v Charge (¢/kWh)\n                       On-Peak           4.245¢                  4.074¢\n                       Off-Peak          0.575¢                  0.552¢\n\n\n203.   ETI's Additional Facilities Charge rider (Schedule AFC) prescribes the monthly rental\n       charge paid by a customer when ETI installs faci lities for that customer that would not\n       normally be supplied, such as line extensions, transformers, or dual feeds.\n\n204.   ETI existing Schedule AFC provides two pricing options. Option A is a monthly charge.\n       Option B, which applies when a customer elects to amortize the directly-assigned\n       facil ities over a shorter term ranging from one to ten years, has a variable monthly\n       charge.   There is also a term charge that applies after the faci lity has been fully\n       depreciated.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                         Order on Rehearing                          Page 34 of 44\nSOAH Docket No.-\n\n\n205.    It is reasonable and cost-based to reduce the Schedule AFC Option A rate to 1.11 percent\n        per month of the installed cost of all facilities included in the agreement for additional\n        facilities.\n\n206.    It is reasonable and cost-based to reduce the Schedule AFC Option B monthly rate and\n        the Post Term Recovery Charge as follows:\n\n        Selected Recovery Term      Recovery Term Charge       Post Recovery Term Charge\n                      1                      9.52%                        0.28%\n                      2                      5. 14%                       0.28%\n                      3                      3.68%                        0.28%\n                      4                      2.95%                        0.28%\n                      5                      2.52%                        0.28%\n                      6                      2.23%                        0.28%\n                      7                      2.03%                        0.28%\n                      8                      1.88%                        0.28%\n                      9                      1.76%                        0.28%\n                      10                     1.67%                        0.28%\n\n\n207.    The revisions in the above findings of fact to Schedule AFC rates reasonably reflect the\n        costs of running, operating, and maintaining the directly-assigned facilities.\n\n208.    It is reasonable to modify the Large General Service rate schedule by increasing the\n        demand charge from $8.56 to $11.43; decreasing the energy charge from $.00854 to\n        $.00458; and reducing the customer charge to $260.00.\n\n209.    Staff's proposed change to the General Service (GS) rate schedule to gradually move GS\n        customers towards their cost of service by recommending a decrease in the customer\n        charge from the current rate of $41.09 to $39.91, and a decrease in the energy charges is\n        reasonable and should be adopted.\n\n2 10.   ETI's Residential Service (RS) rate schedule is composed of two elements: a customer\n        charge and a consumption-based energy charge. In the months November through April\n        (winter), the rates are structured as a declining block, in which the price of each unit is\n        reduced after a defined level of usage. ETI's proposed increase in the RS customer\n        charge to $6 per month is reasonable and should be adopted. For the RS summer rate and\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                             Order on Rehearing                     Page 35 of 44\nSOAH Docket No. -\n\n\n         the first winter block rate, the 6.296¢ per kWh energy charge resulting from the increased\n         revenue requirement fo r residential customers is reasonable and should be adopted.\n\n2 11 .   ETI's Schedule RS declining block rate structure is contrary to energy-efficiency efforts\n         and   ~he   Legislature's goal of reducing both energy demand and energy consumption in\n         Texas, as stated in PURA § 39.905.\n\n2 12.    Schedule RS winter block rates should be modified consistent with the goal set out in\n         PURA § 39.905, with the initial phase-in of a 20 percent reduction in the block\n         differential proposed by ETI and subsequent reductions should be reviewed for\n         consideration at the occurrence of each rate case filing.\n\n213.     Other elements of Schedule RS are just and reasonable.\n\nFuel Rec1mci/iation\n2 14.    ETI incurred $616,248 ,686 in natural-gas expenses during the reconciliation period,\n         which is from July 2009 through June 2011.\n\n215.     ETI purchased natural gas in the monthly and daily markets and pursuant to a long-term\n         contract with Enbridge Inc. pipeline. ETI also transported gas on its own account and\n         negotiated operational balancing agreements with various pipeline companies.\n\n2 16.    ETI employed a diversified portfolio of gas supply and transportation agreements to meet\n         its natural-gas requirements, and ETI prudently managed its gas-supply contracts.\n\n217.     ETI' s natural gas expenses were reasonable and necessary expenses incurred to provide\n         reliable electric service to retail customers.\n\n2 18.    ETI incurred $90,82 1,317 in coal expenses during the reconciliation period.\n\n219.     ETI prudently managed its coal and coal-related contracts during the reconciliation\n         period.\n\n220.     ETI monitored and audited coal invoices from Louisiana Generating, LLC for coal\n         burned at the Big Cajun II, Unit 3 facility.\n\n22 l.    ETI's coal expenses were reasonable and necessary expenses incurred to provide reliable\n         electric service to retail customers.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                          Order on Rehearing                       Page36 of 44\nSOAH C>ocket N o . -\n\n\n222.    ETI incurred $990,04 1,434 in purchased-energy expenses during the reconciliation\n        period.\n\n223.    The Entergy System's planning and procurement processes for purchased-power\n        produced a reasonable mix of purchased resources at a reasonable price.\n\n224.    During the reconciliation period, ETI took advantage of opportunities in the fuel and\n        purchased-power markets to reduce costs and to mitigate against price volatility.\n\n225.    ETI' s purchased-energy expenses were reasonable and necessary expenses incurred to\n        provide reliable electric service to retail customers.\n\n226.    ETI provided sufficient contemporaneous documentation to support the reasonableness of\n        its purchased-power planning and procurement processes and its actual power purchases\n        during the reconciliation period.\n\n227.    The Entergy system sold power off system when the revenues were expected to be more\n        than the incremental cost of supplying generation for the sale, subject to maintaining\n        adequate reserves.\n\n228.    The System Agreement is the tariff approved by the FERC that provides the basis for the\n        operation and planning of the Entergy system, including the six operating companies.\n        The System Agreement governs the wholesale-power transactions among the operating\n        companies by providing for joint operation and establishing the bases for equalization\n        among the operating companies, including the costs associated with the construction,\n        ownership, and operation of the Entergy system facilities.\n\n229.    Under the terms of the Entergy System Agreement, ETJ was allocated its share of\n        revenues and expenses from off-system sales.\n\n230.    During the reconciliation period, ETI recorded off-system sales revenue in the amount of\n        $376,671 ,969 in FERC Account 447 and credited 100 percent of off-system sales\n        revenues and margins from off-system sales to eligible fuel expenses.\n\n23 1.   ETI properly recorded revenues from off-system sales and credited those revenues to\n        eligible fuel costs.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                        Order on Rehearing                         Page 37 of 44\nSOAH Docket No.-\n\n\n232.   The Entergy system consists of six operating companies, including ETI, which are\n       planned and operated as a single, integrated electric system under the tenns of the System\n       Agreement.\n\n233.   Service schedule MSS-1 of the System Agreement detennines how the capabi lity and\n       ownership costs of reserves for the Entergy system are equalized among the operating\n       companies.      These inter-system \"reserve equalization\" payments are the result of a\n       fonnula rate related to the Entergy system's reserve capability that is applied on a\n       monthly basis.\n\n234.   Reserve capability under service schedule MSS- 1 is capability in excess of the Entergy\n       system's actual or planned load built or acquired to ensure the reliable, efficient operation\n       of the electric system.\n\n235.   By approving service schedule MSS-1 , the FERC has approved the method by which the\n       operating companies share the cost of maintaining sufficient reserves to provide\n       reliability for the Entergy system as a whole.\n\n236.   Service schedule MSS-3 of the System Agreement detennines the pricing and exchange\n       of energy among the operating companies. By approving service schedule MSS-3, the\n       FERC has approved the method by which the operating companies are reimbursed for\n       energy sold to the exchange energy pool and how that energy is purchased.\n\n237.   Service schedule MSS-4 of the System Agreement sets forth the method for determining\n       the payment for unit power purchases between operating companies.             By approving\n       service schedule MSS-4, the FERC has approved the methodology for pricing\n       inter-operating company unit power purchases.\n\n238.   The Entergy system is planned using multi-year, annual, seasonal, monthly, and next-day\n       horizons. Once the planning process has identified the most economical resources that\n       can be used to reliably meet the aggregate Entergy system demand, the next step is to\n       procure the fuel necessary to operate the generating units as planned and acquire\n       wholesale power from the market.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                          Order on Rehearing                      Page 38 of 44\nSOAH Docket No.\n\n\n239.   Once resources are procured to meet forecasted load, the Entergy system is operated\n       during the current day using all the resources available to meet the total Entergy system\n       demand.\n\n240.   After current-day operation, the System Agreement prescribes an accounting protocol to\n       bill the costs of operating the system to the individual operating companies. This\n       protocol is implemented via the intra-system bill to each operating company on a\n       monthly basis.\n\n241.   ETI purchased power from affiliated operating companies per the terms of service\n       schedule MSS-3 of the System Agreement. The payments made under Schedule MSS-3\n       to affiliated operating companies are reasonable and necessary, and the FERC has\n       approved the pricing formula and the obligation to purchase the energy. ETI pays the\n       same price per megawatt hour for energy under service schedule MSS-3 as does any\n       other operating company purchasing energy under service schedule MSS-3 during the\n       same hour.\n\n242.   The Spindletop facility is used primarily to ensure gas-supply reliability and guard\n       against gas-supply curtailments that can occur as a result of extreme weather or other\n       unusual events.\n\n243.   The Spindletop facility provides a secondary benefit of flexibility in gas supply. ETI can\n       back down gas-fired generation to take advantage of more economical wholesale power,\n       or use gas from storage to supplement gas-fired generation when load increases during\n       the day and thereby avoid more expensive intra-day gas purchases.\n\n244.   ETI's customers received benefits from the Spindletop facility during the reconciliation\n       period through reliable gas supplies and ETI's monthly and daily storage activity.\n\n245.   ETI prudently managed the Spindletop facility to provide reliability and flexibility of gas\n       supply for the benefit of customers.\n\n246.   ETI proposed new loss factors, based on a December 2010 line-loss study, to be applied\n       for the purpose of allocating its costs to its wholesale customers and retail customer\n       classes.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                             Order on Rehearing                     Page 39 of 44\nSOAH Docket N o . -\n\n\n246A. ETI 's 20 I 0 line-loss factors should be used to reconcile ETI's fuel costs. Therefore,\n        ETI 's fuel reconciliation over-recovery should be reduced by $3, 981,271.\n\n247.    ETl's proposed loss factors are reasonable and shall be implemented on a prospective\n        basis as a result of this final order.\n\n248.    ETI seeks a special-circumstances exception to recover $99,715 resulting from the\n        FERC's reallocation of rough production equalization costs in FERC Order No. 720-A,\n        and to treat such costs as eligible fuel expense.\n\n249.    Special circumstances exist and it is appropriate for ETI to_recover the rough production\n        cost equalization costs reallocated to ETI as a result of the FERC 's decision in Order\n        No. 720-A.\n\nOt/1er Issues\n250.    A deferred accounting of ETI' s Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator\n        (MISO) transition expenses is not necessary to carry out any requirement of PURA.\n\n251.    ETI should include $1.6 million in base rates for MISO transition expense.\n\n252.    Deleted.\n\n253.    Transmission Cost Recovery Factor basel ine values should be set during the compliance\n        phase of this docket, after the Commission makes final rulings on the various contested\n        issues that may affect this calculation.\n\n254.    Distribution Cost Recovery Factor baseline values should be set during the compliance\n        phase of this docket, after the Commission makes final rulings on the various contested\n        issues that may affect this calculation.\n\n255.    The appropriate amount for ETI's purchased-power capacity expense to be included in\n        base rates is $245,965,886.\n\n256.    The amount of ETI's purchased-power capacity expense includes third-party contracts,\n        legacy affiliate contracts, other affiliate contracts, and reserve equalization. Whether the\n        amounts for all contracts should be included in the baseline for a purchased-capacity rider\n        that may be approved in Project No. 39246 is an issue that should be decided in that\n        project.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                       Order on Rehearing                          Page 40 of 44\nSOAH Docket No.\n\n\n                                   III. Conclusions of Law\n1.     ETI is a \"public utility\" as that term is defined in PURA § 11.004(1) and an \"electric\n       utility\" as that term is defined in PURA§ 31.002(6).\n\n2.     The Commission exercises regulatory authority over ETI and jurisdiction over the subject\n       matter of this application pursuant to PURA§§ 14.001, 32.001 , 32.101, 33.002, 33.051,\n       36.101- .111, and 36.203.\n\n3.

Including the cash working capital approved in this proceeding in ETI's rate base is\n        consistent with P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.23 l (c)(2)(B)(iii)(IV), which allows a reasonable\n        allowance for cash working capital to be included in rate base.\n\n13.     The ROE and overall rate of return authorized in this proceeding a re consistent with the\n        requirements of PURA §§ 36.05 I and 36.052.\n\n14.     The affiliate expenses approved in this proceeding and included in ETl's rates meet the\n        affiliate payment standards articulated in PURA §§ 36.051, 36.058, and Railroad\n        Commission of Texas v. Rio Grande Valley Gas Co., 683 S.W.2d 783 (Tex. App.-\n        Austin 1984, no writ).\n\n15.     The ADFIT adjustments approved in this proceeding are consistent with PURA § 36.059\n        and P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.23 l (c)(2)(C)(i).\n\n16.     Pursuant to P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.231 (b)(I)(F), the decommissioning expense approved in\n        this case is based on the most current information reasonably available regarding the cost\n        of decommissioning, the balance of funds in the decommissioning trust, anticipated\n        escalation rates, the anticipated return on the funds in the decommissioning trust, and\n        other relevant factors.\n\n17.     ETI has demonstrated that its eligible fuel expenses during the reconciliation period were\n        reasonable and necessary expenses incurred to provide reliable electric service to retail\n        customers as required by P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.236(d)(l)(A). ETI has properly accounted\n        for the amount of fuel-related revenues collected pursuant to the fuel factor during the\n        reconciliation period as required by P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.236(d)(l)(C).\n\n18.     ETI prudently managed the dispatch, operations, and maintenance of its fossil plants\n        during the reconciliation period.\n\n19.

INTRODUCTION [Germane to Preliminary Order Issue Nos. 1 and 4]\n\n        Entergy Texas, Inc. (ETI or the Company) is an investor-owned electric utility with a retail\nservice area located in southeastern Texas. ETI serves retail and wholesale electric customers in\nTexas. As of June 30, 2011, ETI served approximately 412,000 Texas retail customers. The Federal\nEnergy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulates ETI's wholesale electric operations.\n\n\n        On November 28, 2011, ETI filed an application requesting approval of: (1) a proposed\nincrease in annual base rate revenues of approximately $111.8 million over adjusted revenues for the\nperiod beginning July l, 2010, and ending June 30, 2011 (Test Year); (2) a set of proposed tariff\nschedules presented in the Electric Utility Rate Filing Package for Generating Utilities accompanying\nETI' s application and including new riders for recovery of costs related to purchased power capacity\nand renewable energy credit requirements; (3) a request for final reconciliation of ETI's fuel and\npurchased power costs for the reconciliation period from July 1, 2009, to June 30, 2011\n(Reconciliation Period); and (4) certain waivers to the instructions in Rate Filing Package\nSchedule V accompanying ETI's application. The rate year for ETI's proposed changes is June 1,\n2012, through May 31, 2013 (Rate Year). 1 On April 13, 2012, adjusted its request for a proposed\nincrease in annual base rate revenues to approximately $104.8 million over adjusted Test Year\nrevenues.\n\n\n1\n   During the hearing the parties used the term \"Rate Year\" to refer to the period June 2012 through May\n2013. This was intended to represent the first 12 months of the rates adopted in this case. However, the rates\nin this case will not go into effect (as temporary rates) until at least June 30, 2012. Nevertheless, for purposes\nof this PFD, Rate Year will refer to the period June 2012 through May 2013.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                  PAGE2\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n                               II.     JURISDICTION AND NOTICE\n\n          The Public Utility Commission of Texas (Commission or PUC) has jurisdiction over ETI and\nthis rate case application pursuant to Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA) §§ 14.001, 32.001,\n33.002, and 35.004. The State Office of Administrative Hearings (SOAH) has jurisdiction over the\ncontested case hearing, including the preparation of the proposal for decision (PFD) pursuant to\nPURA§ 14.053 and Tex. Gov'tCode§ 2003.049(b). Those municipalities inETI's service areathat\nhave not surrendered jurisdiction to the Commission continue to have exclusive original jurisdiction\nover ETI' s rates, operations, and services in their respective municipalities pursuant to PURA\n§ 33.001. When ETI filed its application with the Commission, it also filed the application with its\noriginal jurisdiction cities. Pursuant to PURA§§ 32.00l(b), 33.051, and 33.053, ETI appealed the\nactions of the original jurisdiction cities to the Commission and had those appeals consolidated with\nthis docket.\n\n\n          ETI' s notice of its application and notice of the hearing were not contested and, therefore, do\nnot require further discussion but will be addressed in the proposed findings of fact and conclusions\nof law.\n\n\n                                III.    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n          As noted above, ETI filed its application and rate filing package on November 28, 2011. On\nNovember 29, 2011, the Commission referred this proceeding to SOAH. On December 19, 2011,\nthe Commission issued its Preliminary Order setting forth 31 issues to be addressed in this\nproceeding. On January 19, 2012, the Commission issued a Supplemental Preliminary Order listing\ntwo additional issues to be considered and stating that ETI' s request for a purchased power cost\nrecovery rider should not be addressed in this docket.\n\n\n          On September 2, 2011, ETI filed an application requesting authority to defer accounting\nrelated to its proposed transition to membership in the Midwest Independent Transmission System\nOperator, Inc. (MISO). This proceeding was docketed as Docket No. 39741. On November 22,\n2011, the Commission issued its Preliminary Order in Docket No. 39741 addressing certain\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                  PAGE3\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nthreshold legal/policy questions and setting forth nine issues to be addressed in the proceeding. On\nDecember 20, 2011, Docket No. 39741 was consolidated into this docket for all purposes.\n\n\n        The following entities were granted intervenor status in this case: Texas Industrial Energy\nConsumers (TIEC); State of Texas State Agencies (State Agencies); Office of Public Utility Counsel\n(OPC); the Cities of Anahuac, Beaumont, Bridge City, Cleveland, Conroe, Dayton, Groves, Houston,\nHuntsville, Montgomery, Navasota, Nederland, Oak Ridge North, Orange, Pine Forest, Rose City,\nPinehurst, Port Arthur, Port Neches, Shenandoah, Silsbee, Sour Lake, Splendora, Vidor, and West\nOrange (Cities); The Kroger Co.

Arnold, and Hunter Burkhalter on April 24, 2012, and continued\nthrough May 4, 2012. The record remained open for the filing of post-hearing briefs and proposed\nfinds of fact and conclusions of law. On June 8, 2012, the parties filed proposed finds of fact and\nconclusions of law and the record closed. As permitted byP.U.C. PROC. R. 22.261(a), AU Lilo D.\nPomerleau read the record and joined in writing the PFD. Number running began on June 26, 2012,\nand Staff returned the final numbers to the AU s on July 3, 2012. The parties requested that the AUs\nsubmit their PFD so the Commission could consider the matter at its July 27, 2012, open meeting.\n\n\n        The following is a list of the parties who participated in the hearing and their counsel:\n\n\n     PARTIES                       REPRESENTATIVES\n     ETI                           Steven H.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n       ETI proposed an overall increase of approximately $104.8 million. The AUs recommend an\noverall rate increase for ETI of $16.4 million, as shown on the schedules attached to this PFD. With\nrespect to ETI' s request to reconcile fuel and purchased power costs during the Reconciliation\nPeriod, the AU s recommend approval without change. Attachment A contains the schedules\nprovided by Commission Staff reflecting the ALls' recommendations. On issues of particular\nsignificance, the AUs' recommendations are set forth below.\n\n\nA.     Rate Base\n\n       1. Capital Investment\n\n       ETI's capital additions closed to plant in service between July 1, 2009, and June 30, 2011,\nwere prudently incurred and are used and useful in providing service to ETI's customers.\n\n\n       2. Hurricane Rita Regulatory Asset\n\n       The appropriate calculation of the Hurricane Rita regulatory asset should begin with the\namount claimed by ETI in Docket No. 37744,3 less amortization accruals to the end of the Test Year\nin the present case, and less the amount of additional insurance proceeds received by ETI after the\nconclusion of Docket No. 37744. This produces a remaining balance of$15,175,563, which should\nremain in rate base as a regulatory asset, applying a five-year amortization rate that commenced\nAugust 15, 2010. Further, the Hurricane Rita regulatory asset should not be moved to the storm\ninsurance reserve.\n\n\n3\n  Application of Entergy Texas, Inc. for Authority to Change Rates and Reconcile Fuel Costs, Docket\nNo. 37744 (Dec. 13, 2010).\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                    PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGES\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n       3. Prepaid Pension Asset Balance\n\n       The construction work in progress (CWIP)-related portion of ETI's pension asset\n($25,311,236 out of the total asset) should be excluded from the asset, but accrue allowance for\nfunds used during construction.\n\n\n       4. FIN 48 Tax Adjustment\n\n       The Commission should find that $4,621,778 (representing ETI's full FIN 48 Liability of\n$5,916,461 less the $1,294,683 cash deposit ETI has made with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)\nfor the FIN 48 Liability) should be added to ETI's ADFIT and thus be used toreduceETI'srate base.\n\n\n       5. Cash Working Capital\n\n       The AU s recommend no changes to ETI' s cash working capital.\n\n\n       6. Self-Insurance Storm Reserve\n\n       The Commission should approve ETI' s Test Year-end storm reserve balance of negative\n$59,799,744.\n\n\n       7. Coal Inventory\n\n       The full value of ETI's coal inventory was reasonable and should be included in rate base.\n\n\n       8. Spindletop Gas Storage Facility\n\n       The Spindletop Gas Storage Facility (Spindletop Facility) is a used and useful facility\nproviding reliability and swing flexibility to ETI' s customers at a reasonable price and should be\nincluded in rate base.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                     PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE6\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n        9. Short Term Assets\n\n        The ALls recommend Staffs proposal to include the following amounts in rate base:\nprepayments at $8,134,351 ($916,313 more than ETI's request); materials and supplies at\n$29,285,421 ($32,847 more than ETI's request); and fuel inventory at $52,693,485 ($1,066,490 less\nthan ETI' s request).\n\n\n        10. Acquisition Adjustment\n\n        The $1,127, 778 incurred by ETI in internal acquisition costs associated with the purchase of\nthe Spindletop Facility was reasonable, necessary, properly incurred, and should be included in rate\nbase.\n\n\n        11. Capitalized Incentive Compensation\n\n        The Test Year for ETI' s prior ratemak:ing proceeding ended on June 30, 2009. The\nreasonableness ofETI's capital costs (including capitalized incentive compensation) was dealt with\nby the Commission in that proceeding and is not at issue here. Thus, exclusion of capitalized\nincentive compensation that is financially-based can only be made for incentive costs that ETI\ncapitalized during the period from July 1, 2009 (the end of the prior Test Year) through June 30,\n2010 (the commencement of the current Test Year).\n\n\nB.      Rate of Return and Capital Structure\n\n        The ALls recommend a return on equity (ROE) of 9.80 percent; a cost of debt of\n6. 74 percent; a capital structure comprised of 50.08 percent debt and 49 .92 percent common equity;\nand an overall rate of return of 8.27 percent. This is a downward adjustment to ETI' s request for a\n10.60 percent ROE, and no change to ETI's 6.74 percent cost of debt and 50.08/49.92 capital\nstructure. It compares to Staffs proposed 9.60 percent ROE; OPC's proposed 9.30 percent ROE;\nTIEC's proposed 9.50 percent ROE; Cities' proposed 9.50 percent ROE; and State Agencies'\nproposed 9.30 percent ROE. No party opposed ETI's proposed 6.74 percent cost of debt or its\nproposed 50.08/49.92 capital structure.\n\fSOAHDOCKET N O . -                    PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE7\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nC.     Cost of Service\n\n       1. Purchased Power Capacity Expense\n\n       ETI's purchased power capacity costs should be set at the amount of the Company's Test\nYear level, which is $245,432,884.\n\n\n       2. Transmission Equalization (MSS-2) Expense\n\n       ETI should recover only the amount of expenses under Schedule MSS-2 of the Entergy\nSystem Agreement it paid in the Test Year, $1,753,797.\n\n\n       3. Depreciation Expense\n\n       The interim retirements methodology should not be adopted. The values proposed by ETI\nshould be adopted except for the following:\n\n\n       Service Lives:\n       Account 364-40 R 1.\n       Account 368-33 L0.5.\n\n       Net Salvage:\n       Production Plant- negative 5 percent.\n       Account 354-negative 5 percent\n       Account 361-negative 5 percent.\n       Account 362-negative 10 percent.\n       Account 368-negative 5 percent.\n       Account 369.1-negative 10 percent.\n       Account 369.2-negative 10 percent.\n\n\n       4. Labor Costs\n\n           »   Payroll and Related Aqjustments\n\n       The Commission should accept: (1) the payroll adjustments proposed in theETI application;\nand (2) the further payroll adjustments proposed by Staff as corrected by ETI.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                 PAGES\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n           >   Incentive Compensation\n\n       ETI should not be entitled to recover its financially based incentive compensation costs.\nThus, the AU s recommend removing $6, 196,03 7 from ETI' s requested operation and maintenance\n(O&M) expenses. Additionally, an additional reduction should be made to account for the FICA\ntaxes that ETI would have paid as a result of those costs.\n\n\n           >   Compensation and Benefit Levels\n\n       ETI met its burden to prove the reasonableness of its base pay and incentive package costs. It\nis reasonable to view market price for these categories of costs as lying within a range of +/-\n10 percent of median, rather than being a single point along a spectrum. As to both base pay and the\nincentive package, ETI has proven that its costs fall within such an acceptable range. Accordingly,\nthe AlJs recommend rejecting the adjustments sought by Cities.\n\n\n           >   Nonqualified Executive Retirement Benefits\n\n       The AlJs recommend an adjustment to remove $2,114,931, representing the full costs\nassociated with ETI' s non-qualified executive retirement benefits.\n\n\n           >   Employee Relocation Costs\n\n       The Commission should allow ETI' s relocation expenses.\n\n\n           >   Executive Perquisites\n\n       The AlJs recommend an adjustment to remove $40,620, representing the full cost of ETI' s\nexecutive perquisite costs.\n\n\n       5. Interest on Customer Deposits\n\n       The AlJs recommend using the active customer deposits amount of $35,872,476 and the\n2012 interest rate, which produces a recommended interest expense of $43,047 ($35,872,476\nmultiplied by .12 percent).\n\fSOAHDOCKET N O . -                      PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE9\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n       6. Property (Ad Valorem) Tax Expense\n\n       ETI's property tax burden should be adjusted upward by applying the effective tax rate of\n0.007435784 for the calendar year 2011 to the final, adopted Test Year-end plant in service value for\nETI.\n\n\n       7. Advertising, Dues, and Contributions\n\n       The AUs recommend an adjustment to remove $12,800 fromETI's costs of advertising, dues\nand contributions.\n\n\n       8. Other Revenue Related Adjustments\n\n       These amounts were determined through number running and are reflected in Attachment A.\n\n\n       9. Federal Income Tax\n\n       The Commission should adopt ETI' s proposal on federal income taxes.\n\n\n       10. River Bend Decommissioning Expense\n\n       ETI' s annual decommissioning revenue requirement should reflect the most current\ncalculation of $1,126,000. Therefore, an adjustment of $893,000 to the proforma cost of service is\nneeded to reflect the difference between the requested level for decommissioning costs of $2,019,000\nand the recommended level of $1,126,000.\n\n\n       11. Self-Insurance Storm Reserve Expense\n\n       The Commission should approve a total annual accrual of $8,270,000, comprised of an\nannual accrual of $4,400,000 to provide for average annual expected storm losses, plus an annual\naccrual of $3,870,000 for 20 years to restore the reserve from its current deficit. The ALls\nrecommend approval of ETI's proposed target reserve of $17,595,000. The Commission should\nrequire ETI to continue recording its annual accrual until modified by future Commission orders.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                     PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE 10\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n         12. Spindletop Gas Storage Facility\n\n         The AU s recommend inclusion of the costs of operating the Spindletop Facility as requested\nbyETI.\n\n\nD.       Affiliate Transactions\n\n         ETI agreed to remove the following affiliate transactions from its request, which the AU s\nrecommend be approved: (1) Project F3PPCASHCT (Contractual Altemative/Cashpo) in the\namount of $2,553; (2) Project F3PCSPETEI (Entergy-Tulane Energy Institute) in the amount of\n$14,288; and (3) Project F5PPKATRPT (Storm Cost Processing & Review) in the amount of $929.\nExcept as noted below, all remaining affiliate transactions should be approved.          The AU s\nrecommend that the following affiliate transactions not be included:\n\n\n                    $356,151 (which figure includes the $112,531 agreed to by ETI) of costs\n                    associated with Projects F5PCWBENQ (Non-Qualified Post Retirement)\n                    and F5PPZNQBDU (Non Qual Pension/Bent Dom Utl);\n\n                    $10,279 of costs associated with Project F3PPFXERSP (Evaluated\n                    Receipts Settlement);\n\n                    $19,714 of costs associated with Project F3PPEASTIN (Willard Eastin et\n                    al); and\n\n                    $171,032 of costs associated with Project F3PPE9981S (Integrated\n                    Energy Management for ESI).\n\nE.       Jurisdictional Cost Allocation\n\n         The AUs recommend the use of 12 Coincident Peak (12CP) to allocate capacity-related\nproduction costs between the retail and wholesale jurisdictions.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                     PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE 11\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nF.     Class Cost Allocation\n\n       1. Renewable Energy Credit Rider\n\n       The Commission should deny ETI' s request to institute a renewable energy credit rider, and\nthe Test Year expense of $623,303 should be used for setting rates in this case. Finally, the\nRenewable Portfolio Standard Calculation Opt-Out Credit Rider should be maintained, with an\nadjustment to the credit rates to reflect the Test Year data used to set ETI's base rates.\n\n\n       2. Class Cost Allocation\n\n       The parties generally agreed that ETI's cost-of-service study comported with accepted\nindustry practices, but some parties had issues with specific items discussed below.\n\n\n                    (a) Municipal Franchise Fees\n\n       Municipal franchise fees should be allocated on the basis of in-city kilowatt-hour (kWh)\nsales, without an adjustment for the municipal franchise fee rate in the municipality in which a given\nkWh sale occurred. The AUs recommend adoption of ETI's proposal to collect costs from all\ncustomers taking service from the system.\n\n\n                    (b) Miscellaneous Gross Receipts Tax\n\n       Similar to municipal franchise fees, miscellaneous gross receipts taxes should be allocated to\nthe rate classes according to ETI's cost of service study.\n\n\n                    (c) Capacity-Related Production Costs\n\n       The AUs recommend the use of Average and Excess 4 Coincident Peak (A&E 4CP) to\nallocate capacity-related production costs, as proposed by ETI. The AUs do not find sufficient\nsupport to allocate the reserve equalization payments differently than other capacity-related\nproduction costs.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE12\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n                   (d) Transmission Costs\n\n       ETI' s proposed methodology for allocation of transmission costs should be approved. A&E\n4CP is a well-accepted method for allocating such costs.\n\n\n       3. Revenue Allocation\n\n       Revenue allocation in this case should be based on each class's cost of service and consistent\nwith the AIJs' recommendations in the PFD that impact revenue allocation.\n\n\n       4. Rate Design\n\n                   (a) Lighting and Traffic Signal Schedules\n\n       ETI should be directed to perform a light emitting diode (LED) lighting cost study before\nsignificant changes are made to its lighting rates. The AlJ s further recommend that ETI conduct this\nstudy before filing its next rate case and provide the results of any completed study to Cities and\ninterested parties. The study should include detailed information regarding differences in the cost of\nserving LED and non-LED lighting customers, if ETI currently has LED lighting customers taking\nservice. ETI should modify the applicable tariffs to eliminate its fee for any replacement of a\nfunctioning light with a lower-wattage bulb.\n\n\n                   (b) Demand Ratchet\n\n       ETI's proposed Large Industrial Power Service (LIPS) tariff should be amended to include\nthe language proposed by DOE witness Etheridge.\n\n\n                   (c) Large Industrial Power Service\n\n       The AlJ s recommend the adoption of a $630 customer charge for this customer class, a slight\ndecrease in the LIPS energy charges, and an increase in the demand charges from current rates for\nthis class, as proposed by Staff witness Abbott.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                         PAGE 13\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n                   (d) Schedulable Intermittent Pumping Service\n\n       The Commission should adopt the Schedulable Intermittent Pumping Service rider proposed\nby DOE witness Etheridge.\n\n\n                   (e) Standby Maintenance Service\n\n       The Commission should adopt the changes to Schedule SMS recommended by TIEC, with\nthe exception of a $6,000 customer charge.

MISO Transition\n\n       The Commission should deny ETI's request for deferred accounting of its MISO transition\nexpenses to be incurred on or after January 1, 2011. However, the Commission should authorize ETI\nto include $2.4 million of MISO transition expense in base rates set in the present case, based on a\nfive-year amortization of $12 million in total projected expenses. Further, the Commission should\nauthorize ETI to include in base rates $52,800 in MISO transition expenses for the 2010 portion of\nthe Test Year expenses, plus $2.4 million for the post Test Year adjustment, for a total of\n$2,452,800.\n\n\n       V.

Hurricane Rita Regulatory Asset\n\n        Hurricane Rita struck the upper Texas coast in September 2005, causing extensive property\ndamage. In 2006, the Texas Legislature enacted PURA Chapter 39 to authorize electric utilities such\nas ETI to securitize the recovery of their reconstruction costs incurred as a result of Hurricane Rita.\nUnder the statute, the amount of reconstruction costs to be securitized had to be reduced by the\ninsurance proceeds and government grants received by a utility. If additional insurance or grant\nproceeds were received after the securitization order was approved, the Commission was required to\ntake those amounts into account in the utility's next base rate case. This was provided in\nSection 39.459(c) of PURA:\n\n\n        To the extent a utility subject to this subchapter receives insurance proceeds,\n        governmental grants, or any other source of funding that compensates it for hurricane\n        reconstruction costs, those amounts shall be used to reduce the utility's hurricane\n        reconstruction costs recoverable from customers. If the timing of a utility's receipt of\n        those amounts prevents their inclusion as a reduction to the hurricane reconstruction\n        costs that are securitized, the commission shall take those amounts into account in:\n\n                (1) the utility's next base rate proceeding; or\n                (2) any proceeding in which the commission considers hurricane\n                    reconstruction costs.\n\n        Docket No. 32907 was the proceeding for ETI to determine the amount of Hurricane Rita\nreconstruction costs that it could securitize, net of any proceeds received from insurance or\n                     5\ngovernment grants.       In that case, ETI asserted that it incurred $393,236,384 in Hurricane Rita\nreconstruction costs for its Texas Retail jurisdiction. The parties reached a settlement in that case,\nwhich set ETI's hurricane reconstruction expenses eligible for securitization at $381,236,384. In\naddition, ETI estimated that it would receive $65,700,000 in future insurance proceeds that, pursuant\n\n5\n  Application of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. for Determination of Hurricane Reconstruction Costs, Docket\nNo. 32907 (Dec. 1, 2006).\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                  PAGE16\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nto the settlement, was deducted from the amount to be securitized. The parties also agreed that after\nETI received all of its insurance payments, a true-up would occur to reflect the difference between\nthe $65,700,000 credited and the amount actually received. The settlement agreement provided that\nif ETI received more insurance payments than estimated, the excess payments would be passed\nthrough to ratepayers in the form of a rider; however, the agreement did not address how an under-\nrecovery by ETI would be handled. It turned out that ETI received only $46,013,904 in insurance\nproceeds,6 leaving a $19 ,686,096 under-recovery by ETI, which the parties refer to as Overestimated\nInsurance Proceeds. 7\n\n\n          Docket No. 37744 was ETI's next base rate case after Docket No. 32907. In Docket\nNo. 37744, ETI requested recovery of the Overestimated Insurance Proceeds by establishing a\nregulatory asset of $19,686,096, plus accrued carrying costs, to be amortized over five years. 8\nDocket No. 37744 also concluded by a black-box settlement, and neither the Stipulation and\nSettlement Agreement nor the Order entered by the Commission specifically addressed the proposed\nregulatory asset or any other recovery for Overestimated Insurance Proceeds.\n\n\n          In the present case, ETI has again sought approval of a regulatory asset to recover\n$26,229,627, for the balance of Overestimated Insurance Proceeds, plus carrying costs through\nJune 30, 2011. 9 Cities objected to the amount of ETI's request. They argue that this issue was\nresolved in Docket No. 37744 and that ETI should have been amortizing the asset since the\nconclusion of that case. Staff also argues that the issue was resolved in Docket No. 37744 and\nrequested that ETI' s request be denied entirely; or, alternatively, that it should be considered partially\namortized and accordingly reduced. ETI argues that the issue was not resolved in Docket No. 37744\nand that it should be allowed a full recovery in the present case. Alternatively, ETI argues that\nCities' proposed reduction was not calculated correctly.\n\n\n\n6\n    See Docket No. 32907, Final Order at FoF 27.

In addition, he argues that ETI should not have continued to accrue interest on\nthe balance that was added into rate base in that docket, because it would have then earned a rate of\nreturn. Therefore, Mr. Garrett's adjustment started with the balance of $25,278,210 that ETI\nrequested in Docket No. 37744. He reduced that balance by $9,479,329 for amortization between\nthe date rates went into effect in Docket No. 37744 and the date that rates will go into effect in the\ncurrent case (22.5 months). Mr. Garrett further reduced the remaining balance by $5,678,960 to\naccount for additional insurance proceeds received by ETI after Docket No. 37744. By Mr. Garrett's\ncalculations, this left a remaining balance of Overestimated Insurance Proceeds of $11,071,3 3 8. 10\nBoth Mr. Garrett and Cities witness Jacob Pous also recommended that this remaining balance not be\ncarried as a regulatory asset but, instead, be moved to the storm insurance reserve for recovery. 11 In\ntheir view, this would ensure that the remaining balance would be properly recovered.\n\n\n          In response to ETI's argument that the Hurricane Rita Regulatory Asset was not resolved in\nDocket No. 37744, Cities stress that Docket No. 37744 settled as a \"black box settlement.\" In\nCities' opinion, such a settlement should not be interpreted as changing the status quo unless\nexpressly stated in the settlement agreement or final order. Cities contend that the status quo in\nDocket No. 37744 was that ETI was authorized to recover its Over Estimated Insurance Proceeds,\nbecause recovery was authorized by PURA § 39 .459(c); recovery had been previously approved in\nDocket No. 32907; and no party objected to its recovery in Docket No. 37744. Therefore, Cities\nstate, the final order in Docket No. 37744 should be interpreted as authorizing ETI's requested\nrecovery of the Hurricane Rita Regulatory asset in the rates set in that docket. 12\n\n\n          Cities also disagree with ETI' s alternative argument that Mr. Garrett improperly calculated\nthe remaining balance of the asset by deducting an amount for insurance proceeds ETI received after\nDocket No. 37744 concluded. Cities state that Mr. Garrett's adjustment was correct because it began\n\n10\n     Cities Ex. 2 (Garrett Direct) at Exhibit MG2.3.\n11\n     Id.

In other words, Mr. Garret did not start with the balance claimed by ETI in the present\ncase, 13 so he correctly applied the amount, received after Docket No. 37744 to reduce the balance\n                              14\nclaimed in that docket.            According to Cities, Mr. Garrett began with the prior balance to properly\nreflect that no carrying charges would accrue on the balance after it was included in rate base and\nrecovered a return through rates. 15 Cities also dispute ETI' s argument that Mr. Garrett should not\nhave accounted for amortization occurring between the Test Year and the Rate Year as an \"invalid\n                                    16\npost-test year adjustment.''             In Cities' view, this was a valid known and measureable change that\nshould be taken into account. 17\n\n\n           Staff recommends that the Hurricane Rita Regulatory Asset be removed from rate base\nentirely. Staff witness Anna Givens stated that it is reasonable to assume that this asset was included\nas part of the settlement in Docket No. 37744. Accordingly, she stated that it is not appropriate for\nETI to request recovery of the same asset in the present docket.                    Therefore, Ms. Givens\nrecommended removal of the entire requested $26,229,627 Hurricane Rita regulatory asset from\nETI' s rate base. 18\n\n\n           Alternatively, Ms. Givens proposed that the Commission allow ETI a regulatory asset of\n$17,486,418, to be amortized over 40 months. Ms. Givens noted that higher rates from Docket\nNo. 37744 first went into effect on August 15, 2010; 19 therefore, at least one-third of the regulatory\nasset should have been amortized by the conclusion of the present case. Using ETI's updated\nhurricane regulatory asset request of $26,229 ,627, Ms. Givens recommended a decrease of one-third\nto ETI's request. This would equal an $8,743,209 reduction, resulting in her recommended\n\n\n13\n     Cities Initial Brief at 8.\n14\n     Cities Ex. 2B (Garrett Direct), Exhibit MG-2.3.\n15\n     Docket No. 32907, Final Order at FoF 28.\n16\n     ETI' s Initial Briefat 7.\n17\n     Cities' Reply Brief at 10-14.\n18\n     Staff Ex. l (Givens Direct) at 32-34.\n19\n     Docket No. 37744, Order, FoF 16 (Dec. 13, 2010).\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                               PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                   PAGE 19\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nregulatory asset of $17,486,418 ($26,229 ,627 - $8, 743,209). Ms. Givens also recommended that the\namortization period be decreased from 60 months to 40 months, which is the time remaining on\nETI's original Docket No. 37744 request. 20\n\n\n          ETI disagrees with Cities and Staff, and it argues that its total requested Hurricane Rita\nregulatory asset should be included in rate base in this case. First, it notes that no instruction in the\nStipulation and Settlement Agreement filed in Docket No. 37744 required ETI to begin amortizing\nthe asset or otherwise directed the treatment of the asset. Likewise, no Finding of Fact or Conclusion\nof Law in the agreed order entered in Docket No. 37744 authorized the proposed treatment of the\nasset. In contrast, ETI notes, the settlement in Docket No. 32907 does specifically address the\ntreatment of this asset, and it argues that its request to include the full Hurricane Rita regulatory asset\nin rate base in the present case is consistent with that settlement. In ETI's opinion, it has not\npreviously been authorized to establish the regulatory asset, it has not amortized it, and the full\namount should be included in rate base in this case. 21\n\n\n          Alternatively, if Cities' proposed amortization is accepted, ETI argues that Mr. Garrett's\ncalculations were wrong. First, ETI states, Mr. Garrett incorrectly assumed that the $26,229,627\nHurricane Rita regulatory asset requested in this case did not account for the $5,678,960 of insurance\nproceeds that ETI received after Docket No. 37744. According to ETI, the $5,678,960 was\naccounted for, as shown on WP/P AJ 15.3. Therefore, ETI states, Mr. Garrett's adjustment for this\n$5.6 million would remove this amount from the asset a second time. 22 Second, ETI argues that\nMr. Garrett erred by amortizing the asset by 22.5 months. Mr. Garrett calculated the amortization\nperiod from the time rates went into effect after Docket No. 37744 (August 15, 2010) through the\ntime revised rates would go into effect in this docket (June 30, 2012). ETI states that Mr. Garrett\n\n\n20\n   Staff Ex. 1 (Givens Direct) at 34. Ms. Givens noted that amount recommended in Docket No. 37744 was\n$25,278,000, which is $951,627 less than the amount requested in the current proceeding. However, she stated\nthat this does not affect her recommendation, because by the time the hearing on the merits concluded, at least\nanother two months of amortization expense under the existing rates would be collected by the ETI and should\nadequately compensate it for the difference. Staff Ex. 1 (Givens Direct) at 35.\n21\n     ETI Ex. 46 (Considine Rebuttal) at 19-24; ETI Initial Brief at 5-6.\n22\n     ETI Ex. 46 (Considine Rebuttal) at 21-22; ETI Initial Brief at 7.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE20\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nmade an invalid post-test year adjustment because post-test year adjustments for rate base items are\nlimited to plant additions recorded in FERC Accounts 101 or 102. In contrast, regulatory assets, like\nthe Hurricane Rita regulatory asset, are recorded in Account 182.3. Therefore, in ETI' s opinion, if it\nwas required to amortize this regulatory asset, it would be appropriate to amortize it for only\n10.5 months, to the end of the Test Year (August 15, 2010, through June 30, 2011). These two\ncorrections would adjust Mr. Garrett's proposed asset balance from $10,714,557 to $21,805,940. 23\n\n\n          ETI also disagrees with Mr. Pous' recommendation that the regulatory asset be removed from\nrate base and placed in the storm reserve, to be amortized over 20 years. In ETI's opinion, this\napproach would defeat the purpose of securitization, which is to provide ETI with cost recovery in an\nexpedited manner. 24\n\n\n          Finally, ETI argues that Ms. Givens' analysis was flawed. It reiterated that no provision in\nthe Stipulation and Settlement Agreement or the final order filed in Docket No. 37744 directed the\ntreatment of the regulatory asset or stated that ETI would begin amortizing the asset. Further, ETI\nstresses that it never sought recovery of the entire asset all at once in Docket No. 37744. Instead,\nETI requests recovery over a period of years through amortization. Thus, according to ETI, even if\nMs. Givens' argument were accepted, the entire asset should not be disallowed. 25\n\n\n          This issue is a close call because the black-box settlement agreement and final order in\nDocket No. 37744 did not expressly state how the Hurricane Rita regulatory asset issue was resolved.\nThe following factors support finding that the Hurricane Rita regulatory asset issue was resolved in\nDocket No. 37744:\n\n\n•     the settlement agreement and final order in Docket No. 32907 expressly provided that the\n      difference between the amount of ETI's estimated insurance proceeds and the amount actually\n      received by ETI would be trued up after ETI received the proceeds~\n\n\n\n23\n     ETI Ex. 46 (Considine Rebuttal) at 22; ETI Initial Brief at 7-8.\n24\n     ETI Initial Brief at 8.\n25\n     ETI Ex. 46 (Considine Rebuttal) at 21; Id. at 8-9.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE21\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n•   PURA § 39 .459(c) provides that if the timing of a utility's receipt of insurance proceeds\n    prevented their inclusion as a reduction to the securitized costs, the Commission \"shall take those\n    amounts into account ... in the utility's next base rate proceeding;\"\n\n•   Docket No. 37744 was ETI's next base rate proceeding;\n\n•   in Docket No. 37744, ETI requested a true-up concerning the insurance proceeds, and it\n    requested that a regulatory asset be established for the deficit and amortized over five years;\n\n•   in Docket No. 37744, no party objected to ETI's proposed regulatory asset or amortization;\n\n•   the stipulation and settlement agreement entered by the parties in Docket No. 37744 stated that\n    the parties resolved all issues, except for ETr s Competitive Generation Service (CGS) proposal;\n    and\n\n•   neither the stipulation and settlement agreement nor the Order entered in Docket No. 37744\n    specifically disapproved, excluded, or deferred consideration ETI' s proposed regulatory asset,\n    although they did specifically exclude or disapprove other items, such as ETI' s CGS proposal\n    and various proposed riders.\n\n\n\n        On the other hand, some factors support a finding that the Hurricane Rita regulatory asset\nissue was not resolved in Docket No. 37744. The stipulation and settlement agreement and the\nOrder entered in Docket No. 37744 did not expressly approve ETI's proposed regulatory asset,\nalthough certain other items were expressly approved, such as River Bend Nuclear Generating\nStation Unit No. 1 (River Bend) decommissioning costs, depreciation rates, and other items. Also,\nutilities are typically not allowed to create regulatory assets without express approval of the\nCommission.\n\n\n        Thus, the difficulty with this issue is the nature of the black-box settlement of Docket\nNo. 37744. In the settlement, the parties agreed to an increase in base rate revenues of $59 million\neffective August 15, 2010, with an additional increase in base rate revenues effective May 2, 2011.\nHowever, there was no explanation on how this increase was determined, and there was no specific\nagreement or finding on the amount of ETI' s rate base or its reasonable and necessary cost of service.\nIn that case, there was no objection to ETI' s proposed Hurricane Rita regulatory asset, it was\nauthorized by the prior settlement in Docket No. 32907, and the Commission was directed by PURA\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                 PAGE22\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n§ 39 .459(c) to take into account ETI' s insurance proceeds related to the Hurricane Rita securitized\ncosts in ETI's next rate case, which was Docket No. 37744. Moreover, when there is uncertainty\nwhether an undisputed issue was deferred for future consideration or was included within the rates\nset in a black-box settlement, the burden should be on the utility to establish that the issue was\ndeferred for future consideration. When all the evidence and factors are considered, the AUs find\nthat that ETI's proposed Hurricane Rita regulatory asset should be considered as having been\napproved in Docket No. 37744, and ETI should have amortized the asset since August 15, 2010, the\neffective date of rates approved in that docket.\n\n\n        The AUs also find that none of the amortization calculations proposed by the parties were\nentirely correct. ETI's proposal to start with its requested $26,229,627 was flawed because it\nincluded carrying costs from August 15, 2010, when the asset should have been included in rate base,\nto June 30, 2011, the end of the Test Year in the present case. During that period, the asset would\nhave earned a rate of return as part of rate base, and accrual of carrying costs should have ceased.\nTherefore, it would be more accurate to begin amortizing the Hurricane Rita regulatory asset by\nusing the balance requested by ETI in Docket No. 37744. That amount, according to Mr. Garrett,\nwas $25,278,210. However, the amortization calculation should not extend beyond the end of the\nTest Year in the present case (June 30, 2011), as proposed by Cities and Staff. P.U.C. SUBST.\nR. 25 .231 (c )(2)(F)( ii) provides for post-test-year reductions to rate base, and the recommendation for\na post-test-year adjustment to the Hurricane Rita regulatory asset does not fall within the scope of\nthat rule. The balance remaining after amortization to the end of the Test Year should be further\nreduced by $5,678,960 to account for additional insurance proceeds received by ETI after Docket\nNo. 37744 concluded but before the end of the Test Year in the present case. ETI argues that this\nreduction was already included in its request. However, as discussed above, the appropriate\ncalculation should begin with the balance of the asset at the conclusion of Docket No. 37744, not the\nbalance requested by ETI in the present case. The balance of the asset at the conclusion of Docket\nNo. 37744 did not account for the additional insurance proceeds paid to ETI afterwards, so it should\nbe deducted now. In summary, the AUs find that the appropriate amount of the Hurricane Rita\nregulatory asset to be included in rate base in this case should be calculated as follows:\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE23\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nBeginning balance at conclusion of Docket No. 37744 (original balance+ carrying charges)   $25,278,210\n\nLess amortization for period 8/15/10 to 6/30/11 = 10.5months160 months= 17.5%              - $4,423,687\n\nLess additional insurance proceeds received                                                - $5,678,960\n\nRemaining balance of Hurricane Rita regulatory asset                                       $15,175,563\n\n\n          Finally, the AU s recommend that the Commission not adopt the recommendation of Cities to\nmove the Hurricane Rita regulatory asset to the storm insurance reserve for recovery. As noted by\nETI, one purpose of enactment of PURA Chapter 39 was to allow expedited recovery of costs\nresulting from Hurricane Rita storm damage. Moving the regulatory asset to the storm insurance\nreserve would defeat that purpose and negate the five-year amortization plan the parties agreed to in\nDocket No. 37744.\n\n\n          In summary, the AU s find that ETI' s proposed Hurricane Rita regulatory asset was an issue\nresolved by the black-box settlement in Docket No. 37744. Therefore, ETI should have included the\nasset in rate base at the conclusion of that docket and should have begun amortizing it over a period\nof five years. The accrual of carrying charges should have ceased when Docket No. 37744\nconcluded, because the asset would have then begun earning a rate of return as part of rate base. The\nappropriate calculation of the asset should begin with the amount claimed by ETI in Docket\nNo. 37744, less amortization accruals to the end of the Test Year in the present case, and less the\namount of additional insurance proceeds received by ETI after the conclusion of Docket No. 37744.\nThis produces a remaining balance of $15,175,563, which should remain in rate base as a regulatory\nasset, applying a five-year amortization rate that commenced August 15, 2010. Further, the\nHurricane Rita regulatory asset should not be moved to the storm insurance reserve.\n\n\nC.        Prepaid Pension Asset Balance\n\n          ETI included in rate base an item titled Unfunded Pension in the amount of $55,973,545. 26\nThe amount requested in this account represents the accumulated difference between the Statement\nof Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 87 calculated pension costs each year and the actual\n\n26\n     ETI Ex. 3, Sched.

Thus, he argues, if the\nasset were included in rate base, ratepayers would pay a substantial premium for the slight pension\ncost savings ETI' s excess contributions may have achieved. 29\n\n\n          Cities argue that the entire prepaid pension asset should be removed from rate base because\nETI has not justified its inclusion. This would reduce pro forrna rate base by $36,382,803, which is\nthe net amount of the prepaid balance less accumulated deferred income tax ($55,973,545 -\n$19,590,740 = $36,382,803). At the same time, Cities would increase operating expense by\n$498,284, to provide a 1.37 percent return on the net balance of ETI' s prepaid pension asset\nbalance. 30\n\n\n          Alternatively, Cities contend that the Commission should treat the pension assets in the same\nmanner as the approach adopted by the Commission in Docket No. 33309. 31 In that docket, the\nCommission allowed a pension prepayment asset, less accrued deferred federal income taxes\n(ADFIT) and less the portion of the asset that is capitalized to CWIP, to be included in rate base. As\nto the excluded portion, the Commission allowed the accrual of an allowance for funds used during\nconstruction (AFUDC). Thus, Cities contend, if the Commission opts for this approach, it should\nallow ETI's pension prepayment asset, less ADFIT, to be included in rate base, but excluding\n\n\n\n27\n     Cities Ex. 2 (Garrett Direct) at 7.\n28\n     ETI Initial Brief at 10; Cities Ex. 2 (Garrett Direct) at 8.\n29\n     Cities Ex. 2 (Garrett Direct) at 8-9.\n30\n     Id. at 10, MG-2.2; Cities Initial Brief at 10.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                             PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                        PAGE2S\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n$25,311,236 for the portion of the prepaid pension balance associated with CWIP, and allow\nAFUDC to accrue on the excluded balance. 32\n\n\n           ETI responds first by disputing Mr. Garrett's contention that it has unreasonably overpaid\ninto its pension fund. It contends it has made contributions to the pension fund in accordance with\ncontribution guidelines established by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and\nthe Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and that the contributions were within the allowable range of\ncontributions deductible for tax purposes. ETI also was guided in its required pension contributions\nby the Pension Protection Act of 2006 rules, effective beginning with the 2008 plan year. 33\n\n\n           ETI next disputes Cities' contention that the earnings associated with ETI's pension\ncontributions provide insufficient benefits to justify inclusion of the asset in rate base. ETI points\nout that ratepayer benefits are not just limited to the level provided by the actual pension fund\nearnings on investment. Rather, under FAS 87, pension costs included in the cost of service for\nratemaking purposes are intended to include the expected rate of return on assets. Thus, ETI argues\nthat the expected long-term rate of return on ETI' s assets is 8.5 percent, not the actual earnings as\nsuggested by Mr. Garrett. 34\n\n\n           On behalf of ETI, Mr. Considine testified that the pension balance is no different than any\nother prepayments made by the Company, which are included in rate base and earn a full return on\nrate base. Furthermore, the Company would be allowed to earn a full return on rate base had the\nCompany invested these same dollars in Plant in Service, but the Company in this case used funds to\ncontribute to a still under-funded pension plan and at the same time provided a timely reduction to\nformerly FAS 87 annual pension cost, thereby immediateIy benefitting ratepayers. 35 Therefore, ETI\n\n\n31\n  Remand ofDocket No. 33309 (Application ofAEP Texas Central Company for Authority to Change Rates),\nDocket No. 38772, Order on Remand at FoF ISA (Jan. 30, 2011).\n32\n     Cities Initial Brief at 8-9; Cities Ex. 2 (Garret Direct) at 12.\n33\n     ETI Ex. 46 (Considine Rebuttal) at 22.\n34   Id.\n35\n     Id. at 23-24.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE26\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nargues it is clearly investor-supplied capital and accordingly should earn the Company's requested\nreturn on rate base.\n\n\n          ETI acknowledged the approach to this issue taken by the Commission in Docket No. 33309,\nbut failed to explain why it is distinguishable from the present case. 36\n\n\n          The AUs conclude that the approach taken by the Commission in Docket No. 33309 was\nsound and should be applied in the present case. Neither party adequately explained why the\ncircumstances of the present case are distinguishable.        Thus, the AUs recommend that the\nCWIP-related portion of ETI' s pension asset ($25 ,311,236 out of the total asset) should be excluded\nfrom the asset, but accrue allowance for funds used during construction.\n\n\nD.        FIN 48 Tax Adjustment\n\n          The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is the body that establishes the rules that\nconstitute generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). FASB' s Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48)\nprescribes the way in which a company must analyze, quantify, and disclose the potential\nconsequences of tax positions that the company has taken which are legally ''uncertain.\" Pursuant to\nFIN 48, ETI and its independent auditors are required to evaluate each of its uncertain tax positions\nto determine, under the most objective, reasonable standards, which portion of each position will\nmost likely ultimately have to be paid to taxing authorities if challenged by the authorities. FIN 48\nrequires that this portion be excluded from ADFIT for financial reporting purposes and accrue\ninterest and, in some cases, penalties. 37\n\n\n          ETI and its auditors periodically perform the FIN 48 analysis. In so doing, they have\nconcluded that the Company has taken a number of uncertain tax positions that the Company expects\nto lose if challenged by the IRS. ETI concluded that these uncertain tax positions result in a total of\n$5,916,461 in tax dollars that the Company expects it will ultimately have to pay, with interest, to the\n\n\n36\n     ETI Initial Brief at 10-11.\n37\n     ETI Ex. 70 (Warren Rebuttal) at 9-12.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                  PAGE27\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nIRS. As required by FIN 48, this amount is recorded on ETI's balance sheet as a tax liability. 38 In\nother words, ETI has, thus far, avoided paying to the IRS $5,916,461 in tax dollars (ETI's FIN 48\nLiability) in reliance upon tax positions that the Company believes will not prevail in the event the\npositions are challenged, via an audit, by the IRS.\n\n\n           In preparing its application in this proceeding, ETI made an accounting adjustment to its Test\nYear numbers by not including the $5,916,461 in its ADFIT balance. This had the effect of reducing\nthe Company's Test Year deferred tax balance and, therefore, increasing its rate base. 39\n\n\n           Cities witness Mark Garrrett asserted that the deduction of$5,916,461-representing ETI's\nFIN 48 Liability - should be added to ETI' s AD FIT balance and thus be used to reduce the\nCompany's rate base. Mr. Garrett pointed out that the Commission first considered this issue in a\nrecent Oncor docket. 40 In that docket, the Commission decided to include FIN 48 liabilities in\nADFIT because of the low likelihood that the IRS would actually audit and review the issue. 41\nMr. Garrett testified that this is a fair result because: (1) a utility with FIN 48 liabilities might never\nhave its underlying uncertain tax positions audited by the IRS; and (2) even if the uncertain positions\nare audited by the IRS, the utility might prevail on them. In either case, the utility would never have\nto pay those tax amounts. Moreover, during the time when the uncertainty exists, the utility enjoys\nthe use of cost-free capital (from the deferred taxes associated with the deductions) at its disposal. 42\nThus, Mr. Garrett recommends that ETI' s AD FIT balance be increased by $5,916,461 to reinstate the\nFIN 48 Liability removed by the Company.43\n\n\n\n\n38\n     ETI Ex. 64 (Roberts Rebuttal) at 4-7.\n39\n     Id. at 4.\n40\n  Cities Ex. 2 (Garrett Direct) at 5-7.

Mr. Roberts explained that, because the Company\nexpects to lose on its uncertain tax positions, it expects that it will ultimately have to pay $5,916,461\nin taxes to the IRS, plus interest. Accordingly, Mr. Garrett testified that the amount does not\nrepresent cost-free funds available to the Company and, as such, should not be included in the\nCompany's ADFIT balance. 44\n\n\n          Both the Cities and ETI agree that ETI' s rate base \"should reflect the actual amount of cost\nfree capital in the ADFIT accounts at Test Year end.\"45 However, ETI witness Mr. Warren testified\nthat the FIN 48 Liability is not cost-free capital to the Company because the best available expert\nopinion in the record of this case is that ETI will \"most likely\" ultimately have to pay the money to\n                          46\nthe IRS, with interest.\n\n\n          Moreover, Mr. Warren pointed out that, beginning with 2010 tax returns, a corporate\ntaxpayer is required to complete and file a Schedule UTP, on which the taxpayer must specifically\nidentify and describe its FIN 48 positions. Mr. Warren contended that, because ETI must now\nannually file a Schedule UTP, it is more likely that the IRS will audit the Company, thereby forcing\nit to pay the FIN 48 Liabilities, with interest. 47 This constitutes additional support for the notion that\nthe FIN 48 Liability is not cost-free capital for the Company. Mr.Warren correctly points out that, in\na recent CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC, (CenterPoint) rate case, the Commission\nspecifically acknowledged that filing of a Schedule UTP makes it more likely that a company will be\naudited. In that case, the ALJs recommended that CenterPoint's FIN 48 Liability, totaling some\n$164 million, be added to CenterPoint's ADFIT, thereby reducing its rate base. The Commission\nadopted the recommendation. However, in light of its conclusion that the filing of a Schedule UTP\nincreases the likelihood of an audit, the Commission authorized CenterPoint to establish a deferred\ntax account rider to enable it to recover any portion of its FIN 48 Liability that it might ultimately be\n\n44\n     ETI Ex. 64 (Roberts Rebuttal) at 7.\n45\n     Cities Ex. 2 (Garrett Direct) at 6; see also ETI Ex. 70 (Warren Rebuttal) at 6-7.\n46\n     ETI Ex. 70 (Warren Rebuttal) at 17.\n47\n     Id. at 14, 20-21.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                             PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                  PAGE29\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nforced to pay to the IRS, plus interest. 48 ETI does not necessarily oppose the use of a rider in this\ncase, but contends that it would be preferable to simply exclude ETI' s FIN 48 Liability from its\nADFIT balance, thereby increasing its rate base. 49\n\n\n          In the alternative that the Commission rejects ETI' s request to exclude the full amount of the\nFIN 48 Liability from the Company's AD FIT balance, ETI contends that at least any amount of cash\ndeposit the Company has made with the IRS that is attributable to the FIN 48 Liability should be\nremoved from the Company's ADFIT balance.so The Cities' witness, Mr. Garrett, agrees.st Staff\nalso agrees, arguing that ETI should be required to increase its ADFIT balance by the amount of its\nFIN 48 Liability less the amount of any cash deposit attributable to the liability that ETI has made\nwith the IRS.s2 ETihas made a cash deposit with the IRS in the amount of$1,294,683. This amount\nis associated with the Company's FIN 48 Liability.s3\n\n\n          Consistent with prior Commission precedent from the Oncor and CenterPoint proceedings,\nthe AUs conclude that ETI' s FIN 48 Liability should be included in the Company's ADFIT balance.\nThere is, however, one caveat to this conclusion. The amount of the cash deposit made by ETI to the\nIRS which is attributable to the Company's FIN 48 Liability should not be included in the ADFIT\nbalance. Therefore, the ALls recommend that the Commission find that $4,621,778 (representing\nETI's full FIN 48 Liability of $5,916,461 less the $1,294,683 cash deposit ETI has made with the\nIRS) should be added to ETI' s ADFIT and thus be used to reduce ETI' s rate base.

Cash Working Capital\n\n          Rate base includes a reasonable allowance for cash working capital. Cash working capital\nrepresents the average amount of investor capital used to bridge the gap in time between when\nexpenditures are made by ETI to provide services and when the corresponding revenues are received\nby ETI. 55 Generally, an increase in revenue lag days and/or a decrease in expense lead days will\nresult in an increase to the amount of cash working capital included in the rate base. Conversely, a\ndecrease in revenue lag days and/or an increase in expense lead days will reduce the cash working\ncapital included in rate base. A properly prepared lead-lag study can result in either a positive cash\nworking capital amount (and therefore an increase to the rate base) or a negative cash working capital\namount (and a corresponding decrease to the rate base).\n\n\n          Pursuant to P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.231(c)(2)(B)(iii)(IV), ETicalculated its cash working capital\nallowance by performing a lead-lag study. ETI witness Jay Joyce prepared the lead-lag study for the\nCompany. Based upon the study, ETI requests a cash working capital addition to its rate base of\nnegative $2,013,921. 56\n\n\n          Only Staff and Cities submitted evidence and argument relevant to the cash working capital\nrequirement.       Staff does not challenge the accuracy of the lead and lag days determined in\nMr. Joyce's study. Instead, Staff witness Anna Givens recommends that the cash working capital\ncalculation be updated to reflect the impacts of Staffs recommended adjustments to ETI's O&M\ncosts and taxes. 57 ETI agrees that the final cash working capital amount should be updated to reflect\nthe actual revenue requirements approved by the Commission in this case. 58\n\n\n\n\ncase than there was in the CenterPoint case, where CenterPoint had $164 million in FIN 48 liabilities.

Mr. Pous asserts\nthat the correct cash working capital amount for inclusion in ETI' s rate base is negative $24,000,000\n(more than an order of magnitude increase of the negative amount). 59 Each of the major components\nof the lead-lag study, and Cities' criticisms of same, will be discussed in tum.\n\n\n           1. The Revenue Lag Component of the Lead-Lag Study\n\n           Mr. Pous raises a number of criticisms about the revenue lag component of Mr. Joyce's lead\nlag study. There are four parts to the revenue lag component: (1) the \"service period lag,\" which\nconsists of the roughly 15 days from the mid-point of the month in which service is provided to the\nend of that month; (2) the \"billing lag,\" which represents the time between the date a customer's\nmeter is read and the date a bill is issued to the customer; (3) the \"collection lag,\" which represents\nthe time between the issuance of the bill and the date the customer's payment is received; and\n(4) \"receipt of funds lag,\" which measures the delay between ETI's receipt of payment and the\nbank's clearance of the payment. 60 When the four parts were combined together, Mr. Joyce\nidentified ETI's revenue lag as 43.86 days. 61\n\n\n                       (a) Billing Lag\n\n           Mr. Joyce identified the billing lags (i.e., the delay between when meters are read and bills\nare sent to customers) as ranging from 5.4 to 5.65 days, depending upon the customer class. 62 On\nbehalf of the Cities, Mr. Pous asserted that this duration is too long. Mr. Pous complained that the\nbilling lag in ETI's lead-lag study is longer than in studies from previous ratemaking proceedings\ninvolving ETI' s predecessor, despite the fact that, in the interim between studies, ETI has invested\nsubstantially in electronic meter reading devices and computer systems that ought to shorten the lag\ntime. According to Mr. Pous, in a previous proceeding, ETI' s predecessor identified its billing lag as\n\n59\n     Cities Ex. 5 (Pous Direct) at 72.\n60\n     ETI Ex. 17 (Joyce Direct) at 8-10.\n61\n     Id. at JJJ-3.\n62\n     Cities Ex. 5 (Pous Direct) at 74.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                             PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE32\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nonly 3 .61 days. 63 Mr. Pous also pointed out that the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC), recently\nadopted a 1-day billing lag for a large gas utility, Atmos Mid-Tex, due to the utility's use of modem\nelectronic meter reading devices (the Atmos Mid-Tex RRC proceeding). Mr. Pous stated that the\nbilling lag identified by ETI would oojustly reward the Company for being inefficient in sending out\nits bills because customers should not be pooished if the utility decides to manage its billing\nprocessing and payment system less efficiently. Thus, Mr. Pous recommended a schedule of\ndifferent billing lags for different customer classes. For residential and commercial customers,\nMr. Pous recommended a 1.46 day billing lag, based since ETI' s predecessor claimed such a lag in a\nprior PUC docket (Docket No. 12852). For large industrial, public authority, and street lighting\ncustomers, Mr. Pous recommends a billing lag of 3.72 days. He calculated that the combined impact\nof these adjustments would result in a 41.10-day total revenue lag (as compared to Mr. Joyce's figure\nof 43.86 days). Mr. Pous then calculates that this shorter lag period results in an additional negative\ncash working capital of $11.4 million. 64\n\n\n           ETI responds by pointing out that the 1.46-day billing lag suggested by Mr. Pous for\nresidential and commercial customers was derived from a rate case by ETI' s predecessor from 1993,\nwhereas Mr. Joyce more properly relied on actual Test Year data. Mr. Joyce asserted that Mr. Pous,\nin effect, \"cherry picked\" the 1.46-day figure from one page of a 4 7-page study associated with the\n1993 rate case, and that the remaining pages of the study have not been located and, therefore, cannot\nbe evaluated. Thus, Mr. Joyce testified, \"[i]t is unfair and unreasonable to use such an old document\nto attempt to support a position when reasonable, contemporaneous evidence exists.\"65\n\n\n           ETI argues that it is more appropriate in this case to rely upon ETI's actual residential and\ncommercial billing practices, rather than to substitute artificial and arbitrary 1.46-day and 3.72-day\nperiods derived from other sources. According to Mr. Joyce, it is unavoidably necessary, when\nconducting a lead-lag study, to take into account the actual amount of time employed by ETI in\nperforming all of the activities in its billing-cycle-based meter reading and billing processes.\n\n63   Id.\n64\n     Id. at 75-77.\n65\n     ETI Ex. 54 (Joyce Rebuttal) at 11.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                               PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE33\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nMr. Joyce complains that Mr. Pous' approach would jettison this actual data and analysis derived\nfrom the Test Year and improperly substitute arbitrary numbers based upon a prior, dated, rate\nproceeding. 66\n\n\n           Mr. Joyce acknowledged that the RRC recently adopted a 1-day billing lag in the Atmos\nMid-Tex RRC proceeding. He pointed out, however, that the RRC did so simply because Atmos\nMid-Tex failed to present evidence supporting a longer billing lag. Additionally, Mr. Joyce pointed\nout that the RRC promptly reversed itself in Atmos Mid-Tex's next rate case, adopting a longer\nbilling lag after the company provided sufficient evidence to support the longer period. 67\n\n\n           ETI also provided extensive evidence regarding the details of its meter reading and billing\nprocess. 68 ETI witness Dolores Stokes explained that the meter reading and billing cycle includes\ntime for extensive quality assurance activities to ensure accurate billing, thereby preventing\nunnecessary frustration for the customer and additional costs to the Company that would be required\nfor customer service, rebilling, and account corrections. 69\n\n\n           Cities questioned Mr. Joyce at the hearing about the billing lag period in this case compared\nto ETI' s last rate case. Mr. Joyce explained that the total period from meter reading to collection of\nbilling revenues had not changed appreciably between the two cases, but due to a difference in lead-\nlag methodology, the date that divides the two components of that lag - metering to billing and\nbilling to collection       had changed. 70 As a result, the first period - billing lag- was longer than in\nthe previous case but the second period - collection lag - was shorter.71 ETI introduced into\nevidence a response to a Cities RFI that discussed this difference in more detail. 72 After explaining\n\n\n66\n     Id. at 5-7.\n67\n     Id.at 8-9.\n68\n     ETI Ex. 54 (Joyce Rebuttal); ETI Ex. 66 (Stokes Rebuttal).\n69\n     ETI Ex. 66 (Stokes Rebuttal) at 18.\n70\n     Tr. at 499-500, 502.\n71\n     Tr. at 499-502.\n72\n     ETI Ex. 73.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE34\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nthe change in lead-lag methodology, the RFI response concluded that \"the combined billing and\ncollection lags are substantially similar from the prior case to this current case.\"73\n\n\n          The AU s conclude that ETI has met its burden to show that the billing lag it utilized in the\nlead-lag study is reasonable and appropriate.       Absent his own opinion, Mr. Pous does not offer\nmeaningful evidence to support his assertion that the Company's billing lag is too long or that the\nCompany's billing practices are inefficient. For example, he offered no criticism of any specific\nbilling practice of the Company. The only support for his charge of inefficiency is that the billing lag\nin a previous ETI rate case was shorter. Mr. Joyce convincingly explained that this was merely an\nartifact of changes in the methodology of the lead-lag study-the billing lag became longer, but the\ncollection lag became shorter.\n\n\n          Mr. Pous' reliance upon an example from the RRC is unconvincing. Similarly, his reliance\nupon data from a previous rate case is unpersuasive, especially because only a very limited snippet of\ndata from that case is available, the case occurred roughly 20 years ago, and it involved a different\ncompany. It is not possible, from the evidence in the record, to know how different or similar ETI' s\ncurrent billing practices are to those used in the previous case.\n\n\n          In this case, ETI has thoroughly explained its metering and billing processes and established\nthat those processes are reasonable. The Company is therefore entitled to establish rates based on the\nactual cash working capital necessary to facilitate those policies. The AI.Js recommend rejecting\nCities' request to shorten the billing lag time identified in ETI's lead-lag study\n\n\n                        (b) Collection Lag\n\n          In his lead-lag study, Mr. Joyce identified various collection lags (i.e., the delay between the\nissuance of an electric bill and the date the customer's payment is received) for different classes of\ncustomers. As to third-party customers, the collection lag was determined using a random sample of\ninvoices from residential, commercial, industrial, public authority, and street light customer billings\n\n\n73\n     ETI Ex. 73 at 2.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                               PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE35\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nduring the Test Year, measuring the time between when the bills were mailed and the payment\nreceipt date. The collection lag for MSS-4 and Intra-System Bill (ISB) revenues was based on the\n                                                                74\nactual payment dates for each of the affiliate revenue types.\n\n\n               >     Collection Lag for Residential Customers\n\n          As to the residential class, Mr. Joyce determined that the collection lag was 23.73 days. On\nbehalf of the Cities, Mr. Pous disputed the accuracy of that estimate, complaining that it is\nsubstantially longer than the lag identified for commercial customers. Mr. Pous contended that\nMr. Joyce determined the collection lag for residential customers by relying on a sample size that\nwas too small. Mr. Pous examined the month-end accounts receivable data for ETI's entire\nresidential class for the entire Test Year, and concluded that the collection lag for the class is actually\n22.07 days (as compared to Mr. Joyce's figure of 23.73 days). Mr. Pous then calculated that this\n                                                                                               75\nshorter lag period results in an additional negative cash working capital of $2.4 million.\n\n\n          Mr. Joyce made several points in response. First, he noted that, although Mr. Pous is\nadvocating reliance upon month-end accounts receivable data to calculate the collection lag in this\ncase, he has testified in another proceeding that such data is unusable and unreliable. For example,\nin the Atmos Mid-Tex RRC proceeding, Mr. Pous argued in favor of measuring actual bill payment\npractices of actual customers (i.e., the approach taken by Mr. Joyce in the present case) and against\nanalyzing the monthly accounts receivable balances for each month of the Test Year (i.e., the\napproach now being advocated for by Mr. Pous). 76 Next, Mr. Joyce disputed Mr. Pous' assertion that\nthe sample size used by Mr. Joyce was too limited. According to Mr. Joyce, his sample of 100\nresidential customers is comparable to all of the residential collection lag calculations he has\nperformed during his 15 years of performing lead-lag studies. 77 Mr. Joyce also accused Mr. Pous of\n\n\n\n\n74\n     ETI Ex. 17 (Joyce Direct) at 10.\n75\n     Cities Ex. 5 (Pous Direct) at 77-79.\n76\n     ETI Ex. 54 (Joyce Rebuttal) at 13-15.\n77\n     Id. at 15-17.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE36\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ninexplicably picking out a few data points, rather than relying upon the entirety of the sampling data,\nin order to derive his collection lag estimate.78\n\n\n           The AU s are unpersuaded by Mr. Pous' criticisms and conclude that ETI has met its burden\nto show that the collection lag it utilized in the lead-lag study for residential customers is reasonable\nand appropriate.\n\n\n                  };>   Collection Uig for MSS-4 and ISB Affiliate Rate Classes\n\n           As to MSS-4 and ISB rate classes, Mr. Joyce determined that the collection lags were 46.19\nand 15.61 days, respectively. 79 Mr. Pous again disputed the accuracy of these estimates. Mr. Pous\npointed out that the underlying data reveals that the majority of the MSS-4 revenue lag days range\nfrom 43 to 46 days, with only two values equaling or exceeding 50 days. Mr. Pous testified that the\ntwo values equaling or exceeding 50 days should be deemed unrepresentative and, therefore,\nexcluded from the calculations for determining the average lag. Similarly, the majority of ISB\nrevenue lag days range from 15 to 16 days, with only a few lags running as long as 22 days. Again,\nMr. Pous contended that the longer revenue lag days should be deemed unrepresentative and\nexcluded from the calculations for the average. Mr. Pous also complained that the payment\ndeadlines for these affiliate transactions are stipulated in the Entergy System Agreement. Thus, it is\nMr. Pous' opinion that ETI unreasonably contractually agreed to \"excessively long\" revenue lag days\nassociated with the MSS-4 and ISB rate classes. Mr. Pous concluded that if what he considers to be\nthe unrepresentative lag days are excluded from the calculations, then the collection lag would\nchange for the MSS-4 class from 46.19 days to 45.14 days, and for the ISB class from 15.61 days to\n14.77 days. Collectively, the lag for the two classes would be .77 days shorter, resulting in an\nadditional negative cash working capital of $3. 2 million. 80\n\n\n\n\n78\n     Id. at 17.\n79\n     Id. at 18.\n° Cities Ex. 5 (Pous Direct) at 79-81; ETI Ex. 54 (Joyce Rebuttal) at 18.\n8\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                              PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                    PAGE37\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          Mr. Joyce first responded by disputing Mr. Pous' contention that there are unusual outliers in\nthe MSS-4 and ISB payment data. He noted that the lag days for MSS-4 payments ranged from 43 to\n54 days. He described this as a \"relatively tight payment range and certainly within the expected\nrange of reasonableness.\" 81 Next, Mr. Joyce described Mr. Pous' assertion that outlier numbers\nshould not be considered in the data as nonsensical. Mr. Joyce agreed that, in cases where sampling\nis used (such as was done for the residential customer class), it is appropriate to exclude data points\nthat are unrepresentative of the population as a whole. In the case of the MSS-4 and ISB classes,\nhowever, Mr. Joyce determined the collection lag by reviewing the entire class populations.\nAccording to Mr. Joyce, it is inappropriate to eliminate data points when reviewing an entire\npopulation, unless it is necessary to make a known and measurable change. 82\n\n\n          The AUs are again unpersuaded by Mr. Pous' criticisms. The AUs conclude that ETI has\nmet its burden as to show that the collection lag it utilized in the lead-lag study is reasonable and\nappropriate.\n\n\n                      (c) Receipt of Funds Lag\n\n          In the lead-lag study, Mr. Joyce identified the receipt of funds lag (i.e., the delay between the\ndate the funds are received from the customers and the date the funds clear the bank and are available\ntoETI). As required byP.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.23l(c)(2)(B)(iii)(IV)(-d-), Mr.Joyce assumed that one\nbusiness day is needed to clear any payments by methods other than electronic transfer, while\nelectronic payments are available to ETI on the date received. Because 53.39 percent of customer\npayments were made by methods other than electronic transfer, Mr. Joyce calculated the receipt of\nfunds lag to be .77 days. 83\n\n\n          Mr. Pous again contended that this duration is too long.          He acknowledges that P.U.C.\nSUBST. R. 25.231(c)(2)(B)(iii)(N)(-d-) mandates the assumption that funds paid by check will be\n\n81\n     ETI Ex. 54 (Joyce Rebuttal) at 19.\n82\n     /d.atl9.\n83\n   ETI Ex. 17 (Joyce Direct) at l 0. The receipt of funds lag is also sometimes referred to by the witnesses as\nthe \"cash receipts float.\"\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE38\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\navailable \"no later than\" the following business day. However, he stated that this is merely the\nmaximum possible duration, and ETI should take into account that fact that many checks are cleared\n(and therefore the funds are available) sooner than one day later. Therefore, the funds from all\nchecks received on any day other than Saturday should be assumed to be available on the date of\nreceipt, while the funds from checks received on Saturday should be assumed to be available two\ndays later. Mr. Pous was also critical of the fact that Mr. Joyce treated the funds from all \"walk-in\"\npayments made by customers to be available the next day. Funds from walk-in payments ought to be\ndeemed available on the date they are received. If these two changes are adopted, Mr. Pous\ncontended that receipt of funds lag would be shortened from .77 days to .15 days, resulting in an\nadditional negative cash working capital of $2.1 million. 84\n\n\n          Mr. Joyce first responded by pointing out that Mr. Pous' contention that all funds are\nimmediately available except for checks received on Saturdays is simply not accurate. Mr. Joyce\ncited from a 2007 Report to Congress made by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem which supports the conclusion that most funds paid by check in this country are not available\non the day they are received (and a significant portion are still not available the next business day). 85\nMr. Joyce also disagreed with Mr. Pons' contention that all walk-in payments should be considered\nimmediately available. According to Mr. Joyce, walk-in payments are made at third-party vendor\nlocations, such as grocery stores and check-cashing stores. Based upon his own investigation,\nMr. Joyce determined that walk-in payments are actually available to ETI two days after receipt.\nThus, his one-day assumption for walk-in payments is conservative. 86\n\n\n          The AU s conclude that ETI has met its burden as to show that the receipt of funds lag it\nutilized in the lead-lag study is reasonable and appropriate. The positions taken by Mr. Pons on this\nissue      were    unreasonable      and     counter    to    the    requirements   of   P.U.C.

The Expense Lead Component of the Lead-Lag Study\n\n          For the expense lead portion of his lead-lag study, Mr. Joyce calculated different expense\nlead days for numerous different categories of expenses. Each category will be discussed in tum.\n\n\n                       (a) Expense Lead - Operations and Maintenance Expense\n\n          Mr. Joyce separated O&M expenses into two groups - energy costs and \"other O&M\"\nexpenses. Each of those two groups was further divided into subgroups. 87\n\n\n               ~   Energy Costs\n\n          Fuel. Mr. Joyce explains that, during the Test Year, ETI purchased two kinds of fuel: (1)\ncoal and oil; and (2) natural gas. He concluded that there were 44.27 expense lead days for coal and\noil, based upon the time between the service periods and payment dates or payment due dates for all\ncoal and oil invoices from the Test Year. As to natural gas, he determined that there were 40.63\nexpense lead days, based upon a comparison of the service period and payment due dates and the\npayment dates from a random sample of gas invoices. 88 No party challenged this approach, and the\nAI..Js find no reason to do so either.\n\n\n          Purchased Power. Mr. Joyce explained that there were two components to ETI's purchased\npower energy costs in the Test Year: (1) MSS-4 Purchases; and (2) Other Purchased Power\n(consisting of Joint Account Purchases, MSS-3 Purchases, Reserve Equalization, Cogeneration\nPurchases, Renewable Energy Credits, and Toledo Bend Purchases). Relying upon either the entire\npopulation or a sample from the Test Year (depending upon the category), Mr. Joyce concluded that\nthere were 58.76 expense lead days for MSS-4, and 35.79 expense lead days for Other Purchased\nPower. 89\n\n\n\n\n87\n     ETI Ex. 17 (Joyce Direct) at 11.\n88\n     Id. at 11 and JJJ-3.\n89\n     ETI Ex. 17 (Joyce Direct) at 12 and JJJ-3.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                               PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                          PAGE40\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n           No party challenged the 35.79 day estimate for Other Purchased Power. However, on behalf\nof the Cities, Mr. Pous testified that the expense lead days for MSS-4 should be lengthened from\n58.76 days to 60.65 days. According to Mr. Pous, Mr. Joyce made several errors in calculating the\nexpense lead days for MSS-4 expenses. First, Mr. Joyce inadvertently placed the service period\nmonth after the billing month for two MSS-4 invoices. Mr. Pous based this conclusion on the fact\nthat the expense leads for these two invoices are roughly 30 days shorter than the \"vast majority\" of\nthe other invoices. 90 In response, Mr. Joyce denied that he erroneously placed the service period\nmonth after the billing month, and pointed out that Mr. Pous lacks any evidence to support his\nassertion. Instead, Mr. Joyce considered the entire population of MSS-4 invoices for the Test Year.\nThose invoices show payment lead days ranging from 30 to 120 days, with most points being near\n30, 60, or 70 payment lead days. According to Mr. Joyce, this is reasonable and well within the\nrange he has experienced in other rate cases. 91\n\n\n           Mr. Pous testified that Mr. Joyce erred in calculating the expense lead days for MSS-4\nexpenses by considering only the payment due dates specified in the Entergy System Agreement,\nrather than also considering the actual payment dates. According to Mr. Pous, in four instances\nduring the Test Year, extensions were granted to ETI to allow it to make MSS-4 payments afterthe\ndeadline specified in the Entergy System Agreement. Therefore, Mr. Pous stated that the expense\nlead days for MSS-4 payments should have been calculated using the later of the actual payment date\nor the allowable payment period.92 Mr. Joyce largely agreed with Mr. Pous on this point. That is, he\nagreed that the payment lead days should be based on the later of the paid date or the due date.\nHowever, he disagreed with some of Mr. Pous' calculations on this issue because Mr. Pous wrongly\ndesignated several due dates of Saturday or Sunday, when he should have selected Fridays as the due\ndate. 93\n\n\n\n\n90\n     Cities Ex. 5 (Pous Direct) at 83-84.\n91\n     ETI Ex. 54 (Joyce Rebuttal) at 26-28.\n92\n     Cities Ex. 5 (Pous Direct) at 84.\n93\n     ETI Ex. 54 (Joyce Rebuttal) at 28-29.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                         PAGE41\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          Next, Mr. Pous testified that Mr. Joyce erred in calculating the expense lead days for MSS-4\nexpenses by erroneously concluding that one invoice had been paid on the first of the month when, in\nfact, it had been paid on the 18th of the month. 94 Mr. Joyce agreed with the change. 95 Mr. Joyce\nthen recalculated the expense lead days for MSS-4 and revised the number of lead days from 58.76\nto 59.81. 96\n\n\n          The AU s conclude that ETI has met its burden as to show that there were 59.81 expense lead\ndays for MSS-4, and 35.79 expense lead days for Other Purchased Power.\n\n\n               »   Other O&M Expenses\n\n          This category of expenses was broken down in the lead-lag study into four groups regular\npayroll costs, incentive payroll costs, affiliate service company costs, and all other O&M costs (such\nas materials, services, and so on).\n\n\n          Regular Payroll Costs.          The lead days for regular payroll costs were computed by\ndetermining the average days of service being reimbursed and adding the days between the end of\neach service period and the payments to employees. This amount was then adjusted to incorporate\nthe effects of vacation pay based upon actual ETI data. By this method, Mr. Joyce determined the\nexpense lead for regular payroll costs to be 20.68 days. 97 No party challenged this approach, and the\nALls agree.\n\n\n          Incentive Pay Costs. ETI has an annual employee incentive program in place. Incentive\npayments for the year 2010 were made in the first quarter of 2011. The lead days for incentive pay\ncosts were based on the weighted days between the midpoint of the service period (i.e., July 1, 2010)\nand the date the incentives were paid (March 10, 2011).

The lead days\nfor affiliate service company costs were based on the number of days from the mid-month to the later\nof the contractual due date or the actual settlement date in the following month. By this method, Mr.\nJoyce determined the expense lead for affiliate service company costs to be 39.64 days. 99\n\n\n           The lead days for other O&M costs were based on a random sampling from the Test Year.\nMr. Joyce originally determined the expense lead for other O&M costs to be 47.46 days. 100\nHowever, to correct an error on his part, Mr. Joyce subsequently revised the expense lead time for\nother O&M costs down to 43.89 days. 101\n\n\n           Mr. Po us testified that ETI' s \"FAS 106-related expenses\" were wrongly included in either the\naffiliate service company costs or the other O&M costs. FASB is the body that establishes the rules\nthat constitute GAAP. FASB's Statement Number 106 (FAS 106) establishes the standards for an\nemployer's treatment of the non-cash retirement benefits it gives its employees. Based on the action\ntaken by the Commission in Docket No. 16705, 102 Mr. Pous believes that ETI's FAS 106 costs\nshould have been separately identified and accounted for in the lead-lag study. He contended that,\nwhen those costs are properly accounted for, it results in an additional negative cash working capital\nof $3.8 million. 103\n\n\n\n98\n      Id. at 14 and JJJ-3.\n99\n      ETI Ex. 17 (Joyce Direct) at 15, and JJJ-3.\n100\n      Id.at15-17,andJJJ-3.\n101\n      ETI Ex. 54 (Joyce Rebuttal) at JJJ-R-2.\n102\n   Application ofEntergy Gulf States, Inc.for Approval of Its Transition to Competition Plan and the Tariffs\nImplementing the Plan, and for the Authority to Reconcile Fuel Costs, to Set Revised Fuel Factors, and to\nRecover a Surcharge for Underrecovered Fuel Costs, Docket No. 16705, (Oct. 13, 1998).\n103\n      Cities Ex. 5 (Pous Direct) at 85-88.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE43\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          Mr. Joyce contended that the prior Commission decision upon which Mr. Pous relies, Docket\nNo. 16705, dates from 1996, is inapplicable to the facts in the present case, is outdated, and has been\nsuperseded by subsequent Commission decisions. Mr. Pous advocated a 312.55-day expense lead\nfor FAS 106 expenses. However, Mr. Joyce pointed out that, during the Test Year, ETI made its\nFAS 106 payments to a trust at the end of each month, resulting in a one-half month payment lead\n(15.25 days). Mr. Joyce testified that his treatment of FAS 106 expenses in his lead-lag study is\nconsistent with the approach that was approved by the Commission in a recent Oncor ratemaking\ncase, Docket No. 35717 . 104\n\n\n           The AIJs conclude that ETI met its burden to show that there were 39.64 expense lead days\nfor Affiliate Service Company Costs and 43.89 expense lead days for Other O&M Costs.\n\n\n                       (b) Expense Lead- Current Federal Income Tax Expense\n\n           As required by P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.23l(c)(2)(B)(iii)(IV)(-f-), Mr. Joyce calculated the lead\ndays for federal income taxes by measuring the days between the midpoints of the annual calendar\nyear service periods and the actual dates on which ETI made its estimated quarterly tax payments.\nBy this method, Mr. Joyce determined the expense lead for current federal income tax costs to be\n38 days. He then determined that this resulted in a $1.6 million cash working capital requirement\nassociated with the Company's Federal Income Tax Expenses. 105\n\n\n           Mr. Pous testified that the Company's cash working capital requirement for Federal Income\nTax Expenses ought to be a negative number or, at most, zero. He bases this argument on his\nassertion that, during the past five years, the Company \"has received in excess of a net $90 million of\nrefunds\" on its federal income taxes.

Moreover, Mr. Joyce stresses that his approach for calculating\nthe expense lead for current federal income taxes is perfectly consistent with: ( 1) the requirements of\nP.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.231(c)(2)(B)(iii)(IV)(-f-); (2) current IRS guidelines found at IRS\nPublication 542; and (3) Commission precedent. Mr. Joyce further points out that, by contrast,\nMr. Pous' approach has been consistently rejected by the RRC. 107            The Al.Js find Mr. Joyce's\narguments to be more persuasive on this point and conclude that ETI has met its burden as to show\nthat the expense lead for current federal income tax costs it utilized in the lead-lag study is\nreasonable and appropriate.\n\n\n          The AlJ s conclude that ETI met its burden to show that there were 39 .64 expense lead days\nfor Affiliate Service Company Costs and 43.89 expense lead days for Other O&M Costs.\n\n\n                       (c) Expense Lead and Lag-Taxes Other than Income Taxes\n\n          This group of taxes consists of: (1) payroll-related taxes; (2) ad valorem taxes; (3) Texas state\ngross receipts taxes; (4) the PUC assessment tax; and (5) Texas state franchise taxes. Calculating\nfrom the midpoints of the work periods to the respective payment dates of the taxes, Mr. Joyce\ndetermined that the payroll taxes had an expense lead time of 16.45 days. As to the franchise taxes,\nMr. Joyce concluded that the Company had a collection lag of 46.42 days because the Company was\nrequired to pay the taxes in May 2010. As to the other non-payroll-related taxes, Mr. Joyce\ncalculated from the midpoint of the period for which the tax was assessed to the payment date,\nresulting in the following expense lead days: 213.51 days for ad valorem taxes; 74.28 days for Texas\n\n\n\n\n106\n      Cities Ex. 5 (Pous Direct) at 88-89.\n  7\n!0    ETI Ex. 54 (Joyce Rebuttal) at 33-36, JJJ-R-1.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                               PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE45\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nstate gross receipts taxes; and 225.50 days for the PUC tax. 108 No party challenged this approach,\nand the AU s agree.\n\n\nF.        Self-Insurance Storm Reserve [Germane to Preliminary Order Issue No. S]\n\n          In Docket Nos. 16705 and 37744, the Commission authorized ETI to maintain a reasonable\nand necessary storm damage reserve account of $15,572,000. 109 As of June 30, 1996, ETI had a\npositive reserve balance of $12,074,581, constituting a reduction to rate base. Over the next\n15 years, ETI charged $101,670,803 to the reserve related to more thart 200 storms (excluding\nsecuritized events), but it accrued only $29,796,478 through base rates. Thus, ETI's end-of-test-year\nbalance for its storm damage reserve in the present case was a negative $59,799,744. 110 This\nnegative balance is an addition to rate base. 111\n\n\n          OPC and Cities argue that ETI's current storm damage reserve negative balance should be\nadjusted. OPC contends that ETI failed to prove that its storm damage expenses booked since 1996\nwere reasonable and prudently incurred, so it recommends disallowing all of those charges arid\nrefunding to customers the resulting positive balance that exceeds the authorized balance.\nAlternatively, OPC suggests that ETI's negative balartce be reset to its currently authorized balance,\nwith no refund to customers. Cities contend that ETI's current negative storm damage reserve\nbalance should be reduced because it includes: unreasonable expenditures associated with a 1997 ice\nstorm; expenses associated with former assets in Louisiarta; and amounts that Cities claim should\nhave been treated as insurance deductibles. Cities also recommend transferring ETI' s Hurricane Rita\nRegulatory Asset to the storm damage reserve.

The Effect of Prior Settled Cases\n\n        As with the Hurricane Rita Regulatory Asset (Section V.B.), the effect of the black-box\nsettlements in Docket Nos. 34800 and 37744 is a significant issue concerning the storm damage\nreserve. However, the parties' positions are generally reversed from the positions taken on the\nHurricane Rita Regulatory Asset. That is, ETI now argues that its storm reserve negative balance\nwas resolved and approved in those settled dockets, while Cities and OPC argue that it was not.\n\n\n        ETI notes that the final orders in Docket Nos. 34800 and 37744 contained \"stipulated and\nagreed upon\" conclusions of law stating that overall total invested capital through the end of the test\nyear in those cases met the requirements of PURA § 36.053( a) that electric utility rates be based on\nthe original cost, less depreciation, of property used by and useful to the utility in providing\nservice. 112 Then ETI cites language in P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.231(c)(2)(E), which provides that any\ndeficit in a self-insurance plan will be considered an increase to rate base, or invested capital. As a\nresult, ETI argues, the Commission could not make a determination that a rate base expense item\nwas included in rate base as used and useful without also determining that the rate base expense was\nprudently and reasonably incurred. 113 Thus, ETI asserts, a Commission conclusion of law that\napproved invested capital as meeting the requirements of PURA § 36.053(a) necessarily also\ndetermined that an expense included in rate base was prudently and reasonably incurred. In other\n\n\n112\n   PURA§ 36.053(a) provides: \"Electric utility rates shall be based on the original cost, less depreciation, of\nproperty used by and useful to the utility in providing service.\"\n113\n   ETI cited: City ofAlvin v.

Cities point out that in order to comply with PURA, all final orders in rate\ncases must include a conclusion of law stating that the overall total invested capital through the end\nof the test year meets the requirements of PURA§ 36.053( a). However, Cities contend, pursuant to\nthe parties' agreements in Docket Nos. 37744 and 34800, no determination was made as to what was\nincluded in ETI' s total invested capital in those cases. Cities explain that in Docket Nos. 37744 and\n34800 Cities claimed that certain expenses were not properly included in the storm reserve balance,\nwhile ETI argues that they were.             However, neither Cities nor ETI's recommendation was\nspecifically approved as part of the base rate settlement and neither of their recommended balances\nmay be considered as the basis for setting rates in those dockets. 116 Thus, Cities argues, in such\n\"black box\" settlements no specific storm reserve balance is approved unless expressly stated. Cities\nalso argues that the final orders in Docket Nos. 37744 and 34800 could just as logically be\ninterpreted as denying ETI' s request to include objectionable expenses in the storm damage reserve,\nbecause both orders specified that the revenue requirement approved in those cases did not include\nany prohibited expenses. Finally, Cities states that adoption of ETI' s arguments would make black-\nbox settlements impossible in the future. 117\n\n\n\n114\n     ETI cited Docket No. 7195, 14 P.U.C. BULL. at 1969 (\"the prudent investment test is embodied in\ntraditional ratemaking principles as expressed through PURA Sections ... 41.\").

As pointed out by Cities, in those\ndockets the intervenors disputed various items in ETI' s requested storm damage reserve, but the\n\"black box\" settlement did not specifically address those issues; consequently, it is as logical to\nconclude that objectionable expenses were excluded from the storm damage reserve and from the\ntotal invested capital as it is to conclude that the objectionable expenses were included. In\nSection V .B., the ALl s conclude that ETI' s Hurricane Rita regulatory asset should be considered as\nbeing   inclu~ed   in the black-box settlement and final order in Docket No. 37744, even though the\nsettlement and order did not expressly state how the Hurricane Rita regulatory asset issue was\nresolved. However, that issue involved unique circumstances and is distinguishable because PURA\n§ 39.459(c) required the Commission to consider the insurance payments for the Hurricane Rita\nrestoration expenses in ETI' s next rate case, which was Docket No. 37744; ETI requested a true-up\nin that docket of the insurance proceeds it received concerning the regulatory asset; and no party\nobjected to ETI' s proposed regulatory asset or its proposed amortization. In contrast, intervenors in\nDocket Nos. 34800 and 37744 did object to ETI' s proposed storm damage reserve and, under those\ncircumstances, it is not possible to determine how the issues concerning the storm damage reserve\nwere resolved by the black-box settlement. Therefore, the ALl s find that the black-box settlements\nand final orders in Docket Nos. 34800 and 37744 neither approved nor disapproved the\nreasonableness and necessity of ETI' s storm damage expenses incurred since 1996 or ETI' s current\nstorm damage reserve negative balance.\n\n\n118\n      OPC Reply Brief at 7-8.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                              PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE49\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          2. OPC's Proposed Adjustment\n\n          OPC witness Nathan Benedict testified that ETI failed to prove that any of its $101,670,803\nin storm damage expense booked since 1996 was prudently incurred, so he recommended\ndisallowing all of those charges and refunding to customers the resulting positive balance that\nexceeds the authorized balance. Removing those charges would leave ETI with a current positive\nstorm reserve balance of $41,871,059 (beginning balance of $12,074,581 + accruals of $29,796,478).\nThis balance exceeds the currently approved storm reserve balance of $15,572,000 by $26,299,059,\nand Mr. Benedict proposed that this surplus be refunded to rate payers at a rate of $1,314,953 per\nyear for 20 years. Mr. Benedict acknowledged that some storm damage expenses incurred by ETI\nsince 1996 likely were reasonable and necessary. Therefore, as an alternative proposal, Mr. Benedict\nsuggested that ETI' s current storm balance reserve be set at the last approved amount of $15,572,000\n(i.e., without any surplus or deficit). This proposal would result in a $75,363,744 reduction to ETI's\ncurrent storm damage reserve negative balance and rate base. 119\n\n\n          As discussed above, OPC disagrees with ETI's argument that the Commission implicitly\napproved these expenses in the final orders in Docket Nos. 34800 and 37744. 120 Therefore, OPC\nargues that ETI had to prove in the present case that the expenses were prudently incurred.\nConcerning ETI's burden of proof, OPC acknowledges that, although a utility has the ultimate\nburden to prove that its proposed rates are just and reasonable, once the utility establishes a prima\nf acie case of prudence of a rate change, the burden shifts to the other parties to produce evidence to\nrebut that presumption. Then, if the other parties rebut the presumption, the burden shifts back to the\nutility to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the challenged expenditures were prudent.\nHowever, OPC notes, if the utility fails to establish a prima facie case, the burden of going forward\nwith evidence never shifts to the other parties. 121 In OPC's opinion, ETI never established a prima\nfacie case because ETI' s spreadsheet of storm damage expenses was excluded from evidence and\n\n\n119\n      OPC Ex. 6 (Benedict Direct) at 6-16; OPC Initial Brief at 19.\n120\n      OPC Reply Brief at 7-8.\n121\n  OPC Reply Brief at 2-3, citing, Entergy Gulf States, Inc. v.

ETI also states that, in any\nevent, it met its burden of proof with regard to expenses booked to the storm damage reserve.\n\n\n          Concerning its proof, ETI states that its burden was to make a prima facie case supporting the\nprudence of its invested capital, 123 and once it made that showing, the burden shifted to the opposing\nparties to overcome the presumption of prudence by presenting evidence that reasonably challenged\nthe expenditures. 124 This is the same position as OPC. ETI argues that it met its burden to prove a\n                    125\nprimafacie case.          ETI notes that it provided storm cost data accompanied by narrative testimony\nthat supported the reasonableness of ETI's self-insurance plan; storm preparedness and response;\nservice quality; and cost of labor, materials, and services used to carry out distribution activities\n(including system restoration). For instance, ETI states, it presented its proposed storm reserve\nbalance through the direct testimony of Mr. Greg Wilson 126 and in the Commission's rate filing\npackage. 127 Mr. Wilson also explained the function of ETI' s self-insurance program, described the\n$50,000 threshold to exclude minor weather events, and provided work papers detailing the nominal\nand trended losses for each storm booked to the reserve since 1986, as well as annual and total loss\nlevels. 128\n\n\n\n122\n      OPC Reply Brief at 1-5.\n123\n   ETI Initial Brief at 22, citing, Application of Texas Utilities Electric Company for Authority to Change\nRates, Docket No. 9300, 17 P.U.C.

This evidence included ETI' s distribution operations,\nindustry-recognized comprehensive storm plans, annual storm drills, storm response and restoration\nprocesses, distribution maintenance and asset improvement processes, service quality and continuous\nimprovement programs, and vegetation management practices. ETI points out that Mr. Corkran also\ndescribed how it prepares for emergency situations, 129 and Mr. Corkran explained how charges to the\nstorm reserve are captured and recorded. 130 Mr. Corkran also noted that ETI has received either the\nEdison Electric Institute' s Emergency Assistance Award or Emergency Response Award every year\nsince 1998, which recognize ETI' s exemplary storm restoration response. 131 Likewise, Mr. Corkran\ndiscussed ETI' s reliability statistics since 2000, which demonstrated a high quality of service, 132 and\nhe provided four exhibits demonstrating that, on both per-kilowatt-hour (kWh) and per-customer\nbases, ETI' s distribution O&M costs compared favorably to the costs of other utilities. 133 In ETI' s\nopinion, because it carried out its distribution activities in the same efficient and cost-effective\nmanner while performing routine activities as during storm restoration, those metrics and reliability\nstatistics support the reasonableness of costs booked to the reserve. 134\n\n\n           ETI also argues that it supported the reasonableness of the costs booked to its storm reserve\nthrough the direct testimony of its supply chain witness, Mr. Joseph Hunter. Mr. Hunter explained\nthat ETI' s procurement policies and procedures are designed to streamline the acquisition of\nmaterials and services through the use of strategic supply networks in order to achieve the lowest\n\n\n\n\n129\n      Id. at 28.\n130\n      Id. at 93.\n131\n      Id. at 29.\n132\n      Id. at 12-29.\n133\n      Id., Exhibits SBC-2A, SBC-2B, SBC-2C, and SBC-20.\n134\n      ETI Initial Brief at 22-24.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                               PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                   PAGE52\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nreasonable cost. 135 Mr. Hunter also described how the centralization of the supply chain function on\na system-wide basis provides greater leverage and buying power in the procurement of materials and,\n                                                              136\nthus, lower costs than could be achieved by ETI alone.              Furthermore, Mr. Hunter specifically noted\nthat the standardization of supply chain activities \"makes possible a smoother day-to-day operation\n                                                                       137\nas well as rapid response to major storms or emergencies.\"\n\n\n          Finally, ETI stated that it provided an extensive amount of storm reserve data through the\ndiscovery process, which provided a basis for any interested party to investigate the reasonableness\nof any particular storm response or expenditure booked to the reserve. It stressed that OPC witness\nBenedict acknowledged that ETI provided 420 pages and over 22,220 lines of detail reflecting every\ncharge to the storm reserve over the last 15years, 138 which specified the month, year, state, project\ncode, work order type, function, storm name, account number, resource code, resource code\ndescription, and amount. 139 Therefore, ETI argues that it made a primafacie case regarding its storm\nreserve through the presentation of narrative testimony, schedules, work papers, and expense detail\nand, accordingly, the burden shifted to parties seeking to disallow the expenses allocated to the storm\ndamage reserve to present evidence that reasonably challenges their prudence. 140 Yet, ETI contends,\nOPC did not challenge any specific expenditure booked to the reserve other than the 1997 ice storm\nexpenses discussed later.

As noted above, a reasonable inference from the evidence\npresented is sufficient to establish a prima facie case. ETI witness Gregory Wilson presented\ntestimony about the background of the storm damage reserve and about ETI' s yearly major storm\ndamage losses, although OPC is correct that he did not explicitly evaluate or determine whether\nETI' s expenses were reasonable and necessary. 144 In addition, OPC witness Benedict provided\ntestimony that ETI has booked $101,670,908 to the storm damage reserve since 1996, 145 and that\nETI' s $50,000 threshold is a means of excluding from the reserve small storm-related expenses that\nETI could anticipate as routine O&M expense and which should be excluded from the storm damage\nreserve. 146 ETI presented testimony that it had not recorded storm damage expense to both the storm\ndamage reserve and to O&M expense, 147 and Mr. Benedict agreed that he had no information to\n                     148\ncontradict this            or that any securitized costs were charged to the storm damage reserve. 149\nAlthough the document itself was excluded from evidence, Mr. Benedict testified that ETI provided\nhim with a 420-page spreadsheet covering all of ETI's storm damage expenses back to 1996,\nincluding the month, year, state, project code, project name, work order type, function, storm name,\n\n\n142\n      271 S.W.3d 461, 467 (Tex.

Such testimony would have been more helpful than the evidence ETI relied upon.\nNevertheless, the burden of establishing a primafacie case does not require such direct testimony, if\na fact can be reasonably inferred from other evidence presented. The AU s reiterate that it is a close\ncall, but they find that ETI did present sufficient evidence to infer that the expenses charged to the\nstorm damage reserve were prudently incurred. At that point, the burden shifted to OPC to produce\nevidence to challenge specific expense items included in the storm damage reserve, but OPC did not\npresent any such evidence except for the items discussed below. Therefore, the AUs recommend\nthat the Commission not adopt either of 0 PC's recommended denials of expenses contained in ETI' s\nstorm damage reserve.\n\n\n          3.   1997 Ice Storm\n\n          ETI's proposed negative storm reserve balance includes $13,014,379 in expenditures\nassociated with a 1997 ice storm. Cities and OPC contend that this expense should be excluded from\nthe storm balance reserve.\n\n\n          Cities witness Pous explained that ETI first requested to include the 1997 ice storm expense\nin the storm damage reserve as a post test year adjustment in its 1995-1996 test-year rate case,\nDocket No. 16705. The Commission denied the requested post test year adjustment and stated that\nthe expense should be considered in ETI's next rate case. Thereafter, ETI had a series of rate cases\n(Docket No. 20150       1998 rate case; Docket No. 30123 -2004 rate case; Docket No. 34800-2007\nrate case; Docket No. 37744-2009 rate case) in which intervenors challenged the 1997 ice storm\nexpenses, but those cases all settled or were otherwise concluded without any express decision\n\n\n150\n      Tr. at 1704.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                 PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                  PAGE55\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nconcerning the prudence of ETI' s 1997 ice storm expenses. 151 Mr. Po us testified that these expenses\nare now appropriately at issue in the present case, and he recommended that the entire balance be\nexcluded from the storm damage reserve. He pointed out that in Docket No. 18249, the Commission\nfound that ETI' s poor quality of service exacerbated the extent of damage caused by the storm, and it\nfound that the response efforts were uneven and delayed and could have been more effective if ETI\nhad a better communication and management program in place. 152 Mr. Pous also contended that in\nthe present case ETI failed to prove that any portion of the 1997 Ice Storm expenses were\nreasonable. 153\n\n\n          Thus, Cities argue that the Commission has already determined that ETI' s negligence was a\nmajor factor in the extent and duration of the outages, 154 so no expenses associated with the 1997 ice\nstorm should be eligible for recovery from customers through the storm damage reserve. In response\nto ETI's argument that it was already penalized for these issues in Docket No. 18249 through a\nreduction to the allowed ROE, Cities argue that the Commission did not absolve ETI from\nresponsibility for damage caused by ETI's poor service quality, and ETI's customers should not be\nordered to pay for expenses that were caused by ETI's negligence. 155\n\n\n          OPC makes the same arguments as Cities concerning the 1997 ice storm expenses. 156\n\n\n          ETI argues that, due to quality of service issues related to the 1997 ice storm, the\nCommission reduced Entergy Gulf States, Inc.' s (EGSI) ROE by 60 basis points in Docket\nNo. 18249 and subjected EGSI to significant spending requirements and quantified performance\nguarantees. In ETI's opinion, it would be inequitable to now penalize ETI a second time for the\n\n151\n      Cities Ex. 5 (Pous Direct) at 49-55.\n152\n      Entergy Gulf States, Inc.

Moreover, ETI argues that it established that its expenses were reasonable and\nnecessary. ETI witness Shawn Corkran testified that the 1997 ice storm was the most destructive\nwinter storm ever to hit the EGSI/ETI system, with about 3,400 miles of distribution lines and\n560 miles of transmission lines de-energized during the storm's peak. A large part of the restoration\neffort involved clearing broken and fallen trees and tree limbs from lines. Mr. Corkran reviewed all\nof the costs incurred in response to the 1997 ice storm and stated that they were reasonable and\nnecessary to reliably restore service to customers as quickly as possible after the storm. He provided\nan exhibit with a detailed breakdown of labor, materials, transportation, lodging, and other expenses\nincurred.     In his opinion, all of these costs charged to the storm damage reserve, totaling\n$13,014,379, were reasonable, necessary, and prudently incurred. 157\n\n\n          The ALls recommend that the Commission authorize ETI to include in the storm damage\nreserve its $13,014,379 in expenditures associated with the 1997 ice storm. ETI established that\nthose expenses were reasonable and necessary to repair the damage and restore power to its\ncustomers. ETI witness Mr. Corkran provided detailed testimony concerning the seriousness of the\nstorm and the resulting expenses incurred for repair work and restoration of power to customers. 158\n\n\n          In contrast, Cities and OPC did not challenge any specific item in these restoration expenses.\nInstead, they relied upon the Commission's findings in Docket No. 18249 that ETl's deficient\nmaintenance exacerbated the amount of damage caused by the storm. However, in that docket the\nCommission also reduced ETI' s ROE by 60 basis points due to poor service issues, including\ndeficient preventative maintenance. The Commission made the reduction in ROE retroactive and\nrequired ETI to make refunds to customers. Likewise, in that docket the Commission found that the\nice storm was severe and that significant damage would have occurred even with exemplary\nvegetation management and other preventative measures. It is not feasible to accurately determine\nnow what portion of ice storm damage that occurred 15 years ago was caused by preventative\nmaintenance issues.\n\n\n157\n      ETI Ex. 48 (Corkran Rebuttal) at 2-12.\n158\n      ETI Ex. 48 (Corkran Rebuttal) at 2-12 and Ex.

Nevertheless, once the ice storm occurred, ETI had to take appropriate action to\nrepair the damage and restore service. ETI has established the expenses incurred in those efforts\nwere reasonable and necessary, and the Al.Js find that they should be included in the storm damage\nreserve. Therefore, the AUs recommend that the Commission deny Cities and OPC's proposed\nadjustment.\n\n\n       4. Jurisdictional Separation Plan Allocation\n\n       Cities complained that ETI's storm damage reserve deficit includes $12,498,325 in costs that\nbelong to Louisiana jurisdiction customers but were incorrectly transferred to Texas customers\nduring implementation of the Jurisdiction Separation Plan.         Cities explain that before the\njurisdictional separation of EGSI into ETI and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, LLC (EGSL), the\ntransmission investment and expense associated with maintaining the transmission system, including\nstorm restoration costs, was allocated between the Texas and Louisiana retail jurisdictions. In the\njurisdictional separation of EGSI into ETI and EGSL, the transmission system investment was split\nbetween each company based upon a situs basis. The transmission facilities in Texas were\ntransferred to ETI and the transmission facilities in Louisiana were transferred to EGSL. After the\njurisdictional separation, ETI and EGSL were each responsible for future O&M expense, including\nstorm restoration expense, associated with their respective transmission investments.\n\n\n       Cities claim that in the present case ETI has attempted to reverse the allocation of expenses\nincurred on behalf of Louisiana customers before the jurisdictional separation and to charge those\nexpenses to Texas customers through the storm damage reserve. In Cities' opinion, any expense that\nwas allocated to Louisiana customers prior to the jurisdictional separation was properly charged to\nLouisiana customers. Cities argue that ETI may not now reverse expenses allocated to Louisiana\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE58\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ncustomers and charge them to Texas customers solely on the basis that ETI acquired the transmission\ninvestment located in Texas. 159\n\n\n          In response, ETI witness Considine explained that an analysis of storm reserve charges was\npreformed prior to the jurisdictional separation to determine if storm charges were incurred for Texas\nor Louisiana property. The reclassification of certain charges was made as a result of that analysis,\nwhich is in evidence, to properly reflect the state in which the storm charges were incurred. The\nlargest charge assigned to ETI through this analysis was a $10,652.130 charge related to project\n\"E2PPSJ8291 Trans EGSI-TX Hurricane Rita 9-24-05,\" which expressly related to damages to the\nTexas portion of the former EGSI transmission system. Similarly, costs were assigned from ETI to\nEGSL for projects such as \"E2PPSJ8296 Trans. Hurricane Katrina - EGSl-La\" and \"E2PPSJ8302\nTrans EGSI-LA Hurricane Rita 9-24-05,\" that clearly related to assets located in Louisiana. In other\nwords, prior to the separation, the Texas portion of the storm damage reserve could include charges\nfor restoration work performed on assets located in Louisiana, and vice versa. The analysis\nconducted pursuant to the separation re-aligned the charges to the jurisdiction where the assets are\nlocated. In that way, ETI argues, neither jurisdiction has charges in its storm reserve balance for\nassets located in the other jurisdiction. In short, ETI argues that the assets and liabilities following\nthe separation have been properly assigned and no improper cost shifting occurred. 160\n\n\n          The ALJ s recommend that the Commission deny Cities' proposed adjustment. ETI offered\nevidence to explain how its reclassification study reassigned various costs from the Texas\njurisdiction to Louisiana, as well as from the Louisiana jurisdiction to Texas. This study resulted in\nmore expenses from Louisiana being reassigned to the Texas jurisdiction than from Texas to\nLouisiana, but Cities offered no evidence to explain why the study was flawed or why the\nreassignments were in error. The ALJs found ETI's evidence to be credible and that it supported the\njurisdictional allocation of these expenses as proposed by ETI.\n\n\n\n159\n      Cities Ex. 5 (Pous Direct) at 59-60; Cities Initial Brief at 19-20.\n160\n    ETI Ex. 46 (Considine Rebuttal) at 25 and Ex.

Mr. Pous asserted that this amount is equivalent to a deductible for insurance purposes\nand should have not been charged to the reserve. Cities note that P. U. C. SUBST. R. 25 .231 (b)( 1)(G)\nrequires that a storm reserve only collect for \"property and liability losses which occur, and which\ncould not have been reasonably anticipated and included in operating and maintenance expenses.\"\nBecause of ETI's low $50,000 threshold, Cities contend, ETI has recorded to. the storm reserve\nexpenses associated with 219 different weather events in the past 15 years. This equates to\napproximately 14.6 weather events per year, or 1.2 weather events per month, on average. In Cities'\nview, ETI' s booking to the storm damage reserve of all expenses associated with a weather event\nexceeding $50,000 - including the first $50,000 - is inconsistent with P.U.C.                  SUBST.\n\nR. 25.23l(b)(l)(G). Cities argue that ETI may not reasonably claim that such a recurring expense is\n\"not reasonably anticipated\" to qualify it for the storm reserve. Cities proposed adjustment is based\non $50,000 for each of the 219 storm events, for a total of $10,950,000. In addition, based on the\nnature of ETI's recurring storm expense, Cities also recommend that the deductible amount be\nincreased to $500,000, which Cities stated is consistent with the storm reserve treatment afforded to\nother utilities in Texas. 161\n\n\n          ETI witness Gregory Wilson testified that Mr. Pous misconstrued the $50,000 trigger when\nhe treated it as a deductible. Mr. Wilson explained that if a storm causes $50,000 or less in damage,\nthe expenses are not charged to the storm damage reserve. However, if a storm causes more than\n$50,000 in damage, all of the expenses are charged to the reserve. He noted that if the $50,000 were\ntreated as a deductible, then that amount would still be charged to O&M whenever storm damage\nexceeded the $50,000 threshold. But, under the current arrangement, when storm damage exceeds\n$50,000 all of the expenses are charged to the storm damage reserve, and the first $50,000 is not\ncharged to O&M. Therefore, no double recovery occurs. Moreover, ETI argues that Cities'\nproposed retroactive removal of these amounts from the reserve would constitute a disallowance of\n\n161\n      Cities Ex. 5 (Pous Direct) at 61-63; Cities Initial Brief at 20-21.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                    PAGE60\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ncosts without any finding of imprudence, as well as impermissible retroactive ratemaking. ETI also\ncontends that even if the Commission were to implement Mr. Pous' s recommendation prospectively,\nit would require a corresponding increase in ETI' s O&M costs. Therefore, ETI disagreed with\nCities' recommendation to reduce the current balance of the storm damage reserve by $10,950,000 or\nto change the current level of the threshold. 162\n\n\n          The AlJs find that Cities' proposed adjustment to ETI's storm damage reserve is not\nwarranted. ETI explained that the $50,000 threshold amount was included in the storm damage\nreserve whenever storm restoration expenses exceeded the threshold, but that amount was not\nincluded in O&M expense. Accordingly, no double recovery has occurred, and Cities presented no\nother valid reason to disallow the allocation of these expenses to the storm damage reserve.\nTherefore, the A1J s recommend that the Commission deny Cities' proposed $10,950,000 adjustment\nto ETI's current storm damage reserve balance. As a policy matter, the Commission may choose to\nincrease ETI' s threshold on a prospective basis to some higher amount, as recommended by Cities,\nbut the evidence presented by the Cities on this issue was not sufficient for the A1J s to make such a\nrecommendation.\n\n\n          6. Hurricane Rita Regulatory Asset\n\n          As discussed in Section V.B., Cities recommend an adjustment to the Hurricane Rita\nregulatory asset, and they recommended the adjusted balance be moved to the storm damage reserve.\nFor the reasons stated in Section V .B., the AlJs recommend that the Commission not adopt Cities'\nproposal to move the Hurricane Rita regulatory asset to the storm damage reserve.\n\n\n          7. Conclusion\n\n          In conclusion, the AlJs find that ETI's storm damage expenses since 1996 and its storm\ndamage reserve balance were not approved by the Commission as a result of the black-box\nsettlements in Docket Nos. 34800 and 37744. The AlJs also find that ETI established aprimafacie\ncase concerning the prudence of its storm damage expenses incurred since 1996 and that intervenors'\n\n162\n      ETI Ex. 72 (Wilson Rebuttal) at 2-3; BIT' s Initial Brief at 27-28; ETI Reply Brief at 21-22.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                 PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE61\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nproposed adjustments should be denied. Therefore, the ALJ s recommend that the Commission\napprove ETI's test-year-end storm reserve balance of negative $59,799,744.\n\n\nG.            Coal Inventory\n\n              ETI is the partial owner of two coal-fired power generating facilities. It owns a 29. 75 percent\ninterest in Nelson 6, a 550 megawatt (MW) unit located in Westlake, Louisiana (Nelson), and a\n17 .85 percent interest in Big Cajun II, Unit 3, a 588 MW unit located in New Roads, Louisiana\n(BCIUU3). EGSL is the majority owner and operator of Nelson and is responsible for the supply and\ndelivery of coal to that facility. A third party, LaGen, is a co-owner of BCIUU3, and is the operator\nof the plant. Pursuant to a joint operating agreement between the co-owners, LaGen is responsible\nfor the acquisition and delivery of coal to BCIUU3. The coal for both units comes, via train, from\nminefields in Wyoming. 163\n\n\n              Entergy has adopted a \"Coal Inventory Policy\" at Nelson to ensure that a sufficient coal\ninventory is always maintained on-site to help mitigate transportation and unit operating risks. The\npolicy calls for, among other things, a 12-month average inventory target of a 43-day supply of coal.\nBecause Entergy is not the operator of BCIUU3, it does not have ultimate control over the coal\ninventories at that unit. Pursuant to the joint operating agreement for that unit, however, each year\nETI nominates for the next calendar year the level of coal to be delivered for its account at BCIUU3.\nETI' s nomination process is targeted to ensure an end-of-year inventory target of a 43-day supply of\n        164\ncoal.\n\n\n              In its application, ETI includes a coal inventory amount in its rate base that is based upon the\naverage inventories at Nelson and BCIUU3 for the 13 months ending in June 2011. 165 The average\ncoal inventory at Nelson was 384,860 tons, representing approximately 48 days of inventory,\n\n\n163\n      ETI Ex. 33 (Trushenski Direct) at 3-4.\n164\n      ETI Ex. 33 (Trushenski Direct) at 30-31.\n165\n    ETI Ex. 68 (Trushenski Rebuttal) at 2. Notably, the amount ETI is seeking in its Rate Base is calculated\nupon a 13-month average ending June 2011 (the last month of the Test Year), even though that amount is\nslightly less than the 12-month average for the Test Year.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                 PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                         PAGE62\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nassuming an average daily burn rate of 8,000 tons. The total proposed dollar amount for the coal\ninventories at both facilities is $9,846,037. Of that total, the Nelson portion is $6,040,926, and the\nBCIUU3 portion is $3,805,111. 166 ETI witness Ryan Trushenski, the Manager of the Solid Fuel\nSupply Group for ESI, testified that the coal inventory levels that were maintained at Nelson and\nBCII/U3 during the test year were reasonable and the costs 'incurred to maintain those levels were\nreasonable. 167\n\n\n          Cities do not challenge the reasonableness of the Company's 43-day inventory targets.\nRather, Cities point out that the size of the actual inventory that was maintained on-site at Nelson\nduring the Test Year exceeded the Company's inventory target level. Therefore, Cities contend that\ncustomers should not be forced to pay for inventory levels exceeding a 43-day supply (the amount\nthat the Company determined, through its Coal Inventory Policy, to be a reasonable and necessary\ninventory to maintain on-site). According to Cities' witness, Karl Nalepa, a 43-day inventory of coal\nat Nelson would equate to 340,000 tons. He recommends that the value of a 43-day supply of coal\nbe included in the rate base, but that $1,451.415 be excluded from the rate base to account for\ninventory at Nelson that was in excess of the 43-day supply. 168\n\n\n          The evidence shows that the Company's inventory \"target\" was a 43-day supply, while actual\ninventories during the Test Year averaged around a 48-day supply. Mr. Trushenski pointed out, and\nthe A1J s concur, that the 43-day \"target\" was never intended to represent a hard and fast figure from\nwhich no deviations could be allowed. Rather, the target merely represents an operational planning\ntool. Moreover, there are many real-world factors - such as train cycle times, coal burn rates, and so\non - that can cause the actual coal inventory to fluctuate over time. 169 The ALls conclude that the\n48-day coal inventory was acceptably close to the 43-day target and was not unreasonable. The total\nproposed dollar amount for this coal inventory is $9,846,037.

Spindletop Gas Storage Facility\n\n           ETI relies upon a variety of fuel types to generate electricity. A major fuel component is\nnatural gas. However, energy generated from natural gas typically has the highest marginal cost and,\ntherefore, it is most often the last resource deployed to generate electricity. The fluctuation of natural\ngas demand resulting from the changes in instantaneous demand is known as \"swing.\" Although a\nportion of the system's base load requirement is met with natural gas, the primary role of natural gas\n                                      170\nis as a swing fuel on the system.\n\n\n           Since 2004, ETI has owned and used the Spindletop Facility. ETI, through a third-party\noperator, uses the Spindletop Facility to maintain a natural gas inventory that can be used to supply\nETI's Sabine Station and Lewis Creek power generating facilities. Spindletop consists of two\n                                                                                                171\nsalt-dome storage caverns (and associated equipment) located near Sabine Station.                     The\nSpindletop Facility serves a function similar to that of a city water tower - it enables ETI to buy\nnatural gas at one point in time, store it, and use it at some future point when supplies are not\navailable elsewhere or when peak needs cannot otherwise be met. ETI maintains that the primary\nbenefit of the Spindletop Facility is that it provides: (1) supply reliability; and (2) swing flexibility.\n\"Supply reliability\" means that the facility can provide a reliable supply of gas for Sabine Station and\nLewis Creek during potential gas supply curtailments, such as can occur during hurricanes, freezes,\nor other unusual events. In a worst-case scenario, the Spindletop Facility is capable of providing\n100 percent of the fuel requirements for all five units at Sabine Station and one Lewis Creek unit for\nfour days at 70 percent of capacity. The Spindletop Facility also allows the Company to avoid\nalmost all intra-day gas purchases for Sabine Station. This is important because intra-day purchases\ntend to be more expensive than longer-term purchases. 172\n\n\n           Because major supply disruptions are more likely to occur during hurricane season and\nduring the winter, ETI manages its gas inventories conservatively during the period from June\n\n\n170\n      ETI Ex. 28 (Mcllvoy Direct) at 7.\n171\n      Id. at 31.\n172\n      ETI Ex. 28 (Mcllvoy Direct) at 32-33; ETI Initial Brief at 39, n. 264.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE64\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nthrough March in order to ensure that it can provide a reliable supply of fuel to meet peak generation\nloads for four consecutive days. During the remainder of the year, ETI will consider withdrawing\ngas from the Spindletop Facility when the current day spot market price is higher than the\nreplacement cost for the gas, as determined by future market indicators. Conversely, ETI injects gas\ninto the Spindletop Facility when the cost of gas in the current market is less than the price of gas in\nthe futures market. 173 For these various reasons, ETI witness Karen Mcllvoy, who is employed as\nthe manager of ESI' s Gas & Oil Supply Group, testified that that Spindletop Facility is used and\nuseful for providing reliable, economical service to ETI' s customers. 174 ETI witness Devon Jaycox,\nwho is employed as the manager of ES I's Operations and Planning Group, testified that the Company\nis always evaluating how much reliability the Spindletop Facility can provide as compared to other\noptions. He explained that, at Sabine Station, there is no other option that can provide ETI with the\nsame level of reliability and flexible swing service that the Spindletop Facility provides. 175\n\n\n           Cities are critical of the Spindletop Facility, contending that the costs of operating it outweigh\nthe benefits gained from it. No other party challenged ETI' s use of the Spindletop Facility. Cities'\nwitness Karl Nalepa testified that it costs ETI $13,219 ,097 per year to operate the gas storage facility,\nwhereas the Company could achieve the same supply reliability and swing flexibility benefits it gets\nfrom the Spindletop Facility through other gas supply options at a cost of only $1,724,659, thereby\nsaving its customers $11,494,438. Thus, Mr. Nalepa stated that it is imprudent for ETI to continue\noperating the Spindletop Facility. 176\n\n\n           Mr. Nalepa testified that no other Entergy operating company owns or leases its own gas\nstorage facility, yet those other companies are able to satisfy their needs for supply reliability and\nswing flexibility through other methods, such as existing gas supply and transportation contracts, at\nmuch lower costs. According to Mr. Nalepa, those other companies obtain supply reliability and\nswing flexibility through the use of monthly, daily, and intra-day natural gas supply contracts.

He\npointed out that EGSL has no firm transportation contracts, no firm supply contracts, and no fuel oil\nback-up at its generating plants. Thus, Mr. Nalepa stated that the only cost incurred by EGSL for\nreliability and flexibility is the commodity cost of the natural gas it purchases. Mr. Nalepa testified\nthat EGSL achieves the same level of service as ETI without incurring the large cost of the\nSpindletop Facility. 177\n\n\n          Mr. Nalepa asserted that the long-term gas supply contract that ETI recently entered into with\nEnbridge Pipeline, L.P. (the Enbridge Contract) will help provide the Company with increased\nsupply reliability because the gas supplied by Enbridge will come from production areas that are less\nsusceptible to hurricane-related disruptions. Mr. Nalepa also noted that ETI could meet its swing\nflexibility requirements through use of spot gas purchases, its operational balancing agreement with\nthe TETCO pipeline, and other pipeline companies, such as the Copano Pipeline that serves Lewis\nCreek. 178\n\n\n          Mr. Nalepa also disputed ETI's contention that the Spindletop Facility serves as a valuable\nprotection against extreme events such as hurricanes, by noting that the Spindletop Facility was out\nof service for almost two weeks in 2005 following Hurricane Rita. 179\n\n\n          As noted above, Mr. Nalepa testified that it cost ETI $13,219,097 to operate the Spindletop\nFacility in the Test Year. Mr. Nalepa estimated that the sum of the Test Year withdrawals of gas\nfrom the Spindletop Facility equaled 8,560,604 MMBtu. He then divided his total estimated cost of\nthe facility ($13,219,097) by his total estimated withdrawals of gas (8,560,604 MMBtu) to calculate\nan \"all-in per unit rate\" of $1.54 per MMBtu. He asserted that, by contrast, transportation costs on\nvarious gas pipelines connected to Sabine and Lewis Creek ranged from $0.025 to $0.22 per\nMMBtu. Mr. Nalepa estimated $0.18 per MMBtu as the average replacement cost that ETI would\nincur in transportation contracts if it were to stop using the Spindletop Facility and achieve the same\n\n177\n      Cities Ex. 6 (Nalepa Direct) at 22-23.\n178\n      Cities Ex. 6 (Nalepa Direct) at 25.\n179\n      Id. at 23-24.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE66\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nlevel of supply reliability and swing flexibility through the use of gas supply contracts. By\nmultiplying $0.18 times 8,560,604 MMBtu, he estimated that the benefits of the Spindletop Facility\ncould have been achieved through other means at a cost of only $1,724,659. Thus, Mr. Nalepa\nrecommended that $7,794,202 should be removed from ETI's base rate, and $5,424,895 should be\nexcluded as an eligible fuel expense. 180\n\n\n          ETI disagrees with essentially all of Mr. Nalepa' s points and responds to his testimony on a\nnumber of fronts. Perhaps foremost, ETI points out that Mr. Nalepa's main premise - that ETI's\ncustomers pay all the costs of the Spindletop Facility while the other Entergy operating customers\navoid those costs - is simply incorrect. According to ETI witnesses, 57.50 percent of the costs\nassociated with the Spindletop Facility are billed to EGSL as part of the MSS-4 billing process\nbetween ETI and EGSL for its \"legacy plants,\" 181 and another 2.4 percent of the costs are passed on\nto other Entergy operating companies through the MSS-3 agreement. Only 40.1 percent of the\nSpindletop Facility costs are borne by ETI customers. 182 Thus, Mr. Nalepa's calculations greatly\noverstate the costs of the Spindletop Facility that are borne by ETI customers and greatly understate\nthe costs that are borne by EGSL customers. ETI witness Considine also pointed out that the\nCommission has consistently and repeatedly concluded that the Spindletop Facility is used and useful\nand, therefore, has allowed ETI and its predecessors to recover the costs associated with the\nSpindletop Facility. 183\n\n\n          Ms. Mcllvoy also testified that, contrary to Mr. Nalepa's testimony, the conditions under\nwhich the other Entergy operating companies operate are so different from the conditions under\nwhich ETI operates that it makes no sense to assume they have similar supply reliability and swing\nflexibility needs. For example, EGSL and ETI both own roughly the same generating capacity from\n\n180\n      Id. at 24-27; Cities Ex. 6B (Errata No. 2).\n181\n   The legacy plants are the four power generating plants that were owned by Entergy Gulf States, Inc. -\nLewis Creek, Sabine Station, Nelson, and Willow Glen. When EGSI was broken into ETI and EGSL in 2007,\nETI became the owner of Lewis Creek and Sabine Station, while EGSL became the owner of Nelson and\nWillow Glen.

However, the ETI plants are\noperated at a much higher capacity than the EGSL plants. During the Reconciliation Period, EGSL\nburned much less natural gas than did ETI- 63,420,554 MMBtu burned at the EGSL plants versus\n144,538,535 MMBtu burned at the ETI plants. Moreover, EGSL has four gas-powered plants while\nETI has only two. Of EGSL's four plants, two (Calcasieu and Ouachita) use combined cycle gas\nturbine technology. This gives them a quick-start and shut-down capability, allowing them to be\noperated primarily only at peak demand times. Thus, according to Ms. Mcllvoy, Mr. Nalepa's\npremise - that because EGSL is able to reliably operate its gas-fired facilities without gas storage,\nETI should be able to do so as well - makes no sense. Because ETI bums a vastly larger amount of\nnatural gas than EGSL, its need for supply reliability and swing flexibility is much greater. 184\n\n\n          Ms. Mcllvoy also disputed Mr. Nalepa' s assertion that ETI could use the Enbridge Contract\nand call options to provide the Company with sufficient supply reliability. She noted that the\nmaximum amount of gas deliverable under the Enbridge Contract is insufficient to run the ETI plants\neven at minimum load. By contrast, the Spindletop Facility is capable of supplying all Sabine\nStation units and one unit at Lewis Creek for four days at 70 percent capacity.       Moreover, the\nEnbridge Contract will expire, whereas the Spindletop Facility can be operated indefinitely.\nMs. Mcllvoy explains that the use of call options is not viable because a call option must be\ndelivered \"ratably,\" meaning the gas must be delivered at a constant, even rate throughout the\ndelivery period. In order to have gas available to meet peak needs in the absence of the Spindletop\nFacility, ETI would have to exercise call options for a maximum delivery, but it would not need all\nof the gas delivered at off-peak times of the day. 185\n\n\n          ETI witness Jaycox disputed Mr. Nalepa's premise that ETI could use call options to ensure\nreliability.    According to Mr. Jaycox, \"call options are cheaper than storage, but there's no\ncomparison\" between the amount of reliability that they provide as compared to the Spindletop\nFacility. 186 Mr. Jaycox also explained that, due to their geographic location and the limited import\n\n184\n      ETI Ex. 60 (Mcllvoy Rebuttal) at 3-8.\n185\n      ETI Ex. 60 (Mcllvoy Rebuttal) at 8-12.\n186\n      Tr. at 969.\n\f                                           ··-~~------------------------\n\n\n\n\nSOAHDOCKETNO.-                             PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE68\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ncapability to the ETI service area, Sabine Station and Lewis Creek are considered particularly\n                                                                         187\ncritical, thereby increasing the need for reliability at those plants.\n\n\n          When Mr. Nalepa calculated ETI' s cost of achieving supply reliability and swing flexibility\nwithout the use of the Spindletop Facility, he estimated it would cost only $1,724,659. He did so, in\npart, by assuming that a five-day 35,000 MMBtu/day call option would cost ETI $26,250.\nMs. Mcllvoy asserted that it is not reasonable to assume that all options would cost as little as\n$26,250. Based upon her calculations, ETI would have to purchase 14 five-day 35,000 MMBtu/day\ncall options per month to achieve supply reliability. She posited that, based upon the laws of supply\nand demand, the more call options ETI has to purchase, the higher the cost of those options would\nbe. She also pointed out that Mr. Nalepa' s proposed use of call options would require ETI to spend\nhundreds of thousands of dollars each month to purchase call options that it would never exercise.\nAccording to Ms. Mcllvoy, it is unclear from Commission precedents whether ETI would be entitled\nto recover the costs of these un-exercised options. 188\n\n\n          The evidence establishes that the Spindletop Facility is critical to providing reliability and\nswing flexibility to ETI' s Texas plants. The AU s conclude that the Spindletop Facility is a used and\nuseful facility providing reliability and swing flexibility to ETI' s customers at a reasonable price, and\nCities' arguments to the contrary lack merit.\n\n\nI.        Short Term Assets\n\n          In its application ETI requested that, as short term assets, the following amounts be included\nin the rate base: prepayments in the amount of $7 ,218,037; materials and supplies in the amount of\n$29,252,574; and fuel inventory in the amount of $53,759,975. These amounts were derived using\n13-month averages ending June 2011. 189 Staff witness Anna Givens agrees with the approach of\nusing 13-month averages to determine the appropriate amounts for short term assets. However, she\n\n\n187\n      Tr. at 975, 986-87.\n188\n      ETI Ex. 60 (Mcllvoy Rebuttal) at 12-15.\n189\n      ETI Ex. 3 at Sched.

Using this approach, Ms. Givens recommends that, as short term assets, the\nfollowing amounts be included in the rate base: prepayments at $8,134,351 ($916,313 more than\nETI's request); materials and supplies at $29,285,421 ($32,847 more than ETI's request); and fuel\ninventory at $52,693,485 ($1,066,490 less than ETI's request). 190 ETI does not oppose Staff's\nrecommendation on this issue. No party has a criticism of Staffs estimates as to prepayment,\nmaterials and supplies, and fuel inventory, nor do the ALls. Accordingly, the ALls recommend\nadopting the numbers proposed by Staff.\n\n\nJ.         Acquisition Adjustment\n\n           In its application, ETI included an adjustment of $1,127,778 for an \"electric plant\nacquisition.\" 191 The proposed adjustment, which relates to costs incurred by ETI when it acquired\nthe Spindletop Facility, consists of closing costs of $211,209 and legal and internal costs of\n$916,568. 192 ETI witness Considine explained that, prior to December 2009, the same amounts were\nincluded in the Electric Plant in Service (FERC Account 101). On January 11, 2010, FERC issued\nOpinion No. 505 in FERC Docket No. ER07-956-00 and ordered the Company to transfer the\namounts above from Account 101 to FERC Account 114, Electric Plant Acquisition Adjustments.\nHe also pointed out that the costs were included in ETI's filed rate base amounts in Docket Nos.\n34800 and 37744. 193 Mr. Considine contended that these amounts should remain in rate base\nbecause they represent costs incurred by ETI for the purchase of a viable asset that benefits its retail\ncustomers. He pointed out that the amounts have previously been included in the Company's rate\nbase, but the only thing that has changed is that the amounts were previously allocated to a different\naccount. ETI argues that the fact that the costs were approved as part of rate base in two previous\nETI dockets verifies that they were \"reasonable, prudently incurred, and properly capitalized.\" 194\n\n\n190\n      Staff Ex. l (Givens Direct) at 3 l-32.\n191\n      ETI Ex. 3 at Sched.

Staff points\nout that those two prior dockets were settled rate cases and, therefore, \"provide no illumination on\nthis issue.\" 198 Finally, Staff argues that ETI failed to prove either element of the Commission's two-\npart Hooks test for the determination of whether the acquisition adjustment should be included in\nrate base. Pursuant to the Hooks test, in determining whether an acquisition adjustment should be\nincluded in rate base, \"the Commission should consider whether or not the purchase price was\nexcessive and whether or not specific and offsetting benefits have accrued to ratepayers.\" 199\nAccording to Staff, ETI' s acquisition adjustment should be disallowed because the Company failed\nto meet it burden of proof on these two issues. 200\n\n\n           The AU s are unpersuaded by the arguments of Staff and Cities. Their primary argument\n(i.e., that acquisition adjustments are simply not allowed as an addition to rate base for ratemaking\npurposes) is incorrect. Indeed, the Hooks decision, the precedent on which Staff relies for its\nfallback argument, suggests that, more often than not, acquisition adjustments should be included in\n\n\n195\n      ETI Ex. 46 (Considine Rebuttal) at 5.\n196\n      Staff Ex.

As\ndiscussed more fully in Section V.H. of this PFD, above, there is ample evidence in the record to\ndemonstrate that the Spindletop Facility is used and useful and provides specific and offsetting\nbenefits to ratepayers in a cost-effective manner. The evidence further shows that the acquisition\nadjustment represents costs that were actually incurred by ETI in the furtherance of acquiring the\nSpindletop Facility, and not a mere mark-up in original cost. For these reasons, the ALls conclude\nthat the $1,127,778 incurred by ETI in internal acquisition costs associated with the purchase of the\nSpindletop Facility was reasonable, necessary, and properly incurred. Accordingly, the ALl s agree\nthat it should be included in ETI' s rate base.\n\n\nK.        Capitalized Incentive Compensation\n\n          In the application, some of the incentive payments ETI made to its employees were\ncapitalized into plant in service accounts and ETI asks to include those amounts in rate base.202 A\nportion of those capitalized accounts represents payments made by ETI for incentive compensation\ntied to financial goals (financially-based incentive compensation). Cities contend that, consistent\nwith Commission precedent, ETI ought not be allowed to include in rate base the portion of its\ncapitalized incentive compensation that is attributable to financially-based               incentive\ncompensation. 203 The issue of whether financially-based incentive compensation is recoverable as a\nportion of Operating Expenses is discussed at length in Section VII.D.2. of this PFD. ETI makes the\nsame arguments in favor of recoverability in that section that it makes here as to the inclusion of\nfinancially-based incentive compensation in rate base. The discussion of that issue need not be\nrepeated here, but the analysis is the same. In summary, the ALls conclude that ETI should not be\nentitled to recover its financially-based incentive compensation costs. Thus, for the same reasons\n\n\n201\n      Hooks (emphasis added).\n202\n      Cities Ex. 2 (Garrett Direct) at 52.\n203\n      Id. at 52-53.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                               PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                      PAGE72\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ndiscussed in Section VIl.D.2, the Al.Js agree with Cities' contention that the portion of ETI's\nincentive payments that are capitalized and that are financially-based should be excluded from ETI' s\nrate base.\n\n\n          On the other hand, the Al.Js disagree with Cities as to the amount of that exclusion. Cities\nargue that $9,835, 111 (Cities' estimate of ETI' s financially-based incentive payments that are\ncapitalized each year into plant in service) should be removed from rate base. 204 Broadly speaking,\nETI has two categories of incentive compensation programs - annual incentive programs, and long-\nterm incentive programs. To arrive at the figure of$9,835,1 l l, Cities' witness Garrett assumed that:\n(1) 100 percent of the costs of the long-term incentive programs were financially-based and,\ntherefore, should be excluded from rate base; and (2) his calculated percentage of the annual\nincentive programs were financially-based and, therefore, should be excluded from rate base. He\nthen applied those percentages to the incentive costs that ETI capitalized in 2008, 2009, and the\nportion of 2010 prior to the Test Year. 205\n\n\n          As explained in Section VII.D.2., the AUs agree that Mr. Garrett was correct to recommend\nremoving 100 percent of the cost of ETI' s long-term incentive programs. However, as to the annual\nincentive programs, he defined what qualifies as \"financially based\" much too broadly, and therefore\nwrongly assumed that his calculated percentage of the costs of those programs should be excluded.\nInstead, the Al.J s conclude that the actual percentages should be used to determine the amount that is\nfinancially based. 206\n\n\n           Finally, ETI challenges Mr. Garrett's attempt to disallow capitalized incentive costs from\n2008 through June 30, 2009.\n\n\n           Much of the rate base that Mr. Garrett seeks to disallow (namely, costs from 2007\n           through June 30, 2009) is not presented for review in this rate case. Rather those\n           costs were presented for review in the Company's last rate case, Docket No. 37744,\n\n204\n      Id. at 52-53; Cities Initial Brief at 27.\n205\n      Cities Ex. 2 (Garrett Direct) at 53 and MG-2.10.\n206\n      See discussion in Section VII.D.2.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                              PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                  PAGE73\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          in which the Company presented capital additions for the period of April 1, 2007,\n          through June 30, 2009 .... Even though Docket No. 37744 was a settled case, the\n          final order concluded that '[b ]ased on the evidence in this docket, the overall total\n          invested capital through the end of the test year meets the requirements in PURA §\n          36.053(a) that electric utility rates be based on original cost, less depreciation of\n          property used and useful to the utility in providing service.' This conclusion goes\n          beyond merely settling issues without deciding anything and should be construed as\n          to be conclusive as to the reasonableness of capital costs at issue in that prior case. 207\n\n          The ALls agree. The Test Year for ETI's prior ratemaking proceeding ended on June 30,\n2009. The reasonableness of ETI' s capital costs (including capitalized incentive compensation) was\ndealt with by the Commission in that proceeding and is not at issue here. Thus, the ALls conclude\nthat exclusion of capitalized incentive compensation that is financially-based can only be made for\nincentive costs that ETI capitalized during the period from July 1, 2009 (the end of the prior Test\nYear) through June 30, 2010 (the commencement of the current Test Year). The amount of the\nexclusion is not specifically known at this time.\n\n\n       VI.    RATE OF RETURN [Germane to Preliminary Order Issue Nos. 4and11]\n\nA.        Capital Structure\n\n          ETI's capital structure is 50.08 percent debt and 49.92 percent equity. No party has taken\nissue with ETI's capital structure. Therefore, the ALls recommend that the Commission enter an\norder finding that the appropriate capital structure for ETI is 50.08 percent debt and 49.92 percent\nequity.\n\n\nB.        Return on Equity\n\n          The United States Supreme Court has set forth a minimum constitutional standard governing\nequity returns for utility investors:\n\n\n          From the investor or company point of view it is important that there be enough\n          revenue not only for operating expenses but also for the capital costs of the business.\n          These include service on the debt and dividends on the stock. By that standard the\n\n207\n      ETI Initial Brief at 44, quoting Docket No. 37744, Order at CoL 10 (Dec. 13, 2010).\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                     PAGE74\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n        return to the equity owner should be commensurate with returns on investments in\n        other enterprises having comparable risks. That return, moreover, should be\n        sufficient to assure confidence in the financial integrity of the enterprise, so as to\n        maintain its credit and to attract capital. 208\n\nThus, a utility must have a reasonable opportunity to earn a return that is: (1) commensurate with\nreturns on equity investments in enterprises having comparable risks; (2) sufficient to ensure the\nfinancial soundness of the utility's operations; and (3) adequate to attract capital at reasonable rates,\nthereby enabling it to provide safe, reliable service. The allowed ROE should enable the utility to\nfinance capital expenditures at reasonable rates and to maintain its financial flexibility during the\nperiod in which the rates are expected to remain in effect.\n\n\n        1. Proxy Group\n\n        Because ETI is not a publicly traded company, it is necessary to establish a group of\ncompanies that are publicly traded and that are comparable to ETI in certain fundamental business\nand financial respects to serve as its \"proxy\" in the ROE estimation process. Both financial theory\nand legal precedent support the use of comparable companies within a proxy group to determine a\nutility's ROE, and all of the ROE witnesses in this case have relied on proxy groups to estimate a\nrequired ROE for ETI.\n\n\n        ETI witness Hadaway started with all the vertically integrated electric utilities that are\nincluded in the Value Line Investment Survey (Value Line). To improve the group's comparability\nwith ETI, which has a senior secured bond ratings of BBB+ (Outlook Negative) from Standard &\n\n\n\n208\n    Federal Power Comm'n v.

The return should be reasonably\nsufficient to assure confidence in the financial soundness of the utility and should be adequate, under efficient\nand economical management, to maintain and support its credit and enable it to raise the money necessary for\nthe proper discharge of its public duties.\").\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                      PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE75\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nPoor's (S&P) and Baa2 (stable) rating from Moody's Investors Service (Moody's), Dr. Hadaway\nimposed the following restrictions:\n\n\n•   comparable companies had to have senior secured bond ratings of at least BBB by S&P or Baa\n    by Moody's;\n\n•   comparable companies had to derive at least 70 percent of revenues from regulated utility sales;\n\n•   comparable companies had to have consistent financial records not affected by recent mergers or\n    restructuring; and\n\n•   comparable companies had to have a consistent dividend record with no dividend cuts or\n    resumptions during the past two years.\n\nThose selection criteria resulted in a 23-utility proxy group.\n\n\n        State Agencies witness Miravete excluded Entergy from his proxy group, but otherwise his\nproxy group was identical to ETI' s.        Cities witness Parcell ran his calculations using both\nDr. Hadaway' s 23-utility proxy group and another 8-utility proxy group, but they produced similar\nROE results. TIEC witness Gorman used the same 23 utility proxy group as ETI witness Hadaway\nused.\n\n\n        Staff witness Cutter was the only witness to use a different proxy group. He used a 13 utility\nproxy group for his discounted cash-flow (DCF) analysis. To arrive at this proxy group, Mr. Cutter\nstarted with all of the domestic electric-utility companies tracked by Value Line because Value Line\nis the most widely used, independent investment service in the world.        Then he eliminated the\nutilities that did not meet the following criteria:\n\n\n•   Value Line Financial Strength ratings of A+, A or B++;\n\n•   A capital structure including less than 45 percent, or more than 55 percent, debt;\n\n•   Total capitalization in excess of five billion dollars;\n\n•   No recent dividend cuts or omissions;\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                       PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE76\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n•   No recent or potential merger activities or other major capital expansion; and\n\n•   No Value Line appraisal of being outside the norm.\n\nOn his final analysis, Mr. Cutter eliminated three of his 13 utility proxy group, referring to those he\neliminated as \"outliers.\" ETI points out, however, that one of the remaining ten companies, Con Ed,\nis not comparable to ETI because it is a delivery company as opposed to a vertically integrated\nutility. ETI' s essential criticism of Mr. Cutter's proxy group analysis is that he should have used a\nlarger proxy group and that he admitted a better comparison to ETI could be obtained from using a\nlarger proxy group.\n\n\n       2. DCF Analysis\n\n       To analyze ETI's cost of equity capital, all of the testifying experts first performed a DCF\nanalysis. The DCF approach is based on the theory that a stock's current price represents the present\nvalue of all expected future cash flows. In its most general form, the DCF model is expressed as\nfollows:\n\n\n                                                D1           D2     D 00\n                                     Po   = (1 + k) + (1 + k) + (1 + k)\n\nWhere Po represents the current stock price, D1 • ••• Doo are all expected future dividends, and k is\nthe expected discount rate, or required ROE. That equation can be simplified and rearranged to\nascertain the required ROE:\n\n\n                                                D(l   + g)\n                                           k=                +g\n                                                     Po\n\n\nWhere Po represents the current stock price, Dis expected future dividends, g is the growth rate, and\nk is the expected discount rate, or required ROE.\n\n\n       This is commonly referred to as the \"Constant Growth DCF' model in which the first term is\nthe expected dividend yield and the second term is the expected long-term growth rate. The\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                               PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE77\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nConstant Growth DCF model requires assumptions of: (1) a constant growth rate for earnings and\ndividends; (2) a stable dividend payout ratio; (3) a constant price-to-earnings multiple; and (4) a\ndiscount rate greater than the expected growth rate.\n\n\n          ETI witness Hadaway' s DCF analysis was based on three versions of the DCF model. In the\nfirst version of the DCF model, he used the constant growth format with long-term expected growth\nbased on analysts' estimates of five-year utility earnings growth. In the second version of the DCF\nmodel, for the estimated growth rate, Dr. Hadaway used only the long-term estimated gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) growth rate. In the third version of the DCF model, Dr. Hadaway used a two-stage\ngrowth approach, with stage one based on Value Line's three-to-five-year dividend projections and\nstage two based on long-term projected growth in GDP. The dividend yields in all three of the\nannual models are from Value Line's projections of dividends for the coming year and stock prices\nare from the three-month average for the months that correspond to the Value Line editions from\nwhich the underlying financial data are taken. 209\n\n\n          The DCF results for Dr. Hadaway' s comparable company group using the traditional constant\ngrowth model indicated an ROE of 9. 90 percentto 10.00 percent. Dr. Hadaway then recalculated the\nconstant growth results with the growth rate based on long-term forecasted growth in GDP. With the\nGDP growth rate, the constant growth model indicates an ROE range of l 0.40 percent to\n10.70 percent. Although the GDP growth rate is higher than the average of analysts' growth rates,\nDr. Hadaway testified that his GDP estimate is within the analysts' range and slightly below the\n6.00 percent 3-to-5 year average growth rate projection from Value Line. Finally, Dr. Hadaway's\nmultistage DCF model indicated an ROE range of 10.20 percent to 10.30 percent. The results from\nthe DCF model, therefore, indicate an ROE range of 9. 90 percentto 10. 70 percent.210 In his rebuttal,\nDr. Hadaway updated his ROE analysis using current market conditions but employing the same\nmethodologies that he used in his previous analysis.

According to the intervenors, these excessive growth rates exaggerate future\ncash flows, which results in an inflated ROE.\n\n\n           Intervenors argue that Dr. Hadaway' s Analysts' Constant Growth DCF model produces\nexcessive return estimates.212 In rebuttal, Dr. Hadaway's analysts' growth model produced a\n10.1 percent group average ROE and a 10.0 percent group median ROE. 213 The intervenors contend\nthat the group average long-term growth rate on which his DCF study was based was 5.62 percent,\nwhich is far too high to be sustainable in the long-term (as required as an input in the Constant\n                           214\nGrowth DCF model).               According to intervenors, the excessive level of his growth rate is apparent\nby comparison to current analysts' projected growth for U.S. GDP, which range from 4.5 percent to\n5.0 percent. 215 Dr. Hadaway's growth rate is more than 60 basis points above the most generous\nexpected growth of the U.S. economy. Intervenors contend that that nominal GDP should be the\nceiling of a reliable proxy for a utility dividend growth rate. Because the evidence shows that\nnominal GDP as projected by consensus analysts, the Executive Branch, and the Congressional\nBudget Office is 5 percent, Dr. Hadaway' s 5.62 percent growth rate is excessive and undermines the\nreasonableness of his models.\n\n\n           Intervenors criticize Dr. Hadaway's decision on rebuttal to exclude Edison International in\n                     216\nhis proxy group.           Dr. Hadaway did so because Edison International's ROE of 5.2 percent was\nbelow a 5.07 percent cost of debt based on an average of Triple B utility rates for the time period\n\n211\n      Id. at 44.\n212\n      TIEC Ex. 2 (Gorman Direct) at 39.\n213\n      ETI Ex. 52 (Hadaway Rebuttal) at Ex.

Rather, Dr. Hadaway forecasts\nfuture GDP growth using his own personal calculation that forecasts GDP by examining historic\nGDP growth over the last 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60-year periods and weighting those averages. 219\nIntervenors note that this approach was rejected by the Commission in the Oncor rate case. 220\n\n\n            Staff witness Cutter used the DCF model to project ETI' s cost of equity. Under Mr. Cutter's\nview, the theory underlying the DCF model is that the price of a share is equal to the present value of\nall future earnings. Unless the stock is sold for a profit (or loss) from the price it was originally\npurchased, the only way to determine earnings on a share is to determine its future dividends. This\nrequires, in Mr. Cutter's opinion, an understanding of investors' current expectations of growth of\nthose dividends. The issue is the growth expectation that investors have embodied in the current\nprice of the stock. According to Mr. Cutter, the best way to arrive at a reliable growth estimate of\nthose dividends is to use the growth estimates of investment advisory firms rather than the estimates\nof a single, independent analyst. 221\n\n\n            Mr. Cutter used both Value Line and Zacks Investment Service (Zacks) in ascertaining\nlong-term earnings growth rates. He used Value Line because it is the most widely used independent\n\n\n211   Id.\n218\n      Tr. at 227-228.\n219\n      ETI Ex. 6 (Hadaway Direct) at Ex.

The average analysts' growth rate was 4.94 percent. 223\nAccording to TIEC, ETI does not claim that a constant growth model using analysts' growth rates is\ninappropriate and argues that Dr. Hadaway failed to offer any rebuttal testimony criticizing\nMr. Gorman's Analysts' Growth DCF model.\n\n\n          Mr. Gorman also performed a constant growth DCF model using sustainable growth rates.\nHis average sustainable growth rate for the proxy group was 4.54 percent and produced a proxy\ngroup average and median DCF result of 8.91 percent and 8.9 percent, respectively. 224 According to\nTIEC, a sustainable growth rate is based on the percentage of a utility's earnings that are retained and\nreinvested in utility plant and equipment. 225\n\n\n          Mr. Gorman also performed a multi-stage DCF model to reflect changing growth\nexpectations that would reflect the possibility of non-constant growth for a company over time.\nMr. Gorman's multi-stage model reflected three growth periods: (1) a short-term growth period of\nfive years; (2) a transition period for years six through ten; and (3) a long-term growth period,\nstarting in year 11 through perpetuity. For the short-term period, Mr. Gorman relied on the\nconsensus analysts' growth projections from his constant growth DCF model (i.e., 4.94 percent).

For the\nlong-term period, he assumed the maximum sustainable growth rate for a utility company as proxied\nby the consensus analysts' projected growth rate for the U.S. GDP (i.e., 5.0 percent). The result of\nhis multi-stage growth DCF model was an average ROE of 9.37 percent and a median of\n9.48 percent. 226\n\n\n           Cities witness Parcell calculated the DCF results for each company in his proxy group by\nusing and considering five indicators of growth expectations consisting of: (i) 2007 -2011 earnings\nretention; (ii) five-year historical average earnings per share, dividends per share, and book value per\nshare; (iii) projected earnings retention; (iv) projected EPS, DPS, BVPS; and (v) projected EPS as\nreported by Yahoo Finance. Using this in his DCF model resulted in an ROE of 9.0 percent to\n9 .5 percent. 227\n\n\n           OPC witness Szerszen' s DCF analysis used the same group of 23 comparable companies\nincluded in Dr. Hadaway's DCF analysis.                Dr. Szerszen's DCF analysis was framed with\nconsideration of ETI' s financial integrity as discussed by the major bond rating agencies, the current\nand projected interest rate environment, and investment analyst views of the regulated utility\nsector. 228 Interest rates are currently very low, as reflected in the yields to maturity and interest rates\non various fixed income investments. OPC contends, in contrast to Dr. Hadaway, that utility stocks\nhave been less volatile than the stock market in general.2 29 This is confirmed by Value Line's\nDecember 23, 2011, observation that \"electric utility stocks have long been viewed as a safe haven in\nvolatile markets, due in large part to their generous dividend yields.\"230 Dr. Szerszen also took\nexception to Moody's characterization of ETI as having above average business and regulatory risk.\nMoody's assessment is primarily based on the lack of pass-through regulatory lag-reducing cost\n\n226\n      TIEC Ex. 2 (Gorman Direct) at 19, Ex.

Dr.\nSzerszen testified that ETI may not have a formula rate plan similar to the Louisiana and Mississippi\nEntergy operating companies, but it does have a Distribution Cost Recovery Factor (DCRF) and\nTransmission Cost Recovery Factor (TCRF) available that \"will allow ETI to charge ratepayers for\nadditional distribution and transmission investments outside of a traditional rate request filing.\"231\nNone of Entergy' s other operating companies have TCRF and DCRF riders. OPC notes that Cities\nwitness Parcell agrees that the availability of such recovery mechanisms affects ETI' s level of risk;\nhe testified that a combination of ETI' s fuel factor rider, TIC rider, energy efficiency rider, hurricane\ncost recovery rider, rate case expense rider, proposed increased customer service charge, and DCRF\nand TCRF riders results in about 30 percent of ETI' s total overall requested revenue requirement\nbeing subject to revenue risk and regulatory lag. 232\n\n\n          Dr. Szerszen incorporated two different dividend yield calculations in her DCF model. The\nfirst calculation estimated a dividend yield using 2011 average stock prices and 2012 projected\ndividend rates for each company, and the second calculation incorporated more recent March 5,\n2012, closing prices for the comparables. The average dividend yield using 2011 average stock\nprices was 4.66 percent and, using March 5, 2012, closing prices, was 4.32 percent.233\n\n\n          Dr. Szerszen provided some practical examples of how blind reliance on analyst earnings\ngrowth projections can lead to questionable DCF growth rates. At least five of the comparable utility\ncompanies had five-year earnings growth rate projections that ranged from 8.5 percent to 11 percent.\nDr. Szerszen stated that she was unaware of any regulated utility company that has consistently\nachieved such high earnings growth rate over the past 28 years, and that it is reasonable to assume\nsuch performance is unlikely in the longer term future. Dr. Szerszen's review of the comparable\ncompany past and projected growth rates resulted in a reasonable dividend growth rate expectation of\n3.9 percent to 5 percent.

For the\ncommonly used 90 day averaging period, the capitalization-weighted average ROE is 9.23 percent.\nEvaluating the averaging period at either 30or180 days produces ROE estimates of9.24 percent and\n9.34 percent, respectively. Dr. Miravete weighed the computations by the capitalization of each firm\nto correct the effect of each variable according to the relative market value of the corresponding\nutility. According to Dr. Miravete, this approach avoids the distortion caused by adding numerous,\nbut possibly irrelevant, firms that may produce biased estimates. Dr. Miravete conceded that the\neffect of ignoring differences in scale of utilities in the determination of the ROE is substantial. He\nacknowledged that if he had ignored the differences in size of these electric utilities, his DCF ROE\nestimate would have been 9 .68 percent. 235\n\n\n           3. Risk Premium Analysis\n\n           Dr. Hadaway's risk premium studies are divided into two parts. First, he compared electric\nutility authorized ROEs for the period 1980-2010 to contemporaneous long-term utility interest rates.\nThe differences between the average authorized ROEs and the average interest rate for the year is the\nindicated equity risk premium. He then added the indicated equity risk premium to the forecasted\nand current triple-B utility bond interest rate to estimate ROE. 236\n\n\n           In calculating the equity risk premium, Dr. Hadaway adjusted for the inverse relationship\nbetween equity risk premiums and interest rates (when interest rates are high, risk premiums are low\nand vice versa). Dr. Hadaway provided regression analyses of the allowed annual equity risk\npremiums relative to interest rate levels. The negative regression coefficients confirm the inverse\n\n\n234\n      Id. at 22.\n235\n      State Agencies Ex. 1 (Miravete Direct) at 12-13.\n236\n      ETI Ex. 6 (Hadaway Direct) at 36-38, 45.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                               PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE84\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nrelationship between equity risk premiums and interest rates according to ETI. Dr. Hadaway used\nthat negative interest rate change coefficient in conjunction with current and forecasted interest rates\nto establish the appropriate ROE. 237 Staff witness Cutter agreed that the risk premium analysis needs\nto reflect this adjustment. 238\n\n\n           The results of Dr. Hadaway' s initial equity risk premium studies indicate an ROE range of\n10.00 percent to 10.01 percent. ETI states that these results reflect the sharp drop in interest rates\nthat have occurred for high quality borrowers. The Federal Reserve System's continuing \"easy\nmoney\" policies have provided renewed liquidity in the credit markets that is reflected in these lower\nyields. These models, however, cannot capture the current equity volatility or the increased level of\nrisk aversion for equity investors. These circumstances indicate that the cost of equity has not\ndeclined to the extent that interest rates on utility debt have dropped. Thus, Dr. Hadaway testified\nthat the results of the risk premium analysis must be discounted and more emphasis placed on the\n                   239\nDCF analysis.\n\n\n           In his rebuttal, Dr. Hadaway updated his ROE analysis using current market conditions but\nemploying the same methodologies that he used in his previous analysis. 240 His updated risk\npremium analysis was an ROE of 10.38 percent using projected triple-B utility interest rates and\n9.96 percent using current triple-B utility interest rates. 241\n\n\n           TIEC contends that Dr. Hadaway' s utility risk premium analysis is flawed for two primary\nreasons. First, Dr. Hadaway developed a forward-looking risk premium model that relied on\nforecasted interest rates and volatile utility spreads that are uncertain and produce inaccurate results.\nAs Mr. Gorman testified, it is more reasonable at this time to rely on current observable interest rates\nrather than forecasted projections. Over the last several years, forecasted yield projections have\n\n\n237\n      ETI Ex. 6 (Hadaway Direct) at 45-46, Ex.

Mr. Gorman testified that \"a relative investment risk differential cannot be measured\nsimply by observing nominal interest rates.\"244 He noted:\n\n\n          While academic studies have shown that, in the past, there has been an inverse\n          relationship with these variables, researchers have found that the relationship changes\n          over time and is influenced by changes in perception of the risk of bond investments\n          relative to equity investments, and not simply changes to interest rates. 245\n\n          As described in Mr. Gorman's testimony, correcting Dr. Hadaway's models for the\nelimination of this inverse relationship adjustment puts Dr. Hadaway' s risk premium in the range of\n8.5 percent to 10 percent, with a midpoint of 9.3 percent. 246\n\n\n          Staff witness Cutter's \"conventional risk premium estimate\" estimated the cost of ETI's\nequity by comparing the costs of equity authorized for utilities across the United States to the yields\nof large-company corporate bonds that are rated Baa by Moody's within the timeframe of 1980\nthrough 2011. This risk premium approach relies on the historical relationship between two indices\n\n\n\n242\n      TIEC Ex. 2 (Gorman Direct) at 42-43; OPC Ex. !(Szerszen Direct) at 27-28.\n243\n      TIEC Ex. 2 (Gorman Direct) at 42-43; see also ETI Ex. 6 (Hadaway Direct) at Ex.

He tested the data by performing a\nregression analysis, which showed with high confidence that there is a trend in the relationship. It is\nan inverse trend, in which the risk premiums increase as bond yields decrease. On average, from\n1980 to 2011, risk premiums increased 0.4207 percent for every 1.00 percent that bond yields\n              248\ndecreased.\n\n\n          The calculation of the adjustment to the risk premium that the regression analysis indicated\nwas incorporated in Staffs analysis. The results of this risk premium analysis produced a cost of\nequity of 9.81 percent. 249\n\n\n          Mr. Gorman' s risk premium analysis produced an ROE estimate in the range of 9.2 percent to\n9 .4 percent, with a midpoint estimate of approximately 9 .3 percent. His risk premium model was\nbased on two estimates of an equity risk premium. First, he estimated the difference between the\nrequired return on utility common equity investments and U.S. Treasury bonds for the period 1986\nthrough 2011, which produced an equity risk premium of 5.23 percent. The second equity risk\npremium estimate was based on the difference between regulatory commission-authorized returns on\ncommon equity and contemporary \"A\" rated utility bond yields for the period 1986 through 2011,\nwhich produced an equity risk premium of 3.8 percent. Mr. Gorman testified that \"[t]he equity risk\npremium should reflect the relative market perception of risk in the utility industry today.\" 250\n\n\n\n\n247\n      Staff Ex. 6 (Cutter Direct) at 10, 19.\n248\n      Staff Ex. 6 (Cutter Direct) at 20.\n249\n      Id. at 20, Attachment SC-6.\n250\n      TIEC Ex. 2 Gorman Direct) at 26.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                               PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                          PAGE87\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nAccordingly, to gauge investor expectations he examined the yield spread between utility bonds and\nTreasury bonds over the last 32 years. 251\n\n\n           According to TIEC, this analysis showed that the current utility bond yield spreads over\nTreasury bond yields are lower than the 32-year average spreads, which is evidence that \"the market\nconsiders the utility industry to be a relatively low risk investment and demonstrates that utilities\ncontinue to have strong access to capital.\"252 Mr. Gorman then added a projected long-term Treasury\nbond yield to his estimated equity risk premium over Treasury yields, which produced a common\nequity in the range of 8.2 percent to 9.95 percent. Due to unusually large yield spreads between\nTreasury bond and \"Baa\" utility bond yields, Mr. Gorman gave two-thirds weight to his high end risk\npremium of 9.95 percent and one-third weight to his low-end risk premium of 8.2 percent, which\nproduced an equity risk premium of 9 .4 percent. He also added his equity risk premium over utility\nbond yields to the current 13-week average yield on \"Baa\" rated utility bonds for the period ending\nMarch 2, 2012, of 5.05 percent. Adding his equity risk premium of 3.03 percent to 4.62 percent to\nthe bond yield of 5 .05 percent, produced an ROE in the range of 8.08 percent to 9 .67 percent, which\nhe then weighted more heavily on the high end estimate to produce a recommendation of\n9 .2 percent. 253\n\n\n           The primary criticism that Dr. Hadaway lodged against Mr. Gorman' s risk premium analysis\nwas that Mr. Gorman did not adjust his analysis upward to reflect a purported inverse relationship\nbetween equity risk premiums and interest rates. 254 For example, Dr. Hadaway's risk premium\nanalysis adjusted his risk premium results by 1.56 percent to account for this relationship. 255\n\n\n           OPC witness Szerszen also performed a risk premium analysis, using Dr. Hadaway' s study of\nhistorical authorized electric company allowed returns on equity and average bond yields.

Giving more weight to the 2001-2010 risk premiums\nshown in Dr. Hadaway's exhibit results in an average risk premium of 4.21 percent. This yields an\n8.88 percent to 9.38 percent risk premium derived cost of equity based on the current 4.67 percent\nand projected 5.17 percent bond yields, according to Dr. Szerszen's analysis.2s 7\n\n\n           4. Comparable Earnings\n\n           Cities witness Parcell also performed a Comparable Earnings analysis. According to\nMr. Parcell, the Comparable Earnings method is derived from the \"corresponding risk\" standard of\nthe Bluefield and Hope cases. This method is thus based upon the economic concept of opportunity\ncost. The cost of capital is an opportunity cost: the prospective return available to investors from\nalternative investments of similar risk. 258\n\n\n           The Comparable Earnings method is designed to measure the returns expected to be earned\non the original cost book value of similar risk enterprises. Thus, according to Mr. Parcell, this\nmethod provides a direct measure of the fair return, because the Comparable Earnings method\ntranslates into practice the competitive principle upon which regulation is based. 259\n\n\n           The Comparable Earnings method normally examines the experienced and/or projected\nreturns on book common equity. The logic for examining returns on book equity follows from the\nuse of original-cost, rate-base regulation for public utilities, which uses a utility's book common\nequity to determine the cost of capital. This cost of capital is, in tum, used as the fair rate of return\nwhich is then applied (multiplied) to the book value of rate base to establish the dollar level of\n\n\n256\n      ETI Ex.

Mr. Parcell stated that this technique is thus consistent\nwith the rate base methodology used to set utility rates. 260\n\n\n            Mr. Parcell conducted the Comparable Earnings methodology by examining realized returns\non equity for several groups of companies and evaluating the investor acceptance of these returns by\nreference to the resulting market-to-book ratios. He testified that in this manner it is possible to\nassess the degree to which a given level of return equates to the cost of capital.\n\n\n            Mr. Parcell's Comparable Earnings analysis is based on market data (through the use of\nmarket-to-book ratios) and is thus essentially a market test. As a result, he testified that his analysis\nis not subject to the criticisms occasionally made by some who maintain that past earned returns do\nnot represent the cost of capital. In addition, he stated that his analysis uses prospective returns and\nthus is not confined to historical data. 261\n\n\n            Mr. Parcell' s Comparable Earnings analysis considered the experienced equity returns of the\nproxy groups of utilities for the period 1992-2011 (i.e., the last twenty years). His Comparable\nEarnings analysis required an examination of a relatively long period of time to determine trends in\nearnings over at least a full business cycle. Further, in estimating a fair level of return for a future\nperiod, it is important to examine earnings over a diverse period of time to avoid any undue influence\nfrom unusual conditions that may occur in a single year or shorter period. Therefore, in forming his\njudgment of the current cost of equity he focused on two periods: 2002-2011 (the recent business\ncycle) and 1992-2001 (the prior business cycle). 262\n\n\n            Based on the recent earnings and market-to-book ratios, Mr. Parcell' s Comparable Earnings\nanalysis indicated that the cost of equity for the proxy utilities is no more than 9.5 percent to\n10.0 percent (9.75 percent mid-point). Recent returns of 10.0 percent to 12.1 percent have resulted\nin market-to-book ratios of 143 and greater. Prospective returns of9.5percentto10.3 percent result\n\n\n260   Id.\n261\n      Cities Ex. 3 (Parcell Direct) at 29.\n262\n      Id. at 30.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                             PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                         PAGE90\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nin anticipated market-to-book ratios of over 125. As a result, it is apparent that returns below this\nlevel would result in market-to-book ratios of well above 100. According to Mr. Parcell, an ROE of\n9.5 percent to 10.0 percent should thus result in a market-to-book ratio of well over 100 .263\n\n\n          5. CAPM Analysis\n\n          The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a risk premium approach that estimates the ROE\nfor a given security as a function of a risk-free return plus a risk premium to compensate investors\nfor the non-diversifiable, or systematic, risk of that security. The CAPM formula is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nWhere Ke equals the required market ROE; f3 equals the Beta of an individual security; r1equals the\nrisk free rate of return; and rm equals the required return on the market as a whole. In this equation,\n(rm - r1) represents the market risk premium. According to the theory underlying the CAPM, because\ndiversifiable risk can be diversified away, investors should be concerned only with non-diversifiable\nrisk, which is measured by Beta. In effect, Beta represents the risk of the particular security relative\nto the market as a whole.\n\n\n          Only Staff witness Cutter, Cities witness Parcell, and State Agencies witness Miravete used\nthe CAPM methodology to estimate ETI's ROE.\n\n\n          Mr. Cutter used CAPM in the qualitative analysis of ETI' s cost of equity. He did not directly\nuse the CAPM in the determination of ETI' s cost of equity because it yielded a cost of equity that\nwas over 200 basis points lower than the lower of the other two estimates, while those other two\nestimates were less than half a percent apart from each other. 264 The CAPM provides an additional\nindication that a significant drop to the estimated costs of equity that Staff made in prior dockets is\n\n\n\n\n263\n      Cities Ex. 3 (Parcell Direct) at 31-32.\n264\n      Staff Ex. 6 (Cutter Direct) at 21.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE91\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nappropriate because the CAPM estimate is lower than either of the two other approaches even when\nadjusted for the current low yield on Treasury Bonds. 265\n\n\n            Mr. Cutter testified that the CAPM is one of the cornerstones of financial theory. 266 In its\nsimplest sense, the model describes the relationship between the risk of an asset and its expected\nreturn, and assumes that investors will not hold a risky asset unless they are adequately compensated\nfor the risk. 267\n\n\n            In this case, without any adjustment to the way it has been used in recent rate cases at the\nCommission, the CAPM yielded a cost of equity for ETI of 6.93 percent. Mr. Cutter testified that\naspects of the capital markets today were likely causing the CAPM's cost of equity estimate to be\nlow. Specifically, the Federal Reserve System is following an aggressive policy designed to keep the\nyields of both short-term and long-term Treasury bonds low. This policy influences two of the three\nvariables used in the CAPM formula to be lower, which, in tum, makes the CAPM's final estimate\nof ETI' s cost of equity lower. 268\n\n\n            To account for the impact of this aggressive Federal Reserve System policy, Mr. Cutter made\ntwo adjustments to his CAPM analysis. First, Mr. Cutter adjusted the risk-free rate variable in the\nCAPM because it is most influenced by current Federal Reserve System policy. By changing this\nvariable to 3.7 percent (which is the average yield from 1926 through 2010 of the risk-free rate's\nproxy security, U.S. Treasury Bills), the CAPM's estimate of ETI's cost of equity increased from\n6.93 percent to 7.92 percent, or by 99 basis points. 269\n\n\n            The second adjustment to the CAPM result that Mr. Cutter made to account for the current\naggressive Federal Reserve System policy was to the risk premium, which is also particularly\n\n\n265   Id.\n266   Id.\n261   Id.\n268\n      Staff Ex. 6 (Cutter Direct) at 21-24.\n269\n      Id. at 24.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE92\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nsensitive to Federal Reserve System policy. By using the difference between the averages of the\nyield of long-term government bonds and the yield of large company stocks between 1926and2010,\nthe effect of Federal Reserve System policy on the risk premium was significantly diluted.\nMr. Cutter found that because the CAPM estimate of ETI' s cost of equity was excessively low, even\nwith adjustments for Federal Reserve System policy, it would be appropriate to further adjust it by\nmultiplying the unadjusted estimate plus two times the effect of adjusting the risk-free rate, or:\n6.93 percent+ (2 * 0.99 percent)= 8.91 percent. 270 It is important to note, however, that Mr. Cutter\nused the CAPM analysis only as a qualitative check on its DCF and risk premium analyses, not as an\nindependent source of analysis.\n\n\n          Although Cities witness Parcell did perform a CAPM analysis, he does not employ the\nCAPM results in arriving at his 9.0 percent to 10.0 percent range of results. 271\n\n\n          State Agencies witness Miravete used the daily average of the yield of the ten-year Treasury\nbond between December 1, 2011, and March 2, 2012, as reported by the Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System, as his risk-free return in his CAPM model. He used Value Line's most\nrecent betas for the regulated utilities included in the proxy group. Dr. Miravete corrected the betas\nby substituting an average between their value and LO to recognize that markets trend towards\nlong-term equilibrium because these regulated utilities were able to attract investors during the most\ntroubled times, which indicates that the perceived market risk of these utilities is lower than for other\nfirms. Dr. Miravete's capitalization-weighted average CAPM ROE is 7.64 percent on a 90 days\naveraging period, with a range between 7.64 percent (30 days) and 8.28 percent (180 days).\nDr. Miravete characterizes these estimates as low relative to those of the DCF model because of the\nlow yields of Treasury bonds after the implementation of the quantitative easing monetary policy\nover the past two years. 272\n\n\n\n\n270\n      Id. at 21, 24-25.\n271\n      Cities Ex. 3 (Parcell Direct) at 3, 25-28.\n272\n      State Agencies Ex. 1 (Miravete Direct) at 19-21.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                     PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE93\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n       6. ALJs' Analysis\n\n       Given the detail, time, and effort that went into the various experts' testimony on this issue,\none might easily conclude that the development of an estimated ROE is a precise science. But, as\nacknowledged by virtually all experts on the subject, estimating the cost of equity is not an exact\nscience but rather a result of informed judgment.\n\n\n       The first question that must be addressed is the appropriate proxy group. There were\nessentially only two competing views on this issue- one presented by Dr. Hadaway and the other by\nMr. Cutter. The ALJs have reviewed the evidence and the arguments of both sides with respect to\nthe composition of the proxy group. Although Staff's proxy group could, in some respects, be\nconsidered more comparable to ETI than Dr. Hadaway' s larger group, the Al.J s do not believe that\nthis overcomes the flaws inherent in such a small group. In the end, a group of nine companies,\nwhile comparable, simply does not provide a robust enough sample to create a valid group for\ncomparison. The Al.J s therefore find that the 23 utility group selected by ETI witness Hadaway is\nthe appropriate proxy group.\n\n\n       The next issue is the core issue to be decided: the appropriate ROE for ETI. The experts in\nthis case testified to the following ROE ranges or estimates, depending on the calculation\nmethodology employed:\n\n\n           Witness/Analvsis                   Ranee           Ultimate Recommendation\n      Hadaway - DCF                       9.9 10.7                       10.6\n      Hadaway - Risk Premium              9.96 10.38\n                                                                                             -\n      Cutter-DCF                          7.46-10.71                        9.6\n      Cutter - Risk Premium               9.81\n      Cutter - CAPM                       8.91\n\n      Gorman-DCF                          9.3-9.7                           9.5\n      Gorman Risk Premium                 9.2-9.4\n\n      Parcell - DCF                       9.0 9.5                           9.5\n      Parcell - Comparable Earnings       9.5-10.0\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                             PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE94\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n               Witness/Analysis                   Ranee        Ultimate Recommendation\n         Szerszen - DCF                       8.32 9.32                   9.3\n         Szerszen - Risk Premium              9.3\n\n         Miravete - DCF                       9.23-9.34                     9.3\n         Miravete CAPM                        7.64- 8.28\n\nJust focusing on the ultimate ROE recommendations, it is clear that there is a fairly tightly grouped\nrange when considering Staff and the intervenors. This ranges from a low of 9 .3 percent to a high of\n9 .6 percent. The range expands when it is considered that Staff witness Cutter did not contest ETI' s\nassertion that Staffs DCF recommended ROE would be 10.0 percent if he had used the same proxy\ngroup as the other witnesses. 273 The ALls believe that the criticisms leveled at Dr. Hadaway's ROE\nrecommendation are generally correct, certainly to the point that the ultimate recommendation is so\nhigh as to be an outlier. The ALJ s conclude that the proper range of acceptable ROEs would be from\n9.3 percent to 10.0 percent. This is actually confirmed by ETI's own witness, Mr. Barrileaux, who\ntestified that, from a cash flow metric standpoint, an ROE of 9.99 percent would provide \"a\nreasonable outcome that balances debt and equity financing.\" 274\n\n\n          The mid-point of the range discussed above is 9.65 percent. There has been a tremendous\namount of testimony about the unsettled economic conditions facing utilities and the effect of those\nconditions on the appropriate ROE. The ALJs believe that this is an effect that must be taken into,\naccount, and that the effect would be to move the ultimate ROE towards the upper limits of the range\ndetermined to be reasonable. In this case, the ALJ s find that the reasonable adjustment would be\n15 basis points, moving the reasonable ROE to 9.80 percent. Accordingly, the ALls recommend that\nthe Commission find that 9.80 percent is the appropriate ROE for ETI.\n\n\n\n\n273\n      Tr. at 1795.\n274\n      ETI Ex. 44 (Barrileaux Rebuttal) at 5, Ex.

Purchased Power Capacity Expense [Germane to Supplemental Preliminary Order\n          Issue No.1]\n\n          One of the most hotly contested issues in this case concerned the appropriate size of ETI' s\npurchased power capacity costs (PPCCs). In order to understand this issue, it is necessary to\nunderstand some background relative to how ETI obtains and uses power generation capacity.\n\n\n          1. The Sources of ETI's Purchased Power\n\n          The Entergy System Agreement is a FERC-approved tariff that mandates that the Operating\nCompanies operate as a single, integrated system. 276 The System Agreement's essential function is\nto provide the contractual basis for the planning, construction, and operation of generation and\n\n275\n      ETI Ex. 5 (Barrilleaux Direct) at 37.\n276\n      ETI Ex. 30 (Jaycox Direct) at 5-6; ETI Ex. 39 (Cicio Direct) at 6-10.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE96\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ntransmission resources in an economic and reliable manner. By jointly planning and operating their\nelectric systems, the Operating Companies believe they are able to aggregate their loads and jointly\ndispatch their resources to serve that load using the lowest cost resources available from all of the\nOperating Companies, resulting in lower total costs than the total cost of each Operating Company\nplanning and operating separately. Another function of the Entergy System Agreement is to provide\na basis for the equalization among the Operating Companies of any imbalances of costs arising from\nthe construction, ownership, or operation of facilities that are used for the collective benefit of all\nEntergy Operating Companies. 277\n\n\n          To provide reliable service, ETI must have sufficient generation capacity to meet the\nmaximum demands imposed on its system. Some of this generation capacity (approximately\n1,200 MW) is generating plants owned and operated by ETI. 278 The remainder of ETI' s capacity\ncomes from four types of purchased capacity: (1) capacity purchases from third parties; (2) capacity\npurchases from other Entergy affiliates through \"legacy affiliate contracts\" under MSS-4;\n(3) capacity purchases from other Entergy affiliates through \"other affiliate contracts\" under MSS-4;\nand (4) capacity purchases from the Entergy system through reserve equalization payments under\nMSS-1. 279 MSS-1 and MSS-4 are schedules included in the Entergy System Agreement which set\nout complex mathematical formulas whereby the various Operating Companies can equalize and\nshare the costs of power capacity among themselves. 280 These four sources of purchased capacity are\ninversely related to one another: the more ETI purchases from one source, the less it needs to\npurchase from the others. 281\n\n               ~   Capacity Purchases from Third Parties\n\n          Third-party capacity contracts are contracts that the system has allocated in whole or part to\nETI.      ETI has contracted to purchase capacity from a number of third parties, including\n\n277\n      ETI Ex. 39 (Cicio Direct) at 6, 8-10, 11-30.\n278\n      Tr. at 1539-40.\n279\n      ETI Ex. 34 (Cooper Direct) at 20-21; Tr. at 1901; ETI Initial Brief at 71.\n280\n      ETI Ex. 39 (Cicio Direct) at PJC-1, pp. 30 and 62.\n281\n      Tr. at 1946-47.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE97\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nConocoPhillips-SRW, Dow Pipeline, Frontier, Calpine-Carville, and Sam Rayburn Municipal Power\nAgency (SRMPA). Since 2009, ETI has been in the process of substantially increasing its reliance\nupon third party purchases of capacity. During the Rate Year, it plans to more than double the\namount of capacity it purchases from third parties as compared to the amount it purchased during the\n               282\nTest Year.\n\n\n            Since the Test Year, Entergy has been engaged in an effort to increase ETI's long-term power\ncapacity through dealing with third parties. It has entered into a number of agreements in that regard:\n\n\n•      In 2009, it entered into a ten-year purchased power agreement with Calpine Energy Services\n       (Calpine) to purchase 485 MW of capacity from Calpine's Carville Energy Center (Carville\n       Contract). Purchases pursuant to the Carville Contract will commence during the Rate Year, on\n       June 1, 2012, and 50 percent of this contract is allocated to ETI. 283\n\n•      During the Period from July 2009 through June 2011, the Company executed an agreement with\n       NRG for a 75 MW one-year call option, with a delivery period that began on March 1, 2011, and\n       100 percent of this contract is allocated to ETI. 284\n\n•      During the Period from July 2009 through June 2011, the Company executed a three-year\n       agreement with Dow Pipeline for 100 MW capacity, with a delivery period that began on April 1,\n       2011, and 100 percent of this contract is allocated to ETI. 285\n\n•      During the Period from July 2009 through June 2011, the Company executed a 25-year\n       agreement with SRMPA for 225 MW, with a delivery period beginning on December 1, 2011,\n       and 100 percent of this contract is allocated to ETI. ETI contends that the SRMPA contract will\n       be beneficial because it provides \"much-needed long-term base load capacity at an economically\n       attractive price.\"286\n\n\n\n\n282\n      ETI Ex. 34 (Cooper Direct) at 23; see also ETI Init.

The legacy affiliate purchases are made under\nMSS-4. 290\n\n\n               »     Capacity Purchases from Other Entergy Affiliates Through \"Other\" Affiliate\n                     Contracts Under MSS-4\n\n           \"Other affiliate contracts\" refers to all affiliate contracts other than legacy contracts whereby\nETI purchases capacity and associated energy from other Operating Companies. 291 The other\naffiliate purchases are also made under MSS-4. 292 Among others, in 2009 ETI entered into a new\naffiliate contract with Entergy Arkansas, Inc. (EAI) for wholesale base load resources (the EA WBL\nContract), whereby ETI was allocated 31. 7 percent of 336 MW capacity. 293\n\n\n\n287\n      Tr. 1937-38.\n288\n      ETI Ex. 34 (Cooper Direct) at 24.\n289\n      Tr. at 1112-13, 1940-41.\n290\n      ETI Ex. 39 (Cicio Direct) at 24-26.\n291\n      ETI Ex. 34 (Cooper Direct) at 21.\n292\n      ETI Ex. 39 (Cicio Direct) at 24-26.\n293\n      Cities Ex. 6 (Nalepa Direct) at 13-14.\n\f                                                                                                     ..~-·-----\n\n\n\n\nSOAH DOCKET N O . -                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE99\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n              ~   Capacity Purchases from the Entergy System Through Reserve EqualizaJion\n                  Payments Under MSS-1\n\n          Reserve Equalization payments are made under MSS-1. In any given month, some of the\nOperating Companies might be \"long\" on the amount of generating capacity they own (meaning that\nthey own more capacity than they need) while others might be \"short\" on capacity (meaning they\nown less capacity than they need). In such a month, the long Operating Companies would receive\n                                                                                      294\nMSS-1 payments from the short Operating Companies for use of their capacity.\n\n\n          2. ETl's Request Regarding PPCCs\n\n          During the Test Year, ETI had total PPCCs of $245,432,884. 295 In the application, however,\nETI is not seeking to recover its Test Year expenses. Rather, it is asking to recover roughly\n$276 million, which represents the Company's anticipated PPCCs in the Rate Year. 296 In other\nwords, ETI is seeking roughly $31 million more than its actual Test Year expenses. ETI derived this\nestimate based largely upon what it believes will the purchased power agreements in place during the\nRate Year. 297\n\n\n          As the following tables illustrate, ETI projects that, during the Rate Year, the total quantity,\nand the relative quantities purchased from each source, will differ substantially from its Test Year\npurchases.\n\n\n                        Test Year vs. Rate Year Power Capacity Quantities\n                                         (MW-Months)298\n                         Purchase                Test Year        Rate Year\n                  Third Party Purchases            5,884            12,834\n\n\n\n294\n      ETI Ex. 39 (Cicio Direct) at 11-13; Cities Ex. 4 (Goins Direct) at 13.\n295\n      TIEC Ex. 1 (Pollack Direct) at Ex.

Moreover, while the purchases pursuant to MSS-4 will remain fairly stable, the\nthird-party purchases will substantially increase, with a somewhat corresponding decrease for\npurchases pursuant to MSS-1. In other word, ETI' s plan is to become \"less short\" (on capacity)\nrelative to the other Operating Companies in the Rate Year than it was in the Test Year.\n\n\n          ETI contends that the shift toward more third party purchases is part of its effort to develop a\nmore diverse, modern, and efficient portfolio of generation supply resources, both to serve current\ncustomer needs and to serve anticipated load growth. This, in turn, will lower energy costs and result\nin savings for customers. 301\n\n\n\n\n299\n      Cities Ex. 12.\n300\n      Cities now agree that the correct amount for the Test Year is $245,432,884.

They make a number of arguments against ETI' s proposal.\n\n\n                         (a) The PPCCs Requested by ETI Are Not Known and Measurable\n\n           First, they contend that ETI' s Rate Year forecast cannot be considered known or measurable.\nStaff points out that the four3° 5 components from which ETI purchases power are interrelated, such\nthat, \"when ETI adds capacity under one element, such as through third party contracts, the other\ncomponents, such as ETI's MSS-1 payments, will decrease.\"306 Staff describes each of the\ncomponents comprising ETI' s PPCC Rate Year forecast as being \"infected\" with numerous\nassumptions. 307 For example, ETI necessarily made projections, rather than relying upon actual\npayments, when it estimated what it will pay for third-party contracts in the Rate Year. 308 Many of\n\n302\n      Tr. at 1954; Cities Ex. 4 (Goins Direct) at 14.\n303\n      TIEC Init.

Nevertheless, ETI simply assumed it would pay the maximum amount possible under\neach of its third party contracts, and disregarded any of the contractual factors that might reduce its\nRate Year payments. 309 Thus, the intervenors contend that ETI's cost estimates for third party\npurchased power are merely projections, as opposed to known and measurable changes. 310\n\n\n           Similarly, ETI' s contractual agreements with its affiliate Operating Companies require ETI to\nmake assumptions about their future costs. The contracts do not definitively fix prices or quantities.\nRather, prices and quantities under the contracts will fluctuate based on the specific operational\nconditions actually experienced by the various Operating Companies during the Rate Year. 311 The\nultimate determination of payments made in the Rate Year will be calculated based upon the\ncomplex mathematical formula set out in schedule MSS-4. That formula contains a great number of\nvariables. ETI had to make assumptions about each one of those variables in order to estimate its\nRate Year costs. 312 The intervenors point to ETI' s new contract with EAi (the EA WBL Contract) as\nevidence of the \"inherently speculative nature\" of ETI' s PPCCs request.              According to the\nintervenors:\n\n\n•      the EA WBL Contract was signed on April 11, 2012 (only days before the hearing in this matter\n       commenced); purchases will not commence under the contract until January 1, 2013;\n\n•      pricing under the contract will be determined in 2013 pursuant to the complex formula contained\n       inMSS-4;\n\n•      the quantity of capacity ETI ultimately purchases under the contract will be based on a yet-to-be-\n       determined allocation percentage between ETI and the other Operating Companies;\n\n•      the contract itself may never go into effect because it is contingent upon ETI receiving all\n       necessary \"regulatory approvals\" before August 1, 2012; and\n\n\n309\n      Tr. at 704-05.\n310\n      TIEC Initial Brief at 29-30; Staff Initial Brief at 26.\n311\n      Tr. at 606.\n312\n      See Staff Initial Brief at 27; Tr. 606.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE103\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n•     if it does go into effect, it will still be subject to at least two further revisions before any power is\n      received by ETI under the contract. 313\n\n\nThe EA WBL Contract accounts for more than one-third of ETI' s upward adjustment to its Test Year\nPPCCs. The intervenors contend that, in order for ETI to arrive at its forecasted PPCCs for the Rate\nYear, it had to make myriad assumptions as to the future values of the many variables in the EA\nWBL Contract (and the other affiliate contracts). 314 Therefore, the intervenors argue that ETI' s cost\nestimates for its contractual agreements with its affiliate Operating Companies are merely\nprojections, as opposed to known and measurable changes. 315\n\n\n          ETI' s estimated costs for its MSS-1 payments also require assumptions about the future. In\norder to calculate its future reserve equalization responsibilities using the complex formula set out in\nMSS-1, ETI had to forecast its own future loads, along with the future loads of all the other\nOperating Companies. If those assumptions prove to be wrong, then ETI' s actual MSS-1 costs will\nbe different than as projected in the application. 316 It is noteworthy, according to the intervenors, that\nETI projected the future load growths of all the Operating Companies when it calculated its projected\nRate Year MSS-1 costs because, elsewhere in ETI' s evidence, the Company has taken the position\nthat future projected loads should not be considered known and measurable. 317 Staff argues:\n\n\n          ETI cannot have it both ways. It cannot claim load growth to be speculative in one\n          context, and then claim that it can forecast with absolute certainty the respective load\n          growths for each EOC on the Entergy System. 318\n\nTIEC points out that ETI' s estimated MSS-1 payments \"were still changing on the eve of the\nhearing.\"319 In the following exchange, even ETI witness Phillip May, one of the Company's\n\n\n313\n      ETI Ex. 47 (Cooper Rebuttal) at RRC-R-1, and Tr. at 628-9.\n314\n   Staff Initial Brief at 27-28. Staff makes the further point that, because the EA WBL Contract was executed\nonly days before the hearing, Staff has been unable to determine whether the contract is even a prudent one.\n315\n      TIEC Initial Brief at 30-32; Staff Initial Brief at 27-28.\n316\n      Tr. at 651-52.\n317\n      Tr. at 1907; see also Staff Initial Brief at 28; TIEC Initial Brief at 27-28.\n318\n      Staff Initial Brief at 29; see also TIEC Initial Brief at 37.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                              PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                      PAGE 104\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nprimary witnesses regarding its PPCCs, seems to have conceded that the Company's MSS-1\nprojections are not known and measurable:\n\n\n           Q:       Do you think that the projection ... of rate year sales that is implicit in the\n                    calculation of MSS-1 costs ... is a known and measurable change?\n           A:       I think that there is some uncertainty with regard to that projection, yes, sir. 320\n\nIn sum, the intervenors contend that ETI' s cost estimates for all components of purchased power in\nthe Rate Year are merely projections, as opposed to known and measurable changes. 321\n\n\n                         (b) The PPCCs Requested by ETI Violate the Matching Principle\n\n           Second, the intervenors acknowledge the principle that Test Year expenses may be adjusted\nfor known and measurable changes. However, they contend that such adjustments can only be made\nwhere the attendant impacts on all aspects of a utility's operations (including revenue, expenses, and\ninvested capital) can with reasonable certainty be identified, quantified, and matched.322 They assert\nthat ETI' s proposed adjustment does not satisfy this matching principle. The intervenors complain\nthat ETI is improperly attempting to \"compare apples to oranges\" by mixing a forecast of future Rate\nYear PPCCs with actual Test Year billing determinants. As explained by Cities witness Nalepa,\n\"[u]nder the company's approach of mixing estimated rate year costs with test year billing units,\nthere is a failure to recognize customer growth and increased sales revenue - thus overstating the\nrevenue requirement.\"323 The argument, essentially, is that the various new or expanded contracts\nthat ETI has entered into were executed so that, in whole or in part, ETI would be able to meet future\ndemand, but that ETI is seeking to recover the costs of those new contracts from its existing\ncustomers. 324\n\n\n\n319\n      TIEC Initial Brief at 28.\n320\n      Tr. at 1918-19.\n321\n      TIEC Initial Brief at 27-28; Staff Initial Brief at 29.\n322\n      Cities Ex. 6 (Nalepa Direct) at 12, citing P.U.C.

Assume that, during the Test Year, Utility X had 100 billing units and $500 of PPCCs. Also\nassume that, during the Rate Year, Utility X had 200 billing units and $1,000 of PPCCs. If Utility X\nwere limited to setting its rates based solely on its Test Year numbers, then it would recover\nprecisely the right amount to cover its PPCCs in both the Test Year (100 billing units x $5 per unit=\n$500 of PPCCs) and in the Rate Year(200 billing units x $5 per unit= $1,000 of PPCCs). If, on the\nother hand, Utility X were allowed to set its rates based upon it billing units from the Test Year(lOO)\nand its PPCCs from the Rate Year ($1,000), then Utility X would unfairly recover twice the amount\nneeded to cover its actual PPCCs in the Rate Year (200 billing units x $10 per unit= $2,000). 325\nThus, intervenors contend that ETI' s load growth must be taken into account if PPCCs are to be\nbased on Rate Year projections. 326 They point out that ETI itself expects steady load growth in the\nnext few years, 327 and experienced \"good\" growth over the two years preceding the Test Year. 328\n\n\n           For its part, ETI denies that its increased capacity has been obtained in order to meet load\ngrowth. Rather, it contends that it has added capacity in order to be \"less short\" in comparison to the\nother Operating Companies. 329 Moreover, ETI contends that the load growth adjustments proposed\nby intervenors are \"uncertain and unnecessary.\" 330\n\n\n                       (c) ETl's Proposal Would Preclude Prudence Review\n\n           Third, TIEC contends that ETI' s future Rate Year proposal would set rates based on\nprojections without any effective Commission review of: (1) what the actual expenditures under\n\n\n\nBrief at 35-39.\n325\n      Cities Ex. 4 (Goins Direct) at 16-17.\n326\n      Cities Ex. 4 (Goins Direct) at 17; see also TIEC Ex. 23.\n327\n      Cities Ex. 4 (Goins Direct) at 17; Tr. at 706.\n328\n      Tr. at 130.\n329\n      ETI Initial Brief at 68-69.\n330\n      Id. at 69.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE106\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\npurchased capacity contracts turn out to be; (2) whether those expenditures turn out to be reasonable;\nand (3) whether the future contracts were prudent. 331\n\n\n          4. The Intervenors' Recommendations Regarding PPCCs\n\n          The intervenors agree that the amount requested by ETI is unreasonable, excessive, and\nshould be rejected. They do not universally agree, however, about what the proper number for\nPPCCs should be. Staff, TIEC, and State Agencies argue that ETI' s PPCCs should be set at the\namount of the Company's Test Year PPCCs: $245.4 million. This position is best summarized by\nStaff:\n\n\n          Staff recommends that the Commission adhere to traditional ratemaking principles\n          and set the amount of ETI' s purchased power expenses based on what the Company\n          actually experienced during its test year. During its test year, ETI had total purchased\n          power capacity expenses of $245.4 million. This amount is not in dispute. This\n          amount is known. This amount is measurable. The Commission should utilize this\n          amount to set just and reasonable rates for ETI and its ratepayers. 332\n\n           Rather than recommending Test Year PPCCs, Cities offer two alternatives - one\nrecommended by its witness Dr. Dennis Goins, and another recommended by its witness\nMr. Nalepa. 333       Dr. Goins recommends that ETI be allowed to recover PPCCs of roughly\n$242.9 million. 334 This amount is roughly $33 million less than ETI's requested amount and\n$3 million less than ETI' s actual Test Year costs. To arrive at this amount, Dr. Goins made several\ncalculations. First, he adjusted the average perkW cost of ETI' s legacy and other affiliate purchases\nusing cost data from November 2010 through October 2011, which is slightly more current data than\nthat relied upon by ETI. 335 Second, as to MSS-4 costs, because the EA WBL contract is set to expire\nsooner than the three years he assumed ETI' s new rates will be in effect, Dr. Goins \"normalized\" the\n\n\n\n331\n      TIEC Initial Brief at 33-35.\n332\n      Staff Initial Brief at 29.\n333\n      Cities Initial Brief at 40.\n334\n      Cities Ex. 6 (Nalepa Direct) at 17, and Errata No. 3.\n335\n      Cities Ex. 4 (Goins Direct) at 17-18.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                              PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                       PAGE107\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ncosts of the EA WBL contract over the three year period. 336 Finally, he adjusted the Rate Year total\nPPCCs estimate to reflect the effects of load growth, based upon ETI forecasts. 337\n\n\n           Mr. Nalepa took a slightly different approach. He recommended that ETI be allowed to\nrecover PPCCs of $236,838,634, or roughly $39 million less than ETI' s requested amount and\n$8 million less than ETI's Test Year costs. 338 To arrive at this amount, Mr. Nalepa first calculated\nthe per kW cost of ETI's third party Rate Year capacity and applied it to ETI's Test Year-end\ncapacity. In this way, \"the increased cost of the new resources is recognized, but current demand is\nbetter matched to current resources.\"339 Second, he made the same adjustment as Dr. Goins as to\nMSS-4 costs due to the EA WBL contract. 340\n\n\n           TIEC explains it is reluctant to \"descend into the rabbit hole and engage in ratemaking based\non prognostications, estimates, projections, and assumptions about what may happen in the\nfuture.\" 341 If the Commission were to do so, however, TIEC argues that the final result would be\nlower than the Test Year PPCCs, not higher. TIEC' s witness Jeffry Pollock calculated the impact of\nprojected unit prices based upon ETI' s projections, and he eliminated the expiring EA WBL\nContract. His result, which TIEC is not advocating, would allow ETI to recover PPCCs of $238.8\nmillion, roughly $7 million less than its Test Year costs. 342\n\n\n           ETI describes the proposals made by TIEC and Cities as \"extreme\" and contrary to common\nsense. 343 For example, Mr. Pollock's calculations indicate that ETI' s MSS-1 costs would increase by\nroughly $5 million, while its third-party and affiliate contracts would slightly decrease. ETI argues\n\n\n336\n       Cities Ex. 4 (Goins Direct) at 18; Cities Ex. 6 (Nalepa Direct) at 15-16.\n337\n       Cities Ex. 4 (Goins Direct) at 18- l 9.\n338\n       Cities Ex. 6 (Nalepa Direct) at 17.\n339\n       Cities Ex. 6 (Nalepa Direct) at 12-13.\n3\n 4-0   Id. at 15-16.\n341\n       TIEC Initial Brief at 41.\n342\n       TIEC Ex. 1 (Pollack Direct) at 25-27; TIEC Initial Brief at 41-42.\n343\n       ETI Initial Brief at 83.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                             PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                 PAGE 108\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nthat this is the opposite of reality. By adding capacity through third party contracts, its reliance upon\nthe other purchased power components, especially MSS-1, will necessarily decline, not increase. 344\nETI also argues that load growth is inherently uncertain and should not be taken into account. 345\n\n\n          5. The ALJs' Analysis Regarding PPCCs\n\n          The AU s conclude that ETI failed to meet its burden to prove that the adjustment it seeks to\nits Test Year PPCCs is known and measurable. The known and measurable standard is an exception\nto the actual data contained in the Test Year. The point of a historical Test Year is to review actual\ncosts, which include the ups and downs of what actually occurred. As to a forecast of the Rate Year,\nby contrast, the evidence demonstrates that the costs attributable to a particular contract to purchase\ncapacity cannot currently be known because there are so many variables that will play into the\namount ETI ultimately pays. As stated above, ETI' s third party contracts lack fixed prices and the\namounts ETI will pay could fluctuate based upon factors such as required availability and\nperformance. ETI simply assumed it would pay the maximum amounts under those contracts, and\ndisregarded the contractual factors that could lower the payment amounts. Yet this assumption runs\ncounter to ETI' s historical experience with its contracts. 346 Similarly, ETI' s affiliate contracts do not\nfix prices or quantities, and the amount ETI ultimately pays will fluctuate based upon operational\nconditions experienced by all of the Operating Companies during the Rate Year. Those operational\nconditions obviously cannot be known at this time. Both the affiliate contracts under MSS-4 and the\nequalization payments under MSS-1 are based upon highly complex mathematical formulae that\nutilize numerous variables. Any of the variables could change during the Rate Year, thereby altering\nthe amounts paid by ETI under affiliate contracts or MSS-1. As a result, the evidence demonstrates\nthat there could be a substantial difference between ETI' s projected Rate Year costs and what\n\n\n\n\n344\n      Id. 83.\n345\n      Id. 84.\n346\n      Tr. at 705.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                          PAGE 109\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nactually ends up occurring. ETI asks the Commission to trust it that these differences would be\n\"small,\"347 but provides no evidence as to what small means.\n\n\n          The efforts made by ETI, Cities, and TIEC to forecast Rate Year PPCCs further illustrate the\ndifficulty of deviating from actual Test Year data in an area that involves so many future\ncontingencies and unknowns. Those forecasts swung wildly- ETI estimated Rate Year PPCCs that\nwere $31 million more than the Test Year, while the Cities' and TIEC's estimates came in at $3\nmillion, $8 million, and $7 million less than the Test Year, respectively. Indeed, even Cities' own\nwitnesses disagreed substantially among themselves as to what the proper amount should be.\nMoreover, arguably ETI could not even agree with itself regarding the proper amount because, in its\nInitial Brief, it suggested that a reduction of roughly $4.5 million might be warranted to account for\nits latest projection of its MSS-1 costs in the Rate Year. 348\n\n\n          The ALls are similarly convinced that ETI's request violated the matching principle by\nmixing its forecast of future Rate Year PPCCs with Test Year billing determinants. It is logically\ninconsistent for ETI to have, on the one hand, based its estimate of Rate Year MSS-1 costs on its\nprojections of the load growths of ETI and all the other Operating Companies and, on the other hand,\nargue that load growth cannot be considered known and measurable when calculating its overall\nPPCCs. This argument does not withstand scrutiny, especially in light of tJ:ie fact that ETI clearly\nbelieves its load will be larger in the Rate Year than it was in the Test Year and it has, in fact,\ncontracted for six percent more load in the Rate Year. 349\n\n\n          Simply put, the intervenors presented substantial evidence that all of the components of ETI' s\npurchased power capacity contain significant variability and uncertainty in costs, thereby leading to\nthe conclusion that estimates of Rate Year PPCCs cannot be considered known and measurable. For\nthis reason, the ALls recommend that ETI's PPCCs request be rejected. In its place, the ALls\nrecommend that ETI be allowed to recover its Test Year PPCCs of $245,432,884.\n\n347\n      ETIInitial Brief at 81.\n348\n      ETI Initial Brief at 77 (citing Tr. at 684, 1945).\n349\n      ETI Ex. 47 (Cooper Rebuttal) at 4; Tr. at 667-68.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE 110\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nB.         Transmission Equalization (MSS-2) Expense\n\n           The Entergy system transmission grid is a large, integrated transmission network that is\noperated for the mutual benefit of all of the Entergy Operating Companies. 350                Service\nSchedule MSS-2 is a FERC jurisdictional tariff that equalizes the ownership costs of certain high\nvoltage transmission facilities among ETI and the other Operating Companies, so that each\nOperating Company pays its just and reasonable share of those costs. Accordingly, those costs are\nreferred to as \"transmission equalization\" payments. 351 MSS-2 generally applies to equalization of\ntransmission costs for transmission assets of 230 kV and larger. 352\n\n\n           In any given month, some of the Operating Companies might be \"long\" on the amount of\ntransmission capacity they own (meaning that they own more capacity than they need) while others\nmight be \"short\" on capacity (meaning they own less capacity than they need). In such a month, the\nlong Operating Companies would receive MSS-2 payments from the short Operating Companies for\nuse of their transmission facilities. 353 Over the course of the Test Year, ETI was short, meaning that\nit paid a total of $1,753,797 in MSS-2 payments to various other Operating Companies. 354\n\n\n           In the application, rather than seeking to recover only the $1.7 million in Test Year MSS-2\ncosts, ETI is seeking to recover roughly $10.7 million, which represents its anticipated MSS-2\nexpenses in the Rate Year. 355 The additional $9 million that ETI seeks is based on the Company's\nestimates of transmission construction projects that are expected to have been completed by or\nduring the Rate Year which will result in changes to the relative transmission line ownership ratios\nbetween the Operating Companies. In other words, ETI expects that, by or during the Rate Year, its\nownership share under the MSS-2 will decrease relative to the other Operating Companies (as the\n\n\n350\n      Tr. at 450, 793.\n351\n      Tr. at 724; ETI Ex. 39 (Cicio Direct) at 15-17 and PJC-1at38.\n352\n      Tr. at 450-51, 73 l.\n353\n      Tr. at 731, 735.\n354\n      Tr. at 723-24, 737; Cities Ex. 28.\n355\n      Tr. at 452-53, 738, 760.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE Ill\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ntransmission capacity owned by the other Operating Companies increases), thereby driving the\namount of ETI's MSS-2 payments upward. 356\n\n\n            The increase is driven by ETI's prediction that $184.9 million in additional transmission\ncapacity will be built by other Operating Companies by the end of the Rate Year. ETI identified six\nconstruction projects that are either underway or approved for construction and which, collectively,\nwill account for roughly $141 million of the predicted $184.9 million in additional transmission\ncapacity. Of those six projects, one was completed and went into service on December 16, 2011,\nafter the end of the Test Year. The other five are either under construction or still in the planning\nphase and are currently scheduled to go into service on dates ranging from June 29, 2012, to\nDecember 31, 2012. 357 According to ETI, the remaining $43.9 million of the $184.9 million in\nadditional transmission capacity is derived from \"an estimate of the capital investment necessary to\nmaintain equalizable [i.e. MSS-2 qualifying] transmission investments across the Entergy\nTransmission System.\"358 The estimate is based upon the Operating Company's projected budgets\nand historical spending patterns for maintenance of transmission facilities. 359\n\n\n            Staff, State Agencies, TIEC, and Cities all oppose ETI's effort to recover $10.7 million in\nMSS-2 expenses. The parties make a number of arguments. First, they point out that MSS-2 utilizes\na complex mathematical formula to calculate each Operating Company's liability (or credit) under\nthe equalization process. There are a great number of variables that are used in the formula, such as\nthe amount of investments made by each Operating Company in transmission facilities, the costs of\ncapital for each Operating Company, the size of the load demanded by each Operating Company, and\nthe amount of state and federal taxes paid by each Operating Company. Changes to any of these\nvariables can change the amount ETI owes (or is due) pursuant to MSS-2. 360 Moreover, these\nvariables relate not only to ETI, but to all of the Operating Companies. Indeed, Cities calculate that,\n\n356\n      Tr. at 775-77.\n357\n      ETI Ex. 59 (McCulla Rebuttal) at 2 and MFM-R-1; Tr. at 456-58.\n358\n      ETI Ex. 59 (McCulla Rebuttal) at 3.\n359   Id.\n360\n      ETI Ex. 39 (Cicio Direct) at PJC-1 at 38-43; Tr. at 454-55.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                      PAGE 112\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nto perform the MSS-2 calculation, at least 360 \"mini-forecasts\" must be made, only 60 of which\nrelate to ETI. 361 As explained by TIEC witness Pollock, any effort to estimate future amounts of\nthese many variables \"is susceptible to a host of uncertainties.\" 362 The intervenors argue that for ETI\nto arrive at its estimate of$10.7 inMSS-2 costs duringthe Rate Year, the Company had to speculate\nas to what the many MSS-2 variables would be in the Rate Year. In other words, they contend that\nETI's estimate of its future MSS-2 costs cannot possibly be considered \"known and measurable\"\nand, therefore, is not recoverable. 363 State Agencies and Staff liken ETI's attempt to obtain an\nMSS-2 adjustment for not-yet-complete construction projects to an impermissible request to recover\nthe costs of CWIP without having to meet PURA's burden of proving that recovery is necessary to\nprotect the utilities financial integrity. 364\n\n\n           Second, the parties oppose ETI's effort to recover its predicted MSS-2 expense in the Rate\nYear point out that the primary driver of the increased costs over the Test Year comes from a number\nof transmission projects that have not yet come into service, and are still in the planning or\nconstruction phase. ETI concedes that if the projects do not actually come into service at the\ncurrently estimated times, then the Company's estimates of its MSS-2 costs during the Rate Year\nwill be inaccurate. 365 Thus, Staff contends that ETI's projections about future MSS-2 costs cannot\nbe considered known and measurable. 366 Moreover, TIEC and Staff contend that ETI is effectively\nseeking higher rates based upon expenses associated with projects that are not yet completed and,\ntherefore, the projects cannot be considered ''used and useful.\"367 As explained by TIEC:\n\n\n\n\n361\n      Cities Reply Br. at 68-69.\n362\n      TIEC Ex. 1 (Pollock Direct) at 29.\n363\n   Staff Initial Brief at 31; State Agencies Initial Brief at 11-13; TIEC Initial Brief at 44-45; Cities Initial Brief\nat44.\n364\n   State Agencies Initial Briefat 12 (citing PURA§ 36.054; P.U.C.

For this reason, the Commission\n          has typically followed the policy that proper ratemaking requires that a utility actually\n          build the transmission infrastructure suggested by its projections, and then seek to\n          account for that investment on a historical basis in a future rate case. In Docket\n          No. 28906, for example, the Commission held that LCRA' s projections of future\n          transmission investment did not support a finding that its projected capital needs\n          satisfied the known and measurable test. It is similarly unreasonable for ETI to make\n          a post-test year adjustment associated with transmission projects that are not serving\n          any of its customers and that may or may not impact ETI' s transmission equalization\n          expense, depending on when the projects are finally completed. 368\n\n          Third, in addition to the six transmission projects that are under development, another driver\nof the increased costs over the Test Year comes from ETI' s estimate that $43 .9 million will be spent\nto maintain transmission investments across the Entergy Transmission System. The intervenors\ncontend that ETI has provided little to no evidentiary support for this estimate. State Agencies and\nCities also point out the unfairness of allowing ETI to begin recovering $10. 7 million per year in its\nrates immediately based upon new transmission facilities, even though many of those new facilities\nwill not come into service (and ETI will therefore not incur higher MSS-2 payments for those\nfacilities) for many months. 369\n\n\n          Fourth, Cities points out that Entergy and the various Operating Companies have announced\na plan to sell all of their transmission assets to a third party. That process is currently underway. The\nevidence suggests that, if and when that transaction is complete, ETI's MSS-2 expenses will\ndisappear. 370\n\n\n          Finally, TIEC argues that there is no need to grant ETI's request for a pro Jonna adjustment\nto its test year MSS-2 expenses because the Company can avail itself of a TCRF if its Rate Year\n\n368\n      TIEC Initial Brief at 47 (citing Docket No. 28906, Order at 6).\n369\n      State Agencies Initial Brief at 12; Cities Initial Brief at 45.\n °\n37\n     Cities Reply Brief at 67-68; Tr. at 113-14; Cities Ex. 4 (Goins Direct) at 20-21. Admittedly, if these\nexpenses disappear, ETI will still have to bear transmission expenses. However, it is impossible to know, at\nthis time, what those expenses would be.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                    PAGE 114\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ncosts deviate substantially from its Test Year costs. Thus, if it turns out that ETI experiences an\nincrease in its MSS-2 expenses during the Rate Year, the utility has cost recovery mechanisms at its\ndisposal that could make it whole in a timely manner.\n\n\n           Staff and State Agencies argue that only $1.7 million (representing ETI's actual Test Year\nexpenses) should be approved in this proceeding. TIEC witness Pollock recommends approving a\nslight upward adjustment to account for the fact that ETI's MSS-2 expenses were substantially\nhigher in the second six months of the Test Year than they were in the first six months. Mr. Pollock\nand TIEC recommend a pro Jonna adjustment equal to twice the amount of MSS-2 payments\n                                                                                       371\nincurred by ETI in the second six months of the Test Year, or $2. 7 million.\n\n\n           Cities' witness Goins presented yet another alternative. Dr. Goins proposes to adjust the\nprojected Rate Year costs for known expenses incurred after the Test Year. He proposed reducing\nthe adjusted Rate Year MSS-2 expense to a Test Year level by applying a load growth adjustment\nusing ETI' s own projected load growth as a benchmark indicator of the reasonable anticipated level\nof growth. (Cities invoke essentially the same \"matching principle\" argument regarding load growth\nthat they raised with respect to PPCCs). The result of Dr. Goins' adjustment would be to would\nallow ETI to recover $4,103,850 in MSS-2 expenses. 372\n\n\n           ETI responds to these arguments on a number of fronts. It contends that the main driver of\nchanges in MSS-2 expenses is the relative amount of equalizable transmission investment in the\ntransmission system by ETI and the other Operating Companies, compared to their proportionate\nresponsibility for that investment, based on each company's responsibility ratio. 373 ETI argues that\nthe other elements of the formula are relatively stable, and do not vary significantly from year to\n\n\n\n371\n      TIEC Ex.

Responsibility Ratio is an allocator that reflects the relative contribution\nof each Operating Company to the System's coincident peak load - in other words, an Operating Company's\ncoincident peak load divided by the System peak load, calculated on a rolling twelve-month average.

ETI points out that\n\"the vast majority\" of the planned transmission projects have received full funding approval and\nhave been constructed or are on schedule to be completed before the end of the Rate Year, while the\nremaining amount is reasonably quantified and measured based on the budget and historical spending\nfor maintenance of equalizable transmission facilities. 375\n\n\n           ETI also argues that its actual MSS-2 expenses have steadily trended upward since the Test\nYear. ETI explains as follows:\n\n\n           [l]n the last month of the test year (June 2011), ETI's payments began to increase\n           significantly, as the balance of relative equalizable investment levels shifted among\n           the Operating Companies. ETI' s actual monthly payments have climbed steadily ever\n           since, reaching $698,289 in the most recent actual month's bill (February 2012).\n           Annualization of this most recent actual data yields an annual MSS-2 amount of\n           $8.4 million, almost five times the test year level. In light of this trend in actual\n           historical data, the notion of basing the MSS-2 expense in rates on the test year level\n           is unreasonable on its face. 376\n\nThus, ETI contends its requested expense level is \"consistent\" with actual recent historical levels of\nMSS-2 expense. 377\n\n\n           ETI describes Cities' concern regarding load growth as a \"red herring.\" ETI contends that\nload growth is not the cause of changes in MSS-2 costs. Instead, its MSS-2 increases are driven by\nthe other Operating Companies' transmission investments, \"separate and apart from, and unaffected\nby,\" any increase in ETI's load. 378 Moreover, ETI contends that load growth adjustments are not\n\n\n\n374\n      Tr. at 763 and 780.\n375\n      ETI Ex. 59 (McCulla Rebuttal) at 2-3; ETI Initial Brief at 88-89.\n376\n      ETI Initial Brief at 90-91; Tr. at 784.\n377\n      ETI Initial Brief at 91.\n378\n      ETI Ex. 45 (Cicio Rebuttal) at 4-5; ETI Initial Brief at 93.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE 116\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nknown and measurable and are not the proper subject of a post-test year adjustment for ordinary\nexpenses such as MSS-2 costs. 379\n\n\n          Finally, if the Commission rejects its request for $10.7 million in MSS-2 costs, ETI suggests\nannualizing the most recent period of its actual MSS-2 costs, by multiplying its February 2012 MSS-\n2 bill times 12, resulting in an amount of $8,379,480.                  ETI contends this would be more\nrepresentative of expected Rate Year MSS-2 costs than the amounts proposed by the intervenors. 380\n\n\n          For largely the same reasons as were discussed relative to PPCCs, the ALls conclude that\nETI failed to meet its burden to prove that its proposed Rate Year MSS-2 costs are known and\nmeasurable. The MSS-2 formula requires assumptions about a great number of variables. Changes\nto any of the variables could occur during the Rate Year, thereby altering the amount paid by (or\nreceived by) ETI during the Rate Year. The projects that underlie ETI's Rate Year request are\nlargely not yet built, and might never be built. Additionally, much like with the PPCCs estimates,\nthere is a wide gulf between the competing estimates by ETI, Cities, and TIEC of forecast Rate Year\nMSS-2 costs, illustrating the problem of deviating from actual Test Year data in an area that involves\nso many future contingencies and unknowns.\n\n\n          The ALls are equally unconvinced by ETI's alternative proposal to multiply its February\n2012 MSS-2 bill times 12, resulting in an amount of $8,379,480. ETI offered no evidence to\nestablish that a single month's costs can serve as a reasonable representation of what ETI's future\nRate Year MSS-2 costs will be. Moreover, February 2012 is outside of the Test Year.\n\n\n          The intervenors presented substantial evidence to demonstrate that ETI' s estimate of its Rate\nYear MSS-2 costs cannot be considered known and measurable. For this reason, the ALls\nrecommend that ETI's MSS-2 request be rejected. In its place, the ALls recommend that ETI be\nallowed to recover its Test Year MSS-2 costs of $1,753,797.\n\n\n\n379\n      ETI Ex. 57 (May Rebuttal) at 12; ETI Initial Brief at 93.\n380\n      ETI Ex. 46 (Considine Rebuttal) at 37; ETI Initial Brief at 32.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE 117\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nC.        Depreciation Expense [Germane to Preliminary Order Issue No. 12]\n\n          ETI currently has an annual depreciation expense of approximately $72.1 million. This\nexpense is based on the previously approved depreciation rates. 381 ETI now requests depreciation\nrates that would result in an annual depreciation expense of approximately $86 million. This\nrequested amount represents an increase in the annual depreciation expense of approximately\n$13.9 million - almost 20 percent - from the current annual depreciation expense. 382               The\ndepreciation expense ultimately included in retail rates, however, will be derived by applying the\nCommission approved rates to the test year end plant balances as of June 30, 2011.\n\n\n          The other parties have accepted the vast majority of ETI' s recommendations, but take issue\nwith the Company on a few issues related to generation, transmission, distribution, and general plant\naccounts.

Ideally, the cost of the asset is spread out\nevenly across the years the asset is in service, thus recovering the cost of the asset from the\ncustomers who receive the benefit of the asset. 389\n\n\n          Both ETI and Staff use the remaining-life technique, average life group procedure, and\nstraight-line method to calculate the depreciation rate. 390 The basic formula for the remaining life\ntechnique is presented below.\n\n\n                                                  1 - book reserve ratio - net salvage ratio}\n          depreciation rate ( %)          =   {                  .        . . ll\n                                                          composite remm.nmg z e\n                                                                                                * 100\n\n\n          For example, if an asset has a book reserve ratio of 0.5 (i.e., 50 percent of the asset's value\nhas already been recovered through prior depreciation expense), a net salvage ratio of zero (i.e., the\nasset will cost nothing to retire, or all retiring costs will be recovered through its subsequent sale),\nand the composite remaining life is ten years (i.e., the asset is expected to remain in service for\nanother ten years), then the depreciation rate will be 5 percent (i.e., { [ (1 - 0.5 - 0) I 10 ] *100 }).\n\n\n          By operation of the remaining-life formula, a greater net salvage value will reduce the\nnumerator and result in a lower depreciation rate and a lower depreciation expense. Likewise, a\nlower net salvage value will increase the numerator and result in a higher depreciation rate and a\nhigher depreciation expense. Similarly, a longer remaining-life will result in a lower depreciation\nrate and lower depreciation expense, and a shorter remaining-life will result in a higher depreciation\nrate and a higher depreciation expense.\n\n\n          Because net salvage and remaining-life values are the two contested variables in the\nremaining-life formula, a clear explanation of net salvage and remaining-life will be helpful.\n\n\n388\n      Staff Ex. 2 (Mathis Direct) at 8.\n389\n      Staff Ex. 1 (Mathis Direct) at 8-9.\n390\n      ETI Ex. 13 (Watson Direct) at 15; Staff Ex. 2 (Mathis Direct) at 10-11.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                               PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE 120\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          Net Salvage Value. Net salvage is calculated by taking the amount received for an asset as a\nresult of its sale, reuse, or reimbursement, and subtracting that amount from the cost associated with\nretiring the asset. This figure is then divided by the original cost of the asset to determine the net\nsalvage ratio. For example, if an asset with an original cost of $200 is resold for $20, but it costs the\nowner $10 to ship the asset to the purchaser, then the net salvage value of that asset would be $10\n($20 - $10), and the net salvage ratio of that asset would be 5 percent ($10/$200).\n\n\n          ETI witness Watson and Staff witness Mathis used different methods of calculating a net\nsalvage rate. 391 Mr. Watson took the average (mean) of recorded net salvage values for groups of\nsuccessive years (rolling bands), and then selected the net salvage rate from among these averages. 392\nMs. Mathis also used rolling band averages (means), but then took the median from a representative\ngroup of rolling bands when the historical salvage data would have otherwise produced what\nMr. Watson considers skewed results. 393\n\n\n          Ms. Mathis' method of calculating net salvage rates follows recent Commission precedent. 394\nAs Mr. Watson explained at the hearing, it is appropriate to infer acceptance of a methodology by\nlooking at whether the Commission adopted the conclusions that the methodology produced. 395 In\nother words, if the Commission adopts the conclusions, then by inference the Commission has\nadopted the methodology used to derive those conclusions. Thus, it is necessary to examine recent\nlitigated rate cases to ascertain Commission precedent.\n\n\n          In the most recent fully-litigated rate case, Docket No. 38339, 396 Staff disagreed with\nCenterPoint' s depreciation witness, Mr. Watson, concerning the net salvage rates for five\n\n\n\n391\n      Tr.at415-416.\n392\n      ETI Ex. 13 (Watson Direct) at 20-21.\n393\n      Id. at 22-23, 32-33.\n394\n      Tr. at 1766; Staff Ex. 9 (Docket No. 38339 Final Order) at FoF 126, 128, 130, and 131.\n395\n      Tr. at 397.\n396\n    Application of CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, UC, for Authority to Change Rates, Docket\nNo. 38339 (June 23, 2011).\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                              PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE 121\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\naccounts. 397 In its order, the Commission adopted Staffs recommended net salvage rates for four\nout of those five accounts for which Staff disagreed with Mr. Watson. 398 Staffs method for\n                                                                                                        399\ncalculating net salvage rates is the same in the present case as it was in the CenterPoint rate case.\n\n\n            ETI argues that the use of a median, as employed by Ms. Mathis, is not a sufficiently rigorous\nor expansive approach to depreciation analysis. According to ETI, depreciation training and texts, as\nwell as authoritative statistical texts, favor the average, or mean, not the median, as the best indicator\nof the central tendency of a data set. ETI argues that this is particularly the case because depreciation\nanalysis requires careful consideration of trends over time. 400 ETI then offers the following\ncomments:\n\n\n            [Ms. Mathis] agreed in response to a hypothetical that the median value of an initial\n            period of ten years of +5% net salvage, followed by one year of 0% salvage, followed\n            by the most recent period of ten years of -5% salvage, would be 0%. This\n            hypothetical plainly illustrates how reliance on the median can overlook data trends.\n            In the hypothetical, if the depreciation analyst would otherwise wish to give more\n            weight to the most recent historical period as indicative of conditions going forward,\n                                                                                      401\n            the use of the median would obscure that important trend information.\n\nA close examination of the hypothetical shows that in the case posited by ETI, however, the median\nand the mean are identical: both are zero. While the use of the median would produce a result that\nignores the trend that ETI says should be taken into account, the mean produces the same result.\nChanging the hypothetical produces no more clarity. If the examination was of a period that had ten\nyears of positive five percent salvage value, followed by one year of zero percent net salvage value,\nfollowed by the most recent 10-year period, which had negative 10 percent net salvage value, the\nmedian would still be zero but the mean would be negative 2.38 percent. This appears to support the\ntrending argument advanced by ETI. If the analysis then focuses on a different hypothetical, one\n\n\n397\n      Tr. at 401-402.\n398\n      See Staff Ex. 9 (Docket No. 38339 Final Order); Tr. at 402.\n399\n      Tr. at 415-416.\n400\n      ETI Initial Brief at 105.\n401   Id.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                     PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE 122\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nwith ten years of positive 10 percent net salvage value followed by one year of zero percent net\nsalvage value, with the most recent ten-year period having negative five percent net salvage value,\nthe results are more perplexing. The median is still zero, but the mean, which ETI contends will\nrecognize the trending, is 2.38. Although this does in some respects recognize the trend to a negative\nsalvage value, it does not recognize it as well as the median.\n\n\n       Principles and Procedures of Statistics, by Steel and Torrie, states: \"Certain types of data\nshow a tendency to have a pronounced tail to the right or the left. Such distributions are said to be\nskewed, and the arithmetic mean may not be the most informative central value.\" Where the average\nof the incomes of a group of individuals is required, and most of those incomes are low, the mean\nincome could be considerably larger than the median. In Docket No. 38339, Staff posed the\nfollowing example, which the AU s found both informative and persuasive: Suppose a sample of\n50 incomes from professional baseball players was taken that happened to include the salary of two\nof the most highly compensated players in the league today. As a result, the mean of the salaries\nwould likely be far greater than the median salary, because the use of the median would be skewed\nby the very high salaries. The median would likely provide a more accurate measure of the central\ntendency of the salaries. Such circumstances are found where using the median to find the central\ntendency prevents outliers in data that \"skews\" or shows extreme variations rather than showing\nmore symmetrical variations. The ALls believe this is as accurate today as it was during the Docket\nNo. 38339 timeframe. They therefore find that the use of the median is the more appropriate\nmethodology for determining net salvage value.\n\n\n       Remaining Life. Composite remaining life is the weighted average remaining life of the\nproperty account for a group of all vintages. The average remaining life represents the future years\nof service expected for the surviving property.\n\n\n       There are numerous ways to calculate the remaining life (life parameter) of a group of assets\nin a depreciation study. Examples include the interim retirement rate method and the retirement\n(actuarial) rate method. The interim retirement rate method uses interim retirement curves to model\n(predict) the retirement of individual assets within plant accounts. Alternatively, the retirement\n\fSOAHDOCKET N O . -                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                 PAGE 123\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n(actuarial) rate method uses historical mortality data for a group of assets and compares that data to\nvarious known patterns of industrial asset mortality rates (Iowa Curves). If the historical data creates\na pattern of mortality that closely follows one of the Iowa Curves, then that Iowa Curve may be used\nto approximate the remaining lives of that given group of assets in the future. Whether the historical\nmortality data creates a pattern that closely follows a given Iowa Curve is determined through\nplotting both sets of data (the historical mortality data and the Iowa Curve) on a graph and\nquantifying the closeness of fit through statistical analysis and visual examination.\n\n\n          Mr. Watson used multiple methods to calculate the remaining lives of assets, depending on\nthe asset. Generally, he used the retirement rate (actuarial) method. 402 However, to calculate the\nremaining life of production plant accounts, he used the interim retirement rate method. 403 Ms.\nMathis disagreed with the use of the interim retirement rate method because the Commission has\nrejected the application of interim retirement rates of production plant, as they are based on future\nprojection of retirements, for ETI and Central Power and Light Company in Docket Nos. 16705404\nand 14965,405 respectively.\n\n\n          ETI argues that the life span procedure, without the use of interim retirement curves, is\nunrealistic in its assumption that all production plant assets are \"depreciated (straight-line) for the\nsame number of periods and retire at the same time (the terminal retirement date).\" Use of interim\nretirements is an important refinement that adds accuracy to the determination of the depreciation\nrates according to ETI. Mr. Watson offered the following explanation:\n\n\n          Adding interim retirement curves to the procedure reflects the fact that some of the\n          assets at a power plant will not survive to the end of the life of the facility and should\n\n\n402\n      ETI Ex. 13 (Watson Direct) at 16.\n403\n      Staff Ex. 2 (Mathis Direct) at 14.\n404\n   Application ofEntergy Gulf States, Inc., for Approval of its Transition to Competition to Competition Plan\nand the Tariffs Implementing the Plan, and for the Authority to Reconcile Fuel Costs, to Set Revised Fuel\nFactors, and to Recover a Surcharge for Under-recovered Fuel Costs, Docket No. 16705 (Oct. 14, 1998).\n405\n    Application of Central Power & Light Company for Authority to Change Rates, Docket No. 14965\n(Oct. 16, 1997).\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE 124\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          be depreciated (straight-line) more quickly and retired earlier than the terminal life of\n          the facility. 406\n\nETI contends that this issue presents a unique situation where all the experts agree with the\ntheoretical soundness of Mr. Watson's approach, but Mr. Pous and Ms. Mathis recommend its\nrejection due to the existence of contrary Commission precedent. The impact of their position is a\n$1,558,081 reduction to depreciation expense, based on December 31, 2010, plant balances.\nMr. Pous generally supports the use of interim retirements because \"I think it's right,\"407 and he uses\nthe method in other jurisdictions, where it is a prevalent practice. Ms. Mathis \"also appears to\nrecognize the theoretical soundness of utilizing interim retirements.\"408 Even in Docket No. 16705,\nthe precedent cited by Mr. Pous and Ms. Mathis, the Staff depreciation witness agreed that the use of\ninterim retirements was appropriate, though not blessed by the Commission. ETI argues that use of\ninterim retirements reflects the undisputable fact that \"generating units will have retirements of\ndepreciable property before the end of their lives.''409\n\n\n          ETI is correct that neither Ms. Mathis nor Mr. Pous provide any reasoning behind the prior\nCommission precedent. Moreover, it is also true that the Commission precedent is relatively old at\nthis point (dating back to the mid-1990s) and apparently has not been revisited in any recent cases.\nETI argues that the Commission has in at least one other case used interim retirements (Docket\nNo. 15195410), but provides little more than that comment to support the concept. It is true that in\nconcept, interim retirements are determined in much the same fashion as other elements of\ndepreciation analysis.        Primarily based on historical accounting data, the analyst identifies\ncharacteristics in the history of the data upon which to base a reasoned assessment of retirements\ngoing forward, which is similar to what occurs in determining asset lives or net salvage.

Production Plant\n\n                       (a) Lives\n\n          Mr. Watson primarily used the life span method to calculate remaining lives of the\nproduction plant accounts. 411 The life span method estimates a production plant's life based on\nconsultation with utility management, financial, and engineering staff.412 However, he used interim\nretirement methodology to reduce the remaining lives determined by the life span method. Staff\ndoes not dispute the remaining lives determined by the life span methodology, but does dispute the\nuse of interim retirements. For the reasons discussed in Section VII.C.l, ETI should not be allowed\nto use the interim retirement methodology to adjust downward the remaining lives of its production\nplant accounts.\n\n\n          Cities witness Pous disputed only the remaining life determination for ETI's Sabine Power\nPlant Units 4 and 5, ETI's largest and newest gas fired generating units. Mr. Pous recommended a\nlife span for Sabine Units 4 and 5 of 64 years based on assessment of the units, comparison to the\nestimated life span of similar units owned by ETI as well as other gas fired generating units across\nthe country. ETI proposes a 60-year life for the two units. Mr. Pous noted that a \"64-year life span\nrecommended for Sabine Units 4 and 5 is consistent with the life span proposed by the Company for\nits Lewis Creek 1 generating unit. Lewis Creek Unit 1 is an older, smaller, and generally less\n\n411\n      ETI Ex. 13 (Watson Direct) at 16.\n412\n      Staff Ex. 2 (Mathis Direct) at 14.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                               PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE 126\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nefficient generating unit than Sabine Units 4 and 5. Cities contend that there is no basis or logic for\nassigning a shorter life span for a more capital-intensive asset that is newer, larger, and generally\nmore efficient.\"413\n\n\n          ETI witness Watson explained that he primarily relied on the determination of Company\npersonnel to arrive at the 60-year life for the Sabine Units. Although Cities attempted to cast doubt\non Mr. Watson's determinations regarding the life of these units, it is clear that his determinations\nare based on conversations with ETI various generation personnel and that those conversations\nconfirmed that based on evaluation of a variety of considerations, including age, operational role,\nlevel of funding, unit condition, and operational risk, 60 years constitutes a reasonable threshold for\nthe expected life of Sabine Units 4 and 5. It is also clear that comparisons to Lewis Creek Unit 1 are\nnot appropriate. Lewis Creek Unit 1 has significant differences, which explain its longer life-span.\nUnlike the Sabine Units, ETI is planning to spend in excess of $100 million to refurbish the Lewis\nCreek critical equipment over the next three years to sustain operating reliability. ETI is not\nperforming similar refurbishment activities at Sabine. 414\n\n\n          The Sabine Units are projected to be \"must-run\" units. This means that these units are, for\nthe most part, deployed to operate whenever they are available for service. Mr. Pous compared these\nunits to EAi's Lake Catherine Units 1 & 2, 415 but ETI contends this is not a reasonable comparison.\nEAi's Lake Catherine Units 1 & 2 are not \"must-run\" units. They experience very infrequent\noperation and are not projected to run much in the future. Other things being equal, according to\nETI, this would justify the longer 67-year life span assigned to these Arkansas units, because they\nwould not be experiencing the wear and tear of daily operation.416\n\n\n          The explanations offered by ETI for the 60-year life of the Sabine Units 4 and 5 generating\nfacilities are convincing. It appears that Mr. Watson engaged knowledgeable people within ETI to\n\n413\n      Cities Ex. 5C (Pous Depreciation Study) at 9.\n414\n      ETI Ex. 51 (Garrison Rebuttal) at 3.\n415\n      Cities Ex. 5 (Pous Direct) at 7-8.\n416\n      ETI Ex. 51 (Garrison Rebuttal) at 3.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                          PAGE 127\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ngather pertinent information and applied that information appropriately. The comparison to Lake\nCreek units is not appropriate given the planned refurbishment of those units. Similarly, the\ncomparison to the Lake Catherine units also fails. A unit that does not carry the \"must-run\"\ndesignation can easily be expected to perform longer than a unit, such as the Sabine Units, that\ncarries the \"must-run\" designation. Accordingly, the ALls find that ETI' s choice of a 60-year life for\nthe Sabine Units 4 and 5 is reasonable.\n\n\n                       (b) Net Salvage Value\n\n          In determining the net salvage attributable to production plant, ETI witness Watson started\nwith the negative 5 percent net salvage factor approved most recently for ETI in PUC Docket\nNo. 16705. This is a net salvage value that the Commission has adopted in a number of cases for\nproduction plant. 417 Mr. Watson testified that the net salvage calculation must reflect known\nchanges in the cost of retiring production plant since the net salvage factor was last set. Accordingly,\nMr. Watson's study used the Handy-Whitman labor index to calculate the change in labor costs\napplicable to removal activity for the years 1997 to 2010. Consideration of the increases in labor\ncosts over this 13-year period resulted in an increase in the cost of removal, and a corresponding\nincrease in the level of negative net salvage, from negative five percent to negative 8.5 percent. 418\n\n\n          Both Staff witness Mathis and Cities witness Pous disagreed with ETI's proposal for\nproduction plant net salvage. Ms. Mathis proposed that the existing negative 5 percent net salvage\nfactor be retained. Ms. Mathis stated that Mr. Watson's analysis is flawed for three reasons:\n\n\n•     First, Mr. Watson did not calculate a gross salvage value for each plant. This is a\n      necessary element of the fundamental net salvage rate calculation. 419\n\n•     Second, Mr. Watson unreasonably assumed that all steam production plants would be\n      demolished at the end of their estimated remaining lives without any consideration of\n\n\n417\n      Staff Ex. 2 (Mathis Direct) at l 7.\n418\n      ETI Ex. 13 (Watson Direct) at Ex.

The Commission has consistently approved negative five percent net\n      salvage rates for production plants if detailed plant-specific and reasonable demolition\n      cost studies were not filed by the utility. 421\n\n            ETI responds that Staffs recommendation fails to account for the fact that the\nnegative 5 percent benchmark is stale, having been established in a Commission proceeding 35 years\nago. Since that time, \"labor costs have escalated by 267 percent with the rational expectation that\nthey will continue to increase at least with inflation.\"422\n\n\n            Cities witness Pous recommended moving from the current negative five percent net salvage\nto a positive 5 percent net salvage; i.e., that it should be determined that the gross salvage from the\npower plants will exceed the removal cost. Mr. Pous stated that he bases this claim on the ETI' s\nactual experience over the past 45 years as well as current trends within the industry in the last\n14 years. According to Mr. Pous, ETI has retired many units since 1965 and demolished or sold the\nunits and achieved a range of net salvage values from zero percent net salvage to\npositive 180 percent. 423 Other utilities in Texas and elsewhere have also experienced positive net\nsalvage levels. 424 Mr. Pous testified that since 1998 over 1,000 generating units have been sold, and\nin all instances resulted in positive net salvage. 425 He also claims that his positive five percent\nproduction net salvage is consistent with the Commission's decision in the most recent SPS case,\nDocket No. 32766, where Mr. Watson was hired by SPS as a depreciation witness and the\n\n\n\n\n420\n      Id. at 17.\n421   Id.\n422\n      ETI Ex. 71 (Watson Rebuttal) at 17, 19.\n423\n      Cities Ex. 5 (Pous Direct) at 15.\n424\n      Cities Ex. 5C (Pous Depreciation Study) at 11; Cities Ex. 5 (Pous Direct) at 15-16.\n425\n      Cities Ex. 5C (Pous Depreciation Study) at 11.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                         PAGE 129\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nCommission ultimately approved a positive five percent net salvage. 426 As ETI notes, however, the\nSPS rate case was the result of settlement427 and is of little precedential value.\n\n\n          ETI argues that Cities witness Pous appears to primarily base this claim on the fact that the\nsale of utility plants in circumstances bearing no relationship to depreciation analysis has yielded\ngains that Mr. Pous characterizes as \"positive net salvage.\" He uses as examples sales that form a\npart of the restructuring of the Texas utility business to introduce retail competition. Ms. Mathis also\nconcluded, without elaboration, that ETI' s production plant net salvage analysis is flawed because it\ndoes not consider the possibility that the unit could be sold as a consequence of deregulation.\nNeither Ms. Mathis nor Mr. Pous, however, pointed to any instance in which the Commission has\nadopted such an approach to determining net salvage.\n\n\n          ETI contends that this argument should be rejected for a number of reasons. It argues that\nalthough there is no precedent supporting Ms. Mathis' and Mr. Pous' approach, there is clear recent\nprecedent rejecting the inclusion of sales in depreciation analysis. 428 The sales referenced by these\nwitnesses are unique and unpredictable events, as should be evident from the use of the restructuring\nof the utility industry as an example of this type of activity. Indeed, at this time the Texas\nLegislature has halted for the foreseeable future any ETI move to competition. For purposes of\ndepreciation analysis, net salvage is aimed at determining the salvage received at the end of the\nplants' useful lives. Mr. Pous' analysis necessarily assumed that, due to the sale, the life of the\nplants will be truncated. Yet he made no adjustment to production plant lives to account for the\neffect of theoretical sales.429\n\n\n          ETI also contends that Mr. Pous' other examples of positive net salvage are equally\nunavailing. Mr. Pous points to ETI's retirement of Neches Station as an example of positive\n\n426\n      Cities Ex. 5 (Pous Direct) at l 7.\n427\n      See ETI Ex. 71 (Watson Rebuttal) at 6.\n428\n   See Application ofAEP Texas Central Co. for Authority to Change Rates, Docket No. 33309, FoF l 07,\n108, 112 (Mar. 4, 2008) (proceeds from sale of building properly removed from depreciation analysis as\nnon-recurring item).\n429\n      ETI Ex. 71 (Watson Rebuttal) at 5-7.\n\fSOAHDOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE 130\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nsalvage,430 but fails to mention that: (1) this outcome was uniquely the result of insurance proceeds\nreceived by ETI after a boiler explosion; and (2) the proceeds flowed back to customers via means\nother than depreciation rates. 431 ETI contends that Mr. Po us' claim that a contractor paid $1 million\nfor the right to demolish a power plant, apparently based on unrecorded hearsay conversations, and\nwithout any information from Mr. Pous regarding the facts and circumstances surrounding the\ntransaction, proves nothing.\n\n\n          Finally, Mr. Pous stated that Mr. Watson's adjustment to the net salvage rates is flawed\nbecause it does not adequately reflect the increase in scrap metal prices in recent years. ETI responds\nthat although scrap metal prices have gone up recently, it is unknown what the prices will be in the\nfuture, and these commodity prices have proven to be quite volatile and unpredictable. 432 According\nto ETI, it is not reasonable to assume, as does Mr. Pous, that prices will stay indefinitely at what is\ntheir historically highest level. ETI argues that Mr. Pous' method is based on speculation and broad,\nconclusory opinions regarding economic trends, as to which he makes no attempt to actually arrive at\na quantifiable analysis that yields his unprecedented positive net salvage recommendation. 433\n\n\n          Mr. Pous' testimony that net salvage value should be revised to reflect a value of\npositive 5 percent is seriously flawed. First, pointing to a settled case as precedent carries no weight.\nSecond, attempting to draw conclusions from sales that were forced to comply with the regulatory\nframework and apply those conclusions to an entity that is not subject to the same regulatory\nframework is equally flawed. Finally, Mr. Pous attempted to use ETI's own experience to support\nhis position ignores the fact that ETI' s experiences were driven by factors that were unique to ETI at\nthe time and circumstances involved; they do not support the more universal application urged by\nMr. Pous.\n\n\n\n\n43\n  ° Cities Ex. 5 (Pous Direct) at 14.\n431\n      ETI Ex. 46 (Considine Rebuttal) at 49-50.\n432\n      ETI Ex. 71 (Watson Rebuttal) at 17-18.\n433\n      ETI Initial Brief at 103.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE 131\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          Ms. Mathis' analysis, in some respects, suffers from the same flaws as Mr. Pous'.\nNevertheless, some of her points carry more weight. The AUs believe that Mr. Watson is correct\nthat labor costs have increased since the negative five percent net salvage value was first established\nby the Commission. However, that is not the end of the story. Are there other factors that also have\nchanged in the corresponding time period? There is no evidence on this point, and that is the crux of\nthe matter. As Ms. Mathis argues, there is only one way that all the changing values can be\nevaluated; through the introduction of plant-specific demolition cost studies. Had studies of that\nnature been provided, the parties would have been able to evaluate them and provide a supportable,\nfully-vetted recommendation.           The AUs recommend that the Commission find that a\nnegative 5 percent net salvage value for production plant is appropriate.\n\n\n                      (c) Depreciation Reserve\n\n          TIEC argues that $1.1 million of ETI's requested $13 million increase in depreciation\nexpenses is related to ETI' s production plant assets. 434 ETI has a $92,537 ,000 surplus in production\nplant assets. A surplus depreciation reserve occurs when the theoretical reserve (the reserve that\nwould exist if the current proposed rates had been in place in the past) exceeds the per book\ndepreciation reserve. According to TIEC, this indicates that ETI customers have overpaid the value\nof production plant assets. 435 Since ETI has already over-recovered the value of the production plant\nassets, there is no valid reason to seek any additional recovery. TIEC contends that ETI has not\nshown why it needs to increase production depreciation rates at this time given that the production\ndepreciation reserve has a considerable surplus. Therefore, it argues, $1.1 million of the proposed\nincrease should be rejected.\n\n\n          ETI rejects TIEC' s recommendation because it is clearly contrary to Commission policy and\nprecedent. According to ETI, the Commission has consistently adopted the remaining life, straight-\nline method for determining depreciation rates. 436 This method requires that the remaining life of\n\n434\n    ETI Ex. 13A (Watson Workpapers) at Appendix B. This figure is derived by subtracting the expenses\nfrom the existing production plant account from the proposed production plant account.\n435\n      TIEC Ex. l (Pollock Direct) at 36-37, Ex.

In this way, by the end of the life, the costs will be recovered.\nMr. Pollock's approach ignores these principles, and seeks to look back in time to compare how the\ndepreciation rates now proposed would have affected the recovery in the past. Those past\ndepreciation rates, however, were authorized for use by the Commission.                  ETI argues that\ndepreciation rates are at all times estimates, subject to adjustment using updated studies, and there is\nno reason for adoption of Mr. Pollock's alternative. Finally, the Commission expressly rejected\nadjustment to the outcome of remaining life depreciation determinations based on differences\nbetween theoretical and book depreciation reserves in CenterPoint Docket No. 38339. 437\n\n\n          The ALls agree with TIEC that the Commission's decision in Docket No. 38339 is not\nfour-square on point with this case. That is not sufficient, however, to overcome the arguments\nadvanced by ETI in favor of its position in the current case. The Commission has consistently used\nthe remaining life, straight-line methodology for determining depreciation rates, and that\nmethodology requires that the remaining life of the asset be determined, and depreciation rates\nestablished to recover the asset's remaining cost in equal installments over that life. Mr. Pollock's\nproposal ignores that consistently applied methodology. The AU s recommend that the Commission\napprove ETI's recommended treatment of the production plant depreciation reserve.\n\n\n          3.

For Account 352, he found the five-year and\nten-year moving averages for the years 2008-2010 particularly telling. 440 A moving average is a\nrolling average that updates each year to include the additional year as part of the average for the\nlonger period under study. Mr. Watson testified that his recommendation of negative 10 percent net\nsalvage is consistent (albeit less negative) with the five-year and ten-year moving averages for 2008,\nwhich range from negative 16.31 percent to negative 16.80 percent. Although the moving averages\n\n\n\n\n439\n      Staff Ex. 2A (Mathis Direct) at 21; Cities Ex. 5 (Pous Direct) at 28.\n440\n      ETI Ex. 71 (Watson Rebuttal) at 56.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                 PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE 134\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nfor 2009 and 2010 appear more positive, this was the result of a large, atypical gross salvage in\n            441\n2009.             Cities propose no change to Mr. Watson's recommendation.\n\n\n              Staff witness Mathis recommended a net salvage rate of negative five percent for\nAccount 352. This recommendation is based on analysis of historical salvage data for the period of\n1984 through 2010. Specifically, the three-year moving average for the same period produces a net\nsalvage rate of negative 5.53 percent, which is very close to the currently approved net salvage rate\nfor this account. Moreover, an examination of the mean and median rolling band averages for\nAccount 352 shows a range of net salvage rates between positive 0.08 percent and\nnegative 6.83 percent. 442 Thus, according to Ms. Mathis, the net salvage rate of negative 5 percent is\na reasonable estimate based on the available historical data.\n\n\n              In response to Mr. Watson's contention that the 2008 moving average is the most important,\nMs. Mathis pointed out that the 2009 five-year and ten-year moving averages feature\npositive 16.66 percent and positive 4.45 percent net salvage rates, respectively. Moreover, the 2010\nfive-year and ten-year moving averages feature positive 25 .13 percent and positive 6. 75 percent net\nsalvage rates, respectively. 443 Ms. Mathis stated that if it is a sound depreciation methodology to\nselect a net salvage rate based on recent five-year and ten-year moving averages, then the rate for this\naccount should be significantly greater than either Ms. Mathis' or Mr. Watson's recommendation. 444\n\n\n                  Although the moving averages cited by Ms. Mathis for 2009 and 2010 appear to belie the\narguments raised by Ms. Watson, the AlJs are persuaded that those are significantly influenced by\nthe atypical gross salvage resulting from the 2009 sale of a spare transformer, an asset whose cost is\nbooked to an entirely different account.

Mr. Pons noted that the\nactual per book data for a five-year band and a ten-year band are a positive 117 .04 percent and a\npositive 31.95 percent, respectively. 447 Mr. Pous stated that his analysis does not ignore the positive\nnet salvage recorded by ETI because of the sale of transmission investment, rather he testified that:\n\n\n            the Company has reported five separate sales during the past 22 years, or about once\n            every four years. Such activity cannot be considered an 'unusual circumstance' or an\n            outlier, and should be taken into consideration as an event that may continue to occur\n            in the future. In a proper evaluation phase of a depreciation study, recognition of\n            some level of future sales is appropriate. 448\n\n\n\n\n445\n      The atypical amount is shown at Appendix E-2, p. 1 of 10 of Mr. Watson's depreciation study.\n446\n      ETI Ex. 13 (Watson Direct) at Ex.

According to ETI,\nMr. Watson's workpapers clearly indicate that adjustments were required and made to the per book\ndata for unique transactions involving sales and storm activity. As to sales, the workpapers 450 show\nthat in the 26 years of data for Account 353, there were three occasions with very large sales\nproceeds for the sale of substations. As to storm activities, the same workpapers show only one\noccasion in 26 years where gross salvage amounts were recorded. ETI contends that these unique\nevents are properly excluded from net salvage analysis and Mr. Pous' reliance on the per book data\nto establish positive net salvage is erroneous. With respect to Mr. Pous' concem's relating to the\nprice of copper, ETI responds that Mr. Pous' reliance on copper's scrap value is pure speculation,\nunsupported by any ETl-specific data regarding the amount of copper at issue, or any consideration\nof the offsetting significant and increasing labor costs involved in the removal of large station\ntransformers.\n\n\n           As explained by Mr. Watson, it appears to the AlJs that the adjustments made were, indeed,\nrequired because of the unique nature of the events they reflected. The AU s also find that Mr. Pous'\nconcerns relating to the price of copper are speculative. Coupled with the fact that Staff supports\nETI's proposed net salvage value, the AUs recommend that the Commission approve ETI's\nrecommended negative 20 percent net salvage value.\n\n\n\n\n449\n      Id. at 22.\n450\n   ETI Ex. 13A (Watson Direct) Workpaper on CD, \"Entergy Net Salvage Transmission Distribution\nGeneral\" Spreadsheet, \"Data Adjustments\" Tab, Account 353.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                              PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                        PAGE 137\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n                   (iii) Account 354-Towers and Fixtures\n\n           Although there is limited experience available for this account, the five-year and ten-year\nmoving averages for transaction year 2010 show a substantial level of negative net salvage\n(negative 299 percent and negative 233 percent, respectively). Taking into account the low level of\nretirement experience, Mr. Watson stated that he moderated the outcome by recommending moving\n                                           451\nto negative 20 percent net salvage.              Mr. Pous concurred in this recommendation.\n\n\n           Ms. Mathis recommended a net salvage rate of negative 5 percent for Account 354. 452 This\nrecommendation is based on Commission precedent due to the absence of reliable historical salvage\ndata. 453 Although historical salvage data is available for the period of 1984 through 2010, this\naccount had a low level of retirement during this period. 454 Because of the limited retirement\nactivity, Ms. Mathis stated that a reasonable net salvage rate cannot be calculated from the historical\nsalvage data. 455         For example, annual net salvage rates range from approximately\nnegative 6,000 percent to approximately positive 31,253,400 percent.456 According to Ms. Mathis,\nsuch divergent numbers are indicative of the low retirement activity within this account.\n\n\n           The negative five percent net salvage value recommended by Ms. Mathis is the current\nCommission-approved number. The AUs find it difficult to draw any conclusions from the paucity\nof historical data. Had there been additional historical data, it might have been possible to reach the\nconclusion urged by Mr. Watson; however, there was not.

Although years 2009-2010 reflect positive\nsalvage values, Mr. Watson determined that these values were the product of differences in the\ntiming of the recording of the various transactions associated with the asset retirement, rather than\nreflecting an actual positive salvage amount. 458 For example, Mr. Watson's net salvage workpapers\nshow a significant level of positive salvage only for the years 2009-2010 in Account 355. 459 This is\nat odds with the remainder of the net salvage data shown in the workpapers, which is almost\nexclusively negative net salvage. 460 Accordingly, Mr. Watson gave less weight to the 2009 and 2010\nvalues, but moderated his recommendation compared to the ten-year moving averages, resulting in a\nrecommended net salvage of negative 30 percent. Ms. Mathis concurred.\n\n\n          Cities witness Po us disagreed with Mr. Watson's analysis, claiming: ( 1) per book data from\nthe five-year and ten-year moving averages show positive net salvage amounts; (2) authoritative\ndepreciation treatises do not support Mr. Watson's decision to adjust relocation-related transactions\nout of the analysis; 461 (3) no portion of relocation-related costs can be treated as removal unless that\ntreatment is prescribed by contract with the third-party; and (4) after the correction to his analysis,\nMr. Watson changed his methodology to arrive at a negative net salvage recommendation. Mr. Pous\nrecommended an increase in the net salvage values to a negative 15 percent based on the actual\nhistorical data of ETI. Cities contend that Mr. Pous was conservative in his recommendation given\n\n457\n      Cities Ex. 5C (Pous Depreciation Study) at 23.\n458\n      ETI Ex. 13 (Watson Direct) at Ex.

The most recent five-year band of actual data yields a positive two percent net\nsalvage.462\n\n\n          The ALI s agree that the debate regarding this account essentially boils down to whether\nMr. Watson's adjustment to remove relocation expense associated with third-party reimbursement\nfrom the analysis is appropriate. Although Mr. Pous claims that Mr. Watson's approach is contrary\nto authoritative guidance, ETI contends that he arrives at that conclusion only by disregarding the\nguidance in question, as well as Commission precedent. ETI argues that the depreciation text in\nquestion squarely supports Mr. Watson's approach:\n\n\n          A reimbursed retirement is one for which the company is fully compensated at the\n          time of retirement .... Usually reimbursed retirements should not be included in\n          analysis of property whose investment is recovered through depreciation accruals. 463\n\n          Mr. Watson explained at hearing that, in his experience, adjustments to remove relocation\nexpense are standard in depreciation analysis, and to do otherwise would result in a disproportionate\nimpact on reasonably expected ongoing net salvage, caused by a transaction (the relocation) that\nconstitutes a very small portion of the overall assets in question. 464\n\n\n          Mr. Pous stated that all third-party reimbursements for facility relocation performed by the\nCompany have to be deemed as salvage (thereby inflating the salvage portion of the net between\nremoval costs and salvage proceeds) unless a contract between ETI and a third-party explicitly says\notherwise. Mr. Watson's approach, however, is squarely supported the Commission's decision in the\nrecent Oncor case, Docket No. 35717, where it was held that these third-party \"reimbursements are\nprepayments for new property being installed.\"465 The Al.Js find that Mr. Pous' argument is not\ncredible in light of Mr. Watson's treatment of relocations in general. Since Mr. Watson properly\nremoved such relocation expense from the depreciation analysis altogether, those amounts correctly\n\n\n462\n      Cities Ex. 5C (Pous Depreciation Study) at 22-25.\n463\n      ETI Ex. 71 (Watson Rebuttal) at 63 (quoting Depreciation Systems, Iowa State Press, 1994, at 16-17).\n464\n      Tr. at 405.\n465\n      ETI Ex. 71 (Watson Rebuttal) at 63.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                              PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                          PAGE 140\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nhave no impact on depreciation rates, regardless of how they are allocated between gross salvage\nproceeds and the cost of installing new facilities.\n\n\n          ETI' s evidence and argument support its request.

Mr. Watson's study determined that the longer ten-year moving average for\ntransaction year 2010 showed salvage of negative 33 percent, so Mr. Watson recommended moving\nto negative 30 percent net salvage for this account.467 Staff witness Mathis adopted the same\nnegative net salvage value.\n\n\n          Cities' witness Pous recommended an increase to the net salvage value to a\nnegative 10 percent based on a review of the actual historical data. The actual five-year and ten-year\nbands yield a positive one percent and a negative 31 percent. Mr. Pous argues that the trend in the\ndata could justify even a less negative value.\n\n\n          As with Account 355, the AUs find that ETI's evidence and arguments support its request.\nAccordingly, the ALl s recommend that the Commission approve a net salvage of negative 30 percent\nas proposed by Mr. Watson.\n\n\n\n\n466\n      Cities Ex.

As the\naverage age of the investment is only 19.22 years, it is inadequate to look at only one band that\nexamines a 50-year period.

He stated thatthe\ncurrent plant in service reflects a life (13.97 years on average) that is substantially shorter than his\nrecommendation, and all the bands examined reflect a shorter life than the currently approved\n44 years. Mr. Watson testified that his recommendation balances these facts with the additional fact\nthat ETI is currently using Penta and CCA-treated poles (as opposed to creosote treated poles), for\nwhich a longer life is expected.\n\n\n           Ms. Mathis (40 Rl) and Mr. Pous (44 Ll) both proposed different life parameters than\nMr. Watson. Ms. Mathis stated that her proposed life parameter is a better visual and mathematical\nfit for the single experience band (1959-2010) she considered. 480 Mr. Watson responded to this\nargument, stating that the mathematical computer fitting emphasized by Ms. Mathis is too limited an\napproach, because there is too little information provided at the tail of the curve to rely on computer\nfitting in this instance. Mr. Watson indicated that his proposed life parameter shows a better fit over\nthe full range of placement and experience bands applicable to this account. 481\n\n\n           Mr. Pous recommended that the expected service life remain at 44 years based on actuarial\nanalysis and advances made by the industry and ETI in treating and preserving poles. 482 Mr. Pous\nalso noted that \"absent identifiable and supportable specific problems, the industry is not\nexperiencing shorter lives for poles and neither should ETI.\" 483 He stated that selection of different\ntypes of poles and different treatments by other utilities have their engineers expecting lives between\n\n479\n      ETI Ex. 13 (Watson Direct) at Ex.

Mr. Watson responded that the increased life span urged by\nMr. Pous based on his general discussion of varieties of poles with longer lives is not verifiable, not\nconsistent with the Company-specific data or the specific experience of its distribution personnel,\nand is plainly exaggerated. 486\n\n\n            The AU s reviewed the evidence and arguments of the parties with respect to this issue and\nwere most persuaded by the Cis that resulted from the recommendations of Staff and ETI.\nConsidering all the historical mortality data available for ~his account (the overall experience band),\nStaff's selected Iowa Curve produces a CI of 41..44, while ETI's produces a CI of only 20.66 when\nmeasured against the overall (1958 - 2010) experience band.487 The AUs recommend that the\nCommission adopt Staff's proposal of 40 Rl.\n\n\n                    (iii) Account 365 - Overhead Conductors and Devices\n\n                                                                          488\n            The Commission approved average service life is 44 years.

As\nMr. Pous noted, \"the highest retirement ratio for this investment in the first 23 years occurred at age\n0.5 years, for brand new assets. While such events can and have occurred associated with utility\nplant, it is not the type of event that is reasonably expected to repeat itself in future periods as\ndifferent equipment it purchases if it was an equipment problem, or different installation processes\nare employed if the early retirement were due to installation issues.\"492 Mr. Pous criticized\nMr. Watson's recommendation on several grounds: (1) it is not consistent with expected lives\nreported by ETI personnel; (2) it did not account for anomalies and/or unusual activity in the\nretirement data; (3) the major re-conductoring activity shown in the account should not be expected\nto continue; and (4) the life-curve combination chosen by Mr. Watson is not long enough to match\n                      493\nthe actual data.\n\n\n          Mr. Watson took issue with Mr. Pous.

It does appear that Ms. Mathis\nused the wrong curve in her calculations. If corrected, Mr. Watson's proposal renders the higher CI.\nMr. Pous' arguments fair no better. To the Al.Js' eye, Mr. Pous did misread the data, and the\nconclusions drawn by Mr. Pous are simply inaccurate.

Cities propose a significantly\nlonger life (45 S-0.5). Mr. Pous stated that Mr. Watson's and Ms. Mathis' recommendations do not\naccount for the increased durability of newer types of conductor, and that the actuarial analysis\nshould focus on more recent data that he believes is more consistent with the newer conductors. 498\n\n\n          Mr. Watson testified that Mr. Pous' recommendation should be rejected for a variety of\nreasons. The Southern California Edison-based opinions regarding longer life for the conductor,\nrelied on by Mr. Pous, relate to plant installed less than ten years ago. Therefore, based on his own\ntheory, much of the investment in question in this account is still the older, shorter-lived variety, and\nhis recommendations are premature.

The Al.J s recommend that the Commission approve ETI' s recommended service life\nof 35 Rl.5.\n\n\n                   (v) Account 368 - Line Transformers\n\n           The Commission approved anticipated service life is 39 years. 500 Mr. Watson proposed a\nservice life of 29 Ll ,501 with which Ms. Mathis agreed. Mr. Watson stated that this is consistent with\nthe data showing decreasing lives for these assets, the expected lives per Company personnel, and the\nfact that transformers are junked or sold rather than repaired. 502\n\n\n           Mr. Pous recommended that the expected service life be decreased to 33 years, representing a\n15 percent reduction in the anticipated service life. Mr. Pous stated that his analysis is based on\nactuarial analyses and the Company's addition of approximately $80 million of pad mounted\ntransformers since the last case, when the Commission approved a 39-year anticipated average\nservice life. According to Mr. Pous, ETI personnel have stated that pole mounted transformers have\na life of between 25 and 35 years. However, pad mounted transformers are expected to last up to\n40 years by the same Company personnel. Given the sizable investment since the last case in the pad\nmounted transformers with a longer expected service life, a decrease in the anticipated service life of\n\n\n499\n      ETI Ex. 71 (Watson Rebuttal) at 40.\n500\n      Cities Ex.

Moreover, Mr. Pous stated his\nanalysis uncovered abnormally high retirement ratios in the 21.5 to 22.5 year age brackets indicative\nof one-time events such as the ice storm or changes in accounting systems. As such, Mr. Pous\nperformed his curve fitting analysis recognizing the unusually high retirement activity between years\n21.5 and 22.5 rather than emphasizing such unusual activity as Mr. Watson did for his proposal to\nreduce service life by 26 percent. 503\n\n\n            Mr. Watson recommended a decline in average service life from a 39-year anticipated service\nlife to a 29-year anticipated service life citing the high occurrence of lightning in the ETI service\narea. 504 However, Mr. Pous noted that the effects of lightning in ETI' s service area would have been\npresent in ETI's last base rate case when a 39-year anticipated service life was approved by the\nCommission. Both Mr. Watson and Mr. Pous recognized that the pad mounted transformers are not\nsubject to the same forces of retirement like weather, lightning, and animal disturbances. 505\nHowever, Mr. Watson did not realistically factor ETI's relative increased investment in pad mounted\ntransformers into his analysis. Moreover, when performing his curve fitting analysis, Mr. Watson\nneither analyzed nor adjusted for the abnormal unusual retirement ratios between years 21.5 and\n22.5. 506 Instead, Mr. Watson attempted to select a life analysis that anticipates a high level of\nretirement within that time period in the future. sm Cities argue that, by failing to recognize the\nsizable new investment in pad mounted transformers and failing to consider the unusual retirement\nratios, Mr. Watson proposed an average service life that is lower than the bottom end of the range of\nlife estimates of Company personnel for pad mounted transformers. Moreover, Mr. Watson's\nproposal does not even reach the midpoint of life estimates expected by Company personnel for pole\nmounted transformers.\n\n\n\n\n503\n      Cities Ex. 5C (Pous Depreciation Study) at 45.\n504\n      ETI Ex. 13 (Watson Direct) at Ex DAW-1 at 50.\n505   Id.\n506\n      Cities Ex. 5C (Pous Depreciation Study) at 47.\n507\n      ETIEx.13 (WatsonDirect)atExDAW-1 at50-51.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                              PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE149\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          The arguments and evidence advanced by Cities witness Pous are persuasive to the ALl s.\nMr. Watson's contention regarding the occurrences of lightening in the ETI service area was equally\napplicable at the time the existing approved rate was set, and is, therefore, of little value in this\nproceeding. Further, Mr. Watson's failure to analyze the abnormal retirement ratios between years\n21.5 and 22.5 also argues against his analysis. The ALls recommend that the Commission adopt\nMr. Pous' proposed life of 33 L0.5.\n\n\n                  (vi) Account 369.1-0verhead Services\n\n          The Commission previously approved anticipated service life for this account is 36 years.508\nMr. Watson's analysis of this account shows that overhead assets have retired earlier and have been\nreplaced more frequently than is consistent with the existing 36 S4 life. The average age of current\ninvestment is 10.12 years. Consistent with this data and his review of various curves and placement\nand experience bands, he recommended shortening the life to 26 L4. Ms. Mathis agrees with this\nproposal. 509\n\n\n          Mr. Pous recommended that the expected service life be shortened to 33 years based on the\nlack of Company historical data and based on comparative utility experience including recent studies\nby Mr. Watson, where he proposed significantly longer average service lives. Mr. Pous testified that\nan evaluation of the actual data casts serious doubt about the reliability of the data for depreciation\npurposes. ETI does not have any records of services in this subaccount surviving past 1978.\nMr. Pous stated that his recommended 33-year life expectancy for this sub-account is still far shorter\nthan industry expectations, but is consistent with the depreciation study recently conducted for EGSL\nwhere the depreciation expert hired by EGSL recommended a 33-year life. 510\n\n\n          ETI argues that Mr. Pous apparently made no attempt to perform any curve fitting regarding\nthis account, as none appears in his study; in the absence of performing this essential analysis, he\n\n\n508\n      Cities Ex.

ETI contends that, in\nreality, Mr. Pous appears to present no recommendation for this account based on evaluation of any\nof the accounting data that actually depicts the past and current characteristics of the assets. 511\n\n\n          ETI argues that its recommended life is clearly supported by the Company-specific data,\ngraphically depicted in Mr. Watson's rebuttal testimony, while Mr. Pous' suggested life parameter is\nnot even close, and is based on unsupported speculation. 512\n\n\n          Although the evidence on this issue is sparse, the ALls ultimately are persuaded that ETI's\n(and Staffs) position is more reasonable.

Ms. Mathis'\nrecommendation is based on analysis of historical salvage data for the period of 1984 through 2010.\nSpecifically, the two-year moving average median for the same period produces a net salvage rate of\nnegative 5.87 percent, which is very close to the currently approved net salvage rate for this\naccount. 513 Moreover, the one-year, three-year, four-year, five-year, six-year, and seven-year moving\naverage      medians      of    negative 6.95 percent,   negative 5.11 percent,   negative 3.64 percent,\nnegative 1.90 percent, negative 4.57 percent, and negative 7.24 percent, respectively, support this\nrecommendation.          Additionally, this account contains a few significant outliers, such as\nnegative 655.91 percent in 2002 and negative 322.55 percent in 2005. 514 Ms. Mathis' use of the\nmedian average eliminates the skewing effect of these outlying values.\n\n\n          As discussed in Section VII.C.l, the use of the median is the most appropriate methodology.\nFor this reason, the AUs recommend the Commission approve Staffs proposed negative 5 percent\nnet salvage value.\n\n\n                   (ii) Account 362 - Station Equipment\n\n          The existing net salvage value of this account is positive 15 percent. Mr. Watson proposed\nthat it be changed to negative 20 percent, Staff proposes it be changed to negative 10 percent, and\nCities propose it be changed to zero.\n\n\n          Mr. Watson's study shows that the most recent five-year and ten-year net salvage ratios are\nnegative 22.10 percent and negative 43.55 percent, respectively.

Specifically, the recommendation is supported by the two-year moving average\nmedian for the same period of negative 12.23 percent.516 Moreover, the one-year, three-year,\nfive-year, six-year, seven-year, and eight-year moving average medians of negative 11.07 percent,\nnegative 14.16 percent, negative 7.62 percent, negative 8.19 percent, negative 11.75 percent, and\nnegative 14.15 percent, respectively, support her recommendation. 517\n\n\n           Mr. Pous' recommendation is based on what he characterizes as the Company's actual,\nunadjusted, experience; recognition of the type of investment in the account; recognition of\nsignificant value of scrap copper; investigation of retirement mix compared to investment mix over\nthe past ten years; and recognition of industry values. 518 According to Mr. Pous, given the\nsignificant increase in the value of copper, the retirement of a transformer could be expected to\nsignificantly influence the net salvage value for this account.\n\n\n           Mr. Pous' recommendation is the outlier among the three before the ALls, and the ALls are\nnot convinced that the reasons put forth by Mr. Pous in support of his position are sufficient to carry\nthe day. The real argument here is between ETI and Staff, which centers on the use of the median\n(Staff) and the mean (ETI). As discussed in Section VII.C.l, the use of the median is the most\nappropriate methodology. For this reason, the ALls recommend the Commission approve Staff's\nproposed negative 10 percent net salvage value.\n\n\n                   (iii) Account 365 - Overhead Conductors and Devices\n\n           The current net salvage value for this account is positive 10 percent. 519 ETI and Staff\nrecommend changing it to negative seven percent, and Cities recommend changing it to zero.\n\n\n\n\n516\n      Staff Ex. 2 (Mathis Direct) at 27.\n511\n      Id. at Appendix C at 4-5.\n518\n      Cities Ex.

Mr. Pous\nnoted that $40 million of investment recorded in this account is associated with clearing rights of\nway, which will not likely be retired or incur cost of removal or gross salvage. Another $40 million\nis associated with investment in copper conductors, which has escalated in demand in recent years\nand should result in positive net salvage. 520\n\n\n          Mr. Watson corrected his analysis and recognized that timing differences between the\nrecording of accounting adjustments related to net salvage (i.e., salvage and removal costs for a\nparticular transaction were not recorded at the same time) made one of the recent years less\nrepresentative of reasonably expected ongoing net salvage levels. He focused, therefore, on longer\nperiod averages and recommends negative seven percent net salvage consistent with the most recent\nten-year ratios. 521 Mr. Watson explained that his adjustments removed relocation activity altogether\nfrom this account because it is not characteristic of the vast majority of retirements and because, if\nthe adjustment is not made, it will shorten and skew the life analysis. Further, Mr. Watson stated\nthat Mr. Pous' claims regarding the impact of copper prices ignore those prices' future volatility and\nare not supported by any analysis or quantification specific to these accounts. Mr. Watson indicated\nthat his recommendations are based on the most clear and reliable source - Company-specific\naccounting data - not \"selective comparisons of industry norms,\" as alleged by Mr. Pous. 522\n\n\n          The AUs find Mr. Watson's explanations of the rationale behind his analysis to be both\ncredible and convincing. Accordingly, the AUs recommend the Commission adopt ETI's requested\nnegative 7 percent net salvage value.\n\n\n\n\n520\n      Id. at 28-29.\n521\n      ET1Ex.13(WatsonDirect)atEx.DAW-l at69.\n522\n      ETI Ex. 71 (Watson Rebuttal) at 68-69.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                             PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE 154\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n                  (iv) Account 368 - Line Transformers\n\n          The existing net salvage value for this account is zero, which both Mr. Watson and Mr. Pous\nrecommended be retained. Ms. Mathis, on the other hand, argued that the net salvage value should\nbe changed to negative five percent.\n\n\n          The argument here is whether the median or the mean best represents the appropriate net\nsalvage value. ETI argues for the mean, and Staff argues for the median. As discussed in\nSection VIl.C.1, the use of the median is the most appropriate methodology. For this reason, the\nAl.J s recommend the Commission approve Staff's proposed negative five percent net salvage value.\n\n\n                  (v) Account 369.1-0verhead Services\n\n          The existing net salvage value for this account is negative 10 percent, which Staff\nrecommends be retained.

ETI argues for the mean, and Staff argues for the median. As discussed in\nSection VIl.C.l, the use of the median is the most appropriate methodology. For this reason, the\nAl.J s recommend the Commission approve Staffs proposed negative 10 percent net salvage value.\n\n\n                  (vi) Account 369.2- Underground Services\n\n          ETI began specifically charging salvage and removal cost to this account just in the last two\nyears, producing a five-year net salvage ratio of negative 15. 75 percent.

Because of the limited available data, Ms. Mathis recommended retaining the existing\nnegative 10 percent net salvage. 524\n\n\n          The AUs agree with Staff that because of the limited retirement activity, a reasonable net\nsalvage rate cannot be calculated from the historical salvage data.           Accordingly, the AUs\nrecommend the Commission adopt the negative 10 percent net salvage value proposed by Staff.\n\n\n          S. General Plant\n\n          General plant includes some accounts that are subject to depreciation, and some that are\nsubject to amortization. ETI proposes to adopt \"Vintage Group Amortization,\" consistent with\nFERC Rule AR-15 for Accounts 391-397.1 and Account 398. This approach, approved by both the\nFERC and the Commission (Docket No. 38339), does not affect the annual level of expense, but\nprovides for timely retirement of assets and simplifies accounting for general property. 525\nMs. Mathis concurred in the Company's proposal to adopt Vintage Group Amortization and with its\nrecommendations for lives, amortization periods, and net salvage. 526\n\n\n          The increase in expense for general plant proposed by ETI is due to the need to reduce the\ndeficit in the general plant reserve caused by inadequate account level rates in the past. 527 This is a\nmatter of debate among the parties, as discussed in more detail below.\n\n\n                       (a) Account 390 - Structures and Improvements (Life Parameter)\n\n          Based on his analysis of the data in comparison to various potential dispersion curves,\nMr. Watson recommended an increase in the life of this account to 45 R2. 528 Ms. Mathis agreed with\nthis life.

Mr. Pous concluded that\n\"superstructures and roadways\" are a significant element in the account which can be expected to\nhave a long life. 529\n\n\n          ETI contends that Mr. Pous' analysis is incorrect. First, as confirmed by his workpapers,\nMr. Watson conducted an analysis of five bands, not a single band as alleged by Mr. Pous.\nFurthermore, Mr. Pous' argument regarding long lives, based on the idea that the investment dates\nback to 1927, is contrary to the actual data showing a minute amount of old investment (0.02 percent\nof the account) dating back only to 1939. The average age of investment in the account, however, is\nonly 15.87 years. Mr. Watson explained that the actual data shows no investment has achieved a life\nof 85 years, as alleged by Cities. 530\n\n\n          The AI.Js believe that the actuarial analysis and curve fitting shown in Mr. Watson's direct\nand rebuttal testimony demonstrate a more reasonable approach, as recognized by Staff witness\nMathis.      Therefore, the AI.Js recommend the Commission adopt the 45 R2 life parameter\nrecommended by ETI.\n\n\n                        (b) Account 390-Structures and Improvements (Net Salvage Value)\n\n          Account 390 is a depreciable account for structures and improvements. Though the current\nauthorized net salvage is zero, Mr. Watson recommended a negative five percent net salvage value,\nand Staff agrees with this recommendation. Mr. Pous recommended a positive 15 percent net\nsalvage value.\n\n\n          Mr. Watson based his recommendation on the most recent five-year and ten-year ratios,\nwhich are negative 1.51 percent and negative 34.27 percent. 531 Mr. Pous disagreed, arguing that:\n(1) Mr. Watson's data adjustments present an incorrect picture of the salvage history; and\n\n\n529\n      Cities Ex.

Such data\nshows that negative net salvage has occurred in every period of the most recent ten-year moving\naverage.       Averages of six years or longer range from negative 4.56 percent to negative\n34.27 percent. 533 ETI also argues that Mr. Pous' attempt to use sales of facilities as an element of\ndepreciation analysis is contrary to Commission precedent regarding building sales 'and that his\nopinion is contrary to the facts that such sales are unique circumstances that do not reasonably\nrepresent the ongoing year-to-year retirement activity that should form the basis of depreciation\nanalysis.\n\n\n          The ALls find that Mr. Pous' arguments are not supported by the facts and that Mr. Watson's\nexplanations are the more credible. Accordingly, the ALls recommend the Commission adopt ETI's\nproposed negative five percent net salvage value for this account.\n\n\n                       (c) General Plant Reserve Deficiency\n\n          A $21.3 million deficit has developed over time in the reserve for the accounts that ETI\nproposes should be converted to General Plant Amortization. This deficit, or under-recovery, has\noccurred because assets have been retired more quickly than can be addressed by the existing\namortization rate. ETI, therefore, proposes a $2.1 million annual expense level to recover the deficit\nover ten years. 534 Ms. Mathis recommended that the amortization of the reserve deficiency be\nrejected and that the deficit be recovered through application of the remaining life method to the\nindividual accounts where the deficit occurred. 535\n\n\n\n532\n      Cities Ex. 5C (Pous Depreciation Study) at 3 L\n533\n      ETI Ex. 71 (Watson Rebuttal) at 73-74.\n534\n      ETI Ex. 13 (Watson Direct) at Ex.

During her cross examination,\nMs. Mathis agreed that she had intended to take the elements of the remaining life calculation\n                                                                     536\nmethod exclusively from Mr. Watson's depreciation study.                   ETI contends that she failed to pull\nthe correct values from Mr. Watson's study and her numbers did not match the corresponding entries\nfrom Mr. Watson's study. 537 For example, Ms. Mathis affirmed that her remaining life calculations\nwere intended to allow recovery of the remaining investment in general plant account 391.2. The\n                                                                                                       538\nremaining investment she provided for was $10.9 million of an original cost of $21.7 million.                The\nactual remaining investment in the account, however, as shown in the data she purported to rely on,\nwas a credit balance of negative $4.4 million, meaning that not only the original cost, but\n$4.4 million additional investment remained unrecovered. 539 Ms. Mathis had no explanation for the\ndifference. In fact, it appears that she erroneously substituted the theoretical reserve for the account\nin Mr. Watson's study ($10.789 million) as the actual book reserve, resulting in an erroneous\n                                                     540\ncalculation of the amount yet to be recovered.             Mr. Watson's rebuttal points out the errors in the\ncalculation and provides an exhibit to properly reflect the remaining life approach that Ms. Mathis\nintended. 541\n\n\n          However, Mr. Watson's rebuttal also explained the reasons that the Company's approach is\nbetter. By using a ten-year amortization period for the deficit, ETI lowers the annual amount of the\nexpense in rates to $2.1 million. Once Ms. Mathis' calculation is corrected, because the remaining\nlives through which the asset value is recovered are so short, 'her remaining life approach increases\nthe annual expense of amortization to $5.8 million.

Moreover, although Ms. Mathis purports to rely on the Commission's\ndecision in Docket No. 38339 in support of her proposal, that case includes no discussion of\nrejecting the proposal on general plant that Mr. Watson makes here. 542\n\n\n          The AUs have reviewed the evidence cited by both parties and the testimony offered in\nsupport of their respective positions. It is clear to the AUs that Ms. Mathis inadvertently did exactly\nwhat ETI alleges - she got numbers confused and, in so doing, confused her analysis.

ETI argues that Mr. Pous'\ncritique is wrong because the five-year life of which Mr. Pons complains is based on standard life\nanalysis.      The life has nothing to do with AR-15, which does not determine such matters.\nMr. Watson's study clearly explains that he based the life parameter on standard actuarial analysis. 543\n\n\n          According to ETI, Mr. Pons' own recommendation points out the fallacy of his arguments\nabout AR-15. He recommended a one-year increase in the amortization, which does not match the\nprevious period of depreciation for this account, or the previous depreciation rate, despite that being\nthe supposed flaw in Mr. Watson's approach. 544 Mr. Watson explained that the use of AR-15 does\nnot involve any independent tinkering with the life of the asset account because the AR-15 process\n\n\n\n\n542\n      Id. at 80-81.\n543\n      ETI Ex. 13 (Watson Direct) at Ex.

Fully Accrued Depreciation\n\n           Mr. Pous claimed that the Company has failed to conform its Commission-authorized\ndepreciation rates when it stops accruing depreciation on accounts and sub-accounts that are fully\naccrued. He testified that the Company must continue to depreciate such accounts, despite the fact\nthat this policy would mandate that the Company intentionally create negative depreciation amounts\nthat do not relate to the existence of any depreciable asset still in existence. Mr. Pous testified that\nneither standard depreciation definitions nor GAAP or National Association of Regulatory Utility\nCommissioners (NARUC) depreciation guidance support the Company's action. 546 The impact of\nMr. Pous' recommendation is to impute an additional $6,447,731 depreciation amount to reduce rate\nbase and amortize that credit over four years, with an associated revenue requirement reduction of\n                   547\n$1,611,933.\n\n\n           ETI argues that Mr. Pous pointed to no instance in which his theory has been adopted by the\nCommission, or any other regulatory body. Other regulators within the Entergy system have rejected\nhis position. 548 The RRC, which sets gas utility rates under essentially the same regulatory\nframework as PURA, has rejected Mr. Pous' position on three separate occasions. 549 ETI contends\nthat Mr. Pous' suggestion violates GAAP, which requires that once an asset's service value (original\n\n545\n      ETI Ex. 13 (Watson Direct) at Ex.

This has been ETI' s practice as\nlong as ETI regulatory accounting witness Considine has been aware. Furthermore, ETI suspends\ndepreciation only so long as the account is fully amortized. Once additional activity hits the account,\ndepreciation will begin again under the Company's automated systems. 550\n\n\n          ETI also argues that Mr. Pous' retroactive approach is unreasonably selective. He would\nreach back into recoveries under existing rates to reclaim revenues associated with the depreciation\nexpense that relates to the fully accrued accounts. According to ETI, Mr. Pous takes no notice of the\ndepreciation taken on new assets that are not included in rate base or recovered through depreciation\nexpense under existing rates. ETI witness Considine notes that Mr. Pous has essentially formulated a\none-sided exact recovery mechanism for depreciation expense that is completely unique in the annals\nof base rates. 551\n\n\n          According to ETI, Mr. Pous also ignores that the remaining life depreciation method already\naddresses any over- or under-accrual of depreciation expense. As depreciation rates and the\nremaining life are adjusted over time, any over (under) recovery will be carried forward and the net\n(if any) of the original investment less any accumulated reserve will begin to be recovered under the\n\nnew and future rate structures. This is the basic concept of remaining life depreciation rates. Thus,\n                                                                        552\nETI contends that no further actions or adjustments are appropriate.\n\n\n          The AUs find that Mr. Pous' recommendation has previously been rejected, by other\nregulatory bodies. There is nothing in the arguments advanced by Cities that changes that fact.\nAccordingly, the AUs recommend the Commission reject Cities' proposal.\n\n\n\n\n550\n      ETI Ex. 46 (Considine Rebuttal) at 44-45, 47.\n551\n      Id. at 43, 45.\n552\n      ETI Ex. 71 (Watson Rebuttal) at 78.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE 162\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n           7. Other Depreciation Issues - Accumulated Provision for Depreciation\n\n           ETI proposes to amortize the $21 million general plant deficiency over ten years. Both the\nCities and Staff agree with and use the accumulated depreciation reserve amounts per account from\nMr. Watson's study. 553 TIEC witness Pollock, in arguing against amortization of the amortized\ngeneral plant reserve deficiency, testified that this reserve deficiency should instead be simply\nreallocated to other depreciable general plant accounts that have depreciation surplus. 554\n\n\n           Mr. Pollock discussed transferring the depreciation reserve between the amortizable and\ndepreciable general plant accounts. He failed to show, however, how the reserve reallocation would\nbe computed and provided no workpapers to substantiate his analysis. ETI argues that without a\nverifiable basis for the computations, his recommendations to recompute general plant depreciation\naccruals should be rejected.\n\n\n           ETI also argues that Mr. Pollock's testimony shows that he has reallocated the amortizable\ngeneral plant deficiency from the amortized general plant accounts to the depreciable general plant\naccounts. The depreciable plant accounts have shorter remaining lives than the ten-year amortization\nof the deficiency proposed by ETI. 555 ETI contends that common sense dictates that transferring\ndollars from an account with a relatively longer remaining life to one with a shorter life will yield a\nhigher annual depreciation or amortization expense, yet Mr. Pollock somehow takes this step and\nstill arrives at a lower level of expense.\n\n\n           According to ETI, Mr. Pollock's methodology has the effect of \"amortizing the difference\nbetween the book and theoretical reserve over a time period that is significantly shorter than the\naverage remaining life of the assets within this function.\" 556 ETI asserts that such an adjustment to\n\n\n\n\n553\n      Id. at 77.\n554\n      TIEC Ex. 1 (Pollock Direct) at 38-39.\n555\n      ETI Ex. 13 (Watson Rebuttal) at Ex.

Rather, TIEC states\nthat it is proposing a more efficient method for ETI to cure its deficits. Because ETI retired\nequipment prior to the end of the assumed life of those assets, there is approximately a $21,300,000\ndeficiency in general plant accounts. ETI seeks to amortize the deficiency over ten years so that the\nbook reserve will \"catch-up\" with the theoretical depreciation reserve for the deficient reserve. TIEC\ncontends that its position is that the catch-up adjustment is not necessary. 558\n\n\n          The ALJs have reviewed the evidence and arguments advanced by the parties and find that\nthose of ETI are more persuasive. Accordingly, the ALJs recommend the Commission reject TIEC' s\nrecommendation.\n\n\nD.        Labor Costs\n\n          1. Payroll and Related Adjustments\n\n          A number of parties suggest various adjustments to ETI' s proposed payroll and related costs.\nIn the application, ETI' s Test Year payroll costs were adjusted downward by $957 ,695 to reflect a\ndecrease in the employee headcount levels at ETI during the Test Year. At the same time, payroll\ncosts were increased in the amount of $1, 105,871 to account for employee pay raises. The net result\nwas that ETI's Test Year payroll expense was adjusted upward by $148,176. Similar calculations\nwere made for ESI employees, resulting in a net upward adjustment for ESI payroll expenses of\n$852,493. Thus, ETI requested an upward adjustment of $1,000,669 ($148,176 plus $852,493) for\nETI and ESI payroll expenses. 559\n\n\n\n\n557\n      Id. at 75-76.\n558\n      TIEC Ex. 1 (Pollock Direct) at 37.\n559\n      ETI Ex. 8 (Considine Direct) at 24-25; 3 at Sched.

As noted above, ETI is proposing an\nupward adjustment to account for pay raises given to ETI and ESI employees. One set of those raises\nwas given to employees in early August 2011, one month after the end of the Test Year. Another set\nof raises was given to employees in April 2012, roughly nine months after the end of the Test Year.\nCities witness Garrett testified that it is acceptable to make an adjustment for the raises made in\nAugust 2011 because they occurred shortly after the end of the Test Year. However, he stated that it\nis unreasonable to include an adjustment for the raises given in April 2012. He believes that any\nincrease in costs due to the April 2012 pay raises might be offset by changes in productivity and the\noverall workforce that may occur during the same time period, such as the replacement of higher-\npaid workers who retire with new, lower paid employees. 560 Thus, Cities propose an adjustment that\nwould reverse ETI's proposed increase for the April 2012 pay raises thereby reducing payroll\nexpense by $1,185,811. 561 No other party makes a similar challenge to the April 2012 pay raise.\n\n\n           With regard to the adjustments proposed by ETI, Staff witness Givens accepted the\nadjustments for headcount changes and the pay raises, but recommended a further downward\nadjustment of $778,034 to account for a further decrease in ETI employee headcount levels from 678\nat Test Year-end to 660 as of February 2012. She also recommended an upward adjustment of\n$158,589 to account for an increase in ESI employee headcount levels from 3,055 to 3,089 as of\nDecember 2011. 562 Ms. Givens also recommended that, in addition to adjusting payroll expense\nlevels, the more recent headcount numbers should be used to adjust the level of payroll tax expenses,\nbenefits expenses, and savings plan expenses. 563 As an alternative to its primary line of attack\n(discussed above), Cities agree with the adjustments recommended by Staff.\n\n\n           ETI also agrees, in concept, with the adjustments recommended by Staff, but contends that\nMs. Givens made some errors in her calculations. First, according to ETI, Ms. Givens used\nerroneous headcounts for the end of the Test Year for ETI and ESL According to the Company,\n\n56\n  ° Cities Ex. 2 (Garrett Direct) at 13-15.\n561\n      Id. at 19.\n562\n      Staff Ex.

Ms. Givens wrongly used\nheadcounts of 678 and 3,055, respectively, which caused a double counting of three ETI employees\nand one ESI employee. 564 Second, Ms. Givens made an error in the calculation of benefits costs\nassociated with the updated ESI headcount. Ms. Givens inadvertently used the ETI percentage in the\ncalculation rather than the ESI percentage shown on her exhibit. 565 Third, Ms. Givens' adjustment\nfor savings plan expense was not necessary and is thus inappropriate. According to ETI witness\nConsidine, savings plan expense is already included in benefits expense levels so it would be double\ncounting to adjust for both benefits expense and savings plan expense. 566 Fourth, Ms. Givens'\nfull-time equivalent calculations need to be corrected. She included an incorrect assumption\nregarding part time employee salaries. Ms. Givens assumed that a part time employee's average\nsalary is 50 percent of the full time average salary. In his rebuttal testimony, Mr. Considine provided\nthe correct calculation of full time equivalents, thereby making it unnecessary to rely upon an\nassumed average. 567 According to Mr. Considine, the combined impacts of these errors is that\nMs. Givens' ETI headcount adjustment overstated her O&M payroll reduction by $224,217, and her\n                                                                                          568\nESI headcount adjustment understated her O&M payroll increase by $37,531.                       No party\nchallenged these corrected numbers.\n\n\n            The Al.J s are unpersuaded by Cities' attempt to exclude the April 2012 pay raises. There can\nbe no real dispute about the fact that the pay raises are known and measurable. Moreover, there is an\nobvious logical inconsistency in the Cities' position - on the one hand they oppose consideration of\ncertain pay raises because they fall outside the Test Year, and on the other hand they support\nconsideration of headcount reductions even though they also fall well outside the Test Year.\n\n\n            The ALls are also persuaded that, conceptually, the adjustments suggested by Staff are\nreasonable and appropriate. Indeed, all parties agree on this point. Moreover, no party challenged\n\n564\n      ETI Ex. 46 (Considine Rebuttal) at 32-33.\n565\n      Id. at 33.\n566   Id.\n567\n      Id. at 34.\n568\n      Id. at MPC-R-5, and MPC-R-6.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                       PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE 166\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nthe corrections to Staff's adjustments that were suggested by ETI, and the AU s can find no basis for\nchallenging those corrections. Thus, the AU s recommend that the Commission: ( 1) accept the\npayroll adjustments proposed in the ETI application~ and (2) accept the further payroll adjustments\nproposed by Staff, corrected by ETI.\n\n\n          2. Incentive Compensation\n\n          One of the hotly contested issues concerns the extent to which ETI should be allowed to\nrecover, through its rates, the incentive compensation it pays to its employees. All parties agree that\nCommission precedent generally identifies two types of incentive compensation, only one of which\nis recoverable. Specifically, pursuant to Commission precedent, incentive compensation that is tied\nto operational goals is recoverable, while incentive compensation that is tied to financial goals is\nnot. 569 In its application, however, ETI requests that it be allowed to recover its Test Year costs of\nall of its incentive compensation costs, regardless of whether those costs are tied to operational goals\nor to financial goals.\n\n\n                       (a) Financially Based Incentive Compensation Should Not Be Recoverable\n\n          ETI acknowledges that costs of incentive compensation tied to financial goals have typically\nbeen disallowed by the Commission. However, ETI asks for the Commission to reconsider its\nprecedents on this issue. 570 ETI argues that the Commission precedent is not, and should not be, a\nhard and fast rule. ETI contends that the reason why cost recovery has been denied for incentive\ncompensation in prior rates cases is that, in those prior cases, there was \"a lack of evidence showing\nsufficient customer benefits.\"571 ETI asserts that, in this case, it has assembled evidence not\npreviously considered by the Commission that shows the benefits to customers of using financial\n\n\n\n569\n    See, e.g.,TIBC Initial Brief at 51-52; see also AEP Application of AEP Texas Central Company for\nAuthority to Change Rates, See Docket No. 33309, Order on Rehearing at FoF 82 (Mar. 4, 2007); Application\nof AEP Texas Central Company for Authority to Change Rates, Docket No. 28840, Order at FoF 164-170\n(Aug. 15, 2005).\n570\n      Tr. at 1726.\n571\n      ETI Initial Brief at 129.\n\fSOAHDOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE 167\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nmeasures in incentive compensation programs.               For example, ETI argues that incentive\ncompensation that encourages the financial health of a company also benefits customers because:\n\n\n           (1)     if a company maintains a financially healthy position, it will tend to have a\n                   lower cost of capital that will in tum benefit customers through lower rates;\n           (2)     a financially healthy company will be more prepared for emergency events\n                   such as storms (which is particularly important in the Gulf Coast areas served\n                   by ETI, which are subject to experiencing hurricanes); and\n           (3)     with financial health, the costs of doing business with suppliers (of both\n                   goods and services, including labor) will remain lower because, for example,\n                   if a company was not in a financially stable condition, suppliers would tend\n                   to demand higher prices or more onerous credit terms, resulting in higher\n                   costs that would lead to higher rates than would otherwise occur.\n\n\n           ETI witness Kevin Gardner, Vice President of Human Resources for ESI, testified that\ncustomers receive benefits from those portions of the incentive compensation plans that are tied to\nfinancial goals and measures. He explained that incentive compensation based on financial metrics\nis a reasonable, necessary, and common component of compensation for companies like ETI. He\nalso opined that such incentives are a market necessity that ETI must include in its compensation\npackage so that it can hire and retain talented employees. He contended that customers benefit from\nthe incentives because they attract and keep qualified people. 572 Mr. Gardner further testified that\ndisallowing financially-based incentives would only encourage utilities to eliminate them, thus\nweakening the alignment of employees' financial interests with the interest of the ratepayers in\nhaving an efficiently run and financially healthy utility. He opined that having only operational\nincentives could encourage utilities to overspend in some areas resulting in an incomplete,\nunbalanced incentive program that would be atypical when compared with American industry in\ngeneral. 573\n\n\n           A second ETI witness, Dr. Jay Hartzell, also testified in favor of the concept of allowing ETI\nto recover its costs associated with its financially-based incentive compensation. He is a professor of\n\n\n572\n      ETI Ex. 36 (Gardner Direct) at 31.\n573\n      Id. at 32.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                         PAGE 168\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nfinance in the business school at the University of Texas at Austin. Dr. Hartzell acknowledged the\nhistorical distinction that has been made by the Commission between compensation tied to financial\nmeasures and compensation tied to operational measures. However, he argues that this distinction is\nbased upon a \"false dichotomy\" and that the more appropriate focus should be on whether customers\nbenefit from the incentive in question, regardless of whether it is a financial or operational\nincentive. 574 Dr. Hartzell summarized his key opinion as follows:\n\n\n           In my opm1on, a well-designed compensation plan that includes incentive\n           compensation tied to cost controls, profitability, and stock prices would tend to\n           provide greater benefits to customers than an otherwise similar compensation plan\n           that did not include any such incentive compensation. 575\n\n           Dr. Hartzell argues that compensation linked to stock prices (provided it is part of a\nreasonable, well-designed compensation plan) has four advantages for customers, :\n\n\n•     helps ensure that managers will consider the financial health of the company when they make\n      decisions, and it is in customers' interests for the company be fmancially healthy;\n•     provides an incentive for managers and employees to ensure that the company operates\n      efficiently, resulting in lower rates than would otherwise occur;\n•     provides a monitoring mechanism for managerial decision-making and the overall quality of\n      management; and\n•     results in lower customer costs because capital markets will tend to reward efficient long-term\n      investments or capital expenditures. 576\n\nDr. Hartzell cited a number of studies which support the theory that the benefits of incentive\ncompensation linked to stock price and profitability measures extend to customers of the company,\nsuch as by lowering the company's cost of capital, increasing the company's ability to respond to\n\n\n\n\n574\n      ETI Ex. 15 (Hartzell Direct) at 3-4, 6, and 9-10.\n575\n      Id. at 7.\n576\n      Id. at 13-14.\n\fSOAR DOCKET N O . -                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                 PAGE 169\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nexternal shocks, improving customer satisfaction, and increasing oversight on managerial\ndecisions. 577\n\n\n          Conversely, Dr. Hartzell opined that if the use of incentive compensation linked to\nprofitability and stock prices is discouraged, via Commission policy disallowing recovery of the\ncosts of such compensation, then utility customers would be adversely affected. For example, if\nemployees did not receive any incentive compensation, salaries would have to be higher to attract\nand retain the same quality of talent. Dr. Hartzell also testified that a compensation plan solely\nconsisting of salary and incentives based on operational performance could likely lead to \"horizon\nproblems,\" meaning that, absent incentives to focus on the long run health of the company, managers\nmight maximize their immediate compensation at the expense of longer-run benefits that the\ncustomer could have enjoyed. 578\n\n\n          All of the other parties oppose ETI' s efforts to recover the costs of its incentive compensation\ntied to financial goals. The parties uniformly agree that the Commission has a well-established and\nstraightforward policy regarding the recoverability of incentive compensation through rates:\nincentive compensation that is tied to operational goals is recoverable; incentive compensation tied\nto financial goals is not. 579 They contend that ETI' s position in this case flies directly in the face of\nthat policy. TIEC points out that ETI has offered no legal authority, such as a statute or rule, which\nwould justify its desire to have the Commission reverse its policy and allow the recovery of incentive\ncompensation tied to financial goals. State Agencies similarly argue that ETI failed to establish a\nreason why the Commission should deviate from its long-standing policy. The parties also support\nthe reasoning behind the Commission's policy: that financially-based incentives are of more\nimmediate benefit to shareholders, not ratepayers, and therefore are not necessary and reasonable for\nthe provision of service.\n\n577\n      ETI Ex. 15 (Hartzell Direct) at 15-21.\n578\n      Id. at 22-25.\n579\n    TIEC Reply Brief at 35; State Agencies Initial Brief at 14; OPC Reply Brief at 12; Staff Initial Brief at 56;\nCities Initial Brief at 67; see also, Application ofAEP Texas Central Company for Authority to Change Rates,\nDocket No. 33309, Order on Rehearing at FoF 82 (Mar. 4, 2007); Application ofAEP Texas Central Company\nfor Authority to Change Rates, Docket No. 28840, Order at FoF 164-170 (Aug. 15, 2005).\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE 170\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          State Agencies point out that, in support of his theory that financially-based incentives\nprovide benefits to ratepayers, Dr. Hartzell relied upon studies of utilities in competitive markets.\nThus, State Agencies contend, the studies are of little to no benefit in evaluating the effects of\nfinancially-based incentives upon ETI customers because ETI is a monopoly that is not subject to\ncompetitive pressures. Moreover, State Agencies examine at length the underlying studies relied\nupon by Dr. Hartzell and assert, essentially, that the studies do not fully support the findings that\nDr. Hartzell ascribes to them.\n\n\n          Staff refutes ETI's contention that the only reason why cost recovery has historically been\ndenied for financially-based incentive compensation is that there has been a lack of evidence\nshowing customer benefits. For example, Staff points out that, in one of the prior dockets cited by\nETI, the Commission disallowed recovery for financially-based incentive costs after stating,\n\"Incentive compensation based on financial measures or goals is of more immediate benefit to\nshareholders.\" 580 This suggests that the question is not, as ETI contends, whether the incentives\nprovide any benefit to ratepayers. Rather, the question is whether the incentives are primarily\nintended to provide benefits to shareholders.\n\n\n          Mark Garrett, an attorney and certified public accountant who works as a consultant in the\narea of public utility regulation, testified on behalf of the Cities in opposition to cost recovery for\nfinancially-based incentive compensation. He stated there are a number of reasons why it makes\nsense to exclude financially based incentive costs from rates: (1) there is no certainty from year to\nyear what the level of incentive payments will be (because incentive payments are conditioned upon\nfuture events and triggers that might not occur), thereby making it difficult to set rates and recover a\nlevel of expense; (2) many of the types of factors that increase earnings per share-such as an\nunusually hot summer or customer growth-are outside the control of employees and have no value\nto customers; and (3) earnings-based incentives can discourage energy conservation. 581 Mr. Garrett\n\n\n\n580\n   Staff Reply Brief at 44, quoting Application of Oncor Electric Delivery Company for Authority to Change\nRates, Docket No. 35717, Order on Rehearing at FoF 92 (Nov. 30, 2009).\n581\n      Cities Ex. 2 (Garrett Direct) at 29-30\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE171\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nalso discussed the results of a survey of 24 other states, which revealed that 17 states closely follow\nTexas' approach, and none allow full recovery of incentive compensation. 582\n\n\n          Mr. Garrett testified that ETI will not be placed at a competitive disadvantage in its ability to\nobtain and retain qualified employees if its financially-based incentives are disallowed. He stated\nthat the Company's total payroll costs for 2011 were 10 percent above the market price, and that\nmost of the above-market payroll costs derived from the incentive program. 583\n\n\n          The AI.Js conclude that ETI should not be entitled to recover its financially based incentive\ncompensation costs. Based upon prior Commission precedents, the AI.Js conclude that the issue is\nnot, as ETI contends, whether such incentives might provide any benefits to customers. The proper\nquestion to be asked is whether they provide benefits most immediately or predominantly to\nshareholders. Without a doubt, the primary purpose of financially based incentives, such as\nincentives tied to earnings per share or stock price, is to benefit shareholders, not ratepayers. Even\nconstruing Dr. Harzell's testimony in the most generous light, any benefits that might accrue to\nratepayers would be merely tangential to that primary purpose.\n\n\n          Moreover, even if the AI.Js were to completely accept as true the opinions offered by\nDr. Hartzell, it would be of limited benefit to ETI because his opinions were almost completely\ntheoretical. The premise of his testimony was that \"a well-designed compensation plan\" that\nincludes incentive compensation tied to financial goals would \"tend to provide greater benefits to\ncustomers\" than a plan that did not include such compensation. 584 He stressed that the customer\nbenefits of incentive compensation tied to financial goals can only exist if such compensation is part\nof a larger, reasonable, and well-designed overall compensation plan. 585 However, he did not\nmeaningfully apply this abstract theory to ETI's compensation plan. For example, Dr. Harzell did\nnot offer an evaluation of ETI' s compensation plan and conclude that it is \"well designed,\" nor did\n\n582\n      Id. at 32-38.\n583\n      Id. at 45-46.\n584\n      ETI Ex. 15 (Hartzell Direct) at 7 (emphasis added).\n585\n      See, e.g., ETI Ex. 15 (Hartzell Direct) at 13.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                       PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE172\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nhe testify that ETI' s incentives tied to financial goals actually provide benefits to its customers. He\nadmitted that he did not study the details of ETI' s incentive plans, nor did he do any type of analysis\nto see if the costs of ETI's incentive programs outweighed their benefits. 586 He did not know the\namounts of incentive compensation that was paid by ETI. 587 One of his major premises was that\nfinancially-based incentives can benefit customers by lowering their costs, but he did not know how\nETI customer's costs compared with customer costs in the other Entergy operating companies. 588\nAnother of his major premises was that financially-based incentives can benefit customers by\nensuring the financial health of the Company, but he made no attempt to determine whether ETI was,\nin fact, a financially healthy company. 589 By confining his testimony to the abstract, it is impossible\nto know whether Dr. Hartzell believes that ETI's incentive compensation tied to financial goals\nachieves the customer benefits that he believes such compensation can theoretically achieve. It is\ntrue that Mr. Gardner described some of the specifics of ETI' s incentive plans. However, because\nDr. Hartzell did not explain the metrics of what he would consider \"a well-designed compensation\nplan,\" it is impossible to know if ETI's plan meets those metrics.\n\n\n          Simply put, the ALls conclude that ETI has failed to establish a sufficient justification for\noverturning the well-established Commission policy that financially based incentive compensation is\nnot recoverable.\n\n\n                      (b) The Adjustment for Financially-Based Incentive Compensation Costs\n\n          Having concluded that ETI is not entitled to recover the costs of its financially based\nincentive programs, it is necessary to determine the amount of those costs so that they may be\nremoved from consideration in this rate case. The parties disagree on the correct amount.

TIEC contends the\n                                     591                                        592\ncorrect number is $6.2 million.            Cities contend it is $8.4 million.\n\n\n          Broadly speaking, ETI has two categories of incentive compensation programs - annual\nprograms and long-term programs. ETI witness Gardner testified that 100 percent of ETI' s\nlong-term programs are financially based, whereas an average, representing a far lower percentage,\nof the Company's annual programs are financially based. 593 Staff witness Givens applied those\npercentages to determine her estimate of the amount spent by ETI in the Test Year on financially\nbased incentives. As to the Company's long-term programs, she recommended removing the entire\ncosts of those programs (i.e. 100 percent) from the cost of service. As to the Company's annual\nprograms, she recommended removing average percentage of the costs of those programs.\nMs. Givens then applied the FICA tax rate to the total amount she identified as financially based\ncosts to account for direct taxes that ETI would have paid as a result of those costs. By her estimate,\nthe FICA taxes associated with ETI's financially based incentives paid in the Test Year totaled\n$429,096. In total, Ms. Givens recommended removing $5,609,093 (representing ETI' s financially\nbased incen,tives paid in the Test Year, plus FICA taxes associated with those payments) fromETI's\nrequested O&M expenses. However, based upon subsequent additional information supplied by\nETI594 relative to the actual payroll taxes paid by the Company for its financially based incentive\ncompensation, Staff has agreed to lower its estimate of FICA taxes from $429,096 to $143,801.\nThus, Staff now recommends removing $5,323,798 (representing ETI's financially based incentives\npaid in the Test Year, plus FICA taxes associated with those payments) from ETI' s requested O&M\nexpenses. 595\n\n\n\n\n590\n    Staff Initial Briefat 56.

However, Mr. Pollock\ncalculated those numbers and percentages in a slightly different manner, leading to a different\nrecommended reduction amount. Just as Ms. Givens did, as to the Company's long-term programs,\nhe recommended removing the entire costs of those programs from the cost of service. ETI witness\nGardner testified that actual percentages of each annual program were quite different than the\naverage percentages for all programs used by Ms. Givens. 596 Thus, as to the Company's annual\nprograms, while Ms. Givens applied the average percentage reduction to all of the annual programs,\nMr. Pollock applied the actual percentage reductions applicable to each of the annual programs.\nBased on Mr. Pollock's calculations, TIEC recommends removing $6,196,037 (representing ETI's\nfinancially based incentives paid in the Test Year) fromETI's requested O&M expenses. 597 TIEC\nappears not to have taken into account any payroll taxes associated with ETI' s financially based\nincentives.\n\n\n          Cities witness Garrett took a substantially different approach when he calculated his estimate\nof ETI's financially based incentive costs. He agreed with Ms. Givens and Mr. Pollock that\n100 percent of the Company's long-term program costs should be removed from the cost of service.\nAs to the annual programs, however, Mr. Garrett defined what qualifies as \"financially based\" much\nmore broadly than ETI, Staff, and TIEC. ETI witness Gardner testified that, when the Company's\nfive annual programs were averaged together, specific percentages of those programs were\nfinancially based, aimed at \"cost control,\" and aimed at \"cost control, operational, safety.\"598\nMr. Garrett added together the percentages representing the financially-based costs, the cost-control\ncosts, and roughly one-third of the cost-control, operational safety costs to arrive at the figure he\nidentified as the amount of ETI' s costs for its annual programs that is \"related to financial\nperformance measures.\" 599 Cities contend this approach is supported by the decision in a prior\n\n\n\n596\n      ETI Ex. 36 (Gardner Direct) at 30 and KGG-4.\n597\n      TIEC Ex. l (Pollock Direct) at 41-45 and JP-7; TIEC Initial Brief at 51-54.\n598\n      ETI Ex. 36 (Gardner Direct) at 30 and KGG-4.\n599\n      Cities Ex. 2 (Garrett Direct) at 39-40, 46-50, MG2.10.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                 PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE175\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ndocket. 600      Based on Mr. Garrett's calculations, Cities recommend removing $8,397,232\n(representing ETI's incentives \"related to financial performance measures\" paid in the Test Year)\nfrom ETI' s requested O&M expenses.601 Mr. Garrett also agreed with Ms. Givens that an additional\nreduction should be made to account for the FICA taxes that ETI would have paid as a result of those\ncosts. 602\n\n\n          The Al.Js reject Cities' attempt to broadly expand the definition of what qualifies as a\nfinancially based incentive to include items such as cost control measures.                 Cities' primary\njustification for doing so is that the Commission has done so previously in the AEP Texas case. As\npointed out by ETI, however, the Commission did so in that case merely because AEP Texas lumped\nits cost control measures in with its financially based incentive costs. The evidence in this case\ndemonstrates that ratepayers benefit when a utility incentivizes its employee to control costs. Even\nTIEC witness Pollock testified that \"incentives that encourage employees to minimize costs are\nprobably more or less in the best interest of ratepayers.\"603                 ETI further provided evidence\nestablishing that cost control incentives that result in lower costs for the Company likewise result in\nlower rates for customers. 604\n\n\n          As to the approaches advocated by TIEC and Staff, the AU s conclude that TIEC' s approach\nmore accurately captures the true cost of ETI' s financially based incentive programs. Rather than\naveraging across all of ETI's annual programs (as was done by Staff), TIEC used the percentage\napplicable to the single annual program that included a component of financially based costs. Thus,\ntheALls recommend removing $6,196,037 (representing ETI's financially based incentives paid in\nthe Test Year) from ETI's requested O&M expenses.

Compensation and Benefits Levels\n\n            In the application, ETI included, as part of its labor costs, $54,965,005 in base payroll paid by\nETI and ESI in the Test Year. It also included $20,428,817 in costs associated with various benefits\n(such as medical/dental, and life insurance) that ETI and ESI provided to their employees. 605 Cities\ncontend that the amounts for base pay and the benefits package should be reduced by $989,370 and\n$2,860,034, respectively, because the amounts paid were above the market price.606 No other party\nchallenges the reasonableness of the base payroll and benefits package.\n\n\n            As to base payroll, Cities contends that the amount paid by ETI and ESI was 1.8 percent\nabove the prevailing market price (above market). 607 Cities witness Garrett acknowledges that ETI\nand ESI are free to pay their employees at above market wages, but he contends that ratepayers\nshould only be asked to pay the market rate for wages, which he contends constitute the only\n\"necessary'' costs of providing utility service. Thus, Mr. Garrett and Cities recommend a 1.8 percent\ndownward adjustment to base payroll expense (or $989,370) \"to bring the company's base payroll\ndown to a market-based level.\"608\n\n\n            As to the Company's benefits package, Cities points out that the amount paid by ETI and ESI\nwas 14 percent above market when compared to a peer group of Fortune 500 companies. 609 Cities\nwitness Garrett again contends that ratepayers should only be asked to pay the market rate for\nbenefits, which he contends constitute the only \"necessary\" costs of providing utility service.

Thus, Mr. Gardner testified that, when using a benchmark\nanalysis to compare companies' levels of compensation, it is advisable to view the market level of\ncompensation as a range (e.g.,+/- 10 percent of a mid-point) rather than a precise, single point. 613\n\n\n           ETI also disputes Cities' contention that the Test Year costs of the Company's benefits\npackage were 14 percent \"above market.\" Mr. Gardner acknowledged that the costs were 14 percent\nhigher than those of Fortune 500 companies, but he pointed out the costs were only 1 percent above\nthe market median of a peer group of utility companies. 614 ETI contends that the comparison against\nthe peer group of utility companies provides a more appropriate comparison for ETI than Fortune\n500 companies. ETI also points out that, even if equal weight were given to the comparisons against\nthe Fortune 500 companies and the peer utilities group, the value of the Company's benefit plans\nwould average within a +/- 10 percent range and, therefore, be at market. Thus, ETI argues that its\nbenefit plan levels are within a reasonable range, and no disallowance should be required. 615\n\n\n\n610\n      Cities Ex. 2 (Garrett Direct) at 58-59 and MG2.9.\n611\n      ETI Ex. 50 (Gardner Rebuttal) at 11.\n612\n      ETI Ex. 36 (Gardner Direct) at 23, and ETI Ex. 50 (Gardner Rebuttal) at 11 n. l.\n613\n      ETI Ex. 50 (Gardner Rebuttal) at 11-12.\n614\n      ETI Ex. 36 (Gardner Direct) at 42.\n615\n      ETI Ex. 50 (Gardner Rebuttal) at 13-14; ETI Initial Brief at 139-142.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                 PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                         PAGE 178\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          The ALls conclude that ETI has met its burden to prove the reasonableness of its base pay\nand incentive package costs. The ALls agree that it is reasonable to view market price for these\ncategories of costs as lying within a range of +/- 10 percent of median, rather than being a single\npoint along a spectrum. As to both base pay and the incentive package, ETI has proven that its costs\nfall within such an acceptable range. Accordingly, the ALls recommend rejecting the adjustments\nsought by Cities.\n\n\n          4. Non-Qualified Executive Retirement Benefits\n\n          ETI provides three types of supplemental executive retirement plans: the Pension\nEqualization Plan, the Supplemental Retirement Plan, and the System Executive Retirement Plan. 616\nIn the application, ETI included, as part of its labor costs, $2, 114,931 in costs associated with its\nexecutive retirement plans.          The expenses represent non-qualifying retirement plan expenses\ndesigned to provide retirement benefits to key managerial employees and executives who are invited\nto participate in the plans. They are generally available only to employees and executives earning\nmore than $245,000 per year. 617\n\n\n          On behalf of the Staff, Ms. Givens recommended a complete disallowance of the costs for\nthese programs, on the grounds that they are offered to only select, highly compensated employees\nand are excessive. Ms. Givens offered the opinion that the expenses were not reasonable and\nnecessary forthe provision of electric utility service and were not in the public interest.618 On behalf\nof Cities, Mr. Garrett agreed with Ms. Givens' recommendation, arguing that it is fair to have\nratepayers pay for benefits included in regular pension plans, but that shareholders ought to pay for\nany additional benefits included in supplemental plans, \"since these costs are not necessary for the\nprovision of utility service, but are instead discretionary costs of the shareholders.\"619 Mr. Garrett\nalso testified that costs associated with supplemental executive retirement plans are typically\n\n\n616\n      ETI Ex. 50 (Gardner Rebuttal) at 14.\n617\n      Staff Ex. l (Givens Direct) at 22-23; Cities Ex. 2 (Garrett Direct) at 54.\n618\n      Staff Ex. l (Givens Direct) at 23; Staff Initial Brief at 64.\n619\n      Cities Ex. 2 (Garrett Direct) at 55; Cities Initial Brief at 71-72.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE 179\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nexcluded by utility commissions in Oklahoma, Oregon, Idaho, Arizona, and Nevada.620 On behalf of\nOPC, Dr. Szerszen also recommended a complete disallowance of the portion of these costs\nallocated from ESI to ETI.621 She stated that ETI has not shown that ratepayers benefit from the\nexpenses, the costs are not necessary to provide utility service, and that the ESI allocation method is\n               622\nunjustified.\n\n\n           ETI disagrees with all of these criticisms and maintains that the costs of the plans should be\nrecoverable. ETI witness Gardner testified that the supplemental executive retirement plans are\nneeded for attracting, retaining, and motivating highly competent and qualified leaders.              He\nexplained that the Pension Equalization Plan provides supplemental retirement benefits to account\nfor the fact that Internal Revenue Code regulations limit the level of retirement benefits that qualify\nfor tax treatment favorable to ETI and Entergy. The existence of this supplemental benefit program\nallows the Company to pay retirement benefits to highly-compensated employees that are\nproportionate to the compensation they receive while active in their employment. The Supplemental\nRetirement Plan and the System Executive Retirement Plan provide supplemental benefits beyond\nthe amounts restricted in the qualified plan to some participants to attract, retain, and motivate\nemployees.623 According to Mr. Gardner, these types of retirement benefits are widely provided by\ncompanies within the utility business sector. 624 Accordingly, ETI argues that it needs to offer them\nin order to be competitive in the employment market with peer companies, and thereby to retain and\nadequately compensate these employees in terms of future retirement benefits.\n\n\n           The ALl s conclude that the supplemental executive retirement plans are not reasonable and\nnecessary for the provision of electric utility service and are not in the public interest. They are\nnon-qualifying retirement plan available only to employees and executives earning more than\n\n\n62\n  ° Cities Ex. 2 (Garrett Direct) at 56-57.\n621\n   OPC Ex. 1 (Szerzen Direct) at 68.

Because these costs are not necessary for the provision of utility service, but are\ninstead discretionary costs, they should be paid by the shareholders. Accordingly, the AUs\nrecommend an adjustment to remove $2, 114,931, representing the full costs associated with ETI' s\nnon-qualified executive retirement benefits.\n\n\n           5. Employee Relocation Costs\n\n           In the application, ETI included, as part of its labor costs, $436,723 in employee relocation\n         625\ncosts.         ETI contends that, in order to be competitive in the employment market, it must provide\nrelocation assistance to certain of its employees. ETI witness Gardner testified that ETI' s relocation\npolicies and costs are reasonable and consistent with general industry practice. He also testified that\nthe Company's average relocation costs are in line with the relocation costs for the companies\nsurveyed by the Employee Relocation Council. 626\n\n\n           Staff recommends an adjustment to remove the entire $436,723 of ETI's relocation\nexpenses. 627 No other party challenged the legitimacy of relocation expenses. Staff points out that\nETI pays 110 percent of the market median for total annual compensation. 628 Staff contends that the\nfact that ETI pays more than the average market wage demonstrates that employees should be\nsufficiently enticed to join and move around within its organization without the need for ETI to pay\nrelocation expenses to attract employees. Therefore, Staff argues that the relocation expenses do not\nmeet the reasonable and necessary standard required for inclusion in cost of service, nor are the\nexpenses in the public interest. 629 Staff also points out that similar types of payments were removed\n\n\n\n\n625\n      Staff Ex. 1 (Givens Direct) at 25.\n626\n      ETI Ex. 36 (Gardner Direct) at 45-46.\n627\n      Staff Initial Brief at 64; Staff Ex. 1 (Givens Direct) at 24.\n628\n      Staff Ex. 1 (Givens Direct) at 24 (citing ETI Ex. 36 (Gardner Direct) at 26).\n629\n      Staff Initial Brief at 64; Staff Ex. 1 (Givens Direct) at 24.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                             PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE 181\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nfrom cost of service in recent proceedings, such as in Docket No. 28906, where payments for moving\nexpenses or signing bonuses were removed from cost of service. 630\n\n\n           ETI responds by pointing out that Staff does not challenge the reasonableness of the amount\nspent on relocations by ETI. It also contends that most of its peers offer moving assistance. Thus, it\nwould be competitively disadvantaged if it did not offer it as well. ETI reiterates that its relocation\ncosts are reasonable and necessary and should be authorized. 631\n\n\n           The AU s conclude that ETI has the better argument. There is no allegation that ETI was too\nlavish in its relocation expenditures. The only complaint offered by Staff is that ETI' s overall\ncompensation costs are 110 percent of the market median. It does not necessarily follow that the\nrelocation program is unnecessary. ETI provided substantial evidence that, without a relocation\nprogram, it would be at a competitive disadvantage with its peers. Accordingly, the AI.Js reject\nStaffs request to disallow the Company's relocation expenses.\n\n\n           6. Executive Perquisites\n\n           In the application, ETI included, as part of its labor costs, $40,620 in costs associated with its\nexecutive perquisites. Those perquisites consist of financial counseling and tax gross-ups for system\nofficers and executives. Specifically, the financial counseling program promotes maximizing\ninvestment growth opportunities for eligible officers and executives, and allows reimbursement for\ncertain expenses incurred for personal financial counseling services. 632 Staff recommends an\nadjustment to remove the full cost of the executive perquisites ($40,620), reasoning that the costs are\nnot reasonable and necessary for the provision of electric utility service. 633 ETI does not oppose that\n\n\n\n\n630\n  Stafflnitial Brief at 64; Staff Ex. 1 (Givens Direct) at 24, citing Application ofLCRA Transmission Services\nCorporation to Change Rates, Docket No. 28906, Final Order (Apr. 5, 2005).\n631\n      ETI Initial Brief at 143.\n632\n      Staff Ex. 1 (Givens Direct) at 23.\n633\n      Staff Initial Brief at 65; Staff Ex. 1 (Givens Direct) at 23.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE 182\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nadjustment.634 The AU s agree that the adjustment is warranted. Therefore, the AUs recommend an\nadjustment to remove $40,620, representing the full cost of ETI' s executive perquisite costs.\n\n\nE.        Interest on Customer Deposits\n\n          Staff witness Givens adjusted ETI's requested interest expense of $68,985 by removing\n$(25,938) from FERC account 431. 635 This decrease is a result of applying the interest rate of\n                                                                          636\n0.12 percent for calendar year 2012 on deposits held by utilities.              Using the active customer\ndeposits amount of $35,872,476 and the 2012 interest rate, Ms. Givens calculated a recommended\ninterest expense of $43,047 ($35,872,476 multiplied by .12 percent).637\n\n\n          This change, which reflects Commission-approved interest rates for 2012 as set in December\n2011, complies with Project No. 39008 and ETI agreed with this amount. Accordingly, the ALls\nrecommend that the Commission approve this amount.\n\n\nF.        Property (Ad Valorem) Tax Expense\n\n          During the Test Year, ETI's property tax expense equaled $23,708,829.638 Patricia Galbraith,\nETI' s Tax Officer, testified that a proforma adjustment should be made to this level of expense for a\nknown and measurable change that reflects the level of property tax expense ETI will experience in\nthe Rate Year. Specifically, her proposed adjustment would increase the Test Year level of expense\nby $2,592,420 to $26,301,249. 639 As Ms. Galbraith testified, ETI's property tax expense for the\ncalendar year 2012 will be paid in January of 2013 and be based on 2011 calendar year-end values\nfor both net operating income and net plant amounts. 640 Her proposed adjustment is based on an\n\n\n634\n      ETI Initial Brief at 144.\n635\n      Staff Ex. l (Givens Direct) at 24.\n636\n      Setting Interest Rates for Calendar Year 2012, Project No. 39008, Order (Dec. 8, 2011).\n637\n      Staff Ex. l (Givens Direct) at 24-25.\n638\n      ETI Ex. 26 (Galbraith Direct) at 5; ETI Ex. 3 at Sched.

TIEC argues\nthat ETI' s proposed adjustment should be rejected entirely, on the grounds that it is not a known and\nmeasurable change from ETI' s Test Year property tax costs. Ms. Galbraith admitted that she does\nnot know, with certainty, what the relevant property tax rate will be in 2012, nor has ETI received\nany tax bills advising that tax rates will rise. 642 Thus, TIEC witness Pollock testified that ETI' s\nproposed adjustment is not known and measurable and recommended that the Commission reject the\nadjustment and include only the Test Year level of expense in cost of service.643 TIEC further points\nout that the Commission has twice rejected requests to include projected property tax expense in\nrates. 644 For example, in Docket No. 28813, Cap Rock prepared an independent analysis indicating\nthat property taxes were expected to increase to $2,700,000 per year from its test year tax level of\napproximately $900,000 per year. The analysis used an estimated tax assessment of $110,000 with\nan estimated tax rate of $2.47 per $100 of value. The ALls in that case concluded that the property\ntax increases were estimates at the time of the hearing, and thus they were not known and measurable\nand should not be allowed. 645 Subsequently, the Commission adopted the ALls' finding. 646 The\nCommission rejected a similar request from ETI's predecessor Gulf States Utilities (GSU). 647 In\nconsolidated Docket No. 8702, the Commission rejected GSU's request for projected 1989 property\n\n641\n      ETI Ex. 26 (Galbraith Direct) at PAG-1.\n642\n      Tr. at 1221, 1238.\n643\n      TIEC Ex. 1 (Pollock Direct) at 40-41.\n644\n   In re Cap Rock Corp., Petition ofPUC (Staff) to Inquire into the Reasonableness ofthe Rates and Services\nof Cap Rock Energy Corporation, Docket No. 28813, Order on Rehearing at FoF 137 (Nov. 9, 2005) (\"Cap\nRock failed to prove any increase in property taxes above those in the test year-$899,597-was known and\nmeasurable.\"); Application of Gulf States Utilities Company for Authority to Change Rates, Application of\nSam Rayburn G&T Electric Coop., Inc. for Sale Transfer or Merger, Appeal of GulfStates Utilities Company\nfrom Rate Proceedings of Various Municipalities, Docket Nos. 8702, 8922, 8939, 8940, 8946, 8233, 8944,\n8945, 8947, 8948 and 8949, Order at FoF 111(May2, 1991) (\"The 1988 calendar year level of actual property\ntaxes paid should be used in determining rate year taxes because it is a known and measurable change.\").\n645\n      Docket No. 28813, PFD at 99 (Mar. 17, 2005).\n646\n      Docket No. 28813, Order on Rehearing at FoF 137 (Nov. 9, 2005).\n647\n      Docket No. 8702, Order at FoF 111 (May 2, 1991).\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE 184\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ntaxes and instead only allowed the actual calendar year property tax expenses. 648 In both cases the\nCommission found that projected tax expense is not a known and measurable change. 649\nAccordingly, TIEC contends that ETI' s request for a forecasted tax expense increase should be\nrejected. 650\n\n\n            Staff concedes that some level of increase is warranted but argues that the increase should be\nsmaller than ETI is asking for. Rather than an increase of $2,592,420, Staff contends that ETI' s Test\nYear property tax expenses should be adjusted upward by only $1,214,688. 651 Staff witness Givens\narrived at this increase by applying the effective tax rate forthe calendar year2011 to the Staffs Test\nYear end plant in service recommendation. She testified that both of these inputs to her calculation\nare known and measurable and thus may be used to determine the increase. 652\n\n\n            Cities also concede that some level of increase is warranted, but argue that the increase\nshould be smaller than ETI is asking for, and smaller than Staff proposes. Cities contend that ETI' s\nTest Year property tax expenses should be adjusted upward by only 1,134,442. 653 Cities witness\nGarrett offered the opinion that ETI' s proposed adjustment was based on estimates that were\nunreasonably high when compared to the actual tax valuation increases experienced since 2008. Mr.\nGarrett arrived at his projected increase in tax expense by applying the average annual valuation\nincrease experienced over the period of 2009-11 to net plant value for 2011. Cities argue that both of\nthese inputs to the calculation are known and measurable and thus may be used to determine the\nincrease. 654\n\n\n\n\n648\n      Docket No. 8702, Order at 52.\n649\n  Docket No. 28813, Order on Rehearing at FoF 137 (Nov. 9, 2005); Docket No. 8702, Order at 52, FoF 111\n(May 2, 1991).\n650\n      TIEC Initial Brief at 54-56.\n651\n      Staff Ex. 1 (Givens Direct) at 25.\n652\n      Id. at 25-26.\n653\n      Cities Ex. 2 (Garrett Direct) at 61.\n654   Id.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE 185\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          ETI responds to its opponents by pointing out that the Commission has, in the past,\nrecognized that the adjustment proposed by Staff, which was obtained by applying a historical\neffective tax rate to the level of test year end plant in service, is known, measurable, and\nappropriate. 655 ETI also notes that, although it had not done so at the time Ms. Galbraith filed her\ntestimony, ETI has since filed its 2011 year end FERC Form 1 data and now knows both the final net\nincome amounts and net plant values for year end 2011 that will be used to determine the Company's\n2012 tax expense (that will be paid in January of 2013 ). 656 ETI contends that those known values are\nsubstantially larger than the estimates used by Ms. Galbraith when she calculated the proposed\nadjustment, such that the known increases in 2011 net operating income and net plant amounts over\n2010 are so large that, even without the 1 percent increase in tax rate assumed in the property tax\nadjustment, Rate Year property tax expenses will be larger than the $26,301,249 amount requested\nby the Company. 657\n\n\n          The issue with regard to property taxes is whether a level of increase is known and\nmeasurable. The ALls conclude that the approach taken by Staff does the best job of generating a\nknown and measurable value for ETI' s property tax burden in the Rate Year. As explained above,\nStaffs approach is supported by prior Commission precedent. Moreover, unlike the approaches\nadvocated by ETI and Cities, Staffs approach requires no guesswork about future tax rates.\nAccordingly, the AUs recommend that ETI's property tax burden should be adjusted upward by\napplying the effective tax rate for the calendar year 2011 to the final, adopted Test Year-end plant in\nservice value for ETI.\n\n\n\n\n655\n   ETI Initial Brief at 145; see also, Application of AEP Texas Central Company for Authority to Change\nRates, Docket No. 28840, Final Order at FOF 189-191 (Aug. 15, 2005); Petition of General Counsel to\nInquire Into the Reasonableness of the Rates and Services of Central Telephone Company of Texas, Docket\nNo. 9981, 19 Tex.

Advertising, Dues, and Contributions\n\n           In the application, ETI included, as part of its operating expenses, $2,046,214 in costs\nassociated with advertising, dues, and contributions.658 Staff recommended an adjustment to remove\n$12,800, representing contributions to organizations primarily focused on influencing legislative\nactivities. Staff reasons that these costs are not reasonable and necessary for the provision of electric\nutility service. 659 ETI makes no response to the suggested adjustment. 660 The ALls agree that the\nadjustment is warranted. Therefore, the ALls recommend an adjustment to remove $12,800 from\nETI' s costs of advertising, dues and contributions.\n\n\nH.         Other Revenue-Related Adjustments\n\n           Several items within the Company's revenue requirement are interrelated. This means that\nchanges to one area or item will impact one or more additional items, such as the Texas state gross\nreceipts tax, the PUC Assessment tax, and Uncollectible Expenses. 661 From the discussions in\nbriefs, it does not appear that there are any substantive differences among the parties regarding these\namounts, which will ultimately be determined during number running.\n\n\nI.         Federal Income Tax\n\n           As explained by ETI witness Rory Roberts, the Company calculated its income tax expense\nin the cost of service by taking into account only the revenues and expenses included in the cost of\n           662\nservice.

This represents a proper matching of income tax effects to the\nexpenses and revenues that produced those tax effects.663\n\n\n          Mr. Roberts contended that the Commission's past practice of reducing tax expense for a\nconsolidated tax adjustment based on some measure of the tax \"savings\" the utility realized by\njoining in a consolidated group federal income tax return was inappropriate. He testified that it is\nimproper to reduce tax expense for deductions or losses that are not also included in the cost of\nservice. In the case of the Commission's consolidated tax adjustment, tax expense is reduced to the\nextent that utility income is used to offset non-utility affiliate losses, even though those losses are not\n                                                                                   664\nincluded in cost of service or borne in any manner by the utility's customers.\n\n\n          Despite his disagreement with the approach, Mr. Roberts performed a calculation of the\nadjustment using the interest credit methodology adopted by the Commission. He concluded that,\ninstead of positive taxable income, ETI had net tax losses over the 15-year calculation period and\nthus provided no taxable income that could be used to offset affiliate losses. 665 In fact, over the\n15-year period, ETI's tax losses were offset by taxable income produced by other affiliates. Thus,\nETI contends that, were the Commission to be consistent in applying its interest credit methodology,\nit should increase ETI tax expense included in cost of service due to the fact that its affiliates'\ntaxable income had to be used to offset ETI's tax losses. Nevertheless, in its application, ETI\nrejected the interest credit methodology and has not requested that ETI' s tax expense be increased as\na result of the consolidated tax adjustment calculation. No other party to the proceeding challenged\nthe Company's position on federal income tax expense in testimony or at the hearing. The ALls find\nno reason to do so either.\n\n\n\n\n663\n      ETI Ex. 21 (Roberts Direct) at 10.\n664\n      Id. at 10-1 L\n665\n      Id. at 10, and RLR-5.\n\fSOAHDOCKET N O . -                              PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE 188\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nJ.

In the application, ETI requested that\n$2,019 ,000 be included in its cost of service to account for the Company's annual decommissioning\nexpenses associated with River Bend. 666 This is the same amount that was requested and approved\non December 13, 2010, in Docket No. 37744. 667 The amount of $2,019,000 was derived from an\nETI decommissioning study that was completed in 2009.

ETicontends that this decision is supported by an August 9, 2011, letter\nfrom the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 668\n\n\n          Cities argue that the decommissioning expense should be reduced to $1,126,000. 669 Cities\npoint out that the larger amount sought by ETI was merely the amount agreed to by the parties, as\nopposed to being substantively considered and approved by the Commission in Docket No. 37744.670\nIn the current case, ETI was asked through discovery to provide an updated estimate of the annual\ndecommissioning expense responsibility for Texas retail customers calculated using the most current\nTexas jurisdictional decommissioning fund balance.            ETI responded that the current annual\ndecommissioning revenue requirement is $1,126,000. 671\n\n\n          Under P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.231(b)(l)(F)(i), the annual cost of decommissioning for\nratemaking purposes must \"be determined in each rate case based on . . . the most current\ninformation reasonably available regarding the cost of decommissioning, the balance of funds in the\ndecommissioning trust, anticipated escalation rates, the anticipated return on the funds in the\ndecommissioning trust, and other relevant factors.\" The cost determined must then be expressly\nincluded in the cost of service established by the Commission's order.\n\n666\n      ETI Ex. 3 Scheds.

However, ETI relies on P.U.C. SUBST.\nR. 25.23l(b)(l)(F)(iv) and Staff witness Cutter's testimony to contend that it need not adjust the\ncurrent amount being charged.672 Pursuant to subpart (iv), ETI is required to periodically study its\ndecommissioning costs, and such a study must be done \"at least every five years.\" Because its last\nstudy was done in 2009, ETI contends that it need not do a new study now, but may simply rely of\nthe outcome of its last study, which showed that its annual revenue requirement is $2,019,000. 673\n\n\n            Cities agree that ETI is not required to conduct a new decommissioning study at this time.\nHowever, the most current information reasonably available clearly shows that the annual amount\nrequired to meet the total cost determined in the Company's last decommissioning study has\ndecreased. Cities argue that to ignore the most current information available disposal would\nunreasonably shift future costs to current customers and would be a violation of P.U.C.        SUBST.\n\nR. 25 .231 (b)( 1)(F)(i). The AUs agree. ETI' s annual decommissioning revenue requirement should\nreflect the most current calculation of $1, 126,000. Therefore, an adjustment of $893,000 to the pro\nform.a cost of service is needed to reflect the difference between the requested level for\ndecommissioning costs of $2,019,000 and recommended level of $1,126,000.\n\n\nK.          Self-Insurance Storm Reserve Expense [Germane to Preliminary Order Issue No. 5]\n\n            In prior dockets, the Commission authorized ETI to recover $3,650,000 annually for storm\ndamage expenses and to maintain a reasonable and necessary storm damage reserve account of\n$15,572,000. 674       ETI requests to increase the authorized storm damage reserve account to\n$17,595,000 (an increase of $2,023,000) and to increase the annual accrual to $8,760,000 (an\nincrease of $5,110,000).

SUBST. R. 25.23l(b)(l)(G). However, Cities, OPC,\nand Staff oppose the amount of ETI' s proposed annual accrual, and Cities and OPC also oppose\nETI' s proposed target reserve. The parties' recommendations are:\n\n\n                                          Annual Accrual      Target Reserve\n                            Current        $3,650,000          $15,572,000\n                            ETI           $8,760,000           $17,595,000\n                            Cities        $6,150,339           $15,572,000\n                            OPC-1         $2,335,047           $15,572,000\n                            OPC-2         $3,650,000           $15,572,000\n                            Staff         $8,270,000           $17,595,000\n\n           The first component of ETI' s requested annual accrual is $4,890,000 for expected annual\nlosses. ETI explains that this is the amount of annual losses projected to be incurred by ETI from all\nstorm damage, except those over $100 million (the minimum amount likely to be securitized),675\nadjusted to reflect current conditions and current cost levels. 676 This recommended accrual was\ncalculated by ETI witness Gregory Wilson using a Monte Carlo simulation of ETI's loss history. 677\nA statistical distribution was estimated from ETI' s trended loss experience, and the model indicated\nan average annual loss of $4,890,000. Mr. Wilson excluded losses from Hurricanes Rita, Gustav,\nand Ike from the model because those losses were securitized and not recovered through the\ninsurance reserve. 678 ETI adds that results from the model simulation were also adjusted by\nremoving any simulated year in which the total storm loss exceeded $100 million, which would\nlikely be securitized.\n\n\n\n675\n      ETI Ex. 19 (McNeal Direct) at 32.\n676\n      ETI Ex. 14 (Wilson Direct) at 5.\n677\n      Id. at Ex.

In ETI's opinion, a 20-year period balances the interests of future and past ratepayers. It\nadded that Mr. Wilson's calculations were prepared in accordance with generally accepted actuarial\nprocedures, with certain adjustments to reflect the nature of ratemaking for public utilities. 679\n\n\n           ETI also requests a target reserve of $17 ,595,000. It argues that this would be an actuarially\nsound provision to cover self-insured losses. ETI noted that the target reserve was also developed by\nMr. Wilson through the Monte Carlo simulation based upon the ETI's loss history. 680\n\n\n           Cities recommend maintaining the current target reserve of $15,572,000 and adopting an\nannual storm damage accrual of $6,150,399. Cities' proposed annual accrual is comprised of two\nparts: (1) keeping the current accrual of $3,650,000 for projected annual storm expense; and\n(2) adding $2,500,399 annually to bring ETI's reserve deficit amount, as adjusted by Cities, up to a\ntarget reserve of $15,572,000. Cities' witness Jacob Pous testified that the current target reserve of\n$15,572,000 should be maintained given ETI' s plan to divest itself of the transmission system, which\nwould reduce storm damage expenses. 681 For the same reason, Mr. Pous also stated that the\nCommission should maintain the current annual accrual amount that was approved most recently in\nDocket No. 37744.682\n\n\n           According to Cities, ETI witness Wilson acknowledged that his calculations assumed that the\ncurrent transmission system would be owned by ETI, and if the transmission system were sold, his\nanalysis would need to be adjusted. 683 Cities also note that Mr. Wilson included ETI's 1997 ice\nstorm expenses within the historical storm data used for his calculations. 684 As discussed in\n\n\n679\n      ETI Ex. 14 (Wilson Direct) at 11-12.\n680\n      Id. at 9.\n681\n      Cities Ex. 5 (Pous Direct) at 65-66.\n682\n      Id. at 66; see also Docket No. 37744, Final Order at FoF 31 (Dec. 13, 2010).\n683\n      Tr. at 1247.\n684\n      Tr. at 1244-1246.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE 192\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nSection V .F., Cities challenge these expenses. If the Commission determines that those costs should\nbe excluded, Mr. Wilson agreed that it would be inappropriate to include them in his analysis. 685 In\naddition, Cities stated, Mr. Wilson's Monte Carlo model analysis has been rejected in several cases\nby the Commission, as noted by Staff witness Chris Roelse. 686 Cities noted that Mr. Wilson limited\nthe storm reserve expense in his model to $100 million, as anything over that amount might be\nsecuritized. 687 But, Cities contend, Mr. Wilson did not consider that the storm loss history provided\nto him by ETI included only storm damage expenses and not capital costs, which are also included\nwhen determining the amount capable of being securitized. Thus, in Cities opinion, Mr. Wilson's\ncap of $100 million was overstated, and for all these reasons Cities argues that Mr. Wilson's analysis\nshould not be considered reliable.\n\n\n          Finally, Cities note that ETI requested that the annual storm reserve accrual \"would be made .\n. . only until it reaches the recommended target level, at which point contributions to the reserve\nwould reduce to the lower of annual expected losses or actual losses.\"688 In Cities view, this request\nshould be rejected and the accrual should only be modified through a future rate case.\n\n\n          OPC also recommends adjustments to the storm damage reserve and the annual accrual. As\ndiscussed in Section V.F., OPC argues that ETI failed to prove that its storm damage expenses\nbooked since 1996 were reasonable and prudently incurred. Consequently, OPC recommends\ndisallowing all of those charges. Removing those charges would leave ETI with a positive storm\nreserve balance of $41,871,059, which exceeds the currently approved storm reserve balance of\n$15,572,000 by $26,299,059. OPC witness Benedict proposed that this surplus be refunded to rate\npayers at a rate of $1,314,953 per year for 20 years. He also recommended that current annual storm\ndamage accrual of $3,650,000 be maintained, less his proposed customer refund of $1,134,953 per\nyear, leaving a net annual storm damage accrual of $2,335,047 per year. Mr. Benedict acknowledged\nthat some storm damage expenses incurred by ETI since 1996 likely were reasonable and necessary.\n\n685\n      Tr. at 1246-1247.\n686\n      Staff Ex. 4 (Roelse Direct) at 12.\n687\n      ETI Ex. 14 (Wilson Direct) at 9.\n688\n      ETI Initial Brief at 151.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE 193\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nTherefore, as an alternative proposal, Mr. Benedict suggested that ETI's current storm balance\nreserve be set at the last approved amount of $15,572,000 (i.e., without any surplus or deficit) and\nthat the currently approved total annual accrual of $3,650,000 be maintained. In addition, OPC\nargues that Mr. Wilson's Monte Carlo model analysis was flawed because it included expenses that\nETI did not establish were reasonable and prudently incurred.689\n\n\n          Staff witness Chris Roelse agreed that ETI's proposed target reserve of $17,595,000 is\nreasonable. However, he recommended an annual accrual of $8,270,000, which is $490,000 less\nthan ETI' s request. Mr. Roelse pointed out that ETI' s witness calculated the proposed annual accrual\nbased on a Monte Carlo simulation, which projects a loss experience over a longer time than the\nperiod captured in the available loss history. However, Mr. Roelse stated, the Commission has not\napproved the use of these models in prior dockets; instead, it has relied on averaging known\ninsurance losses over a period of time to compute the annual accrual. Using historical loss data,\nMr. Roelse calculated an annual expected storm loss of approximately $4,400,000. When this\namount is added to the proposed annual accrual of $3,870,000 to restore the reserve balance from its\ncurrent deficit, it produces a total annual accrual of $8,270,000, which Staff recommends.690\n\n\n          In response, ETI agreed that if portions of the underlying costs upon which the Monte Carlo\nanalysis was performed are removed from the reserve, then the outcome of Mr. Wilson's analysis\nwould be different. However, ETI stressed that questions about the underlying expenses are not an\nattack on the Monte Carlo analysis itself. Rather, Mr. Wilson provided an analysis based upon\ninformation supplied by ETI, and he did not claim to support the expenses themselves. But ETI\ndisagreed with the challenges to the underlying costs, as discussed in Section V.F. 691\n\n\n          Most of Cities' and OPC's objections to ETI's requested storm damage annual accrual and\ntarget reserve relate to their objections to the underlying expenses, as discussed in Section V .F. For\nthe reasons stated in that section, the AUs denied those objections, and they do not support rejecting\n\n689\n      OPC Ex. 6 (Benedict Direct) at 6-16; OPC Initial Brief at 14-20; OPC Reply Brief at 13-15.\n690\n      Staff Ex. 4 (Roelse Direct) at 10-15; Staff Initial Brief at 13-14.\n691\n      ETI Reply Brief at 81.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE 194\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nETI' s request for the annual accrual or target reserve. Likewise, the AUs find that Cities' concerns\nabout ETI selling its transmission system are too uncertain to justify altering the storm damage\nreserve at this time.\n\n\n        Cities also raised a question about whether Mr. Wilson properly calculated the cap he used to\nexclude from his analysis storms that would likely result in securitized costs. Staff pointed out that\nthe Commission has not approved the use of the Monte Carlo simulation model in prior dockets.\nRather, the Commission has traditionally used known insurance losses over a period of time. The\nAUs note that neither PURA nor the Commission's rules either require or prohibit the use of\nactuarial models, such as the Monte Carlo simulation. The prior dockets cited by Staff did not adopt\nthe recommendations developed by actuarial models, but the Commission also did not expressly\nreject the models in those cases. Likewise, however, ETI has not cited any Commission decisions\nthat expressly adopted or used such models.\n\n\n        Staff witness Chris Roelse explained that the Commission has traditionally averaged known\ninsurance losses over a period of time to compute the annual accrual. He made such a calculation\nthat produced an annual accrual for storm damage loss of $4,400,000. When added to the proposed\nannual accrual of $3 ,870,000 to restore the reserve balance from its current deficit, the total annual\naccrual equals $8,270,000. No party challenged that calculation. Because a question remains as to\nwhether Mr. Wilson properly calculated his cap to exclude storm damage expenses that would likely\nbe securitized, the AUs find it is more reasonable to adopt the annual accrual proposed by Staff.\nTherefore, the AU s recommend that the Commission approve a total annual accrual of $8,270,000,\ncomprised of an annual accrual of $4,400,000 to provide for average annual expected storm losses,\nplus an annual accrual of $3 ,870,000 for 20 years to restore the reserve from its current deficit. The\nAU s also recommend approval of ETI' s proposed target reserve of $17 ,595,000. Finally, the AU s\nrecommend that the Commission require ETI to continue recording its annual accrual until modified\nby an order in a future rate case, as requested by Cities. Otherwise, ETI could continue to receive\nrates based on the total accrual amount, but not record the receipts in the storm damage reserve. The\nAUs find that such circumstances would not result in just and reasonable rates.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                          PAGE 195\nPUC DOCKET NO. 398%\n\n\nL.        Spindletop Gas Storage Facility\n\n          Cities challenged ETI' s use of the Spindletop Facility, arguing that the costs of operating it\noutweigh the benefits gained from it. In Section V.H., the AI.Js rejected Cities' contention that a\nsubstantial portion ofETI's annual costs to operate the Spindletop Facility should be removed from\nETI' s rate base. For the same reason he challenged the Spindletop Facility costs associated with rate\nbase, Cities witness Nalepa also challenges a portion of ETI' s costs derived from the Spindletop\nFacility that are associated with operating expenses. Specifically, Mr. Nalepa and Cities argue that\n$2,090,116 (consisting of $309,751 in depreciation expense and $1,780,365 associated with the\nSpindletop Facility) ought to be removed from ETI' s operating expenses. 692 For the same reason that\nthey rejected Cities' Spindletop Facility arguments relevant to rate base, the AI.J s also reject Cities'\nSpindletop Facility arguments relevant to operating expenses.\n\n\n VIII.      AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS [Germane to Preliminary Order Issue No. 3]\n\n          PURA requires that more stringent standards be applied to affiliate expenses than are applied\nto other utility company expenses. Section 36.058 begins by stating \"except as provided by\nSubsection (b),\"the PUC may not allow as capital cost or as expense a payment to an affiliate for the\ncost of a service, property, right, or other item or interest expense. Subsection 36.058(b) provides\nthat the Commission may allow an affiliate payment \"only to the extent\" that the PUC finds the\npayment is reasonable and necessary for each item or class of item as determined by the\nCommission.\n\n\n          The seminal case interpreting PURA' s affiliate transaction standard under Section 36.058 is\nRailroad Commission v. Rio Grande Valley Gas Company. 693 In that case, the court recognized that\nPURA' s affiliate transaction statute created a presumption that a payment to an affiliate is\nunreasonable. The court explained:\n\n\n\n\n692\n      Cities Ex. 6 (Nalepa Direct) at 19; Cities Initial Brief at 76.\n693\n      683 S.W. 2d 783 (Tex.

The court interpreted the PURA affiliate transaction statute and explained\nfour major areas in which Rio had failed to meet its burden of proof:\n\n\n•     Plaintiff had the burden of showing that the prices it was charged by its affiliate were no higher\n      than the prices charged by the supplying affiliate to its other affiliates ....\n\n•     Plaintiff had the burden of showing that expenses which may not be allowed for rate making\n      purposes for any reason ... were not included in the \"allocated expenses.\" ...\n\n•     Plaintiff had the burden of proving that each item of allocated expense was reasonable and\n      necessary....\n\n•     Plaintiff had the burden of proving that the allocated amounts reasonably approximated the\n      actual cost .of services to it. ...\n\n          fu 2000, the Third Court of Appeals once again spoke on the issue of affiliate transactions in\nthe utility setting.    fu Central Power and Light Company/Cities of Alice v. Public Utility\nCommission, the court cited to Rio Grande Valley Gas Company and stated:\n\n\n         Because of the possibility for self-dealing between affiliated companies, however,\n         expenses paid to an affiliated entity are presumptively not included in the rate base.\n         A utility can overcome this presumption against affiliate expenses only if it\n         demonstrates that its payments are 'reasonable and necessary for each item or class of\n                                                    694\n         items as determined by the commission. '\n\nPURA Section 36.058 places a greater burden of proof on the utility to prove the reasonableness and\nnecessity of its affiliate transactions because of the nature of the relationship between the utility and\nits affiliates. These transactions are not considered to be arms-length, and there is a potential for\n\n\n694\n      36 S.W.3d 547 at 564 (Tex.

The transactions must be disallowed for regulatory purposes, unless the utility presents\nsufficient evidence that it has met each of the affiliate transaction statutory requirements. If the\nregulatory tests for affiliate transactions are not properly enforced, the regulated utility may become a\nvehicle for cross-subsidization by ratepayers of other regulated or unregulated affiliates.\n\n\n          OPC witness Szerszen was the only witness to challenge ETI's affiliate transactions, 695\nrecommending a total affiliate disallowance (after erratas) of $8,945 ,221. 696 Dr. Szerszen reviewed a\nselect subset of ETI' s affiliate expenses using the PURA affiliate transaction standards. She\nreviewed the Company's affiliate transactions on a project by project basis, noting that such a review\nwas more efficient and easier to understand. 697            Dr. Szerszen testified that a review by the\nCompany's 25 classes of service presents a far too macro view of affiliate transactions that does not\nallow an adequate review of ETI' s affiliate transactions according to PURA mandates and takes the\nfocus away from the important issues. 698\n\n\n          OPC notes that PURA Subsection 36.058(f) requires that if the Commission finds an affiliate\nexpense for the test period to be unreasonable, then the Commission is to make a determination of\nwhat level of the expense is reasonable. By analyzing ETI' s affiliate transactions on a project basis,\nOPC contends that it has facilitated the Commission's ability to make such a determination for each\nof ETI' s classes of service; instead of an \"up or down\" decision on the macro level of expense for the\nclass, the Commission can disallow the portion not shown to be reasonable and approve the\nremainder as reasonable.\n\n\n\n\n695\n     Cities witness Mark Garrett recommended disallowance of certain short-term incentive compensation\naffiliate costs, but those disallowances are largely also recommended by Dr. Szerszen. See ETI Ex. 69\n(Tumminello Rebuttal) at 17. ETI contends that the duplicated disallowances by Dr. Szerszen and Mr. Garrett\nwould result in double counting $217 ,520 of the requested affiliate charges and requests that if the AUs rule in\nOPC' sand Cities' favor regarding these short-term incentive compensation costs, that disallowance should be\nreduced by $217,520. ETI Initial Brief at 157, n. 898.\n696\n      Tr. at 1607.\n697\n      OPC Exhibit No. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 42-43.\n698\n      OPC Exhibit No. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 42-43; Tr., at 1671-72.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                   PAGE 198\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          ETI disagrees with OPC's contentions and argues that Dr. Szerszen's approach to addressing\nthe Company's affiliate case is inappropriate for a number of reasons and should be rejected.\n\n\n•     First, her approach is directly contrary to the Commission's Guiding Principles included as part\n      of the Commission's Transmission and Distribution Cost of Service Rate Filing Package that\n      was issued on April 2, 2003. 699 Item 2 of the Guiding Principles clearly states that a class of\n      service approach is required for purposes of complying with the provisions of Section 36.058 of\n      PURA. 700 Dr. Szerszen ignores the class of service approach required by Section 36.058 of\n      PURA as detailed in the Guiding Principles, and instead states OPC' s case on a project code-by-\n      project code basis.\n\n•     Second, Dr. Szerszen's approach is directly contrary to the Commission's directives in Docket\n      No. 16705. In that docket, the Commission disallowed a substantial amount of affiliate expense\n      because Entergy Gulf States, Inc. had done then what Dr. Szerszen proposes here - based the\n      affiliate analysis solely on project codes, rather than affiliate classes of service. Because the\n      Commission found that a scope statement/project code-based affiliate analysis is \"impossible,\"\n      the Company, in its subsequent base rate cases, including its filing in this docket, changed to a\n      class-based presentation, as directed by the Commission.\n\n•     Third, by refusing to consider a class-based analysis, Dr. Szerszen has ignored the Company's\n      testimony, presented by 19 affiliate witnesses, which explains in detail why the Company's\n      affiliate-incurred costs meet the Section 36.058 of PURA and Rio Grande standards. 701\n      According to ETI, the Company's affiliate class witnesses, who are knowledgeable about the\n      activities that are encompassed in each of their classes, have each shown why the services\n      provided through those classes are necessary. They have each also addressed numerous\n      Commission-recommended metrics to measure the reasonableness of costs, including cost trends,\n      staffing trends, the budgeting process, and, if applicable, benchmarking and outsourcing\n      comparisons. 702 Their testimony and exhibits, according to ETI, show numerous different\n      \"views\" of the costs in their classes, including the project codes that comprise their classes. Each\n      affiliate witness also addressed the \"not higher than\" and \"reasonably approximates cost\"\n      standards applicable to affiliate costs. ETI contends that the evidence provided by its witnesses\n      meets the requirements of these Guiding Principles and supports the Company's burden of proof\n      for the recovery of affiliate costs. ETI also contends that Dr. Szerszen ignores this overwhelming\n\n\n699\n      See ETI Ex. 69 (Tumminello Rebuttal) at Ex. SBT-R-1.\n700\n    Dr. Szerszen conceded that the Guiding Principles require that a utility's affiliate case be presented in a\nsufficient number of class or other logical groupings. Tr. at 1632.\n701\n    Dr. Szerszen claimed that, instead of considering the narrative class testimony, she instead \"looked at more\nof the detail,\" presumably meaning the exhibits. Tr. at 1629.\n702\n   ETI Ex. 69 (Tumminello Rebuttal) at Ex. SB T -R-1. Dr. Szerszen conceded that the Company's testimony\nincluded proof items such as benchmarking data, outsourcing, staffing trends, and cost trends. Tr. at 1631.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE 199\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n      evidence and the careful attention paid to presenting it in an organized manner. In addition, she\n      presents no evidence in accordance with the Guiding Principles that supports her proposed\n      disallowances.\n\n•     Fourth, the Company's case is much less cumbersome and less complex than the approach\n      suggested by OPC, which would require a showing on the necessity, reasonableness, \"not higher\n      than,\" and \"reasonably approximates cost\" standards for each of almost 1,300 project codes\n      subject to this docket. Even if the Company were to do that, Dr. Szerszen's \"cherry picking\"\n      approach among the project codes ignores any savings in other project codes that would\n      comprise a class of affiliate costs, thereby resulting in an overall reasonable level of costs within\n      the class even assuming that any of her complaints about individual project codes had merit.\n\n•     Fifth, ETI contends that Dr. Szerszen fails to mention Section 36.058(f) of PURA, which\n      requires that the Commission determine the reasonable level of \"an affiliate expense\" if it first\n      finds that the expense presented is unreasonable. But rather than offering an alternative\n      \"reasonable\" level of an expense\"\", she either categorically disallows all costs in that project; or,\n      in some instances, substitutes an arbitrary sharing or allocation of costs between ETI and its\n      regulated affiliates, or ETI and its non-regulated affiliates. In doing so, Dr. Szerszen does not\n      make any evidence-based attempt to ground her alternative allocation (and associated\n      disallowance of ETI affiliate costs) on any objective basis reflecting cost causation principles.\n      ETI contends that the effect of her approach is to presume that the Company needs zero dollars in\n      its cost of service to perform a variety of essential utility support activities.\n\n•     Sixth, Dr. Szerszen' s positions in the 2009 Oncor rate case,703 which she agrees are similar to her\n      positions in this ETI base rate case, 704 were rejected by the two SOAH AU s and the Commission\n      in that docket. ''Many of the allegations and arguments made by Dr. Szerszen in this case are\n      very similar, if not identical, to the points she asserted in the Oncor case.\n\n          The AU s agree that the Commission's Guiding Principles set forth the minimum that a\nutility must present to establish a prima facie case, and it is clear that ETI met that burden. That,\nhowever, is not the end of the question. Permitting a utility to escape further scrutiny of its affiliate\ntransactions by resting on its prima facie presentation imposes too many limits and, as suggested by\nOPC, presents too macro a view to be a legitimate review for rate case purposes.\n\n\n\n\n703\n   Application of Oncor Electric Delivery Company, LLC for Authority to Change Rates, Docket No. 35717\n(PFD issued on Jun. 2, 2009; Order on Rehearing issued on Nov. 30, 2009) (Oncor).\n704\n      Tr. at 1656.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE200\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          OPC performed essentially a sample review of ETI' s affiliate transactions. The review was\nnot exceptionally large, and (as evidenced by ETI' s concurrence in the removal of some of the costs)\nit represented an additional layer of review to ensure that improper costs would not inadvertently be\ncharged to ratepayers. That, of course, is not the sole focus of OPC' s review, but it is important for\npurposes of determining whether the review itself is appropriate. If intervenors and Staff were\nlimited to the macro level of review urged by ETI, such matters would never be revealed and there\nwould exist a possibility that ratepayers would be charged for matters not their responsibility. The\nALJs do not characterize OPC's review as \"cherry picking.\" It is more a reasonable sample for\nexamination that gives ETI a reasonable opportunity to explain the reasons for the charges to\nratepayers. Accordingly, the ALJs find that the Commission's Guiding Principles do not limit the\nreview performed by OPC, and the review performed by OPC is not contrary to the Commission's\nholdings in Docket No. 16705.\n\n\nA.        Large Industrial & Commercial Sales Reallocation\n\n          OPC contends that ETI incurs considerable amounts of sales and marketing expenses that are\nexclusively for the benefit of the larger commercial and industrial customers. However, most of\nESI' s sales, marketing, and customer service expenses are allocated to residential and small business\ncustomers. 705 The vast majority of the sales, marketing and customer service expenses are allocated\nto the operating companies based on customer counts, the majority of these expenses are\nconsequently allocated to residential and small business customers. In the test year, residential and\nsmall general service customers made up 94.8 percent of the ETI total customer count. ETI' s\nGeneral Service, Large General Service, and Large Industrial Power Service, and Lighting classes\ncombined comprise only 5.2 percent of ETI' s customers. For the test year, OPC argues that ETI is\nrequesting the recovery of $2.086 million of sales, marketing, billing and load research expenses that\nbenefitted only the large customer service classes. OPC contends that it is inappropriate for\nresidential and small customers to pay for these expenses, when cost causation is so readily\nidentifiable, particularly since a disproportionately small portion of larger customer sales and\n\n\n\n705\n      OPC Ex. l (Szerszen Direct) at 45.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE201\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nmarketing expenses is allocated to ETI's largest customers. 706 The total recommended reallocated\nlarge customer expense is $2,086,145.\n\n\n          ETI and TIEC oppose OPC' s recommendation, arguing that it is \"cherry-picking\" and that the\nevidence does not demonstrate that the $2.086 million of affiliate expense should be directly\nassigned to the large commercial and industrial classes. 707\n\n\n          With respect to the first argument, ETI and TIEC contend that Dr. Szerszen developed her\nadjustment by examining a limited sample of affiliate project code summaries and making the call,\nbased on project code descriptions, that certain affiliate costs for marketing, sales and customer\nservice expense should be directly assigned to large commercial and industrial customers. 708 Both\nTIEC and ETI contend that the bias and results-oriented nature of her recommendation became\napparent when Dr. Szerszen admitted on cross examination that she made no effort to examine\nwhether certain affiliate costs should be directly assigned to residential and small customers.709 Both\nETI and TIEC contend that it is inappropriate to take a \"limited sample of costs\" and directly assign\nthem to a particular class.\n\n\n          According to TIEC, Dr. Szerszen admitted that it could have been appropriate to make an\nadjustment for direct assignment of costs to small commercial and residential customers based on\nprinciples of cost causation. 710 However, she made no effort to do that herself, nor did she ask ETI\nto conduct such an analysis. 711 The parties argue that the evidence shows that Dr. Szerszen's\nrecommendation rests on an incomplete analysis of ETI's affiliate costs and her recommendation\nshould be rejected because direct assignment of costs is only appropriate if there has been a thorough\n\n\n\n\n106\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 45.\n707\n      ETI Ex. 55 (LeBlanc Rebuttal) at 5; TIEC Ex. 3 (Pollock Cross Rebuttal) at 36.\n708\n      Tr. at 1609.\n709\n      Tr. at 1609-10.\n710\n      Tr. at 1685.\nrn Tr. at 1613-1624.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE202\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nand complete cost study analysis to determine what costs are or are not appropriate for direct\nassignment to all of the classes.\n\n\n           TIEC further argues that the evidence did not demonstrate that the $2.086 million of affiliate\nexpense that Dr. Szerszen proposes for direct assignment to large commercial and industrial\ncustomers is solely attributable to costs caused by those customers. Mr. Pollock testified that the\nproject codes Dr. Szerszen selected include load research expenses that benefit residential and small\ncommercial customers. 712 TIEC pointed out that ETI witness Stokes testified that the billing\nmethods used for the affiliate expenses for customer service operations and retail operations were\nfair and reasonable.713 According to TIEC, Dr. Szerszen's proposal should be rejected because her\nassertion that these expenses exclusively benefit large commercial and industrial customers is\nincorrect.\n\n\n           The AU shave reviewed the arguments of the parties and find that Dr. Szerszen' s analysis is\nfar from complete. It appears to be result-oriented, ignoring critical aspects (such as failing to make\nan adjustment for direct assignment of costs to small commercial and residential customers based on\nprinciples of cost causation). The AUs believe that Dr. Szerszen's analysis with respect to this issue\nshould not be adopted.\n\n\nB.         Administration Costs\n\n           Dr. Szerszen recommended disallowance of $94,709 (25 percent) of the charges in\nProject F3PCFACALL, contending that ESI failed to directly charge any of the costs in this project\ncode to ETI. She claimed that the billing method applied to this project code by ESI (that is, Billing\nMethod \"SQFALLC\"), which is based on square footage, is not appropriate for these types of\n         714\ncosts.\n\n\n\n\n712\n      TIEC Ex. 3 (Pollock Cross Rebuttal) at 35.\n713\n      ETI Ex. 66 (Stokes Rebuttal) at 3.\n714\n      OPC Ex. l (Szerszen Direct) at 80-82.\n\fSOAHDOCKET N O . -                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE203\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          ETI witness Plauche explained that the costs captured in this project code are primarily for\nthe oversight of administrative functions, such as facilities, real estate, and security.715 This project\ncode applies to the administration of these types of functions. These services benefit all companies\nthat receive facility services and are not attributable to any one specific Entergy affiliate. Therefore,\nit is appropriate to bill these costs to all companies based on their pro rata share of square footage\noccupied. 716\n\n\n          The AUs concur that this is the appropriate method to employ and, therefore, recommend\nthat the Commission approve the inclusion of these costs as requested by ETI.\n\n\nC.        Customer Service Operations Class\n\n          Dr. Szerszen recommended disallowances in seven project codes covered primarily by ETI' s\nCustomer Service Operations Class: (1) F3PCR29324 (Revenue Assurance - Adm.) for a\ndisallowance of $70,849; (2) F3PCR53095 (Headquarter's Credit & Collect) for a disallowance of\n$110,338; (3) F3PCR73380 (Credit Systems) for a disallowance of $73,562; (4) F3PCR73458\n(Credit Call Outsourcing) for a dis allowance of $197; (5) F3PCR73381 (Customer Svc Cntr Credit\nDesk) for a disallowance of $43,378; (6) F3PCR73390 (Customer Svs Ctl - Entergy Bus) for a\ndis allowance of $60, 926; and (7) F3 PCR73403 (Customer Issue Resolution - ES) for a dis allowance\nof $1,869. 717\n\n\n          1. Projects F3PCR29324 (Revenue Assurance· Adm.), F3PCR53095 (Headquarter's\n             Credit & Collect), F3PCR73380 (Credit Systems), and F3PCR73458 (Credit Call\n             Outsourcing)\n\n          For the costs captured by these project codes, Dr. Szerszen recommended that the costs be\nreallocated based on the Company's 10 percent \"bad debt\" expense percentage.\n\n\n\n\n715\n      ETI Ex. 20 (Plauche Direct) at 15-26.\n716\n      ETI Ex. 69 (Tumminello Rebuttal) at Ex.

These functions ensure the most efficient processes are used in managing\nwrite-offs for all the Operating Companies and have contributed to Entergy' s first quartile ranking in\nbenchmarking of credit and collection operations. These managerial and supervisory costs, which\ninclude bankruptcy administration, surety administration, arrears management, collection agency\nadministration, skip tracing, and final bill collections, remain consistent whether ETI's bad debt\npercentage is 10 percent, 30 percent, or any other percent and are appropriately allocated using the\nCUSTEGOP billing method, which is based on the number of electric and gas customers for each\nOperating Company. 718\n\n\n          ETI has provided credible evidence that it has chosen the correct billing methodology.\nTherefore, the Al.Js recommend the Commission approve inclusion of these costs as requested by\nETI.\n\n\n          2. Projects F3PCR73381 (Customer Svc Cntr Credit Desk), F3PCR73390 (Customer\n             Svs Ctl • Entergy Bus), and F3PCR73403 (Customer Issue Resolution - ES)\n\n          Dr. Szerszen recommended that these costs be reallocated using the CUSTCALL billing\nmethod. Given ESI's demonstrated tracking capabilities, Dr. Szerszen reallocated the costs of this\nproject using a 10.8 percent customer call allocator, which is on the low end of the\n10.70 percent-11.04 percent Test-Year CUSTCALL allocators. 719\n\n\n          ETI witness Stokes believes that Dr. Szerszen' s proposed reallocation is arbitrary and fails to\nconsider the cost causation associated with the actual project code at issue. These costs are not\ndriven by a specific proportion of calls from each Operating Company (that is, by the CUSTCALL\nallocator). The costs captured by Project F3PCR73345 reflect the costs of overseeing the Quick\n\n\n\n718\n      ETI Ex. 66 (Stokes Rebuttal) at 15-16.\n719\n    OPC Exhibit No. l (Szerszen Direct) at 77 and 118; OPC Exhibit No. 27 (ETI's Ex.

Accordingly, the ALls recommend the Commission approve the costs\nproposed by ETI.\n\n\nD.       Distribution Operations Class\n\n         Dr. Szerszen addressed three project codes that are within the Distribution Operations Class:\n(1) F5PCDW0200 (Lineman's Rodeo Expenses) for adisallowanceof $7; (2) F3PCTJGUSE(Joint\nUse With Third Party E) for a disallowance of $6,405; and (3) F3PCTJTUSE (Joint Use With 3rd\nParties -A) for a disallowance of $36,293. 720\n\n\n         1. Project F5PCDW0200 (Lineman's Rodeo Expenses)\n\n         Dr. Szerszen claimed that the expenses captured by this project should be disallowed because\nETI is a monopoly and Texas ratepayers should not have to pay for corporate image costs.\n\n\n         ETI witness Tumminello responds, stating that this minimal amount is related to a safety\ncompetition known as the \"Lineman's Rodeo,\" it is not a corporate \"image\" expense. The cost,\naccording to Ms. Tumminello, is driven by Entergy employee safety in the Distribution business\nunits. 721\n\n\n         The AI.Js agree that the Lineman's Rodeo competition is not a corporate image expense,\nrather it is designed to promote employee safety. The AI.Js recommend the Commission approve\ninclusion of the costs captured by this project as requested by ETI.\n\n\n\n720\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 66, 75.\n721\n      ETI Ex. 41 (Tumminello Direct) at Ex.

Projects F3PCTJGUSE (Joint Use With Third Party- E) and F3PCTJTUSE (Joint\n             Use With Third Parties - A)\n\n          Dr. Szerszen recommends exclusion of these two projects, which she claims represent the\ndifference between the costs incurred for ETI for pole rental costs and the revenues received from\npole space rentals.\n\n\n          With respect to this proposed disallowance, ETI witness McCulla states that Dr. Szerszen has\nconfused the rental of space on transmission poles and the rental of space on distribution poles. She\nhas essentially performed a cost-benefit analysis that erroneously compares the cost of providing\nrental space on distribution poles with the income received solely from rental of space on\ntransmission poles. Mr. McCulla explained that data for the distribution poles show that the more\nthan $2.5 million in revenues from distribution pole rentals far exceeds the $67, 174 in costs billed to\nETI under these two project codes and, therefore, Dr. Szerszen's misassumption that the revenues\nwere less than the costs incurred is unfounded. 722\n\n\n          The AU s find that Dr. Szerszen erred. Making the correct comparison, as demonstrated by\nMr. McCula, shows there is no basis for the disallowance claimed by Dr. Szerszen. The ALls,\ntherefore, recommend the Commission deny the requested disallowance.\n\n\nE.        Energy and Fuel Management Class\n\n          Dr. Szerszen addresses seven project codes that are within the Energy and Fuel Management\nClass: (1) F3PCCSPSYS (System Planning And Strategic) for a disallowance of                   $29,304;\n(2) F3PCWE0140 (EMO Regulatory Affairs) for adisallowance of $114,468; (3) F3PPSPE002 (SPO\n2009 Renewable RFP Expense) for a disallowance of $3,014; (4) F3PPSPE003 (SPO Summer 2009\nRFP Expense) for a disallowance of $56,672; (5) F3PPSPE004 (SPO Summer09RFP\nIM&Propslsubmt) for a disallowance of $42,018; (6) F3PPWET300 (SPO 2008 Western Region\n\n\n\n\n722\n      ETI Ex. 59 (McCulla Rebuttal) at 8-12.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                              PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE207\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nRFP-Te) for a disallowance of $645; and (7) F3PPWET303 (SP02008WinterWestnRegionRFP-IM)\nfor a disallowance of $4,200. 723\n\n           1. Project F3PCWE0140 (EMO Regulatory Affairs)\n\n           Dr. Szerszen testified that Texas ratepayers do not receive benefits as a result of the costs\ncaptured by this project code and should therefore not be charged those costs. 724\n\n           ETI witness Cicio explained that Dr. Szerszen misinterpreted an RFI response to conclude\nthat Texas ratepayers did not receive benefits from the activities whose costs were booked through\nthis project code. That project code is not intended to capture costs for docketed or large System\nPlanning and Operations projects. Mr. Cicio states that it is not possible to assign a specific project\ncode for every discrete activity performed by each employee, nor would it be appropriate to attempt\nto do so. Regardless of the number of activities specifically identified through project codes, there\nwill remain the need to have generic project codes that capture time spent on more general,\nundocketed matters and activities that are no less beneficial to ratepayers. 725\n\n           The AU s agree that Texas ratepayers receive benefits as a result of the costs charged to this\naccount.

These routinely encompass a multi-year time frame, and the\ncosts required to perform those activities, although associated with a project that may have been\ninitiated several years previously, are properly incurred over the life span of the project. He also\nstates that they are recurring because they reflect the kinds and levels of charges that would be\nexpected to be incurred on an ongoing basis in association with requests for proposals managed by\nESI on behalf of the Entergy Operating Companies, and the Company has been involved in these\ntypes of solicitations since 2002. 727\n\n\n          The AlJs find that the costs captured by these projects were incurred during the Test Year\nand represent the kinds and levels of costs routinely incurred on a recurring basis. Accordingly, the\nAU s recommend that the Commission approve their inclusion as requested by ETI.\n\n\n          3. Project F3PCCSPSYS (System Planning and Strategic)\n\n          Dr. Szerszen recommended total disallowance of the costs captured by this project code\nbecause they are allocated based on the total assets of the Entergy affiliates. 728 Dr. Szerszen' s\nconclusion appears to be that no such corporate-level costs should be allocated to ETI because there\nare other project codes that allocate corporate planning and analysis-type costs only to the regulated\nutilities, such as ETI; thus, any corporate-level costs that are allocated to all subsidiaries, whether\nregulated or non-regulated, should not be charged to ETI.\n\n\n\n\n727\n      ETI Ex. 45 (Cicio Rebuttal) at 13-14.\n728\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 60-61.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE209\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n            ETI witness Tumminello testified that Dr. Szerszen's theory neither considers the Entergy\norganization as a family of companies and ETI' s place in that family, nor the fact that these services\nare not only relevant to ETI as part of the Entergy family, but are reasonable, necessary and meet the\nCommission's affiliate cost recovery standard. ESI's corporate oversight services are provided to\nboth individual companies and groups of companies within the Entergy 'corporate structure. As a\nmember of the corporate group, ETI receives the benefit of corporate-level planning, reporting, and\nforecasting activities provided by ESI. 729\n\n\n            The ALls find that ETI (and, therefore, its ratepayers) does receive benefits as a member of\nthe Entergy family of companies and that it is appropriate for it to receive charges for those services.\nTherefore, the AUs recommend the Commission approve the inclusion of costs as requested by ETI.\n\n\nF.          Environmental Service Class\n\n            Dr. Szerszen recommended disallowance of $301,879 in six project codes primarily within\nETI's Environmental Services Class: (1) F3PCCE0129 (Corporate Sustainability Strat) for a\ndisallowance of $6,781; (2) F3PCCE0193 (Corp Environmental Special Pro) for a disallowance of\n$1,203; (3) F3PCCEIE01 (Corp Environmental Initiatives) for a disallowance of $2,413;\n(4) F3PCCEll01 (Corp Environmental Initiatives) for a disallowance of $2,413; (5) F3PCCEP001\n(Corporate Environmental Policy) for a disallowance of $269,248; and (6) F5PPBCNAVF (Avian\nFlu Contingency Planning) for a disallowance of $47. 730\n\n\n            Dr. Szerszen' s reasoning for this disallowance was that these six project codes, which all deal\nwith corporate environmental policy, initiatives, strategy, and consulting services, were allocated\nbased on Billing Method CAPAOPCO, which is based on the fossil plant capacity of the regulated\nutility operating companies, even though \"non-regulated entities clearly benefit from the corporate\nlevel expenses.\"731 Dr. Szerszen recommended a $47 disallowance for Project F5PPCCNAVF\n\n\n729\n      ETI Ex. 69 (Tumminello Rebuttal) at l 0-11.\n730\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 62-63.\n131   Id.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                             PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                   PAGE210\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n(Avian Flu Contingency Planning), asserting that this charge is a \"corporate imaging expense that\nshould not be borne by Texas ratepayers.\"732\n\n\n           According to ETI, Dr. Szerszen has a fundamental misunderstanding of how the affiliate\nbilling system works and, as a result, she incorrectly assumed that ESI charges are not being properly\nallocated. ETI argues that the non-regulated Entergy affiliates do receive the proper and appropriate\nallocation of costs. The two service companies for non-regulated affiliates also provide services to\ntheir non-regulated affiliates directly. There simply is no subsidization or improper allocation. 733\n\n\n           Dr. Szerszen noted that Entergy' s website indicates that nuclear-related environmental issues\nare being pursued. 734 She argued that this shows that the non-regulated affiliates are under-allocated\nenvironmental-related costs. Ms. Stokes explained that the project codes at issue \"deal with services\nprovided to the operating companies .... and just looking at the website there are other things ...\nthat are not covered or paid for by Texas ratepayers in these project codes that are in this\n                   735\ntestimony.\"              Therefore, according to Ms. Stokes, these project codes are not allocated in such a\nway that under-recovers costs from the non-regulated affiliates; they pay their own way.\n\n\n           Finally, the Project Summary for the Avian Flu Contingency Planning project shows that\nthese costs involve developing and communicating Avian Flu business continuity plans and then\nmaintaining, checking, and adjusting those plans once established. 736 These are not \"corporate\nimaging expenses\" as characterized by Dr. Szerszen.\n\n\n\n\n732\n      Id. at 66.\n733\n     See, e.g., ETI Ex. 41 (Tumminello Direct) at 10-15. Moreover, while ESI bills the regulated utility\naffiliates such as ETI at cost, it bills the non-regulated affiliates at cost plus a 5 percent mark-up pursuant to a\nJune 1999 Securities and Exchange Commission order. ETI Ex. 41 (Tumminello Direct) at 15. This 5 percent\nmark-up is then flowed back to entities that receive service from ESL Therefore, the regulated affiliates are,\nby federal order, receiving essentially a rebate from the non-regulated affiliates.\n734\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 62.\n735\n      Tr. at 884.\n736\n      ETI Ex. 41 (Tumminello Direct) at SBT-E at 1342-43.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE211\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          The AU s agree that ETI' s evidence demonstrates the recoverability of the costs captured by\nthese project codes. Therefore, the ALJs recommend the Commission approve their recovery.\n\n\nG.        Federal PRG Affairs Class\n\n          Dr. Szerszen recommended disallowances for three project codes primarily in the Federal\nPRG Affairs Class: (1) F5PPSPE044 (PMO Support Initiative-System) for a disallowance of $344;\n(2) F3PPUTLDER (Utility Derivatives Compliance) for a disallowance of $20,447; and\n(3) F3PCSYSRAF (System Regulatory Affairs-Federal) for a disallowance of $352,084.737\n\n\n          1. Project FSPPSPE044 (PMO Support Initiative-System)\n\n          Dr. Szerszen recommended disallowance of $344.29 from Project F5PPSPE044 (PMO\nSupport Initiative System). ETI responds, however, that a review of the Project Summary for that\nproject code in Ex. SBT-E reveals that ETI already removed those costs before even filing its direct\ncase. Therefore, according to ETI, Dr. Szerszen is recommending disallowance of a cost that is not\nin this case.738\n\n\n          The AU s agree that examination of the exhibit referenced by ETI appears to reveal that the\ncosts challenged by Dr. Szerszen have been removed from this case through a pro Jonna adjustment.\nAccordingly, the ALJs recommend the Commission reject OPC's challenge.\n\n\n          2. Project F3PPUTLDER (Utility Derivatives Compliance)\n\n          Dr. Szerszen recommended disallowance of $20,447 of derivatives expenses because ETI did\nnot use derivative instruments and therefore should not be charged these costs and because\nratepayers do not benefit from derivatives. 739\n\n\n\n\n737\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 46-47, 66-67.\n738\n      ETI Initial Brief at 174-175.\n739\n   ETI stated that it assumes that Dr. Szerszen must be referring to Project Code F3PPUTLDER (Utility\nDerivatives Compliance) because her recommended disallowance is the same total ETI adjusted amount shown\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE212\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          ETI witness Tumminello responded that Project F3PPUTLDER was charged by a group\ndeveloping compliance mechanisms to protect Entergy' s regulated utility interests in observance of\nthe Dodd-Frank Act. Although ETI does not currently use any derivative activities, understanding\nthe impacts of that Act is necessary to ensure current and future compliance through Entergy. The\ndefinitions under the legislation have not been finalized, and there remain issues that ETI must be\naware of to fully comply. These costs, therefore, are necessary and reasonable charges that should\nnot be disallowed. 740\n\n\n           The explanation offered by ETI for the inclusion of these charges appears reasonable to the\nAU s. Even though ETI does not now use derivatives, it is possible that it will in the future and it is\nimportant that it be aware of the regulatory framework associated with such actions to avoid\nproblems. The AU s therefore recommend the Commission approve inclusion of these costs as\nrequested by ETL\n\n\n           3. Project F3PCSYSRAF (System Regulatory Affairs-Federal)\n\n           In the regulatory affairs category, ETI requests the recovery of various legal,\ntestimony-related, communications, and filing costs associated with both Texas-specific regulatory\nactivities, FERC-related regulatory activities, and non-Texas specific regulatory activities. OPC\nwitness Szerszen did not recommend a disallowance of the $1,442,223 in adjusted Test Year\nexpenses for regulatory affairs that ETI has shown to be specific to the Texas jurisdiction. 141 Rather,\nDr. Szerszen recommended that all regulatory affairs expenses not specific to Texas be\ndisallowed.7 4 2 These expenses total $759,868.743\n\n\n\n\non the Project Summary for that project code. See SBT-E at 1113. The ALJ s make the same assumption as it\nappears reasonable.\n740\n      ETI Ex. 69 (Tuminello Rebuttal) at Ex.

According to OPC, this is not reality, nor is it consistent with FERC's primary\nresponsibility to ensure that electric wholesale buyers and sellers are provided open access\ntransmission across utility systems.\n\n\n          ETI witness May offered the following as rebuttal of Dr. Szerszen's contentions regarding\nthese two project codes:\n\n\n          The affiliate charges to Project Codes F3PCSYSRAS and F3PCSYSRAF are directly\n          associated with the issues and matters within the federal jurisdiction of the Federal\n          Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\") including but not limited to the Open\n          Access Transmission Tariff (\"OATT\") as well as any other federal statutes, rules and\n\n744\n      OPC Ex. 3 (Szerszen Workpapers) at 365.\n745\n      OPC Ex. l (Szerszen Direct) at 46-47; OPC Ex. 3 (Szerszen Workpapers) at 367.\n746\n      OPC Ex. 3 (Szerszen Workpapers) at 368-371.\n747\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 47.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                              PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                 PAGE214\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          regulations. These are the result of issues and matters raised concerning the OATT,\n          operations of the transmission system, requests for transmission service and\n          interpretation of applicable provisions under the jurisdiction of FERC. They are\n          costs incurred on an Entergy System-wide basis that cannot be directly assigned to\n          any one Operating Company, such as ETI.748\n\nHe then went on to state that the affiliate Test Year issues and costs related to these project codes are\n                                                                                                   749\nreflective of typical issues and costs that the Company experiences on an ongoing basis.                 With\nrespect to the benefits derived by Texas ratepayers as a result of activities conducted under these\nproject codes, Mr. May stated that:\n\n\n          the benefit to ETI involves a multitude of issues that are directly related to the\n          jurisdiction of the FERC, including but not limited to any revisions to Service\n          Schedules under the System Agreement that applies to all operating companies\n          including ETI, power purchase agreements for cost-based, short-term power sales,\n          and compliance with FERC by each Operating Company to the market-based rate\n          tariff and cost-based rate tariff. The Entergy Operating Companies' market-based\n          rate tariff and cost-based rate tariff are joint tariffs containing terms and conditions of\n          service. 750\n\nMr. May also explained why the billing methods applied to these two project codes are appropriate.\nThe cost drivers for Project F3PCSYSRAF are labor, employee expenses, consultant expenses, and\nother general operating expenses incurred for the benefit of the Entergy Operating Companies and\ntheir regulated customers. Therefore, a billing method based on load responsibility \"LOADOPCO\"\n  is appropriate for this type of project code. Project F3PCSYSRAS captures costs associated with\ngeneral regulatory support work that is applicable across all of the jurisdictions. The primary\nactivities associated in this project code include but are not limited to: special project work\nassociated with system-wide regulatory matters, analysis of emerging state or national regulatory and\naccounting issues affecting the Entergy System, and internal process improvement work. What\ndrives the cost of this project code is the average number of both electric and gas customers served-\n\n\n\n\n748\n      ETI Ex. 57 (May Rebuttal) at 25.\n749\n      ETI Ex. 57 (May Rebuttal) at 25.\n750\n      ETI Ex. 57 (May Rebuttal) at 27-28; see also, Tr. at 370-371.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                          PAGE215\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nCUSTEGOP because all such customers benefit from these services provided by ESI to ETI.751 In\nshort, according to ETI, the activities undertaken under both of these project codes benefit Texas\nratepayers, and they are properly allocated to the regulated operating companies using the billing\nmethods employed.\n\n\n          The AU s believe that resolution of this question is a close call. Although ETI provided an\nadequate explanation of the reasons underlying the allocation of costs to Texas ratepayers and the\nappropriateness of the allocation methodologies used, the one troubling aspect, as noted by OPC,\nwas that Mr. May's testimony regarding Projects F3PCSYSRAF and FP3PCSYSRAS contradicted\nthe fact that ESI has a specific project dedicated to open access transmission issues entitled \"FERC-\nOpen Access Transmission\" (Project F3PCE01601). 752 As OPC notes, if Mr. May was correct that\nOATT issues have been included in Projects F3PCSYSRAF and FP3PCSYSRAS the project pages\nshould arguably be more specific about the purpose of the expenditure. Nevertheless, the AU s find\nETI' s testimony credible and recommend that the costs of Projects F3PCSYSRAF and\nFP3PCSYSRAS not be disregarded.\n\n\nH.        Financial Services Class\n\n          Dr. Szerszen recommended disallowances in nine project codes that are primarily captured\nwithin ETI's Financial Services Class of affiliate costs: (1) F3PCF05700 (Corporate Planning &\nAnalysis) for a disallowance of $4,254; (2) F3PCF21600 (Corp Rptg Analysis & Policy) for a\ndisallowance of $320,157; (3) F3PCFF1000 (Financial Forecasting) for a disallowance of $96,734;\n(4) F3PPADSENT (Analytic/Decision Support-Entergy) for a disallowance of $93,544;\n(5) F3PPSPSENT         (Strategic   Planning Svcs-Entergy) for         a disallowance of $45,265;\n(6) F3PCR73345 (Quick Payment Center, Adm) for a disallowance of $14,484; (7) F3PCF20990\n\n\n\n\n751\n      ETI Ex. 57 (May Rebuttal) at 28-29.\n752\n      OPC Ex. l l; also found in OPC Exhibit No. 3 (Szerszen Workpapers )at 363-364.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                       PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE216\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n(Operations Exec VP & CFO) for a disallowance of $146,267; (8) F3PCFF1001 (OCE Support) for\na disallowance of $1,923; and (9) F3PCF23936 (Manage Cash) for a disallowance of $15,677.753\n\n\n          1.

The services provided under\nthese project codes are not only relevant to ETI as part of the Entergy family, but are reasonable and\nnecessary. ESI' s corporate oversight services are provided to both individual companies and groups\nof companies within the Entergy Companies' corporate structure. As a member of the corporate\ngroup, ETI receives the benefit of corporate-level planning, reporting, and forecasting activities\nprovided by ESL Ms. Tumminello contested that the use of an asset-based allocator is appropriate\nbecause this is an example of the stewardship of the company-wide assets and such an allocator is,\ntherefore, appropriate. 754 The AU s agree.\n\n\n          The AUs find that ETI's proposed allocator is appropriate and that the costs benefit Texas\nratepayers. Accordingly, the AUs recommend the Commission approve the costs proposed by ETI.\n\n\n\n\n753\n      OPC Ex.

Projects F3PCF20990 (Operations Exec VP & CFO) and F3PCFF1001 (OCE\n            Support)\n\n         Dr. Szerszen recommended disallowance of all costs captured by these project codes because,\nin her opinion: (1) there are \"no perceivable benefits to ETI's ratepayers\"; (2) they should be paid\nfor by the parent entity (presumably meaning Entergy's shareholders); and (3) an asset.s-based\nallocator is not appropriate. 755\n\n\n         As to Dr. Szerszen' s assertion that Texas ratepayers do not benefit from the costs captured by\nthese project codes, ETI witness Domino, President of Entergy, provided anecdotal evidence that that\nEntergy was vital to ETI' s restoration efforts on two fronts. First, the parent provided cash to ETI for\nits hurricane restoration efforts; second, ETI was not required to pay dividends to the parent while it\nwas strapped for funds due to hurricane restoration efforts. 756 With respect to the argument that an\nasset-based allocator is not appropriate, Ms. Tumminello testified that the functions covered by this\nproject code relate to the oversight of all system operations and the stewardship of corporate assets\nand that because ETI is part of a corporate group, the allocated charges associated with these services\nare relevant to ETI as part of that group. Furthermore, ETI argues, the asset-based allocator is\nappropriate because it reflects the cause of the costs incurred, in that services provided relate to the\nstewardship of all the corporation's assets. 757\n\n\n         Dr. Szerszen took too narrow a view and, without justification, argued that these costs\nprovide no benefit to Texas ratepayers. There are innumerable benefits provided by the corporate\nstructure adopted; those mentioned by Mr. Domino are just a few. Ms. Tumminello's testimony\nexplained why an asset-based allocator is appropriate. Accordingly, the AUs recommend the\nCommission approve the inclusion of these costs as requested by ETI.\n\n\n\n\n755\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 56-57.\n756\n      Tr. at 141.\n757\n      ETI Ex. 69 (Tumminello Rebuttal) at 9-11.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE218\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          3. Project F3PCR73345 (Quick Payment Center, Adm)\n\n          Dr. Szerszen recommended that these costs be reallocated using the CUSTCALL billing\nmethod. Given ESI's demonstrated tracking capabilities, Dr. Szerszen reallocated the costs of this\nproject using a 10.8 percent customer call allocator, which is on the low end of the\n10.70 percent-11.04 percent Test-Year CUSTCALL allocators. 758 As a result of Dr. Szerszen's\nreallocation, $14,484 associated with this project should, according to Dr. Szerszen, be\ndisallowed.759\n\n\n          ETI witness Stokes responded, stating that Dr. Szerszen's proposed reallocation is arbitrary\nand fails to consider the cost causation associated with the actual project code at issue. These costs\nare not driven by a specific proportion of calls from each Operating Company (that is, by the\nCUSTCALL allocator). The costs captured by Project F3PCR73345 reflect the costs of overseeing\nthe Quick Payment Center vendors in each of the Entergy Operating Companies, regardless of the\nnumber of calls by customers to the Company. 760\n\n\n          The AI.Js are persuaded that the allocation methodology chosen by ETI is the superior\nmethod and that the CUSTCALL allocator would not be appropriate given the cost causation\nassociated with the project. Accordingly, the AI.Js recommend the Commission approve the costs\nproposed by ETI.\n\n\n          4. Project F3PCF23936 (Manage Cash)\n\n          Dr. Szerszen recommended disallowance of $15,677 from Project F3PCF23936 (Manage\nCash), arguing that this project: (1) is duplicative of ETl-specific financing and cash management\n\n\n\n\n758\n      OPC Exhibit No. 27 (ETI' s Ex. SBT-15, Attachment 6) at 2; Tr. at 838-839.\n759\n      OPC Exhibit No. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 77 and 118.\n760\n      ETI Ex. 66 (Stokes Rebuttal) at 11.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE219\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nactivates; (2) the allocator is wrong; and (3) Entergy, not ETI ratepayers, should pay for this\nactivity. 761\n\n\n          ETI witness McNeal testified that the services are not duplicative of the cash management\nservices performed by the Cash Management department in the Treasury Class. The services\nprovided under Project F3PCF23936 are associated with daily cash management responsibilities,\nsuch as loading bank balances, setting daily cash position for all the Entergy Companies, transmitting\nwire/ACH files to Entergy Company banks for vendor payments, and maintaining proper cash\ncontrols over these cash functions. These services are necessary for the daily operation of all the\nEntergy Companies, including ETI, and are thus not directly associated with any one specific legal\nentity. The costs are driven by the time spent on the daily cash management activities, which is\ndirectly related to the number of bank accounts that the Entergy Companies have open. Since the\nservices provided under this project code cannot be identified to a particular Entergy Company, the\nbilling method based on the number of open bank accounts is the best allocation. Billing method\nBNKACCTA does that and, according to Mr. McNeal, is therefore appropriate for allocating costs\nfor this project code. 762\n\n\n          The evidence demonstrates that the activities captured by this project code are not directly\nassociated with any one specific entity; rather, they benefit all the entities under the Entergy\numbrella. It also appears that a billing method based on the number of open bank accounts is the\nappropriate allocation methodology. Accordingly, the ALls recommend the Commission approve\ninclusion of costs as requested by ETI.\n\n\nI.        Human Resources Class\n\n          Dr. Szerszen recommended dis allowances for three project codes that are primarily within the\nHuman Resources Class of affiliate costs: (1) F3PCHRCCSM (HR Competitive Compensation) for\na disallowance of $20,146; (2) FSPCZUBENQ (Non-Qualified Post-Retirement) for a disallowance\n\n\n761\n      OPC Ex. l (Szerszen Direct) at 74 and Schedule CAS-15.\n762\n      ETI Ex. 61 (McNeal Rebuttal) at 4, 6; Tr. at 546-547.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                          PAGE220\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nof $115,078; and (3) F5PPZNQBDU (Non-Qual Pension/Benf-Dom Utl) for a disallowance of\n$241,073. 763\n\n\n          1. Project F3PCHRCCSM (HR Competitive Compensation)\n\n          Dr. Szerszen testified that an asset-based allocator is not appropriate for a project, such as\nProject F3PCHRCCSM, that captures overall executive management-related costs.764\n\n\n          ETI contends that the functions covered by this project code relate to the oversight of all\nsystem operations and the stewardship of corporate assets and that because ETI is part of a corporate\ngroup, the allocated charges associated with these services are relevant to ETI as part of that group of\ncompanies. Furthermore, ETI argues, the asset-based allocator is appropriate because it reflects the\ncause of the costs incurred, in that services provided relate to the stewardship of all the corporation's\nassets. 765\n\n\n          A corporation cannot function without executives, who are charged with the responsibility of\noverseeing, among other things, the assets of the corporation. This is an important function that\nDr. Szerszen did not acknowledge in her testimony. The utility and executive management class\ncosts that she challenged are reasonable and necessary costs that are allocated to ETI based on a\nlogical allocator - the assets the executives are charged with overseeing. The AU s recommend that\nOPC' s challenge be rejected.\n\n\n          2. Projects FSPCZUBENQ (Non-Qualified Post-Retirement) and FSPPZNQBDU\n             (Non-Qual Pension/Benf-Dom Utl)\n\n          With respect to Projects F5PCZUBENQ and F5PPZNQBDU, Dr. Szerszen testified that:\n(1) there is no evidence that Texas ratepayers benefit from the pension-related benefits in these\n\n\n\n\n763\n      OPC Ex.

The AUs, however, have already\nresolved this issue in their discussions related to Section VII.D.4, above, where they concluded that\nthat the supplemental executive retirement plans are not reasonable and necessary for the provision\nof electric utility service and are not in the public interest. Accordingly, the Al.Js recommend the\nCommission accept OPC' s proposed disallowance of $356, 151 (which includes the $112,531 agreed\nto by ETI).\n\n\nJ.        Information Technology Class\n\n          Dr. Szerszen recommended disallowances in two project codes that are primarily within\nETI's Information Technology Class: (1) F3PPFXERSP (Evaluated Receipts Settlement) for a\ndisallowance of $10,279; and (2) F3PCFX3555 (BOD/Executive Support) for a disallowance of\n$3,148. 768\n\n\n          1. F3PPFXERSP (Evaluated Receipts Settlement)\n\n          Dr. Szerszen testified that Project F3PPFXERSP is not moving forward due to tax and freight\nimplications and, as such, the cost is not recurring. 769 Ms. Tumminello testified in response that the\n\"Evaluated Receipt Settlement\" program was originally being capitalized in a capital project. But\nwhen it was decided that the program would be cancelled, the capital project was closed and the\ncharges to the project were expensed. Although the costs for this particular project do not recur\n\n\n766\n      OPC Ex. l (Szerszen Direct) at 68.\n767\n      ETIInitial Brief at 179.\n768\n      OPC Ex. l (Szerszen Direct) at 56, 71.\n769\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 71.\n\fSOAHDOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE222\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nevery year, they are part of normal utility operations, and this type of project does recur as\nnecessary.770\n\n\n          Although the AU s understand the concept of normally recurring cost types, they do not\nbelieve that the costs captured by this project code fall within that category. Those costs related to a\nproject that was cancelled and sufficient explanation of how similar projects in the future might\noccur was not provided. Accordingly, the ALls recommend the Commission reject inclusion, as\nproposed by OPC.\n\n\n          2. Project F3PCFX3555 (BOD/Executive Support)\n\n          Dr. Szerszen argued that Project F3PCFX3555 is an executive-related project that does not\nprovide perceivable benefits to ETI ratepayers, the Entergy shareholders should bear this cost, and an\nassets-based allocator is not appropriate. 771\n\n\n          ETI argues that the functions covered by this project code relate to the oversight of all system\noperations and the stewardship of corporate assets and that because ETI is part of a corporate group,\nthe allocated charges associated with these services are relevant to ETI as part of that group of\ncompanies. Furthermore, ETI argues, the asset-based allocator is appropriate because it reflects the\ncause of the costs incurred, in that services provided relate to the stewardship of all the corporation's\nassets. 772\n\n\n          A corporation cannot function without executives who are charged with the responsibility of\noverseeing, among other things, the assets of the corporation. This is an important function that\nDr. Szerszen did not acknowledge in her arguments. The utility and executive management class\ncosts that she challenged are reasonable and necessary costs that are allocated to ETI based on a\nlogical allocator- the assets the executives are charged with overseeing. The AU s recommend that\nOPC's challenge be rejected.\n\n\n\n770\n      ETI Ex. 69 (Tumminello Rebuttal) at SBT-R-2 at 4.\n771\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 56.\n\fSOAHDOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE223\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nK.        Internal and External Communications Class\n\n          Dr. Szerszen recommended disallowances in four project codes that are primarily within\nETI' s Internal and External Communications Class: ( 1) F3PCR40118 (Utility Communications for a\n$6 disallowance; (2) FSPCZPDEPT (Supervision and Support- Public) for a $138 disallowance;\n(3) FSPPICCOOO (Integrated Customer Communications) for a $199 disallowance; and\n(4) FSPPICCEMP (ICC - Employee Education Initiative) for a $3 disallowance.773\n\n\n          ETI witness Tumminello responded to Dr. Szerszen's claim that the costs captured by these\nproject codes are corporate image costs by stating that the costs are for advertising activities that are\nof a good will or institutional nature, which is primarily designed to improve the image of the utility\nor the industry, including advertisement which inform the public concerning matters affecting the\nCompany's operations, such as, the costs of providing service, the Company's efforts to improve the\nquality of service, the Company's efforts to improve and protect the environment. According to\nFERC, such costs are properly includable inFERCAccount 930.1 and are recoverable. According to\nMs. Tumminello, as contemplated by FERC, the fact that ETI is a monopoly has no bearing on the\nrecoverability of these costs. 774\n\n\n          OPC provided little support for its claim that costs covered by these project codes should not\nbe recoverable, essentially limiting the basis to the contention that ETI is a monopoly and ratepayers\nshould not be charged with such costs. ETI did little better, but it did provide the testimony of\nMs. Tumminello, which confirms that the costs are properly includable in FERC Account 930.1 and\nare, therefore, recoverable. In the end, the AUs must go with the weight of the evidence, which is in\nETI's favor. The AUs recommend the Commission reject OPC's contention that costs covered by\nthese project codes are not recoverable.\n\n\n\n\n772\n      ETI Ex. 4 (Domino Direct) at 18-38; ETI Ex. 69 (Tumminello Rebuttal) at 9-11.\n773\n      OPC Ex. l (Szerszen Direct) at 66.\n714\n      ETI Ex. 69 (Tumminello Rebuttal) at SBT-R-2 at 4-6.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                   PAGE224\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nL.      Legal Services Class\n\n        Dr. Szerszen recommended disallowances in 13 project codes that are primarily within the\nLegal Services Class: (1) F3PPCASHCT (Contractual Altemative/Cashpo) for a disallowance of\n$2,553; (2) F3PCF99180 (CORP. COMPLIANCE TRACKING SYS) for a disallowance of $9;\n(3) F3PPINVDOJ (DOJ Anti Trust Investigation) for a disallowance of $1,039,664; 775\n(4) F3PCE01601 (Ferc - Open Access Transmission) for a disallowance of $84,183;\n(5) F3PCERAKTL (RAKTL Patent Matter) for a disallowance of $75; (6) F3PPEASTIN\n(Willard Eastin et al) for a disallowance of $19,714; (7) F3PPTCGS11 (TX Docket Competitive\nGeneration) for a disallowance of $310,746; (8) F5PCE13759 (Jenkins Class Action Suit) for a\ndisallowance of $205,l 07; (9) F5PCZLDEPT (Supervision & Support- Legal) for a disallowance of\n$225,794; (10) F3PCCDVDAT (CorporateDevelopmentDataRoom)foradisallowanceof $6,147;\n(11) F3PCSYSAGR (SystemAgreement-200l)for a disallowanceof$880,841; (12) F3PPWET302\n(SPO 2008 Winter Western Region) for a disallowance of $13,919; and (13) F3PPWET308 (SPO\nCalpine PPA/Project Houston) for a disallowance of $435,963.\n\n\n        1. Project F3PPCASHCT (Contractual Altemative/Cashpo)\n\n        With respect to Project F3PPCASHCT ($2,553 disallowance), ETI agrees that these costs are\nnon-recurring and should be disallowed. Accordingly, the AUs recommend the Commission\nexclude those costs.\n\n\n        2. Project FSPCZLDEPT (Supervision & Support - Legal)\n\n        As to Project F5PCZLDEPT ($225,794), OPC, through its Second Errata, removed that\nproposed disallowance, and it is no longer contested by Dr. Szerszen. Accordingly, the AUs\nrecommend the Commission approve inclusion of those costs.\n\n\n\n\n775\n    Dr. Szerszen also proposed disallowance of $765 in charges for related Project Code F3PPTDHY 19 (Dept.\nof Justice Investigation), which is actually primarily attributable to the Transmission Operations Class, rather\nthan the Legal Services Class. Because the issues are intertwined, that project will be discussed here, rather\nthan in the Transmission Operations Class.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE225\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          3. Project F3PCF99180 (Corp. Compliance Tracking Sys)\n\n          F3PCF99180 (Corp. Compliance Tracking Sys) is one of the project codes that Dr. Szerszen\nclaimed should be disallowed because ETI is a monopoly and Texas ratepayers should not have to\npay for corporate image costs. 776\n\n\n          ETI witness Tumminello testified that these costs are for advertising activities that are of a\ngood will or institutional nature, which is primarily designed to improve the image of the utility or\nthe industry, including advertisement which inform the public concerning matters affecting the\nCompany's operations, such as, the costs of providing service, the Company's efforts to improve the\nquality of service, the Company's efforts to improve and protect the environment. According to\nFERC, such costs are properly includable in FERC Account 930.1 and are recoverable. According to\nMs. Tumminello, as contemplated by FERC, the fact that ETI is a monopoly has no bearing on the\nrecoverability of these costs. 777\n\n\n          OPC provided little support for its claim that costs covered by these project codes should not\nbe recoverable, essentially limiting the basis to the contention that ETI is a monopoly and ratepayers\nshould not be charged with such costs. ETI did little better, but it did provide the testimony of\nMs. Tumminello, which confirms that the costs are properly includable in FERC Account 930.1 and\nare, therefore, recoverable. The weight of the evidence is in ETI' s favor. The ALls recommend the\nCommission reject OPC' s contention that costs covered by these project codes are not recoverable.\n\n\n          4. Projects F3PPINVDOJ (DOJ Anti Trust Investigation) and F3PPTDHY19 (Dept. of\n             Justice Investigation)\n\n          Entergy is currently under investigation by the Department of Justice (DOJ) for certain\nbusiness practices of the Operating Companies, including the procurement of generating assets and\npower, dispatch of generation within the Entergy system, and transmission capacity expansion. This\nis a civil investigation under Section 2 of the Sherman Act and Section 7 of the Clayton Act. The\n\n\n776\n      OPC Ex. I (Szerszen Direct) at 66.\n777\n      ETI Ex. 69 (Tumminello Rebuttal) at SBT-R-2 at 4-6.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                        PAGE226\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ninvestigation has been ongoing since 2010, and Entergy does not know when the investigation will\nconclude. 778\n\n\n          Dr. Szerszen testified that there are two reasons why ratepayers should not pay for the DOJ\nexpenses. First, ETI does not have the ability to make its own power procurement, generation\ndispatch, or transmission capacity decisions. These decisions are made by ESI and Entergy' s\ncorporate management, which has traditionally planned and managed the electric operating\ncompanies' generation and transmission functions on a system-wide basis. Second, ETI is not\nresponsible for the development and administration of the system agreement, and should not be held\nresponsible for these antitrust investigation expenses. Furthermore, according to Dr. Szerszen, if the\nDOJ finds that Entergy has acted illegally, it is even more inappropriate to charge ETI ratepayers for\ncorporate-level illegal actions. These expenses should be borne by Entergy's corporate parent and/or\nthe corporation's shareholders, and not the ratepayers. 779\n\n\n           ETI contends that Dr. Szerszen fundamentally misunderstands the nature of the System\nAgreement and the benefits that ETI derives from that agreement. All of the Entergy Operating\nCompanies voluntarily entered into the System Agreement so that the Entergy system can be planned\nand operated on a total system basis, in order to maximize economic benefit and reliability of\nservice. All of the Operating Companies benefit from integrated planning and operations in this\nmanner. This does not mean that ETI has no decision-making role in these activities. ETI notes that\nunder Section 5.01 of the System Agreement, the agreement is administered through an Operating\nCommittee, which includes an ETI representative, as well as representatives of the other Operating\nCompanies and Entergy. ETI' s representative is one of the voting members of the Committee, and\nall decisions of the Operating Committee must be approved by a majority vote. As a voting member\nof the Operating Committee, ETI is responsible for administering the System Agreement and does\nparticipate in decision-making on generation and transmission matters. 780\n\n\n\n778\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 51-52.\n779\n      Id. at 52.\n780\n      ETI Ex. 65 (Sloan Rebuttal) at 8.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE227\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n            ETI acknowledges that ESI is tasked with providing services and making decisions related to\ngeneration dispatch, power procurement, and transmission operations on behalf of the Entergy\nOperating Companies and at the direction of the Operating Committee, but these activities are for the\nbenefit of the Operating Companies and their ratepayers. ETI receives the benefits of these services\nand integrated planning and operations under the System Agreement and, according to ETI, should\nalso be responsible for its portion of costs related to those services and operations. 781\n\n\n            As to Dr. Szerszen' s contention that the costs should be disallowed because DOJ might find\nthat Entergy acted illegally, ETI notes that the DOJ is not an adjudicatory body or regulatory agency\nand, thus, it does not make \"findings of fact.\" If DOJ believes the civil antitrust laws have been\nviolated, it can file a complaint in federal district court. To date, no complaint has been filed. ETI\npoints out that ESI routinely incurs legal costs in responding to regulatory audits and investigations\non behalf of ETI and the other Operating Companies in the same manner in which other operating\ncosts are incurred. ESI is authorized to retain legal counsel on behalf of, and for the benefit of, ETI\nand the other Entergy Operating Companies. ESI is authorized to allocate the respective costs to the\nOperating Companies under a service agreement with the Entergy Operating Companies designated\nas Rate Schedule FERC No. 435. This service agreement is on file with, and was approved by,\nFERC under FER C Docket No. ER07-38-000. 782 Thus, according to ETI, it is appropriate that ETI is\nallocated its share of the costs of legal services related to the DOJ investigation. 783\n\n\n            The DOJ antitrust investigation is a massive undertaking. Unfortunately, it is a part of the\nordinary course of modem business life. OPC's arguments that ESI is solely responsible for\ndecision-making under the System Agreement miss the mark, as pointed out by ETI. It is clear that\nETI and the other Operating Companies play an active role in the decision-making. As to OPC's\narguments about what would happen if Entergy were found to have violated the antitrust laws, those\narguments are little more than speculation. As ETI noted, the DOJ is not an adjudicatory body and\nits investigation can only result in the filing of a complaint in Federal court (if the DOJ believes that\n\n1s1   Id.\n782\n      Entergy Serv.

Until that time, it is imperative for the company to fully respond to the\nDOJ investigation. The Al.Js find that ETI has met its burden of proving that Texas ratepayers\nshould be charged the costs of the DOJ investigation allocated to them by ETI.\n\n\n          S. Project F3PCE01601 (Ferc - Open Access Transmission)\n\n          Project F3PCEO 1601 costs are incurred to manage costs associated with regulatory oversight\nand coordination of the Entergy System Open Access Transmission Service before FERC. OPC\ncontends that not only are most of the FERC dockets accruing costs under Project F3PPEO 1601 no\nlonger open as of December 31, 2011, 784 most of the closed dockets have absolutely nothing to do\nwith Texas operations.785 Furthermore, according to OPC, ETI witness Sloan agreed that only three\nof the dockets shown in OPC Exhibit No. 12 were open at the end of the test year, and one of the\nopen dockets involves a transmission service agreement involving the Missouri Joint Municipal\nElectric Utility Commission and various cities in Missouri and Arkansas.786\n\n\n          ETI responds that the activities in this project relate to oversight and coordination of the\nOATT proceedings before the FERC. Costs billed to this project code are related to ESI's\nrepresentation of the Operating Companies, including ETI, before the FERC on OATT issues.\nRevenues derived from provision of service under the OATT are credited to all of the Operating\nCompanies on a load responsibility ratio basis. ETI' s retail share of these revenues was $168,366\nduring the test period, demonstrating the benefits derived by Texas ratepayers as a result of the\nactivities undertaken through this project code. 787\n\n\n          Activities relating to a company's OATT are not one-time activities; they will continue from\nyear to year. OPC's contention that because most of the dockets listed as having taken place during\nthe Test Year were completed by the end of the Test Year they should be disregarded is not\n\n\n784\n      OPC Ex. 12 (OPC RPI No. 7-3); OPC Ex. 3 (Szerszen Workpapers) at 363.\n785\n      OPC Ex. 12 (OPC RFI No. 7-3); OPC Ex. l (Szerszen Direct) at 54.\n786\n      Tr. at 280.\n787\n      ETI Ex. 65 (Sloan Rebuttal) at 10.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                               PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE229\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nwell-founded. It is clear that the activities covered by this project code not only benefit ETI' s Texas\nratepayers, but will continue (albeit under new docket numbers) into future years. The AUs\nrecommend that costs under this project code be allowed.\n\n\n          6. Project F3PCERAKTL (RAKTL Patent Matter)\n\n          The costs under this project code involve the RAKTL patent, which relates to call center\noperations. RAKTL is a patent infringement claim lodged against several Entergy companies. The\nalleged patents are for voice prompting technology used in call centers. 788\n\n\n          Dr. Szerszen testified that it is not appropriate to charge ETI for the costs associated with this\nlitigation because ETI did not purchase the call center telephone equipment at issue, and therefore\nshould not be required to pay any legal costs associated with patent infringement investigation or\nsettlement costs. ESI is totally responsible for system-wide technology purchases and operations,\nand, according to Dr. Szerszen, it is not reasonable to require the operating companies to pay legal\ncosts associated with ESI technology acquisition or technology application errors.789\n\n\n          ETI contends that ESI incurred the legal expenses on this patent matter on behalf of the\nEntergy Operating Companies, whose residential and small commercial customers call into the call\ncenters to obtain customer service for issues related to connection and disconnection of electric\nservice, billing issues, and other customer transactions. The call centers provide an interface\nbetween ETI customers and the Entergy Operating Companies and, as such, are valuable in providing\nquality service to customers. Consequently, according to ETI, costs related to the call centers,\nincluding the costs of defending lawsuits involving technologies used at those call centers, is a\nreasonable and necessary expense that is appropriately allocated to ETI.790\n\n\n          OPC tends to ignore the purpose and benefits of a centralized service company such as ESL\nIf ETI were to fund stand-alone call centers, it is likely that the costs to Texas ratepayers would be\n\n\n788\n      Id. at 4; OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 49-50.\n789\n      OPC Ex.

Part of the costs that ESI incurs is the cost of patent\nclaims. Those are legitimate costs that should be borne by all who receive service from ESI.\nAccordingly, the ALls recommend the Commission reject OPC's challenge.\n\n\n          7. Project F3PPEASTIN (Willard Eastin et al.)\n\n          This project code, which contains costs in the amount of $19,714, collects costs related to an\nage discrimination law suit filed by Willard Eastin, et al. against Entergy. The defendants to the\nlawsuit were Entergy, ESI, Entergy Louisiana, fuc. (ELL), and Entergy New Orleans, fuc. (ENOI).\nThe plaintiffs to the lawsuit were employees of ESI, ELL, and ENOI.791\n\n\n          OPC witness Szerszen testified that ETI should not be required to pay any of the costs of this\nlitigation. Although ESI provides services to the Operating Companies, this does not imply that the\nOperating Companies should be charged costs associated with the service company's employment\n                                                            792\npractice problems or errors according to Dr. Szerszen.\n\n\n          ETI argues that costs are driven by ESI having the need for legal services to defend itself. As\nshown on the Project Code Summary for this project, since all ESI functions are in service to the\nvarious affiliates and arise as a consequence of providing such services, it is appropriate to relate\nthese legal costs to the total ESI billings to the affiliates. 793\n\n\n          ETI has provided little in the way of explanation regarding these costs or the litigation that\ngenerated them. What is troubling to the AUs is that the only named defendants are Entergy, ESI,\nELL, and ENOI; ETI is not included among the named defendants. If this were simply a cost of\ndoing business for ESI, as claimed by ETI, why were ELL and ENOI named? No explanation was\noffered. It appears to the ALls that although this litigation is related to ESI's operations, it is more\n\n\n\n790\n      ETI Ex. 65 (Sloan Rebuttal) at 4.\n791\n      ETI Ex. 65 (Sloan Rebuttal) at 2; OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 49-50.\n792\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 50.\n793\n      ETI Ex. 65 (Sloan Rebuttal) at 2.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                               PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE231\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nimmediately related to ELL and ENOI. The AUs do not believe that ETI's Texas ratepayers should\nbe charged for these costs; therefore the AUs recommend that $19,714 not be included.\n\n\n          8. Project F3PPTCGS11 {TX Docket Competitive Generation)\n\n          The costs billed through this project code all pertain to ETI' s CGS matter currently pending\nbefore the Commission in Docket No. 38951. 794\n\n\n          OPC witness Szerszen testified that because no decision has been made yet as to the\ndisposition of the expenses associated with the CGS tariff, ETI should not be expensing the costs\nassociated with that docket.         Dr. Szerszen disallowed $310,746 in Test-Year expenses, and\nrecommended that ETI be allowed to defer the expenses until the Commission determines the\nappropriate regulatory treatment. 795\n\n\n          ETI argues that these costs were incurred during the Test Year in a pending Commission\ndocket, and ETI continues to incur costs related to this matter. As such, according to ETI, these costs\nare appropriately included in ETI' s cost of service and should neither be disallowed nor deferred.7 96\n\n\n          OPC's arguments with respect to these costs are not well-founded. It appears to be likening\nthese regulatory costs to rate case expense, which would be subject to Commission review and\napproval in the proceeding to which they relate. But that is not the nature of these expenses. They\nare simply regulatory expenses incurred in the course of ongoing regulatory proceedings. They are\nordinary and necessary expenses, the reasonableness of which OPC did not challenge. Accordingly,\nthe AU s find that it is appropriate for ETI to charge these expenses to its Texas ratepayers.\n\n\n\n\n794\n      Id. at 5; OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 50.\n795\n      OPC Ex. l (Szerszen Direct) at 50.\n796\n      ETI Ex. 65 (Sloan Rebuttal) at 5.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE232\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n            9. Project FSPCE13759 (Jenkins Class Action Suit)\n\n            The project code relates to a class action lawsuit filed in Texas District Court in 2003 on\nbehalf of all Texas retail customers served by ETI's predecessor-in-interest, EGSI (Jenkins Class\nAction). The Jenkins Class Action plaintiffs allege that they have been damaged due to manipulation\nof the dispatch and pricing of the Entergy system's generating units and electricity purchases. As a\nresult of this alleged manipulation, they contend that ETI's Texas retail customers were charged\nmore than they should have been for purchased power.797 Dr. Szerszen asserted there are three\nreasons why these legal expenses should not be borne by ETI:\n\n\n•     ESI charges 100 percent of the legal expenses to ETI, even though ETI is only one of several\n      defendants;\n\n•     ETI claims that it is defending practices relating to system operations, but fails              to\n      acknowledge that Entergy' s system operations are comprised of many generation                 and\n      transmission components other than those of ETI; and\n\n•     ETI does not have any authority to administer the System Agreement, that           being a function\n      solely within the purview of ESI.798\n\nDr. Szerszen testified that \"[i]t would be more appropriate for the Entergy parent to be charged for\nthese lawsuit expenses, particularly since ETI cannot make unilateral power purchases and power\nsales decisions.\"799\n\n\n            ETI responds that the plaintiffs in this lawsuit are challenging the reasonableness of ETI' s\nCommission-set rates and that the Commission has filed an amicus brief in support of ETI' s position\nin the case. ETI further argues that retail ratepayers are benefitting from ETI' s pursuit of the\nlitigation because ETI is defending practices that are in place to ensure the lowest reasonable cost\nconsistent with system reliability. Finally, ETI states that the costs are reasonable and necessary\n\n\n\n\n797\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 49; ETI Ex. 65 (Sloan Rebuttal) at 2-3.\n798\n      OPC Ex. l (Szerszen Direct) at 49.\n799   Id.\n\fSOAHDOCKET N O . -                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                          PAGE233\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nexpenses because the plaintiffs purport to represent only ETI's ratepayers and seek to recover\ndamages inconsistent with ETI' s filed rates approved by the Commission. 800\n\n\n          The ALls understand Dr. Szerszen's concerns that there are multiple defendants involved in\nthis litigation, there are many aspects to Entergy' s system operations, and ETI does not have power\nto unilaterally make decisions under the System Agreement. The crucial point, however, is that these\nare Texas ratepayers pursuing a challenge to ETI's Texas rates. The matter centers around Texas,\nand the costs of the litigation should be borne by Texas ratepayers.\n\n\n          10. Project F3PCSYSAGR (System Agreement-2001)\n\n          OPC witness Szerszen disallowed $880,841 in legal expenses regarding the 2001 complaint\nfiled by the Louisiana Public Service Commission and the City of New Orleans seeking revisions to\nthe Entergy System Agreement. 801 OPC states that it generally agrees with ETI witness Sloan that\nthe complaint challenges the equalization of costs between all Entergy Operating Company\njurisdictions. 802 However, OPC does not agree that the inquiry \"will\" affect all Entergy jurisdictions.\nTexas has benefitted from the complaint primarily through the past receipt of equalization payments\npursuant to FERC's decision in this complaint matter. However, Entergy's SEC FormlO-K shows\nthat for 2012 and 2013, ETI will receive no equalization payments, and further shows that ETI\nreceived no rough production cost equalization payments in 2010. 803 Thus, according to OPC, the\nlegal expenses sought to be recovered under Project F3PCSYSAGR are non-recurring for ETI and\ntherefore not representative of future costs and should be removed from ETI' s cost of service. 804\n\n\n          ETI established that this litigation involved the System Agreement, which governs the\nequalization of costs between all of the Entergy Operating Company jurisdictions, it provides\nbenefits to ETI's Texas ratepayers as well as those of the other Entergy Operating Companies.\n\n800\n      ETI Ex. 65 (Sloan Rebuttal) at 3.\n801\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 53.\n802\n      ETI Ex. 65 (Sloan Rebuttal) at 9.\n803\n      ETI Ex. 98 (Entergy's SEC Fonn 10-K) at 79-80.\n804\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 52-53.\n\fSOAHDOCKET N O . -                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE234\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nOPC' s argument that ETI did not receive equalization payments in 2010 and is non-recurring for ETI\ndoes not overcome the benefits received by ETI's Texas ratepayers. The ALls recommend that\nOPC's disallowance be denied.\n\n\n          11. Project F3PCCDVDAT (Corporate Development Data Room)\n\n          ETI requests the recovery of $6, 147 in ESI allocated costs for the corporate development data\nroom. The stated purpose of the data room is for due diligence reviews associated with Entergy\nmerger, acquisition, or diversification activities. The expenses associated with the corporate\ndevelopment data room are for the gathering, collating, indexing, manning, and storage of data\nduring the due diligence reviews. 805 OPC contends that the costs incurred for the corporation's\nanalysis of merger, acquisition, and diversification opportunities should not be charged to ETI's\nratepayers.     Entergy has not acquired any utilities or utility operations that might produce\nsystem-wide benefits to utility customers. 806 The $6, 147 of expenses for the corporate development\nroom are not reasonable and necessary expenses that ratepayers should shoulder and therefore,\naccording to OPC, recovery of these expenses should be disallowed.\n\n\n          ETI responds that these costs are driven by each company's need for corporate services and\nthe costs, therefore, are appropriately allocated based on the level of service provided by ESI, which\nis a reasonable proxy of each company's need for corporate services. 807 Further, just because\nEntergy has not acquired any utility or utility operations in the recent past does not mean that these\nare not reasonable and necessary costs. Entergy points out that as Dr. Szerszen noted in her\ndescription of this project, it is not only for the acquisition of other operating units, but also used to\nanalyze diversification activities, which is a legitimate and reasonable undertaking by an integrated\nutility and its parent company.\n\n\n\n\n805\n      OPC Ex. 3 (Szerszen Workpapers) at 394.\n806\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 45-46.\n807\n      ETI Ex. 69 (Tumminello Rebuttal) Ex.

As Ms. Tumminello testified, the Corporate Development Data Room\nincludes costs not only related to mergers and acquisitions, but also diversification activities that\ncould benefit ETI ratepayers. Accordingly, they are properly allocated to ETI ratepayers.\n\n\n          12. Project F3PPWET302 (SPO 2008 Winter Western Region)\n\n          Dr. Szerszen argued that Project F3PPWET302 costs should be disregarded because they\nwere incurred during the 2008-2009 period, which is outside of the Test Year, and they are\nnonrecurring. 808\n\n          ETI witness Cicio explained that although this project was initiated prior to the Test Year, the\ncosts that the Company seeks to recover through this project code were expenses incurred during the\nTest Year. These costs included development activities, requests for proposal issuance, bidders'\nconferences, written and posted questions and answers from market participants and other interested\nparties, submission of proposals, screening of proposals, proposal evaluation, follow-up questions\nand clarifications, recommendations and awards, contract negotiations, Independent Monitor reports,\nand regulatory approvals, if necessary. He stated that these types of costs routinely encompass a\nmulti-year time frame, and the costs required to perform those activities, although associated with a\nproject that may have been initiated several years previously, are properly incurred over the life span\nof the project. He also stated that they are recurring because they reflect the kinds and levels of\ncharges that would be expected to be incurred on an ongoing basis in association with request for\nproposals managed by ESI on behalf of the Entergy Operating Companies, and the Company has\nbeen involved in these types of solicitations since 2002. 809\n\n\n          The AU s find that the costs captured by Project F3PPWET302 were incurred during the Test\nYear and represent the kinds and levels of costs routinely incurred on a recurring basis. Accordingly,\nthe AUs recommend the Commission approve their inclusion as requested by ETI.\n\n\n\n808\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerzen Direct) at 65.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                          PAGE236\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          13. Project F3PPWET308 (SPO Calpine PPA/Project Houston)\n\n          With respect to Project F3PPWET308, which deals with the Calpine-Carville purchased\npower agreement, Dr. Szerszen testified that the costs were either non-recurring, or rate case\nexpenses, or expenses that should have been charged to Louisiana ratepayers. 810\n\n\n          ETI witness Cicio explained that these are recurring costs because they reflect the kinds and\nlevels of charges that the Company expects to incur on an ongoing basis in association with RFPs\nmanaged by ESI on behalf of the Entergy Operating Companies; they were not incurred as part of\nsome rate case preparation and, therefore, are not a rate case expense that is otherwise sought for\nrecovery by ETI; and the costs in the matter are costs that were billed only to Texas and should not\nhave been billed to Louisiana because there is a separate project code that captures the Louisiana\ncosts that are billed to Louisiana. 811\n\n\n          The AU s find that these costs, like those captured by Project F3PPWET302, are recurring in\nthat they represent the kinds and levels of costs routinely incurred on a year-in and year-out basis.\nFurther, the AU s find that the costs should not have been charged to Louisiana and that there existed\na separate project code to capture costs attributable to Louisiana. Accordingly, the AU s recommend\nthe Commission approve the inclusion of these costs as requested by ETI.\n\n\nM.        Other Expenses Class\n\n          Dr. Szerszen recommended disallowances in 11 project codes that are primarily within the\nOther Expenses Class of affiliate costs: (1) F3PCSPETEI (Entergy-Tulane Energy Institute) for a\ndisallowance of $14,288; (2) F3PCC08500 (Executive VP, Operations) for a disallowance of $4, 117;\n(3) F3PPBFMESI (ESI Function Migration Relocation) for a disallowance of $4,187;\n(4) F3PPBFRESI (ESI Business Function Relocation) for a disallowance of $11,444;\n(5) F3PPDRPESI (ESI Disaster Recovery Plan Charge) for a disallowance of $761;\n\n809\n      ETI Ex. 45 (Cicio Rebuttal) at 13-14.\n810\n      OPC Ex.

Projects F3PCSPETEI (Entergy-Tulane Energy Institute) and F5PPKATRPT\n             (Storm Cost Processing & Review)\n\n          ETI agrees with Dr. Szerszen that the $14,288 amount she proposed to disallow for Project\nF3PCSPETEI (Entergy-Tulane Energy Institute) can be treated as a donation, and so should be\nremoved from ETI' s cost of service. ETI also agrees with Dr. Szerszen to remove the $929 billed to\nETI under Project F5PPKATRPT (Storm Cost Processing & Review).                  The charges for the\nremaining nine project codes, however, are contested.\n\n\n          2. Project F3PCC08500 (Executive VP, Operations)\n\n          As to Project F3PCC08500 (Executive VP Operations), Dr. Szerszen testified that an\nasset-based allocator is not appropriate for these types of executive management costs, and there is\n\"no perceivable benefit\" to ETI ratepayers for these types of allocated costs. 813\n\n\n          Ms. Tumminello disagreed, stating that asset-based allocation methods are selected for\nprojects where the costs are driven by the oversight and stewardship of corporate assets of the\nEntergy Companies including, but not limited to, services provided by financial management and\ncertain finance functions, among others. Each Entergy affiliate with assets on Entergy' s consolidated\nbalance sheet will be billed their proportionate share of the costs.

Accordingly, the A.Us recommend the Commission reject OPC's challenge to the\ninclusion of these costs.\n\n\n          3. Projects F3PPBFMESI (ESI Function Migration Relocation), F3PPBFRESI (ESI\n             Business Function Relocation), F3PPDRPESI (ESI Disaster Recovery Plan Charge),\n             FSPPBFMREL (Business Function Migration Employee), FSPPBFRREL (Business\n             Function Relocation), FSPPBFRSEV (Business Function Relocation Severance),\n             FSPPDRPREL (Disaster Recovery Plan Relocation), and FSPPETXRFI (2009 Texas\n             Ike Recovery Filing)\n\n          The remaining eight of the project codes attributable to the Other Expenses Class all deal\nwith system restoration and business continuity resulting from Hurricane Katrina, with one applying\nto Hurricane Ike. Dr. Szerszen testified that these costs should be disallowed because they should\nnot be considered to be system restoration costs or, if they are, citing to PURA§ 36.405, ETI should\nhave requested recovery of these costs in its first base rate following Hurricane Katrina (Docket\nNo. 34800). She also testified that ETI has not shown that Texas ratepayers benefited from these\ncosts. 815\n\n\n          Ms. Tumminello testified that because of the magnitude of Hurricane Katrina, these expenses\nwere necessary so that activities in connection with the restoration of service and infrastructure\nassociated with electric power outages affecting customers could continue. These expenses relate to\ncritical functions needed to support storm restoration, such as business function relocation, and\nprovided a direct benefit to ratepayers. Ms. Tumminello stated that the costs in seven of these\nproject codes (F3PPBFMESI, F3PPBFRESI, F3PPDRPESI, F5PPBFMREL, F5PPBFRREL,\nF5PPBFRSEV, and F5PPDRPREL) are being amortized over five years.

That section deals with securitization of system restoration costs, but ETI did not seek to\nsecuritize any Hurricane Katrina costs. Even so, argues ETI, if that section did apply, it does not\nrestrict system restoration cost recovery solely to Docket No. 34800; that is, the \"next base rate\nproceeding\" following the hurricane. Instead, the final clause in PURA§ 36.405(a) states in full that\nthe Company is entitled to recover such costs \"in its next base rate proceeding or through any other\nproceeding authorized by Subchapter C or D.\" The same point applies to the Hurricane Ike costs;\nwhile ETI did securitize the Hurricane Ike costs that it had incurred up to the date subject to that\nsecuritization, it continued to incur costs in this test year for that storm restoration (in this case, $441\nbilled to the Ike-related project code). The costs in these projects were incurred during the test year\nfor this docket and could not have been recovered in an earlier docket. Moreover, ETI' s filing in this\ndocket was filed in accordance with PURA Subchapter C as a rate change proposed by a utility. As\nsuch, ETI contends that it is entitled to recover these costs. 817\n\n\n          To the AU s, the most important part of the argument is that ETI did not seek to avail itself of\nPURA § 36.405 with respect to Hurricane Katrina costs. It is difficult to understand how that\nsection, which deals with securitization of hurricane costs, could block recovery when ETI did not\nseek to securitize those costs. Similarly, with respect to Hurricane Ike costs, the $441 challenged by\nDr. Szerszen was not incurred until the Test Year and could not have been securitized.\nMs. Tumminello provided testimony that the costs were reasonable and necessary, representing a\npart of ETI' s normal utility operations. Accordingly, the AU s recommend the Commission approve\ninclusion of the costs.\n\n\n\n\n816\n      ETI Ex. 69 (Tumminello Rebuttal) atl6.\n817\n      ETI Initial Brief at 188-189.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                 PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                         PAGE 240\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nN.        Regulatory Services Class\n\n          Dr. Szerszen challenged one project code that is primarily within the Regulatory Services\nClass of affiliate costs: Project F3PPE9981S (Integrated Energy Management for ESI) for a\ndisallowance of $171,032.\n\n\n          Dr. Szerszen testified that these costs were incurred for the implementation, coordination,\nand promotion of demand side and supply side management and energy efficiency programs. But,\nshe stated, these costs should instead have been recovered through ETI' s Energy Efficiency Cost\nRecovery Factor (EECRF) Rider and, as such, it is inappropriate to recover these costs through\naffiliate billings in base rates. 818\n\n\n          ETI witness May testified that recovery of these costs through base rates rather than through\nthe EECRF Rider is appropriate because these activities are not subject to an active ETI energy\nefficiency program. These activities are more in the nature of general research and development\nactivities that help drive the Company's strategy on these topics, such as the timing of implementing\nrelated programs. In the meantime, until these activities result in an actual program proposal, these\nare legitimate known and measurable costs that the Company has incurred and should then be\nrecovered from retail customers. 819 At the hearing, Mr. May further explained that the costs in this\nproject code are labor costs that are \"not really consistent\" with the energy efficiency rule, but\ninstead involve \"primarily costs of investigating\" potential future activities (such as smart meters and\nelectric vehicle chargers) that are generally not consistent with the energy efficiency rider. 820 ETI\nwitness Considine also addresses this issue from a regulatory accounting perspective. He testified:\n\"Because these are not costs that must be, or are currently being recovered through the EECRF, they\nare not double recovered and should be included in the Company's cost of service.\" 821 According to\n\n\n\n\n818\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 69-70.\n819\n      ETI Ex. 57 (May Rebuttal) at 30-31.\n820\n      Tr. at 1929-1930 and 1934-1935.\n821\n      ETI Ex. 46 (Considine Rebuttal) at 36.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE241\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nETI, the costs in this project code, therefore, are not costs that should or can be recovered through\nETI's EECRF Rider.\n\n\n          This is a close call. The Commission's Energy Efficiency Rule places limits on the amount\nof research and development costs a utility may recover, 822 which supports the argument that the\ncosts should be included in the EECRF.            Further, it appears to the ALls that research and\ndevelopment costs, by their very nature, do not relate to an active program, which negates many of\nthe arguments advanced by ETI witnesses May and Considine. In the end, the ALl s believe that\nthese costs should be included in the EECRF. Accordingly, the AUs recommend the Commission\ndisallow costs in the amount of $171,032 relating to Project F3PPE9981S.\n\n\n0.        Retail Operations Class\n\n          Dr. Szerszen challenged three project codes that are primarily within ETI' s Retail Operations\nClass of affiliate costs: (1) F5PPICCIMG (ICC - \"Image\" Message) for a disallowance of $3,912;\n(2) F3PPR56640 (Wholesale - EGS-TX) for a disallowance of $229,938; and (3) F3PPR56920\n(Wholesale - All Jurisdictions) for a disallowance of $333.\n\n\n          1. Project F5PPICCIMG (ICC-\"Image\" Message)\n\n          Project Code F5PPICCIMG (ICC-\"lmage\" Message) is one of the project codes that\nDr. Szerszen testified should be disallowed because ETI is a monopoly and Texas ratepayers should\nnot have to pay for corporate image costs. 823\n\n\n          Ms. Tumminello testified that the costs are for advertising activities that are of a good will or\ninstitutional nature, which is primarily designed to improve the image of the utility or the industry,\nincluding advertisement which inform the public concerning matters affecting the Company's\noperations, such as, the costs of providing service, the Company's efforts to improve the quality of\nservice, the Company's efforts to improve and protect the environment. According to FERC, such\n\n822\n      P.U.C. SUBST.

According to\nMs. Tumminello, as contemplated by FERC, the fact that ETI is a monopoly has no bearing on the\nrecoverability of these costs. 824\n\n\n          OPC provided little support for its claim that costs covered by these project codes should not\nbe recoverable, essentially limiting the basis to the contention that ETI is a monopoly and ratepayers\nshould not be charged with such costs. ETI did provide the testimony of Ms. Tumminello, which\nconfirms that the costs are properly includable in FERC Account 930.1 and are, therefore,\nrecoverable. In the end, the weight of the evidence is in ETI's favor. The AUs recommend the\nCommission reject OPC' s contention that costs covered by these project codes are not recoverable.\n\n\n          2. Projects F3PPR56640 (Wholesale • EGS-TX) and F3PPR56920 (Wholesale • All\n             Jurisdictions)\n\n          As to Projects F3PPR56640 and F3PPR56920, Dr. Szerszen stated that these costs are\nassociated with assisting ETI' s wholesale customers in evaluating alternative energy supply and\ndemand options and that ETI' s retail customers should not be charged for expenses associated with\nETI' s wholesale customers. 825\n\n\n          ETI witness Stokes noted that ETI has allocated costs to its single large wholesale customer\nthrough its jurisdictional allocation in this rate case and, therefore, to disallow the costs in these two\nproject codes would essentially result in a double disallowance of those costs. She also explained\nthat the costs were properly allocable to ETI (keeping in mind that ETI then allocated costs to this\ncustomer) as reasonable and necessary due to the need to have staff on hand to handle contract\nnegotiations and the like with this large wholesale customer. 826\n\n\n          The AU s are persuaded by ETI' s argument that disallowing the costs associated with\nProjects F3PPR56640 and F3PPR56920, which are already allocated to ETI' s single large wholesale\n\n824\n      ETI Ex. 69 (Tumminello Rebuttal) at SBT-R-2 at 4-6.\n825\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 73.\n826\n      ETI Ex. 66 (Stokes Rebuttal) at 6-9.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE243\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ncustomer through its jurisdictional allocation, would constitute a double disallowance. Accordingly,\nthe Alls recommend the Commission reject OPC's challenge to these costs.\n\n\nP.        Supply Chain Class\n\n          Dr. Szerszen challenged two project codes that are primarily within the Supply Chain Class:\n(1) F3PPH54075 (Business Development-TX) for adisallowance of$1,888; and (2) F5PCZSDEPT\n(Supervision & Support - Supply) for a disallowance of $146. Dr. Szerszen claimed. the costs\nassociated with these project codes should be disallowed because ETI is a monopoly and Texas\nratepayers should not have to pay for corporate image costs. 827\n\n\n          Ms. Tumminello testified that the costs are for advertising activities that are of a good will or\ninstitutional nature, which is primarily designed to improve the image of the utility or the industry,\nincluding advertisement which inform the public concerning matters affecting the Company's\noperations, such as, the costs of providing service, the Company's efforts to improve the quality of\nservice, the Company's efforts to improve and protect the environment, etc. According to FERC,\nsuch costs are properly includable in FERC Account 930.1 and are recoverable. According to\nMs. Tumminello, as contemplated by FERC, the fact that ETI is a monopoly has no bearing on the\nrecoverability of these costs. 828\n\n\n          OPC provided little support for its claim that costs covered by these project codes should not\nbe recoverable, essentially limiting the basis to the contention that ETI is a monopoly. ETI did\nprovide the testimony of Ms. Tumminello, which confirms that the costs are properly includable in\nFERC Account 930.1 and are, therefore, recoverable. The AUs go with the weight of the evidence,\nwhich is in ETI's favor. The Al.Js recommend the Commission reject OPC's contention that costs\ncovered by these project codes are not recoverable.\n\n\n\n\n827\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 66.\n828\n      ETI Ex. 69 (Tumminello Rebuttal) at SBT-R-2 at 4-6.\n\fSOAR DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE244\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nQ.        Transmission and Distribution Support Class\n\n          Dr. Szerszen challenged three project codes that are included within the Company's\nTransmission and Distribution Support Class of affiliate costs: (1) F3PCT53130 (Operations\nManager, Claims Management) for a disallowance of $42,287.50; (2) F3PCTDAMAG (Damage\nClaims Of Entergy Property) for a disallowance of $5,555; and (3) F3PCTPUBLC (Public Claims)\nfor a disallowance of $3,968. Dr. Szerszen's rationale for disallowing 50 percent of the costs in each\nof these codes is the same. She believes that ETI' s property damage and workers compensation\nclaims should be direct billed instead of allocated through a customer count-based allocator;\nmanagerial and supervisory costs should be allocated to the jurisdictions based on the jurisdictional\ndirect charges; and the Company has not met its burden of proof as to these charges. 829\n\n\n          Ms. Tumminello addressed Project F3PCT53130, stating that workers' compensation claims\nare tracked by jurisdiction as Dr. Szerszen suggested, and are the basis for billing method\nCOMCLAIM. Project F3PCTWCOMP is used to capture the costs of workers' compensation\nclaims, and bills to both regulated and non-regulated affiliates. Project F3PCT53130 captures costs\nthat are primarily for the oversight of the Entergy Companies' Claims Management organization as it\nrelates to property damage and liability. These services benefit only the companies that serve retail\nelectric and gas customers. Since only the regulated utility operating companies (and not the non-\nregulated companies) serve retail customers, it is appropriate to bill these costs to the regulated\ncompanies based on their pro-rata share of total customers. 830\n\n\n          Projects F3PCTDAMAG and F3PCTPUBLC are addressed by ETI witness Corkran. With\nrespect to Project F3PCTDAMAG, Mr. Corkran stated that the costs associated with this project are\nassociated with the Public Claims employees in the Claims Management Organization. Those\nemployees pursue the recovery of claims allowed by law when the public inflicts damage to\nCompany property. The costs of this service are allocated among all of Entergy's Operating\nCompanies through billing method CUSTEGOP, which allocates costs based on the number of\n\n\n829\n      OPC Exhibit No. l (Szerszen Direct) at 79-80.\n830\n      ETI Ex. 69 (Tumminello Rebuttal) at SBT-R-2 at 10.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE245\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ncustomers in each Operating Company. Dr. Szerszen claimed that the affiliate costs associated with\npursuing those claims should be directly charged to each Entergy Operating Company based on the\nextent to which each claim pertains to the Operating Company instead of generally allocating the\ncosts to all utility customers. Mr. Corkran testified that the allocation methodology is appropriate\nbecause the Public Claims employees provide knowledgeable, centralized, and consistent pursuit of\ndamage claims. The actual monies recovered for damage to ETI' s property are returned to ETI\nratepayers as credits against the cost of repairing those damaged facilities, i.e., the recoveries are not\nallocated pursuant to CUSTEGOP. Only the Public Claims employees' time and overheads are\nallocated pursuant to CUSTEGOP, which is reasonable and appropriate because the overall time\nspent by Public Claims employees in pursuing the recovery of claims is driven by the number of gas\nand electric customers in each Operating Company. 831\n\n\n            With respect to Project F3PCTPUBLC, Mr. Corkran stated that the costs associated with this\nproject are related to Public and Auto Liability employees in the Claims Management Organization.\nThese employees pursue the resolution and settlement of damage claims made against the Operating\nCompanies in a timely and fair manner through denials, negotiations, and payments. Such claims\ninclude allegations of damaged appliances due to voltage fluctuation, food loss due to power outages,\nand damage caused by Company vehicles (e.g., mailboxes, fence posts, and automobiles). This is an\nimportant process that ensures that only warranted and justifiable claims are paid. The CUSTEGOP\nbilling method is appropriate because the Public and Auto Liability employees provide\nknowledgeable, centralized, and consistent resolution of damage claims. The actual payments\nassociated with ETI public damage claims are charged to ETI through the use of other project codes.\nOnly the Public and Auto Liability employees' time and overheads are allocated pursuant to\nCUSTEGOP, which is reasonable and appropriate because the overall time spent by Public and Auto\nLiability employees in processing claims is driven by the number of gas and electric customers in\neach Operating Company. 832\n\n\n\n\n831\n      ETI Ex. 48 (Corkran Rebuttal) at 13-15.\n832   Id.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE246\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n            The explanations that ETI provides for the charges captured by these project codes and the\nmethod of allocation employed makes sense to the AUs. In a large organization, it is necessary to\nhave a group of people to process claims efficiently so that economies of scale can be realized; that is\nwhat ETI is doing with these project codes. These costs benefit all companies within the Entergy\numbrella (or within the regulated entities portion as noted), so the allocation methodology employed\nis appropriate. The ALls recommend the Commission reject OPC's challenge to the recovery of\nthese costs.\n\n\nR.          Tax Services Class\n\n            Dr. Szerszen proposed a 25 percent ($221,007) disallowance of costs billed to ETI from a\nsingle project code in this Tax Services Class: Project Code F3PCF10445 (Entergy Consolidated Tax\nServices). The costs in this project were incurred in the preparation, research, and other costs\nassociated with Entergy's consolidated tax return. Dr. Szerszen testified that an assets-based\nallocator is not appropriate for these costs and that the costs in the project should instead be directly\nbilled to each affiliate based on the time spent on preparing that affiliate' s income and expense\ndata. 833\n\n\n            Company witness Galbraith, who sponsors ETI' s Tax Services Class, stated that Dr. Szerszen\napparently believes that all costs associated with the preparation of Entergy' s consolidated tax return\nare captured by this project code and are allocated, when they should be direct-billed. Most of the\ncosts associated with preparation of Entergy' s consolidated tax return, according to Ms. Galbraith,\nare assigned to other project codes and are direct billed. Ms. Galbraith then explained that:\n(1) 56 percent of the time that Tax Services spent on the Entergy consolidated tax return were direct\nbilled through other project codes to the affiliates; (2) the project code also captures costs for tax\nresearch (both federal and state and local), monthly closing activities not specific to one legal entity,\ntax training that is not jurisdiction specific, compliance with file retention policy, and administration\nstaff time; and (3) why the assets-based allocator is the best method for allocating these departmental\n\n\n\n833\n      OPC Ex.

According to Ms. Galbraith, the costs captured by this code are not susceptible to direct\nbilling. 834\n\n\n          The AlJs find that Dr. Szerszen did fail to consider that most of the costs of preparing\nEntergy's tax return are direct billed and that the costs covered by this project code are not\nsusceptible to such a billing, which is why they are allocated. The AlJs, therefore, recommend the\nCommission reject OPC' s challenge to ETI' s allocation of these costs.\n\n\nS.        Transmission Operations Class\n\n          Dr. Szerszen challenged three project codes that are primarily within the Transmission\nOperations Class: (1) F3PPTDHY19 (Dept. of Justice Investigations) for a disallowance of $765;\n(2) F3PPTREORG (Transmission Re-Organization) for a disallowance of $3,661; and\n(3) F3PPF30211 (ESI Transmission Bldg (Reclassification)) for a disallowance of $229,991. 835\n\n\n          Dr. Szerszen addressed Project F3PPTREORG (Transmission-Reorganization) and testified\nthat costs covered by this project were incurred in 2009 and 2010 and, therefore, are not recurring. 836\nMs. Tumminello responds that, while these particular costs do not recur every year, they are\nrepresentative of normal recurring utility operations and do recur as necessary and, as such, they\nshould not be disallowed. 837\n\n\n          Dr. Szerszen testified that Project F3PPF30211 (ESI Transmission Bldg.) captures interest\ncosts after the ESI transmission building was placed in service. She contends that the costs are\nreclassified pre-Test Year payments and post-Test Year interest costs that are not known and\nmeasureable. 838 Ms. Tumminello testified that Dr. Szerszen has misconstrued accounting entries.\n\n\n834\n      ETI Ex. 26 (Galbraith Direct) at 10-12.\n835\n    Project F3PPTDHY 19 (Dept. of Justice Investigations) was discussed in Section VIII.L.

It appears to the AU s that Dr. Szerszen did\nmisconstrue accounting entries in preparing her analysis of Project F3PPF3021 land that the charges\nin that project capture fees paid during the Test Year. Accordingly, the ALls recommend that OPC's\nproposed disallowance be denied.\n\n\nT.        Treasury Operations Class\n\n          Dr. Szerszen challenged three project codes that are primarily within the Treasury Operations\nClass: (1) F5PCZZI07P (Directors & Officers (EIM)) for a disallowance of $14,483;\n(2) F3PCF25300 (Daily Cash Mgt Activities) for a disallowance of $7,286; and (3) F3PCF26022\n(Financing & Short Term Funding) for a disallowance of $96,700.\n\n\n          With respect to Project F5PCZZ107P (Directors & Officers (EIM)), Dr. Szerszen testified\nthat the directors and officers liability insurance subject to this project code is primarily aimed at\nbenefiting shareholders, rather than ratepayers and, because ETI does not manage ESI' s operations, it\nshould not be responsible for indemnifying against shareholder lawsuits. 840\n\n\n          ETI witness McNeal stated that ESI provides essential administrative and operational\nservices to ETI on a daily basis. To do this, it must employ (and retain) qualified officers and\ndirectors. These individuals must be assured that they can make reasoned decisions without fear of\npersonal liability and the manner to provide them this assurance is to purchase director's and\nofficer's liability insurance. Because ETI benefits from the services provided by the officers and\n\n\n\n\n839\n      ETI Ex. 69 (Tumminello Rebuttal) at 15. See also Ex.

These are not specific to any one company, but are applicable to all of the\ncompanies within the umbrella of the Entergy corporate family. There are Company-specific\nactivities that are charged directly to ETI under different project codes, and this constitutes the\nmajority of financing and cash management activities during the Test Year.                            For\nProject F3PCF25300, the costs are driven by cash management products and services delivered to all\nthe Entergy companies. Because the number of transactions executed on behalf of each Entergy\ncompany is directly related to the number of bank accounts by company irrespective of account size,\nbilling method BNKACCTA, which allocates costs based on the number of open bank accounts is,\naccording to ETI, the appropriate method to allocate the costs of these services. 843\n\n\n          With respect to Project F3PCF26022, ETI explains that the project code captures costs for\nmanaging Entergy companies' liability portfolios comprised of Entergy company securities, bank\nlines, and project financings. The work is performed for the benefit of all companies under the\nEntergy corporate umbrella, not just ETI and is not duplicative of services performed for ETI. When\nwork is performed by ESI personnel that relates specifically to ETI, then ETI is charged directly\n\n841\n      ETI Ex. 61 (McNeal Rebuttal) at 7-8.\n842\n      OPC Ex. l (Szerszen Direct) at 74-75, Ex.

The services include analyzing and supporting general capital\nstructure policy, developing and analyzing general financial policies, investigating and evaluating\nfinancing options generally that might prove beneficial for any or all Entergy companies, including\nETI, and facilitating ongoing administration related to all Entergy Operating Company financings.\nAccordingly, ETI argues that it is appropriate to allocate a share of those costs to ETI. The costs of\nthis project are driven by the level of service needed to complete the project or activity. Allocator\nLVSVCAL allocates costs based upon the overall service level ofESI. This allocation is appropriate\nbecause ESI is providing the service and no one Operating Company alone benefits from the services\nprovided under this project code. 844\n\n\n         OPC appears to have taken too narrow a view with respect to these project codes. First, it\nappears that where services are performed solely for ETI, they are charged to ETI through specific\nproject codes. The project codes that OPC challenges are for company-wide services that are\npartially allocated to ETI. It is logical to assume that a certain level of services can be performed\nmore efficiently at a company-wide level and that Texas ratepayers will benefit by paying only the\nallocated portion of those costs, as is done in these cases. The allocators chosen by ETI appear to\nreasonably reflect the cost-causation. Therefore, the AUs recommend that OPC's challenge be\nrejected.\n\n\nU.       Utility and Executive Management Class\n\n         OPC challenges five project codes that are primarily within the Utility & Executive\nManagement Class: (1) F3PPCCSO 10 (Climate Consulting Services) for a disallowance of $19,821;\n(2) F3PCCPM001 (Corporate Performance Management) for a disallowance of $173,867;\n(3) F3PCC31255 (Operations-Office of the CEO) foradisallowanceof$372,919; (4) F3PPCA0001\n(Chief Administrative Officer) for a disallowance of $177,156; and (5) F3PPC00001 (Chief\nOperating Officer) for a disallowance of $74,485.\n\n\n\n\n844\n      ETI Ex. 61 (McNeal Rebuttal) at 2-3; Tr. at 547-548.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                          PAGE251\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          As to the first, Project F3PPCCS010 (Climate Counseling Services), Dr. Szerszen testified\nthat these costs are incurred for the development of company-wide environmental policies,\nprocedures, and programs; that expenses are improperly allocated to the subsidiaries based on each\ncompany's fossil operating capacity; and, as a result, the non-regulated affiliates are not allocated any\nenvironmental initiative expenses. She therefore recommended that 50 percent of this project's costs\nbe disallowed. 845\n\n\n          ETI witness Stokes addressed Dr. Szerszen' s challenge to this project. Ms. Stokes explained\nthat although nuclear-related environmental projects are being pursued, they are not being pursued\nusing the project code referenced by Dr. Szerszen in her challenge. The costs for non-regulated\naffiliates are charged to projects not included in ETI' s affiliate costs in this case. Non-regulated\naffiliates use project codes specific to their businesses to maintain a separation of costs between\nregulated and non-regulated Entergy subsidiaries. 846\n\n\n          For the remaining four project codes in this class, Dr. Szerszen stated that executive\nmanagement is primarily concerned with overall corporate functions rather than issues for any one\nspecific subsidiary, and there is no relationship between an assets-based allocator and executive\nmanagement. 847\n\n\n          ETI responds to these arguments by stating that the functions covered by these project codes\nrelate to the oversight of all system operations and the stewardship of corporate assets and that\nbecause ETI is part of a corporate group, the allocated charges associated with these services are\nrelevant to ETI as part of that group of companies. Furthermore, ETI argues, the asset-based\nallocator is appropriate because it reflects the cause of the costs incurred, in that, services provided\nrelate to the stewardship of all the corporation's assets. 848\n\n\n\n845\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 62.\n846\n      ETI Ex. 66 (Stokes Rebuttal) at 5.\n847\n      OPC Ex. l (Szerszen Direct) at 56, 60.\n848\n      ETI Ex. 4 (Domino Direct) at 18-38; ETI Ex. 69 (Tumminello Rebuttal) at 9-11.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE252\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n            A corporation cannot function without executives, who are charged with the responsibility of\noverseeing, among other things, the assets of the corporation.

JURISDICTIONAL COST ALLOCATION [Germane to Preliminary Order\n                                    Issue No. 13]\n\n            Jurisdictional cost allocation involves the proper method for allocating production costs\nbetween ETI' s Texas retail customers and its wholesale customers, which are subject to FERC\njurisdiction. During the Test Year, ETI provided electric service to retail customers and to three\nwholesale customers-including ETEC-under service agreements and rates approved by FERC.\nETEC is a partial requirements customer, and it will be ETI's only wholesale customer during the\nRate Year. ETI estimated its cost of serving wholesale customers in a jurisdictional separation study\nthat split ETI' s cost of service between retail and the wholesale jurisdictions. 849\n\n\n            To calculate the wholesale cost allocation factor, ETI proposed the use of 150 MW for the\nwholesale load. This results in a retail production demand allocation factor of 95.3838 percent. The\n150-MW load represents the contractual minimum amount of capacity for which ETEC is obligated\nto pay under its partial requirements agreement. No party contests this aspect of ETI' s proposed\nallocation of costs between retail and wholesale customers. 850\n\n\n            However, Cities contest the type of allocation methodology used to assign demand-related\n(fixed) production costs to each jurisdiction. In this proceeding, ETI used the A&E 4CP allocation\nmethod.

A&E4CP\n\n          Kroger witness Kevin C. Higgins explained the A&E 4CP method:\n\n\n          [T]he Average and Excess Demand method uses an average demand or total energy\n          allocator to allocate that portion of the utility's generating capacity that would be\n          needed if all customers used energy at a constant 100 percent load factor. The cost of\n          capacity above average demand is then allocated in proportion to each class's excess\n          demand, where excess demand is measured as the difference between each class's\n          individual peak demand and its average demand. In this manner, the incremental\n          amount of production plant that is required to meet loads that are above average\n          demand is assigned to the users who create the need for the additional capacity....\n          the A&E/4CP variant . . . uses 4 CP to measure excess demand, whereas the\n          conventional version uses class non-coincident peak ....852\n\n          ETI witness Myra L. Talkington also explained that the A&E 4CP method, noting that ETI' s\ncoincident peak demand is measured for the months of June through September. Ms. Talkington\nrecommends the A&E 4CP allocation because it \"reasonably reflects the mix of the Company's\ncustomers and their respective electrical load characteristics and the relative cost incurred to serve\nsuch loads.\" 853 She also believes this allocation methodology provides a reasonable balance between\nthe contribution to the system peak and energy requirements. 854\n\n\n          As noted above, ETI's use of A&E 4CP is a change from the 12CP methodology it used\nwhen it operated within two states. Ms. Talkington testified that 12CP was appropriate in the past\nbecause System Agreement costs were allocated between Entergy Operating Companies using 12CP.\nThe Texas retail portion of the production costs were then allocated between the retail classes using\n\n851\n      Cities Ex. 4 (Goins Direct) at 10.\n852\n      Kroger Ex. 2 (Higgins Cross Rebuttal) at 3 (footnotes deleted).\n853\n      ETI Ex. 23 (Talkington Direct) at 6; OPC Ex. 6 (Benedict Direct) at 17.\n854\n      ETI Ex. 23 (Talkington Direct) at 6.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                        PAGE254\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nthe A&E 4CP methodology (as ETI is doing in this case). However, according to Ms. Talkington,\nnow that ETI operates in only one state, no jurisdictional allocation among states is necessary;\ntherefore, only one allocation methodology, i.e., A&E 4CP, should be used to allocate production\ncosts between the retail classes and the wholesale jurisdiction. Ms. Talkington testified that the A&E\n4CP methodology factors in year-round demand through the average and excess function and also\n                                                                        855\nmatches the allocator used to allocate costs within the retail class.\n\n\n          Cities opposes the use of A&E 4CP and suggest a 12CP methodology is preferable.\nCommission Staff does not oppose ETI' s use of A&E 4CP. No other party takes a position on this\nissue.\n\n\nB.        12CP\n\n          Thel2CP methodology allocates production capacity costs in proportion to each class's\ndemands that occur on the date and time of ETI's system peak in each of the 12 months. 856 Cities\nbelieve it is more appropriate for ETI to allocate fixed production costs between the wholesale\ncustomers and Texas retail customers using 12CP. Cities witness Dennis W. Goins testified that the\n12CP approach is consistent with the cost-of-service approach FERC typically uses to allocate\ndemand-related production costs reflected in wholesale rate schedules, and it is consistent with the\nassignment of MSS-1 costs (as well as MSS-2 transmission costs) to ETI under the Entergy System\nAgreement. Dr. Goins reviewed ETI' s Rate Year purchased power capacity costs month by month.\nHe determined that ETI' s heavy reliance on capacity purchases to serve retail and wholesale load,\nand the relative stability of those projected monthly purchased power capacity costs, suggest that the\n12CP method should properly split ETI' s demand-related production costs between the Texas retail\nand wholesale jurisdictions.857\n\n\n\n\n855\n      ETI Ex. 67 (Talkington Rebuttal) at 6-7.\n856\n      TIEC Ex. 3 (Pollock Cross Rebuttal) at 26.\n857\n      Cities Ex. 4 (Goins Direct) at 10-12.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                 PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE255\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          Dr. Goins calculated Test Year 12CP allocation factors for the Texas retail and wholesale\njurisdictions, and provided them to Cities witness Karl Nalepa for inclusion in his jurisdictional\nseparation study. He determined the following: 858\n\n\n                         Jurisdiction          A&E4CP           12CP\n                      Texas Retail              95.3838%         94.6208%\n                      Wholesale                  4.6162%          5.7923%\n                      Total                         100%              100%\n\n\n          In making this calculation, Dr. Goins used a loss-adjusted 150 MW (ETEC's monthly\nbilling MW) as a proxy for the 12 monthly CPs. In his view, the 150 MW is indicative of ETI' s\ncapacity obligations to ETEC, and it reflects known and measurable changes compared to test-year\nwholesale CPs (which would include CPs for wholesale customers that ETI no longer serves). 859\n\n\n          Cities point out that ETI previously allocated production costs to the wholesale jurisdiction\non a 12CP basis. ETI first requested that the Commission change the 12CP method in Docket\nNo. 37744. 860 According to Cities, ETI's request to change the 12CP methodology in Docket\nNo. 37744 is significant because ETI's wholesale load consisted of Brazos Electric Cooperative, Inc.\n(Brazos) and ETEC. The Brazos contract assigned Brazos' share of ETI' s production costs based\nupon a 12CP allocator. Thus, contends Cities, all costs that would have been over-allocated to retail\ncustomers would have been pocketed by ETI (if the 12CP allocator had changed). Cities argue that\nETI's request to deviate from its approved 12CP allocator will result in retail customers subsidizing\nproduction costs.        Dr. Goins calculated that the 12CP allocation factor for ETI's wholesale\njurisdiction is approximately 5 .3 8 percent versus 4.62 percent under the A&E 4CP method. 861 Cities\nconclude that retail customers will subsidize the difference between the two allocators, which is\n\n\n858\n      Cities Ex. 4 (Goins Direct) at 12.\n859\n      Cities Ex. 4 (Goins Direct) at 10-12.\n860\n     The parties in that docket stipulated the majority of issues in the case, including issues relating to\njurisdictional allocation.\n861\n      Cities Ex. 4 (Goins Direct) at l 1-12.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                       PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE256\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n0.76 percent. Because the allocation is applied to all production costs, including purchased power\ncapacity costs, the 0.76 percent difference is significant, contend Cities.\n\n\n           According to ETI, Cities' arguments are based on a non-existent situation-the provision of\nservice to Brazos-and should be rejected. The AUs acknowledge that ETI is no longer serving\nBrazos. Dr. Goins noted such in his testimony. Rather, the basis for his recommendation was:\n(1) the 12CP approach is consistent with FERC's wholesale rate allocation; (2) the 12CP method is\nused to derive each Entergy Operating Company's load responsibility ratio and share of monthly\nMSS-1 and MSS-2 charges; and (3) ETI' s purchased power capacity costs do not vary significantly\nmonth to month. Although Ms. Talkington understood that the A&E 4CP methodology is the same\none used to allocate production costs between classes, TIEC witness Pollock noted that it is often not\nappropriate to use the same allocation method for both jurisdictional and class allocations. He noted\nthat, in jurisdictional separation, allocations are between retail and wholesale entities, with wholesale\nsubject to FERC regulation. 862 ETI did not fully explain why A&E 4CP is the best methodology for\nallocation production costs between the retail and wholesale jurisdictions.             Dr. Goins' and\nMr. Pollock's testimonies were ultimately more persuasive on this issue. Accordingly, the AUs\nrecommend the use of 12CP to allocate capacity-related production costs between the retail and\nwholesale jurisdictions.\n\n\n      X.

Renewable Energy Credit Rider [Germane to Preliminary Order Issue No. 19]\n\n          The Legislature has established a goal for the installation of an additional 5,000 MW of\ngenerating capacity from renewable energy technology. It also set out annual goals for electric\nutilities to meet on a cumulative basis in order to encourage the development of renewable energy\ngeneration in Texas: A utility may meet its annual goals by installing generation, by purchasing\ncapacity based on renewable energy technology, or by purchasing sufficient renewable energy credits\n(RECs). 863\n\n\n          1. ETl's Proposed Cost Recovery\n\n          Staff witness William B. Abbott explained that the Company currently recovers its REC costs\nthrough base rates. Each credit represents one megawatt-hour (MWh) of renewable energy that\nmeets certain criteria set forth in P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.l 73(e), and these credits can be traded among\nparticipants in the Texas market. ETI proposes to remove these costs from base rates and implement\na REC Rider to recover its projected REC costs. After the initial rider is established, the REC Rider\nwould be reset annually to recover projected REC costs for the upcoming year, adjusted by any past\nover- or under-recovery and any revenue-related expenses. 864 With the introduction of the REC\nRider, ETI would withdraw its current Renewable Portfolio Standard Calculation Opt-Out Credit\nRider, which provides a credit to offset the base rate REC costs for certain customers who are\nexempt from paying REC costs. These customers would instead be exempt from charges under the\nproposed REC Rider. 865\n\n\n          ETI suggests that a rider is necessary because the level of REC costs incurred from year to\nyear is not known, and the cots are unknowable and very volatile. ETI witness Heather G. LeBlanc\n\n\n\n\n863\n      PURA §39.904(a) and (b).\n864\n      See ETI Ex. 31 (LeBlanc Direct) at 26.\n865\n      Staff Ex. 7 (Abbott Direct) at 11-12.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                               PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                        PAGE258\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ntestified that certain customers can opt out, and a rider is the most efficient manner to administer\nsuch opt out. 866\n\n\n          Initially, ETI based its rates for the proposed rider on the Company's Test Year renewable\nenergy credit costs, which were incurred on a Texas retail basis for the 12 months ending June 30,\n2011. ETI requested $623,303 and, after applying the revenue-related expense factor of 1.01307,\nproposed a revenue requirement of $631,450. 867 In rebuttal testimony, Ms. LeBlanc stated that the\nCompany's proposal should be updated to reflect the most current data available. She stated that\n\"events\" since the Company's initial filing in November 2011 caused costs for the Company to\nincrease. 868 She calculated an updated amount of $1,145,043, which, when the revenue-related\nexpense factor is applied, results in an updated revenue requirement of $1,160,008. 869 She believes\nthat the updated amounts further support the Company's position that REC costs are volatile.\n\n\n          2. Opposition to ETl's Proposal\n\n          Cities, OPC, State Agencies, and Commission Staff oppose ETI' s proposed REC Rider.\n\n\n          State Agencies argue that ETI's proposed REC Rider should be rejected because it deviates\nfrom the Commission's ratemaking policies and is inconsistent with PURA State Agencies witness\nKit Pevoto testified that the proposed rider is not appropriate because: (1) the rider is piecemeal\nratemaking, which deviates from the Commission's traditional ratemaking policies and is\ninconsistent with PURA; (2) the reconciliation (true-up) process in the proposed tariff is not\nspecifically provided for by PURA or PUC rule, or required to implement the REC process; (3) the\nredetermination of rates in the proposed annual filings would be based on projected or estimated\ncosts, rather than historical test year costs; which is not in compliance with PURA or the\nCommission's rules; and (4) ETI has not justified the need to have a rate recovery for REC costs\n\n\n866\n      ETI Ex. 31 (LeBlanc Direct) at 25.\n867\n      Id. at 24.

Ms. Pevoto explained that the traditional test\nyear cost of service ratemaking process, including regulatory lag, helps to match costs and revenues\nand to provide incentives that balance the utility's and its customers' interests. The proposed REC\nrider deviates from the traditional PURA rate-setting because it allows the Company to reset its rates\nautomatically each year without going through a comprehensive rate proceeding. In her view, the\nrider would eliminate the regulatory lag incentive for ETI to prudently manage these costs because\nthe rider allows for annual cost recovery adjustments. Ms. Pevoto observed that various provisions\nin PURA authorize riders for collection of other expenses, but no such provision exists for recovery\nof REC expenses, even though the Legislature mandated that utilities be responsible for a certain\nlevel of REC MWs. And she noted that if ETI's REC expenses increase due to increases in total\n                                                                                                  870\nREC MW requirements, ETI can request to include those increased costs in a future rate case.\n\n\n          In reference to Ms. LeBlanc's rebuttal testimony that \"events\" caused ETI's REC costs to\nincrease, State Agencies contend that ETI may have paid more for RECs during the Test Year\nbecause it contacted suppliers only after the REC requirement was mandated. ETI acknowledged\nthat RECs were in the $1.10 to $1.25 range at the beginning of the year and then appreciated to over\n$2.00 and peaked out at $2.55 in the first quarter of 2012. Moreover, one of the largest REC\nsuppliers unexpectedly withdrew its offers in March of 2011, which also led to price increases.\nMarch 31 is the end of the compliance period, and the deadline may increase the volume of\npurchases, which can add to price increases. 871 State Agencies note that ETI did not participate in\nthe competitive REC market until February 2012 and bought its RECs near the peak price. State\nAgencies contend that only Test Year costs of $623,303 should be included in base rates.\n\n\n          Cities witness Karl Nalepa also opposed the REC Rider. He testified that the Commission\nshould not permit ETI to single out REC costs from base rates because it presented no evidence that\nthese costs should be treated differently than they are now. He added that RECs are not related to\nfuel so much as they are related to retail sales and plant output. In his opinion, the Test Year amount\n\n\n\n870\n      State Agencies Ex. 2 (Pevoto Direct) at 6, 8-1 l.\n871\n      State Agencies Ex. 12, RFI.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                             PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE260\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nfor REC of $633,985 should be included in base rates. 872 Cities witness James Z. Brazell also\ntestified that ETI currently recovers a large portion of its revenues through non-fuel piecemeal riders.\nWhile he believes some riders are necessary and appropriate, ETI' s general movement of cost\nrecovery from base rates to riders (as evidenced in this proceeding) is inconsistent with PURA and\nthe prohibition against piecemeal ratemaking. 873\n\n\n          OPC also opposed ETI' s proposed REC Rider on the basis that it constitutes piecemeal\nratemaking. OPC witness Nathan A. Benedict noted that in Project No. 35628, the Commission\nrejected alternative mechanisms for the recovery of REC costs but reserved the right to consider the\nissue at a later date. 874 He stressed that, when rejecting alternative recovery mechanisms for REC\ncosts, the Commission recognized that REC costs are variable, that the purchase of RECs is\nmandated by law, and that certain customers can opt out of the Renewable Portfolio Standard\nprogram. Thus, in Mr. Benedict's view, the Commission has already rejected the arguments\nadvanced by ETI here. He added that ETI did not indicate a negative and substantial impact as a\nresult of transmission customers opting out of the Renewable Portfolio Standard program, and ETI\nappears to be currently administering the program effectively without REC Rider. In short,\nMr. Benedict concluded that costs related to renewable energy credits should be recovered through\nbase rates, and ETI's current opt-out rider should continue as the vehicle for ETI to handle\ntransmission-level opt-outs. 875\n\n\n          Commission Staff also opposes ETI' s request, stating that it amounts to unauthorized\npiecemeal ratemaking that should be disallowed. In Staffs view, the existing opt-out rider should be\nmaintained but updated to reflect the test year data used to set the ETI' s base rates.

Mr. Abbott acknowledged that the Legislature has authorized the recovery of\ncertain specific costs outside of base rates, but no such authorization exists for the recovery of REC\ncosts. 876\n\n\n          In addition, Mr. Abbott criticized the proposed REC rider because in the future it would\nallow prospective recovery of estimated REC costs. He believed that such an arrangement would\neliminate any regulatory lag and thus eliminate any incentive for ETI to minimize the costs of\npurchasing the required RECs. 877 Mr. Abbott also pointed out that the proposed rider contains a\nsingle rate for all customer classes and includes a \"revenue related expense factor,\" which increases\nthe overall rider revenue requirement to, in part, account for projected uncollectable bills. 878 This\nwould shift the costs of uncollectable bills from customer classes with greater bad debt onto\ncustomer classes with lower bad debt. Further, Mr. Abbott stated, the proposed true-up portion of\nthe REC Rider would eliminate the need for a bad debt factor, as any actual under-collected amounts\nwould carry forward and could be recovered in future filings. Also, the single rate could result in\ncost-shifting between customer classes, as over- or under- recoveries resulting from billing\ndeterminant forecast error would vary by customer class.

In the alternative, if the Commission approves the REC Rider requested\nby ETI, Mr. Abbott recommended the following changes from the Company's request:\n\n\n                   The REC Rider should be set every year to collect the previous year's actual REC\n                   costs (instead of projected REC costs), plus any over- or under- recovery from prior\n                   periods.\n\n                   The previous year's actual REC costs should be allocated to each customer class\n                   based upon each class's actual energy usage over the time period for which the RECs\n                   were acquired.\n\n                   Any over- or under- recovery balances should be tracked by each customer class, and\n                   thus a separate REC Rider rate should be calculated for each customer class based on\n                   that class's allocated REC costs adjusted by that class's over- or under- recovery\n                   balance.\n\n                   The REC Rider rates should be calculated using billing determinants based upon\n                   ETI's best forecast of each customer class's energy usage over the rider's Rate\n                   Year.880\n\n\n          3. ETl's Response\n\n          ETI contends that adoption of the rider does not result in piecemeal ratemaking because these\nare the types of costs that the Company cannot control.

ETI disputes State Agencies' claims that ETI could have purchased RECs at a lower level at\nother points in the year, stating there is no evidence that the Company could have bought RECs at a\nlower level at other points in the year.\n\n\n          Finally, ETI takes issue with the parties' argument that there is no statutory recovery for REC\ncosts outside of base rates. ETI argues that there is no statutory authority requiring the Company to\nrefund costs to opt-out industrial customers. According to ETI, no explicit statutory authority is\nnecessary, and the parties have failed to establish that any harm would result from implementation of\nthe rider.\n\n\n          4. ALJs' Analysis\n\n          The AU s are persuaded by the testimonies of Staff and intervenor witnesses Pevoto, Nalepa,\nAbbot, Benedict, and Brazell that ETI's proposed REC rider should be rejected. The testimony\nsupports a finding that adoption of the rider results in piecemeal ratemaking. ETI' s argument that\ncosts are volatile and, therefore, should be isolated and recovered in a manner similar to an annual\nfuel factor filing was not supported by sufficient evidence. Additionally, the AUs agree that the\nproposed rider eliminates any incentive for ETI to minimize the costs of purchasing the required\nRECs. ETI proffered unconvincing argument and insufficient evidence that standard cost recovery\nwas insufficient for ETI to recover its total REC costs and a reasonable return.\n\n\n             The AU s further find that the Test Year expense of $623 ,303 should be used for setting rates\nin this case. 882 ETI failed to proffer sufficient evidence and argument to support any increase to its\n\n881\n      ETI Ex. 55 (LeBlanc Rebuttal) at 11.\n882\n   This is the amount referenced in Ms. LeBlanc' s testimony at ETI Ex. 31 at 24 and confirmed in State\nAgencies Ex. 9.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE264\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ninitial request through rebuttal testimony. As recommended by Staff witness Abbott, the Renewable\nPortfolio Standard Calculation Opt-Out Credit Rider should be maintained, with an adjustment to the\ncredit rates to reflect the Test Year data used to set ETI' s base rates.\n\n\nB.        Class Cost Allocation [Germane to Preliminary Order Issue No. 14]\n\n          A cost-of-service study is an analysis used to determine the responsibility for a utility's costs\nfor each customer class. Thus, it determines whether the revenues a class generates cover that class's\ncost-of-service. A class cost-of-service study separates the utility's total costs into portions incurred\non behalf of the various customer groups. Most of a utility's costs are incurred to jointly serve many\ncustomers.      For purposes of rate design and revenue allocation, customers are grouped into\nhomogeneous classes according to their usage patterns and service characteristics.\n\n\n          The parties generally agreed that ETI's cost-of-service study comported with accepted\nindustry practices, but some parties had issues with specific items discussed below.\n\n\n          1. Municipal Franchise Fees\n\n          Municipal Franchise Fees (MFF) are charges for a utility's use of municipal rights-of-way.\nThe charges are levied by municipalities based on the amount of electricity sold within the municipal\nboundaries. They are also referred to as street rental taxes. The MFF charged to ETI are based on\nordinances passed by the cities in which ETI makes retail sales. Different cities have enacted\ndifferent levels of MFF on in-city kWh sales, ranging from 0.0956¢ to as much as 0.2644¢ per\nkWh. 883 For the portion of fees ETI collects through base rates, ETI proposes to allocate among\ncustomer classes based on customer class revenues relative to total revenues. 884 Once MFF costs are\n\n\n\n\n883\n   TIEC Ex. 1 (Pollock Direct) at 52 and Ex.

ETI notes\nthat it is following Commission precedent, and it opposes the use of different allocation factors for\nthese FERC accounts: Account 408.152, Franchise Tax State; Account 408.154 Franchise Tax\nLocal; and Account 408.163, Street Rental.\n\n\n          OPC witness Benedict testified that MFF should be allocated on the basis of in-city kWh\nsales, without an adjustment for the MFF rate in the municipality in which a given kWh sale\noccurred.

Staff points out that PURA§ 33 .008(b ),\nwhich authorizes the collection of municipal franchise fees, states that \"[t]he compensation a\nmunicipality may collect from each electric utility ... shall be equal to the charge per kilowatt hour .\n. . times the number of kilowatt hours delivered within the municipalities boundaries. \" 890 According\nto Staff, PURA § 33.008(b) plainly links the amount of municipal franchise fees to each class's\nin-city kWh sales.

He believes\nOPC' s and Staff's proposal fails to recognize the different MFF rates charged by cities. Because\ncities that have a preponderance of industrial sales generally charge lower MFF rates, this proposal\nwould require LIPS customers to pay 0.1965¢ per kWh, which is more than the weighted average\nMFF cost to the LIPS class of 0.1612¢ per kWh. Thus, Mr. Pollock argues that this would require\nLIPS customers to subsidize other customer classes and would not be consistent with cost causation.\nMr. Pollock thought his proposal to allocate MFF by city by class resulted in each customer class\npaying only the MFF expenses actually incurred. 892\n\n\n          The AUs find OPC's and Staffs proposed allocation methodology best comports with\nPURA§ 33.008 and Commission precedent. As noted by Mr. Benedict, PURA was amended after\nthe Commission's decision in Docket No. 16705, which allocated MFF on the basis of rate schedule\nrevenue. PURA§ 33.008 expressly calls for a kWh basis for allocation and this is confirmed in the\ncases litigated since Docket No. 16705, which were cited by Commission Staff. Accordingly, the\nAU recommend that MFF be allocated on the basis of in-city kWh sales, without an adjustment for\nthe MFF rate in the municipality in which a given kWh sale occurred.\n\n\n                      (b) MFF Collection\n\n          All parties except TIEC recommend that the Commission approve ETI' s proposed allocation\nof franchise fee rentals to all customers. Cities witness Mr. Brazell testified that franchise fees are in\nthe nature of a rental, not a tax, and like all rental charges ETI incurs, the expense should be spread\namong all customers. He stated that MFF charges have always been collected from all customers,\n\n\nNo. 33309, Order on Rehearing at FoF 150 (Mar. 4, 2008) (stating in connection with a proposed municipal\nfranchise fee expense rider that \"[h]aving different rates in each municipality in TCC's service territory is\ncontrary to the Commission's desire for uniform, simple rates\").\n892\n      TIEC Ex. 3 (Pollock Cross Rebuttal) at 8, 33-35.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                  PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE268\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nwhether or not they take service within the corporate limits, except for the limited incremental\nfranchise fees specifically addressed by PURA § 39.456. Mr. Brazell explained that electrical\nfacilities within ETI's system are physically interconnected and electrically synchronized. The\nfacilities located within a city's boundaries are not isolated physically or electrically from the\nfacilities outside the city limits. Rather, they are tied to one another and function as a single\nintegrated system, and ETI' s facilities inside each city benefit all customers in ETI' s service area,\nwhether or not those customers are within the city. Therefore, Mr. Brazell recommended that the\nCommission approve ETI's request to recover MFF in base rates from all customers. 893\n\n\n          Mr. Benedict holds the same opinion. He stated that the Commission's policy to collect MFF\nfrom all customers within a customer class is also consistent with the concept that MFF are system\ncosts that are rightly paid by all customers taking service from the system. He explained that MFF\nare paid by a utility to municipalities for use of the municipalities' rights-of-way. Because these\nrights-of-way are necessary to operate an integrated electric delivery system from which all\ncustomers benefit, regardless of geographic location, Mr. Benedict stated that MFF should be\ncollected uniformly from all customers within a given rate class. He stressed that the Commission\nagreed with this reasoning in Docket No. 16705, where the Commission concluded:\n\n\n          Current cost of services studies are not based on geographical differences. Classes\n          are not divided based on geography, and industrial sites are not self-sufficient islands.\n          The use of city streets and property enables [EGSI] to have an integrated utility\n          system from which all ratepayers benefit. 894\n\n          Mr. Pollock objected to the proposals by Mr. Brazell and Mr. Abbott. He stated that\nMr. Brazell' s recommendation to adopt ETI' s proposed MFF allocation should be rejected because\nthere is no evidence that outside city customers benefit from ETI' s use of city streets and rights-of-\nway or that the benefits are evenly distributed between inside and outside city customers. Further,\naccording to Mr. Pollock, the standard used in class cost-of-service studies is cost causation, not\n\n\n893\n      Cities Ex. 1 (Brazell Direct) at 28-32.\n894\n    OPC Ex. 6 (Benedict Direct) at Ex.

The AUs find persuasive the fact that MFF is compensation for the use of\nmunicipalities rights-of-way, which is used to operate an integrated electric delivery system from\nwhich all customers benefit.\n\n\n          2. Miscellaneous Gross Receipts Taxes\n\n          Miscellaneous gross receipts taxes (MGRT) are state taxes imposed on each utility\ncompany's taxable gross receipts derived from sales in an incorporated city or town having a\npopulation of more than 1,000. Like MFF, these taxes are levied only on sales within the cities. ETI\nproposes to allocate MGRT to all retail customer classes based on customer class revenues relative to\ntotal revenues. 896\n\n\n          TIEC objects to ETI's allocation of MGRT based on class revenues for the same reasons\nstated for ETI' s allocation of MFF. It argues that these costs should be allocated and charged to\ncustomers within the municipalities to which the MGRT applied.\n\n\n          The allocation of MGRT is similar to the allocation ofMFF and should be similarly applied.\nFor the reasons set out above and to ensure consistent treatment, the AU s do not recommend the\ndirect method of allocation suggested by TIEC. Rather, these costs should be allocated to the rate\nclasses according to ETI' s cost of service study.\n\n\n\n\n895\n      TIEC Ex. 3 (Pollock Cross Rebuttal) at 7, 32-33.\n896\n      ETI Ex. 3, Schedule P-13 at 10, line 34.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                  PAGE270\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          3. Capacity-Related Production Costs\n\n                     (a) Allocation Methodology\n\n          ETI proposes to allocate capacity-related production and transmission costs to the retail\nclasses on the basis of A&E 4CP. As noted by TIEC and Commission Staff, this allocation\nmethodology is consistent with the method ETI used in Docket No. 16705, its last contested rate\nproceeding:\n\n\n          Finding of Fact No. 221. The continued use of the A&E 4CP allocator is the most\n          reasonable methodology for allocating production and transmission plant among\n          classes. The A&E 4CP allocator sufficiently recognizes customer demand and\n          energy requirements and assigns cost responsibility to peak and off-peak users. It\n          best recognizes the contribution of both peak demand and the pattern of capacity use\n          through the year.\n\n          Finding of Fact No. 222. The A&E 4CP method is also preferable because it is\n          devoid of any double counting problem. 897\n\n          ETI witness Ms. Talkington explained that the A&E 4CP allocation is appropriate because it\nis a method that reasonably reflects the mix of the Company's customers, their respective electrical\nload characteristics, and the relative costs incurred to serve such loads. She testified that the\nA&E 4CP method provides a reasonable balance between the two primary costing concerns:\ncontribution to the system peak and energy requirements. While the contribution made to the system\npeak is inherently recognized with the use of the average four coincident peaks, energy is also\nrecognized by reflecting the average demands. 898\n\n\n          OPC witness Benedict proposed the use of the average and single coincident peak (A&P)\nmethod to allocated production (and transmission costs, which are discussed in the section below)\n\n\n897\n      Docket No. 16705, Second Order on Rehearing at 97, FoF 221 and 222 (Oct. 14, 1998).\n898\n    ETI Ex. 22 (Talkington Direct) at 5. As noted previously, A&E 4CP is developed by adding each rate\nclass's average demand for the test year (the \"average\" component representing the rate class's average energy\nconsumption), weighted by the ETI system load factor, to each rate class's amount of average coincident peak\ndemand for the months of June through September in excess of its average demand, weighted by one minus the\nETI system load factor.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE271\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\namong retail classes. As noted in the discussion concerning jurisdictional allocation, A&E 4CP is a\nvariant of the A&E allocator. Mr. Benedict believes that A&E 4CP fails to properly assign cost\nresponsibility to both peak and off-peak usage. 899 Instead, he found that the A&E 4CP allocator\nresults in the same factors reached by the 4CP method, which means that A&E 4CP assigns cost\nresponsibility only to peak demand and not to off-peak demand. He believes that the A&P\nmethodology is the proper plant allocator because it takes into account both peak usage and off-peak\nusage patterns. 900\n\n\n            Mr. Benedict's methodology and recommendation was disputed by Kroger witness Higgins.\nHe indicated that the A&E method does not converge to a CP result. Rather, the A&E method\naddresses a fundamentally important question in production cost allocation-once capacity needed to\nserve the average demand on the system is accounted for, how does the regulator fairly assign the\nresponsibility for the additional or excess capacity that is needed to meet the various capacity\nrequirements (placed on the system by each customer class). Mr. Higgins concluded that the A&E\nmethod makes an objective and reasonable allocation. However, he did not advocate changing ETI' s\nuse of A&E 4CP. 901\n\n\n            Mr. Higgins explained that:\n\n\n            [T]he Average and Excess demand method begins by allocating a portion of costs on\n            the basis of average demand-or energy. The remaining (or \"excess\") capacity needs\n            of the system are then allocated to classes based on peak usage--class NCP in the\n            case of the \"standard\" approach, 4 CP in the case of the A&E/4CP method. In\n            contrast, the A&P method proposed by Mr. Benedict, which is classified by the\n            NARUC Manual as a \"Judgmental Energy Weighting\" approach, incorporates a\n            subjective determination that includes the full value of average demand both in the\n            \"average\" component of the A&P calculation as well as in the peak component of\n            that calculation. 902\n\n\n899\n   Mr. Benedict performed a mathematical proof that he believed demonstrated that the A&E 4CP allocator is\nnearly identical to the 4CP allocator.

As noted by ETI, it reasonably\nreflects the mix of the Company's customers and their respective load characteristics and the relative\n\n903\n   TIEC Ex. 3 (Pollock Cross Rebuttal) at 12-14, citing the NARUC Electric Utility Cost Allocation Manual,\nJanuary 1992.\n904\n      OPC Ex. 6 (Benedict Direct) at 25; Kroger Ex. 2 (Higgins Cross Rebuttal) at 5.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                 PAGE273\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ncosts incurred to serve such loads. It recognizes the contribution of both peak demand and the\npattern of capacity use throughout the year. 905 It also recognizes that ETI, like all Texas utilities, is a\nsummer peaking utility. The AU s recommend that ETI' s allocation of capacity production costs be\nadopted.\n\n\n                      (b) Reserve Equalization Payments\n\n          A subset of the Company's requested capacity-related production costs relate to reserve\nequalization payments made by the Company pursuant to the Entergy System Agreement (Service\nSchedule MSS-1 ). The System Agreement, which is approved by the FERC, prescribes a method by\nwhich each Entergy Operating Company's share of Entergy system reserves are calculated. ETI, as\none of the Operating Companies, is responsible to provide the system with its allocated share of\nsystem reserves. Some Entergy Operating Companies own less than their share of system reserves\nand are considered \"short\" with respect to generation capability. Companies that own more than\ntheir share are considered \"long\" companies. Short companies make payments to long companies\npursuant to the terms of the System Agreement. Because ETI is a short company, it makes reserve\n                                                                      906\nequalization payments which are included in the cost of service.\n\n\n          ETI allocates MSS-1 payments using A&E 4CP. Mr. Benedict argues that this allocation\nmethod is not consistent with the way costs are incurred, as ETI does not make MSS-1 payments on\nthe basis of A&E 4CP. According to Mr. Benedict, ETI incurs costs by being short with respect to\nsystem reserves-the payment is simply the number of MW by which it is short, multiplied by a\n$/MW rate as determined by a contract formula. The degree to which ETI is short is determined by\ncomparing its generation capability to its allocated share of system reserves. Total system reserves\nare allocated to the other Operating Companies on the basis of the Responsibility Ratio. Thus, as\n\n\n\n\n905\n      See Docket No. 16705, Second Order on Rehearing at FoF 221 (Sept. 4, 1998).\n906\n      OPC Exhibit No. 6 (Benedict Direct) at 29-30.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE274\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ndetermined by the Responsibility Ratio, ETI's share of system reserves relative to its generating\ncapability is what causes ETI to make MSS-1 Reserve Equalization payments. 907\n\n\n            Mr. Benedict concluded that, because Reserve Equalization payments are incurred on the\nbasis of ETI' s Responsibility Ratio, which is a rolling 12CP allocator, the payments should be\nallocated to ETI' s rate classes on a similar basis. As a result, he recommended that Reserve\nEqualization payments be allocated on the basis of 12CP.908\n\n\n            According to OPC, Mr. Benedict's proposal for allocating MSS-1 payments has been\ncriticized because 12CP measures class demands at ETI's peak monthly demands whereas the\nResponsibility Ratio is measured at the Entergy system's peak monthly demands. OPC agrees that\n12CP uses peak hours that may differ from those used to compute the Responsibility Ratio, but\ncontends that the Company fails to mention that the A&E 4CP method it uses to allocate MSS-1\npayments is also subject to the same critique. When choosing between the 12CP allocator and the\nA&E 4CP allocator for the purpose of allocating reserve equalization payments, OPC believes 12CP\nis more desirable. ETI' s contributions to the Entergy system's peaks in all 12 months, not just the\nfour summer months, determine ETI' s share of Entergy system reserves. ETI' s share of system\nreserves, relative to its generation capability, is what causes reserve equalization payments to the\nother Entergy Operating Companies. Moving to a 12CP allocation for MSS-1 payments aligns cost\nallocation more closely with cost causation.\n\n\n            TIEC witness Pollock explained that the Entergy System Agreement is regulated by the\nFERC, which does not control the rate design policy applicable to Texas retail customers under\nCommission jurisdiction. He views the System Agreement as an accounting mechanism to equalize\nthe benefits and costs associated with interconnected operation and joint planning. In his opinion, it\nis not relevant to determining which production capacity allocation method best reflects cost\ncausation for Texas retail customer. According to Mr. Pollock, the MSS-1 payments are no different\nin concept from the costs associated with ETI' s high-voltage transmission lines, which are allocated\n\n901   Id.\n908\n      Id. at 31.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                         PAGE275\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\non an A&E 4CP basis. He further indicated that the 12CP method ignores the reality the ETI is a\npredominantly summer peaking utility. 909\n\n\n          The ALls do not find sufficient support to allocate the reserve equalization payments\ndifferently than other capacity-related production costs. For the same reasons noted in the section\nabove, the AlJ s find the weight of the evidence supports allocation using A&E 4CP. While 12CP is\na reasonable methodology for jurisdictional separation between retail and wholesale entities, the\nevidence does not support this methodology for allocation of reserve equalization payments.\n\n\n          4. Transmission Costs\n\n          As noted above, ETI also allocates transmission costs using the A&E 4CP methodology.\nAgain, TIEC and Staff cite to the Commission's decision in Docket No. 16705, which adopted the\nA&E 4CP approach for both production and transmission costs. OPC witness Benedict, however,\nproposes allocating transmission plant using A&E methodology that he proposed for the allocation\n                        910\nof production plant.\n\n          TIEC argues that methodologies similar to Mr. Benedict's proposal have been repeatedly\nrejected by the Commission, and the A&E 4CP methodology has been repeatedly approved. TIEC\nsuggests that Mr. Benedict offers no rationale for a different result for transmission costs. According\nto TIEC, the rationale that he offers for using the A&P method for production costs-the potential\ntrade-off between capital costs and fuel costs-is entirely absent with respect to transmission plant.\nMr. Benedict does not even assert that such trade-offs exist. Rather, the only basis he offers for\nusing the average and peak methodology is his assertion that the A&E 4CP allocator \"mathematically\nreduces to a 4CP allocator.\"911 TIEC points out that the Commission, by rule, has adopted the 4CP\nmethod for the allocation of transmission plant within ERCOT. 912\n\n\n\n909\n      TIEC Ex. 3 (Pollock Cross Rebuttal) at 27-29.\n910\n      OPC Ex. 6 (Benedict Direct) at 26-28.\n911\n      TIEC Initial Brief at 68, citing OPC Ex. 6 (Benedict Direct) at 27.\n912\n       P.U.C. SUBST.

Moreover, he\ncompared the different allocation factors-specifically, ETl's proposed A&E 4CP, the A&E, and\nMr. Benedict's recommended A&P. His calculations indicated that A&E 4CP and the A&E produce\n                                                                                     914\nsimilar results, while A&P radically departs from ETI's proposed allocations.\n\n\n          The AUs do not find sufficient or persuasive evidence to change ETI's proposed\nmethodology for allocation of transmission costs. A&E 4CP is a well-accepted method for\nallocating such costs, which the Commission has repeatedly adopted. The AUs recommend the use\nof the A&E 4CP to allocate ETI' s transmission costs.\n\n\nC.        Revenue Allocation\n\n          Wal-Mart, Kroger, TIEC, and Commission Staff advocate that the rates be set on the basis of\nthe utility's costs of service. These parties recommends the adoption of ETis proposed base rate\nrevenue allocation, recovering from each class 100 percent of it respective Test-Year base rate costs\nper the revenue requirement ultimately adopted.\n\n\n          TIEC witness Pollock testified that revenue allocation is the process of determining how any\nbase revenue change approved by the Commission should be spread to each customer class served by\nthe utility. ETI proposed an overall increase in non-fuel revenues of 17 .53 percent, but the increase\nis not spread proportionally to all the classes.915 Rather, ETI proposed class revenue requirements\n\n\n\n\n\"coincident peak demand for the months of June, July, August, and September (4CP) .... \"\n913\n      ETI Ex. 67 (Talkington Rebuttal) at 8-9.\n914\n      Kroger Ex. 2 (Higgins Cross Rebuttal) at 5-6.\n915\n      ETI's revenue requirement does not include the costs associated with its requested REC Rider.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE277\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nthat are closely aligned with the Company's proposed cost of service.

Argument for Moving Rates to Cost\n\n          ETI and the parties in support of ETI' s class revenue allocation contend it is appropriate to\nset rates at each class' cost of service as ETI has proposed in order to avoid continuing inappropriate\nand inequitable cost shifting between customer classes. TIEC witness Mr. Pollock testified that\ncost-based rates send the proper price signals to customers. He noted other reasons for using cost-of-\nservice principles: equity, engineering efficiency (cost-minimization), stability, and conservation. If\nrates are not based on cost, then some customers subsidize part of the cost of providing service to\nother customers. Moreover, he suggested that by providing balanced price signals, cost-based rates\n\n\n\n\n916\n      See Kroger Ex. 1 (Higgins Direct) at 5-6; see also Cities Ex. 6 (Nalepa Dire.ct) at 34.\n\f                                                                                               --------\n\n\n\n\nSOAR DOCKET N O . -                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                      PAGE278\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nencourage conservation and may prevent waste or inefficient use.

In this case, ETI' s proposed\nrevenues for all customer classes result in base revenues that are close to the cost of service allocated\ncosts. No single customer class' proposed revenue requirement differs from ETI' s calculated cost to\nserve that class by more than 3 percent. Staff acknowledges that certain classes face proportionally\nlarger rate increases to bring them closer to unity, where revenue recovery is based on actual cost of\nservice. However, Staff agrees with Mr. Pollock that setting each customer class at their cost of\nservice avoids inflating rates for some customer classes and subsidizing the usage of others. Staff\nbelieves that recovering from each class its respective base rate cost is equitable and provides\nappropriate pricing signals to facilitate the most efficient use of resources in the provision and\nconsumption of electricity. Staff also argues that the Commission has approved such class cost of\nservice allocation in recent rate cases. 920\n\n\n\n\n919\n      Id. at 67.\n920\n   Staff cites Application of CenterPoint Electric Delivery Company, UC for Authority to Change Rates,\nDocket No. 28339, Order at FoF 175 (May 12, 2011) and Docket No. 16705, Second Order on Rehearing at\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE280\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          Wal-Mart and Kroger concur with Staff and TIEC.\n\n\n          2. Argument for Gradualism\n\n          Cities witness Karl Nalepa pointed out that, under ETI' s proposed rates, the Residential and\nLighting customer classes receive the highest rate increases while the Small General Service, General\nService, and Large Industrial Power Service classes receive below system average rate increases of\n1.62 percent, 4.81 percent, and 10.77 percent, respectively. However, he examined Test Year\ncustomer quantities, energy and loads by customer class for each of ETI' s last three cases, and he\nconcluded that residential and lighting customers are not imposing an undue cost burden on the\nsystem. Instead, other classes are growing at a faster rate, causing system costs to increase.\nMoreover, Mr. Nalepa testified that a number of events are occurring with the Entergy system that\nwill have significant impact on costs, including: Entergy' s efforts to join MISO; plans by EAi and\nEMI to leave the Entergy System Agreement; and the possible divestiture of the transmission system\nby all Entergy Operating Companies. Given these uncertainties, Mr. Nalepa proposed that any rate\nincrease or decrease be spread proportionately across the system classes. Then, once Entergy and\nETI address the proposed system cost changes, a reasonable class cost allocation study can be\npresented. 921\n\n\n          State Agencies do not take a position on overall class revenue allocation but request that\nETI' s proposed rate increase for the Lighting class be moderated. ETI proposes to set base rate\nrevenues for the Lighting class based on the class cost allocation study, without any adjustment,\nwhich would result in a 20.38 percent increase to the Lighting class, when the entire ETI system\nwould receive a 15.32 percent increase. Thus, under ETI's proposal, this class would receive a\npercentage increase about 1.33 times the system average. Ms. Pevoto contended that that this\nincrease would be excessive and would create significant rate shock to the class. Because the\n\n\nFoF 245 (Sept. 4, 1998). TIEC witness Pollock also testified that Commission precedent supports allocation of\ncosts based on the cost of service study. He also cited to the CenterPoint case and to Application ofAEP Texas\nCentral for Authority to Change Rates, Docket No. 28840, Order at 50 (Aug. 15, 2005).

Pevoto believes it\nwould be reasonable to mitigate the rate shock so that lighting customers can afford to continue their\nlighting service. Otherwise, she suggested, some lighting customers may reduce lighting services or\nrefrain from ordering additional lights. This, in tum, would adversely affect the benefits that lighting\nservice provides to the public. 922\n\n\n          Ms. Pevoto also pointed out that in 2009, the Commission adopted a rate moderation\nproposal for a similar rate class served by another utility. In that case, the Commission recognized\nthat the Lighting class was unique in the combination of the public good it performs and in its\ndemand characteristics. 923 To mitigate the rate shock on the lighting customers in the present case,\nMs. Pevoto recommended a cap on any base rate increase that would be equal to the smaller of:\n(1) the lighting class percentage rate increase resulting from the PUC-approved cost of service\nallocation study, or (2) the allowed system percentage rate increase. If the percentage rate increase is\nsmaller than the allowed system percentage rate increase, then no mitigation adjustment would be\nnecessary. However, if the PUC-approved cost of service allocation results in a percentage base rate\nincrease for the lighting class that is greater than the allowed system percentage increase, then she\nurged that a mitigation reduction should occur. She also proposed that any mitigation reduction for\nthe lighting class should be spread to other remaining classes, based on each class' cost of service. 924\n\n\n          ETI argues that the State Agencies are proposing the continuation of a significant subsidy by\nother classes. The Company notes that its allocation of costs to the Lighting class is based on the\nrevenue requirement developed for that class. ETI acknowledges that its proposed increase for the\nLighting class is 20.38 percent greater than the system average increase, but it is less than the\nResidential class's proposed increase of21.64 percent.

She testified that previous rate cases\nwith subsidies for the Lighting class have pushed the class farther away from cost. 925\n\n\n          OPC argues that cost of service should not be the sole factor in setting rates and that\ngradualism should be used in appropriate circumstances. OPC witness Benedict disagreed with\nMr. Pollock's (and Staff's) citation to the CenterPoint andAEPTCC rate cases to reject the concept\nof gradualism because both CenterPoint and TCC are unbundled transmission and distribution\n(T&D) utilities whose charges had a small impact on retail customers' total bill. He noted that the\nnumber runs for TCC and CenterPoint showed retail revenue increases of only 0.14 percent and\n1.30 percent, respectively, with some classes receiving rate decreases. 926 Mr. Benedict cited the\nfollowing language by the Commission in its Order for the TCC case:\n\n\n          The Commission declines to adopt gradualism in this case. This proceeding develops\n          the T&D rates, as opposed to the broader rates developed for a fully integrated utility.\n          As the T&D rates are only a subset of the total rates paid by customers, changes to\n          the T&D rates would not have as large an impact as they would if the broader rates\n          for a customer class were changed by the same percentage.... 927\n\nIn Mr. Benedict's opinion, gradualism should be employed when setting rates for ETI because ETI is\nan integrated utility and has proposed a large rate increase. 928\n\n\n          Mr. Benedict also emphasized the imprecise nature of a cost of service study. He noted that\nETI's cost of service study had 47 allocation factors and, even at the summary level, 22 expense\ncategories and 24 rate base categories. 929 Thus, he stated, there are a host of decisions made by the\ncost of service analyst which, in combination with the various account entries, yield a class' reported\ncost of service.

Thus, while the cost of service study is\n                                                                                                        931\nan important element of ratemaking, Mr. Benedict stressed that it is not the only consideration.\n\n\n          Due to the wide variation of rate increases obtained from ETI' s cost of service study,\nMr. Benedict thought that rate moderation (gradualism) would be appropriate. However, he added,\nuntil decisions are made regarding the cost disallowances and allocation modifications proposed by\nthe parties, it is unclear which rate classes should be granted rate moderation and the degree to which\nrate moderation is needed. Mr. Benedict said that the system average rate increase should be used as\na benchmark for rate moderation, but not assigned uniformly to all classes as Mr. Nalepa proposed or\nto just one class as Ms. Pevoto suggested. Instead, he believed it would be reasonable to establish a\nfloor and a ceiling for the increases in revenue from each class, such that a class' individual\npercentage increase in revenue requirement is within a defined range of the system's average revenue\nincrease. Therefore, Mr. Benedict recommended that any rate increase for a particular class be\nrestricted to a range of 0.75 to 1.25 times the system's average increase. This would result in rate\nincreases up to 25 percent lower or 25 percent higher than the average rate increase for the system as\na whole. Based on a system average increase of 17.53 percent, individual class increases would\nrange from 13.15 percent to 21.91 percent under Mr. Benedict's proposal. 932\n\n\n          3. ALJs' Recommendation\n\n          The parties presented persuasive argument on both sides of the issue. Clearly, in any rate\ncase, movement toward unity-setting rates to cost-is appropriate when such movement does not\nresult in rate shock to a particular class or classes. If rate shock is likely, Commission precedent\n\n930\n    He noted, for example, that his direct testimony and Mr. Nalepa' s direct testimony proposed a different\nallocation methodology for production-related capacity costs, transmission costs, and certain System\nAgreement costs. Mr. Pollock proposed a different allocation method for municipal franchise fees and local\ngross receipts taxes. Mr. Abbott recommended different allocation methods for municipal franchise fees and\nother franchise taxes.\n931\n      OPC Ex. 8 (Benedict Cross Rebuttal) at 14-17.\n932\n      OPC Ex. 8 (Benedict Cross Rebuttal) at 17-19.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                              PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                   PAGE284\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nsupports the use of gradualism. These policies apply to both a fully integrated utility, as well as a\nT&D. The salient issue is whether the utility's proposed increase is so out of proportion or harsh to a\nparticular class that some form of gradualism should be applied. In this rate case, the preponderance\nof the evidence does not support the use of gradualism, even for the Lighting class. While that class\nmay receive an increase almost 1.33 times the system average increase, Commission precedent\nindicated an appropriate ceiling of 1.5 or even 1.75 times the system average is appropriate. 933 As to\napplying OPC's proposed floor and ceiling approach, this method was introduced in cross-rebuttal\nwith no calculations depicting the impact on each class. The A1J s do not recommend its adoption\nbecause it fails to offer significant movement towards class responsibility for cost of service. The\nA1J s do not recommend Mr. Nalepa' s suggestion to impose any revenue change on an equal percent\nbasis because it offers no movement towards unity. Accordingly, the A1J s concur with the parties\nsupporting ETI that revenue allocation in this case should be based on each class's cost of service\nand consistent with the AU s' recommendations in the PFD that impact revenue allocation.\n\n\nD.        Rate Design [Germane to Preliminary Order Issue Nos. 15, 18, and 20]\n\n          Staff explained that the Commission has traditionally established class costs of service based\non the principle of cost causation.         Staff believes the Commission has consistently required\nsubstantial justification for departing from this principle when setting rates that result in\ncross-subsidization between customer classes. With respect to intra-class cost causation and rate\ndesign, Staff maintains that the considerations are somewhat different. Rather, the Commission has\ntraditionally given more weight to policy considerations other than cost causation in determining\nintra-class rate design issues because the danger of permanent subsidies within a particular class is\nrelatively low. 934 For instance, Staff witness Abbott testified that customer usage within a class may\nvary throughout the year. He noted that a low-load-factor customer might become a high-load-factor\n\n\n\n\n933\n      See Docket No. 28840, Order at 23 (rejecting ALJs' proposed ceiling of 1.75 times the system average).\n934\n    Staff cites to Mr. Abbott's cross-examination at Tr. at 1818 (\"Q: And is there a distinction between factors\nthat you would consider such as costs or other factors when you're discussing class allocation as opposed to\nrate design issues? A: I would say there are different considerations and weights to considerations and the\nanalysis of allocating costs to classes versus the analysis of allocating costs to rates within a class.\").\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE285\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ncustomer, resulting in a different mix of charges throughout the year. 935 While an individual\ncustomer's usage characteristics might frequently change and thereby lessen the impact of cost\nshifting within a class, Mr. Abbott testified that such customers were unlikely to shift to a different\ncustomer class. 936 While subsidies in the customer class allocation context might be permanent, this\nwas not necessarily the case for intra-class rates. Moreover, these shifting usage characteristics make\nit more difficult to identify cost drivers within a rate class. Staff suggests that consideration be given\nto policies such as customer impact and energy efficiency.\n\n\n            The ALls agree with Stafrs analysis. Mr. Abbott recommended that the Commission apply\ngradualism-limiting the magnitude of rate changes-to help stabilize customer expectations and\nreduce risk. 937 ETI witness Talkington also advised caution in response to suggested changes to\nETI's proposed rate design, noting that the ultimate impact on a customer's bill is important. 938\nHowever, the ALJ s' rate design recommendations are based on the evidence and argument for each\ncustomer class or rate schedule. Thus, the ALJ s' recommendation on the specific rates or charges for\nthe industrial customers will impact all other customer classes but that impact is not known at this\ntime.\n\n\n            1. Lighting and Traffic Signal Schedules\n\n            Cities witness Dennis W. Goins explained ETI's Lighting and Traffic Signal Schedules.\nETI' s principal rate schedule for street lighting customers is Schedule SHL (Street and Highway\nLighting Service), while Schedule TSS (Traffic Signal Services) is the principal rate schedule for\nETI' s traffic lighting customers that own and maintain their lighting facilities. For Schedule SHL,\nthe rate includes four categories of service (Rate Groups A, C, D, and E). Rate Group A includes\nETI' s standard fixture and lamps mounted on existing standard wood poles that ETI installs and\nmaintains. If a customer wants nonstandard lighting facilities (those not provided in Rate Group A),\n\n\n935\n      Tr. at 1818.\n936   Id.\n937\n      Staff Ex. 7 (Abbott Direct) at 25-26.\n938\n      ETI Ex. 67 (Talkington Rebuttal) at 16.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE286\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nthe customer is assigned to Rate Group C and required to prepay ETI for the incremental cost of the\nnonstandard facilities. Lighting facilities that are customer-owned and customer-maintained are\nassigned to Rate Group D, while incidental lighting services (for example, underpass lighting) are\nassigned to Rate Group E. Customers in Rate Groups A and C pay a fixed monthly charge per\nlighting fixture, while customers in Rate Groups D and E pay a fixed (and identical) energy charge\nper kWh.           Each customer's monthly bill also includes charges for ETI's fixed fuel factor\n(Schedule FF) and applicable riders applied to monthly kWh per fixture. Under Schedule TSS,\ntraffic signal customers are subject to a minimum monthly charge ($3.20 proposed) per point of\ndelivery, plus a fixed kWh rate and all applicable rider charges. 939\n\n\n           Cities request that the Commission require ETI to institute a discounted lighting rate for\nLight Emitting Diode (LED) installations. Mr. Goins testified that the basic structure and pricing\nprovisions of the SHL and TSS rates were designed for lighting fixtures that use older, less\nenergy-efficient bulb technology, and ETI did not conduct any analyses to estimate the cost\ndifferential of serving street lighting and traffic signal customers that use energy-efficient LED\nfixtures. In fact, Dr. Goins noted that the basic structure and pricing provisions of the SHL and TSS\nrates have been place for years. 940\n\n\n           In Dr. Goins' opinion, adoption of LED lighting rates would help reduce energy consumption\nin Texas because such rates help offset the high front-end cost of LED lights and encourage\nmunicipalities to adopt energy-efficient LED options. In 2010, the Commission approved a street\nand traffic signal rate for El Paso Electric Company that included separate charges for LED traffic\nsignals. 941 In that case, the fixed monthly rate for LED signals was generally less than one-third the\ncomparable rate for incandescent signals.\n\n\n\n\n939\n      Cities Ex. 4 (Goins Direct) at 22-23.\n940\n      Id. at 23.\n941\n   Application of El Paso Electric Company to Change Rates, to Reconcile Fuel Costs, to Establish Formula-\nBased Fuel Factors, and to Establish an Energy Efficiency Cost Recovery Factor, Docket No. 37690 (July 30,\n2010).\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                              PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE287\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n            Dr. Goins recommended that the Commission require ETI to modify monthly fixed charges\nin Schedule SHL (Rate Groups A and C) and the monthly minimum charge in Schedule TSS to\nreflect a 25 percent discount for LED installations. Under his proposal, the discounted Rate Group A\nfixed charges (if applicable) in Schedule SHL would be applied according to the estimated monthly\nkWh consumption of the installed LED fixture. In addition, he recommended reducing by 25 percent\nthe Schedule SHL kWh charges applicable to LED customers assigned to Rate Groups D and E to\nreflect the lower cost of operating and maintaining LED fixtures. And he added that, in the future,\nETI should be required to provide detailed information regarding differences in the cost of serving\nLED and non-LED lighting customers. 942\n\n\n            Dr. Goins also requested that the Commission require ETI to eliminate the service condition\napplicable to Rate Groups A and C in Schedule SHL that charges a $50 fee for any replacement of a\nfunctioning light with a lower-wattage bulb. He stated that this fee actively discourages customers\nfrom adopting more energy-efficient lighting technologies (for example, LED devices), and was not\nsupported in ETI's filing.          In Dr. Goins' view, this barrier to conservation and efficiency\nimprovements should be eliminated. 943\n\n\n            Staff disagrees with Cities' request that ETI institute a discounted lighting rate for LED\ninstallations. Mr. Abbott testified that Cities did not provide empirical cost data to support this\nrequest. Without data on which to base an LED installation discount, he recommended that the\nCommission not require ETI to provide such a discount at this time. However, because of the\ngrowing use of LED installations and the potential cost savings to be realized from these\ninstallations, Mr. Abbott did recommend that the Commission require ETI to perform a cost study to\ndetermine appropriate cost-based rates for LED installations. This cost study could be used to\ndevelop LED lighting rates, which Mr. Abbott recommended ETI be required to submit as part of its\nnext base-rate case. 944\n\n\n\n942\n      Cities Ex. 4 (Goins Direct) 22-26.\n943   Id.\n944\n      Staff Ex. 7 (Abbott Direct) at 28.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE288\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          ETI is willing to perform a study to determine the feasibility of implementing LED lighting\nrates as part of its next base rate case filing. ETI witness Talkington explained that the Company\ndoes not currently offer ETI-owned LED lights but may do so in the future. She stated that if a\ncustomer wishes to use LED technology, it can install LE fixtures and receive service under\nSchedule SHL, Rate Groups D and E, or the existing Schedule TSS. 945\n\n\n          Ms. Talkington took issue with Dr. Goins' proposed 25 percent decrease in Schedule SHL\n(Rate Groups A and C) and Schedule TSS for an LED option because the 25 percent rate reduction\nwas not calculated. Thus, ETI prefers that it propose rates after a cost study. Ms. Talkington also\ndisagreed with Dr. Goins' proposal for a 25 percent decrease in the energy-only options under\nSchedule SHL, Rate Groups D and E or Schedule TSS for customer-owned lights. She believes that\na customer will have the benefit of more efficient LED lights by the reduction in energy\nconsumed. 946\n\n\n          The AUs find persuasive Dr. Goins' testimony that: (1) the cost of street and traffic lighting\nservices can be significant for many cities and towns; (2) government agencies face increasing\npressure to control budgets and energy-efficient lighting is a good option; (3) LED fixtures use\nsignificantly less energy than incandescent and most other light options, last longer, and may require\nless maintenance; and (4) LED lighting rates would encourage municipalities to adopt\nenergy-efficient LED options and help offset the high front-end cost of LED lights. 947 However, the\nAUs concur with ETI and Staff that ETI should be directed to perform a LED lighting cost study\nbefore extensive changes are made to its lighting rates. The AU s further recommend that ETI\nconduct this study before filing its next rate case and provide the results of any completed study to\nCities and interested parties as soon as practicable but no later than the filing of its next rate case, as\nrequested by Cities. Further, the AUs recommend that the study include detailed information\nregarding differences in the cost of serving LED and non-LED lighting customers, if ETI has LED\nlighting customers taking service at the time it conducts its study. Finally, the AUs note that ETI\n\n945\n      ETI Ex. 67 (Talkington Rebuttal) at 17.\n946\n      Id. at 17-18.\n947\n      Cities Ex. 4 (Goins Direct) at 24-25.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                   PAGE289\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ndid not dispute Dr. Goins' suggestion to eliminate the service condition for Rate Groups A and C in\nSchedule SHL that charges a $50 fee for any replacement of a functioning light with a lower-wattage\nbulb. As noted by Dr. Goins, this fee discourages customers from adopting more energy-efficient\nlighting (such as LED devises). The Al.Js concur and recommend that ETI modify the applicable\ntariffs to eliminate this fee for any replacement of a functioning light with a lower-wattage bulb.\n\n\n          2. Demand Ratchet\n\n          Staff witness Abbott testified that a demand ratchet is a provision in a utility's tariff that\nallows it to bill a customer based upon on the greater of either demand by that customer in the\ncurrent month, or some fixed percentage of the customer's demand occurring during previous\nmonths. The Commission approved a settlement in Docket No. 37744, ETI's last base rate case, in\nwhich, among other things, ETI agreed to eliminate all life-of-contract demand ratchets from its\ntariffs for new customers with the implementation of rates. ETI further agreed that, in its next rate\ncase, it would eliminate the life-of-contract ratchet for existing customers. 948 The Docket No. 37744\nstipulation stated:\n\n\n          Life-of-Contract Demand Ratchet. The Signatories agree that the life-of-contract\n          demand ratchet provision in Rate Schedules Large fudustrial Power Service [LIPS],\n          Large fudustrial Power Service-Time of Day [LIPS-TOD], General Service [GS],\n          General Service-Time of Day [GS-TOD], Large General Service [LGS ], and Large\n          General Service-Time of Day [LGS-TOD] shall be excluded from the rate schedules\n          in ETI's next rate case. The Signatories further stipulate that the foregoing rate\n          schedules will be revised so that the life-of-contract demand ratchet provision shall\n          not be applicable to new customers and, for existing customers, shall not exceed the\n          level in effect on August 15, 2010. 949\n\n          ETI then filed compliance tariffs in Docket No. 37744, which implemented the first part of\nthe settlement by excluding new customers from its proposed life-of-contract demand ratchet.

ETI maintains the new language is not a\nlife-of-contract ratchet. Commission Staff, TIEC, and DOE disagree. Stated simply, Department of\nEnergy (DOE) witness Dwight D. Etheridge testified that the introduction of the term \"kW specified\nin the currently effective contract\" transforms what was a 12-month ratchet into a life-of-contract\nratchet. 952\n\n\n          At the outset, the AUs note that some of ETI's proposed tariffs do comply with the\nstipulation in the prior case. ETI eliminated the life-of-contract provisions for the GS and GS-ToD\ncustomer classes. However, ETI' s new language for the remaining ratchet classes, according to Staff\nwitness Mr. Abbott, has the effect of maintaining a slightly different type oflife-of-contract demand\nratchet. 953 The discussion in this section applies to the LIPS class but the same argument follows for\nLGS and GS classes.\n\n\n          The parties contesting ETI' s demand ratchet language argue that: ( 1) ETI' s compliance tariff\nin Docket No. 37744 was consistent with the parties' agreement; (2) ETI' s proposal imposes a life-\nof-contract demand ratchet; (3) the service agreement and tariff are linked; and (4) the new demand\nratchet is not equitable or cost-based. These arguments are set out below.\n\n\n\n951\n    ETI 67 (Talkington Direct) at Ex. MLT-R-4 at 15 (emphasis added). ETI changed the relevant language in\nits tariff in its rebuttal testimony. Thus, the testimony of Messrs. Etheridge and Abbott can be slightly\nconfusing because these witnesses address the tariff initially proposed by ETI.\n952\n      DOE Ex. l (Etheridge Direct) at 11.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE292\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n               >     The agreed tariff from Docket No. 37744 was consistent with the parties'\n                     agreement and shows how UPS billing load should be calculated.\n\n          Staff, TIEC, and DOE agree that when ETI filed the compliance tariff in Docket No. 37744,\nthe only demand ratchet that remained in the LIPS tariff for ETI' s new customers was a 12-month\ndemand ratchet. ETI removed the life-of-contract ratchet that set a perpetual obligation for a\ncustomer to pay for power based on its highest contract power or a percentage of its contract power.\nStaff, DOE, and TIEC argue that ETI' s action in removing those provisions was consistent with the\nagreement and is evidence of what ETI should have done in this case. They contend that ETI witness\nMs. Talkington agreed that the settlement eliminated both the highest load established under the\ncurrently effective contract and the amount specified in the contract.954              in other words, the\ncompliance tariff tracked the agreement.\n\n\n          ETI does not directly respond to this argument: Ms. Talkington did not address this in her\nrebuttal testimony. However, ETI states that the AI.Js should \"not be distracted by ETI's initial error\nof unintentionally removing the contracted capacity provision as to new customers in its compliance\ntariffs in Docket No. 37744.\"955 Apparently, ETI believes that the tariffs it filed in compliance with\nthe Docket No. 37744 agreement were in error.\n\n\n               >     ETI proposes a demand ratchet in this case that is based on the contracted quantity\n                     stated in the tariff-required service agreement.\n\n          All parties agree that what ETI proposes in this docket is different from the Docket\nNo. 37744 tariff, as evidenced by Ms. Talkington:\n\n\n          Q:         So last time, when the company and the parties implemented the elimination\n                     of the life-of-contract ratchet, it eliminated the 60 percent ratchet applicable\n                     to both actual demand during the contract period or the contract - the amount\n                     specified in the contract.\n          A.

What we have in this case is that the life-of-contract power relates to\n                     the highest load established under the currently effective contract ... 956\n\n\n          According to ETI, its proposed language does not impose life-of-contract ratchet, as defined\nby Mr. Pollock in Docket No. 37744 or by Messrs.

But the contracted quantity provision it proposes is a\nminimum kW amount contractually agreed between the two parties to the service agreement, which\nis a required contract between the customer and ETI. 960 ETI argues the provision is not set by actual\nevents during the term of the contract or in a prior period of the term of the contract, or in a monthly\nor 30-minute time period within the term of the contract; rather, it is set in the contract:\n\n956\n      Tr. at 1432-1433 (emphasis added).\n957\n      DOE Ex. 3 (Docket No. 37744 testimony excerpt) at 5-6.\n958\n      Tr. at 2004.\n959\n      Tr. at 1817.\n960\n   Mr. Etheridge testified that customers taking service under Schedule LIPS must sign a contract for service.\nTr. at 1991.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE294\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          That contracted quantity is set as, to use Mr. Etheridge's words, \"an estimate\" that\n          cannot be unilaterally changed by the Company; instead, a change to that kW amount\n          could only be made through negotiation between the two parties or through a\n          proceeding before the Commission. To use Mr. Pollock's definition, it is not a\n          demand \"imposed by the customer during the term of the contract.\" It is instead a\n          fixed, contractually agreed to amount that is set as a condition of service prior to the\n          contract term. 961\n\n          In sum, ETI argues the provision in question are not life-of-contract ratchets that lock the\ncustomer into the highest demand ever imposed by the customer's actual load during the term of the\ncontract. Rather, they are, at most, 12-month ratchets that set the billing demand over a 12-month\nperiod, but not the life of the contract, at 7 5 percent.\n\n\n          Staff suggests that the Commission does not, fortunately, have to determine what contract\nprovision may or may not constitute a life-of-contract demand ratchet. Rather, the Commission must\nensure that ETI fulfilled its obligations under the Docket No. 37744 settlement. Staff believes that\nthe parties to that settlement understood the meaning of the life-of-contract term, ETI followed\nthrough with compliance tariffs that evidenced its understanding, and now ETI should be required to\nstick with its agreement.\n\n\n               )- The service agreement and tariff are linked.\n\n          According to TIEC, ETI tries to make the argument that its proposal is justified because ETI\nand its large customers may sign an agreement for service that specifies a customer's contract power.\nThis does not justify ETI' s proposal because ETI' s form \"Agreement for Electric Service\" expressly\nstates that the agreement is subject to the terms of \"applicable rate schedules.\"962 Thus, maintains\nTIEC, the LIPS tariff billing load provisions impact a customer's contract power and can reasonably\nreduce a customer's billing load below its contract power if the customer has a reduction in load\nlasting longer than 12 months.\n\n\n\n\n961\n      ETI Initial Brief at 211 (footnotes omitted), citing Tr. at 1994, 2012.\n962\n      ETI Ex. 3, Schedule Q 8.8 at l 1.1.\n\f                                                                               ~~-~·-----------\n\n\n\n\nSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE295\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          ETI' s proposal should be rejected, argues TIEC, because it would allow the utility to\nindefinitely seek revenue from a customer that has nothing to do with the customer's actual usage or\nthe utility's costs. For example, if a plant took 150 MW of load in its heyday, under ETI' s proposal,\nthe plant would be obligated to pay demand charges based on 60 percent of its original contract\npower. This is because ETI' s standard agreement requires the utility's \"express approval\" to set a\nnew contract power and the utility therefore could choose not to negotiate (or negotiate in a timely\nmanner) a new contract power. 963 If LIPS billing load is tied to contract power, then its customers\nwould be completely at its mercy to negotiate a reasonable contract power based on the customer's\nactual usage for the time period. TIEC contends this is a ridiculous result and would render the\nparties' agreement to eliminate the life-of-contract ratchet meaningless.\n\n\n              >    ETI's new demand ratchet is not equitable or cost-based.\n\n          TIEC does not dispute that a 12-month ratchet is reasonable. However, Mr. Pollock, in\nDocket No. 37744, explained why a perpetual obligation to pay demand costs for load that the utility\ndoes not serve is objectionable:\n\n\n          While it is appropriate to require customers to pay for the facilities they use, a\n          perpetual obligation is both extreme and unnecessary. Typical demand ratchets reach\n          back twelve months. A life-of-contract ratchet can reach back decades. This is\n          particularly inappropriate when longstanding customers have permanently reduced\n          operations. A customer that has reduced operations is not purchasing the same level\n          of generation and transmission services as in the past, nor is ETI procuring the same\n          level of generation and transmission services for the customer. Further, because of\n          load growth on the ETI system, the capacity no longer being used by the customer\n          would be used by other customers. Thus, a life-of-contract ratchet does not properly\n          reflect cost-causation. 964\n\n              >    Witness Recommendations.\n\n          Staff witness Mr. Abbott recommended that ETI be required to eliminate from its LGS,\nLGS-ToD, LIPS, and LIP-ToD tariffs the language that results in a ratchet based upon the current\n\n\n963\n      ETI Ex. 3, Schedule Q 8.8 at 11.2.\n964\n      DOE Ex. 3.\n\fSOAR DOCKET N O . -                             PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE296\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\neffective contract-specific demand.                Also, if the Commission approves Mr. Abbott's\nrecommendation, he stated that the billing determinants used to calculate the rates for the affected\ncustomer classes will likely change. Therefore, ETI should be required to update the affected billing\ndeterminants and reflect the resulting change in its rates in the compliance filing of this docket.965\n\n\n          DOE witness Etheridge also recommends that same for the LIPS tariff. He specified\nlanguage that will exclude the life-of-contract ratchet language and retain the existing rolling\n12-month ratchet language in Schedule LIPS. 966 Specifically, he proposed the following:\n\n\n          VI.

ETI failed to explain how the\ncompliance tariffs adopted in Docket No. 37744 were in error. ETI' s argument that its new language\nis not a life-of-contract demand ratchet was unpersuasive. To justify its modification, ETI relied\n\n\n965\n      Staff Ex. 7 (Abbott Direct) at 20.\n966\n      ETI can adopt similar language for its LGS, LGS-ToD, LIPS, and LIP-ToD tariffs.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                         PAGE297\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nonly on a portion of Mr. Pollock's Docket No. 37744 definition. Moreover, both Messrs. Abbott and\nEtheridge were unequivocal that ETI, contrary to its agreement in the previous rate case, is imposing\na life-of-contract or perpetual obligation to pay. Finally, the weight of the evidence supports a\nfinding that the demand ratchet ETI proposes in this case is not equitable or cost based. The ALls\nrecommend that ETI' s proposed LIPS tariff be amended to include the language proposed by\nMr. Etheridge. The ALls concur with Mr. Etheridge that, with such language, ETI has a financial\nincentive to negotiate the maximum possible contracted level of capacity, not the minimum, and the\nresult is consistent with the Docket No. 37744 agreement.\n\n\n          3. Large Industrial Power Service (LIPS)\n\n          TIEC witness Pollock explained that Schedule LIPS recovers base rates through a seasonally\nadjusted demand charge (per kW) and a two-step non-fuel energy charge (per kWh). The demand\ncharges are also adjusted (either up or down) to reflect the differences in costs by delivery voltage.\nETI' s existing LIPS schedule has no customer charge. In its initial filing, ETI removed all purchased\npower capacity costs from base rates and proposed recovering them through a PPR as a demand\ncharge. When it did so, the proposed demand charges were increased, but the proposed non-fuel\nenergy charges were substantially reduced. Following the Supplemental Preliminary Order, which\nremoved the PPR from further consideration, ETI proposed to roll these costs back into base rates.\nThe resulting rebundled demand and energy charges would increase by about the same percentage.967\n\n\n          Mr. Pollock testified that the proposed structure of Schedule LIPS does not track costs as\nderived in ETI's class cost-of-service study. Specifically, he complained: (1) there is no customer\ncharge, despite the fact that the customer costs allocated to the LIPS class would translate into a\nmonthly rate of over $6,000, and (2) the proposed non-fuel energy charges would recover a\nsignificant amount of demand related costs. According to Mr. Pollock, production/transmission\ndemand-related costs are $8.47 per kW, and distribution costs add another $0.99 per kW, for a total\nof $9.46 per kW. The proposed LIPS demand charges are $7.07 per kW for transmission delivery\nand an additional $1.82 for distribution service, for a total of $8.89 per kW. Thus, in Mr. Pollock's\n\n967\n      TIEC Ex. L (Pollock Direct) at 68-69.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                          PAGE298\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nopinion, the proposed demand charges (given ETI's requested rate increase) are too low. By\ncontrast, he noted, non-fuel energy costs are about 0.226¢ per kWh, while the proposed non-fuel\nenergy charges would average over 0.600¢. Thus, these charges are 2.5 times higher than the\nnon-fuel energy costs based on ETI's filing. 968\n\n\n                       (a) A New Customer Charge\n\n           TIEC urged that any increase in Schedule LIPS should be used to create a customer charge.\nMr. Pollock calculated that a cost-based customer charge should be about $6,050 per month, and he\nrecommended an initial customer charge of $6,000 per month. This would collect approximately\n$5.9 million ($6,000 x 984 bills). He added that any remaining increase not accounted for by the\ninitial customer charge should be collected in the demand charges. He also stated that the non-fuel\nenergy charges should not be changed unless the LIPS class is allocated less than a $5.9 million\nincrease. In that event, he recommended that the non-fuel energy charges should be decreased. This\nwould gradually correct the imbalance between the below-cost demand charges and above-cost\nenergy charges. Mr. Pollock further stated that the delivery voltage adjustment applicable to\ndistribution service should be retained so that the rate better reflects the cost. Should the LIPS class\nnot receive an increase or if base rates are decreased, Mr. Pollock recommended that the customer\ncharge should be reduced proportionally. Any remaining revenue surplus should be applied to\nreduce the non-fuel energy charges to cost and then to reduce the demand charges. 969\n\n\n           Staff witness Abbott also recommends the introduction of a customer charge, but a much\nsmaller one than that recommended by Mr. Pollock- $630. 970\n\n\n           DOE supports Staff's proposed $630 customer charge. DOE witness Etheridge testified that\nTIEC' s proposed $6,000 customer charge far exceeds a reasonable initial customer charge for\nSchedule LIPS. For example, the existing Commission-approved monthly customer charge for\n\n\n968\n      TIEC Ex. I (Pollock Direct) at 69-70.\n969\n      Id. at 70.\n970\n      Staff Ex. 7 (Abbott Direct) at 27.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE299\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nSchedule LGS is $425.05. Mr. Etheridge stated that the introduction of a $6,000 customer charge\nwill lead to large shifts in intra-class revenue responsibility from high load factor customers to low\nload factor customers because a customer charge does not vary with usage. He noted, as an example,\nthat TIEC's proposal would increase DOE's Big Hill annual costs by $72,000 or nearly 10 percent.\nMoreover, Mr. Etheridge pointed out that two parties are proposing to lower the Schedule LGS\ncustomer charge-approving either of these recommendations and TIEC' s would levy\nSchedule LIPS customers with a new customer charge that is over 23 times the level of the LGS\nclass. He believes such inconsistencies are inexplicable. Additionally, such disparity would present\n                                                                          971\na challenge to any customer migrating from the LGS to the LIPS class.\n\n\n          DOE witness Etheridge agreed that is appropriate to move toward cost-based rates, however,\nhe indicated that gradualism should be properly applied to move rates toward cost without undue\nimpact on low usage and low load factor customers in the LIPS class. If a new customer charge for\nthe LIPS class is to be imposed-it should be that recommended by Commission Staff. 972\n\n\n          The Al.J s are persuaded by Mr. Etheridge' s testimony that the adoption of a $6,000 customer\ncharge far exceeds ETI' s existing customer charge in the LGS Schedule and results in a significant\nand inappropriate impact to low load factor customers. Rather, Mr. Abbott's proposed customer\ncharge of $630 is an appropriate charge to this customer class, particularly as ETI' s current rates\napplicable to LIPS customers do not include any customer charge. 973\n\n\n                       (b)          Demand and Energy Charges\n\n          In an effort to move more towards cost-based rates, Mr. Abbott recommends a slight decrease\n                                                                                       974\nin the LIPS energy charges and an increase in the demand charges from current rates.         Mr. Pollock\ndoes not recommend an increase in energy charges. However, he recommends increasing demand\n\n\n971\n      DOE Ex. 2 (Etheridge Cross-Rebuttal) at 3-4.\n972\n      DOE Ex. 2 (Etheridge Cross-Rebuttal) at 5.\n973\n      TIEC Ex. 1 (Pollock Direct) at 70.\n974\n      Staff Ex. 7 (Abbott Direct) at 27.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                         PAGE300\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ncharges to cover any remaining revenue increase for the LIPS class that is not accounted for with the\ncustomer charge. He suggested that such a change will gradually correct the imbalance between the\nbelow-cost demand charges and above-cost energy charges. 975\n\n\n          DOE witness Etheridge expressed concerns with both proposals.              He stated that\nSchedule LIPS customers are, on average, substantially more energy intensive than customers taking\nservice under Schedule LIPS-TOD customers. He indicated that TIEC's proposed rate design (with\nthe $6,000 customer charge) would double the cost increase associated with base rates and the fuel\nfactor for LIPS-TOD customers compared with the average cost increase for the class as a whole.\nCustomers with lower load factors than Schedule LIPS-TOD customers would fare even worse. 976\n\n\n          Mr. Etheridge also was concerned about Staffs proposed charges, noting that Mr. Abbott\nfailed to explain how the slight decrease in the LIPS energy charge and the large increase in the\ndemand charge would affect customers with changes in the revenue requirement ultimately assigned\nto the class. Mr. Etheridge stated that even Staffs proposed changes will noticeably shift intra-class\ncost responsibility toward Schedule LIPS customers with relatively low load factors. To address his\nconcern that changes in the revenue requirement may have a significant impact even with Staffs\ngradual movement in rates, Mr. Etheridge recommended that Staffs proposal should set the limit on\nintra-class cost responsibility shifts. 977\n\n\n          The ALls find evidentiary support for and recommend the adoption of Mr. Abbott's proposed\nchanges to Schedule LIPS. There is sufficient evidence, based on Mr. Pollock's testimony, that\nMr. Abbott's suggested changes gradually move the rates towards cost without the risk of rate shock.\nTIEC' s demand and energy proposals result in unreasonable large shifts in intra-class revenue\nresponsibility. However, the ALls also agree with Mr. Etheridge that Staffs proposal may need to\nbe adjusted depending on the ultimate revenue requirement adopted.\n\n\n\n975\n      TIEC Ex. 1 (Pollock Direct) at 70.\n976\n      DOE Ex. 2 (Etheridge Cross-Rebuttal) at 5.\n977\n      DOE Ex. 2 (Etheridge Cross-Rebuttal) at 5.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE301\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          4. Schedulable Intermittent Pumping Service (SIPS)\n\n          DOE proposes that a new rider, Schedulable Intermittent Pumping Service (SIPS), be\nincluded in the LIPS tariff. This will allow DOE and other customers with intermittent pumping\nloads to avoid application of a demand ratchet to schedulable, temporary, increased demand during\noff-peak months when ETI's costs are lowest. DOE suggests that the proposed rider will allow the\nDOE to schedule important testing and oil exchanges, when possible, during off-peak months, is\nconsistent with existing riders, and does not adversely impact other customers.\n\n\n          DOE explained that its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (Reserve) Texas sites-Big Hill in\nJefferson County and Bryan Mound in Brazoria County-play an important role in ensuring the\nenergy security of the United States. With a crude oil inventory of about 726.5 million barrels in\n2010, the Reserve is the largest emergency supply of oil in the world. The Reserve was established\nby Congress as a result of the oil supply disruption in the early 1970s.978\n\n\n          DOE witness Etheridge testified that DOE takes service to its Big Hill site under\nSchedule LIPS at an annual cost of approximately $770,000. Mr. Etheridge explained that the\nReserve' s sites typically operate in standby mode, with routine cyclical tests of pumping equipment.\nThe largest of these tests is performed every other year. These cyclical equipment tests can be\ncoordinated with ETI so that they occur during low peak periods. 979\n\n\n          On rare occasions, the Reserve can also be tapped. In its nearly 35 years of operations, there\nhave been three Presidential-ordered drawdowns: January 1991, the beginning of Desert Storm;\nSeptember 2005, Hurricane Katrina; and July-August 2011, the International Energy Agency\ncoordinated release. The latter was the largest of the three drawdowns at 30.6 million barrels.\nAdditionally, the Reserve has provided support to the oil industry in localized emergency or\noperational situations involving a disruption in supply, such as ship channel closures and hurricanes.\n\n\n\n\n978\n      DOE Ex. I (Etheridge Direct) at 3.\n979\n      DOE Ex. I (Etheridge Direct) at 3-4\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                               PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE302\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nWhen oil is exchanged during these situations, the Reserve will operate pumps at higher levels than\nwould occur during normal standby operations. 980\n\n\n          Mr. Etheridge proposed a rider to Schedule LIPS where maximum demands during pre-\nscheduled, non-summer month operations of a limited duration are not subject to demand ratchets.\nFor this new rider, he proposed that the non-summer months be classified as October through May to\ngive customers and ETI more flexibility. (Under Schedule LIPS, non-summer months are November\nthrough April.) Key provisions of the proposed SIPS rider include:\n\n\n                      A requirement that customers schedule with ETI limited duration\n                      operations during non-summer months four weeks in advance.\n\n                      ETI must approve scheduled operations.\n\n                      Operations would not be allowed to exceed 10,000 kW in magnitude nor\n                      last for more than 80 hours per year.\n\n                      ETI could cancel operations at any time if a capacity constraint develops.\n                      If a customer failed to comply, the customer would incur costs associated\n                      with ETI' s ratchet.\n\n                      A customer in compliance would not be subject to ETI' s demand ratchets\n                      for loads established during those operations, but would pay the demand\n                      charge in the month in which the operations occur. 981\n\n          Mr. Etheridge gave an example of charges under Schedule LIPS versus charges if the rider\nwere adopted. In September 2010, Big Hill conducted a test and established a maximum measured\ndemand of 11,640 kW, well above the site's average maximum demand of approximately 3,000 kW.\nDOE paid demand charges on the 11,640 kW in September 2010. In October 2010, ETibilled DOE\nfor 75 percent of that level of demand or 8,730 kW based on the rolling 12-month ratchet. Its actual\ndemand was 2,520 kW. In terms of actual costs, DOE paid $683,000 for its September usage. Under\nthe 75 percent ratchet, DOE would pay $609,000 per month. Mr. Etheridge estimated that the\n\n\n980\n      DOE Ex. 1 (Etheridge Direct) at 3-4.\n981\n      DOE Ex. 1 (Etheridge Direct) at 18.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                              PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                          PAGE303\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ncharges amounted to $59/k:W per year, which could easily represent nearly one-half of the annual\ncarrying cost of a combustion turbine. Whereas, under the proposed rider, if DOE conducted the test\nin February as it intended to, it would have paid ETI for the 11,640 kW level of demand, but the\nusage would not be used in conjunction with ETI' s ratchets. Mr. Etheridge concluded ETI' s tariff is\nnot equitable. At the hearing, Mr. Etheridge estimated that the rider's impact on other customer\nclasses at approximately $500,000, where Schedule LIPS base rate revenues are approximately\n                982\n$110 million.\n\n\n          According to DOE, for 15 years, June 1996-June 2011, ETI, by contract, accommodated the\nReserve's intermittent load by allowing the DOE to, once annually, \"reset\" the demand level to be\nused by ETI when applying demand ratchets. The DOE was able to avoid significant demand\ncharges when typical demand was very low. After June 2011, ETI declined to apply the terms of the\nlong-time contract and allow the reset. DOE concedes that cost-based rates to reflect the Reserve' s\nunique operations should ultimately be addressed by contract and/or new tariffs.\n\n\n          DOE notes that the very purpose of some riders is to address specific customer\ncharacteristics. For instance, Standby and Maintenance Service is available only to those customers\nthat co-generate electricity; the Optional Rider to Schedule LIPS for Pipeline Pumping Service alters\nthe designation of on peak-hours only for customers with pipeline pumping stations. Other riders,\nclaims DOE, seek a win-win for all customers. For instance, the Rider to LIPS for Planned\nMaintenance rewards customers for scheduling routine maintenance and idling facilities during ETI' s\npeak summer months of June through September by waiving the demand ratchet. DOE argues that\nthe proposed SIPS rider mirrors Planned Maintenance by waiving the demand ratchet if customers\nare able to schedule intermittent loads outside of ETI's peak summer months. Moving toward\ncost-based rates is not discriminatory, claims DOE. Nor is rewarding customers who use their load\nscheduling flexibility for the benefit of all customers.\n\n\n          DOE's proposed SIPS rider is opposed by ETI, TIEC, and Staff.\n\n\n\n982\n      DOE Ex. I (Etheridge Direct) at 19-20; Tr. at 2034.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                    PAGE304\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          ETI witness Talkington testified that the actual Reserve load, as Mr. Etheridge described,\ndoes not appear to match the parameters of his proposed SIPS rider. As recently as July and August\n2011, the Reserve sites had significant load requirements in order to pump vast quantities of oil. She\nfurther testified that the Reserve loads are random in occurrence and are significant. ETI must at all\ntimes maintain generation resources to meet this significant and randomly occurring load. In\naddition, the Company has invested in transmission and other facilities to serve this customer even if\nthere is no or very little consumption. She believed it would not be appropriate or equitable to other\ncustomers to remove or forgive the 12-month ratchet provision after the Company made these\ninvestments to serve the Reserve and while the Company has maintained generation to meet its load.\nIf the 12-month ratchet were forgiven, then the costs incurred to serve DOE would have to be borne\nby other customers in the LIPS rate class. 983\n\n\n          TIEC witness Pollock complained that Mr. Ethridge failed to analyze the impact on other\nLIPS customers. Mr. Pollock contended the rider would discriminate against both Schedule LIPS\ncustomers (by redefining the summer billing period) and Schedule SMS customers (whose ability to\nschedule maintenance power could be subordinate to LIPS customer taking advantage of the new\nRider). 984\n\n\n          Staff is concerned that the rider's unusual eligibility requirements-that a customer must\nschedule load four weeks in advance, limit the high load occurrence to \"off-peak months\" (which is\nredefined in the rider), and limit the yearly hours of load-indicate it is tailored solely to meet the\nunique needs of the Reserve. According to Staff, DOE conceded that, although other customers with\nintermittent loads might take advantage of the proposed SIPS rider, Mr. Etheridge was not aware of\nany other actual customer that could do so. 985 Staff argues the rider appears to offer unreasonably\npreferential treatment to the DOE and should be rejected.\n\n\n\n983\n      ETI Ex. 67 (Talkington Rebuttal) at 41.\n984\n      TIEC Ex. 3 (Pollock Cross Rebuttal) at 9-10, 44-46.\n985\n    Tr. at 2008 (\"Q: Now, who else would take advantage of this SIPS rate schedule, other than DOE?

Although DOE indicates that any shift would have a small overall\nimpact on the LIPS class, Staff argues that the Commission should not endorse any discriminatory\nrate rider.\n\n\n        Although Staff and TIEC claim the proposed rider is discriminatory, other riders applicable to\nSchedule LIPS customers are available at different times of the year as well (Planned Maintenance is\navailable only during the months of June through September) and others are limited to\ncustomer-specific needs-such as PPS for pipeline customers. Mr. Etheridge testified that this rider\ncould apply to any customer-it is not restricted solely to the DOE. The ALJs do not find this rider\nto be unreasonably discriminatory. As to ETI' s concern on this issue, it was focused on whether the\nDOE' s load met the proposed rider's requirements. However, if a customer taking service under the\nrider is unable to schedule its maintenance and oil exchanges with ETI, then the usage would be\nunder the SIPS Schedule and the SIPS tariffed demand ratchet would apply. Moreover, Mr.\nEtheridge testified that the impact on other customer classes is limited. As to ETI' s cost recovery,\nthe LIPS rider customers will pay a demand charge to cover the costs they impose on the system in\nthe month SIPS service is taken. The ALJs agree with DOE that the SIPS rider is reasonable and\nshould be adopted.\n\n\n        5. Standby Maintenance Service (SMS)\n\n        TIEC witness Pollock explained that Schedule SMS applies to customers that use\nself-generation to supply a portion of their electricity requirements. These customers contract with ·\nETI for either standby and/or maintenance power service to replace capacity or energy normally\ngenerated by the customer's on-site generation. Standby (or backup) power is electric energy or\ncapacity supplied to replace energy or capacity that is unavailable due to an unscheduled or forced\noutage of the facility. Thus, backup power must be available at any time. Maintenance power is\nelectric energy or capacity supplied during a scheduled outage. Unlike backup power, maintenance\npower must be arranged with 24-hour notice and only during such times and at such locations that, in\n\n\ndon't know that there are others who could use it. This could apply just to DOE? A: It could.\").\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                         PAGE306\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nETl' s opinion, will not result in adversely affecting or jeopardizing firm service to other customers,\nprior commitments, or commitments to other utilities. In addition, the customer must make\narrangements and schedule maintenance power in writing in advance and confirmed in writing by\nETI. ETI can also limit requests for maintenance power and allocate and schedule available service,\nif requests are made from more than one customer. Thus, Mr. Pollock stated that maintenance power\nis of a lower quality of service than backup or standby power. He also indicated that, because the\nCompany can limit the amount of maintenance power, it is more likely that customers would prefer\n                                                                   986\nto schedule maintenance power during the non-summer months.\n\n\n          ETI witness Talkington explained that standby service includes both the readiness to serve\nand the actual delivery of power and energy delivered when a customer requires service due to a\nforced outage or a planned maintenance period. She indicated that many utilities offer a combination\nof pricing and terms for demand and energy service as well as a form of reservation charge dealing\nwith the readiness to serve. She further indicated that the actual rate design may differ, but standby\ntariffs usually contain provisions for back-up (forced outage) or maintenance (planned outage). She\nconcluded that ETI' s current rate schedule provides for these features, and ETI is not proposing to\nchange Schedule SMS in this proceeding.987\n\n\n          TIEC proposes to redesign SMS service to better reflect the cost characteristics of standby\nand maintenance power customers. Mr. Pollock provided his analysis to support TIEC's position.\nUnder the current Schedule SMS, customers pay a monthly demand (or billing load) charge of\n$1.12 per kW for backup power. The corresponding charges for maintenance power are $1.12 per\nkW for outages during the summer months (May through October) and $0.84 per kW for outages\nduring the non-summer months. Thus, the non-summer month charge is 75 percent of the summer\nmonth charge.

This compares to 74 percent for Schedule LIPS;\nthus, the ratio of the SMS to LIPS coincidence factors is 12 percent. By Mr. Pollock's calculations,\nthe resulting demand charge for transmission service would be $0.82 per kW ($7.07 x 12 percent),\nand the corresponding SMS distribution demand charge would be the sum of the transmission charge\nand the Schedule LIPS distribution demand charge, or $2.64 per kW ($0.82 + $1.82). 991\n\n\n\n\n989\n   On-peak hours are from 1:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m., Monday through Friday of each week, beginning on May\n15 and continuing through October 15.

That is, Mr. Pollock stated, the 4CP demands are a primary\ndriver of the costs of the power plants, PPAs, and transmission facilities.      As noted above,\nMr. Pollock contended and verified by analysis that a cost-based Schedule SMS demand charge\n                                                                                   992\nshould be only 12 percent of the corresponding demand charge for Schedule LIPS.\n\n\n          Mr. Pollock also stated that he proposed to differentiate the standby demand charge by\ndelivery voltage because it more directly recognizes the different costs to provide service at\ntransmission and distribution voltage. He added that this recommendation is consistent with the\ncurrent Schedule SMS energy charges. 993 However, Mr. Pollock did not apply the 12 percent\ncoincidence ratio to determine the distribution-related schedule SMS demand charge. He explained\nthat distribution facilities are electrically closer to customers, so a customer's peak demand\ndetermines how distribution facilities must be sized to ensure reliable service. He stated that ETI\nrecognized this driver by using maximum diversified demand to allocate distribution demand-related\ncosts. For this reason, Schedule SMS customers require the same amount of distribution capacity as\na similarly sized Schedule LIPS customer. Thus, according to Mr. Pollock, the Schedule SMS\ndistribution demand charge should be the same as the corresponding Schedule LIPS demand\ncharge. 994\n\n\n          Concerning energy charges, Mr. Pollock testified that the Schedule SMS energy charge\nshould reflect the composite Schedule LIPS energy charges, or 0.614¢ per kWh. In his view, a\nSchedule SMS customer should also pay additional demand charges during on-peak hours, because\nthis would recognize that an SMS customer that purchases more energy during on-peak hours would\nmore closely resemble a LIPS customer. For this reason, cost-based on-peak energy charge should\n\n992\n      Id. at 75-77.\n993\n      TIEC Ex. 1 (Pollock Direct) at 77.\n994\n      Id. at 77-78.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                    PAGE309\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nbe a composite of the Schedule LIPS energy charge and the remaining demand charges (not collected\nin the SMS demand charge). He calculated an additional on-peak energy charge of 0.303¢, which\nyields a total on-peak energy charge of 0.917¢. Under this structure, an SMS customer that\nexperiences an outage would pay approximately the same for electricity as a LIPS customer.995\n\n           In summary, Mr. Pollock contended that Schedule SMS should be reduced to more closely\nreflect the cost of providing standby service as follows: 996\n\n                                  Cost-Based Schedule SMS Charges\n                            Based on ETI' s Proposed Schedule LIPS Design\n                                            Distribution     Transmission\n                             Charge\n                                         (less than 69kV) (69kV and greater)\n                                      Billing Load Charge ($/kW)\n                            Standby            $2.64             $0.82\n                           Maintenance         $2.44             $0.62\n                                      Non-Fuel Enenzv Char e (¢/kWh)\n                           On-Peak        0.955¢            0.916¢\n                           Off-Peak       0.639¢            0.614¢\n\n           Using his recommended Schedule LIPS rate design, he proposed Schedule SMS charges\nshown in the table below: 997\n\n\n                                          TIEC Proposed SMS Charges\n                                                 Distribution       Transmission\n                                 Charge\n                                              (less than 69kV)   (69kV and greater)\n                        Customer Charge\n                                                        $6,000\n                         (Stand Alone)\n                                     Billing Load Charge ($/kW)\n                            Standby            $2.46            $0.79\n                          Maintenance          $2.27            $0.60\n                                      Non-Fuel Energy Charge (¢/kWh)\n                        On-Peak             0.881¢            0.846¢\n                        Off-Peak            0.575¢            0.552¢\n\n995\n      Id. at 77-78; Ex.

If the Schedule LIPS revenue requirement is reduced, the charges should be\ncorrespondingly reduced. Mr. Pollock also added a customer charge, but he stated that the customer\ncharge should not apply if a Schedule SMS customer also purchased supplementary power under\nanother applicable rate. 998\n\n\n            To determine maintenance power charges, Mr. Pollock maintained the same relationship; that\nis, the current maintenance power demand charge is 75 percent of the standby power demand charge.\nHe stated that the 75 percent should apply to the production/transmission component of the\nrecommended standby power demand charge because distribution costs are caused by maximum\ndemands occurring at any time, as previously discussed. This would result in a $0.20 and\n$0.19 per kW differential based on ETI's proposed and Mr. Pollock's recommended Schedule LIPS\ndesigns, respectively. 999\n\n\n            The AIJs note that Mr. Pollock's suggested changes to Schedule SMS are extensive. For\ninstance, he introduced a $6,000 customer charge and, for the monthly billing load (demand)\ncharges, he introduced separate rates for distribution and transmission customers. 1000\n\n\n            Ms. Talkington testified that Mr. Pollock erred in using load data for the period of 2007\nthrough 2011 to develop a coincidence factor that he then uses to develop a lower back-up and\nmaintenance demand charge for transmission-level customers, while significantly increasing the\ncharge for distribution-level customers. She also stated that Mr. Pollock's proposal fails to recognize\nthe \"readiness to serve\" aspect of standby service. ETI must be ready to serve the load represented\nby the largest generation unit taking standby service, plus account for the forced outage rates for all\nother existing customer-owned generators. 1001\n\n\n\n998\n       Id. at 79.\n999\n       TIEC Ex. 1 (Pollock Direct) at 80.\n1000\n       TIEC Ex. 1 (Pollock Direct) at 80.\n1001\n       ETI Ex. 67 (Talkington Rebuttal) at 20-21.\n\f                                                                                                                    ---   ;\n\n                                                                                                                          '\n\n\n\nSOAHDOCKETNO.-                              PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                    PAGE311\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          Ms. Talkington also stated Mr. Pollock failed to recognize that standby load does not lend\nitself to the typical rate design practices. She opined that the cost of providing SMS service is not\ndriven only by the degree to which standby customers contribute to peak demand, but also by the\nCompany's obligation to serve whenever called upon. This is the major reason Schedule SMS is not\nincluded in the development of allocation factors. 1002\n\n\n          Ms. Talkington admitted that she is not familiar with how ETI originally developed\nSchedule SMS, but stated that she knows that when a customer takes back-up or maintenance\nservice, costing is generally designed to mimic what the customer would have paid on standard rates,\nabsent the use of its own generator. She concluded that Mr. Pollock's analysis is over-simplified and\nincomplete. 1003\n\n\n          In rebuttal testimony, Ms. Talkington proposed a new rate design for SMS service, including\na new service, Non-Reserved Service, which is an optional service designed to supplement\nMaintenance Service. ETI's new SMS proposal increases ETis test year base rate revenues by\n53.27 percent, with an overall increase of $5.1 million. ETI did not include this rate increase in its\nnotice. 1004 Accordingly, the ALls determine that ETI's new SMS proposal is not an option to be\nconsidered in this case.\n\n\n          Commission Staff does not oppose ETI's request to retain its current Schedule SMS.\n\n\n          ETI did not demonstrate how its current rates are just and reasonable. Rather, ETI' s evidence\non the reasonableness of Schedule SMS is conclusory and insufficient in light of Mr. Pollock's\ntestimony that the rates are not cost-based. Moreover, although Ms. Talkington indicated her\nconcern with Mr. Pollock's analysis, she provided no quantitative support for her concern. The\nAUs, however, are concerned that Mr. Pollock's suggested changes are not accompanied by a rate\n\n1002\n       ETI Ex. 67 (Talkington Rebuttal) at 21.\n1003\n       ETI Ex. 67 (Talkington Rebuttal) at 21-22.\n1004\n    PURA§ 36.102 and P.U.C.

And, as noted above, his suggested changes are extensive.         Mr. Pollock's\nrecommendations included a significant increase in the charge for distribution-level customers.\nConsistent with his Schedule LIPS recommendation, Mr. Pollock also included a $6,000 customer\ncharge when no previous customer charge existed. Again, there is no analysis as to the effect such a\ncharge would have on customer bills. The testimony of witnesses Benedict, Abbott, Higgins, and\nPevoto caution that gradualism should be considered in rate design. As noted by Mr. Higgins, \"full\nmovement to cost-based rates in a single step is sometimes opposed on the grounds of intra-class rate\nimpacts.\" 1005 However, the rate impact at this time is not known.\n\n\n          Based on the evidence and discussion above, the AUs recommend adoption of Mr. Pollock's\nsuggested changes to Schedule SMS , with the exception of a $6,000 customer charge. Consistent\nwith the ALls' recommendation that a new LIPS charge of $630 is reasonable, the SMS charge\nshould be limited to $630 and, as suggested by Mr. Pollock, not apply if a Schedule SMS customer\nalso purchased supplementary power under another applicable rate.\n\n\n          6. Additional Facilities Charge (AFC)\n\n          Mr. Pollock testified that Schedule AFC is the mechanism for charging customers directly for\nthe costs of transformers, breakers and lines when those facilities provide service only to specific\ncustomers. Some of these facilities are booked to transmission accounts while others are booked to\ndistribution accounts. Schedule AFC is applied as a percentage of the original (un-depreciated) cost\nof the facilities. 1006\n\n\n          TIEC contends that the Schedule AFC charges should be revised. According to Mr. Pollock,\nthe current charges exceed ETI' s ownership and O&M costs; therefore, he recommended th<\"\\t the\nmonthly charges in Schedule AFC be reduced. Under this rate schedule, there are two separate\npricing options. Option A charges 1.49 percent per month; Option B applies when a customer elects\nto amortize the direct assigned facilities over a shorter term, ranging from one to ten years. Thus, the\n\n\n1005\n       Kroger Ex. l (Higgins Direct) at 10.\n1006\n       TIEC Ex. 1 (Pollock Direct) at 8 L\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE313\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nOption B Monthly Recovery Tenn charge varies depending on the length of the amortization period\nof the directly assigned investment. A 0.453 percent Monthly Post-Recovery term charge also\napplies after a facility has been fully depreciated. ETI did not propose to change either the Option A\nor Option B charges in Schedule AFC. 1007\n\n\n           According to Mr. Pollock's analysis, charges imposed under Option A should be 1.20 percent\nper month under ETI's proposed revenue requirements. Under Option B, Mr. Pollock proposes\nvarious changes to the Recovery Tenn charges, and reduces the Monthly Post-Recovery term to\n0 .3 5 percent per month. Further, if the Commission approves a lower base revenue requirement than\nETI has proposed, Mr. Pollock stated that the recommended Schedule AFC charges (both Option A\nand Option B) should be reduced in proportion to any authorized reduction in ETI' s proposed rate of\nreturn, O&M expense, and property tax expense. 1008\n\n\n           In reaching this recommendation, Mr. Pollock used two different methods to derive a cost-\nbased rate: a levelized cost analysis and a revenue requirement analysis. The former resulted in an\nOption A rate of 1.20 percent per month, and the revenue requirement analysis resulted in a weighted\naverage rate of 1.18 percent. For Option B charges, Mr. Pollock also used a levelized cost analysis\nfor each of the Option B amortization periods, which resulted in lower charges. 1009\n\n\n           ETI witness Talkington disagrees with Mr. Pollock's description of Schedule AFC. She\ntestified that the rate schedule encompasses the costs associated with the installation of facilities\nother than those normally furnished. Or, under one option, the rates are like a monthly rental charge\npaid for facilities that would not normally be supplied by the Company. She also stated that\nMr. Pollock's example of facilities (transformers, breakers and lines) is understated. 1010\n\n\n\n\n1007\n       Id. at 82-85.\n1008\n       TIEC Ex. l (Pollock Direct) at 81-85 and at Exs.

The\nCommission approved this rate structure (and rate) in Docket No. 16705. Moreover, ETI witness\nTalkington testified that this rate is voluntary-a customer has alternatives beyond those offered by\nETI. Therefore, it is actually a market-driven rate. If a customer does not want to use this schedule\nto obtain the services it provides, the customer can secure services through other sources--either\nETl-owned or otherwise. Ms. Talkington further stated that Mr. Pollock's suggested changes would\nbe detrimental to the customers who do not have AFC rates because the AFC revenue is treated as an\noffset to the revenue requirement to the rate classes. 1011\n\n\n          Staff does not oppose ETI' s request to retain the AFC rate as it is currently designed.\n\n\n          The ALls find insufficient support in the record to retain ETI's Schedule AFC as-is. As\nnoted by TIEC, there is no evidence in this case to support ETI' s claim that: ( 1) the rate is a\nvoluntary rate; (2) there are other options in the market for customers; or (3) that the rate continues to\nbe based on a cost that the market will bear (as the Commission found years ago in Docket\nNo. 16705). 1012 While Ms. Talkington disagreed with Mr. Pollock's proposal because he did not\ntake into consideration the scope of facilities provided and that his proposal could be detrimental to\nother ratepayers because ETI' s revenues from this rate will decrease, she did not quantify her\nconcems. 1013 The evidence supports a change to Schedule AFC that will move the rate more towards\ncosts, and TIEC's proposals are the only ones for which there is evidence in the record. The ALls\nfurther agree with Mr. Pollock that his numbers should be reduced in proportion to any authorized\nreduction in ETI' s proposed rate of return, O&M expense, and property tax expense.\n\n\n          7.

The Company proposes no change in the customer charge of\n$425.05 per month. 1014\n\n\n           Mr. Higgins testified that ETI' s proposed LGS demand charge would recover only 72 percent\nof LGS demand-related costs. To compensate for the resultant revenue shortfall, the LGS energy\ncharges proposed by ETI would significantly over-recover energy-related costs. Specifically, the\noverall LGS energy charge is proposed to be 428 percent of base energy costs. In addition, although\nthe customer charge is proposed to be unchanged, it is set at 328 percent of cost. If, instead, the LGS\ncustomer charge were set at cost, it would only be $129.60 per month. 1015\n\n\n           Mr. Higgins illustrated his findings in the table below: 1016\n\n\n                           LG Total Class Functionalized Cost Recovery\n\n         Functions         Costs             Collected in     (Under)/Over         Percentage\n                                                Rates          Collection          Recovered\n         Demand         $46,266,083           $33,116,674      $(13,149, 409)            71.6%\n         Energ:v        $3,6625,811           $15,556,253        $11,920,442            427.9%\n         Customer          $561,445            $1,841,316         $1,279,871            328.0%\n         Total          $50,463,339           $50,514,243            $50,904\n\n\n           Mr. Higgins stated that if a utility proposes a demand charge that is below the cost, it is going\nto seek to recover its class revenue requirement by over-recovering its costs in another area, typically\nthrough an energy charge that is above unit energy costs. In his opinion, for LGS, when demand\ncharges are set below costs and energy charges are set above cost, customers with relatively higher\nload factors are required to subsidize the costs of lower load factor customers within the rate class.\nThe subsidy is different for each higher load factor customer (a customer whose load factor is greater\nthan the average for the rate schedule) and consists of the net increase in rates paid by these\n\n\n1014\n       Kroger Ex. l (Higgins Direct) at 7.\n1015\n       Id. at 8.\n1016\n       Kroger Ex. 5.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                        PAGE316\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ncustomers as a result of setting energy charges above energy costs and demand charges below\ndemand related costs. When the customer charge is set significantly above costs, smaller customers\nare overcharged and subsidize the larger customers. 1017\n\n\n          Recognizing that a full movement towards cost-based rates (without gradualism) in a single\nstep may create intra-class rate impacts, Mr. Higgins proposed the following changes to better align\ncosts: 1018\n\n\n                                         ETI                      Kroger\n                                       Proposed       %of        Proposed         %of\n                       Functions\n                                        Charge        Cost        Charge          Cost\n              Demand ($/kW)              $10.25       72%         $12.81          90%\n              Energy ($/kWh)           $0.01023       428%       $0.00513         216%\n              Customer ($/Mo)           $425.05       328%        $260.00         201%\n\n\n          Mr. Higgins developed his proposed rate impacts, which indicated a smaller rate impact on\nhigher load factor customers than those with low load factors.

Residential Service (RS)\n\n                ETI' s RS rate schedule is composed of two elements: a customer charge of $5 per month and\na consumption-based energy charge. The Energy charge is a fixed rate of 5.802¢ per kWh from May\nthrough October (Summer). In the months November through April (Winter), the rates are structured\nas a declining block, in which the price of each unit is reduced after a defined level of usage. For\ninstance, the same energy charge of 5.802¢ applies, but only for each of the first 1,000 kWh\nconsumed. Each kWh consumed beyond 1,000 is billed at a lower rate of 3.834¢. 1023\n\n\n\n\n1021\n          Staff Ex. 7 (Abbott Direct) at 25-27.\n1022      Id.\n     23\nt0   OPC Ex. 6 (Benedict Direct) at 41, Ex.

OPC witness Benedict noted that under ETI's proposed rate structure, once kWh usage\nexceeds 1,000 in a winter month, the per-kWh cost of consumption falls by 34 percent. Thus,\nbecause a declining block rate structure lowers the per-unit rate for high levels of consumption,\nheavy users are induced to consume more than they would otherwise. In his view, this runs contrary\nto the Legislature's goal of reducing both energy demand and energy consumption in Texas, as stated\nin PURA § 39.905:\n\n\n          (a) It is the goal of the legislature that: ... (2) all customers, in all customer classes,\n          will have a choice of and access to energy efficiency alternatives and other choices\n          from the market that allow each customer to reduce energy consumption, summer\n          and winter peak, or energy costs.\n\nTherefore, Mr. Benedict recommended that the declining block rate be phased out over time. He\nstated this would ease the transition to a rate structure without a declining block, and it would allow\ntime for customers to switch to more efficient heating systems. Mr. Benedict proposed that the\nphase-out take place over three rate cases, beginning with a one-third reduction in the block\ndifferential proposed by ETI in this case.

If,\nhowever, the Commission approves a different revenue requirement for the residential class to reflect\nvarious proposed adjustments, rates for the class will need to be recomputed regarding a reduced\nblock differential 1026\n\n\n          Staff generally agreed with OPC's recommendation for a reduction in the rate differential\nbetween the residential winter kWh :S 1000 block and the winter kWh> 1000 block, due to the\ninconsistency between the incentives produced under declining block rates and the State's energy\nefficiency goals. Staff witness Abbott stated that the extreme cold weather event of February 2011\ndemonstrated a need to incentivize wintertime energy efficiency measures, or at least a need to avoid\nencouraging excess energy usage. Therefore, Mr. Abbott agreed that some reduction in the rate\nblock differential is warranted to better encourage wintertime energy conservation at the margin. 1027\n\n\n          ETI witness Talkington testified that the RS rates are cost-based with a declining block rate\nin winter. According to Ms. Talkington, residential load factors in winter increase as energy usage\n\n\n1025\n       OPC Ex. 6 (Benedict Direct) at 43-45.\n1026\n       OPC Ex. 6 (Benedict Direct) at 46.\n1027\n       Staff Ex. 7 (Abbott Direct) at 27.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE320\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nincreases, and there is also a decrease in the fixed unit cost ($/kWh) as energy usage increases. She\nprovided analysis to support her position. 1028 Ms. Talkington explained that residential rates do not\ninclude demand charges because of the absence of residential demand meters. However, residential\nenergy rates can be structured the same as the non-residential classes; that is, customer charge,\ndemand charge and energy charge.· She developed residential rates on this basis to show that the\ndeclining block rate is appropriate to account for reductions in the cost of service to residential\ncustomers as consumption increases. With no declining block rate, high load factor customers are\ndisadvantaged as the customer charge is reduced and the demand charge is moved into the energy\ncharge. She believes that declining block rates alleviate the disadvantage. 1029\n\n\n           Ms. Talkington illustrated the impact of Mr. Benedict's suggestion to phase out the declining\nblock rate for RS customers. Approximately 54 percent ofETI's residential customers use more than\n1,000 kWh in January and February. For a customer using 3,000 kWh in a winter month of\nNovember-April, this customer's bill would increase by 16.28 percent or about $48 over current\nrates. (Of ETI' s total number of RS customers, approximately 10 percent use 3,000 kWh or more in\nthe months of January and February.) For that same customer, ETI's as-filed proposal shows an\nincrease of 11.96 percent or approximately $35. Mr. Benedict's proposal is $13 greater than ETI's\nproposal for one winter month at 3 ,000 kWh. That dollar amount is over a third of the total increase\nETI is proposing. 1030\n\n\n           After Mr. Benedict's proposed phase-out is completed, based on the proposed residential\nrates in the Company's case, the residential rate would be $0.06887 per kWh in both summer and\nwinter. A customer using 3,000 kWh in a winter month of November-April would see an increase of\n24.89 percent or about $7? over current rates. After the final phase out, Mr. Benedict's proposal is\n$38 per month greater than ETI's as-filed proposal of $35 for one winter month at 3,000 kWh. 1031\n\n\n\n1028\n       ETI Ex. 67 (Talkington Rebuttal) at 13, Ex.

Even though Mr. Benedict proposes to implement the change over the next\nthree rate cases, she concludes there will still be winners and losers within the residential class as a\nresult of his proposed change. According to Ms. Talkington, some customers have made decisions\nabout investing in electric appliances based on the current rate design. The elimination of the\ndeclining block in the winter time changes the economics of customer decisions that have already\nbeen made. She believes that great caution needs to be exhibited and very good reasons need to be\ndemonstrated before changes are made to the rate design. She recommended that if a change to the\nrate structure is recommended, the initial phase-in should be reduced to 10 percent rather than one-\nthird and subsequent reductions should be reviewed for consideration at the occurrence of each rate\ncase filing and not mandated at this time. 1032\n\n\n          The AUs concur with OPC and Staff that the structure of the declining block winter rates\nprovide a disincentive to energy efficiency. However, ETI provided evidence that OPC' s suggested\nchanges, combined with ETI' s proposed rate increase, will have too great an impact. OPC suggested\na one-third reduction in the differential, while Ms. Talkington suggested a 10 percent reduction, with\nsubsequent reductions reviewed before being mandated. The AU s recommend an initial 20 percent\nreduction, which should alleviate some of ETI's concerns but still reduce the block differential\nsufficiently to move towards compliance with the energy goals set out in PURA.

With the exception of three minor\nissues that are discussed below, none of the intervenors raised a substantive issue with respect to\nETI' s fuel reconciliation request.\n\n             During the Reconciliation Period, ETI' s Texas fuel factor revenues over-recovered total fuel\nand purchased power expense by $243,339,353, inclusive of interest. The Commission authorized\nthe refund of the fuel over-recovery balance in Docket Nos. 37580, 38403, and 38967. ETI proposes\nthat the amount of any fuel over-recovery balance not already refunded or authorized for refund be\nrolled forward as the beginning balance for the next reconciliation period. 1033\n\n             P.U.C.

Any choice within the select range of reasonable options is\n       prudent, and the Commission should not substitute its judgment for that of the utility\n       . . . . The reasonableness of an action or decision must be judged in light of the\n       circumstances, information, and available options existing at the time, without\n       benefit of hindsight. 1034\n\n       ESI purchases power and procures fossil fuels on behalf of the individual Operating\nCompanies. Fossil fuel costs are borne directly by the Operating Company that contracts for and\nuses the fuel. Once resources are procured to meet forecasted demand, the system is operated during\nthe current day using all of the resources available to the system to meet the total system demand.\nThroughout the course of the day, system operators may modify planned operations to maintain\nreliability, take advantage of less-expensive resources in the hourly wholesale power markets, or\nmake off-system sales. For example, when spot market power purchases are available at a cost lower\n\n\n\n\n1034\n   Application of Gulf States Utilities Company to Reconcile its Fuel Costs, Docket No. 15102, Order on\nRehearing at 2 (Jun. 24, 1997).\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                               PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE324\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nthan the cost of energy that can be generated by units owned by the Operating Companies, that\nenergy is purchased to displace owned generation, subject to operating constraints. 1035\n\n\n          Expenses for coal, gas, power purchases, and fuel oil are incurred directly by the respective\nOperating Company. For example, if coal is purchased for ETI' s share of Nelson Station, Unit 6,\nthen ETI is responsible for the invoiced cost and makes payment directly to the supplier. Wholesale\npower, purchased and sold for the system, however, is accounted for per the terms of the System\nAgreement. After dispatch, or after-the-fact, the System Agreement prescribes an accounting\nprotocol to bill the costs of operating the system to the individual Operating Companies. 1036\n\n\n          The following Fuel Reconciliation-related issues were uncontested:\n\n\n               ~   Natural Gas Purchases\n\n          ETI witness Karen Mcllvoy presented direct testimony describing ETI' s natural gas\nprocurement policies and strategies. She explained that the Company buys gas through a long-term\ncontract with Enbridge, through participation in the monthly and daily markets depending on fuel\nneeds, and on a delivered-to-plant basis or arrange for transportation to the plant. Ms. Mcllvoy\ndescribed how the gas buyers for ETI survey the markets and solicit offers for gas supplies.\nMs. Mcllvoy also provided a comparison of the Company's gas costs to the Inside FERC and Gas\nDaily published indices for the Houston Ship Channel. 1037 No party challenged the Company's\nnatural gas purchases.\n\n\n               ~   Fuel Oil\n\n          Ms. Mcllvoy testified that the Company purchased fuel oil for start-up and flame stabilization\nat certain units. Fuel oil can also be used for emergency back-up fuel or as an economic alternative\nto natural gas at certain units. During the Reconciliation Period, the Company purchased all fuel oil\n\n1035\n       ETI Ex. 40 (Thiry Direct) at 18-21.\n1036\n       ETI Ex. 39 (Cicio Direct) at 31-37.\n1037\n       ETI Ex. 28 (Mcllvoy Direct) at 23, Ex.

Cooper addressed the Entergy system's long-term planning process\nand described the Strategic Resource Plan process. He explained how the system determined its\ncapabilities and needs for additional resources to reliably serve system load requirements.\nMr. Cooper described the process by which the system developed requests for proposals and\nanalyzed a combination of capacity and firm energy contracts to satisfy the system's identified\nresource needs. 1039 A portion of these system purchases was allocated to ETI. No party proposed a\ndisallowance of these purchases on the basis of prudence.\n\n\n               ~   Short-Term Purchased Power\n\n          Ms. Thiry described the Power Marketing Team's procurement strategies, practices and\nprocedures during the Reconciliation Period. Ms. Thiry testified that the Power Marketing Team\nfulfilled its objective of purchasing energy in the wholesale market when it was more economical\nthan using the system's generatio!l and in order to maintain system reliability.        Ms. Thiry\ndemonstrated that third-party purchases for the system compared favorably to market price indices\nand to proxy costs of avoided generation. 1040 The Power Marketing Team maintained effective cost\ncontrols and procured a diverse portfolio of product to provide electricity for customers at a\nreasonable cost. 1041 No party contested the prudence of ETI' s short-term power purchases.\n\n\n               ~   Coal Commodity and Transportation\n\n          ETI has ownership interest and/or obtains power through Schedule MSS-4 of the Entergy\nSystem Agreement, in two coal-burning generating units - Nelson and BCil/U3.

ETI owns a 17.85 percent interest in\nBCWU3, but the unit is operated by a third party. ETI witness Ryan Trushenski, the Manager of\nCoal Supply for ESI, testified that ETI prudently managed its coal supply and transportation\nexpenses during the Reconciliation Period. 1042\n\n\n             With respect to coal and transportation expenses at Nelson 6, ETI obtained coal during the\nReconciliation Period under a supply contract previously reviewed by the Commission, and entered\ninto a new coal supply contract after a competitive bid process. ETI chose the supplier with the\nlowest priced coal that met the specifications necessary for use at Nelson 6. Similarly, ETI arranged\nfor transportation of coal according to transportation contracts previously reviewed in prior fuel\nreconciliations. When those contracts expired, ETI initiated a competitive bid process and chose the\nlowest cost option available that met its requirements. With respect to BCWU3, ETI incurred costs\nto run the unit and took reasonable steps to ensure that the third party operator properly charged for\ncoal and transportation expenses under an arrangement previously reviewed and approved in prior\nfuel reconciliations. 1043 No party challenged the reasonableness and necessity of ETI's coal or\ntransportation expense during the Reconciliation Period\n\n\n             The three contested issues are discussed below.\n\n\nA.           Spindletop Gas Storage Facility\n\n             During the Reconciliation Period, ETI incurred $10,261,663 of non-fuel expense associated\nwith operating the Spindletop Facility. Cities challenged ETI's use of the Spindletop Facility,\narguing that the costs of operating it outweigh the benefits gained from it. For the same reason he\nchallenged the Spindletop Facility costs associated with rate base, Cities witrtess Nalepa also\nchallenges ETI's non-fuel expense associated with the facility.             Specifically, Mr. Nalepa\nrecommends that ETI's total fuel reconciliation balance be reduced by $6,595,290, which he\n\n\n1041   Id.\n1042\n       ETI Ex. 33 (Trushenski Direct) at 2.\n1043\n       Id. at 11-13.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                 PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE327\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ncalculates as the difference between the $10,261,633 non-fuel operational costs associated with the\nSpindletop Facility over the Reconciliation Period and the costs of alternative sources of providing a\nreliable and flexible gas supply over the same period. 1044 fu Section V .H., above, the AU s rejected\nCities' contention that the Spindletop Facility is not used or useful. For the same reason they\nrejected Cities' Spindletop Facility arguments relevant to rate base, the AUs also reject Cities'\nSpindletop Facility arguments relevant to Fuel Reconciliation.\n\n\nB.        Use of Current Line Losses for Fuel Cost Allocation\n\n          Cities propose that the allocation of fuel costs incurred over the Reconciliation Period reflect\nthe current line loss study performed by ETI for this case and recommended for approval on a going\nforward basis. fu the fuel reconciliation case, ETI proposes to allocate costs to customers using a\nline loss study performed in 1997, which Cities claim does not reflect the current cost of providing\nservice to the current wholesale customers and to the various retail customers. 1045 According to\nCities, updating ETI' s allocation of fuel costs to reflect current line losses and the cost of providing\nservice to customers results in a $3,981,271 reduction to the Texas retail fuel expenses incurred over\nthe Reconciliation Period. 1046\n\n\n           ETI responds that the Cities' recommendation is unprecedented.              It notes that the\nCommission's substantive rules require use of \"a commission-approved adjustment to account for\nline losses corresponding to the voltage at which the electric service is provided.\" 1047 Moreover, ETI\nargues that retroactive use of new loss factors to calculate its fuel over/under-recovery balance would\nresult in a mismatch between the revenues recovered under the fuel factor and the costs billed and\nallocated to the various customer classes. 1048\n\n\n\n\n1044\n       Cities Ex. 6 (Nalepa Direct) at 42-43; Cities Initial Brief at 84.\n1045\n       Cities Ex. 6 (Napala Direct) at 44; see also Tr. at 1469-1470.\n1046\n       Cities Ex. 6 (Napala Direct) at 47, Table 14.\n1047\n       ETI Ex. 58 (McCloskey Rebuttal) at 2, quoting P.U.C.

One of the\nelements the fuel factor is required to take into account is line losses.              P.U.C.   SUBST.\n\nR. 25.237(c)(2)(B) states that the utility must prove that: \"the proposed fuel factors utilize a\ncommission-approved adjustment to account for line losses corresponding to the voltage at which the\nelectric service is provided.\" 1049 If the Commission were to adopt Cities' recommendation that the\nnewly-developed line losses be used in the reconciliation of fuel costs, the allocation of those costs\nwould not match the collections (determined through the use of historical line losses). This\nmismatch could result in some customers receiving more than they are entitled and others receiving\nless than they are entitled. The AUs find that the Commission's rules require the use of\nCommission-approved line losses that were in effect at the time fuel costs were billed to customers\nin a fuel reconciliation. The AUs, therefore, recommend that the Commission reject the Cities'\nproposed adjustment.\n\n\nC.           ETl's Special Circumstances Request\n\n             In the application, ETI seeks to include $99,715 in the Fuel Reconciliation to allow it to\nrecover \"the reversal of certain credits that were previously included in the Company's [Incremental\nPurchased Capacity Rider] Rider IPCR.\" 1050 ETI witness Zakrzewski explained that the FERC\nrevised the amount of purchased capacity-related production costs allocable to ETI through the\nFERC-approved Rough Production Cost Equalization mechanism for allocating production costs\namong the Operating Companies. As Mr. Zakrzewski explained, the result of the decision was a\nrecalculation of ETI' s capacity costs recoverable through the Commission-approved Rider IPCR,\nwhich expired during the Reconciliation Period. 1051\n\n\n             During the hearing, no party contested ETI's special circumstances request of $99,715 with\nregard to the IPCR-related adjustment. For the first time in its Initial Brief, however, Cities opposed\n\n\n\n\n1049\n       P.U.C. SUBST.

As pointed out by ETI, 1053 Cities provided no testimony or other\nevidence to support its position. Furthermore, Cities failed to explain how a settlement agreement\nreached in Docket No. 37744 could or should trump the FERC's jurisdiction to determine the\namount of purchased capacity costs attributable to ETI. The only evidence in the record supports\nETI's recovery of these costs. Accordingly, the ALJs recommend that these FERC-imposed costs\nshould be found to be recoverable and Cities' request to deny their recovery should be rejected.\n\n\n           In summary, the ALJs conclude that, consistent with the requirements of P.U.C.       SUBST.\n\nR. 25.236(d)(l), ETI met its burden to prove that: (1) its eligible fuel expenses during the\nReconciliation Period were reasonable and necessary expenses incurred to provide reliable electric\nservice to its retail customers; (2) the prices charges by its affiliates were reasonable and necessary\nand no higher than the prices charged by the supplying affiliates to other affiliates or to unaffiliated\npersons; and (3) ETI has properly accounted for the amount of fuel-related revenues collected\npursuant to the fuel factor during the Reconciliation Period.\n\n\n                                      XII.    OTHER ISSUES\n\nA.         MISO Transition Expenses [Germane to Preliminary Order Issue Nos. 6-8 and Docket\n           No. 39741 Preliminary Order Issue Nos. 1-9]\n\n           Entergy is seeking to transfer operational control of the Entergy Operating Companies'\ntransmission assets to the MISO Regional Transmission Organization (RTO). ETI expects its share\nof the costs for this transfer will include approximately $17 million of expense. 1054 ETI has made\ntwo alternate proposals to recover these expenses. ETI's first proposal requests the Commission to\napprove a deferred accounting of its transition expense incurred on or after January 1, 2011, and to\napprove accrual of interest on the deferred amount at ETI's overall rate of return. Under this\nproposal, ETI would present the resulting regulatory asset for review in a future proceeding.

In its Preliminary Order in Docket 39741, the Commission stated that it\nhad authority to allow such a deferral of costs \"when it is necessary to carry out a provision of\nPURA.\" It also stated that whether ETI's request met this requirement \"hinges on the factual issue\nof necessity .... \"\n\n\n          As an alternative proposal, ETI requested the Commission to include $4 million of transition\nexpense in base rates set in the present case, based on a three-year amortization of a total of\n$12 million in MISO transition expenses. ETI's Test Year MISO transition expenses totaled only\n$916,535, but ETI's request for deferred accounting addressed expenses incurred on or after\nJanuary 1, 2011, which is after the Test Year concluded. ETI argues that its request is a conservative\nknown and measureable change because the post-Test-Year expenses will be significantly more than\n$4 million per year. Further, these costs would be removed from ETI' s cost of service if its deferred\naccounting proposal is approved.\n\n\n          As noted, ETI' s proposals concern MISO transition expenses incurred on or after January 1,\n2011. However, ETI also incurred $263,908 in these expenses during the 2010 portion of the Test\nYear. ETI has proposed a five-year amortization of this amount ($52,800 per year), assuming either\nits primary proposal or its alternative proposal is adopted. However, ifETI's primary and alternative\nproposals are both rejected, ETI requested that no reduction be made to its total Test Year amount of\n$916,535. 1055\n\n\n          Cities, TIEC, State Agencies, and Staff opposed ETI' s requests. They argue that ETI failed to\nestablish that the proposed deferred accounting is necessary to carry out a provision of PURA, as\nrequired by the Commission's Preliminary Order. They also contended that ETI' s alternate request\nto include $4 million in base rates is not a known and measureable change and should be disallowed.\n\n\n          The AU s recommend that the Commission deny ETI' s request for deferred accounting of its\nMISO transition expenses to be incurred on or after January 1, 2011.

Deferred Accounting\n\n          In support of its deferred accounting request, ETI cited State v. Public Utility Comm'n of\nTexas. 1056 In that case, the Texas Supreme Court stated that a deferred accounting is \"necessary\"\nwhen it will \"ensure that the requirements of [PURA] are met.\" 1057 In ETI's opinion, deferred\naccounting is necessary in the present case to ensure that PURA§§ 36.051and36.003(a) are met\n{i.e., that utilities have a reasonable opportunity to recover their expenses and receive reasonable\nrates). ETI also relied on Hammack v. Public Utility Commission of Texas, which stated that \"a need\n... is a relative requirement, ranging from an imperative need to one that is minimal ....\" 1058\n\n\n          ETl-witness Brett Perlman testified that deferred accounting is also necessary to ensure the\nrequirements of PURA § 31.001 (c) are carried out. 1059 That section encourages development of a\ncompetitive wholesale electric market.           ETI noted that the Hammack opinion stated that\nSection 31.00l(c) amounts to a \"legislative directive that the Commission formulate policies\nresponsive to the needs of the emerging competitive wholesale market.\" 1060 Therefore, ETI asserted\nthat RTO membership and deferred accounting are necessary because they will ensure that the\nCommission meets its obligation under Section 31.00l(c). More specifically, ETI stated, bothRTO\nmembership and deferred accounting itself constitute examples of policies required by section\n31.00l(c) to support wholesale competition. Therefore, ETI argues that its request for deferred\n\n\n\n\n1056\n       883 S.W.2d 190 (Tex. 1994).\n1057\n       883 S.W.2d at 194.\n1058\n     Hammack v. Pub. Util.

He added that ETI has been exploring membership in an\nRTO for over ten years and those costs have historically been included in ETI' s base rates; therefore,\nhe concluded that deferred accounting was not necessary in the past and is not necessary now. Cities\nstressed that ETI conceded that deferred accounting of these expenses is not necessary to maintain its\nfinancial integrity, and in Cities' opinion, both State v. Public Utility Comm'n of Texas, 1062 and the\nCommission's Preliminary Order require a showing of impairment of financial integrity to conclude\nthat deferred accounting is necessary to comply with PURA § 36.051. Cities also stated that ETI\nfailed to show that deferred accounting is necessary to comply with PURA §§ 36.003 and 31.001 (c);\ntherefore, Cities argues that ETI' s request for deferred accounting should be denied.\n\n\n          TIEC also opposed ETI' s request for deferred accounting, arguing that ETI failed to\ndemonstrate that it is necessary to carry out PURA§§ 36.051, 36.003, or 31.00l(c). TIEC witness\nJeffry Pollock stated there is no indication that deferred accounting treatment is necessary for ETI to\nearn a reasonable return on its invested capital or that denying the deferred accounting would prevent\nETI from having just and reasonable rates. Further, Mr. Pollock asserted there is no evidence that a\nlack of deferred accounting treatment for ETI would prevent Entergy from pursuing its MISO\nproposaI. 1063 Mr. Pollock added that ETI has incurred other similar costs to carry out various\npurposes of PURA without deferred accounting. For example, since 2005, ETI has spent nearly\n$20 million pursuing various similar activities, including transitioning to competition, investigating\nRTO options, examining changes to the Entergy System Agreement, and supporting the Entergy\n\n\n1061\n   ETI' s Initial Brief at 231-234; ETI Ex. 42 (Lewis Supplemental Direct) at 2-4; ETI Ex. 43 (Perlman\nSupplemental Direct) at 5-7.\n1062\n       883 S.W.2d 190 (Tex. 1994).\n1063\n       TIEC Ex. 1 (Pollock Direct) at 46-47.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE333\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nOATT. Yet, ETI did not seek deferred accounting for any of those costs. Finally, Mr. Pollock\ntestified that the projected transition costs are not material. He noted that ETI expects to incur\n$17 million of transition costs. 1064 This equates to $5.8 million per year, which is only l percent of\nETI's Test Year operating revenues, according to Mr. Pollock. In his opinion, this level of MISO\n                                                                                               1065\ntransition costs is easily subsumed in the normal variation in ETI's year-to-year expenses.\n\n                                                                                                      1066\n          TIEC also disagreed with ETI's interpretation of State v. Public Utility Comm'n ofTexas.\nIn TIEC' s view, that case held that deferred accounting is necessary only when needed to protect the\nfinancial integrity of the utility. Likewise, TIEC disagreed with ETI' s argument that Hammack 1067\nheld that \"need\" is a relative requirement that must be viewed in light of legislative policy\ndirectives. 1068 TIEC noted that Hammack had nothing to do with deferred accounting. Instead, it\nwas limited to the issue of whether, in granting a certificate of convenience and necessity for a\ntransmission line under PURA §37.056, the Commission should include evidence that considered\ncustomers and market participants throughout the state. 1069 In TIEC' s view, the Hammack case is\nirrelevant in determining whether deferred accounting is necessary to carry out the provisions of\nPURA§§ 36.003, 36.051, and 31.003(c). State Agencies made similar arguments.\n\n\n          Commission Staff also argues that ETI did not establish why deferred accounting is necessary\nto carry out a provision of PURA. In Staff's view, the applicable court cases and other precedent\nrequired ETI to show that deferred accounting is necessary to maintain its financial integrity, in order\nto carry out the provisions of PURA § 36.051. Staff argues that the Commission's Preliminary Order\ndid not reject the financial integrity standard when it stated: \"[t]his standard is not appropriate,\nhowever, for all circumstances and the Commission has applied different standards in various\n\n\n1064\n       ETI Ex. 42 (Lewis Supplemental Direct) at 5.\n1065\n       ETI Ex. 1 (Pollock Direct) at 48-49 and Ex.

Second, Staff argues that ETI failed establish that\ndeferred accounting is \"necessary\" to support a competitive wholesale market or that failure to allow\ndeferred accounting would prevent that goal. In other words, ETI did not show that, absent deferral,\nit would not join MISO; thus, ETI did not show how deferral would \"ensure\" that it joins an RTO.\nTherefore, Staff concluded, because ETI failed to prove that deferred accOlmting is necessary to cairy\nout any provision of PURA, ETI' s request should be denied.\n\n\n          In response to these arguments, ETI noted that no party disputed that the Commission may\ngrant deferred accounting \"when it is necessary to carry out a provision of PURA.\" It also argues\nthat Staff and intervenors misinterpreted State v. Public Utility Comm'n ofTexas 1013 as holding that\ndeferred accounting is necessary to carry out PURA § 36.051 only when a utility's financial integrity\nis at stake. Although lack of financial integrity is an indication that PURA § 36.051 has not been\ncarried out, ETI noted that this section contains other express requirements that can be met through\ndeferred accounting, such as ensuring utilities a reasonable opportunity to recover their costs. ETI\nalso cited other Commission cases in which it authorized deferred accounting when financial\nintegrity was not at stake, such as deferral of rate case expenses and merger costs for subsequent\n\n\n\n1070\n   Application of Entergy Texas, Inc. for Authority to Defer Expenses Related to its Proposed Transition to\nMembership in The Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator, Docket No. 39741 Preliminary\nOrder at 9 (Sep. 2, 2011).\n1071\n       ETI Initial Brief at 234.\n1072\n       Docket No. 39741, Preliminary Order at 11.\n1073\n       883 S.W.2d 190 (Tex. 1994).\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                          PAGE335\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nreview and recovery. 1074 ETI added that deferred accounting would permit the Commission to\nreview ETI's transition expenses in a subsequent proceeding, after determining whether ETI's\ntransition to MISO is in the public interest. Thus, under ETI's proposal, there is no risk that ETI\nwould recover such costs absent a finding that they are reasonable and necessary.\n\n\n          As for Staff and TIEC's argument that deferred accounting is not necessary to carry out\nPURA§ 31.00l(c), ETI argues that the \"necessary\" standard is not a \"but for\" test. In response to\narguments that the proposed deferred accounting will merely further policy objectives of\nSection 31.001 (c), which the Commission has deemed insufficient to meet the \"necessary\"\nstandard, 1075 ETI reiterated that the Hammack opinion held that \"the Commission's interpretation of\nneed must be viewed in light of the legislative directive that the Commission formulate policies\nresponsive to the needs of the emerging competitive wholesale market,\" as well as \"overall policy\nobjectives.\" 1076 Thus, ETI argues, that it has demonstrated that deferred accounting is necessary to\ncarryout Section 31.00l(c)- i.e., it will \"ensure\" that the requirements of that provision are carried\nout, and in particular ensure that the Legislature's specific instruction to develop the wholesale\nmarket is carried out. 1077\n\n\n          Although ETI's proposal for deferred accounting has some practical appeal, the ALls\nconclude that ETI has not shown that it is necessary to carry out a provision of PURA. The AU s\nfind that ETI was not required to show that a deferred accounting is necessary to maintain its\nfinancial integrity, as argued by intervenors. In State v. Public Utility Comm 'n of Texas, 1078 the\nTexas Supreme Court held that preserving the financial integrity of a utility was necessary to carry\nout a provision of PURA, and thus justified deferred accounting for certain expenses in that case, but\nthe court did not hold that preserving financial integrity was the sole basis upon which a deferred\n\n\n1074\n       ETI Reply Brief at 95-96.\n1075\n       Docket No. 397 41, Preliminary Order at 7.\n1076\n     Hammack v.

Likewise, in its Preliminary Order for the present case, the\nCommission stated:        \"This standard [financial integrity] is not appropriate, however, for all\ncircumstances and the Commission has applied different standards in various circumstances,\nalthough none of these standards or circumstances has been reviewed by any court.\" 1079 On the other\nhand, the ALls also find that ETI's contention that deferred accounting of the MISO transition\nexpenses will help the development of a competitive wholesale electric market, as described in\nPURA § 31.001 (c ), is not sufficient to authorize deferred accounting. Again, the Commission stated\nin the Preliminary Order that \"to carry out a provision of PURA\" means more than undefined\nprogress or movement towards a statutory objective. 1080\n\n\n           The Commission made clear that ETI' s burden was not only to show that a provision of\nPURA would be carried out by an accounting deferral of the MISO transition expenses, but that the\ndeferral is necessary to carry out that provision. The Commission added that necessity was a\nquestion of fact that \"can only be determined after development of an adequate factual record that\ndemonstrates the necessity, of whatever degree.\" 1081 Intervenors argue that Entergy's efforts to\ntransfer operational control of the Entergy Operating Companies' transmission assets to MISO will\nproceed with or without the deferred accounting requested by ETI; thus, deferred accounting is not\nnecessary. Likewise, intervenors argue that ETI's alternate proposal to recover the transition costs\nthrough base rates shows that deferred accounting is not necessary. ETI, however, asserted that\nnecessity should not be considered a \"but for\" requirement. It noted that no provision of PURA\nwould be impossible to carry out absent a deferral of rate case expenses or merger expenses, yet the\nCommission has allowed deferred accounting of such expenses in other cases. ETI also cited the\nstatement in Hammack v. Public Utility Commission of Texas that \"a need . . . is a relative\nrequirement, ranging from an imperative need to one that is minimal ....\" 1082 Intervenors criticized\nETI' s reliance on the Hammack case because it concerned a transmission line.

This\nis also consistent with the Commission's statement in the Preliminary Order that ETI' s burden was to\ndemonstrate necessity, \"of whatever degree.\"\n\n\n       ETI' s complaint is that its MISO transition expenses will soon increase above the Test Year\namount, from $916,535 for the Test Year to over $5 million per year, but it will not be able to\nrecover the increased costs through normal Test Year cost-of-service ratemaking principles. Thus,\nalthough ETI' s financial integrity may not be jeopardized, ETI argues that it nevertheless will not be\nable to have a reasonable opportunity to recover its expenses and receive reasonable rates as required\nby PURA§§ 36.051 and 36.003(a). Therefore, ETI believes the proposed deferred accounting is\nnecessary to carry out those provisions of PURA.\n\n\n       The AU s find that the essence of ETI' s complaint is that regulatory lag works against it in\nthis particular situation. But as noted by the court in State v. Public Utility Comm'n of Texas,\nregulatory lag is an ordinary element of risk for utilities. 1083 One of the characteristics of Test Year\ncost-of-service ratemaking is that some expenses upon which rates are based may go up and others\nmay go down during the time the rates are in effect. Such changes can be corrected in future\nratemaking proceedings, but in this case ETI desires to ensure that it will recover all of its MISO\ntransition costs. But State v. Public Utility Comm'n of Texas and the Commission's Preliminary\nOrder in this case make clear that eliminating the normal effects of regulatory lag by allowing a\ndeferred accounting should not be undertaken lightly. If ETI's arguments were taken to their\nextreme, a utility could obtain deferred accounting any time it anticipated a post Test Year increase\nin a particular expense, under the argument that it must be allowed to recover all of its expenses to\ncarry out the requirements of PURA§§ 36.051and36.003(a). In this case, ETI's estimated MISO\ntransition costs will equal about $5.8 million per year. As Mr. Pollock noted, this is only one percent\nof ETI' s Test Year operating revenues, which may easily be subsumed in the normal variation in\nETI's year-to-year expenses. Under these circumstances, ETI has not shown that granting its\nrequested deferred accounting is necessary to carry out the requirements of PURA §§ 36.051 and\n36.003(a) that it receive just and reasonable rates. Therefore, the ALls recommend that the\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                 PAGE338\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nCommission deny ETI' s request for deferred accounting treatment of its MISO transition expenses to\nbe incurred on or after January 1, 2011.\n\n\n        2. Base Rate Recovery\n\n        As mentioned above, if the Commission denies ETI's request for deferred accounting, ETI\nrequested the Commission to include $4 million of MISO transition expense in base rates set in the\npresent case, based on a three-year amortization of $12 million in total projected expenses.\n\n\n        Cities disputed the amount of MISO expenses ETI requested in this proposal. Cities witness\nMark Garrett testified that a $4 million annual expense is inconsistent with ETI' s own projected\ncosts. The Test Year expenses were $916,535, and the actual expenses incurred during January\nthrough November 2011 were only $2.513 million, which annualized would be $2.742 million..\nFor 2013, ETI projected MISO transition expenses of only $2.587 million, although ETI's\nprojected 2012 level of $8.9 million. However, Mr. Garrett added that 2012 is an estimated level and\nis not consistent with actual 2011 results. In his opinion, the actual 2011 level of about $2. 7 million\nor the expected 2013 level of about $2.6 million should be the outside range of what the Commission\nshould use for setting prospective rates. In any event, however, Cities argue that these projected\nlevels are not sufficiently known and measurable to include for ratemaking purposes. Cities pointed\nout that it is unknown whether ETI' s proposed move to MISO will even be approved, or whether the\nETI will even continue to incur costs toward a MISO transition. Therefore, Cities argues that only\nthe Test Year level of $916,535 should be included in rates, which would result in a downward\nadjustment of $3,083,462 to ETI's request. 1084\n\n\n        TIEC also argues that ETI' s alternative proposal should be rejected. Mr. Pollock complained\nthat this proposal would allow ETI to recover post Test Year expenses that are not known and\nmeasureable. Mr. Pollock noted that ETI' sown estimate of its share of transition costs has changed.\nWhen ETI filed its request for deferred accounting in Docket No. 39741, it estimated transition costs\n\nt0s 3 883 S.W.2d 190, 196 (Tex. 1994).\n1084\n     Cities Ex. 2 (Garrett Direct) at 61-63 and Ex.

Now it estimates costs of $17 million, an increase of over 40 percent. Further,\nMr. Pollock stated, ETI based its share of the estimated transition costs by assuming a 17 percent\nresponsibility ratio, but ETI's future responsibility ratios are not known because they are based on\nprojected growth rates of ETI relative other Entergy Operating Companies. Thus, Mr. Pollock\nconcluded that ETI' s share of future MISO transition costs cannot be appropriately measured. toss In\nsummary, TIEC argues that the Commission should deny ETI' s request for deferred accounting and\nshould allow ETI to recover only Test Year MISO transition expenses. to86 Commission Staff made\narguments similar to Cities and TIEC. 1087\n\n\n          In response, ETI argues that the $4 million annual expense requested is known and\nmeasurable. ETI noted that it already incurred over $3.6 million in transition expense in the nine\nmonths since the end of the Test Year, 1088 which equates to $4.8 million on an annual basis.\nFurthermore, ETI' s expects $17 million in transition expenses to be incurred over three years, which\nequates to $5.8 million annually. 1089 lnETI's view, the issue is whether it is sufficiently known that\nETI will incur at least $12 million in transition expense, not whether ETI can predict an exact level\nof future expense. 1090\n\n\n          The AUs recommend that the Commission authorize ETI to include $2.4 million in base\nrates set in the present case for MISO transition expense incurred on or after January 2, 2011, based\non a five-year amortization of $12 million in total projected expenses. The primary argument of\nintervenors against the adjustment is that the total of $12 million is not a known and measurable\nchange. However, the AUs find that ETI's evidence established that such expenses will total at\nleast $12 million. It is true that the Test Year expenses were less, but ETI filed its application to\neffectuate the transfer to MISO in 2012, so it is clear that those expenses will increase significantly\n\n\n1085\n       TIEC Ex. 1 (Pollock Direct) at 49-50.\n1086\n       TIEC Initial Brief at 97-98; TIEC Reply Brief at 70-71.\n1087\n       Staff Reply Brief at 65-66.\n1088\n       ETI Ex. 46 (Considine Rebuttal), Ex.

It is true that ETI has not established the precise total\namount of MISO transition expenses it will incur, but the ALJs find that those expenses will likely\nexceed the $12 million included in ETI's request. ETI requested that the $12 million total be\namortized over three years, which would produce a $4 million annual cost. However, ETI also\nrequested to amortize over five years its $263,908 in MISO transition expenses that were incurred\nduring the 2010 portion of the Test Year ($52,800 per year). If a five-year amortization is\nappropriate for those expenses, a five-year amortization would also be appropriate for the post Test\nYear MISO transition expenses. Therefore, the ALJs recommend that the Commission authorize\nETI to include in base rates $52,800 in MISO transition expenses for the 2010 portion of the Test\nYear expenses, plus $2.4 million for the post Test Year adjustment, for a total of $2,452,800.\n\n\nB.         TCRF Baseline [Germane to Supplemental Preliminary Order Issue No. 2]\n\n           In its Supplemental Preliminary Order, the Commission found that it would be appropriate to\nestablish for ETI baseline values for a TCRF and a DCRF, which may be established in future\ndockets. ETI' s filing package included worksheets for these baseline values, 1091 and ETI attached\nrevised versions of the worksheets to its initial brief to reflect ETI' s revised depreciation\ncalculations. The revised version of the transmission worksheet calculated total transmission cost\nbaseline revenue requirements of $75,074,987-Total Company and $74,997,366-Retail. 1092\nHowever, ETI acknowledged that these values may change, depending on the rulings in this case. If\nthe Commission makes other changes to ETI' s requested costs, ETI proposes filing another revised\nTCRF baseline value calculation in the compliance phase of this case, to reflect the final decisions of\nthe Commission. 1093 TIEC, Cities, and Staff also point out that various items in ETI's calculation\nhave been contested. Therefore, they also recommend that the baseline values be set during the\ncompliance phase of this case. The ALJ s agree that TCRF baseline values should be set during the\ncompliance phase of this docket, after the Commission makes final rulings on the various contested\nissues that may affect this calculation.\n\n1091\n       ETI Ex. 31 (LeBlanc Direct) at Ex.

DCRF Baseline [Germane to Supplemental Preliminary Order Issue No. 2]\n\n          As discussed above, the Commission found in its Supplemental Preliminary Order that it\nwould be appropriate to establish for ETI baseline values for a DCRF, which may be established in a\nfuture docket. ETI' s filing package included worksheets for a DCRF baseline value, 1094 and ETI\nattached a revised version of the worksheet to its initial brief to reflect ETI' s revised depreciation\ncalculations. The revised version of the distribution worksheet calculated total distribution cost\nbaseline revenue requirements of $163,560,232-Total Company and $161,537,490-Retail. 1095\nHowever, ETI acknowledged that these values may change, depending on the rulings in this case. If\nthe Commission makes other changes to ETI' s requested costs, ETI proposes filing another revised\nDCRF baseline value calculation in the compliance phase of this case, to reflect the final decisions of\nthe Commission. 1096 TIEC, Cities, and Staff also recommend that the baseline values be set during\nthe compliance phase of this case. The ALl s agree that DCRF baseline values should be set during\nthe compliance phase of this docket, after the Commission makes final rulings on the various\ncontested issues that may affect this calculation.\n\n\nD.        Purchased Power Capacity Cost Baseline [Germane to Supplemental Preliminary\n          Order Issue No. 1]\n\n          ETI requested a PPR rider in its application, but the Commission held in its Supplemental\nPreliminary Order that the proposed rider should not be considered due to the pending rulemaking\nProject No. 39246, which was opened to consider purchased capacity riders.              However, the\nCommission did add the following issue to the present case: \"What is the amount of purchased-\ncapacity costs that are proposed to be included in Entergy' s base rates?\" ETI requested authority to\ninclude $275,809,485 in its PPR rider, but because the Commission excluded the PPR rider from\nconsideration, this amount would now be included in base rates. ETI acknowledged that this amount\n\n\n\n\n1094\n       ETI Ex. 31 (LeBlanc Direct) at Ex.

Third-party contracts;\n                      2.    Legacy affiliate contracts;\n                      3.    Other affiliate contracts; and\n                      4.    Reserve Equalization.\n\n\nThe costs for all of these but third-party contracts are determined through various MSS Schedules in\nthe FERC-approved Entergy System Agreement. Therefore, State Agencies argue that if the\nCommission decides to allow purchased capacity cost recovery riders in Project No. 39246, the\nbaseline costs for ETI should be limited to only the purchased capacity costs associated with\nnon-affiliate third-party contracts. In State Agencies' opinion, ETI should not be allowed to pass\nthrough purchased capacity costs associated with legacy and other affiliate contracts or reserve\nequalization purchases, because those are not market competitive contracts. Instead, according to\nState Agencies, the affiliate contracts and reserve equalization purchases are essentially agreements\nto share centralized planned generation capacity resources among Entergy Operating Companies and\nto allocate generation costs among those companies. State Agencies also noted that these capacity\npayments are determined based on formulae in Service Schedules MSS-1 and MSS-4, included in the\nFERC-approved Entergy System Agreement. In other words, these costs are not driven by market\nprices and are not subject to market price volatility. Therefore, State Agencies argue that purchases\nother than third-party contracts should not be used as a baseline for any rider intended to address\nmarket price volatility and competitive wholesale market pressure for purchased generation\n         . •   1098\ncapacities.\n\n\n\n\n1097\n       ETI Initial Brief at 240.\n1098\n       State Agencies Ex. 2 (Pevoto Direct) at 17.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE343\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          Cities agree with the arguments of State Agencies. fu addition, Cities stressed that if the\nCommission establishes a baseline for purchased power capacity costs, the baseline should reflect the\nunit cost of capacity rather than total dollars. Cities witness Nalepa testified that the unit cost would\nprovide a more accurate measure than total dollars. fu Cities• opinion, if a unit cost finding is not\nmade in this case, then Commission will be prevented from considering all options in the\nrulemak:ing.\n\n\n          TIEC points out that the notice in Project No. 39246 provided that \"[t]he purpose of this\nrulemak:ing project is to address the recovery of purchased power capacity costs considering\ngeneration embedded in base rates, load growth, and the impact of purchased power capacity\nrecovery on the financial standing of the utility.\" 1099 Accordingly, TIEC argues that the baseline set\nin this proceeding should reflect ETI' s total purchased power and installed capacity costs determined\nto be properly included in base rates on a total cost basis and on a per unit ($/MW) basis. 1100\n\n\n          As discussed in Section VII.A., the ALJ s find that the appropriate amount for ETI' s\npurchased power capacity expense to be included in base rates is $245,432,884. This responds to the\nissue included in the Commission's Supplemental Preliminary Order. This amount includes third-\nparty contracts, legacy affiliate contracts; other affiliate contracts; and reserve equalization. Whether\nthe amounts for all contracts should be included in the baseline for a purchased capacity rider that\nmay be approved in Project No. 39246 is an issue that should be decided in that proceeding, not in\nthe present case. Therefore, the ALJ s make no recommendation on that issue raised by the\nintervenors.\n\n\n                                     XIII.

PROPOSED FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW, AND\n                          ORDERING PARAGRAPHS\n\nA.     Findings of Fact\n\nProcedural History\n\n1.     Entergy Texas, Inc. (ETI or the Company) is an investor-owned electric utility with a retail\n       service area located in southeastern Texas.\n\n2.     ETI serves retail and wholesale electric customers in Texas. As of June 30, 2011, ETI served\n       approximately 412,000 Texas retail customers. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\n       (FERC) regulates ETI's wholesale electric operations.\n\n3.     On November 28, 2011, ETI filed an application requesting approval of: (1) a proposed\n       increase in annual base rate revenues of approximately $111.8 million over adjusted test year\n       revenues; (2) a set of proposed tariff schedules presented in the Electric Utility Rate Filing\n       Package for Generating Utilities (RFP) accompanying ETI' s application and including new\n       riders for recovery of costs related to purchased power capacity and renewable energy credit\n       requirements; (3) a request for final reconciliation of ETI's fuel and purchased power costs\n       for the reconciliation period from July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2011; and (4) certain waivers to\n       the instructions in RFP Schedule V accompanying ETI' s application.\n\n4.     The 12-month test year employed in ETI's filing ended on June 30, 2011 (Test Year).\n\n5.     ETI provided notice by publication for four consecutive weeks before the effective date of\n       the proposed rate change in newspapers having general circulation in each county of ETI' s\n       Texas service territory. ETI also mailed notice of its proposed rate change to all of its\n       customers. Additionally, ETI timely served notice of its statement of intent to change rates\n       on all municipalities retaining original jurisdiction over its rates and services.\n\n6.     The following parties were granted intervenor status in this docket: Office of Public Utility\n       Counsel (OPC); the cities of Anahuac, Beaumont, Bridge City, Cleveland, Conroe, Dayton,\n       Groves, Houston, Huntsville, Montgomery, Navasota, Nederland, Oak Ridge North, Orange,\n       Pine Forest, Rose City, Pinehurst, Port Arthur, Port Neches, Shenandoah, Silsbee, Sour Lake,\n       Splendora, Vidor, and West Orange (Cities), the Kroger Co. (Kroger); State Agencies (State\n       Agencies); Texas Industrial Energy Consumers (TIEC); East Texas Electric Cooperative, Inc.\n       (ETEC); the United States Department of Energy (DOE); and Wal-Mart Stores Texas, LLC,\n       and Sam's East, Inc. (Wal Mart). The Staff (Staff) of the Public Utility Commission of\n       Texas (Commission or PUC) was also a participant in this docket.\n\n7.     On November 29, 2011, the Commission referred this case to the State Office of\n       Administrative Hearings (SOAH).\n\fSOAHDOCKET N O . -                    PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE345\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n8.    On December 7, 2011, the Commission issued its order requesting briefing on threshold\n      legal/policy issues.\n\n9.    On December 19, 2011, the Commission issued its Preliminary Order, identifying 31 issues\n      to be addressed in this proceeding.\n\n10.   On December 20, 2011, the Administrative Law Judges (AUs) issued SOAH Order No. 2,\n      which approved an agreement among the parties to establish a June 30, 2012 effective date\n      for the Company's new rates resulting from this case pursuant to certain agreed language and\n      consolidate Application of Entergy Texas, Inc. for Authority to Defer Expenses Related to its\n      Proposed Transition to Membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator, Docket\n      No. 39741 (pending) into this proceeding. Although it did not agree, Staff did not oppose the\n      consolidation.\n\n11.   On January 13, 2012, the AU s issued SOAH Order No.4 granting the motions for admission\n      pro hac vice filed by Kurt J. Boehm and Jody M. Kyler to appear and participate as counsel\n      for Kroger and the motion for admission pro hac vice filed by Rick D. Chamberlain to appear\n      and participate as counsel for Wal-Mart.\n\n12.   On January 19, 2012, the Commission issued a Supplemental Preliminary Order identifying\n      two additional issues to be addressed in this case and concluding that the Company's\n      proposed purchased power capacity rider should not be addressed in this case and that such\n      costs should be recovered through base rates.\n\n13.   ETI timely filed with the Commission petitions for review of the rate ordinances of the\n      municipalities exercising original jurisdiction within its service territory. All such appeals\n      were consolidated for determination in this proceeding.\n\n14.   OnApril4, 2012, theAUs issued SOAH Order No. 13 severingratecaseexpenseissues into\n      Application of Entergy Texas, Inc. for Rate Case Expenses Severed from PUC Docket\n      No. 39896, Docket No. 40295 (pending).\n\n15.   On April 13, 2012, ETI adjusted its request for a proposed increase in annual base rate\n      revenues to approximately $104.8 million over adjusted Test Year revenues.\n\n16.   The hearing on the merits commenced on April 24 and concluded on May 4, 2012.\n\n17.   Initial post-hearing briefs were filed on May 18 and reply briefs were filed on May 30, 2012.\n\nRate Base\n\n18.   Capital additions that were closed to ETI's plant-in-service between July 1, 2009, and June\n      30, 2011, are used and useful in providing service to the public and were prudently incurred.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                   PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE346\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n19.   ETI's proposed Hurricane Rita regulatory asset was an issue resolved by the black-box\n      settlement in Application of Entergy Texas, Inc.for Authority to Change Rates and Reconcile\n      Fuel Costs, Docket No. 37744 (Dec. 13, 2010).\n\n20.   Accrual of carrying charges on the Hurricane Rita regulatory asset should have ceased when\n      Docket No. 37744 concluded because the asset would have then begun earning a rate of\n      return as part of rate base.\n\n21.   The appropriate calculation of the Hurricane Rita regulatory asset should begin with the\n      amount claimed by ETI in Docket No. 37744, less amortization accruals to the end of the\n      Test Year in the present case, and less the amount of additional insurance proceeds received\n      by ETI after the conclusion of Docket No. 37744.\n\n22.   A Test-Year-end balance of $15,175,563 for the Hurricane Rita regulatory asset should\n      remain in rate base, applying a five-year amortization rate beginning August 15, 2010.\n\n23.   The Hurricane Rita regulatory asset should not be moved to the storm damage insurance\n      reserve.\n\n24.   The Company requested in rate base its Prepaid Pension Assets Balance of $55,973,545,\n      which represents the accumulated difference between the Statement of Financial Accounting\n      Standards (SFAS) No. 87 calculated pension costs each year and the actual contributions\n      made by the Company to the pension fund.\n\n25.   The Prepaid Pension Assets Balance includes $25 ,311,236 capitalized to construction work\n      in progress (CWIP).\n\n26.   It is not necessary to the financial integrity of ETI to include CWIP in rate base, and there\n      was insufficient evidence showing that major projects under construction were efficiently\n      and prudently managed.\n\n27.   The portion of the Prepaid Pension Assets Balance that is capitalized to CWIP should not be\n      included in ETI' s rate base.\n\n28.   The remainder of the Prepaid Pension Assets Balance should be included in ETI' s rate base.\n\n29.   ETI should be permitted to accrue an allowance for funds used during construction on the\n      portion ofETI's Prepaid Pension Assets Balance capitalized to CWIP.\n\n30.   The Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) Financial Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48),\n      \"Accountingfor Uncertainty in Income Taxes,\" requires ETI to identify each of its uncertain\n      tax positions by evaluating the tax position on its technical merits to determine whether the\n      position, and the corresponding deduction, is more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the\n      Internal Revenue Service (IRS) if audited.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                    PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE347\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n31.   FIN 48 requires ETI to remove the amount of its uncertain tax positions from its\n      Accumulated Deferred Federal Income Tax (ADFIT) balance for financial reporting purposes\n      and record it as a potential liability with interest to better reflect the Company's financial\n      condition.\n\n32.   At Test Year-end, ETI had $5,916,461 in FIN 48 liabilities, meaning ETI has, thus far,\n      avoided paying to the IRS $5,916,461 in tax dollars (the FIN 48 Liability) in reliance upon\n      tax positions that the Company believes will not prevail in the event the positions are\n      challenged, via an audit, by the IRS.\n\n33.   ETI has deposited $1,294,683 with the IRS in connection with the FIN 48 Liability.\n\n34.   The IRS may never audit ETI as to its uncertain tax positions creating the FIN 48 Liability.\n\n35.   Even if ETI is audited, ETI might prevail on its uncertain tax positions.\n\n36.   ETI may never have to pay the IRS the FIN 48 Liability.\n\n37.   Other than the amount of its deposit with the IRS, ETI has current use of the FIN 48 Liability\n      funds.\n\n38.   Until actually paid to the IRS, the FIN 48 Liability represents cost-free capital and should be\n      deducted from rate base.\n\n39.   The amount of $4,621,778 (representing ETI's full FIN 48 Liability of $5,916,461 less the\n      $1,294,683 cash deposit ETI has made with the IRS for the FIN 48 Liability) should be added\n      to ETI' s AD FIT and thus be used to reduce ETI' s rate base.\n\n40.   ETI's application and proposed tariffs do not include a request for a tracking mechanism or\n      rider to collect a return on the FIN 48 Liability.\n\n41.   ETI has not proven that a tracking mechanism or rider to collect a return on FIN 48 Liability\n      is necessary.\n\n42.   Investor-owned electric utilities may include a reasonable allowance for cash working capital\n      in rate base as determined by a lead-lag study conducted in accordance with the\n      Commission's rules.\n\n43.   Cash working capital represents the amount of working capital, not specifically addressed in\n      other rate base items, that is necessary to fund the gap between the time expenditures are\n      made and the time corresponding revenues are received.\n\n44.   The lead-lag study conducted by ETI considered the actual operations of ETI, adjusted for\n      known and measurable changes, and isconsistentwithP.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.231(c)(2)(B)(iii).\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE348\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n45.   It is reasonable to establish ETI' s cash working capital requirement based on ETI' s lead-lag\n      study as updated in Jay Joyce's rebuttal testimony and on the cost of service approved for\n      ETI in this case.\n\n46.   As a result of the black-box settlements in Application of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. for\n      Authority to Change Rates and to Reconcile Fuel Costs, Docket No. 34800 (Nov. 7, 2008)\n      and Docket No. 37744, the Commission did not approve ETI' s storm damage expenses since\n      1996 and its storm damage reserve balance.\n\n47.   ETI established a primafacie case concerning the prudence of its storm damage expenses\n      incurred since 1996.\n\n48.   Adjustments to the storm damage reserve balance proposed by intervenors should be denied.\n\n49.   The Hurricane Rita regulatory asset should not be moved to the storm damage insurance\n      reserve.\n\n50.   ETI's appropriate Test-Year-end storm reserve balance was negative $59,799,744.\n\n51.   The amount of $9,846,037, representing the value of the average coal inventory maintained\n      at ETI' s coal-burning facilities, is reasonable, necessary, and should be included in rate base.\n\n52.   The Spindletop gas storage facility (Spindletop Facility) is used and useful in providing\n      reliable and flexible natural gas supplies to ETI' s Sabine Station and Lewis Creek generating\n      plants.\n\n53.   The Spindletop Facility is critical to the economic, reliable operation of the Sabine Station\n      and Lewis Creek generating plants due to their geographic location in the far western region\n      of the Entergy system.\n\n54.   It is reasonable and appropriate to include ETI' s share of the costs to operate the Spindletop\n      Facility in rate base.\n\n55.   Staff recommended updating ETI's balance amounts for short-term assets to the 13-month\n      period ending December 2011, which was the most recent information available. Staff's\n      proposed adjustments should be incorporated into the calculation of ETI's rate base.\n\n56.   The following short-term asset amounts should be included in rate base: prepayments at\n      $8,134,351; materials and supplies at $29,285,421; and fuel inventory at $52,693,485.\n\n57.   The amount of $1,127,778, representing costs incurred by ETI when it acquired the\n      Spindletop facility, represent actual costs incurred to process and close the acquisition, not\n      mere mark-up costs.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                     PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE349\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n58.   ETI' s $1, 127,778 in capitalized acquisition costs should be included in rate base because ETI\n      incurred these costs in conjunction with the purchase of a viable asset that benefits its retail\n      customers.\n\n59.    In its application, ETI capitalized into plant in service accounts some of the incentive\n       payments ETI made to its employees. ETI seeks to include those amounts in rate base.\n\n60.    A portion of those capitalized incentive accounts represent payments made by ETI for\n       incentive compensation tied to financial goals.\n\n61.    The portion of ETI' s incentive payments that are capitalized and that are financially-based\n       should be excluded from ETI' s rate base because the benefits of such payments inure most\n       immediately and predominantly to ETI's shareholders, rather than its electric customers.\n\n62.    The Test Year for ETI's prior ratemaking proceeding ended on June 30, 2009, and the\n       reasonableness of ETI' s capital cos ts (including capitalized incentive compensation) for that\n       prior period was dealt with by the Commission in that proceeding and is not at issue in this\n       proceeding.\n\n63.    In this proceeding, ETI' s capitalized incentive compensation that is financially-based should\n       be excluded from rate base, but only for incentive costs that ETI capitalized during the period\n       from July 1, 2009 (the endofthepriorTest Year)throughJune30, 2010 (the commencement\n       of the current Test Year).\n\nRate of Return and Cost of Capital\n\n64.    A return on common equity (ROE) of 9.80 percent will allow ETI a reasonable opportunity\n       to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital.\n\n65.    The results of the discounted cash flow model and risk premium approach support a ROE of\n       9.80 percent.\n\n66.    A 9.80 percent ROE is consistent with ETI's business and regulatory risk.\n\n67.    ETI's proposed 6.74 percent embedded cost of debt is reasonable.\n\n68.    The appropriate capital structure for ETI is 50.08 percent long-term debt and 49.92 percent\n       common equity.\n\n69.    A capital structure composed of 50.08 percent debt and 49.92 percent equity is reasonable in\n       light of ETI' s business and regulatory risks.\n\n70.    A capital structure composed of 50.08 percent debt and 49.92 percent equity will help ETI\n       attract capital from investors.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                     PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE350\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n71.

ETI's Test Year purchased capacity expenses were $245.432,884.\n\n73.    ETI requested an upward adjustment of $30,809,355 as a post-Test Year adjustment to its\n       purchased capacity costs. This request was based on ETI' s projections of its purchased\n       capacity expenses during a period beginning June 1, 2012 and ending May 31, 2013 (the Rate\n       Year).\n\n74.   ETI' s purchased capacity expense projections were based on estimates of Rate Year expenses\n      for: (a) reserve equalization payments under Schedule MSS-1; (b) payments under third-\n      party capacity contracts; and (c) payments under affiliate contracts.\n\n75.    ETI's projection of its Rate Year reserve equalization payments under Schedule MSS-1 is\n       based on numerous assumptions, including load growths for ETI and its affiliates, future\n       capacity contracts for ETI and its affiliates, and future values of the generation assets of ETI\n       and its affiliates.\n\n76.    There is substantial uncertainty with regard to ETI' s projection of its Rate Year reserve\n       equalization payments under Schedule MSS-1.\n\n77.    ETI' s projection of its Rate Year third-party capacity contract payments includes numerous\n       assumptions, one of which is that every single third-party supplier will perform at the\n       maximum level under the contract, even though that assumption is inconsistent with ETI' s\n       historical experience.\n\n78.    There is substantial uncertainty with regard to ETI' s projection of its Rate Year third-party\n       capacity contract payments.\n\n79.    ETI' s estimates of its Rate Year purchases under affiliate contracts are based on a\n       mathematical formula set out in Schedule MSS-4.\n\n80.    The MSS-4 formula for Rate Year affiliate capacity payments reflects that these payments\n       will be based on ratios and costs that cannot be determined until the month that the payments\n       are to be made.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                   PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE351\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n81.   Over $11 million ofETI's affiliate transactions were basedona2013 contract(theEAIWBL\n      Contract) that was not signed until April 11, 2012.\n\n82.   There is uncertainty about whether the EAI WBL Contract will ever go into effect.\n\n83.   ETI projects purchasing over 300 megawatts (MW) more in purchased capacity in the Rate\n      Year than it purchased in the Test Year.\n\n84.   ETI experienced substantial load growth in the two years before the Test Year, and it\n      continues to project similar load growth in the future.\n\n85.   ETI did not meet its burden of proof to demonstrate that a known and measurable adjustment\n      of $30,809,355 should be made to its Test Year purchased capacity expenses.\n\n86.   ETI's purchased capacity expense in this case should be based on the Test Year level of\n      $245 ,432,884.\n\n87.   ETI incurred $1,753,797 of transmission equalization expense during the Test Year.\n\n88.   ETI proposed an upward adjustment of $8,942, 785 for its transmission equalization expense.\n       This request was based on ETI' s projections of its transmission equalization expenses during\n      the Rate Year.\n\n89.   The transmission equalization expense that ETI will pay in the Rate Year will depend on\n      future costs and loads for each of the Entergy operating companies.\n\n90.   ETI's projection of its Rate Year transmission equalization expenses is uncertain and\n      speculative because it depends on a number of variables, including future transmission\n      investments, deferred taxes, depreciation reserves, costs of capital, tax rates, operating\n      expenses, and loads of each of the Entergy operating companies.\n\n91.   ETI seeks increased transmission equalization expenses for transmission projects that are not\n      currently used and useful in providing electric service. ETI's post-Test Year adjustment is\n      based on the assumption that certain planned transmission projects will go into service after\n      the Test Year. At the close of the hearing, none of the planned transmission projects had\n      been fully completed and some were still in the planning phase.\n\n92.   It is not reasonable for ETI to charge its retail ratepayers for transmission equalization\n      expenses related to projects that are not yet in-service.\n\n93.   ETI's request for a post-Test Year adjustment of $8,942,785 for Rate Year transmission\n      equalization expenses should be denied because those expenses are not known and\n      measurable. ETI' s post-Test Year adjustment does not with reasonable certainty reflect what\n      ETI' s transmission equalization expense will be when rates are in effect.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                     PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE352\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n94.    ETI' s transmission equalization expense in this case should be based on the Test Year level\n       of $1,753,797.\n\n95.    P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.231(c)(2)(ii) states that the reserve for depreciation is the accumulation\n       of recognized allocations of original cost, representing the recovery of initial investment over\n       the estimated useful life of the asset.\n\n96.    Except in the case of the amortization of the general plant deficiency, the use of the\n       remaining life depreciation method to recover differences between theoretical and actual\n       depreciation reserves is the most appropriate method and should be continued.\n\n97.    It is reasonable for ETI to calculate depreciation reserve allocations on a straight-line basis\n       over the remaining, expected useful life of the item or facility.\n\n98.    Except as described below, the service lives and net salvage rates proposed by the Company\n       are reasonable, and these service lives and net salvage rates should be used in calculating\n       depreciation rates for the Company's Production, Transmission, Distribution, and General\n       Plant assets.\n\n99.    A 60-year life for Sabine Units 4 and 5 is reasonable for purposes of establishing production\n       plant depreciation rates.\n\n100.   The retirement (actuarial) rate method, rather than the interim retirement method, should be\n       used in the development of production plant depreciation rates.\n\n101.   Production plant net salvage is reasonably based on the negative five percent net salvage in\n       existing rates.\n\n102.   The net salvage rate of negative 10 percent for ETI's transm1ss10n structures and\n       improvements (FERC Account 352) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be\n       adopted.\n\n103.   The net salvage rate of negative 20 percent for ETI' s transmission station equipment (FERC\n       Account 353) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be adopted.\n\n104.   The net salvage rate of negative five percent for ETI's transmission towers and fixtures\n       (FERC Account 354) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be adopted.\n\n105.   The net salvage rate of negative 30 percent for ETI's transmission poles and fixtures (FERC\n       Account 355) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be adopted.\n\n106.   The net salvage rate of negative 30 percent for ETI' s transmission overhead conductors and\n       devices (FERC Account 356) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be\n       adopted.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                     PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE353\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n107.   A service life of 65 years and a dispersion curve of R3 for ETI' s distribution structures and\n       improvements (FERC Account 361) are the most reasonable of those proposed and should be\n       approved.\n\n108.   A service life of 40 years and a dispersion curve of Rl for ETI's distribution poles, towers,\n       and fixtures (FERC Account 364) are the most reasonable of those proposed and should be\n       approved.\n\n109.   A service life of 39 years and a dispersion curve of R0.5 for ETI's distribution overhead\n       conductors and devices (FERC Account 365) are the most reasonable of those proposed and\n       should be approved.\n\n110.   A service life of 35 years and a dispersion curve of Rl.5 for ETI's distribution underground\n       conductors and devices (FERC Account 367) are the most reasonable of those proposed and\n       should be approved.\n\n111.   A service life of 33 years and a dispersion curve of L0.5 for ETI's distribution line\n       transformers (FERC Account 368) are the most reasonable of those proposed and should be\n       approved.\n\n112.   A service life of 26 years and a dispersion curve ofL4 for ETI' s distribution overhead service\n       (FERC Account 369.1) are the most reasonable of those proposed and should be approved.\n\n113.   The net salvage rate of negative five percent for ETI's distribution structures and\n       improvements (FERC Account 361) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be\n       adopted.\n\n114.   The net salvage rate of negative 10 percent for ETI' s distribution station equipment (FERC\n       Account 362) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be adopted.\n\n115.   The net salvage rate of negative seven percent for ETI' s distribution overhead conductors and\n       devices (FERC Account 365) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be\n       adopted.\n\n116.   The net salvage rate of negative five percent for ETI' s distribution line transformers (FERC\n       Account 368) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be adopted.\n\n117.   The net salvage rate of negative 10 percent for ETI' s distribution overhead services (FERC\n       Account 369.1) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be adopted.\n\n118.   The net salvage rate of negative 10 percent for ETI's distribution underground services\n       (FERC Account 369.2) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be adopted.\n\n119.   A service life of 45 years and a dispersion curve of R2 for ETI's general structures and\n       improvements (FERC Account 390) are the most reasonable of those proposed and should be\n       approved.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE354\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n120.   The net salvage rate of negative 10 percent for ETI's general structures and improvements\n       (FERC Account 390) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be adopted.\n\n121.   It is reasonable to convert the $21.3 million deficit that has developed over time in the\n       reserve for general plant accounts to General Plant Amortization.\n\n122.   A ten-year amortization of the deficit in the reserve for general plant accounts is reasonable\n       and should be adopted.\n\n123.   FERC pronouncement AR-15 requires amortization over the same life as recommended\n       based on standard life analysis. A standard life analysis determined that a five-year life was\n       appropriate for general plant computer equipment (FERC Account 390.2). Therefore, a five\n       year amortization for this account is reasonable and should be adopted.\n\n124.   ETI proposed adjustments to its Test Year payroll costs to reflect: (a) changes to employee\n       headcount levels at ETI and Entergy Services, Inc. (ESI); and (b) approved wage increases\n       set to go into effect after the end of the Test Year.\n\n125.   The proposed payroll adjustments are reasonable but should be updated to reflect the most\n       recent available information on headcount levels as proposed by Commission Staff. In\n       addition to adjusting payroll expense levels, the more recent headcount numbers should be\n       used to adjust the level of payroll tax expense, benefits expense, and savings plan expense.\n\n126.   Staff has appropriately updated headcount levels to the most recent available data but errors\n       made by Staff should be corrected. The corrections related to: (a) a double counting of three\n       ETI and one ESI employee; (b) inadvertent use of the ETI benefits cost percentage in the\n       calculation of ESI benefits costs; (c) an inappropriate reduction of savings plan costs when\n       such costs were already included in the benefits percentage adjustments; and (d) corrections\n       for full-time equivalents calculations. Staffs ETI headcount adjustment (AG-7) overstated\n       operation and maintenance (O&M) payroll reduction by $224,217, and ESI headcount\n       adjustment (AG-7) understated O&M payroll increase by $37,531.\n\n127.   ETI included $14,187,744 for incentive compensation expenses in its cost of service.\n\n128.   The compensation packages that ETI offers its employees include a base payroll amount,\n       annual incentive programs, and long-term incentive programs. The majority of the\n       compensation is for operational measures, but some is for financial measures.\n\n129.   Incentive compensation that is based on financial measures is of more immediate and\n       predominant benefit to shareholders, whereas incentive compensation based on operational\n       measures is of more immediate and predominant benefit to ratepayers.\n\n130.   Incentives to achieve operational measures are necessary and reasonable to provide utility\n       services but those to achieve financial measures are not.\n\f                             ~~···--····--------------------------\n\n\n\n\nSOAHDOCKETNO.-                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE355\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n131.   The $5,376,975 that was paid for long term incentive programs was tied to financial\n       measures and, therefore, should not be included in ETI' s cost of service.\n\n132.   Of the amounts that were paid pursuant to the Exeeutive Annual Incentive Plan, $819,062\n       was tied to financial measures and, therefore, should be disallowed.\n\n133.   In total, the amount of incentive compensation that should be disallowed is $6,196,037\n       because it was related to financial measures that are not reasonable and necessary for the\n       provision of electric service.\n\n134.   The amount of incentive compensation that should be included in the cost of service is\n       $7,991,707.\n\n135.   To attract and retain highly qualified employees, the Entergy Companies provide a total\n       package of compensation and benefits that is equivalent in scope and cost with what other\n       comparable companies within the utility business and other industries provide for their\n       employees.\n\n136.   When using a benchmark analysis to compare companies' levels of compensation, it is\n       reasonable to view the market level of compensation as a range rather than a precise, single\n       point.\n\n137.   ETI's base pay levels are at market.\n\n138.   ETI' s benefits plan levels are within a reasonable range of market levels.\n\n139.   ETI's level of compensation and benefits expense is reasonable and necessary.\n\n140.   ETI provides non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plans for highly compensated\n       individuals such as key managerial employees and executives that, because of limitations\n       imposed under the Internal Revenue Code, would otherwise not receive retirement benefits\n       on their annual compensation over $245,000 per year.\n\n141.   ETI' s non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plans are discretionary costs designed\n       to attract, retain, and reward highly compensated employees whose interests are more closely\n       aligned with those of the shareholders than the customers.\n\n142.   ETI's non-qualified executive retirement benefits in the amount of $2,114,931 are not\n       reasonable or necessary to provide utility service to the public, not in the public interest, and\n       should not be included in ETI' s cost of service.\n\n143.   For the employee market in which ETI operates, most peer companies offer moving\n       assistance. Such assistance is expected by employees, and ETI would be placed at a\n       competitive disadvantage if it did not offer relocation expenses.\n\n144.   ETI's relocation expenses were reasonable and necessary.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                     PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE356\nPUC DOCKET NO. 398%\n\n\n145.   The Company's requested operating expenses should be reduced by $40,620 to reflect the\n       removal of certain executive prerequisites proposed by Staff.\n\n146.   Staff properly adjusted the Company's requested interest expense of $68,985 by removing\n       $25,938 from FERC account 431 (using the interest rate of 0.12 percent for calendar year\n       2012), leaving a recommended interest expense of $43,047.\n\n147.   During the Test Year, ETI's property tax expense equaled $23,708,829.\n\n148.   ETI requested an upward proforma adjustment of $2,592,420, to account for the property tax\n       expenses ETI estimates it will pay in the Rate Year.\n\n149.   ETI' s requested proforma adjustment is not reasonable because it is based, in part, upon the\n       prediction that ETI' s property tax rate will be increased in 2012, a change that is speculative\n       is not known and measurable.\n\n150.   Staff's recommendation to increase ETI's Test Year property tax expenses by $1,214,688 is\n       based on the historical effective tax rate applied to the known Test Year-end plant in service\n       value, consistent with Commission precedent, and based upon known and measurable\n       changes.\n\n151.   ETI's Test Year property tax burden should be adjusted upward by $1,214,688.\n\n152.   Staff recommended reducing ETI's advertising, dues, and contributions expenses by $12,800.\n       The recommendation, which no party contested, should be adopted.\n\n153.   The final cost of service should reflect changes to cost of service that affect other\n       components of the revenue requirement such as the calculation of the Texas state gross\n       receipts tax, the local gross receipts tax, the PUC Assessment Tax and the Uncollectible\n       Expenses.\n\n154.   The Company's requested Federal income tax expense is reasonable and necessary.\n\n155.   ETI's request for $2,019,000 to be included in its cost of service to account for the\n       Company's annual decommissioning expenses associated with River Bend is not reasonable\n       because it is not based upon \"the most current information reasonably available regarding the\n       cost of decommissioning\" as required by P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.23l(b)(l)(F)(i).\n\n156.   Based on the most current information reasonably available, the appropriate level of\n       decommissioning costs to be included in ETI's cost of service is $1,126,000.\n\n157.   ETI's appropriate total annual self-insurance storm damage reserve expense is $8,270,000,\n       comprised of an annual accrual of $4,400,000 to provide for average annual expected storm\n       losses, plus an annual accrual of $3,870,000 for 20 years to restore the reserve from its\n       current deficit.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                     PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE357\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n158.   ETI's appropriate target self-insurance storm damage reserve is $17,595,000.\n\n159.   ETI should continue recording its annual storm damage reserve accrual until modified by a\n       Commission order.\n\n160.   The operating costs of the Spindletop Facility are reasonable and necessary.\n\n161.   The operating costs of the Spindletop Facility paid to PB Energy Storage Services are eligible\n       fuel expenses.\n\nAffiliate Transactions\n\n162.   ETI affiliates charged ETI $78,998,777 for services during the Test Year. The majority of\n       these O&M expenses-$69,098,041-were charged to ETI by ESL The remaining affiliate\n       services were charged (or credited) to ETI by: Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C.;\n       Entergy Arkansas, Inc.; Entergy Louisiana, LLC; Entergy Mississippi, Inc.; Entergy\n       Operations, Inc.; and non-regulated affiliates.\n\n163.   ESI follows a number of processes to ensure that affiliate charges are reasonable and\n       neces'sary and that ETI and its affiliates are charged the same rate for similar services. These\n       processes include: (a) the use of service agreements to define the level of service required\n       and the cost of those services; (b) direct billing of affiliate expenses where possible;\n       (c) reasonable allocation methodologies for costs that cannot be directly billed; (d) budgeting\n       processes and controls to provide budgeted costs that are reasonable and necessary to ensure\n       appropriate levels of service to its customers; and (e) oversight controls by ETI's Affiliate\n       Accounting and Allocations Department.\n\n164.   Affiliates charged expenses to ETI through 1292 project codes during the Test Year.\n\n165.   ETI agreed to remove the following affiliate transactions from its application:\n       (1) Project F3PPCASHCT (Contractual Alternative/Cashpo) in the amount of $2,553;\n       (2) Project F3PCSPETEI (Entergy-Tulane Energy Institute) in the amount of $14,288; and\n       (3) Project F5PPKATRPT (Storm Cost Processing & Review) in the amount of $929.\n\n166.   The $356,151 (which figure includes the $112,531 agreed to by ETI) of costs associated with\n       Projects F5PCZUBENQ (Non-Qualified Post Retirement) and F5PPZNQBDU (Non Qual\n       Pension/Benf Dom Utl) are costs that are not reasonable and necessary for the provision of\n       electric utility service and are not in the public interest.\n\n167.   The $10,279 of costs associated with Project F3PPFXERSP (Evaluated Receipts Settlement)\n       are not normally-recurring costs and should not be recoverable.\n\n168.   The $19,714 of costs associated with Project F3PPEASTIN (Willard Eastin et al) are related\n       to ESI's operations, it is more immediately related to Entergy Louisiana, Inc. and Entergy\n       New Orleans, Inc. As such, they are not recoverable from Texas ratepayers.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                       PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE358\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n169.    The $171,032 of costs associated with Project F3PPE9981 S (futegrated Energy Management\n        for ESI) are research and development costs related to energy efficiency programs. As such,\n        they should be recovered through the energy efficiency cost recovery factor rather than base\n        rates.\n\n170.    Except as noted in the above Findings of Fact Nos. 162-169, all remaining affiliate\n        transactions were reasonable and necessary, were allowable, were charged to ETI at a price\n        no higher than was charged by the supplying affiliate to other affiliates, and the rate charged\n        is a reasonable approximation of the cost of providing service.\n\nJurisdictional Cost Allocation\n\n171.    ETI has one full or partial requirements wholesale customer - East Texas Electric\n        Cooperative, fuc.\n\n172.    ETI proposes that 150 MW be set as the wholesale load for developing retail rates in this\n        docket. Using 150 MW to set the wholesale load is reasonable. The 150 MW used to set the\n        wholesale load results in a retail production demand allocation factor of 95.3838 percent.\n\n173.    The 12 Coincident Peak (12 CP) allocation method is consistent with the approach used by\n        the FERC to allocate between jurisdictions.\n\n174.    Using 12CP methodology to allocate production costs between the wholesale and retail\n        jurisdictions is the best method to reflect cost responsibility and is appropriate based on\n        ETI's reliance on capacity purchases.\n\nClass Cost Allocation and Rate Design\n\n17 5.   There is no express statutory authorization for ETI' s proposed Renewable Energy Credits\n        Rider (REC Rider).\n\n176.    REC Rider constitutes improper piecemeal ratemaking and should be rejected.\n\n177.    ETI' s Test Year expense for renewable energy credits, $623,303, is reasonable and necessary\n        and should be included in base rates.\n\n178.    Municipal Franchise Fees (MFF) is a rental expense paid by utilities for the right to use\n        public rights-of-way to locate its facilities within municipal limits.\n\n179.    ETI is an integrated utility system. ETI' s facilities located within municipal limits benefit all\n        customers, whether the customers are located inside or outside of the municipal limits.\n\n180.    Because all customers benefit from ETI's rental of municipal right-of-way, municipal\n        franchise fees should be charged to all customers in ETI' s service area, regardless of\n        geographic location.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE359\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n181.   It is reasonable and consistent with the Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA)§ 33.008(b)\n       that MFF be allocated to each customer class on the basis of in-city kilo-watt hour (kWH)\n       sales, without an adjustment for the MFF rate in the municipality in which a givenkWH sale\n       occurred.\n\n182.   The same reasons for allocating and collecting MFF as set out in Finding of Fact Nos. 178-\n       181 also apply to the allocation and collection of Miscellaneous Gross Receipts Taxes. The\n       Company's proposed allocation of these costs to all retail customer classes based on\n       customer class revenues relative to total revenues is appropriate.\n\n183.   The Average and Excess (A&E) 4CP method for allocating capacity-related production costs,\n       including reserve equalization payments, to the retail classes is a standard methodology and\n       the most reasonable methodology.\n\n184.   The A&E 4CP method for allocating transmission costs to the retail classes is standard and\n       the most reasonable methodology.\n\n185.   ETI appropriately followed the rate class revenue requirements from its cost of service study\n       to allocate costs among customer classes. ETI' s revenue allocation properly sets rates at each\n       class's cost of service.\n\n186.   It is reasonable for ETI to eliminate the service condition for Rate Groups A and C in\n       Schedule SHL [Street and Highway Lighting Service] that charges a $50 fee for any\n       replacement of a functioning light with a lower-wattage bulb.\n\n187.   It is appropriate to require ETI to prepare and file, as part of its next base rate case, a study\n       regarding the feasibility of instituting LED-based rates and, if the study shows that such rates\n       are feasible, ETI should file proposals for LED-based lighting and traffic signal rates it next\n       rate case.\n\n188.   An agreement was reached by the parties and approved by the Commission in Docket\n       No. 37744 that directed ETI to exclude, in its next rate case, the life-of-contract demand\n       ratchet for existing customers in the Large Industrial Power Service (LIPS), Large Industrial\n       Power Service-Time of Day, General Service, General Service-Time of Day, Large General\n       Service, and Large General Service-Time of Day rate schedules.\n\n189.   ETl's proposed tariffs in this case did not remove the life-of-contract demand ratchet from\n       these rate schedules consistent with the parties' agreement in Docket No. 37744.\n\n190.   A perpetual billing obligation based on a life-of-contract demand ratchet, as ETI proposed, is\n       not reasonable.\n\n191.   ETI's proposed LIPS and LIPS Time of Day tariffs should be modified to reflect the\n       agreement that was adopted by the Commission as just and reasonable in Docket No. 37744.\n       Accordingly, these tariffs should be modified as set out in Findings of Fact No. 192-194.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE360\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n192.   ETI' s Schedule LIPS and LIPS Time of Day § VI should be changed to read:\n\n                      DETERMINATION OF BILLING LOAD\n\n                      The kW of Billing Load will be the greatest of the following:\n\n                      (A) The Customer's maximum measured 30-minute demand\n                      during any 30-minute interval of the current billing month,\n                      subject to§§ III, IV and V above; or\n\n                      (B) 60% of Contract Power as defined in § VII; or\n\n                      (C) 2,500 kW.\n\n193.   ETI' s Schedule LIPS and LIPS Time of Day § VII should be changed to read:\n\n                      DETERMINATION OF CONTRACT POWER\n\n                      Unless Company gives customer written notice to the contrary,\n                      Contract Power will be defined as below:\n\n                      Contract Power - the highest load established under § Vl(A) above\n                      during the 12 months ending with the current month. For the initial\n                      12 months of Customer's service under the currently effective\n                      contract, the Contract Power shall be the kW specified in the\n                      currently effective contract unless exceeded in any month during the\n                      initial 12-month period.\n\n194.   The Large General Service and Large General Service-Time of Day schedules should be\n       similarly revised to eliminate ETI's life-of-contract demand ratchet.\n\n195.   In its proposed rate design for the LIPS class, the Company took a conservative approach and\n       increased the current rates by an equal percentage. This minimized customer bill impacts\n       while maintaining cost causation principles on a rate class basis.\n\n196.   It is a reasonable move towards cost of service to add a customer charge of $630 to the LIPS\n       rate schedule with subsequent increases to be considered in subsequent base rate cases.\n\n197.   It is a reasonable move towards cost of service to slightly decrease the LIPS energy charges\n       and increase the demand charges as proposed by Staff witness William B. Abbott.\n\n198.   DOE proposed a new Schedule LIPS rider-Schedule \"Schedulable Intermittent Pumping\n       Service\" (SIPS) for load schedulable at least four weeks in advance, that occurs in the off-\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE361\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n       season (November through April), that can be cancelled at any time, and for load not lasting\n       more than 80 hours in a year. For customers whose loads match these SIPS characteristics\n       (for example, DOE's Strategic Petroleum Reserve), the 12-month demand ratchet provision\n       of Schedule LIPS does not apply to demands set under the provisions of the SIPS rider. The\n       monthly demand set under the SIPS provisions would be applicable for billing purposes only\n       in the month in which it occurred. In short, if a customer set a 12-month ratchet demand in\n       that month, it would be forgiven and not applicable in the succeeding 12 months.\n\n199.   DOE' s proposed Schedule SIPS is not restricted solely to the DOE and should be adopted. It\n       more closely addresses specific customer characteristics and provides for cost-based rates, as\n       does another ETI rider applicable to Pipeline Pumping Service.\n\n200.   Standby Maintenance Service (SMS) is available to customers who have their own\n       generation equipment and who contract for this service from ETI.\n\n201.   P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.242(k)(l) provides that rates for sales of standby and maintenance\n       power to qualifying facilities should recognize system wide costing principles and should not\n       be discriminatory.\n\n202.   It is reasonable to move Schedule SMS toward cost of service by: (a) adding a customer\n       charge equivalent to that of the LIPS rate schedule only for SMS customers not purchasing\n       supplementary power under another applicable rate; and (b) revising the tariff as follows:\n\n                                        Distribution         Transmission\n                        Charge\n                                     (less than 69KV)     (69KV and greater)\n                     Billing Load Charge ($/kW):\n                     Standby            $2.46                    $0.79\n                     Maintenance        $2.27                    $0.60\n                     Non-Fuel Enernv Charge (¢/kWh)\n                     On-Peak           0.881¢                   0.846¢\n                     Off-Peak          0.575¢                   0.552¢\n\n\n203.   ETI's Additional Facilities Charge Rider (Schedule AFC) prescribes the monthly rental\n       charge paid by a customer when ETI installs facilities for that customer that would not\n       normally be supplied, such as line extensions, transformers, or dual feeds.\n\n204.   ETI existing Schedule AFC provides two pricing options. Option A is a monthly charge.\n       Option B, which applies when a customer elects to amortize the directly-assigned facilities\n       over a shorter term ranging from one to ten years, has a variable monthly charge. There is\n       also a term charge that applies after the facility has been fully depreciated.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE362\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n205.   It is reasonable and cost-based to reduce the Schedule AFC Option A rate to 1.20 percent per\n       month of the installed cost of all facilities included in the agreement for additional facilities.\n\n206.   It is reasonable and cost-based to reduce the Schedule AFC Option B monthly rate and the\n       Post Term Recovery Charge as follows:\n\n\n       Selected Recovery Term        Recovery Term Charge        Post Recovery Term Charge\n                    1                        10.88%                          0.35%\n                   2                         5.39%                           0.35%\n                   3                         3.92%                           0.35%\n                   4 '                       3.20%                           0.35%\n                   5                         2.76%                           0.35%\n                   6                         2.48%                           0.35%\n                   7                         2.28%                           0.35%\n                   8                         2.14%                           0.35%\n                   9                          1.97%                          0.35%\n                   10                         1.94%                          0.35%\n\n\n207.   The revisions in the above Findings of Fact to Schedule AFC rates reasonably reflect the\n       costs of running, operating, and maintaining the directly-assigned facilities.\n\n208.   It is reasonable to modify the Large General Service rate schedule by increasing the demand\n       charge from $10.25 to $12.81; decreasing the energy charge from $.01023 to $.00513; and\n       maintaining the customer charge at $425.05.\n\n209.   Staffs proposed change to the General Service (GS) rate schedule to gradually move GS\n       customers towards their cost of service by recommending a decrease in the customer charge\n       from the current rate of $41.09 to $39.91, and a decrease in the energy charges is reasonable\n       and should be adopted.\n\n210.   ETI's Residential Service (RS) rate schedule is composed of two elements: a customer\n       charge of $5 per month and a consumption-based energy charge. The Energy charge is a\n       fixed rate of 5.802¢ per kWh from May through October (Summer). In the months\n       November through April (Winter), the rates are structured as a declining block, in which the\n       price of each unit is reduced after a defined level of usage.\n\n211.   ETI' s Schedule RS declining block rate structure is contrary to energy efficiency efforts and\n       the Legislature's goal of reducing both energy demand and energy consumption in Texas, as\n       stated in PURA§ 39.905.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE363\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n212.   Schedule RS winter block rates should be modified consistent with the goal set out in PURA\n       § 39.905, with the initial phase-in of a 20 percent reduction in the block differential proposed\n       by ETI and subsequent reductions should be reviewed for consideration at the occurrence of\n       each rate case filing.\n\n213.   Other elements of Schedule RS are just and reasonable.\n\nFuel Reconciliation\n\n214.   ETI incurred $616,248,686 in natural-gas expenses during the Reconciliation Period, which\n       is from July 2009 through June 2011.\n\n215.   ETI purchased natural gas in the monthly and daily markets and pursuant to a long-term\n       contract with Enbridge Inc. pipeline. ETI also transported gas on its own account and\n       negotiated operational balancing agreements with various pipeline companies.\n\n216.   ETI employed a diversified portfolio of gas supply and transportation agreements to meet its\n       natural-gas requirements, and ETI prudently managed its gas-supply contracts.\n\n217.   ETI's natural gas expenses were reasonable and necessary expenses incurred to provide\n       reliable electric service to retail customers.\n\n218.   ETI incurred $90,821,317 in coal expenses during the Reconciliation Period.\n\n219.   ETI prudently managed its coal and coal-related contracts during the Reconciliation Period.\n\n220.   ETI monitored and audited coal invoices from Louisiana Generating, LLC for coal burned at\n       the Big Cajun II, Unit 3 facility.\n\n221.   ETI's coal expenses were reasonable and necessary expenses incurred to provide reliable\n       electric service to retail customers.\n\n222.   ETI incurred $990,041,434 in purchased-energy expenses during the Reconciliation Period.\n\n223.   The Entergy System's planning and procurement processes for purchased power produced a\n       reasonable mix of purchased resources at a reasonable price.\n\n224.   During the Reconciliation Period, ETI took advantage of opportunities in the fuel and\n       purchased-power markets to reduce costs and to mitigate against price volatility.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE364\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n225.   ETI's purchased-energy expenses were reasonable and necessary expenses incurred to\n       provide reliable electric service to retail customers.\n\n226.   ETI provided sufficient contemporaneous documentation to support the reasonableness of its\n       purchased-power planning and procurement processes and its actual power purchases during\n       the Reconciliation Period.\n\n227.   The Entergy system sold power off system when the revenues were expected to be more than\n       the incremental cost of supplying generation for the sale, subject to maintaining adequate\n       reserves.\n\n228.   The System Agreement is the tariff approved by the FERC that provides the basis for the\n       operation and planning of the Entergy system, including the six Operating Companies. The\n       System Agreement governs the wholesale-power transactions among the Operating\n       Companies by providing for joint operation and establishing the bases for equalization\n       among the Operating Companies, including the costs associated with the construction,\n       ownership, and operation of the Entergy system facilities.\n\n229.   Under the terms of the Entergy System Agreement, ETI was allocated its share of revenues\n       and expenses from off-system sales.\n\n230.   During the Reconciliation Period, ETI recorded off-system sales revenue in the amount of\n       $376,671,969 in FERC Account 447 and credited 100 percent of off-system sales revenues\n       and margins from off-system sales to eligible fuel expenses.\n\n231.   ETI properly recorded revenues from off-system sales and credited those revenues to eligible\n       fuel costs.\n\n232.   The Entergy system consists of six Operating Companies, including ETI, which are planned\n       and operated as a single, integrated electric system under the terms of the System Agreement.\n\n233.   Service Schedule MSS-1 of the System Agreement determines how the capability and\n       ownership costs of reserves for the Entergy system are equalized among the Operating\n       Companies. These inter-system \"reserve equalization\" payments are the result of a formula\n       rate related to the Entergy system's reserve capability that is applied on a monthly basis.\n\n234.   Reserve capability under Service Schedule MSS-1 is capability in excess of the Entergy\n       system's actual or planned load built or acquired to ensure the reliable, efficient operation of\n       the electric system.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE365\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n235.   By approving Service Schedule MSS-1, the FERC has approved the method by which the\n       Operating Companies share the cost of maintaining sufficient reserves to provide reliability\n       for the Entergy system as a whole.\n\n236.   Service Schedule MSS-3 of the System Agreement determines the pricing and exchange of\n       energy among the Operating Companies. By approving Service Schedule MSS-3, the FERC\n       has approved the method by which the Operating Companies are reimbursed for energy sold\n       to the exchange energy pool and how that energy is purchased.\n\n237.   Service Schedule MSS-4 of the System Agreement sets forth the method for determining the\n       payment for unit power purchases between Operating Companies. By approving Service\n       Schedule MSS-4, the FERC has approved the methodology for pricing Inter-Operating\n       Company unit power purchases.\n\n238.   The Entergy system is planned using multi-year, annual, seasonal, monthly, and next-day\n       horizons. Once the planning process has identified the most economical resources that can\n       be used to reliably meet the aggregate Entergy system demand, the next step is to procure the\n       fuel necessary to operate the generating units as planned and acquire wholesale power from\n       the market.\n\n239.   Once resources are procured to meet forecasted load, the Entergy system is operated during\n       the current day using all the resources available to meet the total Entergy system demand.\n\n240.   After current-day operation, the System Agreement prescribes an accounting protocol to bill\n       the costs of operating the system to the individual Operating Companies. This protocol is\n       implemented via the Intra-System Bill (ISB) to each Operating Company on a monthly basis.\n\n241.   ETI purchased power from affiliated Operating Companies per the terms of Service\n       Schedule MSS-3 of the System Agreement. The payments made under Schedule MSS-3 to\n       affiliated Operating Companies are reasonable and necessary, and the FERC has approved\n       the pricing formula and the obligation to purchase the energy. ETI pays the same price per\n       megawatt hour for energy under Service Schedule MSS-3 as does any other Operating\n       Company purchasing energy under Service Schedule MSS-3 during the same hour.\n\n242.   The Spindletop Facility is used primarily to ensure gas-supply reliability and guard against\n       gas-supply curtailments that can occur as a result of extreme weather or other unusual events.\n\n243.   The Spindletop Facility provides a secondary benefit of flexibility in gas supply. ETI can\n       back down gas-fired generation to take advantage of more economical wholesale power, or\n       use gas from storage to supplement gas-fired generation when load increases during the day\n       and thereby avoid more expensive intra-day gas purchases.\n\fSOAHDOCKET N O . -                     PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE366\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n244.   ETI' s customers received benefits from the Spindletop Facility during the Reconciliation\n       Period through reliable gas supplies and ETI's monthly and daily storage activity.\n\n245.   ETI prudently managed the Spindletop Facility to provide reliability and flexibility of gas\n       supply for the benefit of customers.\n\n246.   ETI proposed new loss factors, based on a December 2010 line loss study, to be applied for\n       the purpose of allocating its costs to its wholesale customers and retail customer classes.\n\n247.   ETI's proposed loss factors are reasonable and shall be implemented on a prospective basis\n       as a result of this final order.\n\n248.   ETI seeks a special-circumstances exception to recover $99,715 resulting from the FERC's\n       reallocation of rough production equalization costs in FERC Order No. 720-A, and to treat\n       such costs as eligible fuel expense.\n\n249.   Special circumstances exist and it is appropriate for recovery of the rough production cost\n       equalization costs reallocated to ETI as a result of the FERC' s decision in Order No. 720-A.\n\nOther Issues\n\n250.   A deferred accounting of ETI' s Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator (MISO)\n       transition expenses is not necessary to carry out any requirement of PURA.\n\n251.   ETI should include $2.4 million in base rates for MISO transition expense incurred on or\n       after January 2, 2011, based on a five-year amortization of $12 million in total projected\n       expenses.\n\n252.   ETI should include an additional $52,800 in base rates for MISO transition expenses incurred\n       during the 2010 portion of the Test Year, based on a five-year amortization of $263,908 in\n       such expenses.\n\n253.   Transmission Cost Recovery Factor baseline values should be set during the compliance\n       phase of this docket, after the Commission makes final rulings on the various contested\n       issues that may affect this calculation.\n\n254.   Distribution Cost Recovery Factor baseline values should be set during the compliance phase\n       of this docket, after the Commission makes final rulings on the various contested issues that\n       may affect this calculation.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                      PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE367\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n25 5.   The appropriate amount for ETI' s purchased power capacity expense to be included in base\n        rates is $245,432,884.\n\n256.     The amount of ETI's purchased power capacity expense includes third-party contracts,\n        legacy affiliate contracts, other affiliate contracts, and reserve equalization. Whether the\n        amounts for all contracts should be included in the baseline for a purchased capacity rider\n        that may be approved in Project No. 39246 is an issue that should be decided in that project.\n\nB.      Conclusions of Law\n\n1.      ETI is a \"public utility\" as that term is defined in PURA § 11.004( 1) and an \"electric utility\"\n        as that term is defined in PURA§ 31.002(6).\n\n2.      The Commission exercises regulatory authority over ETI and jurisdiction over the subject\n        matter of this application pursuant to PURA §§ 14.001, 32.001, 32.101, 33.002, 33.051,\n        36.101-.111, and 36.203.\n\n3.      SOAH has jurisdiction over matters related to the conduct of the hearing and the preparation\n        of a proposal for decision in this docket, pursuant to PURA§ 14.053 and TEX. GOY'TCODE\n        ANN. § 2003.049.\n\n4.      This docket was processed in accordance with the requirements of PURA and the Texas\n        Administrative Procedure Act, TEX. Gov'T CODE ANN. Chapter 2001.\n\n5.      ETI provided notice of its application in compliance with PURA§ 36.103, P.U.C. PROC.\n        R. 22.51(a), and P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.235(b)(l)-(3).\n\n6.      Pursuant to PURA § 33.001, each municipality in ETI's service area that has not ceded\n        jurisdiction to the Commission has jurisdiction over the Company's application, which seeks\n        to change rates for distribution services within each municipality.\n\n7.      Pursuant to PURA § 33.051, the Commission has jurisdiction over an appeal from a\n        municipality's rate proceeding.\n\n8.      ETI has the burden of proving that the rate change it is requesting is just and reasonable\n        pursuant to PURA § 36.006.\n\n9.      In compliance with PURA§ 36.051, ETI's overall revenues approved in this proceeding\n        permit ETI a reasonable opportunity to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital used\n        and useful in providing service to the public in excess of its reasonable and necessary\n        operating expenses.\n\f                                                                                      ----------------\n\n\n\nSOAH DOCKET N O . -                   PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE368\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n10.   Consistent with PURA § 36.053, the rates approved in this proceeding are based on original\n      cost, less depreciation, of property used and useful to ETI in providing service.\n\n11.   The ADFIT adjustments approved in this proceeding are consistent with PURA§ 36.059 and\n      P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.23l(c)(2)(C)(i).\n\n12.   Including the cash working capital approved in this proceeding in ETI's rate base is\n      consistent with P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.23l(c)(2)(B)(iii)(IV), which allows a reasonable\n      allowance for cash working capital to be included in rate base.\n\n13.   The ROE and overall rate of return authorized in this proceeding are consistent with the\n      requirements of PURA §§ 36.051 and 36.052.\n\n14.   The affiliate expenses approved in this proceeding and included in ETI's rates meet the\n      affiliate payment standards articulated in PURA §§ 36.051, 36.058, and Railroad\n      Commission of Texas v. Rio Grande Valley Gas Co., 683 S.W.2d 783 (Tex. App.-Austin\n      1984, no writ).\n\n15.   The ADFIT adjustments approved in this proceeding are consistent with PURA§ 36.059 and\n      P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.231(c)(2)(C)(i).\n\n16.   Pursuant to P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.231(b)(l)(F), the decommissioning expense approved in\n      this case is based on the most current information reasonably available regarding the cost of\n      decommissioning, the balance of funds in the decommissioning trust, anticipated escalation\n      rates, the anticipated return on the funds in the decommissioning trust, and other relevant\n      factors.\n\n17.   ETI has demonstrated that its eligible fuel expenses during the Reconciliation Period were\n      reasonable and necessary expenses incurred to provide reliable electric service to retail\n      customers as required by P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.236(d)(l)(A). ETihas properly accounted for\n      the amount of fuel-related revenues collected pursuant to the fuel factor during the\n      Reconciliation Period as required by P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.236(d)(l)(C).\n\n18.   ETI prudently managed the dispatch, operations, and maintenance of its fossil plants during\n      the Reconciliation Period.\n\n19.   The Reconciliation Period level operating and maintenance expenses for the Spindletop\n      Facility are eligible fuel expenses pursuant to P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.236(a).\n\n20.   Special circumstances are warranted pursuant to P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.236(a)(6) to recover\n      rough production equalization payments reallocated to ETI by the FERC.\n\fSOAR DOCKET N O . -                      PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                 PAGE369\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n21.

Proposed Ordering Paragraphs\n\n       In accordance with these findings of fact and conclusions of law, the Commission issues the\nfollowing orders:\n\n\n1.     The Proposal for Decision prepared by the SOAH ALls is adopted to the extent consistent\n       with this Order.\n\n2.     ETI' s application is granted to the extent consistent with this Order.\n\n3.     ETI shall file tariffs consistent with this Order within 20 days of the date of this Order. No\n       later than ten days after the date of the tariff filings, Staff shall file its comments\n       recommending approval, modification, or rejection of the individual sheets of the tariff\n       proposal. Responses to the Staffs recommendation shall be filed no later than 15 days after\n       the filing of the tariff. The Commission shall by letter approve, modify, or reject each tariff\n       sheet, effective the date of the letter.\n\n4.     The tariff sheets shall be deemed approved and shall be become effective on the expiration of\n       20 days from the date of filing, in the absence of written notification of modification or\n       rejection by the Commission. If any sheets are modified or rejected, ETI shall file proposed\n       revisions of those sheets in accordance with the Commission's letter within ten days of the\n       date of that letter, and the review procedure set out above shall apply to the revised sheets.\n\n5.     Copies of all tariff-related filings shall be served on all parties of record.\n\n6.     ETI shall prepare and file as part of its next base rate case a study regarding the feasibility of\n       instituting LED-based rates and, if the study shows that such rates are feasible, ETI should\n       file proposals for LED-based lighting and traffic signal rates in that case. If ETI has LED\n       lighting customers taking service, the study shall include detailed information regarding\n       differences in the cost of serving LED and non-LED lighting customers. ETI shall provide\n       the results of this study to Cities and interested parties as soon as practicable but no later than\n       the filing of its next rate case.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                  PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE370\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n7.

Considered in light of (1) the pre-filed testimony by the parties entered into evidence and\n       (2) the additional evidence and testimony admitted during the course of the hearing on\n       the merits on the Company's application, the stipulation is the result of compromise from\n       each signatory, and these efforts, as well as the overall result of the stipulation viewed in\n       light of the record evidence as a whole, support the reasonableness and benefits of the\n       terms of the stipulation.\n\fPUC D()(ket No. 37744                          Order                                      Page 11of15\nSOAH D()(ket No.\n\n\n35.    The evidence addressed in finding of fact 34 demonstrates that the rates, tenns, and\n       conditions resulting from the stipulation are just and reasonable and consistent with the\n       public interest.\n\n36.    The total level of the Texas retail revenue requirement contemplated by the stipulation\n       will allow ETI the opportunity to earn a reasonable return over and above its reasonable\n       and necessary operating expense.\n\n37.    The stipulated revenue requirement is consistent with applicable provisions of PURA\n       chapter 36 and the Commission's rules.\n\n38.    To the extent that affiliate costs are included in the stipulated revenue requirement and\n        fuel expense, they are reasonable and necessary for each class of affiliate costs presented\n        in ETI's application.\n\n39.    To the extent that affiliate costs are included in the stipulated revenue requirement and\n        fuel expense, the price charged to ETI is not higher than the prices charged by the\n       supplying affiliate for the same item or class of items to its other affiliates or divisions, or\n       a non-affiliated person within the same market area or having the same market\n       conditions.\n\n40.    The retail revenue requirement in the stipulation does not include any expenses\n       prohibited from recovery under PURA.\n\n41 .   A return on equity of 10.125% and a weighted average cost of capital of 8.5209% for ETI\n       should be adopted consistent with the stipulation.\n\n42.    The agreed rate-design provisions and terms and conditions of service included in the\n       stipulation are just and reasonable.\n\n43.    The treatment of rate-case expenses described in the stipulation is reasonable.\n\n44.    The Company's proposed remote-communications-link: rider as filed by the Company\n        is reasonable.\n\n45.    The depreciation rates agreed to in the stipulation are just and reasonable.\n\fPUC Docket No. 37744                              Order                               Page 12of15\nSOAH Docket No\n\n\n46.    The recovery of $2,019,000 annually for decommissioning costs of nuclear production\n       assets based on the factors agreed to in the stipulation is reasonable.\n\n47.    A $3.65 million annual storm cost accrual is reasonable.\n\n48.    The class allocation methodologies described in the stipulation are just and reasonable.\n\n49.    The fuel and lPCR-related provisions of the stipulation are reasonable.\n\n\n                                     ll.     Conclusions of Law\n1.     ETI is a public utility as that term is defined in PURA § 11.004( l) and an electric utility\n       as that term is defined in PURA§ 31 .002(6).\n\n2.     The Commission exercises regulatory authority over ETI and jurisdiction over the subject\n       matter of this application pursuant to PURA§§ 14.001, 32.001, 32.101 , 33.002, 33.051,\n       36.001- .111, 36.203, 39.452, and 39.455.\n\n3.     SOAH has jurisdiction over matters related to the conduct of the hearing and the\n       preparation of a proposal for decision in this docket, pursuant to PURA § 14.053 and\n       TEX. Gov'T CODE ANN. § 2003.049.\n\n4.     This docket was processed in accordance with the requirements of PURA, the Texas\n       Administrative Procedure Act,8 and Commission rules.\n\n5.     ETC provided notice of its application in compliance with PURA§ 36.103, P.U.C. PROC.\n       R. 22.5l(a), and P.U.C.     SUBST.   R. 25.235(b)(l)-(3).\n\n6.     This docket contains no remaining contested issues of fact or law.\n\n7.     The stipulation, taken as a whole, is a just and reasonable resolution of all issues it\n       addresses; results in just and reasonable rates, terms, and conditions; is supported by a\n       preponderance of the credible evidence in the record; is consistent with the relevant\n       provisions of PURA; and is consistent with the public interest.\n\n8.     ETI has properly accounted for the amount of fuel and IPCR-related revenues collected\n       pursuant to the fuel factor and Rider lPCR.\n\n\n       8\n           TEX. Gov'T CODE ANN. Chapter 2001 (Vernon 2007 and Supp. 2009).\n\fPUC Docket No. 37744                           Order                                  Page 13 of IS\nSOAH Docket No.\n\n\n9.     The revenue requirement, cost allocation, revenue distribution, and rate design\n       implementing the stipulation result in rates that are just and reasonable, comply with the\n       ratemaking provisions in PURA, and are not unreasonably discriminatory, preferential, or\n       prejudicial.\n\n10.    Based on the evidence in this docket, the overall total invested capital through the end of\n       the test year meets the requirement in PURA § 36.053(a) that electric utility rates be\n       based on the original cost, less depreciation, of property used by and useful to the utility\n       in providing service.\n\n11.    ETI has met its burden of proof in demonstrating that it is entitled to the level of retail\n       base rate and rider revenue set out in the stipulation.\n\n12.    ETI has met its burden of proof in demonstrating that the rates resulting from the\n       stipulation are just and reasonable, and consistent with PURA.\n\n\n                                 III.    Ordering Paragraphs\nl.     ETI's application seeking authority to change its rates; reconcile its fuel and purchased\n       power costs for the Reconciliation Period from April 1, 2007 to June 30, 2009; and for\n       other related relief is approved consistent with the above findings of fact and conclusions\n       of law.\n\n2.     Rates, terms, and conditions consistent with the stipulation are approved.\n\n3.     The tariffs and riders consistent with the stipulation are approved for the initial and\n       second step rate increases.\n\n4.     ETI's request for waivers of RFP instructions (RFP Schedule V) is granted.\n\n5.     ETI shall adjust decommissioning expense related to the River Bend Nuclear Generating\n       Station consistent with the terms of this Order.\n\n6.     Neither the stipulation and settlement agreement nor this Order constitutes the\n       Commission's agreement with, or consent to, the manner in which ETI, or any entity\n       affiliated with ETI, has interacted with any decommissioning trust to which ETI or its\n       ratepayers have made contributions or provided funds. Furthermore, this Order in no\n\fPUC Docket No. 37744                           Order                                   Page 14 of IS\nSOAH Docket No.-\n\n\n       way constitutes a waiver or release of any conduct, whether or not such conduct occurred\n       before the date of this Order, that may constitute a violation of any provision of state law,\n       including, without limitation, the rules and regulations of this Commission relating to\n       nuclear decommissioning trust funds; or prevents the Staff of the Commission from\n       opening an investigation and taking enforcement action relating to violations of such\n       rules and regulations.\n\n7.     Nothing contained in this Order constitutes the consent or approval, explicit or implied,\n       of any modification, amendment or clarification of any power purchase             agr~ement\n\n       between ETI and any other Entergy entity relating to the River Bend Station. Without\n       limiting the foregoing, nothing contained in this Order shall constitute the consent or\n       approval of any modification, amendment, or clarification of any power purchase\n       agreement between ETI and any other Entergy entity relating to the River Bend Station,\n       which is made to address any concerns raised by the NRC in its Request for Additional\n       Infonnation regarding the River Bend Station dated March 11 , 2010.\n\n8.     The Rider IPCR costs and eligible fuel costs requested by ETI are, consistent with this\n       Order, reconciled through June 30, 2009, and are approved consistent with the\n       stipulation.\n\n9.     ETI shall adjust its fuel over/under recovery balance consistent with the findings in this\n       Order.\n\nI 0.   ETI shall file an RPCEA Rider consistent with the above findings of fact and conclusions\n       of law to be effective with the first billing cycle of the billing month immediately\n       following the effective date of this Order ..\n\n11.    Because the final approved r~tes are equal to or higher than the interim rates adopted in\n       Order No. 3, no refund of the interim rates authorized by Order No. 3 is necessary.\n\n12.    The interim rates approved in Order No. 12 are herby approved for the initial step rate\n       increase contemplated by the stipulation, and ETI shall implement the second step rates\n       for bills rendered on and after May 2, 20 11, the first billing cycle for the revenue month\n       of May.\n\fPUC Docket No. 37744                                 Order                                Page 15of15\nSOAH Docket No. ~\n\n\n13.

The reasonableness and prudence of the 1997 ice-\n              storm expenses was based on the evidence in this\n              case; it was not decided in Docket No. 18249.. . . . . . . . 25\n\n       D.

Procedural History\n\n   This is an administrative appeal of a Public Utility Commission order\n\nthat set retail electric rates for Entergy in PUC Docket 39896. The\n\nCommission continues to set retail electric rates for Entergy, which is\n\nsituated outside the interconnected grid operated by the Electric Reliability\n\nCouncil of Texas (ERCOT), using traditional rate-setting procedures\n\nprescribed in Chapter 36 of the Utilities Code.\n\n   Entergy initiated the rate case (SAR, ETI Exs. 1–6),1 and after notice was\n\nsent, many parties intervened. (AR, Item 185, Proposal for Decision (PFD)\n\nat 3, Binder 5.) Commission Staff also participated as a party, introducing\n\nevidence and presenting argument. (Id.)\n\n   Administrative law judges (ALJs) conducted the hearing, and then the\n\nparties filed briefs with the ALJs. (AR, Items 152–155, 157–158, Binder 3;\n\n159–162, 164, 167–175, Binder 4; 176–177, Binder 5.) The ALJs issued their\n\n\n\n      1\n           The administrative record in this case was admitted into evidence as Joint\nExhibits Nos. 1 through 13. R.R. at 5:11–5:19. Exhibits 1–3 are indices to the\nadministrative record. Exhibits 4–10 and 13 include seven volumes of filings, which are\nreferenced as “Item”; thirty-five volumes of exhibits; and one transcript. Citations to\nthat part of the Administrative Record will be in the form “AR, Item(s) ___,” for filings,\n“AR, ___ Ex(s). ___,” for exhibits, and “AR, Tr. at ___” for transcripts. Exhibits 11 and\n12 contain Entergy’s entire rate-filing package. They are two boxes containing six items\nnumbered 1–6. Because different documents are numbered 1–6 in the other parts of the\nadministrative record, citations to the Supplemental Administrative Record will be in\nthe form “SAR, Item(s) ___.”\n\n                                            1\n\fproposal for decision (AR, Item 185 (PFD)) that discussed the evidence and\n\narguments and proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Parties\n\nfiled exceptions to the PFD, and the case was sent to the Commission. (AR,\n\nItems 191–197, 200–206, Binder 6; AR, Items 207–208, Binder 7.)\n\n   After considering the case in open meeting, the Commission issued its\n\norder (AR, Item 227, Binder 7), parties filed motions for rehearing (AR,\n\nItems 228–29, 231–42, Binder 7), and the Commission granted those\n\nmotions in part and denied them in part in its order on rehearing (Order).\n\n(AR, Item 244, Binder 7.) The Order, the Commission’s final, appealable\n\norder, adopted much of the PFD. (AR, Order at 1.)\n\n   Entergy, the utility, filed a suit for judicial review against the\n\nCommission. So did the following ratepayer groups: Cities, a group of\n\ncities in Entergy’s service area; OPUC; and State Agencies, certain Texas\n\nagencies that receive electric service from Entergy.2 The cases were\n\nconsolidated, parties filed briefs, and the district court heard argument at\n\nits hearing on the merits.\n\n   After considering the briefing of the parties, the administrative record,\n\nand the argument of the parties at the hearing on the merits, the district\n\n\n\n\n      2\n          Shortly before the hearing on the merits, State Agencies moved to withdraw\ntheir appeal, and the district court granted that motion. (C.R. 2079–83, 2084.)\n\n                                          2\n\fcourt issued its judgment that affirmed the Commission on all but one\n\nissue.\n\n      The Commission, Entergy, and OPUC filed notices of appeal, and have\n\nfiled their appellants’ briefs. The Commission files this brief in response to\n\nthe appellants’ briefs of Entergy and OPUC.\n\nII.      Rate Setting\n\n      Ratemaking is a legislative function. Pub. Util. Comm’n v. GTE-Sw.,\n\nInc., 901 S.W.2d. 401, 406 (Tex. 1995). The Commission exercises\n\ndiscretion when setting rates, which, pursuant to the Administrative\n\nProcedure Act, is done in a contested case. Tex. Gov’t Code § 2001.003(1).\n\nAnd the Public Utility Regulatory Act, (Tex. Util. Code §§ 11.01–66.016)\n\n(PURA), sets out the procedure for the Commission to set rates.\n\n      First, the Commission decides how much revenue the utility needs to\n\nrecover. This revenue requirement is the rate of return multiplied by the\n\nutility’s invested capital (rate base) plus the utility’s reasonable and\n\nnecessary operating expenses:\n\n         (rate base × rate of return) + expenses = revenue requirement.\n\nSee Tex. Util. Code § 36.051. Next, the Commission must design the\n\nrates—determine how much should be collected from different rate classes\n\nand what method to use to collect those amounts.\n\n\n                                       3\n\f   So there are four main components to a Commission rate case: (1) the\n\nutility’s invested capital or rate base; (2) the reasonable rate of return the\n\nutility should earn on its invested capital; (3) the utility’s reasonable and\n\nnecessary operating expenses; and (4) the rate design. In addition, fuel\n\ncosts are recovered through temporary rates called “fuel factors.” In all\n\ncomponents of a rate case, the burden of proof is on the utility. Tex. Util.\n\nCode § 36.006.\n\n   The issues addressed in this brief concern both rate base and expenses.\n\n   A.     Rate Base\n\n   Investments in physical assets are a large part of a utility’s rate base, but\n\nit also includes other assets: regulatory assets—expenses that the\n\nregulatory authority allows the utility to capitalize and recover over time by\n\namortization—and a utility’s self-insurance storm-reserve account.\n\n        1. Hurricane Rita Regulatory Asset\n\n   The issue about the Hurricane Rita regulatory asset (Rita Asset) traces\n\nback to Entergy’s costs of reconstruction after Hurricane Rita. Those costs\n\nwere so great that the Legislature allowed utilities to recover them through\n\nsecuritization—selling bonds. Tex. Util. Code §§ 39.458–.463.\n\n\n\n\n                                       4\n\f   When the Commission authorized Entergy to securitize its Hurricane\n\nRita reconstruction costs in PUC Docket 32907 (Securitization Order),3 the\n\nparties agreed on the amount of Hurricane Rita reconstruction costs, and\n\nEntergy estimated the amount of those costs it would receive through\n\ninsurance proceeds. Securitization Order, FF 24 at 4–5. The amount\n\nsecuritized was reconstruction costs minus estimated insurance proceeds.\n\nSecuritization Order, FF 35 at 7. The parties agreed to true up the amount\n\nof insurance proceeds later. Securitization Order, FF 29 at 5–6.\n\n   Four years later Entergy realized that it would receive approximately\n\n$20 million less in insurance proceeds than it had anticipated, and asked\n\nthe Commission in its 2010 rate case, the Black-box Case, to recover that\n\n$20 million with accrued interest as a regulatory asset. (AR, PFD at 16.)\n\n      2. Self-Insurance Storm Reserve and the 1997 Ice Storm\n\n   The 1997 ice-storm issue concerns Entergy’s self-insurance plan. The\n\nCommission allows a utility to keep funds on hand to cover costs of natural\n\ndisasters rather than paying a third party for insurance to cover those costs.\n\nThe Commission’s rules provide that “a self insurance plan is a plan\n\nproviding for accruals to be credited to reserve accounts.” 16 Tex. Admin.\n\n\n      3\n          Tex. Pub. Util. Comm’n, Application of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. for\nDetermination of Hurricane Reconstruction Costs, Docket No. 32907, available at\nhttp://interchange.puc.state.tx.us/WebApp/Interchange/Documents/32907_401_5325\n88.PDF (Dec. 1, 2006) (final order granting application) (Securitization Order).\n\n                                       5\n\fCode § 25.231 (b)(1)(G). The amount in a self-insurance account is\n\ndeducted from rate base. 16 Tex. Admin. Code § 25.231(c)(2)(C)(iii).\n\n   “The reserve accounts are to be charged with property and liability\n\nlosses which occur, and which could not have been reasonably anticipated\n\nand included in operating and maintenance expenses, and are not paid or\n\nreimbursed by commercial insurance.” Id. Shortages in the reserve\n\naccount increase the rate base and any surpluses in the reserve account are\n\nsubtracted from rate base. 16 Tex. Admin. Code § 25.231(c)(2)(E).\n\n   The Commission’s rules also require the utility to “maintain appropriate\n\nbooks and records to permit the commission to properly review all charges\n\nto the reserve account and determine whether the charges being booked to\n\nthe reserve account are reasonable and correct.” Id. Due to an earlier\n\nstatutory rate freeze and later settled rate cases, the Commission, for the\n\nfirst time in this case, addressed charges to Entergy’s storm-damage\n\naccount based on several storm events, including reconstruction and repair\n\ncosts after a severe ice storm in 1997.\n\n   B.    Reasonable and Necessary Expenses\n\n   Entergy raises two issues about expenses: the cost of purchasing\n\ncapacity and the cost of transmission services. In both, Entergy asked the\n\nCommission to increase the amount of expenses used to set rates from the\n\n\n                                          6\n\famount of those expenses in the test year, and in both, the Commission\n\nfound that Entergy failed to meet its burden to prove that the post-test-year\n\nchanges were known and measurable.\n\n   Only reasonable-and-necessary expenses can be recovered in rates. Tex.\n\nUtil. Code § 36.051. Although rates are set for the future, the expenses are\n\nbased on the actual expenses the utility incurred in the test year. 16 Tex.\n\nAdmin. Code § 25.231(b). The test year is “[t]he most recent 12 months for\n\nwhich operating data for an electric utility … are available and shall\n\ncommence with a calendar quarter or a fiscal year quarter.” 16 Tex. Admin.\n\nCode § 25.5(134). The actual test-year expenses that are reasonable and\n\nnecessary will only be adjusted for known-and-measurable changes. 16\n\nTex. Admin. Code § 25.231(b). Because the utility bears the burden of\n\nproof in a rate case (Tex. Util. Code § 36.006), Entergy had to convince the\n\nCommission that any post-test-year expenses it wanted to include in rates\n\nare known-and-measurable changes.\n\n                       Summary of the Argument\n\n   The Commission’s Order should be affirmed. The Commission\n\nreasonably interpreted its prior rate-case order, the Black-box Order, to\n\nauthorize Entergy to book and amortize a regulatory asset for unrecovered\n\nHurricane Rita reconstruction costs. The Black-box Order was ambiguous\n\n\n                                      7\n\fconcerning the Rita Asset. That order was based on a “black box”\n\nsettlement—one where only the amount of rates to be collected was set\n\nforth, not all of the individual components of a rate case. Because the\n\nBlack-box Order did not explicitly state whether booking and amortizing\n\nthe regulatory asset had been authorized, it was ambiguous. Courts defer\n\nto an agency’s interpretation of its prior, ambiguous order, and the\n\nevidence in the record supports the Commission’s decision.\n\n   Substantial evidence supports the Commission’s decision that\n\n$13 million should be added to Entergy’s storm reserve based on the\n\nexpenses Entergy incurred to repair equipment after a severe ice storm in\n\n1997. A prior Commission decision that faulted Entergy for poor service\n\nquality did not amount to a finding that Entergy could not include the\n\nrepair costs in the insurance reserve amount.\n\n   Substantial evidence supports the Commission’s decision that Entergy\n\nfailed to meet its burden of proof to increase the cost of purchasing capacity\n\nand the cost for transmission charges from the amount of those costs\n\nshown in the test-year amounts. The record supports the Commission’s\n\ndecision that Entergy did not meet its burden of proving that requested\n\nchanges were known and measurable.\n\n\n\n\n                                      8\n\f   For example, Entergy based its arguments about purchasing capacity on\n\nthe assumption that it would always purchase the maximum amount under\n\nnew contracts. Entergy claimed that it would have more customers in the\n\nfuture. Not only is that speculative, but the utility failed to account for how\n\nadditional customers would otherwise affect its recovery through rates.\n\nAnd Entergy’s arguments about transmission charges are controlled by\n\nnumerous unknown variables used in a complex formula. The\n\nCommission’s test-year rule is created to avoid just such unknowns.\n\nMoreover, most of Entergy’s request for post-test-year changes to\n\ntransmission costs were based on an agreement that was still waiting for\n\napproval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. That is\n\npatently not a “known” change. Because substantial evidence supports the\n\nCommission’s decisions, the Order should be affirmed.\n\n                                 Argument\n\nI. Standard of Review\n\n   As in any lawsuit, plaintiffs bear the burden of proof.

The district court properly affirmed the Commission’s\n        decision about the amount of the Hurricane Rita regulatory\n        asset to include in Entergy’s rate base. (Responds to\n        Entergy Issue 1)\n\n      The district court properly affirmed the Commission’s determination of\n\nthe amount of the Hurricane Rita regulatory asset (Rita Asset) that was in\n\nEntergy’s rate base when it set rates in this case. Substantial evidence\n\nsupports the Commission’s reasonable decision that Entergy began\n\namortizing that amount through rates set by the Black-box Order. In\n\nEntergy’s 2010 Black-box Case, the Commission allowed the utility to\n\nrecover nearly $20 million of Rita recovery costs by creating and\n\namortizing a regulatory asset. Considering the deference due to the\n\nCommission’s interpretation of its prior ambiguous order, this Court\n\n                                       11\n\fshould also affirm the Commission’s decision about the amount of the Rita\n\nAsset in rate base.\n\n   A.       Factual Background\n\n   The Rita Asset was an issue in Entergy’s preceding rate case, the Black-\n\nbox Case. As explained below, because that case was resolved based on the\n\nparties’ “black box” settlement, the Commission’s order in that earlier case\n\nis ambiguous as to how the Rita Asset was decided.\n\n   The Commission’s Black-box Order4 contained little more detail than the\n\ntotal amount to be recovered in rates and the rate design used to recover\n\nthat amount. In contrast, a typical Commission order adopting rates, like\n\nthe order in this case, spells out in some detail the amounts in each\n\ncategory of invested capital (rate base)5 as well as the total rate base,6 each\n\npart of debt and return on equity used to determine the rate of return,7 the\n\namounts of reasonable and necessary expenses in each category,8 and the\n\n\n        4\n          Tex.

(showing $1,700,128,144 as the total invested capital).\n        7\n            AR, Order at 6–7, FF 64–71 at 18–19.\n        8\n            AR, Order at FF 72–170 at 19–29, Schedules II, IV, & V.\n\n                                             12\n\frate design listing each rate class and explaining how the rates to be paid by\n\neach class will be determined.9 But to reach a settlement in the Black-box\n\nCase, the parties omitted that detail.\n\n   Finding of Fact 16 of the Black-box Order explained that the parties to\n\nthat case agreed that Entergy “should be allowed to implement an initial\n\noverall increase in base-rate revenues of $59 million for usage on and after\n\nAugust 15, 2010.” Black-box Order, FF 16 at 15. And they agreed that\n\nEntergy “should be allowed to implement an additional overall increase in\n\nbase-rate revenues of $9 million on an annualized basis effective for bills\n\nrendered on and after May 2, 2011.” Id. The lack of detail in the Black-box\n\nOrder created an issue in the current rate case about how much of the Rita\n\nAsset was in Entergy’s current rate base.\n\n   In this case, the parties disputed what part of the Rita Asset Entergy\n\nrecovered under the Black-box Order. Entergy argued that it had not\n\nreceived any part of the Rita Asset from the Black-box Order, but in the\n\nalternative argued that only part of the Rita Asset had been recovered\n\nunder the Black-box Order. (AR, Item 157 at 9-13, Binder 3.) Cities argued\n\nthat the rates based on the Black-box Case settlement included\n\namortization of the Rita Asset so that only a portion of that amount\n\n\n      9\n          AR, Order at FF 175–213 at 29–35.\n\n                                         13\n\fremained to be recovered in this rate case. (AR, Item 161 at 10-12, Binder\n\n4.) Commission Staff argued that Entergy had recovered all of the Rita\n\nAsset through the rates set in the Black-box Order, but in the alternative\n\nargued that only part of the Rita Asset had been recovered under the Black-\n\nbox Order. (AR, Item 164 at 10, Binder 4; AR, Staff Ex. 1 (Givens Direct) at\n\n32, Binder 40.)\n\n  The ALJs decided that the Rita Asset had been partially amortized\n\nthrough the Black-box Case rates, but found that the amount recovered\n\nthrough those rates was different from the amounts proposed by any of the\n\nparties. (AR, PFD at 4.) The Commission adopted that part of the PFD.\n\n(AR, Order at 1.)\n\n  B.     Substantial evidence supports the Commission’s\n         reasonable interpretation of its prior, ambiguous order.\n\n       1. The Black-box Order decided the Rita Asset issue.\n\n  The Commission approved creation and amortization of the Rita Asset\n\nin the Black-box Order. All parties in the Black-box Case agreed that\n\nEntergy was entitled to recover the $20 million of overestimated insurance\n\nproceeds that it requested. And, by the terms of the Black-box Order,\n\nEntergy’s request that the Commission approve booking and amortizing the\n\nRita Asset was either approved or denied in that case—it could not have\n\n\n\n                                     14\n\fbeen ignored by the order. Thus, the Black-box Order had to have\n\napproved amortizing the Rita Asset.\n\n  The PFD weighed several factors to determine what the Commission\n\ndecided about the Rita Asset in the Black-box Case:\n\n• The Securitization Order said there would be a true up after the\n\n  insurance proceeds were received.\n\n• Utilities Code Section 39.459(c) says if the timing of receiving insurance\n\n  proceeds means that they were not included in securitization, they\n\n  should be included in the next rate case.\n\n• The Black-box Case was the next rate case.\n\n• In the Black-box Case, no one objected to the regulatory asset or\n\n  amortizing it.\n\n• The Black-box Order said that it resolved all issues except the\n\n  Competitive Generation Services proposal.\n\n• The Black-box Order did not specifically exclude the Rita regulatory\n\n  asset but did specifically exclude some other regulatory assets; some\n\n  others were expressly approved.\n\n(AR, PFD at 20–21.) The last factor shows the ambiguity in the Black-box\n\nOrder. All the other factors weighed in favor of holding that the\n\n\n\n\n                                      15\n\fCommission approved booking and amortizing the Rita Asset in the Black-\n\nbox Order. (Id.)\n\n   Although the Commission relied on all of these considerations, Entergy\n\nattacks the factors individually. But as shown factor-by-factor below,\n\nEntergy’s arguments are unavailing.\n\n         Securitization Docket\n\n   As both the Commission and Entergy note, the Securitization Order said\n\nthat there would be a true up after insurance proceeds were received. And\n\nall agree that once Entergy showed that it would not recover $20 million of\n\nthe Rita reconstruction costs through estimated insurance proceeds, the\n\nCommission should take action to allow Entergy to recover those costs.\n\nThat supports the idea that the Commission would act quickly—in the\n\nBlack-box Case where it was first asked—to approve booking and\n\namortizing the Rita Asset so that Entergy could quickly recover the\n\noverestimated insurance proceeds.\n\n         The statute requires action in the next rate case.\n\n   That the Black-box Case was the “next” base-rate case supports the\n\nCommission’s conclusion that it approved booking and amortizing the Rita\n\nAsset in that case. Entergy’s argument about which statute applies is\n\nirrelevant because all the cited statutes indicate that the utility should\n\n\n                                       16\n\frecover its Rita reconstruction costs as soon as possible; as soon as Entergy\n\nraised the issue in a base-rate case.\n\n   Both the statute cited by the Commission and that cited by Entergy\n\nemphasize the need to get funds to the utility quickly. Utilities Code\n\n§ 39.459(c), cited by the Commission states: “If the timing of a utility’s\n\nreceipt of [insurance proceeds] prevents their inclusion as a reduction to\n\nthe hurricane reconstruction costs that are securitized, the commission\n\nshall take those amounts into account in (1) the utility’s next base rate\n\nproceeding; or (2) any proceeding in which the commission considers\n\nhurricane reconstruction costs.” Section 39.462(a) cited by Entergy stated\n\nthat the utility is entitled to seek recovery “in its next base rate proceeding\n\nor through any other proceedings authorized by Subchapter C, Chapter 39.”\n\nAnd a stated purpose of the hurricane-recovery statutes is “to enable an\n\nelectric utility subject to this subchapter to obtain timely recovery of\n\nhurricane reconstruction costs.” Tex. Util. Code § 39.458(a) (emphasis\n\nadded). Thus, whichever statute applies, the Commission can reasonably\n\nexpect to address insurance proceeds in the next base-rate case or other\n\npermitted Commission case.\n\n   The Commission’s analysis is correct, whichever statute applies: the\n\nCommission should address questions about insurance proceeds for Rita\n\n\n                                        17\n\freconstruction costs when the utility raises the issue in a base-rate case.\n\n(Since both the Black-box Case and this case are base-rate proceedings,\n\nthere is no need to address what other types of proceedings were available.)\n\n             Which is the next rate case?\n\n   The Black-box Case was the “next” base-rate proceeding. “[N]ext base\n\nrate proceeding” (Tex. Util. Code §§ 39.459(c) & .462(a)) refers to “the\n\ntiming of a utility’s receipt of those amounts.” (Tex. Util. Code § 39.459(c)).\n\nThe statute does not refer to the next proceeding after the Commission\n\nauthorized securitization. Thus, the fact that Docket 34800 was Entergy’s\n\nnext rate case10 after securitization did not make it the appropriate docket\n\nto address the $20 million of overestimated insurance proceeds.\n\n   The Black-box Case was the first time Entergy asked to recover the Rita\n\nAsset. And the record indicates that the Black-box Case was the “next”\n\nEntergy rate case after the utility knew that it would not receive the\n\nanticipated $20 million of insurance proceeds. Entergy did not state\n\nexactly when it finally realized that it would not receive $20 million of\n\nanticipated insurance proceeds. But factors indicate that the Black-box\n\n\n      10\n          Tex. Pub. Util.

That is another factor that supports the\n\nCommission’s conclusion that booking and amortizing the Rita Asset was\n\napproved in the Black-box Order.\n\n   The evidence in this case shows that no party to the Black-box Case\n\ndisputed that the $20 million needed to be included in rates. In this case,\n\nPUC Staff Witness Givens testified that, other than a minor adjustment to\n\nthe amount that he recommended, “No other adjustments were\n\nrecommended to the Company’s request for inclusion of the regulatory\n\nasset in rate base or the amortization expense associated with the asset.”\n\n\n\n\n                                     19\n\f(AR, Staff Ex. 1 (Givens Direct) at 33,11 Binder 40.) And Cities witness\n\nGarrett testified: “[E]ven though the last rate case settled, since no party\n\nopposed the Company’s inclusion in rates of the Rita regulatory costs, the\n\nCompany should have been amortizing the Rita regulatory balance since\n\nthe last case, … .” (AR, Cities Ex. 2 (Garrett Direct) at 11, Binder 8.)\n\n   Based on that testimony, the Commission, in this case, decided that in\n\nthe Black-box Case “there was no objection to [Entergy]’s proposed\n\nHurricane Rita regulatory asset, it was authorized by the prior settlement in\n\n[the Securitization Order docket], and the Commission was directed by\n\nPURA § 39.459(c) to take into account [Entergy]’s insurance proceeds\n\nrelated to the Hurricane Rita securitized costs in [Entergy]’s next rate case,\n\nwhich was [the Black-box Case].” (AR, PFD at 21–22.)\n\n             All issues resolved in the Black-box Order\n\n   The Black-box Order states that the parties entered into “a stipulation\n\nand settlement agreement that resolves all of the issues in this proceeding\n\nexcept the issues related to [Entergy]’s proposal for competitive generation\n\nservice.” Black-box Order at 1 (emphasis added). No parties to this case\n\ndispute that “[i]n [the Black-box Case], [Entergy] requested recovery of the\n\n\n\n      11\n           Several exhibits in the Administrative Record have multiple page numbers.\nCitations are to the Bates stamped number on the bottom right of the exhibit unless\nthere is no such number on the page.\n\n                                          20\n\fOverestimated Insurance Proceeds by establishing a regulatory asset of\n\n$19,686,096, plus accrued carrying costs, to be amortized over five years.”\n\n(AR, PFD at 16). And Ordering Paragraph 15 in the Black-box Order states:\n\n“All other motions, requests for entry of specific findings of fact,\n\nconclusions of law, and ordering paragraphs, and any other requests for\n\ngeneral or specific relief, if not expressly granted in this order, are hereby\n\ndenied.” Thus, if the Commission did not address the Rita Asset in that\n\nPUC docket, the Commission denied Entergy’s request.\n\n      Entergy’s attempt to argue that the Commission approved the Rita\n\nAsset but did not order the utility to begin recovering it through\n\namortization is unavailing. As explained above, evidence in this case shows\n\nthat Entergy requested both in the Black-box Case. And, the utility fails to\n\nexplain how only one part of its request could have been approved given the\n\nlanguage of the Black-box Order.\n\n      In this rate case, Entergy bears the burden to prove how much of the\n\nRita Asset is in rate base. The Utilities Code places the burden of proof in a\n\nrate case on the utility. Tex. Util. Code § 36.006. Rate base (also called\n\ninvested capital) is one of the inputs to determine the utility’s revenue\n\nrequirement. Thus, the utility bears the burden to prove the amount of its\n\nrate base.

The Commission properly included the 1997 ice-storm\n     recovery costs in the storm-damage reserve account.\n     (Responds to OPUC Issue)\n\n      Substantial evidence shows that the expenses for the 1997 ice-storm\n\nrecovery belong in Entergy’s self-insurance storm-reserve account.\n\n      A.     Background of the storm-reserve account.\n\n      In this case, Entergy showed that it had overdrawn its storm-reserve\n\naccount. In PUC Docket 16705 and in the Black-box Order, Entergy was\n\nallowed to maintain a storm damage reserve of about $15.6 million.12 (AR,\n\nPFD at 45.) But over the course of the 15 years prior to this case, more than\n\n200 storms occurred. (Id.) So Entergy had charged about $101.7 million to\n\nthe reserve account in costs of restoring service (not counting securitized\n\n\n      12\n           Tex. Pub. Util. Comm’n, Application of Entergy Texas for Approval of its\nTransition To Competition Plan and the Tariffs Implementing the Plan, and for the\nAuthority to Reconcile Fuel Costs, to Set Revised Fuel Factors, and to Recover a\nSurcharge for Under-Recovered Fuel Costs, Docket No. 16705 available at\nhttp://interchange.puc.state.tx.us/WebApp/Interchange/Documents/98171.TIF (Oct.\n14, 1998) (second order on rehearing at FOF 120).\n\n                                         23\n\fexpenses). At the same time, Entergy had accrued only about $29.8 million\n\nin its reserve. (Id.) Thus, in this case, Entergy asked the Commission to\n\nagree that the current amount of its storm-reserve account was about a\n\nnegative $59.8 million. (Id.)\n\n     The Commission agreed (AR, Order, FF 50) and ordered the reserve\n\nto be replenished in increments, eventually establishing a $17.6 million\n\nstorm-reserve account. (AR, Order, FF 157-159.) The $13 million of 1997\n\nice-storm costs that OPUC complains about is included in the $59.8 million\n\nnegative storm reserve.\n\n     B.    The Commission did not decide in earlier dockets\n           whether the 1997 ice-storm expenses were properly\n           charged against the storm-reserve account.\n\n     Although there were several Entergy rate cases before this case, none\n\nof them determined whether expenses were properly charged against the\n\nstorm-reserve account. In fact, the Commission did not have the\n\nopportunity to consider whether the 1997 ice-storm expenses were properly\n\ncharged against the storm-reserve account until this 2012 rate case.\n\n     No party disputes that the Commission carried the question whether\n\nthe 1997 ice-storm repair expenses were properly booked against Entergy’s\n\nstorm-reserve account for over a decade. In October 1998, the Commission\n\nordered Entergy to prove the reasonableness and prudence of charging the\n\n\n                                     24\n\fice-storm expenditures against the storm-reserve account in its next\n\n(November 1998) rate case. But that rate case settled in June 1999 without\n\naddressing the 1997 ice-storm expenditures.13 Entergy’s next rate case was\n\ndismissed by the Commission in October 2004 because of a statutory rate\n\nfreeze.14 A March 2009 rate case settled without specifically addressing the\n\nice-storm expenditures, and the Black-box Case settled in December 2010\n\nwithout addressing the expenditures. Accordingly, 15 years after the\n\noriginal storm, the Commission considered the ice storm expenditures in\n\nthis case.\n\n      C.     The reasonableness and prudence of the 1997 ice-\n             storm expenses was based on the evidence in this case;\n             it was not decided in Docket No. 18249.\n\n      OPUC’s reliance on the Service-quality Order is misplaced because it\n\nis based on an incorrect premise. Both here and at the Commission OPUC\n\nclaimed that the Commission had decided that the expenses for the 1997\n\nIce Storm were imprudently incurred in PUC Docket No. 18249 (the\n\n\n\n      13\n          Tex.

(Service-quality Order, at\n\n39.) In the Service-quality Order, the Commission addressed maintenance\n\npolicies, Entergy’s level of spending in the area of operations and\n\nmaintenance, the experience of its personnel, and the consequent quality of\n\nits service. (Id. at 7.) In that 1998 decision, the Commission stated that\n\n“[t]he January 1997 ice storm was certainly a severe storm that would have\n\nadversely affected even the best-maintained distribution system” (Id. at 18;\n\nPFD at p. 56), but the agency also determined that Entergy’s poor service\n\nquality and vegetation management failures aggravated the situation. (Id.\n\nat 18-19.) In response to all the poor service-quality issues shown, the\n\nCommission (1) reduced Entergy’s return on equity by 60 basis points, (2)\n\nrequired Entergy to make refunds to its customers, and (3) imposed\n\nsignificant spending requirements and quantified performance guarantees.\n\n(Id. at 51-53.)\n\n\n      15\n          Tex.

The PFD states that Entergy established\n\nthat the expenses it incurred to repair damage and restore service after the\n\nice storm “were reasonable and necessary, and the ALJs find that they\n\nshould be included in the storm damage reserve.” (AR, PFD at 57.) Thus,\n\nthe Commission found that the statements in its 1998 order were not\n\nenough to overcome Entergy’s showing that the actual expenditures were\n\nreasonable, necessary, and prudent.\n\n      D.    Substantial evidence supports the expenses of\n            restoring service after the 1997 Ice Storm.\n\n      Substantial evidence supports the determination that the expenses\n\nEntergy incurred to restore power after the ice storm were reasonable,\n\nnecessary, and prudent. Entergy Witness Shawn Corkran testified that he\n\nreviewed the expenses and “determined that the costs were reasonable and\n\nnecessary to reliably restore service to customers as quickly as possible\n\nafter the ice storm.” (AR, ETI Ex. 48 (Corkran Rebuttal) at 10, Binder 37,\n\nEx. SBC-R-1, at 22.) Entergy backed up this testimony with exhibits\n\ncontaining a breakdown of expenses for labor, materials, transportation,\n\nlodging, and other expenses. (Id.) “[O]nce the ice storm occurred,\n\n                                      27\n\f[Entergy] had to take appropriate action to repair the damage and restore\n\nservice.” (AR, PFD at 57.)\n\n      Substantial evidence also supports the determination that the\n\nexpenses were not reasonably anticipated. Entergy’s Corkran provided 11\n\npages of testimony backed by exhibits providing a detailed breakdown of\n\nthe expenses incurred to take appropriate action to repair the damage and\n\nrestore service once the storm occurred. (AR, ETI Ex. 48 (Corkran\n\nRebuttal) at 4–14, Binder 37, and Ex. SBC-R-1, at 22.) Corkran established\n\nthat the ice storm was the most destructive winter storm to ever hit the\n\nEntergy system. (Id. at 7.) The storm de-energized approximately 3,400\n\nmiles of distribution lines and 560 miles of transmission lines. (Id.) The\n\naffected service area was within the light ice-loading zone according to the\n\nNational Electric Safety Code (“NESC”) in effect at the time, (id. at 9) and\n\nthe light ice-loading zone is defined by no ice accumulation on the\n\ndistribution lines. (Id.) The majority of the damage at issue was caused by\n\nan accumulation of one to three inches of ice while temperatures remained\n\nbelow freezing for more than two days after the storm’s initial onset. (Id.)\n\n      Corkran testified that although Entergy generally exceeds NESC\n\nstrength requirements, the ice storm put an extraordinary burden on the\n\nfacilities, causing the wires, poles, and other equipment to collapse from\n\n\n                                      28\n\fthe weight of the accumulated ice, and causing tree limbs weighed down by\n\nice accumulation to fall on Entergy’s lines. (Id.) Thus, the severe impact of\n\nthe ice storm was not reasonably anticipated in the NESC or by Entergy. In\n\nconclusion, Corkran stated that the ice storm restoration and recovery\n\nexpenses were “reasonable, necessary and prudently incurred.” (Id. at 13-\n\n14.)\n\n       OPUC’s complaint that Entergy failed to identify and quantify which\n\nof its expenses were imprudent is unavailing. Entergy claimed all its\n\nexpenses were reasonable, and a utility is not required to identify which\n\nexpenses are imprudent. Tex. Utils. Elec. Co. v. Pub. Util.

OPUC’s additional complaints do not show error.\n\n       OPUC’s further complaints are without merit. OPUC has not shown\n\nthat the Commission’s decision is arbitrary and capricious despite being\n\nsupported by substantial evidence.\n\n       The Commission was not required to make an ultimate finding of fact\n\nin statutory language that storm-reserve expenses were “not reasonably\n\nanticipated” as OPUC contends. Neither the Commission’s rule nor the\n\n\n                                      29\n\fUtilities Code require such a finding of fact. See 16 Tex. Admin. Code\n\n§ 25.231(b)(1)(G); Tex. Util. Code § 36.064(a). And, as stated above, the\n\nCommission’s findings in the PFD show the Commission considered that it\n\nwould not have been reasonable to anticipate the devastation caused by the\n\n1997 Ice Storm. An ultimate finding of fact in statutory language is not\n\nrequired if the findings reflect that the Commission considered the required\n\nunderlying criteria. See Meier Infiniti v.

(OPUC Appellant’s Brief at 38.) This is\n\nmerely a continuation of OPUC’s incorrect assertion that the utility must\n\nidentify its imprudence.\n\n     OPUC’s requested relief should be denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                     30\n\fIV.   Substantial evidence supports the Commission’s\n      determination that Entergy failed to meet its burden to\n      prove that predicted purchased-power capacity costs were\n      known-and-measurable changes to the test-year data.\n      (Responds to Entergy’s Issue 2).\n\n      Substantial evidence supports the Commission’s determination that\n\nEntergy failed to meet its burden to prove that certain projected costs for\n\npurchasing capacity were known-and-measurable changes from the costs\n\nincurred during the test year. Some contracts Entergy relied upon were not\n\nyet in place, and inputs for the variables in formulas for Entergy’s contracts\n\nwith its affiliates were unknown. Thus, the Commission determined that\n\nEntergy failed meet its burden. The district court properly affirmed this\n\ndetermination, and its judgment should be upheld.\n\n      A.    The Commission uses the utility’s actual expenses\n            during a test year to determine what expenses to\n            include in rates, and they can only be changed for\n            known-and-measurable changes.\n\n      The Commission’s rules require the expenses included in rates to be\n\nbased on the utility’s actual expenses during a test year that ends before the\n\nutility applies to change rates. And only expenses that are reasonable and\n\nnecessary can be recovered. Tex. Util. Code § 36.051. Although rates are\n\nset for the future, “[i]n computing an electric utility’s allowable expenses,\n\nonly the electric utility’s historical test year expenses as adjusted for known\n\nand measurable changes will be considered, … .” 16 Tex.

But Entergy sought to recover an\n\nadditional $31 million based upon what it believed would be the purchased-\n\npower agreements in place during the “rate year,” the first year of new rates\n\nset by the case. Commission Staff and several intervenors opposed\n\nEntergy’s request to recover the additional $31 million and offered\n\ntestimony and argument against Entergy’s proposed adjustment.\n\n\n\n                                       33\n\f      Staff and intervenors pointed out several problems with Entergy’s\n\nproposed post-test-year adjustments, arguing that these additional costs\n\nare mere projections. For example, Entergy relied on projections, rather\n\nthan known actual payments, when estimating what it would pay under\n\nthird-party contracts in the future. Indeed, many of the contracts do not\n\ncontain fixed-price terms, and Entergy’s costs will fluctuate based on\n\nfactors such as required availability and performance. (PFD at 101-02\n\n(citing AR, Tr. at 704-05).) Nevertheless, Entergy “simply assumed it\n\nwould pay the maximum amount possible under each of its third party\n\ncontracts, and disregarded any of the contractual factors that might reduce\n\nits Rate Year payments.” (AR, PFD at 102 (citing AR, Tr. at 704-05).)\n\n      Likewise, the expenses requested under Entergy’s contractual\n\nagreements with its affiliates rest on several assumptions. The contracts do\n\nnot definitively fix prices or quantities, which will fluctuate based on the\n\nspecific operational conditions experienced in the future. (AR, PFD at 102\n\n(citing AR, Tr. at 606).) The ultimate determination of payments will be\n\nbased on a formula set out in a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\n\ntariff, schedule MSS-4. Entergy could not know what variables should be\n\ninserted in that formula. Instead, to project its costs, Entergy made\n\nassumptions about each of the several variables contained in the formula.\n\n\n                                      34\n\f(Id.) Intervenors argued that this was too speculative to constitute a known\n\nand measurable change.\n\n      To illustrate their position that Entergy’s proposed costs were\n\ninherently speculative, the intervenors pointed to a new Entergy contract\n\n(the EA WBL Contract). That contract, which was executed only days\n\nbefore the SOAH hearing, accounted for more than a third of Entergy’s\n\nproposed $31 million increase in expenses. Not only would pricing under\n\nthe contract be determined pursuant to the complex formula in MSS-4, but\n\nalso how much capacity Entergy ultimately purchased would be based on\n\nan allocation percentage between Entergy and other companies that had\n\nnot yet been determined. Moreover, the contract itself might never go into\n\neffect because it is subject to Entergy receiving regulatory approval from\n\nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Even if the contract became\n\neffective in the future, it would still be subject to at least two further\n\nrevisions before any power could be received under the contract. (AR, PFD\n\nat 102-03 (citing AR, ETI Ex. 47 (Cooper Rebuttal) at RRC-R-1, Binder 37,\n\nand AR, Tr. at 628-29).)\n\n      Changes Entergy proposed based on estimated payments under\n\nanother FERC tariff, the MSS-1, also required several assumptions about\n\nthe future. To calculate its obligations under MSS-1, Entergy had to\n\n\n                                        35\n\fforecast not only its own future loads, but the future loads of all the other\n\nOperating Companies16 in the Entergy family of companies. If those\n\nassumptions regarding future loads are incorrect, Entergy’s projected costs\n\ncould be significantly different. (AR, PFD at 103 (citing AR, Tr. at\n\n651–52).) The intervenors pointed out the inconsistency in Entergy’s\n\nposition on the measurability of future load growth, noting that elsewhere\n\nin the case, Entergy took the position that future projected loads should not\n\nbe considered known and measurable. (AR, PFD at 103 (citing AR, Tr. at\n\n1907; see also AR, Item 164 at 28, Binder 4; AR, Item 159 at 27-28, Binder\n\n4.) (emphasis added).) The ALJs also noted the following testimony of\n\nEntergy Witness Phillip May regarding the certainty of Entergy’s MSS-1\n\nprojections:\n\n      Q:     Do you think that the projection . . . of rate year sales that\n             is implicit in the calculation of MSS-1 costs . . . is a known\n             and measurable change?\n\n      A:     I think there is some uncertainty with regard to that\n             projection, yes, sir.\n\n(AR, PFD at 103-04 (citing AR, Tr. at 1918-19).)\n\n      The intervenors also argued that it was inappropriate to impose the\n\nfuture costs of securing capacity to serve a larger, future load on existing\n\n\n\n      16\n          Entergy is one of several related electric companies in Texas, Louisiana,\nArkansas, and Mississippi. Those are called “operating companies” in this case.\n\n                                           36\n\fcustomers without taking into account increased customer growth and\n\nsales revenue. The result, they argued, would violate the “matching\n\nprinciple” whereby “the attendant impacts on all aspects of a utility’s\n\noperations (including revenue, expenses, and invested capital) can with\n\nreasonable certainty be identified, quantified, and matched.” (AR, PFD at\n\n104 (citing AR, Cities Ex. 6 (Nalepa Direct) at 12, Binder 9, citing 16 Tex.\n\nAdmin. Code § 25.231(c)(2)(F)(i)(IV).) “The argument, essentially, is that\n\nthe various new or expanded contracts that [Entergy] has entered into were\n\nexecuted so that, in whole or part, [Entergy] would be able to meet future\n\ndemand, but that [Entergy] is seeking to recover the costs of those new\n\ncontracts from its existing customers.” (AR, PFD at 104 (citing AR, Cities\n\nEx. 6 (Nalepa Direct) at 11, Binder 9; see also AR, Item 161 at 38, Binder 4;\n\nAR, Item 164 at 30, Binder 4; AR, Item 159 at 35-39, Binder 4.).)\n\n      C.    Entergy failed to prove that the adjustments were\n            known-and-measurable changes.\n\n      Weighing all the evidence, the ALJs “conclude[d] that [Entergy]\n\nfailed to meet its burden to prove that the adjustment it seeks to its Test\n\nyear [Purchase Power Capacity Contracts] is known and measurable.” (AR,\n\nPFD at 108.) And the ALJs found that the intervenors had “presented\n\nsubstantial evidence that all of the components of [Entergy]’s purchased\n\n\n\n                                      37\n\fpower capacity contain significant variability and uncertainty in costs.” AR,\n\nPFD at 109.)\n\n      The Commission agreed.17 It denied Entergy’s request for post-test-\n\nyear costs, as set out in Findings of Fact 72 through 86. (AR, Order, FF\n\n72–86.) In its briefing, Entergy cites particular provisions of various\n\ncontracts and argues that it was unreasonable for the Commission to deny\n\nall of the proposed expenses. But Entergy bore the burden to prove that\n\nthese adjustments were known and measurable. Both because whether to\n\nallow post-test-year adjustments is within the Commission’s discretion,\n\nand because these findings are supported by substantial evidence,\n\nEntergy’s complaint should be rejected.\n\nV.    Substantial evidence supports the Commission’s\n      determination that Entergy failed to meet its burden to\n      prove that predicted transmission-equalization charges\n      were known-and-measurable changes to the test-year data.\n      (Responsive to Entergy’s Issue 3).\n\n      As with the purchased-power capacity costs, substantial evidence\n\nsupports the Commission’s determination that Entergy failed to meet its\n\nburden to prove that transmission-equalization expenses that the utility\n\nalleged it would incur outside the test year were known and measurable.\n\n\n\n      17\n          However, after Entergy pointed to an additional $522,002 of purchased\npower capacity costs incurred during the test year, the Commission modified the ALJs’\nproposal to allow for a total recovery of $245,965,886.\n\n                                          38\n\f      A.    Entergy recovers transmission equalization expenses\n            through rates.\n\n      The Entergy-system transmission grid is a large, integrated network\n\nthat is operated for the mutual benefit of all of the Entergy Operating\n\nCompanies. The costs of operating this system are allocated among the\n\nOperating Companies pursuant to Service Schedule MSS-2, a FERC tariff,\n\nunder which each Operating Company contributes its just and reasonable\n\nshare of the costs. Those costs are referred to as “transmission\n\nequalization” payments, and Entergy recovers them as expenses in rates.\n\n      As the ALJs explained, “In any given month, some of the Operating\n\nCompanies might be ‘long’ on the amount of transmission capacity they\n\nown (meaning that they own more capacity than they need) while others\n\nmight be ‘short’ on capacity (meaning they own less capacity than they\n\nneed). In such a month, the long Operating Companies would receive\n\nMSS-2 payments from the short Operating Companies for use of their\n\ntransmission facilities.” (AR, PFD at 110 (citing AR, Tr. at 731, 735).)\n\n      B.    Entergy sought an adjustment based on anticipated\n            post-test-year transmission expenses.\n\n      Entergy sought to recover $9 million more for transmission expenses\n\nthat it incurred in its test year. During the test year, Entergy was short and\n\npaid more than $1.7 million in MSS-2 payments to other Operating\n\n\n                                      39\n\fCompanies. (AR, PFD at 110 (citing AR, Tr. at 723-24, 737; AR, Cities\n\nEx. 28 (ETI response to Cities RFI 3-3), Binder 9.).) Entergy does not\n\ndispute that this $1.7 million represents its total transmission-equalization\n\ncosts incurred during the test year. But, Entergy asked for post-test-year\n\nadjustments based on its estimates of transmission construction projects\n\nexpected to be completed after the test year. These projects would result in\n\nchanges to the relative transmission-line-ownership ratios among the\n\nOperating Companies, with the apparent result that Entergy would be\n\nincreasingly short and its payments under MSS-2 would grow.\n\n      Commission Staff and other parties opposed including these post-\n\ntest-year expenses, arguing that they were not sufficiently known or\n\nmeasurable to include in rates set in this case. Payments under MSS-2 are\n\ncalculated using a complex mathematical formula involving many\n\nvariables, such as the amount of investments in transmission facilities\n\nmade by each Operating Company, the costs of capital for each Operating\n\nCompany, the size of the load demanded by each Operating Company, and\n\nthe amount of state and federal tax paid by each Operating Company.\n\nChanges in any of these variables would change the amount Entergy would\n\nowe—or be due—under the formula. (AR, PFD at 111 (citing AR, ETI Ex. 39\n\n(Cicio Direct) at PJC-1 at 38-43, Binder 36; AR, Tr. at 454-55.).) TIEC\n\n\n                                      40\n\fWitness Pollock testified that any attempt to estimate these many variables\n\n“is susceptible to a host of uncertainties.” (AR, TIEC Ex. 1 (Pollock Direct)\n\nat 29, Binder 41.)\n\n      Aside from the difficulties involved in estimating several variables for\n\nseveral companies, the transmission projects involved had not yet come\n\ninto service and were still in the planning or construction phase. Entergy\n\nacknowledged that if the projects were not completed on schedule, then its\n\nprojected MSS-2 costs would be inaccurate. (AR, PFD at 112 (citing AR, Tr.\n\nat 800-801).) TIEC argued that it would be bad policy for the Commission\n\nto rely on “speculative construction end dates to form the basis of a known\n\nand measurable change to test year costs.” (AR, PFD at 113 (citing AR,\n\nItem 159 at 47, Binder 4).) The intervenors argued that Entergy had\n\noffered scant evidentiary support for some of its estimates, and contended\n\nthat it would be unfair to allow Entergy to immediately begin recovery of\n\nMSS-2 payments that would not be incurred for many months. (AR, PFD\n\nat 113.)\n\n      Cities pointed out an additional uncertainty: Entergy and the various\n\nOperating Companies had announced a plan to sell all of their transmission\n\nassets to a third party. If that transaction took place, it would be\n\nimpossible to know what transmission equalization expenses—if\n\n\n                                      41\n\fany—Entergy would incur. (AR, PFD at 113 n.370 (citing AR, Item 171 at\n\n67-68, Binder 4; AR, Tr. at 113-14; AR, Cities Ex. 4 (Goins Direct) at 20-21,\n\nBinder 8).) In addition, TIEC noted that there are cost-recovery\n\nmechanisms available in the event that Entergy’s rate-year costs deviate\n\nsubstantially from its test-year costs.18 Therefore, Entergy’s proposed post-\n\ntest-year transmission costs were unnecessary.\n\n       C.     Entergy failed to meet its burden, and the Commission\n              denied its requested adjustments.\n\n       Entergy did not convince the ALJs that the utility’s proposed\n\nexpenses were known-and-measurable changes to the test-year expenses.\n\nThe ALJs concluded “that [Entergy] failed to meet its burden to prove that\n\nits proposed Rate Year MSS-2 costs are known and measurable.” (AR, PFD\n\nat 116.) The ALJs noted that the MSS-2 formula requires assumptions\n\nabout a great number of variables. “Changes to any of the variables could\n\noccur during the Rate Year, thereby altering the amount paid by (or\n\nreceived by) [Entergy] during the Rate Year.” (Id.) Moreover, “projects\n\nthat underlie [Entergy]’s Rate Year request are largely not yet built, and\n\nmight never be built.” (Id.) And estimates provided by different parties\n\n\n       18\n           Specifically, a Transmission Cost Recovery Factor under 16 Tex. Admin. Code\n§25.239(c) could allow the utility to “recover its reasonable and necessary costs for\ntransmission infrastructure improvement and changes in wholesale transmission\ncharges to the electric utility under a tariff approved by a federal regulatory authority to\nthe extent that the costs or charges have not otherwise been recovered.”\n\n                                            42\n\fvaried widely. That “illustrat[ed] the problem of deviating from actual Test\n\nyear data in an area that involves so many future contingencies and\n\nunknowns.” (Id.)\n\n      And the ALJs were persuaded by the intervenors’ evidence which\n\ndemonstrated that Entergy’s estimate of its rate-year MSS-2 costs are not\n\nknown and measurable. (Id.)\n\n      The Commission agreed that Entergy had not met its burden to\n\ndemonstrate its estimated expenses were known and measurable and\n\ndetermined that Entergy’s recoverable expenses should be limited to those\n\nincurred during the test year. (AR, Order, FF 87-94.) Substantial evidence\n\nsupports these findings, and Entergy’s complaint should be overruled.\n\n                                   Prayer\n\n      The Commission asks the Court to affirm the district court’s\n\njudgment on the issues raised by Entergy and OPUC, but to reverse the\n\ndistrict court’s judgment to the extent that it found error in the\n\nCommission’s order. The Commission asks the Court for such other relief\n\nas it may be entitled.\n\n                                Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                KEN PAXTON\n                                Attorney General of Texas\n\n\n\n                                      43\n\fCHARLES E.

In its application, Entergy requested approval of an increase in annual base-\nrate revenues of approximately $111.8 million (later lowered to $104.8 million), proposed tariff\nschedules, including new riders to recover costs related to purchased-power capacity and\nrenewable-energy credit requirements, requested final reconciliation of its fuel costs, and\nrequested waivers to the rate-filing package requirements.\n\n       On July 6, 2012, the State Office of Administrative Hearings (SOAH) administrative law\njudges (ALJs) issued a proposal for decision in which they recommended an overall rate increase\nfor Entergy of $28.3 million resulting in a total revenue requirement of approximately $781\nmillion. The ALJs also recommended approving total fuel costs of approximately $1.3 billion.\nThe ALJs did not recommend approving the renewable-energy credit rider and the Commission\nearlier removed the purchased-power capacity rider as an issue to be addressed in this docket. 1\nOn August 8, 2012, the ALJs filed corrections to the proposal for decision based on the\nexceptions and replies of the parties.2 Except as discussed in this Order, the Commission adopts\nthe proposal for decision, as corrected, including findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n\n       Parties filed motions for rehearing on September 25 and October 4, 2012 and filed replies\nto the motions for rehearing on October I 5, 2012. The Commission considered the motions for\n\n\n       1\n           Supplemental Preliminary Order at 2. 3 (Jan. 19, 2012).\n       2\n           Letter from SOAHjudges to PUC (Aug. 8, 20 12).\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                                  Order on Rehearing                          Page 2 of 44\nSOAH Docket No.\n\n\nrehearing at the October 25, 2012 open meeting. The Commission granted Commission Staffs\nmotion for rehearing that requested technical corrections to reflect the rates that resulted from the\nCommission Staff number-running memo that was filed on August 28, 2012. The Commission\nmodifies findings of fact 205, 206, 208, and 210 as requested by Commission Staff and attaches\nCommission schedules I through V to reflects its decisions.                The Commission granted the\nDepartment of Energy's motion for rehearing requesting that finding of fact 198 be modified to\nreflect the applicable off-season for the schedulable intermittent pwnping service. Finding of\nfact 198 is modified to reflect that the off-season is October through May. In its motion for\nrehearing, Entergy noted that findings of fact 178 and 170 should be modified to more\naccurately reflect the procedural history. The Commission modifies findings of fact 178 and\n170 to state that Entergy agreed to extend time to provide the Commission sufficient time to\nconsider the issues in this proceeding on two occasions-at the July 27 and August 30, 2012\nopen meetings.\n\n\n                                                   I. Discussion\n\n                                     A. Prepaid Pension Asset Balance\n        Entergy included in rate base an approximately $56 million item named Unfunded\nPension. 3 This amount represents. the accumulated difference between the annual pension costs\ncalculated in accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SF AS) No. 87\nand the actual contributions made by Entergy to the pension fund-Entergy contributed nearly\n$56 million more to its pension fund than the minimum required by SFAS No. 87. 4\n\n        In Docket No. 33309, the Commission allowed a pension prepayment asset, excluding\nthe portion of the asset that is capitalized to construction work in progress (CWIP), less accrued\ndeferred federal income taxes (ADFIT) to be included in rate base. 5 For the excluded portion,\nthe Commission allowed the accrual of an allowance for funds used during construction\n\n\n\n        3\n            Proposal for Decision at 23 (July 6. 201 2) (PFD).\n        4\n            PFD at 23-24.\n        s Application of AEP Texas Central Company f or Authority to Change Rates, Docket No. 33 309, Order on\nRehearing (March 4, 2008).\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                               Order on Rehearing                                 Page J   or 44\nSOAH Docket N o . -\n\n\n               6\n(AFUDC).           The ALJs concluded that this approach was sound and should be followed in this\n     7\ncase. Thus, the ALJs recommended that the CWIP-related portion of Entergy's prepaid pension\nasset ($25,311,236) should be excluded from the asset and should accrue AFUDC.8 However.\nthe ALJs did not address ADFIT.\n\n         The Commission agrees that the CWIP-related portion of Entergy's pension asset should\nbe excluded from the asset and that this excluded portion should accrue AFUDC . However, the\nCommi ssion also finds that the impact of this exclusion on Entergy 's ADFIT should be reflected.\nWhen items are excluded from rate base, the related ADFIT should also be excluded. The\nadjusted ADFIT for the prepaid pension asset remaining in Entergy's rate base should be reduced\nby $8,858,933, the deferred taxes related to the excluded $25 million. The Commission adds\nnew finding of fact 28A to reflect this modification to Entergy's AD FIT.\n\n\n                                                  B. FIN 48\n         The Financial Accounting Standards Board's Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48) prescribes\nthe way in which a company must analyze, quantify, and disclose the potential consequences of\ntax positions that the company has taken that are legally uncertain. Entergy reported that its\nuncertain tax positions totaled $5,916,46 1. FIN 48 requires that this amount be recorded on\nEntergy' s balance sheet as a tax liability. Entergy also reported that it made a cash deposit with\nthe IRS in the amount of $1,294,683 associated with its FIN 48 liability.9\n\n         The ALJs concluded that Entergy's FIN 48 liability should be included in its ADFIT\nbalance, but the amount of the cash deposit made by Entergy to the lRS attributable to Entergy ' s\nFIN 48 liability should not be included in Entergy's ADFIT balance. Accordingly, the ALJs\nrecommended that $4,621,778 (Entergy's FIN 48 liability of $5,916,461 less the $1,294,683 cash\ndeposit Entergy has already made with the IRS) be added to Entergy's AOFIT balance and thus\n\n\n\n\n         6\n           Remand of Docket No. 33309 {Application of AEP Texas Central Company for Authority to Change\nRates), Docket No. 38772, Order on Remand (Jan. 20, 2011 ).\n         7\n             PFO at 26.\n         8\n             Id. at 24-26.\n         9\n           PFD at 26-27 (citing Rebuttal Testimony of Roberts, Entergy Ex. 64 at 6), 29 (c iting Rebuttal Testimony\nof Roberts, Entergy Ex. 64 at 8).\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                              Order on Rehearing                            Page 4 of 44\nSOAH Docket N o . -\n\n                                           10\nbe used to offset Entergy's rate base.          The ALJs did not recommend the addition of a deferred-\ntax-account rider because no party expressly advocated the addition of such a rider. 11\n\n        The Commission adopts the proposal for decision regarding the adjustment to Entergy's\nADFIT for the amount attributable to Entergy's FIN 48 liability. However, the Commission also\nfollows its precedent regarding the creation of a deferred-tax-account tracker and modifies the\nproposal for decision on this point. In CenterPoint's Electric Delivery Company's last rate case,\nDocket No. 38339, 12 the Commission found that tax schedule UTP-on which companies must\ndescribe, list, and rank each uncertain tax position-would provide the IRS auditors sufficient\ninformation to quickly determine which uncertain tax positions are of a magnitude worth\ninvestigating and that an IRS audit would be more likely to occur on some uncertain tax\npositions. If an IRS audit of a FIN 48 uncertain tax position results in an unfavorable outcome,\nthe utility would not be able to earn a return on the amount paid to the IRS until the next rate\ncase.\n\n        Accordingly, the Commission authorizes Entergy to establish a rider to track unfavorable\nFIN-48 rulings by the IRS. The rider will also allow Entergy to recover on a prospective basis\nan after-tax return of 8.27% on the amounts paid to the IRS that result from an unfavorable FIN-\n48 unfavorable-tax-position audit. The return will be applied prospectively to FIN-48 amounts\ndisallowed by an IRS audit after such amounts are actually paid to the federal government. If\nEntergy subsequently prevails in an appeal of an unfavorable FIN-48 unfavorable-tax-position\ndecision by the IRS, then any amounts collected under rider related to that overturned decision\nshall be credited back to ratepayers.\n\n        The Commission adds new finding of fact 40A and deletes finding of fact 41 consistent\nwith its decision to authorize the deferred-tax-account tracker.\n\n\n\n\n        10\n             PFD at 29.\n        11\n             /d.at 29.\n        12\n             Application of CenterPoint Electric Delivery Company, LLC for Authority to Change Rates, Docket\nNo. 38339, Order on Rehearing at 3-4 (June 23, 2011).\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                                  Order on Rehearing                                   Page 5 or 44\nSOAH Docket No•. . _\n\n\n                                  C. Capitalized Incentive Compensation\n        Entergy capitalized into plant-in-service accounts some of the incentive payments made\nto employees and sought to include those amounts in rate base. The ALJs determined that\nEntergy should not be able to recover its financially based incentive-compensation costs. 13\nTherefore, the portion of Entergy's incentive-compensation costs capitalized during the period\nJuly 1, 2009 through June 30, 20 I 0 that were financially based was excluded from Entergy's rate\nbase. The ALJs also determined that the actual percentages should be used to determine the\namount that is financially based. 14\n\n        In discussing Entergy's incentive compensation as a component of operating expenses,\nthe ALJs adopted the method advocated by Texas Industrial Energy Consumers (TIEC) fo r\ncalculating the amount of the financially based incentive costs. This method uses the actual\npercentage reductions applicable to each of the annual incentive programs that included a\ncomponent of financially-based costs. 15\n\n        In its exceptions regarding capitalized incentive compensation, Entergy advocated for the\nuse of T IEC's methodology to also calculate the amount of capitalized incentive compensation\nthat is financiall y based. Entergy also noted that the amount of the disallowance reflected in the\nschedules, $1,333,352, was calculated using a disallowance factor that included incentive\ncompensation tied to cost-control measures, which the ALJs found to be recoverable in the\noperating-cost incentive-compensation calculation. 16 When the TIEC methodology is applied to\nthe capitalized incentive-compensation costs in rate base, the net result under TIEC ' s\n                                                                                                 17\nmethodology is that only $335,752.96 should be disallowed from capital costs.\n\n       The Commission agrees that capitalized incentive compensation that is financially based\nshould be excluded from rate base and that the exclusion only applies to incentive costs that\nEntergy capitalized during the period from July I, 2009 through June 30, 2010. However, the\nCommission finds that a consistent methodology should be used to calculate the amount to be\n\n\n        13\n             PFD at 171.\n        14\n             Id at 72.\n        15\n             Id. at 174; see also Entergy's Exceptions to the Proposal for Decision at 25-26 (July 23, 2012).\n        16\n             Entergy's Exceptions to the Proposal for Decision at 25-26.\n        17\n             Id.   at 25-26.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                            Order on Rehearing                       Page 6 of 44\nSOAH Docket No.\n\n\nexcluded and therefore that TIEC 's methodology should also be used for calculating the amount\nof capitalized financially based incentive-compensation costs that should be excluded from rate\nbase. Accordingly, the total amount of capitalized incentive-compensation costs that should be\ndisallowed from rate base is $335,752.96.            Finding of fact 61 is modified to reflect this\ndetennination.\n\n        As noted by Commission Staff, this disallowance to plant-in-service alters the expense\nfor ad valorem taxes. Accounting for this disallowance, the appropriate expense amount for ad\nvalorem taxes is $24,921 ,022, 18 an adjustment of $1 ,222,106 to Entergy's test year amount.\nFinding of fact 15 l is modified to reflect this adjustment to property taxes.\n\n\n                                 D. Rate of Return and Cost of Capital\n        The A Us found the proper range of an acceptable return on equity for Entergy would be\nfrom 9.3 percent to 10.0 percent. 19 The mid-point of the range is 9.65 percent. The ALJs found\nthat the effe·ct of unsettled economic conditions facing utilities on the appropriate return on\nequity should be taken into account and that the effect would be to move the ultimate return on\nequity towards the upper limits of the range that was determined to be reasonable.20 The ALJs\nfound that the reasonable adjustment would be 15 basis points, moving the reasonable return on\nequity to 9.80 percent. 21\n\n        The Commission must establish a reasonable return for a utility and must consider\napplicable factors. 22 The Commission disagrees with the ALJs that a utility's return on equity\nshould be detennined using an adder to reflect unsettled economic conditions facing utilities.\nThe Commission agrees with the ALJs, however, that a return on equity of 9.80 percent will\nallow Entergy a reasonable opportunity to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital, but\nfinds this rate appropriate independent of the 15-point adder recommended by the ALJs. A\nreturn on equity of 9.80 percent is within the range of an acceptable return on equity found by\n\n\n        18\n             Commission Number-Run Memorandum at 2 (Aug. 28, 2012).\n        19\n             PFD at 94.\n        20   Id\n        21\n             Id at 94.\n        22\n             PURA §§ 36.051 , .052.\n\fPUC O~ket No. 39896                                   Order on Rehearing                  Page 7 of 44\nSOAH Docket N o . -\n\n\nthe ALJs.         Accordingly, the Commission adds new finding of fact 65A to reflect the\nCommission' s decision on this point.\n\n\n                                  E. Purchased-Power Capacity Expense\n       The ALJs rejected Entergy's request to recover $31 million more in purchased-power\ncapacity costs than its actual test-year expenses because Entergy had fai led to prove that the\nadjustment was known and measurable,23 and because the request violated the matching\nprinciple.24       Consequently, the ALJs recommended that Entergy' s test-year expenses of\n$245,432,884 be used to set rates in this docket. 25\n\n        Entergy pointed to an additional $533,002 of purchased-power capacity expenses that\nwere properly included in Entergy's rate-filing package, but not provided for in the proposal for\ndeci sion.26 The Commission finds that an additional $533,002 ($6,132 for test-year expenses for\nSouthwest Power Pool fees, $654,082 for Toledo Bend hydro fixed-charges, and -$127,212 for\nan Entergy intra-system billing adjustment that were all recorded in FERC account 555) of\npurchased-power capacity costs were incurred during the test-year and should be added to the\npurchased-power capacity costs in Entergy' s revenue requirement. The Commission modifies\nfindings of fact 72 and 86 to reflect the inclusion of the additional $533,002 of test-year\npurchased-power capacity costs, increasing the total amount to $245,965,886.\n\n\n                                 F. Labor Costs - Incentive Compensation\n        The ALJs found that $6, 196,03 7, representing Entergy's financially-based incentives paid\n                                                                           27\nin the test-year, should be removed from Entergy' s O&M expenses.               The ALJs agreed with\nCommission Staff and Cities that an additional reduction should be made to account for the\nFICA taxes that Entergy would have paid for those costs, 28 but did not include this reduction in a\nfinding of fact.\n\n\n        23\n             PFD at 108-09.\n        24\n             Id. at 109.\n        15\n             Id\n        26\n             Entergy's Exceptions to the Proposal for Decision at 51 .\n        27\n             PFD at 175.\n        28\n             Id at 175-76.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                               Order on Rehearing                         Page 8of 44\nSOAH Docket N o . -\n\n\n        The Commission agrees with the ALJs, but modifies finding of fact 133 to specifically\ninclude the decision that an additional reduction should be made to account for the FICA taxes\nEntergy would have paid on the disallowed financially-based incentive compensation.                   The\nCommission notes that this reduction for FICA taxes is reflected in the schedules attached to this\nOrder.29\n\n\n                                         G. AffiJiate Transactions\n        OPUC argued that Entergy's sales and marketing expenses exclusively benefit the larger\ncommercial and industrial customers, but the majority of the sales, marketing, and customer\nservice expenses are allocated to the operating companies based on customer counts. Therefore,\nthe majority of these expenses are allocated to residential and small business customers. OPUC\nargued that it is inappropriate for residential and small business customers to pay for these\nexpenses.30 The ALJs did not adopt OPUC's position on this issue.\n\n        The Commission agrees with OPUC and reverses the proposal for decision regarding\nallocation of Entergy's sales and marketing expense and finds that $2.086 million of sales and\nmarketing expense should be reallocated using direct assignment.                 The Commission has\npreviously expressed its preference for direct assignment of affiliate expenses. 31                  The\nCommission finds that the following amounts should be allocated based on a total-number-of-\ncustomers basis: ( l ) $46,490 for Project El OPCR56224 - Sales and Marketing - EGSI Texas;\n(2) $17,013 for Project F3PCD10049 - Regulated Retail Systems O&M; and (3) $30,167 fo r\nProject F3PPMMALl2 - Middle Market Mkt. Development. The remainder, $1,992,475, should\nbe assigned to (l) General Service, (2) Large General Service and (3) Large Industrial Power\nService.32 The reallocation has the effect of increasing the revenue requirement allocated to the\nlarge business class customers and reduces the revenue requirement for small business and\nresidential customers. New finding of fact l64A is added to reflect the proper allocation of these\naffiliate transactions.\n\n\n        29\n             See Commission Number Run-Memorandum at 3 (Aug. 28, 2012).\n        30\n             Direct Testimony of Carol Szerszen, OPUC Ex.

Fuel Reconciliation\n       Entergy proposed to allocate costs for the fuel reconciliation to customers using a line-\nloss study performed in 1997. Entergy conducted a line-loss study for the year ending December\n3 1, 2010, which falls in the middle of the two year fuel reconciliation period- July 2009 through\nJune 20 I I- and therefore reflects the actual line losses experienced by the customer classes\nduring the reconciliation period. Cities argued that the allocation of fuel costs incurred over the\nreconciliation period should reflect the current line-loss study performed by Entergy for this case\nand recommended approval on a going-forward basis.                             Fuel factors under P.U.C. SUBST.\nR. 25.237(a)(3) are temporary rates subject to revision in a reconciliation proceeding described\nin P.U.C. SussT. R. 25.236.                   P.U.C. SussT. R. 25.236(d)(2) defines the scope of a fuel\nreconciliation proceeding to include any issue related to the reasonableness of a utility's fuel\nexpenses and whether the utility has over- or under-recovered its reasonable fuel expenses.33\nCities calculated a $3,981 ,27 1 reduction to the Texas retail fuel expenses incurred over the\nreconciliation period using the current line-losses.                       The ALJs rejected Cities' proposed\nadjustment finding that the P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.237(c)(2)(B) requires the use of Commission-\napproved line losses that were in effect at the time fuel costs were billed to customers in a fuel\nreconciliation.34\n\n       The Commission agrees with Cities and reverses the proposal for decision regarding\nwhich line-loss factors should be used in Entergy's fuel reconciliation. Entergy used the 2010\nstudy line-loss calculations to calculate the demand- and energy-related allocations in its cost of\nservice analysis supporting its requested base rates. These same currently available line-loss\nfactors should have been uti lized in Entergy's fuel reconciliation. The Commission finds that\nEntergy' s 20 l 0 line-loss factors should be used to calculate Entergy ' s fuel reconciliation\nover-recovery. As a result, Entergy's fuel reconciliation over-recovery should be reduced by\n$3,981 ,271. Finding of fact 246A and conclusions of law l 9A and 198 are added to reflect the\nCommission's finding that the 2010 line-loss factors be used to reconcile Entergy's fuel costs.\n\n\n\n\n       33\n                Cities' Exceptions to the Proposal for Decision at 20-21 (July 23, 2012) .\n            4\n       .1       PFD at 327-328.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                            Order on Rehearing                    Page lO of 44\nSOAH Docket No.\n\n\n                                    I. MISO Transition Expenses\n       During the Commission' s consideration of the proposal for decision, the parties that\ncontested the amount of Entergy's MISO transition expenses and how the transition expenses\nshould be accounted for reached announced on the record that they had reached an agreement on\nthese issues.35 Those parties agreed that the MISO transition expenses would not be deferred and\nthat Entergy' s base rates should include $1.6 million for MISO transition expense. 36 The\nCommission adopts the agreement of the parties and accordingly modifies finding of fact 251\nand deletes finding of fact 252.\n\n\n                           J. Purchased-Power Capacity Cost Baseline\n       The Commission modified the amount of purchased-power capacity expense in the\ntest-year to be $245,965,886 (see section E above). Finding of fact 255 is modified to reflect the\nchange to the proper test-year purchased-power capacity expense.\n\n\n                                            K. Other Issues\n       New findings of fact 17A, 17B, 17C, 170, and 17 E are added to reflect procedural\naspects of the case after issuance of the proposal for decision.\n\n       In addition, to reflect corrections recommended by the ALJs, findings of fact 116, 123,\n192, 194, and 202 are modified; and new finding of fact l 82A is added.\n\n\nThe Commission adopts the following findings of fact and conclusions of law:\n\n\n                                         II.

ETI serves retail and wholesale electric customers in Texas. As of June 30, 2011 , ETI\n       served approximately 412,000 Texas retail customers. The Federal Energy Regulatory\n       Commission (FERC) regulates ETl ' s wholesale electric operations.\n\n3.     On November 28, 2011, ETI fi led an application requesting approval of: (I) a proposed\n       increase in annual base rate revenues of approximately $ 111 .8 million over adjusted test-\n       year revenues; (2) a set of proposed tariff schedules presented in the Electric Utility Rate\n       Filing Package for Generating Utilities (RFP) accompanying ETI's application and\n       including new riders for recovery of costs related to purchased-power capacity and\n       renewable energy credit requirements; (3) a request for final reconciliation of ETI's fuel\n       and purchased-power costs for the reconciliation period from July 1, 2009 to\n       June 30, 201 l; and (4) certain waivers to the instructions in RFP Schedule V\n       accompanying ETI's application.\n\n4.     The 12-month test-year employed in ETI' s filing ended on June 30, 20 11 (test-year).\n\n5.     ETI provided notice by publication for four consecutive weeks before the effective date\n       of the proposed rate change in newspapers having general circulation in each county of\n       ETI's Texas service territory. ETI also mailed notice of its proposed rate change to all of\n       its customers. Additionally, ETI timely served notice of its statement of intent to change\n       rates on all municipalities retaining original jurisdiction over its rates and services.\n\n6.

On December 7, 2011, the Commission issued its order requesting briefing on threshold\n       legal/policy issues.\n\n9.     On December 19, 2011, the Commission issued its Preliminary Order, identifying 31\n       issues to be addressed in this proceeding.\n\n10.    On December 20, 2011, the Administrative Law Judges (ALJs) issued SOAH Order\n       No. 2, which approved an agreement among the parties to establish a June 30, 2012\n       effective date for the company 's new rates resulting from this case pursuant to certain\n       agreed language and consolidate Application of Entergy Texas, Inc. for Authority to Defer\n       Expenses Related to its Proposed Transition to Membership in the Midwest Independent\n       System Operator, Docket No. 39741 (pending) into this proceeding.

On January 19, 2012, the Commission issued a supplemental preliminary order\n       identifying two additional issues to be addressed in this case and concluding that the\n       company's proposed purchased-power capacity rider should not be addressed in this case\n       and that such costs should be recovered through base rates.\n\n13.    ETI timely filed with the Commission petitions for review of the rate ordinances of the\n       municipalities exercising original jurisdiction within its service territory.     All such\n       appeals were consolidated for determination in this proceeding.\n\n14.    On April 4, 2012, the ALJs issued SOAH Order No. 13 severing rate case expense issues\n       into Application of Entergy Texas, Inc. for Rate Case Expenses Severed from PUC\n       Docket No. 39896, Docket No. 40295 (pending).\n\n15.    On April 13, 2012, ETI adjusted its request for a proposed increase in annual base rate\n       revenues to approximately $104.8 million over adjusted test-year revenues.\n\n16.    The hearing on the merits commenced on April 24 and concluded on May 4, 2012.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                           Order on Rehearing                     Page 13 of 44\nSOAH Docket No. -\n\n\n17.     Initial post-hearing briefs were filed on May 18 and reply briefs were filed on May 30,\n        2012.\n\nl7A.    On August 7, 2012, the SOAH ALJs tiled a letter with the Commission recommending\n        changes to the PFD.\n\nl 7B    At the July 27, 20 12 open meeting, ETI agreed to extend time to August 31, 20 12 to\n        provide the Commission sufficient time to consider the issues in this proceeding.\n\nl 7C.   The Commission considered the proposal for decision at the August 17, 2012 and August\n        30, 2012 open meetings.\n\n170.    At the August 30, 20 12 open meeting, ETI agreed to extend time to September 14, 20 12\n        to provide the Commission sufficient time to consider the issues in this proceeding.\n\nl 7E.   At the August 17, 2012 open meeting, parties announced on the record a settlement of the\n        amount of costs for the transition to MISO.\n\nRate Base\n18.     Capital additions that were closed to ETI's plant-in-service between July 1, 2009 and\n        June 30, 2011, are used and useful in providing service to the public and were prudently\n        incurred.\n\n19.     ETI ' s proposed Hurricane Rita regulatory asset was an issue resolved by the black-box\n        settlement in Application of Entergy Texas, Inc. for Authority to Change Rates and\n        Reconcile Fuel Costs, Docket No. 37744 (Dec. 13, 2010).\n\n20.     Accrual of carrying charges on the Hurricane Rita regulatory asset shou ld have ceased\n        when Docket No. 37744 concluded because the asset would have then begun earning a\n        rate of return as part of rate base.\n\n21.     The appropriate calculation of the Hurricane Rita regulatory asset should begin with the\n        amount claimed by ETI in Docket No. 37744, less amortization accruals to the end of the\n        test-year in the present case, and less the amount of additional insurance proceeds\n        received by ETI after the conclusion of Docket No. 37744.\n\n22.     A Test-Year-end balance of $15, 175,563 for the Hurricane Rita regulatory asset should\n        remain in rate base, applying a five-year amortization rate beginning August 15, 2010.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                        Order on Rehearing                         Page 14 of 44\nSOAH Docket N o . -\n\n\n23 .   The Hurricane Rita regulatory asset should not be moved to the storm damage insurance\n       reserve.\n\n24.    The company requested in rate base its prepaid pension assets balance of $55,973,545,\n       which represents the accumulated difference between the Statement of Financial\n       Accounting Standards (SF AS) No. 87 calculated pension costs each year and the actual\n       contributions made by the company to the pension fund.\n\n25.    The prepaid pension assets balance includes $25,311 ,236 capitalized to construction work\n       in progress (CWIP).\n\n26.    It is not necessary to the financial integrity of ETI to include CWIP in rate base, and there\n       was insufficient evidence showing that major projects under construction were efficiently\n       and prudently managed.\n\n27.    The portion of the prepaid pension assets balance that is capitalized to CWIP should not\n       be included in ETI 's rate base.\n\n28.    The remainder of the prepaid pension assets balance should be included in ETI's rate\n       base.\n\n28A.   When items are excluded from rate base, the related ADFIT should also be excluded.\n       The amount of ADFIT associated with the $25 million capitalized to CWIP and excluded\n       from rate base is $8,858,93 3.      The adjusted ADFIT for the prepaid pension asset\n       remaining in Entergy's rate base should be reduced by $8,858,933.\n\n29.    ETI should be permitted to accrue an allowance for funds used during construction on the\n       portion of ETI ' s Prepaid Pension Assets Balance capitalized to CWIP.\n\n30.    The Financial Accounting Standard Board (F ASB) Financial Interpretation No. 48\n       (FIN 48), \"Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,\" requires ETI to identify each of\n       its uncertain tax positions by evaluating the tax position on its technical merits to\n       determine whether the position, and the corresponding deduction, is more-likely-than-not\n       to be sustained by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) if audited.\n\n31.    FIN 48 requires ETI to remove the amount of its uncertain tax positions from its\n       Accumulated Deferred Federal Income Tax (ADFIT) balance for financial reporting\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                         Order on Rehearing                        Page IS of 44\nSOAH Docket No•• •\n\n\n       purposes and record it as a potential liability with interest to better reflect the company's\n       financial condition.\n\n32.    At test-year-end, ETI had $5,916,461 in FIN 48 liabi lities, meaning ETI has, thus far,\n       avoided paying to the IRS $5,916,46 1 in tax dollars (the FIN 48 liability) in reliance upon\n       tax positions that the company believes will not prevail in the event the positions are\n       challenged, via an audit, by the IRS.\n\n33.    ETI has deposited $ 1,294,683 with the IRS in connection with the FIN 48 liability.\n\n34.    The IRS may never audit ETI as to its uncertain tax positions creating the FIN 48\n       liability.\n\n35.    Even if ETI is audited, ETI might prevail on its uncertain tax positions.\n\n36.    ETI may never have to pay the IRS the FIN 48 liabi lity.\n\n37.    Other than the amount of its deposit with the IRS, ETI has current use of the FIN 48\n       liability funds.\n\n38.    Until actually paid to the IRS, the FIN 48 liability represents cost-free capital and should\n       be deducted from rate base.\n\n39.    The amount of $4,621,778 (representing ETl's full FIN 48 liability of $5,916,461 less the\n       $ 1,294,683 cash deposit ETI has made with the IRS for the FIN 48 liability) should be\n       added to ETI's ADFIT and thus be used to reduce ETI's rate base.\n\n40.    ETI 's application and proposed tariffs do not include a request for a tracking mechanism\n       or rider to collect a return on the FfN 48 liability.\n\n40A.   It is appropriate for ETI to create a deferred-tax-account tracker in the form of a rider to\n       recover on a prospective basis an after- tax return of 8.27% on the amounts paid to the\n       IRS that result from an unfavorable FfN 48 audit. The rider will track unfavorable FIN\n       48 rulings and the return will be applied prospectively to FIN 48 amounts disallowed by\n       an IRS audit after such amounts are actually paid to the tederal government. If ETI\n       prevails in an appeal of a FIN 48 decision, then any amounts collected under the rider\n       related to that decision should be credited back to ratepayers.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                       Order on Rehearing                        Page 16 of 44\nSOAH Docket No•. . _\n\n\n41 .   Deleted.\n\n42.    Investor-owned electric utilities may include a reasonable allowance for cash working\n       capital in rate base as determined by a lead-lag study conducted in accordance with the\n       Commission's rules.\n\n43.    Cash working capital represents the amount of working capital, not specifically addressed\n       in other rate base items, that is necessary to fund the gap between the time expenditures\n       are made and the time corresponding revenues are received.\n\n44.    The lead-lag study conducted by ETl considered the actual operations of ETI, adjusted\n       for known and measurable changes, and is consistent with P.U.C.                    SUBST.\n\n       R. 25.231 (c)(2)(B)(iii).\n\n45.    It is reasonable to establish ETI's cash working capital requirement based on ETI's lead-\n       lag study as updated in Jay Joyce's rebuttal testimony and on the cost of service approved\n       for ETI in this case.\n\n46.    As a result of the black-box settlements in Application of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. for\n       Authority to Change Rates and to Reconcile Fuel Costs, Docket No. 34800 (Nov. 7,\n       2008) and Docket No. 37744, the Commission did not approve ETI's storm damage\n       expenses since 1996 and its storm damage reserve balance.\n\n47.    ETI established a prima facie case concerning the prudence of its storm damage expenses\n       incurred since 1996.\n\n48.    Adjustments to the storm damage reserve balance proposed by intervenors should be\n       denied.\n\n49.    The Hurricane Rita regulatory asset should not be moved to the storm damage insurance\n       reserve.\n\n50.    ETI's appropriate Test-Year-end storm reserve balance was negative $59,799,744.\n\n51.    The amount of $9,846,037, representing the value of the average coal inventory\n       maintained at ETI ' s coal-burning facilities, is reasonable, necessary, and should be\n       included in rate base.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                        Order on Rehearing                          Page 17 of 44\nSOAH Docket N o -\n\n\n52.    The Spindletop gas storage facility (Spindlctop facility) is used and useful in providing\n       reliable and flexible natural gas supplies to ETI's Sabine Station and Lewis Creek\n       generating plants.\n\n53.    The Spindletop facility is critical to the economic, reliable operation of the Sabine Station\n       and Lewis Creek generating plants due to their geographic location in the far western\n       region of the Entergy system.\n\n54.    It is reasonable and appropriate to include ETI' s share of the costs to operate the\n       Spindletop facil ity in rate base.\n\n55.    Staff recommended updating ETI' s balance amounts for short-term assets to the 13-\n       month period ending December 20 11 , which was the most recent information available.\n       Staff's proposed adjustments should be incorporated into the calculation of ETI's rate\n       base.\n\n56.    The following short-term asset amounts should be included in rate base: prepayments at\n       $8, 134,35 1; materials and supplies at $29,285,42 1; and fuel inventory at $52,693,485.\n\n57.    The amount of $1, 127,778, representing costs incurred by ETI when it acquired the\n       Spindletop facility, represent actual costs incurred to process and close the acquisition,\n       not mere mark-up costs.\n\n58.    ETI' s $1,127,778 in capitalized acquisition costs should be included in rate base because\n       ETI incurred these costs in conjunction with the purchase of a viable asset that benefits\n       its retail customers.\n\n59.    In its application, ETI capitalized into plant in service accounts some of the incentive\n       payments ETI made to its employees. ETI seeks to include those amounts in rate base.\n\n60.    A portion of those capitalized incentive accounts represent payments made by ETI for\n       incentive compensation tied to financial goals.\n\n6 1.   The portion of ETI's incentive payments that are capitalized and that are financially-\n       based should be excluded from ETI's rate base because the benefits of such payments\n       inure most immediately and predominantly to ETI' s shareholders, rather than its electric\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                         Order on Rehearing                       Page 18 of 44\nSOAH Docket No.\n\n\n       customers.      ETl' s capitalized incentive compensation that is financially based is\n       $335,752.96 and should be removed for rate base.\n\n62.    The test-year for ETI's prior ratemaking proceeding ended on June 30, 2009, and the\n       reasonableness of ETI's capital costs (including capitalized incentive compensation) for\n       that prior period was dealt with by the Commission in that proceeding and is not at issue\n       in this proceeding.\n\n63.    In this proceeding, ETI's capitalized incentive compensation that is financially-based\n       should be excluded from rate base, but only for incentive costs that ETI capitalized\n       during the period from July l , 2009 (the end of the prior test-year) through June 30, 2010\n       (the commencement of the current test-year).\n\nRate ofReturn and Cost of Caoital\n64.    A return on common equity (ROE) of 9.80 percent will allow ETI a reasonable\n       opportunity to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital.\n\n65.    The results of the discounted cash flow model and risk premium approach support a ROE\n       of 9.80 percent.\n\n65A.   It is not appropriate to add 15 points to the ROE due to unsettled economic conditions\n       facing utilities.\n\n66.    A 9.80 percent ROE is consistent with ETI's business and regulatory risk.\n\n67.    ETI's proposed 6.74 percent embedded cost of debt is reasonable.\n\n68.    The appropriate capital structure for ETI is 50.08 percent long-term debt and\n       49.92 percent common equity.\n\n69.    A capital structure composed of 50.08 percent debt and 49.92 percent equity is\n       reasonable in light of ETI' s business and regulatory risks.\n\n70.    A capital structure composed of 50.08 percent debt and 49.92 percent equity will help\n       ETI attract capital from investors.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                         Order on Reheuing                         Page 19 or 44\nSOAH Docket N o . -\n\n\n71.

ETI's test-year purchased capacity expenses were $245,965,886.\n\n73.    ETI requested an upward adjustment of $30,809,355 as a post-test-year adjustment to its\n       purchased capacity costs. This request was based on ETl's projections of its purchased\n       capacity expenses during a period beginning June I, 2012 and ending May 31 , 20 13 (the\n       rate-year).\n\n74.    ETl's purchased capacity expense projections were based on estimates of rate-year\n       expenses for: (a) reserve equalization payments under Schedule MSS-1; (b) payments\n       under third-party capacity contracts; and (c) payments under affiliate contracts.\n\n75.    ETI's projection of its rate-year reserve equalization payments under Schedule MSS-1 is\n       based on numerous assumptions, including load growths for ETI and its affiliates, future\n       capacity contracts for ETI and its affiliates, and future values of the generation assets of\n       ETI and its affiliates.\n\n76.    There is substantial uncertainty with regard to ETI' s projection of its rate-year reserve\n       equalization payments under Schedule MSS-1.\n\n77.    ETI 's projection of its rate-year third-party capacity contract payments includes\n       numerous assumptions, one of which is that every single third-party supplier will perform\n       at the maximum level under the contract, even though that assumption is inconsistent\n       with ETI's historical experience.\n\n78.    There is substantial uncertainty with regard to ETI's projection of its rate-year third-party\n       capacity-contract payments.\n\n79.    ETI's estimates of its rate-year purchases under affili ate contracts are based on a\n       mathematical formula set out in Schedule MSS-4.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                         Order on Rehearing                      Page 20 of 44\nSOAH Docket No.\n\n\n80.    The MSS-4 fonnula for rate-year af1iliate capacity payments reflects that these payments\n       will be based on ratios and costs that cannot be determined until the month that the\n       payments are to be made.\n\n81.    Over $11 million of ETI's affiliate transactions were based on a 2013 contract (the EAi\n       WBL Contract) that was not signed until April 11 , 2012.\n\n82.    There is uncertainty about whether the EAi WBL Contract will ever go into effect\n\n83.    ETI projects purchasing over 300 megawatts (MW) more in purchased capacity in the\n       rate-year than it purchased in the test-year.\n\n84.    ETI experienced substantial load growth in the two years before the test-year, and it\n       continues to project similar load growth in the future.\n\n85.    ETI did not meet its burden of proof to demonstrate that a known and measurable\n       adjustment of $30,809,355 should be made to its test-year purchased capacity expenses.\n\n86.    ETI's purchased capacity expense in this case should be based on the test-year level of\n       $245,965,886.\n\n87.    ETI incurred $1,753,797 of transmission equalization expense during the test-year.\n\n88.    ETI proposed an upward adjustment of $8,942,785 for its transmission equalization\n       expense. This request was based on ETI' s projections of its transmission equalization\n       expenses during the rate-year.\n\n89.    The transmission equalization expense that ETI will pay in the rate-year will depend on\n       future costs and loads for each of the Entergy operating companies.\n\n90.    ETI's projection of its rate-year transmission equalization expenses is uncertain and\n       speculati ve because it depends on a number of variables, including future transmission\n       investments, deterred taxes, depreciation reserves, costs of capital, tax rates, operating\n       expenses, and loads of each of the Entergy operating companies.\n\n91.    ETI seeks increased transmission equalization expenses for transmission projects that are\n       not currently used and useful in providing electric service.          ETI's post-test-year\n       adjustment is based on the assumption that certain planned transmission projects will go\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                            Order on Rthtuing                         Page 21or44\nSOAH Docket N o . -\n\n\n         into service after the test-year.      At the close of the hearing, none of the planned\n         transmission projects had been fully completed and some were still in the planning phase.\n\n92.      It is not reasonable for ETI to charge it-; retail ratepayers for transmission equalization\n         expenses related to projects that are not yet in-service.\n\n93.      ETI's request for a post-test-year adjustment of $8,942,785 for rate-year transmission\n         equalization expenses should be denied because those expenses are not known and\n         measurable. Ell's post-test-year adjustment does not with reasonable certainty reflect\n         what ETI's transmission equalization expense will be when rates are in effect.\n\n94.      ETl's transmission equalization expense in this case should be based on the test-year\n         level of$1,753,797.\n\n95.      P.U.C. SuBST. R. 25.23 l(c)(2)(ii) states that the reserve for depreciation is the\n         accumulation of recognized allocations of original cost, representing the recovery of\n         initial investment over the estimated useful life of the asset.\n\n96.      Except in the case of the amortization of the general plant deficiency, the use of the\n         remaining life depreciation method to recover differences between theoretical and actual\n         depreciation reserves is the most appropriate method and should be continued.\n\n97.      It is reasonable for ETI to calculate depreciation reserve allocations on a straight-line\n         basis over the remaining, expected useful life of the item or facility.\n\n98.      Except as described below, the service lives and net salvage rates proposed by the\n         company are reasonable, and these service lives and net salvage rates should be used in\n         calculating depreciation rates for the company's production, transmission, distribution,\n         and general plant assets.\n\n99.      A 60-year life for Sabine Units 4 and 5 is reasonable for purposes of establishing\n         production plant depreciation rates.\n\nI 00.    The retirement (actuarial) rate method, rather than the interim retirement method, should\n         be used in the development of production plant depreciation rates.\n\nl0 I .   Production plant net salvage is reasonably based on the negative five percent net salvage\n         in existing rates.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                        Order on Rehearing                        Page 22 of44\nSOAH Docket No.\n\n\nI02.     The net salvage rate of negative IO percent for ETI 's transmission structures and\n         improvements (FERC Account 352) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should\n         be adopted.\n\n103.     The net salvage rate of negative 20 percent for ETI's transmission station equipment\n         (FERC Account 353) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be adopted.\n\n104.     The net salvage rate of negative five percent for ETI's transmission towers and fixtures\n         (FERC Account 354) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be adopted.\n\n105.     The net salvage rate of negative 30 percent for ETI's transmission poles and fixtures\n         (FERC Account 355) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be adopted.\n\nI06.     The net salvage rate of negative 30 percent for ETI 's transmission overhead conductors\n         and devices (FERC Account 356) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be\n         adopted.\n\nI 07.    A service life of 65 years and a dispersion curve of R3 for ETI's distribution structures\n         and improvements (FERC Account 361) are the most reasonable of those proposed and\n         should be approved.\n\nI 08.    A service life of 40 years and a dispersion curve of RI for ETI's distribution poles,\n         towers, and fixtures (FERC Account 364) are the most reasonable of those proposed and\n         should be approved.\n\nI09.     A service life of 39 years and a dispersion curve of R0.5 for ETI's distribution overhead\n         conductors and devices (FERC Account 365) are the most reasonable of those proposed\n         and should be approved.\n\nI I 0.   A service life of 35 years and a dispersion curve of R l.5 for ETI's distribution\n         underground conductors and devices (FERC Account 367) are the most reasonable of\n         those proposed and should be approved.\n\n111.     A service life of 33 years and a dispersion curve of L0.5 for ETI's distribution line\n         transformers (FERC Account 368) are the most reasonable of those proposed and should\n         be approved.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                        Order on Rehearing                       Page 23 of 44\nSOAH Docket N o . -\n\n\n112.    A service life of 26 years and a dispersion curve of L4 for ETI's distribution overhead\n        service (FERC Account 369.1) are the most reasonable of those proposed and should be\n        approved.\n\n11 3.   The net salvage rate of negative five percent for ETI's distribution structures and\n        improvements (FERC Account 36 1) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should\n        be adopted.\n\n114.    The net salvage rate of negative 10 percent for ETl's distribution station equipment\n        (FERC Account 362) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be adopted.\n\n11 5.   The net salvage rate of negative seven percent for ETl's distribution overhead conductors\n        and devices (FERC Account 365) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be\n        adopted.\n\n116.    The net salvage rate of positive five percent for ETl's distribution line transformers\n        (FERC Account 368) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be adopted.\n\n117.    The net salvage rate of negative 10 percent for ETl's distribution overhead services\n        (FERC Account 369. l) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be adopted.\n\n118.    The net salvage rate of negative 10 percent for ETI' s distribution underground services\n        (FERC Account 369.2) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be adopted.\n\n119.    A service life of 45 years and a dispersion curve of R2 for ETI's general structures and\n        improvements (FERC Account 390) are the most reasonable of those proposed and\n        should be approved.\n\n120.    The net salvage rate of negative 10 percent for ETl' s general structures and\n        improvements (FERC Account 390) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should\n        be adopted.\n\n121.    It is reasonable to convert the $21.3 million deficit that has developed over time in the\n        reserve for general plant accounts to General Plant Amortization.\n\n122.    A ten-year amortization of the deficit in the reserve for general plant accounts is\n        reasonable and should be adopted.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                         Order on Rehearing                        Page 24 of 44\nSOAH Docket No.\n\n\n123.   FERC pronouncement AR-15 requires amortization over the same life as recommended\n       based on standard life analysis. A standard life analysis determined that a five-year life\n       was appropriate for general plant computer equipment (FERC Account 391.2).\n       Therefore, a five year amortization for this account is reasonable and should be adopted.\n\n124.   ETI proposed adjustments to its test-year payroll costs to reflect: (a) changes to employee\n       headcount levels at ETI and Entergy Services. Inc. (ESI); and (b) approved wage\n       increases set to go into effect after the end of the test-year.\n\n125.   The proposed payroll adjustments are reasonable but should be updated to reflect the\n       most recent available information on headcount levels as proposed by Commission Staff.\n       In addition to adjusting payroll expense levels, the more recent headcount numbers\n       should be used to adjust the level of payroll tax expense, benefits expense, and savings\n       plan expense.\n\n126.   Staff has appropriately updated headcount levels to the most recent available data but\n       errors made by Staff should be corrected. The corrections related to:        (a) a double\n       counting of three ETI and one ES I employee; (b) inadvertent use of the ETI benefits cost\n       percentage in the calculation of ESI benefits costs; (c) an inappropriate reduction of\n       savings plan costs when such costs were already included in the benefits percentage\n       adjustments; and (d) corrections for full-time equivalents calculations.        Staffs ETI\n       headcount adjustment (AG-7) overstated operation and maintenance (O&M) payroll\n       reduction by $224,217, and ESI headcount adjustment (AG-7) understated O&M payroll\n       increase by $37,531.\n\n127.   ETI included $14,187,744 for incentive compensation expenses in its cost of service.\n\n128.   The compensation packages that ETI offers its employees include a base payroll amount,\n       annual incentive programs, and long-term incentive programs. The majority of the\n       compensation is for operational measures, but some is for financial measures.\n\n129.   Incentive compensation that is based on financial measures is of more immediate and\n       predominant benefit to shareholders, whereas incentive compensation based on\n       operational measures is of more immediate and predominant benefit to ratepayers.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                           Order on Rehearing                    Page 25 of 44\nSOAH Docket No.\n\n\n130.   Incentives to achieve operational measures are necessary and reasonable to provide utility\n       services but those to achieve financial measures are not.\n\n131.   The $5,3 76,975 that was paid for long term incentive programs was tied to financial\n       measures and, therefore, should not be included in ETI' s cost of service.\n\n132.   Of the amounts that were paid pursuant to the Executive Annual Incentive Plan, $819,062\n       was tied to financia l measures and, therefore, should be disallowed.\n\n133.   In total, the amount of incentive compensation that should be disallowed is $6, 196,037\n       because it was related to financial measures that are not reasonable and necessary for the\n       provision of electric service. An additional reduction should be made to account for the\n       FICA taxes ETI would have paid on the disallowed financially based incentive\n       compensation.\n\n134.   The amount of incentive compensation that should be included in the cost of service is\n       $7,991, 707.\n\n135.   To attract and retain highly qualified employees, the Entergy companies provide a total\n       package of compensation and benefits that is equivalent in scope and cost with what other\n       comparable companies within the utility business and other industries provide for their\n       employees.\n\n136.   When using a benchmark analysis to compare companies' levels of compensation, it is\n       reasonable to view the market level of compensation as a range rather than a precise,\n       single point.\n\n137.   ETI' s base pay levels are at market.\n\n138.   ETI's benefits plan levels are within a reasonable range of market levels.\n\n139.   ETI's level of compensation and benefits expense is reasonable and necessary.\n\n140.   ETI provides non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plans for highly\n       compensated individuals such as key managerial employees and executives that, because\n       of limitations imposed under the Internal Revenue Code, would otherwise not receive\n       retirement benefits on their annual compensation over $245,000 per year.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                        Order on Rehearing                         Page 26 of 44\nSOAH Docket No•. . . _\n\n\n141.   ETI' s non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plans are discretionary costs\n       designed to attract, retain, and reward highly compensated employees whose interests are\n       more closely aligned with those of the shareholders than the customers.\n\n142.   ETI's non-qualified executive retirement benefits in the amount of $2, 114,931 are not\n       reasonable or necessary to provide utility service to the public, not in the public interest,\n       and should not be included in ETI's cost of service.\n\n143.   For the employee market in which ETI operates, most peer companies offer moving\n       assistance. Such assistance is expected by employees, and ETI would be placed at a\n       competitive disadvantage if it did not offer relocation expenses.\n\n144.   ETI's relocation expenses were reasonable and necessary.\n\n145.   The company's requested operating expenses should be reduced by $40,620 to reflect the\n       removal of certain executive prerequisites proposed by Staff.\n\n146.   Staff properly adjusted the company's requested interest expense of$68,985 by removing\n       $25,938 from FERC account 431 (using the interest rate of 0.12 percent for calendar year\n       2012), leaving a recommended interest expense of $43,047.\n\n147.   During the test-year, ETI's property tax expense equaled $23,708,829.\n\n148.   ETI requested an upward proforma adjustment of $2,592,420, to account for the property\n       tax expenses ETI estimates it will pay in the rate-year.\n\n149.   ETI's requested proforma adjustment is not reasonable because it is based, in part, upon\n       the prediction that ETI's property tax rate will be increased in 2012, a change that is\n       speculative is not known and measurable.\n\n150.   Staff's recommendation to increase ETI's test-year property tax expenses by $1,214,688\n       is based on the historical effective tax rate applied to the known test-year-end plant in\n       service value, consistent with Commission precedent, and based upon known and\n       measurable changes.\n\n151.   ETI's test-year property tax burden should be adjusted upward by $1,222,106 for a total\n       expense of $24,921,022.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                        Order on Rehearing                          Page 27 or44\nSOAH Docket N o . -\n\n\n152.    Staff recommended reducing ETI's advertising, dues, and contributions expenses by\n       $12,800. The recommendation, which no party contested, should be adopted.\n\n153.   The final cost of service should reflect changes to cost of service that affect other\n       components of the revenue requirement such as the calculation of the Texas state gross\n        receipts tax, the local gross receipts tax, the PUC Assessment Tax and the Uncollectible\n        Expenses.\n\n154.    The company's requested Federal income tax expense is reasonable and necessary.\n\n155.    ETI's request for $2,019,000 to be included in its cost of service to account for the\n        company' s annual decommissioning expenses associated with River Bend is not\n        reasonable because it is not based upon \"the most current information reasonably\n        available regarding the cost of decommissioning\" as required by P.U.C. SuesT.\n        R. 25.231(b)(l)(F)(i).\n\n156.    Based on the most current information reasonably available, the appropriate level of\n        decommissioning costs to be included in ETI's cost of service is $1, 126,000.\n\n157.    ETI' s appropriate total annual self-insurance storm damage reserve expense is\n        $8,270,000, comprised of an annual accrual of $4,400,000 to provide for average annual\n        expected storm losses, plus an annual accrual of $3,870,000 for 20 years to restore the\n        reserve from its current deficit.\n\n158.    ETI' s appropriate target self-insurance storm damage reserve is $17,595,000.\n\n159.    ETI should continue recording its annual storm damage reserve accrual until modified by\n        a Commission order.\n\n160.    The operating costs of the Spindletop facility are reasonable and necessary.\n\n161.    The operating costs of the Spindletop facility paid to PB Energy Storage Services are\n        eligible fuel expenses.\n\nAffiliate Transactions\n162.    ETI affiliates charged ETI $78,998,777 for services during the test-year. The majority of\n        these O&M expenses- $69,098,041- were charged to ETI by ESL                The remaining\n        affiliate services were charged (or credited) to ETI by: Entergy Gulf States Louisiana,\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                         Order on Rehearing                         Page 28 of 44\nSOAH Docket No.\n\n\n       L.L.C.; Entergy Arkansas, Inc.; Entergy Louisiana, LLC; Entergy Mississippi, Inc.;\n       Entergy Operations, Inc.; and non-regulated affiliates.\n\n163.   ESI follows a number of processes to ensure that affiliate charges are reasonable and\n       necessary and that ETI and its affiliates are charged the same rate for similar services.\n       These processes include: (a) the use of service agreements to define the level of service\n       required and the cost of those services; (b) direct billing of affiliate expenses where\n       possible; (c) reasonable allocation methodologies for costs that cannot be directly billed;\n       (d) budgeting processes and controls to provide budgeted costs that are reasonable and\n       necessary to ensure appropriate levels of service to its customers; and (e) oversight\n       controls by ETI's Affiliate Accounting and Allocations Department.\n\n164.   Affiliates charged expenses to ETI through 1292 project codes during the test-year.\n\nl 64A. The $2,086, 145 in affiliate transactions related to sales and marketing expenses should be\n       reallocated using direct assignment. The following amounts should be allocated to all\n       retail classes in proportion to number of customers:                ( I) $46,490 for Project\n       EIOPCR56224 - Sales and Marketing - EGSI Texas; (2) $ 17,013 for Project\n       F3PCD10049 - Regulated Retail Systems O&M; and (3) $30,167 for Project\n       F3PPMMALI2 - Middle Market Mkt. Development. The remainder, $1 ,992,475, should\n       be assigned to ( 1) General Service, (2) Large General Service and (3) Large Industrial\n       Power Service.\n\n165.   ETI agreed to remove the following affiliate transactions from its application:\n       ( I) Project F3PPCASHCT (Contractual Alternative/Cashpo) in the amount of $2,553;\n       (2) Project F3 PCS PETE I (Entergy-Tulane Energy Institute) in the amount of $14,288;\n       and (3) Project F5PPKATRPT (Stonn Cost Processing & Review) in the amount of $929.\n\n166.   The $356,151 (which figure includes the $112,53 1 agreed to by ETI) of costs associated\n       with Projects F5PCZUBENQ (Non-Qualified Post Retirement) and F5PPZNQBDU (Non\n       Qual Pension/Benf Dom Utl) are costs that are not reasonable and necessary for the\n       provision of electric utility service and are not in the public interest.\n\n167.   The $10,279 of costs associated with Project F3PPFXERSP (Evaluated Receipts\n       Settlement) are not nonnally-recurring costs and should not be recoverable.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                         Order on Rehearing                         Page 29 of44\nSOAH Docket N o . -\n\n\n168.   The $19,714 of costs associated with Project F3PPEASTIN (Willard Eastin et al) are\n        related to ESl's operations, it is more immediately related to Entergy Louisiana, Inc. and\n        Entergy New Orleans, Inc. As such, they are not recoverable from Texas ratepayers.'\n\n169.   The $171,032 of costs associated with Project F3PPE9981S (Integrated Energy\n        Management for ESI) are research and development costs related to energy efficiency\n        programs. As such, they should be recovered through the energy efficiency cost recovery\n        factor rather than base rates.\n\n170.    Except as noted in the above findings of fact Nos. 162-169, all remaining affiliate\n        transactions were reasonable and necessary, were allowable, were charged to ETI at a\n        price no higher than was charged by the supplying affiliate to other affiliates, and the rate\n        charged is a reasonable approximation of the cost of providing service.\n\nJurisdictional Cost Allocation\n171.    ETI has one full or partial requirements wholesale customer - East Texas Electric\n        Cooperative, Inc.\n\n172.    ETI proposes that 150 MW be set as the wholesale load for developing retail rates in this\n        docket. Using 150 MW to set the wholesale load is reasonable. The 150 MW used to set\n        the wholesale load results in a retail production demand allocation factor of\n        95.3838 percent.\n\n173.    The 12 Coincident Peak (12 CP) allocation method is consistent with the approach used\n        by the FERC to allocate between jurisdictions.\n\n174.    Using l 2CP methodology to allocate production costs between the wholesale and retail\n       jurisdictions is the best method to reflect cost responsibility and is appropriate based on\n        ETI's reliance on capacity purchases.\n\nClass Cost Allocg/ion and Rate Design\n175.   There is no express statutory authorization for ETI's proposed Renewable Energy Credits\n       rider (REC rider).\n\n176.   REC rider constitutes improper piecemeal ratemaking and should be rejected.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                            Order on Rehearing                      Page JO of 44\nSOAH Docket No.\n\n\n177.   ETI's test-year expense for renewable energy credits, $623,303, is reasonable and\n       necessary and should be included in base rates.\n\n178.   Municipal Franchise Fees (MFF) is a rental expense paid by utilities for the right to use\n       public rights-of-way to locate its facilities within municipal limits.\n\n179.   ETI is an integrated utility system.         ETI's facilities located within municipal limits\n       benefit all customers, whether the customers are located inside or outside of the\n       municipal limits.\n\n180.   Because all customers benefit from ETI' s rental of municipal right-of-way, municipal\n       franchise fees should be charged to all customers in ETI's service area, regardless of\n       geographic location.\n\n181.   It is reasonable and consistent with the Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA)\n       § 33.008(b) that MFF be allocated to each customer class on the basis of in-city kilowatt\n       hour (kWh) sales, without an adjustment for the MFF rate in the municipality in which a\n       given kWh sale occurred.\n\n182.   The same reasons for allocating and collecting MFF as set out in Finding of Fact\n       Nos. 178-181 also apply to the allocation and collection of Miscellaneous Gross Receipts\n       Taxes. The company's proposed allocation of these costs to all retail customer classes\n       based on customer class revenues relative to total revenues is appropriate.\n\n182A. ETI's proposed gross plant-based allocator is an appropriate method for allocating the\n       Texas franchise tax.\n\n183.   The Average and Excess ( A&E) 4CP method for allocating capacity-related production\n       costs, including reserve equalization payments, to the retail classes is a standard\n       methodology and the most reasonable methodology.\n\n184.   The A&E 4CP method for allocating transmission costs to the retail classes is standard\n       and the most reasonable methodology.\n\n185.   ETI appropriately followed the rate class revenue requirements from its cost of service\n       study to allocate costs among customer classes. ETl's revenue allocation properly sets\n       rates at each class's cost of service.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                          Order on Rehearing                         PageJI of44\nSOAH Docket No. -\n\n\n186.    It is reasonable for ETI to eliminate the service condition for Rate Groups A and C in\n        Schedule SHL [Street and Highway Lighting Service] that charges a $50 fee for any\n        replacement of a functioning light with a lower-wattage bulb.\n\n187.    It is appropriate to require ETI to prepare and fil e, as part of its next base rate case, a\n        study regarding the foasi bil ity of instituting LED-based rates and, if the study shows that\n        such rates are feasible, ETI should file proposals for LED-based lighting and traffic\n        signal rates in its next rate case.\n\n188.    An agreement was reached by the parties and approved by the Commission in Docket\n        No. 37744 that directed ETI to exclude, in its next rate case, the life-of-contract demand\n        ratchet for existing customers in the Large Industrial Power Service (LI PS), Large\n        Industrial Power Service-Time of Day, General Service, General Service-Time of Day,\n        Large General Service, and Large General Service-Time of Day rate schedules.\n\n189.    ETI's proposed tariffs in this case did not remove the life-of -contract demand ratchet\n        from these rate schedules consistent with the parties' agreement in Docket No. 37744.\n\n190.    A perpetual billing obl igation based on a life-of-contract demand ratchet, as ETI\n        proposed, is not reasonable.\n\n19 1.   ETI's proposed LIPS and LIPS Time of Day tariffs should be modified to reflect the\n        agreement that was adopted by the Commission as just and reasonable in Docket\n        No. 37744. Accordingly, these tariffs should be modified as set out in Findings of Fact\n        No. 192-1 94.\n\nl 92.   ETI's Schedule LIPS and LIPS Time of Day§ Vl should be changed to read:\n                        DETERMINATION OF BILLING LOAD\n\n                        The kW of Billing Load will be the greatest of the fo llowing:\n\n                        {A) The Customer's maximum measured 30-minute\n                        demand during any 30-minute interval of the current billing\n                        month, subject to §§ Ill , IV and V above; or\n\n                         (B) 75% of Contract Power as defined in § Vil; or\n\n                        (C) 2,500 kW.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                        Order on Rehearing                         Page 32 of44\nSOAH Docket No.\n\n\n193.   ETl's Schedule LIPS and LIPS Time of Day§ VU should be changed to read:\n                       DETERMINATION OF CONTRACT POWER\n\n                       Unless Company gives customer written notice to the contrary,\n                       Contract Power will be defined as below:\n\n                       Contract Power - the highest load established under § VI(A) above\n                       during the 12 months ending with the current month. For the\n                       initial 12 months of Customer's service under the currently\n                       effective contract, the Contract Power shall be the kW specified in\n                       the currently effective contract unless exceeded in any month\n                       during the initial 12-month period.\n\n194.   The Large General Service, Large General Service-Time of Day, General Service, and\n       General Service-Time of Day schedules should be similarly revised to eliminate ETI's\n       life-of-contract demand ratchet.\n\n195.   In its proposed rate design for the LIPS class, the company took a conservative approach\n       and increased the current rates by an equal percentage. This minimized customer bill\n       impacts while maintaining cost causation principles on a rate class basis.\n\n196.   It is a reasonable move towards cost of service to add a customer charge of $630 to the\n       LIPS rate schedule with subsequent increases to be considered in subsequent base rate\n       cases.\n\n197.   It is a reasonable move towards cost of service to slightly decrease the LIPS energy\n       charges   and    increase   the    demand   charges   as   proposed    by    Staff   witness\n       William B. Abbott.\n\n198.   DOE proposed a new Schedule LIPS rider-Schedule \"Schedulable Intermittent\n       Pumping Service\" (SIPS) for load schedulable at least four weeks in advance, that occurs\n       in the off-season (October through May), that can be cancelled at any time, and for load\n       not lasting more than 80 hours in a year. For customers whose loads match these SIPS\n       characteristics (for example, DOE's Strategic Petroleum Reserve), the 12-month demand\n       ratchet provision of Schedule LIPS does not apply to demands set under the provisions of\n       the SCPS rider. The monthly demand set under the SIPS provisions would be applicable\n       for billing purposes only in the month in which it occurred. In short, if a customer set a\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                       Ortler on Rehearing                       Page 33 of 44\nSOAH Docket No. -\n\n\n       12-month ratchet demand in that month, it would be forgiven and not applicable in the\n       succeeding 12 months.\n\n199.   DOE's proposed Schedule SIPS ts not restricted solely to the DOE and should be\n       adopted. It more closely addresses specific customer characteristics and provides for\n       cost-based rates, as does another ETI rider applicable to Pipeline Pumping Service.\n\n200.   Standby Maintenance Service (SMS) is available to customers who have their own\n       generation equipment and who contract for this service from ETI.\n\n201.   P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.242(k)(l) provides that rates for sales of standby and maintenance\n       power to qualifying faci lities should recognize system wide costing principles and should\n       not be discriminatory.\n\n202.   It is reasonable to move Schedule SMS toward cost of service by: (a) adding a customer\n       charge equivalent to that of the LIPS rate schedule only for SMS customers not\n       purchasing supplementary power under another applicable rate; and (b) revising the tariff\n       as follows:\n                                       Distribution         Transmission\n                         Charge\n                                    (less than 69KV)     (69KV and greater)\n                       Billing Load Charge ($/kW):\n                       Standby            $2.46                  $0.79\n                       Maintenance        $2.27                  $0.60\n                       Non-Fuel Ener!!v Charge (¢/kWh)\n                       On-Peak           4.245¢                  4.074¢\n                       Off-Peak          0.575¢                  0.552¢\n\n\n203.   ETI's Additional Facilities Charge rider (Schedule AFC) prescribes the monthly rental\n       charge paid by a customer when ETI installs faci lities for that customer that would not\n       normally be supplied, such as line extensions, transformers, or dual feeds.\n\n204.   ETI existing Schedule AFC provides two pricing options. Option A is a monthly charge.\n       Option B, which applies when a customer elects to amortize the directly-assigned\n       facil ities over a shorter term ranging from one to ten years, has a variable monthly\n       charge.   There is also a term charge that applies after the faci lity has been fully\n       depreciated.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                         Order on Rehearing                          Page 34 of 44\nSOAH Docket No.-\n\n\n205.    It is reasonable and cost-based to reduce the Schedule AFC Option A rate to 1.11 percent\n        per month of the installed cost of all facilities included in the agreement for additional\n        facilities.\n\n206.    It is reasonable and cost-based to reduce the Schedule AFC Option B monthly rate and\n        the Post Term Recovery Charge as follows:\n\n        Selected Recovery Term      Recovery Term Charge       Post Recovery Term Charge\n                      1                      9.52%                        0.28%\n                      2                      5. 14%                       0.28%\n                      3                      3.68%                        0.28%\n                      4                      2.95%                        0.28%\n                      5                      2.52%                        0.28%\n                      6                      2.23%                        0.28%\n                      7                      2.03%                        0.28%\n                      8                      1.88%                        0.28%\n                      9                      1.76%                        0.28%\n                      10                     1.67%                        0.28%\n\n\n207.    The revisions in the above findings of fact to Schedule AFC rates reasonably reflect the\n        costs of running, operating, and maintaining the directly-assigned facilities.\n\n208.    It is reasonable to modify the Large General Service rate schedule by increasing the\n        demand charge from $8.56 to $11.43; decreasing the energy charge from $.00854 to\n        $.00458; and reducing the customer charge to $260.00.\n\n209.    Staff's proposed change to the General Service (GS) rate schedule to gradually move GS\n        customers towards their cost of service by recommending a decrease in the customer\n        charge from the current rate of $41.09 to $39.91, and a decrease in the energy charges is\n        reasonable and should be adopted.\n\n2 10.   ETI's Residential Service (RS) rate schedule is composed of two elements: a customer\n        charge and a consumption-based energy charge. In the months November through April\n        (winter), the rates are structured as a declining block, in which the price of each unit is\n        reduced after a defined level of usage. ETI's proposed increase in the RS customer\n        charge to $6 per month is reasonable and should be adopted. For the RS summer rate and\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                             Order on Rehearing                     Page 35 of 44\nSOAH Docket No. -\n\n\n         the first winter block rate, the 6.296¢ per kWh energy charge resulting from the increased\n         revenue requirement fo r residential customers is reasonable and should be adopted.\n\n2 11 .   ETI's Schedule RS declining block rate structure is contrary to energy-efficiency efforts\n         and   ~he   Legislature's goal of reducing both energy demand and energy consumption in\n         Texas, as stated in PURA § 39.905.\n\n2 12.    Schedule RS winter block rates should be modified consistent with the goal set out in\n         PURA § 39.905, with the initial phase-in of a 20 percent reduction in the block\n         differential proposed by ETI and subsequent reductions should be reviewed for\n         consideration at the occurrence of each rate case filing.\n\n213.     Other elements of Schedule RS are just and reasonable.\n\nFuel Rec1mci/iation\n2 14.    ETI incurred $616,248 ,686 in natural-gas expenses during the reconciliation period,\n         which is from July 2009 through June 2011.\n\n215.     ETI purchased natural gas in the monthly and daily markets and pursuant to a long-term\n         contract with Enbridge Inc. pipeline. ETI also transported gas on its own account and\n         negotiated operational balancing agreements with various pipeline companies.\n\n2 16.    ETI employed a diversified portfolio of gas supply and transportation agreements to meet\n         its natural-gas requirements, and ETI prudently managed its gas-supply contracts.\n\n217.     ETI' s natural gas expenses were reasonable and necessary expenses incurred to provide\n         reliable electric service to retail customers.\n\n2 18.    ETI incurred $90,82 1,317 in coal expenses during the reconciliation period.\n\n219.     ETI prudently managed its coal and coal-related contracts during the reconciliation\n         period.\n\n220.     ETI monitored and audited coal invoices from Louisiana Generating, LLC for coal\n         burned at the Big Cajun II, Unit 3 facility.\n\n22 l.    ETI's coal expenses were reasonable and necessary expenses incurred to provide reliable\n         electric service to retail customers.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                          Order on Rehearing                       Page36 of 44\nSOAH C>ocket N o . -\n\n\n222.    ETI incurred $990,04 1,434 in purchased-energy expenses during the reconciliation\n        period.\n\n223.    The Entergy System's planning and procurement processes for purchased-power\n        produced a reasonable mix of purchased resources at a reasonable price.\n\n224.    During the reconciliation period, ETI took advantage of opportunities in the fuel and\n        purchased-power markets to reduce costs and to mitigate against price volatility.\n\n225.    ETI' s purchased-energy expenses were reasonable and necessary expenses incurred to\n        provide reliable electric service to retail customers.\n\n226.    ETI provided sufficient contemporaneous documentation to support the reasonableness of\n        its purchased-power planning and procurement processes and its actual power purchases\n        during the reconciliation period.\n\n227.    The Entergy system sold power off system when the revenues were expected to be more\n        than the incremental cost of supplying generation for the sale, subject to maintaining\n        adequate reserves.\n\n228.    The System Agreement is the tariff approved by the FERC that provides the basis for the\n        operation and planning of the Entergy system, including the six operating companies.\n        The System Agreement governs the wholesale-power transactions among the operating\n        companies by providing for joint operation and establishing the bases for equalization\n        among the operating companies, including the costs associated with the construction,\n        ownership, and operation of the Entergy system facilities.\n\n229.    Under the terms of the Entergy System Agreement, ETJ was allocated its share of\n        revenues and expenses from off-system sales.\n\n230.    During the reconciliation period, ETI recorded off-system sales revenue in the amount of\n        $376,671 ,969 in FERC Account 447 and credited 100 percent of off-system sales\n        revenues and margins from off-system sales to eligible fuel expenses.\n\n23 1.   ETI properly recorded revenues from off-system sales and credited those revenues to\n        eligible fuel costs.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                        Order on Rehearing                         Page 37 of 44\nSOAH Docket No.-\n\n\n232.   The Entergy system consists of six operating companies, including ETI, which are\n       planned and operated as a single, integrated electric system under the tenns of the System\n       Agreement.\n\n233.   Service schedule MSS-1 of the System Agreement detennines how the capabi lity and\n       ownership costs of reserves for the Entergy system are equalized among the operating\n       companies.      These inter-system \"reserve equalization\" payments are the result of a\n       fonnula rate related to the Entergy system's reserve capability that is applied on a\n       monthly basis.\n\n234.   Reserve capability under service schedule MSS- 1 is capability in excess of the Entergy\n       system's actual or planned load built or acquired to ensure the reliable, efficient operation\n       of the electric system.\n\n235.   By approving service schedule MSS-1 , the FERC has approved the method by which the\n       operating companies share the cost of maintaining sufficient reserves to provide\n       reliability for the Entergy system as a whole.\n\n236.   Service schedule MSS-3 of the System Agreement detennines the pricing and exchange\n       of energy among the operating companies. By approving service schedule MSS-3, the\n       FERC has approved the method by which the operating companies are reimbursed for\n       energy sold to the exchange energy pool and how that energy is purchased.\n\n237.   Service schedule MSS-4 of the System Agreement sets forth the method for determining\n       the payment for unit power purchases between operating companies.             By approving\n       service schedule MSS-4, the FERC has approved the methodology for pricing\n       inter-operating company unit power purchases.\n\n238.   The Entergy system is planned using multi-year, annual, seasonal, monthly, and next-day\n       horizons. Once the planning process has identified the most economical resources that\n       can be used to reliably meet the aggregate Entergy system demand, the next step is to\n       procure the fuel necessary to operate the generating units as planned and acquire\n       wholesale power from the market.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                          Order on Rehearing                      Page 38 of 44\nSOAH Docket No.\n\n\n239.   Once resources are procured to meet forecasted load, the Entergy system is operated\n       during the current day using all the resources available to meet the total Entergy system\n       demand.\n\n240.   After current-day operation, the System Agreement prescribes an accounting protocol to\n       bill the costs of operating the system to the individual operating companies. This\n       protocol is implemented via the intra-system bill to each operating company on a\n       monthly basis.\n\n241.   ETI purchased power from affiliated operating companies per the terms of service\n       schedule MSS-3 of the System Agreement. The payments made under Schedule MSS-3\n       to affiliated operating companies are reasonable and necessary, and the FERC has\n       approved the pricing formula and the obligation to purchase the energy. ETI pays the\n       same price per megawatt hour for energy under service schedule MSS-3 as does any\n       other operating company purchasing energy under service schedule MSS-3 during the\n       same hour.\n\n242.   The Spindletop facility is used primarily to ensure gas-supply reliability and guard\n       against gas-supply curtailments that can occur as a result of extreme weather or other\n       unusual events.\n\n243.   The Spindletop facility provides a secondary benefit of flexibility in gas supply. ETI can\n       back down gas-fired generation to take advantage of more economical wholesale power,\n       or use gas from storage to supplement gas-fired generation when load increases during\n       the day and thereby avoid more expensive intra-day gas purchases.\n\n244.   ETI's customers received benefits from the Spindletop facility during the reconciliation\n       period through reliable gas supplies and ETI's monthly and daily storage activity.\n\n245.   ETI prudently managed the Spindletop facility to provide reliability and flexibility of gas\n       supply for the benefit of customers.\n\n246.   ETI proposed new loss factors, based on a December 2010 line-loss study, to be applied\n       for the purpose of allocating its costs to its wholesale customers and retail customer\n       classes.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                             Order on Rehearing                     Page 39 of 44\nSOAH Docket N o . -\n\n\n246A. ETI 's 20 I 0 line-loss factors should be used to reconcile ETI's fuel costs. Therefore,\n        ETI 's fuel reconciliation over-recovery should be reduced by $3, 981,271.\n\n247.    ETl's proposed loss factors are reasonable and shall be implemented on a prospective\n        basis as a result of this final order.\n\n248.    ETI seeks a special-circumstances exception to recover $99,715 resulting from the\n        FERC's reallocation of rough production equalization costs in FERC Order No. 720-A,\n        and to treat such costs as eligible fuel expense.\n\n249.    Special circumstances exist and it is appropriate for ETI to_recover the rough production\n        cost equalization costs reallocated to ETI as a result of the FERC 's decision in Order\n        No. 720-A.\n\nOt/1er Issues\n250.    A deferred accounting of ETI' s Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator\n        (MISO) transition expenses is not necessary to carry out any requirement of PURA.\n\n251.    ETI should include $1.6 million in base rates for MISO transition expense.\n\n252.    Deleted.\n\n253.    Transmission Cost Recovery Factor basel ine values should be set during the compliance\n        phase of this docket, after the Commission makes final rulings on the various contested\n        issues that may affect this calculation.\n\n254.    Distribution Cost Recovery Factor baseline values should be set during the compliance\n        phase of this docket, after the Commission makes final rulings on the various contested\n        issues that may affect this calculation.\n\n255.    The appropriate amount for ETI's purchased-power capacity expense to be included in\n        base rates is $245,965,886.\n\n256.    The amount of ETI's purchased-power capacity expense includes third-party contracts,\n        legacy affiliate contracts, other affiliate contracts, and reserve equalization. Whether the\n        amounts for all contracts should be included in the baseline for a purchased-capacity rider\n        that may be approved in Project No. 39246 is an issue that should be decided in that\n        project.\n\fPUC Docket No. 39896                       Order on Rehearing                          Page 40 of 44\nSOAH Docket No.\n\n\n                                   III. Conclusions of Law\n1.     ETI is a \"public utility\" as that term is defined in PURA § 11.004(1) and an \"electric\n       utility\" as that term is defined in PURA§ 31.002(6).\n\n2.     The Commission exercises regulatory authority over ETI and jurisdiction over the subject\n       matter of this application pursuant to PURA§§ 14.001, 32.001 , 32.101, 33.002, 33.051,\n       36.101- .111, and 36.203.\n\n3.

INTRODUCTION [Germane to Preliminary Order Issue Nos. 1 and 4]\n\n        Entergy Texas, Inc. (ETI or the Company) is an investor-owned electric utility with a retail\nservice area located in southeastern Texas. ETI serves retail and wholesale electric customers in\nTexas. As of June 30, 2011, ETI served approximately 412,000 Texas retail customers. The Federal\nEnergy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulates ETI's wholesale electric operations.\n\n\n        On November 28, 2011, ETI filed an application requesting approval of: (1) a proposed\nincrease in annual base rate revenues of approximately $111.8 million over adjusted revenues for the\nperiod beginning July l, 2010, and ending June 30, 2011 (Test Year); (2) a set of proposed tariff\nschedules presented in the Electric Utility Rate Filing Package for Generating Utilities accompanying\nETI' s application and including new riders for recovery of costs related to purchased power capacity\nand renewable energy credit requirements; (3) a request for final reconciliation of ETI's fuel and\npurchased power costs for the reconciliation period from July 1, 2009, to June 30, 2011\n(Reconciliation Period); and (4) certain waivers to the instructions in Rate Filing Package\nSchedule V accompanying ETI's application. The rate year for ETI's proposed changes is June 1,\n2012, through May 31, 2013 (Rate Year). 1 On April 13, 2012, adjusted its request for a proposed\nincrease in annual base rate revenues to approximately $104.8 million over adjusted Test Year\nrevenues.\n\n\n1\n   During the hearing the parties used the term \"Rate Year\" to refer to the period June 2012 through May\n2013. This was intended to represent the first 12 months of the rates adopted in this case. However, the rates\nin this case will not go into effect (as temporary rates) until at least June 30, 2012. Nevertheless, for purposes\nof this PFD, Rate Year will refer to the period June 2012 through May 2013.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                  PAGE2\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n                               II.     JURISDICTION AND NOTICE\n\n          The Public Utility Commission of Texas (Commission or PUC) has jurisdiction over ETI and\nthis rate case application pursuant to Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA) §§ 14.001, 32.001,\n33.002, and 35.004. The State Office of Administrative Hearings (SOAH) has jurisdiction over the\ncontested case hearing, including the preparation of the proposal for decision (PFD) pursuant to\nPURA§ 14.053 and Tex. Gov'tCode§ 2003.049(b). Those municipalities inETI's service areathat\nhave not surrendered jurisdiction to the Commission continue to have exclusive original jurisdiction\nover ETI' s rates, operations, and services in their respective municipalities pursuant to PURA\n§ 33.001. When ETI filed its application with the Commission, it also filed the application with its\noriginal jurisdiction cities. Pursuant to PURA§§ 32.00l(b), 33.051, and 33.053, ETI appealed the\nactions of the original jurisdiction cities to the Commission and had those appeals consolidated with\nthis docket.\n\n\n          ETI' s notice of its application and notice of the hearing were not contested and, therefore, do\nnot require further discussion but will be addressed in the proposed findings of fact and conclusions\nof law.\n\n\n                                III.    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n          As noted above, ETI filed its application and rate filing package on November 28, 2011. On\nNovember 29, 2011, the Commission referred this proceeding to SOAH. On December 19, 2011,\nthe Commission issued its Preliminary Order setting forth 31 issues to be addressed in this\nproceeding. On January 19, 2012, the Commission issued a Supplemental Preliminary Order listing\ntwo additional issues to be considered and stating that ETI' s request for a purchased power cost\nrecovery rider should not be addressed in this docket.\n\n\n          On September 2, 2011, ETI filed an application requesting authority to defer accounting\nrelated to its proposed transition to membership in the Midwest Independent Transmission System\nOperator, Inc. (MISO). This proceeding was docketed as Docket No. 39741. On November 22,\n2011, the Commission issued its Preliminary Order in Docket No. 39741 addressing certain\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                  PAGE3\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nthreshold legal/policy questions and setting forth nine issues to be addressed in the proceeding. On\nDecember 20, 2011, Docket No. 39741 was consolidated into this docket for all purposes.\n\n\n        The following entities were granted intervenor status in this case: Texas Industrial Energy\nConsumers (TIEC); State of Texas State Agencies (State Agencies); Office of Public Utility Counsel\n(OPC); the Cities of Anahuac, Beaumont, Bridge City, Cleveland, Conroe, Dayton, Groves, Houston,\nHuntsville, Montgomery, Navasota, Nederland, Oak Ridge North, Orange, Pine Forest, Rose City,\nPinehurst, Port Arthur, Port Neches, Shenandoah, Silsbee, Sour Lake, Splendora, Vidor, and West\nOrange (Cities); The Kroger Co. (Kroger); Wal-Mart Stores, LLC, and Sam's East, Inc. (Wal-Mart);\nEast Texas Electric Cooperative, Inc. (ETEC); and the United States Department of Energy (DOE).\n\n\n        The hearing on the merits convened before SOAH Administrative Law Judges (ALJs)\nThomas H. Walston, Steven D. Arnold, and Hunter Burkhalter on April 24, 2012, and continued\nthrough May 4, 2012. The record remained open for the filing of post-hearing briefs and proposed\nfinds of fact and conclusions of law. On June 8, 2012, the parties filed proposed finds of fact and\nconclusions of law and the record closed. As permitted byP.U.C. PROC. R. 22.261(a), AU Lilo D.\nPomerleau read the record and joined in writing the PFD. Number running began on June 26, 2012,\nand Staff returned the final numbers to the AU s on July 3, 2012. The parties requested that the AUs\nsubmit their PFD so the Commission could consider the matter at its July 27, 2012, open meeting.\n\n\n        The following is a list of the parties who participated in the hearing and their counsel:\n\n\n     PARTIES                       REPRESENTATIVES\n     ETI                           Steven H.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n       ETI proposed an overall increase of approximately $104.8 million. The AUs recommend an\noverall rate increase for ETI of $16.4 million, as shown on the schedules attached to this PFD. With\nrespect to ETI' s request to reconcile fuel and purchased power costs during the Reconciliation\nPeriod, the AU s recommend approval without change. Attachment A contains the schedules\nprovided by Commission Staff reflecting the ALls' recommendations. On issues of particular\nsignificance, the AUs' recommendations are set forth below.\n\n\nA.     Rate Base\n\n       1. Capital Investment\n\n       ETI's capital additions closed to plant in service between July 1, 2009, and June 30, 2011,\nwere prudently incurred and are used and useful in providing service to ETI's customers.\n\n\n       2. Hurricane Rita Regulatory Asset\n\n       The appropriate calculation of the Hurricane Rita regulatory asset should begin with the\namount claimed by ETI in Docket No. 37744,3 less amortization accruals to the end of the Test Year\nin the present case, and less the amount of additional insurance proceeds received by ETI after the\nconclusion of Docket No. 37744. This produces a remaining balance of$15,175,563, which should\nremain in rate base as a regulatory asset, applying a five-year amortization rate that commenced\nAugust 15, 2010. Further, the Hurricane Rita regulatory asset should not be moved to the storm\ninsurance reserve.\n\n\n3\n  Application of Entergy Texas, Inc. for Authority to Change Rates and Reconcile Fuel Costs, Docket\nNo. 37744 (Dec. 13, 2010).\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                    PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGES\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n       3. Prepaid Pension Asset Balance\n\n       The construction work in progress (CWIP)-related portion of ETI's pension asset\n($25,311,236 out of the total asset) should be excluded from the asset, but accrue allowance for\nfunds used during construction.\n\n\n       4. FIN 48 Tax Adjustment\n\n       The Commission should find that $4,621,778 (representing ETI's full FIN 48 Liability of\n$5,916,461 less the $1,294,683 cash deposit ETI has made with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)\nfor the FIN 48 Liability) should be added to ETI's ADFIT and thus be used toreduceETI'srate base.\n\n\n       5. Cash Working Capital\n\n       The AU s recommend no changes to ETI' s cash working capital.\n\n\n       6. Self-Insurance Storm Reserve\n\n       The Commission should approve ETI' s Test Year-end storm reserve balance of negative\n$59,799,744.\n\n\n       7. Coal Inventory\n\n       The full value of ETI's coal inventory was reasonable and should be included in rate base.\n\n\n       8. Spindletop Gas Storage Facility\n\n       The Spindletop Gas Storage Facility (Spindletop Facility) is a used and useful facility\nproviding reliability and swing flexibility to ETI' s customers at a reasonable price and should be\nincluded in rate base.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                     PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE6\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n        9. Short Term Assets\n\n        The ALls recommend Staffs proposal to include the following amounts in rate base:\nprepayments at $8,134,351 ($916,313 more than ETI's request); materials and supplies at\n$29,285,421 ($32,847 more than ETI's request); and fuel inventory at $52,693,485 ($1,066,490 less\nthan ETI' s request).\n\n\n        10. Acquisition Adjustment\n\n        The $1,127, 778 incurred by ETI in internal acquisition costs associated with the purchase of\nthe Spindletop Facility was reasonable, necessary, properly incurred, and should be included in rate\nbase.\n\n\n        11. Capitalized Incentive Compensation\n\n        The Test Year for ETI' s prior ratemak:ing proceeding ended on June 30, 2009. The\nreasonableness ofETI's capital costs (including capitalized incentive compensation) was dealt with\nby the Commission in that proceeding and is not at issue here. Thus, exclusion of capitalized\nincentive compensation that is financially-based can only be made for incentive costs that ETI\ncapitalized during the period from July 1, 2009 (the end of the prior Test Year) through June 30,\n2010 (the commencement of the current Test Year).\n\n\nB.      Rate of Return and Capital Structure\n\n        The ALls recommend a return on equity (ROE) of 9.80 percent; a cost of debt of\n6. 74 percent; a capital structure comprised of 50.08 percent debt and 49 .92 percent common equity;\nand an overall rate of return of 8.27 percent. This is a downward adjustment to ETI' s request for a\n10.60 percent ROE, and no change to ETI's 6.74 percent cost of debt and 50.08/49.92 capital\nstructure. It compares to Staffs proposed 9.60 percent ROE; OPC's proposed 9.30 percent ROE;\nTIEC's proposed 9.50 percent ROE; Cities' proposed 9.50 percent ROE; and State Agencies'\nproposed 9.30 percent ROE. No party opposed ETI's proposed 6.74 percent cost of debt or its\nproposed 50.08/49.92 capital structure.\n\fSOAHDOCKET N O . -                    PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE7\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nC.     Cost of Service\n\n       1. Purchased Power Capacity Expense\n\n       ETI's purchased power capacity costs should be set at the amount of the Company's Test\nYear level, which is $245,432,884.\n\n\n       2. Transmission Equalization (MSS-2) Expense\n\n       ETI should recover only the amount of expenses under Schedule MSS-2 of the Entergy\nSystem Agreement it paid in the Test Year, $1,753,797.\n\n\n       3. Depreciation Expense\n\n       The interim retirements methodology should not be adopted. The values proposed by ETI\nshould be adopted except for the following:\n\n\n       Service Lives:\n       Account 364-40 R 1.\n       Account 368-33 L0.5.\n\n       Net Salvage:\n       Production Plant- negative 5 percent.\n       Account 354-negative 5 percent\n       Account 361-negative 5 percent.\n       Account 362-negative 10 percent.\n       Account 368-negative 5 percent.\n       Account 369.1-negative 10 percent.\n       Account 369.2-negative 10 percent.\n\n\n       4. Labor Costs\n\n           »   Payroll and Related Aqjustments\n\n       The Commission should accept: (1) the payroll adjustments proposed in theETI application;\nand (2) the further payroll adjustments proposed by Staff as corrected by ETI.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                 PAGES\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n           >   Incentive Compensation\n\n       ETI should not be entitled to recover its financially based incentive compensation costs.\nThus, the AU s recommend removing $6, 196,03 7 from ETI' s requested operation and maintenance\n(O&M) expenses. Additionally, an additional reduction should be made to account for the FICA\ntaxes that ETI would have paid as a result of those costs.\n\n\n           >   Compensation and Benefit Levels\n\n       ETI met its burden to prove the reasonableness of its base pay and incentive package costs. It\nis reasonable to view market price for these categories of costs as lying within a range of +/-\n10 percent of median, rather than being a single point along a spectrum. As to both base pay and the\nincentive package, ETI has proven that its costs fall within such an acceptable range. Accordingly,\nthe AlJs recommend rejecting the adjustments sought by Cities.\n\n\n           >   Nonqualified Executive Retirement Benefits\n\n       The AlJs recommend an adjustment to remove $2,114,931, representing the full costs\nassociated with ETI' s non-qualified executive retirement benefits.\n\n\n           >   Employee Relocation Costs\n\n       The Commission should allow ETI' s relocation expenses.\n\n\n           >   Executive Perquisites\n\n       The AlJs recommend an adjustment to remove $40,620, representing the full cost of ETI' s\nexecutive perquisite costs.\n\n\n       5. Interest on Customer Deposits\n\n       The AlJs recommend using the active customer deposits amount of $35,872,476 and the\n2012 interest rate, which produces a recommended interest expense of $43,047 ($35,872,476\nmultiplied by .12 percent).\n\fSOAHDOCKET N O . -                      PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE9\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n       6. Property (Ad Valorem) Tax Expense\n\n       ETI's property tax burden should be adjusted upward by applying the effective tax rate of\n0.007435784 for the calendar year 2011 to the final, adopted Test Year-end plant in service value for\nETI.\n\n\n       7. Advertising, Dues, and Contributions\n\n       The AUs recommend an adjustment to remove $12,800 fromETI's costs of advertising, dues\nand contributions.\n\n\n       8. Other Revenue Related Adjustments\n\n       These amounts were determined through number running and are reflected in Attachment A.\n\n\n       9. Federal Income Tax\n\n       The Commission should adopt ETI' s proposal on federal income taxes.\n\n\n       10. River Bend Decommissioning Expense\n\n       ETI' s annual decommissioning revenue requirement should reflect the most current\ncalculation of $1,126,000. Therefore, an adjustment of $893,000 to the proforma cost of service is\nneeded to reflect the difference between the requested level for decommissioning costs of $2,019,000\nand the recommended level of $1,126,000.\n\n\n       11. Self-Insurance Storm Reserve Expense\n\n       The Commission should approve a total annual accrual of $8,270,000, comprised of an\nannual accrual of $4,400,000 to provide for average annual expected storm losses, plus an annual\naccrual of $3,870,000 for 20 years to restore the reserve from its current deficit. The ALls\nrecommend approval of ETI's proposed target reserve of $17,595,000. The Commission should\nrequire ETI to continue recording its annual accrual until modified by future Commission orders.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                     PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE 10\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n         12. Spindletop Gas Storage Facility\n\n         The AU s recommend inclusion of the costs of operating the Spindletop Facility as requested\nbyETI.\n\n\nD.       Affiliate Transactions\n\n         ETI agreed to remove the following affiliate transactions from its request, which the AU s\nrecommend be approved: (1) Project F3PPCASHCT (Contractual Altemative/Cashpo) in the\namount of $2,553; (2) Project F3PCSPETEI (Entergy-Tulane Energy Institute) in the amount of\n$14,288; and (3) Project F5PPKATRPT (Storm Cost Processing & Review) in the amount of $929.\nExcept as noted below, all remaining affiliate transactions should be approved.          The AU s\nrecommend that the following affiliate transactions not be included:\n\n\n                    $356,151 (which figure includes the $112,531 agreed to by ETI) of costs\n                    associated with Projects F5PCWBENQ (Non-Qualified Post Retirement)\n                    and F5PPZNQBDU (Non Qual Pension/Bent Dom Utl);\n\n                    $10,279 of costs associated with Project F3PPFXERSP (Evaluated\n                    Receipts Settlement);\n\n                    $19,714 of costs associated with Project F3PPEASTIN (Willard Eastin et\n                    al); and\n\n                    $171,032 of costs associated with Project F3PPE9981S (Integrated\n                    Energy Management for ESI).\n\nE.

Class Cost Allocation\n\n       1. Renewable Energy Credit Rider\n\n       The Commission should deny ETI' s request to institute a renewable energy credit rider, and\nthe Test Year expense of $623,303 should be used for setting rates in this case. Finally, the\nRenewable Portfolio Standard Calculation Opt-Out Credit Rider should be maintained, with an\nadjustment to the credit rates to reflect the Test Year data used to set ETI's base rates.\n\n\n       2. Class Cost Allocation\n\n       The parties generally agreed that ETI's cost-of-service study comported with accepted\nindustry practices, but some parties had issues with specific items discussed below.\n\n\n                    (a) Municipal Franchise Fees\n\n       Municipal franchise fees should be allocated on the basis of in-city kilowatt-hour (kWh)\nsales, without an adjustment for the municipal franchise fee rate in the municipality in which a given\nkWh sale occurred. The AUs recommend adoption of ETI's proposal to collect costs from all\ncustomers taking service from the system.\n\n\n                    (b) Miscellaneous Gross Receipts Tax\n\n       Similar to municipal franchise fees, miscellaneous gross receipts taxes should be allocated to\nthe rate classes according to ETI's cost of service study.\n\n\n                    (c) Capacity-Related Production Costs\n\n       The AUs recommend the use of Average and Excess 4 Coincident Peak (A&E 4CP) to\nallocate capacity-related production costs, as proposed by ETI. The AUs do not find sufficient\nsupport to allocate the reserve equalization payments differently than other capacity-related\nproduction costs.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE12\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n                   (d) Transmission Costs\n\n       ETI' s proposed methodology for allocation of transmission costs should be approved. A&E\n4CP is a well-accepted method for allocating such costs.\n\n\n       3.

The study should include detailed information regarding differences in the cost of\nserving LED and non-LED lighting customers, if ETI currently has LED lighting customers taking\nservice.

MISO Transition\n\n       The Commission should deny ETI's request for deferred accounting of its MISO transition\nexpenses to be incurred on or after January 1, 2011. However, the Commission should authorize ETI\nto include $2.4 million of MISO transition expense in base rates set in the present case, based on a\nfive-year amortization of $12 million in total projected expenses. Further, the Commission should\nauthorize ETI to include in base rates $52,800 in MISO transition expenses for the 2010 portion of\nthe Test Year expenses, plus $2.4 million for the post Test Year adjustment, for a total of\n$2,452,800.\n\n\n       V.

Hurricane Rita Regulatory Asset\n\n        Hurricane Rita struck the upper Texas coast in September 2005, causing extensive property\ndamage. In 2006, the Texas Legislature enacted PURA Chapter 39 to authorize electric utilities such\nas ETI to securitize the recovery of their reconstruction costs incurred as a result of Hurricane Rita.\nUnder the statute, the amount of reconstruction costs to be securitized had to be reduced by the\ninsurance proceeds and government grants received by a utility. If additional insurance or grant\nproceeds were received after the securitization order was approved, the Commission was required to\ntake those amounts into account in the utility's next base rate case. This was provided in\nSection 39.459(c) of PURA:\n\n\n        To the extent a utility subject to this subchapter receives insurance proceeds,\n        governmental grants, or any other source of funding that compensates it for hurricane\n        reconstruction costs, those amounts shall be used to reduce the utility's hurricane\n        reconstruction costs recoverable from customers. If the timing of a utility's receipt of\n        those amounts prevents their inclusion as a reduction to the hurricane reconstruction\n        costs that are securitized, the commission shall take those amounts into account in:\n\n                (1) the utility's next base rate proceeding; or\n                (2) any proceeding in which the commission considers hurricane\n                    reconstruction costs.\n\n        Docket No. 32907 was the proceeding for ETI to determine the amount of Hurricane Rita\nreconstruction costs that it could securitize, net of any proceeds received from insurance or\n                     5\ngovernment grants.       In that case, ETI asserted that it incurred $393,236,384 in Hurricane Rita\nreconstruction costs for its Texas Retail jurisdiction. The parties reached a settlement in that case,\nwhich set ETI's hurricane reconstruction expenses eligible for securitization at $381,236,384. In\naddition, ETI estimated that it would receive $65,700,000 in future insurance proceeds that, pursuant\n\n5\n  Application of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. for Determination of Hurricane Reconstruction Costs, Docket\nNo. 32907 (Dec. 1, 2006).\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                  PAGE16\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nto the settlement, was deducted from the amount to be securitized. The parties also agreed that after\nETI received all of its insurance payments, a true-up would occur to reflect the difference between\nthe $65,700,000 credited and the amount actually received. The settlement agreement provided that\nif ETI received more insurance payments than estimated, the excess payments would be passed\nthrough to ratepayers in the form of a rider; however, the agreement did not address how an under-\nrecovery by ETI would be handled. It turned out that ETI received only $46,013,904 in insurance\nproceeds,6 leaving a $19 ,686,096 under-recovery by ETI, which the parties refer to as Overestimated\nInsurance Proceeds. 7\n\n\n          Docket No. 37744 was ETI's next base rate case after Docket No. 32907. In Docket\nNo. 37744, ETI requested recovery of the Overestimated Insurance Proceeds by establishing a\nregulatory asset of $19,686,096, plus accrued carrying costs, to be amortized over five years. 8\nDocket No. 37744 also concluded by a black-box settlement, and neither the Stipulation and\nSettlement Agreement nor the Order entered by the Commission specifically addressed the proposed\nregulatory asset or any other recovery for Overestimated Insurance Proceeds.\n\n\n          In the present case, ETI has again sought approval of a regulatory asset to recover\n$26,229,627, for the balance of Overestimated Insurance Proceeds, plus carrying costs through\nJune 30, 2011. 9 Cities objected to the amount of ETI's request. They argue that this issue was\nresolved in Docket No. 37744 and that ETI should have been amortizing the asset since the\nconclusion of that case. Staff also argues that the issue was resolved in Docket No. 37744 and\nrequested that ETI' s request be denied entirely; or, alternatively, that it should be considered partially\namortized and accordingly reduced. ETI argues that the issue was not resolved in Docket No. 37744\nand that it should be allowed a full recovery in the present case. Alternatively, ETI argues that\nCities' proposed reduction was not calculated correctly.\n\n\n\n6\n    See Docket No. 32907, Final Order at FoF 27.

In addition, he argues that ETI should not have continued to accrue interest on\nthe balance that was added into rate base in that docket, because it would have then earned a rate of\nreturn. Therefore, Mr. Garrett's adjustment started with the balance of $25,278,210 that ETI\nrequested in Docket No. 37744. He reduced that balance by $9,479,329 for amortization between\nthe date rates went into effect in Docket No. 37744 and the date that rates will go into effect in the\ncurrent case (22.5 months). Mr. Garrett further reduced the remaining balance by $5,678,960 to\naccount for additional insurance proceeds received by ETI after Docket No. 37744. By Mr. Garrett's\ncalculations, this left a remaining balance of Overestimated Insurance Proceeds of $11,071,3 3 8. 10\nBoth Mr. Garrett and Cities witness Jacob Pous also recommended that this remaining balance not be\ncarried as a regulatory asset but, instead, be moved to the storm insurance reserve for recovery. 11 In\ntheir view, this would ensure that the remaining balance would be properly recovered.\n\n\n          In response to ETI's argument that the Hurricane Rita Regulatory Asset was not resolved in\nDocket No. 37744, Cities stress that Docket No. 37744 settled as a \"black box settlement.\" In\nCities' opinion, such a settlement should not be interpreted as changing the status quo unless\nexpressly stated in the settlement agreement or final order. Cities contend that the status quo in\nDocket No. 37744 was that ETI was authorized to recover its Over Estimated Insurance Proceeds,\nbecause recovery was authorized by PURA § 39 .459(c); recovery had been previously approved in\nDocket No. 32907; and no party objected to its recovery in Docket No. 37744. Therefore, Cities\nstate, the final order in Docket No. 37744 should be interpreted as authorizing ETI's requested\nrecovery of the Hurricane Rita Regulatory asset in the rates set in that docket. 12\n\n\n          Cities also disagree with ETI' s alternative argument that Mr. Garrett improperly calculated\nthe remaining balance of the asset by deducting an amount for insurance proceeds ETI received after\nDocket No. 37744 concluded. Cities state that Mr. Garrett's adjustment was correct because it began\n\n10\n     Cities Ex. 2 (Garrett Direct) at Exhibit MG2.3.\n11\n     Id.

In other words, Mr. Garret did not start with the balance claimed by ETI in the present\ncase, 13 so he correctly applied the amount, received after Docket No. 37744 to reduce the balance\n                              14\nclaimed in that docket.            According to Cities, Mr. Garrett began with the prior balance to properly\nreflect that no carrying charges would accrue on the balance after it was included in rate base and\nrecovered a return through rates. 15 Cities also dispute ETI' s argument that Mr. Garrett should not\nhave accounted for amortization occurring between the Test Year and the Rate Year as an \"invalid\n                                    16\npost-test year adjustment.''             In Cities' view, this was a valid known and measureable change that\nshould be taken into account. 17\n\n\n           Staff recommends that the Hurricane Rita Regulatory Asset be removed from rate base\nentirely. Staff witness Anna Givens stated that it is reasonable to assume that this asset was included\nas part of the settlement in Docket No. 37744. Accordingly, she stated that it is not appropriate for\nETI to request recovery of the same asset in the present docket.                    Therefore, Ms. Givens\nrecommended removal of the entire requested $26,229,627 Hurricane Rita regulatory asset from\nETI' s rate base. 18\n\n\n           Alternatively, Ms. Givens proposed that the Commission allow ETI a regulatory asset of\n$17,486,418, to be amortized over 40 months. Ms. Givens noted that higher rates from Docket\nNo. 37744 first went into effect on August 15, 2010; 19 therefore, at least one-third of the regulatory\nasset should have been amortized by the conclusion of the present case. Using ETI's updated\nhurricane regulatory asset request of $26,229 ,627, Ms. Givens recommended a decrease of one-third\nto ETI's request. This would equal an $8,743,209 reduction, resulting in her recommended\n\n\n13\n     Cities Initial Brief at 8.\n14\n     Cities Ex. 2B (Garrett Direct), Exhibit MG-2.3.\n15\n     Docket No. 32907, Final Order at FoF 28.\n16\n     ETI' s Initial Briefat 7.\n17\n     Cities' Reply Brief at 10-14.\n18\n     Staff Ex. l (Givens Direct) at 32-34.\n19\n     Docket No. 37744, Order, FoF 16 (Dec. 13, 2010).\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                               PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                   PAGE 19\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nregulatory asset of $17,486,418 ($26,229 ,627 - $8, 743,209). Ms. Givens also recommended that the\namortization period be decreased from 60 months to 40 months, which is the time remaining on\nETI's original Docket No. 37744 request. 20\n\n\n          ETI disagrees with Cities and Staff, and it argues that its total requested Hurricane Rita\nregulatory asset should be included in rate base in this case. First, it notes that no instruction in the\nStipulation and Settlement Agreement filed in Docket No. 37744 required ETI to begin amortizing\nthe asset or otherwise directed the treatment of the asset. Likewise, no Finding of Fact or Conclusion\nof Law in the agreed order entered in Docket No. 37744 authorized the proposed treatment of the\nasset. In contrast, ETI notes, the settlement in Docket No. 32907 does specifically address the\ntreatment of this asset, and it argues that its request to include the full Hurricane Rita regulatory asset\nin rate base in the present case is consistent with that settlement. In ETI's opinion, it has not\npreviously been authorized to establish the regulatory asset, it has not amortized it, and the full\namount should be included in rate base in this case. 21\n\n\n          Alternatively, if Cities' proposed amortization is accepted, ETI argues that Mr. Garrett's\ncalculations were wrong. First, ETI states, Mr. Garrett incorrectly assumed that the $26,229,627\nHurricane Rita regulatory asset requested in this case did not account for the $5,678,960 of insurance\nproceeds that ETI received after Docket No. 37744. According to ETI, the $5,678,960 was\naccounted for, as shown on WP/P AJ 15.3. Therefore, ETI states, Mr. Garrett's adjustment for this\n$5.6 million would remove this amount from the asset a second time. 22 Second, ETI argues that\nMr. Garrett erred by amortizing the asset by 22.5 months. Mr. Garrett calculated the amortization\nperiod from the time rates went into effect after Docket No. 37744 (August 15, 2010) through the\ntime revised rates would go into effect in this docket (June 30, 2012). ETI states that Mr. Garrett\n\n\n20\n   Staff Ex. 1 (Givens Direct) at 34. Ms. Givens noted that amount recommended in Docket No. 37744 was\n$25,278,000, which is $951,627 less than the amount requested in the current proceeding. However, she stated\nthat this does not affect her recommendation, because by the time the hearing on the merits concluded, at least\nanother two months of amortization expense under the existing rates would be collected by the ETI and should\nadequately compensate it for the difference. Staff Ex. 1 (Givens Direct) at 35.\n21\n     ETI Ex. 46 (Considine Rebuttal) at 19-24; ETI Initial Brief at 5-6.\n22\n     ETI Ex. 46 (Considine Rebuttal) at 21-22; ETI Initial Brief at 7.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE20\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nmade an invalid post-test year adjustment because post-test year adjustments for rate base items are\nlimited to plant additions recorded in FERC Accounts 101 or 102. In contrast, regulatory assets, like\nthe Hurricane Rita regulatory asset, are recorded in Account 182.3. Therefore, in ETI' s opinion, if it\nwas required to amortize this regulatory asset, it would be appropriate to amortize it for only\n10.5 months, to the end of the Test Year (August 15, 2010, through June 30, 2011). These two\ncorrections would adjust Mr. Garrett's proposed asset balance from $10,714,557 to $21,805,940. 23\n\n\n          ETI also disagrees with Mr. Pous' recommendation that the regulatory asset be removed from\nrate base and placed in the storm reserve, to be amortized over 20 years. In ETI's opinion, this\napproach would defeat the purpose of securitization, which is to provide ETI with cost recovery in an\nexpedited manner. 24\n\n\n          Finally, ETI argues that Ms. Givens' analysis was flawed. It reiterated that no provision in\nthe Stipulation and Settlement Agreement or the final order filed in Docket No. 37744 directed the\ntreatment of the regulatory asset or stated that ETI would begin amortizing the asset. Further, ETI\nstresses that it never sought recovery of the entire asset all at once in Docket No. 37744. Instead,\nETI requests recovery over a period of years through amortization. Thus, according to ETI, even if\nMs. Givens' argument were accepted, the entire asset should not be disallowed. 25\n\n\n          This issue is a close call because the black-box settlement agreement and final order in\nDocket No. 37744 did not expressly state how the Hurricane Rita regulatory asset issue was resolved.\nThe following factors support finding that the Hurricane Rita regulatory asset issue was resolved in\nDocket No. 37744:\n\n\n•     the settlement agreement and final order in Docket No. 32907 expressly provided that the\n      difference between the amount of ETI's estimated insurance proceeds and the amount actually\n      received by ETI would be trued up after ETI received the proceeds~\n\n\n\n23\n     ETI Ex. 46 (Considine Rebuttal) at 22; ETI Initial Brief at 7-8.\n24\n     ETI Initial Brief at 8.\n25\n     ETI Ex. 46 (Considine Rebuttal) at 21; Id. at 8-9.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE21\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n•   PURA § 39 .459(c) provides that if the timing of a utility's receipt of insurance proceeds\n    prevented their inclusion as a reduction to the securitized costs, the Commission \"shall take those\n    amounts into account ... in the utility's next base rate proceeding;\"\n\n•   Docket No. 37744 was ETI's next base rate proceeding;\n\n•   in Docket No. 37744, ETI requested a true-up concerning the insurance proceeds, and it\n    requested that a regulatory asset be established for the deficit and amortized over five years;\n\n•   in Docket No. 37744, no party objected to ETI's proposed regulatory asset or amortization;\n\n•   the stipulation and settlement agreement entered by the parties in Docket No. 37744 stated that\n    the parties resolved all issues, except for ETr s Competitive Generation Service (CGS) proposal;\n    and\n\n•   neither the stipulation and settlement agreement nor the Order entered in Docket No. 37744\n    specifically disapproved, excluded, or deferred consideration ETI' s proposed regulatory asset,\n    although they did specifically exclude or disapprove other items, such as ETI' s CGS proposal\n    and various proposed riders.\n\n\n\n        On the other hand, some factors support a finding that the Hurricane Rita regulatory asset\nissue was not resolved in Docket No. 37744. The stipulation and settlement agreement and the\nOrder entered in Docket No. 37744 did not expressly approve ETI's proposed regulatory asset,\nalthough certain other items were expressly approved, such as River Bend Nuclear Generating\nStation Unit No. 1 (River Bend) decommissioning costs, depreciation rates, and other items. Also,\nutilities are typically not allowed to create regulatory assets without express approval of the\nCommission.\n\n\n        Thus, the difficulty with this issue is the nature of the black-box settlement of Docket\nNo. 37744. In the settlement, the parties agreed to an increase in base rate revenues of $59 million\neffective August 15, 2010, with an additional increase in base rate revenues effective May 2, 2011.\nHowever, there was no explanation on how this increase was determined, and there was no specific\nagreement or finding on the amount of ETI' s rate base or its reasonable and necessary cost of service.\nIn that case, there was no objection to ETI' s proposed Hurricane Rita regulatory asset, it was\nauthorized by the prior settlement in Docket No. 32907, and the Commission was directed by PURA\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                 PAGE22\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n§ 39 .459(c) to take into account ETI' s insurance proceeds related to the Hurricane Rita securitized\ncosts in ETI's next rate case, which was Docket No. 37744. Moreover, when there is uncertainty\nwhether an undisputed issue was deferred for future consideration or was included within the rates\nset in a black-box settlement, the burden should be on the utility to establish that the issue was\ndeferred for future consideration. When all the evidence and factors are considered, the AUs find\nthat that ETI's proposed Hurricane Rita regulatory asset should be considered as having been\napproved in Docket No. 37744, and ETI should have amortized the asset since August 15, 2010, the\neffective date of rates approved in that docket.\n\n\n        The AUs also find that none of the amortization calculations proposed by the parties were\nentirely correct. ETI's proposal to start with its requested $26,229,627 was flawed because it\nincluded carrying costs from August 15, 2010, when the asset should have been included in rate base,\nto June 30, 2011, the end of the Test Year in the present case. During that period, the asset would\nhave earned a rate of return as part of rate base, and accrual of carrying costs should have ceased.\nTherefore, it would be more accurate to begin amortizing the Hurricane Rita regulatory asset by\nusing the balance requested by ETI in Docket No. 37744. That amount, according to Mr. Garrett,\nwas $25,278,210. However, the amortization calculation should not extend beyond the end of the\nTest Year in the present case (June 30, 2011), as proposed by Cities and Staff. P.U.C. SUBST.\nR. 25 .231 (c )(2)(F)( ii) provides for post-test-year reductions to rate base, and the recommendation for\na post-test-year adjustment to the Hurricane Rita regulatory asset does not fall within the scope of\nthat rule. The balance remaining after amortization to the end of the Test Year should be further\nreduced by $5,678,960 to account for additional insurance proceeds received by ETI after Docket\nNo. 37744 concluded but before the end of the Test Year in the present case. ETI argues that this\nreduction was already included in its request. However, as discussed above, the appropriate\ncalculation should begin with the balance of the asset at the conclusion of Docket No. 37744, not the\nbalance requested by ETI in the present case. The balance of the asset at the conclusion of Docket\nNo. 37744 did not account for the additional insurance proceeds paid to ETI afterwards, so it should\nbe deducted now. In summary, the AUs find that the appropriate amount of the Hurricane Rita\nregulatory asset to be included in rate base in this case should be calculated as follows:\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE23\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nBeginning balance at conclusion of Docket No. 37744 (original balance+ carrying charges)   $25,278,210\n\nLess amortization for period 8/15/10 to 6/30/11 = 10.5months160 months= 17.5%              - $4,423,687\n\nLess additional insurance proceeds received                                                - $5,678,960\n\nRemaining balance of Hurricane Rita regulatory asset                                       $15,175,563\n\n\n          Finally, the AU s recommend that the Commission not adopt the recommendation of Cities to\nmove the Hurricane Rita regulatory asset to the storm insurance reserve for recovery. As noted by\nETI, one purpose of enactment of PURA Chapter 39 was to allow expedited recovery of costs\nresulting from Hurricane Rita storm damage. Moving the regulatory asset to the storm insurance\nreserve would defeat that purpose and negate the five-year amortization plan the parties agreed to in\nDocket No. 37744.\n\n\n          In summary, the AU s find that ETI' s proposed Hurricane Rita regulatory asset was an issue\nresolved by the black-box settlement in Docket No. 37744. Therefore, ETI should have included the\nasset in rate base at the conclusion of that docket and should have begun amortizing it over a period\nof five years. The accrual of carrying charges should have ceased when Docket No. 37744\nconcluded, because the asset would have then begun earning a rate of return as part of rate base. The\nappropriate calculation of the asset should begin with the amount claimed by ETI in Docket\nNo. 37744, less amortization accruals to the end of the Test Year in the present case, and less the\namount of additional insurance proceeds received by ETI after the conclusion of Docket No. 37744.\nThis produces a remaining balance of $15,175,563, which should remain in rate base as a regulatory\nasset, applying a five-year amortization rate that commenced August 15, 2010. Further, the\nHurricane Rita regulatory asset should not be moved to the storm insurance reserve.\n\n\nC.        Prepaid Pension Asset Balance\n\n          ETI included in rate base an item titled Unfunded Pension in the amount of $55,973,545. 26\nThe amount requested in this account represents the accumulated difference between the Statement\nof Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 87 calculated pension costs each year and the actual\n\n26\n     ETI Ex. 3, Sched.

Thus, he argues, if the\nasset were included in rate base, ratepayers would pay a substantial premium for the slight pension\ncost savings ETI' s excess contributions may have achieved. 29\n\n\n          Cities argue that the entire prepaid pension asset should be removed from rate base because\nETI has not justified its inclusion. This would reduce pro forrna rate base by $36,382,803, which is\nthe net amount of the prepaid balance less accumulated deferred income tax ($55,973,545 -\n$19,590,740 = $36,382,803). At the same time, Cities would increase operating expense by\n$498,284, to provide a 1.37 percent return on the net balance of ETI' s prepaid pension asset\nbalance. 30\n\n\n          Alternatively, Cities contend that the Commission should treat the pension assets in the same\nmanner as the approach adopted by the Commission in Docket No. 33309. 31 In that docket, the\nCommission allowed a pension prepayment asset, less accrued deferred federal income taxes\n(ADFIT) and less the portion of the asset that is capitalized to CWIP, to be included in rate base. As\nto the excluded portion, the Commission allowed the accrual of an allowance for funds used during\nconstruction (AFUDC). Thus, Cities contend, if the Commission opts for this approach, it should\nallow ETI's pension prepayment asset, less ADFIT, to be included in rate base, but excluding\n\n\n\n27\n     Cities Ex. 2 (Garrett Direct) at 7.\n28\n     ETI Initial Brief at 10; Cities Ex. 2 (Garrett Direct) at 8.\n29\n     Cities Ex. 2 (Garrett Direct) at 8-9.\n30\n     Id. at 10, MG-2.2; Cities Initial Brief at 10.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                             PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                        PAGE2S\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n$25,311,236 for the portion of the prepaid pension balance associated with CWIP, and allow\nAFUDC to accrue on the excluded balance. 32\n\n\n           ETI responds first by disputing Mr. Garrett's contention that it has unreasonably overpaid\ninto its pension fund. It contends it has made contributions to the pension fund in accordance with\ncontribution guidelines established by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and\nthe Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and that the contributions were within the allowable range of\ncontributions deductible for tax purposes. ETI also was guided in its required pension contributions\nby the Pension Protection Act of 2006 rules, effective beginning with the 2008 plan year. 33\n\n\n           ETI next disputes Cities' contention that the earnings associated with ETI's pension\ncontributions provide insufficient benefits to justify inclusion of the asset in rate base. ETI points\nout that ratepayer benefits are not just limited to the level provided by the actual pension fund\nearnings on investment. Rather, under FAS 87, pension costs included in the cost of service for\nratemaking purposes are intended to include the expected rate of return on assets. Thus, ETI argues\nthat the expected long-term rate of return on ETI' s assets is 8.5 percent, not the actual earnings as\nsuggested by Mr. Garrett. 34\n\n\n           On behalf of ETI, Mr. Considine testified that the pension balance is no different than any\nother prepayments made by the Company, which are included in rate base and earn a full return on\nrate base. Furthermore, the Company would be allowed to earn a full return on rate base had the\nCompany invested these same dollars in Plant in Service, but the Company in this case used funds to\ncontribute to a still under-funded pension plan and at the same time provided a timely reduction to\nformerly FAS 87 annual pension cost, thereby immediateIy benefitting ratepayers. 35 Therefore, ETI\n\n\n31\n  Remand ofDocket No. 33309 (Application ofAEP Texas Central Company for Authority to Change Rates),\nDocket No. 38772, Order on Remand at FoF ISA (Jan. 30, 2011).\n32\n     Cities Initial Brief at 8-9; Cities Ex. 2 (Garret Direct) at 12.\n33\n     ETI Ex. 46 (Considine Rebuttal) at 22.\n34   Id.\n35\n     Id. at 23-24.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE26\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nargues it is clearly investor-supplied capital and accordingly should earn the Company's requested\nreturn on rate base.\n\n\n          ETI acknowledged the approach to this issue taken by the Commission in Docket No. 33309,\nbut failed to explain why it is distinguishable from the present case. 36\n\n\n          The AUs conclude that the approach taken by the Commission in Docket No. 33309 was\nsound and should be applied in the present case. Neither party adequately explained why the\ncircumstances of the present case are distinguishable.        Thus, the AUs recommend that the\nCWIP-related portion of ETI' s pension asset ($25 ,311,236 out of the total asset) should be excluded\nfrom the asset, but accrue allowance for funds used during construction.\n\n\nD.        FIN 48 Tax Adjustment\n\n          The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is the body that establishes the rules that\nconstitute generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). FASB' s Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48)\nprescribes the way in which a company must analyze, quantify, and disclose the potential\nconsequences of tax positions that the company has taken which are legally ''uncertain.\" Pursuant to\nFIN 48, ETI and its independent auditors are required to evaluate each of its uncertain tax positions\nto determine, under the most objective, reasonable standards, which portion of each position will\nmost likely ultimately have to be paid to taxing authorities if challenged by the authorities. FIN 48\nrequires that this portion be excluded from ADFIT for financial reporting purposes and accrue\ninterest and, in some cases, penalties. 37\n\n\n          ETI and its auditors periodically perform the FIN 48 analysis. In so doing, they have\nconcluded that the Company has taken a number of uncertain tax positions that the Company expects\nto lose if challenged by the IRS. ETI concluded that these uncertain tax positions result in a total of\n$5,916,461 in tax dollars that the Company expects it will ultimately have to pay, with interest, to the\n\n\n36\n     ETI Initial Brief at 10-11.\n37\n     ETI Ex. 70 (Warren Rebuttal) at 9-12.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                  PAGE27\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nIRS. As required by FIN 48, this amount is recorded on ETI's balance sheet as a tax liability. 38 In\nother words, ETI has, thus far, avoided paying to the IRS $5,916,461 in tax dollars (ETI's FIN 48\nLiability) in reliance upon tax positions that the Company believes will not prevail in the event the\npositions are challenged, via an audit, by the IRS.\n\n\n           In preparing its application in this proceeding, ETI made an accounting adjustment to its Test\nYear numbers by not including the $5,916,461 in its ADFIT balance. This had the effect of reducing\nthe Company's Test Year deferred tax balance and, therefore, increasing its rate base. 39\n\n\n           Cities witness Mark Garrrett asserted that the deduction of$5,916,461-representing ETI's\nFIN 48 Liability - should be added to ETI' s AD FIT balance and thus be used to reduce the\nCompany's rate base. Mr. Garrett pointed out that the Commission first considered this issue in a\nrecent Oncor docket. 40 In that docket, the Commission decided to include FIN 48 liabilities in\nADFIT because of the low likelihood that the IRS would actually audit and review the issue. 41\nMr. Garrett testified that this is a fair result because: (1) a utility with FIN 48 liabilities might never\nhave its underlying uncertain tax positions audited by the IRS; and (2) even if the uncertain positions\nare audited by the IRS, the utility might prevail on them. In either case, the utility would never have\nto pay those tax amounts. Moreover, during the time when the uncertainty exists, the utility enjoys\nthe use of cost-free capital (from the deferred taxes associated with the deductions) at its disposal. 42\nThus, Mr. Garrett recommends that ETI' s AD FIT balance be increased by $5,916,461 to reinstate the\nFIN 48 Liability removed by the Company.43\n\n\n\n\n38\n     ETI Ex. 64 (Roberts Rebuttal) at 4-7.\n39\n     Id. at 4.\n40\n  Cities Ex. 2 (Garrett Direct) at 5-7.

Mr. Roberts explained that, because the Company\nexpects to lose on its uncertain tax positions, it expects that it will ultimately have to pay $5,916,461\nin taxes to the IRS, plus interest. Accordingly, Mr. Garrett testified that the amount does not\nrepresent cost-free funds available to the Company and, as such, should not be included in the\nCompany's ADFIT balance. 44\n\n\n          Both the Cities and ETI agree that ETI' s rate base \"should reflect the actual amount of cost\nfree capital in the ADFIT accounts at Test Year end.\"45 However, ETI witness Mr. Warren testified\nthat the FIN 48 Liability is not cost-free capital to the Company because the best available expert\nopinion in the record of this case is that ETI will \"most likely\" ultimately have to pay the money to\n                          46\nthe IRS, with interest.\n\n\n          Moreover, Mr. Warren pointed out that, beginning with 2010 tax returns, a corporate\ntaxpayer is required to complete and file a Schedule UTP, on which the taxpayer must specifically\nidentify and describe its FIN 48 positions. Mr. Warren contended that, because ETI must now\nannually file a Schedule UTP, it is more likely that the IRS will audit the Company, thereby forcing\nit to pay the FIN 48 Liabilities, with interest. 47 This constitutes additional support for the notion that\nthe FIN 48 Liability is not cost-free capital for the Company. Mr.Warren correctly points out that, in\na recent CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC, (CenterPoint) rate case, the Commission\nspecifically acknowledged that filing of a Schedule UTP makes it more likely that a company will be\naudited. In that case, the ALJs recommended that CenterPoint's FIN 48 Liability, totaling some\n$164 million, be added to CenterPoint's ADFIT, thereby reducing its rate base. The Commission\nadopted the recommendation. However, in light of its conclusion that the filing of a Schedule UTP\nincreases the likelihood of an audit, the Commission authorized CenterPoint to establish a deferred\ntax account rider to enable it to recover any portion of its FIN 48 Liability that it might ultimately be\n\n44\n     ETI Ex. 64 (Roberts Rebuttal) at 7.\n45\n     Cities Ex. 2 (Garrett Direct) at 6; see also ETI Ex. 70 (Warren Rebuttal) at 6-7.\n46\n     ETI Ex. 70 (Warren Rebuttal) at 17.\n47\n     Id. at 14, 20-21.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                             PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                  PAGE29\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nforced to pay to the IRS, plus interest. 48 ETI does not necessarily oppose the use of a rider in this\ncase, but contends that it would be preferable to simply exclude ETI' s FIN 48 Liability from its\nADFIT balance, thereby increasing its rate base. 49\n\n\n          In the alternative that the Commission rejects ETI' s request to exclude the full amount of the\nFIN 48 Liability from the Company's AD FIT balance, ETI contends that at least any amount of cash\ndeposit the Company has made with the IRS that is attributable to the FIN 48 Liability should be\nremoved from the Company's ADFIT balance.so The Cities' witness, Mr. Garrett, agrees.st Staff\nalso agrees, arguing that ETI should be required to increase its ADFIT balance by the amount of its\nFIN 48 Liability less the amount of any cash deposit attributable to the liability that ETI has made\nwith the IRS.s2 ETihas made a cash deposit with the IRS in the amount of$1,294,683. This amount\nis associated with the Company's FIN 48 Liability.s3\n\n\n          Consistent with prior Commission precedent from the Oncor and CenterPoint proceedings,\nthe AUs conclude that ETI' s FIN 48 Liability should be included in the Company's ADFIT balance.\nThere is, however, one caveat to this conclusion. The amount of the cash deposit made by ETI to the\nIRS which is attributable to the Company's FIN 48 Liability should not be included in the ADFIT\nbalance. Therefore, the ALls recommend that the Commission find that $4,621,778 (representing\nETI's full FIN 48 Liability of $5,916,461 less the $1,294,683 cash deposit ETI has made with the\nIRS) should be added to ETI' s ADFIT and thus be used to reduce ETI' s rate base.

Cash Working Capital\n\n          Rate base includes a reasonable allowance for cash working capital. Cash working capital\nrepresents the average amount of investor capital used to bridge the gap in time between when\nexpenditures are made by ETI to provide services and when the corresponding revenues are received\nby ETI. 55 Generally, an increase in revenue lag days and/or a decrease in expense lead days will\nresult in an increase to the amount of cash working capital included in the rate base. Conversely, a\ndecrease in revenue lag days and/or an increase in expense lead days will reduce the cash working\ncapital included in rate base. A properly prepared lead-lag study can result in either a positive cash\nworking capital amount (and therefore an increase to the rate base) or a negative cash working capital\namount (and a corresponding decrease to the rate base).\n\n\n          Pursuant to P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.231(c)(2)(B)(iii)(IV), ETicalculated its cash working capital\nallowance by performing a lead-lag study. ETI witness Jay Joyce prepared the lead-lag study for the\nCompany. Based upon the study, ETI requests a cash working capital addition to its rate base of\nnegative $2,013,921. 56\n\n\n          Only Staff and Cities submitted evidence and argument relevant to the cash working capital\nrequirement.       Staff does not challenge the accuracy of the lead and lag days determined in\nMr. Joyce's study. Instead, Staff witness Anna Givens recommends that the cash working capital\ncalculation be updated to reflect the impacts of Staffs recommended adjustments to ETI's O&M\ncosts and taxes. 57 ETI agrees that the final cash working capital amount should be updated to reflect\nthe actual revenue requirements approved by the Commission in this case. 58\n\n\n\n\ncase than there was in the CenterPoint case, where CenterPoint had $164 million in FIN 48 liabilities.

Mr. Pous asserts\nthat the correct cash working capital amount for inclusion in ETI' s rate base is negative $24,000,000\n(more than an order of magnitude increase of the negative amount). 59 Each of the major components\nof the lead-lag study, and Cities' criticisms of same, will be discussed in tum.\n\n\n           1. The Revenue Lag Component of the Lead-Lag Study\n\n           Mr. Pous raises a number of criticisms about the revenue lag component of Mr. Joyce's lead\nlag study. There are four parts to the revenue lag component: (1) the \"service period lag,\" which\nconsists of the roughly 15 days from the mid-point of the month in which service is provided to the\nend of that month; (2) the \"billing lag,\" which represents the time between the date a customer's\nmeter is read and the date a bill is issued to the customer; (3) the \"collection lag,\" which represents\nthe time between the issuance of the bill and the date the customer's payment is received; and\n(4) \"receipt of funds lag,\" which measures the delay between ETI's receipt of payment and the\nbank's clearance of the payment. 60 When the four parts were combined together, Mr. Joyce\nidentified ETI's revenue lag as 43.86 days. 61\n\n\n                       (a) Billing Lag\n\n           Mr. Joyce identified the billing lags (i.e., the delay between when meters are read and bills\nare sent to customers) as ranging from 5.4 to 5.65 days, depending upon the customer class. 62 On\nbehalf of the Cities, Mr. Pous asserted that this duration is too long. Mr. Pous complained that the\nbilling lag in ETI's lead-lag study is longer than in studies from previous ratemaking proceedings\ninvolving ETI' s predecessor, despite the fact that, in the interim between studies, ETI has invested\nsubstantially in electronic meter reading devices and computer systems that ought to shorten the lag\ntime. According to Mr. Pous, in a previous proceeding, ETI' s predecessor identified its billing lag as\n\n59\n     Cities Ex. 5 (Pous Direct) at 72.\n60\n     ETI Ex. 17 (Joyce Direct) at 8-10.\n61\n     Id. at JJJ-3.\n62\n     Cities Ex. 5 (Pous Direct) at 74.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                             PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE32\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nonly 3 .61 days. 63 Mr. Pous also pointed out that the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC), recently\nadopted a 1-day billing lag for a large gas utility, Atmos Mid-Tex, due to the utility's use of modem\nelectronic meter reading devices (the Atmos Mid-Tex RRC proceeding). Mr. Pous stated that the\nbilling lag identified by ETI would oojustly reward the Company for being inefficient in sending out\nits bills because customers should not be pooished if the utility decides to manage its billing\nprocessing and payment system less efficiently. Thus, Mr. Pous recommended a schedule of\ndifferent billing lags for different customer classes. For residential and commercial customers,\nMr. Pous recommended a 1.46 day billing lag, based since ETI' s predecessor claimed such a lag in a\nprior PUC docket (Docket No. 12852). For large industrial, public authority, and street lighting\ncustomers, Mr. Pous recommends a billing lag of 3.72 days. He calculated that the combined impact\nof these adjustments would result in a 41.10-day total revenue lag (as compared to Mr. Joyce's figure\nof 43.86 days). Mr. Pous then calculates that this shorter lag period results in an additional negative\ncash working capital of $11.4 million. 64\n\n\n           ETI responds by pointing out that the 1.46-day billing lag suggested by Mr. Pous for\nresidential and commercial customers was derived from a rate case by ETI' s predecessor from 1993,\nwhereas Mr. Joyce more properly relied on actual Test Year data. Mr. Joyce asserted that Mr. Pous,\nin effect, \"cherry picked\" the 1.46-day figure from one page of a 4 7-page study associated with the\n1993 rate case, and that the remaining pages of the study have not been located and, therefore, cannot\nbe evaluated. Thus, Mr. Joyce testified, \"[i]t is unfair and unreasonable to use such an old document\nto attempt to support a position when reasonable, contemporaneous evidence exists.\"65\n\n\n           ETI argues that it is more appropriate in this case to rely upon ETI's actual residential and\ncommercial billing practices, rather than to substitute artificial and arbitrary 1.46-day and 3.72-day\nperiods derived from other sources. According to Mr. Joyce, it is unavoidably necessary, when\nconducting a lead-lag study, to take into account the actual amount of time employed by ETI in\nperforming all of the activities in its billing-cycle-based meter reading and billing processes.\n\n63   Id.\n64\n     Id. at 75-77.\n65\n     ETI Ex. 54 (Joyce Rebuttal) at 11.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                               PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE33\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nMr. Joyce complains that Mr. Pous' approach would jettison this actual data and analysis derived\nfrom the Test Year and improperly substitute arbitrary numbers based upon a prior, dated, rate\nproceeding. 66\n\n\n           Mr. Joyce acknowledged that the RRC recently adopted a 1-day billing lag in the Atmos\nMid-Tex RRC proceeding. He pointed out, however, that the RRC did so simply because Atmos\nMid-Tex failed to present evidence supporting a longer billing lag. Additionally, Mr. Joyce pointed\nout that the RRC promptly reversed itself in Atmos Mid-Tex's next rate case, adopting a longer\nbilling lag after the company provided sufficient evidence to support the longer period. 67\n\n\n           ETI also provided extensive evidence regarding the details of its meter reading and billing\nprocess. 68 ETI witness Dolores Stokes explained that the meter reading and billing cycle includes\ntime for extensive quality assurance activities to ensure accurate billing, thereby preventing\nunnecessary frustration for the customer and additional costs to the Company that would be required\nfor customer service, rebilling, and account corrections. 69\n\n\n           Cities questioned Mr. Joyce at the hearing about the billing lag period in this case compared\nto ETI' s last rate case. Mr. Joyce explained that the total period from meter reading to collection of\nbilling revenues had not changed appreciably between the two cases, but due to a difference in lead-\nlag methodology, the date that divides the two components of that lag - metering to billing and\nbilling to collection       had changed. 70 As a result, the first period - billing lag- was longer than in\nthe previous case but the second period - collection lag - was shorter.71 ETI introduced into\nevidence a response to a Cities RFI that discussed this difference in more detail. 72 After explaining\n\n\n66\n     Id. at 5-7.\n67\n     Id.at 8-9.\n68\n     ETI Ex. 54 (Joyce Rebuttal); ETI Ex. 66 (Stokes Rebuttal).\n69\n     ETI Ex. 66 (Stokes Rebuttal) at 18.\n70\n     Tr. at 499-500, 502.\n71\n     Tr. at 499-502.\n72\n     ETI Ex. 73.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE34\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nthe change in lead-lag methodology, the RFI response concluded that \"the combined billing and\ncollection lags are substantially similar from the prior case to this current case.\"73\n\n\n          The AU s conclude that ETI has met its burden to show that the billing lag it utilized in the\nlead-lag study is reasonable and appropriate.       Absent his own opinion, Mr. Pous does not offer\nmeaningful evidence to support his assertion that the Company's billing lag is too long or that the\nCompany's billing practices are inefficient. For example, he offered no criticism of any specific\nbilling practice of the Company. The only support for his charge of inefficiency is that the billing lag\nin a previous ETI rate case was shorter. Mr. Joyce convincingly explained that this was merely an\nartifact of changes in the methodology of the lead-lag study-the billing lag became longer, but the\ncollection lag became shorter.\n\n\n          Mr. Pous' reliance upon an example from the RRC is unconvincing. Similarly, his reliance\nupon data from a previous rate case is unpersuasive, especially because only a very limited snippet of\ndata from that case is available, the case occurred roughly 20 years ago, and it involved a different\ncompany. It is not possible, from the evidence in the record, to know how different or similar ETI' s\ncurrent billing practices are to those used in the previous case.\n\n\n          In this case, ETI has thoroughly explained its metering and billing processes and established\nthat those processes are reasonable. The Company is therefore entitled to establish rates based on the\nactual cash working capital necessary to facilitate those policies. The AI.Js recommend rejecting\nCities' request to shorten the billing lag time identified in ETI's lead-lag study\n\n\n                        (b) Collection Lag\n\n          In his lead-lag study, Mr. Joyce identified various collection lags (i.e., the delay between the\nissuance of an electric bill and the date the customer's payment is received) for different classes of\ncustomers. As to third-party customers, the collection lag was determined using a random sample of\ninvoices from residential, commercial, industrial, public authority, and street light customer billings\n\n\n73\n     ETI Ex. 73 at 2.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                               PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE35\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nduring the Test Year, measuring the time between when the bills were mailed and the payment\nreceipt date. The collection lag for MSS-4 and Intra-System Bill (ISB) revenues was based on the\n                                                                74\nactual payment dates for each of the affiliate revenue types.\n\n\n               >     Collection Lag for Residential Customers\n\n          As to the residential class, Mr. Joyce determined that the collection lag was 23.73 days. On\nbehalf of the Cities, Mr. Pous disputed the accuracy of that estimate, complaining that it is\nsubstantially longer than the lag identified for commercial customers. Mr. Pous contended that\nMr. Joyce determined the collection lag for residential customers by relying on a sample size that\nwas too small. Mr. Pous examined the month-end accounts receivable data for ETI's entire\nresidential class for the entire Test Year, and concluded that the collection lag for the class is actually\n22.07 days (as compared to Mr. Joyce's figure of 23.73 days). Mr. Pous then calculated that this\n                                                                                               75\nshorter lag period results in an additional negative cash working capital of $2.4 million.\n\n\n          Mr. Joyce made several points in response. First, he noted that, although Mr. Pous is\nadvocating reliance upon month-end accounts receivable data to calculate the collection lag in this\ncase, he has testified in another proceeding that such data is unusable and unreliable. For example,\nin the Atmos Mid-Tex RRC proceeding, Mr. Pous argued in favor of measuring actual bill payment\npractices of actual customers (i.e., the approach taken by Mr. Joyce in the present case) and against\nanalyzing the monthly accounts receivable balances for each month of the Test Year (i.e., the\napproach now being advocated for by Mr. Pous). 76 Next, Mr. Joyce disputed Mr. Pous' assertion that\nthe sample size used by Mr. Joyce was too limited. According to Mr. Joyce, his sample of 100\nresidential customers is comparable to all of the residential collection lag calculations he has\nperformed during his 15 years of performing lead-lag studies. 77 Mr. Joyce also accused Mr. Pous of\n\n\n\n\n74\n     ETI Ex. 17 (Joyce Direct) at 10.\n75\n     Cities Ex. 5 (Pous Direct) at 77-79.\n76\n     ETI Ex. 54 (Joyce Rebuttal) at 13-15.\n77\n     Id. at 15-17.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE36\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ninexplicably picking out a few data points, rather than relying upon the entirety of the sampling data,\nin order to derive his collection lag estimate.78\n\n\n           The AU s are unpersuaded by Mr. Pous' criticisms and conclude that ETI has met its burden\nto show that the collection lag it utilized in the lead-lag study for residential customers is reasonable\nand appropriate.\n\n\n                  };>   Collection Uig for MSS-4 and ISB Affiliate Rate Classes\n\n           As to MSS-4 and ISB rate classes, Mr. Joyce determined that the collection lags were 46.19\nand 15.61 days, respectively. 79 Mr. Pous again disputed the accuracy of these estimates. Mr. Pous\npointed out that the underlying data reveals that the majority of the MSS-4 revenue lag days range\nfrom 43 to 46 days, with only two values equaling or exceeding 50 days. Mr. Pous testified that the\ntwo values equaling or exceeding 50 days should be deemed unrepresentative and, therefore,\nexcluded from the calculations for determining the average lag. Similarly, the majority of ISB\nrevenue lag days range from 15 to 16 days, with only a few lags running as long as 22 days. Again,\nMr. Pous contended that the longer revenue lag days should be deemed unrepresentative and\nexcluded from the calculations for the average. Mr. Pous also complained that the payment\ndeadlines for these affiliate transactions are stipulated in the Entergy System Agreement. Thus, it is\nMr. Pous' opinion that ETI unreasonably contractually agreed to \"excessively long\" revenue lag days\nassociated with the MSS-4 and ISB rate classes. Mr. Pous concluded that if what he considers to be\nthe unrepresentative lag days are excluded from the calculations, then the collection lag would\nchange for the MSS-4 class from 46.19 days to 45.14 days, and for the ISB class from 15.61 days to\n14.77 days. Collectively, the lag for the two classes would be .77 days shorter, resulting in an\nadditional negative cash working capital of $3. 2 million. 80\n\n\n\n\n78\n     Id. at 17.\n79\n     Id. at 18.\n° Cities Ex. 5 (Pous Direct) at 79-81; ETI Ex. 54 (Joyce Rebuttal) at 18.\n8\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                              PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                    PAGE37\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          Mr. Joyce first responded by disputing Mr. Pous' contention that there are unusual outliers in\nthe MSS-4 and ISB payment data. He noted that the lag days for MSS-4 payments ranged from 43 to\n54 days. He described this as a \"relatively tight payment range and certainly within the expected\nrange of reasonableness.\" 81 Next, Mr. Joyce described Mr. Pous' assertion that outlier numbers\nshould not be considered in the data as nonsensical. Mr. Joyce agreed that, in cases where sampling\nis used (such as was done for the residential customer class), it is appropriate to exclude data points\nthat are unrepresentative of the population as a whole. In the case of the MSS-4 and ISB classes,\nhowever, Mr. Joyce determined the collection lag by reviewing the entire class populations.\nAccording to Mr. Joyce, it is inappropriate to eliminate data points when reviewing an entire\npopulation, unless it is necessary to make a known and measurable change. 82\n\n\n          The AUs are again unpersuaded by Mr. Pous' criticisms. The AUs conclude that ETI has\nmet its burden as to show that the collection lag it utilized in the lead-lag study is reasonable and\nappropriate.\n\n\n                      (c) Receipt of Funds Lag\n\n          In the lead-lag study, Mr. Joyce identified the receipt of funds lag (i.e., the delay between the\ndate the funds are received from the customers and the date the funds clear the bank and are available\ntoETI). As required byP.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.23l(c)(2)(B)(iii)(IV)(-d-), Mr.Joyce assumed that one\nbusiness day is needed to clear any payments by methods other than electronic transfer, while\nelectronic payments are available to ETI on the date received. Because 53.39 percent of customer\npayments were made by methods other than electronic transfer, Mr. Joyce calculated the receipt of\nfunds lag to be .77 days. 83\n\n\n          Mr. Pous again contended that this duration is too long.          He acknowledges that P.U.C.\nSUBST. R. 25.231(c)(2)(B)(iii)(N)(-d-) mandates the assumption that funds paid by check will be\n\n81\n     ETI Ex. 54 (Joyce Rebuttal) at 19.\n82\n     /d.atl9.\n83\n   ETI Ex. 17 (Joyce Direct) at l 0. The receipt of funds lag is also sometimes referred to by the witnesses as\nthe \"cash receipts float.\"\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE38\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\navailable \"no later than\" the following business day. However, he stated that this is merely the\nmaximum possible duration, and ETI should take into account that fact that many checks are cleared\n(and therefore the funds are available) sooner than one day later. Therefore, the funds from all\nchecks received on any day other than Saturday should be assumed to be available on the date of\nreceipt, while the funds from checks received on Saturday should be assumed to be available two\ndays later. Mr. Pous was also critical of the fact that Mr. Joyce treated the funds from all \"walk-in\"\npayments made by customers to be available the next day. Funds from walk-in payments ought to be\ndeemed available on the date they are received. If these two changes are adopted, Mr. Pous\ncontended that receipt of funds lag would be shortened from .77 days to .15 days, resulting in an\nadditional negative cash working capital of $2.1 million. 84\n\n\n          Mr. Joyce first responded by pointing out that Mr. Pous' contention that all funds are\nimmediately available except for checks received on Saturdays is simply not accurate. Mr. Joyce\ncited from a 2007 Report to Congress made by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem which supports the conclusion that most funds paid by check in this country are not available\non the day they are received (and a significant portion are still not available the next business day). 85\nMr. Joyce also disagreed with Mr. Pons' contention that all walk-in payments should be considered\nimmediately available. According to Mr. Joyce, walk-in payments are made at third-party vendor\nlocations, such as grocery stores and check-cashing stores. Based upon his own investigation,\nMr. Joyce determined that walk-in payments are actually available to ETI two days after receipt.\nThus, his one-day assumption for walk-in payments is conservative. 86\n\n\n          The AU s conclude that ETI has met its burden as to show that the receipt of funds lag it\nutilized in the lead-lag study is reasonable and appropriate. The positions taken by Mr. Pons on this\nissue      were    unreasonable      and     counter    to    the    requirements   of   P.U.C.

The Expense Lead Component of the Lead-Lag Study\n\n          For the expense lead portion of his lead-lag study, Mr. Joyce calculated different expense\nlead days for numerous different categories of expenses. Each category will be discussed in tum.\n\n\n                       (a) Expense Lead - Operations and Maintenance Expense\n\n          Mr. Joyce separated O&M expenses into two groups - energy costs and \"other O&M\"\nexpenses. Each of those two groups was further divided into subgroups. 87\n\n\n               ~   Energy Costs\n\n          Fuel. Mr. Joyce explains that, during the Test Year, ETI purchased two kinds of fuel: (1)\ncoal and oil; and (2) natural gas. He concluded that there were 44.27 expense lead days for coal and\noil, based upon the time between the service periods and payment dates or payment due dates for all\ncoal and oil invoices from the Test Year. As to natural gas, he determined that there were 40.63\nexpense lead days, based upon a comparison of the service period and payment due dates and the\npayment dates from a random sample of gas invoices. 88 No party challenged this approach, and the\nAI..Js find no reason to do so either.\n\n\n          Purchased Power. Mr. Joyce explained that there were two components to ETI's purchased\npower energy costs in the Test Year: (1) MSS-4 Purchases; and (2) Other Purchased Power\n(consisting of Joint Account Purchases, MSS-3 Purchases, Reserve Equalization, Cogeneration\nPurchases, Renewable Energy Credits, and Toledo Bend Purchases). Relying upon either the entire\npopulation or a sample from the Test Year (depending upon the category), Mr. Joyce concluded that\nthere were 58.76 expense lead days for MSS-4, and 35.79 expense lead days for Other Purchased\nPower. 89\n\n\n\n\n87\n     ETI Ex. 17 (Joyce Direct) at 11.\n88\n     Id. at 11 and JJJ-3.\n89\n     ETI Ex. 17 (Joyce Direct) at 12 and JJJ-3.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                               PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                          PAGE40\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n           No party challenged the 35.79 day estimate for Other Purchased Power. However, on behalf\nof the Cities, Mr. Pous testified that the expense lead days for MSS-4 should be lengthened from\n58.76 days to 60.65 days. According to Mr. Pous, Mr. Joyce made several errors in calculating the\nexpense lead days for MSS-4 expenses. First, Mr. Joyce inadvertently placed the service period\nmonth after the billing month for two MSS-4 invoices. Mr. Pous based this conclusion on the fact\nthat the expense leads for these two invoices are roughly 30 days shorter than the \"vast majority\" of\nthe other invoices. 90 In response, Mr. Joyce denied that he erroneously placed the service period\nmonth after the billing month, and pointed out that Mr. Pous lacks any evidence to support his\nassertion. Instead, Mr. Joyce considered the entire population of MSS-4 invoices for the Test Year.\nThose invoices show payment lead days ranging from 30 to 120 days, with most points being near\n30, 60, or 70 payment lead days. According to Mr. Joyce, this is reasonable and well within the\nrange he has experienced in other rate cases. 91\n\n\n           Mr. Pous testified that Mr. Joyce erred in calculating the expense lead days for MSS-4\nexpenses by considering only the payment due dates specified in the Entergy System Agreement,\nrather than also considering the actual payment dates. According to Mr. Pous, in four instances\nduring the Test Year, extensions were granted to ETI to allow it to make MSS-4 payments afterthe\ndeadline specified in the Entergy System Agreement. Therefore, Mr. Pous stated that the expense\nlead days for MSS-4 payments should have been calculated using the later of the actual payment date\nor the allowable payment period.92 Mr. Joyce largely agreed with Mr. Pous on this point. That is, he\nagreed that the payment lead days should be based on the later of the paid date or the due date.\nHowever, he disagreed with some of Mr. Pous' calculations on this issue because Mr. Pous wrongly\ndesignated several due dates of Saturday or Sunday, when he should have selected Fridays as the due\ndate. 93\n\n\n\n\n90\n     Cities Ex. 5 (Pous Direct) at 83-84.\n91\n     ETI Ex. 54 (Joyce Rebuttal) at 26-28.\n92\n     Cities Ex. 5 (Pous Direct) at 84.\n93\n     ETI Ex. 54 (Joyce Rebuttal) at 28-29.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                         PAGE41\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          Next, Mr. Pous testified that Mr. Joyce erred in calculating the expense lead days for MSS-4\nexpenses by erroneously concluding that one invoice had been paid on the first of the month when, in\nfact, it had been paid on the 18th of the month. 94 Mr. Joyce agreed with the change. 95 Mr. Joyce\nthen recalculated the expense lead days for MSS-4 and revised the number of lead days from 58.76\nto 59.81. 96\n\n\n          The AU s conclude that ETI has met its burden as to show that there were 59.81 expense lead\ndays for MSS-4, and 35.79 expense lead days for Other Purchased Power.\n\n\n               »   Other O&M Expenses\n\n          This category of expenses was broken down in the lead-lag study into four groups regular\npayroll costs, incentive payroll costs, affiliate service company costs, and all other O&M costs (such\nas materials, services, and so on).\n\n\n          Regular Payroll Costs.          The lead days for regular payroll costs were computed by\ndetermining the average days of service being reimbursed and adding the days between the end of\neach service period and the payments to employees. This amount was then adjusted to incorporate\nthe effects of vacation pay based upon actual ETI data. By this method, Mr. Joyce determined the\nexpense lead for regular payroll costs to be 20.68 days. 97 No party challenged this approach, and the\nALls agree.\n\n\n          Incentive Pay Costs. ETI has an annual employee incentive program in place. Incentive\npayments for the year 2010 were made in the first quarter of 2011. The lead days for incentive pay\ncosts were based on the weighted days between the midpoint of the service period (i.e., July 1, 2010)\nand the date the incentives were paid (March 10, 2011).

The lead days\nfor affiliate service company costs were based on the number of days from the mid-month to the later\nof the contractual due date or the actual settlement date in the following month. By this method, Mr.\nJoyce determined the expense lead for affiliate service company costs to be 39.64 days. 99\n\n\n           The lead days for other O&M costs were based on a random sampling from the Test Year.\nMr. Joyce originally determined the expense lead for other O&M costs to be 47.46 days. 100\nHowever, to correct an error on his part, Mr. Joyce subsequently revised the expense lead time for\nother O&M costs down to 43.89 days. 101\n\n\n           Mr. Po us testified that ETI' s \"FAS 106-related expenses\" were wrongly included in either the\naffiliate service company costs or the other O&M costs. FASB is the body that establishes the rules\nthat constitute GAAP. FASB's Statement Number 106 (FAS 106) establishes the standards for an\nemployer's treatment of the non-cash retirement benefits it gives its employees. Based on the action\ntaken by the Commission in Docket No. 16705, 102 Mr. Pous believes that ETI's FAS 106 costs\nshould have been separately identified and accounted for in the lead-lag study. He contended that,\nwhen those costs are properly accounted for, it results in an additional negative cash working capital\nof $3.8 million. 103\n\n\n\n98\n      Id. at 14 and JJJ-3.\n99\n      ETI Ex. 17 (Joyce Direct) at 15, and JJJ-3.\n100\n      Id.at15-17,andJJJ-3.\n101\n      ETI Ex. 54 (Joyce Rebuttal) at JJJ-R-2.\n102\n   Application ofEntergy Gulf States, Inc.for Approval of Its Transition to Competition Plan and the Tariffs\nImplementing the Plan, and for the Authority to Reconcile Fuel Costs, to Set Revised Fuel Factors, and to\nRecover a Surcharge for Underrecovered Fuel Costs, Docket No. 16705, (Oct. 13, 1998).\n103\n      Cities Ex. 5 (Pous Direct) at 85-88.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE43\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          Mr. Joyce contended that the prior Commission decision upon which Mr. Pous relies, Docket\nNo. 16705, dates from 1996, is inapplicable to the facts in the present case, is outdated, and has been\nsuperseded by subsequent Commission decisions. Mr. Pous advocated a 312.55-day expense lead\nfor FAS 106 expenses. However, Mr. Joyce pointed out that, during the Test Year, ETI made its\nFAS 106 payments to a trust at the end of each month, resulting in a one-half month payment lead\n(15.25 days). Mr. Joyce testified that his treatment of FAS 106 expenses in his lead-lag study is\nconsistent with the approach that was approved by the Commission in a recent Oncor ratemaking\ncase, Docket No. 35717 . 104\n\n\n           The AIJs conclude that ETI met its burden to show that there were 39.64 expense lead days\nfor Affiliate Service Company Costs and 43.89 expense lead days for Other O&M Costs.\n\n\n                       (b) Expense Lead- Current Federal Income Tax Expense\n\n           As required by P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.23l(c)(2)(B)(iii)(IV)(-f-), Mr. Joyce calculated the lead\ndays for federal income taxes by measuring the days between the midpoints of the annual calendar\nyear service periods and the actual dates on which ETI made its estimated quarterly tax payments.\nBy this method, Mr. Joyce determined the expense lead for current federal income tax costs to be\n38 days. He then determined that this resulted in a $1.6 million cash working capital requirement\nassociated with the Company's Federal Income Tax Expenses. 105\n\n\n           Mr. Pous testified that the Company's cash working capital requirement for Federal Income\nTax Expenses ought to be a negative number or, at most, zero. He bases this argument on his\nassertion that, during the past five years, the Company \"has received in excess of a net $90 million of\nrefunds\" on its federal income taxes.

Moreover, Mr. Joyce stresses that his approach for calculating\nthe expense lead for current federal income taxes is perfectly consistent with: ( 1) the requirements of\nP.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.231(c)(2)(B)(iii)(IV)(-f-); (2) current IRS guidelines found at IRS\nPublication 542; and (3) Commission precedent. Mr. Joyce further points out that, by contrast,\nMr. Pous' approach has been consistently rejected by the RRC. 107            The Al.Js find Mr. Joyce's\narguments to be more persuasive on this point and conclude that ETI has met its burden as to show\nthat the expense lead for current federal income tax costs it utilized in the lead-lag study is\nreasonable and appropriate.\n\n\n          The AlJ s conclude that ETI met its burden to show that there were 39 .64 expense lead days\nfor Affiliate Service Company Costs and 43.89 expense lead days for Other O&M Costs.\n\n\n                       (c) Expense Lead and Lag-Taxes Other than Income Taxes\n\n          This group of taxes consists of: (1) payroll-related taxes; (2) ad valorem taxes; (3) Texas state\ngross receipts taxes; (4) the PUC assessment tax; and (5) Texas state franchise taxes. Calculating\nfrom the midpoints of the work periods to the respective payment dates of the taxes, Mr. Joyce\ndetermined that the payroll taxes had an expense lead time of 16.45 days. As to the franchise taxes,\nMr. Joyce concluded that the Company had a collection lag of 46.42 days because the Company was\nrequired to pay the taxes in May 2010. As to the other non-payroll-related taxes, Mr. Joyce\ncalculated from the midpoint of the period for which the tax was assessed to the payment date,\nresulting in the following expense lead days: 213.51 days for ad valorem taxes; 74.28 days for Texas\n\n\n\n\n106\n      Cities Ex. 5 (Pous Direct) at 88-89.\n  7\n!0    ETI Ex. 54 (Joyce Rebuttal) at 33-36, JJJ-R-1.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                               PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE45\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nstate gross receipts taxes; and 225.50 days for the PUC tax. 108 No party challenged this approach,\nand the AU s agree.\n\n\nF.        Self-Insurance Storm Reserve [Germane to Preliminary Order Issue No. S]\n\n          In Docket Nos. 16705 and 37744, the Commission authorized ETI to maintain a reasonable\nand necessary storm damage reserve account of $15,572,000. 109 As of June 30, 1996, ETI had a\npositive reserve balance of $12,074,581, constituting a reduction to rate base. Over the next\n15 years, ETI charged $101,670,803 to the reserve related to more thart 200 storms (excluding\nsecuritized events), but it accrued only $29,796,478 through base rates. Thus, ETI's end-of-test-year\nbalance for its storm damage reserve in the present case was a negative $59,799,744. 110 This\nnegative balance is an addition to rate base. 111\n\n\n          OPC and Cities argue that ETI's current storm damage reserve negative balance should be\nadjusted. OPC contends that ETI failed to prove that its storm damage expenses booked since 1996\nwere reasonable and prudently incurred, so it recommends disallowing all of those charges arid\nrefunding to customers the resulting positive balance that exceeds the authorized balance.\nAlternatively, OPC suggests that ETI's negative balartce be reset to its currently authorized balance,\nwith no refund to customers. Cities contend that ETI's current negative storm damage reserve\nbalance should be reduced because it includes: unreasonable expenditures associated with a 1997 ice\nstorm; expenses associated with former assets in Louisiarta; and amounts that Cities claim should\nhave been treated as insurance deductibles. Cities also recommend transferring ETI' s Hurricane Rita\nRegulatory Asset to the storm damage reserve.

The Effect of Prior Settled Cases\n\n        As with the Hurricane Rita Regulatory Asset (Section V.B.), the effect of the black-box\nsettlements in Docket Nos. 34800 and 37744 is a significant issue concerning the storm damage\nreserve. However, the parties' positions are generally reversed from the positions taken on the\nHurricane Rita Regulatory Asset. That is, ETI now argues that its storm reserve negative balance\nwas resolved and approved in those settled dockets, while Cities and OPC argue that it was not.\n\n\n        ETI notes that the final orders in Docket Nos. 34800 and 37744 contained \"stipulated and\nagreed upon\" conclusions of law stating that overall total invested capital through the end of the test\nyear in those cases met the requirements of PURA § 36.053( a) that electric utility rates be based on\nthe original cost, less depreciation, of property used by and useful to the utility in providing\nservice. 112 Then ETI cites language in P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.231(c)(2)(E), which provides that any\ndeficit in a self-insurance plan will be considered an increase to rate base, or invested capital. As a\nresult, ETI argues, the Commission could not make a determination that a rate base expense item\nwas included in rate base as used and useful without also determining that the rate base expense was\nprudently and reasonably incurred. 113 Thus, ETI asserts, a Commission conclusion of law that\napproved invested capital as meeting the requirements of PURA § 36.053(a) necessarily also\ndetermined that an expense included in rate base was prudently and reasonably incurred. In other\n\n\n112\n   PURA§ 36.053(a) provides: \"Electric utility rates shall be based on the original cost, less depreciation, of\nproperty used by and useful to the utility in providing service.\"\n113\n   ETI cited: City ofAlvin v.

Cities point out that in order to comply with PURA, all final orders in rate\ncases must include a conclusion of law stating that the overall total invested capital through the end\nof the test year meets the requirements of PURA§ 36.053( a). However, Cities contend, pursuant to\nthe parties' agreements in Docket Nos. 37744 and 34800, no determination was made as to what was\nincluded in ETI' s total invested capital in those cases. Cities explain that in Docket Nos. 37744 and\n34800 Cities claimed that certain expenses were not properly included in the storm reserve balance,\nwhile ETI argues that they were.             However, neither Cities nor ETI's recommendation was\nspecifically approved as part of the base rate settlement and neither of their recommended balances\nmay be considered as the basis for setting rates in those dockets. 116 Thus, Cities argues, in such\n\"black box\" settlements no specific storm reserve balance is approved unless expressly stated. Cities\nalso argues that the final orders in Docket Nos. 37744 and 34800 could just as logically be\ninterpreted as denying ETI' s request to include objectionable expenses in the storm damage reserve,\nbecause both orders specified that the revenue requirement approved in those cases did not include\nany prohibited expenses. Finally, Cities states that adoption of ETI' s arguments would make black-\nbox settlements impossible in the future. 117\n\n\n\n114\n     ETI cited Docket No. 7195, 14 P.U.C.

As pointed out by Cities, in those\ndockets the intervenors disputed various items in ETI' s requested storm damage reserve, but the\n\"black box\" settlement did not specifically address those issues; consequently, it is as logical to\nconclude that objectionable expenses were excluded from the storm damage reserve and from the\ntotal invested capital as it is to conclude that the objectionable expenses were included. In\nSection V .B., the ALl s conclude that ETI' s Hurricane Rita regulatory asset should be considered as\nbeing   inclu~ed   in the black-box settlement and final order in Docket No. 37744, even though the\nsettlement and order did not expressly state how the Hurricane Rita regulatory asset issue was\nresolved. However, that issue involved unique circumstances and is distinguishable because PURA\n§ 39.459(c) required the Commission to consider the insurance payments for the Hurricane Rita\nrestoration expenses in ETI' s next rate case, which was Docket No. 37744; ETI requested a true-up\nin that docket of the insurance proceeds it received concerning the regulatory asset; and no party\nobjected to ETI' s proposed regulatory asset or its proposed amortization. In contrast, intervenors in\nDocket Nos. 34800 and 37744 did object to ETI' s proposed storm damage reserve and, under those\ncircumstances, it is not possible to determine how the issues concerning the storm damage reserve\nwere resolved by the black-box settlement. Therefore, the ALl s find that the black-box settlements\nand final orders in Docket Nos. 34800 and 37744 neither approved nor disapproved the\nreasonableness and necessity of ETI' s storm damage expenses incurred since 1996 or ETI' s current\nstorm damage reserve negative balance.\n\n\n118\n      OPC Reply Brief at 7-8.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                              PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE49\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          2. OPC's Proposed Adjustment\n\n          OPC witness Nathan Benedict testified that ETI failed to prove that any of its $101,670,803\nin storm damage expense booked since 1996 was prudently incurred, so he recommended\ndisallowing all of those charges and refunding to customers the resulting positive balance that\nexceeds the authorized balance. Removing those charges would leave ETI with a current positive\nstorm reserve balance of $41,871,059 (beginning balance of $12,074,581 + accruals of $29,796,478).\nThis balance exceeds the currently approved storm reserve balance of $15,572,000 by $26,299,059,\nand Mr. Benedict proposed that this surplus be refunded to rate payers at a rate of $1,314,953 per\nyear for 20 years. Mr. Benedict acknowledged that some storm damage expenses incurred by ETI\nsince 1996 likely were reasonable and necessary. Therefore, as an alternative proposal, Mr. Benedict\nsuggested that ETI' s current storm balance reserve be set at the last approved amount of $15,572,000\n(i.e., without any surplus or deficit). This proposal would result in a $75,363,744 reduction to ETI's\ncurrent storm damage reserve negative balance and rate base. 119\n\n\n          As discussed above, OPC disagrees with ETI's argument that the Commission implicitly\napproved these expenses in the final orders in Docket Nos. 34800 and 37744. 120 Therefore, OPC\nargues that ETI had to prove in the present case that the expenses were prudently incurred.\nConcerning ETI's burden of proof, OPC acknowledges that, although a utility has the ultimate\nburden to prove that its proposed rates are just and reasonable, once the utility establishes a prima\nf acie case of prudence of a rate change, the burden shifts to the other parties to produce evidence to\nrebut that presumption. Then, if the other parties rebut the presumption, the burden shifts back to the\nutility to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the challenged expenditures were prudent.\nHowever, OPC notes, if the utility fails to establish a prima facie case, the burden of going forward\nwith evidence never shifts to the other parties. 121 In OPC's opinion, ETI never established a prima\nfacie case because ETI' s spreadsheet of storm damage expenses was excluded from evidence and\n\n\n119\n      OPC Ex. 6 (Benedict Direct) at 6-16; OPC Initial Brief at 19.\n120\n      OPC Reply Brief at 7-8.\n121\n  OPC Reply Brief at 2-3, citing, Entergy Gulf States, Inc. v.

ETI also states that, in any\nevent, it met its burden of proof with regard to expenses booked to the storm damage reserve.\n\n\n          Concerning its proof, ETI states that its burden was to make a prima facie case supporting the\nprudence of its invested capital, 123 and once it made that showing, the burden shifted to the opposing\nparties to overcome the presumption of prudence by presenting evidence that reasonably challenged\nthe expenditures. 124 This is the same position as OPC. ETI argues that it met its burden to prove a\n                    125\nprimafacie case.          ETI notes that it provided storm cost data accompanied by narrative testimony\nthat supported the reasonableness of ETI's self-insurance plan; storm preparedness and response;\nservice quality; and cost of labor, materials, and services used to carry out distribution activities\n(including system restoration). For instance, ETI states, it presented its proposed storm reserve\nbalance through the direct testimony of Mr. Greg Wilson 126 and in the Commission's rate filing\npackage. 127 Mr. Wilson also explained the function of ETI' s self-insurance program, described the\n$50,000 threshold to exclude minor weather events, and provided work papers detailing the nominal\nand trended losses for each storm booked to the reserve since 1986, as well as annual and total loss\nlevels. 128\n\n\n\n122\n      OPC Reply Brief at 1-5.\n123\n   ETI Initial Brief at 22, citing, Application of Texas Utilities Electric Company for Authority to Change\nRates, Docket No. 9300, 17 P.U.C.

This evidence included ETI' s distribution operations,\nindustry-recognized comprehensive storm plans, annual storm drills, storm response and restoration\nprocesses, distribution maintenance and asset improvement processes, service quality and continuous\nimprovement programs, and vegetation management practices. ETI points out that Mr. Corkran also\ndescribed how it prepares for emergency situations, 129 and Mr. Corkran explained how charges to the\nstorm reserve are captured and recorded. 130 Mr. Corkran also noted that ETI has received either the\nEdison Electric Institute' s Emergency Assistance Award or Emergency Response Award every year\nsince 1998, which recognize ETI' s exemplary storm restoration response. 131 Likewise, Mr. Corkran\ndiscussed ETI' s reliability statistics since 2000, which demonstrated a high quality of service, 132 and\nhe provided four exhibits demonstrating that, on both per-kilowatt-hour (kWh) and per-customer\nbases, ETI' s distribution O&M costs compared favorably to the costs of other utilities. 133 In ETI' s\nopinion, because it carried out its distribution activities in the same efficient and cost-effective\nmanner while performing routine activities as during storm restoration, those metrics and reliability\nstatistics support the reasonableness of costs booked to the reserve. 134\n\n\n           ETI also argues that it supported the reasonableness of the costs booked to its storm reserve\nthrough the direct testimony of its supply chain witness, Mr. Joseph Hunter.

Furthermore, Mr. Hunter specifically noted\nthat the standardization of supply chain activities \"makes possible a smoother day-to-day operation\n                                                                       137\nas well as rapid response to major storms or emergencies.\"\n\n\n          Finally, ETI stated that it provided an extensive amount of storm reserve data through the\ndiscovery process, which provided a basis for any interested party to investigate the reasonableness\nof any particular storm response or expenditure booked to the reserve. It stressed that OPC witness\nBenedict acknowledged that ETI provided 420 pages and over 22,220 lines of detail reflecting every\ncharge to the storm reserve over the last 15years, 138 which specified the month, year, state, project\ncode, work order type, function, storm name, account number, resource code, resource code\ndescription, and amount. 139 Therefore, ETI argues that it made a primafacie case regarding its storm\nreserve through the presentation of narrative testimony, schedules, work papers, and expense detail\nand, accordingly, the burden shifted to parties seeking to disallow the expenses allocated to the storm\ndamage reserve to present evidence that reasonably challenges their prudence. 140 Yet, ETI contends,\nOPC did not challenge any specific expenditure booked to the reserve other than the 1997 ice storm\nexpenses discussed later. Therefore, ETI argues that it met its prima facie burden and OPC's\n                                                                                            141\nproposed disallowance of either $101,670,803 or $75,363,744 should be denied.\n\n\n          Although it is a close call, the ALls find thatETI established aprimafaciecasethat its storm\ndamage expenses incurred since June 30, 1996, were prudently incurred. A prima facie case is a low\nburden. It is not the same as a preponderance of the evidence. Rather, as stated in Town of Fairveiw\n\n135\n  ETI Ex. 16 (Hunter Direct) at 5, 9-10, and Exhibits JMH-l(Entergy Companies' Procurement Policy) and\nJMH-3 (Entergy Companies' Approval Authority Policy).\n136\n      ETI Ex. 16 (Hunter Direct) at 17.\n137\n      Id. at 18 (emphasis added).\n138\n      Tr. at 1703.\n139\n      Tr. at 1704.\n140\n      Docket No. 9300, 17 P.U.C.

As noted above, a reasonable inference from the evidence\npresented is sufficient to establish a prima facie case. ETI witness Gregory Wilson presented\ntestimony about the background of the storm damage reserve and about ETI' s yearly major storm\ndamage losses, although OPC is correct that he did not explicitly evaluate or determine whether\nETI' s expenses were reasonable and necessary. 144 In addition, OPC witness Benedict provided\ntestimony that ETI has booked $101,670,908 to the storm damage reserve since 1996, 145 and that\nETI' s $50,000 threshold is a means of excluding from the reserve small storm-related expenses that\nETI could anticipate as routine O&M expense and which should be excluded from the storm damage\nreserve. 146 ETI presented testimony that it had not recorded storm damage expense to both the storm\ndamage reserve and to O&M expense, 147 and Mr. Benedict agreed that he had no information to\n                     148\ncontradict this            or that any securitized costs were charged to the storm damage reserve. 149\nAlthough the document itself was excluded from evidence, Mr. Benedict testified that ETI provided\nhim with a 420-page spreadsheet covering all of ETI's storm damage expenses back to 1996,\nincluding the month, year, state, project code, project name, work order type, function, storm name,\n\n\n142\n      </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1764535\"><a href=\"/opinion/1764535/town-of-fairview-v-city-of-mckinney/\"><span class=\"volume\">271</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 467 (Tex.

Such testimony would have been more helpful than the evidence ETI relied upon.\nNevertheless, the burden of establishing a primafacie case does not require such direct testimony, if\na fact can be reasonably inferred from other evidence presented. The AU s reiterate that it is a close\ncall, but they find that ETI did present sufficient evidence to infer that the expenses charged to the\nstorm damage reserve were prudently incurred. At that point, the burden shifted to OPC to produce\nevidence to challenge specific expense items included in the storm damage reserve, but OPC did not\npresent any such evidence except for the items discussed below. Therefore, the AUs recommend\nthat the Commission not adopt either of 0 PC's recommended denials of expenses contained in ETI' s\nstorm damage reserve.\n\n\n          3.   1997 Ice Storm\n\n          ETI's proposed negative storm reserve balance includes $13,014,379 in expenditures\nassociated with a 1997 ice storm. Cities and OPC contend that this expense should be excluded from\nthe storm balance reserve.\n\n\n          Cities witness Pous explained that ETI first requested to include the 1997 ice storm expense\nin the storm damage reserve as a post test year adjustment in its 1995-1996 test-year rate case,\nDocket No. 16705. The Commission denied the requested post test year adjustment and stated that\nthe expense should be considered in ETI's next rate case. Thereafter, ETI had a series of rate cases\n(Docket No. 20150       1998 rate case; Docket No. 30123 -2004 rate case; Docket No. 34800-2007\nrate case; Docket No. 37744-2009 rate case) in which intervenors challenged the 1997 ice storm\nexpenses, but those cases all settled or were otherwise concluded without any express decision\n\n\n150\n      Tr. at 1704.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                 PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                  PAGE55\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nconcerning the prudence of ETI' s 1997 ice storm expenses. 151 Mr. Po us testified that these expenses\nare now appropriately at issue in the present case, and he recommended that the entire balance be\nexcluded from the storm damage reserve. He pointed out that in Docket No. 18249, the Commission\nfound that ETI' s poor quality of service exacerbated the extent of damage caused by the storm, and it\nfound that the response efforts were uneven and delayed and could have been more effective if ETI\nhad a better communication and management program in place. 152 Mr. Pous also contended that in\nthe present case ETI failed to prove that any portion of the 1997 Ice Storm expenses were\nreasonable. 153\n\n\n          Thus, Cities argue that the Commission has already determined that ETI' s negligence was a\nmajor factor in the extent and duration of the outages, 154 so no expenses associated with the 1997 ice\nstorm should be eligible for recovery from customers through the storm damage reserve. In response\nto ETI's argument that it was already penalized for these issues in Docket No. 18249 through a\nreduction to the allowed ROE, Cities argue that the Commission did not absolve ETI from\nresponsibility for damage caused by ETI's poor service quality, and ETI's customers should not be\nordered to pay for expenses that were caused by ETI's negligence. 155\n\n\n          OPC makes the same arguments as Cities concerning the 1997 ice storm expenses. 156\n\n\n          ETI argues that, due to quality of service issues related to the 1997 ice storm, the\nCommission reduced Entergy Gulf States, Inc.' s (EGSI) ROE by 60 basis points in Docket\nNo. 18249 and subjected EGSI to significant spending requirements and quantified performance\nguarantees. In ETI's opinion, it would be inequitable to now penalize ETI a second time for the\n\n151\n      Cities Ex. 5 (Pous Direct) at 49-55.\n152\n      Entergy Gulf States, Inc.

Moreover, ETI argues that it established that its expenses were reasonable and\nnecessary. ETI witness Shawn Corkran testified that the 1997 ice storm was the most destructive\nwinter storm ever to hit the EGSI/ETI system, with about 3,400 miles of distribution lines and\n560 miles of transmission lines de-energized during the storm's peak. A large part of the restoration\neffort involved clearing broken and fallen trees and tree limbs from lines. Mr. Corkran reviewed all\nof the costs incurred in response to the 1997 ice storm and stated that they were reasonable and\nnecessary to reliably restore service to customers as quickly as possible after the storm. He provided\nan exhibit with a detailed breakdown of labor, materials, transportation, lodging, and other expenses\nincurred.     In his opinion, all of these costs charged to the storm damage reserve, totaling\n$13,014,379, were reasonable, necessary, and prudently incurred. 157\n\n\n          The ALls recommend that the Commission authorize ETI to include in the storm damage\nreserve its $13,014,379 in expenditures associated with the 1997 ice storm. ETI established that\nthose expenses were reasonable and necessary to repair the damage and restore power to its\ncustomers. ETI witness Mr. Corkran provided detailed testimony concerning the seriousness of the\nstorm and the resulting expenses incurred for repair work and restoration of power to customers. 158\n\n\n          In contrast, Cities and OPC did not challenge any specific item in these restoration expenses.\nInstead, they relied upon the Commission's findings in Docket No. 18249 that ETl's deficient\nmaintenance exacerbated the amount of damage caused by the storm. However, in that docket the\nCommission also reduced ETI' s ROE by 60 basis points due to poor service issues, including\ndeficient preventative maintenance. The Commission made the reduction in ROE retroactive and\nrequired ETI to make refunds to customers. Likewise, in that docket the Commission found that the\nice storm was severe and that significant damage would have occurred even with exemplary\nvegetation management and other preventative measures. It is not feasible to accurately determine\nnow what portion of ice storm damage that occurred 15 years ago was caused by preventative\nmaintenance issues.\n\n\n157\n      ETI Ex. 48 (Corkran Rebuttal) at 2-12.\n158\n      ETI Ex. 48 (Corkran Rebuttal) at 2-12 and Ex.

Nevertheless, once the ice storm occurred, ETI had to take appropriate action to\nrepair the damage and restore service. ETI has established the expenses incurred in those efforts\nwere reasonable and necessary, and the Al.Js find that they should be included in the storm damage\nreserve. Therefore, the AUs recommend that the Commission deny Cities and OPC's proposed\nadjustment.\n\n\n       4. Jurisdictional Separation Plan Allocation\n\n       Cities complained that ETI's storm damage reserve deficit includes $12,498,325 in costs that\nbelong to Louisiana jurisdiction customers but were incorrectly transferred to Texas customers\nduring implementation of the Jurisdiction Separation Plan.         Cities explain that before the\njurisdictional separation of EGSI into ETI and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, LLC (EGSL), the\ntransmission investment and expense associated with maintaining the transmission system, including\nstorm restoration costs, was allocated between the Texas and Louisiana retail jurisdictions. In the\njurisdictional separation of EGSI into ETI and EGSL, the transmission system investment was split\nbetween each company based upon a situs basis. The transmission facilities in Texas were\ntransferred to ETI and the transmission facilities in Louisiana were transferred to EGSL. After the\njurisdictional separation, ETI and EGSL were each responsible for future O&M expense, including\nstorm restoration expense, associated with their respective transmission investments.\n\n\n       Cities claim that in the present case ETI has attempted to reverse the allocation of expenses\nincurred on behalf of Louisiana customers before the jurisdictional separation and to charge those\nexpenses to Texas customers through the storm damage reserve. In Cities' opinion, any expense that\nwas allocated to Louisiana customers prior to the jurisdictional separation was properly charged to\nLouisiana customers. Cities argue that ETI may not now reverse expenses allocated to Louisiana\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE58\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ncustomers and charge them to Texas customers solely on the basis that ETI acquired the transmission\ninvestment located in Texas. 159\n\n\n          In response, ETI witness Considine explained that an analysis of storm reserve charges was\npreformed prior to the jurisdictional separation to determine if storm charges were incurred for Texas\nor Louisiana property. The reclassification of certain charges was made as a result of that analysis,\nwhich is in evidence, to properly reflect the state in which the storm charges were incurred. The\nlargest charge assigned to ETI through this analysis was a $10,652.130 charge related to project\n\"E2PPSJ8291 Trans EGSI-TX Hurricane Rita 9-24-05,\" which expressly related to damages to the\nTexas portion of the former EGSI transmission system. Similarly, costs were assigned from ETI to\nEGSL for projects such as \"E2PPSJ8296 Trans. Hurricane Katrina - EGSl-La\" and \"E2PPSJ8302\nTrans EGSI-LA Hurricane Rita 9-24-05,\" that clearly related to assets located in Louisiana. In other\nwords, prior to the separation, the Texas portion of the storm damage reserve could include charges\nfor restoration work performed on assets located in Louisiana, and vice versa. The analysis\nconducted pursuant to the separation re-aligned the charges to the jurisdiction where the assets are\nlocated. In that way, ETI argues, neither jurisdiction has charges in its storm reserve balance for\nassets located in the other jurisdiction. In short, ETI argues that the assets and liabilities following\nthe separation have been properly assigned and no improper cost shifting occurred. 160\n\n\n          The ALJ s recommend that the Commission deny Cities' proposed adjustment. ETI offered\nevidence to explain how its reclassification study reassigned various costs from the Texas\njurisdiction to Louisiana, as well as from the Louisiana jurisdiction to Texas. This study resulted in\nmore expenses from Louisiana being reassigned to the Texas jurisdiction than from Texas to\nLouisiana, but Cities offered no evidence to explain why the study was flawed or why the\nreassignments were in error. The ALJs found ETI's evidence to be credible and that it supported the\njurisdictional allocation of these expenses as proposed by ETI.\n\n\n\n159\n      Cities Ex. 5 (Pous Direct) at 59-60; Cities Initial Brief at 19-20.\n160\n    ETI Ex. 46 (Considine Rebuttal) at 25 and Ex.

Mr. Pous asserted that this amount is equivalent to a deductible for insurance purposes\nand should have not been charged to the reserve. Cities note that P. U. C. SUBST. R. 25 .231 (b)( 1)(G)\nrequires that a storm reserve only collect for \"property and liability losses which occur, and which\ncould not have been reasonably anticipated and included in operating and maintenance expenses.\"\nBecause of ETI's low $50,000 threshold, Cities contend, ETI has recorded to. the storm reserve\nexpenses associated with 219 different weather events in the past 15 years. This equates to\napproximately 14.6 weather events per year, or 1.2 weather events per month, on average. In Cities'\nview, ETI' s booking to the storm damage reserve of all expenses associated with a weather event\nexceeding $50,000 - including the first $50,000 - is inconsistent with P.U.C.                  SUBST.\n\nR. 25.23l(b)(l)(G). Cities argue that ETI may not reasonably claim that such a recurring expense is\n\"not reasonably anticipated\" to qualify it for the storm reserve. Cities proposed adjustment is based\non $50,000 for each of the 219 storm events, for a total of $10,950,000. In addition, based on the\nnature of ETI's recurring storm expense, Cities also recommend that the deductible amount be\nincreased to $500,000, which Cities stated is consistent with the storm reserve treatment afforded to\nother utilities in Texas. 161\n\n\n          ETI witness Gregory Wilson testified that Mr. Pous misconstrued the $50,000 trigger when\nhe treated it as a deductible. Mr. Wilson explained that if a storm causes $50,000 or less in damage,\nthe expenses are not charged to the storm damage reserve. However, if a storm causes more than\n$50,000 in damage, all of the expenses are charged to the reserve. He noted that if the $50,000 were\ntreated as a deductible, then that amount would still be charged to O&M whenever storm damage\nexceeded the $50,000 threshold. But, under the current arrangement, when storm damage exceeds\n$50,000 all of the expenses are charged to the storm damage reserve, and the first $50,000 is not\ncharged to O&M. Therefore, no double recovery occurs. Moreover, ETI argues that Cities'\nproposed retroactive removal of these amounts from the reserve would constitute a disallowance of\n\n161\n      Cities Ex. 5 (Pous Direct) at 61-63; Cities Initial Brief at 20-21.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                    PAGE60\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ncosts without any finding of imprudence, as well as impermissible retroactive ratemaking. ETI also\ncontends that even if the Commission were to implement Mr. Pous' s recommendation prospectively,\nit would require a corresponding increase in ETI' s O&M costs. Therefore, ETI disagreed with\nCities' recommendation to reduce the current balance of the storm damage reserve by $10,950,000 or\nto change the current level of the threshold. 162\n\n\n          The AlJs find that Cities' proposed adjustment to ETI's storm damage reserve is not\nwarranted. ETI explained that the $50,000 threshold amount was included in the storm damage\nreserve whenever storm restoration expenses exceeded the threshold, but that amount was not\nincluded in O&M expense. Accordingly, no double recovery has occurred, and Cities presented no\nother valid reason to disallow the allocation of these expenses to the storm damage reserve.\nTherefore, the A1J s recommend that the Commission deny Cities' proposed $10,950,000 adjustment\nto ETI's current storm damage reserve balance. As a policy matter, the Commission may choose to\nincrease ETI' s threshold on a prospective basis to some higher amount, as recommended by Cities,\nbut the evidence presented by the Cities on this issue was not sufficient for the A1J s to make such a\nrecommendation.\n\n\n          6. Hurricane Rita Regulatory Asset\n\n          As discussed in Section V.B., Cities recommend an adjustment to the Hurricane Rita\nregulatory asset, and they recommended the adjusted balance be moved to the storm damage reserve.\nFor the reasons stated in Section V .B., the AlJs recommend that the Commission not adopt Cities'\nproposal to move the Hurricane Rita regulatory asset to the storm damage reserve.\n\n\n          7. Conclusion\n\n          In conclusion, the AlJs find that ETI's storm damage expenses since 1996 and its storm\ndamage reserve balance were not approved by the Commission as a result of the black-box\nsettlements in Docket Nos. 34800 and 37744. The AlJs also find that ETI established aprimafacie\ncase concerning the prudence of its storm damage expenses incurred since 1996 and that intervenors'\n\n162\n      ETI Ex. 72 (Wilson Rebuttal) at 2-3; BIT' s Initial Brief at 27-28; ETI Reply Brief at 21-22.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                 PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE61\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nproposed adjustments should be denied. Therefore, the ALJ s recommend that the Commission\napprove ETI's test-year-end storm reserve balance of negative $59,799,744.\n\n\nG.            Coal Inventory\n\n              ETI is the partial owner of two coal-fired power generating facilities. It owns a 29. 75 percent\ninterest in Nelson 6, a 550 megawatt (MW) unit located in Westlake, Louisiana (Nelson), and a\n17 .85 percent interest in Big Cajun II, Unit 3, a 588 MW unit located in New Roads, Louisiana\n(BCIUU3). EGSL is the majority owner and operator of Nelson and is responsible for the supply and\ndelivery of coal to that facility. A third party, LaGen, is a co-owner of BCIUU3, and is the operator\nof the plant. Pursuant to a joint operating agreement between the co-owners, LaGen is responsible\nfor the acquisition and delivery of coal to BCIUU3. The coal for both units comes, via train, from\nminefields in Wyoming. 163\n\n\n              Entergy has adopted a \"Coal Inventory Policy\" at Nelson to ensure that a sufficient coal\ninventory is always maintained on-site to help mitigate transportation and unit operating risks. The\npolicy calls for, among other things, a 12-month average inventory target of a 43-day supply of coal.\nBecause Entergy is not the operator of BCIUU3, it does not have ultimate control over the coal\ninventories at that unit. Pursuant to the joint operating agreement for that unit, however, each year\nETI nominates for the next calendar year the level of coal to be delivered for its account at BCIUU3.\nETI' s nomination process is targeted to ensure an end-of-year inventory target of a 43-day supply of\n        164\ncoal.\n\n\n              In its application, ETI includes a coal inventory amount in its rate base that is based upon the\naverage inventories at Nelson and BCIUU3 for the 13 months ending in June 2011. 165 The average\ncoal inventory at Nelson was 384,860 tons, representing approximately 48 days of inventory,\n\n\n163\n      ETI Ex. 33 (Trushenski Direct) at 3-4.\n164\n      ETI Ex. 33 (Trushenski Direct) at 30-31.\n165\n    ETI Ex. 68 (Trushenski Rebuttal) at 2. Notably, the amount ETI is seeking in its Rate Base is calculated\nupon a 13-month average ending June 2011 (the last month of the Test Year), even though that amount is\nslightly less than the 12-month average for the Test Year.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                 PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                         PAGE62\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nassuming an average daily burn rate of 8,000 tons. The total proposed dollar amount for the coal\ninventories at both facilities is $9,846,037. Of that total, the Nelson portion is $6,040,926, and the\nBCIUU3 portion is $3,805,111. 166 ETI witness Ryan Trushenski, the Manager of the Solid Fuel\nSupply Group for ESI, testified that the coal inventory levels that were maintained at Nelson and\nBCII/U3 during the test year were reasonable and the costs 'incurred to maintain those levels were\nreasonable. 167\n\n\n          Cities do not challenge the reasonableness of the Company's 43-day inventory targets.\nRather, Cities point out that the size of the actual inventory that was maintained on-site at Nelson\nduring the Test Year exceeded the Company's inventory target level. Therefore, Cities contend that\ncustomers should not be forced to pay for inventory levels exceeding a 43-day supply (the amount\nthat the Company determined, through its Coal Inventory Policy, to be a reasonable and necessary\ninventory to maintain on-site). According to Cities' witness, Karl Nalepa, a 43-day inventory of coal\nat Nelson would equate to 340,000 tons. He recommends that the value of a 43-day supply of coal\nbe included in the rate base, but that $1,451.415 be excluded from the rate base to account for\ninventory at Nelson that was in excess of the 43-day supply. 168\n\n\n          The evidence shows that the Company's inventory \"target\" was a 43-day supply, while actual\ninventories during the Test Year averaged around a 48-day supply. Mr. Trushenski pointed out, and\nthe A1J s concur, that the 43-day \"target\" was never intended to represent a hard and fast figure from\nwhich no deviations could be allowed. Rather, the target merely represents an operational planning\ntool. Moreover, there are many real-world factors - such as train cycle times, coal burn rates, and so\non - that can cause the actual coal inventory to fluctuate over time. 169 The ALls conclude that the\n48-day coal inventory was acceptably close to the 43-day target and was not unreasonable. The total\nproposed dollar amount for this coal inventory is $9,846,037. The ALls conclude that the full value\nof the coal inventory was reasonable and should be included in rate base.\n\n166\n      ETI Ex. 68 (Trushenski Rebuttal) at 2, and 3 at WP/P RB 4.2.\n167\n      ETI Ex. 33 (Trushenski Direct) at 30-31.\n168\n      Cities Ex. 6 (Nalepa Direct) at 28-29, 6C and 6E.\n169\n      ETI Ex. 68 (Trushenski Rebuttal) at 4.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE63\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nH.        Spindletop Gas Storage Facility\n\n           ETI relies upon a variety of fuel types to generate electricity. A major fuel component is\nnatural gas. However, energy generated from natural gas typically has the highest marginal cost and,\ntherefore, it is most often the last resource deployed to generate electricity. The fluctuation of natural\ngas demand resulting from the changes in instantaneous demand is known as \"swing.\" Although a\nportion of the system's base load requirement is met with natural gas, the primary role of natural gas\n                                      170\nis as a swing fuel on the system.\n\n\n           Since 2004, ETI has owned and used the Spindletop Facility. ETI, through a third-party\noperator, uses the Spindletop Facility to maintain a natural gas inventory that can be used to supply\nETI's Sabine Station and Lewis Creek power generating facilities. Spindletop consists of two\n                                                                                                171\nsalt-dome storage caverns (and associated equipment) located near Sabine Station.                     The\nSpindletop Facility serves a function similar to that of a city water tower - it enables ETI to buy\nnatural gas at one point in time, store it, and use it at some future point when supplies are not\navailable elsewhere or when peak needs cannot otherwise be met. ETI maintains that the primary\nbenefit of the Spindletop Facility is that it provides: (1) supply reliability; and (2) swing flexibility.\n\"Supply reliability\" means that the facility can provide a reliable supply of gas for Sabine Station and\nLewis Creek during potential gas supply curtailments, such as can occur during hurricanes, freezes,\nor other unusual events. In a worst-case scenario, the Spindletop Facility is capable of providing\n100 percent of the fuel requirements for all five units at Sabine Station and one Lewis Creek unit for\nfour days at 70 percent of capacity. The Spindletop Facility also allows the Company to avoid\nalmost all intra-day gas purchases for Sabine Station. This is important because intra-day purchases\ntend to be more expensive than longer-term purchases. 172\n\n\n           Because major supply disruptions are more likely to occur during hurricane season and\nduring the winter, ETI manages its gas inventories conservatively during the period from June\n\n\n170\n      ETI Ex. 28 (Mcllvoy Direct) at 7.\n171\n      Id. at 31.\n172\n      ETI Ex. 28 (Mcllvoy Direct) at 32-33; ETI Initial Brief at 39, n. 264.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE64\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nthrough March in order to ensure that it can provide a reliable supply of fuel to meet peak generation\nloads for four consecutive days. During the remainder of the year, ETI will consider withdrawing\ngas from the Spindletop Facility when the current day spot market price is higher than the\nreplacement cost for the gas, as determined by future market indicators. Conversely, ETI injects gas\ninto the Spindletop Facility when the cost of gas in the current market is less than the price of gas in\nthe futures market. 173 For these various reasons, ETI witness Karen Mcllvoy, who is employed as\nthe manager of ESI' s Gas & Oil Supply Group, testified that that Spindletop Facility is used and\nuseful for providing reliable, economical service to ETI' s customers. 174 ETI witness Devon Jaycox,\nwho is employed as the manager of ES I's Operations and Planning Group, testified that the Company\nis always evaluating how much reliability the Spindletop Facility can provide as compared to other\noptions. He explained that, at Sabine Station, there is no other option that can provide ETI with the\nsame level of reliability and flexible swing service that the Spindletop Facility provides. 175\n\n\n           Cities are critical of the Spindletop Facility, contending that the costs of operating it outweigh\nthe benefits gained from it. No other party challenged ETI' s use of the Spindletop Facility. Cities'\nwitness Karl Nalepa testified that it costs ETI $13,219 ,097 per year to operate the gas storage facility,\nwhereas the Company could achieve the same supply reliability and swing flexibility benefits it gets\nfrom the Spindletop Facility through other gas supply options at a cost of only $1,724,659, thereby\nsaving its customers $11,494,438. Thus, Mr. Nalepa stated that it is imprudent for ETI to continue\noperating the Spindletop Facility. 176\n\n\n           Mr. Nalepa testified that no other Entergy operating company owns or leases its own gas\nstorage facility, yet those other companies are able to satisfy their needs for supply reliability and\nswing flexibility through other methods, such as existing gas supply and transportation contracts, at\nmuch lower costs. According to Mr. Nalepa, those other companies obtain supply reliability and\nswing flexibility through the use of monthly, daily, and intra-day natural gas supply contracts.

He\npointed out that EGSL has no firm transportation contracts, no firm supply contracts, and no fuel oil\nback-up at its generating plants. Thus, Mr. Nalepa stated that the only cost incurred by EGSL for\nreliability and flexibility is the commodity cost of the natural gas it purchases. Mr. Nalepa testified\nthat EGSL achieves the same level of service as ETI without incurring the large cost of the\nSpindletop Facility. 177\n\n\n          Mr. Nalepa asserted that the long-term gas supply contract that ETI recently entered into with\nEnbridge Pipeline, L.P. (the Enbridge Contract) will help provide the Company with increased\nsupply reliability because the gas supplied by Enbridge will come from production areas that are less\nsusceptible to hurricane-related disruptions. Mr. Nalepa also noted that ETI could meet its swing\nflexibility requirements through use of spot gas purchases, its operational balancing agreement with\nthe TETCO pipeline, and other pipeline companies, such as the Copano Pipeline that serves Lewis\nCreek. 178\n\n\n          Mr. Nalepa also disputed ETI's contention that the Spindletop Facility serves as a valuable\nprotection against extreme events such as hurricanes, by noting that the Spindletop Facility was out\nof service for almost two weeks in 2005 following Hurricane Rita. 179\n\n\n          As noted above, Mr. Nalepa testified that it cost ETI $13,219,097 to operate the Spindletop\nFacility in the Test Year. Mr. Nalepa estimated that the sum of the Test Year withdrawals of gas\nfrom the Spindletop Facility equaled 8,560,604 MMBtu. He then divided his total estimated cost of\nthe facility ($13,219,097) by his total estimated withdrawals of gas (8,560,604 MMBtu) to calculate\nan \"all-in per unit rate\" of $1.54 per MMBtu. He asserted that, by contrast, transportation costs on\nvarious gas pipelines connected to Sabine and Lewis Creek ranged from $0.025 to $0.22 per\nMMBtu. Mr. Nalepa estimated $0.18 per MMBtu as the average replacement cost that ETI would\nincur in transportation contracts if it were to stop using the Spindletop Facility and achieve the same\n\n177\n      Cities Ex. 6 (Nalepa Direct) at 22-23.\n178\n      Cities Ex. 6 (Nalepa Direct) at 25.\n179\n      Id. at 23-24.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE66\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nlevel of supply reliability and swing flexibility through the use of gas supply contracts. By\nmultiplying $0.18 times 8,560,604 MMBtu, he estimated that the benefits of the Spindletop Facility\ncould have been achieved through other means at a cost of only $1,724,659. Thus, Mr. Nalepa\nrecommended that $7,794,202 should be removed from ETI's base rate, and $5,424,895 should be\nexcluded as an eligible fuel expense. 180\n\n\n          ETI disagrees with essentially all of Mr. Nalepa' s points and responds to his testimony on a\nnumber of fronts. Perhaps foremost, ETI points out that Mr. Nalepa's main premise - that ETI's\ncustomers pay all the costs of the Spindletop Facility while the other Entergy operating customers\navoid those costs - is simply incorrect. According to ETI witnesses, 57.50 percent of the costs\nassociated with the Spindletop Facility are billed to EGSL as part of the MSS-4 billing process\nbetween ETI and EGSL for its \"legacy plants,\" 181 and another 2.4 percent of the costs are passed on\nto other Entergy operating companies through the MSS-3 agreement. Only 40.1 percent of the\nSpindletop Facility costs are borne by ETI customers. 182 Thus, Mr. Nalepa's calculations greatly\noverstate the costs of the Spindletop Facility that are borne by ETI customers and greatly understate\nthe costs that are borne by EGSL customers. ETI witness Considine also pointed out that the\nCommission has consistently and repeatedly concluded that the Spindletop Facility is used and useful\nand, therefore, has allowed ETI and its predecessors to recover the costs associated with the\nSpindletop Facility. 183\n\n\n          Ms. Mcllvoy also testified that, contrary to Mr. Nalepa's testimony, the conditions under\nwhich the other Entergy operating companies operate are so different from the conditions under\nwhich ETI operates that it makes no sense to assume they have similar supply reliability and swing\nflexibility needs. For example, EGSL and ETI both own roughly the same generating capacity from\n\n180\n      Id. at 24-27; Cities Ex. 6B (Errata No. 2).\n181\n   The legacy plants are the four power generating plants that were owned by Entergy Gulf States, Inc. -\nLewis Creek, Sabine Station, Nelson, and Willow Glen. When EGSI was broken into ETI and EGSL in 2007,\nETI became the owner of Lewis Creek and Sabine Station, while EGSL became the owner of Nelson and\nWillow Glen.

However, the ETI plants are\noperated at a much higher capacity than the EGSL plants. During the Reconciliation Period, EGSL\nburned much less natural gas than did ETI- 63,420,554 MMBtu burned at the EGSL plants versus\n144,538,535 MMBtu burned at the ETI plants. Moreover, EGSL has four gas-powered plants while\nETI has only two. Of EGSL's four plants, two (Calcasieu and Ouachita) use combined cycle gas\nturbine technology. This gives them a quick-start and shut-down capability, allowing them to be\noperated primarily only at peak demand times. Thus, according to Ms. Mcllvoy, Mr. Nalepa's\npremise - that because EGSL is able to reliably operate its gas-fired facilities without gas storage,\nETI should be able to do so as well - makes no sense. Because ETI bums a vastly larger amount of\nnatural gas than EGSL, its need for supply reliability and swing flexibility is much greater. 184\n\n\n          Ms. Mcllvoy also disputed Mr. Nalepa' s assertion that ETI could use the Enbridge Contract\nand call options to provide the Company with sufficient supply reliability. She noted that the\nmaximum amount of gas deliverable under the Enbridge Contract is insufficient to run the ETI plants\neven at minimum load. By contrast, the Spindletop Facility is capable of supplying all Sabine\nStation units and one unit at Lewis Creek for four days at 70 percent capacity.       Moreover, the\nEnbridge Contract will expire, whereas the Spindletop Facility can be operated indefinitely.\nMs. Mcllvoy explains that the use of call options is not viable because a call option must be\ndelivered \"ratably,\" meaning the gas must be delivered at a constant, even rate throughout the\ndelivery period. In order to have gas available to meet peak needs in the absence of the Spindletop\nFacility, ETI would have to exercise call options for a maximum delivery, but it would not need all\nof the gas delivered at off-peak times of the day. 185\n\n\n          ETI witness Jaycox disputed Mr. Nalepa's premise that ETI could use call options to ensure\nreliability.    According to Mr. Jaycox, \"call options are cheaper than storage, but there's no\ncomparison\" between the amount of reliability that they provide as compared to the Spindletop\nFacility. 186 Mr. Jaycox also explained that, due to their geographic location and the limited import\n\n184\n      ETI Ex. 60 (Mcllvoy Rebuttal) at 3-8.\n185\n      ETI Ex. 60 (Mcllvoy Rebuttal) at 8-12.\n186\n      Tr. at 969.\n\f                                           ··-~~------------------------\n\n\n\n\nSOAHDOCKETNO.-                             PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE68\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ncapability to the ETI service area, Sabine Station and Lewis Creek are considered particularly\n                                                                         187\ncritical, thereby increasing the need for reliability at those plants.\n\n\n          When Mr. Nalepa calculated ETI' s cost of achieving supply reliability and swing flexibility\nwithout the use of the Spindletop Facility, he estimated it would cost only $1,724,659. He did so, in\npart, by assuming that a five-day 35,000 MMBtu/day call option would cost ETI $26,250.\nMs. Mcllvoy asserted that it is not reasonable to assume that all options would cost as little as\n$26,250. Based upon her calculations, ETI would have to purchase 14 five-day 35,000 MMBtu/day\ncall options per month to achieve supply reliability. She posited that, based upon the laws of supply\nand demand, the more call options ETI has to purchase, the higher the cost of those options would\nbe. She also pointed out that Mr. Nalepa' s proposed use of call options would require ETI to spend\nhundreds of thousands of dollars each month to purchase call options that it would never exercise.\nAccording to Ms. Mcllvoy, it is unclear from Commission precedents whether ETI would be entitled\nto recover the costs of these un-exercised options. 188\n\n\n          The evidence establishes that the Spindletop Facility is critical to providing reliability and\nswing flexibility to ETI' s Texas plants. The AU s conclude that the Spindletop Facility is a used and\nuseful facility providing reliability and swing flexibility to ETI' s customers at a reasonable price, and\nCities' arguments to the contrary lack merit.\n\n\nI.        Short Term Assets\n\n          In its application ETI requested that, as short term assets, the following amounts be included\nin the rate base: prepayments in the amount of $7 ,218,037; materials and supplies in the amount of\n$29,252,574; and fuel inventory in the amount of $53,759,975. These amounts were derived using\n13-month averages ending June 2011. 189 Staff witness Anna Givens agrees with the approach of\nusing 13-month averages to determine the appropriate amounts for short term assets. However, she\n\n\n187\n      Tr. at 975, 986-87.\n188\n      ETI Ex. 60 (Mcllvoy Rebuttal) at 12-15.\n189\n      ETI Ex. 3 at Sched.

Using this approach, Ms. Givens recommends that, as short term assets, the\nfollowing amounts be included in the rate base: prepayments at $8,134,351 ($916,313 more than\nETI's request); materials and supplies at $29,285,421 ($32,847 more than ETI's request); and fuel\ninventory at $52,693,485 ($1,066,490 less than ETI's request). 190 ETI does not oppose Staff's\nrecommendation on this issue. No party has a criticism of Staffs estimates as to prepayment,\nmaterials and supplies, and fuel inventory, nor do the ALls. Accordingly, the ALls recommend\nadopting the numbers proposed by Staff.\n\n\nJ.         Acquisition Adjustment\n\n           In its application, ETI included an adjustment of $1,127,778 for an \"electric plant\nacquisition.\" 191 The proposed adjustment, which relates to costs incurred by ETI when it acquired\nthe Spindletop Facility, consists of closing costs of $211,209 and legal and internal costs of\n$916,568. 192 ETI witness Considine explained that, prior to December 2009, the same amounts were\nincluded in the Electric Plant in Service (FERC Account 101). On January 11, 2010, FERC issued\nOpinion No. 505 in FERC Docket No. ER07-956-00 and ordered the Company to transfer the\namounts above from Account 101 to FERC Account 114, Electric Plant Acquisition Adjustments.\nHe also pointed out that the costs were included in ETI's filed rate base amounts in Docket Nos.\n34800 and 37744. 193 Mr. Considine contended that these amounts should remain in rate base\nbecause they represent costs incurred by ETI for the purchase of a viable asset that benefits its retail\ncustomers. He pointed out that the amounts have previously been included in the Company's rate\nbase, but the only thing that has changed is that the amounts were previously allocated to a different\naccount. ETI argues that the fact that the costs were approved as part of rate base in two previous\nETI dockets verifies that they were \"reasonable, prudently incurred, and properly capitalized.\" 194\n\n\n190\n      Staff Ex. l (Givens Direct) at 3 l-32.\n191\n      ETI Ex. 3 at Sched.

Staff points\nout that those two prior dockets were settled rate cases and, therefore, \"provide no illumination on\nthis issue.\" 198 Finally, Staff argues that ETI failed to prove either element of the Commission's two-\npart Hooks test for the determination of whether the acquisition adjustment should be included in\nrate base. Pursuant to the Hooks test, in determining whether an acquisition adjustment should be\nincluded in rate base, \"the Commission should consider whether or not the purchase price was\nexcessive and whether or not specific and offsetting benefits have accrued to ratepayers.\" 199\nAccording to Staff, ETI' s acquisition adjustment should be disallowed because the Company failed\nto meet it burden of proof on these two issues. 200\n\n\n           The AU s are unpersuaded by the arguments of Staff and Cities. Their primary argument\n(i.e., that acquisition adjustments are simply not allowed as an addition to rate base for ratemaking\npurposes) is incorrect. Indeed, the Hooks decision, the precedent on which Staff relies for its\nfallback argument, suggests that, more often than not, acquisition adjustments should be included in\n\n\n195\n      ETI Ex. 46 (Considine Rebuttal) at 5.\n196\n      Staff Ex.

As\ndiscussed more fully in Section V.H. of this PFD, above, there is ample evidence in the record to\ndemonstrate that the Spindletop Facility is used and useful and provides specific and offsetting\nbenefits to ratepayers in a cost-effective manner. The evidence further shows that the acquisition\nadjustment represents costs that were actually incurred by ETI in the furtherance of acquiring the\nSpindletop Facility, and not a mere mark-up in original cost. For these reasons, the ALls conclude\nthat the $1,127,778 incurred by ETI in internal acquisition costs associated with the purchase of the\nSpindletop Facility was reasonable, necessary, and properly incurred. Accordingly, the ALl s agree\nthat it should be included in ETI' s rate base.\n\n\nK.        Capitalized Incentive Compensation\n\n          In the application, some of the incentive payments ETI made to its employees were\ncapitalized into plant in service accounts and ETI asks to include those amounts in rate base.202 A\nportion of those capitalized accounts represents payments made by ETI for incentive compensation\ntied to financial goals (financially-based incentive compensation). Cities contend that, consistent\nwith Commission precedent, ETI ought not be allowed to include in rate base the portion of its\ncapitalized incentive compensation that is attributable to financially-based               incentive\ncompensation. 203 The issue of whether financially-based incentive compensation is recoverable as a\nportion of Operating Expenses is discussed at length in Section VII.D.2. of this PFD. ETI makes the\nsame arguments in favor of recoverability in that section that it makes here as to the inclusion of\nfinancially-based incentive compensation in rate base. The discussion of that issue need not be\nrepeated here, but the analysis is the same. In summary, the ALls conclude that ETI should not be\nentitled to recover its financially-based incentive compensation costs. Thus, for the same reasons\n\n\n201\n      Hooks (emphasis added).\n202\n      Cities Ex. 2 (Garrett Direct) at 52.\n203\n      Id. at 52-53.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                               PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                      PAGE72\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ndiscussed in Section VIl.D.2, the Al.Js agree with Cities' contention that the portion of ETI's\nincentive payments that are capitalized and that are financially-based should be excluded from ETI' s\nrate base.\n\n\n          On the other hand, the Al.Js disagree with Cities as to the amount of that exclusion. Cities\nargue that $9,835, 111 (Cities' estimate of ETI' s financially-based incentive payments that are\ncapitalized each year into plant in service) should be removed from rate base. 204 Broadly speaking,\nETI has two categories of incentive compensation programs - annual incentive programs, and long-\nterm incentive programs. To arrive at the figure of$9,835,1 l l, Cities' witness Garrett assumed that:\n(1) 100 percent of the costs of the long-term incentive programs were financially-based and,\ntherefore, should be excluded from rate base; and (2) his calculated percentage of the annual\nincentive programs were financially-based and, therefore, should be excluded from rate base. He\nthen applied those percentages to the incentive costs that ETI capitalized in 2008, 2009, and the\nportion of 2010 prior to the Test Year. 205\n\n\n          As explained in Section VII.D.2., the AUs agree that Mr. Garrett was correct to recommend\nremoving 100 percent of the cost of ETI' s long-term incentive programs. However, as to the annual\nincentive programs, he defined what qualifies as \"financially based\" much too broadly, and therefore\nwrongly assumed that his calculated percentage of the costs of those programs should be excluded.\nInstead, the Al.J s conclude that the actual percentages should be used to determine the amount that is\nfinancially based. 206\n\n\n           Finally, ETI challenges Mr. Garrett's attempt to disallow capitalized incentive costs from\n2008 through June 30, 2009.\n\n\n           Much of the rate base that Mr. Garrett seeks to disallow (namely, costs from 2007\n           through June 30, 2009) is not presented for review in this rate case. Rather those\n           costs were presented for review in the Company's last rate case, Docket No. 37744,\n\n204\n      Id. at 52-53; Cities Initial Brief at 27.\n205\n      Cities Ex. 2 (Garrett Direct) at 53 and MG-2.10.\n206\n      See discussion in Section VII.D.2.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                              PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                  PAGE73\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          in which the Company presented capital additions for the period of April 1, 2007,\n          through June 30, 2009 .... Even though Docket No. 37744 was a settled case, the\n          final order concluded that '[b ]ased on the evidence in this docket, the overall total\n          invested capital through the end of the test year meets the requirements in PURA §\n          36.053(a) that electric utility rates be based on original cost, less depreciation of\n          property used and useful to the utility in providing service.' This conclusion goes\n          beyond merely settling issues without deciding anything and should be construed as\n          to be conclusive as to the reasonableness of capital costs at issue in that prior case. 207\n\n          The ALls agree. The Test Year for ETI's prior ratemaking proceeding ended on June 30,\n2009. The reasonableness of ETI' s capital costs (including capitalized incentive compensation) was\ndealt with by the Commission in that proceeding and is not at issue here. Thus, the ALls conclude\nthat exclusion of capitalized incentive compensation that is financially-based can only be made for\nincentive costs that ETI capitalized during the period from July 1, 2009 (the end of the prior Test\nYear) through June 30, 2010 (the commencement of the current Test Year). The amount of the\nexclusion is not specifically known at this time.\n\n\n       VI.    RATE OF RETURN [Germane to Preliminary Order Issue Nos. 4and11]\n\nA.        Capital Structure\n\n          ETI's capital structure is 50.08 percent debt and 49.92 percent equity. No party has taken\nissue with ETI's capital structure. Therefore, the ALls recommend that the Commission enter an\norder finding that the appropriate capital structure for ETI is 50.08 percent debt and 49.92 percent\nequity.\n\n\nB.        Return on Equity\n\n          The United States Supreme Court has set forth a minimum constitutional standard governing\nequity returns for utility investors:\n\n\n          From the investor or company point of view it is important that there be enough\n          revenue not only for operating expenses but also for the capital costs of the business.\n          These include service on the debt and dividends on the stock. By that standard the\n\n207\n      ETI Initial Brief at 44, quoting Docket No. 37744, Order at CoL 10 (Dec. 13, 2010).\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                     PAGE74\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n        return to the equity owner should be commensurate with returns on investments in\n        other enterprises having comparable risks. That return, moreover, should be\n        sufficient to assure confidence in the financial integrity of the enterprise, so as to\n        maintain its credit and to attract capital. 208\n\nThus, a utility must have a reasonable opportunity to earn a return that is: (1) commensurate with\nreturns on equity investments in enterprises having comparable risks; (2) sufficient to ensure the\nfinancial soundness of the utility's operations; and (3) adequate to attract capital at reasonable rates,\nthereby enabling it to provide safe, reliable service. The allowed ROE should enable the utility to\nfinance capital expenditures at reasonable rates and to maintain its financial flexibility during the\nperiod in which the rates are expected to remain in effect.\n\n\n        1. Proxy Group\n\n        Because ETI is not a publicly traded company, it is necessary to establish a group of\ncompanies that are publicly traded and that are comparable to ETI in certain fundamental business\nand financial respects to serve as its \"proxy\" in the ROE estimation process. Both financial theory\nand legal precedent support the use of comparable companies within a proxy group to determine a\nutility's ROE, and all of the ROE witnesses in this case have relied on proxy groups to estimate a\nrequired ROE for ETI.\n\n\n        ETI witness Hadaway started with all the vertically integrated electric utilities that are\nincluded in the Value Line Investment Survey (Value Line). To improve the group's comparability\nwith ETI, which has a senior secured bond ratings of BBB+ (Outlook Negative) from Standard &\n\n\n\n208\n    Federal Power Comm'n v.

Cities witness Parcell ran his calculations using both\nDr. Hadaway' s 23-utility proxy group and another 8-utility proxy group, but they produced similar\nROE results. TIEC witness Gorman used the same 23 utility proxy group as ETI witness Hadaway\nused.\n\n\n        Staff witness Cutter was the only witness to use a different proxy group. He used a 13 utility\nproxy group for his discounted cash-flow (DCF) analysis. To arrive at this proxy group, Mr. Cutter\nstarted with all of the domestic electric-utility companies tracked by Value Line because Value Line\nis the most widely used, independent investment service in the world.        Then he eliminated the\nutilities that did not meet the following criteria:\n\n\n•   Value Line Financial Strength ratings of A+, A or B++;\n\n•   A capital structure including less than 45 percent, or more than 55 percent, debt;\n\n•   Total capitalization in excess of five billion dollars;\n\n•   No recent dividend cuts or omissions;\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                       PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE76\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n•   No recent or potential merger activities or other major capital expansion; and\n\n•   No Value Line appraisal of being outside the norm.\n\nOn his final analysis, Mr. Cutter eliminated three of his 13 utility proxy group, referring to those he\neliminated as \"outliers.\" ETI points out, however, that one of the remaining ten companies, Con Ed,\nis not comparable to ETI because it is a delivery company as opposed to a vertically integrated\nutility. ETI' s essential criticism of Mr. Cutter's proxy group analysis is that he should have used a\nlarger proxy group and that he admitted a better comparison to ETI could be obtained from using a\nlarger proxy group.\n\n\n       2. DCF Analysis\n\n       To analyze ETI's cost of equity capital, all of the testifying experts first performed a DCF\nanalysis. The DCF approach is based on the theory that a stock's current price represents the present\nvalue of all expected future cash flows. In its most general form, the DCF model is expressed as\nfollows:\n\n\n                                                D1           D2     D 00\n                                     Po   = (1 + k) + (1 + k) + (1 + k)\n\nWhere Po represents the current stock price, D1 • ••• Doo are all expected future dividends, and k is\nthe expected discount rate, or required ROE. That equation can be simplified and rearranged to\nascertain the required ROE:\n\n\n                                                D(l   + g)\n                                           k=                +g\n                                                     Po\n\n\nWhere Po represents the current stock price, Dis expected future dividends, g is the growth rate, and\nk is the expected discount rate, or required ROE.\n\n\n       This is commonly referred to as the \"Constant Growth DCF' model in which the first term is\nthe expected dividend yield and the second term is the expected long-term growth rate. The\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                               PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE77\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nConstant Growth DCF model requires assumptions of: (1) a constant growth rate for earnings and\ndividends; (2) a stable dividend payout ratio; (3) a constant price-to-earnings multiple; and (4) a\ndiscount rate greater than the expected growth rate.\n\n\n          ETI witness Hadaway' s DCF analysis was based on three versions of the DCF model. In the\nfirst version of the DCF model, he used the constant growth format with long-term expected growth\nbased on analysts' estimates of five-year utility earnings growth. In the second version of the DCF\nmodel, for the estimated growth rate, Dr. Hadaway used only the long-term estimated gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) growth rate. In the third version of the DCF model, Dr. Hadaway used a two-stage\ngrowth approach, with stage one based on Value Line's three-to-five-year dividend projections and\nstage two based on long-term projected growth in GDP. The dividend yields in all three of the\nannual models are from Value Line's projections of dividends for the coming year and stock prices\nare from the three-month average for the months that correspond to the Value Line editions from\nwhich the underlying financial data are taken. 209\n\n\n          The DCF results for Dr. Hadaway' s comparable company group using the traditional constant\ngrowth model indicated an ROE of 9. 90 percentto 10.00 percent. Dr. Hadaway then recalculated the\nconstant growth results with the growth rate based on long-term forecasted growth in GDP. With the\nGDP growth rate, the constant growth model indicates an ROE range of l 0.40 percent to\n10.70 percent. Although the GDP growth rate is higher than the average of analysts' growth rates,\nDr. Hadaway testified that his GDP estimate is within the analysts' range and slightly below the\n6.00 percent 3-to-5 year average growth rate projection from Value Line. Finally, Dr. Hadaway's\nmultistage DCF model indicated an ROE range of 10.20 percent to 10.30 percent. The results from\nthe DCF model, therefore, indicate an ROE range of 9. 90 percentto 10. 70 percent.210 In his rebuttal,\nDr. Hadaway updated his ROE analysis using current market conditions but employing the same\nmethodologies that he used in his previous analysis.

According to the intervenors, these excessive growth rates exaggerate future\ncash flows, which results in an inflated ROE.\n\n\n           Intervenors argue that Dr. Hadaway' s Analysts' Constant Growth DCF model produces\nexcessive return estimates.212 In rebuttal, Dr. Hadaway's analysts' growth model produced a\n10.1 percent group average ROE and a 10.0 percent group median ROE. 213 The intervenors contend\nthat the group average long-term growth rate on which his DCF study was based was 5.62 percent,\nwhich is far too high to be sustainable in the long-term (as required as an input in the Constant\n                           214\nGrowth DCF model).               According to intervenors, the excessive level of his growth rate is apparent\nby comparison to current analysts' projected growth for U.S. GDP, which range from 4.5 percent to\n5.0 percent. 215 Dr. Hadaway's growth rate is more than 60 basis points above the most generous\nexpected growth of the U.S. economy. Intervenors contend that that nominal GDP should be the\nceiling of a reliable proxy for a utility dividend growth rate. Because the evidence shows that\nnominal GDP as projected by consensus analysts, the Executive Branch, and the Congressional\nBudget Office is 5 percent, Dr. Hadaway' s 5.62 percent growth rate is excessive and undermines the\nreasonableness of his models.\n\n\n           Intervenors criticize Dr. Hadaway's decision on rebuttal to exclude Edison International in\n                     216\nhis proxy group.           Dr. Hadaway did so because Edison International's ROE of 5.2 percent was\nbelow a 5.07 percent cost of debt based on an average of Triple B utility rates for the time period\n\n211\n      Id. at 44.\n212\n      TIEC Ex. 2 (Gorman Direct) at 39.\n213\n      ETI Ex. 52 (Hadaway Rebuttal) at Ex.

Rather, Dr. Hadaway forecasts\nfuture GDP growth using his own personal calculation that forecasts GDP by examining historic\nGDP growth over the last 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60-year periods and weighting those averages. 219\nIntervenors note that this approach was rejected by the Commission in the Oncor rate case. 220\n\n\n            Staff witness Cutter used the DCF model to project ETI' s cost of equity. Under Mr. Cutter's\nview, the theory underlying the DCF model is that the price of a share is equal to the present value of\nall future earnings. Unless the stock is sold for a profit (or loss) from the price it was originally\npurchased, the only way to determine earnings on a share is to determine its future dividends. This\nrequires, in Mr. Cutter's opinion, an understanding of investors' current expectations of growth of\nthose dividends. The issue is the growth expectation that investors have embodied in the current\nprice of the stock. According to Mr. Cutter, the best way to arrive at a reliable growth estimate of\nthose dividends is to use the growth estimates of investment advisory firms rather than the estimates\nof a single, independent analyst. 221\n\n\n            Mr. Cutter used both Value Line and Zacks Investment Service (Zacks) in ascertaining\nlong-term earnings growth rates.

The average analysts' growth rate was 4.94 percent. 223\nAccording to TIEC, ETI does not claim that a constant growth model using analysts' growth rates is\ninappropriate and argues that Dr. Hadaway failed to offer any rebuttal testimony criticizing\nMr. Gorman's Analysts' Growth DCF model.\n\n\n          Mr. Gorman also performed a constant growth DCF model using sustainable growth rates.\nHis average sustainable growth rate for the proxy group was 4.54 percent and produced a proxy\ngroup average and median DCF result of 8.91 percent and 8.9 percent, respectively. 224 According to\nTIEC, a sustainable growth rate is based on the percentage of a utility's earnings that are retained and\nreinvested in utility plant and equipment. 225\n\n\n          Mr. Gorman also performed a multi-stage DCF model to reflect changing growth\nexpectations that would reflect the possibility of non-constant growth for a company over time.\nMr. Gorman's multi-stage model reflected three growth periods: (1) a short-term growth period of\nfive years; (2) a transition period for years six through ten; and (3) a long-term growth period,\nstarting in year 11 through perpetuity. For the short-term period, Mr. Gorman relied on the\nconsensus analysts' growth projections from his constant growth DCF model (i.e., 4.94 percent).

For the\nlong-term period, he assumed the maximum sustainable growth rate for a utility company as proxied\nby the consensus analysts' projected growth rate for the U.S. GDP (i.e., 5.0 percent). The result of\nhis multi-stage growth DCF model was an average ROE of 9.37 percent and a median of\n9.48 percent. 226\n\n\n           Cities witness Parcell calculated the DCF results for each company in his proxy group by\nusing and considering five indicators of growth expectations consisting of: (i) 2007 -2011 earnings\nretention; (ii) five-year historical average earnings per share, dividends per share, and book value per\nshare; (iii) projected earnings retention; (iv) projected EPS, DPS, BVPS; and (v) projected EPS as\nreported by Yahoo Finance. Using this in his DCF model resulted in an ROE of 9.0 percent to\n9 .5 percent. 227\n\n\n           OPC witness Szerszen' s DCF analysis used the same group of 23 comparable companies\nincluded in Dr. Hadaway's DCF analysis.                Dr. Szerszen's DCF analysis was framed with\nconsideration of ETI' s financial integrity as discussed by the major bond rating agencies, the current\nand projected interest rate environment, and investment analyst views of the regulated utility\nsector. 228 Interest rates are currently very low, as reflected in the yields to maturity and interest rates\non various fixed income investments. OPC contends, in contrast to Dr. Hadaway, that utility stocks\nhave been less volatile than the stock market in general.2 29 This is confirmed by Value Line's\nDecember 23, 2011, observation that \"electric utility stocks have long been viewed as a safe haven in\nvolatile markets, due in large part to their generous dividend yields.\"230 Dr. Szerszen also took\nexception to Moody's characterization of ETI as having above average business and regulatory risk.\nMoody's assessment is primarily based on the lack of pass-through regulatory lag-reducing cost\n\n226\n      TIEC Ex. 2 (Gorman Direct) at 19, Ex.

Dr.\nSzerszen testified that ETI may not have a formula rate plan similar to the Louisiana and Mississippi\nEntergy operating companies, but it does have a Distribution Cost Recovery Factor (DCRF) and\nTransmission Cost Recovery Factor (TCRF) available that \"will allow ETI to charge ratepayers for\nadditional distribution and transmission investments outside of a traditional rate request filing.\"231\nNone of Entergy' s other operating companies have TCRF and DCRF riders. OPC notes that Cities\nwitness Parcell agrees that the availability of such recovery mechanisms affects ETI' s level of risk;\nhe testified that a combination of ETI' s fuel factor rider, TIC rider, energy efficiency rider, hurricane\ncost recovery rider, rate case expense rider, proposed increased customer service charge, and DCRF\nand TCRF riders results in about 30 percent of ETI' s total overall requested revenue requirement\nbeing subject to revenue risk and regulatory lag. 232\n\n\n          Dr. Szerszen incorporated two different dividend yield calculations in her DCF model. The\nfirst calculation estimated a dividend yield using 2011 average stock prices and 2012 projected\ndividend rates for each company, and the second calculation incorporated more recent March 5,\n2012, closing prices for the comparables. The average dividend yield using 2011 average stock\nprices was 4.66 percent and, using March 5, 2012, closing prices, was 4.32 percent.233\n\n\n          Dr. Szerszen provided some practical examples of how blind reliance on analyst earnings\ngrowth projections can lead to questionable DCF growth rates. At least five of the comparable utility\ncompanies had five-year earnings growth rate projections that ranged from 8.5 percent to 11 percent.\nDr. Szerszen stated that she was unaware of any regulated utility company that has consistently\nachieved such high earnings growth rate over the past 28 years, and that it is reasonable to assume\nsuch performance is unlikely in the longer term future. Dr. Szerszen's review of the comparable\ncompany past and projected growth rates resulted in a reasonable dividend growth rate expectation of\n3.9 percent to 5 percent.

For the\ncommonly used 90 day averaging period, the capitalization-weighted average ROE is 9.23 percent.\nEvaluating the averaging period at either 30or180 days produces ROE estimates of9.24 percent and\n9.34 percent, respectively. Dr. Miravete weighed the computations by the capitalization of each firm\nto correct the effect of each variable according to the relative market value of the corresponding\nutility. According to Dr. Miravete, this approach avoids the distortion caused by adding numerous,\nbut possibly irrelevant, firms that may produce biased estimates. Dr. Miravete conceded that the\neffect of ignoring differences in scale of utilities in the determination of the ROE is substantial. He\nacknowledged that if he had ignored the differences in size of these electric utilities, his DCF ROE\nestimate would have been 9 .68 percent. 235\n\n\n           3. Risk Premium Analysis\n\n           Dr. Hadaway's risk premium studies are divided into two parts. First, he compared electric\nutility authorized ROEs for the period 1980-2010 to contemporaneous long-term utility interest rates.\nThe differences between the average authorized ROEs and the average interest rate for the year is the\nindicated equity risk premium. He then added the indicated equity risk premium to the forecasted\nand current triple-B utility bond interest rate to estimate ROE. 236\n\n\n           In calculating the equity risk premium, Dr. Hadaway adjusted for the inverse relationship\nbetween equity risk premiums and interest rates (when interest rates are high, risk premiums are low\nand vice versa). Dr. Hadaway provided regression analyses of the allowed annual equity risk\npremiums relative to interest rate levels. The negative regression coefficients confirm the inverse\n\n\n234\n      Id. at 22.\n235\n      State Agencies Ex. 1 (Miravete Direct) at 12-13.\n236\n      ETI Ex. 6 (Hadaway Direct) at 36-38, 45.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                               PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE84\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nrelationship between equity risk premiums and interest rates according to ETI. Dr. Hadaway used\nthat negative interest rate change coefficient in conjunction with current and forecasted interest rates\nto establish the appropriate ROE. 237 Staff witness Cutter agreed that the risk premium analysis needs\nto reflect this adjustment. 238\n\n\n           The results of Dr. Hadaway' s initial equity risk premium studies indicate an ROE range of\n10.00 percent to 10.01 percent. ETI states that these results reflect the sharp drop in interest rates\nthat have occurred for high quality borrowers. The Federal Reserve System's continuing \"easy\nmoney\" policies have provided renewed liquidity in the credit markets that is reflected in these lower\nyields. These models, however, cannot capture the current equity volatility or the increased level of\nrisk aversion for equity investors. These circumstances indicate that the cost of equity has not\ndeclined to the extent that interest rates on utility debt have dropped. Thus, Dr. Hadaway testified\nthat the results of the risk premium analysis must be discounted and more emphasis placed on the\n                   239\nDCF analysis.\n\n\n           In his rebuttal, Dr. Hadaway updated his ROE analysis using current market conditions but\nemploying the same methodologies that he used in his previous analysis. 240 His updated risk\npremium analysis was an ROE of 10.38 percent using projected triple-B utility interest rates and\n9.96 percent using current triple-B utility interest rates. 241\n\n\n           TIEC contends that Dr. Hadaway' s utility risk premium analysis is flawed for two primary\nreasons. First, Dr. Hadaway developed a forward-looking risk premium model that relied on\nforecasted interest rates and volatile utility spreads that are uncertain and produce inaccurate results.\nAs Mr. Gorman testified, it is more reasonable at this time to rely on current observable interest rates\nrather than forecasted projections.

Mr. Gorman testified that \"a relative investment risk differential cannot be measured\nsimply by observing nominal interest rates.\"244 He noted:\n\n\n          While academic studies have shown that, in the past, there has been an inverse\n          relationship with these variables, researchers have found that the relationship changes\n          over time and is influenced by changes in perception of the risk of bond investments\n          relative to equity investments, and not simply changes to interest rates. 245\n\n          As described in Mr. Gorman's testimony, correcting Dr. Hadaway's models for the\nelimination of this inverse relationship adjustment puts Dr. Hadaway' s risk premium in the range of\n8.5 percent to 10 percent, with a midpoint of 9.3 percent. 246\n\n\n          Staff witness Cutter's \"conventional risk premium estimate\" estimated the cost of ETI's\nequity by comparing the costs of equity authorized for utilities across the United States to the yields\nof large-company corporate bonds that are rated Baa by Moody's within the timeframe of 1980\nthrough 2011. This risk premium approach relies on the historical relationship between two indices\n\n\n\n242\n      TIEC Ex. 2 (Gorman Direct) at 42-43; OPC Ex. !(Szerszen Direct) at 27-28.\n243\n      TIEC Ex. 2 (Gorman Direct) at 42-43; see also ETI Ex. 6 (Hadaway Direct) at Ex.

He tested the data by performing a\nregression analysis, which showed with high confidence that there is a trend in the relationship. It is\nan inverse trend, in which the risk premiums increase as bond yields decrease. On average, from\n1980 to 2011, risk premiums increased 0.4207 percent for every 1.00 percent that bond yields\n              248\ndecreased.\n\n\n          The calculation of the adjustment to the risk premium that the regression analysis indicated\nwas incorporated in Staffs analysis. The results of this risk premium analysis produced a cost of\nequity of 9.81 percent. 249\n\n\n          Mr. Gorman' s risk premium analysis produced an ROE estimate in the range of 9.2 percent to\n9 .4 percent, with a midpoint estimate of approximately 9 .3 percent. His risk premium model was\nbased on two estimates of an equity risk premium. First, he estimated the difference between the\nrequired return on utility common equity investments and U.S. Treasury bonds for the period 1986\nthrough 2011, which produced an equity risk premium of 5.23 percent. The second equity risk\npremium estimate was based on the difference between regulatory commission-authorized returns on\ncommon equity and contemporary \"A\" rated utility bond yields for the period 1986 through 2011,\nwhich produced an equity risk premium of 3.8 percent. Mr. Gorman testified that \"[t]he equity risk\npremium should reflect the relative market perception of risk in the utility industry today.\" 250\n\n\n\n\n247\n      Staff Ex. 6 (Cutter Direct) at 10, 19.\n248\n      Staff Ex. 6 (Cutter Direct) at 20.\n249\n      Id. at 20, Attachment SC-6.\n250\n      TIEC Ex. 2 Gorman Direct) at 26.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                               PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                          PAGE87\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nAccordingly, to gauge investor expectations he examined the yield spread between utility bonds and\nTreasury bonds over the last 32 years. 251\n\n\n           According to TIEC, this analysis showed that the current utility bond yield spreads over\nTreasury bond yields are lower than the 32-year average spreads, which is evidence that \"the market\nconsiders the utility industry to be a relatively low risk investment and demonstrates that utilities\ncontinue to have strong access to capital.\"252 Mr. Gorman then added a projected long-term Treasury\nbond yield to his estimated equity risk premium over Treasury yields, which produced a common\nequity in the range of 8.2 percent to 9.95 percent. Due to unusually large yield spreads between\nTreasury bond and \"Baa\" utility bond yields, Mr. Gorman gave two-thirds weight to his high end risk\npremium of 9.95 percent and one-third weight to his low-end risk premium of 8.2 percent, which\nproduced an equity risk premium of 9 .4 percent. He also added his equity risk premium over utility\nbond yields to the current 13-week average yield on \"Baa\" rated utility bonds for the period ending\nMarch 2, 2012, of 5.05 percent. Adding his equity risk premium of 3.03 percent to 4.62 percent to\nthe bond yield of 5 .05 percent, produced an ROE in the range of 8.08 percent to 9 .67 percent, which\nhe then weighted more heavily on the high end estimate to produce a recommendation of\n9 .2 percent. 253\n\n\n           The primary criticism that Dr. Hadaway lodged against Mr. Gorman' s risk premium analysis\nwas that Mr. Gorman did not adjust his analysis upward to reflect a purported inverse relationship\nbetween equity risk premiums and interest rates. 254 For example, Dr. Hadaway's risk premium\nanalysis adjusted his risk premium results by 1.56 percent to account for this relationship. 255\n\n\n           OPC witness Szerszen also performed a risk premium analysis, using Dr. Hadaway' s study of\nhistorical authorized electric company allowed returns on equity and average bond yields.

Giving more weight to the 2001-2010 risk premiums\nshown in Dr. Hadaway's exhibit results in an average risk premium of 4.21 percent. This yields an\n8.88 percent to 9.38 percent risk premium derived cost of equity based on the current 4.67 percent\nand projected 5.17 percent bond yields, according to Dr. Szerszen's analysis.2s 7\n\n\n           4. Comparable Earnings\n\n           Cities witness Parcell also performed a Comparable Earnings analysis. According to\nMr. Parcell, the Comparable Earnings method is derived from the \"corresponding risk\" standard of\nthe Bluefield and Hope cases. This method is thus based upon the economic concept of opportunity\ncost. The cost of capital is an opportunity cost: the prospective return available to investors from\nalternative investments of similar risk. 258\n\n\n           The Comparable Earnings method is designed to measure the returns expected to be earned\non the original cost book value of similar risk enterprises. Thus, according to Mr. Parcell, this\nmethod provides a direct measure of the fair return, because the Comparable Earnings method\ntranslates into practice the competitive principle upon which regulation is based. 259\n\n\n           The Comparable Earnings method normally examines the experienced and/or projected\nreturns on book common equity. The logic for examining returns on book equity follows from the\nuse of original-cost, rate-base regulation for public utilities, which uses a utility's book common\nequity to determine the cost of capital. This cost of capital is, in tum, used as the fair rate of return\nwhich is then applied (multiplied) to the book value of rate base to establish the dollar level of\n\n\n256\n      ETI Ex.

Mr. Parcell stated that this technique is thus consistent\nwith the rate base methodology used to set utility rates. 260\n\n\n            Mr. Parcell conducted the Comparable Earnings methodology by examining realized returns\non equity for several groups of companies and evaluating the investor acceptance of these returns by\nreference to the resulting market-to-book ratios. He testified that in this manner it is possible to\nassess the degree to which a given level of return equates to the cost of capital.\n\n\n            Mr. Parcell's Comparable Earnings analysis is based on market data (through the use of\nmarket-to-book ratios) and is thus essentially a market test. As a result, he testified that his analysis\nis not subject to the criticisms occasionally made by some who maintain that past earned returns do\nnot represent the cost of capital. In addition, he stated that his analysis uses prospective returns and\nthus is not confined to historical data. 261\n\n\n            Mr. Parcell' s Comparable Earnings analysis considered the experienced equity returns of the\nproxy groups of utilities for the period 1992-2011 (i.e., the last twenty years). His Comparable\nEarnings analysis required an examination of a relatively long period of time to determine trends in\nearnings over at least a full business cycle. Further, in estimating a fair level of return for a future\nperiod, it is important to examine earnings over a diverse period of time to avoid any undue influence\nfrom unusual conditions that may occur in a single year or shorter period. Therefore, in forming his\njudgment of the current cost of equity he focused on two periods: 2002-2011 (the recent business\ncycle) and 1992-2001 (the prior business cycle). 262\n\n\n            Based on the recent earnings and market-to-book ratios, Mr. Parcell' s Comparable Earnings\nanalysis indicated that the cost of equity for the proxy utilities is no more than 9.5 percent to\n10.0 percent (9.75 percent mid-point). Recent returns of 10.0 percent to 12.1 percent have resulted\nin market-to-book ratios of 143 and greater. Prospective returns of9.5percentto10.3 percent result\n\n\n260   Id.\n261\n      Cities Ex. 3 (Parcell Direct) at 29.\n262\n      Id. at 30.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                             PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                         PAGE90\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nin anticipated market-to-book ratios of over 125. As a result, it is apparent that returns below this\nlevel would result in market-to-book ratios of well above 100. According to Mr. Parcell, an ROE of\n9.5 percent to 10.0 percent should thus result in a market-to-book ratio of well over 100 .263\n\n\n          5. CAPM Analysis\n\n          The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a risk premium approach that estimates the ROE\nfor a given security as a function of a risk-free return plus a risk premium to compensate investors\nfor the non-diversifiable, or systematic, risk of that security. The CAPM formula is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nWhere Ke equals the required market ROE; f3 equals the Beta of an individual security; r1equals the\nrisk free rate of return; and rm equals the required return on the market as a whole. In this equation,\n(rm - r1) represents the market risk premium. According to the theory underlying the CAPM, because\ndiversifiable risk can be diversified away, investors should be concerned only with non-diversifiable\nrisk, which is measured by Beta. In effect, Beta represents the risk of the particular security relative\nto the market as a whole.\n\n\n          Only Staff witness Cutter, Cities witness Parcell, and State Agencies witness Miravete used\nthe CAPM methodology to estimate ETI's ROE.\n\n\n          Mr. Cutter used CAPM in the qualitative analysis of ETI' s cost of equity. He did not directly\nuse the CAPM in the determination of ETI' s cost of equity because it yielded a cost of equity that\nwas over 200 basis points lower than the lower of the other two estimates, while those other two\nestimates were less than half a percent apart from each other. 264 The CAPM provides an additional\nindication that a significant drop to the estimated costs of equity that Staff made in prior dockets is\n\n\n\n\n263\n      Cities Ex. 3 (Parcell Direct) at 31-32.\n264\n      Staff Ex. 6 (Cutter Direct) at 21.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE91\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nappropriate because the CAPM estimate is lower than either of the two other approaches even when\nadjusted for the current low yield on Treasury Bonds. 265\n\n\n            Mr. Cutter testified that the CAPM is one of the cornerstones of financial theory. 266 In its\nsimplest sense, the model describes the relationship between the risk of an asset and its expected\nreturn, and assumes that investors will not hold a risky asset unless they are adequately compensated\nfor the risk. 267\n\n\n            In this case, without any adjustment to the way it has been used in recent rate cases at the\nCommission, the CAPM yielded a cost of equity for ETI of 6.93 percent. Mr. Cutter testified that\naspects of the capital markets today were likely causing the CAPM's cost of equity estimate to be\nlow. Specifically, the Federal Reserve System is following an aggressive policy designed to keep the\nyields of both short-term and long-term Treasury bonds low. This policy influences two of the three\nvariables used in the CAPM formula to be lower, which, in tum, makes the CAPM's final estimate\nof ETI' s cost of equity lower. 268\n\n\n            To account for the impact of this aggressive Federal Reserve System policy, Mr. Cutter made\ntwo adjustments to his CAPM analysis. First, Mr. Cutter adjusted the risk-free rate variable in the\nCAPM because it is most influenced by current Federal Reserve System policy. By changing this\nvariable to 3.7 percent (which is the average yield from 1926 through 2010 of the risk-free rate's\nproxy security, U.S. Treasury Bills), the CAPM's estimate of ETI's cost of equity increased from\n6.93 percent to 7.92 percent, or by 99 basis points. 269\n\n\n            The second adjustment to the CAPM result that Mr. Cutter made to account for the current\naggressive Federal Reserve System policy was to the risk premium, which is also particularly\n\n\n265   Id.\n266   Id.\n261   Id.\n268\n      Staff Ex. 6 (Cutter Direct) at 21-24.\n269\n      Id. at 24.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE92\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nsensitive to Federal Reserve System policy. By using the difference between the averages of the\nyield of long-term government bonds and the yield of large company stocks between 1926and2010,\nthe effect of Federal Reserve System policy on the risk premium was significantly diluted.\nMr. Cutter found that because the CAPM estimate of ETI' s cost of equity was excessively low, even\nwith adjustments for Federal Reserve System policy, it would be appropriate to further adjust it by\nmultiplying the unadjusted estimate plus two times the effect of adjusting the risk-free rate, or:\n6.93 percent+ (2 * 0.99 percent)= 8.91 percent. 270 It is important to note, however, that Mr. Cutter\nused the CAPM analysis only as a qualitative check on its DCF and risk premium analyses, not as an\nindependent source of analysis.\n\n\n          Although Cities witness Parcell did perform a CAPM analysis, he does not employ the\nCAPM results in arriving at his 9.0 percent to 10.0 percent range of results. 271\n\n\n          State Agencies witness Miravete used the daily average of the yield of the ten-year Treasury\nbond between December 1, 2011, and March 2, 2012, as reported by the Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System, as his risk-free return in his CAPM model. He used Value Line's most\nrecent betas for the regulated utilities included in the proxy group. Dr. Miravete corrected the betas\nby substituting an average between their value and LO to recognize that markets trend towards\nlong-term equilibrium because these regulated utilities were able to attract investors during the most\ntroubled times, which indicates that the perceived market risk of these utilities is lower than for other\nfirms. Dr. Miravete's capitalization-weighted average CAPM ROE is 7.64 percent on a 90 days\naveraging period, with a range between 7.64 percent (30 days) and 8.28 percent (180 days).\nDr. Miravete characterizes these estimates as low relative to those of the DCF model because of the\nlow yields of Treasury bonds after the implementation of the quantitative easing monetary policy\nover the past two years. 272\n\n\n\n\n270\n      Id. at 21, 24-25.\n271\n      Cities Ex. 3 (Parcell Direct) at 3, 25-28.\n272\n      State Agencies Ex. 1 (Miravete Direct) at 19-21.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                     PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE93\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n       6. ALJs' Analysis\n\n       Given the detail, time, and effort that went into the various experts' testimony on this issue,\none might easily conclude that the development of an estimated ROE is a precise science. But, as\nacknowledged by virtually all experts on the subject, estimating the cost of equity is not an exact\nscience but rather a result of informed judgment.\n\n\n       The first question that must be addressed is the appropriate proxy group. There were\nessentially only two competing views on this issue- one presented by Dr. Hadaway and the other by\nMr. Cutter. The ALJs have reviewed the evidence and the arguments of both sides with respect to\nthe composition of the proxy group. Although Staff's proxy group could, in some respects, be\nconsidered more comparable to ETI than Dr. Hadaway' s larger group, the Al.J s do not believe that\nthis overcomes the flaws inherent in such a small group. In the end, a group of nine companies,\nwhile comparable, simply does not provide a robust enough sample to create a valid group for\ncomparison. The Al.J s therefore find that the 23 utility group selected by ETI witness Hadaway is\nthe appropriate proxy group.\n\n\n       The next issue is the core issue to be decided: the appropriate ROE for ETI. The experts in\nthis case testified to the following ROE ranges or estimates, depending on the calculation\nmethodology employed:\n\n\n           Witness/Analvsis                   Ranee           Ultimate Recommendation\n      Hadaway - DCF                       9.9 10.7                       10.6\n      Hadaway - Risk Premium              9.96 10.38\n                                                                                             -\n      Cutter-DCF                          7.46-10.71                        9.6\n      Cutter - Risk Premium               9.81\n      Cutter - CAPM                       8.91\n\n      Gorman-DCF                          9.3-9.7                           9.5\n      Gorman Risk Premium                 9.2-9.4\n\n      Parcell - DCF                       9.0 9.5                           9.5\n      Parcell - Comparable Earnings       9.5-10.0\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                             PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE94\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n               Witness/Analysis                   Ranee        Ultimate Recommendation\n         Szerszen - DCF                       8.32 9.32                   9.3\n         Szerszen - Risk Premium              9.3\n\n         Miravete - DCF                       9.23-9.34                     9.3\n         Miravete CAPM                        7.64- 8.28\n\nJust focusing on the ultimate ROE recommendations, it is clear that there is a fairly tightly grouped\nrange when considering Staff and the intervenors. This ranges from a low of 9 .3 percent to a high of\n9 .6 percent. The range expands when it is considered that Staff witness Cutter did not contest ETI' s\nassertion that Staffs DCF recommended ROE would be 10.0 percent if he had used the same proxy\ngroup as the other witnesses. 273 The ALls believe that the criticisms leveled at Dr. Hadaway's ROE\nrecommendation are generally correct, certainly to the point that the ultimate recommendation is so\nhigh as to be an outlier. The ALJ s conclude that the proper range of acceptable ROEs would be from\n9.3 percent to 10.0 percent. This is actually confirmed by ETI's own witness, Mr. Barrileaux, who\ntestified that, from a cash flow metric standpoint, an ROE of 9.99 percent would provide \"a\nreasonable outcome that balances debt and equity financing.\" 274\n\n\n          The mid-point of the range discussed above is 9.65 percent. There has been a tremendous\namount of testimony about the unsettled economic conditions facing utilities and the effect of those\nconditions on the appropriate ROE. The ALJs believe that this is an effect that must be taken into,\naccount, and that the effect would be to move the ultimate ROE towards the upper limits of the range\ndetermined to be reasonable. In this case, the ALJ s find that the reasonable adjustment would be\n15 basis points, moving the reasonable ROE to 9.80 percent. Accordingly, the ALls recommend that\nthe Commission find that 9.80 percent is the appropriate ROE for ETI.\n\n\n\n\n273\n      Tr. at 1795.\n274\n      ETI Ex. 44 (Barrileaux Rebuttal) at 5, Ex.

Cost of Debt\n\n          ETI' s weighted average cost of debt at the end of the test year was 6. 74 percent. 275 No party\nhas taken issue with that cost of debt. Therefore, the ALl s recommend that the Commission enter an\norder finding that the appropriate cost of debt for ETI is 6.74 percent.\n\n\nD.        Overall Rate of Return\n\n          The overall rate of return is a product of the capital structure, ROE, and cost of debt. Based\non the discussions set forth above, the ALls recommend that the Commission adopt the following\noverall rate of return for ETI:\n\n\n                                                                                    Weighted\n           Component                    Cost                   Weif!htin2            Cost\n          Debt                          6.74                     50.08%                3.38\n          Equity                        9.80                     49.92%                4.89\n          Overall                                                                      8.27\n\n  VII.

Purchased Power Capacity Expense [Germane to Supplemental Preliminary Order\n          Issue No.1]\n\n          One of the most hotly contested issues in this case concerned the appropriate size of ETI' s\npurchased power capacity costs (PPCCs). In order to understand this issue, it is necessary to\nunderstand some background relative to how ETI obtains and uses power generation capacity.\n\n\n          1. The Sources of ETI's Purchased Power\n\n          The Entergy System Agreement is a FERC-approved tariff that mandates that the Operating\nCompanies operate as a single, integrated system. 276 The System Agreement's essential function is\nto provide the contractual basis for the planning, construction, and operation of generation and\n\n275\n      ETI Ex. 5 (Barrilleaux Direct) at 37.\n276\n      ETI Ex. 30 (Jaycox Direct) at 5-6; ETI Ex. 39 (Cicio Direct) at 6-10.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE96\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ntransmission resources in an economic and reliable manner. By jointly planning and operating their\nelectric systems, the Operating Companies believe they are able to aggregate their loads and jointly\ndispatch their resources to serve that load using the lowest cost resources available from all of the\nOperating Companies, resulting in lower total costs than the total cost of each Operating Company\nplanning and operating separately. Another function of the Entergy System Agreement is to provide\na basis for the equalization among the Operating Companies of any imbalances of costs arising from\nthe construction, ownership, or operation of facilities that are used for the collective benefit of all\nEntergy Operating Companies. 277\n\n\n          To provide reliable service, ETI must have sufficient generation capacity to meet the\nmaximum demands imposed on its system. Some of this generation capacity (approximately\n1,200 MW) is generating plants owned and operated by ETI. 278 The remainder of ETI' s capacity\ncomes from four types of purchased capacity: (1) capacity purchases from third parties; (2) capacity\npurchases from other Entergy affiliates through \"legacy affiliate contracts\" under MSS-4;\n(3) capacity purchases from other Entergy affiliates through \"other affiliate contracts\" under MSS-4;\nand (4) capacity purchases from the Entergy system through reserve equalization payments under\nMSS-1. 279 MSS-1 and MSS-4 are schedules included in the Entergy System Agreement which set\nout complex mathematical formulas whereby the various Operating Companies can equalize and\nshare the costs of power capacity among themselves. 280 These four sources of purchased capacity are\ninversely related to one another: the more ETI purchases from one source, the less it needs to\npurchase from the others. 281\n\n               ~   Capacity Purchases from Third Parties\n\n          Third-party capacity contracts are contracts that the system has allocated in whole or part to\nETI.      ETI has contracted to purchase capacity from a number of third parties, including\n\n277\n      ETI Ex. 39 (Cicio Direct) at 6, 8-10, 11-30.\n278\n      Tr. at 1539-40.\n279\n      ETI Ex. 34 (Cooper Direct) at 20-21; Tr. at 1901; ETI Initial Brief at 71.\n280\n      ETI Ex. 39 (Cicio Direct) at PJC-1, pp. 30 and 62.\n281\n      Tr. at 1946-47.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE97\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nConocoPhillips-SRW, Dow Pipeline, Frontier, Calpine-Carville, and Sam Rayburn Municipal Power\nAgency (SRMPA). Since 2009, ETI has been in the process of substantially increasing its reliance\nupon third party purchases of capacity. During the Rate Year, it plans to more than double the\namount of capacity it purchases from third parties as compared to the amount it purchased during the\n               282\nTest Year.\n\n\n            Since the Test Year, Entergy has been engaged in an effort to increase ETI's long-term power\ncapacity through dealing with third parties. It has entered into a number of agreements in that regard:\n\n\n•      In 2009, it entered into a ten-year purchased power agreement with Calpine Energy Services\n       (Calpine) to purchase 485 MW of capacity from Calpine's Carville Energy Center (Carville\n       Contract). Purchases pursuant to the Carville Contract will commence during the Rate Year, on\n       June 1, 2012, and 50 percent of this contract is allocated to ETI. 283\n\n•      During the Period from July 2009 through June 2011, the Company executed an agreement with\n       NRG for a 75 MW one-year call option, with a delivery period that began on March 1, 2011, and\n       100 percent of this contract is allocated to ETI. 284\n\n•      During the Period from July 2009 through June 2011, the Company executed a three-year\n       agreement with Dow Pipeline for 100 MW capacity, with a delivery period that began on April 1,\n       2011, and 100 percent of this contract is allocated to ETI. 285\n\n•      During the Period from July 2009 through June 2011, the Company executed a 25-year\n       agreement with SRMPA for 225 MW, with a delivery period beginning on December 1, 2011,\n       and 100 percent of this contract is allocated to ETI. ETI contends that the SRMPA contract will\n       be beneficial because it provides \"much-needed long-term base load capacity at an economically\n       attractive price.\"286\n\n\n\n\n282\n      ETI Ex. 34 (Cooper Direct) at 23; see also ETI Init.

The legacy affiliate purchases are made under\nMSS-4. 290\n\n\n               »     Capacity Purchases from Other Entergy Affiliates Through \"Other\" Affiliate\n                     Contracts Under MSS-4\n\n           \"Other affiliate contracts\" refers to all affiliate contracts other than legacy contracts whereby\nETI purchases capacity and associated energy from other Operating Companies. 291 The other\naffiliate purchases are also made under MSS-4. 292 Among others, in 2009 ETI entered into a new\naffiliate contract with Entergy Arkansas, Inc. (EAI) for wholesale base load resources (the EA WBL\nContract), whereby ETI was allocated 31. 7 percent of 336 MW capacity. 293\n\n\n\n287\n      Tr. 1937-38.\n288\n      ETI Ex. 34 (Cooper Direct) at 24.\n289\n      Tr. at 1112-13, 1940-41.\n290\n      ETI Ex. 39 (Cicio Direct) at 24-26.\n291\n      ETI Ex. 34 (Cooper Direct) at 21.\n292\n      ETI Ex. 39 (Cicio Direct) at 24-26.\n293\n      Cities Ex. 6 (Nalepa Direct) at 13-14.\n\f                                                                                                     ..~-·-----\n\n\n\n\nSOAH DOCKET N O . -                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE99\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n              ~   Capacity Purchases from the Entergy System Through Reserve EqualizaJion\n                  Payments Under MSS-1\n\n          Reserve Equalization payments are made under MSS-1. In any given month, some of the\nOperating Companies might be \"long\" on the amount of generating capacity they own (meaning that\nthey own more capacity than they need) while others might be \"short\" on capacity (meaning they\nown less capacity than they need). In such a month, the long Operating Companies would receive\n                                                                                      294\nMSS-1 payments from the short Operating Companies for use of their capacity.\n\n\n          2. ETl's Request Regarding PPCCs\n\n          During the Test Year, ETI had total PPCCs of $245,432,884. 295 In the application, however,\nETI is not seeking to recover its Test Year expenses. Rather, it is asking to recover roughly\n$276 million, which represents the Company's anticipated PPCCs in the Rate Year. 296 In other\nwords, ETI is seeking roughly $31 million more than its actual Test Year expenses.

Moreover, while the purchases pursuant to MSS-4 will remain fairly stable, the\nthird-party purchases will substantially increase, with a somewhat corresponding decrease for\npurchases pursuant to MSS-1. In other word, ETI' s plan is to become \"less short\" (on capacity)\nrelative to the other Operating Companies in the Rate Year than it was in the Test Year.\n\n\n          ETI contends that the shift toward more third party purchases is part of its effort to develop a\nmore diverse, modern, and efficient portfolio of generation supply resources, both to serve current\ncustomer needs and to serve anticipated load growth. This, in turn, will lower energy costs and result\nin savings for customers. 301\n\n\n\n\n299\n      Cities Ex. 12.\n300\n      Cities now agree that the correct amount for the Test Year is $245,432,884.

Staff and Intervenors' Opposition to ETl's PPCCs Proposal\n\n           Staff and all of the active! y-engaged intervenors oppose ETI' s proposed adjustment to its Test\nYear PPCCs. They make a number of arguments against ETI' s proposal.\n\n\n                         (a) The PPCCs Requested by ETI Are Not Known and Measurable\n\n           First, they contend that ETI' s Rate Year forecast cannot be considered known or measurable.\nStaff points out that the four3° 5 components from which ETI purchases power are interrelated, such\nthat, \"when ETI adds capacity under one element, such as through third party contracts, the other\ncomponents, such as ETI's MSS-1 payments, will decrease.\"306 Staff describes each of the\ncomponents comprising ETI' s PPCC Rate Year forecast as being \"infected\" with numerous\nassumptions. 307 For example, ETI necessarily made projections, rather than relying upon actual\npayments, when it estimated what it will pay for third-party contracts in the Rate Year. 308 Many of\n\n302\n      Tr. at 1954; Cities Ex. 4 (Goins Direct) at 14.\n303\n      TIEC Init.

Nevertheless, ETI simply assumed it would pay the maximum amount possible under\neach of its third party contracts, and disregarded any of the contractual factors that might reduce its\nRate Year payments. 309 Thus, the intervenors contend that ETI's cost estimates for third party\npurchased power are merely projections, as opposed to known and measurable changes. 310\n\n\n           Similarly, ETI' s contractual agreements with its affiliate Operating Companies require ETI to\nmake assumptions about their future costs. The contracts do not definitively fix prices or quantities.\nRather, prices and quantities under the contracts will fluctuate based on the specific operational\nconditions actually experienced by the various Operating Companies during the Rate Year. 311 The\nultimate determination of payments made in the Rate Year will be calculated based upon the\ncomplex mathematical formula set out in schedule MSS-4. That formula contains a great number of\nvariables. ETI had to make assumptions about each one of those variables in order to estimate its\nRate Year costs. 312 The intervenors point to ETI' s new contract with EAi (the EA WBL Contract) as\nevidence of the \"inherently speculative nature\" of ETI' s PPCCs request.              According to the\nintervenors:\n\n\n•      the EA WBL Contract was signed on April 11, 2012 (only days before the hearing in this matter\n       commenced); purchases will not commence under the contract until January 1, 2013;\n\n•      pricing under the contract will be determined in 2013 pursuant to the complex formula contained\n       inMSS-4;\n\n•      the quantity of capacity ETI ultimately purchases under the contract will be based on a yet-to-be-\n       determined allocation percentage between ETI and the other Operating Companies;\n\n•      the contract itself may never go into effect because it is contingent upon ETI receiving all\n       necessary \"regulatory approvals\" before August 1, 2012; and\n\n\n309\n      Tr. at 704-05.\n310\n      TIEC Initial Brief at 29-30; Staff Initial Brief at 26.\n311\n      Tr. at 606.\n312\n      See Staff Initial Brief at 27; Tr. 606.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE103\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n•     if it does go into effect, it will still be subject to at least two further revisions before any power is\n      received by ETI under the contract. 313\n\n\nThe EA WBL Contract accounts for more than one-third of ETI' s upward adjustment to its Test Year\nPPCCs. The intervenors contend that, in order for ETI to arrive at its forecasted PPCCs for the Rate\nYear, it had to make myriad assumptions as to the future values of the many variables in the EA\nWBL Contract (and the other affiliate contracts). 314 Therefore, the intervenors argue that ETI' s cost\nestimates for its contractual agreements with its affiliate Operating Companies are merely\nprojections, as opposed to known and measurable changes. 315\n\n\n          ETI' s estimated costs for its MSS-1 payments also require assumptions about the future. In\norder to calculate its future reserve equalization responsibilities using the complex formula set out in\nMSS-1, ETI had to forecast its own future loads, along with the future loads of all the other\nOperating Companies. If those assumptions prove to be wrong, then ETI' s actual MSS-1 costs will\nbe different than as projected in the application. 316 It is noteworthy, according to the intervenors, that\nETI projected the future load growths of all the Operating Companies when it calculated its projected\nRate Year MSS-1 costs because, elsewhere in ETI' s evidence, the Company has taken the position\nthat future projected loads should not be considered known and measurable. 317 Staff argues:\n\n\n          ETI cannot have it both ways. It cannot claim load growth to be speculative in one\n          context, and then claim that it can forecast with absolute certainty the respective load\n          growths for each EOC on the Entergy System. 318\n\nTIEC points out that ETI' s estimated MSS-1 payments \"were still changing on the eve of the\nhearing.\"319 In the following exchange, even ETI witness Phillip May, one of the Company's\n\n\n313\n      ETI Ex. 47 (Cooper Rebuttal) at RRC-R-1, and Tr. at 628-9.\n314\n   Staff Initial Brief at 27-28. Staff makes the further point that, because the EA WBL Contract was executed\nonly days before the hearing, Staff has been unable to determine whether the contract is even a prudent one.\n315\n      TIEC Initial Brief at 30-32; Staff Initial Brief at 27-28.\n316\n      Tr. at 651-52.\n317\n      Tr. at 1907; see also Staff Initial Brief at 28; TIEC Initial Brief at 27-28.\n318\n      Staff Initial Brief at 29; see also TIEC Initial Brief at 37.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                              PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                      PAGE 104\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nprimary witnesses regarding its PPCCs, seems to have conceded that the Company's MSS-1\nprojections are not known and measurable:\n\n\n           Q:       Do you think that the projection ... of rate year sales that is implicit in the\n                    calculation of MSS-1 costs ... is a known and measurable change?\n           A:       I think that there is some uncertainty with regard to that projection, yes, sir. 320\n\nIn sum, the intervenors contend that ETI' s cost estimates for all components of purchased power in\nthe Rate Year are merely projections, as opposed to known and measurable changes. 321\n\n\n                         (b) The PPCCs Requested by ETI Violate the Matching Principle\n\n           Second, the intervenors acknowledge the principle that Test Year expenses may be adjusted\nfor known and measurable changes. However, they contend that such adjustments can only be made\nwhere the attendant impacts on all aspects of a utility's operations (including revenue, expenses, and\ninvested capital) can with reasonable certainty be identified, quantified, and matched.322 They assert\nthat ETI' s proposed adjustment does not satisfy this matching principle. The intervenors complain\nthat ETI is improperly attempting to \"compare apples to oranges\" by mixing a forecast of future Rate\nYear PPCCs with actual Test Year billing determinants. As explained by Cities witness Nalepa,\n\"[u]nder the company's approach of mixing estimated rate year costs with test year billing units,\nthere is a failure to recognize customer growth and increased sales revenue - thus overstating the\nrevenue requirement.\"323 The argument, essentially, is that the various new or expanded contracts\nthat ETI has entered into were executed so that, in whole or in part, ETI would be able to meet future\ndemand, but that ETI is seeking to recover the costs of those new contracts from its existing\ncustomers. 324\n\n\n\n319\n      TIEC Initial Brief at 28.\n320\n      Tr. at 1918-19.\n321\n      TIEC Initial Brief at 27-28; Staff Initial Brief at 29.\n322\n      Cities Ex. 6 (Nalepa Direct) at 12, citing P.U.C.

Assume that, during the Test Year, Utility X had 100 billing units and $500 of PPCCs. Also\nassume that, during the Rate Year, Utility X had 200 billing units and $1,000 of PPCCs. If Utility X\nwere limited to setting its rates based solely on its Test Year numbers, then it would recover\nprecisely the right amount to cover its PPCCs in both the Test Year (100 billing units x $5 per unit=\n$500 of PPCCs) and in the Rate Year(200 billing units x $5 per unit= $1,000 of PPCCs). If, on the\nother hand, Utility X were allowed to set its rates based upon it billing units from the Test Year(lOO)\nand its PPCCs from the Rate Year ($1,000), then Utility X would unfairly recover twice the amount\nneeded to cover its actual PPCCs in the Rate Year (200 billing units x $10 per unit= $2,000). 325\nThus, intervenors contend that ETI' s load growth must be taken into account if PPCCs are to be\nbased on Rate Year projections. 326 They point out that ETI itself expects steady load growth in the\nnext few years, 327 and experienced \"good\" growth over the two years preceding the Test Year. 328\n\n\n           For its part, ETI denies that its increased capacity has been obtained in order to meet load\ngrowth. Rather, it contends that it has added capacity in order to be \"less short\" in comparison to the\nother Operating Companies. 329 Moreover, ETI contends that the load growth adjustments proposed\nby intervenors are \"uncertain and unnecessary.\" 330\n\n\n                       (c) ETl's Proposal Would Preclude Prudence Review\n\n           Third, TIEC contends that ETI' s future Rate Year proposal would set rates based on\nprojections without any effective Commission review of: (1) what the actual expenditures under\n\n\n\nBrief at 35-39.\n325\n      Cities Ex. 4 (Goins Direct) at 16-17.\n326\n      Cities Ex. 4 (Goins Direct) at 17; see also TIEC Ex. 23.\n327\n      Cities Ex. 4 (Goins Direct) at 17; Tr. at 706.\n328\n      Tr. at 130.\n329\n      ETI Initial Brief at 68-69.\n330\n      Id. at 69.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE106\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\npurchased capacity contracts turn out to be; (2) whether those expenditures turn out to be reasonable;\nand (3) whether the future contracts were prudent. 331\n\n\n          4. The Intervenors' Recommendations Regarding PPCCs\n\n          The intervenors agree that the amount requested by ETI is unreasonable, excessive, and\nshould be rejected. They do not universally agree, however, about what the proper number for\nPPCCs should be. Staff, TIEC, and State Agencies argue that ETI' s PPCCs should be set at the\namount of the Company's Test Year PPCCs: $245.4 million. This position is best summarized by\nStaff:\n\n\n          Staff recommends that the Commission adhere to traditional ratemaking principles\n          and set the amount of ETI' s purchased power expenses based on what the Company\n          actually experienced during its test year. During its test year, ETI had total purchased\n          power capacity expenses of $245.4 million. This amount is not in dispute. This\n          amount is known. This amount is measurable. The Commission should utilize this\n          amount to set just and reasonable rates for ETI and its ratepayers. 332\n\n           Rather than recommending Test Year PPCCs, Cities offer two alternatives - one\nrecommended by its witness Dr. Dennis Goins, and another recommended by its witness\nMr. Nalepa. 333       Dr. Goins recommends that ETI be allowed to recover PPCCs of roughly\n$242.9 million. 334 This amount is roughly $33 million less than ETI's requested amount and\n$3 million less than ETI' s actual Test Year costs. To arrive at this amount, Dr. Goins made several\ncalculations. First, he adjusted the average perkW cost of ETI' s legacy and other affiliate purchases\nusing cost data from November 2010 through October 2011, which is slightly more current data than\nthat relied upon by ETI. 335 Second, as to MSS-4 costs, because the EA WBL contract is set to expire\nsooner than the three years he assumed ETI' s new rates will be in effect, Dr. Goins \"normalized\" the\n\n\n\n331\n      TIEC Initial Brief at 33-35.\n332\n      Staff Initial Brief at 29.\n333\n      Cities Initial Brief at 40.\n334\n      Cities Ex. 6 (Nalepa Direct) at 17, and Errata No. 3.\n335\n      Cities Ex. 4 (Goins Direct) at 17-18.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                              PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                       PAGE107\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ncosts of the EA WBL contract over the three year period. 336 Finally, he adjusted the Rate Year total\nPPCCs estimate to reflect the effects of load growth, based upon ETI forecasts. 337\n\n\n           Mr. Nalepa took a slightly different approach. He recommended that ETI be allowed to\nrecover PPCCs of $236,838,634, or roughly $39 million less than ETI' s requested amount and\n$8 million less than ETI's Test Year costs. 338 To arrive at this amount, Mr. Nalepa first calculated\nthe per kW cost of ETI's third party Rate Year capacity and applied it to ETI's Test Year-end\ncapacity. In this way, \"the increased cost of the new resources is recognized, but current demand is\nbetter matched to current resources.\"339 Second, he made the same adjustment as Dr. Goins as to\nMSS-4 costs due to the EA WBL contract. 340\n\n\n           TIEC explains it is reluctant to \"descend into the rabbit hole and engage in ratemaking based\non prognostications, estimates, projections, and assumptions about what may happen in the\nfuture.\" 341 If the Commission were to do so, however, TIEC argues that the final result would be\nlower than the Test Year PPCCs, not higher. TIEC' s witness Jeffry Pollock calculated the impact of\nprojected unit prices based upon ETI' s projections, and he eliminated the expiring EA WBL\nContract. His result, which TIEC is not advocating, would allow ETI to recover PPCCs of $238.8\nmillion, roughly $7 million less than its Test Year costs. 342\n\n\n           ETI describes the proposals made by TIEC and Cities as \"extreme\" and contrary to common\nsense. 343 For example, Mr. Pollock's calculations indicate that ETI' s MSS-1 costs would increase by\nroughly $5 million, while its third-party and affiliate contracts would slightly decrease. ETI argues\n\n\n336\n       Cities Ex. 4 (Goins Direct) at 18; Cities Ex. 6 (Nalepa Direct) at 15-16.\n337\n       Cities Ex. 4 (Goins Direct) at 18- l 9.\n338\n       Cities Ex. 6 (Nalepa Direct) at 17.\n339\n       Cities Ex. 6 (Nalepa Direct) at 12-13.\n3\n 4-0   Id. at 15-16.\n341\n       TIEC Initial Brief at 41.\n342\n       TIEC Ex. 1 (Pollack Direct) at 25-27; TIEC Initial Brief at 41-42.\n343\n       ETI Initial Brief at 83.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                             PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                 PAGE 108\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nthat this is the opposite of reality. By adding capacity through third party contracts, its reliance upon\nthe other purchased power components, especially MSS-1, will necessarily decline, not increase. 344\nETI also argues that load growth is inherently uncertain and should not be taken into account. 345\n\n\n          5. The ALJs' Analysis Regarding PPCCs\n\n          The AU s conclude that ETI failed to meet its burden to prove that the adjustment it seeks to\nits Test Year PPCCs is known and measurable. The known and measurable standard is an exception\nto the actual data contained in the Test Year. The point of a historical Test Year is to review actual\ncosts, which include the ups and downs of what actually occurred. As to a forecast of the Rate Year,\nby contrast, the evidence demonstrates that the costs attributable to a particular contract to purchase\ncapacity cannot currently be known because there are so many variables that will play into the\namount ETI ultimately pays. As stated above, ETI' s third party contracts lack fixed prices and the\namounts ETI will pay could fluctuate based upon factors such as required availability and\nperformance. ETI simply assumed it would pay the maximum amounts under those contracts, and\ndisregarded the contractual factors that could lower the payment amounts. Yet this assumption runs\ncounter to ETI' s historical experience with its contracts. 346 Similarly, ETI' s affiliate contracts do not\nfix prices or quantities, and the amount ETI ultimately pays will fluctuate based upon operational\nconditions experienced by all of the Operating Companies during the Rate Year. Those operational\nconditions obviously cannot be known at this time. Both the affiliate contracts under MSS-4 and the\nequalization payments under MSS-1 are based upon highly complex mathematical formulae that\nutilize numerous variables. Any of the variables could change during the Rate Year, thereby altering\nthe amounts paid by ETI under affiliate contracts or MSS-1. As a result, the evidence demonstrates\nthat there could be a substantial difference between ETI' s projected Rate Year costs and what\n\n\n\n\n344\n      Id. 83.\n345\n      Id. 84.\n346\n      Tr. at 705.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                          PAGE 109\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nactually ends up occurring. ETI asks the Commission to trust it that these differences would be\n\"small,\"347 but provides no evidence as to what small means.\n\n\n          The efforts made by ETI, Cities, and TIEC to forecast Rate Year PPCCs further illustrate the\ndifficulty of deviating from actual Test Year data in an area that involves so many future\ncontingencies and unknowns. Those forecasts swung wildly- ETI estimated Rate Year PPCCs that\nwere $31 million more than the Test Year, while the Cities' and TIEC's estimates came in at $3\nmillion, $8 million, and $7 million less than the Test Year, respectively. Indeed, even Cities' own\nwitnesses disagreed substantially among themselves as to what the proper amount should be.\nMoreover, arguably ETI could not even agree with itself regarding the proper amount because, in its\nInitial Brief, it suggested that a reduction of roughly $4.5 million might be warranted to account for\nits latest projection of its MSS-1 costs in the Rate Year. 348\n\n\n          The ALls are similarly convinced that ETI's request violated the matching principle by\nmixing its forecast of future Rate Year PPCCs with Test Year billing determinants. It is logically\ninconsistent for ETI to have, on the one hand, based its estimate of Rate Year MSS-1 costs on its\nprojections of the load growths of ETI and all the other Operating Companies and, on the other hand,\nargue that load growth cannot be considered known and measurable when calculating its overall\nPPCCs. This argument does not withstand scrutiny, especially in light of tJ:ie fact that ETI clearly\nbelieves its load will be larger in the Rate Year than it was in the Test Year and it has, in fact,\ncontracted for six percent more load in the Rate Year. 349\n\n\n          Simply put, the intervenors presented substantial evidence that all of the components of ETI' s\npurchased power capacity contain significant variability and uncertainty in costs, thereby leading to\nthe conclusion that estimates of Rate Year PPCCs cannot be considered known and measurable. For\nthis reason, the ALls recommend that ETI's PPCCs request be rejected. In its place, the ALls\nrecommend that ETI be allowed to recover its Test Year PPCCs of $245,432,884.\n\n347\n      ETIInitial Brief at 81.\n348\n      ETI Initial Brief at 77 (citing Tr. at 684, 1945).\n349\n      ETI Ex. 47 (Cooper Rebuttal) at 4; Tr. at 667-68.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE 110\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nB.         Transmission Equalization (MSS-2) Expense\n\n           The Entergy system transmission grid is a large, integrated transmission network that is\noperated for the mutual benefit of all of the Entergy Operating Companies. 350                Service\nSchedule MSS-2 is a FERC jurisdictional tariff that equalizes the ownership costs of certain high\nvoltage transmission facilities among ETI and the other Operating Companies, so that each\nOperating Company pays its just and reasonable share of those costs. Accordingly, those costs are\nreferred to as \"transmission equalization\" payments. 351 MSS-2 generally applies to equalization of\ntransmission costs for transmission assets of 230 kV and larger. 352\n\n\n           In any given month, some of the Operating Companies might be \"long\" on the amount of\ntransmission capacity they own (meaning that they own more capacity than they need) while others\nmight be \"short\" on capacity (meaning they own less capacity than they need). In such a month, the\nlong Operating Companies would receive MSS-2 payments from the short Operating Companies for\nuse of their transmission facilities. 353 Over the course of the Test Year, ETI was short, meaning that\nit paid a total of $1,753,797 in MSS-2 payments to various other Operating Companies. 354\n\n\n           In the application, rather than seeking to recover only the $1.7 million in Test Year MSS-2\ncosts, ETI is seeking to recover roughly $10.7 million, which represents its anticipated MSS-2\nexpenses in the Rate Year. 355 The additional $9 million that ETI seeks is based on the Company's\nestimates of transmission construction projects that are expected to have been completed by or\nduring the Rate Year which will result in changes to the relative transmission line ownership ratios\nbetween the Operating Companies. In other words, ETI expects that, by or during the Rate Year, its\nownership share under the MSS-2 will decrease relative to the other Operating Companies (as the\n\n\n350\n      Tr. at 450, 793.\n351\n      Tr. at 724; ETI Ex. 39 (Cicio Direct) at 15-17 and PJC-1at38.\n352\n      Tr. at 450-51, 73 l.\n353\n      Tr. at 731, 735.\n354\n      Tr. at 723-24, 737; Cities Ex. 28.\n355\n      Tr. at 452-53, 738, 760.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE Ill\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ntransmission capacity owned by the other Operating Companies increases), thereby driving the\namount of ETI's MSS-2 payments upward. 356\n\n\n            The increase is driven by ETI's prediction that $184.9 million in additional transmission\ncapacity will be built by other Operating Companies by the end of the Rate Year. ETI identified six\nconstruction projects that are either underway or approved for construction and which, collectively,\nwill account for roughly $141 million of the predicted $184.9 million in additional transmission\ncapacity. Of those six projects, one was completed and went into service on December 16, 2011,\nafter the end of the Test Year. The other five are either under construction or still in the planning\nphase and are currently scheduled to go into service on dates ranging from June 29, 2012, to\nDecember 31, 2012. 357 According to ETI, the remaining $43.9 million of the $184.9 million in\nadditional transmission capacity is derived from \"an estimate of the capital investment necessary to\nmaintain equalizable [i.e. MSS-2 qualifying] transmission investments across the Entergy\nTransmission System.\"358 The estimate is based upon the Operating Company's projected budgets\nand historical spending patterns for maintenance of transmission facilities. 359\n\n\n            Staff, State Agencies, TIEC, and Cities all oppose ETI's effort to recover $10.7 million in\nMSS-2 expenses. The parties make a number of arguments. First, they point out that MSS-2 utilizes\na complex mathematical formula to calculate each Operating Company's liability (or credit) under\nthe equalization process. There are a great number of variables that are used in the formula, such as\nthe amount of investments made by each Operating Company in transmission facilities, the costs of\ncapital for each Operating Company, the size of the load demanded by each Operating Company, and\nthe amount of state and federal taxes paid by each Operating Company. Changes to any of these\nvariables can change the amount ETI owes (or is due) pursuant to MSS-2. 360 Moreover, these\nvariables relate not only to ETI, but to all of the Operating Companies. Indeed, Cities calculate that,\n\n356\n      Tr. at 775-77.\n357\n      ETI Ex. 59 (McCulla Rebuttal) at 2 and MFM-R-1; Tr. at 456-58.\n358\n      ETI Ex. 59 (McCulla Rebuttal) at 3.\n359   Id.\n360\n      ETI Ex. 39 (Cicio Direct) at PJC-1 at 38-43; Tr. at 454-55.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                      PAGE 112\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nto perform the MSS-2 calculation, at least 360 \"mini-forecasts\" must be made, only 60 of which\nrelate to ETI. 361 As explained by TIEC witness Pollock, any effort to estimate future amounts of\nthese many variables \"is susceptible to a host of uncertainties.\" 362 The intervenors argue that for ETI\nto arrive at its estimate of$10.7 inMSS-2 costs duringthe Rate Year, the Company had to speculate\nas to what the many MSS-2 variables would be in the Rate Year. In other words, they contend that\nETI's estimate of its future MSS-2 costs cannot possibly be considered \"known and measurable\"\nand, therefore, is not recoverable. 363 State Agencies and Staff liken ETI's attempt to obtain an\nMSS-2 adjustment for not-yet-complete construction projects to an impermissible request to recover\nthe costs of CWIP without having to meet PURA's burden of proving that recovery is necessary to\nprotect the utilities financial integrity. 364\n\n\n           Second, the parties oppose ETI's effort to recover its predicted MSS-2 expense in the Rate\nYear point out that the primary driver of the increased costs over the Test Year comes from a number\nof transmission projects that have not yet come into service, and are still in the planning or\nconstruction phase. ETI concedes that if the projects do not actually come into service at the\ncurrently estimated times, then the Company's estimates of its MSS-2 costs during the Rate Year\nwill be inaccurate. 365 Thus, Staff contends that ETI's projections about future MSS-2 costs cannot\nbe considered known and measurable. 366 Moreover, TIEC and Staff contend that ETI is effectively\nseeking higher rates based upon expenses associated with projects that are not yet completed and,\ntherefore, the projects cannot be considered ''used and useful.\"367 As explained by TIEC:\n\n\n\n\n361\n      Cities Reply Br. at 68-69.\n362\n      TIEC Ex. 1 (Pollock Direct) at 29.\n363\n   Staff Initial Brief at 31; State Agencies Initial Brief at 11-13; TIEC Initial Brief at 44-45; Cities Initial Brief\nat44.\n364\n   State Agencies Initial Briefat 12 (citing PURA§ 36.054; P.U.C.

For this reason, the Commission\n          has typically followed the policy that proper ratemaking requires that a utility actually\n          build the transmission infrastructure suggested by its projections, and then seek to\n          account for that investment on a historical basis in a future rate case. In Docket\n          No. 28906, for example, the Commission held that LCRA' s projections of future\n          transmission investment did not support a finding that its projected capital needs\n          satisfied the known and measurable test. It is similarly unreasonable for ETI to make\n          a post-test year adjustment associated with transmission projects that are not serving\n          any of its customers and that may or may not impact ETI' s transmission equalization\n          expense, depending on when the projects are finally completed. 368\n\n          Third, in addition to the six transmission projects that are under development, another driver\nof the increased costs over the Test Year comes from ETI' s estimate that $43 .9 million will be spent\nto maintain transmission investments across the Entergy Transmission System. The intervenors\ncontend that ETI has provided little to no evidentiary support for this estimate. State Agencies and\nCities also point out the unfairness of allowing ETI to begin recovering $10. 7 million per year in its\nrates immediately based upon new transmission facilities, even though many of those new facilities\nwill not come into service (and ETI will therefore not incur higher MSS-2 payments for those\nfacilities) for many months. 369\n\n\n          Fourth, Cities points out that Entergy and the various Operating Companies have announced\na plan to sell all of their transmission assets to a third party. That process is currently underway. The\nevidence suggests that, if and when that transaction is complete, ETI's MSS-2 expenses will\ndisappear. 370\n\n\n          Finally, TIEC argues that there is no need to grant ETI's request for a pro Jonna adjustment\nto its test year MSS-2 expenses because the Company can avail itself of a TCRF if its Rate Year\n\n368\n      TIEC Initial Brief at 47 (citing Docket No. 28906, Order at 6).\n369\n      State Agencies Initial Brief at 12; Cities Initial Brief at 45.\n °\n37\n     Cities Reply Brief at 67-68; Tr. at 113-14; Cities Ex. 4 (Goins Direct) at 20-21. Admittedly, if these\nexpenses disappear, ETI will still have to bear transmission expenses. However, it is impossible to know, at\nthis time, what those expenses would be.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                    PAGE 114\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ncosts deviate substantially from its Test Year costs. Thus, if it turns out that ETI experiences an\nincrease in its MSS-2 expenses during the Rate Year, the utility has cost recovery mechanisms at its\ndisposal that could make it whole in a timely manner.\n\n\n           Staff and State Agencies argue that only $1.7 million (representing ETI's actual Test Year\nexpenses) should be approved in this proceeding. TIEC witness Pollock recommends approving a\nslight upward adjustment to account for the fact that ETI's MSS-2 expenses were substantially\nhigher in the second six months of the Test Year than they were in the first six months. Mr. Pollock\nand TIEC recommend a pro Jonna adjustment equal to twice the amount of MSS-2 payments\n                                                                                       371\nincurred by ETI in the second six months of the Test Year, or $2. 7 million.\n\n\n           Cities' witness Goins presented yet another alternative. Dr. Goins proposes to adjust the\nprojected Rate Year costs for known expenses incurred after the Test Year. He proposed reducing\nthe adjusted Rate Year MSS-2 expense to a Test Year level by applying a load growth adjustment\nusing ETI' s own projected load growth as a benchmark indicator of the reasonable anticipated level\nof growth. (Cities invoke essentially the same \"matching principle\" argument regarding load growth\nthat they raised with respect to PPCCs). The result of Dr. Goins' adjustment would be to would\nallow ETI to recover $4,103,850 in MSS-2 expenses. 372\n\n\n           ETI responds to these arguments on a number of fronts. It contends that the main driver of\nchanges in MSS-2 expenses is the relative amount of equalizable transmission investment in the\ntransmission system by ETI and the other Operating Companies, compared to their proportionate\nresponsibility for that investment, based on each company's responsibility ratio. 373 ETI argues that\nthe other elements of the formula are relatively stable, and do not vary significantly from year to\n\n\n\n371\n      TIEC Ex.

Responsibility Ratio is an allocator that reflects the relative contribution\nof each Operating Company to the System's coincident peak load - in other words, an Operating Company's\ncoincident peak load divided by the System peak load, calculated on a rolling twelve-month average.

ETI points out that\n\"the vast majority\" of the planned transmission projects have received full funding approval and\nhave been constructed or are on schedule to be completed before the end of the Rate Year, while the\nremaining amount is reasonably quantified and measured based on the budget and historical spending\nfor maintenance of equalizable transmission facilities. 375\n\n\n           ETI also argues that its actual MSS-2 expenses have steadily trended upward since the Test\nYear. ETI explains as follows:\n\n\n           [l]n the last month of the test year (June 2011), ETI's payments began to increase\n           significantly, as the balance of relative equalizable investment levels shifted among\n           the Operating Companies. ETI' s actual monthly payments have climbed steadily ever\n           since, reaching $698,289 in the most recent actual month's bill (February 2012).\n           Annualization of this most recent actual data yields an annual MSS-2 amount of\n           $8.4 million, almost five times the test year level. In light of this trend in actual\n           historical data, the notion of basing the MSS-2 expense in rates on the test year level\n           is unreasonable on its face. 376\n\nThus, ETI contends its requested expense level is \"consistent\" with actual recent historical levels of\nMSS-2 expense. 377\n\n\n           ETI describes Cities' concern regarding load growth as a \"red herring.\" ETI contends that\nload growth is not the cause of changes in MSS-2 costs. Instead, its MSS-2 increases are driven by\nthe other Operating Companies' transmission investments, \"separate and apart from, and unaffected\nby,\" any increase in ETI's load. 378 Moreover, ETI contends that load growth adjustments are not\n\n\n\n374\n      Tr. at 763 and 780.\n375\n      ETI Ex. 59 (McCulla Rebuttal) at 2-3; ETI Initial Brief at 88-89.\n376\n      ETI Initial Brief at 90-91; Tr. at 784.\n377\n      ETI Initial Brief at 91.\n378\n      ETI Ex. 45 (Cicio Rebuttal) at 4-5; ETI Initial Brief at 93.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE 116\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nknown and measurable and are not the proper subject of a post-test year adjustment for ordinary\nexpenses such as MSS-2 costs. 379\n\n\n          Finally, if the Commission rejects its request for $10.7 million in MSS-2 costs, ETI suggests\nannualizing the most recent period of its actual MSS-2 costs, by multiplying its February 2012 MSS-\n2 bill times 12, resulting in an amount of $8,379,480.                  ETI contends this would be more\nrepresentative of expected Rate Year MSS-2 costs than the amounts proposed by the intervenors. 380\n\n\n          For largely the same reasons as were discussed relative to PPCCs, the ALls conclude that\nETI failed to meet its burden to prove that its proposed Rate Year MSS-2 costs are known and\nmeasurable. The MSS-2 formula requires assumptions about a great number of variables. Changes\nto any of the variables could occur during the Rate Year, thereby altering the amount paid by (or\nreceived by) ETI during the Rate Year. The projects that underlie ETI's Rate Year request are\nlargely not yet built, and might never be built. Additionally, much like with the PPCCs estimates,\nthere is a wide gulf between the competing estimates by ETI, Cities, and TIEC of forecast Rate Year\nMSS-2 costs, illustrating the problem of deviating from actual Test Year data in an area that involves\nso many future contingencies and unknowns.\n\n\n          The ALls are equally unconvinced by ETI's alternative proposal to multiply its February\n2012 MSS-2 bill times 12, resulting in an amount of $8,379,480. ETI offered no evidence to\nestablish that a single month's costs can serve as a reasonable representation of what ETI's future\nRate Year MSS-2 costs will be. Moreover, February 2012 is outside of the Test Year.\n\n\n          The intervenors presented substantial evidence to demonstrate that ETI' s estimate of its Rate\nYear MSS-2 costs cannot be considered known and measurable. For this reason, the ALls\nrecommend that ETI's MSS-2 request be rejected. In its place, the ALls recommend that ETI be\nallowed to recover its Test Year MSS-2 costs of $1,753,797.\n\n\n\n379\n      ETI Ex. 57 (May Rebuttal) at 12; ETI Initial Brief at 93.\n380\n      ETI Ex. 46 (Considine Rebuttal) at 37; ETI Initial Brief at 32.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE 117\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nC.        Depreciation Expense [Germane to Preliminary Order Issue No. 12]\n\n          ETI currently has an annual depreciation expense of approximately $72.1 million. This\nexpense is based on the previously approved depreciation rates. 381 ETI now requests depreciation\nrates that would result in an annual depreciation expense of approximately $86 million. This\nrequested amount represents an increase in the annual depreciation expense of approximately\n$13.9 million - almost 20 percent - from the current annual depreciation expense. 382               The\ndepreciation expense ultimately included in retail rates, however, will be derived by applying the\nCommission approved rates to the test year end plant balances as of June 30, 2011.\n\n\n          The other parties have accepted the vast majority of ETI' s recommendations, but take issue\nwith the Company on a few issues related to generation, transmission, distribution, and general plant\naccounts.

Cities witness\nPous also questions the reliability of the data employed by ETI witness Watson in the performance of\nhis study.\n\n\n        An analysis of the competing net salvage rates and life parameters for each account is\npresented in detail below, organized by plant and account group.\n\n\n        1. Terminology and Methodology\n\n        Depreciation is a method of allocating the loss of the service value, not restored by current\nmaintenance, over the useful life of an asset. This loss may be caused by wear and tear, decay,\nobsolescence, or changes in demand. 388\n\n\n\n386\n    ETI Ex. 13 (Watson Direct) at 7; Staff Ex. 2 (Mathis Direct) at 7-8; Cities Ex. 5C (Pous Depreciation\nStudy) at 7, 8, and 34.\n387\n    A total value of Cities' adjustments in this format would be out of context and is therefore not provided in\nthis table.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                                PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                         PAGE 119\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          Within the context of a rate case, the purpose of depreciation is to allow a company to\nrecover the cost of an asset over the asset's useful life. Ideally, the cost of the asset is spread out\nevenly across the years the asset is in service, thus recovering the cost of the asset from the\ncustomers who receive the benefit of the asset. 389\n\n\n          Both ETI and Staff use the remaining-life technique, average life group procedure, and\nstraight-line method to calculate the depreciation rate. 390 The basic formula for the remaining life\ntechnique is presented below.\n\n\n                                                  1 - book reserve ratio - net salvage ratio}\n          depreciation rate ( %)          =   {                  .        . . ll\n                                                          composite remm.nmg z e\n                                                                                                * 100\n\n\n          For example, if an asset has a book reserve ratio of 0.5 (i.e., 50 percent of the asset's value\nhas already been recovered through prior depreciation expense), a net salvage ratio of zero (i.e., the\nasset will cost nothing to retire, or all retiring costs will be recovered through its subsequent sale),\nand the composite remaining life is ten years (i.e., the asset is expected to remain in service for\nanother ten years), then the depreciation rate will be 5 percent (i.e., { [ (1 - 0.5 - 0) I 10 ] *100 }).\n\n\n          By operation of the remaining-life formula, a greater net salvage value will reduce the\nnumerator and result in a lower depreciation rate and a lower depreciation expense. Likewise, a\nlower net salvage value will increase the numerator and result in a higher depreciation rate and a\nhigher depreciation expense. Similarly, a longer remaining-life will result in a lower depreciation\nrate and lower depreciation expense, and a shorter remaining-life will result in a higher depreciation\nrate and a higher depreciation expense.\n\n\n          Because net salvage and remaining-life values are the two contested variables in the\nremaining-life formula, a clear explanation of net salvage and remaining-life will be helpful.\n\n\n388\n      Staff Ex. 2 (Mathis Direct) at 8.\n389\n      Staff Ex. 1 (Mathis Direct) at 8-9.\n390\n      ETI Ex. 13 (Watson Direct) at 15; Staff Ex. 2 (Mathis Direct) at 10-11.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                               PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE 120\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          Net Salvage Value. Net salvage is calculated by taking the amount received for an asset as a\nresult of its sale, reuse, or reimbursement, and subtracting that amount from the cost associated with\nretiring the asset. This figure is then divided by the original cost of the asset to determine the net\nsalvage ratio. For example, if an asset with an original cost of $200 is resold for $20, but it costs the\nowner $10 to ship the asset to the purchaser, then the net salvage value of that asset would be $10\n($20 - $10), and the net salvage ratio of that asset would be 5 percent ($10/$200).\n\n\n          ETI witness Watson and Staff witness Mathis used different methods of calculating a net\nsalvage rate. 391 Mr. Watson took the average (mean) of recorded net salvage values for groups of\nsuccessive years (rolling bands), and then selected the net salvage rate from among these averages. 392\nMs. Mathis also used rolling band averages (means), but then took the median from a representative\ngroup of rolling bands when the historical salvage data would have otherwise produced what\nMr. Watson considers skewed results. 393\n\n\n          Ms. Mathis' method of calculating net salvage rates follows recent Commission precedent. 394\nAs Mr. Watson explained at the hearing, it is appropriate to infer acceptance of a methodology by\nlooking at whether the Commission adopted the conclusions that the methodology produced. 395 In\nother words, if the Commission adopts the conclusions, then by inference the Commission has\nadopted the methodology used to derive those conclusions. Thus, it is necessary to examine recent\nlitigated rate cases to ascertain Commission precedent.\n\n\n          In the most recent fully-litigated rate case, Docket No. 38339, 396 Staff disagreed with\nCenterPoint' s depreciation witness, Mr. Watson, concerning the net salvage rates for five\n\n\n\n391\n      Tr.at415-416.\n392\n      ETI Ex. 13 (Watson Direct) at 20-21.\n393\n      Id. at 22-23, 32-33.\n394\n      Tr. at 1766; Staff Ex. 9 (Docket No. 38339 Final Order) at FoF 126, 128, 130, and 131.\n395\n      Tr. at 397.\n396\n    Application of CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, UC, for Authority to Change Rates, Docket\nNo. 38339 (June 23, 2011).\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                              PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE 121\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\naccounts. 397 In its order, the Commission adopted Staffs recommended net salvage rates for four\nout of those five accounts for which Staff disagreed with Mr. Watson. 398 Staffs method for\n                                                                                                        399\ncalculating net salvage rates is the same in the present case as it was in the CenterPoint rate case.\n\n\n            ETI argues that the use of a median, as employed by Ms. Mathis, is not a sufficiently rigorous\nor expansive approach to depreciation analysis. According to ETI, depreciation training and texts, as\nwell as authoritative statistical texts, favor the average, or mean, not the median, as the best indicator\nof the central tendency of a data set. ETI argues that this is particularly the case because depreciation\nanalysis requires careful consideration of trends over time. 400 ETI then offers the following\ncomments:\n\n\n            [Ms. Mathis] agreed in response to a hypothetical that the median value of an initial\n            period of ten years of +5% net salvage, followed by one year of 0% salvage, followed\n            by the most recent period of ten years of -5% salvage, would be 0%. This\n            hypothetical plainly illustrates how reliance on the median can overlook data trends.\n            In the hypothetical, if the depreciation analyst would otherwise wish to give more\n            weight to the most recent historical period as indicative of conditions going forward,\n                                                                                      401\n            the use of the median would obscure that important trend information.\n\nA close examination of the hypothetical shows that in the case posited by ETI, however, the median\nand the mean are identical: both are zero. While the use of the median would produce a result that\nignores the trend that ETI says should be taken into account, the mean produces the same result.\nChanging the hypothetical produces no more clarity. If the examination was of a period that had ten\nyears of positive five percent salvage value, followed by one year of zero percent net salvage value,\nfollowed by the most recent 10-year period, which had negative 10 percent net salvage value, the\nmedian would still be zero but the mean would be negative 2.38 percent. This appears to support the\ntrending argument advanced by ETI. If the analysis then focuses on a different hypothetical, one\n\n\n397\n      Tr. at 401-402.\n398\n      See Staff Ex. 9 (Docket No. 38339 Final Order); Tr. at 402.\n399\n      Tr. at 415-416.\n400\n      ETI Initial Brief at 105.\n401   Id.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                     PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE 122\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nwith ten years of positive 10 percent net salvage value followed by one year of zero percent net\nsalvage value, with the most recent ten-year period having negative five percent net salvage value,\nthe results are more perplexing. The median is still zero, but the mean, which ETI contends will\nrecognize the trending, is 2.38. Although this does in some respects recognize the trend to a negative\nsalvage value, it does not recognize it as well as the median.\n\n\n       Principles and Procedures of Statistics, by Steel and Torrie, states: \"Certain types of data\nshow a tendency to have a pronounced tail to the right or the left. Such distributions are said to be\nskewed, and the arithmetic mean may not be the most informative central value.\" Where the average\nof the incomes of a group of individuals is required, and most of those incomes are low, the mean\nincome could be considerably larger than the median. In Docket No. 38339, Staff posed the\nfollowing example, which the AU s found both informative and persuasive: Suppose a sample of\n50 incomes from professional baseball players was taken that happened to include the salary of two\nof the most highly compensated players in the league today. As a result, the mean of the salaries\nwould likely be far greater than the median salary, because the use of the median would be skewed\nby the very high salaries. The median would likely provide a more accurate measure of the central\ntendency of the salaries. Such circumstances are found where using the median to find the central\ntendency prevents outliers in data that \"skews\" or shows extreme variations rather than showing\nmore symmetrical variations. The ALls believe this is as accurate today as it was during the Docket\nNo. 38339 timeframe. They therefore find that the use of the median is the more appropriate\nmethodology for determining net salvage value.\n\n\n       Remaining Life. Composite remaining life is the weighted average remaining life of the\nproperty account for a group of all vintages. The average remaining life represents the future years\nof service expected for the surviving property.\n\n\n       There are numerous ways to calculate the remaining life (life parameter) of a group of assets\nin a depreciation study. Examples include the interim retirement rate method and the retirement\n(actuarial) rate method. The interim retirement rate method uses interim retirement curves to model\n(predict) the retirement of individual assets within plant accounts. Alternatively, the retirement\n\fSOAHDOCKET N O . -                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                 PAGE 123\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n(actuarial) rate method uses historical mortality data for a group of assets and compares that data to\nvarious known patterns of industrial asset mortality rates (Iowa Curves). If the historical data creates\na pattern of mortality that closely follows one of the Iowa Curves, then that Iowa Curve may be used\nto approximate the remaining lives of that given group of assets in the future. Whether the historical\nmortality data creates a pattern that closely follows a given Iowa Curve is determined through\nplotting both sets of data (the historical mortality data and the Iowa Curve) on a graph and\nquantifying the closeness of fit through statistical analysis and visual examination.\n\n\n          Mr. Watson used multiple methods to calculate the remaining lives of assets, depending on\nthe asset. Generally, he used the retirement rate (actuarial) method. 402 However, to calculate the\nremaining life of production plant accounts, he used the interim retirement rate method. 403 Ms.\nMathis disagreed with the use of the interim retirement rate method because the Commission has\nrejected the application of interim retirement rates of production plant, as they are based on future\nprojection of retirements, for ETI and Central Power and Light Company in Docket Nos. 16705404\nand 14965,405 respectively.\n\n\n          ETI argues that the life span procedure, without the use of interim retirement curves, is\nunrealistic in its assumption that all production plant assets are \"depreciated (straight-line) for the\nsame number of periods and retire at the same time (the terminal retirement date).\" Use of interim\nretirements is an important refinement that adds accuracy to the determination of the depreciation\nrates according to ETI. Mr. Watson offered the following explanation:\n\n\n          Adding interim retirement curves to the procedure reflects the fact that some of the\n          assets at a power plant will not survive to the end of the life of the facility and should\n\n\n402\n      ETI Ex. 13 (Watson Direct) at 16.\n403\n      Staff Ex. 2 (Mathis Direct) at 14.\n404\n   Application ofEntergy Gulf States, Inc., for Approval of its Transition to Competition to Competition Plan\nand the Tariffs Implementing the Plan, and for the Authority to Reconcile Fuel Costs, to Set Revised Fuel\nFactors, and to Recover a Surcharge for Under-recovered Fuel Costs, Docket No. 16705 (Oct. 14, 1998).\n405\n    Application of Central Power & Light Company for Authority to Change Rates, Docket No. 14965\n(Oct. 16, 1997).\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE 124\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          be depreciated (straight-line) more quickly and retired earlier than the terminal life of\n          the facility. 406\n\nETI contends that this issue presents a unique situation where all the experts agree with the\ntheoretical soundness of Mr. Watson's approach, but Mr. Pous and Ms. Mathis recommend its\nrejection due to the existence of contrary Commission precedent. The impact of their position is a\n$1,558,081 reduction to depreciation expense, based on December 31, 2010, plant balances.\nMr. Pous generally supports the use of interim retirements because \"I think it's right,\"407 and he uses\nthe method in other jurisdictions, where it is a prevalent practice. Ms. Mathis \"also appears to\nrecognize the theoretical soundness of utilizing interim retirements.\"408 Even in Docket No. 16705,\nthe precedent cited by Mr. Pous and Ms. Mathis, the Staff depreciation witness agreed that the use of\ninterim retirements was appropriate, though not blessed by the Commission. ETI argues that use of\ninterim retirements reflects the undisputable fact that \"generating units will have retirements of\ndepreciable property before the end of their lives.''409\n\n\n          ETI is correct that neither Ms. Mathis nor Mr. Pous provide any reasoning behind the prior\nCommission precedent. Moreover, it is also true that the Commission precedent is relatively old at\nthis point (dating back to the mid-1990s) and apparently has not been revisited in any recent cases.\nETI argues that the Commission has in at least one other case used interim retirements (Docket\nNo. 15195410), but provides little more than that comment to support the concept. It is true that in\nconcept, interim retirements are determined in much the same fashion as other elements of\ndepreciation analysis.        Primarily based on historical accounting data, the analyst identifies\ncharacteristics in the history of the data upon which to base a reasoned assessment of retirements\ngoing forward, which is similar to what occurs in determining asset lives or net salvage.

Production Plant\n\n                       (a) Lives\n\n          Mr. Watson primarily used the life span method to calculate remaining lives of the\nproduction plant accounts. 411 The life span method estimates a production plant's life based on\nconsultation with utility management, financial, and engineering staff.412 However, he used interim\nretirement methodology to reduce the remaining lives determined by the life span method. Staff\ndoes not dispute the remaining lives determined by the life span methodology, but does dispute the\nuse of interim retirements. For the reasons discussed in Section VII.C.l, ETI should not be allowed\nto use the interim retirement methodology to adjust downward the remaining lives of its production\nplant accounts.\n\n\n          Cities witness Pous disputed only the remaining life determination for ETI's Sabine Power\nPlant Units 4 and 5, ETI's largest and newest gas fired generating units. Mr. Pous recommended a\nlife span for Sabine Units 4 and 5 of 64 years based on assessment of the units, comparison to the\nestimated life span of similar units owned by ETI as well as other gas fired generating units across\nthe country. ETI proposes a 60-year life for the two units. Mr. Pous noted that a \"64-year life span\nrecommended for Sabine Units 4 and 5 is consistent with the life span proposed by the Company for\nits Lewis Creek 1 generating unit. Lewis Creek Unit 1 is an older, smaller, and generally less\n\n411\n      ETI Ex. 13 (Watson Direct) at 16.\n412\n      Staff Ex. 2 (Mathis Direct) at 14.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                               PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE 126\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nefficient generating unit than Sabine Units 4 and 5. Cities contend that there is no basis or logic for\nassigning a shorter life span for a more capital-intensive asset that is newer, larger, and generally\nmore efficient.\"413\n\n\n          ETI witness Watson explained that he primarily relied on the determination of Company\npersonnel to arrive at the 60-year life for the Sabine Units. Although Cities attempted to cast doubt\non Mr. Watson's determinations regarding the life of these units, it is clear that his determinations\nare based on conversations with ETI various generation personnel and that those conversations\nconfirmed that based on evaluation of a variety of considerations, including age, operational role,\nlevel of funding, unit condition, and operational risk, 60 years constitutes a reasonable threshold for\nthe expected life of Sabine Units 4 and 5. It is also clear that comparisons to Lewis Creek Unit 1 are\nnot appropriate. Lewis Creek Unit 1 has significant differences, which explain its longer life-span.\nUnlike the Sabine Units, ETI is planning to spend in excess of $100 million to refurbish the Lewis\nCreek critical equipment over the next three years to sustain operating reliability. ETI is not\nperforming similar refurbishment activities at Sabine. 414\n\n\n          The Sabine Units are projected to be \"must-run\" units. This means that these units are, for\nthe most part, deployed to operate whenever they are available for service. Mr. Pous compared these\nunits to EAi's Lake Catherine Units 1 & 2, 415 but ETI contends this is not a reasonable comparison.\nEAi's Lake Catherine Units 1 & 2 are not \"must-run\" units. They experience very infrequent\noperation and are not projected to run much in the future. Other things being equal, according to\nETI, this would justify the longer 67-year life span assigned to these Arkansas units, because they\nwould not be experiencing the wear and tear of daily operation.416\n\n\n          The explanations offered by ETI for the 60-year life of the Sabine Units 4 and 5 generating\nfacilities are convincing. It appears that Mr. Watson engaged knowledgeable people within ETI to\n\n413\n      Cities Ex. 5C (Pous Depreciation Study) at 9.\n414\n      ETI Ex. 51 (Garrison Rebuttal) at 3.\n415\n      Cities Ex. 5 (Pous Direct) at 7-8.\n416\n      ETI Ex. 51 (Garrison Rebuttal) at 3.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                          PAGE 127\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ngather pertinent information and applied that information appropriately. The comparison to Lake\nCreek units is not appropriate given the planned refurbishment of those units. Similarly, the\ncomparison to the Lake Catherine units also fails. A unit that does not carry the \"must-run\"\ndesignation can easily be expected to perform longer than a unit, such as the Sabine Units, that\ncarries the \"must-run\" designation. Accordingly, the ALls find that ETI' s choice of a 60-year life for\nthe Sabine Units 4 and 5 is reasonable.\n\n\n                       (b) Net Salvage Value\n\n          In determining the net salvage attributable to production plant, ETI witness Watson started\nwith the negative 5 percent net salvage factor approved most recently for ETI in PUC Docket\nNo. 16705. This is a net salvage value that the Commission has adopted in a number of cases for\nproduction plant. 417 Mr. Watson testified that the net salvage calculation must reflect known\nchanges in the cost of retiring production plant since the net salvage factor was last set. Accordingly,\nMr. Watson's study used the Handy-Whitman labor index to calculate the change in labor costs\napplicable to removal activity for the years 1997 to 2010. Consideration of the increases in labor\ncosts over this 13-year period resulted in an increase in the cost of removal, and a corresponding\nincrease in the level of negative net salvage, from negative five percent to negative 8.5 percent. 418\n\n\n          Both Staff witness Mathis and Cities witness Pous disagreed with ETI's proposal for\nproduction plant net salvage. Ms. Mathis proposed that the existing negative 5 percent net salvage\nfactor be retained. Ms. Mathis stated that Mr. Watson's analysis is flawed for three reasons:\n\n\n•     First, Mr. Watson did not calculate a gross salvage value for each plant. This is a\n      necessary element of the fundamental net salvage rate calculation. 419\n\n•     Second, Mr. Watson unreasonably assumed that all steam production plants would be\n      demolished at the end of their estimated remaining lives without any consideration of\n\n\n417\n      Staff Ex. 2 (Mathis Direct) at l 7.\n418\n      ETI Ex. 13 (Watson Direct) at Ex.

The Commission has consistently approved negative five percent net\n      salvage rates for production plants if detailed plant-specific and reasonable demolition\n      cost studies were not filed by the utility. 421\n\n            ETI responds that Staffs recommendation fails to account for the fact that the\nnegative 5 percent benchmark is stale, having been established in a Commission proceeding 35 years\nago. Since that time, \"labor costs have escalated by 267 percent with the rational expectation that\nthey will continue to increase at least with inflation.\"422\n\n\n            Cities witness Pous recommended moving from the current negative five percent net salvage\nto a positive 5 percent net salvage; i.e., that it should be determined that the gross salvage from the\npower plants will exceed the removal cost. Mr. Pous stated that he bases this claim on the ETI' s\nactual experience over the past 45 years as well as current trends within the industry in the last\n14 years. According to Mr. Pous, ETI has retired many units since 1965 and demolished or sold the\nunits and achieved a range of net salvage values from zero percent net salvage to\npositive 180 percent. 423 Other utilities in Texas and elsewhere have also experienced positive net\nsalvage levels. 424 Mr. Pous testified that since 1998 over 1,000 generating units have been sold, and\nin all instances resulted in positive net salvage. 425 He also claims that his positive five percent\nproduction net salvage is consistent with the Commission's decision in the most recent SPS case,\nDocket No. 32766, where Mr. Watson was hired by SPS as a depreciation witness and the\n\n\n\n\n420\n      Id. at 17.\n421   Id.\n422\n      ETI Ex. 71 (Watson Rebuttal) at 17, 19.\n423\n      Cities Ex. 5 (Pous Direct) at 15.\n424\n      Cities Ex. 5C (Pous Depreciation Study) at 11; Cities Ex. 5 (Pous Direct) at 15-16.\n425\n      Cities Ex. 5C (Pous Depreciation Study) at 11.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                         PAGE 129\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nCommission ultimately approved a positive five percent net salvage. 426 As ETI notes, however, the\nSPS rate case was the result of settlement427 and is of little precedential value.\n\n\n          ETI argues that Cities witness Pous appears to primarily base this claim on the fact that the\nsale of utility plants in circumstances bearing no relationship to depreciation analysis has yielded\ngains that Mr. Pous characterizes as \"positive net salvage.\" He uses as examples sales that form a\npart of the restructuring of the Texas utility business to introduce retail competition. Ms. Mathis also\nconcluded, without elaboration, that ETI' s production plant net salvage analysis is flawed because it\ndoes not consider the possibility that the unit could be sold as a consequence of deregulation.\nNeither Ms. Mathis nor Mr. Pous, however, pointed to any instance in which the Commission has\nadopted such an approach to determining net salvage.\n\n\n          ETI contends that this argument should be rejected for a number of reasons. It argues that\nalthough there is no precedent supporting Ms. Mathis' and Mr. Pous' approach, there is clear recent\nprecedent rejecting the inclusion of sales in depreciation analysis. 428 The sales referenced by these\nwitnesses are unique and unpredictable events, as should be evident from the use of the restructuring\nof the utility industry as an example of this type of activity. Indeed, at this time the Texas\nLegislature has halted for the foreseeable future any ETI move to competition. For purposes of\ndepreciation analysis, net salvage is aimed at determining the salvage received at the end of the\nplants' useful lives. Mr. Pous' analysis necessarily assumed that, due to the sale, the life of the\nplants will be truncated. Yet he made no adjustment to production plant lives to account for the\neffect of theoretical sales.429\n\n\n          ETI also contends that Mr. Pous' other examples of positive net salvage are equally\nunavailing. Mr. Pous points to ETI's retirement of Neches Station as an example of positive\n\n426\n      Cities Ex. 5 (Pous Direct) at l 7.\n427\n      See ETI Ex. 71 (Watson Rebuttal) at 6.\n428\n   See Application ofAEP Texas Central Co. for Authority to Change Rates, Docket No. 33309, FoF l 07,\n108, 112 (Mar. 4, 2008) (proceeds from sale of building properly removed from depreciation analysis as\nnon-recurring item).\n429\n      ETI Ex. 71 (Watson Rebuttal) at 5-7.\n\fSOAHDOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE 130\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nsalvage,430 but fails to mention that: (1) this outcome was uniquely the result of insurance proceeds\nreceived by ETI after a boiler explosion; and (2) the proceeds flowed back to customers via means\nother than depreciation rates. 431 ETI contends that Mr. Po us' claim that a contractor paid $1 million\nfor the right to demolish a power plant, apparently based on unrecorded hearsay conversations, and\nwithout any information from Mr. Pous regarding the facts and circumstances surrounding the\ntransaction, proves nothing.\n\n\n          Finally, Mr. Pous stated that Mr. Watson's adjustment to the net salvage rates is flawed\nbecause it does not adequately reflect the increase in scrap metal prices in recent years. ETI responds\nthat although scrap metal prices have gone up recently, it is unknown what the prices will be in the\nfuture, and these commodity prices have proven to be quite volatile and unpredictable. 432 According\nto ETI, it is not reasonable to assume, as does Mr. Pous, that prices will stay indefinitely at what is\ntheir historically highest level. ETI argues that Mr. Pous' method is based on speculation and broad,\nconclusory opinions regarding economic trends, as to which he makes no attempt to actually arrive at\na quantifiable analysis that yields his unprecedented positive net salvage recommendation. 433\n\n\n          Mr. Pous' testimony that net salvage value should be revised to reflect a value of\npositive 5 percent is seriously flawed. First, pointing to a settled case as precedent carries no weight.\nSecond, attempting to draw conclusions from sales that were forced to comply with the regulatory\nframework and apply those conclusions to an entity that is not subject to the same regulatory\nframework is equally flawed. Finally, Mr. Pous attempted to use ETI's own experience to support\nhis position ignores the fact that ETI' s experiences were driven by factors that were unique to ETI at\nthe time and circumstances involved; they do not support the more universal application urged by\nMr. Pous.\n\n\n\n\n43\n  ° Cities Ex. 5 (Pous Direct) at 14.\n431\n      ETI Ex. 46 (Considine Rebuttal) at 49-50.\n432\n      ETI Ex. 71 (Watson Rebuttal) at 17-18.\n433\n      ETI Initial Brief at 103.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE 131\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          Ms. Mathis' analysis, in some respects, suffers from the same flaws as Mr. Pous'.\nNevertheless, some of her points carry more weight. The AUs believe that Mr. Watson is correct\nthat labor costs have increased since the negative five percent net salvage value was first established\nby the Commission. However, that is not the end of the story. Are there other factors that also have\nchanged in the corresponding time period? There is no evidence on this point, and that is the crux of\nthe matter. As Ms. Mathis argues, there is only one way that all the changing values can be\nevaluated; through the introduction of plant-specific demolition cost studies. Had studies of that\nnature been provided, the parties would have been able to evaluate them and provide a supportable,\nfully-vetted recommendation.           The AUs recommend that the Commission find that a\nnegative 5 percent net salvage value for production plant is appropriate.\n\n\n                      (c) Depreciation Reserve\n\n          TIEC argues that $1.1 million of ETI's requested $13 million increase in depreciation\nexpenses is related to ETI' s production plant assets. 434 ETI has a $92,537 ,000 surplus in production\nplant assets. A surplus depreciation reserve occurs when the theoretical reserve (the reserve that\nwould exist if the current proposed rates had been in place in the past) exceeds the per book\ndepreciation reserve. According to TIEC, this indicates that ETI customers have overpaid the value\nof production plant assets. 435 Since ETI has already over-recovered the value of the production plant\nassets, there is no valid reason to seek any additional recovery. TIEC contends that ETI has not\nshown why it needs to increase production depreciation rates at this time given that the production\ndepreciation reserve has a considerable surplus. Therefore, it argues, $1.1 million of the proposed\nincrease should be rejected.\n\n\n          ETI rejects TIEC' s recommendation because it is clearly contrary to Commission policy and\nprecedent. According to ETI, the Commission has consistently adopted the remaining life, straight-\nline method for determining depreciation rates. 436 This method requires that the remaining life of\n\n434\n    ETI Ex. 13A (Watson Workpapers) at Appendix B. This figure is derived by subtracting the expenses\nfrom the existing production plant account from the proposed production plant account.\n435\n      TIEC Ex. l (Pollock Direct) at 36-37, Ex.

In this way, by the end of the life, the costs will be recovered.\nMr. Pollock's approach ignores these principles, and seeks to look back in time to compare how the\ndepreciation rates now proposed would have affected the recovery in the past. Those past\ndepreciation rates, however, were authorized for use by the Commission.                  ETI argues that\ndepreciation rates are at all times estimates, subject to adjustment using updated studies, and there is\nno reason for adoption of Mr. Pollock's alternative. Finally, the Commission expressly rejected\nadjustment to the outcome of remaining life depreciation determinations based on differences\nbetween theoretical and book depreciation reserves in CenterPoint Docket No. 38339. 437\n\n\n          The ALls agree with TIEC that the Commission's decision in Docket No. 38339 is not\nfour-square on point with this case. That is not sufficient, however, to overcome the arguments\nadvanced by ETI in favor of its position in the current case. The Commission has consistently used\nthe remaining life, straight-line methodology for determining depreciation rates, and that\nmethodology requires that the remaining life of the asset be determined, and depreciation rates\nestablished to recover the asset's remaining cost in equal installments over that life. Mr. Pollock's\nproposal ignores that consistently applied methodology. The AU s recommend that the Commission\napprove ETI's recommended treatment of the production plant depreciation reserve.\n\n\n          3.

For Account 352, he found the five-year and\nten-year moving averages for the years 2008-2010 particularly telling. 440 A moving average is a\nrolling average that updates each year to include the additional year as part of the average for the\nlonger period under study. Mr. Watson testified that his recommendation of negative 10 percent net\nsalvage is consistent (albeit less negative) with the five-year and ten-year moving averages for 2008,\nwhich range from negative 16.31 percent to negative 16.80 percent. Although the moving averages\n\n\n\n\n439\n      Staff Ex. 2A (Mathis Direct) at 21; Cities Ex. 5 (Pous Direct) at 28.\n440\n      ETI Ex. 71 (Watson Rebuttal) at 56.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                 PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE 134\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nfor 2009 and 2010 appear more positive, this was the result of a large, atypical gross salvage in\n            441\n2009.             Cities propose no change to Mr. Watson's recommendation.\n\n\n              Staff witness Mathis recommended a net salvage rate of negative five percent for\nAccount 352. This recommendation is based on analysis of historical salvage data for the period of\n1984 through 2010. Specifically, the three-year moving average for the same period produces a net\nsalvage rate of negative 5.53 percent, which is very close to the currently approved net salvage rate\nfor this account. Moreover, an examination of the mean and median rolling band averages for\nAccount 352 shows a range of net salvage rates between positive 0.08 percent and\nnegative 6.83 percent. 442 Thus, according to Ms. Mathis, the net salvage rate of negative 5 percent is\na reasonable estimate based on the available historical data.\n\n\n              In response to Mr. Watson's contention that the 2008 moving average is the most important,\nMs. Mathis pointed out that the 2009 five-year and ten-year moving averages feature\npositive 16.66 percent and positive 4.45 percent net salvage rates, respectively. Moreover, the 2010\nfive-year and ten-year moving averages feature positive 25 .13 percent and positive 6. 75 percent net\nsalvage rates, respectively. 443 Ms. Mathis stated that if it is a sound depreciation methodology to\nselect a net salvage rate based on recent five-year and ten-year moving averages, then the rate for this\naccount should be significantly greater than either Ms. Mathis' or Mr. Watson's recommendation. 444\n\n\n                  Although the moving averages cited by Ms. Mathis for 2009 and 2010 appear to belie the\narguments raised by Ms. Watson, the AlJs are persuaded that those are significantly influenced by\nthe atypical gross salvage resulting from the 2009 sale of a spare transformer, an asset whose cost is\nbooked to an entirely different account.

Mr. Pons noted that the\nactual per book data for a five-year band and a ten-year band are a positive 117 .04 percent and a\npositive 31.95 percent, respectively. 447 Mr. Pous stated that his analysis does not ignore the positive\nnet salvage recorded by ETI because of the sale of transmission investment, rather he testified that:\n\n\n            the Company has reported five separate sales during the past 22 years, or about once\n            every four years. Such activity cannot be considered an 'unusual circumstance' or an\n            outlier, and should be taken into consideration as an event that may continue to occur\n            in the future. In a proper evaluation phase of a depreciation study, recognition of\n            some level of future sales is appropriate. 448\n\n\n\n\n445\n      The atypical amount is shown at Appendix E-2, p. 1 of 10 of Mr. Watson's depreciation study.\n446\n      ETI Ex. 13 (Watson Direct) at Ex.

According to ETI,\nMr. Watson's workpapers clearly indicate that adjustments were required and made to the per book\ndata for unique transactions involving sales and storm activity. As to sales, the workpapers 450 show\nthat in the 26 years of data for Account 353, there were three occasions with very large sales\nproceeds for the sale of substations. As to storm activities, the same workpapers show only one\noccasion in 26 years where gross salvage amounts were recorded. ETI contends that these unique\nevents are properly excluded from net salvage analysis and Mr. Pous' reliance on the per book data\nto establish positive net salvage is erroneous. With respect to Mr. Pous' concem's relating to the\nprice of copper, ETI responds that Mr. Pous' reliance on copper's scrap value is pure speculation,\nunsupported by any ETl-specific data regarding the amount of copper at issue, or any consideration\nof the offsetting significant and increasing labor costs involved in the removal of large station\ntransformers.\n\n\n           As explained by Mr. Watson, it appears to the AlJs that the adjustments made were, indeed,\nrequired because of the unique nature of the events they reflected. The AU s also find that Mr. Pous'\nconcerns relating to the price of copper are speculative. Coupled with the fact that Staff supports\nETI's proposed net salvage value, the AUs recommend that the Commission approve ETI's\nrecommended negative 20 percent net salvage value.\n\n\n\n\n449\n      Id. at 22.\n450\n   ETI Ex. 13A (Watson Direct) Workpaper on CD, \"Entergy Net Salvage Transmission Distribution\nGeneral\" Spreadsheet, \"Data Adjustments\" Tab, Account 353.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                              PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                        PAGE 137\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n                   (iii) Account 354-Towers and Fixtures\n\n           Although there is limited experience available for this account, the five-year and ten-year\nmoving averages for transaction year 2010 show a substantial level of negative net salvage\n(negative 299 percent and negative 233 percent, respectively).

Mr. Pous concurred in this recommendation.\n\n\n           Ms. Mathis recommended a net salvage rate of negative 5 percent for Account 354. 452 This\nrecommendation is based on Commission precedent due to the absence of reliable historical salvage\ndata. 453 Although historical salvage data is available for the period of 1984 through 2010, this\naccount had a low level of retirement during this period. 454 Because of the limited retirement\nactivity, Ms. Mathis stated that a reasonable net salvage rate cannot be calculated from the historical\nsalvage data. 455         For example, annual net salvage rates range from approximately\nnegative 6,000 percent to approximately positive 31,253,400 percent.456 According to Ms. Mathis,\nsuch divergent numbers are indicative of the low retirement activity within this account.\n\n\n           The negative five percent net salvage value recommended by Ms. Mathis is the current\nCommission-approved number. The AUs find it difficult to draw any conclusions from the paucity\nof historical data. Had there been additional historical data, it might have been possible to reach the\nconclusion urged by Mr. Watson; however, there was not.

Although years 2009-2010 reflect positive\nsalvage values, Mr. Watson determined that these values were the product of differences in the\ntiming of the recording of the various transactions associated with the asset retirement, rather than\nreflecting an actual positive salvage amount. 458 For example, Mr. Watson's net salvage workpapers\nshow a significant level of positive salvage only for the years 2009-2010 in Account 355. 459 This is\nat odds with the remainder of the net salvage data shown in the workpapers, which is almost\nexclusively negative net salvage. 460 Accordingly, Mr. Watson gave less weight to the 2009 and 2010\nvalues, but moderated his recommendation compared to the ten-year moving averages, resulting in a\nrecommended net salvage of negative 30 percent. Ms. Mathis concurred.\n\n\n          Cities witness Po us disagreed with Mr. Watson's analysis, claiming: ( 1) per book data from\nthe five-year and ten-year moving averages show positive net salvage amounts; (2) authoritative\ndepreciation treatises do not support Mr. Watson's decision to adjust relocation-related transactions\nout of the analysis; 461 (3) no portion of relocation-related costs can be treated as removal unless that\ntreatment is prescribed by contract with the third-party; and (4) after the correction to his analysis,\nMr. Watson changed his methodology to arrive at a negative net salvage recommendation. Mr. Pous\nrecommended an increase in the net salvage values to a negative 15 percent based on the actual\nhistorical data of ETI.

The most recent five-year band of actual data yields a positive two percent net\nsalvage.462\n\n\n          The ALI s agree that the debate regarding this account essentially boils down to whether\nMr. Watson's adjustment to remove relocation expense associated with third-party reimbursement\nfrom the analysis is appropriate. Although Mr. Pous claims that Mr. Watson's approach is contrary\nto authoritative guidance, ETI contends that he arrives at that conclusion only by disregarding the\nguidance in question, as well as Commission precedent. ETI argues that the depreciation text in\nquestion squarely supports Mr. Watson's approach:\n\n\n          A reimbursed retirement is one for which the company is fully compensated at the\n          time of retirement .... Usually reimbursed retirements should not be included in\n          analysis of property whose investment is recovered through depreciation accruals. 463\n\n          Mr. Watson explained at hearing that, in his experience, adjustments to remove relocation\nexpense are standard in depreciation analysis, and to do otherwise would result in a disproportionate\nimpact on reasonably expected ongoing net salvage, caused by a transaction (the relocation) that\nconstitutes a very small portion of the overall assets in question. 464\n\n\n          Mr. Pous stated that all third-party reimbursements for facility relocation performed by the\nCompany have to be deemed as salvage (thereby inflating the salvage portion of the net between\nremoval costs and salvage proceeds) unless a contract between ETI and a third-party explicitly says\notherwise. Mr. Watson's approach, however, is squarely supported the Commission's decision in the\nrecent Oncor case, Docket No. 35717, where it was held that these third-party \"reimbursements are\nprepayments for new property being installed.\"465 The Al.Js find that Mr. Pous' argument is not\ncredible in light of Mr. Watson's treatment of relocations in general. Since Mr. Watson properly\nremoved such relocation expense from the depreciation analysis altogether, those amounts correctly\n\n\n462\n      Cities Ex. 5C (Pous Depreciation Study) at 22-25.\n463\n      ETI Ex. 71 (Watson Rebuttal) at 63 (quoting Depreciation Systems, Iowa State Press, 1994, at 16-17).\n464\n      Tr. at 405.\n465\n      ETI Ex. 71 (Watson Rebuttal) at 63.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                              PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                          PAGE 140\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nhave no impact on depreciation rates, regardless of how they are allocated between gross salvage\nproceeds and the cost of installing new facilities.\n\n\n          ETI' s evidence and argument support its request.

Mr. Watson's study determined that the longer ten-year moving average for\ntransaction year 2010 showed salvage of negative 33 percent, so Mr. Watson recommended moving\nto negative 30 percent net salvage for this account.467 Staff witness Mathis adopted the same\nnegative net salvage value.\n\n\n          Cities' witness Pous recommended an increase to the net salvage value to a\nnegative 10 percent based on a review of the actual historical data. The actual five-year and ten-year\nbands yield a positive one percent and a negative 31 percent.

He stated thatthe\ncurrent plant in service reflects a life (13.97 years on average) that is substantially shorter than his\nrecommendation, and all the bands examined reflect a shorter life than the currently approved\n44 years.

Mr. Watson indicated that his proposed life parameter shows a better fit over\nthe full range of placement and experience bands applicable to this account. 481\n\n\n           Mr. Pous recommended that the expected service life remain at 44 years based on actuarial\nanalysis and advances made by the industry and ETI in treating and preserving poles. 482 Mr. Pous\nalso noted that \"absent identifiable and supportable specific problems, the industry is not\nexperiencing shorter lives for poles and neither should ETI.\" 483 He stated that selection of different\ntypes of poles and different treatments by other utilities have their engineers expecting lives between\n\n479\n      ETI Ex. 13 (Watson Direct) at Ex.

As\nMr. Pous noted, \"the highest retirement ratio for this investment in the first 23 years occurred at age\n0.5 years, for brand new assets.

The ALl s recommend that the Commission\nadopt ETI's proposed life parameter of 39 R0.5.\n\n\n                   (iv) Account 367 - Underground Conductors and Devices\n\n          The Commission approved average service life is 40 years. 496 Mr. Watson's life parameter\nfor this account (35 Rl.5) is based on h.is review of the various placement and experience bands, as\nwell as the characteristics and longevity of the conductors in place in the ETI system and the\nretirement patterns that are unique to underground conductor performance and the locations where it\nis buried. 497 Ms. Mathis agreed with Mr. Watson on this account. Cities propose a significantly\nlonger life (45 S-0.5). Mr. Pous stated that Mr. Watson's and Ms. Mathis' recommendations do not\naccount for the increased durability of newer types of conductor, and that the actuarial analysis\nshould focus on more recent data that he believes is more consistent with the newer conductors. 498\n\n\n          Mr. Watson testified that Mr. Pous' recommendation should be rejected for a variety of\nreasons. The Southern California Edison-based opinions regarding longer life for the conductor,\nrelied on by Mr. Pous, relate to plant installed less than ten years ago. Therefore, based on his own\ntheory, much of the investment in question in this account is still the older, shorter-lived variety, and\nhis recommendations are premature. Moreover, Mr. Watson's plotting of the dispersion curves show\n\n\n495\n      Id. at 32, 33-35.\n496\n      Cities Ex. 5C (Pous Depreciation Study) at 41.\n497\n      ETI Ex. 13 (Watson Direct) at Ex.

That is a\nsignificant flaw in his analysis. Similarly, his reliance on the Southern California Edison-based\nopinions relate to newer plant, which again calls his analysis into question in the present\ncircumstances. The Al.J s recommend that the Commission approve ETI' s recommended service life\nof 35 Rl.5.\n\n\n                   (v) Account 368 - Line Transformers\n\n           The Commission approved anticipated service life is 39 years. 500 Mr. Watson proposed a\nservice life of 29 Ll ,501 with which Ms. Mathis agreed. Mr. Watson stated that this is consistent with\nthe data showing decreasing lives for these assets, the expected lives per Company personnel, and the\nfact that transformers are junked or sold rather than repaired. 502\n\n\n           Mr. Pous recommended that the expected service life be decreased to 33 years, representing a\n15 percent reduction in the anticipated service life. Mr. Pous stated that his analysis is based on\nactuarial analyses and the Company's addition of approximately $80 million of pad mounted\ntransformers since the last case, when the Commission approved a 39-year anticipated average\nservice life. According to Mr. Pous, ETI personnel have stated that pole mounted transformers have\na life of between 25 and 35 years. However, pad mounted transformers are expected to last up to\n40 years by the same Company personnel. Given the sizable investment since the last case in the pad\nmounted transformers with a longer expected service life, a decrease in the anticipated service life of\n\n\n499\n      ETI Ex. 71 (Watson Rebuttal) at 40.\n500\n      Cities Ex.

Moreover, Mr. Pous stated his\nanalysis uncovered abnormally high retirement ratios in the 21.5 to 22.5 year age brackets indicative\nof one-time events such as the ice storm or changes in accounting systems. As such, Mr. Pous\nperformed his curve fitting analysis recognizing the unusually high retirement activity between years\n21.5 and 22.5 rather than emphasizing such unusual activity as Mr. Watson did for his proposal to\nreduce service life by 26 percent. 503\n\n\n            Mr. Watson recommended a decline in average service life from a 39-year anticipated service\nlife to a 29-year anticipated service life citing the high occurrence of lightning in the ETI service\narea. 504 However, Mr. Pous noted that the effects of lightning in ETI' s service area would have been\npresent in ETI's last base rate case when a 39-year anticipated service life was approved by the\nCommission. Both Mr. Watson and Mr. Pous recognized that the pad mounted transformers are not\nsubject to the same forces of retirement like weather, lightning, and animal disturbances. 505\nHowever, Mr. Watson did not realistically factor ETI's relative increased investment in pad mounted\ntransformers into his analysis. Moreover, when performing his curve fitting analysis, Mr. Watson\nneither analyzed nor adjusted for the abnormal unusual retirement ratios between years 21.5 and\n22.5. 506 Instead, Mr. Watson attempted to select a life analysis that anticipates a high level of\nretirement within that time period in the future. sm Cities argue that, by failing to recognize the\nsizable new investment in pad mounted transformers and failing to consider the unusual retirement\nratios, Mr. Watson proposed an average service life that is lower than the bottom end of the range of\nlife estimates of Company personnel for pad mounted transformers. Moreover, Mr. Watson's\nproposal does not even reach the midpoint of life estimates expected by Company personnel for pole\nmounted transformers.\n\n\n\n\n503\n      Cities Ex. 5C (Pous Depreciation Study) at 45.\n504\n      ETI Ex. 13 (Watson Direct) at Ex DAW-1 at 50.\n505   Id.\n506\n      Cities Ex. 5C (Pous Depreciation Study) at 47.\n507\n      ETIEx.13 (WatsonDirect)atExDAW-1 at50-51.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                              PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE149\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          The arguments and evidence advanced by Cities witness Pous are persuasive to the ALl s.\nMr. Watson's contention regarding the occurrences of lightening in the ETI service area was equally\napplicable at the time the existing approved rate was set, and is, therefore, of little value in this\nproceeding. Further, Mr. Watson's failure to analyze the abnormal retirement ratios between years\n21.5 and 22.5 also argues against his analysis. The ALls recommend that the Commission adopt\nMr. Pous' proposed life of 33 L0.5.\n\n\n                  (vi) Account 369.1-0verhead Services\n\n          The Commission previously approved anticipated service life for this account is 36 years.508\nMr. Watson's analysis of this account shows that overhead assets have retired earlier and have been\nreplaced more frequently than is consistent with the existing 36 S4 life. The average age of current\ninvestment is 10.12 years. Consistent with this data and his review of various curves and placement\nand experience bands, he recommended shortening the life to 26 L4. Ms. Mathis agrees with this\nproposal. 509\n\n\n          Mr. Pous recommended that the expected service life be shortened to 33 years based on the\nlack of Company historical data and based on comparative utility experience including recent studies\nby Mr. Watson, where he proposed significantly longer average service lives. Mr. Pous testified that\nan evaluation of the actual data casts serious doubt about the reliability of the data for depreciation\npurposes. ETI does not have any records of services in this subaccount surviving past 1978.\nMr. Pous stated that his recommended 33-year life expectancy for this sub-account is still far shorter\nthan industry expectations, but is consistent with the depreciation study recently conducted for EGSL\nwhere the depreciation expert hired by EGSL recommended a 33-year life. 510\n\n\n          ETI argues that Mr. Pous apparently made no attempt to perform any curve fitting regarding\nthis account, as none appears in his study; in the absence of performing this essential analysis, he\n\n\n508\n      Cities Ex.

ETI contends that, in\nreality, Mr. Pous appears to present no recommendation for this account based on evaluation of any\nof the accounting data that actually depicts the past and current characteristics of the assets. 511\n\n\n          ETI argues that its recommended life is clearly supported by the Company-specific data,\ngraphically depicted in Mr. Watson's rebuttal testimony, while Mr. Pous' suggested life parameter is\nnot even close, and is based on unsupported speculation. 512\n\n\n          Although the evidence on this issue is sparse, the ALls ultimately are persuaded that ETI's\n(and Staffs) position is more reasonable. Accordingly, the AUs recommend the Commission adopt\nETI' s proposed 26 L4 life span.\n\n\n                         (b) Net Salvage Value\n\n          Staff disagrees with Mr. Watson's recommendations for five of the distribution accounts, and\nMr. Pous disagrees regarding two of the accounts.

Mr. Watson and Mr. Pous, on the other hand, proposed a salvage value of\nnegative 10 percent.\n\n\n\n511\n      Id. at 48-50.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE 151\nPUC'DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          Mr. Watson's recommendation is based on the most recent five-year and ten-year net salvage\nratios, which are negative 9.70 percent and negative 36.70 percent, respectively. Ms. Mathis'\nrecommendation is based on analysis of historical salvage data for the period of 1984 through 2010.\nSpecifically, the two-year moving average median for the same period produces a net salvage rate of\nnegative 5.87 percent, which is very close to the currently approved net salvage rate for this\naccount. 513 Moreover, the one-year, three-year, four-year, five-year, six-year, and seven-year moving\naverage      medians      of    negative 6.95 percent,   negative 5.11 percent,   negative 3.64 percent,\nnegative 1.90 percent, negative 4.57 percent, and negative 7.24 percent, respectively, support this\nrecommendation.          Additionally, this account contains a few significant outliers, such as\nnegative 655.91 percent in 2002 and negative 322.55 percent in 2005. 514 Ms. Mathis' use of the\nmedian average eliminates the skewing effect of these outlying values.\n\n\n          As discussed in Section VII.C.l, the use of the median is the most appropriate methodology.\nFor this reason, the AUs recommend the Commission approve Staffs proposed negative 5 percent\nnet salvage value.\n\n\n                   (ii) Account 362 - Station Equipment\n\n          The existing net salvage value of this account is positive 15 percent. Mr. Watson proposed\nthat it be changed to negative 20 percent, Staff proposes it be changed to negative 10 percent, and\nCities propose it be changed to zero.\n\n\n          Mr. Watson's study shows that the most recent five-year and ten-year net salvage ratios are\nnegative 22.10 percent and negative 43.55 percent, respectively.           He recommended negative\n20 percent net salvage based on the Company's experience. 515\n\n\n\n\n512\n      ETI Ex. 71 (Watson Rebuttal) at 46-48.\n513\n      Staff Ex. 2 (Mathis Direct) at 27.\n514\n      Id. at Appendix C at 4.\n515\n      ETI Ex. 13 (Watson Direct) at Ex.

Specifically, the recommendation is supported by the two-year moving average\nmedian for the same period of negative 12.23 percent.516 Moreover, the one-year, three-year,\nfive-year, six-year, seven-year, and eight-year moving average medians of negative 11.07 percent,\nnegative 14.16 percent, negative 7.62 percent, negative 8.19 percent, negative 11.75 percent, and\nnegative 14.15 percent, respectively, support her recommendation. 517\n\n\n           Mr. Pous' recommendation is based on what he characterizes as the Company's actual,\nunadjusted, experience; recognition of the type of investment in the account; recognition of\nsignificant value of scrap copper; investigation of retirement mix compared to investment mix over\nthe past ten years; and recognition of industry values. 518 According to Mr. Pous, given the\nsignificant increase in the value of copper, the retirement of a transformer could be expected to\nsignificantly influence the net salvage value for this account.\n\n\n           Mr. Pous' recommendation is the outlier among the three before the ALls, and the ALls are\nnot convinced that the reasons put forth by Mr. Pous in support of his position are sufficient to carry\nthe day. The real argument here is between ETI and Staff, which centers on the use of the median\n(Staff) and the mean (ETI). As discussed in Section VII.C.l, the use of the median is the most\nappropriate methodology. For this reason, the ALls recommend the Commission approve Staff's\nproposed negative 10 percent net salvage value.\n\n\n                   (iii) Account 365 - Overhead Conductors and Devices\n\n           The current net salvage value for this account is positive 10 percent. 519 ETI and Staff\nrecommend changing it to negative seven percent, and Cities recommend changing it to zero.\n\n\n\n\n516\n      Staff Ex. 2 (Mathis Direct) at 27.\n511\n      Id. at Appendix C at 4-5.\n518\n      Cities Ex.

Mr. Pous\nnoted that $40 million of investment recorded in this account is associated with clearing rights of\nway, which will not likely be retired or incur cost of removal or gross salvage. Another $40 million\nis associated with investment in copper conductors, which has escalated in demand in recent years\nand should result in positive net salvage. 520\n\n\n          Mr. Watson corrected his analysis and recognized that timing differences between the\nrecording of accounting adjustments related to net salvage (i.e., salvage and removal costs for a\nparticular transaction were not recorded at the same time) made one of the recent years less\nrepresentative of reasonably expected ongoing net salvage levels. He focused, therefore, on longer\nperiod averages and recommends negative seven percent net salvage consistent with the most recent\nten-year ratios. 521 Mr. Watson explained that his adjustments removed relocation activity altogether\nfrom this account because it is not characteristic of the vast majority of retirements and because, if\nthe adjustment is not made, it will shorten and skew the life analysis. Further, Mr. Watson stated\nthat Mr. Pous' claims regarding the impact of copper prices ignore those prices' future volatility and\nare not supported by any analysis or quantification specific to these accounts. Mr. Watson indicated\nthat his recommendations are based on the most clear and reliable source - Company-specific\naccounting data - not \"selective comparisons of industry norms,\" as alleged by Mr. Pous. 522\n\n\n          The AUs find Mr. Watson's explanations of the rationale behind his analysis to be both\ncredible and convincing. Accordingly, the AUs recommend the Commission adopt ETI's requested\nnegative 7 percent net salvage value.\n\n\n\n\n520\n      Id. at 28-29.\n521\n      ET1Ex.13(WatsonDirect)atEx.DAW-l at69.\n522\n      ETI Ex. 71 (Watson Rebuttal) at 68-69.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                             PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE 154\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n                  (iv) Account 368 - Line Transformers\n\n          The existing net salvage value for this account is zero, which both Mr. Watson and Mr. Pous\nrecommended be retained. Ms. Mathis, on the other hand, argued that the net salvage value should\nbe changed to negative five percent.\n\n\n          The argument here is whether the median or the mean best represents the appropriate net\nsalvage value. ETI argues for the mean, and Staff argues for the median. As discussed in\nSection VIl.C.1, the use of the median is the most appropriate methodology. For this reason, the\nAl.J s recommend the Commission approve Staff's proposed negative five percent net salvage value.\n\n\n                  (v) Account 369.1-0verhead Services\n\n          The existing net salvage value for this account is negative 10 percent, which Staff\nrecommends be retained.

Because of the limited available data, Ms. Mathis recommended retaining the existing\nnegative 10 percent net salvage. 524\n\n\n          The AUs agree with Staff that because of the limited retirement activity, a reasonable net\nsalvage rate cannot be calculated from the historical salvage data.           Accordingly, the AUs\nrecommend the Commission adopt the negative 10 percent net salvage value proposed by Staff.\n\n\n          S. General Plant\n\n          General plant includes some accounts that are subject to depreciation, and some that are\nsubject to amortization. ETI proposes to adopt \"Vintage Group Amortization,\" consistent with\nFERC Rule AR-15 for Accounts 391-397.1 and Account 398. This approach, approved by both the\nFERC and the Commission (Docket No. 38339), does not affect the annual level of expense, but\nprovides for timely retirement of assets and simplifies accounting for general property. 525\nMs. Mathis concurred in the Company's proposal to adopt Vintage Group Amortization and with its\nrecommendations for lives, amortization periods, and net salvage. 526\n\n\n          The increase in expense for general plant proposed by ETI is due to the need to reduce the\ndeficit in the general plant reserve caused by inadequate account level rates in the past. 527 This is a\nmatter of debate among the parties, as discussed in more detail below.\n\n\n                       (a) Account 390 - Structures and Improvements (Life Parameter)\n\n          Based on his analysis of the data in comparison to various potential dispersion curves,\nMr. Watson recommended an increase in the life of this account to 45 R2. 528 Ms. Mathis agreed with\nthis life.

Mr. Pous concluded that\n\"superstructures and roadways\" are a significant element in the account which can be expected to\nhave a long life. 529\n\n\n          ETI contends that Mr. Pous' analysis is incorrect. First, as confirmed by his workpapers,\nMr. Watson conducted an analysis of five bands, not a single band as alleged by Mr. Pous.\nFurthermore, Mr. Pous' argument regarding long lives, based on the idea that the investment dates\nback to 1927, is contrary to the actual data showing a minute amount of old investment (0.02 percent\nof the account) dating back only to 1939. The average age of investment in the account, however, is\nonly 15.87 years. Mr. Watson explained that the actual data shows no investment has achieved a life\nof 85 years, as alleged by Cities. 530\n\n\n          The AI.Js believe that the actuarial analysis and curve fitting shown in Mr. Watson's direct\nand rebuttal testimony demonstrate a more reasonable approach, as recognized by Staff witness\nMathis.      Therefore, the AI.Js recommend the Commission adopt the 45 R2 life parameter\nrecommended by ETI.\n\n\n                        (b) Account 390-Structures and Improvements (Net Salvage Value)\n\n          Account 390 is a depreciable account for structures and improvements. Though the current\nauthorized net salvage is zero, Mr. Watson recommended a negative five percent net salvage value,\nand Staff agrees with this recommendation. Mr. Pous recommended a positive 15 percent net\nsalvage value.\n\n\n          Mr. Watson based his recommendation on the most recent five-year and ten-year ratios,\nwhich are negative 1.51 percent and negative 34.27 percent. 531 Mr. Pous disagreed, arguing that:\n(1) Mr. Watson's data adjustments present an incorrect picture of the salvage history; and\n\n\n529\n      Cities Ex.

Such data\nshows that negative net salvage has occurred in every period of the most recent ten-year moving\naverage.       Averages of six years or longer range from negative 4.56 percent to negative\n34.27 percent. 533 ETI also argues that Mr. Pous' attempt to use sales of facilities as an element of\ndepreciation analysis is contrary to Commission precedent regarding building sales 'and that his\nopinion is contrary to the facts that such sales are unique circumstances that do not reasonably\nrepresent the ongoing year-to-year retirement activity that should form the basis of depreciation\nanalysis.\n\n\n          The ALls find that Mr. Pous' arguments are not supported by the facts and that Mr. Watson's\nexplanations are the more credible. Accordingly, the ALls recommend the Commission adopt ETI's\nproposed negative five percent net salvage value for this account.\n\n\n                       (c) General Plant Reserve Deficiency\n\n          A $21.3 million deficit has developed over time in the reserve for the accounts that ETI\nproposes should be converted to General Plant Amortization. This deficit, or under-recovery, has\noccurred because assets have been retired more quickly than can be addressed by the existing\namortization rate. ETI, therefore, proposes a $2.1 million annual expense level to recover the deficit\nover ten years. 534 Ms. Mathis recommended that the amortization of the reserve deficiency be\nrejected and that the deficit be recovered through application of the remaining life method to the\nindividual accounts where the deficit occurred. 535\n\n\n\n532\n      Cities Ex. 5C (Pous Depreciation Study) at 3 L\n533\n      ETI Ex. 71 (Watson Rebuttal) at 73-74.\n534\n      ETI Ex. 13 (Watson Direct) at Ex.

During her cross examination,\nMs. Mathis agreed that she had intended to take the elements of the remaining life calculation\n                                                                     536\nmethod exclusively from Mr. Watson's depreciation study.                   ETI contends that she failed to pull\nthe correct values from Mr. Watson's study and her numbers did not match the corresponding entries\nfrom Mr. Watson's study. 537 For example, Ms. Mathis affirmed that her remaining life calculations\nwere intended to allow recovery of the remaining investment in general plant account 391.2. The\n                                                                                                       538\nremaining investment she provided for was $10.9 million of an original cost of $21.7 million.                The\nactual remaining investment in the account, however, as shown in the data she purported to rely on,\nwas a credit balance of negative $4.4 million, meaning that not only the original cost, but\n$4.4 million additional investment remained unrecovered. 539 Ms. Mathis had no explanation for the\ndifference. In fact, it appears that she erroneously substituted the theoretical reserve for the account\nin Mr. Watson's study ($10.789 million) as the actual book reserve, resulting in an erroneous\n                                                     540\ncalculation of the amount yet to be recovered.             Mr. Watson's rebuttal points out the errors in the\ncalculation and provides an exhibit to properly reflect the remaining life approach that Ms. Mathis\nintended. 541\n\n\n          However, Mr. Watson's rebuttal also explained the reasons that the Company's approach is\nbetter. By using a ten-year amortization period for the deficit, ETI lowers the annual amount of the\nexpense in rates to $2.1 million. Once Ms. Mathis' calculation is corrected, because the remaining\nlives through which the asset value is recovered are so short, 'her remaining life approach increases\nthe annual expense of amortization to $5.8 million. Given the significant level of expense involved,\nETI personnel had asked Mr. Watson to moderate the remaining life approach in this instance by\n\n536\n      Tr. at 1752-1753.\n537\n      Tr. at 1746-1759.\n538\n      Tr. at 1754; Staff Ex. 2 (Mathis Direct) at Ex.

Moreover, although Ms. Mathis purports to rely on the Commission's\ndecision in Docket No. 38339 in support of her proposal, that case includes no discussion of\nrejecting the proposal on general plant that Mr. Watson makes here. 542\n\n\n          The AUs have reviewed the evidence cited by both parties and the testimony offered in\nsupport of their respective positions. It is clear to the AUs that Ms. Mathis inadvertently did exactly\nwhat ETI alleges - she got numbers confused and, in so doing, confused her analysis. The AUs find\nthat ETI' s proposed $2.1 million annual expense level to recover the deficit over ten years be\napproved by the Commission.\n\n\n                       (d) Amortization Period for Account 391.2-Computer Equipment\n\n          Mr. Pons challenged the amortization period for this account, contending, contrary to Staff\nand Mr. Watson, that the Company's proposal to amortize general plant using ..Vintage Group\nAmortization\" is not consistent with FERC pronouncement AR-15. ETI argues that Mr. Pous'\ncritique is wrong because the five-year life of which Mr. Pons complains is based on standard life\nanalysis.      The life has nothing to do with AR-15, which does not determine such matters.\nMr. Watson's study clearly explains that he based the life parameter on standard actuarial analysis. 543\n\n\n          According to ETI, Mr. Pons' own recommendation points out the fallacy of his arguments\nabout AR-15. He recommended a one-year increase in the amortization, which does not match the\nprevious period of depreciation for this account, or the previous depreciation rate, despite that being\nthe supposed flaw in Mr. Watson's approach. 544 Mr. Watson explained that the use of AR-15 does\nnot involve any independent tinkering with the life of the asset account because the AR-15 process\n\n\n\n\n542\n      Id. at 80-81.\n543\n      ETI Ex. 13 (Watson Direct) at Ex.

FERC pronouncement AR-15\nrequires amortization over the same life as recommended based on standard life analysis.\nMr. Watson's study employed standard life analysis to ascertain the recommended five-year life.\nThe ALls therefore recommend the Commission adopt the five-year life proposed by ETI.\n\n\n           6. Fully Accrued Depreciation\n\n           Mr. Pous claimed that the Company has failed to conform its Commission-authorized\ndepreciation rates when it stops accruing depreciation on accounts and sub-accounts that are fully\naccrued. He testified that the Company must continue to depreciate such accounts, despite the fact\nthat this policy would mandate that the Company intentionally create negative depreciation amounts\nthat do not relate to the existence of any depreciable asset still in existence. Mr. Pous testified that\nneither standard depreciation definitions nor GAAP or National Association of Regulatory Utility\nCommissioners (NARUC) depreciation guidance support the Company's action. 546 The impact of\nMr. Pous' recommendation is to impute an additional $6,447,731 depreciation amount to reduce rate\nbase and amortize that credit over four years, with an associated revenue requirement reduction of\n                   547\n$1,611,933.\n\n\n           ETI argues that Mr. Pous pointed to no instance in which his theory has been adopted by the\nCommission, or any other regulatory body. Other regulators within the Entergy system have rejected\nhis position. 548 The RRC, which sets gas utility rates under essentially the same regulatory\nframework as PURA, has rejected Mr. Pous' position on three separate occasions. 549 ETI contends\nthat Mr. Pous' suggestion violates GAAP, which requires that once an asset's service value (original\n\n545\n      ETI Ex. 13 (Watson Direct) at Ex.

This has been ETI' s practice as\nlong as ETI regulatory accounting witness Considine has been aware. Furthermore, ETI suspends\ndepreciation only so long as the account is fully amortized. Once additional activity hits the account,\ndepreciation will begin again under the Company's automated systems. 550\n\n\n          ETI also argues that Mr. Pous' retroactive approach is unreasonably selective. He would\nreach back into recoveries under existing rates to reclaim revenues associated with the depreciation\nexpense that relates to the fully accrued accounts. According to ETI, Mr. Pous takes no notice of the\ndepreciation taken on new assets that are not included in rate base or recovered through depreciation\nexpense under existing rates. ETI witness Considine notes that Mr. Pous has essentially formulated a\none-sided exact recovery mechanism for depreciation expense that is completely unique in the annals\nof base rates. 551\n\n\n          According to ETI, Mr. Pous also ignores that the remaining life depreciation method already\naddresses any over- or under-accrual of depreciation expense. As depreciation rates and the\nremaining life are adjusted over time, any over (under) recovery will be carried forward and the net\n(if any) of the original investment less any accumulated reserve will begin to be recovered under the\n\nnew and future rate structures. This is the basic concept of remaining life depreciation rates. Thus,\n                                                                        552\nETI contends that no further actions or adjustments are appropriate.\n\n\n          The AUs find that Mr. Pous' recommendation has previously been rejected, by other\nregulatory bodies. There is nothing in the arguments advanced by Cities that changes that fact.\nAccordingly, the AUs recommend the Commission reject Cities' proposal.\n\n\n\n\n550\n      ETI Ex. 46 (Considine Rebuttal) at 44-45, 47.\n551\n      Id. at 43, 45.\n552\n      ETI Ex. 71 (Watson Rebuttal) at 78.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE 162\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n           7. Other Depreciation Issues - Accumulated Provision for Depreciation\n\n           ETI proposes to amortize the $21 million general plant deficiency over ten years. Both the\nCities and Staff agree with and use the accumulated depreciation reserve amounts per account from\nMr. Watson's study. 553 TIEC witness Pollock, in arguing against amortization of the amortized\ngeneral plant reserve deficiency, testified that this reserve deficiency should instead be simply\nreallocated to other depreciable general plant accounts that have depreciation surplus. 554\n\n\n           Mr. Pollock discussed transferring the depreciation reserve between the amortizable and\ndepreciable general plant accounts. He failed to show, however, how the reserve reallocation would\nbe computed and provided no workpapers to substantiate his analysis. ETI argues that without a\nverifiable basis for the computations, his recommendations to recompute general plant depreciation\naccruals should be rejected.\n\n\n           ETI also argues that Mr. Pollock's testimony shows that he has reallocated the amortizable\ngeneral plant deficiency from the amortized general plant accounts to the depreciable general plant\naccounts. The depreciable plant accounts have shorter remaining lives than the ten-year amortization\nof the deficiency proposed by ETI. 555 ETI contends that common sense dictates that transferring\ndollars from an account with a relatively longer remaining life to one with a shorter life will yield a\nhigher annual depreciation or amortization expense, yet Mr. Pollock somehow takes this step and\nstill arrives at a lower level of expense.\n\n\n           According to ETI, Mr. Pollock's methodology has the effect of \"amortizing the difference\nbetween the book and theoretical reserve over a time period that is significantly shorter than the\naverage remaining life of the assets within this function.\" 556 ETI asserts that such an adjustment to\n\n\n\n\n553\n      Id. at 77.\n554\n      TIEC Ex. 1 (Pollock Direct) at 38-39.\n555\n      ETI Ex. 13 (Watson Rebuttal) at Ex.

Rather, TIEC states\nthat it is proposing a more efficient method for ETI to cure its deficits. Because ETI retired\nequipment prior to the end of the assumed life of those assets, there is approximately a $21,300,000\ndeficiency in general plant accounts. ETI seeks to amortize the deficiency over ten years so that the\nbook reserve will \"catch-up\" with the theoretical depreciation reserve for the deficient reserve. TIEC\ncontends that its position is that the catch-up adjustment is not necessary. 558\n\n\n          The ALJs have reviewed the evidence and arguments advanced by the parties and find that\nthose of ETI are more persuasive. Accordingly, the ALJs recommend the Commission reject TIEC' s\nrecommendation.\n\n\nD.        Labor Costs\n\n          1. Payroll and Related Adjustments\n\n          A number of parties suggest various adjustments to ETI' s proposed payroll and related costs.\nIn the application, ETI' s Test Year payroll costs were adjusted downward by $957 ,695 to reflect a\ndecrease in the employee headcount levels at ETI during the Test Year. At the same time, payroll\ncosts were increased in the amount of $1, 105,871 to account for employee pay raises. The net result\nwas that ETI's Test Year payroll expense was adjusted upward by $148,176. Similar calculations\nwere made for ESI employees, resulting in a net upward adjustment for ESI payroll expenses of\n$852,493. Thus, ETI requested an upward adjustment of $1,000,669 ($148,176 plus $852,493) for\nETI and ESI payroll expenses. 559\n\n\n\n\n557\n      Id. at 75-76.\n558\n      TIEC Ex. 1 (Pollock Direct) at 37.\n559\n      ETI Ex. 8 (Considine Direct) at 24-25; 3 at Sched.

As noted above, ETI is proposing an\nupward adjustment to account for pay raises given to ETI and ESI employees. One set of those raises\nwas given to employees in early August 2011, one month after the end of the Test Year. Another set\nof raises was given to employees in April 2012, roughly nine months after the end of the Test Year.\nCities witness Garrett testified that it is acceptable to make an adjustment for the raises made in\nAugust 2011 because they occurred shortly after the end of the Test Year. However, he stated that it\nis unreasonable to include an adjustment for the raises given in April 2012. He believes that any\nincrease in costs due to the April 2012 pay raises might be offset by changes in productivity and the\noverall workforce that may occur during the same time period, such as the replacement of higher-\npaid workers who retire with new, lower paid employees. 560 Thus, Cities propose an adjustment that\nwould reverse ETI's proposed increase for the April 2012 pay raises thereby reducing payroll\nexpense by $1,185,811. 561 No other party makes a similar challenge to the April 2012 pay raise.\n\n\n           With regard to the adjustments proposed by ETI, Staff witness Givens accepted the\nadjustments for headcount changes and the pay raises, but recommended a further downward\nadjustment of $778,034 to account for a further decrease in ETI employee headcount levels from 678\nat Test Year-end to 660 as of February 2012. She also recommended an upward adjustment of\n$158,589 to account for an increase in ESI employee headcount levels from 3,055 to 3,089 as of\nDecember 2011. 562 Ms. Givens also recommended that, in addition to adjusting payroll expense\nlevels, the more recent headcount numbers should be used to adjust the level of payroll tax expenses,\nbenefits expenses, and savings plan expenses. 563 As an alternative to its primary line of attack\n(discussed above), Cities agree with the adjustments recommended by Staff.\n\n\n           ETI also agrees, in concept, with the adjustments recommended by Staff, but contends that\nMs. Givens made some errors in her calculations. First, according to ETI, Ms. Givens used\nerroneous headcounts for the end of the Test Year for ETI and ESL According to the Company,\n\n56\n  ° Cities Ex. 2 (Garrett Direct) at 13-15.\n561\n      Id. at 19.\n562\n      Staff Ex.

Ms. Givens wrongly used\nheadcounts of 678 and 3,055, respectively, which caused a double counting of three ETI employees\nand one ESI employee. 564 Second, Ms. Givens made an error in the calculation of benefits costs\nassociated with the updated ESI headcount. Ms. Givens inadvertently used the ETI percentage in the\ncalculation rather than the ESI percentage shown on her exhibit. 565 Third, Ms. Givens' adjustment\nfor savings plan expense was not necessary and is thus inappropriate. According to ETI witness\nConsidine, savings plan expense is already included in benefits expense levels so it would be double\ncounting to adjust for both benefits expense and savings plan expense. 566 Fourth, Ms. Givens'\nfull-time equivalent calculations need to be corrected. She included an incorrect assumption\nregarding part time employee salaries. Ms. Givens assumed that a part time employee's average\nsalary is 50 percent of the full time average salary. In his rebuttal testimony, Mr. Considine provided\nthe correct calculation of full time equivalents, thereby making it unnecessary to rely upon an\nassumed average. 567 According to Mr. Considine, the combined impacts of these errors is that\nMs. Givens' ETI headcount adjustment overstated her O&M payroll reduction by $224,217, and her\n                                                                                          568\nESI headcount adjustment understated her O&M payroll increase by $37,531.                       No party\nchallenged these corrected numbers.\n\n\n            The Al.J s are unpersuaded by Cities' attempt to exclude the April 2012 pay raises. There can\nbe no real dispute about the fact that the pay raises are known and measurable. Moreover, there is an\nobvious logical inconsistency in the Cities' position - on the one hand they oppose consideration of\ncertain pay raises because they fall outside the Test Year, and on the other hand they support\nconsideration of headcount reductions even though they also fall well outside the Test Year.\n\n\n            The ALls are also persuaded that, conceptually, the adjustments suggested by Staff are\nreasonable and appropriate. Indeed, all parties agree on this point. Moreover, no party challenged\n\n564\n      ETI Ex. 46 (Considine Rebuttal) at 32-33.\n565\n      Id. at 33.\n566   Id.\n567\n      Id. at 34.\n568\n      Id. at MPC-R-5, and MPC-R-6.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                       PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE 166\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nthe corrections to Staff's adjustments that were suggested by ETI, and the AU s can find no basis for\nchallenging those corrections. Thus, the AU s recommend that the Commission: ( 1) accept the\npayroll adjustments proposed in the ETI application~ and (2) accept the further payroll adjustments\nproposed by Staff, corrected by ETI.\n\n\n          2. Incentive Compensation\n\n          One of the hotly contested issues concerns the extent to which ETI should be allowed to\nrecover, through its rates, the incentive compensation it pays to its employees. All parties agree that\nCommission precedent generally identifies two types of incentive compensation, only one of which\nis recoverable. Specifically, pursuant to Commission precedent, incentive compensation that is tied\nto operational goals is recoverable, while incentive compensation that is tied to financial goals is\nnot. 569 In its application, however, ETI requests that it be allowed to recover its Test Year costs of\nall of its incentive compensation costs, regardless of whether those costs are tied to operational goals\nor to financial goals.\n\n\n                       (a) Financially Based Incentive Compensation Should Not Be Recoverable\n\n          ETI acknowledges that costs of incentive compensation tied to financial goals have typically\nbeen disallowed by the Commission. However, ETI asks for the Commission to reconsider its\nprecedents on this issue. 570 ETI argues that the Commission precedent is not, and should not be, a\nhard and fast rule. ETI contends that the reason why cost recovery has been denied for incentive\ncompensation in prior rates cases is that, in those prior cases, there was \"a lack of evidence showing\nsufficient customer benefits.\"571 ETI asserts that, in this case, it has assembled evidence not\npreviously considered by the Commission that shows the benefits to customers of using financial\n\n\n\n569\n    See, e.g.,TIBC Initial Brief at 51-52; see also AEP Application of AEP Texas Central Company for\nAuthority to Change Rates, See Docket No. 33309, Order on Rehearing at FoF 82 (Mar. 4, 2007); Application\nof AEP Texas Central Company for Authority to Change Rates, Docket No. 28840, Order at FoF 164-170\n(Aug. 15, 2005).\n570\n      Tr. at 1726.\n571\n      ETI Initial Brief at 129.\n\fSOAHDOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE 167\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nmeasures in incentive compensation programs.               For example, ETI argues that incentive\ncompensation that encourages the financial health of a company also benefits customers because:\n\n\n           (1)     if a company maintains a financially healthy position, it will tend to have a\n                   lower cost of capital that will in tum benefit customers through lower rates;\n           (2)     a financially healthy company will be more prepared for emergency events\n                   such as storms (which is particularly important in the Gulf Coast areas served\n                   by ETI, which are subject to experiencing hurricanes); and\n           (3)     with financial health, the costs of doing business with suppliers (of both\n                   goods and services, including labor) will remain lower because, for example,\n                   if a company was not in a financially stable condition, suppliers would tend\n                   to demand higher prices or more onerous credit terms, resulting in higher\n                   costs that would lead to higher rates than would otherwise occur.\n\n\n           ETI witness Kevin Gardner, Vice President of Human Resources for ESI, testified that\ncustomers receive benefits from those portions of the incentive compensation plans that are tied to\nfinancial goals and measures. He explained that incentive compensation based on financial metrics\nis a reasonable, necessary, and common component of compensation for companies like ETI. He\nalso opined that such incentives are a market necessity that ETI must include in its compensation\npackage so that it can hire and retain talented employees. He contended that customers benefit from\nthe incentives because they attract and keep qualified people. 572 Mr. Gardner further testified that\ndisallowing financially-based incentives would only encourage utilities to eliminate them, thus\nweakening the alignment of employees' financial interests with the interest of the ratepayers in\nhaving an efficiently run and financially healthy utility. He opined that having only operational\nincentives could encourage utilities to overspend in some areas resulting in an incomplete,\nunbalanced incentive program that would be atypical when compared with American industry in\ngeneral. 573\n\n\n           A second ETI witness, Dr. Jay Hartzell, also testified in favor of the concept of allowing ETI\nto recover its costs associated with its financially-based incentive compensation. He is a professor of\n\n\n572\n      ETI Ex. 36 (Gardner Direct) at 31.\n573\n      Id. at 32.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                         PAGE 168\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nfinance in the business school at the University of Texas at Austin. Dr. Hartzell acknowledged the\nhistorical distinction that has been made by the Commission between compensation tied to financial\nmeasures and compensation tied to operational measures. However, he argues that this distinction is\nbased upon a \"false dichotomy\" and that the more appropriate focus should be on whether customers\nbenefit from the incentive in question, regardless of whether it is a financial or operational\nincentive. 574 Dr. Hartzell summarized his key opinion as follows:\n\n\n           In my opm1on, a well-designed compensation plan that includes incentive\n           compensation tied to cost controls, profitability, and stock prices would tend to\n           provide greater benefits to customers than an otherwise similar compensation plan\n           that did not include any such incentive compensation. 575\n\n           Dr. Hartzell argues that compensation linked to stock prices (provided it is part of a\nreasonable, well-designed compensation plan) has four advantages for customers, :\n\n\n•     helps ensure that managers will consider the financial health of the company when they make\n      decisions, and it is in customers' interests for the company be fmancially healthy;\n•     provides an incentive for managers and employees to ensure that the company operates\n      efficiently, resulting in lower rates than would otherwise occur;\n•     provides a monitoring mechanism for managerial decision-making and the overall quality of\n      management; and\n•     results in lower customer costs because capital markets will tend to reward efficient long-term\n      investments or capital expenditures. 576\n\nDr. Hartzell cited a number of studies which support the theory that the benefits of incentive\ncompensation linked to stock price and profitability measures extend to customers of the company,\nsuch as by lowering the company's cost of capital, increasing the company's ability to respond to\n\n\n\n\n574\n      ETI Ex. 15 (Hartzell Direct) at 3-4, 6, and 9-10.\n575\n      Id. at 7.\n576\n      Id. at 13-14.\n\fSOAR DOCKET N O . -                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                 PAGE 169\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nexternal shocks, improving customer satisfaction, and increasing oversight on managerial\ndecisions. 577\n\n\n          Conversely, Dr. Hartzell opined that if the use of incentive compensation linked to\nprofitability and stock prices is discouraged, via Commission policy disallowing recovery of the\ncosts of such compensation, then utility customers would be adversely affected. For example, if\nemployees did not receive any incentive compensation, salaries would have to be higher to attract\nand retain the same quality of talent. Dr. Hartzell also testified that a compensation plan solely\nconsisting of salary and incentives based on operational performance could likely lead to \"horizon\nproblems,\" meaning that, absent incentives to focus on the long run health of the company, managers\nmight maximize their immediate compensation at the expense of longer-run benefits that the\ncustomer could have enjoyed. 578\n\n\n          All of the other parties oppose ETI' s efforts to recover the costs of its incentive compensation\ntied to financial goals. The parties uniformly agree that the Commission has a well-established and\nstraightforward policy regarding the recoverability of incentive compensation through rates:\nincentive compensation that is tied to operational goals is recoverable; incentive compensation tied\nto financial goals is not. 579 They contend that ETI' s position in this case flies directly in the face of\nthat policy. TIEC points out that ETI has offered no legal authority, such as a statute or rule, which\nwould justify its desire to have the Commission reverse its policy and allow the recovery of incentive\ncompensation tied to financial goals. State Agencies similarly argue that ETI failed to establish a\nreason why the Commission should deviate from its long-standing policy. The parties also support\nthe reasoning behind the Commission's policy: that financially-based incentives are of more\nimmediate benefit to shareholders, not ratepayers, and therefore are not necessary and reasonable for\nthe provision of service.\n\n577\n      ETI Ex. 15 (Hartzell Direct) at 15-21.\n578\n      Id. at 22-25.\n579\n    TIEC Reply Brief at 35; State Agencies Initial Brief at 14; OPC Reply Brief at 12; Staff Initial Brief at 56;\nCities Initial Brief at 67; see also, Application ofAEP Texas Central Company for Authority to Change Rates,\nDocket No. 33309, Order on Rehearing at FoF 82 (Mar. 4, 2007); Application ofAEP Texas Central Company\nfor Authority to Change Rates, Docket No. 28840, Order at FoF 164-170 (Aug. 15, 2005).\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE 170\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          State Agencies point out that, in support of his theory that financially-based incentives\nprovide benefits to ratepayers, Dr. Hartzell relied upon studies of utilities in competitive markets.\nThus, State Agencies contend, the studies are of little to no benefit in evaluating the effects of\nfinancially-based incentives upon ETI customers because ETI is a monopoly that is not subject to\ncompetitive pressures. Moreover, State Agencies examine at length the underlying studies relied\nupon by Dr. Hartzell and assert, essentially, that the studies do not fully support the findings that\nDr. Hartzell ascribes to them.\n\n\n          Staff refutes ETI's contention that the only reason why cost recovery has historically been\ndenied for financially-based incentive compensation is that there has been a lack of evidence\nshowing customer benefits. For example, Staff points out that, in one of the prior dockets cited by\nETI, the Commission disallowed recovery for financially-based incentive costs after stating,\n\"Incentive compensation based on financial measures or goals is of more immediate benefit to\nshareholders.\" 580 This suggests that the question is not, as ETI contends, whether the incentives\nprovide any benefit to ratepayers. Rather, the question is whether the incentives are primarily\nintended to provide benefits to shareholders.\n\n\n          Mark Garrett, an attorney and certified public accountant who works as a consultant in the\narea of public utility regulation, testified on behalf of the Cities in opposition to cost recovery for\nfinancially-based incentive compensation. He stated there are a number of reasons why it makes\nsense to exclude financially based incentive costs from rates: (1) there is no certainty from year to\nyear what the level of incentive payments will be (because incentive payments are conditioned upon\nfuture events and triggers that might not occur), thereby making it difficult to set rates and recover a\nlevel of expense; (2) many of the types of factors that increase earnings per share-such as an\nunusually hot summer or customer growth-are outside the control of employees and have no value\nto customers; and (3) earnings-based incentives can discourage energy conservation. 581 Mr. Garrett\n\n\n\n580\n   Staff Reply Brief at 44, quoting Application of Oncor Electric Delivery Company for Authority to Change\nRates, Docket No. 35717, Order on Rehearing at FoF 92 (Nov. 30, 2009).\n581\n      Cities Ex. 2 (Garrett Direct) at 29-30\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE171\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nalso discussed the results of a survey of 24 other states, which revealed that 17 states closely follow\nTexas' approach, and none allow full recovery of incentive compensation. 582\n\n\n          Mr. Garrett testified that ETI will not be placed at a competitive disadvantage in its ability to\nobtain and retain qualified employees if its financially-based incentives are disallowed. He stated\nthat the Company's total payroll costs for 2011 were 10 percent above the market price, and that\nmost of the above-market payroll costs derived from the incentive program. 583\n\n\n          The AI.Js conclude that ETI should not be entitled to recover its financially based incentive\ncompensation costs. Based upon prior Commission precedents, the AI.Js conclude that the issue is\nnot, as ETI contends, whether such incentives might provide any benefits to customers. The proper\nquestion to be asked is whether they provide benefits most immediately or predominantly to\nshareholders. Without a doubt, the primary purpose of financially based incentives, such as\nincentives tied to earnings per share or stock price, is to benefit shareholders, not ratepayers. Even\nconstruing Dr. Harzell's testimony in the most generous light, any benefits that might accrue to\nratepayers would be merely tangential to that primary purpose.\n\n\n          Moreover, even if the AI.Js were to completely accept as true the opinions offered by\nDr. Hartzell, it would be of limited benefit to ETI because his opinions were almost completely\ntheoretical. The premise of his testimony was that \"a well-designed compensation plan\" that\nincludes incentive compensation tied to financial goals would \"tend to provide greater benefits to\ncustomers\" than a plan that did not include such compensation. 584 He stressed that the customer\nbenefits of incentive compensation tied to financial goals can only exist if such compensation is part\nof a larger, reasonable, and well-designed overall compensation plan. 585 However, he did not\nmeaningfully apply this abstract theory to ETI's compensation plan. For example, Dr. Harzell did\nnot offer an evaluation of ETI' s compensation plan and conclude that it is \"well designed,\" nor did\n\n582\n      Id. at 32-38.\n583\n      Id. at 45-46.\n584\n      ETI Ex. 15 (Hartzell Direct) at 7 (emphasis added).\n585\n      See, e.g., ETI Ex. 15 (Hartzell Direct) at 13.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                       PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE172\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nhe testify that ETI' s incentives tied to financial goals actually provide benefits to its customers. He\nadmitted that he did not study the details of ETI' s incentive plans, nor did he do any type of analysis\nto see if the costs of ETI's incentive programs outweighed their benefits. 586 He did not know the\namounts of incentive compensation that was paid by ETI. 587 One of his major premises was that\nfinancially-based incentives can benefit customers by lowering their costs, but he did not know how\nETI customer's costs compared with customer costs in the other Entergy operating companies. 588\nAnother of his major premises was that financially-based incentives can benefit customers by\nensuring the financial health of the Company, but he made no attempt to determine whether ETI was,\nin fact, a financially healthy company. 589 By confining his testimony to the abstract, it is impossible\nto know whether Dr. Hartzell believes that ETI's incentive compensation tied to financial goals\nachieves the customer benefits that he believes such compensation can theoretically achieve. It is\ntrue that Mr. Gardner described some of the specifics of ETI' s incentive plans. However, because\nDr. Hartzell did not explain the metrics of what he would consider \"a well-designed compensation\nplan,\" it is impossible to know if ETI's plan meets those metrics.\n\n\n          Simply put, the ALls conclude that ETI has failed to establish a sufficient justification for\noverturning the well-established Commission policy that financially based incentive compensation is\nnot recoverable.\n\n\n                      (b) The Adjustment for Financially-Based Incentive Compensation Costs\n\n          Having concluded that ETI is not entitled to recover the costs of its financially based\nincentive programs, it is necessary to determine the amount of those costs so that they may be\nremoved from consideration in this rate case. The parties disagree on the correct amount.

TIEC contends the\n                                     591                                        592\ncorrect number is $6.2 million.            Cities contend it is $8.4 million.\n\n\n          Broadly speaking, ETI has two categories of incentive compensation programs - annual\nprograms and long-term programs. ETI witness Gardner testified that 100 percent of ETI' s\nlong-term programs are financially based, whereas an average, representing a far lower percentage,\nof the Company's annual programs are financially based. 593 Staff witness Givens applied those\npercentages to determine her estimate of the amount spent by ETI in the Test Year on financially\nbased incentives. As to the Company's long-term programs, she recommended removing the entire\ncosts of those programs (i.e. 100 percent) from the cost of service. As to the Company's annual\nprograms, she recommended removing average percentage of the costs of those programs.\nMs. Givens then applied the FICA tax rate to the total amount she identified as financially based\ncosts to account for direct taxes that ETI would have paid as a result of those costs. By her estimate,\nthe FICA taxes associated with ETI's financially based incentives paid in the Test Year totaled\n$429,096. In total, Ms. Givens recommended removing $5,609,093 (representing ETI' s financially\nbased incen,tives paid in the Test Year, plus FICA taxes associated with those payments) fromETI's\nrequested O&M expenses. However, based upon subsequent additional information supplied by\nETI594 relative to the actual payroll taxes paid by the Company for its financially based incentive\ncompensation, Staff has agreed to lower its estimate of FICA taxes from $429,096 to $143,801.\nThus, Staff now recommends removing $5,323,798 (representing ETI's financially based incentives\npaid in the Test Year, plus FICA taxes associated with those payments) from ETI' s requested O&M\nexpenses. 595\n\n\n\n\n590\n    Staff Initial Briefat 56.

However, Mr. Pollock\ncalculated those numbers and percentages in a slightly different manner, leading to a different\nrecommended reduction amount. Just as Ms. Givens did, as to the Company's long-term programs,\nhe recommended removing the entire costs of those programs from the cost of service. ETI witness\nGardner testified that actual percentages of each annual program were quite different than the\naverage percentages for all programs used by Ms. Givens. 596 Thus, as to the Company's annual\nprograms, while Ms. Givens applied the average percentage reduction to all of the annual programs,\nMr. Pollock applied the actual percentage reductions applicable to each of the annual programs.\nBased on Mr. Pollock's calculations, TIEC recommends removing $6,196,037 (representing ETI's\nfinancially based incentives paid in the Test Year) fromETI's requested O&M expenses. 597 TIEC\nappears not to have taken into account any payroll taxes associated with ETI' s financially based\nincentives.\n\n\n          Cities witness Garrett took a substantially different approach when he calculated his estimate\nof ETI's financially based incentive costs. He agreed with Ms. Givens and Mr. Pollock that\n100 percent of the Company's long-term program costs should be removed from the cost of service.\nAs to the annual programs, however, Mr. Garrett defined what qualifies as \"financially based\" much\nmore broadly than ETI, Staff, and TIEC. ETI witness Gardner testified that, when the Company's\nfive annual programs were averaged together, specific percentages of those programs were\nfinancially based, aimed at \"cost control,\" and aimed at \"cost control, operational, safety.\"598\nMr. Garrett added together the percentages representing the financially-based costs, the cost-control\ncosts, and roughly one-third of the cost-control, operational safety costs to arrive at the figure he\nidentified as the amount of ETI' s costs for its annual programs that is \"related to financial\nperformance measures.\" 599 Cities contend this approach is supported by the decision in a prior\n\n\n\n596\n      ETI Ex. 36 (Gardner Direct) at 30 and KGG-4.\n597\n      TIEC Ex. l (Pollock Direct) at 41-45 and JP-7; TIEC Initial Brief at 51-54.\n598\n      ETI Ex. 36 (Gardner Direct) at 30 and KGG-4.\n599\n      Cities Ex. 2 (Garrett Direct) at 39-40, 46-50, MG2.10.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                 PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE175\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ndocket. 600      Based on Mr. Garrett's calculations, Cities recommend removing $8,397,232\n(representing ETI's incentives \"related to financial performance measures\" paid in the Test Year)\nfrom ETI' s requested O&M expenses.601 Mr. Garrett also agreed with Ms. Givens that an additional\nreduction should be made to account for the FICA taxes that ETI would have paid as a result of those\ncosts. 602\n\n\n          The Al.Js reject Cities' attempt to broadly expand the definition of what qualifies as a\nfinancially based incentive to include items such as cost control measures.                 Cities' primary\njustification for doing so is that the Commission has done so previously in the AEP Texas case. As\npointed out by ETI, however, the Commission did so in that case merely because AEP Texas lumped\nits cost control measures in with its financially based incentive costs. The evidence in this case\ndemonstrates that ratepayers benefit when a utility incentivizes its employee to control costs. Even\nTIEC witness Pollock testified that \"incentives that encourage employees to minimize costs are\nprobably more or less in the best interest of ratepayers.\"603                 ETI further provided evidence\nestablishing that cost control incentives that result in lower costs for the Company likewise result in\nlower rates for customers. 604\n\n\n          As to the approaches advocated by TIEC and Staff, the AU s conclude that TIEC' s approach\nmore accurately captures the true cost of ETI' s financially based incentive programs. Rather than\naveraging across all of ETI's annual programs (as was done by Staff), TIEC used the percentage\napplicable to the single annual program that included a component of financially based costs. Thus,\ntheALls recommend removing $6,196,037 (representing ETI's financially based incentives paid in\nthe Test Year) from ETI's requested O&M expenses.

Compensation and Benefits Levels\n\n            In the application, ETI included, as part of its labor costs, $54,965,005 in base payroll paid by\nETI and ESI in the Test Year. It also included $20,428,817 in costs associated with various benefits\n(such as medical/dental, and life insurance) that ETI and ESI provided to their employees. 605 Cities\ncontend that the amounts for base pay and the benefits package should be reduced by $989,370 and\n$2,860,034, respectively, because the amounts paid were above the market price.606 No other party\nchallenges the reasonableness of the base payroll and benefits package.\n\n\n            As to base payroll, Cities contends that the amount paid by ETI and ESI was 1.8 percent\nabove the prevailing market price (above market). 607 Cities witness Garrett acknowledges that ETI\nand ESI are free to pay their employees at above market wages, but he contends that ratepayers\nshould only be asked to pay the market rate for wages, which he contends constitute the only\n\"necessary'' costs of providing utility service. Thus, Mr. Garrett and Cities recommend a 1.8 percent\ndownward adjustment to base payroll expense (or $989,370) \"to bring the company's base payroll\ndown to a market-based level.\"608\n\n\n            As to the Company's benefits package, Cities points out that the amount paid by ETI and ESI\nwas 14 percent above market when compared to a peer group of Fortune 500 companies. 609 Cities\nwitness Garrett again contends that ratepayers should only be asked to pay the market rate for\nbenefits, which he contends constitute the only \"necessary\" costs of providing utility service.

Thus, Mr. Gardner testified that, when using a benchmark\nanalysis to compare companies' levels of compensation, it is advisable to view the market level of\ncompensation as a range (e.g.,+/- 10 percent of a mid-point) rather than a precise, single point. 613\n\n\n           ETI also disputes Cities' contention that the Test Year costs of the Company's benefits\npackage were 14 percent \"above market.\" Mr. Gardner acknowledged that the costs were 14 percent\nhigher than those of Fortune 500 companies, but he pointed out the costs were only 1 percent above\nthe market median of a peer group of utility companies. 614 ETI contends that the comparison against\nthe peer group of utility companies provides a more appropriate comparison for ETI than Fortune\n500 companies. ETI also points out that, even if equal weight were given to the comparisons against\nthe Fortune 500 companies and the peer utilities group, the value of the Company's benefit plans\nwould average within a +/- 10 percent range and, therefore, be at market. Thus, ETI argues that its\nbenefit plan levels are within a reasonable range, and no disallowance should be required. 615\n\n\n\n610\n      Cities Ex. 2 (Garrett Direct) at 58-59 and MG2.9.\n611\n      ETI Ex. 50 (Gardner Rebuttal) at 11.\n612\n      ETI Ex. 36 (Gardner Direct) at 23, and ETI Ex. 50 (Gardner Rebuttal) at 11 n. l.\n613\n      ETI Ex. 50 (Gardner Rebuttal) at 11-12.\n614\n      ETI Ex. 36 (Gardner Direct) at 42.\n615\n      ETI Ex. 50 (Gardner Rebuttal) at 13-14; ETI Initial Brief at 139-142.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                 PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                         PAGE 178\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          The ALls conclude that ETI has met its burden to prove the reasonableness of its base pay\nand incentive package costs. The ALls agree that it is reasonable to view market price for these\ncategories of costs as lying within a range of +/- 10 percent of median, rather than being a single\npoint along a spectrum. As to both base pay and the incentive package, ETI has proven that its costs\nfall within such an acceptable range. Accordingly, the ALls recommend rejecting the adjustments\nsought by Cities.\n\n\n          4. Non-Qualified Executive Retirement Benefits\n\n          ETI provides three types of supplemental executive retirement plans: the Pension\nEqualization Plan, the Supplemental Retirement Plan, and the System Executive Retirement Plan. 616\nIn the application, ETI included, as part of its labor costs, $2, 114,931 in costs associated with its\nexecutive retirement plans.          The expenses represent non-qualifying retirement plan expenses\ndesigned to provide retirement benefits to key managerial employees and executives who are invited\nto participate in the plans. They are generally available only to employees and executives earning\nmore than $245,000 per year. 617\n\n\n          On behalf of the Staff, Ms. Givens recommended a complete disallowance of the costs for\nthese programs, on the grounds that they are offered to only select, highly compensated employees\nand are excessive. Ms. Givens offered the opinion that the expenses were not reasonable and\nnecessary forthe provision of electric utility service and were not in the public interest.618 On behalf\nof Cities, Mr. Garrett agreed with Ms. Givens' recommendation, arguing that it is fair to have\nratepayers pay for benefits included in regular pension plans, but that shareholders ought to pay for\nany additional benefits included in supplemental plans, \"since these costs are not necessary for the\nprovision of utility service, but are instead discretionary costs of the shareholders.\"619 Mr. Garrett\nalso testified that costs associated with supplemental executive retirement plans are typically\n\n\n616\n      ETI Ex. 50 (Gardner Rebuttal) at 14.\n617\n      Staff Ex. l (Givens Direct) at 22-23; Cities Ex. 2 (Garrett Direct) at 54.\n618\n      Staff Ex. l (Givens Direct) at 23; Staff Initial Brief at 64.\n619\n      Cities Ex. 2 (Garrett Direct) at 55; Cities Initial Brief at 71-72.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE 179\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nexcluded by utility commissions in Oklahoma, Oregon, Idaho, Arizona, and Nevada.620 On behalf of\nOPC, Dr. Szerszen also recommended a complete disallowance of the portion of these costs\nallocated from ESI to ETI.621 She stated that ETI has not shown that ratepayers benefit from the\nexpenses, the costs are not necessary to provide utility service, and that the ESI allocation method is\n               622\nunjustified.\n\n\n           ETI disagrees with all of these criticisms and maintains that the costs of the plans should be\nrecoverable. ETI witness Gardner testified that the supplemental executive retirement plans are\nneeded for attracting, retaining, and motivating highly competent and qualified leaders.              He\nexplained that the Pension Equalization Plan provides supplemental retirement benefits to account\nfor the fact that Internal Revenue Code regulations limit the level of retirement benefits that qualify\nfor tax treatment favorable to ETI and Entergy. The existence of this supplemental benefit program\nallows the Company to pay retirement benefits to highly-compensated employees that are\nproportionate to the compensation they receive while active in their employment. The Supplemental\nRetirement Plan and the System Executive Retirement Plan provide supplemental benefits beyond\nthe amounts restricted in the qualified plan to some participants to attract, retain, and motivate\nemployees.623 According to Mr. Gardner, these types of retirement benefits are widely provided by\ncompanies within the utility business sector. 624 Accordingly, ETI argues that it needs to offer them\nin order to be competitive in the employment market with peer companies, and thereby to retain and\nadequately compensate these employees in terms of future retirement benefits.\n\n\n           The ALl s conclude that the supplemental executive retirement plans are not reasonable and\nnecessary for the provision of electric utility service and are not in the public interest.

Because these costs are not necessary for the provision of utility service, but are\ninstead discretionary costs, they should be paid by the shareholders. Accordingly, the AUs\nrecommend an adjustment to remove $2, 114,931, representing the full costs associated with ETI' s\nnon-qualified executive retirement benefits.\n\n\n           5. Employee Relocation Costs\n\n           In the application, ETI included, as part of its labor costs, $436,723 in employee relocation\n         625\ncosts.         ETI contends that, in order to be competitive in the employment market, it must provide\nrelocation assistance to certain of its employees. ETI witness Gardner testified that ETI' s relocation\npolicies and costs are reasonable and consistent with general industry practice. He also testified that\nthe Company's average relocation costs are in line with the relocation costs for the companies\nsurveyed by the Employee Relocation Council. 626\n\n\n           Staff recommends an adjustment to remove the entire $436,723 of ETI's relocation\nexpenses. 627 No other party challenged the legitimacy of relocation expenses. Staff points out that\nETI pays 110 percent of the market median for total annual compensation. 628 Staff contends that the\nfact that ETI pays more than the average market wage demonstrates that employees should be\nsufficiently enticed to join and move around within its organization without the need for ETI to pay\nrelocation expenses to attract employees. Therefore, Staff argues that the relocation expenses do not\nmeet the reasonable and necessary standard required for inclusion in cost of service, nor are the\nexpenses in the public interest. 629 Staff also points out that similar types of payments were removed\n\n\n\n\n625\n      Staff Ex. 1 (Givens Direct) at 25.\n626\n      ETI Ex. 36 (Gardner Direct) at 45-46.\n627\n      Staff Initial Brief at 64; Staff Ex. 1 (Givens Direct) at 24.\n628\n      Staff Ex. 1 (Givens Direct) at 24 (citing ETI Ex. 36 (Gardner Direct) at 26).\n629\n      Staff Initial Brief at 64; Staff Ex. 1 (Givens Direct) at 24.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                             PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE 181\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nfrom cost of service in recent proceedings, such as in Docket No. 28906, where payments for moving\nexpenses or signing bonuses were removed from cost of service. 630\n\n\n           ETI responds by pointing out that Staff does not challenge the reasonableness of the amount\nspent on relocations by ETI. It also contends that most of its peers offer moving assistance. Thus, it\nwould be competitively disadvantaged if it did not offer it as well. ETI reiterates that its relocation\ncosts are reasonable and necessary and should be authorized. 631\n\n\n           The AU s conclude that ETI has the better argument. There is no allegation that ETI was too\nlavish in its relocation expenditures. The only complaint offered by Staff is that ETI' s overall\ncompensation costs are 110 percent of the market median. It does not necessarily follow that the\nrelocation program is unnecessary. ETI provided substantial evidence that, without a relocation\nprogram, it would be at a competitive disadvantage with its peers. Accordingly, the AI.Js reject\nStaffs request to disallow the Company's relocation expenses.\n\n\n           6. Executive Perquisites\n\n           In the application, ETI included, as part of its labor costs, $40,620 in costs associated with its\nexecutive perquisites. Those perquisites consist of financial counseling and tax gross-ups for system\nofficers and executives. Specifically, the financial counseling program promotes maximizing\ninvestment growth opportunities for eligible officers and executives, and allows reimbursement for\ncertain expenses incurred for personal financial counseling services. 632 Staff recommends an\nadjustment to remove the full cost of the executive perquisites ($40,620), reasoning that the costs are\nnot reasonable and necessary for the provision of electric utility service. 633 ETI does not oppose that\n\n\n\n\n630\n  Stafflnitial Brief at 64; Staff Ex. 1 (Givens Direct) at 24, citing Application ofLCRA Transmission Services\nCorporation to Change Rates, Docket No. 28906, Final Order (Apr. 5, 2005).\n631\n      ETI Initial Brief at 143.\n632\n      Staff Ex. 1 (Givens Direct) at 23.\n633\n      Staff Initial Brief at 65; Staff Ex. 1 (Givens Direct) at 23.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE 182\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nadjustment.634 The AU s agree that the adjustment is warranted. Therefore, the AUs recommend an\nadjustment to remove $40,620, representing the full cost of ETI' s executive perquisite costs.\n\n\nE.        Interest on Customer Deposits\n\n          Staff witness Givens adjusted ETI's requested interest expense of $68,985 by removing\n$(25,938) from FERC account 431. 635 This decrease is a result of applying the interest rate of\n                                                                          636\n0.12 percent for calendar year 2012 on deposits held by utilities.              Using the active customer\ndeposits amount of $35,872,476 and the 2012 interest rate, Ms. Givens calculated a recommended\ninterest expense of $43,047 ($35,872,476 multiplied by .12 percent).637\n\n\n          This change, which reflects Commission-approved interest rates for 2012 as set in December\n2011, complies with Project No. 39008 and ETI agreed with this amount. Accordingly, the ALls\nrecommend that the Commission approve this amount.\n\n\nF.        Property (Ad Valorem) Tax Expense\n\n          During the Test Year, ETI's property tax expense equaled $23,708,829.638 Patricia Galbraith,\nETI' s Tax Officer, testified that a proforma adjustment should be made to this level of expense for a\nknown and measurable change that reflects the level of property tax expense ETI will experience in\nthe Rate Year. Specifically, her proposed adjustment would increase the Test Year level of expense\nby $2,592,420 to $26,301,249. 639 As Ms. Galbraith testified, ETI's property tax expense for the\ncalendar year 2012 will be paid in January of 2013 and be based on 2011 calendar year-end values\nfor both net operating income and net plant amounts. 640 Her proposed adjustment is based on an\n\n\n634\n      ETI Initial Brief at 144.\n635\n      Staff Ex. l (Givens Direct) at 24.\n636\n      Setting Interest Rates for Calendar Year 2012, Project No. 39008, Order (Dec. 8, 2011).\n637\n      Staff Ex. l (Givens Direct) at 24-25.\n638\n      ETI Ex. 26 (Galbraith Direct) at 5; ETI Ex. 3 at Sched.

TIEC argues\nthat ETI' s proposed adjustment should be rejected entirely, on the grounds that it is not a known and\nmeasurable change from ETI' s Test Year property tax costs. Ms. Galbraith admitted that she does\nnot know, with certainty, what the relevant property tax rate will be in 2012, nor has ETI received\nany tax bills advising that tax rates will rise. 642 Thus, TIEC witness Pollock testified that ETI' s\nproposed adjustment is not known and measurable and recommended that the Commission reject the\nadjustment and include only the Test Year level of expense in cost of service.643 TIEC further points\nout that the Commission has twice rejected requests to include projected property tax expense in\nrates. 644 For example, in Docket No. 28813, Cap Rock prepared an independent analysis indicating\nthat property taxes were expected to increase to $2,700,000 per year from its test year tax level of\napproximately $900,000 per year. The analysis used an estimated tax assessment of $110,000 with\nan estimated tax rate of $2.47 per $100 of value. The ALls in that case concluded that the property\ntax increases were estimates at the time of the hearing, and thus they were not known and measurable\nand should not be allowed. 645 Subsequently, the Commission adopted the ALls' finding. 646 The\nCommission rejected a similar request from ETI's predecessor Gulf States Utilities (GSU). 647 In\nconsolidated Docket No. 8702, the Commission rejected GSU's request for projected 1989 property\n\n641\n      ETI Ex. 26 (Galbraith Direct) at PAG-1.\n642\n      Tr. at 1221, 1238.\n643\n      TIEC Ex. 1 (Pollock Direct) at 40-41.\n644\n   In re Cap Rock Corp., Petition ofPUC (Staff) to Inquire into the Reasonableness ofthe Rates and Services\nof Cap Rock Energy Corporation, Docket No. 28813, Order on Rehearing at FoF 137 (Nov. 9, 2005) (\"Cap\nRock failed to prove any increase in property taxes above those in the test year-$899,597-was known and\nmeasurable.\"); Application of Gulf States Utilities Company for Authority to Change Rates, Application of\nSam Rayburn G&T Electric Coop., Inc. for Sale Transfer or Merger, Appeal of GulfStates Utilities Company\nfrom Rate Proceedings of Various Municipalities, Docket Nos. 8702, 8922, 8939, 8940, 8946, 8233, 8944,\n8945, 8947, 8948 and 8949, Order at FoF 111(May2, 1991) (\"The 1988 calendar year level of actual property\ntaxes paid should be used in determining rate year taxes because it is a known and measurable change.\").\n645\n      Docket No. 28813, PFD at 99 (Mar. 17, 2005).\n646\n      Docket No. 28813, Order on Rehearing at FoF 137 (Nov. 9, 2005).\n647\n      Docket No. 8702, Order at FoF 111 (May 2, 1991).\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE 184\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ntaxes and instead only allowed the actual calendar year property tax expenses. 648 In both cases the\nCommission found that projected tax expense is not a known and measurable change. 649\nAccordingly, TIEC contends that ETI' s request for a forecasted tax expense increase should be\nrejected. 650\n\n\n            Staff concedes that some level of increase is warranted but argues that the increase should be\nsmaller than ETI is asking for. Rather than an increase of $2,592,420, Staff contends that ETI' s Test\nYear property tax expenses should be adjusted upward by only $1,214,688. 651 Staff witness Givens\narrived at this increase by applying the effective tax rate forthe calendar year2011 to the Staffs Test\nYear end plant in service recommendation. She testified that both of these inputs to her calculation\nare known and measurable and thus may be used to determine the increase. 652\n\n\n            Cities also concede that some level of increase is warranted, but argue that the increase\nshould be smaller than ETI is asking for, and smaller than Staff proposes. Cities contend that ETI' s\nTest Year property tax expenses should be adjusted upward by only 1,134,442. 653 Cities witness\nGarrett offered the opinion that ETI' s proposed adjustment was based on estimates that were\nunreasonably high when compared to the actual tax valuation increases experienced since 2008. Mr.\nGarrett arrived at his projected increase in tax expense by applying the average annual valuation\nincrease experienced over the period of 2009-11 to net plant value for 2011. Cities argue that both of\nthese inputs to the calculation are known and measurable and thus may be used to determine the\nincrease. 654\n\n\n\n\n648\n      Docket No. 8702, Order at 52.\n649\n  Docket No. 28813, Order on Rehearing at FoF 137 (Nov. 9, 2005); Docket No. 8702, Order at 52, FoF 111\n(May 2, 1991).\n650\n      TIEC Initial Brief at 54-56.\n651\n      Staff Ex. 1 (Givens Direct) at 25.\n652\n      Id. at 25-26.\n653\n      Cities Ex. 2 (Garrett Direct) at 61.\n654   Id.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE 185\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          ETI responds to its opponents by pointing out that the Commission has, in the past,\nrecognized that the adjustment proposed by Staff, which was obtained by applying a historical\neffective tax rate to the level of test year end plant in service, is known, measurable, and\nappropriate. 655 ETI also notes that, although it had not done so at the time Ms. Galbraith filed her\ntestimony, ETI has since filed its 2011 year end FERC Form 1 data and now knows both the final net\nincome amounts and net plant values for year end 2011 that will be used to determine the Company's\n2012 tax expense (that will be paid in January of 2013 ). 656 ETI contends that those known values are\nsubstantially larger than the estimates used by Ms. Galbraith when she calculated the proposed\nadjustment, such that the known increases in 2011 net operating income and net plant amounts over\n2010 are so large that, even without the 1 percent increase in tax rate assumed in the property tax\nadjustment, Rate Year property tax expenses will be larger than the $26,301,249 amount requested\nby the Company. 657\n\n\n          The issue with regard to property taxes is whether a level of increase is known and\nmeasurable. The ALls conclude that the approach taken by Staff does the best job of generating a\nknown and measurable value for ETI' s property tax burden in the Rate Year. As explained above,\nStaffs approach is supported by prior Commission precedent. Moreover, unlike the approaches\nadvocated by ETI and Cities, Staffs approach requires no guesswork about future tax rates.\nAccordingly, the AUs recommend that ETI's property tax burden should be adjusted upward by\napplying the effective tax rate for the calendar year 2011 to the final, adopted Test Year-end plant in\nservice value for ETI.\n\n\n\n\n655\n   ETI Initial Brief at 145; see also, Application of AEP Texas Central Company for Authority to Change\nRates, Docket No. 28840, Final Order at FOF 189-191 (Aug. 15, 2005); Petition of General Counsel to\nInquire Into the Reasonableness of the Rates and Services of Central Telephone Company of Texas, Docket\nNo. 9981, 19 Tex.

Therefore, the ALls recommend an adjustment to remove $12,800 from\nETI' s costs of advertising, dues and contributions.\n\n\nH.         Other Revenue-Related Adjustments\n\n           Several items within the Company's revenue requirement are interrelated. This means that\nchanges to one area or item will impact one or more additional items, such as the Texas state gross\nreceipts tax, the PUC Assessment tax, and Uncollectible Expenses. 661 From the discussions in\nbriefs, it does not appear that there are any substantive differences among the parties regarding these\namounts, which will ultimately be determined during number running.\n\n\nI.         Federal Income Tax\n\n           As explained by ETI witness Rory Roberts, the Company calculated its income tax expense\nin the cost of service by taking into account only the revenues and expenses included in the cost of\n           662\nservice.         To the extent the Commission makes changes to the revenues and expenses that are\nultimately included in the cost of service, the income tax expense amount included in the cost of\n\n\n\n\n658\n      ETI Ex. 3, Sched.

This represents a proper matching of income tax effects to the\nexpenses and revenues that produced those tax effects.663\n\n\n          Mr. Roberts contended that the Commission's past practice of reducing tax expense for a\nconsolidated tax adjustment based on some measure of the tax \"savings\" the utility realized by\njoining in a consolidated group federal income tax return was inappropriate. He testified that it is\nimproper to reduce tax expense for deductions or losses that are not also included in the cost of\nservice. In the case of the Commission's consolidated tax adjustment, tax expense is reduced to the\nextent that utility income is used to offset non-utility affiliate losses, even though those losses are not\n                                                                                   664\nincluded in cost of service or borne in any manner by the utility's customers.\n\n\n          Despite his disagreement with the approach, Mr. Roberts performed a calculation of the\nadjustment using the interest credit methodology adopted by the Commission. He concluded that,\ninstead of positive taxable income, ETI had net tax losses over the 15-year calculation period and\nthus provided no taxable income that could be used to offset affiliate losses. 665 In fact, over the\n15-year period, ETI's tax losses were offset by taxable income produced by other affiliates. Thus,\nETI contends that, were the Commission to be consistent in applying its interest credit methodology,\nit should increase ETI tax expense included in cost of service due to the fact that its affiliates'\ntaxable income had to be used to offset ETI's tax losses. Nevertheless, in its application, ETI\nrejected the interest credit methodology and has not requested that ETI' s tax expense be increased as\na result of the consolidated tax adjustment calculation. No other party to the proceeding challenged\nthe Company's position on federal income tax expense in testimony or at the hearing. The ALls find\nno reason to do so either.\n\n\n\n\n663\n      ETI Ex. 21 (Roberts Direct) at 10.\n664\n      Id. at 10-1 L\n665\n      Id. at 10, and RLR-5.\n\fSOAHDOCKET N O . -                              PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE 188\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nJ.        River Bend Decommissioning Expense\n\n          ETI has an ownership interest in River Bend. In the application, ETI requested that\n$2,019 ,000 be included in its cost of service to account for the Company's annual decommissioning\nexpenses associated with River Bend. 666 This is the same amount that was requested and approved\non December 13, 2010, in Docket No. 37744. 667 The amount of $2,019,000 was derived from an\nETI decommissioning study that was completed in 2009. In this case, ETI chose not to propose any\nchange to its 2009 estimate. ETicontends that this decision is supported by an August 9, 2011, letter\nfrom the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 668\n\n\n          Cities argue that the decommissioning expense should be reduced to $1,126,000. 669 Cities\npoint out that the larger amount sought by ETI was merely the amount agreed to by the parties, as\nopposed to being substantively considered and approved by the Commission in Docket No. 37744.670\nIn the current case, ETI was asked through discovery to provide an updated estimate of the annual\ndecommissioning expense responsibility for Texas retail customers calculated using the most current\nTexas jurisdictional decommissioning fund balance.            ETI responded that the current annual\ndecommissioning revenue requirement is $1,126,000. 671\n\n\n          Under P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.231(b)(l)(F)(i), the annual cost of decommissioning for\nratemaking purposes must \"be determined in each rate case based on . . . the most current\ninformation reasonably available regarding the cost of decommissioning, the balance of funds in the\ndecommissioning trust, anticipated escalation rates, the anticipated return on the funds in the\ndecommissioning trust, and other relevant factors.\" The cost determined must then be expressly\nincluded in the cost of service established by the Commission's order.\n\n666\n      ETI Ex. 3 Scheds.

However, ETI relies on P.U.C. SUBST.\nR. 25.23l(b)(l)(F)(iv) and Staff witness Cutter's testimony to contend that it need not adjust the\ncurrent amount being charged.672 Pursuant to subpart (iv), ETI is required to periodically study its\ndecommissioning costs, and such a study must be done \"at least every five years.\" Because its last\nstudy was done in 2009, ETI contends that it need not do a new study now, but may simply rely of\nthe outcome of its last study, which showed that its annual revenue requirement is $2,019,000. 673\n\n\n            Cities agree that ETI is not required to conduct a new decommissioning study at this time.\nHowever, the most current information reasonably available clearly shows that the annual amount\nrequired to meet the total cost determined in the Company's last decommissioning study has\ndecreased. Cities argue that to ignore the most current information available disposal would\nunreasonably shift future costs to current customers and would be a violation of P.U.C.        SUBST.\n\nR. 25 .231 (b)( 1)(F)(i). The AUs agree. ETI' s annual decommissioning revenue requirement should\nreflect the most current calculation of $1, 126,000. Therefore, an adjustment of $893,000 to the pro\nform.a cost of service is needed to reflect the difference between the requested level for\ndecommissioning costs of $2,019,000 and recommended level of $1,126,000.\n\n\nK.          Self-Insurance Storm Reserve Expense [Germane to Preliminary Order Issue No. 5]\n\n            In prior dockets, the Commission authorized ETI to recover $3,650,000 annually for storm\ndamage expenses and to maintain a reasonable and necessary storm damage reserve account of\n$15,572,000. 674       ETI requests to increase the authorized storm damage reserve account to\n$17,595,000 (an increase of $2,023,000) and to increase the annual accrual to $8,760,000 (an\nincrease of $5,110,000).

SUBST. R. 25.23l(b)(l)(G). However, Cities, OPC,\nand Staff oppose the amount of ETI' s proposed annual accrual, and Cities and OPC also oppose\nETI' s proposed target reserve. The parties' recommendations are:\n\n\n                                          Annual Accrual      Target Reserve\n                            Current        $3,650,000          $15,572,000\n                            ETI           $8,760,000           $17,595,000\n                            Cities        $6,150,339           $15,572,000\n                            OPC-1         $2,335,047           $15,572,000\n                            OPC-2         $3,650,000           $15,572,000\n                            Staff         $8,270,000           $17,595,000\n\n           The first component of ETI' s requested annual accrual is $4,890,000 for expected annual\nlosses. ETI explains that this is the amount of annual losses projected to be incurred by ETI from all\nstorm damage, except those over $100 million (the minimum amount likely to be securitized),675\nadjusted to reflect current conditions and current cost levels. 676 This recommended accrual was\ncalculated by ETI witness Gregory Wilson using a Monte Carlo simulation of ETI's loss history. 677\nA statistical distribution was estimated from ETI' s trended loss experience, and the model indicated\nan average annual loss of $4,890,000. Mr. Wilson excluded losses from Hurricanes Rita, Gustav,\nand Ike from the model because those losses were securitized and not recovered through the\ninsurance reserve. 678 ETI adds that results from the model simulation were also adjusted by\nremoving any simulated year in which the total storm loss exceeded $100 million, which would\nlikely be securitized.\n\n\n\n675\n      ETI Ex. 19 (McNeal Direct) at 32.\n676\n      ETI Ex. 14 (Wilson Direct) at 5.\n677\n      Id. at Ex.

In ETI's opinion, a 20-year period balances the interests of future and past ratepayers. It\nadded that Mr. Wilson's calculations were prepared in accordance with generally accepted actuarial\nprocedures, with certain adjustments to reflect the nature of ratemaking for public utilities. 679\n\n\n           ETI also requests a target reserve of $17 ,595,000. It argues that this would be an actuarially\nsound provision to cover self-insured losses. ETI noted that the target reserve was also developed by\nMr. Wilson through the Monte Carlo simulation based upon the ETI's loss history. 680\n\n\n           Cities recommend maintaining the current target reserve of $15,572,000 and adopting an\nannual storm damage accrual of $6,150,399. Cities' proposed annual accrual is comprised of two\nparts: (1) keeping the current accrual of $3,650,000 for projected annual storm expense; and\n(2) adding $2,500,399 annually to bring ETI's reserve deficit amount, as adjusted by Cities, up to a\ntarget reserve of $15,572,000. Cities' witness Jacob Pous testified that the current target reserve of\n$15,572,000 should be maintained given ETI' s plan to divest itself of the transmission system, which\nwould reduce storm damage expenses. 681 For the same reason, Mr. Pous also stated that the\nCommission should maintain the current annual accrual amount that was approved most recently in\nDocket No. 37744.682\n\n\n           According to Cities, ETI witness Wilson acknowledged that his calculations assumed that the\ncurrent transmission system would be owned by ETI, and if the transmission system were sold, his\nanalysis would need to be adjusted. 683 Cities also note that Mr. Wilson included ETI's 1997 ice\nstorm expenses within the historical storm data used for his calculations. 684 As discussed in\n\n\n679\n      ETI Ex. 14 (Wilson Direct) at 11-12.\n680\n      Id. at 9.\n681\n      Cities Ex. 5 (Pous Direct) at 65-66.\n682\n      Id. at 66; see also Docket No. 37744, Final Order at FoF 31 (Dec. 13, 2010).\n683\n      Tr. at 1247.\n684\n      Tr. at 1244-1246.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE 192\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nSection V .F., Cities challenge these expenses. If the Commission determines that those costs should\nbe excluded, Mr. Wilson agreed that it would be inappropriate to include them in his analysis. 685 In\naddition, Cities stated, Mr. Wilson's Monte Carlo model analysis has been rejected in several cases\nby the Commission, as noted by Staff witness Chris Roelse. 686 Cities noted that Mr. Wilson limited\nthe storm reserve expense in his model to $100 million, as anything over that amount might be\nsecuritized. 687 But, Cities contend, Mr. Wilson did not consider that the storm loss history provided\nto him by ETI included only storm damage expenses and not capital costs, which are also included\nwhen determining the amount capable of being securitized. Thus, in Cities opinion, Mr. Wilson's\ncap of $100 million was overstated, and for all these reasons Cities argues that Mr. Wilson's analysis\nshould not be considered reliable.\n\n\n          Finally, Cities note that ETI requested that the annual storm reserve accrual \"would be made .\n. . only until it reaches the recommended target level, at which point contributions to the reserve\nwould reduce to the lower of annual expected losses or actual losses.\"688 In Cities view, this request\nshould be rejected and the accrual should only be modified through a future rate case.\n\n\n          OPC also recommends adjustments to the storm damage reserve and the annual accrual. As\ndiscussed in Section V.F., OPC argues that ETI failed to prove that its storm damage expenses\nbooked since 1996 were reasonable and prudently incurred. Consequently, OPC recommends\ndisallowing all of those charges. Removing those charges would leave ETI with a positive storm\nreserve balance of $41,871,059, which exceeds the currently approved storm reserve balance of\n$15,572,000 by $26,299,059. OPC witness Benedict proposed that this surplus be refunded to rate\npayers at a rate of $1,314,953 per year for 20 years. He also recommended that current annual storm\ndamage accrual of $3,650,000 be maintained, less his proposed customer refund of $1,134,953 per\nyear, leaving a net annual storm damage accrual of $2,335,047 per year. Mr. Benedict acknowledged\nthat some storm damage expenses incurred by ETI since 1996 likely were reasonable and necessary.\n\n685\n      Tr. at 1246-1247.\n686\n      Staff Ex. 4 (Roelse Direct) at 12.\n687\n      ETI Ex. 14 (Wilson Direct) at 9.\n688\n      ETI Initial Brief at 151.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE 193\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nTherefore, as an alternative proposal, Mr. Benedict suggested that ETI's current storm balance\nreserve be set at the last approved amount of $15,572,000 (i.e., without any surplus or deficit) and\nthat the currently approved total annual accrual of $3,650,000 be maintained. In addition, OPC\nargues that Mr. Wilson's Monte Carlo model analysis was flawed because it included expenses that\nETI did not establish were reasonable and prudently incurred.689\n\n\n          Staff witness Chris Roelse agreed that ETI's proposed target reserve of $17,595,000 is\nreasonable. However, he recommended an annual accrual of $8,270,000, which is $490,000 less\nthan ETI' s request. Mr. Roelse pointed out that ETI' s witness calculated the proposed annual accrual\nbased on a Monte Carlo simulation, which projects a loss experience over a longer time than the\nperiod captured in the available loss history. However, Mr. Roelse stated, the Commission has not\napproved the use of these models in prior dockets; instead, it has relied on averaging known\ninsurance losses over a period of time to compute the annual accrual. Using historical loss data,\nMr. Roelse calculated an annual expected storm loss of approximately $4,400,000. When this\namount is added to the proposed annual accrual of $3,870,000 to restore the reserve balance from its\ncurrent deficit, it produces a total annual accrual of $8,270,000, which Staff recommends.690\n\n\n          In response, ETI agreed that if portions of the underlying costs upon which the Monte Carlo\nanalysis was performed are removed from the reserve, then the outcome of Mr. Wilson's analysis\nwould be different. However, ETI stressed that questions about the underlying expenses are not an\nattack on the Monte Carlo analysis itself. Rather, Mr. Wilson provided an analysis based upon\ninformation supplied by ETI, and he did not claim to support the expenses themselves. But ETI\ndisagreed with the challenges to the underlying costs, as discussed in Section V.F. 691\n\n\n          Most of Cities' and OPC's objections to ETI's requested storm damage annual accrual and\ntarget reserve relate to their objections to the underlying expenses, as discussed in Section V .F. For\nthe reasons stated in that section, the AUs denied those objections, and they do not support rejecting\n\n689\n      OPC Ex. 6 (Benedict Direct) at 6-16; OPC Initial Brief at 14-20; OPC Reply Brief at 13-15.\n690\n      Staff Ex. 4 (Roelse Direct) at 10-15; Staff Initial Brief at 13-14.\n691\n      ETI Reply Brief at 81.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE 194\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nETI' s request for the annual accrual or target reserve. Likewise, the AUs find that Cities' concerns\nabout ETI selling its transmission system are too uncertain to justify altering the storm damage\nreserve at this time.\n\n\n        Cities also raised a question about whether Mr. Wilson properly calculated the cap he used to\nexclude from his analysis storms that would likely result in securitized costs. Staff pointed out that\nthe Commission has not approved the use of the Monte Carlo simulation model in prior dockets.\nRather, the Commission has traditionally used known insurance losses over a period of time. The\nAUs note that neither PURA nor the Commission's rules either require or prohibit the use of\nactuarial models, such as the Monte Carlo simulation. The prior dockets cited by Staff did not adopt\nthe recommendations developed by actuarial models, but the Commission also did not expressly\nreject the models in those cases. Likewise, however, ETI has not cited any Commission decisions\nthat expressly adopted or used such models.\n\n\n        Staff witness Chris Roelse explained that the Commission has traditionally averaged known\ninsurance losses over a period of time to compute the annual accrual. He made such a calculation\nthat produced an annual accrual for storm damage loss of $4,400,000. When added to the proposed\nannual accrual of $3 ,870,000 to restore the reserve balance from its current deficit, the total annual\naccrual equals $8,270,000. No party challenged that calculation. Because a question remains as to\nwhether Mr. Wilson properly calculated his cap to exclude storm damage expenses that would likely\nbe securitized, the AUs find it is more reasonable to adopt the annual accrual proposed by Staff.\nTherefore, the AU s recommend that the Commission approve a total annual accrual of $8,270,000,\ncomprised of an annual accrual of $4,400,000 to provide for average annual expected storm losses,\nplus an annual accrual of $3 ,870,000 for 20 years to restore the reserve from its current deficit. The\nAU s also recommend approval of ETI' s proposed target reserve of $17 ,595,000. Finally, the AU s\nrecommend that the Commission require ETI to continue recording its annual accrual until modified\nby an order in a future rate case, as requested by Cities. Otherwise, ETI could continue to receive\nrates based on the total accrual amount, but not record the receipts in the storm damage reserve. The\nAUs find that such circumstances would not result in just and reasonable rates.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                          PAGE 195\nPUC DOCKET NO. 398%\n\n\nL.        Spindletop Gas Storage Facility\n\n          Cities challenged ETI' s use of the Spindletop Facility, arguing that the costs of operating it\noutweigh the benefits gained from it. In Section V.H., the AI.Js rejected Cities' contention that a\nsubstantial portion ofETI's annual costs to operate the Spindletop Facility should be removed from\nETI' s rate base. For the same reason he challenged the Spindletop Facility costs associated with rate\nbase, Cities witness Nalepa also challenges a portion of ETI' s costs derived from the Spindletop\nFacility that are associated with operating expenses. Specifically, Mr. Nalepa and Cities argue that\n$2,090,116 (consisting of $309,751 in depreciation expense and $1,780,365 associated with the\nSpindletop Facility) ought to be removed from ETI' s operating expenses. 692 For the same reason that\nthey rejected Cities' Spindletop Facility arguments relevant to rate base, the AI.J s also reject Cities'\nSpindletop Facility arguments relevant to operating expenses.\n\n\n VIII.      AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS [Germane to Preliminary Order Issue No. 3]\n\n          PURA requires that more stringent standards be applied to affiliate expenses than are applied\nto other utility company expenses. Section 36.058 begins by stating \"except as provided by\nSubsection (b),\"the PUC may not allow as capital cost or as expense a payment to an affiliate for the\ncost of a service, property, right, or other item or interest expense. Subsection 36.058(b) provides\nthat the Commission may allow an affiliate payment \"only to the extent\" that the PUC finds the\npayment is reasonable and necessary for each item or class of item as determined by the\nCommission.\n\n\n          The seminal case interpreting PURA' s affiliate transaction standard under Section 36.058 is\nRailroad Commission v.

The court interpreted the PURA affiliate transaction statute and explained\nfour major areas in which Rio had failed to meet its burden of proof:\n\n\n•     Plaintiff had the burden of showing that the prices it was charged by its affiliate were no higher\n      than the prices charged by the supplying affiliate to its other affiliates ....\n\n•     Plaintiff had the burden of showing that expenses which may not be allowed for rate making\n      purposes for any reason ... were not included in the \"allocated expenses.\" ...\n\n•     Plaintiff had the burden of proving that each item of allocated expense was reasonable and\n      necessary....\n\n•     Plaintiff had the burden of proving that the allocated amounts reasonably approximated the\n      actual cost .of services to it. ...\n\n          fu 2000, the Third Court of Appeals once again spoke on the issue of affiliate transactions in\nthe utility setting.    fu Central Power and Light Company/Cities of Alice v.

The transactions must be disallowed for regulatory purposes, unless the utility presents\nsufficient evidence that it has met each of the affiliate transaction statutory requirements. If the\nregulatory tests for affiliate transactions are not properly enforced, the regulated utility may become a\nvehicle for cross-subsidization by ratepayers of other regulated or unregulated affiliates.\n\n\n          OPC witness Szerszen was the only witness to challenge ETI's affiliate transactions, 695\nrecommending a total affiliate disallowance (after erratas) of $8,945 ,221. 696 Dr. Szerszen reviewed a\nselect subset of ETI' s affiliate expenses using the PURA affiliate transaction standards. She\nreviewed the Company's affiliate transactions on a project by project basis, noting that such a review\nwas more efficient and easier to understand. 697            Dr. Szerszen testified that a review by the\nCompany's 25 classes of service presents a far too macro view of affiliate transactions that does not\nallow an adequate review of ETI' s affiliate transactions according to PURA mandates and takes the\nfocus away from the important issues. 698\n\n\n          OPC notes that PURA Subsection 36.058(f) requires that if the Commission finds an affiliate\nexpense for the test period to be unreasonable, then the Commission is to make a determination of\nwhat level of the expense is reasonable. By analyzing ETI' s affiliate transactions on a project basis,\nOPC contends that it has facilitated the Commission's ability to make such a determination for each\nof ETI' s classes of service; instead of an \"up or down\" decision on the macro level of expense for the\nclass, the Commission can disallow the portion not shown to be reasonable and approve the\nremainder as reasonable.\n\n\n\n\n695\n     Cities witness Mark Garrett recommended disallowance of certain short-term incentive compensation\naffiliate costs, but those disallowances are largely also recommended by Dr. Szerszen. See ETI Ex. 69\n(Tumminello Rebuttal) at 17. ETI contends that the duplicated disallowances by Dr. Szerszen and Mr. Garrett\nwould result in double counting $217 ,520 of the requested affiliate charges and requests that if the AUs rule in\nOPC' sand Cities' favor regarding these short-term incentive compensation costs, that disallowance should be\nreduced by $217,520. ETI Initial Brief at 157, n. 898.\n696\n      Tr. at 1607.\n697\n      OPC Exhibit No. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 42-43.\n698\n      OPC Exhibit No. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 42-43; Tr., at 1671-72.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                   PAGE 198\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          ETI disagrees with OPC's contentions and argues that Dr. Szerszen's approach to addressing\nthe Company's affiliate case is inappropriate for a number of reasons and should be rejected.\n\n\n•     First, her approach is directly contrary to the Commission's Guiding Principles included as part\n      of the Commission's Transmission and Distribution Cost of Service Rate Filing Package that\n      was issued on April 2, 2003. 699 Item 2 of the Guiding Principles clearly states that a class of\n      service approach is required for purposes of complying with the provisions of Section 36.058 of\n      PURA. 700 Dr. Szerszen ignores the class of service approach required by Section 36.058 of\n      PURA as detailed in the Guiding Principles, and instead states OPC' s case on a project code-by-\n      project code basis.\n\n•     Second, Dr. Szerszen's approach is directly contrary to the Commission's directives in Docket\n      No. 16705. In that docket, the Commission disallowed a substantial amount of affiliate expense\n      because Entergy Gulf States, Inc. had done then what Dr. Szerszen proposes here - based the\n      affiliate analysis solely on project codes, rather than affiliate classes of service. Because the\n      Commission found that a scope statement/project code-based affiliate analysis is \"impossible,\"\n      the Company, in its subsequent base rate cases, including its filing in this docket, changed to a\n      class-based presentation, as directed by the Commission.\n\n•     Third, by refusing to consider a class-based analysis, Dr. Szerszen has ignored the Company's\n      testimony, presented by 19 affiliate witnesses, which explains in detail why the Company's\n      affiliate-incurred costs meet the Section 36.058 of PURA and Rio Grande standards. 701\n      According to ETI, the Company's affiliate class witnesses, who are knowledgeable about the\n      activities that are encompassed in each of their classes, have each shown why the services\n      provided through those classes are necessary. They have each also addressed numerous\n      Commission-recommended metrics to measure the reasonableness of costs, including cost trends,\n      staffing trends, the budgeting process, and, if applicable, benchmarking and outsourcing\n      comparisons. 702 Their testimony and exhibits, according to ETI, show numerous different\n      \"views\" of the costs in their classes, including the project codes that comprise their classes. Each\n      affiliate witness also addressed the \"not higher than\" and \"reasonably approximates cost\"\n      standards applicable to affiliate costs. ETI contends that the evidence provided by its witnesses\n      meets the requirements of these Guiding Principles and supports the Company's burden of proof\n      for the recovery of affiliate costs. ETI also contends that Dr. Szerszen ignores this overwhelming\n\n\n699\n      See ETI Ex. 69 (Tumminello Rebuttal) at Ex. SBT-R-1.\n700\n    Dr. Szerszen conceded that the Guiding Principles require that a utility's affiliate case be presented in a\nsufficient number of class or other logical groupings. Tr. at 1632.\n701\n    Dr. Szerszen claimed that, instead of considering the narrative class testimony, she instead \"looked at more\nof the detail,\" presumably meaning the exhibits.

In addition, she\n      presents no evidence in accordance with the Guiding Principles that supports her proposed\n      disallowances.\n\n•     Fourth, the Company's case is much less cumbersome and less complex than the approach\n      suggested by OPC, which would require a showing on the necessity, reasonableness, \"not higher\n      than,\" and \"reasonably approximates cost\" standards for each of almost 1,300 project codes\n      subject to this docket. Even if the Company were to do that, Dr. Szerszen's \"cherry picking\"\n      approach among the project codes ignores any savings in other project codes that would\n      comprise a class of affiliate costs, thereby resulting in an overall reasonable level of costs within\n      the class even assuming that any of her complaints about individual project codes had merit.\n\n•     Fifth, ETI contends that Dr. Szerszen fails to mention Section 36.058(f) of PURA, which\n      requires that the Commission determine the reasonable level of \"an affiliate expense\" if it first\n      finds that the expense presented is unreasonable. But rather than offering an alternative\n      \"reasonable\" level of an expense\"\", she either categorically disallows all costs in that project; or,\n      in some instances, substitutes an arbitrary sharing or allocation of costs between ETI and its\n      regulated affiliates, or ETI and its non-regulated affiliates. In doing so, Dr. Szerszen does not\n      make any evidence-based attempt to ground her alternative allocation (and associated\n      disallowance of ETI affiliate costs) on any objective basis reflecting cost causation principles.\n      ETI contends that the effect of her approach is to presume that the Company needs zero dollars in\n      its cost of service to perform a variety of essential utility support activities.\n\n•     Sixth, Dr. Szerszen' s positions in the 2009 Oncor rate case,703 which she agrees are similar to her\n      positions in this ETI base rate case, 704 were rejected by the two SOAH AU s and the Commission\n      in that docket. ''Many of the allegations and arguments made by Dr. Szerszen in this case are\n      very similar, if not identical, to the points she asserted in the Oncor case.\n\n          The AU s agree that the Commission's Guiding Principles set forth the minimum that a\nutility must present to establish a prima facie case, and it is clear that ETI met that burden. That,\nhowever, is not the end of the question. Permitting a utility to escape further scrutiny of its affiliate\ntransactions by resting on its prima facie presentation imposes too many limits and, as suggested by\nOPC, presents too macro a view to be a legitimate review for rate case purposes.\n\n\n\n\n703\n   Application of Oncor Electric Delivery Company, LLC for Authority to Change Rates, Docket No. 35717\n(PFD issued on Jun. 2, 2009; Order on Rehearing issued on Nov. 30, 2009) (Oncor).\n704\n      Tr. at 1656.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE200\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          OPC performed essentially a sample review of ETI' s affiliate transactions. The review was\nnot exceptionally large, and (as evidenced by ETI' s concurrence in the removal of some of the costs)\nit represented an additional layer of review to ensure that improper costs would not inadvertently be\ncharged to ratepayers. That, of course, is not the sole focus of OPC' s review, but it is important for\npurposes of determining whether the review itself is appropriate. If intervenors and Staff were\nlimited to the macro level of review urged by ETI, such matters would never be revealed and there\nwould exist a possibility that ratepayers would be charged for matters not their responsibility. The\nALJs do not characterize OPC's review as \"cherry picking.\" It is more a reasonable sample for\nexamination that gives ETI a reasonable opportunity to explain the reasons for the charges to\nratepayers. Accordingly, the ALJs find that the Commission's Guiding Principles do not limit the\nreview performed by OPC, and the review performed by OPC is not contrary to the Commission's\nholdings in Docket No. 16705.\n\n\nA.        Large Industrial & Commercial Sales Reallocation\n\n          OPC contends that ETI incurs considerable amounts of sales and marketing expenses that are\nexclusively for the benefit of the larger commercial and industrial customers. However, most of\nESI' s sales, marketing, and customer service expenses are allocated to residential and small business\ncustomers. 705 The vast majority of the sales, marketing and customer service expenses are allocated\nto the operating companies based on customer counts, the majority of these expenses are\nconsequently allocated to residential and small business customers. In the test year, residential and\nsmall general service customers made up 94.8 percent of the ETI total customer count. ETI' s\nGeneral Service, Large General Service, and Large Industrial Power Service, and Lighting classes\ncombined comprise only 5.2 percent of ETI' s customers. For the test year, OPC argues that ETI is\nrequesting the recovery of $2.086 million of sales, marketing, billing and load research expenses that\nbenefitted only the large customer service classes. OPC contends that it is inappropriate for\nresidential and small customers to pay for these expenses, when cost causation is so readily\nidentifiable, particularly since a disproportionately small portion of larger customer sales and\n\n\n\n705\n      OPC Ex. l (Szerszen Direct) at 45.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE201\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nmarketing expenses is allocated to ETI's largest customers. 706 The total recommended reallocated\nlarge customer expense is $2,086,145.\n\n\n          ETI and TIEC oppose OPC' s recommendation, arguing that it is \"cherry-picking\" and that the\nevidence does not demonstrate that the $2.086 million of affiliate expense should be directly\nassigned to the large commercial and industrial classes. 707\n\n\n          With respect to the first argument, ETI and TIEC contend that Dr. Szerszen developed her\nadjustment by examining a limited sample of affiliate project code summaries and making the call,\nbased on project code descriptions, that certain affiliate costs for marketing, sales and customer\nservice expense should be directly assigned to large commercial and industrial customers. 708 Both\nTIEC and ETI contend that the bias and results-oriented nature of her recommendation became\napparent when Dr. Szerszen admitted on cross examination that she made no effort to examine\nwhether certain affiliate costs should be directly assigned to residential and small customers.709 Both\nETI and TIEC contend that it is inappropriate to take a \"limited sample of costs\" and directly assign\nthem to a particular class.\n\n\n          According to TIEC, Dr. Szerszen admitted that it could have been appropriate to make an\nadjustment for direct assignment of costs to small commercial and residential customers based on\nprinciples of cost causation. 710 However, she made no effort to do that herself, nor did she ask ETI\nto conduct such an analysis. 711 The parties argue that the evidence shows that Dr. Szerszen's\nrecommendation rests on an incomplete analysis of ETI's affiliate costs and her recommendation\nshould be rejected because direct assignment of costs is only appropriate if there has been a thorough\n\n\n\n\n106\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 45.\n707\n      ETI Ex. 55 (LeBlanc Rebuttal) at 5; TIEC Ex. 3 (Pollock Cross Rebuttal) at 36.\n708\n      Tr. at 1609.\n709\n      Tr. at 1609-10.\n710\n      Tr. at 1685.\nrn Tr. at 1613-1624.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE202\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nand complete cost study analysis to determine what costs are or are not appropriate for direct\nassignment to all of the classes.\n\n\n           TIEC further argues that the evidence did not demonstrate that the $2.086 million of affiliate\nexpense that Dr. Szerszen proposes for direct assignment to large commercial and industrial\ncustomers is solely attributable to costs caused by those customers. Mr. Pollock testified that the\nproject codes Dr. Szerszen selected include load research expenses that benefit residential and small\ncommercial customers. 712 TIEC pointed out that ETI witness Stokes testified that the billing\nmethods used for the affiliate expenses for customer service operations and retail operations were\nfair and reasonable.713 According to TIEC, Dr. Szerszen's proposal should be rejected because her\nassertion that these expenses exclusively benefit large commercial and industrial customers is\nincorrect.\n\n\n           The AU shave reviewed the arguments of the parties and find that Dr. Szerszen' s analysis is\nfar from complete. It appears to be result-oriented, ignoring critical aspects (such as failing to make\nan adjustment for direct assignment of costs to small commercial and residential customers based on\nprinciples of cost causation). The AUs believe that Dr. Szerszen's analysis with respect to this issue\nshould not be adopted.\n\n\nB.         Administration Costs\n\n           Dr. Szerszen recommended disallowance of $94,709 (25 percent) of the charges in\nProject F3PCFACALL, contending that ESI failed to directly charge any of the costs in this project\ncode to ETI. She claimed that the billing method applied to this project code by ESI (that is, Billing\nMethod \"SQFALLC\"), which is based on square footage, is not appropriate for these types of\n         714\ncosts.\n\n\n\n\n712\n      TIEC Ex. 3 (Pollock Cross Rebuttal) at 35.\n713\n      ETI Ex. 66 (Stokes Rebuttal) at 3.\n714\n      OPC Ex. l (Szerszen Direct) at 80-82.\n\fSOAHDOCKET N O . -                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE203\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          ETI witness Plauche explained that the costs captured in this project code are primarily for\nthe oversight of administrative functions, such as facilities, real estate, and security.715 This project\ncode applies to the administration of these types of functions. These services benefit all companies\nthat receive facility services and are not attributable to any one specific Entergy affiliate. Therefore,\nit is appropriate to bill these costs to all companies based on their pro rata share of square footage\noccupied. 716\n\n\n          The AUs concur that this is the appropriate method to employ and, therefore, recommend\nthat the Commission approve the inclusion of these costs as requested by ETI.\n\n\nC.        Customer Service Operations Class\n\n          Dr. Szerszen recommended disallowances in seven project codes covered primarily by ETI' s\nCustomer Service Operations Class: (1) F3PCR29324 (Revenue Assurance - Adm.) for a\ndisallowance of $70,849; (2) F3PCR53095 (Headquarter's Credit & Collect) for a disallowance of\n$110,338; (3) F3PCR73380 (Credit Systems) for a disallowance of $73,562; (4) F3PCR73458\n(Credit Call Outsourcing) for a dis allowance of $197; (5) F3PCR73381 (Customer Svc Cntr Credit\nDesk) for a disallowance of $43,378; (6) F3PCR73390 (Customer Svs Ctl - Entergy Bus) for a\ndis allowance of $60, 926; and (7) F3 PCR73403 (Customer Issue Resolution - ES) for a dis allowance\nof $1,869. 717\n\n\n          1.

These functions ensure the most efficient processes are used in managing\nwrite-offs for all the Operating Companies and have contributed to Entergy' s first quartile ranking in\nbenchmarking of credit and collection operations. These managerial and supervisory costs, which\ninclude bankruptcy administration, surety administration, arrears management, collection agency\nadministration, skip tracing, and final bill collections, remain consistent whether ETI's bad debt\npercentage is 10 percent, 30 percent, or any other percent and are appropriately allocated using the\nCUSTEGOP billing method, which is based on the number of electric and gas customers for each\nOperating Company. 718\n\n\n          ETI has provided credible evidence that it has chosen the correct billing methodology.\nTherefore, the Al.Js recommend the Commission approve inclusion of these costs as requested by\nETI.\n\n\n          2. Projects F3PCR73381 (Customer Svc Cntr Credit Desk), F3PCR73390 (Customer\n             Svs Ctl • Entergy Bus), and F3PCR73403 (Customer Issue Resolution - ES)\n\n          Dr. Szerszen recommended that these costs be reallocated using the CUSTCALL billing\nmethod. Given ESI's demonstrated tracking capabilities, Dr. Szerszen reallocated the costs of this\nproject using a 10.8 percent customer call allocator, which is on the low end of the\n10.70 percent-11.04 percent Test-Year CUSTCALL allocators. 719\n\n\n          ETI witness Stokes believes that Dr. Szerszen' s proposed reallocation is arbitrary and fails to\nconsider the cost causation associated with the actual project code at issue. These costs are not\ndriven by a specific proportion of calls from each Operating Company (that is, by the CUSTCALL\nallocator).

Accordingly, the ALls recommend the Commission approve the costs\nproposed by ETI.\n\n\nD.       Distribution Operations Class\n\n         Dr. Szerszen addressed three project codes that are within the Distribution Operations Class:\n(1) F5PCDW0200 (Lineman's Rodeo Expenses) for adisallowanceof $7; (2) F3PCTJGUSE(Joint\nUse With Third Party E) for a disallowance of $6,405; and (3) F3PCTJTUSE (Joint Use With 3rd\nParties -A) for a disallowance of $36,293. 720\n\n\n         1. Project F5PCDW0200 (Lineman's Rodeo Expenses)\n\n         Dr. Szerszen claimed that the expenses captured by this project should be disallowed because\nETI is a monopoly and Texas ratepayers should not have to pay for corporate image costs.\n\n\n         ETI witness Tumminello responds, stating that this minimal amount is related to a safety\ncompetition known as the \"Lineman's Rodeo,\" it is not a corporate \"image\" expense.

Projects F3PCTJGUSE (Joint Use With Third Party- E) and F3PCTJTUSE (Joint\n             Use With Third Parties - A)\n\n          Dr. Szerszen recommends exclusion of these two projects, which she claims represent the\ndifference between the costs incurred for ETI for pole rental costs and the revenues received from\npole space rentals.\n\n\n          With respect to this proposed disallowance, ETI witness McCulla states that Dr. Szerszen has\nconfused the rental of space on transmission poles and the rental of space on distribution poles. She\nhas essentially performed a cost-benefit analysis that erroneously compares the cost of providing\nrental space on distribution poles with the income received solely from rental of space on\ntransmission poles. Mr. McCulla explained that data for the distribution poles show that the more\nthan $2.5 million in revenues from distribution pole rentals far exceeds the $67, 174 in costs billed to\nETI under these two project codes and, therefore, Dr. Szerszen's misassumption that the revenues\nwere less than the costs incurred is unfounded. 722\n\n\n          The AU s find that Dr. Szerszen erred. Making the correct comparison, as demonstrated by\nMr. McCula, shows there is no basis for the disallowance claimed by Dr. Szerszen. The ALls,\ntherefore, recommend the Commission deny the requested disallowance.\n\n\nE.        Energy and Fuel Management Class\n\n          Dr. Szerszen addresses seven project codes that are within the Energy and Fuel Management\nClass: (1) F3PCCSPSYS (System Planning And Strategic) for a disallowance of                   $29,304;\n(2) F3PCWE0140 (EMO Regulatory Affairs) for adisallowance of $114,468; (3) F3PPSPE002 (SPO\n2009 Renewable RFP Expense) for a disallowance of $3,014; (4) F3PPSPE003 (SPO Summer 2009\nRFP Expense) for a disallowance of $56,672; (5) F3PPSPE004 (SPO Summer09RFP\nIM&Propslsubmt) for a disallowance of $42,018; (6) F3PPWET300 (SPO 2008 Western Region\n\n\n\n\n722\n      ETI Ex. 59 (McCulla Rebuttal) at 8-12.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                              PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE207\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nRFP-Te) for a disallowance of $645; and (7) F3PPWET303 (SP02008WinterWestnRegionRFP-IM)\nfor a disallowance of $4,200. 723\n\n           1. Project F3PCWE0140 (EMO Regulatory Affairs)\n\n           Dr. Szerszen testified that Texas ratepayers do not receive benefits as a result of the costs\ncaptured by this project code and should therefore not be charged those costs. 724\n\n           ETI witness Cicio explained that Dr. Szerszen misinterpreted an RFI response to conclude\nthat Texas ratepayers did not receive benefits from the activities whose costs were booked through\nthis project code. That project code is not intended to capture costs for docketed or large System\nPlanning and Operations projects. Mr. Cicio states that it is not possible to assign a specific project\ncode for every discrete activity performed by each employee, nor would it be appropriate to attempt\nto do so. Regardless of the number of activities specifically identified through project codes, there\nwill remain the need to have generic project codes that capture time spent on more general,\nundocketed matters and activities that are no less beneficial to ratepayers. 725\n\n           The AU s agree that Texas ratepayers receive benefits as a result of the costs charged to this\naccount. Accordingly, the AUs recommend the Commission approve inclusion of the costs as\nrequested by ETI.\n\n           2. Projects F3PPSPE003 (SPO Summer 2009 RFP Expense), F3PPSPE003 (SPO\n              Summer 2009 RFP Expense), F3PPSPE004 (SPO Summer09RFP IM &\n              Propslsubmt), and F3PPWET303 (SP02008 Winter Westn RegionRFP-IM)\n\n           Dr. Szerszen testified that the costs captured by these projects should be disregarded because\nthey were incurred during the 2008-2009 period, which is outside of the Test Year, and are\nnonrecurring. 726\n\n\n\n723\n      OPC Ex. l (Szerszen Direct) at 55, 60, and 65-66.\n724\n      Id. at 55.\n725\n      ETI Ex. 45 (Cicio Rebuttal) at 8-9.\n726\n      OPC Ex.

These routinely encompass a multi-year time frame, and the\ncosts required to perform those activities, although associated with a project that may have been\ninitiated several years previously, are properly incurred over the life span of the project. He also\nstates that they are recurring because they reflect the kinds and levels of charges that would be\nexpected to be incurred on an ongoing basis in association with requests for proposals managed by\nESI on behalf of the Entergy Operating Companies, and the Company has been involved in these\ntypes of solicitations since 2002. 727\n\n\n          The AlJs find that the costs captured by these projects were incurred during the Test Year\nand represent the kinds and levels of costs routinely incurred on a recurring basis. Accordingly, the\nAU s recommend that the Commission approve their inclusion as requested by ETI.\n\n\n          3. Project F3PCCSPSYS (System Planning and Strategic)\n\n          Dr. Szerszen recommended total disallowance of the costs captured by this project code\nbecause they are allocated based on the total assets of the Entergy affiliates. 728 Dr. Szerszen' s\nconclusion appears to be that no such corporate-level costs should be allocated to ETI because there\nare other project codes that allocate corporate planning and analysis-type costs only to the regulated\nutilities, such as ETI; thus, any corporate-level costs that are allocated to all subsidiaries, whether\nregulated or non-regulated, should not be charged to ETI.\n\n\n\n\n727\n      ETI Ex. 45 (Cicio Rebuttal) at 13-14.\n728\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 60-61.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE209\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n            ETI witness Tumminello testified that Dr. Szerszen's theory neither considers the Entergy\norganization as a family of companies and ETI' s place in that family, nor the fact that these services\nare not only relevant to ETI as part of the Entergy family, but are reasonable, necessary and meet the\nCommission's affiliate cost recovery standard. ESI's corporate oversight services are provided to\nboth individual companies and groups of companies within the Entergy 'corporate structure. As a\nmember of the corporate group, ETI receives the benefit of corporate-level planning, reporting, and\nforecasting activities provided by ESI. 729\n\n\n            The ALls find that ETI (and, therefore, its ratepayers) does receive benefits as a member of\nthe Entergy family of companies and that it is appropriate for it to receive charges for those services.\nTherefore, the AUs recommend the Commission approve the inclusion of costs as requested by ETI.\n\n\nF.          Environmental Service Class\n\n            Dr. Szerszen recommended disallowance of $301,879 in six project codes primarily within\nETI's Environmental Services Class: (1) F3PCCE0129 (Corporate Sustainability Strat) for a\ndisallowance of $6,781; (2) F3PCCE0193 (Corp Environmental Special Pro) for a disallowance of\n$1,203; (3) F3PCCEIE01 (Corp Environmental Initiatives) for a disallowance of $2,413;\n(4) F3PCCEll01 (Corp Environmental Initiatives) for a disallowance of $2,413; (5) F3PCCEP001\n(Corporate Environmental Policy) for a disallowance of $269,248; and (6) F5PPBCNAVF (Avian\nFlu Contingency Planning) for a disallowance of $47. 730\n\n\n            Dr. Szerszen' s reasoning for this disallowance was that these six project codes, which all deal\nwith corporate environmental policy, initiatives, strategy, and consulting services, were allocated\nbased on Billing Method CAPAOPCO, which is based on the fossil plant capacity of the regulated\nutility operating companies, even though \"non-regulated entities clearly benefit from the corporate\nlevel expenses.\"731 Dr. Szerszen recommended a $47 disallowance for Project F5PPCCNAVF\n\n\n729\n      ETI Ex. 69 (Tumminello Rebuttal) at l 0-11.\n730\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 62-63.\n131   Id.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                             PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                   PAGE210\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n(Avian Flu Contingency Planning), asserting that this charge is a \"corporate imaging expense that\nshould not be borne by Texas ratepayers.\"732\n\n\n           According to ETI, Dr. Szerszen has a fundamental misunderstanding of how the affiliate\nbilling system works and, as a result, she incorrectly assumed that ESI charges are not being properly\nallocated. ETI argues that the non-regulated Entergy affiliates do receive the proper and appropriate\nallocation of costs. The two service companies for non-regulated affiliates also provide services to\ntheir non-regulated affiliates directly. There simply is no subsidization or improper allocation. 733\n\n\n           Dr. Szerszen noted that Entergy' s website indicates that nuclear-related environmental issues\nare being pursued. 734 She argued that this shows that the non-regulated affiliates are under-allocated\nenvironmental-related costs. Ms. Stokes explained that the project codes at issue \"deal with services\nprovided to the operating companies .... and just looking at the website there are other things ...\nthat are not covered or paid for by Texas ratepayers in these project codes that are in this\n                   735\ntestimony.\"              Therefore, according to Ms. Stokes, these project codes are not allocated in such a\nway that under-recovers costs from the non-regulated affiliates; they pay their own way.\n\n\n           Finally, the Project Summary for the Avian Flu Contingency Planning project shows that\nthese costs involve developing and communicating Avian Flu business continuity plans and then\nmaintaining, checking, and adjusting those plans once established. 736 These are not \"corporate\nimaging expenses\" as characterized by Dr. Szerszen.\n\n\n\n\n732\n      Id. at 66.\n733\n     See, e.g., ETI Ex. 41 (Tumminello Direct) at 10-15. Moreover, while ESI bills the regulated utility\naffiliates such as ETI at cost, it bills the non-regulated affiliates at cost plus a 5 percent mark-up pursuant to a\nJune 1999 Securities and Exchange Commission order. ETI Ex. 41 (Tumminello Direct) at 15. This 5 percent\nmark-up is then flowed back to entities that receive service from ESL Therefore, the regulated affiliates are,\nby federal order, receiving essentially a rebate from the non-regulated affiliates.\n734\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 62.\n735\n      Tr. at 884.\n736\n      ETI Ex. 41 (Tumminello Direct) at SBT-E at 1342-43.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE211\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          The AU s agree that ETI' s evidence demonstrates the recoverability of the costs captured by\nthese project codes. Therefore, the ALJs recommend the Commission approve their recovery.\n\n\nG.        Federal PRG Affairs Class\n\n          Dr. Szerszen recommended disallowances for three project codes primarily in the Federal\nPRG Affairs Class: (1) F5PPSPE044 (PMO Support Initiative-System) for a disallowance of $344;\n(2) F3PPUTLDER (Utility Derivatives Compliance) for a disallowance of $20,447; and\n(3) F3PCSYSRAF (System Regulatory Affairs-Federal) for a disallowance of $352,084.737\n\n\n          1. Project FSPPSPE044 (PMO Support Initiative-System)\n\n          Dr. Szerszen recommended disallowance of $344.29 from Project F5PPSPE044 (PMO\nSupport Initiative System). ETI responds, however, that a review of the Project Summary for that\nproject code in Ex. SBT-E reveals that ETI already removed those costs before even filing its direct\ncase. Therefore, according to ETI, Dr. Szerszen is recommending disallowance of a cost that is not\nin this case.738\n\n\n          The AU s agree that examination of the exhibit referenced by ETI appears to reveal that the\ncosts challenged by Dr. Szerszen have been removed from this case through a pro Jonna adjustment.\nAccordingly, the ALJs recommend the Commission reject OPC's challenge.\n\n\n          2. Project F3PPUTLDER (Utility Derivatives Compliance)\n\n          Dr. Szerszen recommended disallowance of $20,447 of derivatives expenses because ETI did\nnot use derivative instruments and therefore should not be charged these costs and because\nratepayers do not benefit from derivatives. 739\n\n\n\n\n737\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 46-47, 66-67.\n738\n      ETI Initial Brief at 174-175.\n739\n   ETI stated that it assumes that Dr. Szerszen must be referring to Project Code F3PPUTLDER (Utility\nDerivatives Compliance) because her recommended disallowance is the same total ETI adjusted amount shown\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE212\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          ETI witness Tumminello responded that Project F3PPUTLDER was charged by a group\ndeveloping compliance mechanisms to protect Entergy' s regulated utility interests in observance of\nthe Dodd-Frank Act. Although ETI does not currently use any derivative activities, understanding\nthe impacts of that Act is necessary to ensure current and future compliance through Entergy. The\ndefinitions under the legislation have not been finalized, and there remain issues that ETI must be\naware of to fully comply. These costs, therefore, are necessary and reasonable charges that should\nnot be disallowed. 740\n\n\n           The explanation offered by ETI for the inclusion of these charges appears reasonable to the\nAU s. Even though ETI does not now use derivatives, it is possible that it will in the future and it is\nimportant that it be aware of the regulatory framework associated with such actions to avoid\nproblems. The AU s therefore recommend the Commission approve inclusion of these costs as\nrequested by ETL\n\n\n           3. Project F3PCSYSRAF (System Regulatory Affairs-Federal)\n\n           In the regulatory affairs category, ETI requests the recovery of various legal,\ntestimony-related, communications, and filing costs associated with both Texas-specific regulatory\nactivities, FERC-related regulatory activities, and non-Texas specific regulatory activities. OPC\nwitness Szerszen did not recommend a disallowance of the $1,442,223 in adjusted Test Year\nexpenses for regulatory affairs that ETI has shown to be specific to the Texas jurisdiction. 141 Rather,\nDr. Szerszen recommended that all regulatory affairs expenses not specific to Texas be\ndisallowed.7 4 2 These expenses total $759,868.743\n\n\n\n\non the Project Summary for that project code. See SBT-E at 1113. The ALJ s make the same assumption as it\nappears reasonable.\n740\n      ETI Ex. 69 (Tuminello Rebuttal) at Ex.

According to OPC, this is not reality, nor is it consistent with FERC's primary\nresponsibility to ensure that electric wholesale buyers and sellers are provided open access\ntransmission across utility systems.\n\n\n          ETI witness May offered the following as rebuttal of Dr. Szerszen's contentions regarding\nthese two project codes:\n\n\n          The affiliate charges to Project Codes F3PCSYSRAS and F3PCSYSRAF are directly\n          associated with the issues and matters within the federal jurisdiction of the Federal\n          Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\") including but not limited to the Open\n          Access Transmission Tariff (\"OATT\") as well as any other federal statutes, rules and\n\n744\n      OPC Ex. 3 (Szerszen Workpapers) at 365.\n745\n      OPC Ex. l (Szerszen Direct) at 46-47; OPC Ex. 3 (Szerszen Workpapers) at 367.\n746\n      OPC Ex. 3 (Szerszen Workpapers) at 368-371.\n747\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 47.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                              PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                 PAGE214\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          regulations. These are the result of issues and matters raised concerning the OATT,\n          operations of the transmission system, requests for transmission service and\n          interpretation of applicable provisions under the jurisdiction of FERC. They are\n          costs incurred on an Entergy System-wide basis that cannot be directly assigned to\n          any one Operating Company, such as ETI.748\n\nHe then went on to state that the affiliate Test Year issues and costs related to these project codes are\n                                                                                                   749\nreflective of typical issues and costs that the Company experiences on an ongoing basis.                 With\nrespect to the benefits derived by Texas ratepayers as a result of activities conducted under these\nproject codes, Mr. May stated that:\n\n\n          the benefit to ETI involves a multitude of issues that are directly related to the\n          jurisdiction of the FERC, including but not limited to any revisions to Service\n          Schedules under the System Agreement that applies to all operating companies\n          including ETI, power purchase agreements for cost-based, short-term power sales,\n          and compliance with FERC by each Operating Company to the market-based rate\n          tariff and cost-based rate tariff. The Entergy Operating Companies' market-based\n          rate tariff and cost-based rate tariff are joint tariffs containing terms and conditions of\n          service. 750\n\nMr. May also explained why the billing methods applied to these two project codes are appropriate.\nThe cost drivers for Project F3PCSYSRAF are labor, employee expenses, consultant expenses, and\nother general operating expenses incurred for the benefit of the Entergy Operating Companies and\ntheir regulated customers. Therefore, a billing method based on load responsibility \"LOADOPCO\"\n  is appropriate for this type of project code. Project F3PCSYSRAS captures costs associated with\ngeneral regulatory support work that is applicable across all of the jurisdictions. The primary\nactivities associated in this project code include but are not limited to: special project work\nassociated with system-wide regulatory matters, analysis of emerging state or national regulatory and\naccounting issues affecting the Entergy System, and internal process improvement work. What\ndrives the cost of this project code is the average number of both electric and gas customers served-\n\n\n\n\n748\n      ETI Ex. 57 (May Rebuttal) at 25.\n749\n      ETI Ex. 57 (May Rebuttal) at 25.\n750\n      ETI Ex. 57 (May Rebuttal) at 27-28; see also, Tr. at 370-371.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                          PAGE215\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nCUSTEGOP because all such customers benefit from these services provided by ESI to ETI.751 In\nshort, according to ETI, the activities undertaken under both of these project codes benefit Texas\nratepayers, and they are properly allocated to the regulated operating companies using the billing\nmethods employed.\n\n\n          The AU s believe that resolution of this question is a close call. Although ETI provided an\nadequate explanation of the reasons underlying the allocation of costs to Texas ratepayers and the\nappropriateness of the allocation methodologies used, the one troubling aspect, as noted by OPC,\nwas that Mr. May's testimony regarding Projects F3PCSYSRAF and FP3PCSYSRAS contradicted\nthe fact that ESI has a specific project dedicated to open access transmission issues entitled \"FERC-\nOpen Access Transmission\" (Project F3PCE01601). 752 As OPC notes, if Mr. May was correct that\nOATT issues have been included in Projects F3PCSYSRAF and FP3PCSYSRAS the project pages\nshould arguably be more specific about the purpose of the expenditure. Nevertheless, the AU s find\nETI' s testimony credible and recommend that the costs of Projects F3PCSYSRAF and\nFP3PCSYSRAS not be disregarded.\n\n\nH.        Financial Services Class\n\n          Dr. Szerszen recommended disallowances in nine project codes that are primarily captured\nwithin ETI's Financial Services Class of affiliate costs: (1) F3PCF05700 (Corporate Planning &\nAnalysis) for a disallowance of $4,254; (2) F3PCF21600 (Corp Rptg Analysis & Policy) for a\ndisallowance of $320,157; (3) F3PCFF1000 (Financial Forecasting) for a disallowance of $96,734;\n(4) F3PPADSENT (Analytic/Decision Support-Entergy) for a disallowance of $93,544;\n(5) F3PPSPSENT         (Strategic   Planning Svcs-Entergy) for         a disallowance of $45,265;\n(6) F3PCR73345 (Quick Payment Center, Adm) for a disallowance of $14,484; (7) F3PCF20990\n\n\n\n\n751\n      ETI Ex. 57 (May Rebuttal) at 28-29.\n752\n      OPC Ex. l l; also found in OPC Exhibit No. 3 (Szerszen Workpapers )at 363-364.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                       PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE216\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n(Operations Exec VP & CFO) for a disallowance of $146,267; (8) F3PCFF1001 (OCE Support) for\na disallowance of $1,923; and (9) F3PCF23936 (Manage Cash) for a disallowance of $15,677.753\n\n\n          1. Projects F3PCF05700 (Corporate Planning & Analysis), F3PCF21600 (Corp Rptg\n             Analysis & Policy), F3PCFF1000 (Financial Forecasting), F3PPADSENT\n             (Analytic/Decision Support-Entergy), and F3PPSPSENT (Strategic Planning Svcs-\n             Entergy)\n\n          Dr. Szerszen proposed to disallow all costs related to these five project codes, which she\ncollectively describes as addressing Corporate Planning, Reporting, and Forecasting issues because\nshe contends that an assets-based allocator should not be used to allocate these costs and, regardless\nof the allocator used, these types of services do not benefit Texas ratepayers because ESI has, in\nother instances, directly billed corporate-level services to ETI.\n\n\n          ETI witness Tumminello responded, stating that Dr. Szerszen failed to consider the Entergy\norganization as a family of companies and ETI's place in that family. The services provided under\nthese project codes are not only relevant to ETI as part of the Entergy family, but are reasonable and\nnecessary. ESI' s corporate oversight services are provided to both individual companies and groups\nof companies within the Entergy Companies' corporate structure. As a member of the corporate\ngroup, ETI receives the benefit of corporate-level planning, reporting, and forecasting activities\nprovided by ESL Ms. Tumminello contested that the use of an asset-based allocator is appropriate\nbecause this is an example of the stewardship of the company-wide assets and such an allocator is,\ntherefore, appropriate. 754 The AU s agree.\n\n\n          The AUs find that ETI's proposed allocator is appropriate and that the costs benefit Texas\nratepayers. Accordingly, the AUs recommend the Commission approve the costs proposed by ETI.\n\n\n\n\n753\n      OPC Ex.

Projects F3PCF20990 (Operations Exec VP & CFO) and F3PCFF1001 (OCE\n            Support)\n\n         Dr. Szerszen recommended disallowance of all costs captured by these project codes because,\nin her opinion: (1) there are \"no perceivable benefits to ETI's ratepayers\"; (2) they should be paid\nfor by the parent entity (presumably meaning Entergy's shareholders); and (3) an asset.s-based\nallocator is not appropriate. 755\n\n\n         As to Dr. Szerszen' s assertion that Texas ratepayers do not benefit from the costs captured by\nthese project codes, ETI witness Domino, President of Entergy, provided anecdotal evidence that that\nEntergy was vital to ETI' s restoration efforts on two fronts. First, the parent provided cash to ETI for\nits hurricane restoration efforts; second, ETI was not required to pay dividends to the parent while it\nwas strapped for funds due to hurricane restoration efforts. 756 With respect to the argument that an\nasset-based allocator is not appropriate, Ms. Tumminello testified that the functions covered by this\nproject code relate to the oversight of all system operations and the stewardship of corporate assets\nand that because ETI is part of a corporate group, the allocated charges associated with these services\nare relevant to ETI as part of that group. Furthermore, ETI argues, the asset-based allocator is\nappropriate because it reflects the cause of the costs incurred, in that services provided relate to the\nstewardship of all the corporation's assets. 757\n\n\n         Dr. Szerszen took too narrow a view and, without justification, argued that these costs\nprovide no benefit to Texas ratepayers. There are innumerable benefits provided by the corporate\nstructure adopted; those mentioned by Mr. Domino are just a few. Ms. Tumminello's testimony\nexplained why an asset-based allocator is appropriate. Accordingly, the AUs recommend the\nCommission approve the inclusion of these costs as requested by ETI.\n\n\n\n\n755\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 56-57.\n756\n      Tr. at 141.\n757\n      ETI Ex. 69 (Tumminello Rebuttal) at 9-11.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE218\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          3. Project F3PCR73345 (Quick Payment Center, Adm)\n\n          Dr. Szerszen recommended that these costs be reallocated using the CUSTCALL billing\nmethod. Given ESI's demonstrated tracking capabilities, Dr. Szerszen reallocated the costs of this\nproject using a 10.8 percent customer call allocator, which is on the low end of the\n10.70 percent-11.04 percent Test-Year CUSTCALL allocators. 758 As a result of Dr. Szerszen's\nreallocation, $14,484 associated with this project should, according to Dr. Szerszen, be\ndisallowed.759\n\n\n          ETI witness Stokes responded, stating that Dr. Szerszen's proposed reallocation is arbitrary\nand fails to consider the cost causation associated with the actual project code at issue. These costs\nare not driven by a specific proportion of calls from each Operating Company (that is, by the\nCUSTCALL allocator). The costs captured by Project F3PCR73345 reflect the costs of overseeing\nthe Quick Payment Center vendors in each of the Entergy Operating Companies, regardless of the\nnumber of calls by customers to the Company. 760\n\n\n          The AI.Js are persuaded that the allocation methodology chosen by ETI is the superior\nmethod and that the CUSTCALL allocator would not be appropriate given the cost causation\nassociated with the project. Accordingly, the AI.Js recommend the Commission approve the costs\nproposed by ETI.\n\n\n          4. Project F3PCF23936 (Manage Cash)\n\n          Dr. Szerszen recommended disallowance of $15,677 from Project F3PCF23936 (Manage\nCash), arguing that this project: (1) is duplicative of ETl-specific financing and cash management\n\n\n\n\n758\n      OPC Exhibit No. 27 (ETI' s Ex. SBT-15, Attachment 6) at 2; Tr. at 838-839.\n759\n      OPC Exhibit No. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 77 and 118.\n760\n      ETI Ex. 66 (Stokes Rebuttal) at 11.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE219\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nactivates; (2) the allocator is wrong; and (3) Entergy, not ETI ratepayers, should pay for this\nactivity. 761\n\n\n          ETI witness McNeal testified that the services are not duplicative of the cash management\nservices performed by the Cash Management department in the Treasury Class. The services\nprovided under Project F3PCF23936 are associated with daily cash management responsibilities,\nsuch as loading bank balances, setting daily cash position for all the Entergy Companies, transmitting\nwire/ACH files to Entergy Company banks for vendor payments, and maintaining proper cash\ncontrols over these cash functions. These services are necessary for the daily operation of all the\nEntergy Companies, including ETI, and are thus not directly associated with any one specific legal\nentity. The costs are driven by the time spent on the daily cash management activities, which is\ndirectly related to the number of bank accounts that the Entergy Companies have open. Since the\nservices provided under this project code cannot be identified to a particular Entergy Company, the\nbilling method based on the number of open bank accounts is the best allocation. Billing method\nBNKACCTA does that and, according to Mr. McNeal, is therefore appropriate for allocating costs\nfor this project code. 762\n\n\n          The evidence demonstrates that the activities captured by this project code are not directly\nassociated with any one specific entity; rather, they benefit all the entities under the Entergy\numbrella. It also appears that a billing method based on the number of open bank accounts is the\nappropriate allocation methodology. Accordingly, the ALls recommend the Commission approve\ninclusion of costs as requested by ETI.\n\n\nI.        Human Resources Class\n\n          Dr. Szerszen recommended dis allowances for three project codes that are primarily within the\nHuman Resources Class of affiliate costs: (1) F3PCHRCCSM (HR Competitive Compensation) for\na disallowance of $20,146; (2) FSPCZUBENQ (Non-Qualified Post-Retirement) for a disallowance\n\n\n761\n      OPC Ex. l (Szerszen Direct) at 74 and Schedule CAS-15.\n762\n      ETI Ex. 61 (McNeal Rebuttal) at 4, 6; Tr. at 546-547.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                          PAGE220\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nof $115,078; and (3) F5PPZNQBDU (Non-Qual Pension/Benf-Dom Utl) for a disallowance of\n$241,073. 763\n\n\n          1. Project F3PCHRCCSM (HR Competitive Compensation)\n\n          Dr. Szerszen testified that an asset-based allocator is not appropriate for a project, such as\nProject F3PCHRCCSM, that captures overall executive management-related costs.764\n\n\n          ETI contends that the functions covered by this project code relate to the oversight of all\nsystem operations and the stewardship of corporate assets and that because ETI is part of a corporate\ngroup, the allocated charges associated with these services are relevant to ETI as part of that group of\ncompanies. Furthermore, ETI argues, the asset-based allocator is appropriate because it reflects the\ncause of the costs incurred, in that services provided relate to the stewardship of all the corporation's\nassets. 765\n\n\n          A corporation cannot function without executives, who are charged with the responsibility of\noverseeing, among other things, the assets of the corporation. This is an important function that\nDr. Szerszen did not acknowledge in her testimony. The utility and executive management class\ncosts that she challenged are reasonable and necessary costs that are allocated to ETI based on a\nlogical allocator - the assets the executives are charged with overseeing. The AU s recommend that\nOPC' s challenge be rejected.\n\n\n          2. Projects FSPCZUBENQ (Non-Qualified Post-Retirement) and FSPPZNQBDU\n             (Non-Qual Pension/Benf-Dom Utl)\n\n          With respect to Projects F5PCZUBENQ and F5PPZNQBDU, Dr. Szerszen testified that:\n(1) there is no evidence that Texas ratepayers benefit from the pension-related benefits in these\n\n\n\n\n763\n      OPC Ex.

The AUs, however, have already\nresolved this issue in their discussions related to Section VII.D.4, above, where they concluded that\nthat the supplemental executive retirement plans are not reasonable and necessary for the provision\nof electric utility service and are not in the public interest. Accordingly, the Al.Js recommend the\nCommission accept OPC' s proposed disallowance of $356, 151 (which includes the $112,531 agreed\nto by ETI).\n\n\nJ.        Information Technology Class\n\n          Dr. Szerszen recommended disallowances in two project codes that are primarily within\nETI's Information Technology Class: (1) F3PPFXERSP (Evaluated Receipts Settlement) for a\ndisallowance of $10,279; and (2) F3PCFX3555 (BOD/Executive Support) for a disallowance of\n$3,148. 768\n\n\n          1. F3PPFXERSP (Evaluated Receipts Settlement)\n\n          Dr. Szerszen testified that Project F3PPFXERSP is not moving forward due to tax and freight\nimplications and, as such, the cost is not recurring. 769 Ms. Tumminello testified in response that the\n\"Evaluated Receipt Settlement\" program was originally being capitalized in a capital project. But\nwhen it was decided that the program would be cancelled, the capital project was closed and the\ncharges to the project were expensed. Although the costs for this particular project do not recur\n\n\n766\n      OPC Ex. l (Szerszen Direct) at 68.\n767\n      ETIInitial Brief at 179.\n768\n      OPC Ex. l (Szerszen Direct) at 56, 71.\n769\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 71.\n\fSOAHDOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE222\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nevery year, they are part of normal utility operations, and this type of project does recur as\nnecessary.770\n\n\n          Although the AU s understand the concept of normally recurring cost types, they do not\nbelieve that the costs captured by this project code fall within that category. Those costs related to a\nproject that was cancelled and sufficient explanation of how similar projects in the future might\noccur was not provided. Accordingly, the ALls recommend the Commission reject inclusion, as\nproposed by OPC.\n\n\n          2. Project F3PCFX3555 (BOD/Executive Support)\n\n          Dr. Szerszen argued that Project F3PCFX3555 is an executive-related project that does not\nprovide perceivable benefits to ETI ratepayers, the Entergy shareholders should bear this cost, and an\nassets-based allocator is not appropriate. 771\n\n\n          ETI argues that the functions covered by this project code relate to the oversight of all system\noperations and the stewardship of corporate assets and that because ETI is part of a corporate group,\nthe allocated charges associated with these services are relevant to ETI as part of that group of\ncompanies. Furthermore, ETI argues, the asset-based allocator is appropriate because it reflects the\ncause of the costs incurred, in that services provided relate to the stewardship of all the corporation's\nassets. 772\n\n\n          A corporation cannot function without executives who are charged with the responsibility of\noverseeing, among other things, the assets of the corporation. This is an important function that\nDr. Szerszen did not acknowledge in her arguments. The utility and executive management class\ncosts that she challenged are reasonable and necessary costs that are allocated to ETI based on a\nlogical allocator- the assets the executives are charged with overseeing. The AU s recommend that\nOPC's challenge be rejected.\n\n\n\n770\n      ETI Ex. 69 (Tumminello Rebuttal) at SBT-R-2 at 4.\n771\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 56.\n\fSOAHDOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE223\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nK.        Internal and External Communications Class\n\n          Dr. Szerszen recommended disallowances in four project codes that are primarily within\nETI' s Internal and External Communications Class: ( 1) F3PCR40118 (Utility Communications for a\n$6 disallowance; (2) FSPCZPDEPT (Supervision and Support- Public) for a $138 disallowance;\n(3) FSPPICCOOO (Integrated Customer Communications) for a $199 disallowance; and\n(4) FSPPICCEMP (ICC - Employee Education Initiative) for a $3 disallowance.773\n\n\n          ETI witness Tumminello responded to Dr. Szerszen's claim that the costs captured by these\nproject codes are corporate image costs by stating that the costs are for advertising activities that are\nof a good will or institutional nature, which is primarily designed to improve the image of the utility\nor the industry, including advertisement which inform the public concerning matters affecting the\nCompany's operations, such as, the costs of providing service, the Company's efforts to improve the\nquality of service, the Company's efforts to improve and protect the environment. According to\nFERC, such costs are properly includable inFERCAccount 930.1 and are recoverable. According to\nMs. Tumminello, as contemplated by FERC, the fact that ETI is a monopoly has no bearing on the\nrecoverability of these costs. 774\n\n\n          OPC provided little support for its claim that costs covered by these project codes should not\nbe recoverable, essentially limiting the basis to the contention that ETI is a monopoly and ratepayers\nshould not be charged with such costs. ETI did little better, but it did provide the testimony of\nMs. Tumminello, which confirms that the costs are properly includable in FERC Account 930.1 and\nare, therefore, recoverable. In the end, the AUs must go with the weight of the evidence, which is in\nETI's favor. The AUs recommend the Commission reject OPC's contention that costs covered by\nthese project codes are not recoverable.\n\n\n\n\n772\n      ETI Ex. 4 (Domino Direct) at 18-38; ETI Ex. 69 (Tumminello Rebuttal) at 9-11.\n773\n      OPC Ex. l (Szerszen Direct) at 66.\n714\n      ETI Ex. 69 (Tumminello Rebuttal) at SBT-R-2 at 4-6.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                   PAGE224\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nL.      Legal Services Class\n\n        Dr. Szerszen recommended disallowances in 13 project codes that are primarily within the\nLegal Services Class: (1) F3PPCASHCT (Contractual Altemative/Cashpo) for a disallowance of\n$2,553; (2) F3PCF99180 (CORP.

Project F3PPCASHCT (Contractual Altemative/Cashpo)\n\n        With respect to Project F3PPCASHCT ($2,553 disallowance), ETI agrees that these costs are\nnon-recurring and should be disallowed. Accordingly, the AUs recommend the Commission\nexclude those costs.\n\n\n        2. Project FSPCZLDEPT (Supervision & Support - Legal)\n\n        As to Project F5PCZLDEPT ($225,794), OPC, through its Second Errata, removed that\nproposed disallowance, and it is no longer contested by Dr. Szerszen. Accordingly, the AUs\nrecommend the Commission approve inclusion of those costs.\n\n\n\n\n775\n    Dr. Szerszen also proposed disallowance of $765 in charges for related Project Code F3PPTDHY 19 (Dept.\nof Justice Investigation), which is actually primarily attributable to the Transmission Operations Class, rather\nthan the Legal Services Class. Because the issues are intertwined, that project will be discussed here, rather\nthan in the Transmission Operations Class.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE225\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          3. Project F3PCF99180 (Corp. Compliance Tracking Sys)\n\n          F3PCF99180 (Corp. Compliance Tracking Sys) is one of the project codes that Dr. Szerszen\nclaimed should be disallowed because ETI is a monopoly and Texas ratepayers should not have to\npay for corporate image costs. 776\n\n\n          ETI witness Tumminello testified that these costs are for advertising activities that are of a\ngood will or institutional nature, which is primarily designed to improve the image of the utility or\nthe industry, including advertisement which inform the public concerning matters affecting the\nCompany's operations, such as, the costs of providing service, the Company's efforts to improve the\nquality of service, the Company's efforts to improve and protect the environment. According to\nFERC, such costs are properly includable in FERC Account 930.1 and are recoverable. According to\nMs. Tumminello, as contemplated by FERC, the fact that ETI is a monopoly has no bearing on the\nrecoverability of these costs. 777\n\n\n          OPC provided little support for its claim that costs covered by these project codes should not\nbe recoverable, essentially limiting the basis to the contention that ETI is a monopoly and ratepayers\nshould not be charged with such costs. ETI did little better, but it did provide the testimony of\nMs. Tumminello, which confirms that the costs are properly includable in FERC Account 930.1 and\nare, therefore, recoverable. The weight of the evidence is in ETI' s favor. The ALls recommend the\nCommission reject OPC' s contention that costs covered by these project codes are not recoverable.\n\n\n          4. Projects F3PPINVDOJ (DOJ Anti Trust Investigation) and F3PPTDHY19 (Dept. of\n             Justice Investigation)\n\n          Entergy is currently under investigation by the Department of Justice (DOJ) for certain\nbusiness practices of the Operating Companies, including the procurement of generating assets and\npower, dispatch of generation within the Entergy system, and transmission capacity expansion. This\nis a civil investigation under Section 2 of the Sherman Act and Section 7 of the Clayton Act. The\n\n\n776\n      OPC Ex. I (Szerszen Direct) at 66.\n777\n      ETI Ex. 69 (Tumminello Rebuttal) at SBT-R-2 at 4-6.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                        PAGE226\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ninvestigation has been ongoing since 2010, and Entergy does not know when the investigation will\nconclude. 778\n\n\n          Dr. Szerszen testified that there are two reasons why ratepayers should not pay for the DOJ\nexpenses. First, ETI does not have the ability to make its own power procurement, generation\ndispatch, or transmission capacity decisions. These decisions are made by ESI and Entergy' s\ncorporate management, which has traditionally planned and managed the electric operating\ncompanies' generation and transmission functions on a system-wide basis. Second, ETI is not\nresponsible for the development and administration of the system agreement, and should not be held\nresponsible for these antitrust investigation expenses. Furthermore, according to Dr. Szerszen, if the\nDOJ finds that Entergy has acted illegally, it is even more inappropriate to charge ETI ratepayers for\ncorporate-level illegal actions. These expenses should be borne by Entergy's corporate parent and/or\nthe corporation's shareholders, and not the ratepayers. 779\n\n\n           ETI contends that Dr. Szerszen fundamentally misunderstands the nature of the System\nAgreement and the benefits that ETI derives from that agreement. All of the Entergy Operating\nCompanies voluntarily entered into the System Agreement so that the Entergy system can be planned\nand operated on a total system basis, in order to maximize economic benefit and reliability of\nservice. All of the Operating Companies benefit from integrated planning and operations in this\nmanner. This does not mean that ETI has no decision-making role in these activities. ETI notes that\nunder Section 5.01 of the System Agreement, the agreement is administered through an Operating\nCommittee, which includes an ETI representative, as well as representatives of the other Operating\nCompanies and Entergy. ETI' s representative is one of the voting members of the Committee, and\nall decisions of the Operating Committee must be approved by a majority vote. As a voting member\nof the Operating Committee, ETI is responsible for administering the System Agreement and does\nparticipate in decision-making on generation and transmission matters. 780\n\n\n\n778\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 51-52.\n779\n      Id. at 52.\n780\n      ETI Ex. 65 (Sloan Rebuttal) at 8.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE227\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n            ETI acknowledges that ESI is tasked with providing services and making decisions related to\ngeneration dispatch, power procurement, and transmission operations on behalf of the Entergy\nOperating Companies and at the direction of the Operating Committee, but these activities are for the\nbenefit of the Operating Companies and their ratepayers. ETI receives the benefits of these services\nand integrated planning and operations under the System Agreement and, according to ETI, should\nalso be responsible for its portion of costs related to those services and operations. 781\n\n\n            As to Dr. Szerszen' s contention that the costs should be disallowed because DOJ might find\nthat Entergy acted illegally, ETI notes that the DOJ is not an adjudicatory body or regulatory agency\nand, thus, it does not make \"findings of fact.\" If DOJ believes the civil antitrust laws have been\nviolated, it can file a complaint in federal district court. To date, no complaint has been filed. ETI\npoints out that ESI routinely incurs legal costs in responding to regulatory audits and investigations\non behalf of ETI and the other Operating Companies in the same manner in which other operating\ncosts are incurred. ESI is authorized to retain legal counsel on behalf of, and for the benefit of, ETI\nand the other Entergy Operating Companies. ESI is authorized to allocate the respective costs to the\nOperating Companies under a service agreement with the Entergy Operating Companies designated\nas Rate Schedule FERC No. 435. This service agreement is on file with, and was approved by,\nFERC under FER C Docket No. ER07-38-000. 782 Thus, according to ETI, it is appropriate that ETI is\nallocated its share of the costs of legal services related to the DOJ investigation. 783\n\n\n            The DOJ antitrust investigation is a massive undertaking. Unfortunately, it is a part of the\nordinary course of modem business life. OPC's arguments that ESI is solely responsible for\ndecision-making under the System Agreement miss the mark, as pointed out by ETI. It is clear that\nETI and the other Operating Companies play an active role in the decision-making. As to OPC's\narguments about what would happen if Entergy were found to have violated the antitrust laws, those\narguments are little more than speculation. As ETI noted, the DOJ is not an adjudicatory body and\nits investigation can only result in the filing of a complaint in Federal court (if the DOJ believes that\n\n1s1   Id.\n782\n      Entergy Serv.

Until that time, it is imperative for the company to fully respond to the\nDOJ investigation. The Al.Js find that ETI has met its burden of proving that Texas ratepayers\nshould be charged the costs of the DOJ investigation allocated to them by ETI.\n\n\n          S. Project F3PCE01601 (Ferc - Open Access Transmission)\n\n          Project F3PCEO 1601 costs are incurred to manage costs associated with regulatory oversight\nand coordination of the Entergy System Open Access Transmission Service before FERC. OPC\ncontends that not only are most of the FERC dockets accruing costs under Project F3PPEO 1601 no\nlonger open as of December 31, 2011, 784 most of the closed dockets have absolutely nothing to do\nwith Texas operations.785 Furthermore, according to OPC, ETI witness Sloan agreed that only three\nof the dockets shown in OPC Exhibit No. 12 were open at the end of the test year, and one of the\nopen dockets involves a transmission service agreement involving the Missouri Joint Municipal\nElectric Utility Commission and various cities in Missouri and Arkansas.786\n\n\n          ETI responds that the activities in this project relate to oversight and coordination of the\nOATT proceedings before the FERC. Costs billed to this project code are related to ESI's\nrepresentation of the Operating Companies, including ETI, before the FERC on OATT issues.\nRevenues derived from provision of service under the OATT are credited to all of the Operating\nCompanies on a load responsibility ratio basis. ETI' s retail share of these revenues was $168,366\nduring the test period, demonstrating the benefits derived by Texas ratepayers as a result of the\nactivities undertaken through this project code. 787\n\n\n          Activities relating to a company's OATT are not one-time activities; they will continue from\nyear to year. OPC's contention that because most of the dockets listed as having taken place during\nthe Test Year were completed by the end of the Test Year they should be disregarded is not\n\n\n784\n      OPC Ex. 12 (OPC RPI No. 7-3); OPC Ex. 3 (Szerszen Workpapers) at 363.\n785\n      OPC Ex. 12 (OPC RFI No. 7-3); OPC Ex. l (Szerszen Direct) at 54.\n786\n      Tr. at 280.\n787\n      ETI Ex. 65 (Sloan Rebuttal) at 10.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                               PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE229\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nwell-founded. It is clear that the activities covered by this project code not only benefit ETI' s Texas\nratepayers, but will continue (albeit under new docket numbers) into future years. The AUs\nrecommend that costs under this project code be allowed.\n\n\n          6. Project F3PCERAKTL (RAKTL Patent Matter)\n\n          The costs under this project code involve the RAKTL patent, which relates to call center\noperations. RAKTL is a patent infringement claim lodged against several Entergy companies. The\nalleged patents are for voice prompting technology used in call centers. 788\n\n\n          Dr. Szerszen testified that it is not appropriate to charge ETI for the costs associated with this\nlitigation because ETI did not purchase the call center telephone equipment at issue, and therefore\nshould not be required to pay any legal costs associated with patent infringement investigation or\nsettlement costs. ESI is totally responsible for system-wide technology purchases and operations,\nand, according to Dr. Szerszen, it is not reasonable to require the operating companies to pay legal\ncosts associated with ESI technology acquisition or technology application errors.789\n\n\n          ETI contends that ESI incurred the legal expenses on this patent matter on behalf of the\nEntergy Operating Companies, whose residential and small commercial customers call into the call\ncenters to obtain customer service for issues related to connection and disconnection of electric\nservice, billing issues, and other customer transactions. The call centers provide an interface\nbetween ETI customers and the Entergy Operating Companies and, as such, are valuable in providing\nquality service to customers. Consequently, according to ETI, costs related to the call centers,\nincluding the costs of defending lawsuits involving technologies used at those call centers, is a\nreasonable and necessary expense that is appropriately allocated to ETI.790\n\n\n          OPC tends to ignore the purpose and benefits of a centralized service company such as ESL\nIf ETI were to fund stand-alone call centers, it is likely that the costs to Texas ratepayers would be\n\n\n788\n      Id. at 4; OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 49-50.\n789\n      OPC Ex.

Part of the costs that ESI incurs is the cost of patent\nclaims. Those are legitimate costs that should be borne by all who receive service from ESI.\nAccordingly, the ALls recommend the Commission reject OPC's challenge.\n\n\n          7. Project F3PPEASTIN (Willard Eastin et al.)\n\n          This project code, which contains costs in the amount of $19,714, collects costs related to an\nage discrimination law suit filed by Willard Eastin, et al. against Entergy. The defendants to the\nlawsuit were Entergy, ESI, Entergy Louisiana, fuc. (ELL), and Entergy New Orleans, fuc. (ENOI).\nThe plaintiffs to the lawsuit were employees of ESI, ELL, and ENOI.791\n\n\n          OPC witness Szerszen testified that ETI should not be required to pay any of the costs of this\nlitigation. Although ESI provides services to the Operating Companies, this does not imply that the\nOperating Companies should be charged costs associated with the service company's employment\n                                                            792\npractice problems or errors according to Dr. Szerszen.\n\n\n          ETI argues that costs are driven by ESI having the need for legal services to defend itself. As\nshown on the Project Code Summary for this project, since all ESI functions are in service to the\nvarious affiliates and arise as a consequence of providing such services, it is appropriate to relate\nthese legal costs to the total ESI billings to the affiliates. 793\n\n\n          ETI has provided little in the way of explanation regarding these costs or the litigation that\ngenerated them. What is troubling to the AUs is that the only named defendants are Entergy, ESI,\nELL, and ENOI; ETI is not included among the named defendants. If this were simply a cost of\ndoing business for ESI, as claimed by ETI, why were ELL and ENOI named? No explanation was\noffered. It appears to the ALls that although this litigation is related to ESI's operations, it is more\n\n\n\n790\n      ETI Ex. 65 (Sloan Rebuttal) at 4.\n791\n      ETI Ex. 65 (Sloan Rebuttal) at 2; OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 49-50.\n792\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 50.\n793\n      ETI Ex. 65 (Sloan Rebuttal) at 2.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                               PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE231\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nimmediately related to ELL and ENOI. The AUs do not believe that ETI's Texas ratepayers should\nbe charged for these costs; therefore the AUs recommend that $19,714 not be included.\n\n\n          8. Project F3PPTCGS11 {TX Docket Competitive Generation)\n\n          The costs billed through this project code all pertain to ETI' s CGS matter currently pending\nbefore the Commission in Docket No. 38951. 794\n\n\n          OPC witness Szerszen testified that because no decision has been made yet as to the\ndisposition of the expenses associated with the CGS tariff, ETI should not be expensing the costs\nassociated with that docket.         Dr. Szerszen disallowed $310,746 in Test-Year expenses, and\nrecommended that ETI be allowed to defer the expenses until the Commission determines the\nappropriate regulatory treatment. 795\n\n\n          ETI argues that these costs were incurred during the Test Year in a pending Commission\ndocket, and ETI continues to incur costs related to this matter. As such, according to ETI, these costs\nare appropriately included in ETI' s cost of service and should neither be disallowed nor deferred.7 96\n\n\n          OPC's arguments with respect to these costs are not well-founded. It appears to be likening\nthese regulatory costs to rate case expense, which would be subject to Commission review and\napproval in the proceeding to which they relate. But that is not the nature of these expenses. They\nare simply regulatory expenses incurred in the course of ongoing regulatory proceedings. They are\nordinary and necessary expenses, the reasonableness of which OPC did not challenge. Accordingly,\nthe AU s find that it is appropriate for ETI to charge these expenses to its Texas ratepayers.\n\n\n\n\n794\n      Id. at 5; OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 50.\n795\n      OPC Ex. l (Szerszen Direct) at 50.\n796\n      ETI Ex. 65 (Sloan Rebuttal) at 5.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE232\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n            9. Project FSPCE13759 (Jenkins Class Action Suit)\n\n            The project code relates to a class action lawsuit filed in Texas District Court in 2003 on\nbehalf of all Texas retail customers served by ETI's predecessor-in-interest, EGSI (Jenkins Class\nAction). The Jenkins Class Action plaintiffs allege that they have been damaged due to manipulation\nof the dispatch and pricing of the Entergy system's generating units and electricity purchases. As a\nresult of this alleged manipulation, they contend that ETI's Texas retail customers were charged\nmore than they should have been for purchased power.797 Dr. Szerszen asserted there are three\nreasons why these legal expenses should not be borne by ETI:\n\n\n•     ESI charges 100 percent of the legal expenses to ETI, even though ETI is only one of several\n      defendants;\n\n•     ETI claims that it is defending practices relating to system operations, but fails              to\n      acknowledge that Entergy' s system operations are comprised of many generation                 and\n      transmission components other than those of ETI; and\n\n•     ETI does not have any authority to administer the System Agreement, that           being a function\n      solely within the purview of ESI.798\n\nDr. Szerszen testified that \"[i]t would be more appropriate for the Entergy parent to be charged for\nthese lawsuit expenses, particularly since ETI cannot make unilateral power purchases and power\nsales decisions.\"799\n\n\n            ETI responds that the plaintiffs in this lawsuit are challenging the reasonableness of ETI' s\nCommission-set rates and that the Commission has filed an amicus brief in support of ETI' s position\nin the case. ETI further argues that retail ratepayers are benefitting from ETI' s pursuit of the\nlitigation because ETI is defending practices that are in place to ensure the lowest reasonable cost\nconsistent with system reliability. Finally, ETI states that the costs are reasonable and necessary\n\n\n\n\n797\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 49; ETI Ex. 65 (Sloan Rebuttal) at 2-3.\n798\n      OPC Ex. l (Szerszen Direct) at 49.\n799   Id.\n\fSOAHDOCKET N O . -                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                          PAGE233\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nexpenses because the plaintiffs purport to represent only ETI's ratepayers and seek to recover\ndamages inconsistent with ETI' s filed rates approved by the Commission. 800\n\n\n          The ALls understand Dr. Szerszen's concerns that there are multiple defendants involved in\nthis litigation, there are many aspects to Entergy' s system operations, and ETI does not have power\nto unilaterally make decisions under the System Agreement. The crucial point, however, is that these\nare Texas ratepayers pursuing a challenge to ETI's Texas rates. The matter centers around Texas,\nand the costs of the litigation should be borne by Texas ratepayers.\n\n\n          10. Project F3PCSYSAGR (System Agreement-2001)\n\n          OPC witness Szerszen disallowed $880,841 in legal expenses regarding the 2001 complaint\nfiled by the Louisiana Public Service Commission and the City of New Orleans seeking revisions to\nthe Entergy System Agreement. 801 OPC states that it generally agrees with ETI witness Sloan that\nthe complaint challenges the equalization of costs between all Entergy Operating Company\njurisdictions. 802 However, OPC does not agree that the inquiry \"will\" affect all Entergy jurisdictions.\nTexas has benefitted from the complaint primarily through the past receipt of equalization payments\npursuant to FERC's decision in this complaint matter. However, Entergy's SEC FormlO-K shows\nthat for 2012 and 2013, ETI will receive no equalization payments, and further shows that ETI\nreceived no rough production cost equalization payments in 2010. 803 Thus, according to OPC, the\nlegal expenses sought to be recovered under Project F3PCSYSAGR are non-recurring for ETI and\ntherefore not representative of future costs and should be removed from ETI' s cost of service. 804\n\n\n          ETI established that this litigation involved the System Agreement, which governs the\nequalization of costs between all of the Entergy Operating Company jurisdictions, it provides\nbenefits to ETI's Texas ratepayers as well as those of the other Entergy Operating Companies.\n\n800\n      ETI Ex. 65 (Sloan Rebuttal) at 3.\n801\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 53.\n802\n      ETI Ex. 65 (Sloan Rebuttal) at 9.\n803\n      ETI Ex. 98 (Entergy's SEC Fonn 10-K) at 79-80.\n804\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 52-53.\n\fSOAHDOCKET N O . -                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE234\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nOPC' s argument that ETI did not receive equalization payments in 2010 and is non-recurring for ETI\ndoes not overcome the benefits received by ETI's Texas ratepayers. The ALls recommend that\nOPC's disallowance be denied.\n\n\n          11. Project F3PCCDVDAT (Corporate Development Data Room)\n\n          ETI requests the recovery of $6, 147 in ESI allocated costs for the corporate development data\nroom. The stated purpose of the data room is for due diligence reviews associated with Entergy\nmerger, acquisition, or diversification activities. The expenses associated with the corporate\ndevelopment data room are for the gathering, collating, indexing, manning, and storage of data\nduring the due diligence reviews. 805 OPC contends that the costs incurred for the corporation's\nanalysis of merger, acquisition, and diversification opportunities should not be charged to ETI's\nratepayers.     Entergy has not acquired any utilities or utility operations that might produce\nsystem-wide benefits to utility customers. 806 The $6, 147 of expenses for the corporate development\nroom are not reasonable and necessary expenses that ratepayers should shoulder and therefore,\naccording to OPC, recovery of these expenses should be disallowed.\n\n\n          ETI responds that these costs are driven by each company's need for corporate services and\nthe costs, therefore, are appropriately allocated based on the level of service provided by ESI, which\nis a reasonable proxy of each company's need for corporate services. 807 Further, just because\nEntergy has not acquired any utility or utility operations in the recent past does not mean that these\nare not reasonable and necessary costs. Entergy points out that as Dr. Szerszen noted in her\ndescription of this project, it is not only for the acquisition of other operating units, but also used to\nanalyze diversification activities, which is a legitimate and reasonable undertaking by an integrated\nutility and its parent company.\n\n\n\n\n805\n      OPC Ex. 3 (Szerszen Workpapers) at 394.\n806\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 45-46.\n807\n      ETI Ex. 69 (Tumminello Rebuttal) Ex.

As Ms. Tumminello testified, the Corporate Development Data Room\nincludes costs not only related to mergers and acquisitions, but also diversification activities that\ncould benefit ETI ratepayers. Accordingly, they are properly allocated to ETI ratepayers.\n\n\n          12. Project F3PPWET302 (SPO 2008 Winter Western Region)\n\n          Dr. Szerszen argued that Project F3PPWET302 costs should be disregarded because they\nwere incurred during the 2008-2009 period, which is outside of the Test Year, and they are\nnonrecurring. 808\n\n          ETI witness Cicio explained that although this project was initiated prior to the Test Year, the\ncosts that the Company seeks to recover through this project code were expenses incurred during the\nTest Year. These costs included development activities, requests for proposal issuance, bidders'\nconferences, written and posted questions and answers from market participants and other interested\nparties, submission of proposals, screening of proposals, proposal evaluation, follow-up questions\nand clarifications, recommendations and awards, contract negotiations, Independent Monitor reports,\nand regulatory approvals, if necessary. He stated that these types of costs routinely encompass a\nmulti-year time frame, and the costs required to perform those activities, although associated with a\nproject that may have been initiated several years previously, are properly incurred over the life span\nof the project. He also stated that they are recurring because they reflect the kinds and levels of\ncharges that would be expected to be incurred on an ongoing basis in association with request for\nproposals managed by ESI on behalf of the Entergy Operating Companies, and the Company has\nbeen involved in these types of solicitations since 2002. 809\n\n\n          The AU s find that the costs captured by Project F3PPWET302 were incurred during the Test\nYear and represent the kinds and levels of costs routinely incurred on a recurring basis. Accordingly,\nthe AUs recommend the Commission approve their inclusion as requested by ETI.\n\n\n\n808\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerzen Direct) at 65.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                          PAGE236\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          13. Project F3PPWET308 (SPO Calpine PPA/Project Houston)\n\n          With respect to Project F3PPWET308, which deals with the Calpine-Carville purchased\npower agreement, Dr. Szerszen testified that the costs were either non-recurring, or rate case\nexpenses, or expenses that should have been charged to Louisiana ratepayers. 810\n\n\n          ETI witness Cicio explained that these are recurring costs because they reflect the kinds and\nlevels of charges that the Company expects to incur on an ongoing basis in association with RFPs\nmanaged by ESI on behalf of the Entergy Operating Companies; they were not incurred as part of\nsome rate case preparation and, therefore, are not a rate case expense that is otherwise sought for\nrecovery by ETI; and the costs in the matter are costs that were billed only to Texas and should not\nhave been billed to Louisiana because there is a separate project code that captures the Louisiana\ncosts that are billed to Louisiana. 811\n\n\n          The AU s find that these costs, like those captured by Project F3PPWET302, are recurring in\nthat they represent the kinds and levels of costs routinely incurred on a year-in and year-out basis.\nFurther, the AU s find that the costs should not have been charged to Louisiana and that there existed\na separate project code to capture costs attributable to Louisiana. Accordingly, the AU s recommend\nthe Commission approve the inclusion of these costs as requested by ETI.\n\n\nM.        Other Expenses Class\n\n          Dr. Szerszen recommended disallowances in 11 project codes that are primarily within the\nOther Expenses Class of affiliate costs: (1) F3PCSPETEI (Entergy-Tulane Energy Institute) for a\ndisallowance of $14,288; (2) F3PCC08500 (Executive VP, Operations) for a disallowance of $4, 117;\n(3) F3PPBFMESI (ESI Function Migration Relocation) for a disallowance of $4,187;\n(4) F3PPBFRESI (ESI Business Function Relocation) for a disallowance of $11,444;\n(5) F3PPDRPESI (ESI Disaster Recovery Plan Charge) for a disallowance of $761;\n\n809\n      ETI Ex. 45 (Cicio Rebuttal) at 13-14.\n810\n      OPC Ex.

Projects F3PCSPETEI (Entergy-Tulane Energy Institute) and F5PPKATRPT\n             (Storm Cost Processing & Review)\n\n          ETI agrees with Dr. Szerszen that the $14,288 amount she proposed to disallow for Project\nF3PCSPETEI (Entergy-Tulane Energy Institute) can be treated as a donation, and so should be\nremoved from ETI' s cost of service. ETI also agrees with Dr. Szerszen to remove the $929 billed to\nETI under Project F5PPKATRPT (Storm Cost Processing & Review).                  The charges for the\nremaining nine project codes, however, are contested.\n\n\n          2. Project F3PCC08500 (Executive VP, Operations)\n\n          As to Project F3PCC08500 (Executive VP Operations), Dr. Szerszen testified that an\nasset-based allocator is not appropriate for these types of executive management costs, and there is\n\"no perceivable benefit\" to ETI ratepayers for these types of allocated costs. 813\n\n\n          Ms. Tumminello disagreed, stating that asset-based allocation methods are selected for\nprojects where the costs are driven by the oversight and stewardship of corporate assets of the\nEntergy Companies including, but not limited to, services provided by financial management and\ncertain finance functions, among others. Each Entergy affiliate with assets on Entergy' s consolidated\nbalance sheet will be billed their proportionate share of the costs.

Dr. Szerszen testified that these costs should be disallowed because they should\nnot be considered to be system restoration costs or, if they are, citing to PURA§ 36.405, ETI should\nhave requested recovery of these costs in its first base rate following Hurricane Katrina (Docket\nNo. 34800). She also testified that ETI has not shown that Texas ratepayers benefited from these\ncosts. 815\n\n\n          Ms. Tumminello testified that because of the magnitude of Hurricane Katrina, these expenses\nwere necessary so that activities in connection with the restoration of service and infrastructure\nassociated with electric power outages affecting customers could continue. These expenses relate to\ncritical functions needed to support storm restoration, such as business function relocation, and\nprovided a direct benefit to ratepayers. Ms. Tumminello stated that the costs in seven of these\nproject codes (F3PPBFMESI, F3PPBFRESI, F3PPDRPESI, F5PPBFMREL, F5PPBFRREL,\nF5PPBFRSEV, and F5PPDRPREL) are being amortized over five years.

That section deals with securitization of system restoration costs, but ETI did not seek to\nsecuritize any Hurricane Katrina costs. Even so, argues ETI, if that section did apply, it does not\nrestrict system restoration cost recovery solely to Docket No. 34800; that is, the \"next base rate\nproceeding\" following the hurricane. Instead, the final clause in PURA§ 36.405(a) states in full that\nthe Company is entitled to recover such costs \"in its next base rate proceeding or through any other\nproceeding authorized by Subchapter C or D.\" The same point applies to the Hurricane Ike costs;\nwhile ETI did securitize the Hurricane Ike costs that it had incurred up to the date subject to that\nsecuritization, it continued to incur costs in this test year for that storm restoration (in this case, $441\nbilled to the Ike-related project code). The costs in these projects were incurred during the test year\nfor this docket and could not have been recovered in an earlier docket. Moreover, ETI' s filing in this\ndocket was filed in accordance with PURA Subchapter C as a rate change proposed by a utility. As\nsuch, ETI contends that it is entitled to recover these costs. 817\n\n\n          To the AU s, the most important part of the argument is that ETI did not seek to avail itself of\nPURA § 36.405 with respect to Hurricane Katrina costs. It is difficult to understand how that\nsection, which deals with securitization of hurricane costs, could block recovery when ETI did not\nseek to securitize those costs. Similarly, with respect to Hurricane Ike costs, the $441 challenged by\nDr. Szerszen was not incurred until the Test Year and could not have been securitized.\nMs. Tumminello provided testimony that the costs were reasonable and necessary, representing a\npart of ETI' s normal utility operations. Accordingly, the AU s recommend the Commission approve\ninclusion of the costs.\n\n\n\n\n816\n      ETI Ex. 69 (Tumminello Rebuttal) atl6.\n817\n      ETI Initial Brief at 188-189.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                 PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                         PAGE 240\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nN.        Regulatory Services Class\n\n          Dr. Szerszen challenged one project code that is primarily within the Regulatory Services\nClass of affiliate costs: Project F3PPE9981S (Integrated Energy Management for ESI) for a\ndisallowance of $171,032.\n\n\n          Dr. Szerszen testified that these costs were incurred for the implementation, coordination,\nand promotion of demand side and supply side management and energy efficiency programs. But,\nshe stated, these costs should instead have been recovered through ETI' s Energy Efficiency Cost\nRecovery Factor (EECRF) Rider and, as such, it is inappropriate to recover these costs through\naffiliate billings in base rates. 818\n\n\n          ETI witness May testified that recovery of these costs through base rates rather than through\nthe EECRF Rider is appropriate because these activities are not subject to an active ETI energy\nefficiency program. These activities are more in the nature of general research and development\nactivities that help drive the Company's strategy on these topics, such as the timing of implementing\nrelated programs. In the meantime, until these activities result in an actual program proposal, these\nare legitimate known and measurable costs that the Company has incurred and should then be\nrecovered from retail customers. 819 At the hearing, Mr. May further explained that the costs in this\nproject code are labor costs that are \"not really consistent\" with the energy efficiency rule, but\ninstead involve \"primarily costs of investigating\" potential future activities (such as smart meters and\nelectric vehicle chargers) that are generally not consistent with the energy efficiency rider. 820 ETI\nwitness Considine also addresses this issue from a regulatory accounting perspective. He testified:\n\"Because these are not costs that must be, or are currently being recovered through the EECRF, they\nare not double recovered and should be included in the Company's cost of service.\" 821 According to\n\n\n\n\n818\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 69-70.\n819\n      ETI Ex. 57 (May Rebuttal) at 30-31.\n820\n      Tr. at 1929-1930 and 1934-1935.\n821\n      ETI Ex. 46 (Considine Rebuttal) at 36.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE241\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nETI, the costs in this project code, therefore, are not costs that should or can be recovered through\nETI's EECRF Rider.\n\n\n          This is a close call. The Commission's Energy Efficiency Rule places limits on the amount\nof research and development costs a utility may recover, 822 which supports the argument that the\ncosts should be included in the EECRF.            Further, it appears to the ALls that research and\ndevelopment costs, by their very nature, do not relate to an active program, which negates many of\nthe arguments advanced by ETI witnesses May and Considine. In the end, the ALl s believe that\nthese costs should be included in the EECRF. Accordingly, the AUs recommend the Commission\ndisallow costs in the amount of $171,032 relating to Project F3PPE9981S.\n\n\n0.        Retail Operations Class\n\n          Dr. Szerszen challenged three project codes that are primarily within ETI' s Retail Operations\nClass of affiliate costs: (1) F5PPICCIMG (ICC - \"Image\" Message) for a disallowance of $3,912;\n(2) F3PPR56640 (Wholesale - EGS-TX) for a disallowance of $229,938; and (3) F3PPR56920\n(Wholesale - All Jurisdictions) for a disallowance of $333.\n\n\n          1. Project F5PPICCIMG (ICC-\"Image\" Message)\n\n          Project Code F5PPICCIMG (ICC-\"lmage\" Message) is one of the project codes that\nDr. Szerszen testified should be disallowed because ETI is a monopoly and Texas ratepayers should\nnot have to pay for corporate image costs. 823\n\n\n          Ms. Tumminello testified that the costs are for advertising activities that are of a good will or\ninstitutional nature, which is primarily designed to improve the image of the utility or the industry,\nincluding advertisement which inform the public concerning matters affecting the Company's\noperations, such as, the costs of providing service, the Company's efforts to improve the quality of\nservice, the Company's efforts to improve and protect the environment.

According to\nMs. Tumminello, as contemplated by FERC, the fact that ETI is a monopoly has no bearing on the\nrecoverability of these costs. 824\n\n\n          OPC provided little support for its claim that costs covered by these project codes should not\nbe recoverable, essentially limiting the basis to the contention that ETI is a monopoly and ratepayers\nshould not be charged with such costs. ETI did provide the testimony of Ms. Tumminello, which\nconfirms that the costs are properly includable in FERC Account 930.1 and are, therefore,\nrecoverable. In the end, the weight of the evidence is in ETI's favor. The AUs recommend the\nCommission reject OPC' s contention that costs covered by these project codes are not recoverable.\n\n\n          2. Projects F3PPR56640 (Wholesale • EGS-TX) and F3PPR56920 (Wholesale • All\n             Jurisdictions)\n\n          As to Projects F3PPR56640 and F3PPR56920, Dr. Szerszen stated that these costs are\nassociated with assisting ETI' s wholesale customers in evaluating alternative energy supply and\ndemand options and that ETI' s retail customers should not be charged for expenses associated with\nETI' s wholesale customers. 825\n\n\n          ETI witness Stokes noted that ETI has allocated costs to its single large wholesale customer\nthrough its jurisdictional allocation in this rate case and, therefore, to disallow the costs in these two\nproject codes would essentially result in a double disallowance of those costs. She also explained\nthat the costs were properly allocable to ETI (keeping in mind that ETI then allocated costs to this\ncustomer) as reasonable and necessary due to the need to have staff on hand to handle contract\nnegotiations and the like with this large wholesale customer. 826\n\n\n          The AU s are persuaded by ETI' s argument that disallowing the costs associated with\nProjects F3PPR56640 and F3PPR56920, which are already allocated to ETI' s single large wholesale\n\n824\n      ETI Ex. 69 (Tumminello Rebuttal) at SBT-R-2 at 4-6.\n825\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 73.\n826\n      ETI Ex. 66 (Stokes Rebuttal) at 6-9.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE243\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ncustomer through its jurisdictional allocation, would constitute a double disallowance. Accordingly,\nthe Alls recommend the Commission reject OPC's challenge to these costs.\n\n\nP.        Supply Chain Class\n\n          Dr. Szerszen challenged two project codes that are primarily within the Supply Chain Class:\n(1) F3PPH54075 (Business Development-TX) for adisallowance of$1,888; and (2) F5PCZSDEPT\n(Supervision & Support - Supply) for a disallowance of $146. Dr. Szerszen claimed. the costs\nassociated with these project codes should be disallowed because ETI is a monopoly and Texas\nratepayers should not have to pay for corporate image costs. 827\n\n\n          Ms. Tumminello testified that the costs are for advertising activities that are of a good will or\ninstitutional nature, which is primarily designed to improve the image of the utility or the industry,\nincluding advertisement which inform the public concerning matters affecting the Company's\noperations, such as, the costs of providing service, the Company's efforts to improve the quality of\nservice, the Company's efforts to improve and protect the environment, etc. According to FERC,\nsuch costs are properly includable in FERC Account 930.1 and are recoverable. According to\nMs. Tumminello, as contemplated by FERC, the fact that ETI is a monopoly has no bearing on the\nrecoverability of these costs. 828\n\n\n          OPC provided little support for its claim that costs covered by these project codes should not\nbe recoverable, essentially limiting the basis to the contention that ETI is a monopoly. ETI did\nprovide the testimony of Ms. Tumminello, which confirms that the costs are properly includable in\nFERC Account 930.1 and are, therefore, recoverable. The AUs go with the weight of the evidence,\nwhich is in ETI's favor.

Transmission and Distribution Support Class\n\n          Dr. Szerszen challenged three project codes that are included within the Company's\nTransmission and Distribution Support Class of affiliate costs: (1) F3PCT53130 (Operations\nManager, Claims Management) for a disallowance of $42,287.50; (2) F3PCTDAMAG (Damage\nClaims Of Entergy Property) for a disallowance of $5,555; and (3) F3PCTPUBLC (Public Claims)\nfor a disallowance of $3,968. Dr. Szerszen's rationale for disallowing 50 percent of the costs in each\nof these codes is the same. She believes that ETI' s property damage and workers compensation\nclaims should be direct billed instead of allocated through a customer count-based allocator;\nmanagerial and supervisory costs should be allocated to the jurisdictions based on the jurisdictional\ndirect charges; and the Company has not met its burden of proof as to these charges. 829\n\n\n          Ms. Tumminello addressed Project F3PCT53130, stating that workers' compensation claims\nare tracked by jurisdiction as Dr. Szerszen suggested, and are the basis for billing method\nCOMCLAIM. Project F3PCTWCOMP is used to capture the costs of workers' compensation\nclaims, and bills to both regulated and non-regulated affiliates. Project F3PCT53130 captures costs\nthat are primarily for the oversight of the Entergy Companies' Claims Management organization as it\nrelates to property damage and liability. These services benefit only the companies that serve retail\nelectric and gas customers. Since only the regulated utility operating companies (and not the non-\nregulated companies) serve retail customers, it is appropriate to bill these costs to the regulated\ncompanies based on their pro-rata share of total customers. 830\n\n\n          Projects F3PCTDAMAG and F3PCTPUBLC are addressed by ETI witness Corkran. With\nrespect to Project F3PCTDAMAG, Mr. Corkran stated that the costs associated with this project are\nassociated with the Public Claims employees in the Claims Management Organization. Those\nemployees pursue the recovery of claims allowed by law when the public inflicts damage to\nCompany property. The costs of this service are allocated among all of Entergy's Operating\nCompanies through billing method CUSTEGOP, which allocates costs based on the number of\n\n\n829\n      OPC Exhibit No. l (Szerszen Direct) at 79-80.\n830\n      ETI Ex. 69 (Tumminello Rebuttal) at SBT-R-2 at 10.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE245\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ncustomers in each Operating Company. Dr. Szerszen claimed that the affiliate costs associated with\npursuing those claims should be directly charged to each Entergy Operating Company based on the\nextent to which each claim pertains to the Operating Company instead of generally allocating the\ncosts to all utility customers. Mr. Corkran testified that the allocation methodology is appropriate\nbecause the Public Claims employees provide knowledgeable, centralized, and consistent pursuit of\ndamage claims. The actual monies recovered for damage to ETI' s property are returned to ETI\nratepayers as credits against the cost of repairing those damaged facilities, i.e., the recoveries are not\nallocated pursuant to CUSTEGOP. Only the Public Claims employees' time and overheads are\nallocated pursuant to CUSTEGOP, which is reasonable and appropriate because the overall time\nspent by Public Claims employees in pursuing the recovery of claims is driven by the number of gas\nand electric customers in each Operating Company. 831\n\n\n            With respect to Project F3PCTPUBLC, Mr. Corkran stated that the costs associated with this\nproject are related to Public and Auto Liability employees in the Claims Management Organization.\nThese employees pursue the resolution and settlement of damage claims made against the Operating\nCompanies in a timely and fair manner through denials, negotiations, and payments. Such claims\ninclude allegations of damaged appliances due to voltage fluctuation, food loss due to power outages,\nand damage caused by Company vehicles (e.g., mailboxes, fence posts, and automobiles). This is an\nimportant process that ensures that only warranted and justifiable claims are paid. The CUSTEGOP\nbilling method is appropriate because the Public and Auto Liability employees provide\nknowledgeable, centralized, and consistent resolution of damage claims. The actual payments\nassociated with ETI public damage claims are charged to ETI through the use of other project codes.\nOnly the Public and Auto Liability employees' time and overheads are allocated pursuant to\nCUSTEGOP, which is reasonable and appropriate because the overall time spent by Public and Auto\nLiability employees in processing claims is driven by the number of gas and electric customers in\neach Operating Company. 832\n\n\n\n\n831\n      ETI Ex. 48 (Corkran Rebuttal) at 13-15.\n832   Id.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE246\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n            The explanations that ETI provides for the charges captured by these project codes and the\nmethod of allocation employed makes sense to the AUs. In a large organization, it is necessary to\nhave a group of people to process claims efficiently so that economies of scale can be realized; that is\nwhat ETI is doing with these project codes. These costs benefit all companies within the Entergy\numbrella (or within the regulated entities portion as noted), so the allocation methodology employed\nis appropriate. The ALls recommend the Commission reject OPC's challenge to the recovery of\nthese costs.\n\n\nR.          Tax Services Class\n\n            Dr. Szerszen proposed a 25 percent ($221,007) disallowance of costs billed to ETI from a\nsingle project code in this Tax Services Class: Project Code F3PCF10445 (Entergy Consolidated Tax\nServices). The costs in this project were incurred in the preparation, research, and other costs\nassociated with Entergy's consolidated tax return. Dr. Szerszen testified that an assets-based\nallocator is not appropriate for these costs and that the costs in the project should instead be directly\nbilled to each affiliate based on the time spent on preparing that affiliate' s income and expense\ndata. 833\n\n\n            Company witness Galbraith, who sponsors ETI' s Tax Services Class, stated that Dr. Szerszen\napparently believes that all costs associated with the preparation of Entergy' s consolidated tax return\nare captured by this project code and are allocated, when they should be direct-billed. Most of the\ncosts associated with preparation of Entergy' s consolidated tax return, according to Ms. Galbraith,\nare assigned to other project codes and are direct billed. Ms. Galbraith then explained that:\n(1) 56 percent of the time that Tax Services spent on the Entergy consolidated tax return were direct\nbilled through other project codes to the affiliates; (2) the project code also captures costs for tax\nresearch (both federal and state and local), monthly closing activities not specific to one legal entity,\ntax training that is not jurisdiction specific, compliance with file retention policy, and administration\nstaff time; and (3) why the assets-based allocator is the best method for allocating these departmental\n\n\n\n833\n      OPC Ex.

According to Ms. Galbraith, the costs captured by this code are not susceptible to direct\nbilling. 834\n\n\n          The AlJs find that Dr. Szerszen did fail to consider that most of the costs of preparing\nEntergy's tax return are direct billed and that the costs covered by this project code are not\nsusceptible to such a billing, which is why they are allocated. The AlJs, therefore, recommend the\nCommission reject OPC' s challenge to ETI' s allocation of these costs.\n\n\nS.        Transmission Operations Class\n\n          Dr. Szerszen challenged three project codes that are primarily within the Transmission\nOperations Class: (1) F3PPTDHY19 (Dept. of Justice Investigations) for a disallowance of $765;\n(2) F3PPTREORG (Transmission Re-Organization) for a disallowance of $3,661; and\n(3) F3PPF30211 (ESI Transmission Bldg (Reclassification)) for a disallowance of $229,991. 835\n\n\n          Dr. Szerszen addressed Project F3PPTREORG (Transmission-Reorganization) and testified\nthat costs covered by this project were incurred in 2009 and 2010 and, therefore, are not recurring. 836\nMs. Tumminello responds that, while these particular costs do not recur every year, they are\nrepresentative of normal recurring utility operations and do recur as necessary and, as such, they\nshould not be disallowed. 837\n\n\n          Dr. Szerszen testified that Project F3PPF30211 (ESI Transmission Bldg.) captures interest\ncosts after the ESI transmission building was placed in service. She contends that the costs are\nreclassified pre-Test Year payments and post-Test Year interest costs that are not known and\nmeasureable. 838 Ms. Tumminello testified that Dr. Szerszen has misconstrued accounting entries.\n\n\n834\n      ETI Ex. 26 (Galbraith Direct) at 10-12.\n835\n    Project F3PPTDHY 19 (Dept. of Justice Investigations) was discussed in Section VIII.L.

It appears to the AU s that Dr. Szerszen did\nmisconstrue accounting entries in preparing her analysis of Project F3PPF3021 land that the charges\nin that project capture fees paid during the Test Year. Accordingly, the ALls recommend that OPC's\nproposed disallowance be denied.\n\n\nT.        Treasury Operations Class\n\n          Dr. Szerszen challenged three project codes that are primarily within the Treasury Operations\nClass: (1) F5PCZZI07P (Directors & Officers (EIM)) for a disallowance of $14,483;\n(2) F3PCF25300 (Daily Cash Mgt Activities) for a disallowance of $7,286; and (3) F3PCF26022\n(Financing & Short Term Funding) for a disallowance of $96,700.\n\n\n          With respect to Project F5PCZZ107P (Directors & Officers (EIM)), Dr. Szerszen testified\nthat the directors and officers liability insurance subject to this project code is primarily aimed at\nbenefiting shareholders, rather than ratepayers and, because ETI does not manage ESI' s operations, it\nshould not be responsible for indemnifying against shareholder lawsuits. 840\n\n\n          ETI witness McNeal stated that ESI provides essential administrative and operational\nservices to ETI on a daily basis. To do this, it must employ (and retain) qualified officers and\ndirectors.

These are not specific to any one company, but are applicable to all of the\ncompanies within the umbrella of the Entergy corporate family. There are Company-specific\nactivities that are charged directly to ETI under different project codes, and this constitutes the\nmajority of financing and cash management activities during the Test Year.                            For\nProject F3PCF25300, the costs are driven by cash management products and services delivered to all\nthe Entergy companies. Because the number of transactions executed on behalf of each Entergy\ncompany is directly related to the number of bank accounts by company irrespective of account size,\nbilling method BNKACCTA, which allocates costs based on the number of open bank accounts is,\naccording to ETI, the appropriate method to allocate the costs of these services. 843\n\n\n          With respect to Project F3PCF26022, ETI explains that the project code captures costs for\nmanaging Entergy companies' liability portfolios comprised of Entergy company securities, bank\nlines, and project financings. The work is performed for the benefit of all companies under the\nEntergy corporate umbrella, not just ETI and is not duplicative of services performed for ETI.

The services include analyzing and supporting general capital\nstructure policy, developing and analyzing general financial policies, investigating and evaluating\nfinancing options generally that might prove beneficial for any or all Entergy companies, including\nETI, and facilitating ongoing administration related to all Entergy Operating Company financings.\nAccordingly, ETI argues that it is appropriate to allocate a share of those costs to ETI. The costs of\nthis project are driven by the level of service needed to complete the project or activity. Allocator\nLVSVCAL allocates costs based upon the overall service level ofESI. This allocation is appropriate\nbecause ESI is providing the service and no one Operating Company alone benefits from the services\nprovided under this project code. 844\n\n\n         OPC appears to have taken too narrow a view with respect to these project codes. First, it\nappears that where services are performed solely for ETI, they are charged to ETI through specific\nproject codes. The project codes that OPC challenges are for company-wide services that are\npartially allocated to ETI. It is logical to assume that a certain level of services can be performed\nmore efficiently at a company-wide level and that Texas ratepayers will benefit by paying only the\nallocated portion of those costs, as is done in these cases. The allocators chosen by ETI appear to\nreasonably reflect the cost-causation. Therefore, the AUs recommend that OPC's challenge be\nrejected.\n\n\nU.       Utility and Executive Management Class\n\n         OPC challenges five project codes that are primarily within the Utility & Executive\nManagement Class: (1) F3PPCCSO 10 (Climate Consulting Services) for a disallowance of $19,821;\n(2) F3PCCPM001 (Corporate Performance Management) for a disallowance of $173,867;\n(3) F3PCC31255 (Operations-Office of the CEO) foradisallowanceof$372,919; (4) F3PPCA0001\n(Chief Administrative Officer) for a disallowance of $177,156; and (5) F3PPC00001 (Chief\nOperating Officer) for a disallowance of $74,485.\n\n\n\n\n844\n      ETI Ex. 61 (McNeal Rebuttal) at 2-3; Tr. at 547-548.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                          PAGE251\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          As to the first, Project F3PPCCS010 (Climate Counseling Services), Dr. Szerszen testified\nthat these costs are incurred for the development of company-wide environmental policies,\nprocedures, and programs; that expenses are improperly allocated to the subsidiaries based on each\ncompany's fossil operating capacity; and, as a result, the non-regulated affiliates are not allocated any\nenvironmental initiative expenses. She therefore recommended that 50 percent of this project's costs\nbe disallowed. 845\n\n\n          ETI witness Stokes addressed Dr. Szerszen' s challenge to this project. Ms. Stokes explained\nthat although nuclear-related environmental projects are being pursued, they are not being pursued\nusing the project code referenced by Dr. Szerszen in her challenge. The costs for non-regulated\naffiliates are charged to projects not included in ETI' s affiliate costs in this case. Non-regulated\naffiliates use project codes specific to their businesses to maintain a separation of costs between\nregulated and non-regulated Entergy subsidiaries. 846\n\n\n          For the remaining four project codes in this class, Dr. Szerszen stated that executive\nmanagement is primarily concerned with overall corporate functions rather than issues for any one\nspecific subsidiary, and there is no relationship between an assets-based allocator and executive\nmanagement. 847\n\n\n          ETI responds to these arguments by stating that the functions covered by these project codes\nrelate to the oversight of all system operations and the stewardship of corporate assets and that\nbecause ETI is part of a corporate group, the allocated charges associated with these services are\nrelevant to ETI as part of that group of companies. Furthermore, ETI argues, the asset-based\nallocator is appropriate because it reflects the cause of the costs incurred, in that, services provided\nrelate to the stewardship of all the corporation's assets. 848\n\n\n\n845\n      OPC Ex. 1 (Szerszen Direct) at 62.\n846\n      ETI Ex. 66 (Stokes Rebuttal) at 5.\n847\n      OPC Ex. l (Szerszen Direct) at 56, 60.\n848\n      ETI Ex. 4 (Domino Direct) at 18-38; ETI Ex. 69 (Tumminello Rebuttal) at 9-11.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE252\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n            A corporation cannot function without executives, who are charged with the responsibility of\noverseeing, among other things, the assets of the corporation. This is an important function that\nDr. Szerszen did not acknowledge in her testimony. The utility and executive management class\ncosts that she challenges are reasonable and necessary costs that are allocated to ETI based on a\nlogical allocator - the assets the executives manage.

JURISDICTIONAL COST ALLOCATION [Germane to Preliminary Order\n                                    Issue No. 13]\n\n            Jurisdictional cost allocation involves the proper method for allocating production costs\nbetween ETI' s Texas retail customers and its wholesale customers, which are subject to FERC\njurisdiction. During the Test Year, ETI provided electric service to retail customers and to three\nwholesale customers-including ETEC-under service agreements and rates approved by FERC.\nETEC is a partial requirements customer, and it will be ETI's only wholesale customer during the\nRate Year. ETI estimated its cost of serving wholesale customers in a jurisdictional separation study\nthat split ETI' s cost of service between retail and the wholesale jurisdictions. 849\n\n\n            To calculate the wholesale cost allocation factor, ETI proposed the use of 150 MW for the\nwholesale load. This results in a retail production demand allocation factor of 95.3838 percent. The\n150-MW load represents the contractual minimum amount of capacity for which ETEC is obligated\nto pay under its partial requirements agreement. No party contests this aspect of ETI' s proposed\nallocation of costs between retail and wholesale customers. 850\n\n\n            However, Cities contest the type of allocation methodology used to assign demand-related\n(fixed) production costs to each jurisdiction. In this proceeding, ETI used the A&E 4CP allocation\nmethod.

A&E4CP\n\n          Kroger witness Kevin C. Higgins explained the A&E 4CP method:\n\n\n          [T]he Average and Excess Demand method uses an average demand or total energy\n          allocator to allocate that portion of the utility's generating capacity that would be\n          needed if all customers used energy at a constant 100 percent load factor. The cost of\n          capacity above average demand is then allocated in proportion to each class's excess\n          demand, where excess demand is measured as the difference between each class's\n          individual peak demand and its average demand. In this manner, the incremental\n          amount of production plant that is required to meet loads that are above average\n          demand is assigned to the users who create the need for the additional capacity....\n          the A&E/4CP variant . . . uses 4 CP to measure excess demand, whereas the\n          conventional version uses class non-coincident peak ....852\n\n          ETI witness Myra L. Talkington also explained that the A&E 4CP method, noting that ETI' s\ncoincident peak demand is measured for the months of June through September. Ms. Talkington\nrecommends the A&E 4CP allocation because it \"reasonably reflects the mix of the Company's\ncustomers and their respective electrical load characteristics and the relative cost incurred to serve\nsuch loads.\" 853 She also believes this allocation methodology provides a reasonable balance between\nthe contribution to the system peak and energy requirements. 854\n\n\n          As noted above, ETI's use of A&E 4CP is a change from the 12CP methodology it used\nwhen it operated within two states. Ms. Talkington testified that 12CP was appropriate in the past\nbecause System Agreement costs were allocated between Entergy Operating Companies using 12CP.\nThe Texas retail portion of the production costs were then allocated between the retail classes using\n\n851\n      Cities Ex. 4 (Goins Direct) at 10.\n852\n      Kroger Ex. 2 (Higgins Cross Rebuttal) at 3 (footnotes deleted).\n853\n      ETI Ex. 23 (Talkington Direct) at 6; OPC Ex. 6 (Benedict Direct) at 17.\n854\n      ETI Ex. 23 (Talkington Direct) at 6.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                        PAGE254\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nthe A&E 4CP methodology (as ETI is doing in this case). However, according to Ms. Talkington,\nnow that ETI operates in only one state, no jurisdictional allocation among states is necessary;\ntherefore, only one allocation methodology, i.e., A&E 4CP, should be used to allocate production\ncosts between the retail classes and the wholesale jurisdiction. Ms. Talkington testified that the A&E\n4CP methodology factors in year-round demand through the average and excess function and also\n                                                                        855\nmatches the allocator used to allocate costs within the retail class.\n\n\n          Cities opposes the use of A&E 4CP and suggest a 12CP methodology is preferable.\nCommission Staff does not oppose ETI' s use of A&E 4CP. No other party takes a position on this\nissue.\n\n\nB.        12CP\n\n          Thel2CP methodology allocates production capacity costs in proportion to each class's\ndemands that occur on the date and time of ETI's system peak in each of the 12 months. 856 Cities\nbelieve it is more appropriate for ETI to allocate fixed production costs between the wholesale\ncustomers and Texas retail customers using 12CP. Cities witness Dennis W. Goins testified that the\n12CP approach is consistent with the cost-of-service approach FERC typically uses to allocate\ndemand-related production costs reflected in wholesale rate schedules, and it is consistent with the\nassignment of MSS-1 costs (as well as MSS-2 transmission costs) to ETI under the Entergy System\nAgreement. Dr. Goins reviewed ETI' s Rate Year purchased power capacity costs month by month.\nHe determined that ETI' s heavy reliance on capacity purchases to serve retail and wholesale load,\nand the relative stability of those projected monthly purchased power capacity costs, suggest that the\n12CP method should properly split ETI' s demand-related production costs between the Texas retail\nand wholesale jurisdictions.857\n\n\n\n\n855\n      ETI Ex. 67 (Talkington Rebuttal) at 6-7.\n856\n      TIEC Ex. 3 (Pollock Cross Rebuttal) at 26.\n857\n      Cities Ex. 4 (Goins Direct) at 10-12.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                 PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE255\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          Dr. Goins calculated Test Year 12CP allocation factors for the Texas retail and wholesale\njurisdictions, and provided them to Cities witness Karl Nalepa for inclusion in his jurisdictional\nseparation study. He determined the following: 858\n\n\n                         Jurisdiction          A&E4CP           12CP\n                      Texas Retail              95.3838%         94.6208%\n                      Wholesale                  4.6162%          5.7923%\n                      Total                         100%              100%\n\n\n          In making this calculation, Dr. Goins used a loss-adjusted 150 MW (ETEC's monthly\nbilling MW) as a proxy for the 12 monthly CPs. In his view, the 150 MW is indicative of ETI' s\ncapacity obligations to ETEC, and it reflects known and measurable changes compared to test-year\nwholesale CPs (which would include CPs for wholesale customers that ETI no longer serves). 859\n\n\n          Cities point out that ETI previously allocated production costs to the wholesale jurisdiction\non a 12CP basis. ETI first requested that the Commission change the 12CP method in Docket\nNo. 37744. 860 According to Cities, ETI's request to change the 12CP methodology in Docket\nNo. 37744 is significant because ETI's wholesale load consisted of Brazos Electric Cooperative, Inc.\n(Brazos) and ETEC. The Brazos contract assigned Brazos' share of ETI' s production costs based\nupon a 12CP allocator. Thus, contends Cities, all costs that would have been over-allocated to retail\ncustomers would have been pocketed by ETI (if the 12CP allocator had changed). Cities argue that\nETI's request to deviate from its approved 12CP allocator will result in retail customers subsidizing\nproduction costs.        Dr. Goins calculated that the 12CP allocation factor for ETI's wholesale\njurisdiction is approximately 5 .3 8 percent versus 4.62 percent under the A&E 4CP method. 861 Cities\nconclude that retail customers will subsidize the difference between the two allocators, which is\n\n\n858\n      Cities Ex. 4 (Goins Direct) at 12.\n859\n      Cities Ex. 4 (Goins Direct) at 10-12.\n860\n     The parties in that docket stipulated the majority of issues in the case, including issues relating to\njurisdictional allocation.\n861\n      Cities Ex. 4 (Goins Direct) at l 1-12.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                       PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE256\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n0.76 percent. Because the allocation is applied to all production costs, including purchased power\ncapacity costs, the 0.76 percent difference is significant, contend Cities.\n\n\n           According to ETI, Cities' arguments are based on a non-existent situation-the provision of\nservice to Brazos-and should be rejected. The AUs acknowledge that ETI is no longer serving\nBrazos. Dr. Goins noted such in his testimony. Rather, the basis for his recommendation was:\n(1) the 12CP approach is consistent with FERC's wholesale rate allocation; (2) the 12CP method is\nused to derive each Entergy Operating Company's load responsibility ratio and share of monthly\nMSS-1 and MSS-2 charges; and (3) ETI' s purchased power capacity costs do not vary significantly\nmonth to month. Although Ms. Talkington understood that the A&E 4CP methodology is the same\none used to allocate production costs between classes, TIEC witness Pollock noted that it is often not\nappropriate to use the same allocation method for both jurisdictional and class allocations. He noted\nthat, in jurisdictional separation, allocations are between retail and wholesale entities, with wholesale\nsubject to FERC regulation. 862 ETI did not fully explain why A&E 4CP is the best methodology for\nallocation production costs between the retail and wholesale jurisdictions.             Dr. Goins' and\nMr. Pollock's testimonies were ultimately more persuasive on this issue. Accordingly, the AUs\nrecommend the use of 12CP to allocate capacity-related production costs between the retail and\nwholesale jurisdictions.\n\n\n      X.

Renewable Energy Credit Rider [Germane to Preliminary Order Issue No. 19]\n\n          The Legislature has established a goal for the installation of an additional 5,000 MW of\ngenerating capacity from renewable energy technology. It also set out annual goals for electric\nutilities to meet on a cumulative basis in order to encourage the development of renewable energy\ngeneration in Texas: A utility may meet its annual goals by installing generation, by purchasing\ncapacity based on renewable energy technology, or by purchasing sufficient renewable energy credits\n(RECs). 863\n\n\n          1. ETl's Proposed Cost Recovery\n\n          Staff witness William B. Abbott explained that the Company currently recovers its REC costs\nthrough base rates. Each credit represents one megawatt-hour (MWh) of renewable energy that\nmeets certain criteria set forth in P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.l 73(e), and these credits can be traded among\nparticipants in the Texas market. ETI proposes to remove these costs from base rates and implement\na REC Rider to recover its projected REC costs. After the initial rider is established, the REC Rider\nwould be reset annually to recover projected REC costs for the upcoming year, adjusted by any past\nover- or under-recovery and any revenue-related expenses. 864 With the introduction of the REC\nRider, ETI would withdraw its current Renewable Portfolio Standard Calculation Opt-Out Credit\nRider, which provides a credit to offset the base rate REC costs for certain customers who are\nexempt from paying REC costs. These customers would instead be exempt from charges under the\nproposed REC Rider. 865\n\n\n          ETI suggests that a rider is necessary because the level of REC costs incurred from year to\nyear is not known, and the cots are unknowable and very volatile. ETI witness Heather G. LeBlanc\n\n\n\n\n863\n      PURA §39.904(a) and (b).\n864\n      See ETI Ex. 31 (LeBlanc Direct) at 26.\n865\n      Staff Ex. 7 (Abbott Direct) at 11-12.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                               PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                        PAGE258\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ntestified that certain customers can opt out, and a rider is the most efficient manner to administer\nsuch opt out. 866\n\n\n          Initially, ETI based its rates for the proposed rider on the Company's Test Year renewable\nenergy credit costs, which were incurred on a Texas retail basis for the 12 months ending June 30,\n2011. ETI requested $623,303 and, after applying the revenue-related expense factor of 1.01307,\nproposed a revenue requirement of $631,450. 867 In rebuttal testimony, Ms. LeBlanc stated that the\nCompany's proposal should be updated to reflect the most current data available. She stated that\n\"events\" since the Company's initial filing in November 2011 caused costs for the Company to\nincrease. 868 She calculated an updated amount of $1,145,043, which, when the revenue-related\nexpense factor is applied, results in an updated revenue requirement of $1,160,008. 869 She believes\nthat the updated amounts further support the Company's position that REC costs are volatile.\n\n\n          2. Opposition to ETl's Proposal\n\n          Cities, OPC, State Agencies, and Commission Staff oppose ETI' s proposed REC Rider.\n\n\n          State Agencies argue that ETI's proposed REC Rider should be rejected because it deviates\nfrom the Commission's ratemaking policies and is inconsistent with PURA State Agencies witness\nKit Pevoto testified that the proposed rider is not appropriate because: (1) the rider is piecemeal\nratemaking, which deviates from the Commission's traditional ratemaking policies and is\ninconsistent with PURA; (2) the reconciliation (true-up) process in the proposed tariff is not\nspecifically provided for by PURA or PUC rule, or required to implement the REC process; (3) the\nredetermination of rates in the proposed annual filings would be based on projected or estimated\ncosts, rather than historical test year costs; which is not in compliance with PURA or the\nCommission's rules; and (4) ETI has not justified the need to have a rate recovery for REC costs\n\n\n866\n      ETI Ex. 31 (LeBlanc Direct) at 25.\n867\n      Id. at 24.

Ms. Pevoto explained that the traditional test\nyear cost of service ratemaking process, including regulatory lag, helps to match costs and revenues\nand to provide incentives that balance the utility's and its customers' interests. The proposed REC\nrider deviates from the traditional PURA rate-setting because it allows the Company to reset its rates\nautomatically each year without going through a comprehensive rate proceeding. In her view, the\nrider would eliminate the regulatory lag incentive for ETI to prudently manage these costs because\nthe rider allows for annual cost recovery adjustments. Ms. Pevoto observed that various provisions\nin PURA authorize riders for collection of other expenses, but no such provision exists for recovery\nof REC expenses, even though the Legislature mandated that utilities be responsible for a certain\nlevel of REC MWs. And she noted that if ETI's REC expenses increase due to increases in total\n                                                                                                  870\nREC MW requirements, ETI can request to include those increased costs in a future rate case.\n\n\n          In reference to Ms. LeBlanc's rebuttal testimony that \"events\" caused ETI's REC costs to\nincrease, State Agencies contend that ETI may have paid more for RECs during the Test Year\nbecause it contacted suppliers only after the REC requirement was mandated. ETI acknowledged\nthat RECs were in the $1.10 to $1.25 range at the beginning of the year and then appreciated to over\n$2.00 and peaked out at $2.55 in the first quarter of 2012. Moreover, one of the largest REC\nsuppliers unexpectedly withdrew its offers in March of 2011, which also led to price increases.\nMarch 31 is the end of the compliance period, and the deadline may increase the volume of\npurchases, which can add to price increases. 871 State Agencies note that ETI did not participate in\nthe competitive REC market until February 2012 and bought its RECs near the peak price. State\nAgencies contend that only Test Year costs of $623,303 should be included in base rates.\n\n\n          Cities witness Karl Nalepa also opposed the REC Rider. He testified that the Commission\nshould not permit ETI to single out REC costs from base rates because it presented no evidence that\nthese costs should be treated differently than they are now. He added that RECs are not related to\nfuel so much as they are related to retail sales and plant output. In his opinion, the Test Year amount\n\n\n\n870\n      State Agencies Ex. 2 (Pevoto Direct) at 6, 8-1 l.\n871\n      State Agencies Ex. 12, RFI.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                             PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE260\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nfor REC of $633,985 should be included in base rates. 872 Cities witness James Z. Brazell also\ntestified that ETI currently recovers a large portion of its revenues through non-fuel piecemeal riders.\nWhile he believes some riders are necessary and appropriate, ETI' s general movement of cost\nrecovery from base rates to riders (as evidenced in this proceeding) is inconsistent with PURA and\nthe prohibition against piecemeal ratemaking. 873\n\n\n          OPC also opposed ETI' s proposed REC Rider on the basis that it constitutes piecemeal\nratemaking. OPC witness Nathan A. Benedict noted that in Project No. 35628, the Commission\nrejected alternative mechanisms for the recovery of REC costs but reserved the right to consider the\nissue at a later date. 874 He stressed that, when rejecting alternative recovery mechanisms for REC\ncosts, the Commission recognized that REC costs are variable, that the purchase of RECs is\nmandated by law, and that certain customers can opt out of the Renewable Portfolio Standard\nprogram. Thus, in Mr. Benedict's view, the Commission has already rejected the arguments\nadvanced by ETI here. He added that ETI did not indicate a negative and substantial impact as a\nresult of transmission customers opting out of the Renewable Portfolio Standard program, and ETI\nappears to be currently administering the program effectively without REC Rider. In short,\nMr. Benedict concluded that costs related to renewable energy credits should be recovered through\nbase rates, and ETI's current opt-out rider should continue as the vehicle for ETI to handle\ntransmission-level opt-outs. 875\n\n\n          Commission Staff also opposes ETI' s request, stating that it amounts to unauthorized\npiecemeal ratemaking that should be disallowed. In Staffs view, the existing opt-out rider should be\nmaintained but updated to reflect the test year data used to set the ETI' s base rates.

Mr. Abbott acknowledged that the Legislature has authorized the recovery of\ncertain specific costs outside of base rates, but no such authorization exists for the recovery of REC\ncosts. 876\n\n\n          In addition, Mr. Abbott criticized the proposed REC rider because in the future it would\nallow prospective recovery of estimated REC costs. He believed that such an arrangement would\neliminate any regulatory lag and thus eliminate any incentive for ETI to minimize the costs of\npurchasing the required RECs. 877 Mr. Abbott also pointed out that the proposed rider contains a\nsingle rate for all customer classes and includes a \"revenue related expense factor,\" which increases\nthe overall rider revenue requirement to, in part, account for projected uncollectable bills. 878 This\nwould shift the costs of uncollectable bills from customer classes with greater bad debt onto\ncustomer classes with lower bad debt. Further, Mr. Abbott stated, the proposed true-up portion of\nthe REC Rider would eliminate the need for a bad debt factor, as any actual under-collected amounts\nwould carry forward and could be recovered in future filings. Also, the single rate could result in\ncost-shifting between customer classes, as over- or under- recoveries resulting from billing\ndeterminant forecast error would vary by customer class. Finally, Mr. Abbott stated, the ETI's\nproposed billing determinants are based on a historical year. But if load grows over the long term,\n\n\n\n\n876\n   Staff Ex. 7 (Abbott Direct) at 12-13.

In the alternative, if the Commission approves the REC Rider requested\nby ETI, Mr. Abbott recommended the following changes from the Company's request:\n\n\n                   The REC Rider should be set every year to collect the previous year's actual REC\n                   costs (instead of projected REC costs), plus any over- or under- recovery from prior\n                   periods.\n\n                   The previous year's actual REC costs should be allocated to each customer class\n                   based upon each class's actual energy usage over the time period for which the RECs\n                   were acquired.\n\n                   Any over- or under- recovery balances should be tracked by each customer class, and\n                   thus a separate REC Rider rate should be calculated for each customer class based on\n                   that class's allocated REC costs adjusted by that class's over- or under- recovery\n                   balance.\n\n                   The REC Rider rates should be calculated using billing determinants based upon\n                   ETI's best forecast of each customer class's energy usage over the rider's Rate\n                   Year.880\n\n\n          3.

ETI disputes State Agencies' claims that ETI could have purchased RECs at a lower level at\nother points in the year, stating there is no evidence that the Company could have bought RECs at a\nlower level at other points in the year.\n\n\n          Finally, ETI takes issue with the parties' argument that there is no statutory recovery for REC\ncosts outside of base rates. ETI argues that there is no statutory authority requiring the Company to\nrefund costs to opt-out industrial customers. According to ETI, no explicit statutory authority is\nnecessary, and the parties have failed to establish that any harm would result from implementation of\nthe rider.\n\n\n          4. ALJs' Analysis\n\n          The AU s are persuaded by the testimonies of Staff and intervenor witnesses Pevoto, Nalepa,\nAbbot, Benedict, and Brazell that ETI's proposed REC rider should be rejected. The testimony\nsupports a finding that adoption of the rider results in piecemeal ratemaking. ETI' s argument that\ncosts are volatile and, therefore, should be isolated and recovered in a manner similar to an annual\nfuel factor filing was not supported by sufficient evidence. Additionally, the AUs agree that the\nproposed rider eliminates any incentive for ETI to minimize the costs of purchasing the required\nRECs. ETI proffered unconvincing argument and insufficient evidence that standard cost recovery\nwas insufficient for ETI to recover its total REC costs and a reasonable return.\n\n\n             The AU s further find that the Test Year expense of $623 ,303 should be used for setting rates\nin this case. 882 ETI failed to proffer sufficient evidence and argument to support any increase to its\n\n881\n      ETI Ex. 55 (LeBlanc Rebuttal) at 11.\n882\n   This is the amount referenced in Ms. LeBlanc' s testimony at ETI Ex. 31 at 24 and confirmed in State\nAgencies Ex. 9.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE264\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ninitial request through rebuttal testimony. As recommended by Staff witness Abbott, the Renewable\nPortfolio Standard Calculation Opt-Out Credit Rider should be maintained, with an adjustment to the\ncredit rates to reflect the Test Year data used to set ETI' s base rates.\n\n\nB.        Class Cost Allocation [Germane to Preliminary Order Issue No. 14]\n\n          A cost-of-service study is an analysis used to determine the responsibility for a utility's costs\nfor each customer class. Thus, it determines whether the revenues a class generates cover that class's\ncost-of-service. A class cost-of-service study separates the utility's total costs into portions incurred\non behalf of the various customer groups. Most of a utility's costs are incurred to jointly serve many\ncustomers.      For purposes of rate design and revenue allocation, customers are grouped into\nhomogeneous classes according to their usage patterns and service characteristics.\n\n\n          The parties generally agreed that ETI's cost-of-service study comported with accepted\nindustry practices, but some parties had issues with specific items discussed below.\n\n\n          1. Municipal Franchise Fees\n\n          Municipal Franchise Fees (MFF) are charges for a utility's use of municipal rights-of-way.\nThe charges are levied by municipalities based on the amount of electricity sold within the municipal\nboundaries. They are also referred to as street rental taxes. The MFF charged to ETI are based on\nordinances passed by the cities in which ETI makes retail sales. Different cities have enacted\ndifferent levels of MFF on in-city kWh sales, ranging from 0.0956¢ to as much as 0.2644¢ per\nkWh. 883 For the portion of fees ETI collects through base rates, ETI proposes to allocate among\ncustomer classes based on customer class revenues relative to total revenues. 884 Once MFF costs are\n\n\n\n\n883\n   TIEC Ex. 1 (Pollock Direct) at 52 and Ex.

ETI notes\nthat it is following Commission precedent, and it opposes the use of different allocation factors for\nthese FERC accounts: Account 408.152, Franchise Tax State; Account 408.154 Franchise Tax\nLocal; and Account 408.163, Street Rental.\n\n\n          OPC witness Benedict testified that MFF should be allocated on the basis of in-city kWh\nsales, without an adjustment for the MFF rate in the municipality in which a given kWh sale\noccurred.

He believes\nOPC' s and Staff's proposal fails to recognize the different MFF rates charged by cities. Because\ncities that have a preponderance of industrial sales generally charge lower MFF rates, this proposal\nwould require LIPS customers to pay 0.1965¢ per kWh, which is more than the weighted average\nMFF cost to the LIPS class of 0.1612¢ per kWh. Thus, Mr. Pollock argues that this would require\nLIPS customers to subsidize other customer classes and would not be consistent with cost causation.\nMr. Pollock thought his proposal to allocate MFF by city by class resulted in each customer class\npaying only the MFF expenses actually incurred. 892\n\n\n          The AUs find OPC's and Staffs proposed allocation methodology best comports with\nPURA§ 33.008 and Commission precedent. As noted by Mr. Benedict, PURA was amended after\nthe Commission's decision in Docket No. 16705, which allocated MFF on the basis of rate schedule\nrevenue. PURA§ 33.008 expressly calls for a kWh basis for allocation and this is confirmed in the\ncases litigated since Docket No. 16705, which were cited by Commission Staff. Accordingly, the\nAU recommend that MFF be allocated on the basis of in-city kWh sales, without an adjustment for\nthe MFF rate in the municipality in which a given kWh sale occurred.\n\n\n                      (b) MFF Collection\n\n          All parties except TIEC recommend that the Commission approve ETI' s proposed allocation\nof franchise fee rentals to all customers. Cities witness Mr. Brazell testified that franchise fees are in\nthe nature of a rental, not a tax, and like all rental charges ETI incurs, the expense should be spread\namong all customers. He stated that MFF charges have always been collected from all customers,\n\n\nNo. 33309, Order on Rehearing at FoF 150 (Mar. 4, 2008) (stating in connection with a proposed municipal\nfranchise fee expense rider that \"[h]aving different rates in each municipality in TCC's service territory is\ncontrary to the Commission's desire for uniform, simple rates\").\n892\n      TIEC Ex. 3 (Pollock Cross Rebuttal) at 8, 33-35.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                  PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE268\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nwhether or not they take service within the corporate limits, except for the limited incremental\nfranchise fees specifically addressed by PURA § 39.456. Mr. Brazell explained that electrical\nfacilities within ETI's system are physically interconnected and electrically synchronized. The\nfacilities located within a city's boundaries are not isolated physically or electrically from the\nfacilities outside the city limits. Rather, they are tied to one another and function as a single\nintegrated system, and ETI' s facilities inside each city benefit all customers in ETI' s service area,\nwhether or not those customers are within the city. Therefore, Mr. Brazell recommended that the\nCommission approve ETI's request to recover MFF in base rates from all customers. 893\n\n\n          Mr. Benedict holds the same opinion. He stated that the Commission's policy to collect MFF\nfrom all customers within a customer class is also consistent with the concept that MFF are system\ncosts that are rightly paid by all customers taking service from the system. He explained that MFF\nare paid by a utility to municipalities for use of the municipalities' rights-of-way. Because these\nrights-of-way are necessary to operate an integrated electric delivery system from which all\ncustomers benefit, regardless of geographic location, Mr. Benedict stated that MFF should be\ncollected uniformly from all customers within a given rate class. He stressed that the Commission\nagreed with this reasoning in Docket No. 16705, where the Commission concluded:\n\n\n          Current cost of services studies are not based on geographical differences. Classes\n          are not divided based on geography, and industrial sites are not self-sufficient islands.\n          The use of city streets and property enables [EGSI] to have an integrated utility\n          system from which all ratepayers benefit. 894\n\n          Mr. Pollock objected to the proposals by Mr. Brazell and Mr. Abbott. He stated that\nMr. Brazell' s recommendation to adopt ETI' s proposed MFF allocation should be rejected because\nthere is no evidence that outside city customers benefit from ETI' s use of city streets and rights-of-\nway or that the benefits are evenly distributed between inside and outside city customers. Further,\naccording to Mr. Pollock, the standard used in class cost-of-service studies is cost causation, not\n\n\n893\n      Cities Ex. 1 (Brazell Direct) at 28-32.\n894\n    OPC Ex. 6 (Benedict Direct) at Ex.

The AUs find persuasive the fact that MFF is compensation for the use of\nmunicipalities rights-of-way, which is used to operate an integrated electric delivery system from\nwhich all customers benefit.\n\n\n          2. Miscellaneous Gross Receipts Taxes\n\n          Miscellaneous gross receipts taxes (MGRT) are state taxes imposed on each utility\ncompany's taxable gross receipts derived from sales in an incorporated city or town having a\npopulation of more than 1,000. Like MFF, these taxes are levied only on sales within the cities. ETI\nproposes to allocate MGRT to all retail customer classes based on customer class revenues relative to\ntotal revenues. 896\n\n\n          TIEC objects to ETI's allocation of MGRT based on class revenues for the same reasons\nstated for ETI' s allocation of MFF. It argues that these costs should be allocated and charged to\ncustomers within the municipalities to which the MGRT applied.\n\n\n          The allocation of MGRT is similar to the allocation ofMFF and should be similarly applied.\nFor the reasons set out above and to ensure consistent treatment, the AU s do not recommend the\ndirect method of allocation suggested by TIEC. Rather, these costs should be allocated to the rate\nclasses according to ETI' s cost of service study.\n\n\n\n\n895\n      TIEC Ex. 3 (Pollock Cross Rebuttal) at 7, 32-33.\n896\n      ETI Ex. 3, Schedule P-13 at 10, line 34.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                  PAGE270\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          3. Capacity-Related Production Costs\n\n                     (a) Allocation Methodology\n\n          ETI proposes to allocate capacity-related production and transmission costs to the retail\nclasses on the basis of A&E 4CP. As noted by TIEC and Commission Staff, this allocation\nmethodology is consistent with the method ETI used in Docket No. 16705, its last contested rate\nproceeding:\n\n\n          Finding of Fact No. 221. The continued use of the A&E 4CP allocator is the most\n          reasonable methodology for allocating production and transmission plant among\n          classes. The A&E 4CP allocator sufficiently recognizes customer demand and\n          energy requirements and assigns cost responsibility to peak and off-peak users. It\n          best recognizes the contribution of both peak demand and the pattern of capacity use\n          through the year.\n\n          Finding of Fact No. 222. The A&E 4CP method is also preferable because it is\n          devoid of any double counting problem. 897\n\n          ETI witness Ms. Talkington explained that the A&E 4CP allocation is appropriate because it\nis a method that reasonably reflects the mix of the Company's customers, their respective electrical\nload characteristics, and the relative costs incurred to serve such loads. She testified that the\nA&E 4CP method provides a reasonable balance between the two primary costing concerns:\ncontribution to the system peak and energy requirements. While the contribution made to the system\npeak is inherently recognized with the use of the average four coincident peaks, energy is also\nrecognized by reflecting the average demands. 898\n\n\n          OPC witness Benedict proposed the use of the average and single coincident peak (A&P)\nmethod to allocated production (and transmission costs, which are discussed in the section below)\n\n\n897\n      Docket No. 16705, Second Order on Rehearing at 97, FoF 221 and 222 (Oct. 14, 1998).\n898\n    ETI Ex. 22 (Talkington Direct) at 5. As noted previously, A&E 4CP is developed by adding each rate\nclass's average demand for the test year (the \"average\" component representing the rate class's average energy\nconsumption), weighted by the ETI system load factor, to each rate class's amount of average coincident peak\ndemand for the months of June through September in excess of its average demand, weighted by one minus the\nETI system load factor.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE271\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\namong retail classes. As noted in the discussion concerning jurisdictional allocation, A&E 4CP is a\nvariant of the A&E allocator. Mr. Benedict believes that A&E 4CP fails to properly assign cost\nresponsibility to both peak and off-peak usage. 899 Instead, he found that the A&E 4CP allocator\nresults in the same factors reached by the 4CP method, which means that A&E 4CP assigns cost\nresponsibility only to peak demand and not to off-peak demand. He believes that the A&P\nmethodology is the proper plant allocator because it takes into account both peak usage and off-peak\nusage patterns. 900\n\n\n            Mr. Benedict's methodology and recommendation was disputed by Kroger witness Higgins.\nHe indicated that the A&E method does not converge to a CP result. Rather, the A&E method\naddresses a fundamentally important question in production cost allocation-once capacity needed to\nserve the average demand on the system is accounted for, how does the regulator fairly assign the\nresponsibility for the additional or excess capacity that is needed to meet the various capacity\nrequirements (placed on the system by each customer class). Mr. Higgins concluded that the A&E\nmethod makes an objective and reasonable allocation. However, he did not advocate changing ETI' s\nuse of A&E 4CP. 901\n\n\n            Mr. Higgins explained that:\n\n\n            [T]he Average and Excess demand method begins by allocating a portion of costs on\n            the basis of average demand-or energy. The remaining (or \"excess\") capacity needs\n            of the system are then allocated to classes based on peak usage--class NCP in the\n            case of the \"standard\" approach, 4 CP in the case of the A&E/4CP method. In\n            contrast, the A&P method proposed by Mr. Benedict, which is classified by the\n            NARUC Manual as a \"Judgmental Energy Weighting\" approach, incorporates a\n            subjective determination that includes the full value of average demand both in the\n            \"average\" component of the A&P calculation as well as in the peak component of\n            that calculation. 902\n\n\n899\n   Mr. Benedict performed a mathematical proof that he believed demonstrated that the A&E 4CP allocator is\nnearly identical to the 4CP allocator.

He believes that Mr. Benedict's\nsupport of the A&P method is based on an oversimplification of the planning process. He also noted\nthat A&E is recognized in the NARUC Electric Utility Cost Allocation Manual and has been\nrepeatedly used by the Commission. 903\n\n\n          The following calculations performed by Messrs.

A&E 4CP was approved for the Company in Docket\nNo. 16705, and the extensive testimonies (which included calculations and graphs) of\nMessrs. Higgins and Pollock indicate that, not only is the methodology frequently adopted by the\nCommission, it is also a standard and reasonable methodology. As noted by ETI, it reasonably\nreflects the mix of the Company's customers and their respective load characteristics and the relative\n\n903\n   TIEC Ex. 3 (Pollock Cross Rebuttal) at 12-14, citing the NARUC Electric Utility Cost Allocation Manual,\nJanuary 1992.\n904\n      OPC Ex. 6 (Benedict Direct) at 25; Kroger Ex. 2 (Higgins Cross Rebuttal) at 5.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                 PAGE273\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ncosts incurred to serve such loads. It recognizes the contribution of both peak demand and the\npattern of capacity use throughout the year. 905 It also recognizes that ETI, like all Texas utilities, is a\nsummer peaking utility. The AU s recommend that ETI' s allocation of capacity production costs be\nadopted.\n\n\n                      (b) Reserve Equalization Payments\n\n          A subset of the Company's requested capacity-related production costs relate to reserve\nequalization payments made by the Company pursuant to the Entergy System Agreement (Service\nSchedule MSS-1 ). The System Agreement, which is approved by the FERC, prescribes a method by\nwhich each Entergy Operating Company's share of Entergy system reserves are calculated. ETI, as\none of the Operating Companies, is responsible to provide the system with its allocated share of\nsystem reserves. Some Entergy Operating Companies own less than their share of system reserves\nand are considered \"short\" with respect to generation capability. Companies that own more than\ntheir share are considered \"long\" companies. Short companies make payments to long companies\npursuant to the terms of the System Agreement. Because ETI is a short company, it makes reserve\n                                                                      906\nequalization payments which are included in the cost of service.\n\n\n          ETI allocates MSS-1 payments using A&E 4CP. Mr. Benedict argues that this allocation\nmethod is not consistent with the way costs are incurred, as ETI does not make MSS-1 payments on\nthe basis of A&E 4CP. According to Mr. Benedict, ETI incurs costs by being short with respect to\nsystem reserves-the payment is simply the number of MW by which it is short, multiplied by a\n$/MW rate as determined by a contract formula. The degree to which ETI is short is determined by\ncomparing its generation capability to its allocated share of system reserves. Total system reserves\nare allocated to the other Operating Companies on the basis of the Responsibility Ratio. Thus, as\n\n\n\n\n905\n      See Docket No. 16705, Second Order on Rehearing at FoF 221 (Sept. 4, 1998).\n906\n      OPC Exhibit No. 6 (Benedict Direct) at 29-30.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE274\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ndetermined by the Responsibility Ratio, ETI's share of system reserves relative to its generating\ncapability is what causes ETI to make MSS-1 Reserve Equalization payments. 907\n\n\n            Mr. Benedict concluded that, because Reserve Equalization payments are incurred on the\nbasis of ETI' s Responsibility Ratio, which is a rolling 12CP allocator, the payments should be\nallocated to ETI' s rate classes on a similar basis. As a result, he recommended that Reserve\nEqualization payments be allocated on the basis of 12CP.908\n\n\n            According to OPC, Mr. Benedict's proposal for allocating MSS-1 payments has been\ncriticized because 12CP measures class demands at ETI's peak monthly demands whereas the\nResponsibility Ratio is measured at the Entergy system's peak monthly demands. OPC agrees that\n12CP uses peak hours that may differ from those used to compute the Responsibility Ratio, but\ncontends that the Company fails to mention that the A&E 4CP method it uses to allocate MSS-1\npayments is also subject to the same critique. When choosing between the 12CP allocator and the\nA&E 4CP allocator for the purpose of allocating reserve equalization payments, OPC believes 12CP\nis more desirable. ETI' s contributions to the Entergy system's peaks in all 12 months, not just the\nfour summer months, determine ETI' s share of Entergy system reserves. ETI' s share of system\nreserves, relative to its generation capability, is what causes reserve equalization payments to the\nother Entergy Operating Companies. Moving to a 12CP allocation for MSS-1 payments aligns cost\nallocation more closely with cost causation.\n\n\n            TIEC witness Pollock explained that the Entergy System Agreement is regulated by the\nFERC, which does not control the rate design policy applicable to Texas retail customers under\nCommission jurisdiction. He views the System Agreement as an accounting mechanism to equalize\nthe benefits and costs associated with interconnected operation and joint planning. In his opinion, it\nis not relevant to determining which production capacity allocation method best reflects cost\ncausation for Texas retail customer. According to Mr. Pollock, the MSS-1 payments are no different\nin concept from the costs associated with ETI' s high-voltage transmission lines, which are allocated\n\n901   Id.\n908\n      Id. at 31.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                         PAGE275\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\non an A&E 4CP basis. He further indicated that the 12CP method ignores the reality the ETI is a\npredominantly summer peaking utility. 909\n\n\n          The ALls do not find sufficient support to allocate the reserve equalization payments\ndifferently than other capacity-related production costs. For the same reasons noted in the section\nabove, the AlJ s find the weight of the evidence supports allocation using A&E 4CP. While 12CP is\na reasonable methodology for jurisdictional separation between retail and wholesale entities, the\nevidence does not support this methodology for allocation of reserve equalization payments.\n\n\n          4. Transmission Costs\n\n          As noted above, ETI also allocates transmission costs using the A&E 4CP methodology.\nAgain, TIEC and Staff cite to the Commission's decision in Docket No. 16705, which adopted the\nA&E 4CP approach for both production and transmission costs. OPC witness Benedict, however,\nproposes allocating transmission plant using A&E methodology that he proposed for the allocation\n                        910\nof production plant.\n\n          TIEC argues that methodologies similar to Mr. Benedict's proposal have been repeatedly\nrejected by the Commission, and the A&E 4CP methodology has been repeatedly approved. TIEC\nsuggests that Mr. Benedict offers no rationale for a different result for transmission costs. According\nto TIEC, the rationale that he offers for using the A&P method for production costs-the potential\ntrade-off between capital costs and fuel costs-is entirely absent with respect to transmission plant.\nMr. Benedict does not even assert that such trade-offs exist. Rather, the only basis he offers for\nusing the average and peak methodology is his assertion that the A&E 4CP allocator \"mathematically\nreduces to a 4CP allocator.\"911 TIEC points out that the Commission, by rule, has adopted the 4CP\nmethod for the allocation of transmission plant within ERCOT. 912\n\n\n\n909\n      TIEC Ex. 3 (Pollock Cross Rebuttal) at 27-29.\n910\n      OPC Ex. 6 (Benedict Direct) at 26-28.\n911\n      TIEC Initial Brief at 68, citing OPC Ex. 6 (Benedict Direct) at 27.\n912\n       P.U.C.

Moreover, he\ncompared the different allocation factors-specifically, ETl's proposed A&E 4CP, the A&E, and\nMr. Benedict's recommended A&P. His calculations indicated that A&E 4CP and the A&E produce\n                                                                                     914\nsimilar results, while A&P radically departs from ETI's proposed allocations.\n\n\n          The AUs do not find sufficient or persuasive evidence to change ETI's proposed\nmethodology for allocation of transmission costs. A&E 4CP is a well-accepted method for\nallocating such costs, which the Commission has repeatedly adopted. The AUs recommend the use\nof the A&E 4CP to allocate ETI' s transmission costs.\n\n\nC.        Revenue Allocation\n\n          Wal-Mart, Kroger, TIEC, and Commission Staff advocate that the rates be set on the basis of\nthe utility's costs of service. These parties recommends the adoption of ETis proposed base rate\nrevenue allocation, recovering from each class 100 percent of it respective Test-Year base rate costs\nper the revenue requirement ultimately adopted.\n\n\n          TIEC witness Pollock testified that revenue allocation is the process of determining how any\nbase revenue change approved by the Commission should be spread to each customer class served by\nthe utility. ETI proposed an overall increase in non-fuel revenues of 17 .53 percent, but the increase\nis not spread proportionally to all the classes.915 Rather, ETI proposed class revenue requirements\n\n\n\n\n\"coincident peak demand for the months of June, July, August, and September (4CP) .... \"\n913\n      ETI Ex. 67 (Talkington Rebuttal) at 8-9.\n914\n      Kroger Ex. 2 (Higgins Cross Rebuttal) at 5-6.\n915\n      ETI's revenue requirement does not include the costs associated with its requested REC Rider.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE277\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nthat are closely aligned with the Company's proposed cost of service.

Argument for Moving Rates to Cost\n\n          ETI and the parties in support of ETI' s class revenue allocation contend it is appropriate to\nset rates at each class' cost of service as ETI has proposed in order to avoid continuing inappropriate\nand inequitable cost shifting between customer classes. TIEC witness Mr. Pollock testified that\ncost-based rates send the proper price signals to customers. He noted other reasons for using cost-of-\nservice principles: equity, engineering efficiency (cost-minimization), stability, and conservation. If\nrates are not based on cost, then some customers subsidize part of the cost of providing service to\nother customers.

In this case, ETI' s proposed\nrevenues for all customer classes result in base revenues that are close to the cost of service allocated\ncosts. No single customer class' proposed revenue requirement differs from ETI' s calculated cost to\nserve that class by more than 3 percent. Staff acknowledges that certain classes face proportionally\nlarger rate increases to bring them closer to unity, where revenue recovery is based on actual cost of\nservice. However, Staff agrees with Mr. Pollock that setting each customer class at their cost of\nservice avoids inflating rates for some customer classes and subsidizing the usage of others. Staff\nbelieves that recovering from each class its respective base rate cost is equitable and provides\nappropriate pricing signals to facilitate the most efficient use of resources in the provision and\nconsumption of electricity. Staff also argues that the Commission has approved such class cost of\nservice allocation in recent rate cases. 920\n\n\n\n\n919\n      Id. at 67.\n920\n   Staff cites Application of CenterPoint Electric Delivery Company, UC for Authority to Change Rates,\nDocket No. 28339, Order at FoF 175 (May 12, 2011) and Docket No. 16705, Second Order on Rehearing at\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                            PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE280\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          Wal-Mart and Kroger concur with Staff and TIEC.\n\n\n          2. Argument for Gradualism\n\n          Cities witness Karl Nalepa pointed out that, under ETI' s proposed rates, the Residential and\nLighting customer classes receive the highest rate increases while the Small General Service, General\nService, and Large Industrial Power Service classes receive below system average rate increases of\n1.62 percent, 4.81 percent, and 10.77 percent, respectively. However, he examined Test Year\ncustomer quantities, energy and loads by customer class for each of ETI' s last three cases, and he\nconcluded that residential and lighting customers are not imposing an undue cost burden on the\nsystem. Instead, other classes are growing at a faster rate, causing system costs to increase.\nMoreover, Mr. Nalepa testified that a number of events are occurring with the Entergy system that\nwill have significant impact on costs, including: Entergy' s efforts to join MISO; plans by EAi and\nEMI to leave the Entergy System Agreement; and the possible divestiture of the transmission system\nby all Entergy Operating Companies. Given these uncertainties, Mr. Nalepa proposed that any rate\nincrease or decrease be spread proportionately across the system classes. Then, once Entergy and\nETI address the proposed system cost changes, a reasonable class cost allocation study can be\npresented. 921\n\n\n          State Agencies do not take a position on overall class revenue allocation but request that\nETI' s proposed rate increase for the Lighting class be moderated. ETI proposes to set base rate\nrevenues for the Lighting class based on the class cost allocation study, without any adjustment,\nwhich would result in a 20.38 percent increase to the Lighting class, when the entire ETI system\nwould receive a 15.32 percent increase. Thus, under ETI's proposal, this class would receive a\npercentage increase about 1.33 times the system average. Ms. Pevoto contended that that this\nincrease would be excessive and would create significant rate shock to the class. Because the\n\n\nFoF 245 (Sept. 4, 1998). TIEC witness Pollock also testified that Commission precedent supports allocation of\ncosts based on the cost of service study. He also cited to the CenterPoint case and to Application ofAEP Texas\nCentral for Authority to Change Rates, Docket No. 28840, Order at 50 (Aug. 15, 2005).

Pevoto believes it\nwould be reasonable to mitigate the rate shock so that lighting customers can afford to continue their\nlighting service. Otherwise, she suggested, some lighting customers may reduce lighting services or\nrefrain from ordering additional lights. This, in tum, would adversely affect the benefits that lighting\nservice provides to the public. 922\n\n\n          Ms. Pevoto also pointed out that in 2009, the Commission adopted a rate moderation\nproposal for a similar rate class served by another utility. In that case, the Commission recognized\nthat the Lighting class was unique in the combination of the public good it performs and in its\ndemand characteristics. 923 To mitigate the rate shock on the lighting customers in the present case,\nMs. Pevoto recommended a cap on any base rate increase that would be equal to the smaller of:\n(1) the lighting class percentage rate increase resulting from the PUC-approved cost of service\nallocation study, or (2) the allowed system percentage rate increase. If the percentage rate increase is\nsmaller than the allowed system percentage rate increase, then no mitigation adjustment would be\nnecessary. However, if the PUC-approved cost of service allocation results in a percentage base rate\nincrease for the lighting class that is greater than the allowed system percentage increase, then she\nurged that a mitigation reduction should occur. She also proposed that any mitigation reduction for\nthe lighting class should be spread to other remaining classes, based on each class' cost of service. 924\n\n\n          ETI argues that the State Agencies are proposing the continuation of a significant subsidy by\nother classes. The Company notes that its allocation of costs to the Lighting class is based on the\nrevenue requirement developed for that class. ETI acknowledges that its proposed increase for the\nLighting class is 20.38 percent greater than the system average increase, but it is less than the\nResidential class's proposed increase of21.64 percent.

She testified that previous rate cases\nwith subsidies for the Lighting class have pushed the class farther away from cost. 925\n\n\n          OPC argues that cost of service should not be the sole factor in setting rates and that\ngradualism should be used in appropriate circumstances. OPC witness Benedict disagreed with\nMr. Pollock's (and Staff's) citation to the CenterPoint andAEPTCC rate cases to reject the concept\nof gradualism because both CenterPoint and TCC are unbundled transmission and distribution\n(T&D) utilities whose charges had a small impact on retail customers' total bill. He noted that the\nnumber runs for TCC and CenterPoint showed retail revenue increases of only 0.14 percent and\n1.30 percent, respectively, with some classes receiving rate decreases. 926 Mr. Benedict cited the\nfollowing language by the Commission in its Order for the TCC case:\n\n\n          The Commission declines to adopt gradualism in this case. This proceeding develops\n          the T&D rates, as opposed to the broader rates developed for a fully integrated utility.\n          As the T&D rates are only a subset of the total rates paid by customers, changes to\n          the T&D rates would not have as large an impact as they would if the broader rates\n          for a customer class were changed by the same percentage.... 927\n\nIn Mr. Benedict's opinion, gradualism should be employed when setting rates for ETI because ETI is\nan integrated utility and has proposed a large rate increase. 928\n\n\n          Mr. Benedict also emphasized the imprecise nature of a cost of service study. He noted that\nETI's cost of service study had 47 allocation factors and, even at the summary level, 22 expense\ncategories and 24 rate base categories. 929 Thus, he stated, there are a host of decisions made by the\ncost of service analyst which, in combination with the various account entries, yield a class' reported\ncost of service.

Thus, while the cost of service study is\n                                                                                                        931\nan important element of ratemaking, Mr. Benedict stressed that it is not the only consideration.\n\n\n          Due to the wide variation of rate increases obtained from ETI' s cost of service study,\nMr. Benedict thought that rate moderation (gradualism) would be appropriate. However, he added,\nuntil decisions are made regarding the cost disallowances and allocation modifications proposed by\nthe parties, it is unclear which rate classes should be granted rate moderation and the degree to which\nrate moderation is needed. Mr. Benedict said that the system average rate increase should be used as\na benchmark for rate moderation, but not assigned uniformly to all classes as Mr. Nalepa proposed or\nto just one class as Ms. Pevoto suggested. Instead, he believed it would be reasonable to establish a\nfloor and a ceiling for the increases in revenue from each class, such that a class' individual\npercentage increase in revenue requirement is within a defined range of the system's average revenue\nincrease. Therefore, Mr. Benedict recommended that any rate increase for a particular class be\nrestricted to a range of 0.75 to 1.25 times the system's average increase. This would result in rate\nincreases up to 25 percent lower or 25 percent higher than the average rate increase for the system as\na whole. Based on a system average increase of 17.53 percent, individual class increases would\nrange from 13.15 percent to 21.91 percent under Mr. Benedict's proposal. 932\n\n\n          3. ALJs' Recommendation\n\n          The parties presented persuasive argument on both sides of the issue. Clearly, in any rate\ncase, movement toward unity-setting rates to cost-is appropriate when such movement does not\nresult in rate shock to a particular class or classes. If rate shock is likely, Commission precedent\n\n930\n    He noted, for example, that his direct testimony and Mr. Nalepa' s direct testimony proposed a different\nallocation methodology for production-related capacity costs, transmission costs, and certain System\nAgreement costs. Mr. Pollock proposed a different allocation method for municipal franchise fees and local\ngross receipts taxes. Mr. Abbott recommended different allocation methods for municipal franchise fees and\nother franchise taxes.\n931\n      OPC Ex. 8 (Benedict Cross Rebuttal) at 14-17.\n932\n      OPC Ex. 8 (Benedict Cross Rebuttal) at 17-19.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                              PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                   PAGE284\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nsupports the use of gradualism. These policies apply to both a fully integrated utility, as well as a\nT&D. The salient issue is whether the utility's proposed increase is so out of proportion or harsh to a\nparticular class that some form of gradualism should be applied. In this rate case, the preponderance\nof the evidence does not support the use of gradualism, even for the Lighting class. While that class\nmay receive an increase almost 1.33 times the system average increase, Commission precedent\nindicated an appropriate ceiling of 1.5 or even 1.75 times the system average is appropriate. 933 As to\napplying OPC's proposed floor and ceiling approach, this method was introduced in cross-rebuttal\nwith no calculations depicting the impact on each class. The A1J s do not recommend its adoption\nbecause it fails to offer significant movement towards class responsibility for cost of service. The\nA1J s do not recommend Mr. Nalepa' s suggestion to impose any revenue change on an equal percent\nbasis because it offers no movement towards unity. Accordingly, the A1J s concur with the parties\nsupporting ETI that revenue allocation in this case should be based on each class's cost of service\nand consistent with the AU s' recommendations in the PFD that impact revenue allocation.\n\n\nD.        Rate Design [Germane to Preliminary Order Issue Nos. 15, 18, and 20]\n\n          Staff explained that the Commission has traditionally established class costs of service based\non the principle of cost causation.         Staff believes the Commission has consistently required\nsubstantial justification for departing from this principle when setting rates that result in\ncross-subsidization between customer classes. With respect to intra-class cost causation and rate\ndesign, Staff maintains that the considerations are somewhat different. Rather, the Commission has\ntraditionally given more weight to policy considerations other than cost causation in determining\nintra-class rate design issues because the danger of permanent subsidies within a particular class is\nrelatively low. 934 For instance, Staff witness Abbott testified that customer usage within a class may\nvary throughout the year. He noted that a low-load-factor customer might become a high-load-factor\n\n\n\n\n933\n      See Docket No. 28840, Order at 23 (rejecting ALJs' proposed ceiling of 1.75 times the system average).\n934\n    Staff cites to Mr. Abbott's cross-examination at Tr. at 1818 (\"Q: And is there a distinction between factors\nthat you would consider such as costs or other factors when you're discussing class allocation as opposed to\nrate design issues? A: I would say there are different considerations and weights to considerations and the\nanalysis of allocating costs to classes versus the analysis of allocating costs to rates within a class.\").\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE285\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ncustomer, resulting in a different mix of charges throughout the year. 935 While an individual\ncustomer's usage characteristics might frequently change and thereby lessen the impact of cost\nshifting within a class, Mr. Abbott testified that such customers were unlikely to shift to a different\ncustomer class. 936 While subsidies in the customer class allocation context might be permanent, this\nwas not necessarily the case for intra-class rates. Moreover, these shifting usage characteristics make\nit more difficult to identify cost drivers within a rate class. Staff suggests that consideration be given\nto policies such as customer impact and energy efficiency.\n\n\n            The ALls agree with Stafrs analysis. Mr. Abbott recommended that the Commission apply\ngradualism-limiting the magnitude of rate changes-to help stabilize customer expectations and\nreduce risk. 937 ETI witness Talkington also advised caution in response to suggested changes to\nETI's proposed rate design, noting that the ultimate impact on a customer's bill is important. 938\nHowever, the ALJ s' rate design recommendations are based on the evidence and argument for each\ncustomer class or rate schedule. Thus, the ALJ s' recommendation on the specific rates or charges for\nthe industrial customers will impact all other customer classes but that impact is not known at this\ntime.\n\n\n            1. Lighting and Traffic Signal Schedules\n\n            Cities witness Dennis W. Goins explained ETI's Lighting and Traffic Signal Schedules.\nETI' s principal rate schedule for street lighting customers is Schedule SHL (Street and Highway\nLighting Service), while Schedule TSS (Traffic Signal Services) is the principal rate schedule for\nETI' s traffic lighting customers that own and maintain their lighting facilities. For Schedule SHL,\nthe rate includes four categories of service (Rate Groups A, C, D, and E). Rate Group A includes\nETI' s standard fixture and lamps mounted on existing standard wood poles that ETI installs and\nmaintains. If a customer wants nonstandard lighting facilities (those not provided in Rate Group A),\n\n\n935\n      Tr. at 1818.\n936   Id.\n937\n      Staff Ex. 7 (Abbott Direct) at 25-26.\n938\n      ETI Ex. 67 (Talkington Rebuttal) at 16.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE286\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nthe customer is assigned to Rate Group C and required to prepay ETI for the incremental cost of the\nnonstandard facilities. Lighting facilities that are customer-owned and customer-maintained are\nassigned to Rate Group D, while incidental lighting services (for example, underpass lighting) are\nassigned to Rate Group E. Customers in Rate Groups A and C pay a fixed monthly charge per\nlighting fixture, while customers in Rate Groups D and E pay a fixed (and identical) energy charge\nper kWh.           Each customer's monthly bill also includes charges for ETI's fixed fuel factor\n(Schedule FF) and applicable riders applied to monthly kWh per fixture. Under Schedule TSS,\ntraffic signal customers are subject to a minimum monthly charge ($3.20 proposed) per point of\ndelivery, plus a fixed kWh rate and all applicable rider charges. 939\n\n\n           Cities request that the Commission require ETI to institute a discounted lighting rate for\nLight Emitting Diode (LED) installations. Mr. Goins testified that the basic structure and pricing\nprovisions of the SHL and TSS rates were designed for lighting fixtures that use older, less\nenergy-efficient bulb technology, and ETI did not conduct any analyses to estimate the cost\ndifferential of serving street lighting and traffic signal customers that use energy-efficient LED\nfixtures. In fact, Dr. Goins noted that the basic structure and pricing provisions of the SHL and TSS\nrates have been place for years. 940\n\n\n           In Dr. Goins' opinion, adoption of LED lighting rates would help reduce energy consumption\nin Texas because such rates help offset the high front-end cost of LED lights and encourage\nmunicipalities to adopt energy-efficient LED options. In 2010, the Commission approved a street\nand traffic signal rate for El Paso Electric Company that included separate charges for LED traffic\nsignals. 941 In that case, the fixed monthly rate for LED signals was generally less than one-third the\ncomparable rate for incandescent signals.\n\n\n\n\n939\n      Cities Ex. 4 (Goins Direct) at 22-23.\n940\n      Id. at 23.\n941\n   Application of El Paso Electric Company to Change Rates, to Reconcile Fuel Costs, to Establish Formula-\nBased Fuel Factors, and to Establish an Energy Efficiency Cost Recovery Factor, Docket No. 37690 (July 30,\n2010).\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                              PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE287\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n            Dr. Goins recommended that the Commission require ETI to modify monthly fixed charges\nin Schedule SHL (Rate Groups A and C) and the monthly minimum charge in Schedule TSS to\nreflect a 25 percent discount for LED installations. Under his proposal, the discounted Rate Group A\nfixed charges (if applicable) in Schedule SHL would be applied according to the estimated monthly\nkWh consumption of the installed LED fixture. In addition, he recommended reducing by 25 percent\nthe Schedule SHL kWh charges applicable to LED customers assigned to Rate Groups D and E to\nreflect the lower cost of operating and maintaining LED fixtures. And he added that, in the future,\nETI should be required to provide detailed information regarding differences in the cost of serving\nLED and non-LED lighting customers. 942\n\n\n            Dr. Goins also requested that the Commission require ETI to eliminate the service condition\napplicable to Rate Groups A and C in Schedule SHL that charges a $50 fee for any replacement of a\nfunctioning light with a lower-wattage bulb. He stated that this fee actively discourages customers\nfrom adopting more energy-efficient lighting technologies (for example, LED devices), and was not\nsupported in ETI's filing.          In Dr. Goins' view, this barrier to conservation and efficiency\nimprovements should be eliminated. 943\n\n\n            Staff disagrees with Cities' request that ETI institute a discounted lighting rate for LED\ninstallations. Mr. Abbott testified that Cities did not provide empirical cost data to support this\nrequest. Without data on which to base an LED installation discount, he recommended that the\nCommission not require ETI to provide such a discount at this time. However, because of the\ngrowing use of LED installations and the potential cost savings to be realized from these\ninstallations, Mr. Abbott did recommend that the Commission require ETI to perform a cost study to\ndetermine appropriate cost-based rates for LED installations. This cost study could be used to\ndevelop LED lighting rates, which Mr. Abbott recommended ETI be required to submit as part of its\nnext base-rate case. 944\n\n\n\n942\n      Cities Ex. 4 (Goins Direct) 22-26.\n943   Id.\n944\n      Staff Ex. 7 (Abbott Direct) at 28.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE288\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          ETI is willing to perform a study to determine the feasibility of implementing LED lighting\nrates as part of its next base rate case filing. ETI witness Talkington explained that the Company\ndoes not currently offer ETI-owned LED lights but may do so in the future. She stated that if a\ncustomer wishes to use LED technology, it can install LE fixtures and receive service under\nSchedule SHL, Rate Groups D and E, or the existing Schedule TSS. 945\n\n\n          Ms. Talkington took issue with Dr. Goins' proposed 25 percent decrease in Schedule SHL\n(Rate Groups A and C) and Schedule TSS for an LED option because the 25 percent rate reduction\nwas not calculated. Thus, ETI prefers that it propose rates after a cost study. Ms. Talkington also\ndisagreed with Dr. Goins' proposal for a 25 percent decrease in the energy-only options under\nSchedule SHL, Rate Groups D and E or Schedule TSS for customer-owned lights. She believes that\na customer will have the benefit of more efficient LED lights by the reduction in energy\nconsumed. 946\n\n\n          The AUs find persuasive Dr. Goins' testimony that: (1) the cost of street and traffic lighting\nservices can be significant for many cities and towns; (2) government agencies face increasing\npressure to control budgets and energy-efficient lighting is a good option; (3) LED fixtures use\nsignificantly less energy than incandescent and most other light options, last longer, and may require\nless maintenance; and (4) LED lighting rates would encourage municipalities to adopt\nenergy-efficient LED options and help offset the high front-end cost of LED lights. 947 However, the\nAUs concur with ETI and Staff that ETI should be directed to perform a LED lighting cost study\nbefore extensive changes are made to its lighting rates. The AU s further recommend that ETI\nconduct this study before filing its next rate case and provide the results of any completed study to\nCities and interested parties as soon as practicable but no later than the filing of its next rate case, as\nrequested by Cities. Further, the AUs recommend that the study include detailed information\nregarding differences in the cost of serving LED and non-LED lighting customers, if ETI has LED\nlighting customers taking service at the time it conducts its study. Finally, the AUs note that ETI\n\n945\n      ETI Ex. 67 (Talkington Rebuttal) at 17.\n946\n      Id. at 17-18.\n947\n      Cities Ex. 4 (Goins Direct) at 24-25.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                   PAGE289\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ndid not dispute Dr. Goins' suggestion to eliminate the service condition for Rate Groups A and C in\nSchedule SHL that charges a $50 fee for any replacement of a functioning light with a lower-wattage\nbulb. As noted by Dr. Goins, this fee discourages customers from adopting more energy-efficient\nlighting (such as LED devises). The Al.Js concur and recommend that ETI modify the applicable\ntariffs to eliminate this fee for any replacement of a functioning light with a lower-wattage bulb.\n\n\n          2. Demand Ratchet\n\n          Staff witness Abbott testified that a demand ratchet is a provision in a utility's tariff that\nallows it to bill a customer based upon on the greater of either demand by that customer in the\ncurrent month, or some fixed percentage of the customer's demand occurring during previous\nmonths. The Commission approved a settlement in Docket No. 37744, ETI's last base rate case, in\nwhich, among other things, ETI agreed to eliminate all life-of-contract demand ratchets from its\ntariffs for new customers with the implementation of rates. ETI further agreed that, in its next rate\ncase, it would eliminate the life-of-contract ratchet for existing customers. 948 The Docket No. 37744\nstipulation stated:\n\n\n          Life-of-Contract Demand Ratchet. The Signatories agree that the life-of-contract\n          demand ratchet provision in Rate Schedules Large fudustrial Power Service [LIPS],\n          Large fudustrial Power Service-Time of Day [LIPS-TOD], General Service [GS],\n          General Service-Time of Day [GS-TOD], Large General Service [LGS ], and Large\n          General Service-Time of Day [LGS-TOD] shall be excluded from the rate schedules\n          in ETI's next rate case. The Signatories further stipulate that the foregoing rate\n          schedules will be revised so that the life-of-contract demand ratchet provision shall\n          not be applicable to new customers and, for existing customers, shall not exceed the\n          level in effect on August 15, 2010. 949\n\n          ETI then filed compliance tariffs in Docket No. 37744, which implemented the first part of\nthe settlement by excluding new customers from its proposed life-of-contract demand ratchet.

ETI maintains the new language is not a\nlife-of-contract ratchet. Commission Staff, TIEC, and DOE disagree. Stated simply, Department of\nEnergy (DOE) witness Dwight D. Etheridge testified that the introduction of the term \"kW specified\nin the currently effective contract\" transforms what was a 12-month ratchet into a life-of-contract\nratchet. 952\n\n\n          At the outset, the AUs note that some of ETI's proposed tariffs do comply with the\nstipulation in the prior case. ETI eliminated the life-of-contract provisions for the GS and GS-ToD\ncustomer classes. However, ETI' s new language for the remaining ratchet classes, according to Staff\nwitness Mr. Abbott, has the effect of maintaining a slightly different type oflife-of-contract demand\nratchet. 953 The discussion in this section applies to the LIPS class but the same argument follows for\nLGS and GS classes.\n\n\n          The parties contesting ETI' s demand ratchet language argue that: ( 1) ETI' s compliance tariff\nin Docket No. 37744 was consistent with the parties' agreement; (2) ETI' s proposal imposes a life-\nof-contract demand ratchet; (3) the service agreement and tariff are linked; and (4) the new demand\nratchet is not equitable or cost-based. These arguments are set out below.\n\n\n\n951\n    ETI 67 (Talkington Direct) at Ex. MLT-R-4 at 15 (emphasis added). ETI changed the relevant language in\nits tariff in its rebuttal testimony. Thus, the testimony of Messrs. Etheridge and Abbott can be slightly\nconfusing because these witnesses address the tariff initially proposed by ETI.\n952\n      DOE Ex. l (Etheridge Direct) at 11.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE292\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n               >     The agreed tariff from Docket No. 37744 was consistent with the parties'\n                     agreement and shows how UPS billing load should be calculated.\n\n          Staff, TIEC, and DOE agree that when ETI filed the compliance tariff in Docket No. 37744,\nthe only demand ratchet that remained in the LIPS tariff for ETI' s new customers was a 12-month\ndemand ratchet. ETI removed the life-of-contract ratchet that set a perpetual obligation for a\ncustomer to pay for power based on its highest contract power or a percentage of its contract power.\nStaff, DOE, and TIEC argue that ETI' s action in removing those provisions was consistent with the\nagreement and is evidence of what ETI should have done in this case. They contend that ETI witness\nMs. Talkington agreed that the settlement eliminated both the highest load established under the\ncurrently effective contract and the amount specified in the contract.954              in other words, the\ncompliance tariff tracked the agreement.\n\n\n          ETI does not directly respond to this argument: Ms. Talkington did not address this in her\nrebuttal testimony. However, ETI states that the AI.Js should \"not be distracted by ETI's initial error\nof unintentionally removing the contracted capacity provision as to new customers in its compliance\ntariffs in Docket No. 37744.\"955 Apparently, ETI believes that the tariffs it filed in compliance with\nthe Docket No. 37744 agreement were in error.\n\n\n               >     ETI proposes a demand ratchet in this case that is based on the contracted quantity\n                     stated in the tariff-required service agreement.\n\n          All parties agree that what ETI proposes in this docket is different from the Docket\nNo. 37744 tariff, as evidenced by Ms. Talkington:\n\n\n          Q:         So last time, when the company and the parties implemented the elimination\n                     of the life-of-contract ratchet, it eliminated the 60 percent ratchet applicable\n                     to both actual demand during the contract period or the contract - the amount\n                     specified in the contract.\n          A.

What we have in this case is that the life-of-contract power relates to\n                     the highest load established under the currently effective contract ... 956\n\n\n          According to ETI, its proposed language does not impose life-of-contract ratchet, as defined\nby Mr. Pollock in Docket No. 37744 or by Messrs. Etheridge and Abbot in this case.\n\n\n      Witness                                                  Definition\n      Pollock                 \"A life-of-contract ratchet is based on the highest demand ever imposed\n                              by a customer during the term of the contract.\" He further explained that\n                              ETI' s proposed Docket No. 37744 tariff had \"a life-of-contract ratchet\n                              [which] imposes a perpetual obligation to pay a minimum demand\n                              charge throughout the term of the contract.\"957\n      Etheridge               \"A life-of-contract ratchet is a ratchet where you're not looking solely at\n                              current loads but some other loads in some prior period, so it creates a\n                              perpetual obligation to pay.\"958\n      Abbott                  \"[A] life of contract demand ratchet, which is based upon the highest\n                              demand established in the time period.... is one type of life-of-contact\n                              demand ratchet\" 959\n\n\nETI argues that the above definitions all make reference to the demand actually imposed by the\noperations of the customer's physical plant. But the contracted quantity provision it proposes is a\nminimum kW amount contractually agreed between the two parties to the service agreement, which\nis a required contract between the customer and ETI. 960 ETI argues the provision is not set by actual\nevents during the term of the contract or in a prior period of the term of the contract, or in a monthly\nor 30-minute time period within the term of the contract; rather, it is set in the contract:\n\n956\n      Tr. at 1432-1433 (emphasis added).\n957\n      DOE Ex. 3 (Docket No. 37744 testimony excerpt) at 5-6.\n958\n      Tr. at 2004.\n959\n      Tr. at 1817.\n960\n   Mr. Etheridge testified that customers taking service under Schedule LIPS must sign a contract for service.\nTr. at 1991.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE294\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          That contracted quantity is set as, to use Mr. Etheridge's words, \"an estimate\" that\n          cannot be unilaterally changed by the Company; instead, a change to that kW amount\n          could only be made through negotiation between the two parties or through a\n          proceeding before the Commission. To use Mr. Pollock's definition, it is not a\n          demand \"imposed by the customer during the term of the contract.\" It is instead a\n          fixed, contractually agreed to amount that is set as a condition of service prior to the\n          contract term. 961\n\n          In sum, ETI argues the provision in question are not life-of-contract ratchets that lock the\ncustomer into the highest demand ever imposed by the customer's actual load during the term of the\ncontract. Rather, they are, at most, 12-month ratchets that set the billing demand over a 12-month\nperiod, but not the life of the contract, at 7 5 percent.\n\n\n          Staff suggests that the Commission does not, fortunately, have to determine what contract\nprovision may or may not constitute a life-of-contract demand ratchet. Rather, the Commission must\nensure that ETI fulfilled its obligations under the Docket No. 37744 settlement. Staff believes that\nthe parties to that settlement understood the meaning of the life-of-contract term, ETI followed\nthrough with compliance tariffs that evidenced its understanding, and now ETI should be required to\nstick with its agreement.\n\n\n               )- The service agreement and tariff are linked.\n\n          According to TIEC, ETI tries to make the argument that its proposal is justified because ETI\nand its large customers may sign an agreement for service that specifies a customer's contract power.\nThis does not justify ETI' s proposal because ETI' s form \"Agreement for Electric Service\" expressly\nstates that the agreement is subject to the terms of \"applicable rate schedules.\"962 Thus, maintains\nTIEC, the LIPS tariff billing load provisions impact a customer's contract power and can reasonably\nreduce a customer's billing load below its contract power if the customer has a reduction in load\nlasting longer than 12 months.\n\n\n\n\n961\n      ETI Initial Brief at 211 (footnotes omitted), citing Tr. at 1994, 2012.\n962\n      ETI Ex. 3, Schedule Q 8.8 at l 1.1.\n\f                                                                               ~~-~·-----------\n\n\n\n\nSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE295\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          ETI' s proposal should be rejected, argues TIEC, because it would allow the utility to\nindefinitely seek revenue from a customer that has nothing to do with the customer's actual usage or\nthe utility's costs. For example, if a plant took 150 MW of load in its heyday, under ETI' s proposal,\nthe plant would be obligated to pay demand charges based on 60 percent of its original contract\npower. This is because ETI' s standard agreement requires the utility's \"express approval\" to set a\nnew contract power and the utility therefore could choose not to negotiate (or negotiate in a timely\nmanner) a new contract power. 963 If LIPS billing load is tied to contract power, then its customers\nwould be completely at its mercy to negotiate a reasonable contract power based on the customer's\nactual usage for the time period. TIEC contends this is a ridiculous result and would render the\nparties' agreement to eliminate the life-of-contract ratchet meaningless.\n\n\n              >    ETI's new demand ratchet is not equitable or cost-based.\n\n          TIEC does not dispute that a 12-month ratchet is reasonable. However, Mr. Pollock, in\nDocket No. 37744, explained why a perpetual obligation to pay demand costs for load that the utility\ndoes not serve is objectionable:\n\n\n          While it is appropriate to require customers to pay for the facilities they use, a\n          perpetual obligation is both extreme and unnecessary. Typical demand ratchets reach\n          back twelve months. A life-of-contract ratchet can reach back decades. This is\n          particularly inappropriate when longstanding customers have permanently reduced\n          operations. A customer that has reduced operations is not purchasing the same level\n          of generation and transmission services as in the past, nor is ETI procuring the same\n          level of generation and transmission services for the customer. Further, because of\n          load growth on the ETI system, the capacity no longer being used by the customer\n          would be used by other customers. Thus, a life-of-contract ratchet does not properly\n          reflect cost-causation. 964\n\n              >    Witness Recommendations.\n\n          Staff witness Mr. Abbott recommended that ETI be required to eliminate from its LGS,\nLGS-ToD, LIPS, and LIP-ToD tariffs the language that results in a ratchet based upon the current\n\n\n963\n      ETI Ex. 3, Schedule Q 8.8 at 11.2.\n964\n      DOE Ex. 3.\n\fSOAR DOCKET N O . -                             PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE296\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\neffective contract-specific demand.                Also, if the Commission approves Mr. Abbott's\nrecommendation, he stated that the billing determinants used to calculate the rates for the affected\ncustomer classes will likely change. Therefore, ETI should be required to update the affected billing\ndeterminants and reflect the resulting change in its rates in the compliance filing of this docket.965\n\n\n          DOE witness Etheridge also recommends that same for the LIPS tariff. He specified\nlanguage that will exclude the life-of-contract ratchet language and retain the existing rolling\n12-month ratchet language in Schedule LIPS. 966 Specifically, he proposed the following:\n\n\n          VI.           DETERMINATION OF BILLING LOAD\n                        The kW of Billing Load will be the greatest of the following:\n\n          (A)           The Customer's maximum measured 30-minute demand during any\n                        30-minute interval of the current billing month, subject to §§ III, IV and V\n                        above; or\n          (B)           [60%] of Contract Power as defined in § VII; or\n          (C)           2,500 kW.\n\n          VII.          DETERMINATION OF CONTRACT POWER\n                        Unless Company gives Customer written notice to the contrary, Contract\n                        Power will be as defined below:\n\n                        Contract Power- the highest load established under § VI (A) above during the\n                        12 months ending with the current month. For the initial 12 months of\n                        Customer's service under the currently effective contract, the Contract Power\n                        shall be the kW specified in the currently effective contract unless exceeded\n                        in any month during the initial 12-month period.\n\n\n                 )ii-   AI.Js Recommendation.\n\n          The ALls find that ETI violated its agreement with the signatories in Docket No. 37744: the\ntariff language proposed by ETI is a life-of-contract demand ratchet. ETI failed to explain how the\ncompliance tariffs adopted in Docket No. 37744 were in error. ETI' s argument that its new language\nis not a life-of-contract demand ratchet was unpersuasive. To justify its modification, ETI relied\n\n\n965\n      Staff Ex. 7 (Abbott Direct) at 20.\n966\n      ETI can adopt similar language for its LGS, LGS-ToD, LIPS, and LIP-ToD tariffs.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                         PAGE297\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nonly on a portion of Mr. Pollock's Docket No. 37744 definition. Moreover, both Messrs. Abbott and\nEtheridge were unequivocal that ETI, contrary to its agreement in the previous rate case, is imposing\na life-of-contract or perpetual obligation to pay. Finally, the weight of the evidence supports a\nfinding that the demand ratchet ETI proposes in this case is not equitable or cost based. The ALls\nrecommend that ETI' s proposed LIPS tariff be amended to include the language proposed by\nMr. Etheridge. The ALls concur with Mr. Etheridge that, with such language, ETI has a financial\nincentive to negotiate the maximum possible contracted level of capacity, not the minimum, and the\nresult is consistent with the Docket No. 37744 agreement.\n\n\n          3. Large Industrial Power Service (LIPS)\n\n          TIEC witness Pollock explained that Schedule LIPS recovers base rates through a seasonally\nadjusted demand charge (per kW) and a two-step non-fuel energy charge (per kWh). The demand\ncharges are also adjusted (either up or down) to reflect the differences in costs by delivery voltage.\nETI' s existing LIPS schedule has no customer charge. In its initial filing, ETI removed all purchased\npower capacity costs from base rates and proposed recovering them through a PPR as a demand\ncharge. When it did so, the proposed demand charges were increased, but the proposed non-fuel\nenergy charges were substantially reduced. Following the Supplemental Preliminary Order, which\nremoved the PPR from further consideration, ETI proposed to roll these costs back into base rates.\nThe resulting rebundled demand and energy charges would increase by about the same percentage.967\n\n\n          Mr. Pollock testified that the proposed structure of Schedule LIPS does not track costs as\nderived in ETI's class cost-of-service study. Specifically, he complained: (1) there is no customer\ncharge, despite the fact that the customer costs allocated to the LIPS class would translate into a\nmonthly rate of over $6,000, and (2) the proposed non-fuel energy charges would recover a\nsignificant amount of demand related costs. According to Mr. Pollock, production/transmission\ndemand-related costs are $8.47 per kW, and distribution costs add another $0.99 per kW, for a total\nof $9.46 per kW. The proposed LIPS demand charges are $7.07 per kW for transmission delivery\nand an additional $1.82 for distribution service, for a total of $8.89 per kW. Thus, in Mr. Pollock's\n\n967\n      TIEC Ex. L (Pollock Direct) at 68-69.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                          PAGE298\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nopinion, the proposed demand charges (given ETI's requested rate increase) are too low. By\ncontrast, he noted, non-fuel energy costs are about 0.226¢ per kWh, while the proposed non-fuel\nenergy charges would average over 0.600¢. Thus, these charges are 2.5 times higher than the\nnon-fuel energy costs based on ETI's filing. 968\n\n\n                       (a) A New Customer Charge\n\n           TIEC urged that any increase in Schedule LIPS should be used to create a customer charge.\nMr. Pollock calculated that a cost-based customer charge should be about $6,050 per month, and he\nrecommended an initial customer charge of $6,000 per month. This would collect approximately\n$5.9 million ($6,000 x 984 bills). He added that any remaining increase not accounted for by the\ninitial customer charge should be collected in the demand charges. He also stated that the non-fuel\nenergy charges should not be changed unless the LIPS class is allocated less than a $5.9 million\nincrease. In that event, he recommended that the non-fuel energy charges should be decreased. This\nwould gradually correct the imbalance between the below-cost demand charges and above-cost\nenergy charges. Mr. Pollock further stated that the delivery voltage adjustment applicable to\ndistribution service should be retained so that the rate better reflects the cost. Should the LIPS class\nnot receive an increase or if base rates are decreased, Mr. Pollock recommended that the customer\ncharge should be reduced proportionally. Any remaining revenue surplus should be applied to\nreduce the non-fuel energy charges to cost and then to reduce the demand charges. 969\n\n\n           Staff witness Abbott also recommends the introduction of a customer charge, but a much\nsmaller one than that recommended by Mr. Pollock- $630. 970\n\n\n           DOE supports Staff's proposed $630 customer charge. DOE witness Etheridge testified that\nTIEC' s proposed $6,000 customer charge far exceeds a reasonable initial customer charge for\nSchedule LIPS. For example, the existing Commission-approved monthly customer charge for\n\n\n968\n      TIEC Ex. I (Pollock Direct) at 69-70.\n969\n      Id. at 70.\n970\n      Staff Ex. 7 (Abbott Direct) at 27.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE299\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nSchedule LGS is $425.05. Mr. Etheridge stated that the introduction of a $6,000 customer charge\nwill lead to large shifts in intra-class revenue responsibility from high load factor customers to low\nload factor customers because a customer charge does not vary with usage. He noted, as an example,\nthat TIEC's proposal would increase DOE's Big Hill annual costs by $72,000 or nearly 10 percent.\nMoreover, Mr. Etheridge pointed out that two parties are proposing to lower the Schedule LGS\ncustomer charge-approving either of these recommendations and TIEC' s would levy\nSchedule LIPS customers with a new customer charge that is over 23 times the level of the LGS\nclass. He believes such inconsistencies are inexplicable. Additionally, such disparity would present\n                                                                          971\na challenge to any customer migrating from the LGS to the LIPS class.\n\n\n          DOE witness Etheridge agreed that is appropriate to move toward cost-based rates, however,\nhe indicated that gradualism should be properly applied to move rates toward cost without undue\nimpact on low usage and low load factor customers in the LIPS class. If a new customer charge for\nthe LIPS class is to be imposed-it should be that recommended by Commission Staff. 972\n\n\n          The Al.J s are persuaded by Mr. Etheridge' s testimony that the adoption of a $6,000 customer\ncharge far exceeds ETI' s existing customer charge in the LGS Schedule and results in a significant\nand inappropriate impact to low load factor customers. Rather, Mr. Abbott's proposed customer\ncharge of $630 is an appropriate charge to this customer class, particularly as ETI' s current rates\napplicable to LIPS customers do not include any customer charge. 973\n\n\n                       (b)          Demand and Energy Charges\n\n          In an effort to move more towards cost-based rates, Mr. Abbott recommends a slight decrease\n                                                                                       974\nin the LIPS energy charges and an increase in the demand charges from current rates.         Mr. Pollock\ndoes not recommend an increase in energy charges. However, he recommends increasing demand\n\n\n971\n      DOE Ex. 2 (Etheridge Cross-Rebuttal) at 3-4.\n972\n      DOE Ex. 2 (Etheridge Cross-Rebuttal) at 5.\n973\n      TIEC Ex. 1 (Pollock Direct) at 70.\n974\n      Staff Ex. 7 (Abbott Direct) at 27.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                         PAGE300\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ncharges to cover any remaining revenue increase for the LIPS class that is not accounted for with the\ncustomer charge. He suggested that such a change will gradually correct the imbalance between the\nbelow-cost demand charges and above-cost energy charges. 975\n\n\n          DOE witness Etheridge expressed concerns with both proposals.              He stated that\nSchedule LIPS customers are, on average, substantially more energy intensive than customers taking\nservice under Schedule LIPS-TOD customers. He indicated that TIEC's proposed rate design (with\nthe $6,000 customer charge) would double the cost increase associated with base rates and the fuel\nfactor for LIPS-TOD customers compared with the average cost increase for the class as a whole.\nCustomers with lower load factors than Schedule LIPS-TOD customers would fare even worse. 976\n\n\n          Mr. Etheridge also was concerned about Staffs proposed charges, noting that Mr. Abbott\nfailed to explain how the slight decrease in the LIPS energy charge and the large increase in the\ndemand charge would affect customers with changes in the revenue requirement ultimately assigned\nto the class. Mr. Etheridge stated that even Staffs proposed changes will noticeably shift intra-class\ncost responsibility toward Schedule LIPS customers with relatively low load factors. To address his\nconcern that changes in the revenue requirement may have a significant impact even with Staffs\ngradual movement in rates, Mr. Etheridge recommended that Staffs proposal should set the limit on\nintra-class cost responsibility shifts. 977\n\n\n          The ALls find evidentiary support for and recommend the adoption of Mr. Abbott's proposed\nchanges to Schedule LIPS. There is sufficient evidence, based on Mr. Pollock's testimony, that\nMr. Abbott's suggested changes gradually move the rates towards cost without the risk of rate shock.\nTIEC' s demand and energy proposals result in unreasonable large shifts in intra-class revenue\nresponsibility. However, the ALls also agree with Mr. Etheridge that Staffs proposal may need to\nbe adjusted depending on the ultimate revenue requirement adopted.\n\n\n\n975\n      TIEC Ex. 1 (Pollock Direct) at 70.\n976\n      DOE Ex. 2 (Etheridge Cross-Rebuttal) at 5.\n977\n      DOE Ex. 2 (Etheridge Cross-Rebuttal) at 5.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE301\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          4. Schedulable Intermittent Pumping Service (SIPS)\n\n          DOE proposes that a new rider, Schedulable Intermittent Pumping Service (SIPS), be\nincluded in the LIPS tariff. This will allow DOE and other customers with intermittent pumping\nloads to avoid application of a demand ratchet to schedulable, temporary, increased demand during\noff-peak months when ETI's costs are lowest. DOE suggests that the proposed rider will allow the\nDOE to schedule important testing and oil exchanges, when possible, during off-peak months, is\nconsistent with existing riders, and does not adversely impact other customers.\n\n\n          DOE explained that its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (Reserve) Texas sites-Big Hill in\nJefferson County and Bryan Mound in Brazoria County-play an important role in ensuring the\nenergy security of the United States. With a crude oil inventory of about 726.5 million barrels in\n2010, the Reserve is the largest emergency supply of oil in the world. The Reserve was established\nby Congress as a result of the oil supply disruption in the early 1970s.978\n\n\n          DOE witness Etheridge testified that DOE takes service to its Big Hill site under\nSchedule LIPS at an annual cost of approximately $770,000. Mr. Etheridge explained that the\nReserve' s sites typically operate in standby mode, with routine cyclical tests of pumping equipment.\nThe largest of these tests is performed every other year. These cyclical equipment tests can be\ncoordinated with ETI so that they occur during low peak periods. 979\n\n\n          On rare occasions, the Reserve can also be tapped. In its nearly 35 years of operations, there\nhave been three Presidential-ordered drawdowns: January 1991, the beginning of Desert Storm;\nSeptember 2005, Hurricane Katrina; and July-August 2011, the International Energy Agency\ncoordinated release. The latter was the largest of the three drawdowns at 30.6 million barrels.\nAdditionally, the Reserve has provided support to the oil industry in localized emergency or\noperational situations involving a disruption in supply, such as ship channel closures and hurricanes.\n\n\n\n\n978\n      DOE Ex. I (Etheridge Direct) at 3.\n979\n      DOE Ex. I (Etheridge Direct) at 3-4\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                               PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE302\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nWhen oil is exchanged during these situations, the Reserve will operate pumps at higher levels than\nwould occur during normal standby operations. 980\n\n\n          Mr. Etheridge proposed a rider to Schedule LIPS where maximum demands during pre-\nscheduled, non-summer month operations of a limited duration are not subject to demand ratchets.\nFor this new rider, he proposed that the non-summer months be classified as October through May to\ngive customers and ETI more flexibility. (Under Schedule LIPS, non-summer months are November\nthrough April.) Key provisions of the proposed SIPS rider include:\n\n\n                      A requirement that customers schedule with ETI limited duration\n                      operations during non-summer months four weeks in advance.\n\n                      ETI must approve scheduled operations.\n\n                      Operations would not be allowed to exceed 10,000 kW in magnitude nor\n                      last for more than 80 hours per year.\n\n                      ETI could cancel operations at any time if a capacity constraint develops.\n                      If a customer failed to comply, the customer would incur costs associated\n                      with ETI' s ratchet.\n\n                      A customer in compliance would not be subject to ETI' s demand ratchets\n                      for loads established during those operations, but would pay the demand\n                      charge in the month in which the operations occur. 981\n\n          Mr. Etheridge gave an example of charges under Schedule LIPS versus charges if the rider\nwere adopted. In September 2010, Big Hill conducted a test and established a maximum measured\ndemand of 11,640 kW, well above the site's average maximum demand of approximately 3,000 kW.\nDOE paid demand charges on the 11,640 kW in September 2010. In October 2010, ETibilled DOE\nfor 75 percent of that level of demand or 8,730 kW based on the rolling 12-month ratchet. Its actual\ndemand was 2,520 kW. In terms of actual costs, DOE paid $683,000 for its September usage. Under\nthe 75 percent ratchet, DOE would pay $609,000 per month. Mr. Etheridge estimated that the\n\n\n980\n      DOE Ex. 1 (Etheridge Direct) at 3-4.\n981\n      DOE Ex. 1 (Etheridge Direct) at 18.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                              PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                          PAGE303\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ncharges amounted to $59/k:W per year, which could easily represent nearly one-half of the annual\ncarrying cost of a combustion turbine. Whereas, under the proposed rider, if DOE conducted the test\nin February as it intended to, it would have paid ETI for the 11,640 kW level of demand, but the\nusage would not be used in conjunction with ETI' s ratchets. Mr. Etheridge concluded ETI' s tariff is\nnot equitable. At the hearing, Mr. Etheridge estimated that the rider's impact on other customer\nclasses at approximately $500,000, where Schedule LIPS base rate revenues are approximately\n                982\n$110 million.\n\n\n          According to DOE, for 15 years, June 1996-June 2011, ETI, by contract, accommodated the\nReserve's intermittent load by allowing the DOE to, once annually, \"reset\" the demand level to be\nused by ETI when applying demand ratchets. The DOE was able to avoid significant demand\ncharges when typical demand was very low. After June 2011, ETI declined to apply the terms of the\nlong-time contract and allow the reset. DOE concedes that cost-based rates to reflect the Reserve' s\nunique operations should ultimately be addressed by contract and/or new tariffs.\n\n\n          DOE notes that the very purpose of some riders is to address specific customer\ncharacteristics. For instance, Standby and Maintenance Service is available only to those customers\nthat co-generate electricity; the Optional Rider to Schedule LIPS for Pipeline Pumping Service alters\nthe designation of on peak-hours only for customers with pipeline pumping stations. Other riders,\nclaims DOE, seek a win-win for all customers. For instance, the Rider to LIPS for Planned\nMaintenance rewards customers for scheduling routine maintenance and idling facilities during ETI' s\npeak summer months of June through September by waiving the demand ratchet. DOE argues that\nthe proposed SIPS rider mirrors Planned Maintenance by waiving the demand ratchet if customers\nare able to schedule intermittent loads outside of ETI's peak summer months. Moving toward\ncost-based rates is not discriminatory, claims DOE. Nor is rewarding customers who use their load\nscheduling flexibility for the benefit of all customers.\n\n\n          DOE's proposed SIPS rider is opposed by ETI, TIEC, and Staff.\n\n\n\n982\n      DOE Ex. I (Etheridge Direct) at 19-20; Tr. at 2034.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                    PAGE304\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          ETI witness Talkington testified that the actual Reserve load, as Mr. Etheridge described,\ndoes not appear to match the parameters of his proposed SIPS rider. As recently as July and August\n2011, the Reserve sites had significant load requirements in order to pump vast quantities of oil. She\nfurther testified that the Reserve loads are random in occurrence and are significant. ETI must at all\ntimes maintain generation resources to meet this significant and randomly occurring load. In\naddition, the Company has invested in transmission and other facilities to serve this customer even if\nthere is no or very little consumption. She believed it would not be appropriate or equitable to other\ncustomers to remove or forgive the 12-month ratchet provision after the Company made these\ninvestments to serve the Reserve and while the Company has maintained generation to meet its load.\nIf the 12-month ratchet were forgiven, then the costs incurred to serve DOE would have to be borne\nby other customers in the LIPS rate class. 983\n\n\n          TIEC witness Pollock complained that Mr. Ethridge failed to analyze the impact on other\nLIPS customers. Mr. Pollock contended the rider would discriminate against both Schedule LIPS\ncustomers (by redefining the summer billing period) and Schedule SMS customers (whose ability to\nschedule maintenance power could be subordinate to LIPS customer taking advantage of the new\nRider). 984\n\n\n          Staff is concerned that the rider's unusual eligibility requirements-that a customer must\nschedule load four weeks in advance, limit the high load occurrence to \"off-peak months\" (which is\nredefined in the rider), and limit the yearly hours of load-indicate it is tailored solely to meet the\nunique needs of the Reserve. According to Staff, DOE conceded that, although other customers with\nintermittent loads might take advantage of the proposed SIPS rider, Mr. Etheridge was not aware of\nany other actual customer that could do so. 985 Staff argues the rider appears to offer unreasonably\npreferential treatment to the DOE and should be rejected.\n\n\n\n983\n      ETI Ex. 67 (Talkington Rebuttal) at 41.\n984\n      TIEC Ex. 3 (Pollock Cross Rebuttal) at 9-10, 44-46.\n985\n    Tr. at 2008 (\"Q: Now, who else would take advantage of this SIPS rate schedule, other than DOE?

Although DOE indicates that any shift would have a small overall\nimpact on the LIPS class, Staff argues that the Commission should not endorse any discriminatory\nrate rider.\n\n\n        Although Staff and TIEC claim the proposed rider is discriminatory, other riders applicable to\nSchedule LIPS customers are available at different times of the year as well (Planned Maintenance is\navailable only during the months of June through September) and others are limited to\ncustomer-specific needs-such as PPS for pipeline customers. Mr. Etheridge testified that this rider\ncould apply to any customer-it is not restricted solely to the DOE. The ALJs do not find this rider\nto be unreasonably discriminatory. As to ETI' s concern on this issue, it was focused on whether the\nDOE' s load met the proposed rider's requirements. However, if a customer taking service under the\nrider is unable to schedule its maintenance and oil exchanges with ETI, then the usage would be\nunder the SIPS Schedule and the SIPS tariffed demand ratchet would apply. Moreover, Mr.\nEtheridge testified that the impact on other customer classes is limited. As to ETI' s cost recovery,\nthe LIPS rider customers will pay a demand charge to cover the costs they impose on the system in\nthe month SIPS service is taken. The ALJs agree with DOE that the SIPS rider is reasonable and\nshould be adopted.\n\n\n        5. Standby Maintenance Service (SMS)\n\n        TIEC witness Pollock explained that Schedule SMS applies to customers that use\nself-generation to supply a portion of their electricity requirements. These customers contract with ·\nETI for either standby and/or maintenance power service to replace capacity or energy normally\ngenerated by the customer's on-site generation. Standby (or backup) power is electric energy or\ncapacity supplied to replace energy or capacity that is unavailable due to an unscheduled or forced\noutage of the facility. Thus, backup power must be available at any time. Maintenance power is\nelectric energy or capacity supplied during a scheduled outage. Unlike backup power, maintenance\npower must be arranged with 24-hour notice and only during such times and at such locations that, in\n\n\ndon't know that there are others who could use it. This could apply just to DOE? A: It could.\").\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                         PAGE306\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nETl' s opinion, will not result in adversely affecting or jeopardizing firm service to other customers,\nprior commitments, or commitments to other utilities. In addition, the customer must make\narrangements and schedule maintenance power in writing in advance and confirmed in writing by\nETI. ETI can also limit requests for maintenance power and allocate and schedule available service,\nif requests are made from more than one customer. Thus, Mr. Pollock stated that maintenance power\nis of a lower quality of service than backup or standby power. He also indicated that, because the\nCompany can limit the amount of maintenance power, it is more likely that customers would prefer\n                                                                   986\nto schedule maintenance power during the non-summer months.\n\n\n          ETI witness Talkington explained that standby service includes both the readiness to serve\nand the actual delivery of power and energy delivered when a customer requires service due to a\nforced outage or a planned maintenance period. She indicated that many utilities offer a combination\nof pricing and terms for demand and energy service as well as a form of reservation charge dealing\nwith the readiness to serve. She further indicated that the actual rate design may differ, but standby\ntariffs usually contain provisions for back-up (forced outage) or maintenance (planned outage). She\nconcluded that ETI' s current rate schedule provides for these features, and ETI is not proposing to\nchange Schedule SMS in this proceeding.987\n\n\n          TIEC proposes to redesign SMS service to better reflect the cost characteristics of standby\nand maintenance power customers. Mr. Pollock provided his analysis to support TIEC's position.\nUnder the current Schedule SMS, customers pay a monthly demand (or billing load) charge of\n$1.12 per kW for backup power. The corresponding charges for maintenance power are $1.12 per\nkW for outages during the summer months (May through October) and $0.84 per kW for outages\nduring the non-summer months. Thus, the non-summer month charge is 75 percent of the summer\nmonth charge. Energy is priced under an array of time-differentiated charges, as shown in the table\nbelow: 988\n\n\n\n986\n      TIEC Ex. l (Pollock Direct) at 70-71.\n987\n      ETI Ex. 67 (Talkington Rebuttal) at 19-20.\n988\n      TIEC Ex. 1 (Pollock Direct) at 72-73.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                  PAGE307\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n                           Current Schedule SMS Non-Fuel Energy Charges\n                                             (¢per kWh)\n                               Delivery Voltage               On-Peak989      Off-Peak\n\n                       Distribution (less than 69KV)          3.386¢          0.514¢\n\n                       Transmission (69KV and !:!l'eater)     2.334¢          0.211¢\n\n\n          Mr. Pollock examined P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.242(k)(l) and concluded that, for Standby\nService, cost-based standby rates should recognize system-wide costing principles and must not be\ndiscriminatory. According to his analysis, the SMS demand charges should be $0.82 per kW for\ndelivery at transmission and $2.64 per kW for delivery at distribution. He also determined that cost-\nbased energy charges should be as follows: 990\n\n\n                         Cost-Based Schedule SMS Non-Fuel Energy Charges\n                                           (¢per kWh)\n                                 Delivery Voltage               On-Peak Off-Peak\n\n                          Distribution (less than 69KV)          0.955¢       0.639¢\n                        Transmission (69KV and !:!l'eater)       0.916¢       0.614¢\n\n\n          Mr. Pollock explained that, on average, 7 percent of Schedule SMS billing demand was\ncoincident with ETI's summer month system peaks. This compares to 74 percent for Schedule LIPS;\nthus, the ratio of the SMS to LIPS coincidence factors is 12 percent. By Mr. Pollock's calculations,\nthe resulting demand charge for transmission service would be $0.82 per kW ($7.07 x 12 percent),\nand the corresponding SMS distribution demand charge would be the sum of the transmission charge\nand the Schedule LIPS distribution demand charge, or $2.64 per kW ($0.82 + $1.82). 991\n\n\n\n\n989\n   On-peak hours are from 1:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m., Monday through Friday of each week, beginning on May\n15 and continuing through October 15.

That is, Mr. Pollock stated, the 4CP demands are a primary\ndriver of the costs of the power plants, PPAs, and transmission facilities.      As noted above,\nMr. Pollock contended and verified by analysis that a cost-based Schedule SMS demand charge\n                                                                                   992\nshould be only 12 percent of the corresponding demand charge for Schedule LIPS.\n\n\n          Mr. Pollock also stated that he proposed to differentiate the standby demand charge by\ndelivery voltage because it more directly recognizes the different costs to provide service at\ntransmission and distribution voltage. He added that this recommendation is consistent with the\ncurrent Schedule SMS energy charges. 993 However, Mr. Pollock did not apply the 12 percent\ncoincidence ratio to determine the distribution-related schedule SMS demand charge. He explained\nthat distribution facilities are electrically closer to customers, so a customer's peak demand\ndetermines how distribution facilities must be sized to ensure reliable service. He stated that ETI\nrecognized this driver by using maximum diversified demand to allocate distribution demand-related\ncosts. For this reason, Schedule SMS customers require the same amount of distribution capacity as\na similarly sized Schedule LIPS customer. Thus, according to Mr. Pollock, the Schedule SMS\ndistribution demand charge should be the same as the corresponding Schedule LIPS demand\ncharge. 994\n\n\n          Concerning energy charges, Mr. Pollock testified that the Schedule SMS energy charge\nshould reflect the composite Schedule LIPS energy charges, or 0.614¢ per kWh. In his view, a\nSchedule SMS customer should also pay additional demand charges during on-peak hours, because\nthis would recognize that an SMS customer that purchases more energy during on-peak hours would\nmore closely resemble a LIPS customer. For this reason, cost-based on-peak energy charge should\n\n992\n      Id. at 75-77.\n993\n      TIEC Ex. 1 (Pollock Direct) at 77.\n994\n      Id. at 77-78.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                    PAGE309\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nbe a composite of the Schedule LIPS energy charge and the remaining demand charges (not collected\nin the SMS demand charge). He calculated an additional on-peak energy charge of 0.303¢, which\nyields a total on-peak energy charge of 0.917¢. Under this structure, an SMS customer that\nexperiences an outage would pay approximately the same for electricity as a LIPS customer.995\n\n           In summary, Mr. Pollock contended that Schedule SMS should be reduced to more closely\nreflect the cost of providing standby service as follows: 996\n\n                                  Cost-Based Schedule SMS Charges\n                            Based on ETI' s Proposed Schedule LIPS Design\n                                            Distribution     Transmission\n                             Charge\n                                         (less than 69kV) (69kV and greater)\n                                      Billing Load Charge ($/kW)\n                            Standby            $2.64             $0.82\n                           Maintenance         $2.44             $0.62\n                                      Non-Fuel Enenzv Char e (¢/kWh)\n                           On-Peak        0.955¢            0.916¢\n                           Off-Peak       0.639¢            0.614¢\n\n           Using his recommended Schedule LIPS rate design, he proposed Schedule SMS charges\nshown in the table below: 997\n\n\n                                          TIEC Proposed SMS Charges\n                                                 Distribution       Transmission\n                                 Charge\n                                              (less than 69kV)   (69kV and greater)\n                        Customer Charge\n                                                        $6,000\n                         (Stand Alone)\n                                     Billing Load Charge ($/kW)\n                            Standby            $2.46            $0.79\n                          Maintenance          $2.27            $0.60\n                                      Non-Fuel Energy Charge (¢/kWh)\n                        On-Peak             0.881¢            0.846¢\n                        Off-Peak            0.575¢            0.552¢\n\n995\n      Id. at 77-78; Ex.

If the Schedule LIPS revenue requirement is reduced, the charges should be\ncorrespondingly reduced. Mr. Pollock also added a customer charge, but he stated that the customer\ncharge should not apply if a Schedule SMS customer also purchased supplementary power under\nanother applicable rate. 998\n\n\n            To determine maintenance power charges, Mr. Pollock maintained the same relationship; that\nis, the current maintenance power demand charge is 75 percent of the standby power demand charge.\nHe stated that the 75 percent should apply to the production/transmission component of the\nrecommended standby power demand charge because distribution costs are caused by maximum\ndemands occurring at any time, as previously discussed. This would result in a $0.20 and\n$0.19 per kW differential based on ETI's proposed and Mr. Pollock's recommended Schedule LIPS\ndesigns, respectively. 999\n\n\n            The AIJs note that Mr. Pollock's suggested changes to Schedule SMS are extensive. For\ninstance, he introduced a $6,000 customer charge and, for the monthly billing load (demand)\ncharges, he introduced separate rates for distribution and transmission customers. 1000\n\n\n            Ms. Talkington testified that Mr. Pollock erred in using load data for the period of 2007\nthrough 2011 to develop a coincidence factor that he then uses to develop a lower back-up and\nmaintenance demand charge for transmission-level customers, while significantly increasing the\ncharge for distribution-level customers. She also stated that Mr. Pollock's proposal fails to recognize\nthe \"readiness to serve\" aspect of standby service. ETI must be ready to serve the load represented\nby the largest generation unit taking standby service, plus account for the forced outage rates for all\nother existing customer-owned generators. 1001\n\n\n\n998\n       Id. at 79.\n999\n       TIEC Ex. 1 (Pollock Direct) at 80.\n1000\n       TIEC Ex. 1 (Pollock Direct) at 80.\n1001\n       ETI Ex. 67 (Talkington Rebuttal) at 20-21.\n\f                                                                                                                    ---   ;\n\n                                                                                                                          '\n\n\n\nSOAHDOCKETNO.-                              PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                    PAGE311\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          Ms. Talkington also stated Mr. Pollock failed to recognize that standby load does not lend\nitself to the typical rate design practices. She opined that the cost of providing SMS service is not\ndriven only by the degree to which standby customers contribute to peak demand, but also by the\nCompany's obligation to serve whenever called upon. This is the major reason Schedule SMS is not\nincluded in the development of allocation factors. 1002\n\n\n          Ms. Talkington admitted that she is not familiar with how ETI originally developed\nSchedule SMS, but stated that she knows that when a customer takes back-up or maintenance\nservice, costing is generally designed to mimic what the customer would have paid on standard rates,\nabsent the use of its own generator. She concluded that Mr. Pollock's analysis is over-simplified and\nincomplete. 1003\n\n\n          In rebuttal testimony, Ms. Talkington proposed a new rate design for SMS service, including\na new service, Non-Reserved Service, which is an optional service designed to supplement\nMaintenance Service. ETI's new SMS proposal increases ETis test year base rate revenues by\n53.27 percent, with an overall increase of $5.1 million. ETI did not include this rate increase in its\nnotice. 1004 Accordingly, the ALls determine that ETI's new SMS proposal is not an option to be\nconsidered in this case.\n\n\n          Commission Staff does not oppose ETI's request to retain its current Schedule SMS.\n\n\n          ETI did not demonstrate how its current rates are just and reasonable. Rather, ETI' s evidence\non the reasonableness of Schedule SMS is conclusory and insufficient in light of Mr. Pollock's\ntestimony that the rates are not cost-based. Moreover, although Ms. Talkington indicated her\nconcern with Mr. Pollock's analysis, she provided no quantitative support for her concern. The\nAUs, however, are concerned that Mr. Pollock's suggested changes are not accompanied by a rate\n\n1002\n       ETI Ex. 67 (Talkington Rebuttal) at 21.\n1003\n       ETI Ex. 67 (Talkington Rebuttal) at 21-22.\n1004\n    PURA§ 36.102 and P.U.C.

And, as noted above, his suggested changes are extensive.         Mr. Pollock's\nrecommendations included a significant increase in the charge for distribution-level customers.\nConsistent with his Schedule LIPS recommendation, Mr. Pollock also included a $6,000 customer\ncharge when no previous customer charge existed. Again, there is no analysis as to the effect such a\ncharge would have on customer bills. The testimony of witnesses Benedict, Abbott, Higgins, and\nPevoto caution that gradualism should be considered in rate design. As noted by Mr. Higgins, \"full\nmovement to cost-based rates in a single step is sometimes opposed on the grounds of intra-class rate\nimpacts.\" 1005 However, the rate impact at this time is not known.\n\n\n          Based on the evidence and discussion above, the AUs recommend adoption of Mr. Pollock's\nsuggested changes to Schedule SMS , with the exception of a $6,000 customer charge. Consistent\nwith the ALls' recommendation that a new LIPS charge of $630 is reasonable, the SMS charge\nshould be limited to $630 and, as suggested by Mr. Pollock, not apply if a Schedule SMS customer\nalso purchased supplementary power under another applicable rate.\n\n\n          6. Additional Facilities Charge (AFC)\n\n          Mr. Pollock testified that Schedule AFC is the mechanism for charging customers directly for\nthe costs of transformers, breakers and lines when those facilities provide service only to specific\ncustomers. Some of these facilities are booked to transmission accounts while others are booked to\ndistribution accounts. Schedule AFC is applied as a percentage of the original (un-depreciated) cost\nof the facilities. 1006\n\n\n          TIEC contends that the Schedule AFC charges should be revised. According to Mr. Pollock,\nthe current charges exceed ETI' s ownership and O&M costs; therefore, he recommended th<\"\\t the\nmonthly charges in Schedule AFC be reduced. Under this rate schedule, there are two separate\npricing options. Option A charges 1.49 percent per month; Option B applies when a customer elects\nto amortize the direct assigned facilities over a shorter term, ranging from one to ten years. Thus, the\n\n\n1005\n       Kroger Ex. l (Higgins Direct) at 10.\n1006\n       TIEC Ex. 1 (Pollock Direct) at 8 L\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE313\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nOption B Monthly Recovery Tenn charge varies depending on the length of the amortization period\nof the directly assigned investment. A 0.453 percent Monthly Post-Recovery term charge also\napplies after a facility has been fully depreciated. ETI did not propose to change either the Option A\nor Option B charges in Schedule AFC. 1007\n\n\n           According to Mr. Pollock's analysis, charges imposed under Option A should be 1.20 percent\nper month under ETI's proposed revenue requirements. Under Option B, Mr. Pollock proposes\nvarious changes to the Recovery Tenn charges, and reduces the Monthly Post-Recovery term to\n0 .3 5 percent per month. Further, if the Commission approves a lower base revenue requirement than\nETI has proposed, Mr. Pollock stated that the recommended Schedule AFC charges (both Option A\nand Option B) should be reduced in proportion to any authorized reduction in ETI' s proposed rate of\nreturn, O&M expense, and property tax expense. 1008\n\n\n           In reaching this recommendation, Mr. Pollock used two different methods to derive a cost-\nbased rate: a levelized cost analysis and a revenue requirement analysis. The former resulted in an\nOption A rate of 1.20 percent per month, and the revenue requirement analysis resulted in a weighted\naverage rate of 1.18 percent. For Option B charges, Mr. Pollock also used a levelized cost analysis\nfor each of the Option B amortization periods, which resulted in lower charges. 1009\n\n\n           ETI witness Talkington disagrees with Mr. Pollock's description of Schedule AFC. She\ntestified that the rate schedule encompasses the costs associated with the installation of facilities\nother than those normally furnished. Or, under one option, the rates are like a monthly rental charge\npaid for facilities that would not normally be supplied by the Company. She also stated that\nMr. Pollock's example of facilities (transformers, breakers and lines) is understated. 1010\n\n\n\n\n1007\n       Id. at 82-85.\n1008\n       TIEC Ex. l (Pollock Direct) at 81-85 and at Exs.

The\nCommission approved this rate structure (and rate) in Docket No. 16705. Moreover, ETI witness\nTalkington testified that this rate is voluntary-a customer has alternatives beyond those offered by\nETI. Therefore, it is actually a market-driven rate. If a customer does not want to use this schedule\nto obtain the services it provides, the customer can secure services through other sources--either\nETl-owned or otherwise. Ms. Talkington further stated that Mr. Pollock's suggested changes would\nbe detrimental to the customers who do not have AFC rates because the AFC revenue is treated as an\noffset to the revenue requirement to the rate classes. 1011\n\n\n          Staff does not oppose ETI' s request to retain the AFC rate as it is currently designed.\n\n\n          The ALls find insufficient support in the record to retain ETI's Schedule AFC as-is. As\nnoted by TIEC, there is no evidence in this case to support ETI' s claim that: ( 1) the rate is a\nvoluntary rate; (2) there are other options in the market for customers; or (3) that the rate continues to\nbe based on a cost that the market will bear (as the Commission found years ago in Docket\nNo. 16705). 1012 While Ms. Talkington disagreed with Mr. Pollock's proposal because he did not\ntake into consideration the scope of facilities provided and that his proposal could be detrimental to\nother ratepayers because ETI' s revenues from this rate will decrease, she did not quantify her\nconcems. 1013 The evidence supports a change to Schedule AFC that will move the rate more towards\ncosts, and TIEC's proposals are the only ones for which there is evidence in the record. The ALls\nfurther agree with Mr. Pollock that his numbers should be reduced in proportion to any authorized\nreduction in ETI' s proposed rate of return, O&M expense, and property tax expense.\n\n\n          7.

The Company proposes no change in the customer charge of\n$425.05 per month. 1014\n\n\n           Mr. Higgins testified that ETI' s proposed LGS demand charge would recover only 72 percent\nof LGS demand-related costs. To compensate for the resultant revenue shortfall, the LGS energy\ncharges proposed by ETI would significantly over-recover energy-related costs. Specifically, the\noverall LGS energy charge is proposed to be 428 percent of base energy costs. In addition, although\nthe customer charge is proposed to be unchanged, it is set at 328 percent of cost. If, instead, the LGS\ncustomer charge were set at cost, it would only be $129.60 per month. 1015\n\n\n           Mr. Higgins illustrated his findings in the table below: 1016\n\n\n                           LG Total Class Functionalized Cost Recovery\n\n         Functions         Costs             Collected in     (Under)/Over         Percentage\n                                                Rates          Collection          Recovered\n         Demand         $46,266,083           $33,116,674      $(13,149, 409)            71.6%\n         Energ:v        $3,6625,811           $15,556,253        $11,920,442            427.9%\n         Customer          $561,445            $1,841,316         $1,279,871            328.0%\n         Total          $50,463,339           $50,514,243            $50,904\n\n\n           Mr. Higgins stated that if a utility proposes a demand charge that is below the cost, it is going\nto seek to recover its class revenue requirement by over-recovering its costs in another area, typically\nthrough an energy charge that is above unit energy costs. In his opinion, for LGS, when demand\ncharges are set below costs and energy charges are set above cost, customers with relatively higher\nload factors are required to subsidize the costs of lower load factor customers within the rate class.\nThe subsidy is different for each higher load factor customer (a customer whose load factor is greater\nthan the average for the rate schedule) and consists of the net increase in rates paid by these\n\n\n1014\n       Kroger Ex. l (Higgins Direct) at 7.\n1015\n       Id. at 8.\n1016\n       Kroger Ex. 5.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                        PAGE316\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ncustomers as a result of setting energy charges above energy costs and demand charges below\ndemand related costs. When the customer charge is set significantly above costs, smaller customers\nare overcharged and subsidize the larger customers. 1017\n\n\n          Recognizing that a full movement towards cost-based rates (without gradualism) in a single\nstep may create intra-class rate impacts, Mr. Higgins proposed the following changes to better align\ncosts: 1018\n\n\n                                         ETI                      Kroger\n                                       Proposed       %of        Proposed         %of\n                       Functions\n                                        Charge        Cost        Charge          Cost\n              Demand ($/kW)              $10.25       72%         $12.81          90%\n              Energy ($/kWh)           $0.01023       428%       $0.00513         216%\n              Customer ($/Mo)           $425.05       328%        $260.00         201%\n\n\n          Mr. Higgins developed his proposed rate impacts, which indicated a smaller rate impact on\nhigher load factor customers than those with low load factors.

Residential Service (RS)\n\n                ETI' s RS rate schedule is composed of two elements: a customer charge of $5 per month and\na consumption-based energy charge. The Energy charge is a fixed rate of 5.802¢ per kWh from May\nthrough October (Summer). In the months November through April (Winter), the rates are structured\nas a declining block, in which the price of each unit is reduced after a defined level of usage. For\ninstance, the same energy charge of 5.802¢ applies, but only for each of the first 1,000 kWh\nconsumed. Each kWh consumed beyond 1,000 is billed at a lower rate of 3.834¢. 1023\n\n\n\n\n1021\n          Staff Ex. 7 (Abbott Direct) at 25-27.\n1022      Id.\n     23\nt0   OPC Ex. 6 (Benedict Direct) at 41, Ex.

OPC witness Benedict noted that under ETI's proposed rate structure, once kWh usage\nexceeds 1,000 in a winter month, the per-kWh cost of consumption falls by 34 percent. Thus,\nbecause a declining block rate structure lowers the per-unit rate for high levels of consumption,\nheavy users are induced to consume more than they would otherwise. In his view, this runs contrary\nto the Legislature's goal of reducing both energy demand and energy consumption in Texas, as stated\nin PURA § 39.905:\n\n\n          (a) It is the goal of the legislature that: ... (2) all customers, in all customer classes,\n          will have a choice of and access to energy efficiency alternatives and other choices\n          from the market that allow each customer to reduce energy consumption, summer\n          and winter peak, or energy costs.\n\nTherefore, Mr. Benedict recommended that the declining block rate be phased out over time. He\nstated this would ease the transition to a rate structure without a declining block, and it would allow\ntime for customers to switch to more efficient heating systems. Mr. Benedict proposed that the\nphase-out take place over three rate cases, beginning with a one-third reduction in the block\ndifferential proposed by ETI in this case.

Staff witness Abbott stated that the extreme cold weather event of February 2011\ndemonstrated a need to incentivize wintertime energy efficiency measures, or at least a need to avoid\nencouraging excess energy usage. Therefore, Mr. Abbott agreed that some reduction in the rate\nblock differential is warranted to better encourage wintertime energy conservation at the margin. 1027\n\n\n          ETI witness Talkington testified that the RS rates are cost-based with a declining block rate\nin winter. According to Ms. Talkington, residential load factors in winter increase as energy usage\n\n\n1025\n       OPC Ex. 6 (Benedict Direct) at 43-45.\n1026\n       OPC Ex. 6 (Benedict Direct) at 46.\n1027\n       Staff Ex. 7 (Abbott Direct) at 27.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE320\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nincreases, and there is also a decrease in the fixed unit cost ($/kWh) as energy usage increases. She\nprovided analysis to support her position. 1028 Ms. Talkington explained that residential rates do not\ninclude demand charges because of the absence of residential demand meters. However, residential\nenergy rates can be structured the same as the non-residential classes; that is, customer charge,\ndemand charge and energy charge.· She developed residential rates on this basis to show that the\ndeclining block rate is appropriate to account for reductions in the cost of service to residential\ncustomers as consumption increases. With no declining block rate, high load factor customers are\ndisadvantaged as the customer charge is reduced and the demand charge is moved into the energy\ncharge. She believes that declining block rates alleviate the disadvantage. 1029\n\n\n           Ms. Talkington illustrated the impact of Mr. Benedict's suggestion to phase out the declining\nblock rate for RS customers. Approximately 54 percent ofETI's residential customers use more than\n1,000 kWh in January and February. For a customer using 3,000 kWh in a winter month of\nNovember-April, this customer's bill would increase by 16.28 percent or about $48 over current\nrates. (Of ETI' s total number of RS customers, approximately 10 percent use 3,000 kWh or more in\nthe months of January and February.) For that same customer, ETI's as-filed proposal shows an\nincrease of 11.96 percent or approximately $35. Mr. Benedict's proposal is $13 greater than ETI's\nproposal for one winter month at 3 ,000 kWh. That dollar amount is over a third of the total increase\nETI is proposing. 1030\n\n\n           After Mr. Benedict's proposed phase-out is completed, based on the proposed residential\nrates in the Company's case, the residential rate would be $0.06887 per kWh in both summer and\nwinter. A customer using 3,000 kWh in a winter month of November-April would see an increase of\n24.89 percent or about $7? over current rates. After the final phase out, Mr. Benedict's proposal is\n$38 per month greater than ETI's as-filed proposal of $35 for one winter month at 3,000 kWh. 1031\n\n\n\n1028\n       ETI Ex. 67 (Talkington Rebuttal) at 13, Ex.

Even though Mr. Benedict proposes to implement the change over the next\nthree rate cases, she concludes there will still be winners and losers within the residential class as a\nresult of his proposed change. According to Ms. Talkington, some customers have made decisions\nabout investing in electric appliances based on the current rate design. The elimination of the\ndeclining block in the winter time changes the economics of customer decisions that have already\nbeen made. She believes that great caution needs to be exhibited and very good reasons need to be\ndemonstrated before changes are made to the rate design. She recommended that if a change to the\nrate structure is recommended, the initial phase-in should be reduced to 10 percent rather than one-\nthird and subsequent reductions should be reviewed for consideration at the occurrence of each rate\ncase filing and not mandated at this time. 1032\n\n\n          The AUs concur with OPC and Staff that the structure of the declining block winter rates\nprovide a disincentive to energy efficiency. However, ETI provided evidence that OPC' s suggested\nchanges, combined with ETI' s proposed rate increase, will have too great an impact. OPC suggested\na one-third reduction in the differential, while Ms. Talkington suggested a 10 percent reduction, with\nsubsequent reductions reviewed before being mandated. The AU s recommend an initial 20 percent\nreduction, which should alleviate some of ETI's concerns but still reduce the block differential\nsufficiently to move towards compliance with the energy goals set out in PURA.

With the exception of three minor\nissues that are discussed below, none of the intervenors raised a substantive issue with respect to\nETI' s fuel reconciliation request.\n\n             During the Reconciliation Period, ETI' s Texas fuel factor revenues over-recovered total fuel\nand purchased power expense by $243,339,353, inclusive of interest. The Commission authorized\nthe refund of the fuel over-recovery balance in Docket Nos. 37580, 38403, and 38967. ETI proposes\nthat the amount of any fuel over-recovery balance not already refunded or authorized for refund be\nrolled forward as the beginning balance for the next reconciliation period. 1033\n\n             P.U.C.

Any choice within the select range of reasonable options is\n       prudent, and the Commission should not substitute its judgment for that of the utility\n       . . . . The reasonableness of an action or decision must be judged in light of the\n       circumstances, information, and available options existing at the time, without\n       benefit of hindsight. 1034\n\n       ESI purchases power and procures fossil fuels on behalf of the individual Operating\nCompanies. Fossil fuel costs are borne directly by the Operating Company that contracts for and\nuses the fuel. Once resources are procured to meet forecasted demand, the system is operated during\nthe current day using all of the resources available to the system to meet the total system demand.\nThroughout the course of the day, system operators may modify planned operations to maintain\nreliability, take advantage of less-expensive resources in the hourly wholesale power markets, or\nmake off-system sales. For example, when spot market power purchases are available at a cost lower\n\n\n\n\n1034\n   Application of Gulf States Utilities Company to Reconcile its Fuel Costs, Docket No. 15102, Order on\nRehearing at 2 (Jun. 24, 1997).\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                               PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE324\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nthan the cost of energy that can be generated by units owned by the Operating Companies, that\nenergy is purchased to displace owned generation, subject to operating constraints. 1035\n\n\n          Expenses for coal, gas, power purchases, and fuel oil are incurred directly by the respective\nOperating Company. For example, if coal is purchased for ETI' s share of Nelson Station, Unit 6,\nthen ETI is responsible for the invoiced cost and makes payment directly to the supplier. Wholesale\npower, purchased and sold for the system, however, is accounted for per the terms of the System\nAgreement. After dispatch, or after-the-fact, the System Agreement prescribes an accounting\nprotocol to bill the costs of operating the system to the individual Operating Companies. 1036\n\n\n          The following Fuel Reconciliation-related issues were uncontested:\n\n\n               ~   Natural Gas Purchases\n\n          ETI witness Karen Mcllvoy presented direct testimony describing ETI' s natural gas\nprocurement policies and strategies. She explained that the Company buys gas through a long-term\ncontract with Enbridge, through participation in the monthly and daily markets depending on fuel\nneeds, and on a delivered-to-plant basis or arrange for transportation to the plant. Ms. Mcllvoy\ndescribed how the gas buyers for ETI survey the markets and solicit offers for gas supplies.\nMs. Mcllvoy also provided a comparison of the Company's gas costs to the Inside FERC and Gas\nDaily published indices for the Houston Ship Channel. 1037 No party challenged the Company's\nnatural gas purchases.\n\n\n               ~   Fuel Oil\n\n          Ms. Mcllvoy testified that the Company purchased fuel oil for start-up and flame stabilization\nat certain units. Fuel oil can also be used for emergency back-up fuel or as an economic alternative\nto natural gas at certain units. During the Reconciliation Period, the Company purchased all fuel oil\n\n1035\n       ETI Ex. 40 (Thiry Direct) at 18-21.\n1036\n       ETI Ex. 39 (Cicio Direct) at 31-37.\n1037\n       ETI Ex. 28 (Mcllvoy Direct) at 23, Ex.

Cooper addressed the Entergy system's long-term planning process\nand described the Strategic Resource Plan process. He explained how the system determined its\ncapabilities and needs for additional resources to reliably serve system load requirements.\nMr. Cooper described the process by which the system developed requests for proposals and\nanalyzed a combination of capacity and firm energy contracts to satisfy the system's identified\nresource needs. 1039 A portion of these system purchases was allocated to ETI. No party proposed a\ndisallowance of these purchases on the basis of prudence.\n\n\n               ~   Short-Term Purchased Power\n\n          Ms. Thiry described the Power Marketing Team's procurement strategies, practices and\nprocedures during the Reconciliation Period. Ms. Thiry testified that the Power Marketing Team\nfulfilled its objective of purchasing energy in the wholesale market when it was more economical\nthan using the system's generatio!l and in order to maintain system reliability.        Ms. Thiry\ndemonstrated that third-party purchases for the system compared favorably to market price indices\nand to proxy costs of avoided generation. 1040 The Power Marketing Team maintained effective cost\ncontrols and procured a diverse portfolio of product to provide electricity for customers at a\nreasonable cost. 1041 No party contested the prudence of ETI' s short-term power purchases.\n\n\n               ~   Coal Commodity and Transportation\n\n          ETI has ownership interest and/or obtains power through Schedule MSS-4 of the Entergy\nSystem Agreement, in two coal-burning generating units - Nelson and BCil/U3.

ETI owns a 17.85 percent interest in\nBCWU3, but the unit is operated by a third party. ETI witness Ryan Trushenski, the Manager of\nCoal Supply for ESI, testified that ETI prudently managed its coal supply and transportation\nexpenses during the Reconciliation Period. 1042\n\n\n             With respect to coal and transportation expenses at Nelson 6, ETI obtained coal during the\nReconciliation Period under a supply contract previously reviewed by the Commission, and entered\ninto a new coal supply contract after a competitive bid process. ETI chose the supplier with the\nlowest priced coal that met the specifications necessary for use at Nelson 6. Similarly, ETI arranged\nfor transportation of coal according to transportation contracts previously reviewed in prior fuel\nreconciliations. When those contracts expired, ETI initiated a competitive bid process and chose the\nlowest cost option available that met its requirements. With respect to BCWU3, ETI incurred costs\nto run the unit and took reasonable steps to ensure that the third party operator properly charged for\ncoal and transportation expenses under an arrangement previously reviewed and approved in prior\nfuel reconciliations. 1043 No party challenged the reasonableness and necessity of ETI's coal or\ntransportation expense during the Reconciliation Period\n\n\n             The three contested issues are discussed below.\n\n\nA.           Spindletop Gas Storage Facility\n\n             During the Reconciliation Period, ETI incurred $10,261,663 of non-fuel expense associated\nwith operating the Spindletop Facility. Cities challenged ETI's use of the Spindletop Facility,\narguing that the costs of operating it outweigh the benefits gained from it. For the same reason he\nchallenged the Spindletop Facility costs associated with rate base, Cities witrtess Nalepa also\nchallenges ETI's non-fuel expense associated with the facility.             Specifically, Mr. Nalepa\nrecommends that ETI's total fuel reconciliation balance be reduced by $6,595,290, which he\n\n\n1041   Id.\n1042\n       ETI Ex. 33 (Trushenski Direct) at 2.\n1043\n       Id. at 11-13.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                                 PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                           PAGE327\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\ncalculates as the difference between the $10,261,633 non-fuel operational costs associated with the\nSpindletop Facility over the Reconciliation Period and the costs of alternative sources of providing a\nreliable and flexible gas supply over the same period. 1044 fu Section V .H., above, the AU s rejected\nCities' contention that the Spindletop Facility is not used or useful. For the same reason they\nrejected Cities' Spindletop Facility arguments relevant to rate base, the AUs also reject Cities'\nSpindletop Facility arguments relevant to Fuel Reconciliation.\n\n\nB.        Use of Current Line Losses for Fuel Cost Allocation\n\n          Cities propose that the allocation of fuel costs incurred over the Reconciliation Period reflect\nthe current line loss study performed by ETI for this case and recommended for approval on a going\nforward basis. fu the fuel reconciliation case, ETI proposes to allocate costs to customers using a\nline loss study performed in 1997, which Cities claim does not reflect the current cost of providing\nservice to the current wholesale customers and to the various retail customers. 1045 According to\nCities, updating ETI' s allocation of fuel costs to reflect current line losses and the cost of providing\nservice to customers results in a $3,981,271 reduction to the Texas retail fuel expenses incurred over\nthe Reconciliation Period. 1046\n\n\n           ETI responds that the Cities' recommendation is unprecedented.              It notes that the\nCommission's substantive rules require use of \"a commission-approved adjustment to account for\nline losses corresponding to the voltage at which the electric service is provided.\" 1047 Moreover, ETI\nargues that retroactive use of new loss factors to calculate its fuel over/under-recovery balance would\nresult in a mismatch between the revenues recovered under the fuel factor and the costs billed and\nallocated to the various customer classes. 1048\n\n\n\n\n1044\n       Cities Ex. 6 (Nalepa Direct) at 42-43; Cities Initial Brief at 84.\n1045\n       Cities Ex. 6 (Napala Direct) at 44; see also Tr. at 1469-1470.\n1046\n       Cities Ex. 6 (Napala Direct) at 47, Table 14.\n1047\n       ETI Ex. 58 (McCloskey Rebuttal) at 2, quoting P.U.C.

One of the\nelements the fuel factor is required to take into account is line losses.              P.U.C.   SUBST.\n\nR. 25.237(c)(2)(B) states that the utility must prove that: \"the proposed fuel factors utilize a\ncommission-approved adjustment to account for line losses corresponding to the voltage at which the\nelectric service is provided.\" 1049 If the Commission were to adopt Cities' recommendation that the\nnewly-developed line losses be used in the reconciliation of fuel costs, the allocation of those costs\nwould not match the collections (determined through the use of historical line losses). This\nmismatch could result in some customers receiving more than they are entitled and others receiving\nless than they are entitled. The AUs find that the Commission's rules require the use of\nCommission-approved line losses that were in effect at the time fuel costs were billed to customers\nin a fuel reconciliation. The AUs, therefore, recommend that the Commission reject the Cities'\nproposed adjustment.\n\n\nC.           ETl's Special Circumstances Request\n\n             In the application, ETI seeks to include $99,715 in the Fuel Reconciliation to allow it to\nrecover \"the reversal of certain credits that were previously included in the Company's [Incremental\nPurchased Capacity Rider] Rider IPCR.\" 1050 ETI witness Zakrzewski explained that the FERC\nrevised the amount of purchased capacity-related production costs allocable to ETI through the\nFERC-approved Rough Production Cost Equalization mechanism for allocating production costs\namong the Operating Companies. As Mr. Zakrzewski explained, the result of the decision was a\nrecalculation of ETI' s capacity costs recoverable through the Commission-approved Rider IPCR,\nwhich expired during the Reconciliation Period. 1051\n\n\n             During the hearing, no party contested ETI's special circumstances request of $99,715 with\nregard to the IPCR-related adjustment. For the first time in its Initial Brief, however, Cities opposed\n\n\n\n\n1049\n       P.U.C. SUBST.

As pointed out by ETI, 1053 Cities provided no testimony or other\nevidence to support its position. Furthermore, Cities failed to explain how a settlement agreement\nreached in Docket No. 37744 could or should trump the FERC's jurisdiction to determine the\namount of purchased capacity costs attributable to ETI. The only evidence in the record supports\nETI's recovery of these costs. Accordingly, the ALJs recommend that these FERC-imposed costs\nshould be found to be recoverable and Cities' request to deny their recovery should be rejected.\n\n\n           In summary, the ALJs conclude that, consistent with the requirements of P.U.C.       SUBST.\n\nR. 25.236(d)(l), ETI met its burden to prove that: (1) its eligible fuel expenses during the\nReconciliation Period were reasonable and necessary expenses incurred to provide reliable electric\nservice to its retail customers; (2) the prices charges by its affiliates were reasonable and necessary\nand no higher than the prices charged by the supplying affiliates to other affiliates or to unaffiliated\npersons; and (3) ETI has properly accounted for the amount of fuel-related revenues collected\npursuant to the fuel factor during the Reconciliation Period.\n\n\n                                      XII.    OTHER ISSUES\n\nA.         MISO Transition Expenses [Germane to Preliminary Order Issue Nos. 6-8 and Docket\n           No. 39741 Preliminary Order Issue Nos. 1-9]\n\n           Entergy is seeking to transfer operational control of the Entergy Operating Companies'\ntransmission assets to the MISO Regional Transmission Organization (RTO). ETI expects its share\nof the costs for this transfer will include approximately $17 million of expense. 1054 ETI has made\ntwo alternate proposals to recover these expenses. ETI's first proposal requests the Commission to\napprove a deferred accounting of its transition expense incurred on or after January 1, 2011, and to\napprove accrual of interest on the deferred amount at ETI's overall rate of return. Under this\nproposal, ETI would present the resulting regulatory asset for review in a future proceeding.

In its Preliminary Order in Docket 39741, the Commission stated that it\nhad authority to allow such a deferral of costs \"when it is necessary to carry out a provision of\nPURA.\" It also stated that whether ETI's request met this requirement \"hinges on the factual issue\nof necessity .... \"\n\n\n          As an alternative proposal, ETI requested the Commission to include $4 million of transition\nexpense in base rates set in the present case, based on a three-year amortization of a total of\n$12 million in MISO transition expenses. ETI's Test Year MISO transition expenses totaled only\n$916,535, but ETI's request for deferred accounting addressed expenses incurred on or after\nJanuary 1, 2011, which is after the Test Year concluded. ETI argues that its request is a conservative\nknown and measureable change because the post-Test-Year expenses will be significantly more than\n$4 million per year. Further, these costs would be removed from ETI' s cost of service if its deferred\naccounting proposal is approved.\n\n\n          As noted, ETI' s proposals concern MISO transition expenses incurred on or after January 1,\n2011. However, ETI also incurred $263,908 in these expenses during the 2010 portion of the Test\nYear. ETI has proposed a five-year amortization of this amount ($52,800 per year), assuming either\nits primary proposal or its alternative proposal is adopted. However, ifETI's primary and alternative\nproposals are both rejected, ETI requested that no reduction be made to its total Test Year amount of\n$916,535. 1055\n\n\n          Cities, TIEC, State Agencies, and Staff opposed ETI' s requests. They argue that ETI failed to\nestablish that the proposed deferred accounting is necessary to carry out a provision of PURA, as\nrequired by the Commission's Preliminary Order. They also contended that ETI' s alternate request\nto include $4 million in base rates is not a known and measureable change and should be disallowed.\n\n\n          The AU s recommend that the Commission deny ETI' s request for deferred accounting of its\nMISO transition expenses to be incurred on or after January 1, 2011.

Deferred Accounting\n\n          In support of its deferred accounting request, ETI cited State v. Public Utility Comm'n of\nTexas. 1056 In that case, the Texas Supreme Court stated that a deferred accounting is \"necessary\"\nwhen it will \"ensure that the requirements of [PURA] are met.\" 1057 In ETI's opinion, deferred\naccounting is necessary in the present case to ensure that PURA§§ 36.051and36.003(a) are met\n{i.e., that utilities have a reasonable opportunity to recover their expenses and receive reasonable\nrates). ETI also relied on Hammack v. Public Utility Commission of Texas, which stated that \"a need\n... is a relative requirement, ranging from an imperative need to one that is minimal ....\" 1058\n\n\n          ETl-witness Brett Perlman testified that deferred accounting is also necessary to ensure the\nrequirements of PURA § 31.001 (c) are carried out. 1059 That section encourages development of a\ncompetitive wholesale electric market.           ETI noted that the Hammack opinion stated that\nSection 31.00l(c) amounts to a \"legislative directive that the Commission formulate policies\nresponsive to the needs of the emerging competitive wholesale market.\" 1060 Therefore, ETI asserted\nthat RTO membership and deferred accounting are necessary because they will ensure that the\nCommission meets its obligation under Section 31.00l(c). More specifically, ETI stated, bothRTO\nmembership and deferred accounting itself constitute examples of policies required by section\n31.00l(c) to support wholesale competition. Therefore, ETI argues that its request for deferred\n\n\n\n\n1056\n       </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1525109\"><a href=\"/opinion/1525109/state-v-public-utility-comn-of-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">883</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">190</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 1994).\n1057\n       883 S.W.2d at 194.\n1058\n     Hammack v.

He added that ETI has been exploring membership in an\nRTO for over ten years and those costs have historically been included in ETI' s base rates; therefore,\nhe concluded that deferred accounting was not necessary in the past and is not necessary now. Cities\nstressed that ETI conceded that deferred accounting of these expenses is not necessary to maintain its\nfinancial integrity, and in Cities' opinion, both State v. Public Utility Comm'n of Texas, 1062 and the\nCommission's Preliminary Order require a showing of impairment of financial integrity to conclude\nthat deferred accounting is necessary to comply with PURA § 36.051. Cities also stated that ETI\nfailed to show that deferred accounting is necessary to comply with PURA §§ 36.003 and 31.001 (c);\ntherefore, Cities argues that ETI' s request for deferred accounting should be denied.\n\n\n          TIEC also opposed ETI' s request for deferred accounting, arguing that ETI failed to\ndemonstrate that it is necessary to carry out PURA§§ 36.051, 36.003, or 31.00l(c). TIEC witness\nJeffry Pollock stated there is no indication that deferred accounting treatment is necessary for ETI to\nearn a reasonable return on its invested capital or that denying the deferred accounting would prevent\nETI from having just and reasonable rates. Further, Mr. Pollock asserted there is no evidence that a\nlack of deferred accounting treatment for ETI would prevent Entergy from pursuing its MISO\nproposaI. 1063 Mr. Pollock added that ETI has incurred other similar costs to carry out various\npurposes of PURA without deferred accounting. For example, since 2005, ETI has spent nearly\n$20 million pursuing various similar activities, including transitioning to competition, investigating\nRTO options, examining changes to the Entergy System Agreement, and supporting the Entergy\n\n\n1061\n   ETI' s Initial Brief at 231-234; ETI Ex. 42 (Lewis Supplemental Direct) at 2-4; ETI Ex. 43 (Perlman\nSupplemental Direct) at 5-7.\n1062\n       </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1525109\"><a href=\"/opinion/1525109/state-v-public-utility-comn-of-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">883</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">190</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 1994).\n1063\n       TIEC Ex. 1 (Pollock Direct) at 46-47.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE333\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nOATT. Yet, ETI did not seek deferred accounting for any of those costs. Finally, Mr. Pollock\ntestified that the projected transition costs are not material. He noted that ETI expects to incur\n$17 million of transition costs. 1064 This equates to $5.8 million per year, which is only l percent of\nETI's Test Year operating revenues, according to Mr. Pollock. In his opinion, this level of MISO\n                                                                                               1065\ntransition costs is easily subsumed in the normal variation in ETI's year-to-year expenses.\n\n                                                                                                      1066\n          TIEC also disagreed with ETI's interpretation of State v. Public Utility Comm'n ofTexas.\nIn TIEC' s view, that case held that deferred accounting is necessary only when needed to protect the\nfinancial integrity of the utility. Likewise, TIEC disagreed with ETI' s argument that Hammack 1067\nheld that \"need\" is a relative requirement that must be viewed in light of legislative policy\ndirectives. 1068 TIEC noted that Hammack had nothing to do with deferred accounting. Instead, it\nwas limited to the issue of whether, in granting a certificate of convenience and necessity for a\ntransmission line under PURA §37.056, the Commission should include evidence that considered\ncustomers and market participants throughout the state. 1069 In TIEC' s view, the Hammack case is\nirrelevant in determining whether deferred accounting is necessary to carry out the provisions of\nPURA§§ 36.003, 36.051, and 31.003(c). State Agencies made similar arguments.\n\n\n          Commission Staff also argues that ETI did not establish why deferred accounting is necessary\nto carry out a provision of PURA. In Staff's view, the applicable court cases and other precedent\nrequired ETI to show that deferred accounting is necessary to maintain its financial integrity, in order\nto carry out the provisions of PURA § 36.051.

Second, Staff argues that ETI failed establish that\ndeferred accounting is \"necessary\" to support a competitive wholesale market or that failure to allow\ndeferred accounting would prevent that goal. In other words, ETI did not show that, absent deferral,\nit would not join MISO; thus, ETI did not show how deferral would \"ensure\" that it joins an RTO.\nTherefore, Staff concluded, because ETI failed to prove that deferred accOlmting is necessary to cairy\nout any provision of PURA, ETI' s request should be denied.\n\n\n          In response to these arguments, ETI noted that no party disputed that the Commission may\ngrant deferred accounting \"when it is necessary to carry out a provision of PURA.\" It also argues\nthat Staff and intervenors misinterpreted State v. Public Utility Comm'n ofTexas 1013 as holding that\ndeferred accounting is necessary to carry out PURA § 36.051 only when a utility's financial integrity\nis at stake. Although lack of financial integrity is an indication that PURA § 36.051 has not been\ncarried out, ETI noted that this section contains other express requirements that can be met through\ndeferred accounting, such as ensuring utilities a reasonable opportunity to recover their costs. ETI\nalso cited other Commission cases in which it authorized deferred accounting when financial\nintegrity was not at stake, such as deferral of rate case expenses and merger costs for subsequent\n\n\n\n1070\n   Application of Entergy Texas, Inc. for Authority to Defer Expenses Related to its Proposed Transition to\nMembership in The Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator, Docket No. 39741 Preliminary\nOrder at 9 (Sep. 2, 2011).\n1071\n       ETI Initial Brief at 234.\n1072\n       Docket No. 39741, Preliminary Order at 11.\n1073\n       </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1525109\"><a href=\"/opinion/1525109/state-v-public-utility-comn-of-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">883</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">190</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 1994).\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                          PAGE335\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nreview and recovery. 1074 ETI added that deferred accounting would permit the Commission to\nreview ETI's transition expenses in a subsequent proceeding, after determining whether ETI's\ntransition to MISO is in the public interest. Thus, under ETI's proposal, there is no risk that ETI\nwould recover such costs absent a finding that they are reasonable and necessary.\n\n\n          As for Staff and TIEC's argument that deferred accounting is not necessary to carry out\nPURA§ 31.00l(c), ETI argues that the \"necessary\" standard is not a \"but for\" test. In response to\narguments that the proposed deferred accounting will merely further policy objectives of\nSection 31.001 (c), which the Commission has deemed insufficient to meet the \"necessary\"\nstandard, 1075 ETI reiterated that the Hammack opinion held that \"the Commission's interpretation of\nneed must be viewed in light of the legislative directive that the Commission formulate policies\nresponsive to the needs of the emerging competitive wholesale market,\" as well as \"overall policy\nobjectives.\" 1076 Thus, ETI argues, that it has demonstrated that deferred accounting is necessary to\ncarryout Section 31.00l(c)- i.e., it will \"ensure\" that the requirements of that provision are carried\nout, and in particular ensure that the Legislature's specific instruction to develop the wholesale\nmarket is carried out. 1077\n\n\n          Although ETI's proposal for deferred accounting has some practical appeal, the ALls\nconclude that ETI has not shown that it is necessary to carry out a provision of PURA. The AU s\nfind that ETI was not required to show that a deferred accounting is necessary to maintain its\nfinancial integrity, as argued by intervenors. In State v. Public Utility Comm 'n of Texas, 1078 the\nTexas Supreme Court held that preserving the financial integrity of a utility was necessary to carry\nout a provision of PURA, and thus justified deferred accounting for certain expenses in that case, but\nthe court did not hold that preserving financial integrity was the sole basis upon which a deferred\n\n\n1074\n       ETI Reply Brief at 95-96.\n1075\n       Docket No. 397 41, Preliminary Order at 7.\n1076\n     Hammack v.

Likewise, in its Preliminary Order for the present case, the\nCommission stated:        \"This standard [financial integrity] is not appropriate, however, for all\ncircumstances and the Commission has applied different standards in various circumstances,\nalthough none of these standards or circumstances has been reviewed by any court.\" 1079 On the other\nhand, the ALls also find that ETI's contention that deferred accounting of the MISO transition\nexpenses will help the development of a competitive wholesale electric market, as described in\nPURA § 31.001 (c ), is not sufficient to authorize deferred accounting. Again, the Commission stated\nin the Preliminary Order that \"to carry out a provision of PURA\" means more than undefined\nprogress or movement towards a statutory objective. 1080\n\n\n           The Commission made clear that ETI' s burden was not only to show that a provision of\nPURA would be carried out by an accounting deferral of the MISO transition expenses, but that the\ndeferral is necessary to carry out that provision. The Commission added that necessity was a\nquestion of fact that \"can only be determined after development of an adequate factual record that\ndemonstrates the necessity, of whatever degree.\" 1081 Intervenors argue that Entergy's efforts to\ntransfer operational control of the Entergy Operating Companies' transmission assets to MISO will\nproceed with or without the deferred accounting requested by ETI; thus, deferred accounting is not\nnecessary. Likewise, intervenors argue that ETI's alternate proposal to recover the transition costs\nthrough base rates shows that deferred accounting is not necessary. ETI, however, asserted that\nnecessity should not be considered a \"but for\" requirement. It noted that no provision of PURA\nwould be impossible to carry out absent a deferral of rate case expenses or merger expenses, yet the\nCommission has allowed deferred accounting of such expenses in other cases. ETI also cited the\nstatement in Hammack v. Public Utility Commission of Texas that \"a need . . . is a relative\nrequirement, ranging from an imperative need to one that is minimal ....\" 1082 Intervenors criticized\nETI' s reliance on the Hammack case because it concerned a transmission line.

This\nis also consistent with the Commission's statement in the Preliminary Order that ETI' s burden was to\ndemonstrate necessity, \"of whatever degree.\"\n\n\n       ETI' s complaint is that its MISO transition expenses will soon increase above the Test Year\namount, from $916,535 for the Test Year to over $5 million per year, but it will not be able to\nrecover the increased costs through normal Test Year cost-of-service ratemaking principles. Thus,\nalthough ETI' s financial integrity may not be jeopardized, ETI argues that it nevertheless will not be\nable to have a reasonable opportunity to recover its expenses and receive reasonable rates as required\nby PURA§§ 36.051 and 36.003(a). Therefore, ETI believes the proposed deferred accounting is\nnecessary to carry out those provisions of PURA.\n\n\n       The AU s find that the essence of ETI' s complaint is that regulatory lag works against it in\nthis particular situation. But as noted by the court in State v. Public Utility Comm'n of Texas,\nregulatory lag is an ordinary element of risk for utilities. 1083 One of the characteristics of Test Year\ncost-of-service ratemaking is that some expenses upon which rates are based may go up and others\nmay go down during the time the rates are in effect. Such changes can be corrected in future\nratemaking proceedings, but in this case ETI desires to ensure that it will recover all of its MISO\ntransition costs. But State v. Public Utility Comm'n of Texas and the Commission's Preliminary\nOrder in this case make clear that eliminating the normal effects of regulatory lag by allowing a\ndeferred accounting should not be undertaken lightly. If ETI's arguments were taken to their\nextreme, a utility could obtain deferred accounting any time it anticipated a post Test Year increase\nin a particular expense, under the argument that it must be allowed to recover all of its expenses to\ncarry out the requirements of PURA§§ 36.051and36.003(a). In this case, ETI's estimated MISO\ntransition costs will equal about $5.8 million per year. As Mr. Pollock noted, this is only one percent\nof ETI' s Test Year operating revenues, which may easily be subsumed in the normal variation in\nETI's year-to-year expenses. Under these circumstances, ETI has not shown that granting its\nrequested deferred accounting is necessary to carry out the requirements of PURA §§ 36.051 and\n36.003(a) that it receive just and reasonable rates. Therefore, the ALls recommend that the\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                        PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                 PAGE338\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\nCommission deny ETI' s request for deferred accounting treatment of its MISO transition expenses to\nbe incurred on or after January 1, 2011.\n\n\n        2. Base Rate Recovery\n\n        As mentioned above, if the Commission denies ETI's request for deferred accounting, ETI\nrequested the Commission to include $4 million of MISO transition expense in base rates set in the\npresent case, based on a three-year amortization of $12 million in total projected expenses.\n\n\n        Cities disputed the amount of MISO expenses ETI requested in this proposal. Cities witness\nMark Garrett testified that a $4 million annual expense is inconsistent with ETI' s own projected\ncosts. The Test Year expenses were $916,535, and the actual expenses incurred during January\nthrough November 2011 were only $2.513 million, which annualized would be $2.742 million..\nFor 2013, ETI projected MISO transition expenses of only $2.587 million, although ETI's\nprojected 2012 level of $8.9 million. However, Mr. Garrett added that 2012 is an estimated level and\nis not consistent with actual 2011 results. In his opinion, the actual 2011 level of about $2. 7 million\nor the expected 2013 level of about $2.6 million should be the outside range of what the Commission\nshould use for setting prospective rates. In any event, however, Cities argue that these projected\nlevels are not sufficiently known and measurable to include for ratemaking purposes. Cities pointed\nout that it is unknown whether ETI' s proposed move to MISO will even be approved, or whether the\nETI will even continue to incur costs toward a MISO transition. Therefore, Cities argues that only\nthe Test Year level of $916,535 should be included in rates, which would result in a downward\nadjustment of $3,083,462 to ETI's request. 1084\n\n\n        TIEC also argues that ETI' s alternative proposal should be rejected. Mr. Pollock complained\nthat this proposal would allow ETI to recover post Test Year expenses that are not known and\nmeasureable. Mr. Pollock noted that ETI' sown estimate of its share of transition costs has changed.\nWhen ETI filed its request for deferred accounting in Docket No. 39741, it estimated transition costs\n\nt0s 3 </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1525109\"><a href=\"/opinion/1525109/state-v-public-utility-comn-of-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">883</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">190</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 196 (Tex. 1994).\n1084\n     Cities Ex. 2 (Garrett Direct) at 61-63 and Ex.

Now it estimates costs of $17 million, an increase of over 40 percent. Further,\nMr. Pollock stated, ETI based its share of the estimated transition costs by assuming a 17 percent\nresponsibility ratio, but ETI's future responsibility ratios are not known because they are based on\nprojected growth rates of ETI relative other Entergy Operating Companies. Thus, Mr. Pollock\nconcluded that ETI' s share of future MISO transition costs cannot be appropriately measured. toss In\nsummary, TIEC argues that the Commission should deny ETI' s request for deferred accounting and\nshould allow ETI to recover only Test Year MISO transition expenses. to86 Commission Staff made\narguments similar to Cities and TIEC. 1087\n\n\n          In response, ETI argues that the $4 million annual expense requested is known and\nmeasurable. ETI noted that it already incurred over $3.6 million in transition expense in the nine\nmonths since the end of the Test Year, 1088 which equates to $4.8 million on an annual basis.\nFurthermore, ETI' s expects $17 million in transition expenses to be incurred over three years, which\nequates to $5.8 million annually. 1089 lnETI's view, the issue is whether it is sufficiently known that\nETI will incur at least $12 million in transition expense, not whether ETI can predict an exact level\nof future expense. 1090\n\n\n          The AUs recommend that the Commission authorize ETI to include $2.4 million in base\nrates set in the present case for MISO transition expense incurred on or after January 2, 2011, based\non a five-year amortization of $12 million in total projected expenses. The primary argument of\nintervenors against the adjustment is that the total of $12 million is not a known and measurable\nchange. However, the AUs find that ETI's evidence established that such expenses will total at\nleast $12 million. It is true that the Test Year expenses were less, but ETI filed its application to\neffectuate the transfer to MISO in 2012, so it is clear that those expenses will increase significantly\n\n\n1085\n       TIEC Ex. 1 (Pollock Direct) at 49-50.\n1086\n       TIEC Initial Brief at 97-98; TIEC Reply Brief at 70-71.\n1087\n       Staff Reply Brief at 65-66.\n1088\n       ETI Ex. 46 (Considine Rebuttal), Ex.

It is true that ETI has not established the precise total\namount of MISO transition expenses it will incur, but the ALJs find that those expenses will likely\nexceed the $12 million included in ETI's request. ETI requested that the $12 million total be\namortized over three years, which would produce a $4 million annual cost. However, ETI also\nrequested to amortize over five years its $263,908 in MISO transition expenses that were incurred\nduring the 2010 portion of the Test Year ($52,800 per year). If a five-year amortization is\nappropriate for those expenses, a five-year amortization would also be appropriate for the post Test\nYear MISO transition expenses. Therefore, the ALJs recommend that the Commission authorize\nETI to include in base rates $52,800 in MISO transition expenses for the 2010 portion of the Test\nYear expenses, plus $2.4 million for the post Test Year adjustment, for a total of $2,452,800.\n\n\nB.         TCRF Baseline [Germane to Supplemental Preliminary Order Issue No. 2]\n\n           In its Supplemental Preliminary Order, the Commission found that it would be appropriate to\nestablish for ETI baseline values for a TCRF and a DCRF, which may be established in future\ndockets. ETI' s filing package included worksheets for these baseline values, 1091 and ETI attached\nrevised versions of the worksheets to its initial brief to reflect ETI' s revised depreciation\ncalculations. The revised version of the transmission worksheet calculated total transmission cost\nbaseline revenue requirements of $75,074,987-Total Company and $74,997,366-Retail. 1092\nHowever, ETI acknowledged that these values may change, depending on the rulings in this case. If\nthe Commission makes other changes to ETI' s requested costs, ETI proposes filing another revised\nTCRF baseline value calculation in the compliance phase of this case, to reflect the final decisions of\nthe Commission. 1093 TIEC, Cities, and Staff also point out that various items in ETI's calculation\nhave been contested. Therefore, they also recommend that the baseline values be set during the\ncompliance phase of this case. The ALJ s agree that TCRF baseline values should be set during the\ncompliance phase of this docket, after the Commission makes final rulings on the various contested\nissues that may affect this calculation.\n\n1091\n       ETI Ex. 31 (LeBlanc Direct) at Ex.

DCRF Baseline [Germane to Supplemental Preliminary Order Issue No. 2]\n\n          As discussed above, the Commission found in its Supplemental Preliminary Order that it\nwould be appropriate to establish for ETI baseline values for a DCRF, which may be established in a\nfuture docket. ETI' s filing package included worksheets for a DCRF baseline value, 1094 and ETI\nattached a revised version of the worksheet to its initial brief to reflect ETI' s revised depreciation\ncalculations. The revised version of the distribution worksheet calculated total distribution cost\nbaseline revenue requirements of $163,560,232-Total Company and $161,537,490-Retail. 1095\nHowever, ETI acknowledged that these values may change, depending on the rulings in this case. If\nthe Commission makes other changes to ETI' s requested costs, ETI proposes filing another revised\nDCRF baseline value calculation in the compliance phase of this case, to reflect the final decisions of\nthe Commission. 1096 TIEC, Cities, and Staff also recommend that the baseline values be set during\nthe compliance phase of this case. The ALl s agree that DCRF baseline values should be set during\nthe compliance phase of this docket, after the Commission makes final rulings on the various\ncontested issues that may affect this calculation.\n\n\nD.        Purchased Power Capacity Cost Baseline [Germane to Supplemental Preliminary\n          Order Issue No. 1]\n\n          ETI requested a PPR rider in its application, but the Commission held in its Supplemental\nPreliminary Order that the proposed rider should not be considered due to the pending rulemaking\nProject No. 39246, which was opened to consider purchased capacity riders.              However, the\nCommission did add the following issue to the present case: \"What is the amount of purchased-\ncapacity costs that are proposed to be included in Entergy' s base rates?\" ETI requested authority to\ninclude $275,809,485 in its PPR rider, but because the Commission excluded the PPR rider from\nconsideration, this amount would now be included in base rates. ETI acknowledged that this amount\n\n\n\n\n1094\n       ETI Ex. 31 (LeBlanc Direct) at Ex.

Third-party contracts;\n                      2.    Legacy affiliate contracts;\n                      3.    Other affiliate contracts; and\n                      4.    Reserve Equalization.\n\n\nThe costs for all of these but third-party contracts are determined through various MSS Schedules in\nthe FERC-approved Entergy System Agreement. Therefore, State Agencies argue that if the\nCommission decides to allow purchased capacity cost recovery riders in Project No. 39246, the\nbaseline costs for ETI should be limited to only the purchased capacity costs associated with\nnon-affiliate third-party contracts. In State Agencies' opinion, ETI should not be allowed to pass\nthrough purchased capacity costs associated with legacy and other affiliate contracts or reserve\nequalization purchases, because those are not market competitive contracts. Instead, according to\nState Agencies, the affiliate contracts and reserve equalization purchases are essentially agreements\nto share centralized planned generation capacity resources among Entergy Operating Companies and\nto allocate generation costs among those companies. State Agencies also noted that these capacity\npayments are determined based on formulae in Service Schedules MSS-1 and MSS-4, included in the\nFERC-approved Entergy System Agreement. In other words, these costs are not driven by market\nprices and are not subject to market price volatility. Therefore, State Agencies argue that purchases\nother than third-party contracts should not be used as a baseline for any rider intended to address\nmarket price volatility and competitive wholesale market pressure for purchased generation\n         . •   1098\ncapacities.\n\n\n\n\n1097\n       ETI Initial Brief at 240.\n1098\n       State Agencies Ex. 2 (Pevoto Direct) at 17.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE343\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n          Cities agree with the arguments of State Agencies. fu addition, Cities stressed that if the\nCommission establishes a baseline for purchased power capacity costs, the baseline should reflect the\nunit cost of capacity rather than total dollars. Cities witness Nalepa testified that the unit cost would\nprovide a more accurate measure than total dollars. fu Cities• opinion, if a unit cost finding is not\nmade in this case, then Commission will be prevented from considering all options in the\nrulemak:ing.\n\n\n          TIEC points out that the notice in Project No. 39246 provided that \"[t]he purpose of this\nrulemak:ing project is to address the recovery of purchased power capacity costs considering\ngeneration embedded in base rates, load growth, and the impact of purchased power capacity\nrecovery on the financial standing of the utility.\" 1099 Accordingly, TIEC argues that the baseline set\nin this proceeding should reflect ETI' s total purchased power and installed capacity costs determined\nto be properly included in base rates on a total cost basis and on a per unit ($/MW) basis. 1100\n\n\n          As discussed in Section VII.A., the ALJ s find that the appropriate amount for ETI' s\npurchased power capacity expense to be included in base rates is $245,432,884. This responds to the\nissue included in the Commission's Supplemental Preliminary Order. This amount includes third-\nparty contracts, legacy affiliate contracts; other affiliate contracts; and reserve equalization. Whether\nthe amounts for all contracts should be included in the baseline for a purchased capacity rider that\nmay be approved in Project No. 39246 is an issue that should be decided in that proceeding, not in\nthe present case. Therefore, the ALJ s make no recommendation on that issue raised by the\nintervenors.\n\n\n                                     XIII.     CONCLUSION\n\n          The AUs recommend that the Commission implement the findings of the AUs set forth in\nthe discussion above by adopting the following proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law in\nthe Commission's final order.\n\n\n1099\n       Project No. 39246, Public Notice (May 10, 2011).\n1100\n       TIEC Initial Brief at 99.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                    PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE344\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n     XIV.   PROPOSED FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW, AND\n                          ORDERING PARAGRAPHS\n\nA.     Findings of Fact\n\nProcedural History\n\n1.     Entergy Texas, Inc. (ETI or the Company) is an investor-owned electric utility with a retail\n       service area located in southeastern Texas.\n\n2.     ETI serves retail and wholesale electric customers in Texas. As of June 30, 2011, ETI served\n       approximately 412,000 Texas retail customers. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\n       (FERC) regulates ETI's wholesale electric operations.\n\n3.     On November 28, 2011, ETI filed an application requesting approval of: (1) a proposed\n       increase in annual base rate revenues of approximately $111.8 million over adjusted test year\n       revenues; (2) a set of proposed tariff schedules presented in the Electric Utility Rate Filing\n       Package for Generating Utilities (RFP) accompanying ETI' s application and including new\n       riders for recovery of costs related to purchased power capacity and renewable energy credit\n       requirements; (3) a request for final reconciliation of ETI's fuel and purchased power costs\n       for the reconciliation period from July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2011; and (4) certain waivers to\n       the instructions in RFP Schedule V accompanying ETI' s application.\n\n4.     The 12-month test year employed in ETI's filing ended on June 30, 2011 (Test Year).\n\n5.     ETI provided notice by publication for four consecutive weeks before the effective date of\n       the proposed rate change in newspapers having general circulation in each county of ETI' s\n       Texas service territory. ETI also mailed notice of its proposed rate change to all of its\n       customers. Additionally, ETI timely served notice of its statement of intent to change rates\n       on all municipalities retaining original jurisdiction over its rates and services.\n\n6.     The following parties were granted intervenor status in this docket: Office of Public Utility\n       Counsel (OPC); the cities of Anahuac, Beaumont, Bridge City, Cleveland, Conroe, Dayton,\n       Groves, Houston, Huntsville, Montgomery, Navasota, Nederland, Oak Ridge North, Orange,\n       Pine Forest, Rose City, Pinehurst, Port Arthur, Port Neches, Shenandoah, Silsbee, Sour Lake,\n       Splendora, Vidor, and West Orange (Cities), the Kroger Co. (Kroger); State Agencies (State\n       Agencies); Texas Industrial Energy Consumers (TIEC); East Texas Electric Cooperative, Inc.\n       (ETEC); the United States Department of Energy (DOE); and Wal-Mart Stores Texas, LLC,\n       and Sam's East, Inc. (Wal Mart). The Staff (Staff) of the Public Utility Commission of\n       Texas (Commission or PUC) was also a participant in this docket.\n\n7.     On November 29, 2011, the Commission referred this case to the State Office of\n       Administrative Hearings (SOAH).\n\fSOAHDOCKET N O . -                    PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE345\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n8.    On December 7, 2011, the Commission issued its order requesting briefing on threshold\n      legal/policy issues.\n\n9.    On December 19, 2011, the Commission issued its Preliminary Order, identifying 31 issues\n      to be addressed in this proceeding.\n\n10.   On December 20, 2011, the Administrative Law Judges (AUs) issued SOAH Order No. 2,\n      which approved an agreement among the parties to establish a June 30, 2012 effective date\n      for the Company's new rates resulting from this case pursuant to certain agreed language and\n      consolidate Application of Entergy Texas, Inc. for Authority to Defer Expenses Related to its\n      Proposed Transition to Membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator, Docket\n      No. 39741 (pending) into this proceeding. Although it did not agree, Staff did not oppose the\n      consolidation.\n\n11.   On January 13, 2012, the AU s issued SOAH Order No.4 granting the motions for admission\n      pro hac vice filed by Kurt J. Boehm and Jody M. Kyler to appear and participate as counsel\n      for Kroger and the motion for admission pro hac vice filed by Rick D. Chamberlain to appear\n      and participate as counsel for Wal-Mart.\n\n12.   On January 19, 2012, the Commission issued a Supplemental Preliminary Order identifying\n      two additional issues to be addressed in this case and concluding that the Company's\n      proposed purchased power capacity rider should not be addressed in this case and that such\n      costs should be recovered through base rates.\n\n13.   ETI timely filed with the Commission petitions for review of the rate ordinances of the\n      municipalities exercising original jurisdiction within its service territory. All such appeals\n      were consolidated for determination in this proceeding.\n\n14.   OnApril4, 2012, theAUs issued SOAH Order No. 13 severingratecaseexpenseissues into\n      Application of Entergy Texas, Inc. for Rate Case Expenses Severed from PUC Docket\n      No. 39896, Docket No. 40295 (pending).\n\n15.   On April 13, 2012, ETI adjusted its request for a proposed increase in annual base rate\n      revenues to approximately $104.8 million over adjusted Test Year revenues.\n\n16.   The hearing on the merits commenced on April 24 and concluded on May 4, 2012.\n\n17.   Initial post-hearing briefs were filed on May 18 and reply briefs were filed on May 30, 2012.\n\nRate Base\n\n18.   Capital additions that were closed to ETI's plant-in-service between July 1, 2009, and June\n      30, 2011, are used and useful in providing service to the public and were prudently incurred.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                   PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE346\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n19.   ETI's proposed Hurricane Rita regulatory asset was an issue resolved by the black-box\n      settlement in Application of Entergy Texas, Inc.for Authority to Change Rates and Reconcile\n      Fuel Costs, Docket No. 37744 (Dec. 13, 2010).\n\n20.   Accrual of carrying charges on the Hurricane Rita regulatory asset should have ceased when\n      Docket No. 37744 concluded because the asset would have then begun earning a rate of\n      return as part of rate base.\n\n21.   The appropriate calculation of the Hurricane Rita regulatory asset should begin with the\n      amount claimed by ETI in Docket No. 37744, less amortization accruals to the end of the\n      Test Year in the present case, and less the amount of additional insurance proceeds received\n      by ETI after the conclusion of Docket No. 37744.\n\n22.   A Test-Year-end balance of $15,175,563 for the Hurricane Rita regulatory asset should\n      remain in rate base, applying a five-year amortization rate beginning August 15, 2010.\n\n23.   The Hurricane Rita regulatory asset should not be moved to the storm damage insurance\n      reserve.\n\n24.   The Company requested in rate base its Prepaid Pension Assets Balance of $55,973,545,\n      which represents the accumulated difference between the Statement of Financial Accounting\n      Standards (SFAS) No. 87 calculated pension costs each year and the actual contributions\n      made by the Company to the pension fund.\n\n25.   The Prepaid Pension Assets Balance includes $25 ,311,236 capitalized to construction work\n      in progress (CWIP).\n\n26.   It is not necessary to the financial integrity of ETI to include CWIP in rate base, and there\n      was insufficient evidence showing that major projects under construction were efficiently\n      and prudently managed.\n\n27.   The portion of the Prepaid Pension Assets Balance that is capitalized to CWIP should not be\n      included in ETI' s rate base.\n\n28.   The remainder of the Prepaid Pension Assets Balance should be included in ETI' s rate base.\n\n29.   ETI should be permitted to accrue an allowance for funds used during construction on the\n      portion ofETI's Prepaid Pension Assets Balance capitalized to CWIP.\n\n30.   The Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) Financial Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48),\n      \"Accountingfor Uncertainty in Income Taxes,\" requires ETI to identify each of its uncertain\n      tax positions by evaluating the tax position on its technical merits to determine whether the\n      position, and the corresponding deduction, is more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the\n      Internal Revenue Service (IRS) if audited.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                    PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE347\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n31.   FIN 48 requires ETI to remove the amount of its uncertain tax positions from its\n      Accumulated Deferred Federal Income Tax (ADFIT) balance for financial reporting purposes\n      and record it as a potential liability with interest to better reflect the Company's financial\n      condition.\n\n32.   At Test Year-end, ETI had $5,916,461 in FIN 48 liabilities, meaning ETI has, thus far,\n      avoided paying to the IRS $5,916,461 in tax dollars (the FIN 48 Liability) in reliance upon\n      tax positions that the Company believes will not prevail in the event the positions are\n      challenged, via an audit, by the IRS.\n\n33.   ETI has deposited $1,294,683 with the IRS in connection with the FIN 48 Liability.\n\n34.   The IRS may never audit ETI as to its uncertain tax positions creating the FIN 48 Liability.\n\n35.   Even if ETI is audited, ETI might prevail on its uncertain tax positions.\n\n36.   ETI may never have to pay the IRS the FIN 48 Liability.\n\n37.   Other than the amount of its deposit with the IRS, ETI has current use of the FIN 48 Liability\n      funds.\n\n38.   Until actually paid to the IRS, the FIN 48 Liability represents cost-free capital and should be\n      deducted from rate base.\n\n39.   The amount of $4,621,778 (representing ETI's full FIN 48 Liability of $5,916,461 less the\n      $1,294,683 cash deposit ETI has made with the IRS for the FIN 48 Liability) should be added\n      to ETI' s AD FIT and thus be used to reduce ETI' s rate base.\n\n40.   ETI's application and proposed tariffs do not include a request for a tracking mechanism or\n      rider to collect a return on the FIN 48 Liability.\n\n41.   ETI has not proven that a tracking mechanism or rider to collect a return on FIN 48 Liability\n      is necessary.\n\n42.   Investor-owned electric utilities may include a reasonable allowance for cash working capital\n      in rate base as determined by a lead-lag study conducted in accordance with the\n      Commission's rules.\n\n43.   Cash working capital represents the amount of working capital, not specifically addressed in\n      other rate base items, that is necessary to fund the gap between the time expenditures are\n      made and the time corresponding revenues are received.\n\n44.   The lead-lag study conducted by ETI considered the actual operations of ETI, adjusted for\n      known and measurable changes, and isconsistentwithP.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.231(c)(2)(B)(iii).\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE348\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n45.   It is reasonable to establish ETI' s cash working capital requirement based on ETI' s lead-lag\n      study as updated in Jay Joyce's rebuttal testimony and on the cost of service approved for\n      ETI in this case.\n\n46.   As a result of the black-box settlements in Application of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. for\n      Authority to Change Rates and to Reconcile Fuel Costs, Docket No. 34800 (Nov. 7, 2008)\n      and Docket No. 37744, the Commission did not approve ETI' s storm damage expenses since\n      1996 and its storm damage reserve balance.\n\n47.   ETI established a primafacie case concerning the prudence of its storm damage expenses\n      incurred since 1996.\n\n48.   Adjustments to the storm damage reserve balance proposed by intervenors should be denied.\n\n49.   The Hurricane Rita regulatory asset should not be moved to the storm damage insurance\n      reserve.\n\n50.   ETI's appropriate Test-Year-end storm reserve balance was negative $59,799,744.\n\n51.   The amount of $9,846,037, representing the value of the average coal inventory maintained\n      at ETI' s coal-burning facilities, is reasonable, necessary, and should be included in rate base.\n\n52.   The Spindletop gas storage facility (Spindletop Facility) is used and useful in providing\n      reliable and flexible natural gas supplies to ETI' s Sabine Station and Lewis Creek generating\n      plants.\n\n53.   The Spindletop Facility is critical to the economic, reliable operation of the Sabine Station\n      and Lewis Creek generating plants due to their geographic location in the far western region\n      of the Entergy system.\n\n54.   It is reasonable and appropriate to include ETI' s share of the costs to operate the Spindletop\n      Facility in rate base.\n\n55.   Staff recommended updating ETI's balance amounts for short-term assets to the 13-month\n      period ending December 2011, which was the most recent information available. Staff's\n      proposed adjustments should be incorporated into the calculation of ETI's rate base.\n\n56.   The following short-term asset amounts should be included in rate base: prepayments at\n      $8,134,351; materials and supplies at $29,285,421; and fuel inventory at $52,693,485.\n\n57.   The amount of $1,127,778, representing costs incurred by ETI when it acquired the\n      Spindletop facility, represent actual costs incurred to process and close the acquisition, not\n      mere mark-up costs.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                     PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE349\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n58.   ETI' s $1, 127,778 in capitalized acquisition costs should be included in rate base because ETI\n      incurred these costs in conjunction with the purchase of a viable asset that benefits its retail\n      customers.\n\n59.    In its application, ETI capitalized into plant in service accounts some of the incentive\n       payments ETI made to its employees. ETI seeks to include those amounts in rate base.\n\n60.    A portion of those capitalized incentive accounts represent payments made by ETI for\n       incentive compensation tied to financial goals.\n\n61.    The portion of ETI' s incentive payments that are capitalized and that are financially-based\n       should be excluded from ETI' s rate base because the benefits of such payments inure most\n       immediately and predominantly to ETI's shareholders, rather than its electric customers.\n\n62.    The Test Year for ETI's prior ratemaking proceeding ended on June 30, 2009, and the\n       reasonableness of ETI' s capital cos ts (including capitalized incentive compensation) for that\n       prior period was dealt with by the Commission in that proceeding and is not at issue in this\n       proceeding.\n\n63.    In this proceeding, ETI' s capitalized incentive compensation that is financially-based should\n       be excluded from rate base, but only for incentive costs that ETI capitalized during the period\n       from July 1, 2009 (the endofthepriorTest Year)throughJune30, 2010 (the commencement\n       of the current Test Year).\n\nRate of Return and Cost of Capital\n\n64.    A return on common equity (ROE) of 9.80 percent will allow ETI a reasonable opportunity\n       to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital.\n\n65.    The results of the discounted cash flow model and risk premium approach support a ROE of\n       9.80 percent.\n\n66.    A 9.80 percent ROE is consistent with ETI's business and regulatory risk.\n\n67.    ETI's proposed 6.74 percent embedded cost of debt is reasonable.\n\n68.    The appropriate capital structure for ETI is 50.08 percent long-term debt and 49.92 percent\n       common equity.\n\n69.    A capital structure composed of 50.08 percent debt and 49.92 percent equity is reasonable in\n       light of ETI' s business and regulatory risks.\n\n70.    A capital structure composed of 50.08 percent debt and 49.92 percent equity will help ETI\n       attract capital from investors.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                     PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE350\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n71.

ETI's Test Year purchased capacity expenses were $245.432,884.\n\n73.    ETI requested an upward adjustment of $30,809,355 as a post-Test Year adjustment to its\n       purchased capacity costs. This request was based on ETI' s projections of its purchased\n       capacity expenses during a period beginning June 1, 2012 and ending May 31, 2013 (the Rate\n       Year).\n\n74.   ETI' s purchased capacity expense projections were based on estimates of Rate Year expenses\n      for: (a) reserve equalization payments under Schedule MSS-1; (b) payments under third-\n      party capacity contracts; and (c) payments under affiliate contracts.\n\n75.    ETI's projection of its Rate Year reserve equalization payments under Schedule MSS-1 is\n       based on numerous assumptions, including load growths for ETI and its affiliates, future\n       capacity contracts for ETI and its affiliates, and future values of the generation assets of ETI\n       and its affiliates.\n\n76.    There is substantial uncertainty with regard to ETI' s projection of its Rate Year reserve\n       equalization payments under Schedule MSS-1.\n\n77.    ETI' s projection of its Rate Year third-party capacity contract payments includes numerous\n       assumptions, one of which is that every single third-party supplier will perform at the\n       maximum level under the contract, even though that assumption is inconsistent with ETI' s\n       historical experience.\n\n78.    There is substantial uncertainty with regard to ETI' s projection of its Rate Year third-party\n       capacity contract payments.\n\n79.    ETI' s estimates of its Rate Year purchases under affiliate contracts are based on a\n       mathematical formula set out in Schedule MSS-4.\n\n80.    The MSS-4 formula for Rate Year affiliate capacity payments reflects that these payments\n       will be based on ratios and costs that cannot be determined until the month that the payments\n       are to be made.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                   PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE351\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n81.   Over $11 million ofETI's affiliate transactions were basedona2013 contract(theEAIWBL\n      Contract) that was not signed until April 11, 2012.\n\n82.   There is uncertainty about whether the EAI WBL Contract will ever go into effect.\n\n83.   ETI projects purchasing over 300 megawatts (MW) more in purchased capacity in the Rate\n      Year than it purchased in the Test Year.\n\n84.   ETI experienced substantial load growth in the two years before the Test Year, and it\n      continues to project similar load growth in the future.\n\n85.   ETI did not meet its burden of proof to demonstrate that a known and measurable adjustment\n      of $30,809,355 should be made to its Test Year purchased capacity expenses.\n\n86.   ETI's purchased capacity expense in this case should be based on the Test Year level of\n      $245 ,432,884.\n\n87.   ETI incurred $1,753,797 of transmission equalization expense during the Test Year.\n\n88.   ETI proposed an upward adjustment of $8,942, 785 for its transmission equalization expense.\n       This request was based on ETI' s projections of its transmission equalization expenses during\n      the Rate Year.\n\n89.   The transmission equalization expense that ETI will pay in the Rate Year will depend on\n      future costs and loads for each of the Entergy operating companies.\n\n90.   ETI's projection of its Rate Year transmission equalization expenses is uncertain and\n      speculative because it depends on a number of variables, including future transmission\n      investments, deferred taxes, depreciation reserves, costs of capital, tax rates, operating\n      expenses, and loads of each of the Entergy operating companies.\n\n91.   ETI seeks increased transmission equalization expenses for transmission projects that are not\n      currently used and useful in providing electric service. ETI's post-Test Year adjustment is\n      based on the assumption that certain planned transmission projects will go into service after\n      the Test Year. At the close of the hearing, none of the planned transmission projects had\n      been fully completed and some were still in the planning phase.\n\n92.   It is not reasonable for ETI to charge its retail ratepayers for transmission equalization\n      expenses related to projects that are not yet in-service.\n\n93.   ETI's request for a post-Test Year adjustment of $8,942,785 for Rate Year transmission\n      equalization expenses should be denied because those expenses are not known and\n      measurable. ETI' s post-Test Year adjustment does not with reasonable certainty reflect what\n      ETI' s transmission equalization expense will be when rates are in effect.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                     PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE352\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n94.    ETI' s transmission equalization expense in this case should be based on the Test Year level\n       of $1,753,797.\n\n95.    P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.231(c)(2)(ii) states that the reserve for depreciation is the accumulation\n       of recognized allocations of original cost, representing the recovery of initial investment over\n       the estimated useful life of the asset.\n\n96.    Except in the case of the amortization of the general plant deficiency, the use of the\n       remaining life depreciation method to recover differences between theoretical and actual\n       depreciation reserves is the most appropriate method and should be continued.\n\n97.    It is reasonable for ETI to calculate depreciation reserve allocations on a straight-line basis\n       over the remaining, expected useful life of the item or facility.\n\n98.    Except as described below, the service lives and net salvage rates proposed by the Company\n       are reasonable, and these service lives and net salvage rates should be used in calculating\n       depreciation rates for the Company's Production, Transmission, Distribution, and General\n       Plant assets.\n\n99.    A 60-year life for Sabine Units 4 and 5 is reasonable for purposes of establishing production\n       plant depreciation rates.\n\n100.   The retirement (actuarial) rate method, rather than the interim retirement method, should be\n       used in the development of production plant depreciation rates.\n\n101.   Production plant net salvage is reasonably based on the negative five percent net salvage in\n       existing rates.\n\n102.   The net salvage rate of negative 10 percent for ETI's transm1ss10n structures and\n       improvements (FERC Account 352) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be\n       adopted.\n\n103.   The net salvage rate of negative 20 percent for ETI' s transmission station equipment (FERC\n       Account 353) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be adopted.\n\n104.   The net salvage rate of negative five percent for ETI's transmission towers and fixtures\n       (FERC Account 354) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be adopted.\n\n105.   The net salvage rate of negative 30 percent for ETI's transmission poles and fixtures (FERC\n       Account 355) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be adopted.\n\n106.   The net salvage rate of negative 30 percent for ETI' s transmission overhead conductors and\n       devices (FERC Account 356) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be\n       adopted.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                     PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE353\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n107.   A service life of 65 years and a dispersion curve of R3 for ETI' s distribution structures and\n       improvements (FERC Account 361) are the most reasonable of those proposed and should be\n       approved.\n\n108.   A service life of 40 years and a dispersion curve of Rl for ETI's distribution poles, towers,\n       and fixtures (FERC Account 364) are the most reasonable of those proposed and should be\n       approved.\n\n109.   A service life of 39 years and a dispersion curve of R0.5 for ETI's distribution overhead\n       conductors and devices (FERC Account 365) are the most reasonable of those proposed and\n       should be approved.\n\n110.   A service life of 35 years and a dispersion curve of Rl.5 for ETI's distribution underground\n       conductors and devices (FERC Account 367) are the most reasonable of those proposed and\n       should be approved.\n\n111.   A service life of 33 years and a dispersion curve of L0.5 for ETI's distribution line\n       transformers (FERC Account 368) are the most reasonable of those proposed and should be\n       approved.\n\n112.   A service life of 26 years and a dispersion curve ofL4 for ETI' s distribution overhead service\n       (FERC Account 369.1) are the most reasonable of those proposed and should be approved.\n\n113.   The net salvage rate of negative five percent for ETI's distribution structures and\n       improvements (FERC Account 361) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be\n       adopted.\n\n114.   The net salvage rate of negative 10 percent for ETI' s distribution station equipment (FERC\n       Account 362) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be adopted.\n\n115.   The net salvage rate of negative seven percent for ETI' s distribution overhead conductors and\n       devices (FERC Account 365) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be\n       adopted.\n\n116.   The net salvage rate of negative five percent for ETI' s distribution line transformers (FERC\n       Account 368) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be adopted.\n\n117.   The net salvage rate of negative 10 percent for ETI' s distribution overhead services (FERC\n       Account 369.1) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be adopted.\n\n118.   The net salvage rate of negative 10 percent for ETI's distribution underground services\n       (FERC Account 369.2) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be adopted.\n\n119.   A service life of 45 years and a dispersion curve of R2 for ETI's general structures and\n       improvements (FERC Account 390) are the most reasonable of those proposed and should be\n       approved.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE354\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n120.   The net salvage rate of negative 10 percent for ETI's general structures and improvements\n       (FERC Account 390) is the most reasonable of those proposed and should be adopted.\n\n121.   It is reasonable to convert the $21.3 million deficit that has developed over time in the\n       reserve for general plant accounts to General Plant Amortization.\n\n122.   A ten-year amortization of the deficit in the reserve for general plant accounts is reasonable\n       and should be adopted.\n\n123.   FERC pronouncement AR-15 requires amortization over the same life as recommended\n       based on standard life analysis. A standard life analysis determined that a five-year life was\n       appropriate for general plant computer equipment (FERC Account 390.2). Therefore, a five\n       year amortization for this account is reasonable and should be adopted.\n\n124.   ETI proposed adjustments to its Test Year payroll costs to reflect: (a) changes to employee\n       headcount levels at ETI and Entergy Services, Inc. (ESI); and (b) approved wage increases\n       set to go into effect after the end of the Test Year.\n\n125.   The proposed payroll adjustments are reasonable but should be updated to reflect the most\n       recent available information on headcount levels as proposed by Commission Staff. In\n       addition to adjusting payroll expense levels, the more recent headcount numbers should be\n       used to adjust the level of payroll tax expense, benefits expense, and savings plan expense.\n\n126.   Staff has appropriately updated headcount levels to the most recent available data but errors\n       made by Staff should be corrected. The corrections related to: (a) a double counting of three\n       ETI and one ESI employee; (b) inadvertent use of the ETI benefits cost percentage in the\n       calculation of ESI benefits costs; (c) an inappropriate reduction of savings plan costs when\n       such costs were already included in the benefits percentage adjustments; and (d) corrections\n       for full-time equivalents calculations. Staffs ETI headcount adjustment (AG-7) overstated\n       operation and maintenance (O&M) payroll reduction by $224,217, and ESI headcount\n       adjustment (AG-7) understated O&M payroll increase by $37,531.\n\n127.   ETI included $14,187,744 for incentive compensation expenses in its cost of service.\n\n128.   The compensation packages that ETI offers its employees include a base payroll amount,\n       annual incentive programs, and long-term incentive programs. The majority of the\n       compensation is for operational measures, but some is for financial measures.\n\n129.   Incentive compensation that is based on financial measures is of more immediate and\n       predominant benefit to shareholders, whereas incentive compensation based on operational\n       measures is of more immediate and predominant benefit to ratepayers.\n\n130.   Incentives to achieve operational measures are necessary and reasonable to provide utility\n       services but those to achieve financial measures are not.\n\f                             ~~···--····--------------------------\n\n\n\n\nSOAHDOCKETNO.-                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE355\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n131.   The $5,376,975 that was paid for long term incentive programs was tied to financial\n       measures and, therefore, should not be included in ETI' s cost of service.\n\n132.   Of the amounts that were paid pursuant to the Exeeutive Annual Incentive Plan, $819,062\n       was tied to financial measures and, therefore, should be disallowed.\n\n133.   In total, the amount of incentive compensation that should be disallowed is $6,196,037\n       because it was related to financial measures that are not reasonable and necessary for the\n       provision of electric service.\n\n134.   The amount of incentive compensation that should be included in the cost of service is\n       $7,991,707.\n\n135.   To attract and retain highly qualified employees, the Entergy Companies provide a total\n       package of compensation and benefits that is equivalent in scope and cost with what other\n       comparable companies within the utility business and other industries provide for their\n       employees.\n\n136.   When using a benchmark analysis to compare companies' levels of compensation, it is\n       reasonable to view the market level of compensation as a range rather than a precise, single\n       point.\n\n137.   ETI's base pay levels are at market.\n\n138.   ETI' s benefits plan levels are within a reasonable range of market levels.\n\n139.   ETI's level of compensation and benefits expense is reasonable and necessary.\n\n140.   ETI provides non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plans for highly compensated\n       individuals such as key managerial employees and executives that, because of limitations\n       imposed under the Internal Revenue Code, would otherwise not receive retirement benefits\n       on their annual compensation over $245,000 per year.\n\n141.   ETI' s non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plans are discretionary costs designed\n       to attract, retain, and reward highly compensated employees whose interests are more closely\n       aligned with those of the shareholders than the customers.\n\n142.   ETI's non-qualified executive retirement benefits in the amount of $2,114,931 are not\n       reasonable or necessary to provide utility service to the public, not in the public interest, and\n       should not be included in ETI' s cost of service.\n\n143.   For the employee market in which ETI operates, most peer companies offer moving\n       assistance. Such assistance is expected by employees, and ETI would be placed at a\n       competitive disadvantage if it did not offer relocation expenses.\n\n144.   ETI's relocation expenses were reasonable and necessary.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                     PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE356\nPUC DOCKET NO. 398%\n\n\n145.   The Company's requested operating expenses should be reduced by $40,620 to reflect the\n       removal of certain executive prerequisites proposed by Staff.\n\n146.   Staff properly adjusted the Company's requested interest expense of $68,985 by removing\n       $25,938 from FERC account 431 (using the interest rate of 0.12 percent for calendar year\n       2012), leaving a recommended interest expense of $43,047.\n\n147.   During the Test Year, ETI's property tax expense equaled $23,708,829.\n\n148.   ETI requested an upward proforma adjustment of $2,592,420, to account for the property tax\n       expenses ETI estimates it will pay in the Rate Year.\n\n149.   ETI' s requested proforma adjustment is not reasonable because it is based, in part, upon the\n       prediction that ETI' s property tax rate will be increased in 2012, a change that is speculative\n       is not known and measurable.\n\n150.   Staff's recommendation to increase ETI's Test Year property tax expenses by $1,214,688 is\n       based on the historical effective tax rate applied to the known Test Year-end plant in service\n       value, consistent with Commission precedent, and based upon known and measurable\n       changes.\n\n151.   ETI's Test Year property tax burden should be adjusted upward by $1,214,688.\n\n152.   Staff recommended reducing ETI's advertising, dues, and contributions expenses by $12,800.\n       The recommendation, which no party contested, should be adopted.\n\n153.   The final cost of service should reflect changes to cost of service that affect other\n       components of the revenue requirement such as the calculation of the Texas state gross\n       receipts tax, the local gross receipts tax, the PUC Assessment Tax and the Uncollectible\n       Expenses.\n\n154.   The Company's requested Federal income tax expense is reasonable and necessary.\n\n155.   ETI's request for $2,019,000 to be included in its cost of service to account for the\n       Company's annual decommissioning expenses associated with River Bend is not reasonable\n       because it is not based upon \"the most current information reasonably available regarding the\n       cost of decommissioning\" as required by P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.23l(b)(l)(F)(i).\n\n156.   Based on the most current information reasonably available, the appropriate level of\n       decommissioning costs to be included in ETI's cost of service is $1,126,000.\n\n157.   ETI's appropriate total annual self-insurance storm damage reserve expense is $8,270,000,\n       comprised of an annual accrual of $4,400,000 to provide for average annual expected storm\n       losses, plus an annual accrual of $3,870,000 for 20 years to restore the reserve from its\n       current deficit.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                     PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE357\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n158.   ETI's appropriate target self-insurance storm damage reserve is $17,595,000.\n\n159.   ETI should continue recording its annual storm damage reserve accrual until modified by a\n       Commission order.\n\n160.   The operating costs of the Spindletop Facility are reasonable and necessary.\n\n161.   The operating costs of the Spindletop Facility paid to PB Energy Storage Services are eligible\n       fuel expenses.\n\nAffiliate Transactions\n\n162.   ETI affiliates charged ETI $78,998,777 for services during the Test Year. The majority of\n       these O&M expenses-$69,098,041-were charged to ETI by ESL The remaining affiliate\n       services were charged (or credited) to ETI by: Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C.;\n       Entergy Arkansas, Inc.; Entergy Louisiana, LLC; Entergy Mississippi, Inc.; Entergy\n       Operations, Inc.; and non-regulated affiliates.\n\n163.   ESI follows a number of processes to ensure that affiliate charges are reasonable and\n       neces'sary and that ETI and its affiliates are charged the same rate for similar services. These\n       processes include: (a) the use of service agreements to define the level of service required\n       and the cost of those services; (b) direct billing of affiliate expenses where possible;\n       (c) reasonable allocation methodologies for costs that cannot be directly billed; (d) budgeting\n       processes and controls to provide budgeted costs that are reasonable and necessary to ensure\n       appropriate levels of service to its customers; and (e) oversight controls by ETI's Affiliate\n       Accounting and Allocations Department.\n\n164.   Affiliates charged expenses to ETI through 1292 project codes during the Test Year.\n\n165.   ETI agreed to remove the following affiliate transactions from its application:\n       (1) Project F3PPCASHCT (Contractual Alternative/Cashpo) in the amount of $2,553;\n       (2) Project F3PCSPETEI (Entergy-Tulane Energy Institute) in the amount of $14,288; and\n       (3) Project F5PPKATRPT (Storm Cost Processing & Review) in the amount of $929.\n\n166.   The $356,151 (which figure includes the $112,531 agreed to by ETI) of costs associated with\n       Projects F5PCZUBENQ (Non-Qualified Post Retirement) and F5PPZNQBDU (Non Qual\n       Pension/Benf Dom Utl) are costs that are not reasonable and necessary for the provision of\n       electric utility service and are not in the public interest.\n\n167.   The $10,279 of costs associated with Project F3PPFXERSP (Evaluated Receipts Settlement)\n       are not normally-recurring costs and should not be recoverable.\n\n168.   The $19,714 of costs associated with Project F3PPEASTIN (Willard Eastin et al) are related\n       to ESI's operations, it is more immediately related to Entergy Louisiana, Inc. and Entergy\n       New Orleans, Inc. As such, they are not recoverable from Texas ratepayers.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                       PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE358\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n169.    The $171,032 of costs associated with Project F3PPE9981 S (futegrated Energy Management\n        for ESI) are research and development costs related to energy efficiency programs. As such,\n        they should be recovered through the energy efficiency cost recovery factor rather than base\n        rates.\n\n170.    Except as noted in the above Findings of Fact Nos. 162-169, all remaining affiliate\n        transactions were reasonable and necessary, were allowable, were charged to ETI at a price\n        no higher than was charged by the supplying affiliate to other affiliates, and the rate charged\n        is a reasonable approximation of the cost of providing service.\n\nJurisdictional Cost Allocation\n\n171.    ETI has one full or partial requirements wholesale customer - East Texas Electric\n        Cooperative, fuc.\n\n172.    ETI proposes that 150 MW be set as the wholesale load for developing retail rates in this\n        docket. Using 150 MW to set the wholesale load is reasonable. The 150 MW used to set the\n        wholesale load results in a retail production demand allocation factor of 95.3838 percent.\n\n173.    The 12 Coincident Peak (12 CP) allocation method is consistent with the approach used by\n        the FERC to allocate between jurisdictions.\n\n174.    Using 12CP methodology to allocate production costs between the wholesale and retail\n        jurisdictions is the best method to reflect cost responsibility and is appropriate based on\n        ETI's reliance on capacity purchases.\n\nClass Cost Allocation and Rate Design\n\n17 5.   There is no express statutory authorization for ETI' s proposed Renewable Energy Credits\n        Rider (REC Rider).\n\n176.    REC Rider constitutes improper piecemeal ratemaking and should be rejected.\n\n177.    ETI' s Test Year expense for renewable energy credits, $623,303, is reasonable and necessary\n        and should be included in base rates.\n\n178.    Municipal Franchise Fees (MFF) is a rental expense paid by utilities for the right to use\n        public rights-of-way to locate its facilities within municipal limits.\n\n179.    ETI is an integrated utility system. ETI' s facilities located within municipal limits benefit all\n        customers, whether the customers are located inside or outside of the municipal limits.\n\n180.    Because all customers benefit from ETI's rental of municipal right-of-way, municipal\n        franchise fees should be charged to all customers in ETI' s service area, regardless of\n        geographic location.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE359\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n181.   It is reasonable and consistent with the Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA)§ 33.008(b)\n       that MFF be allocated to each customer class on the basis of in-city kilo-watt hour (kWH)\n       sales, without an adjustment for the MFF rate in the municipality in which a givenkWH sale\n       occurred.\n\n182.   The same reasons for allocating and collecting MFF as set out in Finding of Fact Nos. 178-\n       181 also apply to the allocation and collection of Miscellaneous Gross Receipts Taxes. The\n       Company's proposed allocation of these costs to all retail customer classes based on\n       customer class revenues relative to total revenues is appropriate.\n\n183.   The Average and Excess (A&E) 4CP method for allocating capacity-related production costs,\n       including reserve equalization payments, to the retail classes is a standard methodology and\n       the most reasonable methodology.\n\n184.   The A&E 4CP method for allocating transmission costs to the retail classes is standard and\n       the most reasonable methodology.\n\n185.   ETI appropriately followed the rate class revenue requirements from its cost of service study\n       to allocate costs among customer classes. ETI' s revenue allocation properly sets rates at each\n       class's cost of service.\n\n186.   It is reasonable for ETI to eliminate the service condition for Rate Groups A and C in\n       Schedule SHL [Street and Highway Lighting Service] that charges a $50 fee for any\n       replacement of a functioning light with a lower-wattage bulb.\n\n187.   It is appropriate to require ETI to prepare and file, as part of its next base rate case, a study\n       regarding the feasibility of instituting LED-based rates and, if the study shows that such rates\n       are feasible, ETI should file proposals for LED-based lighting and traffic signal rates it next\n       rate case.\n\n188.   An agreement was reached by the parties and approved by the Commission in Docket\n       No. 37744 that directed ETI to exclude, in its next rate case, the life-of-contract demand\n       ratchet for existing customers in the Large Industrial Power Service (LIPS), Large Industrial\n       Power Service-Time of Day, General Service, General Service-Time of Day, Large General\n       Service, and Large General Service-Time of Day rate schedules.\n\n189.   ETl's proposed tariffs in this case did not remove the life-of-contract demand ratchet from\n       these rate schedules consistent with the parties' agreement in Docket No. 37744.\n\n190.   A perpetual billing obligation based on a life-of-contract demand ratchet, as ETI proposed, is\n       not reasonable.\n\n191.   ETI's proposed LIPS and LIPS Time of Day tariffs should be modified to reflect the\n       agreement that was adopted by the Commission as just and reasonable in Docket No. 37744.\n       Accordingly, these tariffs should be modified as set out in Findings of Fact No. 192-194.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE360\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n192.   ETI' s Schedule LIPS and LIPS Time of Day § VI should be changed to read:\n\n                      DETERMINATION OF BILLING LOAD\n\n                      The kW of Billing Load will be the greatest of the following:\n\n                      (A) The Customer's maximum measured 30-minute demand\n                      during any 30-minute interval of the current billing month,\n                      subject to§§ III, IV and V above; or\n\n                      (B) 60% of Contract Power as defined in § VII; or\n\n                      (C) 2,500 kW.\n\n193.   ETI' s Schedule LIPS and LIPS Time of Day § VII should be changed to read:\n\n                      DETERMINATION OF CONTRACT POWER\n\n                      Unless Company gives customer written notice to the contrary,\n                      Contract Power will be defined as below:\n\n                      Contract Power - the highest load established under § Vl(A) above\n                      during the 12 months ending with the current month. For the initial\n                      12 months of Customer's service under the currently effective\n                      contract, the Contract Power shall be the kW specified in the\n                      currently effective contract unless exceeded in any month during the\n                      initial 12-month period.\n\n194.   The Large General Service and Large General Service-Time of Day schedules should be\n       similarly revised to eliminate ETI's life-of-contract demand ratchet.\n\n195.   In its proposed rate design for the LIPS class, the Company took a conservative approach and\n       increased the current rates by an equal percentage. This minimized customer bill impacts\n       while maintaining cost causation principles on a rate class basis.\n\n196.   It is a reasonable move towards cost of service to add a customer charge of $630 to the LIPS\n       rate schedule with subsequent increases to be considered in subsequent base rate cases.\n\n197.   It is a reasonable move towards cost of service to slightly decrease the LIPS energy charges\n       and increase the demand charges as proposed by Staff witness William B. Abbott.\n\n198.   DOE proposed a new Schedule LIPS rider-Schedule \"Schedulable Intermittent Pumping\n       Service\" (SIPS) for load schedulable at least four weeks in advance, that occurs in the off-\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE361\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n       season (November through April), that can be cancelled at any time, and for load not lasting\n       more than 80 hours in a year. For customers whose loads match these SIPS characteristics\n       (for example, DOE's Strategic Petroleum Reserve), the 12-month demand ratchet provision\n       of Schedule LIPS does not apply to demands set under the provisions of the SIPS rider. The\n       monthly demand set under the SIPS provisions would be applicable for billing purposes only\n       in the month in which it occurred. In short, if a customer set a 12-month ratchet demand in\n       that month, it would be forgiven and not applicable in the succeeding 12 months.\n\n199.   DOE' s proposed Schedule SIPS is not restricted solely to the DOE and should be adopted. It\n       more closely addresses specific customer characteristics and provides for cost-based rates, as\n       does another ETI rider applicable to Pipeline Pumping Service.\n\n200.   Standby Maintenance Service (SMS) is available to customers who have their own\n       generation equipment and who contract for this service from ETI.\n\n201.   P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.242(k)(l) provides that rates for sales of standby and maintenance\n       power to qualifying facilities should recognize system wide costing principles and should not\n       be discriminatory.\n\n202.   It is reasonable to move Schedule SMS toward cost of service by: (a) adding a customer\n       charge equivalent to that of the LIPS rate schedule only for SMS customers not purchasing\n       supplementary power under another applicable rate; and (b) revising the tariff as follows:\n\n                                        Distribution         Transmission\n                        Charge\n                                     (less than 69KV)     (69KV and greater)\n                     Billing Load Charge ($/kW):\n                     Standby            $2.46                    $0.79\n                     Maintenance        $2.27                    $0.60\n                     Non-Fuel Enernv Charge (¢/kWh)\n                     On-Peak           0.881¢                   0.846¢\n                     Off-Peak          0.575¢                   0.552¢\n\n\n203.   ETI's Additional Facilities Charge Rider (Schedule AFC) prescribes the monthly rental\n       charge paid by a customer when ETI installs facilities for that customer that would not\n       normally be supplied, such as line extensions, transformers, or dual feeds.\n\n204.   ETI existing Schedule AFC provides two pricing options. Option A is a monthly charge.\n       Option B, which applies when a customer elects to amortize the directly-assigned facilities\n       over a shorter term ranging from one to ten years, has a variable monthly charge. There is\n       also a term charge that applies after the facility has been fully depreciated.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                PAGE362\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n205.   It is reasonable and cost-based to reduce the Schedule AFC Option A rate to 1.20 percent per\n       month of the installed cost of all facilities included in the agreement for additional facilities.\n\n206.   It is reasonable and cost-based to reduce the Schedule AFC Option B monthly rate and the\n       Post Term Recovery Charge as follows:\n\n\n       Selected Recovery Term        Recovery Term Charge        Post Recovery Term Charge\n                    1                        10.88%                          0.35%\n                   2                         5.39%                           0.35%\n                   3                         3.92%                           0.35%\n                   4 '                       3.20%                           0.35%\n                   5                         2.76%                           0.35%\n                   6                         2.48%                           0.35%\n                   7                         2.28%                           0.35%\n                   8                         2.14%                           0.35%\n                   9                          1.97%                          0.35%\n                   10                         1.94%                          0.35%\n\n\n207.   The revisions in the above Findings of Fact to Schedule AFC rates reasonably reflect the\n       costs of running, operating, and maintaining the directly-assigned facilities.\n\n208.   It is reasonable to modify the Large General Service rate schedule by increasing the demand\n       charge from $10.25 to $12.81; decreasing the energy charge from $.01023 to $.00513; and\n       maintaining the customer charge at $425.05.\n\n209.   Staffs proposed change to the General Service (GS) rate schedule to gradually move GS\n       customers towards their cost of service by recommending a decrease in the customer charge\n       from the current rate of $41.09 to $39.91, and a decrease in the energy charges is reasonable\n       and should be adopted.\n\n210.   ETI's Residential Service (RS) rate schedule is composed of two elements: a customer\n       charge of $5 per month and a consumption-based energy charge. The Energy charge is a\n       fixed rate of 5.802¢ per kWh from May through October (Summer). In the months\n       November through April (Winter), the rates are structured as a declining block, in which the\n       price of each unit is reduced after a defined level of usage.\n\n211.   ETI' s Schedule RS declining block rate structure is contrary to energy efficiency efforts and\n       the Legislature's goal of reducing both energy demand and energy consumption in Texas, as\n       stated in PURA§ 39.905.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE363\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n212.   Schedule RS winter block rates should be modified consistent with the goal set out in PURA\n       § 39.905, with the initial phase-in of a 20 percent reduction in the block differential proposed\n       by ETI and subsequent reductions should be reviewed for consideration at the occurrence of\n       each rate case filing.\n\n213.   Other elements of Schedule RS are just and reasonable.\n\nFuel Reconciliation\n\n214.   ETI incurred $616,248,686 in natural-gas expenses during the Reconciliation Period, which\n       is from July 2009 through June 2011.\n\n215.   ETI purchased natural gas in the monthly and daily markets and pursuant to a long-term\n       contract with Enbridge Inc. pipeline. ETI also transported gas on its own account and\n       negotiated operational balancing agreements with various pipeline companies.\n\n216.   ETI employed a diversified portfolio of gas supply and transportation agreements to meet its\n       natural-gas requirements, and ETI prudently managed its gas-supply contracts.\n\n217.   ETI's natural gas expenses were reasonable and necessary expenses incurred to provide\n       reliable electric service to retail customers.\n\n218.   ETI incurred $90,821,317 in coal expenses during the Reconciliation Period.\n\n219.   ETI prudently managed its coal and coal-related contracts during the Reconciliation Period.\n\n220.   ETI monitored and audited coal invoices from Louisiana Generating, LLC for coal burned at\n       the Big Cajun II, Unit 3 facility.\n\n221.   ETI's coal expenses were reasonable and necessary expenses incurred to provide reliable\n       electric service to retail customers.\n\n222.   ETI incurred $990,041,434 in purchased-energy expenses during the Reconciliation Period.\n\n223.   The Entergy System's planning and procurement processes for purchased power produced a\n       reasonable mix of purchased resources at a reasonable price.\n\n224.   During the Reconciliation Period, ETI took advantage of opportunities in the fuel and\n       purchased-power markets to reduce costs and to mitigate against price volatility.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE364\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n225.   ETI's purchased-energy expenses were reasonable and necessary expenses incurred to\n       provide reliable electric service to retail customers.\n\n226.   ETI provided sufficient contemporaneous documentation to support the reasonableness of its\n       purchased-power planning and procurement processes and its actual power purchases during\n       the Reconciliation Period.\n\n227.   The Entergy system sold power off system when the revenues were expected to be more than\n       the incremental cost of supplying generation for the sale, subject to maintaining adequate\n       reserves.\n\n228.   The System Agreement is the tariff approved by the FERC that provides the basis for the\n       operation and planning of the Entergy system, including the six Operating Companies. The\n       System Agreement governs the wholesale-power transactions among the Operating\n       Companies by providing for joint operation and establishing the bases for equalization\n       among the Operating Companies, including the costs associated with the construction,\n       ownership, and operation of the Entergy system facilities.\n\n229.   Under the terms of the Entergy System Agreement, ETI was allocated its share of revenues\n       and expenses from off-system sales.\n\n230.   During the Reconciliation Period, ETI recorded off-system sales revenue in the amount of\n       $376,671,969 in FERC Account 447 and credited 100 percent of off-system sales revenues\n       and margins from off-system sales to eligible fuel expenses.\n\n231.   ETI properly recorded revenues from off-system sales and credited those revenues to eligible\n       fuel costs.\n\n232.   The Entergy system consists of six Operating Companies, including ETI, which are planned\n       and operated as a single, integrated electric system under the terms of the System Agreement.\n\n233.   Service Schedule MSS-1 of the System Agreement determines how the capability and\n       ownership costs of reserves for the Entergy system are equalized among the Operating\n       Companies. These inter-system \"reserve equalization\" payments are the result of a formula\n       rate related to the Entergy system's reserve capability that is applied on a monthly basis.\n\n234.   Reserve capability under Service Schedule MSS-1 is capability in excess of the Entergy\n       system's actual or planned load built or acquired to ensure the reliable, efficient operation of\n       the electric system.\n\fSOAHDOCKETNO.-                         PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE365\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n235.   By approving Service Schedule MSS-1, the FERC has approved the method by which the\n       Operating Companies share the cost of maintaining sufficient reserves to provide reliability\n       for the Entergy system as a whole.\n\n236.   Service Schedule MSS-3 of the System Agreement determines the pricing and exchange of\n       energy among the Operating Companies. By approving Service Schedule MSS-3, the FERC\n       has approved the method by which the Operating Companies are reimbursed for energy sold\n       to the exchange energy pool and how that energy is purchased.\n\n237.   Service Schedule MSS-4 of the System Agreement sets forth the method for determining the\n       payment for unit power purchases between Operating Companies. By approving Service\n       Schedule MSS-4, the FERC has approved the methodology for pricing Inter-Operating\n       Company unit power purchases.\n\n238.   The Entergy system is planned using multi-year, annual, seasonal, monthly, and next-day\n       horizons. Once the planning process has identified the most economical resources that can\n       be used to reliably meet the aggregate Entergy system demand, the next step is to procure the\n       fuel necessary to operate the generating units as planned and acquire wholesale power from\n       the market.\n\n239.   Once resources are procured to meet forecasted load, the Entergy system is operated during\n       the current day using all the resources available to meet the total Entergy system demand.\n\n240.   After current-day operation, the System Agreement prescribes an accounting protocol to bill\n       the costs of operating the system to the individual Operating Companies. This protocol is\n       implemented via the Intra-System Bill (ISB) to each Operating Company on a monthly basis.\n\n241.   ETI purchased power from affiliated Operating Companies per the terms of Service\n       Schedule MSS-3 of the System Agreement. The payments made under Schedule MSS-3 to\n       affiliated Operating Companies are reasonable and necessary, and the FERC has approved\n       the pricing formula and the obligation to purchase the energy. ETI pays the same price per\n       megawatt hour for energy under Service Schedule MSS-3 as does any other Operating\n       Company purchasing energy under Service Schedule MSS-3 during the same hour.\n\n242.   The Spindletop Facility is used primarily to ensure gas-supply reliability and guard against\n       gas-supply curtailments that can occur as a result of extreme weather or other unusual events.\n\n243.   The Spindletop Facility provides a secondary benefit of flexibility in gas supply. ETI can\n       back down gas-fired generation to take advantage of more economical wholesale power, or\n       use gas from storage to supplement gas-fired generation when load increases during the day\n       and thereby avoid more expensive intra-day gas purchases.\n\fSOAHDOCKET N O . -                     PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE366\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n244.   ETI' s customers received benefits from the Spindletop Facility during the Reconciliation\n       Period through reliable gas supplies and ETI's monthly and daily storage activity.\n\n245.   ETI prudently managed the Spindletop Facility to provide reliability and flexibility of gas\n       supply for the benefit of customers.\n\n246.   ETI proposed new loss factors, based on a December 2010 line loss study, to be applied for\n       the purpose of allocating its costs to its wholesale customers and retail customer classes.\n\n247.   ETI's proposed loss factors are reasonable and shall be implemented on a prospective basis\n       as a result of this final order.\n\n248.   ETI seeks a special-circumstances exception to recover $99,715 resulting from the FERC's\n       reallocation of rough production equalization costs in FERC Order No. 720-A, and to treat\n       such costs as eligible fuel expense.\n\n249.   Special circumstances exist and it is appropriate for recovery of the rough production cost\n       equalization costs reallocated to ETI as a result of the FERC' s decision in Order No. 720-A.\n\nOther Issues\n\n250.   A deferred accounting of ETI' s Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator (MISO)\n       transition expenses is not necessary to carry out any requirement of PURA.\n\n251.   ETI should include $2.4 million in base rates for MISO transition expense incurred on or\n       after January 2, 2011, based on a five-year amortization of $12 million in total projected\n       expenses.\n\n252.   ETI should include an additional $52,800 in base rates for MISO transition expenses incurred\n       during the 2010 portion of the Test Year, based on a five-year amortization of $263,908 in\n       such expenses.\n\n253.   Transmission Cost Recovery Factor baseline values should be set during the compliance\n       phase of this docket, after the Commission makes final rulings on the various contested\n       issues that may affect this calculation.\n\n254.   Distribution Cost Recovery Factor baseline values should be set during the compliance phase\n       of this docket, after the Commission makes final rulings on the various contested issues that\n       may affect this calculation.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                      PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE367\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n25 5.   The appropriate amount for ETI' s purchased power capacity expense to be included in base\n        rates is $245,432,884.\n\n256.     The amount of ETI's purchased power capacity expense includes third-party contracts,\n        legacy affiliate contracts, other affiliate contracts, and reserve equalization. Whether the\n        amounts for all contracts should be included in the baseline for a purchased capacity rider\n        that may be approved in Project No. 39246 is an issue that should be decided in that project.\n\nB.      Conclusions of Law\n\n1.      ETI is a \"public utility\" as that term is defined in PURA § 11.004( 1) and an \"electric utility\"\n        as that term is defined in PURA§ 31.002(6).\n\n2.      The Commission exercises regulatory authority over ETI and jurisdiction over the subject\n        matter of this application pursuant to PURA §§ 14.001, 32.001, 32.101, 33.002, 33.051,\n        36.101-.111, and 36.203.\n\n3.      SOAH has jurisdiction over matters related to the conduct of the hearing and the preparation\n        of a proposal for decision in this docket, pursuant to PURA§ 14.053 and TEX. GOY'TCODE\n        ANN. § 2003.049.\n\n4.      This docket was processed in accordance with the requirements of PURA and the Texas\n        Administrative Procedure Act, TEX. Gov'T CODE ANN. Chapter 2001.\n\n5.      ETI provided notice of its application in compliance with PURA§ 36.103, P.U.C. PROC.\n        R. 22.51(a), and P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.235(b)(l)-(3).\n\n6.      Pursuant to PURA § 33.001, each municipality in ETI's service area that has not ceded\n        jurisdiction to the Commission has jurisdiction over the Company's application, which seeks\n        to change rates for distribution services within each municipality.\n\n7.      Pursuant to PURA § 33.051, the Commission has jurisdiction over an appeal from a\n        municipality's rate proceeding.\n\n8.      ETI has the burden of proving that the rate change it is requesting is just and reasonable\n        pursuant to PURA § 36.006.\n\n9.      In compliance with PURA§ 36.051, ETI's overall revenues approved in this proceeding\n        permit ETI a reasonable opportunity to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital used\n        and useful in providing service to the public in excess of its reasonable and necessary\n        operating expenses.\n\f                                                                                      ----------------\n\n\n\nSOAH DOCKET N O . -                   PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE368\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n10.   Consistent with PURA § 36.053, the rates approved in this proceeding are based on original\n      cost, less depreciation, of property used and useful to ETI in providing service.\n\n11.   The ADFIT adjustments approved in this proceeding are consistent with PURA§ 36.059 and\n      P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.23l(c)(2)(C)(i).\n\n12.   Including the cash working capital approved in this proceeding in ETI's rate base is\n      consistent with P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.23l(c)(2)(B)(iii)(IV), which allows a reasonable\n      allowance for cash working capital to be included in rate base.\n\n13.   The ROE and overall rate of return authorized in this proceeding are consistent with the\n      requirements of PURA §§ 36.051 and 36.052.\n\n14.   The affiliate expenses approved in this proceeding and included in ETI's rates meet the\n      affiliate payment standards articulated in PURA §§ 36.051, 36.058, and Railroad\n      Commission of Texas v. Rio Grande Valley Gas Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1755307\"><a href=\"/opinion/1755307/rr-comn-of-texas-v-rio-grande-valley-gas/\"><span class=\"volume\">683</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">783</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.

Pursuant to P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.231(b)(l)(F), the decommissioning expense approved in\n      this case is based on the most current information reasonably available regarding the cost of\n      decommissioning, the balance of funds in the decommissioning trust, anticipated escalation\n      rates, the anticipated return on the funds in the decommissioning trust, and other relevant\n      factors.\n\n17.   ETI has demonstrated that its eligible fuel expenses during the Reconciliation Period were\n      reasonable and necessary expenses incurred to provide reliable electric service to retail\n      customers as required by P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.236(d)(l)(A). ETihas properly accounted for\n      the amount of fuel-related revenues collected pursuant to the fuel factor during the\n      Reconciliation Period as required by P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.236(d)(l)(C).\n\n18.   ETI prudently managed the dispatch, operations, and maintenance of its fossil plants during\n      the Reconciliation Period.\n\n19.   The Reconciliation Period level operating and maintenance expenses for the Spindletop\n      Facility are eligible fuel expenses pursuant to P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.236(a).\n\n20.   Special circumstances are warranted pursuant to P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.236(a)(6) to recover\n      rough production equalization payments reallocated to ETI by the FERC.\n\fSOAR DOCKET N O . -                      PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                                 PAGE369\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n21.    ETI' s rates, as approved in this proceeding, are just and reasonable in accordance with PURA\n       § 36.003.\n\nC.     Proposed Ordering Paragraphs\n\n       In accordance with these findings of fact and conclusions of law, the Commission issues the\nfollowing orders:\n\n\n1.     The Proposal for Decision prepared by the SOAH ALls is adopted to the extent consistent\n       with this Order.\n\n2.     ETI' s application is granted to the extent consistent with this Order.\n\n3.     ETI shall file tariffs consistent with this Order within 20 days of the date of this Order. No\n       later than ten days after the date of the tariff filings, Staff shall file its comments\n       recommending approval, modification, or rejection of the individual sheets of the tariff\n       proposal. Responses to the Staffs recommendation shall be filed no later than 15 days after\n       the filing of the tariff. The Commission shall by letter approve, modify, or reject each tariff\n       sheet, effective the date of the letter.\n\n4.     The tariff sheets shall be deemed approved and shall be become effective on the expiration of\n       20 days from the date of filing, in the absence of written notification of modification or\n       rejection by the Commission. If any sheets are modified or rejected, ETI shall file proposed\n       revisions of those sheets in accordance with the Commission's letter within ten days of the\n       date of that letter, and the review procedure set out above shall apply to the revised sheets.\n\n5.     Copies of all tariff-related filings shall be served on all parties of record.\n\n6.     ETI shall prepare and file as part of its next base rate case a study regarding the feasibility of\n       instituting LED-based rates and, if the study shows that such rates are feasible, ETI should\n       file proposals for LED-based lighting and traffic signal rates in that case. If ETI has LED\n       lighting customers taking service, the study shall include detailed information regarding\n       differences in the cost of serving LED and non-LED lighting customers. ETI shall provide\n       the results of this study to Cities and interested parties as soon as practicable but no later than\n       the filing of its next rate case.\n\fSOAH DOCKET N O . -                  PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                               PAGE370\nPUC DOCKET NO. 39896\n\n\n7.

Considered in light of (1) the pre-filed testimony by the parties entered into evidence and\n       (2) the additional evidence and testimony admitted during the course of the hearing on\n       the merits on the Company's application, the stipulation is the result of compromise from\n       each signatory, and these efforts, as well as the overall result of the stipulation viewed in\n       light of the record evidence as a whole, support the reasonableness and benefits of the\n       terms of the stipulation.\n\fPUC D()(ket No. 37744                          Order                                      Page 11of15\nSOAH D()(ket No.\n\n\n35.    The evidence addressed in finding of fact 34 demonstrates that the rates, tenns, and\n       conditions resulting from the stipulation are just and reasonable and consistent with the\n       public interest.\n\n36.    The total level of the Texas retail revenue requirement contemplated by the stipulation\n       will allow ETI the opportunity to earn a reasonable return over and above its reasonable\n       and necessary operating expense.\n\n37.    The stipulated revenue requirement is consistent with applicable provisions of PURA\n       chapter 36 and the Commission's rules.\n\n38.    To the extent that affiliate costs are included in the stipulated revenue requirement and\n        fuel expense, they are reasonable and necessary for each class of affiliate costs presented\n        in ETI's application.\n\n39.    To the extent that affiliate costs are included in the stipulated revenue requirement and\n        fuel expense, the price charged to ETI is not higher than the prices charged by the\n       supplying affiliate for the same item or class of items to its other affiliates or divisions, or\n       a non-affiliated person within the same market area or having the same market\n       conditions.\n\n40.    The retail revenue requirement in the stipulation does not include any expenses\n       prohibited from recovery under PURA.\n\n41 .   A return on equity of 10.125% and a weighted average cost of capital of 8.5209% for ETI\n       should be adopted consistent with the stipulation.\n\n42.    The agreed rate-design provisions and terms and conditions of service included in the\n       stipulation are just and reasonable.\n\n43.    The treatment of rate-case expenses described in the stipulation is reasonable.\n\n44.    The Company's proposed remote-communications-link: rider as filed by the Company\n        is reasonable.\n\n45.    The depreciation rates agreed to in the stipulation are just and reasonable.\n\fPUC Docket No. 37744                              Order                               Page 12of15\nSOAH Docket No\n\n\n46.    The recovery of $2,019,000 annually for decommissioning costs of nuclear production\n       assets based on the factors agreed to in the stipulation is reasonable.\n\n47.    A $3.65 million annual storm cost accrual is reasonable.\n\n48.    The class allocation methodologies described in the stipulation are just and reasonable.\n\n49.    The fuel and lPCR-related provisions of the stipulation are reasonable.\n\n\n                                     ll.     Conclusions of Law\n1.     ETI is a public utility as that term is defined in PURA § 11.004( l) and an electric utility\n       as that term is defined in PURA§ 31 .002(6).\n\n2.     The Commission exercises regulatory authority over ETI and jurisdiction over the subject\n       matter of this application pursuant to PURA§§ 14.001, 32.001, 32.101 , 33.002, 33.051,\n       36.001- .111, 36.203, 39.452, and 39.455.\n\n3.     SOAH has jurisdiction over matters related to the conduct of the hearing and the\n       preparation of a proposal for decision in this docket, pursuant to PURA § 14.053 and\n       TEX. Gov'T CODE ANN. § 2003.049.\n\n4.     This docket was processed in accordance with the requirements of PURA, the Texas\n       Administrative Procedure Act,8 and Commission rules.\n\n5.     ETC provided notice of its application in compliance with PURA§ 36.103, P.U.C. PROC.\n       R. 22.5l(a), and P.U.C.     SUBST.   R. 25.235(b)(l)-(3).\n\n6.     This docket contains no remaining contested issues of fact or law.\n\n7.     The stipulation, taken as a whole, is a just and reasonable resolution of all issues it\n       addresses; results in just and reasonable rates, terms, and conditions; is supported by a\n       preponderance of the credible evidence in the record; is consistent with the relevant\n       provisions of PURA; and is consistent with the public interest.\n\n8.     ETI has properly accounted for the amount of fuel and IPCR-related revenues collected\n       pursuant to the fuel factor and Rider lPCR.\n\n\n       8\n           TEX. Gov'T CODE ANN. Chapter 2001 (Vernon 2007 and Supp. 2009).\n\fPUC Docket No. 37744                           Order                                  Page 13 of IS\nSOAH Docket No.\n\n\n9.     The revenue requirement, cost allocation, revenue distribution, and rate design\n       implementing the stipulation result in rates that are just and reasonable, comply with the\n       ratemaking provisions in PURA, and are not unreasonably discriminatory, preferential, or\n       prejudicial.\n\n10.    Based on the evidence in this docket, the overall total invested capital through the end of\n       the test year meets the requirement in PURA § 36.053(a) that electric utility rates be\n       based on the original cost, less depreciation, of property used by and useful to the utility\n       in providing service.\n\n11.    ETI has met its burden of proof in demonstrating that it is entitled to the level of retail\n       base rate and rider revenue set out in the stipulation.\n\n12.    ETI has met its burden of proof in demonstrating that the rates resulting from the\n       stipulation are just and reasonable, and consistent with PURA.\n\n\n                                 III.    Ordering Paragraphs\nl.     ETI's application seeking authority to change its rates; reconcile its fuel and purchased\n       power costs for the Reconciliation Period from April 1, 2007 to June 30, 2009; and for\n       other related relief is approved consistent with the above findings of fact and conclusions\n       of law.\n\n2.     Rates, terms, and conditions consistent with the stipulation are approved.\n\n3.     The tariffs and riders consistent with the stipulation are approved for the initial and\n       second step rate increases.\n\n4.     ETI's request for waivers of RFP instructions (RFP Schedule V) is granted.\n\n5.     ETI shall adjust decommissioning expense related to the River Bend Nuclear Generating\n       Station consistent with the terms of this Order.\n\n6.     Neither the stipulation and settlement agreement nor this Order constitutes the\n       Commission's agreement with, or consent to, the manner in which ETI, or any entity\n       affiliated with ETI, has interacted with any decommissioning trust to which ETI or its\n       ratepayers have made contributions or provided funds. Furthermore, this Order in no\n\fPUC Docket No. 37744                           Order                                   Page 14 of IS\nSOAH Docket No.-\n\n\n       way constitutes a waiver or release of any conduct, whether or not such conduct occurred\n       before the date of this Order, that may constitute a violation of any provision of state law,\n       including, without limitation, the rules and regulations of this Commission relating to\n       nuclear decommissioning trust funds; or prevents the Staff of the Commission from\n       opening an investigation and taking enforcement action relating to violations of such\n       rules and regulations.\n\n7.     Nothing contained in this Order constitutes the consent or approval, explicit or implied,\n       of any modification, amendment or clarification of any power purchase             agr~ement\n\n       between ETI and any other Entergy entity relating to the River Bend Station. Without\n       limiting the foregoing, nothing contained in this Order shall constitute the consent or\n       approval of any modification, amendment, or clarification of any power purchase\n       agreement between ETI and any other Entergy entity relating to the River Bend Station,\n       which is made to address any concerns raised by the NRC in its Request for Additional\n       Infonnation regarding the River Bend Station dated March 11 , 2010.\n\n8.     The Rider IPCR costs and eligible fuel costs requested by ETI are, consistent with this\n       Order, reconciled through June 30, 2009, and are approved consistent with the\n       stipulation.\n\n9.     ETI shall adjust its fuel over/under recovery balance consistent with the findings in this\n       Order.\n\nI 0.   ETI shall file an RPCEA Rider consistent with the above findings of fact and conclusions\n       of law to be effective with the first billing cycle of the billing month immediately\n       following the effective date of this Order ..\n\n11.    Because the final approved r~tes are equal to or higher than the interim rates adopted in\n       Order No. 3, no refund of the interim rates authorized by Order No. 3 is necessary.\n\n12.    The interim rates approved in Order No. 12 are herby approved for the initial step rate\n       increase contemplated by the stipulation, and ETI shall implement the second step rates\n       for bills rendered on and after May 2, 20 11, the first billing cycle for the revenue month\n       of May.\n\fPUC Docket No. 37744                                 Order                                Page 15of15\nSOAH Docket No. ~\n\n\n13.
