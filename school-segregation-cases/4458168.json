(CR1 106-136). None of\n\nthese causes of action provided for an award of attorney's fees, and the summary\n\njudgment did not grant any motion for declaratory relief or award any attorney's\n\nfees.\n\n4       On August 7, 2014, Judge Larry Noll signed an Order Granting Partial\n\nSummary Judgment, which decreed that Coffeehouse owned 25% and Marcus\n\nRogers, as interim trustee of ATFL&L, owned 75% of the subject property\n\nincluding real estate and partnership known as 5321 Broadway Partners. The\n\nOrder also decreed that the remaining Defendants did not own any interest in the\n\nProperty or the Partnership. Finally, the Order decreed that the Property be sold in\n\na manner to be determined by the Court. (CR2 369-372). The summary judgment\n\n                                        2\n\fwas incorporated into the Judgment. (CR2 437-443).\n\n5     All of the summary judgment relief was based on Broadway Coffeehouse's\n\nsuit to quiet title, suit for termination and winding up of the partnership, and suit\n\nfor partition. None of the summary judgment relief was based on any claim for\n\ndeclaratory judgment, which was not requested.\n\n6     Marcus Rogers, as Trustee for the Saks Children Trust, neither sought nor\n\nwas granted partial summary judgment. Marcus Rogers, as Trustee, filed his\n\ncross-claim after partial summary judgment. (CR2 373-374).\n\n7     Neither Broadway Coffeehouse nor Marcus Rogers, as Trustee for the Saks\n\nChildren Trust, sought or were granted damages. (CR2 437-443).\n\n8     Neither Broadway Coffeehouse nor Marcus Rogers, as Trustee for the Saks\n\nChildren Trust, sought or were granted summary judgment relief under the\n\nUniform Declaratory Judgment Act (“UDJA”). (CR2 369-372).\n\n9     The Movants did not file counterclaims or seek affirmative relief. (CR1 64-\n\n67, 72-75).\n\n10    The Judgment of the trial court expressly granted the partial summary\n\njudgment relief and awarded attorney's fees to Broadway Coffeehouse and Marcus\n\nRogers, as Trustee for the Saks Children Trust, but it did not expressly grant relief\n\nunder the UDJA. The Judgment of the trial court denied all relief not expressly\n\n                                         3\n\fgranted. (CR2 437-443).\n\n                                        Argument\n\n         Movants assert that the trial court Judgment, which was affirmed by this\n\nCourt, awarded attorney's fees in error without citing any legal authority for such\n\naward. Neither the summary judgment nor the final judgment expressly granted a\n\ndeclaratory judgment, which was the only arguable basis for an award of attorney's\n\nfees.\n\n        Generally, a party may not recover attorney's fees unless authorized by statute\n\nor contract. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Murphy, 458 S.W.3d 912, 915 (Tex. 2015).\n\nBroadway Coffeehouse's amended petition and Marcus Rogers, Trustee's cross-\n\nclaim claimed an award of attorney's fees pursuant to TCP&RC Section 37.009.\n\n         Movants submit that this case is a suit to quiet title, partition real estate and\n\nterminate and wind up a partnership, for which attorney's fees are not recoverable.\n\nHowever, Coffeehouse and Marcus Rogers, Trustee, improperly asserted a\n\nsuperfluous claim under the Declaratory Judgment Act solely as a vehicle for\n\nclaiming attorney's fees after Coffeehouse received a partial summary judgment,\n\nnot including its claim for declaratory judgment. The partial summary judgment\n\nwas not a final order. See gen. Lehmann v. Harbour Title Company, 39 S.W.3d 91\n\n(Tex. 2001).\n\n                                             4\n\f      Neither Coffeehouse nor Marcus Rogers, Trustee, requested declaratory\n\nrelief in the motion for partial summary judgment or the final judgment. Then,\n\nboth parties claimed awards of attorney's fees without stating any basis. Likewise,\n\nthe final judgment awarded attorney's fees without stating a basis.\n\n      The Declaratory Judgment Act “provides an efficient vehicle for parties to\n\nseek a declaration of rights under certain instruments.” I-10 Colony, Inc. v. Lee,\n\n393 S.W.3d 467, 475 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2013, pet filed). A party may\n\nnot artfully plead a title dispute as a declaratory judgment action. Id.\n\n      In 2009, the Texas Supreme Court stated as follows: “Yet while declaratory\n\nrelief may be obtained under the Act in all these circumstances, that does not mean\n\nattorney's fees can too. Texas has long followed the \" American Rule\" prohibiting\n\nfee awards unless specifically provided by contract or statute. By contrast, the\n\nDeclaratory Judgments Act allows fee awards to either party in all cases. If\n\nrepleading a claim as a declaratory judgment could justify a fee award, attorney's\n\nfees would be available for all parties in all cases. That would repeal not only the\n\nAmerican Rule but also the limits imposed on fee awards in other statutes.\n\nAccordingly, the rule is that a party cannot use the Act as a vehicle to obtain\n\notherwise impermissible attorney's fees.” MBM Financial Corporation v. The\n\nWoodlands Operating Company, L.P. 292 S.W.3d 660, 669 (Tex. 2009).\n\n                                          5\n\f      “The Act was originally \" intended as a speedy and effective remedy\" for\n\nsettling disputes before substantial damages were incurred. It is \" intended to\n\nprovide a remedy that is simpler and less harsh than coercive relief, if it appears\n\nthat a declaration might terminate the potential controversy.\" But when a claim for\n\ndeclaratory relief is merely tacked onto a standard suit based on a matured breach\n\nof contract, allowing fees under Chapter 37 would frustrate the limits Chapter 38\n\nimposes on such fee recoveries. And granting fees under Chapter 37 when they are\n\nnot permitted under the specific common-law or statutory claims involved would\n\nviolate the rule that specific provisions should prevail over general ones. While\n\nthe Legislature intended the Act to be remedial, it did not intend to supplant all\n\nother statutes and remedies.” Id., at 670.\n\n        In the instant case, as in the Woodlands case, the plaintiff recovered no\n\ndamages on its claims, so it could not recover attorney's fees under the American\n\nRule. Allowing it to recover the same fees under Chapter 37 would frustrate the\n\nprovisions and limitations of the American Rule. Accordingly, Broadway\n\nCoffeehouse and Marcus Rogers, as Trustee for the Saks Children Trust, cannot\n\nrecover attorney's fees under the Declaratory Judgments Act. Id.\n\n      Movants submit that Broadway Coffeehouse's amended motion for partial\n\nsummary judgment did not request a declaratory judgment, and neither the Order\n\n                                             6\n\fGranting Partial Summary Judgment nor the Judgment addressed the cause of\n\naction for declaratory judgment. Summary judgment cannot be granted except on\n\nthe grounds expressly presented in the motion. Stephens and Johnson Operating\n\nCo. v. Schroeder, No. 04-14-00167-CV (Civ.App. - San Antonio August 2015)\n\nciting TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c) (\"The motion for summary judgment shall state the\n\nspecific grounds therefor.\"); Sci. Spectrum, Inc. v. Martinez, 941 S.W.2d 910, 912\n\n(Tex. 1997); McConnell, 858 S.W.2d at 341 (Tex. 1993). In determining whether\n\ngrounds are expressly presented, reliance may not be placed on the briefs or\n\nsummary judgment evidence. Stephens and Johnson Operating Co. v. Schroeder,\n\nsupra, citing McConnell v. Southside Indep. Sch. Dist., 858 S.W.2d 337 at 341\n\n(Tex. 1993); Torres v. Garcia, No. 04-11-00822-CV, 2012 WL 3808593, at *5\n\n(Tex. App.—San Antonio 2012, no pet.) (mem. op.). Accordingly, \"[s]pecific\n\ngrounds for summary judgment must be expressly stated in the motion for\n\nsummary judgment itself and not ... in the summary judgment evidence....\"\n\nMcConnell, 858 S.W.2d, supra, at 344; Torres, 2012 WL 3808593, supra, at *5.\n\nTherefore, a party's request for attorney fees and the grounds supporting this\n\nrequest must be expressly statedin the motion before a court may award summary\n\njudgment on the stated grounds. McConnell, 858 S.W.2d, supra, at 341; Torres,\n\n2012 WL 3808593, supra, at *5.\n\n                                       7\n\f      Review of the Coffeehouse and Rogers, Trustee, parties' motion for\n\nsummary judgment and supplemental motion for summary judgment reveal there\n\nis no request for, or statement of any ground for, declaratory judgment or the\n\nrecovery of attorneys' fees. The motions are completely silent on the issue and\n\naddress only the request to quiet title, terminate and wind up of the partnership,\n\nand for partition relief. Therefore, Appellants submit that this Court erred in\n\nfinding a basis for awarding attorney's fees to Coffeehouse and Marcus Rogers,\n\nTrustee. Stephens & Johnson Operating Co. v. Schroeder, supra at 13.\n\n      Movants submit that the cause of action for declaratory judgment was not an\n\nindependent claim for affirmative relief because Broadway Coffeehouse and\n\nMarcus Rogers, as Trustee's declaratory judgment claims did not include any\n\nsubstantial relief that was not recoverable under the causes of action to quiet title,\n\nfor partition of real property, and for termination of the partnership. Instead,\n\nCoffeehouse and Marcus Rogers, Trustee asserted their declaratory judgment\n\ncauses of action as a ploy to recover attorney's fees. It is improper to use the\n\nDeclaratory Judgment Act to settle a land title dispute and seek an award of\n\nattorney's fees. Bardfield v. Holland, 844 S.W.2d 759, 771 (Tex.App.-Tyler 1992,\n\nwrit den.).\n\n      The Declaratory Judgment Act cannot be coupled with another action for\n\n                                         8\n\fthe sole purpose of seeking attorney's fees not otherwise available. Aaron Rents,\n\nInc. v. Travis Central Appraisal Dist., 212 S.W.3d 665 (Tex.App.-Austin 2006, no\n\npet.) (relief denied where the requested declaratory relief was redundant to the\n\nrelief sought under the tax code, with the exception of a request for attorney's\n\nfees); Cytogenix, Inc., v. Waldroff, 213 S.W.3d 479, 490 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st\n\nDist.] 2006, no pet.) (finding that a trial court abuses its discretion in awarding\n\nattorney's fees under the UDJA if the claim for declaratory relief is brought solely\n\nfor the purpose of obtaining attorney's fees).\n\n      Additionally and alternatively, the Judgment did not expressly grant\n\nCoffeehouse or Marcus Rogers, Trustee's requested declaratory judgment or any\n\nrelief pursuant to TCP&RC Section 37.009. To wit, the Judgment does not even\n\nmention Coffeehouse and Marcus Rogers, Trustee's requests for a declaratory\n\njudgment or make any express findings as to declaratory relief as an independent\n\ncause of action. Movants submit that Coffeehouse and Marcus Rogers, Trustee\n\nmay not recover attorney's fees pursuant to TCP&RC Section 37.009 because they\n\ndid not claim an independent cause of action for declaratory judgment that was\n\ngranted. Morton v Timarron Owners Association, Inc., No. 02-13-00409-CV\n\n(Civ.App. - Fort Worth [Second District] June 12, 2014).\n\n      The Judgment of the trial court states that “[A]ll relief requested by any\n\n                                          9\n\fparty and not expressly granted herein is hereby denied. This is intended to be a\n\nfinal, appealable judgment which disposes of all claims and parties.” Therefore,\n\nMovants submit that because the Judgment did not expressly grant a declaratory\n\njudgment, and it stated that all relief requested by a party and not expressly\n\ngranted was denied, the Judgment denied Broadway Coffeehouse and Marcus\n\nRogers, as Trustee's requests for declaratory judgment. As a result, there was no\n\nstatutory basis for an award of attorney's fees, and the trial court awarded\n\nattorney's fees to Coffeehouse and Marcus Rogers, Trustee, in error.\n\n      Additionally and alternatively, Movants submit that Broadsay Coffeehouse\n\nand Marcus Rogers, as Trustee, did not segregate their fees among the various\n\ncauses of action for suit to quiet title, declaratory judgment, permanent injunction,\n\nsuit for termination and winding-up of the partnership, and partition. To wit,\n\nBroadway Coffeehouse's attorney testified that she did not attempt to segregate her\n\nfees among the various causes of action or allocate the fees among the various\n\nDefendants.    [RR1 24, lines 16-25, page 25, lines 1-5]        Therefore, Movants\n\nrespectfully submit that it was an abuse of discretion for the trial court to award of\n\nattorney fees based on unsegregated fees under the facts and circumstances of this\n\ncase. Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 314 (Tex. 2006).\n\n      Furthermore, Broadway Coffeehouse did not allocate its fees among the\n\n                                         10\n\fvarious Defendants regarding fees that were not segregated by time spent on the\n\ncauses of action including suit to quiet title, declaratory judgment, permanent\n\ninjunction, suit for termination and winding-up of the partnership, and partition.\n\n      Therefore, Movants respectfully submit that Coffeehouse and Marcus\n\nRogers, as Trustee, should not have been awarded attorney's fees because they\n\nfailed to plead an independent cause of action for declaratory judgment, and the\n\nJudgment did not expressly grant a declaratory judgment.              Alternatively,\n\nBroadway Coffeehouse and Marcus Rogers, as Trustee, failed to segregate or\n\nallocate its fees among the various claims and parties. A trial court may not take\n\njudicial notice of the attorney fees under section 37.009. Dickey v. McComb Dev.\n\nCo., 115 S.W.3d 42, 46 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 2003, no pet.) (holding that when\n\na claim for fees does not fall under Section 38.001 of the Texas Civil Practice and\n\nRemedies Codes, the trial court may not take judicial notice of attorney fees).\n\n                         CONCLUSION AND PRAYER\n\n      WHEREFORE, Movants respectfully request rehearing en banc on the issue\n\nof attorney's fees pursuant to TRAP Rule 49. Movants request the Court to set\n\naside its Judgment and reverse the trial court Judgment awarding attorney's fees.\n\nMovants also request such further relief to which they may be justly entitled.\n\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\f                                      Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                      /s/ Philip M.

(CR1 106-136). None of\n\nthese causes of action provided for an award of attorney's fees, and the summary\n\njudgment did not grant any motion for declaratory relief or award any attorney's\n\nfees.\n\n4       On August 7, 2014, Judge Larry Noll signed an Order Granting Partial\n\nSummary Judgment, which decreed that Coffeehouse owned 25% and Marcus\n\nRogers, as interim trustee of ATFL&L, owned 75% of the subject property\n\nincluding real estate and partnership known as 5321 Broadway Partners. The\n\nOrder also decreed that the remaining Defendants did not own any interest in the\n\nProperty or the Partnership. Finally, the Order decreed that the Property be sold in\n\na manner to be determined by the Court. (CR2 369-372). The summary judgment\n\n                                        2\n\fwas incorporated into the Judgment. (CR2 437-443).\n\n5     All of the summary judgment relief was based on Broadway Coffeehouse's\n\nsuit to quiet title, suit for termination and winding up of the partnership, and suit\n\nfor partition. None of the summary judgment relief was based on any claim for\n\ndeclaratory judgment, which was not requested.\n\n6     Marcus Rogers, as Trustee for the Saks Children Trust, neither sought nor\n\nwas granted partial summary judgment. Marcus Rogers, as Trustee, filed his\n\ncross-claim after partial summary judgment. (CR2 373-374).\n\n7     Neither Broadway Coffeehouse nor Marcus Rogers, as Trustee for the Saks\n\nChildren Trust, sought or were granted damages. (CR2 437-443).\n\n8     Neither Broadway Coffeehouse nor Marcus Rogers, as Trustee for the Saks\n\nChildren Trust, sought or were granted summary judgment relief under the\n\nUniform Declaratory Judgment Act (“UDJA”). (CR2 369-372).\n\n9     The Movants did not file counterclaims or seek affirmative relief. (CR1 64-\n\n67, 72-75).\n\n10    The Judgment of the trial court expressly granted the partial summary\n\njudgment relief and awarded attorney's fees to Broadway Coffeehouse and Marcus\n\nRogers, as Trustee for the Saks Children Trust, but it did not expressly grant relief\n\nunder the UDJA. The Judgment of the trial court denied all relief not expressly\n\n                                         3\n\fgranted. (CR2 437-443).\n\n                                        Argument\n\n         Movants assert that the trial court Judgment, which was affirmed by this\n\nCourt, awarded attorney's fees in error without citing any legal authority for such\n\naward. Neither the summary judgment nor the final judgment expressly granted a\n\ndeclaratory judgment, which was the only arguable basis for an award of attorney's\n\nfees.\n\n        Generally, a party may not recover attorney's fees unless authorized by statute\n\nor contract.

The partial summary judgment\n\nwas not a final order. See gen. Lehmann v.

Then,\n\nboth parties claimed awards of attorney's fees without stating any basis. Likewise,\n\nthe final judgment awarded attorney's fees without stating a basis.\n\n      The Declaratory Judgment Act “provides an efficient vehicle for parties to\n\nseek a declaration of rights under certain instruments.” I-10 Colony, Inc. v.

A party may\n\nnot artfully plead a title dispute as a declaratory judgment action. Id.\n\n      In 2009, the Texas Supreme Court stated as follows: “Yet while declaratory\n\nrelief may be obtained under the Act in all these circumstances, that does not mean\n\nattorney's fees can too. Texas has long followed the \" American Rule\" prohibiting\n\nfee awards unless specifically provided by contract or statute. By contrast, the\n\nDeclaratory Judgments Act allows fee awards to either party in all cases. If\n\nrepleading a claim as a declaratory judgment could justify a fee award, attorney's\n\nfees would be available for all parties in all cases. That would repeal not only the\n\nAmerican Rule but also the limits imposed on fee awards in other statutes.\n\nAccordingly, the rule is that a party cannot use the Act as a vehicle to obtain\n\notherwise impermissible attorney's fees.” MBM Financial Corporation v. The\n\nWoodlands Operating Company, L.P. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">660</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 669 (Tex. 2009).\n\n                                          5\n\f      “The Act was originally \" intended as a speedy and effective remedy\" for\n\nsettling disputes before substantial damages were incurred. It is \" intended to\n\nprovide a remedy that is simpler and less harsh than coercive relief, if it appears\n\nthat a declaration might terminate the potential controversy.\" But when a claim for\n\ndeclaratory relief is merely tacked onto a standard suit based on a matured breach\n\nof contract, allowing fees under Chapter 37 would frustrate the limits Chapter 38\n\nimposes on such fee recoveries. And granting fees under Chapter 37 when they are\n\nnot permitted under the specific common-law or statutory claims involved would\n\nviolate the rule that specific provisions should prevail over general ones. While\n\nthe Legislature intended the Act to be remedial, it did not intend to supplant all\n\nother statutes and remedies.” Id., at 670.\n\n        In the instant case, as in the Woodlands case, the plaintiff recovered no\n\ndamages on its claims, so it could not recover attorney's fees under the American\n\nRule. Allowing it to recover the same fees under Chapter 37 would frustrate the\n\nprovisions and limitations of the American Rule. Accordingly, Broadway\n\nCoffeehouse and Marcus Rogers, as Trustee for the Saks Children Trust, cannot\n\nrecover attorney's fees under the Declaratory Judgments Act. Id.\n\n      Movants submit that Broadway Coffeehouse's amended motion for partial\n\nsummary judgment did not request a declaratory judgment, and neither the Order\n\n                                             6\n\fGranting Partial Summary Judgment nor the Judgment addressed the cause of\n\naction for declaratory judgment.

As a result, there was no\n\nstatutory basis for an award of attorney's fees, and the trial court awarded\n\nattorney's fees to Coffeehouse and Marcus Rogers, Trustee, in error.\n\n      Additionally and alternatively, Movants submit that Broadsay Coffeehouse\n\nand Marcus Rogers, as Trustee, did not segregate their fees among the various\n\ncauses of action for suit to quiet title, declaratory judgment, permanent injunction,\n\nsuit for termination and winding-up of the partnership, and partition.
