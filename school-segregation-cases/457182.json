On appeal, Brown\n\nargues the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss and reurges the arguments he made\n\fin that motion.         Brown contends Arizona’s harassment statute, A.R.S. § 13-2921, is\n\nunconstitutionally vague and overbroad and violates his First Amendment right to freedom of\n\nspeech. See U.S. Const. amend. I. We conclude that the statute does not implicate the First\n\nAmendment and that Brown lacks standing to challenge the statute on the other grounds.\n\nTherefore, we affirm.\n\n                                            BACKGROUND\n\n¶2                We view the largely undisputed facts and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the\n\nlight most favorable to sustaining the conviction. See State v. Henry, 205 Ariz. 229, ¶2, 68 P.3d\n\n455, ¶2 (App. 2003). In October 2000, Brown and the victim, D., met and began dating. In\n\nFebruary 2002, D. ended the relationship. Although D. told Brown “several times,” both “in\n\nperson [and] over the phone” that she no longer wanted to see him, Brown “just wouldn’t stay\n\naway” from her. D. then requested the Tucson City Court to issue an “Injunction Against\n\nHarassment” against Brown. See A.R.S. § 12-1809(A) (“A person may file a verified petition\n\nwith a magistrate, justice of the peace or superior court judge for an injunction prohibiting\n\nharassment.”). After a March 2002 hearing, which Brown attended, a city court magistrate\n\ngranted D.’s request and ordered Brown to refrain from any contact with her without permission\n\nof the court.1 That injunction order remained valid and in effect at all pertinent times.\n\n¶3                Notwithstanding the injunction against harassment, Brown continued to call D. on\n\nboth her home and cellular telephones. D. eventually “got tired of answering [Brown’s] calls”\n\nand called the police, apparently sometime in May 2002. The police told D. to keep a log of the\n\n\n        1\n            The propriety of the injunction against harassment issued by the city court is not at issue\nhere.\n\n                                                    2\n\fcalls and that “they would come out and verify the log from the Caller ID.” In June, a police\n\nofficer went to D.’s home and reviewed her caller identification system, her log of the calls, and\n\nthe injunction against harassment. The officer then located Brown, who admitted to having called\n\nD. and having known about the injunction issued against him. Based on his having called D. in\n\nviolation of the injunction, the state later charged Brown with aggravated harassment, in violation\n\nof A.R.S. § 13-2921.01(A)(1).2\n\n¶4             Before trial, Brown moved to dismiss the charge, arguing that the harassment\n\nstatute was vague, overbroad, and impinged on his First Amendment rights. After hearing\n\nargument, the trial court (Judge Dawley) denied the motion. This appeal followed Brown’s\n\nensuing jury trial, conviction, and sentencing.\n\n                                         DISCUSSION\n\n¶5             Sections 13-2921 and 13-2921.01, A.R.S., define the crimes of harassment and\n\naggravated harassment. Under § 13-2921(A)(1), “[a] person commits harassment if, with intent\n\nto harass or with knowledge that the person is harassing another person, the person . . .\n\n[a]nonymously or otherwise communicates or causes a communication with another person by\n\nverbal, electronic, mechanical, telegraphic, telephonic or written means in a manner that\n\nharasses.” Section 13-2921(E) provides that “‘harassment’ means conduct directed at a specific\n\nperson which would cause a reasonable person to be seriously alarmed, annoyed or harassed and\n\nthe conduct in fact seriously alarms, annoys or harasses the person.” Subsection (D) states that\n\n\n       2\n         The indictment also charged Brown with aggravated harassment based on his allegedly\nhaving harassed D. after having been convicted of domestic violence under A.R.S. § 13-3601.\nSee A.R.S. § 13-2921.01(A)(2). The trial court, however, dismissed that charge with prejudice\non the first day of trial.\n\n                                                  3\n\f§ 13-2921 “does not apply to an otherwise lawful demonstration, assembly or picketing.” And,\n\n§ 13-2921.01(A)(1) defines the aggravated harassment charge of which Brown was convicted:\n\n                      A person commits aggravated harassment if the person\n              commits harassment as provided in § 13-2921 and . . . [a] court has\n              issued an order of protection or an injunction against harassment\n              against the person and in favor of the victim of harassment and the\n              order or injunction has been served and is still valid.\n\n¶6            In denying Brown’s pretrial motion to dismiss, Judge Dawley reasoned:\n\n                       There’s some interesting issues here, but the bottom line is\n              this, that the First Amendment, like every other Amendment, is not\n              absolute. The real question is whether the State has passed a law\n              that has a legitimate purpose that is sufficiently narrow and that\n              doesn’t just arbitrarily or overbroadly interfere with communication\n              and a person’s right to speech.\n\n                     The focus of the offense of harassment is on the contact\n              between particularized people, not on the character of the speech\n              necessarily, although certainly that can be an element. I am\n              required to presume a statute is Constitutional. I think that is still\n              the law, even though we get into these different tests, I suppose, as\n              to whether the statute affects speech or not. But I think that\n              presumption still applies.\n\n                      And then the next question is: Can I interpret it in a way that\n              it will be constitutional? And I do. And I think that may be an\n              oversimplification, but the fact that it’s the contact and not the\n              speech and the fact that the statute specifically requires an intent or\n              knowledge that the person is harassing, is not sufficient to prove\n              that contact was made or speech was made. The state has to prove\n              the specific intent or the general knowledge that the person is\n              harassing in the process. And I think that’s what, in my opinion,\n              saves the statute.\n\nI. First Amendment Challenge\n\n¶7            Brown first argues the trial court erroneously presumed that § 13-2921 is\n\nconstitutional. According to Brown, the statute regulates speech on the basis of its content.\n\n\n                                                4\n\fTherefore, he argues, the statute must be presumed unconstitutional and analyzed under a higher\n\nlevel of scrutiny than that used by the trial court. The state responds that the statute regulates only\n\nnon-expressive conduct and, therefore, does not implicate the First Amendment at all. The state\n\nalso argues that even if the statute were interpreted to apply to speech or expressive conduct, it\n\ndoes so in a content-neutral fashion and that the trial court correctly applied an intermediate level\n\nof scrutiny in analyzing the statute’s constitutionality. We review de novo the constitutional\n\nclaims and matters of statutory interpretation raised here. See Hobson v. Mid-Century Ins. Co.,\n\n199 Ariz. 525, ¶6, 19 P.3d 1241, ¶6 (App. 2001).\n\n¶8             Although § 13-2921(A)(1) prohibits certain kinds of “communication,” it is well\n\nestablished that “[r]esort to epithets or personal abuse is not in any proper sense communication\n\nof information or opinion safeguarded by the Constitution, and its punishment as a criminal act\n\n. . . raise[s] no question under that instrument.” Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 309-10,\n\n60 S. Ct. 900, 906, 84 L. Ed. 1213, 1221 (1940); see also Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315\n\nU.S. 568, 572, 62 S. Ct. 766, 769, 86 L. Ed. 1031, 1035 (1942); State v. Starsky, 106 Ariz. 329,\n\n332, 475 P.2d 943, 946 (1970); State v. Hagen, 27 Ariz. App. 722, 725, 558 P.2d 750, 753\n\n(1976). As one federal court has stated, “‘[p]rohibiting harassment is not prohibiting speech,\n\nbecause harassment is not . . . protected speech. Harassment is not communication, although it\n\nmay take the form of speech.’” Thorne v. Bailey, 846 F.2d 241, 243 (4th Cir. 1988), quoting\n\nState v. Thorne, 333 S.E.2d 817, 819 (W. Va. 1985) (upholding West Virginia’s telephone\n\nharassment statute).\n\n¶9             Arizona courts also have concluded that statutes similar to § 13-2921 that prohibit\n\ncertain types of communication and that contain a specific intent requirement do not implicate the\n\n                                                  5\n\fFirst Amendment. For example, in Hagen, an analogous case, Division One of this court upheld\n\nArizona’s telephone harassment statute, former A.R.S. § 13-895 (since renumbered A.R.S. § 13-\n\n2916), which provided:\n\n                        It shall be unlawful for any person, with intent to terrify,\n                intimidate, threaten, harass, annoy or offend, to telephone another\n                and use any obscene, lewd or profane language or suggest any lewd\n                or lascivious act, or threaten to inflict injury or physical harm to the\n                person or property of any person.\n\nIn finding the statute constitutional, the court stated, “[b]y specifying the intent with which the call\n\nmust be made and the nature of the language prohibited, the statute clearly demonstrates that the\n\nprohibited activities find no protection under the First Amendment.” 27 Ariz. App. at 725, 558\n\nP.2d at 753; see also Starsky, 106 Ariz. at 333, 475 P.2d at 947 (in upholding disturbing the peace\n\nstatute, our supreme court stated it was “inconceivable” that the First Amendment protected\n\nanyone’s right to “wilfully and maliciously traverse the peace and quiet of his fellow citizens”);\n\nBaker v. State, 16 Ariz. App. 463, 466, 494 P.2d 68, 71 (1972) (in finding telephone harassment\n\nstatute constitutional and First Amendment inapplicable, court stated, “[i]t is not the mere use of\n\nprofanity which is subject to punishment but only profanity uttered over the telephone with the\n\nintent to terrify, intimidate, threaten, harass, annoy or offend”).\n\n¶10             Although in a broad sense § 13-2921 criminalizes certain types of\n\n“communication,” we reject Brown’s argument that the statute unconstitutionally regulates\n\nprotected speech. Rather, criminal liability under the statute is based on the “manner” in which\n\ncertain communication is conveyed and the underlying purpose for the communication. § 13-\n\n2921(A)(1). This is made clear by the statute’s requirement that the communication must have\n\nbeen made with the specific “intent to harass.” § 13-2921(A). In addition, the statute contains\n\n                                                   6\n\fboth subjective and objective components, requiring the harassing conduct to be focused on “a\n\nspecific person” and of a type that not only “in fact seriously alarms, annoys or harasses [that]\n\nperson” but also “would cause a reasonable person to be seriously alarmed, annoyed or harassed.”\n\n§ 13-2921(E). In view of these statutory prerequisites, despite Brown’s assertion to the contrary,\n\nno serious argument can be made that the statute renders criminal such isolated, pure speech as\n\n“an invitation to church,” the subject of one of Brown’s calls.        Because the statute only\n\ncriminalizes communications made with a specific, deliberate purpose, the statute does not apply\n\nto pure First Amendment speech and instead regulates, at most, a blend of speech and conduct.\n\n¶11            Indeed, our supreme court has noted that use of a telephone for harassment\n\npurposes “clearly implicates conduct as well as speech.” State v. Musser, 194 Ariz. 31, ¶8, 977\n\nP.2d 131, ¶8 (1999); see also Thorne, 846 F.2d at 243 (telephone harassment statute “prohibits\n\nconduct and not protected speech”); Gormley v. Director, Connecticut State Dep’t of Probation,\n\n632 F.2d 938, 941-42 (2d Cir. 1980) (Connecticut’s telephone harassment statute “regulates\n\nconduct, not mere speech. What is proscribed is the making of a telephone call, with the requisite\n\nintent and in the specified manner.”); McKillop v. State, 857 P.2d 358, 363 (Alaska Ct. App.\n\n1993) (telephone harassment statute “deals with an aspect of conduct mixed with speech”).\n\nNonetheless, the First Amendment’s protections, while literally only forbidding the abridgment\n\nof “speech,” “can encompass expressive conduct.” Bird v. State, 184 Ariz. 198, 204, 908 P.2d\n\n12, 18 (App. 1995), citing Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 404, 109 S. Ct. 2533, 2538-39, 105\n\nL. Ed. 2d 342, 353 (1989).\n\n¶12            The Supreme Court has stated, however, that it “cannot accept the view that an\n\napparent limitless variety of conduct can be labeled ‘speech’ whenever the person engaging in the\n\n                                                7\n\fconduct intends thereby to express an idea.” United States v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 376, 88\n\nS. Ct. 1673, 1678, 20 L. Ed. 2d 672, 679 (1968). From that premise, the Court has further\n\nobserved that “[t]he government generally has a freer hand in restricting expressive conduct than\n\nit has in restricting the written or spoken word.” Johnson, 491 U.S. at 406, 109 S. Ct. at 2540,\n\n105 L. Ed. 2d at 354-55.\n\n¶13            “In deciding whether particular conduct possesses sufficient communicative\n\nelements to bring the First Amendment into play, [the Supreme Court has] asked whether ‘[a]n\n\nintent to convey a particularized message was present, and [whether] the likelihood was great that\n\nthe message would be understood by those who viewed it.’” Id. at 404, 109 S. Ct. at 2539, 105\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 353, quoting Spence v. Washington, 418 U.S. 405, 410-11, 9 4 S. Ct. 2727, 2730,\n\n41 L. Ed. 2d 842, 847 (1974). Some examples of expressive conduct found to have contained a\n\n“particularized message” are: the burning of a United States flag by a protestor at the Republican\n\nNational Convention, see Johnson ; the wearing of black armbands to protest the Vietnam War,\n\nsee Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 89 S. Ct. 733, 21 L. Ed. 2d\n\n731 (1969); and conducting a silent sit-in by African American persons against a library’s\n\nsegregation policy, see Brown v. Louisiana, 383 U.S. 131, 86 S. Ct. 719, 15 L. Ed. 2d 637\n\n(1966). In all cases where a particularized message has been found in expressive conduct, “there\n\nwas little doubt from the circumstances of the conduct that it formed a clear and particularized\n\npolitical or social message very much understood by those who viewed it.” Young v. New York\n\nCity Transit Auth., 903 F.2d 146, 153 (2d Cir. 1990).\n\n¶14            Here, in contrast, Brown’s repeated entreaties to D. that they resume their\n\nrelationship do not contain any such particularized political or social message warranting First\n\n                                                8\n\fAmendment protection. Furthermore, in light of the injunction against harassment D. requested\n\nand obtained against Brown, and his admitted violation of the injunction, he cannot seriously argue\n\nthat his unwanted calls to her actually conveyed any particularized message of the type the First\n\nAmendment protects. See Young, 903 F.2d at 153-54 (begging in New York’s subway system\n\nconveyed no particularized message); Bird, 184 Ariz. at 204, 908 P.2d at 18 (no particularized\n\nmessage in making public wager on an election’s outcome in order to raise voter interest). Indeed,\n\nhad Brown engaged in the sort of public, expressive conduct that courts typically have found to\n\ncontain a particularized political or social message, it is likely his conduct would have fallen within\n\nthe exception in § 13-2921(D). But Brown does not and could not argue that that subsection\n\napplies to his conduct here. In sum, § 13-2921 regulates neither constitutionally protected speech\n\nnor expressive conduct and, thus, does not implicate the First Amendment.3\n\n\n\n       3\n         As noted in ¶7, supra, Brown also contends § 13-2921 impermissibly regulates speech\nbased on its content and, therefore, is presumptively unconstitutional and subject to strict scrutiny\nanalysis. We find that contention dubious. See, e.g., Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S.\n781, 791, 109 S. Ct. 2746, 2754, 105 L. Ed. 2d 661, 675 (1989) (“The principal inquiry in\ndetermining content neutrality . . . is whether the government has adopted a regulation of speech\nbecause of disagreement with the message it conveys. . . . A regulation that serves purposes\nunrelated to the content of expression is deemed neutral, even if it has an incidental effect on some\nspeakers or messages but not others.”); Thorne v.

Because we conclude that\n§ 13-2921 does not implicate First Amendment rights, however, we do not specifically address\nthis argument.\n\n                                                  9\n\fII. Vagueness and Overbreadth Claims\n\n¶15            Relying primarily on two out-of-state cases,4 Brown also argues that § 13-2921 is\n\nunconstitutionally vague and overbroad. In reviewing those challenges to the statute, we are\n\nguided by “a strong presumption that it is constitutional.” State v. Kaiser, 204 Ariz. 514, ¶8, 65\n\nP.3d 463, ¶8 (App. 2003); see also State v. Lefevre, 193 Ariz. 385, ¶18, 972 P.2d 1021, ¶18\n\n(App. 1998); State v. Ochoa, 189 Ariz. 454, 459, 943 P.2d 814, 819 (App. 1997). And, that\n\npresumption “requires the challenging party to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the statute\n\nviolates some provision of the constitution.” Bird, 184 Ariz. at 203, 908 P.2d at 17; see also State\n\nv. Casey, 205 Ariz. 359, ¶11, 71 P.3d 351, ¶11 (2003) (statutes are presumed to be constitutional,\n\nand party challenging statute must show it infringes on constitutional guarantee or violates\n\nconstitutional principle).\n\n¶16            Although, “[o]verbreadth and vagueness challenges often appear in tandem,” they\n\nare distinct concepts. State v. Kessler, 199 Ariz. 83, ¶15, 13 P.3d 1200, ¶15 (App. 2000); see\n\nalso State v. Baldwin, 184 Ariz. 267, 269-70, 908 P.2d 483, 485-86 (App. 1995). “‘An\n\noverbroad statute is one designed to burden or punish activities which are not constitutionally\n\nprotected, but . . . includes within its scope activities which are protected by the First\n\n\n\n       4\n        See State v. Sanderson, 575 P.2d 1025 (Or. Ct. App. 1978); City of Everett v. Moore,\n683 P.2d 617 (Wash. Ct. App. 1984). Brown also relies to a lesser extent on Kramer v. Price,\n712 F.2d 174 (5th Cir. 1983). But see Gormley v. Director, Connecticut State Dep’t of\nProbation, 632 F.2d 938 (2d Cir. 1980) (telephone harassment statute not unconstitutionally\noverbroad on its face); Galloway v.

In contrast,\n\n                       [a] statute is unconstitutionally vague if it fails to give “a\n               person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know\n               what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly” or if it allows\n               for arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement by failing to provide\n               an objective standard for those who are charged with enforcing or\n               applying the law.\n\nIn re Maricopa County Juvenile Action No. JS-5209 & No. JS-4963, 143 Ariz. 178, 183, 692\n\nP.2d 1027, 1032 (App. 1984), quoting Grayned v.

Ed. 2d 222, 227 (1972). “A statute whose terms are vague and conclusory does\n\nnot satisfy due process requirements.” Id.\n\n¶17            Generally, a defendant may raise a vagueness or overbreadth challenge to a criminal\n\nstatute only if he or she actually was injured by the allegedly unconstitutional statute. Musser ,\n\n194 Ariz. 31, ¶5, 977 P.2d 131, ¶5 (overbreadth); State v. Steiger, 162 Ariz. 138, 143, 781 P.2d\n\n616, 621 (App. 1989) (vagueness). Thus, if a defendant’s conduct is not constitutionally protected\n\nand falls within the statute’s legitimate scope, he or she generally does not have standing to\n\nchallenge the statute on vagueness or overbreadth grounds. See In re Maricopa County Juvenile\n\nAction No. JT9065297, 181 Ariz. 69, 73, 887 P.2d 599, 603 (App. 1994); Hagen, 27 Ariz.

Musser, 194 Ariz. 31, ¶5, 977 P.2d 131, ¶5; see also Franzi v. Superior\n\nCourt, 139 Ariz. 556, 563, 679 P.2d 1043, 1050 (1984); Steiger, 162 Ariz. at 145 n.3, 781 P.2d\n\nat 623 n.3. If the statute “‘may cause persons not before the Court to refrain from engaging in\n\nconstitutionally protected speech,’” then Brown has standing to challenge the statute and, if his\n\nchallenge is sustained, the statute cannot be applied to him either. State v. Torres-Mercado, 191\n\nAriz. 279, 282, 955 P.2d 35, 38 (App. 1997), quoting Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc.,\n\n427 U.S. 50, 60, 96 S. Ct. 2440, 2447, 49 L. Ed. 2d 310, 320 (1976); see also Musser, 194 Ariz.\n\n31, ¶5, 977 P.2d 131, ¶5. But that exception to the standing requirement applies only if the\n\nstatute’s deterrent effect on legitimate expression is both “real” and “substantial.” Musser, 194\n\nAriz. 31, ¶6, 977 P.2d 131, ¶6, quoting Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 615, 93 S. Ct.\n\n2908, 2918, 37 L. Ed. 2d 830, 842 (1973); see also Hicks, 539 U.S. at ___, 123 S. Ct. at 2197,\n\n156 L. Ed. 2d at ___ (also noting that whether state court should entertain an overbreadth\n\nchallenge “is entirely a matter of state law”).\n\n¶19            We conclude that Brown does not have standing to raise either his vagueness or\n\noverbreadth challenge. As discussed in detail above, Brown’s conduct at issue here was not\n\nconstitutionally protected. Moreover, the evidence sufficiently established all requisite elements\n\nfor conviction under § 13-2921.01, and the jury’s verdict so reflects.\n\n¶20            Nonetheless, Brown argues that the statute “criminalizes any delivery of bad news,\n\nor delivery of a disturbing message regardless of fault[,] . . . the firing of an employee, because\n\nsuch conduct is alarming and annoying[,] . . . [and] the publication of information in a newspaper,\n\nbecause a reasonable person might be alarmed or annoyed by the prospect of war or economic\n\n                                                  12\n\flosses.” But we are unpersuaded that such summary, hypothetical assertions support an exception\n\nto the standing requirement here.\n\n¶21            None of the foregoing examples of conduct that Brown asserts § 13-2921\n\ncriminalizes is of a type undertaken with an “intent to harass,” as the statute requires.\n\nAdditionally, though Brown might “conceive[] of some impermissible applications of the statute,\n\nhe has provided no indication that any likelihood exists that the state would use the statute to reach\n\nsuch activities.” Musser, 194 Ariz. 31, ¶7, 977 P.2d 131, ¶7. “Indeed, interpreting the statutory\n\nlanguage to permit prosecution for such activities would require the state and the courts to expand\n\nthe statute’s reach considerably beyond that which the legislature intended.” Id. Accordingly,\n\n“[a]ny misuse of the statute, if such occurs, can be addressed and cured through case-by-case\n\nanalysis of specific facts.” Id. at ¶10; see also State v. Hazlett, 205 Ariz. 523, ¶¶23-26, 73 P.3d\n\n1258, ¶¶23-26 (App. 2003); cf. McKillop, 857 P.2d at 364 (Alaska’s telephone harassment statute\n\n“must be interpreted to prohibit telephone calls only when the call has no legitimate\n\ncommunicative purpose—when the caller’s speech is devoid of any substantive information and\n\nthe caller’s sole intention is to annoy or harass the recipient”). That analysis will be informed by\n\nthe presumption that, “if faced with an application of the statute that exceeds its valid reach,\n\n[Arizona courts] would not give the statute an impermissibly broad interpretation.” Musser, 194\n\nAriz. 31, ¶6, 977 P.2d 131, ¶6.\n\n¶22            We also find the narrow exception to the standing requirement inapplicable here\n\nbecause, as noted earlier, § 13-2921 “regulates conduct as well as speech.” Id. at ¶8. Therefore,\n\nBrown is not entitled to “assert the rights of others,” id., particularly when the statute poses no\n\nrealistic danger of significantly compromising established First Amendment rights of others and\n\n                                                 13\n\fwhen Brown’s own conduct clearly falls within the scope of an otherwise valid statute. Id. at ¶¶7,\n\n9. Under these circumstances, Brown is not entitled to challenge § 13-2921’s validity under the\n\nexception to the traditional standing requirement. Therefore, because Brown lacks standing to\n\nassert his vagueness and overbreadth arguments, we do not address them.\n\n                                         DISPOSITION\n\n¶23            Brown’s conviction and sentence are affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                                _______________________________________\n                                                JOHN PELANDER, Presiding Judge\n\nCONCURRING:\n\n\n\n_______________________________________\nPHILIP G.

On appeal, Brown\n\nargues the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss and reurges the arguments he made\n\fin that motion.         Brown contends Arizona’s harassment statute, A.R.S. § 13-2921, is\n\nunconstitutionally vague and overbroad and violates his First Amendment right to freedom of\n\nspeech. See U.S. Const. amend. I. We conclude that the statute does not implicate the First\n\nAmendment and that Brown lacks standing to challenge the statute on the other grounds.\n\nTherefore, we affirm.\n\n                                            BACKGROUND\n\n¶2                We view the largely undisputed facts and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the\n\nlight most favorable to sustaining the conviction.

In October 2000, Brown and the victim, D., met and began dating. In\n\nFebruary 2002, D. ended the relationship. Although D. told Brown “several times,” both “in\n\nperson [and] over the phone” that she no longer wanted to see him, Brown “just wouldn’t stay\n\naway” from her. D. then requested the Tucson City Court to issue an “Injunction Against\n\nHarassment” against Brown. See A.R.S. § 12-1809(A) (“A person may file a verified petition\n\nwith a magistrate, justice of the peace or superior court judge for an injunction prohibiting\n\nharassment.”). After a March 2002 hearing, which Brown attended, a city court magistrate\n\ngranted D.’s request and ordered Brown to refrain from any contact with her without permission\n\nof the court.1 That injunction order remained valid and in effect at all pertinent times.\n\n¶3                Notwithstanding the injunction against harassment, Brown continued to call D. on\n\nboth her home and cellular telephones. D. eventually “got tired of answering [Brown’s] calls”\n\nand called the police, apparently sometime in May 2002. The police told D. to keep a log of the\n\n\n        1\n            The propriety of the injunction against harassment issued by the city court is not at issue\nhere.\n\n                                                    2\n\fcalls and that “they would come out and verify the log from the Caller ID.” In June, a police\n\nofficer went to D.’s home and reviewed her caller identification system, her log of the calls, and\n\nthe injunction against harassment. The officer then located Brown, who admitted to having called\n\nD. and having known about the injunction issued against him. Based on his having called D. in\n\nviolation of the injunction, the state later charged Brown with aggravated harassment, in violation\n\nof A.R.S. § 13-2921.01(A)(1).2\n\n¶4             Before trial, Brown moved to dismiss the charge, arguing that the harassment\n\nstatute was vague, overbroad, and impinged on his First Amendment rights. After hearing\n\nargument, the trial court (Judge Dawley) denied the motion. This appeal followed Brown’s\n\nensuing jury trial, conviction, and sentencing.\n\n                                         DISCUSSION\n\n¶5             Sections 13-2921 and 13-2921.01, A.R.S., define the crimes of harassment and\n\naggravated harassment. Under § 13-2921(A)(1), “[a] person commits harassment if, with intent\n\nto harass or with knowledge that the person is harassing another person, the person . . .\n\n[a]nonymously or otherwise communicates or causes a communication with another person by\n\nverbal, electronic, mechanical, telegraphic, telephonic or written means in a manner that\n\nharasses.” Section 13-2921(E) provides that “‘harassment’ means conduct directed at a specific\n\nperson which would cause a reasonable person to be seriously alarmed, annoyed or harassed and\n\nthe conduct in fact seriously alarms, annoys or harasses the person.” Subsection (D) states that\n\n\n       2\n         The indictment also charged Brown with aggravated harassment based on his allegedly\nhaving harassed D. after having been convicted of domestic violence under A.R.S. § 13-3601.\nSee A.R.S. § 13-2921.01(A)(2). The trial court, however, dismissed that charge with prejudice\non the first day of trial.\n\n                                                  3\n\f§ 13-2921 “does not apply to an otherwise lawful demonstration, assembly or picketing.” And,\n\n§ 13-2921.01(A)(1) defines the aggravated harassment charge of which Brown was convicted:\n\n                      A person commits aggravated harassment if the person\n              commits harassment as provided in § 13-2921 and . . . [a] court has\n              issued an order of protection or an injunction against harassment\n              against the person and in favor of the victim of harassment and the\n              order or injunction has been served and is still valid.\n\n¶6            In denying Brown’s pretrial motion to dismiss, Judge Dawley reasoned:\n\n                       There’s some interesting issues here, but the bottom line is\n              this, that the First Amendment, like every other Amendment, is not\n              absolute. The real question is whether the State has passed a law\n              that has a legitimate purpose that is sufficiently narrow and that\n              doesn’t just arbitrarily or overbroadly interfere with communication\n              and a person’s right to speech.\n\n                     The focus of the offense of harassment is on the contact\n              between particularized people, not on the character of the speech\n              necessarily, although certainly that can be an element. I am\n              required to presume a statute is Constitutional. I think that is still\n              the law, even though we get into these different tests, I suppose, as\n              to whether the statute affects speech or not. But I think that\n              presumption still applies.\n\n                      And then the next question is: Can I interpret it in a way that\n              it will be constitutional? And I do. And I think that may be an\n              oversimplification, but the fact that it’s the contact and not the\n              speech and the fact that the statute specifically requires an intent or\n              knowledge that the person is harassing, is not sufficient to prove\n              that contact was made or speech was made. The state has to prove\n              the specific intent or the general knowledge that the person is\n              harassing in the process. And I think that’s what, in my opinion,\n              saves the statute.\n\nI. First Amendment Challenge\n\n¶7            Brown first argues the trial court erroneously presumed that § 13-2921 is\n\nconstitutional. According to Brown, the statute regulates speech on the basis of its content.\n\n\n                                                4\n\fTherefore, he argues, the statute must be presumed unconstitutional and analyzed under a higher\n\nlevel of scrutiny than that used by the trial court. The state responds that the statute regulates only\n\nnon-expressive conduct and, therefore, does not implicate the First Amendment at all. The state\n\nalso argues that even if the statute were interpreted to apply to speech or expressive conduct, it\n\ndoes so in a content-neutral fashion and that the trial court correctly applied an intermediate level\n\nof scrutiny in analyzing the statute’s constitutionality. We review de novo the constitutional\n\nclaims and matters of statutory interpretation raised here. See Hobson v. Mid-Century Ins.

For example, in Hagen, an analogous case, Division One of this court upheld\n\nArizona’s telephone harassment statute, former A.R.S. § 13-895 (since renumbered A.R.S. § 13-\n\n2916), which provided:\n\n                        It shall be unlawful for any person, with intent to terrify,\n                intimidate, threaten, harass, annoy or offend, to telephone another\n                and use any obscene, lewd or profane language or suggest any lewd\n                or lascivious act, or threaten to inflict injury or physical harm to the\n                person or property of any person.\n\nIn finding the statute constitutional, the court stated, “[b]y specifying the intent with which the call\n\nmust be made and the nature of the language prohibited, the statute clearly demonstrates that the\n\nprohibited activities find no protection under the First Amendment.” 27 Ariz.

Rather, criminal liability under the statute is based on the “manner” in which\n\ncertain communication is conveyed and the underlying purpose for the communication. § 13-\n\n2921(A)(1). This is made clear by the statute’s requirement that the communication must have\n\nbeen made with the specific “intent to harass.” § 13-2921(A). In addition, the statute contains\n\n                                                   6\n\fboth subjective and objective components, requiring the harassing conduct to be focused on “a\n\nspecific person” and of a type that not only “in fact seriously alarms, annoys or harasses [that]\n\nperson” but also “would cause a reasonable person to be seriously alarmed, annoyed or harassed.”\n\n§ 13-2921(E). In view of these statutory prerequisites, despite Brown’s assertion to the contrary,\n\nno serious argument can be made that the statute renders criminal such isolated, pure speech as\n\n“an invitation to church,” the subject of one of Brown’s calls.        Because the statute only\n\ncriminalizes communications made with a specific, deliberate purpose, the statute does not apply\n\nto pure First Amendment speech and instead regulates, at most, a blend of speech and conduct.\n\n¶11            Indeed, our supreme court has noted that use of a telephone for harassment\n\npurposes “clearly implicates conduct as well as speech.” State v.

Furthermore, in light of the injunction against harassment D. requested\n\nand obtained against Brown, and his admitted violation of the injunction, he cannot seriously argue\n\nthat his unwanted calls to her actually conveyed any particularized message of the type the First\n\nAmendment protects.

Indeed,\n\nhad Brown engaged in the sort of public, expressive conduct that courts typically have found to\n\ncontain a particularized political or social message, it is likely his conduct would have fallen within\n\nthe exception in § 13-2921(D).

Moreover, the evidence sufficiently established all requisite elements\n\nfor conviction under § 13-2921.01, and the jury’s verdict so reflects.\n\n¶20            Nonetheless, Brown argues that the statute “criminalizes any delivery of bad news,\n\nor delivery of a disturbing message regardless of fault[,] . . . the firing of an employee, because\n\nsuch conduct is alarming and annoying[,] . . . [and] the publication of information in a newspaper,\n\nbecause a reasonable person might be alarmed or annoyed by the prospect of war or economic\n\n                                                  12\n\flosses.” But we are unpersuaded that such summary, hypothetical assertions support an exception\n\nto the standing requirement here.\n\n¶21            None of the foregoing examples of conduct that Brown asserts § 13-2921\n\ncriminalizes is of a type undertaken with an “intent to harass,” as the statute requires.\n\nAdditionally, though Brown might “conceive[] of some impermissible applications of the statute,\n\nhe has provided no indication that any likelihood exists that the state would use the statute to reach\n\nsuch activities.” Musser, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1187681\"><a href=\"/opinion/1187681/state-v-musser/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ariz.</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶7, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1187681\"><a href=\"/opinion/1187681/state-v-musser/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">131</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶7. “Indeed, interpreting the statutory\n\nlanguage to permit prosecution for such activities would require the state and the courts to expand\n\nthe statute’s reach considerably beyond that which the legislature intended.” Id.

Therefore, because Brown lacks standing to\n\nassert his vagueness and overbreadth arguments, we do not address them.\n\n                                         DISPOSITION\n\n¶23            Brown’s conviction and sentence are affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                                _______________________________________\n                                                JOHN PELANDER, Presiding Judge\n\nCONCURRING:\n\n\n\n_______________________________________\nPHILIP G.
