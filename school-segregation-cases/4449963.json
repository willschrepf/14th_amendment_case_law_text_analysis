The “corrected” record was filed with\nvolumes 2 and 3 containing the same pages, volume 12 completely missing,\ncertain missing pages and several pages out of order. As a result, it is necessary\nto refer to the original record (CR) at times. Since the page numbers in the CR\nand the CCR are the same, the court can consult the CCR unless it finds a\nnecessary page missing, in which case it will have to consult the non-searchable\nCR.\n\n                                        1\n\fjudgment.

(CR 22:3241 -24:3474.)\n\n     TC filed a summary judgment reply on February 12, 2015 (CCR\n\n21: 3512–3645) and MPF filed a summary judgment reply on\n\nFebruary 13, 2015 (CCR 22:3701–3736).      MPF’s reply included a\n\nseries of objections and request to strike plaintiffs’ summary\n\njudgment evidence.\n\n     MOTIONS TO STRIKE\n\n     During the pendency of the summary judgment motions, MFP\n\nand TC filed a joint motion to strike Rollins’ designation of Burt\n\nThorpe, a safety expert, on January 23, 2015. (CCR 5:508 – 567.)\n\nAppellants filed a response on February 3, 2015. (CCR 6:700 – 746.)\n\nMFP filed a reply on February 9, 2015. (CCR 21: 3475-3484.)

A\n\njoint reply was filed on February 6, 2015 (CCR 20:3235-3239.)\n\n      On February 13, 2014 TC filed objections and a motion to strike\n\nevidence and references in Rollins’ responses to TC’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment. (CCR 22:3666 – 3700.) Rollins filed a response\n\non February 13, 2015. (CCR 22:3737 – 23:3922.)\n\n      THE FEBRUARY 19 ORDERS\n\n      On February 19, 2015, the trial court issued a series of orders\n\nrelating to the summary judgments and the evidence.                  The court\n\ngranted the joint motion to strike the designation of Rollins’ liability\n\nexpert, Burt Thorpe, (CCR 24:3923). The court also granted nearly\n\nall   of   the   requests   to   strike   portions   of   Rollins’    affidavit.\n\n(CCR 24:3925-3934.)         The court also sustained the objections to\n\nsummary judgment evidence set forth in MPF’s summary judgment\n\nreply. (CCR 24:3936-3937.) However, the court denied the joint\n\nmotion to strike the reports and opinions of Gilbert Martinez, Joe G.\n\nGonzales, and Thomas M. Roney. (CCR 24:3924.) Finally, the court\n\ngranted TC’s motion for summary judgment (CCR 24:3935), and\n\ngranted MPF’s motion for summary judgment (CCR 24:3938).\n\n                                      3\n\f     RECONSIDERATION\n\n     On February 24, 2015 Mr. and Mrs. Rollins filed an emergency\n\nmotion to reopen the evidence. (CCR 24:3939 – 4027.) On the same\n\nday Mr. and Mrs. Rollins also filed a motion to reconsider regarding\n\nTCs motion for summary judgment.        (CCR 24:4028 – 4136)     On\n\nMarch 2, 2015 they also filed a motion to reconsider MPF’s motion\n\nfor summary judgment. (SR 10-23).\n\n     On March 9, 2015, TC filed a response to the emergency motion\n\nto reopen the evidence. (CCR 25:4151-4163.) On March 11, 2015,\n\nTC filed a response to the motion to reconsider. (CCR 25: 4164 –\n\n4170.) On March 12, 2015, MPF filed its response to the emergency\n\nmotion to reopen the evidence. (CCR 25:4171 – 4176).\n\n     On March 17, 2015, the court below, denied Mr. & Mrs. Rollins’\n\nmotion for reconsideration of the TC summary judgment (SR 7), and\n\nalso denied their motion to reopen the evidence (SR 8).\n\n     On April 10, the Court below denied Rollins’ motion for\n\nreconsideration of the MPF summary judgment. (CCR 25:4180.)\n\n     A notice of appeal was filed on May 8, 2015. (CCR 25:4181-\n\n4183) The clerk’s record was filed (incorrectly) on June 9, 2015.

STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION\n\n          This Court has jurisdiction under Tex. Const. art. V, § 6\n\nand Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 22.220.\n\n\n\n\n                                   5\n\f          STATEMENT REGARDING ORAL ARGUMENT\n\n\n     No oral argument was had in the court below.          Appellants\n\nbelieve the lack of oral argument contributed to the erroneous rulings\n\nof the lower court. The orders of dismissal contain no discussion of\n\nthe testimony as they relate to the elements of the claims. Also, the\n\ncourt below has stricken factual statements made in the affidavit of\n\nan unsophisticated lay witness, plaintiff/appellant, Garry Rollins.\n\nThey were stricken because the lower court believed they were either\n\ninconsistent with his deposition testimony, or simply beyond his\n\ncompetence.\n\n     Oral questioning of counsel will be the most effective way for\n\nthis Court to extract a detailed and accurate presentation of the\n\nparties’ arguments on consistency (or inconsistency) of the evidence.\n\nOral argument will thus emphasize and clarify the written\n\narguments, significantly aiding the decisional process of this Court.\n\n\n\n\n                                  6\n\f                     ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n\n\n1.

Whether the Trial Court Erred in Granting the Motion for\n     Summary Judgment of MPF and Its Underlying Objections\n     to Evidence.\n\n\n\n3.   Whether the Trial Court Abused Its Discretion in Refusing\n     to Re-Open the Evidence.\n\n\n\n\n                               7\n\f                      STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n\n\n1.   SUMMARY\n     Gary Rollins was injured when he “blacked out” and fell during\n\nan attempt to dismount from the platform of a “scissor lift.” Over his\n\nown protest, he had been ordered to “get up there” and patch the\n\nhigh ceiling of a gymnasium. Defying all common sense, his direct\n\nsupervisors ordered him “up there” knowing that he suffered from\n\na fear of heights and “syncope,” a condition which causes\n\nfrequent and unpredictable loss of consciousness. Moreover, he\n\nhad not received training or instruction on the use of the lift.\n\n2.   LITIGATION FACTS.\n\n     Despite its simplicity, the case below was hotly contested by\n\nTexas College, a non-subscriber to the workers compensation\n\nsystem, and TC’s co-defendant. From the beginning the case was\n\nburdened with numerous aggressive filings -- special exceptions,\n\nmotions to compel, motions to strike evidence, and motions for\n\nsummary judgment. (CCR passim).\n\n\n\n\n                                   8\n\f     Eventually, the case reduced to two (2) summary judgment\n\nmotions and a number of supporting motions to strike evidence. On\n\nFebruary 19, 2015 the trial court simultaneously issued orders on\n\nall of the pending motions.\n\n     The court sustained numerous objections to many parts of the\n\nsummary     judgment     evidence       (CCR   24:3936-3937.),   expert\n\ndesignations (CCR 24:3923), and certain parts of Mr. Rollins’ affidavit\n\n(CCR 24:3925-3934.) – which required redaction. However, as will\n\nbe shown below, the striking of the various parts of the evidence\n\nwas truly inconsequential. What survived, was ample summary\n\njudgment evidence.\n\n     Preserving some significant evidence, the trial court denied\n\ndefendants’ request to strike expert reports of certain doctors (CCR\n\n24:3924).   These reports had been incorporated by reference into\n\nappellants’ responses to requests for disclosures.      The disclosure\n\nresponses were specifically used as summary judgment evidence.\n\n(CCR 2:109) (See reference to Exhibit “H”).\n\n     Without oral hearing, the trial court granted the motions for\n\nsummary judgment.\n\n\n\n                                    9\n\f      An attempt was made here to draft this statement using only\n\ninformation from materials on file and documents referenced by the\n\nparties which were not stricken at the time of the February 19 orders.2\n\nThese facts do not contain materials submitted on reconsideration or\n\non the request to re-open the evidence. These facts were not stricken\n\nand were specifically allowed by trial court when it granted the\n\nsummary judgments:\n\n3.    CASE FACTS\n\n      GARY ROLLINS, TEXAS COLLEGE, AND MPF\n\n      Gary Rollins worked “at Texas College as a maintenance Tech\n\nand Supervisor for about six years.” (CCR 25:4131).

Brackens had\n\nevaluated Rollins as “honest” “responsible,” and rated him “good” in\n\n“willingness to do work.” (CCR 4:359).\n\n     Bracken’s direct supervisor was James Harris, Vice President of\n\nBusiness and Finance. (CCR 7:930, 21:3513).

Gonzales,3\n\nsummarized his medical history of Rollins:\n\n            On September 9, 2013, Mr. Rollins was seen at the\n      Emergency Department of Baylor University Medical Center for\n      syncope. It was indicated Mr. Rollins had multiple episodes and\n      each spell was \"ppt\" by generalized paresthesia, and some\n      lightheadedness. It was also indicated Mr. Rollins had episodes\n      at work, while driving and had several spells that day. It was\n      also noted Mr. Rollins lost consciousness that day and Mr.\n      Rollins had a GCS score of 15.\n            On September 10, 2013, Mr. Rollins was discharged home\n      in stable condition and was provided a diagnosis of syncope.\n      It was indicated Mr. Rollins was provided discharge instructions\n      for syncope (fainting episode). It was noted Mr. Rollins was\n      provided a work release form which allowed Mr. Rollins to be\n      able to return to work in 2 days with no restrictions.\n            On October 14, 2013, Mr. Rollins was seen by William J.\n      Hwang, M.D. for blackout spell during exertion, pain in neck\n      and back, and numbness from the neck down. It was noted Mr.\n      Rollins was lifting a heavy object on September 4, 2013, sneezed\n      during the episode and developed weakness and numbness\n      from the neck down. It was indicated Mr. Rollins passed out\n      twice that day and had felt dizzy and lightheaded prior to\n      blackout spells. ….

GONZALES, MD (CCR 6:646-647) (emphasis added).\n\n     NOTICE OF SYNCOPE DIAGNOSIS AND REMOVAL FROM DRIVING DUTY\n\n     Importantly, Rollins informed both Harris and Brackens that he\n\n“was now having dizziness and blackout spells.” ROLLINS AFFIDAVIT\n\n(CCR 25:4132). Brackens admitted to hearing about the problem:\n\n“…I left out on the 9th of September and I think I returned on the\n\n17th. I think that's when I -- the day I returned back from vacation.\n\nThere was a incident that I heard that he had had a light stroke or a\n\nheart attack or something --…” (CCR 4:382). In addition, on at least\n\none prior occasion Rollins told Brackens that he was afraid of\n\nheights. (CR 4:294)\n\n     In his affidavit, Rollins indicated that he “produced a Doctor\n\nnote to prove that [he] had been to the hospital. Mr. Harris and Mr.\n\nBrackens then removed [him] from a driving duty [he] had been\n\nperforming for some time at Texas College where [he] would drive\n\nstudents from Dallas to Tyler to attend classes.” (CCR 25:4132). In\n\nhis sworn interrogatory answers Rollins stated that he was “restricted\n\nfrom driving” in September of 2013. (CCR 3:236).\n\n                                 13\n\f     Rollins had been asked to drive TC students on Tuesday and\n\nThursday mornings.     (CCR. 4:306).     Brackens testified that he\n\n“knew” about the “park-and-rides” Rollins was “doing” on Tuesdays\n\nand Thursdays. (CCR 4:362). Confirming Rollins’ version of events,\n\nBrackens also testified that he suspected that Harris was responsible\n\nfor the suspension:\n\n     Q. Who is it -- who is it that likely took him off of the driving\n        detail?\n     A. Mr. Harris.\n     Q. And do you know why Mr. Harris took him off the driving\n        detail?\n     A. No, sir, I do not.\n     Q. Did it have anything to do with Garry having some\n        issues behind the wheel, passing out, that sort of thing?\n     A. That I do not know. I know that he had been in and out sick\n        all the time. That could have been the issue.\n\n(CCR 7:883-883).\n\n     THE GROWING ANTAGONISM\n\n     During this time, Rollins began “to experience problems getting\n\nalong with Mr. Brackens.” (CCR 25:4132). “At times” he questioned\n\nBracken’s “leadership ability and competence.” Id. Brackens was\n\nhaving Rollins “perform maintenance and repair jobs that were at\n\ntimes degrading and a little frightening.”     Id.   Rollins began to\n\nquestion the schools attitude toward their safety. (CCR 25:4133).\n\n\n                                 14\n\f     Although he was Rollins’ superior, Brackens admitted that he\n\nresigned because he had “leadership problems” and that employees\n\nwere “not listening” to him. (CCR 4:343). A colloquy with counsel\n\nshows that Brackens had an issue with people not taking his orders:\n\n     Q. Meaning that people were not respecting your leadership\n        and authority and your position?\n     A. Correct.\n     Q. And why do you think that there was a lack of respect for\n        your authority and leadership at Texas College?\n     A. Don't know. Don't know. That's -- the employees, that's the\n        problems that I had. You cannot make grown folks work,\n        and all I could do was ask them to do jobs and they it\n        wasn't getting done.\n\n(CCR 4:344) (emphasis added).\n\n     THE WORK ON OCTOBER 21, 2013\n\n     On October 21, 2013 Roland Brackens told Rollins, that “Dr.\n\nFennel wanted the ceiling in the gym fixed....” and that a “scissor lift\n\nwould be out” and to “go in” the gym. (CCR 4:297). Mr. Rollins\n\ndescribed his response: “I expressed to him then I didn’t know how\n\nto use it and I didn’t want to get up on it because I done got too old\n\nand I’m afraid of the height.” (CCR. 4:297). Nevertheless Brackens\n\ntold Rollins to get with another employee “Michael Jones” who\n\n\n\n\n                                  15\n\fBrackens claimed knew “how to use it.” (CCR 4:297).               Rollins\n\ncomplied. Id.\n\n        After some difficulty with the lift, as Mr. Rollins described: “We\n\nfinally got it crunk up, and we went up and patched the roof, the\n\nceiling. I stayed up there about five minutes on the 21st showing\n\nhim what needed to be done, and him and a community service\n\nfinished off.” (CCR 4:297) (emphasis added). Although, Rollins had\n\nno “trouble getting off the lift” (CCR 4:299), he was “nervous the\n\nentire time” he was “up there.” (CCR 25:4133). They did not finish\n\nthe work that day. (CCR 25:4133).\n\n        Bracken’s judgment was not good.        Earlier that day he had\n\ninstructed the men to put a ladder on top of the scissor lift\n\nplatform to reach even higher. (CR. 4:303-304). He admitted to it.\n\n(CCR 4:342). His order was universally rejected by his subordinates\n\nand his superiors. (CCR 4:304). The deposition testimony describes\n\nthis crazy suggestion, as well as Rollins’ response in rejecting the\n\nidea:\n\n        Q. What other conversation took place?\n        A. I discussed with Mr. Harris Roland told them guys to set a\n           ladder up on top of the lift and get up there because it\n           wouldn't reach a certain height that they had to get to and\n           he told them to set a ladder up on top of the lift and I told\n                                    16\n\f       them not to set no ladder up on there because they be\n       done fell out and kill theirself. And I told Ms. Bowie and\n       Mr. Harris that. Well, Mr. Harris started laughing about it\n       and said that that was stupid of Roland to even suggest that\n       being in the position that he's in.\n     Q. And you were standing there when Mr. Brackens told this\n        to Stevie?\n     A. No. They came and told me, and I confronted Mr. Bracket\n        about it.\n     Q. Stevie was one of them, was the other one --\n     A. Mike and Alex.\n     Q. All three.\n     A. Yes.\n     Q. And they told you and then you went --\n     A. And then I went and talked to Roland about it first,\n        asked him why would he tell them to set a ladder up on\n        that lift.\n     Q. And what did he say?\n     A. He said that Dr. Fennell want this done, he want it done by\n        Friday, so whatever it takes to get it done, that's what we\n        need to do.\n\n(CCR 24:4041-4042) (emphasis added).\n\n     THE CONFRONTATION ON THE AFTERNOON OF OCTOBER 21ST\n\n     Rollins’ refusal to obey Mr. Brackens had consequences. Later\n\nthat evening Rollins “was called to the office by Mr. Harris and Ms.\n\nBowie....” (CCR 4:297-298). As Mr. Rollins put it: “…Mr. Bracket\n\nhad told them that I said I wasn’t going to get up there and do it….”\n\n(CCR. 4:298). Harris told Rollins that Brackens had “complained”\n\n                                 17\n\fthat Rollins was an “ongoing discipline problem” and that Rollins\n\n“didn’t want to do as told.” (CCR 25:4133). “Mr. Harris informed\n\n[Rollins] that in order to keep [his] job [he] needed to get the\n\nceiling fixed as directed.” Id. (emphasis added).\n\n     In his deposition, Rollins described the pressure to be on the lift\n\ndue to the presence of a camera in the gym:\n\n     Q. Now, I do want to ask you about this conversation. Tell me,\n        just describe in your own words as best you can what you\n        said to them and what they said to you.\n     A. Well, when I walked in the office, I asked Mr. Harris what\n        was going on, and I saw Ms. Bowie. And normally if\n        something is going on that Mr. Harris want me to take care\n        of, he usually calls me up there and I do the job. When I\n        saw Ms. Bowie, I asked them what was going on.\n       They said, \"Mr. Bracket said that you won't do nothing\n       he said.\"\n       And I told them he was a liar. I say, \"I done been in the\n       gym this morning and started Mike and them in there\n       patching the roof.\" We got cameras in there in the gym,\n       and I was seen on the cameras up there on the lift.\n     Q. How do you know that? Was that part of this conversation?\n     A. Was it part of who conversation?\n     Q. The conversation with Mr. Harris and Ms. Bowie?\n     A. Yes. I told them I was seen by Dr. Fennell and Ms. Marshall.\n     Q. On the camera.\n     A. Yes.\n     Q. How do you find out about that?\n     A. Ms. Marshall told me.\n     Q. When did she tell you that?\n                                  18\n\fA. That evening on the way home. She said, \"I was sitting up\n   here wondering why did you get up on the lift feeling\n   the way you feel.\"\n    AND I TOLD HER I DIDN'T HAVE NO CHOICE and I got to\n    finish it up tomorrow.\nQ. But you were discussing that with Mr. Harris and Ms.\n   Bowie?\nA. Yes.\nQ. But you weren't aware that you were seen on the camera\n   until after you left the campus to go home.\nA. No, no, no. When we got in the car, Ms. Marshall\n   automatically started talking with me about why would you\n   get up on that lift.\n…\nQ. So, tell me -- all right. So, tell me about this discussion\n   then about being on the camera with – I mean, the\n   discussion you had with Ms. Bowie and Mr. Harris about\n   being on the camera.\nA. It wasn't a long discussion, it was just when I was called in\n   the office that evening, I was already in Ms. Marshall's office\n   sitting in her office. And she sit up there and ask me,\n   \"Why would you get up on the lift like that and you\n   know how you're feeling?\"\n    So, I told her at that time, \"Well, Roland told me that I\n    had to GET UP THERE and get it done.\" And then in the\n    next two or three minutes, Mr. Harris called my phone and\n    had me come around to his office, we're in the same\n    building. I went around to his office, and he immediately\n    told me that Mr. Bracket said that I wouldn't do nothing he\n    told me to do and I was supposed to been in there fixing\n    that gym and I wasn't even doing that.\n    And I told him that Mr. Bracket is telling a lie, I say Ms.\n    Marshall and Dr. Fennell saw me on there.\nQ. So, Ms. Marshall told you that she and Dr. Fennell saw\n   you.\n\n                              19\n\f     A. Yes.\n\n(CCR 4:300 - 303) (emphasis added). Rollins continued to describe\n\nthe specific directive he received that afternoon from Mr. Harris:\n\n     Q. Did you have any further conversation with Ms. Bowie and\n        Mr. Harris?\n     A. No. As far as on that evening, Mr. Harris just told me that\n        first thing in the morning go in there and get that done, he\n        say, because Dr. Fennell been telling Roland that he wanted\n        to get it done and Roland come up here and say you say you\n        ain't going to do it, but we need to get that done before\n        Friday. I told Mr. Harris, \"Mr. Harris, I'm going to tell you\n        like I told Roland, I'm afraid of the height, but I'm going to\n        get in there and I'm going to get it done.\" And at that time, I\n        was also angry. But when Tuesday came, I went in there\n        and I got it done.\n\n(CCR 4:304-305).\n\n     Interestingly, Mr. Brackens testied repeatedly that Rollins was\n\nnot at work on the 21st. (CCR 20:3289). But Michael Johnson, a co-\n\nworker indicated that Rollins was there and had instructed him to\n\ndisregard the crazy ladder instruction made by Brackens earlier on\n\nthat day. (CCR 20:3269).\n\n     THE WORK ON OCTOBER 22ND\n\n     Rollins testified that he showed up for work at about 7:15 am\n\non the morning of the 22nd and after a short “McDonalds” breakfast\n\nthe crew got to work. (CCR 4:307). He continued:\n\n\n                                 20\n\f       And by that time, the guys would be through picking up\n       trash out through the campus, and we all get started to\n       work. So, on that Tuesday, I knew I didn't have a choice,\n       I feel like my job was in jeopardy and I was still mad and\n       angry. But I went in the gym, me, Steve Alex, Mike hadn't\n       showed up yet, and we try to get the lift started. We couldn't\n       get it started; so, it was another lift on the other end, we\n       went down there and we managed to get that one crunk up.\n       And I went up there and start patching the holes. Maybe\n       five minutes Mike came in, and he told me that he would go\n       ahead and finish it. And I told him, nah, I said, no, Roland\n       done called me in the -- I mean, Mr. Harris done called me\n       in the office yesterday evening because of Roland telling\n       him that I wouldn't do it. He said, \"Well, Roland is just\n       lying, we was in here.\" I said, \"Well, I know it\" I said, \"but\n       I'm not worried about that,\" I say, \"I just need to get this\n       done because I don't need them saying nothing else to me\n       about this gym.\"\n\nId. In another exchange, Rollins testified about the situation with\n\nmore detail:\n\n     Q. And how long were you up on the lift up there by yourself\n        before Mike came in?\n     A. Maybe 5 or 8 minutes. When he came in, I let it down and\n        he got on. And he told me that, \"Well, you go ahead and\n        get off, man, because you look like you're scared.\" I\n        said, \"Well, I don't want to be up here anyway, but your\n        uncle went and lied yesterday; so, I got to get this\n        done.\"\n     Q. So, he and Mike initiated the comment that you go ahead\n        and get down because you look like you're scared.\n     A. Yes.\n     Q. And then you told him no because your uncle --\n     A. I had to get it done.\n     Q. Because your uncle lied yesterday.\n\n                                21\n\f     A. Yes. I was directed by Mr. Harris to get it done Tuesday.\n     Q. That wasn't T-uesday, was it?\n     A. That was on a Monday when Mr. Harris direct me\n        Tuesday morning GET UP THERE and get it done.\n\n(CCR 309)(emphasis added).\n\n     Rollins was “afraid” of working on the scissor lift at that time\n\n“because [he] didn’t know how to operate it, hadn’t been trained, and\n\nwas fearful because of [his] injury and blackouts.” (CCR 25:4134).\n\n     Harris testified that Rollins was duty bound to get on the lift if\n\nMr. Brackens told him to – even if Brackens knew about the syncope!\n\n     Q. So, you're now going to testify -- or are you testifying now\n        that if a manager knows that an employee is suffering\n        from seizures, the employee should get on the scissor\n        lift if the manager says get up there and do it, is that\n        what you're telling me?\n     A. Yes.\n\n(CCR 868). This is the type of evidence which supports a finding of\n\ngross negligence. Brackens has completely denied the events and\n\nstated that he told Mr. Rollins not to “be in the Gym” on Oct. 22d.\n\n(CCR 4:354).\n\n     Rollins “would not have gotten on the lift if [he] had not been\n\nspecifically instructed to do so by Mr. Brackens and later by Mr.\n\nHarris.” (CCR 25:4134). “The only reason [he] got on the lift is\n\n\n                                 22\n\fbecause [he] was told to do so and was made to feel as though\n\n[his] job depended on it.” (CCR 25:4134-4135) (emphasis added).\n\nRollins “didn't want to do it.” (CCR 25:4135).\n\n             If Mr. Brackens had looked at the owner's manual and\n      informed [Rollins] that a person with blackouts shouldn't be on\n      a lift, [Rollins] would not have gotten on. Mr. Brackens however\n      did not do this. He did not look at a safety manual, and if he\n      did, he certainly did not inform or warn [Rollins] that a person\n      in [Rollins’] condition shouldn't be on a scissor lift.\nId.\n\n      THE FINAL “BLACK OUT” AND THE “FALL”\n\n      Once Mike “brought the lift down” Rollins “went to exit and fell\n\nfrom the top of the platform flat on [his] back onto the gym floor.”\n\n(CCR 25:4134). “The top of the lift platform is still a good three feet\n\noff the ground when its all the way down and [he] fell straight back\n\nwith nothing breaking his fall.”     Id.   Rollins does not “remember\n\ntaking the first step down.” Id.\n\n      Insinuating that Rollins’ prior ordeal (of multiple hospital visits,\n\nmedical tests, and ultimate syncope diagnosis) was the first part of\n\nsome elaborate fraud, Michael Johnson who is apparently Bracken’s\n\nnephew (CCR 4:309) and was still on the payroll (CCR 4:400) testified\n\nthat Rollins looked like he just “let go.” (CCR 4:410). Johnson also\n\nclaimed Rollins offered to “take care of” him “when this is over.” (CCR\n                                   23\n\f4:413). In a move completely inconsistent with fraud, after the fall,\n\nRollins said something like “Yea, I’m fine or okay.” (CCR 4:458.) He\n\ntold Stevie Barron “that he was just embarrassed.” Id. Rollins was,\n\nin fact, embarrassed and thought he was alright. (CCR 25:4134). He\n\n“tried to get up fast because [he] was more embarrassed knowing that\n\nDr. Fennell was looking at the cameras.” (CCR 21:3620). “Of course,\n\n[he] later ended up having to have major surgery.” Id.\n\n     Regardless, the “stress of the work at that height had [him]\n\ndisoriented and dizzy. Id. He was already “nervous being that high\n\nin the air.” Id. All Rollins remembered was “turning around on the\n\nplatform, gripping the handrails, and then being on [his] back.” Id.\n\n     Q. So, you had a right hand on one handrail and a left hand\n        on the other.\n     A. Yes.\n     Q. While you were still standing on the platform, the floor.\n     A. Right.\n     Q. And then you proceeded to step down --\n     A. Yes.\n     Q. -- the first step? With your right foot or left foot?\n     A. I don't know was it my right or left, I can't recall.\n     Q. Were you able to step down on that step?\n     A. I stepped down, and when I stepped, I fell.\n     Q. How did you fall?\n\n\n                                   24\n\f     A. I just fell flat on my back, I don't know what happened, I\n        just fell.\n\n(CCR. 21:3619-3620).\n\n     THE ATTEMPT TO MANUFACTURE EVIDENCE OF “CONSCIOUSNESS”\n\n     In deposition, Texas College’s counsel repeatedly asked Rollins\n\nquestions which could be misconstrued.       When Rollins said he\n\nremembered “falling,” counsel attempted to make it seem as though\n\nthe witness was saying that he was conscious, but Rollins had to\n\ncorrect the effort of misdirection:\n\n     Q. Don't remember if you slipped.\n     A. No.\n     Q. Don't remember if you stumbled?\n     A. No.\n     Q. But you do remember falling down on the floor.\n     A. Yes.\n     Q. So, you were conscious the whole time.\n     A. I don't know if I was conscious or not. When I hit the\n        floor -- right at this time, I don't know what happened.\n     Q. But do you -- you recall falling down, right?\n     A. Yes.\n     Q. You don't recall -- I mean, you recall holding on and then\n        you fell down.\n     A. And that's all I remember.\n\n(CCR 4:313-314).\n\n\n\n\n                                      25\n\f     The testimony above makes it clear that Mr. Rollins lost\n\nconsciousness or most likely lost consciousness. Despite counsels’\n\ncontinued attempt to get Mr. Rollins to admit to consciousness\n\nduring the fall, the witness simply stated: that he remembered falling\n\n(as in being standing, then being on the ground) – not that he\n\nremembered the entire sequence of the fall.\n\n     This testimony was not clearly presented to the trial court, but\n\ninstead paraphrased: “Rollins has no explanation as to how he fell;;\n\njust that he fell.” See TC’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT, p. 2. (CCR\n\n4:250).\n\n     Ironically, when cross examined by counsel for MPF, the\n\nsyncope explanation becomes more likely:\n\n     Q. All right, Mr. Rollins. You testified that before the October\n        22nd incident you had an issue where you were driving\n        home and you started to black out; is that correct?\n     A. Yes.\n     Q. Okay. Is it a possibility that the day that you fell off the lift\n        that you blacked out and fell on it?\n     A. I really don’t know how to answer that because I really don’t\n        know what happened that day.\n     Q. (BY MR. GEDDIE) Okay. So you agree with me that that’s a\n        possibility that you blacked out that day.\n     A. Again, my response is I don’t know exactly what happened.\n     Q. Can you think of any reason why it could not be an\n        explanation for your fall that you blacked out?\n                                   26\n\f     A. No.\n\n(CCR 2:155-156) (emphasis added). Rollins explanation might be\n\nsimple, but it makes sense: “I shouldn't have been on it.”       (CCR\n\n4:317).\n\n     THE CONDITION OF THE LIFT AND TRAINING\n\n     The lift had been rented by Texas College from MPF.         (CCR\n\n5:469). According to Brackens, who signed off on the lift, there was\n\nno owner’s manual on board the lift.     (CCR 2:162). Mr. Bracken’s\n\ntestified that although he was given instruction on “how to operate”\n\nthe lift, he did not pass that training onto his subordinates:\n\n     Q. But you didn’t’ turn around and show or train your\n        subordinates how to operate it?\n     A. My subordinates had already been trained, because that is\n        not the first time that we had a scissor lift on the premises\n        and was used.\n     Q. And is proof of training kept in their personnel files?\n     A. No.\n     Q. Why?\n     A. That I can’t answer.\n\n(CCR 2:162).    Rollins swore that MFP (A-1) “did not offer us\n\ntraining” or “familiarize us with the lift.”          (CCR 25:4133)\n\n(emphasis added).    Mr. Harris, agreed that “untrained employees\n\nshouldn’t be on scissor lifts.” (CCR 7:863).\n\n\n\n\n                                  27\n\f     Rollins “hadn’t been trained” and “didn’t know how to operate\n\nit.) (CCR 25:4134). Rollins was “present outside the gym when A·1\n\nRent All delivered the scissor lift to Texas College.” (CCR 25:4143).\n\nHe “asked the delivery person if A·1 would bring the lift inside the\n\ngym and who was going to show [them] how to use it.” Id. “The A·1\n\nperson informed [Rollins] that he couldn't bring the lift indoors and\n\nthat the folks at Texas College knew how to use the lift.” Id. Rollins\n\nstated that “A-1 did not offer us training nor did it familiarize us with\n\nthe lift. The person from A·1 just came and delivered the machine\n\nand left.” Id.\n\n     When asked about what training could have made a difference,\n\nMr. Rollins testified as follows:\n\n     Q. Here's my question, and I'm trying to make sure that I'm\n        clear about it: What training could you have been given, if\n        any, if you know, that would have enabled you to get on the\n        lift or get off of it onto the floor any better than you did?\n     A. Any proper training that someone that already knew how to\n        use the lift or someone that already was licensed to use the\n        lift.\n     Q. (BY MR. YARBROUGH) Is that your answer?\n     A. Yes.\n     Q. And how would that specifically have helped you do\n        anything different?\n     A. Then I would have been trained to know how to use it and\n        to get on and off the proper way, operate it the proper way.\n\n                                    28\n\f        But it still -- I was still afraid to get on it, period; so, I\n        shouldn't have been on it.\n\n(CCR 4:316-317) (emphasis added).\n\n     THE INJURY\n\n     Mr. Rollins testified that as soon as he fell, he was “hurting” in\n\nthe “back of my neck.” (CCR 4:314). He had no prior complaints\n\nabout neck pain:\n\n     Q. Yeah. What I'm asking is after you recovered from the first\n        surgery to your neck, two months after that before the\n        incident at Texas College on October 22, 2013, had you\n        complained of pain in your neck\"?\n     A. No, I had not complained about pain in my neck.\n\n(CCR 4:318).\n\n     In his report to the trial court, Dr. Gilbert Martinez, noted the\n\nlink between the fall and Rollins’ neck injury:\n\n          Correspondence on July 18, 2014, by Dr. Barnett includes\n     the opinion that there was reasonable medical probability\n     that Mr. Rollins suffered an acute herniated disc at C4-C5\n     and spinal cord contusion caused by the fall on October 22,\n     2013, and that he would have chronic pain in his neck and\n     spinal cord dysfunction as a result of the injury.\n\nREPORT OF GILBERT MARTINEZ PHD (CCR 6:611). The photos are telling:\n\n\n\n\n                                  29\n\fREPORT   OF   JOE G. GONZALES, MD (CCR 6:674). Dr. Martinez’ Report\n\ncontinues:\n\n     3. Mr. Rollins will benefit from a comprehensive pain\n     management program with a focus on interventions designed to\n     reduce the effects of acute and chronic and pain. This should\n     include evaluation by a medical pain specialist who can\n     evaluate Mr. Rollins' potential for benefiting from medical\n     procedures designed to alleviating chronic pain, as well as\n     participation in various therapies designed to improve physical\n     and behavioral adjustment of individuals with chronic pain.\n     Such programs typically include a brief inpatient\n     hospitalization for initial evaluation, medication management,\n     and intensive therapy, followed by a more extended course of\n     outpatient therapy.\n     4. In addition to the effects of his physical problems, Mr. Rollins'\n     chronic reactive depression will contribute to his functional\n     disability and will have a negative impact on his long-term\n     vocational adjustment. Life care planning should account for\n     Mr. Rollins' significantly diminished occupational potential.\n                                  30\n\fREPORT OF GILBERT MARTINEZ, PHD (CCR 6:620). The prognosis if poor\n\nfor Gary Rollins:\n\n           Based on the known medical conditions, Mr. Gary L.\n     Rollins will have lifelong, progressive symptoms, physical\n     impairment and subsequent disability which will require long-\n     term medical care.\n\nREPORT OF JOE G GONZALES, MD (CCR 6:628).\n\n                    SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n\n     When one seeks to win by excluding key evidence on the basis\n\nof strategic, technical grounds, one must live and die by the technical\n\nand strategic failures of one’s own motions. Rather than argue the\n\nmerits of this case, Texas College and MPF launched a technical war\n\nand jointly attempted to eliminate all relevant testimony, affidavits,\n\nexpert reports, operating manuals, and relevant medical records from\n\nthe record. Instead, they failed to convince the court to strike key\n\nparts of Rollins’ Affidavit, they lost a key battle over Doctor Reports\n\nwhich they introduced and referenced without objection, and they\n\nactually introduced the majority of the testimony which proves their\n\nown liability.\n\n\n\n\n                                  31\n\f     Moreover, many of the evidentiary objections were simply\n\nwithout merit.    If revisited by this Court, even more summary\n\njudgment evidence supporting appellants’ claims will surface.\n\n     Finally, even on the remote chance more evidence is needed,\n\nthis Court should reverse the trial courts denial of the motion to re-\n\nopen the evidence.\n\n                            ARGUMENT\n\n\n\n1.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n     The function of summary judgment is to eliminate patently\n\nunmeritorious claims and defenses, not to deprive litigants of the\n\nright to a jury trial. City of Houston v. Clear Creek Basin Auth., 589\n\nS.W.2d 671, 678 n. 5 (Tex.1979); Swilley v. Hughes, 488 S.W.2d 64,\n\n68 (Tex.1972).\n\n     Recently in Wylie v. Hide-A-Way Lake Club, Inc., No. 12-12-\n\n00290-CV, 2013 WL 6797871, at *7-8 (Tex. App. Tyler, Dec. 20,\n\n2013), review denied (Aug. 22, 2014) this Honorable Court\n\nsummarized the standard of review for a case similar to this, which\n\ninvolved both traditional and no-evidence summary judgments.\n\n     TRADITIONAL MOTION STANDARD\n\n                                 32\n\f     In Wylie, this Court cited the authority and set forth the\n\nstandard:\n\n           The movant for traditional summary judgment has the\n     burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of material\n     fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Tex.R.\n     Civ. P. 166a(c); Nixon, 690 S.W.2d at 548. When the movant\n     seeks summary judgment on a claim in which the nonmovant\n     bears the burden of proof, the movant must either negate at\n     least one essential element of the nonmovant's cause of\n     action or prove all essential elements of an affirmative defense.\n     See Randall's Food Mkt., Inc. v. Johnson, 891 S.W.2d 640, 644\n     (Tex.1995). When the movant seeks summary judgment on a\n     claim in which the movant bears the burden of proof, the\n     movant must prove all essential elements of the claim. Winchek\n     v. Am. Express Travel Related Servs. Co., 232 S.W.3d 197, 201\n     (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, no pet.). Once the movant\n     has established a right to summary judgment, the burden\n     shifts to the nonmovant to respond to the motion and\n     present to the trial court any issues that would preclude\n     summary judgment. See City of Houston v. Clear Creek Basin\n     Auth., 589 S.W.2d 671, 678–79 (Tex.1979).\n\nId. at *7 (emphasis added).     “In determining whether there is a\n\ngenuine fact issue precluding summary judgment, evidence\n\nfavorable to the non-movant is taken as true and we make all\n\nreasonable inferences in his favor.” Hernandez v. Brinker Int'l, Inc.,\n\n285 S.W.3d 152, 163 (Tex. App. 2009) (emphasis added). Elements\n\nof the action must be “conclusively” negated in order for the\n\ndefendants to prevail. Id. (emphasis added).     Any doubts are to be\n\n\n\n                                  33\n\fresolved in the non-movant’s favor.           Nixon v. Mr. Property\n\nManagement, 690 S.W.2d 546, 548–49 (Tex.1985).\n\n     As will be shown here, even if one removes from consideration\n\nall of the stricken evidence, there is still a genuine issue of material\n\nfact as to Duty, Breach of Duty and Causation against each\n\ndefendant.\n\n     NO EVIDENCE MOTION STANDARD\n\n     In Wylie, this Court’s explanation of the no-evidence standard\n\nwas equally complete:\n\n           Once a no evidence motion has been filed in accordance\n     with Rule 166a(i), the burden shifts to the nonmovant to bring\n     forth evidence that raises a fact issue on the challenged\n     evidence. See Ford Motor Co. v. Ridgway, 135 S.W.3d 598, 600\n     (Tex.2004). We review a no evidence motion for summary\n     judgment under the same legal sufficiency standards as a\n     directed verdict. King Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman, 118 S.W.3d\n     742, 750–51 (Tex.2003). A no evidence motion is properly\n     granted if the nonmovant fails to bring forth more than a\n     scintilla of probative evidence to raise a genuine issue of\n     material fact as to an essential element of the nonmovant's\n     claim on which the nonmovant would have the burden of proof\n     at trial. Id. at 751. If the evidence supporting a finding rises to\n     a level that would enable reasonable, fair minded persons to\n     differ in their conclusions, then more than a scintilla of\n     evidence exists. Id. Less than a scintilla of evidence exists when\n     the evidence is so weak as to do no more than create a mere\n     surmise or suspicion of a fact, and the legal effect is that there\n     is no evidence. Id.\n\n\n\n                                  34\n\fId. These facts do “more than create a mere surmise of suspicion” of\n\na negligence claim.\n\n     ORDER OF CONSIDERATION\n\n     This Court continued in Wylie to explain the proper order of\n\nconsideration of the issues:\n\n     In both traditional and no evidence summary judgment\n     motions, we review the entire record de novo and in the light\n     most favorable to the nonmovant, INDULGING EVERY\n     REASONABLE INFERENCE AND RESOLVING ANY DOUBTS\n     AGAINST THE MOTION. See Sudan v. Sudan, 199 S.W.3d 291,\n     292 (Tex.2006); KPMG Peat Marwick v. Harrison Cnty. Hous. Fin.\n     Corp., 988 S.W.2d 746, 748 (Tex.1999). All theories in support\n     of or in opposition to a motion for summary judgment must be\n     presented in writing to the trial court. See Tex.R. Civ. P. 166a(c).\n     If the trial court's order does not specify the grounds on which\n     it granted summary judgment, we affirm the trial court's ruling\n     if any of the theories advanced in the motion is meritorious.\n     State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. S.S., 858 S.W.2d 374, 380\n     (Tex.1993).\n           Moreover, when a party moves for both a traditional and a\n     no evidence summary judgment, generally, we first review the\n     trial court's summary judgment under the no evidence\n     standards of Rule 166a(i). Ridgway, 135 S.W.3d at 600. If the\n     no evidence summary judgment was properly granted, we do\n     not reach arguments made under the traditional motion for\n     summary judgment. See id. at 602.\n\nId. at *8 (emphasis added). Here, appellant will show that under the\n\ncurrent law there is substantial evidence of the elements of the\n\nclaims.   In doing so, the showing will also defeat any summary\n\njudgment on traditional grounds.\n\n                                  35\n\f     MOTION TO RE-OPEN EVIDENCE\n\n     A motion to re-open the evidence is reviewed under an abuse of\n\ndiscretion standard. In re Prot. of H.W., 85 S.W.3d 348, 358 (Tex.\n\nApp. Tyler 2002).    In the case of In re Prot. of H.W., this Court\n\nindicated a primary consideration when it stated: “…the trial judge\n\nshould liberally exercise his discretion to permit both sides to\n\nfully develop their case. Id. (citing Lifestyle Mobile Homes v. Ricks,\n\n653 S.W.2d 602, 604 (Tex. App.-Beaumont 1983, writ ref'd n.r.e.))\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n     As will be shown, the trial court here did the opposite. It struck\n\nevidence on dubious technical grounds and refused to allow\n\ncorrection of the “alleged” defects. This precluded the parties from\n\nfully developing the case.\n\n     SCOPE OF EVIDENCE\n\n     On February 19, 2015 the trial court issued 6 orders on six\n\nintertwined matters: Texas College’s two motions for summary\n\njudgment, appellees joint motion to strike the designations and\n\nreports of Dr. Martinez (psychologist), Dr. Gonzales (medical doctor)\n\nand Thomas Roney (economist);; MPF’s motion to strike the\n\ndesignation and testimony of Burt Thorpe (aerial lift equipment\n\n                                 36\n\fexpert);; Texas College’s motion to strike evidence;; and MPF’s\n\nobjections to evidence.\n\n     When a trial court sets a single hearing for multiple intertwined\n\nmotions, the court is free to consider the evidence together. It may\n\nconsider evidence advanced by one party in one motion, to support a\n\nmotion or response by another party. In Rea v. Cofer, 879 S.W.2d\n\n224 (Tex. App. 1994) the appellant had asserted the discovery rule.\n\nAppellees’ motion for summary judgment, failed to even address the\n\nissue.     Nevertheless the Court of Appeals determined that the\n\nomission was not fatal, “because the proof necessary to negate the\n\ndiscovery rule was contained in [another party’s] motion for summary\n\njudgment on file with the court.” Id. at 228. The Rea court cited\n\nDesiga v. Scheffey, 874 S.W.2d 244 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n1994, n.w.h.) in which the court held that when a trial court sets a\n\nsingle hearing for multiple motions for summary judgment, the court\n\nmay look to other proof on file with the court to determine any of the\n\nmotions.     In a particularly instructive passage, the Desiga court\n\nstated:\n\n          However, in view of the unique circumstances of this case,\n     we find this omission to be not fatal as to Dr. Guerrero's\n     summary judgment for the following reasons. Only one hearing\n\n                                  37\n\f      was set for the judge to rule on all of the motions. All of the\n      motions were heard at the same time, January 22, 1993 at 9\n      a.m. At the same hearing, the trial court heard all of the\n      arguments in support of the various motions. The trial court\n      granted summary judgment for all appellees the same day. In\n      the unique facts and circumstances of this case, to find\n      otherwise would place the trial court in a position of having\n      to engage in the ARTIFICE OF IGNORING Mr. Desiga's\n      deposition testimony which was otherwise on file with the\n      court in the form of the other appellees' motions for summary\n      judgment.\n\nId. at 253 (emphasis added).     The Desiga court noted the Texas\n\nSupreme Court’s increasing leniency with regard to summary\n\njudgment evidence:\n\n            We find support for this holding in the Texas Supreme\n      Court’s recent demonstrations of increasing leniency in the\n      areas of both summary judgment proceedings in general and\n      summary judgment evidence specifically. See McConathy v.\n      McConathy, 869 S.W.2d 341, 341 (Tex.1994) (holding\n      deposition excerpts used as summary judgment evidence need\n      not be authenticated to be considered competent summary\n      judgment proof); Mafrige v. Ross, 866 S.W.2d 590, 590\n      (Tex.1993) (holding parties may make otherwise unappealable\n      order final simply by adding “Mother Hubbard” language in the\n      order). Such a holding with regard to Dr. Guerrero is in effect\n      acknowledging the trial court's capacity to take judicial\n      notice of those documents on file with it at the time of a\n      hearing on a motion for summary judgment. The other parties'\n      motions for summary judgment having been duly filed with the\n      trial court for its consideration constituted part of the record\n      before it.\n\nId.\n\n\n\n\n                                  38\n\f     In addition, both orders of summary judgment contained\n\nlanguage expanding the scope of evidence far beyond the confines of\n\nrule 166a to “any additional briefing accepted by the court.”\n\n(CCR 24:3935 and 24:3938).      Thus, this Court need not engage in\n\nthe “artifice of ignoring” the evidence that was before the trial court\n\nat the time of the February 19th rulings. It may consider all of the\n\nevidence presented by all the parties together, when deciding the fate\n\nof any particular motion.\n\n2.   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GRANTING TEXAS\n     COLLEGE’S TRADITIONAL AND NO EVIDENCE MOTION\n     FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n\n     Because the trial court did not hold oral argument and because\n\nits orders are silent as to any reasoning, this brief will examine the\n\nrationale behind appellees’ motions.\n\n     NATURE OF CLAIMS INVOLVED\n\n     Texas College’s motion is chock full of inapplicable premises\n\nliability cases, as well as cases in which there was no evidence of\n\nunusual danger.     Here, there is a singular sterling difference\n\nbetween the facts of this case and the facts of any case cited in\n\nsupport of Texas College’s motion. It is the truly insane and\n\nspiteful order for Rollins to “get up there” and finish the work.\n\n                                  39\n\fThe order was given despite both Brackens and Harris knowing that\n\nRollins was “unfit” for the job due to his “black-out” spells. Appellee’s\n\nmotions would have this court adopt the standard of liability provided\n\nby Harris in his deposition:\n\n     Q. So, you're now going to testify -- or are you testifying now\n        that if a manager knows that an employee is suffering\n        from seizures, the employee should get on the scissor\n        lift if the manager says get up there and do it, is that\n        what you're telling me?\n     B. Yes.\n\n(CCR 7:868). This is not the law. It should not be the law. None of\n\nthe cases cited in the motions involve the commanding of an\n\nemployee to do a knowingly unsafe act – an act which is not unsafe\n\nbecause of a premises condition – but is unsafe because the plaintiff\n\nwas physically “unfit” for the job – he had fainting spells.\n\n     This is not a premises liability case.         The only place in\n\nappellants’ pleadings which the word “premises” appears is the\n\nprayer: “WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Plaintiffs pray….”\n\n(CCR 498-505, 8th Amended) (CCR 92-101, 7th Amended) (CCR 83-\n\n91, 6th Amended). This case involves active and grossly negligent\n\nsupervision. As to Texas College, Rollins plead:\n\n         Defendant's failure to: 1) provide a reasonably safe\n     workplace; 2) furnish reasonably safe machinery or reasonably\n\n                                   40\n\f        safe personal protective equipment for use with the Lift and for\n        use in lifting the marble slab counter top; 3) provide adequate\n        help in the performance of work; 4) train and/or properly\n        supervise Plaintiff Garry Rollins while using the Lift and lifting\n        the marble slab counter top; and 5) to ensure that Plaintiff\n        Garry Rollins was fit to perform work on a scissor lift.\n7TH AMENDED PETITION (CCR 1:96) (emphasis added).\n        THE ELEMENTS AND THE EVIDENCE\n\n  1. Duty and Breach of Duty\n\n        Tex. Labor Code Ann. § 406.033 eliminates significant defenses\n\nin nonsubscriber cases such as this. The provision reads in pertinent\n\npart:\n\n        “… it is not a defense that:\n             (1) the employee was guilty of contributory negligence;\n             (2) the employee assumed the risk of injury or death;\n        or\n              (3) the injury or death was caused by the negligence of a\n        fellow employee.\n\nId. (emphasis added). The Texas Supreme Court also reaffirmed that\n\ncomparative negligence may not be submitted in a nonsubscriber\n\ncase. See Kroger Co. v. Keng, 23 S.W.3d 347, 352-53 (Tex. 2000) (“We\n\ntherefore hold that a nonsubscribing employer is not entitled to a jury\n\nquestion on its employee's alleged comparative responsibility.)\n\n        Texas College’s motion focused primarily on the lack of duty to\n\nwarn of dangers which an employee already appreciates. This theory\n                                       41\n\fmight have been applicable had Rollins plead “failure to warn.” He\n\ndid not.\n\n     Texas College made extensive use of Kroger Co. v. Elwood, 197\n\nS.W.3d 793, 794 (Tex. 2006.) See TEXAS COLLEGE MOTION FOR SUMMARY\n\nJUDGMENT (CCR 4:249-271). Elwood was a near frivolous case, with\n\nlittle in common to the instant case:\n\n           Billy Elwood, a courtesy clerk at a Kroger grocery store,\n     was injured when a customer shut her vehicle door on his\n     hand while he was transferring items from a grocery cart to the\n     vehicle. Elwood had placed one hand in the vehicle's\n     doorjamb, and one foot on the cart, to keep the cart from\n     rolling down a slope in Kroger's parking lot.\n\nElwood, 197 S.W.3d at 794 (emphasis added). But even in Elwood\n\nthe Court acknowledge the concept of “duty.” Albeit lengthy, the\n\nfollowing passage from Elwood and its highlighted language shows\n\nwhy its holding and the holdings of similar cases do not apply here:\n\n           An employer has a DUTY TO USE ORDINARY CARE in\n     providing a safe workplace. Farley v. M M Cattle Co., 529\n     S.W.2d 751, 754 (Tex.1975). IT MUST, for example, warn an\n     employee of the hazards of employment and PROVIDE NEEDED\n     safety equipment or ASSISTANCE. Id. However, an employer\n     is not an insurer of its employees' safety. Leitch v. Hornsby, 935\n     S.W.2d 114, 117 (Tex.1996); Exxon Corp. v. Tidwell, 867 S.W.2d\n     19, 21 (Tex.1993). It owes NO DUTY to WARN of hazards that\n     are commonly known or already appreciated by the\n     employee. See Nat'l Convenience *795 Stores, Inc. v. Matherne,\n     987 S.W.2d 145, 149 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1999, no\n     pet.). It has NO DUTY to provide equipment or ASSISTANCE\n\n                                 42\n\fTHAT IS UNNECESSARY to the job's safe performance. See\nAllsup's Convenience Stores, Inc. v. Warren, 934 S.W.2d 433,\n438 (Tex.App.—Amarillo 1996, writ denied). And, when an\nemployee's injury results from performing the same character\nof work that employees in that position have always done, an\nemployer is not liable if there is NO EVIDENCE THAT THE\nWORK IS UNUSUALLY PRECARIOUS. Werner, 909 S.W.2d at\n869 (citing Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co. v. Evans, 142 Tex. 1, 175\nS.W.2d 249, 251 (1943)).\n      In this case, there is no evidence that loading groceries on\nthe sloped portion of Kroger's parking lot is an unusually\ndangerous job, nor is there evidence that other courtesy clerks\nsustained similar injuries while loading groceries on the sloped\nlot. Indeed, loading purchases into vehicles is a task\nperformed regularly—without any special training or\nassistance—by customers throughout the grocery and retail\nindustry. While there is evidence that grocery carts had rolled\ninto vehicles due to the parking lot's slope and may have posed\na foreseeable risk of damage to customers' vehicles, this is no\nevidence that the slope posed a foreseeable risk of injury to\nKroger's employees. Elwood presented NO EVIDENCE that his\nJOB REQUIRED SPECIALIZED TRAINING. See Nat'l\nConvenience Stores, 987 S.W.2d at 149. Elwood testified that,\nprior to working at Kroger, he knew it was dangerous to place\nhis hand in a vehicle's doorjamb. Moreover, there is NO\nEVIDENCE that carts with wheel locks or ADDITIONAL\nPERSONNEL WERE NECESSARY to safely load groceries. See\nAllsup's Convenience Stores, 934 S.W.2d at 438.\n      Kroger had no duty to warn Elwood of a danger known to\nall and NO OBLIGATION TO provide training or equipment to\nDISSUADE an employee from using a vehicle doorjamb for\nleverage. Employers are not insurers of their employees. See\nLeitch, 935 S.W.2d at 117; Exxon Corp., 867 S.W.2d at 21.\nAccordingly, without hearing oral argument, we reverse the\ncourt of appeals' judgment and render judgment for Kroger. See\nTEX. R. APP. P. 59.1, 60.2(c).\n\n\n\n                            43\n\fId. at 794-95 (Tex. 2006) (emphasis added). The highlighted matters\n\nare discussed below:\n\n             a) Ordinary Care\n\n     First and foremost:      Is there really any doubt that a\n\nsupervisor who knows his employee is having “black outs” is not\n\nexercising “ordinary care” when he instructs that employee to\n\n“get up there” in a scissor lift and patch the gym ceiling? Mr.\n\nElwood’s supervisors did not tell him to “get over there and put your\n\nhand in the door jamb.”\n\n             b) Duty to provide assistance\n\n     Second, the facts here show that Texas College breached the\n\nduty to provide assistance.   Recall that on October 21st Brackens\n\ntold Rollins that he “had to GET UP THERE and get it done.\" (CCR\n\n4:303) (emphasis added). But Rollins had safely gotten off the lift\n\nand directed his assistants do the work. He “…stayed up there about\n\nfive minutes on the 21st showing him what needed to be done, and\n\nhim and a community service finished off.”       (CCR 4:297).    Mr.\n\nBrackens had been apparently upset by that fact.       So later that\n\nafternoon “…Mr. Bracket [sic] had told them that [Rollins] said [he]\n\nwasn’t going to get up there and do it….” (CCR 4:298). So, once\n\n                                 44\n\fagain, Rollins was ordered to get up there. “That was on a Monday\n\nwhen Mr. Harris direct me Tuesday morning GET UP THERE and\n\nget it done.” (CCR 4:309) (emphasis added). Rather than let Rollins\n\nuse the assistance of his subordinates to do the patching, as he was\n\nattempting to do on the 21st, Brackens and Harris got mad about it,\n\nand ordered him personally to “get up there” on the 22nd. They made\n\nthe order, knowing he had been having “black outs.” The evidence\n\nshows without a doubt that Texas College breached the duty to\n\nprovide needed assistance as set forth in Elwood.\n\n             c) No Duty to Warn\n\n     Here, Rollins is not complaining that Texas College should have\n\nwarned him of something he already knew (that it was dangerous for\n\nhim to get on the lift in his condition). He certainly knew that. He is\n\ncomplaining that despite the fact that his employer also knew it, the\n\nemployer ordered him to take the risk he did not want to take. This\n\nis not a “failure to warn” case. It is an “ordered to do it” case –\n\ninvolving active and gross negligence.\n\n     Very recently, the Texas Supreme Court answered questions\n\nwhich had been certified to it by the United States Court of Appeal\n\nfor the Fifth Circuit. In the case of Austin v. Kroger Texas, L.P., 465\n\n                                  45\n\fS.W.3d 193 (Tex. 2015), the Texas Supreme Court surveyed the\n\nlandscape of cases relating to employer duty in non-subscriber cases.\n\nAlthough most of the opinion deals with questions of liability relating\n\nto premises defects, the Court mentioned an exception to the “no-\n\nduty” rule in premises cases, which has at least some logical bearing\n\nhere:\n\n             Instead, the Court's abolition of the no-duty rule should\n        play a role only when an exception to the general rule applies—\n        that is, when the nonsubscribing employer owes a duty\n        despite the obviousness or employee's appreciation of a\n        danger because, despite the awareness of the danger, it is\n        necessary that the employee use the dangerous premises and\n        the employer should anticipate that THE EMPLOYEE IS\n        UNABLE TO TAKE MEASURES TO AVOID THE RISK. In such\n        cases, the employer cannot rely on the fact that the risk\n        was obvious and known to the employee to argue that the\n        employee bears some portion of the responsibility for his\n        own injuries, because the TWCA waives those defenses.\n        Compare Del Lago, 307 S.W.3d at 772–73; Parker, 565 S.W.2d\n        at 520, with Tex. Lab. Code § 406.033(a); Keng, 23 S.W.3d at\n        352.\n\nId. at 210 (emphasis added). Here there is active negligence, but even\n\nif it were a premises case, it would be excepted from the no-duty to\n\nwarn rule, because Rollins, being ordered to “get up there,” was\n\n“unable to take measures to avoid the risk.”       Once he obeys the\n\n\n\n\n                                   46\n\fmaster’s orders, the risk is unavoidable. He is up high, in harm’s\n\nway, subject to “blacking out.”\n\n             d) Negligent Supervision, Negligent Training\n\n     In addition, as the Texas Supreme Court noted in Austin:\n\n           Thus, when a claim does not result from contemporaneous\n     activity, the invitee has no negligent-activity claim, and his\n     claim sounds exclusively in premises-liability. See Shumake,\n     199 S.W.3d at 284; Keetch, 845 S.W.2d at 265.\n          But when the landowner is also an employer and the\n     invitee is also its employee, this additional relationship\n     may give rise to additional duties, such as a DUTY TO\n     PROVIDE NECESSARY EQUIPMENT, TRAINING, OR\n     SUPERVISION. …..\n            When an injury arises from a premises condition, it is often\n     the case that any resulting claim sounds exclusively in premises\n     liability, but that is not necessarily the case. An injury can have\n     more than one proximate cause. Del Lago, 307 S.W.3d at 774;\n     Lee Lewis Constr., Inc. v. Harrison, 70 S.W.3d 778, 784\n     (Tex.2001). The fact that Austin alleged that a condition of\n     the premises proximately caused his injury does not\n     preclude his allegation that Kroger's negligent failure to\n     provide the Spill Magic system also caused his injury. If the\n     only relationship between Austin and Kroger were that of\n     landowner–invitee, the alleged facts could only give rise to a\n     premises-liability claim. …..\n          AS AUSTIN'S EMPLOYER, KROGER OWED AUSTIN\n     duties in addition to its premises-liability duty and ITS\n     DUTY NOT TO ENGAGE IN NEGLIGENT ACTIVITIES,\n     including the duty to provide Austin with necessary\n     instrumentalities.\n\n\n\n\n                                  47\n\fId. at 215-16 (emphasis added). Here, there is not even an allegation\n\nof premises liability, such as in Austin. But it is clear that the Texas\n\nSupreme Court acknowledges the duties owed in this case.\n\n     The evidence of negligent supervision is glaring.    Not only did\n\nHarris and Brackens give Rollins a foolish order to “get up there”\n\n(CCR 4:303, 4:309), Brackens admitted that he had “leadership and\n\nauthority” problems (CCR 4:344). He had even suggested they put a\n\nladder on the platform to reach even higher. (CCR 4:303-304). This\n\nis a textbook “reasonable person” failure.\n\n     As far as negligent training, Brackens admitted that he did not\n\npass the training he received on to his subordinates. (CCR 3:162).\n\n(CCR 25:4133). Rollins “hadn’t been trained” and “didn’t know how\n\nto operate it.) (CCR 25:4134) Mr. Harris, agreed that “untrained\n\nemployees shouldn’t be on scissor lifts.” (CCR 7:863).\n\n             e) No Duty to Provide Unnecessary Assistance\n\n     This statement in Elwood is a non-sequitur.           Who needs\n\n“unnecessary” assistance? Here, to avoid undue risk, the assistance\n\nRollins wanted was necessary.       It is not outlandish to require a\n\nsupervisor with knowledge of the risk that one of his employees may\n\nsuddenly fall, to provide assistance and prevent it. See e.g.\n\n                                  48\n\fMcEachern v. Glenview Hosp., Inc., 505 S.W.2d 386 (Tex. Civ. App.\n\n1974), writ refused NRE (June 12, 1974). In McEachern, the Court of\n\nAppeals reversed and rendered a verdict for the plaintiff because it\n\nwas reasonably foreseeable that a patient who was on table in\n\nemergency room of hospital might faint as result of psychogenic\n\nshock, or some similar event, and that the hospital was under duty\n\nto have someone in attendance with patient and keep proper lookout\n\nfor his safety.)\n\n              f) No evidence that the work is unusually\n                 precarious\n\n     This statement in Elwood distinguishes the case quickly.\n\nElwood, involved loading groceries on the sloped portion of Kroger's\n\nparking lot – “a task performed regularly—without any special\n\ntraining or assistance—by customers.” Elwood, 197 S.W.3d at\n\n795. Here, there is no indication that untrained students were using\n\nthe scissor lift regularly. It goes without saying that elevating one’s\n\nself to the top of a gymnasium ceiling on a “scissor lift” is precarious.\n\n\n\n\n                                   49\n\f     (CCR 21:3467)\n\n               g) No evidence that the job required specialized\n                  training\n\n     Here, again the case facts are opposite Elwood. Even Mr. Harris\n\nsaid that that “untrained employees shouldn’t be on scissor lifts.”\n\n(CCR 7:863).\n\n               h) No evidence that additional personnel were\n                  necessary\n\n     Once again, this case is different from Elwood. Here, Rollins\n\nused additional personnel on the 21st without incident, and let them\n\nfinish the work. (CCR 4:297). But on the 22d, the order of “get up\n\n\n\n\n                                 50\n\fthere” forced him upon the lift, when using his subordinates would\n\nbe the safer choice.\n\n             i) No obligation to dissuade\n\n     Finally, this case is different from Elwood and its companions\n\nin that Rollins’ superiors were commanding him to take the\n\ndangerous action. They were not watching him do it on his own and\n\nfailing to “dissuade” him. They were “persuading” him to do it under\n\nthreat of insubordination and possible termination. As the Texas\n\nSupreme Court Stated in Austin: “an employee always has the option\n\nto decline to perform an assigned task and incur the consequences\n\nof that decision.” 465 S.W.3d at 214 (citing in jest, the long abrogated\n\nMcKee v. Patterson, 153 Tex. 517, 525, 271 S.W.2d 391 (1954)\n\nabrogated by Parker v. Highland Park, Inc., 565 S.W.2d 512 (Tex.\n\n1978)). Even McKee recognized that its “no duty” rule had limits:\n\n           This extreme common law view, which traded on the\n     economic necessity of the workman to earn a living, resulted in\n     the adoption of Liability and Compensation Acts to offer a\n     measure of certain protection to the workman. The plaintiff here\n     collected benefits under the Workmen's Compensation Act,\n     Vernon's Ann.Civ.St. art. 8306 et seq. In cases where\n     legislation has not abolished the defense of assumed risk,\n     the common law rule still prevails in this country in master\n     and servant relationships.\n\nId. at 396 (emphasis added).\n\n                                  51\n\f     In sum, the trial court either misread or misapplied the law and\n\nfacts on the concept of “duty.” There are several duties which apply\n\nhere: 1) the exercise of ordinary care; 2) the duty to provide\n\nassistance; 3) the duty to provide adequate supervision; and 4) the\n\nduty to provide proper training. Texas College commanded Rollins to\n\n“get up there” without any training, and more importantly, while\n\nknowing he had been suffering “black-outs.”         This simple act\n\nbreached all of these duties.\n\n  2. Proximate Cause\n\n             a) Generally\n\n     In Kroger Co. v. Milanes, No. 14-13-00873-CV, 2015 WL\n\n4594098 (Tex. App. July 30, 2015) the Court affirmed a lower court\n\njudgment against the employer and summarized the requirements of\n\ncausation in a non-subscriber case:\n\n          Proximate cause consists of two elements: cause in fact\n     and foreseeability. Del Lago Partners, Inc., 307 S.W.3d at 774.\n          Cause in fact means that the defendant's act or\n     omission was a substantial factor in bringing about the\n     injury, which would not otherwise have occurred. Western\n     Investments, Inc. v. Urena, 162 S.W.3d 547, 551 (Tex.2005).\n     Cause in fact is not shown if the defendant's conduct did no\n     more than furnish a condition that made the injury possible. Id.\n     The second element of proximate cause, foreseeability,\n     requires that a person of ordinary intelligence should have\n     anticipated the danger created by the negligent act or\n\n                                 52\n\f     omission. Doe v. Boys Clubs of Greater Dallas, Inc., 907 S.W.2d\n     472, 478 (Tex.1995). These elements cannot be established by\n     mere conjecture, guess, or speculation. Id. at 477. Proximate\n     cause may, however, be established by direct or\n     circumstantial evidence and the reasonable inferences\n     drawn from that evidence. Pilgrim's Pride Corp. v. Smoak, 134\n     S.W.3d 880, 889 (Tex.App.–Texarkana 2004, pet. denied) (citing\n     McClure v. Allied Stores of Texas, Inc., 608 S.W.2d 901, 903\n     (Tex.1980)).\n\nId. at *11 (emphasis added).\n\n     The negligent order was the cause in fact of the fall. Here it was\n\nmore than a substantial factor in causing Mr. Rollins to fall. Mr.\n\nRollins swore that he “would not have gotten on the lift” but for the\n\norder by Brackens and Harris. (CCR 25:4134).      By simple logic, the\n\nfall would not have occurred had he not been ordered to “get up\n\nthere.”\n\n     The accident was foreseeable here.      It simply defies logic to\n\nbelieve that Brackens should not have foreseen the possibility of\n\nRollins falling. Rollins informed both Harris and Brackens that he\n\n“was now having dizziness and blackout spells.” ROLLINS AFFIDAVIT\n\n(CCR 25:4132).    They had removed him from driving duty (CCR\n\n25:4132), presumably to prevent an accident.\n\n     Certainly an order to engage in a negligent activity can be the\n\nproximate cause of an accident.    In Halliburton Oil Well Cementing\n\n                                  53\n\fCo. v. Groves, 308 S.W.2d 919 (Tex. Civ. App. 1957), writ refused\n\nNRE, the court found that a supervisor’s negligent direction to an\n\nemployee to apply an excessive “pull” on some tubing was a\n\n“proximate cause” of the crown block breaking – an event which killed\n\nthe employee.     Id. at 933.     Similarly, an order to “get up there”\n\nknowing the possibility of a black out, can be the proximate cause of\n\na fall.\n\n              b) Medical Causation\n\n      It is assumed that Appellees worked so hard at the trial court\n\nlevel to exclude the doctor’s reports because they knew they needed\n\nto defeat Rollins on the issue of medical causation.        They tried\n\nmightily to eliminate proof that the fall caused Rollins’ neck injury.\n\nBut they succeeded only in excluding the letter from Rollins’ treating\n\nphysician Samuel Barnett, MD. They did this by convincing the lower\n\ncourt that the letter had not been properly authenticated. However,\n\nit was properly authenticated as will be shown below in the next\n\nargument. Nonetheless, there are two reasons why excluding Dr.\n\nBarnett’s letter is irrelevant.\n\n      First, in a personal injury and fall case, lay testimony on\n\ninjury causation is sufficient:\n\n                                    54\n\f           …non-expert evidence may be sufficient to support a\n     finding of causation in cases where both the occurrence and the\n     medical conditions complained of are such that the general\n     experience and common sense of lay persons are sufficient to\n     evaluate the conditions and whether they were probably caused\n     by the occurrence.\nCity of Dallas v. Furgason, 05-06-00875-CV, 2007 WL 2703134, at\n\n*1 (Tex. App.—Dallas Sept. 18, 2007, no pet.). Texas law is replete\n\nwith cases on the topic. See e.g. Morgan v. Compugraphic Corp., 675\n\nS.W.2d 729, 733 (Tex. 1984) (temporal connection to time of exposure\n\nand physical proximity to fumes per testimony of plaintiff was\n\ncompetent evidence that her alleged injuries were caused by the\n\nrelease of chemicals.); Figueroa v. Davis, 318 S.W.3d 53, 61 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2010, no pet.) (plaintiff’s testimony about\n\nbroken teeth after car accident sufficient); Cotton Patch Cafe v.\n\nMcCarty, 2-05-082-CV, 2006 WL 563307, at *3 (Tex. App.—Fort\n\nWorth Mar. 9, 2006, no pet.) (trip and fall case with plaintiff\n\ntestimony about injuries and doctor visits sufficient); Dawson v.\n\nBriggs, 107 S.W.3d 739, 754 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2003, no pet.)\n\n(plaintiff’s lay testimony about jaw problems after wreck was\n\nsufficient).\n\n     In Grey Wolf Drilling Co., L.P. v. Boutte, 154 S.W.3d 725, 744\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2004), review granted, judgment\n                                55\n\fvacated, and remanded by agreement (Mar. 4, 2005) the court stated\n\nthat lay testimony which establishes a sequence of events\n\nproviding a “strong, logically traceable connection between the\n\nevent and the condition is sufficient proof of causation.”\n\n     Here, Rollins’ affidavit indicated that as a result of the accident\n\nhe “ended up having to have major surgery.” (CCR 25:4134). Rollins’\n\naffidavit also indicates that immediately after the fall, he “could not\n\nmove at first” and “eventually” rolled over onto his feet.        (CCR\n\n25:4134). Rollins described the fall as “I just fell flat on my back and\n\nmy neck.” (CCR 4:311).     Dr. Barnett’s surgery discharge summary\n\nin the medical records filed by Texas College shows that his major\n\nneck surgery happened on October 26, just a few days after the\n\nOctober 22nd fall. (CCR 8:1050). The records also indicate a primary\n\ndiagnoses of “syncope and collapse.” (CCR 8:983). Certainly this is a\n\nstrong, logically traceable connection between the event and the\n\ncondition.\n\n     Second, the attempt at excluding the Dr. Reports failed. The\n\ntrial court denied the motion to strike them, and they contained the\n\nvery same information appellees were seeking to exclude by keeping\n\nout the Barnett letter. The disclosure responses which incorporated\n\n                                  56\n\fthe reports, were specifically used as summary judgment evidence.\n\n(CCR 2:109) (See reference to summary judgment exhibit “H” -\n\nPlaintiffs' Fifth Supplemental Responses to Requests for Disclosure.).\n\nThe language of the reports leaves little doubt as to medical\n\ncausation:\n\n          Correspondence on July 18, 2014, by Dr. Barnett includes\n     the opinion that there was reasonable medical probability\n     that Mr. Rollins suffered an acute herniated disc at C4-C5\n     and spinal cord contusion caused by the fall on October 22,\n     2013, and that he would have chronic pain in his neck and\n     spinal cord dysfunction as a result of the injury.\n\nREPORT OF GILBERT MARTINEZ PHD (CCR 6:611).\n\n     In summary, there is ample evidence of duty, breach of duty,\n\nand causation. It was all still before the court after the onslaught of\n\nexclusionary rulings.   The summary judgment granted in favor of\n\nTexas College should be reversed.\n\n     ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE WAS IMPROPERLY STRICKEN\n\n     Even if one assumes that somehow more evidence is needed to\n\ndefeat Texas College’s summary judgment motion, more evidence can\n\nbe considered (see argument, infra). The trial court made numerous\n\nbasic errors when it granted Texas College’s Motion to Strike\n\nEvidence (and related references in appellants’ response). Since the\n\n\n                                  57\n\forder itself contains most of the text of what was stricken, it serves\n\nas an easy guide to follow with the argument. It is contained in the\n\nappendix as “FEB 9 ORDER ON TC EVIDENCE OBJECTIONS.”\n\n        1. Bracken’s Deposition Excerpts\n\n     A brief review of page 2 of the order indicates that the court\n\nstruck evidence to which Mr. Brackens was qualified to speak. He\n\nindicated that he had received “scissor lift” training in his deposition.\n\n(CCR 2:162).      Moreover, he is simply reading the conditions\n\nprescribed by a regulation and then stating (with his personal\n\nknowledge) that the conditions required “did not take place.” (CCR\n\n24: 3926).\n\n  2. Owner’s Manual\n\n     This was excluded on page 3 of the order. Perhaps it was not\n\nnoticed, but the manual was authenticated during Mike Frazier’s\n\nDeposition:\n\n     Q. (BY MR. SIGMON) Have you ever seen this document\n        before?\n     A. sure.\n     Q. Okay. What is this?\n     A. This is the operation and safety manual that's inside the\n        scissor lift.\n\n\n\n\n                                   58\n\f(CCR 20:3319). It is certainly relevant and Mr. Frazier is certainly\n\nqualified. He is the “Manager of A-1 Rent All.” (CCR 2:172). It should\n\nnot have been excluded.\n\n  3. Rollins Affidavit\n\n     Parts of the Rollins affidavit were redacted based upon the order\n\nof the Court.   Although the redacted version was plenty to support\n\nthe statement of facts set forth in this brief, some additional relevant\n\nmaterial should not have been taken from the affidavit.\n\n     The objection labelled “D-3” on page 4-5 of the order should not\n\nhave been sustained. Mr. Rollins is perfectly qualified to authenticate\n\nthe excuses given to him by his Doctors.\n\n     The objection labelled “D-6” on page 5 of the order should not\n\nhave been sustained. Mr. Rollins is qualified to testify as to what his\n\ndoctor told him, and it is clearly admissible hearsay, because it is a\n\nstatement made for the purpose of medical diagnoses and is\n\nadmissible pursuant to 803(4) of the Texas Rules of Evidence.\n\n     The objection labelled “D-7” on page 5 of the order should not\n\nhave been sustained. It is not hearsay. He is simply stating what he\n\nwas directed to do. Moreover, he is qualified to authenticate a note\n\ngiven to him by his doctor.\n\n                                  59\n\f  4. Barnett Letter\n\n     The objection labelled “D-15” on page 7 of the order should not\n\nhave been sustained. This is Mr. Rollins’ authentication of the letter\n\nfrom Dr. Barnett, the non-paid, treating physician who performed the\n\nsurgery on Rollins. In its motion to exclude, Texas College did not\n\nobject to the effort of Mr. Rollins to authenticate it. That is no doubt\n\nbecause they were aware of the significant body of law allowing lay\n\nwitnesses to identify and authenticate correspondence.         See, e.g.\n\nHubenak v. San Jacinto Gas Transmission Co., 141 S.W.3d 172, 177\n\n(Tex. 2004) (Dunwoody's affidavit also authenticates correspondence\n\nthat passed between the condemnors and the landowners).\n\nMoreover, the bar on authentication is very low. Rule 901 of the\n\nTexas Rules of Evidence merely requires that a witness with\n\nknowledge testify “that an item is what it is claimed to be.” Tex. R.\n\nEv. 901. Rollins’ affidavit clearly does that with respect to the letter:\n\n          My surgeon’s letter to my lawyer describing my injury is\n     attached to my affidavit as Exhibit D. I have reviewed this\n     document with my lawyer and I am familiar with my surgeon's\n     opinion. He provided the letter in connection with this case.\n\nROLLINS AFFIDAVIT (CCR 7:888).\n\n\n\n\n                                   60\n\f     Texas College’s only objection to the Barnett Letter is a stock\n\nobjection that does not apply.    The objection in its entirety is as\n\nfollows:\n\n           This portion within Section 6 of Mr. Rollins' affidavit\n     should be stricken and not considered by the Court because the\n     information is hearsay. The letter attached to Rollins'\n     affidavit as Exhibit D is incompetent hearsay for which no\n     exception applies. Mr. Rollins' sole purpose for including such\n     records is to prove the truth of the matter asserted by Mr.\n     Rollins. Therefore, Texas College's objection to this portion of\n     Mr. Rollins' affidavit and the exhibit referenced should be\n     sustained, and this portion and the exhibit stricken and\n     disregarded by the Court.\n(CCR 22:3678) (emphasis added). The objection is simply erroneous\n\nand inapplicable. Rule 803(4) specifically reads as follows:\n\n     (4) Statement Made for Medical Diagnosis or Treatment. A\n     statement that:\n           (A) is made for--and is reasonably pertinent to--medical\n           diagnosis or treatment; and\n           (B) describes medical history; past or present symptoms or\n           sensations; their inception; or their general cause.\n\nTX R EVID Rule 803. A simple review of the letter indicates that it is\n\nprecisely what the rule applies to. See BARNETT LETTER (in Appendix).\n\nThe Barnett letter should not have been excluded.\n\n     THE TRIAL COURT SHOULD HAVE REOPENED THE EVIDENCE\n\n     Appellants sought leave to introduce two pieces of evidence in\n\nits motion to re-open the evidence. However, they now complain only\n\n                                 61\n\fabout the trial court’s refusal to consider the Barnett Affidavit. See\n\nBARNET AFFIDAVIT (in Appendix). Dr. Barnett's sworn affidavit offers\n\nnearly the exact same information that is contained in the Barnett\n\nLetter. See BARNETT LETTER (in Appendix).        Thus, this appellate\n\nrequest is superfluous in the event that this Court agrees that the\n\nletter was properly authenticated.     Moreover, since the opinions of\n\nDr. Barnett were also summarized by Dr. Gonzales in his report, this\n\nargument is, in reality, a fourth tier of insurance. For this issue to\n\nbe decisive, this Court would first have to: (1) reject Rollins’ lay\n\ntestimony combined with the medical records already in evidence, (2)\n\nreject the use of Dr. Gonzales report, and (3) rule that Rollins was\n\nunqualified to authenticate correspondence about his own treatment\n\nfrom his treating physician. Nevertheless, in the event of such a slim\n\npossibility, this Court should then concern itself with fairness - not\n\ntechnicalities.\n\n     A trial court may permit a party to offer other additional\n\nevidence when it \"clearly appears to be necessary to the due\n\nadministration of justice.\" Tex. R. Civ. P. 270. In determining whether\n\nto grant a motion to reopen, the trial court considers whether: (1) the\n\nmoving party showed due diligence in obtaining the evidence, (2) the\n\n                                  62\n\fproffered evidence is decisive, (3) reception of such evidence will\n\ncause undue delay, and (4) the Court's refusal will cause an injustice.\n\nWord of Faith World Outreach v. Oechsner, 669 S.W.2d 364, 366-67\n\n(Tex.App.-Dallas 1984, no writ). The trial court should exercise its\n\ndiscretion liberally \"in the interest of permitting both sides to fully\n\ndevelop the case in the interest of justice.\" Id. at 367.\n\n     The subject matter of the Barnett letter/affidavit is highly\n\nrelevant, material, and (as noted above) potentially decisive. There\n\nwas no lack of diligence in securing this evidence, rather, the\n\nevidence was offered as a narrative opinion letter early on. It was\n\nproperly attached to, and authenticated by Rollins’ summary\n\njudgment affidavit.\n\n     It was shortly after the letter was stricken that Rollins’ counsel\n\nsought to cure the alleged (but non-existent) defect by reformulating\n\nit as an affidavit and obtaining the Doctor’s oath. It was provided to\n\nthe court in a motion for reconsideration, and as a motion to reopen.\n\n     Reopening a case for the reception of additional evidence is\n\ndiscretionary. See McRoy v. Riverlake Country Club, Inc., 426 S.W.2d\n\n299 (Tex.Civ.App. -Dallas 1968). The discretion is to be liberally\n\nexercised, particularly if doing so is in the interest of justice. Id. See\n\n                                   63\n\falso, Hill v. Melton, 311 S. W.2d 496 (Tex.Civ.App.--Dallas 1958, writ\n\ndism'd.) (Court stating there are occasions where it may be the court's\n\nduty to grant the motion to reopen). Appellees would not have been\n\nprejudiced if the trial court had granted appellants’ request.     Dr.\n\nBarnett's opinion was known to Texas College. The affidavit format\n\nis virtually identical in substance to the letter disclosed to defense\n\ncounsel during discovery.\n\n     Appellants have meritorious claims in this non-subscriber case\n\nthat should have survived summary judgment. If there was a defect,\n\nthe affidavit cured it.   The trial court should have exercised its\n\ndiscretion flexibly \"to obtain a just, fair, equitable and impartial\n\nadjudication of the rights of litigants under established principles of\n\nsubstantive law.\" Tex.

Among the significant facts of the case, the court described\n\nthe following:\n\n           …there was no operator's manual present, and, that the\n     operator's manual that should have been in the crane contained\n     specific instructions to avoid moving the crane until all\n     personnel are clear. Wiethorn further testified that there was no\n     load chart to comply with the American National Standards\n     Institute (ANSI) within the crane. The operator's manual was\n     required by OSHA and ANSI to be kept in the cab at all\n     times. According to Wiethorn, OSHA and ANSI standards\n     applied to this particular crane and Coastal could have easily\n     provided the people who worked with the crane with the\n     pertinent OSHA standards regarding its operation. He testified\n     that proper operation of a crane calls for the operator to be\n     thoroughly conversant with the crane's operating manual,\n     which the crane operator could not have done in this case\n     because it was not present in the cab.\n\nId. at 760-61 (emphasis added).        The court indicated that even\n\nthough the general contractor [Coastal] did not control the crane,\n\n“Coastal had a responsibility to ensure a safe and suitable crane…”\n\nId. at 761.      See also Goodwin v. Bluffton Coll., 2004-Ohio-2223\n\n(material issue of fact as to whether company's breach of duty to\n\n                                  65\n\fprovide   college    with   safety   instruction   manuals   and   safety\n\ncomponents necessary for proper erection of scaffolding was\n\nproximate cause of student's death precluded summary judgment.).\n\n     Here the situation is similar: although A-1 (MPF) did not control\n\nthe situation in the gymnasium on the day Rollins was injured, they\n\nhad a duty to provide a “safe and suitable” scissor lift.\n\n     A scissor lift is a piece of heavy machinery governed by CFR\n\n1926.454 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act (“OSHA”) as a\n\n\"mobile scaffold\".     The American National Standards Institute\n\n(\"ANSI\") safety standard A92.6, AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARD           FOR\n\nSELF-PROPELLED ELEVATING WORK PLATFORMS, (CCR 21:3430-3573)\n\nalso addresses scissor lifts and the care they require. In Texas:\n\n     The relevance of an OSHA standard is that it, and the ANSI\n     standards which form the basis for most OSHA standards,\n     are the cumulative wisdom of the industry on what is safe and\n     what is unsafe. While OSHA was written to protect employees,\n     an unsafe practice for an employee applies equally well to a\n     customer who legitimately finds himself in the same geographic\n     space as the employee. Safety principles don't change\n     depending on whether the victim is an employee, a customer, or\n     a passerby. Therefore it has relevance to the standard of care.\n     It doesn't establish negligence per se, and it does not create a\n     separate cause of action. Melerine v. Avondale Shipyards, Inc.,\n     659 F.2d 706 (5th Cir.1981); Jeter v. St. Regis Paper Co., 507\n     F.2d 973 (5th Cir.1975). But it may be relevant evidence. …. All\n     of appellants' authorities deal with causes of action brought for\n     violations of those OSHA regulations. In the case at bar, no such\n\n                                     66\n\f     recovery was sought by appellee. Rather, the evidence was\n     introduced for the purpose of establishing a standard of\n     conduct to serve as a basis for a negligence cause of action ...\n     the testimony concerning the OSHA regulations only provided\n     statutory reinforcement of the obvious common-law standard.\n\nWal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Seale, 904 S.W.2d 718 (Tex.App. -San Antonio\n\n1995).\n\n     ANSI A92.6 part 6.3.1 requires the owner to provide the\n\n“operating manual” with each “rental” delivery. (CCR 21:3454).\n\n(emphasis added).    The manual begins by reminding us that the\n\nmanual itself is a very important \"tool\" and \"keep it with the\n\nmachine at all times\". JLG OWNER'S MANUAL \"FOREWORD.”\n\n(CCR 23:3766) (emphasis added). Nothing more need be said. There\n\nis a duty.\n\n  2. Breach of duty\n\n     Here, there was no owner’s manual on board the lift.\n\n(CCR 2:162).    Rollins swore that MFP (A-1) “did not offer us\n\ntraining” or “familiarize us with the lift.”          (CCR 25:4133)\n\n(emphasis added). The MPF [A-1] delivery crew did not bother to\n\ncome in and train Rollins, even though he inquired. They told him\n\nthat Texas College already “knew how to use the lift.”      Id.   (CCR\n\n25:4143). Rollins stated that “A-1 did not offer us training nor did it\n\n                                  67\n\ffamiliarize us with the lift.   The person from A·1 just came and\n\ndelivered the machine and left.” Id. Of course the “machine” had no\n\nmanual. The duty was breached.\n\n  3. Proximate Cause\n\n     Rollins “hadn’t been trained” and “didn’t know how to operate\n\nit.) (CCR 25:4134) Mr. Harris, agreed that “untrained employees\n\nshouldn’t be on scissor lifts.” (CCR 7:863). When asked about what\n\ntraining could have made a difference, Mr. Rollins testified that he\n\n“would have been trained to know how to use it and to get on and off\n\nthe proper way…” (CCR 4:316-317).\n\n     Most importantly, section 2.1 of the manual reads:\n\n          The aerial platform is a personnel handling device; so it is\n     necessary that it be operated and maintained only by trained\n     personnel.\n          Persons under the influence of drugs or alcohol or who are\n     subject to seizures, dizziness or loss of physical control\n     must not operate this machine.\n\nJLG OWNER'S MANUAL at 2-1 (CR 23:3341) (uncorrected record). Mr.\n\nRollins indicated that “If Mr. Brackens had looked at the owner’s\n\nmanual and informed me that a person with blackouts shouldn’t be\n\non a lift, I would not have gotten on.”     (CCR 25:4135).    This is\n\ncertainly more than a scintilla of evidence on proximate cause.\n\n\n                                  68\n\f     ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE WAS IMPROPERLY STRICKEN\n\n       1. Owner’s Manual\n\n     The objections to the admission of the owner’s manual is\n\nludicrous. First and foremost, it is part of the equipment that they\n\nadmittedly rented. Second, a copy (as asserted by MPF) was already\n\nin their possession. It was produced at Mike Frazier’s Deposition and\n\nproperly authenticated:\n\n     (Plaintiff's Exhibit 4 marked.)\n     MR. SIGMON: Let me hand you what' a being marked as\n        Plaintiff's 4.\n     THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. Closing these so I have some room.\n        Okay, sir.\n     Q. (BY MR. SIGMON) Have you ever seen this document before?\n     A. sure.\n     Q. Okay. What is this?\n     A. This is the operation and safety manual that's inside\n        the scissor lift.\n     Q. Okay. So this is an operation and safety manual from JLG,\n        correct?\n     A. Yes.\n     Q. JLG is the manufacturer of the model 1930es right?\n     A. Yes.\n     Q, Which is the same model that you rented to Texas College\n        that is involved in this lawsuit, right?\n     A. Yes.\n     Q, Now, on the front page down in the left-hand portion of the\n        page, you see four letters? You see those four letters?\n     A. The AN -- the ANI -- ANSI?\n     Q. Yes,\n     A. Yes.\n     Q, Do you see that? And you've already identified what ANSI\n        stands for, right?\n\n                                 69\n\f     A. Yes.\n     Q. And what is it again?\n     A. American National Safety Institute.\n     Q. So you'd agree with me that the American National Safety\n        Institute has put its logo on the front of this owner's\n        manual, right?\n     MR. GEDDIE: Objection, form.\n     A. It's yes, it's on there.\n\n(CCR 20:3318-3319). As one can see, the objection that “plaintiffs\n\nhave failed to establish its authenticity or relevance, or lay any proper\n\npredicate for the admissibility of same, either through a qualified\n\nwitness or otherwise,” as set forth in MPF’s filing (CCR 22:3720) is\n\nbaseless.\n\n     Moreover, one can look at the objections filed by MPF\n\n(CCR 22:3718-3725) and discern that they are (in large part) stock\n\nobjections, edited and filed without any supporting evidence, and in\n\nmany cases lacking detail. MPF objected to the manual on the basis\n\nthat it was not produced timely in violation of Texas Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 193.6(a). (CCR 22:3719-3720). But the objection is a\n\n“stock objection,” taken off the shelf and pressed without any\n\nsupporting evidence or explanation. Bare stock objections filed in\n\nwriting - with no oral hearing, no evidence, or explanation - should\n\n\n\n\n                                   70\n\fbe given short shrift by this Court. As shown in the argument above,\n\nthe manual is probative. It was authenticated. It is admissible.\n\n         2. Rollins Affidavit\n\n     MPF objected to the Rollins affidavit on the grounds that it was\n\na sham and should “be stricken in its entirety. (CCR 22:3720).\n\nHowever the trial court did not exclude the entire affidavit, but rather\n\npainstakingly edited it in response to Texas College’s objections.\n\n     MPF alternatively asked the court to, at a minimum, exclude\n\n“the statements that directly contradict” his testimony. Id. Because\n\nMPF sought an alternative form of relief, the objection is multifarious.\n\nCompounding the confusion, the order is vague. It is simply a check\n\nline with a check mark in it, placed in the “sustained” column. See\n\nFEB 9 ORDER   ON   MPF EVIDENCE OBJECTIONS p. 2 (CCR 24:3937) (also\n\nin appendix). There is no way for this Court to discern which one of\n\nthe alternative forms of relief was granted by looking solely at the\n\norder.   However, because the trial court did edit the affidavit to\n\nexclude the testimony referenced in the alternative plea (CCR\n\n24:3930-3931) (Texas College objection 13 sustained), one can\n\ndiscern that the trial court did not strike the affidavit entirely, but\n\n\n\n                                  71\n\fgranted the lesser relief. Thus, this Court should consider the entire\n\naffidavit (subject to Texas College objection 13) as to MPF.\n\n  3. Thorpe Affidavit\n\n     Appellees filed a joint motion to strike the affidavit of appellants’\n\naerial lift safety expert, Burt Thorpe.     See THORPE AFFIDAVIT (CR\n\n23:3402-3409) (original record) (also in appendix).        Tellingly, the\n\nmotion to strike the affidavit did not emphasize unfair surprise or\n\nprejudice. That is because there was none.\n\n     The issues presented in the Motion were: whether Plaintiffs\n\ntimely disclosed Burt Thorpe; whether the disclosure was sufficient;\n\nand whether Plaintiffs' supplemental designations passed muster of\n\nthe discovery rules and in no way constitute unfair surprise,\n\nprejudice or trial by ambush. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 193.6(b).\n\n     It was undisputed that the trial court's scheduling order\n\nrequired Plaintiffs' to designate all experts by October 16, 2014.\n\nPlaintiffs met the deadline with their October 13, 2014 Fourth\n\nSupplemental Disclosure adding Burt Thorpe as a safety expert.\n\n(CCR 6:710-718) Appellees argued that the supplemental October 13\n\ndisclosure was inadequate and therefore untimely per Rule 194.2(f).\n\n\n\n                                   72\n\f     Appellees cited Cunningham v. Columbia/St. David's Healthcare\n\nSystem, L.P., 185S.W.3d 7 (Tex.App.-Austin 2005) for support. In\n\nCunningham, the plaintiff was required to designate all experts by\n\nJune 29, 2004. Id. at 11. Plaintiff responded to a December 2003\n\nrequest for disclosure that she had not yet determined \"any testifying\n\nexpert witnesses\" and would supplement. Id. The June disclosure\n\ndeadline passed without plaintiff supplementing her response (i.e.\n\nshe provided no information about her expert). Id. On September 7,\n\n2004 (i.e. 90 days later) plaintiff attached her expert's affidavit for the\n\nfirst time, attempting to rely upon it as proof that her claims should\n\nsurvive summary judgment. Id. at 11. The appeals court affirmed\n\ndefendant's motion to strike on the grounds that plaintiff had herself\n\nconceded the designation was untimely and that she failed to satisfy\n\nher burden of showing either good cause or a lack of unfair surprise\n\nor prejudice. Id. at 13.\n\n     The facts here are distinguishable: at the time Rollins disclosed\n\nBurt Thorpe in October, he provided to appellees all of the\n\nrequirements of 194.2(f) including: his name, address and telephone\n\nnumber; the subject matter on which he was to testify; the general\n\nsubstance of his mental impressions and opinions; and his current\n\n                                    73\n\fresume.   See PLAINTIFFS' FOURTH SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE at 6-7\n\n(CCR 6:710-718). At the time of the disclosure, Plaintiffs expert had\n\nnot been provided any \"documents, tangible things, reports, models\n\nor data compilations\" per 194.2(f)(A). In fact, he had only been\n\nretained recently to testify about issues pertaining to safety and the\n\nlack thereof - not on medical or damages issues.       The difference\n\nbetween the substance of Plaintiffs' disclosure of Burt Thorpe in this\n\nmatter, (timely per the scheduling order) and the complete lack of\n\nresponse by the plaintiff in Cunningham is clear. The court in\n\nCunningham was absolutely correct in its judgment that the plaintiff\n\nhad not met her burden. There was no evidence of her expert's utter\n\nexistence prior to her summary judgment response, which is the\n\nepitome of \"unfair surprise\"- particularly in the context of a\n\ndispositive proceeding. Id. at 14. Here, Rollins met the initial\n\nrequirement of a timely disclosure per the rules and the Court's\n\nScheduling Order when he designated Mr. Thorpe on October 13.\n\n     Defendants received fair notice of Mr. Thorpe's participation as\n\nan expert; and were given the subject matter of his testimony, thus\n\nrefuting any claim of unfair surprise. See Gutierrez v. Gutierrez, 86\n\nS.W.3d 729 (Tex.App. -El Paso 2002).\n\n                                 74\n\f  4. The ANSI Standard and \"Statement of Best Practices”\n\n     During the course of the proceedings, appellants introduced the\n\nAmerican National Standards Institute (\"ANSI\") safety standard\n\nA92.6, AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARD          FOR   SELF-PROPELLED ELEVATING\n\nWORK PLATFORMS, (CCR 21:3430-3573) and ANSI’s STATEMENT OF BEST\n\nPRACTICES   OF   GENERAL TRAINING   AND   FAMILIARIZATION   FOR   AERIAL WORK\n\nPLATFORM EQUIPMENT, February 2010 (CCR 20:3215-3234).\n\n     MPF objected to these documents claiming that they were not\n\nauthenticated, not timely disclosed, and irrelevant. Ironically, with\n\nrespect to ANSI 92.6, MPF itself produced the same text on 6/26/14\n\nin response to Plaintiffs’ written request for production. (SR 13).\n\n     Both standards are discussed in the Thorpe affidavit. They are\n\nreferenced in response to requests for disclosure regarding Mr.\n\nThorpe’s testimony.      They are relevant.       Although the trial court\n\nsustained the objections, it should not have. Appellant submitted\n\nthe matters requesting “judicial notice of the Code of Federal\n\nRegulations, OSHA and ANSI provisions cited” therein, and gave\n\n“notice of their intent to rely” on them.           (CCR 20:3264).       See,\n\nDaugherty v. S. Pac. Transp. Co., 772 S.W.2d 81 (Tex. 1989) wherein\n\nthe Texas Supreme Court held that: (1) a court may take judicial\n\n                                     75\n\fnotice of OSHA regulations without such regulations being included\n\nin the pleadings, and (2) that the trial court committed reversible\n\nerror by not considering the OSHA regulation. See also Tex. R. Evid.\n\n201. It bears repeating that ANSI standards “form the basis for most\n\nOSHA standards.” Seale, 904 S.W.2d at 720. Since OSHA adopts\n\nANSI standards as its standards, the court was duty bound under\n\nRule 201 to take notice.\n\n     THE TRIAL COURT SHOULD HAVE REOPENED THE EVIDENCE\n\n     Appellants incorporate by reference the same argument made\n\nas to Texas College.\n\n                    CONCLUSION AND PRAYER\n\n\n     Wherefore, Appellants pray that this Court: (1) reverse the trial\n\ncourt’s order granting summary judgment in favor of Texas College;\n\n(2) reverse the trial court’s order granting summary judgment in favor\n\nof MPF Investments, LLC; and (3) remand the case for further\n\nproceedings. Also in the interest of justice and clarity: (4) reverse the\n\norders (a) denying the motion to reopen the evidence, (b) striking the\n\nexpert designation of Burt Thorpe, and to the extent argued in this\n\n\n\n                                   76\n\fbrief, granting (c) Texas College’s evidentiary objections and (d) MPF’s\n\nevidentiary objections.\n\n                                 Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                 /s/ Ernesto D.

While under his supervision and leadership at Texas College, none of the\n\n         employees were ever sent to any kind of safety training sessions or OSHA workshops,\"\n\n         With respect to the sentence in the same excerpt which reads, \"This kind of thing made\n\n         me and other employees question the school's attitude toward our safety,\" the Court\n\n         sustained Texas College's objection as to the words \"and other employees\" but\n\n         overruled the objection as to the remainder of that sentence. The Court redacted the\n\n         portions to which the objections were sustained.\n\n      4.

Other than the objections, or parts thereof, which were overruled by the Court as\n\n         identified in numbers 1 through 4 above, the Court sustained in their entirety Texas\n\n         College's objections to the remaining excerpts from Plaintiffs' summary-judgment\n\n         evidence and response contained in Section D of the Court's order dated February 19,\n\n         2015.\n\n      It is further Ordered that Sections A, B, C and E of the Prior Order do not require any\n\n\nORDER ON DEFENDANT TEXAS COLLEGE'S MOTION FOR ENTRY OF ORDER CLARlFYlSG\nEARLIER ORDER ON OBJECfJONSlMOTION TO STRIKE EVIDENCE AND REFERENCES\nIN PLAINTIFFS' RES POSSE TO TEXAS COLLEGE'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY Jl1>GMENT              PAGE 2 OF 3\n\n\n                                                                                 APPENDIX 10\n                                                                                                    Pace 4178\n\fclarification and are not addressed in this Order.\n\n        This Orderin no way changes the rulings memorialized in the Court's February 19,2015 Order\n\nbut is entered for purposes of clarification only.\n\n        IT IS SO ORDERED.\n\n                 SIGNED this   Q      day of...............   ....\n\n\n\n\nApproved:\n\nIs!Emesto Sigmon\nEmesto Sigmon\nBarNo. 24010397\nAttorney for Plaintiffs\n\nlsi Trey Yqrbrouih\nTrey Yarbrough\nBarNo. 22133.500\nAttorney for Defendant TexasCollege\n\n\n\n\nORDER ON                  TEXAS COLLEGE'S MOTION rOR ENTRY OF ORDER CLARIFYING\nEARLIER ORDER ON OBJECfIONst'lOTION TO STRIKE                 AND REFERENCES\nIN PLAINTIFFS'              TO TEXAS COLLEGE'S MOTION FOR St:MMARY JUDGMENT           PAGE J OF J\n\n\n                                                                               APPENDIX 11\n                                                                                                     Pan.. .4170\n\fAPPENDIX 12\n\f                                      CAUSE NO. 13-33S3-A\n                                                                           lOIS       lOAM B: 3S\nGARRY L.

Rollins' formal work title was \"Maintenance Technician\". His office was in the TC\n\nPhysical Plant (the \"Plant\").              Rollins reported to Roland Brackens, the Plant\n\nSuperintendent, and to James Harris, Vice President of Business and Finance at TC.\n\nRollins also supervised a three to four person maintenance crew.                           Rollins' overall\n\nresponsibility at TC included general maintenance, light construction, driving detail and\n\nessentially anything else the school required. He was hired to work at TC in 2008.\n\n11.     During September 2013, Rollins was asked by his supervisor to help move some\n\nmarble counter tops that were to be installed in the school's Science building. The\n\nslabs of marble themselves weighed anywhere from 150-185 pounds. TC asked Mr.\n\nRollins and one other worker to perform the task with no other assistance-man nor\n\nmachine. While moving the slab, Mr. Rollins sneezed/coughed, dropped the object and\n\nsuffered a momentary loss of consciousness. On or around September 9, 2013 Rollins\n\nsought emergency medical care because of the incident and was advised not to drive.\n\nRollins informed agents and employees of TC of his restriction and was subsequently\n\nremoved from a TC driving task that he had been performing on Tuesdays and\n\nThursdays. Upon information and belief, Mr. Brackens or Mr. Harris removed Rollins\n\nfrom the task.\n\n12.     A few weeks later, sometime during October 2013, the gymnasium ceiling at TC\n\nneeded repair. TC rented a hydraulic \"scissor lift\" (the \"Lift\") from defendant A-1 for\n\nPlaintiff Rollins and others to use while doing the repairs.\n\n13.     The Lift is capable of reaching upwards of approximately 20 feet from the ground\n\nand is often accompanied by a safety harness to prevent worker injury. TC did not rent\n\nPLAINTIFFS' SIXTH AMENDED PETITION                                                                        3\nMacintosh HD:Users:esigmon:Documents:CASES:Rollins-001 :Pleadings: Rollins Sixth Amended Petition .docx\n                                                                                        APPENDIX 17\n                                                                                                              Page 85\n\for purchase a harness for use with the Lift, nor did it purchase or rent any other\n\npersonal protective equipment needed to ensure worker safety. Upon information and\n\nbelief, A-1 did not offer or suggest that TC purchase or rent personal protective\n\nequipment for use with the Lift nor did it adequately confirm whether TC or its agents\n\nwere \"qualified personnel\" with the training and experience needed to safely operate the\n\nLift.   Upon information and belief, A-1 did not familiarize Rollins with the Lift and its\n\noperation nor did they offer to train Rollins. Rollins' immediate supervisor, Mr. Brackens\n\ndid not check or confirm whether A-1 Rent All included an owner/operator manual with\n\nthe Lift as required by its manufacturer, JLG.\n\n14.     On or around October 22, 2013 TC directed Rollins and others to use the Lift \"as\n\nis\" to make the repairs-minus training or supervision.                     After completing the work,\n\nRollins fell from the Lift as he was attempting to exit to safety. He immediately reported\n\nthe incident to the TC human resources department as required. At the time, Rollins\n\nassumed his fall had been relatively inconsequential as he was able to walk away\n\nunassisted.\n\n15.     Three days later, on or around October 25, 2013, Rollins lost sensation in his\n\nlegs and toes and was subsequently admitted to Zale Lipshy University Hospital in\n\nDallas Texas where he underwent invasive neck surgery.\n\n16.     Rollins is now convalescing at home, unable to walk unassisted and requires\n\nintensive at home physical therapy and care three times a week. He is no longer able\n\nto perform many of the household tasks he once did to assist his wife Carla with the\n\nmaintenance and care of their home.\n\n17.     On or around December 6, 2013 Rollins received correspondence from TC\n\nadvising him that he would be terminated if he does not return to work within 3 months.\n\nPLAINTIFFS' SIXTH AMENDED PETITION                                                                        4\nMacintosh HD:Users:esigmon:Documents:CASES:Rollins-001 :Pleadings: Rollins Sixth Amended Petition .docx\n                                                                                        APPENDIX 18\n                                                                                                              Page 86\n\f                                        CAUSES OF ACTION\n\nTEXAS COLLEGE - NEGLIGENCE AND GROSS NEGLIGENCE\n\n18.     Texas College was Rollins' employer at the time of his avoidable injury and owed\n\nhim a special duty of care at law. Texas College is a non-subscriber to Texas Worker's\n\nCompensation and does not carry any sort of insurance for work related injury.\n\nDefendant Texas College breached its duty of care to Rollins. Its breach includes and\n\nis not limited to Defendant's failure to: 1) provide a reasonably safe workplace; 2)\n\nfurnish reasonably safe machinery or reasonably safe personal protective equipment for\n\nuse with the Lift and for use in lifting the marble slab counter top; 3) provide adequate\n\nhelp in the performance of work; 4) train and/or properly supervise Plaintiff Garry Rollins\n\nwhile using the Lift and lifting the marble slab counter top; and 5) to ensure that Plaintiff\n\nGarry Rollins was fit to perform work on a scissor lift. The foregoing acts and omissions\n\nby TC constitute negligence and gross negligence.\n\nCHRISTIAN METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH - VICARIOUS LIABILITY, ALTER\nEGO, NEGLIGENCE AND GROSS NEGLIGENCE\n\n19.     During the time of Plaintiff Rollins' avoidable injury, Defendant CME represented\n\nto the public through documents on file with the Texas Secretary of State that TC\n\noperates under the \"supervision, care and ownership\" of CME. CME has and continues\n\nto represent to the general public that TC is one of its \"affiliate\" educational institutions,\n\nof which there are several.           CME makes extensive reference to TC throughout its\n\ninternal documentation and by-laws, and the role it plays in establishing TC policies and\n\nprocedures. CME also has a significant \"financial relationship\" with TC that has been\n\nreported to the IRS.\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFFS' SIXTH AMENDED PETITION                                                                        5\nMacintosh HD:Users:esigmon:Documents:CASES:Rollins-001 :Pleadings: Rollins Sixth Amended Petition .docx\n                                                                                        APPENDIX 19\n                                                                                                              Page 87\n\f20.     TC acted as CM E's agent at all times relevant to the facts made the basis of this\n\nlawsuit. CME is therefore liable for the torts of its agent as alleged and described herein\n\nand above and as recognized by the laws of Texas and the Restatement (2d) of Torts.\n\n21.     Plaintiffs further allege that CME exercises a measure of control over TC so as to\n\nqualify it as CME's \"alter-ego\" functioning as CME's mere tool or business conduit.\n\n22.     CME owed Plaintiffs a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid a foreseeable\n\nrisk of injury to others. CME also owed Plaintiffs a duty to exercise reasonable care in\n\nperforming services, whether gratuitously or for consideration that CME should\n\nrecognize as necessary for the protection of other persons or things.\n\n23.     CME breached its duties by failing to exercise reasonable care to secure Mr.\n\nRollins' safety while employed at TC and in doing so significantly increased his risk of\n\nharm.     This breach makes CME liable to Plaintiffs vicariously and directly.                            The\n\nforegoing acts and omissions by CME constitute negligence and gross negligence.\n\n\nMPF INVESTMENTS, LLC D/B/A \"A-1 RENT ALL\" - NEGLIGENCE, NEGLIGENT\nENTRUSTMENT AND GROSS NEGLIGENCE\n\n24.     MPF owed Plaintiffs a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid a foreseeable\n\nrisk of injury to others as well as a duty to take affirmative action to avoid increasing the\n\ndanger from a condition created by its conduct. Defendant MPF breached its duty of\n\ncare to Plaintiffs. MPF's breach includes and is not limited to its failure to ensure that\n\nthe Lift was being rented and used by competent and authorized persons; and to act\n\nreasonably and prudently in all manners regarding its rental transaction with TC and the\n\nsteps it should have taken to prevent the readily foreseeable harm that the Lift could\n\ncause subsequent users who were either unfit, untrained or incompetent to operate it.\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFFS' SIXTH AMENDED PETITION                                                                          6\nMacintosh HD:Users:esigmon:Documents:CASES:Rollins-001 :Pleadings: Rollins Sixth Amended Petition .docx\n                                                                                        APPENDIX 20\n                                                                                                                Page 88\n\fThe foregoing acts and omissions by MPF constitute negligence, negligent entrustment\n\nand gross negligence.\n\n                                    DAMAGES TO PLAINTIFFS\n\n25.

As a direct and proximate result of the occurrence made the basis of this lawsuit,\n\nPlaintiff Garry L. Rollins has sustained damages in an amount in excess of the minimum\n\njurisdictional limits of this Court. Such damages include, but are not limited to: physical\n\npain (past and future), physical impairment (past and future), medical expenses (past\n\nand future), loss of earning capacity (past and future), disfigurement (present and\n\nfuture), loss of income (past and future), emotional distress (past and future), and\n\nmental anguish (past and future).\n\n27.     As a direct and proximate result of the occurrence made the basis of this lawsuit,\n\nPlaintiff Carla D.

Plaintiffs further allege that Defendants' acts and omissions, whether taken\n\nsingularly or in combination, were aggravated by the kind of malice and reckless\n\ndisregard for which the law allows the imposition of exemplary damages. TC's conduct\n\namounts to gross negligence as defined by the laws of Texas.

Garry L. Rollins (hereinafter \"Rollins') is a maintenance worker employed by\n\nTexas College in the capacity of maintenance technician. Texas College itself operates\n\nunder the \"supervision, care and ownership\" of CME and has rented heavy equipment\n\n\"aerial work platforms\" from A-1 on various occasions.\n\n10.     Rollins' formal work title was \"Maintenance Technician\". His office was in the TC\n\nPhysical Plant (the \"Plant\").             Rollins reported to Roland Brackens, the Plant\n\nSuperintendent, and to James Harris, Vice President of Business and Finance at TC.\n\nRollins also supervised a three to four person maintenance crew.                          Rollins' overall\n\nresponsibility at TC included general maintenance, light construction, driving detail and\n\nessentially anything else the school required. He was hired to work at TC in 2008.\n\n11.     During September 2013, Rollins was asked by his supervisor to help move some\n\nmarble counter tops that were to be installed in the school's Science building. The\n\nslabs of marble themselves weighed anywhere from 150-185 pounds. TC asked Mr.\n\nRollins and one other worker to perform the task with no other assistance-man nor\n\nmachine. While moving the slab, Mr. Rollins sneezed/coughed, dropped the object and\n\nsuffered a momentary loss of consciousness. On or around September 9, 2013 Rollins\n\nsought emergency medical care because of the incident and was advised not to drive.\n\nRollins informed agents and employees of TC of his restriction and was subsequently\n\nremoved from a TC driving task that he had been performing on Tuesdays and\n\nThursdays. Upon information and belief, Mr. Brackens or Mr. Harris removed Rollins\n\nfrom the task.\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFFS' SEVENTH AMENDED PETITION                                                                        3\nMacintosh HD:Users:esigmon:Documents:CASES:Rollins-001 :Pleadings: Rollins Seventh Amended Petition .docx\n                                                                                       APPENDIX 26\n                                                                                                                Page 94\n\f12.     A few weeks later, sometime during October 2013, the gymnasium ceiling at TC\n\nneeded repair. TC rented a hydraulic \"scissor lift\" (the \"Lift\") from defendant A-1 for\n\nPlaintiff Rollins and others to use while doing the repairs.\n\n13.     The Lift is capable of reaching upwards of approximately 20 feet from the ground\n\nand is often accompanied by a safety harness to prevent worker injury. TC did not rent\n\nor purchase a harness for use with the Lift, nor did it purchase or rent any other\n\npersonal protective equipment needed to ensure worker safety. Upon information and\n\nbelief, A-1 did not offer or suggest that TC purchase or rent personal protective\n\nequipment for use with the Lift nor did it adequately confirm whether TC or its agents\n\nwere \"qualified personnel\" with the training and experience needed to safely operate the\n\nLift.   Upon information and belief, A-1 did not familiarize Rollins with the Lift and its\n\noperation nor did they offer to train Rollins. Rollins' immediate supervisor, Mr. Brackens\n\ndid not check or confirm whether A-1 Rent All included an owner/operator manual with\n\nthe Lift as required by its manufacturer, JLG.\n\n14.     On or around October 22, 2013 TC directed Rollins and others to use the Lift \"as\n\nis\" to make the repairs-minus training or supervision.                    After completing the work,\n\nRollins fell from the Lift as he was attempting to exit to safety. He immediately reported\n\nthe incident to the TC human resources department as required. At the time, Rollins\n\nassumed his fall had been relatively inconsequential as he was able to walk away\n\nunassisted.\n\n15.     Three days later, on or around October 25, 2013, Rollins lost sensation in his\n\nlegs and toes and was subsequently admitted to Zale Lipshy University Hospital in\n\nDallas Texas where he underwent invasive neck surgery.\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFFS' SEVENTH AMENDED PETITION                                                                        4\nMacintosh HD:Users:esigmon:Documents:CASES:Rollins-001 :Pleadings: Rollins Seventh Amended Petition .docx\n                                                                                       APPENDIX 27\n                                                                                                                Page 95\n\f16.     Rollins is now convalescing at home, unable to walk unassisted and requires\n\nintensive at home physical therapy and care three times a week. He is no longer able\n\nto perform many of the household tasks he once did to assist his wife Carla with the\n\nmaintenance and care of their home.\n\n17.     On or around December 6, 2013 Rollins received correspondence from TC\n\nadvising him that he would be terminated if he does not return to work within 3 months.\n\n                                        CAUSES OF ACTION\n\nTEXAS COLLEGE - NEGLIGENCE AND GROSS NEGLIGENCE\n\n18.     Texas College was Rollins' employer at the time of his avoidable injury and owed\n\nhim a special duty of care at law. Texas College is a non-subscriber to Texas Worker's\n\nCompensation and does not carry any sort of insurance for work related injury.\n\nDefendant Texas College breached its duty of care to Rollins. Its breach includes and\n\nis not limited to Defendant's failure to: 1) provide a reasonably safe workplace; 2)\n\nfurnish reasonably safe machinery or reasonably safe personal protective equipment for\n\nuse with the Lift and for use in lifting the marble slab counter top; 3) provide adequate\n\nhelp in the performance of work; 4) train and/or properly supervise Plaintiff Garry Rollins\n\nwhile using the Lift and lifting the marble slab counter top; and 5) to ensure that Plaintiff\n\nGarry Rollins was fit to perform work on a scissor lift. The foregoing acts and omissions\n\nby TC constitute negligence and gross negligence.\n\nCHRISTIAN METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH - VICARIOUS LIABILITY, ALTER\nEGO, NEGLIGENCE AND GROSS NEGLIGENCE\n\n19.     During the time of Plaintiff Rollins' avoidable injury, Defendant CME represented\n\nto the public through documents on file with the Texas Secretary of State that TC\n\noperates under the \"supervision, care and ownership\" of CME. CME has and continues\n\n\nPLAINTIFFS' SEVENTH AMENDED PETITION                                                                        5\nMacintosh HD:Users:esigmon:Documents:CASES:Rollins-001 :Pleadings: Rollins Seventh Amended Petition .docx\n                                                                                       APPENDIX 28\n                                                                                                                Page 96\n\fto represent to the general public that TC is one of its \"affiliate\" educational institutions,\n\nof which there are several.           CME makes extensive reference to TC throughout its\n\ninternal documentation and by-laws, and the role it plays in establishing TC policies and\n\nprocedures. CME also has a significant \"financial relationship\" with TC that has been\n\nreported to the IRS.\n\n20.     TC acted as CM E's agent at all times relevant to the facts made the basis of this\n\nlawsuit. CME is therefore liable for the torts of its agent as alleged and described herein\n\nand above and as recognized by the laws of Texas and the Restatement (2d) of Torts.\n\n21.     Plaintiffs further allege that CME exercises a measure of control over TC so as to\n\nqualify it as CME's \"alter-ego\" functioning as CME's mere tool or business conduit.\n\nCME has engaged in financial transactions pledging and leveraging Texas College\n\nassets; and controls the school through an elected body of officials composed\n\npredominately of CME officers and bishops acting on behalf of the CME-retaining for\n\nitself the power to merge, consolidate, convey, or terminate Texas College as it deems\n\nfit. The official bylaws of Texas College mandate that upon dissolution, the school's\n\nassets will revert back to CME. The elected body of officials (referenced supra) acts\n\nthrough various \"committees\", one of which established policies and procedures at the\n\nTexas College physical plant where Garry Rollins was employed for several years.\n\nThese policies and procedures impacted employee training and employee safety at\n\nTexas College.\n\n22.     CME owed Plaintiffs a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid a foreseeable\n\nrisk of injury to others. CME also owed Plaintiffs a duty to exercise reasonable care in\n\nperforming services, whether gratuitously or for consideration that CME should\n\nrecognize as necessary for the protection of other persons or things.\n\nPLAINTIFFS' SEVENTH AMENDED PETITION                                                                        6\nMacintosh HD:Users:esigmon:Documents:CASES:Rollins-001 :Pleadings: Rollins Seventh Amended Petition .docx\n                                                                                       APPENDIX 29\n                                                                                                                Page 97\n\f23.     CME breached its duties by failing to exercise reasonable care to secure Mr.\n\nRollins' safety while employed at TC and in doing so significantly increased his risk of\n\nharm.     This breach makes CME liable to Plaintiffs vicariously and directly.                         The\n\nforegoing acts and omissions by CME constitute negligence and gross negligence.\n\n\nMPF INVESTMENTS, LLC D/B/A \"A-1 RENT ALL\" - NEGLIGENCE, NEGLIGENT\nENTRUSTMENT AND GROSS NEGLIGENCE\n\n24.     MPF owed Plaintiffs a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid a foreseeable\n\nrisk of injury to others as well as a duty to take affirmative action to avoid increasing the\n\ndanger from a condition created by its conduct. Defendant MPF breached its duty of\n\ncare to Plaintiffs. MPF's breach includes and is not limited to its failure to ensure that\n\nthe Lift was being rented and used by competent and authorized persons; and to act\n\nreasonably and prudently in all manners regarding its rental transaction with TC and the\n\nsteps it should have taken to prevent the readily foreseeable harm that the Lift could\n\ncause subsequent users who were either unfit, untrained or incompetent to operate it.\n\nThe foregoing acts and omissions by MPF constitute negligence, negligent entrustment\n\nand gross negligence.\n\n                                    DAMAGES TO PLAINTIFFS\n\n25.             Defendants' combined negligence has proximately caused damage to\n\nPlaintiffs in an amount that exceeds the jurisdictional limits of this Court for which\n\nPlaintiffs pray judgment.\n\n26.     As a direct and proximate result of the occurrence made the basis of this lawsuit,\n\nPlaintiff Garry L. Rollins has sustained damages in an amount in excess of the minimum\n\njurisdictional limits of this Court. Such damages include, but are not limited to: physical\n\npain (past and future), physical impairment (past and future), medical expenses (past\n\nPLAINTIFFS' SEVENTH AMENDED PETITION                                                                        7\nMacintosh HD:Users:esigmon:Documents:CASES:Rollins-001 :Pleadings: Rollins Seventh Amended Petition .docx\n                                                                                       APPENDIX 30\n                                                                                                                Page 98\n\fand future), loss of earning capacity (past and future), disfigurement (present and\n\nfuture), loss of income (past and future), emotional distress (past and future), and\n\nmental anguish (past and future).\n\n27.     As a direct and proximate result of the occurrence made the basis of this lawsuit,\n\nPlaintiff Carla D. Rollins (Garry's spouse) has sustained special damages in an amount\n\nin excess of the minimum jurisdictional limits of this Court. Carla's special damages\n\ninclude, but are not limited to: loss of consortium (past and future) and loss of\n\nhousehold services (past and future).\n\n\n                                        EXEMPLARY DAMAGES 1\n\n28.      Plaintiffs further allege that Defendants' acts and omissions, whether taken\n\nsingularly or in combination, were aggravated by the kind of malice and reckless\n\ndisregard for which the law allows the imposition of exemplary damages. TC's conduct\n\namounts to gross negligence as defined by the laws of Texas. CME's conduct amounts\n\nto gross negligence as by the laws of Texas. CME is either directly liable for exemplary\n\ndamages because of its conduct or liable because of its agent's acts. MPF's conduct\n\namounts to gross negligence as defined by the laws of Texas. In light of the foregoing,\n\nPlaintiffs seek such exemplary damages against each defendant named herein in an\n\namount that exceeds the minimum jurisdictional threshold of the Court.\n\n\n1\n  Exemplary damages are considered special damages and must be specially pleaded (as they are here in Plaintiffs'\nSeventh Amended Petition). See Al Parker Buzek Co. v. Touchy, 788 S.W.2d 129, 130 (Tex.App.-Houston [1 11\nDist.] 1990, orig. proceeding); Wnght v. Rosenbaum, 344 S.W.2d 228, 231 (TexApp.-Houston 1961, no\nwrit)(issue on exemplary damages properly excluded because P did not plead for exemplary damages). The\nproportionate responsibility chapter of the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code does not apply to claims for\nexemplary damages and in cases with multiple defendants, the defendants cannot be held jointly and severally liable\nfor exemplary damages. See Tex.Civ.Prac. & Rem. Code sec.41.006. The fact-finder must specify the amount of\nexemplary damages assessed against each defendant. See Fazrfield Ins. V. Stephens Martzn Pavzng, LP, 246 S.W.3d\n653, 667 (Tex. 2008). :\\owhere in CME's Special Exceptions to P's Sixth Amended Petition does it state legal\nauthority supporting its objection to the manner in which Plaintiffs' have specially pied for exemplary damages.\n\nPLAINTIFFS' SEVENTH AMENDED PETITION                                                                              8\nMacintosh HD:Users:esigmon:Documents:CASES:Rollins-001 :Pleadings: Rollins Seventh Amended Petition .docx\n                                                                                             APPENDIX 31\n                                                                                                                      Page 99\n\f                                              JURY DEMAND\n\n29.

Garry L. Rollins (hereinafter \"Rollins\") is a maintenance worker employed by\n\nTexas College in the capacity of maintenance technician. Texas College has rented\n\nheavy equipment \"aerial work platforms\" from A-1 on various occasions.\n\n9.      Rollins' formal work title was \"Maintenance Technician\". His office was in the TC\n\nPhysical Plant (the \"Plant\").             Rollins reported to Roland Brackens, the Plant\n\nSuperintendent, and to James Harris, Vice President of Business and Finance at TC.\n\nPLAINTIFFS' EIGHTH AMENDED PETITION                                                                       2\nMacintosh HD:Users:esigmon:Documents:CASES:Rollins-001 :Pleadings:Rollins Eighth Amended Petition .docx\n                                                                                       APPENDIX 35\n                                                                                                              Page 499\n\fRollins also supervised a three to four person maintenance crew.                         Rollins' overall\n\nresponsibility at TC included general maintenance, light construction, driving detail and\n\nessentially anything else the school required. He was hired to work at TC in 2008.\n\n10.     During September 2013, Rollins was asked by his supervisor to help move some\n\nmarble counter tops that were to be installed in the school's Science building. The\n\nslabs of marble themselves weighed anywhere from 150-185 pounds. TC asked Mr.\n\nRollins and one other worker to perform the task with no other assistance-man nor\n\nmachine. VVhile moving the slab, Mr. Rollins sneezed/coughed, dropped the object and\n\nsuffered a momentary loss of consciousness. On or around September 9, 2013 Rollins\n\nsought emergency medical care because of the incident and was advised not to drive.\n\nRollins informed agents and employees of TC of his restriction and was subsequently\n\nremoved from a TC driving task that he had been performing on Tuesdays and\n\nThursdays. Upon information and belief, Mr. Brackens or Mr. Harris removed Rollins\n\nfrom the task.\n\n11.     A few weeks later, sometime during October 2013, the gymnasium ceiling at TC\n\nneeded repair. TC rented a hydraulic \"scissor lift\" (the \"Lift') from defendant A-1 for\n\nPlaintiff Rollins and others to use while doing the repairs.\n\n12.     The Lift is capable of reaching upwards of approximately 20 feet from the ground\n\nand is often accompanied by a safety harness to prevent worker injury. TC did not rent\n\nor purchase a harness for use with the Lift, nor did it purchase or rent any other\n\npersonal protective equipment needed to ensure worker safety. A-1 did not offer or\n\nsuggest that TC purchase or rent personal protective equipment for use with the Lift nor\n\ndid it adequately confirm whether TC or its agents were \"qualified personnel\" with the\n\ntraining and experience needed to safely operate the Lift. A-1 did not familiarize Rollins\n\nPLAINTIFFS' EIGHTH AMENDED PETITION                                                                       3\nMacintosh HD:Users:esigmon:Documents:CASES:Rollins-001 :Pleadings:Rollins Eighth Amended Petition .docx\n                                                                                       APPENDIX 36\n                                                                                                              Page 500\n\fwith the Lift and its operation nor did it offer to train Rollins. A-1 Rent All did not include\n\nan owner/operator manual with the Lift as required by the manufacturer, JLG.\n\n13.     On or around October 22, 2013 TC directed Rollins and others to use the Lift \"as\n\nis\" to make the repairs-minus training or supervision.                    After completing the work,\n\nRollins fell from the Lift as he was attempting to exit to safety. He immediately reported\n\nthe incident to the TC human resources department as required. TC did not formally\n\ninvestigate the incident nor did it report Mr. Rollins' workplace fall to OSHA.                     At the\n\ntime, Rollins assumed his fall had been relatively inconsequential as he was able to\n\nwalk away unassisted.\n\n14.     Three days later, on or around October 25, 2013, Rollins lost sensation in his\n\nlegs and toes and was subsequently admitted to Zale Lipshy University Hospital in\n\nDallas Texas where he underwent invasive neck surgery.\n\n15.     Rollins is now convalescing at home, unable to walk unassisted and requires\n\nintensive at home physical therapy and care three times a week. He is no longer able\n\nto perform many of the household tasks he once did to assist his wife Carla with the\n\nmaintenance and care of their home.\n\n16.     On or around December 6, 2013 Rollins received correspondence from TC\n\nadvising him that he would be terminated if he does not return to work within 3 months.\n\n                                        CAUSES OF ACTION\n\nTEXAS COLLEGE - NEGLIGENCE AND GROSS NEGLIGENCE\n\n17.     Texas College was Rollins' employer at the time of his avoidable injury and owed\n\nhim a special duty of care at law. Texas College is a non-subscriber to Texas Worker's\n\nCompensation and does not carry any sort of insurance for work related injury.\n\nDefendant Texas College breached its duty of care to Rollins.

The foregoing acts and omissions\n\nby TC are violations of the Texas Labor Code (Chapter 411 et. seq.), the common laws\n\nof Texas, and various other rules and regulations pertaining to worker safety. As such,\n\nTC's conduct with respect to Garry Rollins constitutes negligence and gross negligence.\n\n\n\nMPF INVESTMENTS, LLC D/B/A \"A-1 RENT ALL\" - NEGLIGENCE AND GROSS\nNEGLIGENCE\n\n18.     MPF owed Plaintiffs a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid a foreseeable\n\nrisk of injury to others as well as a duty to take affirmative action to avoid increasing the\n\ndanger from a condition created by its conduct. Defendant MPF breached its duty of\n\ncare to Plaintiffs. MPF's breach includes and is not limited to its failure to: 1) ensure that\n\nthe Lift was being rented and used by competent and authorized persons; 2) deliver the\n\nLift in \"fit for service\" condition prior to use; 3) offer training or familiarization with the\n\nLift; and 4) to act as a reasonable and prudent renter of heavy machinery under the\n\ncircumstances in all manners pertaining to the transaction with TC and the steps it\n\nshould have taken to prevent the readily foreseeable harm that could result from unfit,\n\nuntrained or incompetent operators using the Lift. The foregoing acts and omissions by\n\nMPF constitute negligence and gross negligence.\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFFS' EIGHTH AMENDED PETITION                                                                       5\nMacintosh HD:Users:esigmon:Documents:CASES:Rollins-001 :Pleadings:Rollins Eighth Amended Petition .docx\n                                                                                       APPENDIX 38\n                                                                                                              Page 502\n\f                                      DAMAGES TO PLAINTIFFS\n\n19.

I am in my mid fifties, and am not as\n\n       strong as I was when younger, and have suffered previous work related injuries to my hand, knees and\n\n       neck. Texas College and Mr. Brackens were aware of these injuries as I have been to the doctor on\n\n       several occasions and given the Human Resources department my medical excuses over the years.

Moving\n\n     marble slabs like this was not part of my normal work duties. )JItt1were not trained or instructed on\n\n     proper lifting techniques or given any direction for performing a safe lift of this size. Mr. Brackens\n\n     left for vacation instructing us that the counters should be moved by the time he returned. J struggled\n\n     with the weight during the move; the marble slabs were awkward to handle and 1 had difficulty\n\n     positioning myself under the weight. I coughed/sneezed while lifting the marble, dropped it and\n\n     briefly passed out. I injured my back and begin experiencing pain and tingling from the neck down.\n\n     The next day, September 9. 2013, I went to the                            a ttiqilexd \"it... ,lIilRlhl,lIa b 7'5\n     jp   ,ddi'hl ,. fall bsd) pain.

During this time, I also began to experience problems getting along with Mr. Brackens. At times I\n\n     questioned Mr. Brackens leadership ability and competence. He did not like that. Over the course of\n\n     the next several weeks in September and into October, Mr. Brackens began having me perform\n\n     maintenance and repair jobs that were at times degrading and a little frightening. For example, on one\n\n     occasion he insisted that I crawl underneath several buildings on campus to take photographs of the\n\n     different buildings' foundation. I wasn't given a flashlight or anything to assist with crawling around\n\n     hundreds of yards in the dark underneath buildings. Instead. I had to use my cell phone. After I\n\n     completed the assignment, Mr. Brackens had me to go back under the buildings because he didn't like\n\n     the quality of the photos 1 took. I refused to go a second time on account that I felt the work was\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                      APPENDIX 48\n                                                                                                                          Page 4132\n\f     dangerous not being able to see in the dark and it made me very uncomfortable crawling around in\n\n     tight spaces.

This kind of thing made me and otheremployees question the school'sattitude toward our\n\n     safety.\n\n\n4.   During October 2013, Mr. Brackens assigned me and my crew the job of fIXing the gym ceiling in\n\n     preparation for the Texas College homecoming celebration. Texas College rented a scissor lift from\n\n     ClA_l R.ent All\" in Tyler, Texas for us to do the work at about 19-20 feet in the air. Dr. Fennell wanted\n\n     the ceiling repaired and wanted it done immediately. Over the course of my professional career, I\n\n     havedone work on roofs and at heights but I havenever operated a scissor lift (which is different from\n\n     say a \"boom\" lift) and J have become leery of heights in my olderage for fear of falling. I explained\n\n     to Mr. Brackens that I did not know how to operate a scissor lift and that I was afraid of the height.\n\n     Later that day, Mr. Harris called me to his office along with Ms. Bowie and infonned me that Mr.\n\n     Brackens had complained that I was an ongoing discipline problem and that J didn't want to do as told,\n\n     Mr. Harris infonned me that In orderto keep myjob I needed to get the ceiling fixed as directed.\n\nS.   I was present outside the gym when A·I Rent All delivered the scissor lift to Texas College. I asked\n\n     the delivery person If A·[ would brini the lift inside the gym and who was going to show us how to\n\n     use It. The A·I person informed me that he couldn't bring the lift indoors and thlt the folks at Texas\n\n     Collcae knew how to use the lift. A-I did not offer WI training nor did it familiarize us with the lift.\n\n     The person from A·I just came and delivered the machine and left.\n\n\n6.   I began doing the gym ceiling work with Michael Johnson on October 21,2013 as directed by Mr.\n\n     Bra<:kens and Mr. Harris.

The next morning, I arrived at work before Mr. Johnson and began\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                      APPENDIX 49\n                                                                                                                               Pace 4133\n\f      tryingto operate the lift to complete the repain as instructed. When Mr. Johnson arrived I lowered the\n\n      lift and brought him up. While in the air, Michael Johnson told me I didn't look good. He also\n\n     testified to this fact in his deposition.    r was present at his deposition.          He was correct: I didn't feel\n\n     right being that high up. Michael suggested that we come down and that I set otTthe lift. Once he\n\n     brought the lift down, I went to exit and fell from the top of the platform flat on my back ontothe gym\n\n     floor. The top of the lift platform is still a good three feet off the ground when its all the way down,\n\n     and I fell straightback with nothing breaking the fall. I don't remember taking the first step down. )\n\n     wasn't wearing any safety harness and had not been given a hard hat. Michaellohnson was present\n\n     and witnessed my fall and Steve Barron was also presentin the gymwhen (fell. Michael Johnson has\n\n     given a statement that it looked like I just \"let so\".

I completed a neurosurgical residency at the University of Texas\nSouthwestern Medical Center (2000-2005). I received fellowship training in skull base and\ncerebrovascular neurosurgery at the University of South Florida, Tampa (2005-2006). I was a\nfaculty member at the University of Mississippi School of Medicine for one year (2006-2007)\nprior to returning to Dallas. Since that time, I have been a faculty member in the Department\nof Neurological Surgery at The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (2007-\nPresent). I am a member of the hospital staffs at Zale Lipshy University Hospital, Parkland\nMemorial Hospital and the Dallas VA Medical Center. I am board certified by the American\nBoard of Neurological Surgery and I am licensed to practice medicine in Texas and\nMississippi. In my current practice, I regularly evaluate and manage patients with traumatic\nand degenerative spinal conditions.\"\n\n3.     \"I have completed my review of Garry Rollins' medical records. Items reviewed\ninclude Emergency Room records dated 10/25/2013, inpatient medical records from\n10/26/2013 - 11111/2013 and 11115/2013 - 11/20/2013 and an MRI scan of the cervical spine\ndated 10/25/2013.

Mr.\nRollins was involved in a fall at work on October 22, 2013. Mr. Rollins was getting off of a\nlift, fell backwards and hit the back of his head. Over the next several days, he began having\nprogressive problems with ambulation. In addition, he had significant neck pain. These\ncomplaints, as well as a syncopal episode, ultimately prompted a visit to the emergency\ndepartment at St. Paul Hospital on 10/25/2013. His evaluation included an MRI of the cervical\nspine which was performed on the same day.

On February 4, 2015, Plaintiffs\n\nfiled a Response to Texas College's Motion for Summary Judgment.             Plaintiffs attach and\n\nreference numerous items within their response as summary-judgment evidence. Texas College\n\nobjects to certain evidence submitted with the response as incompetent and defective, and to\n\ncertain references within the Response at not supported by competent evidence. The College\n\nrespectfully requests that the objections stated below be sustained, the objectionable material and\n\nreferences to the same be stricken from the record, and that the objectionable material not be\n\nconsidered by the Court.\n\n\nDEFE:'iDA:'iT TEXAS COLLEGE'S OBJECTIO:'iS/MOTIO:'i TO STRIKE\nEVIDE:'iCE A'.\\ll REFERE:'iCES I:'i PLAI:'iTIFFS' RESPO:'iSE TO TEXAS\nCOLLEGE'S MOTIO:'i FOR St:MMARY Jt:DGME:'iT                                             PAGE 1OF19\n                                                                                APPENDIX 64\n                                                                                                                Page 3666\n\f                                ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITY\n\n        Evidence included in response to a motion for summary judgment must be admissible\n\nunder the rules of evidence. United Blood Servs. V. Longoria, 938 S.W.2d 29, 30 (Tex. 1997);\n\nsee TEX. R. Crv. P. 166a(f). Facts must be proven in the same manner or type of evidence that\n\nwould be admissible at trial. See TEX. R. Crv. P. 166a(c). If a party's summary-judgment proof\n\ncontains evidence that would not be admissible at trial, the appropriate avenue to challenge such\n\nis through written objections and requesting that the inadmissible summary-judgment proof be\n\nstricken. See TEX. R. Crv. P. 166a(f)\n\nI.      Plaintiffs' Seventh and Eighth Amended Petition\n\n        A party cannot rely on factual assertions in its own pleadings as summary-judgment\n\nproof. Laidlaw Waste Sys. v. City of Wilmer, 904 S.W.2d 656, 660 (Tex. 1995). Texas College\n\nobjects to, and requests that the Court strike any reference by Plaintiffs to their amended\n\npetitions in the Response, as they are not competent evidence on which Plaintiffs may rely.\n\nII.

SIGMON): And if you look at - if you Pg. 17\nlook at subsection (a) of [OSHA] Section\n 1926.454, it states that, \"The employer shall\nhave each employee who performs work while\non a scissor lift trained by a person qualified in\nthe subject matter to recognize the hazards\nassociated with the type of set - of scissor lift\nbeing used and to understand the procedures to\ncontrol or minimize those hazards.\" And you've\njust testified that that did not take place,\ncorrect?\n\n A. Correct.\n Q. So the rules that we just spoke about, Pg. 17\n specifically those OSHA examples, those are\n safety rules, right?\n\n A. Correct.\n Q. But my question to you, Mr. Brackens, is, Pg. 18\n you just testified that OSHA section 1926.454\n was not followed. It was violated. That rule\n was broken. No training was given by a\n competent person to these employees at Texas\n College on how to operate a scissor lift.\n A. Okay.\n\n Q. Correct?\n A. Yes, I correct - yes, I did say that.\n\n        Mr. Brackens was not qualified by Plaintiffs to testify as an expert on specific OSHA\n\nrules or regulations or make any conclusory opinions on same, and made it clear through his\n\ntestimony that he is not an expert on same. Brackens dep. 18:8-14. While he may be familiar\n\ngenerally with OSHA, Plaintiffs have attempted to obtain definitive legal conclusions from\n\nBrackens and elicit from him opinion testimony on specific standards. While he has been shown\n\nto be knowledgeable and experienced on the mounting, dismounting, and the operation of scissor\n\nand boom lifts and other matters addressed in his deposition, OSHA standards and their\n\napplication to specific workplace items are not among those matters.

The JLG Owner's Manual Model 1930-ES\n\n        Texas College objects to Plaintiffs' attempted use of a purported JLG Owner's Manual\n\non the basis that Plaintiffs have failed to establish its authenticity or relevance, or lay any proper\n\npredicate for the admissibility of same, either through a qualified witness or otherwise. The\n\npurported manual is inadmissible hearsay and not competent as summary-judgment proof. No\n\nexception to the hearsay rules apply to the subject manual filed as an independent document with\n\nthe Court. Since Plaintiffs are attempting to offer statements within the JLG Owner's Manual to\n\nprove the matter asserted, the JLG Owner's Manual itself, and the statements referenced within\n\nit, are inadmissible hearsay.\n\n        Texas College's objections to the JLG Owner's Manual should be sustained, any\n\nreference to the JLG Owner's Manual should stricken, and the JLG Owner's Manual and any\n\nreference to it should be disregarded by the Court. The references within Plaintiffs' response\n\nthat Texas College requests to be stricken are listed below.\n\n                                                                        p\n                                                        Page 16\n\n Use extreme caution when entering or leaving\n platform. Ensure that the scissor arm assembly\n is fully lowered. Face the machine when\n entering or leaving the platform. Always\n maintain \"three point contact\" with the machine\n using two hands and one foot or two feet and\n one hand at all times during entry and exit.\n JLG, the manufacturer of the subject lift, also Page 18\n requires that lift operators be trained.\n\n\n\nDEFE:'iDA:'iT TEXAS COLLEGE'S OBJECTIO:'iS/MOTIO:'i TO STRIKE\nEVIDE:'iCE A'.\\ll REFERE:'iCES I:'i PLAI:'iTIFFS' RESPO:'iSE TO TEXAS\nCOLLEGE'S MOTIO:'i FOR St:MMARY Jt:DGME:'iT                                              PAGE4OF19\n                                                                                  APPENDIX 67\n                                                                                                         Page 3669\n\f There is developed evidence (affinned by Page 18\n common sense, and discussed supra) that a\n scissor lift is a piece of machinery that requires\n extreme caution because of its potential dangers\n and hazards.\n The undisputed evidence is that a person in Mr. Page 20\n Rollins condition should not have been\n operating this type of machinery and that it is\n incumbent on the employer to recognize these\n potential hazards\n The undisputed evidence is that a person in Mr. Page 22\n Rollins condition should not have been on or\n ooerating this type of machinery\n\nIV.     Affidavit of Garn Rollins\n\n        An affidavit attached in response to a motion for summary judgment must contain facts\n\nthat would be admissible in evidence at trial. TEX. R. Crv. P. 166a(f); United Blood Servs. v.\n\nLongoria, 938 S.w.2d 29, 30 (Tex. 1997). Set forth below are those portions of Rollins' affidavit\n\nand the corresponding references within Plaintiffs' response the College respectfully submits\n\nshould be stricken, and the supporting grounds.

See, e.g., Gen. Elec. Co. v. Moritz, 257 S.W.3d 211, 215 (Tex.2008). We use the term “landowner”\n       in this opinion to refer to all such parties.\n8      We use the term “generally” here to acknowledge circumstances in which an employee may not be an “invitee” on\n       the employer's premises. For example, if an employee, acting outside the scope of employment, enters the employer's\n       premises without the employer's knowledge and not for their mutual benefit, the employee might be a licensee or even\n       a trespasser. We need not decide that issue here.\n9      E.g., Del Lago Partners, Inc. v. Smith, 307 S.W.3d 762, 771 (Tex.2010); TXI Operations, L.P. v. Perry, 278 S.W.3d 763,\n       764 (Tex.2009); Werner v.

J. 1154\n\n13     In Urena, we recognized that the facts of that case—tenant-on-tenant crime as opposed to crimes committed against\n       tenants by nonresidents—might require a different duty analysis than that used in Timberwalk, but we did not reach that\n       issue because, even assuming a duty existed, the plaintiff presented no evidence of causation. 162 S.W.3d at 551 n. 2.\n14     In Holder, we restated the duty rule from Timberwalk: “With regard to criminal acts of third parties, property owners owe\n       a duty to those who may be harmed by the criminal acts only when the risk of criminal conduct is so great that it is both\n       unreasonable and foreseeable.” 5 S.W.3d at 655. But we also noted that, in most cases, “the foreseeability analysis\n       will be shaped by determining whether the plaintiff was an invitee, a licensee, or a trespasser.” Id. We did not have to\n       determine the plaintiff's status in that case because the plaintiff “was an unforeseeable victim regardless of her status.” Id.\n15     In TXI, the Court did not refute this construction of Parker, which is consistent with the Court's explanations in Moritz and\n       Dixon, but instead “assume[d] that a duty to warn exist[ed]” because the defendant did “not attempt to argue that it owed\n       no duty,” and argued instead that it satisfied its duty by providing an adequate warning. TXI, 278 S.W.3d at 765.\n16     The common law assumption-of-the-risk doctrine we refer to here involves implied assumptions of risk and not express,\n       contractual assumption of the risk or statutory assumption-of-the-risk defenses. See, e.g., TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.\n       CODEE § 93.001.\n17     See also Dugger, 408 S.W.3d at 832 (“Proportionate responsibility abrogated former common law doctrines that barred a\n       plaintiff's recovery because of the plaintiff's conduct—like assumption of the risk, imminent peril, and last clear chance—\n       in favor of submission of a question on proportionate responsibility.”); TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE E §§ 33.001–.017\n       (proportionate-responsibility statute).\n18     This Court has cited Robinson on seven occasions. See Lawrence v. CDB Servs., Inc., 44 S.W.3d 544, 549 (Tex.2001);\n       Werner, 909 S.W.2d at 868; Hernandez v. City of Fort Worth, 617 S.W.2d 923, 925 (Tex.1981); Leadon v. Kimbrough\n       Bros. Lumber Co., 484 S.W.2d 567, 568 (Tex.1972); Royal Indem. Co. v. Dennis, 410 S.W.2d 185, 187 (Tex.1966);\n       Tarver v. Tarver, 394 S.W.2d 780, 782 (Tex.1965); Halepeska v. Callihan Interests, Inc., 371 S.W.2d 368, 377 (Tex.1963),\n       abrogated by Parker, 565 S.W.2d at 516. On three of those occasions, the Court cited Robinson for an error-preservation\n       issue rather than the holding on the merits of the case. See Hernandez, 617 S.W.2d at 925; Dennis, 410 S.W.2d at 187;\n       Tarver, 394 S.W.2d at 782. On four occasions the Court cited Robinson for merits-based holdings. See Lawrence, 44\n       S.W.3d at 549; Werner, 909 S.W.2d at 868; Leadon, 484 S.W.2d at 568–69; Halepeska, 371 S.W.2d at 377. One such\n       case, Halepeska, was not an employer-employee case, and was later abrogated by Parker. Halepeska, 371 S.W.2d at\n       377. Leadon did not involve an argument that the danger at issue was open and obvious or known to the employee;\n       instead, the issue was whether the employer had a duty to hire someone to watch for falling limbs while the employee\n       performed his logging work. 484 S.W.2d at 568–69. In Werner, the Court cited Robinson for the general principle that an\n       employee cannot recover on a negligence claim against a nonsubscribing employer without proving that the employer was\n       negligent. Werner, 909 S.W.2d at 868 (holding that there was no evidence of the negligence alleged). And in Lawrence,\n       which was later superseded in part by statute, see TEX. LAB. CODE § 406.033(e), we cited Robinson, among numerous\n       other cases, only for the proposition that the Workers' Compensation Act did not bar all possible defenses to liability a\n       nonsubscribing employer might have. Lawrence, 44 S.W.3d at 549.\n19     See Escoto, 288 S.W.3d at 412–13 (“[T]he employer ‘owes no duty to warn of hazards that are commonly known or\n       already appreciated by the employee.’ ... Likewise, we do not impose a duty to train employees regarding the commonly-\n       known dangers of driving while fatigued.”); Goss, 262 S.W.3d at 794 (“The threshold question here is one of duty, as\n       we have held that an employer ‘owes no duty to warn of hazards that are commonly known or already appreciated by\n       the employee.’ ”); Skiles, 221 S.W.3d at 568 (“[W]hile the duty of ordinary care generally requires an employer to ‘warn\n       an employee of the hazards of employment and provide needed safety or equipment or assistance,’ the employer ‘owes\n       no duty to warn of hazards that are commonly known or already appreciated by the employee.’ ”); Elwood, 197 S.W.3d\n       at 795 (“[Employer] had no duty to warn [employee] of a danger known to all and no obligation to provide training or\n       equipment to dissuade an employee from using a vehicle doorjamb for leverage.”).\n20     Some courts of appeals have applied Timberwalk in employer–employee premises-liability cases. See, e.g., Barton v.\n       Whataburger, Inc., 276 S.W.3d 456, 462 (Tex.App.–Houston [1st Dist.] 2008, pet. denied); Gibbs v. ShuttleKing, Inc.,\n       162 S.W.3d 603, 610 (Tex.App.–El Paso 2005, pet. denied); Allen v. Connolly, 158 S.W.3d 61, 65 (Tex.App.–Houston\n       [14th Dist.] 2005, no pet.). We have never expressly held that Timberwalk governs an employer's duty to employees with\n       respect to third-party criminal activity on the premises, and that issue is not presented here. We have held, and hold\n       again here, that at least in general, an employer's premises-liability duty to employees is the same as other landowners'\n       premises-liability duties to other invitees. See, e.g., Hernandez, 374 S.W.2d at 197.\n21     In Goss, the employee had to “maneuver around a ‘lowboy’ loading cart” to retrieve items from a deli cooler. 262 S.W.3d\n       at 794. “She successfully stepped over the cart and entered the cooler. After she retrieved what she needed, she turned\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    APPENDIX 115 20\n\fAustin v.

In doing so, she injured her back.” Id.\n22     We do not decide here whether a single injury could give rise to both a premises-liability claim and a negligent-activity\n       claim if both the condition of the premises and the contemporary activities of the premises owner proximately cause the\n       injury.\n23     We do not decide which, if any, of the limitations on an employer's premises-liability duty may also apply to its\n       instrumentalities duty.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Connolly, 158 S.W.3d 61, 63 (Tex.App.–Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, no pet.)(same).\n6      During oral argument, Kroger was unable to identify a case dictating the outcome it seeks in its first issue. Kroger instead\n       asked this Court to change the law. This we cannot do because changing higher-court precedent is not the function of an\n       intermediate court of appeals. SeeDeutsch v. Hoover, Bax & Slovacek, L.L.P., 97 S.W.3d 179, 195 (Tex.App.–Houston\n       [14th Dist.] 2002, no pet.)(“we must follow the Texas Supreme Court's expressions of the law and leave changes in the\n       application of common-law rules to that higher authority”); see alsoEntergy Gulf States, Inc. v. Summers, 282 S.W.3d\n       433, 476 (Tex.2009) (Willet, J., concurring) (“Judges have no authority to second-guess the myriad policy judgments\n       codified in the Workers' Compensation Act”).\n7      A non-subscribing employer may not assert any negligence by an employee as a defense. SeeTex. Lab. Code Ann. §\n       406.033(a) (West 2015).\n8      Milanes testified regarding his desire to work, his inability to do manual-labor jobs like those he had been trained to\n       perform, and his departure from a job pulling parts at a warehouse because he kept dropping the parts. His expert, Dr.\n       Donald Huddle, testified regarding Milanes's loss of his Kroger salary ($16.69 per hour) and benefits up to the time of\n       trial. He also testified regarding the present value of the salary and benefits Milanes would lose over his expected future\n       work life, assuming that Milanes would be able to find employment at a lower salary. The jury awarded approximately\n       the amount Dr. Huddle calculated for past lost earning capacity, and less than half of the lowest amount he calculated\n       for future lost earning capacity.\n9      In a letter brief filed following oral argument, Kroger identified a sixth photograph, Plaintiff's Exhibit 8, as a photograph\n       it was challenging the admission of on appeal. Kroger did not, however, object to the admission of Exhibit 8 during\n       trial. Kroger therefore has not preserved its complaint regarding the admission of this photograph for appellate review.\n       Tex.R.App. P. 33.1; Grace Interest, L.L.C. v. Wallis State Bank, 431 S.W.3d 110, 122 (Tex.App.–Houston [14th Dist.]\n       2013, pet. denied).\n10     Of course, the juror's allegation that she asked the bailiff for an opportunity to speak to the trial judge about her concerns\n       regarding deliberations is not itself evidence of matter occurring during deliberations, though the trial judge found her\n       allegations not credible. Yet even if we assumed for the sake of argument that the request was made and the trial court\n       should have pursued it, the court would have learned no more than the allegations in the juror's affidavit regarding what\n       occurred in deliberations, which “cannot form the basis of a motion for new trial.” In re Zimmer, Inc., 451 S.W.3d 893,\n       897 n. 1 (Tex.App.–Dallas 2014, orig. proceeding).\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

STATEMENT OF PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n      This is a non-subscriber suit for a work related injury.\n\nPlaintiffs/Appellants, Gary Rollins and Carla Rollins filed suit on\n\nDecember 20, 2013. (CCR 1: 1-5.)1 Appellants shall be referred to\n\nas “Rollins” and “Mrs. Rollins” respectively, and “Mr. and Mrs.\n\nRollins,” “plaintiffs” or “appellants” collectively).\n\n      SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n\n      Defendant/Appellee, MPF Investments, LLC, d/b/a \"A-1 Rent\n\nAll\" (hereinafter “MPF”) filed a motion for summary judgment on\n\nJanuary 15, 2015. (CCR 2:104–248.) On the very same day defendant\n\nTexas College (hereinafter “TC”) filed a motion for summary\n\n\n\n      1  The original clerk’s record (herein cited as “CR”) was missing bookmarks\nand was not text searchable. It was also missing certain designated records. As\na result of requests for supplementation and a motion to correct the record, the\ntrial clerk filed a supplemental record (herein cited as “SR”) and a “corrected”\nclerk’s record (herein cited as “CCR”). The “corrected” record was filed with\nvolumes 2 and 3 containing the same pages, volume 12 completely missing,\ncertain missing pages and several pages out of order. As a result, it is necessary\nto refer to the original record (CR) at times. Since the page numbers in the CR\nand the CCR are the same, the court can consult the CCR unless it finds a\nnecessary page missing, in which case it will have to consult the non-searchable\nCR.\n\n                                        1\n\fjudgment. (CCR 4:249-5:497.) Mr. and Mrs. Rollins filed a response\n\nto TC’s summary judgment motion on February 4, 2015 (CR 6:815-\n\n22:3234) and a response to MPF’s summary judgment motion on\n\nFebruary 6, 2015. (CR 22:3241 -24:3474.)\n\n     TC filed a summary judgment reply on February 12, 2015 (CCR\n\n21: 3512–3645) and MPF filed a summary judgment reply on\n\nFebruary 13, 2015 (CCR 22:3701–3736).      MPF’s reply included a\n\nseries of objections and request to strike plaintiffs’ summary\n\njudgment evidence.\n\n     MOTIONS TO STRIKE\n\n     During the pendency of the summary judgment motions, MFP\n\nand TC filed a joint motion to strike Rollins’ designation of Burt\n\nThorpe, a safety expert, on January 23, 2015. (CCR 5:508 – 567.)\n\nAppellants filed a response on February 3, 2015. (CCR 6:700 – 746.)\n\nMFP filed a reply on February 9, 2015. (CCR 21: 3475-3484.) Rollins\n\nfiled a sur-reply (erroneously titled “reply”) on the same day (CCR\n\n21:3485-3495.)\n\n     On January 26, 2015, MPF and TC also filed a joint motion\n\nrequesting that “the reports and any opinions” of Gilbert Martinez,\n\nJoe G. Gonzales, and Thomas M. Roney - a neuropsychologist,\n\n                                2\n\fmedical doctor, and economist, respectively.              (CCR 6:568-699.)\n\nRollins filed a response on February 3, 2015. (CCR 6:747 -7:813.) A\n\njoint reply was filed on February 6, 2015 (CCR 20:3235-3239.)\n\n      On February 13, 2014 TC filed objections and a motion to strike\n\nevidence and references in Rollins’ responses to TC’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment. (CCR 22:3666 – 3700.) Rollins filed a response\n\non February 13, 2015. (CCR 22:3737 – 23:3922.)\n\n      THE FEBRUARY 19 ORDERS\n\n      On February 19, 2015, the trial court issued a series of orders\n\nrelating to the summary judgments and the evidence.                  The court\n\ngranted the joint motion to strike the designation of Rollins’ liability\n\nexpert, Burt Thorpe, (CCR 24:3923). The court also granted nearly\n\nall   of   the   requests   to   strike   portions   of   Rollins’    affidavit.\n\n(CCR 24:3925-3934.)         The court also sustained the objections to\n\nsummary judgment evidence set forth in MPF’s summary judgment\n\nreply. (CCR 24:3936-3937.) However, the court denied the joint\n\nmotion to strike the reports and opinions of Gilbert Martinez, Joe G.\n\nGonzales, and Thomas M. Roney. (CCR 24:3924.) Finally, the court\n\ngranted TC’s motion for summary judgment (CCR 24:3935), and\n\ngranted MPF’s motion for summary judgment (CCR 24:3938).\n\n                                      3\n\f     RECONSIDERATION\n\n     On February 24, 2015 Mr. and Mrs. Rollins filed an emergency\n\nmotion to reopen the evidence. (CCR 24:3939 – 4027.) On the same\n\nday Mr. and Mrs. Rollins also filed a motion to reconsider regarding\n\nTCs motion for summary judgment.        (CCR 24:4028 – 4136)     On\n\nMarch 2, 2015 they also filed a motion to reconsider MPF’s motion\n\nfor summary judgment. (SR 10-23).\n\n     On March 9, 2015, TC filed a response to the emergency motion\n\nto reopen the evidence. (CCR 25:4151-4163.) On March 11, 2015,\n\nTC filed a response to the motion to reconsider. (CCR 25: 4164 –\n\n4170.) On March 12, 2015, MPF filed its response to the emergency\n\nmotion to reopen the evidence. (CCR 25:4171 – 4176).\n\n     On March 17, 2015, the court below, denied Mr. & Mrs. Rollins’\n\nmotion for reconsideration of the TC summary judgment (SR 7), and\n\nalso denied their motion to reopen the evidence (SR 8).\n\n     On April 10, the Court below denied Rollins’ motion for\n\nreconsideration of the MPF summary judgment. (CCR 25:4180.)\n\n     A notice of appeal was filed on May 8, 2015. (CCR 25:4181-\n\n4183) The clerk’s record was filed (incorrectly) on June 9, 2015. A\n\nsupplemental record was filed on September 2, 2015. A “corrected”\n\n                                 4\n\frecord (with significant omissions) was filed on September 15, 2015.\n\nDue to the fact that the trial court held no oral hearings before ruling\n\nto strike the evidence and grant summary judgment, there is no\n\nreporter’s record.\n\n2.   STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION\n\n          This Court has jurisdiction under Tex. Const. art. V, § 6\n\nand Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 22.220.\n\n\n\n\n                                   5\n\f          STATEMENT REGARDING ORAL ARGUMENT\n\n\n     No oral argument was had in the court below.

Also, the\n\ncourt below has stricken factual statements made in the affidavit of\n\nan unsophisticated lay witness, plaintiff/appellant, Garry Rollins.\n\nThey were stricken because the lower court believed they were either\n\ninconsistent with his deposition testimony, or simply beyond his\n\ncompetence.\n\n     Oral questioning of counsel will be the most effective way for\n\nthis Court to extract a detailed and accurate presentation of the\n\nparties’ arguments on consistency (or inconsistency) of the evidence.\n\nOral argument will thus emphasize and clarify the written\n\narguments, significantly aiding the decisional process of this Court.\n\n\n\n\n                                  6\n\f                     ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n\n\n1.

SUMMARY\n     Gary Rollins was injured when he “blacked out” and fell during\n\nan attempt to dismount from the platform of a “scissor lift.” Over his\n\nown protest, he had been ordered to “get up there” and patch the\n\nhigh ceiling of a gymnasium. Defying all common sense, his direct\n\nsupervisors ordered him “up there” knowing that he suffered from\n\na fear of heights and “syncope,” a condition which causes\n\nfrequent and unpredictable loss of consciousness. Moreover, he\n\nhad not received training or instruction on the use of the lift.\n\n2.   LITIGATION FACTS.\n\n     Despite its simplicity, the case below was hotly contested by\n\nTexas College, a non-subscriber to the workers compensation\n\nsystem, and TC’s co-defendant. From the beginning the case was\n\nburdened with numerous aggressive filings -- special exceptions,\n\nmotions to compel, motions to strike evidence, and motions for\n\nsummary judgment. (CCR passim).\n\n\n\n\n                                   8\n\f     Eventually, the case reduced to two (2) summary judgment\n\nmotions and a number of supporting motions to strike evidence. On\n\nFebruary 19, 2015 the trial court simultaneously issued orders on\n\nall of the pending motions.\n\n     The court sustained numerous objections to many parts of the\n\nsummary     judgment     evidence       (CCR   24:3936-3937.),   expert\n\ndesignations (CCR 24:3923), and certain parts of Mr. Rollins’ affidavit\n\n(CCR 24:3925-3934.) – which required redaction. However, as will\n\nbe shown below, the striking of the various parts of the evidence\n\nwas truly inconsequential. What survived, was ample summary\n\njudgment evidence.\n\n     Preserving some significant evidence, the trial court denied\n\ndefendants’ request to strike expert reports of certain doctors (CCR\n\n24:3924).   These reports had been incorporated by reference into\n\nappellants’ responses to requests for disclosures.      The disclosure\n\nresponses were specifically used as summary judgment evidence.\n\n(CCR 2:109) (See reference to Exhibit “H”).\n\n     Without oral hearing, the trial court granted the motions for\n\nsummary judgment.\n\n\n\n                                    9\n\f      An attempt was made here to draft this statement using only\n\ninformation from materials on file and documents referenced by the\n\nparties which were not stricken at the time of the February 19 orders.2\n\nThese facts do not contain materials submitted on reconsideration or\n\non the request to re-open the evidence. These facts were not stricken\n\nand were specifically allowed by trial court when it granted the\n\nsummary judgments:\n\n3.    CASE FACTS\n\n      GARY ROLLINS, TEXAS COLLEGE, AND MPF\n\n      Gary Rollins worked “at Texas College as a maintenance Tech\n\nand Supervisor for about six years.” (CCR 25:4131).

It was indicated Mr. Rollins had multiple episodes and\n      each spell was \"ppt\" by generalized paresthesia, and some\n      lightheadedness. It was also indicated Mr. Rollins had episodes\n      at work, while driving and had several spells that day.

It was noted Mr. Rollins was\n      provided a work release form which allowed Mr. Rollins to be\n      able to return to work in 2 days with no restrictions.\n            On October 14, 2013, Mr. Rollins was seen by William J.\n      Hwang, M.D. for blackout spell during exertion, pain in neck\n      and back, and numbness from the neck down. It was noted Mr.\n      Rollins was lifting a heavy object on September 4, 2013, sneezed\n      during the episode and developed weakness and numbness\n      from the neck down.

GONZALES, MD (CCR 6:646-647) (emphasis added).\n\n     NOTICE OF SYNCOPE DIAGNOSIS AND REMOVAL FROM DRIVING DUTY\n\n     Importantly, Rollins informed both Harris and Brackens that he\n\n“was now having dizziness and blackout spells.” ROLLINS AFFIDAVIT\n\n(CCR 25:4132). Brackens admitted to hearing about the problem:\n\n“…I left out on the 9th of September and I think I returned on the\n\n17th. I think that's when I -- the day I returned back from vacation.\n\nThere was a incident that I heard that he had had a light stroke or a\n\nheart attack or something --…” (CCR 4:382). In addition, on at least\n\none prior occasion Rollins told Brackens that he was afraid of\n\nheights. (CR 4:294)\n\n     In his affidavit, Rollins indicated that he “produced a Doctor\n\nnote to prove that [he] had been to the hospital. Mr. Harris and Mr.\n\nBrackens then removed [him] from a driving duty [he] had been\n\nperforming for some time at Texas College where [he] would drive\n\nstudents from Dallas to Tyler to attend classes.” (CCR 25:4132). In\n\nhis sworn interrogatory answers Rollins stated that he was “restricted\n\nfrom driving” in September of 2013. (CCR 3:236).\n\n                                 13\n\f     Rollins had been asked to drive TC students on Tuesday and\n\nThursday mornings.     (CCR. 4:306).     Brackens testified that he\n\n“knew” about the “park-and-rides” Rollins was “doing” on Tuesdays\n\nand Thursdays. (CCR 4:362). Confirming Rollins’ version of events,\n\nBrackens also testified that he suspected that Harris was responsible\n\nfor the suspension:\n\n     Q. Who is it -- who is it that likely took him off of the driving\n        detail?\n     A. Mr. Harris.\n     Q. And do you know why Mr. Harris took him off the driving\n        detail?\n     A. No, sir, I do not.\n     Q. Did it have anything to do with Garry having some\n        issues behind the wheel, passing out, that sort of thing?\n     A. That I do not know. I know that he had been in and out sick\n        all the time. That could have been the issue.\n\n(CCR 7:883-883).\n\n     THE GROWING ANTAGONISM\n\n     During this time, Rollins began “to experience problems getting\n\nalong with Mr. Brackens.” (CCR 25:4132). “At times” he questioned\n\nBracken’s “leadership ability and competence.” Id. Brackens was\n\nhaving Rollins “perform maintenance and repair jobs that were at\n\ntimes degrading and a little frightening.”     Id.   Rollins began to\n\nquestion the schools attitude toward their safety. (CCR 25:4133).\n\n\n                                 14\n\f     Although he was Rollins’ superior, Brackens admitted that he\n\nresigned because he had “leadership problems” and that employees\n\nwere “not listening” to him. (CCR 4:343). A colloquy with counsel\n\nshows that Brackens had an issue with people not taking his orders:\n\n     Q. Meaning that people were not respecting your leadership\n        and authority and your position?\n     A. Correct.\n     Q. And why do you think that there was a lack of respect for\n        your authority and leadership at Texas College?\n     A. Don't know. Don't know. That's -- the employees, that's the\n        problems that I had. You cannot make grown folks work,\n        and all I could do was ask them to do jobs and they it\n        wasn't getting done.\n\n(CCR 4:344) (emphasis added).\n\n     THE WORK ON OCTOBER 21, 2013\n\n     On October 21, 2013 Roland Brackens told Rollins, that “Dr.\n\nFennel wanted the ceiling in the gym fixed....” and that a “scissor lift\n\nwould be out” and to “go in” the gym. (CCR 4:297). Mr. Rollins\n\ndescribed his response: “I expressed to him then I didn’t know how\n\nto use it and I didn’t want to get up on it because I done got too old\n\nand I’m afraid of the height.” (CCR. 4:297). Nevertheless Brackens\n\ntold Rollins to get with another employee “Michael Jones” who\n\n\n\n\n                                  15\n\fBrackens claimed knew “how to use it.” (CCR 4:297).               Rollins\n\ncomplied. Id.\n\n        After some difficulty with the lift, as Mr. Rollins described: “We\n\nfinally got it crunk up, and we went up and patched the roof, the\n\nceiling. I stayed up there about five minutes on the 21st showing\n\nhim what needed to be done, and him and a community service\n\nfinished off.” (CCR 4:297) (emphasis added). Although, Rollins had\n\nno “trouble getting off the lift” (CCR 4:299), he was “nervous the\n\nentire time” he was “up there.” (CCR 25:4133). They did not finish\n\nthe work that day. (CCR 25:4133).\n\n        Bracken’s judgment was not good.        Earlier that day he had\n\ninstructed the men to put a ladder on top of the scissor lift\n\nplatform to reach even higher. (CR. 4:303-304). He admitted to it.\n\n(CCR 4:342). His order was universally rejected by his subordinates\n\nand his superiors. (CCR 4:304). The deposition testimony describes\n\nthis crazy suggestion, as well as Rollins’ response in rejecting the\n\nidea:\n\n        Q. What other conversation took place?\n        A. I discussed with Mr. Harris Roland told them guys to set a\n           ladder up on top of the lift and get up there because it\n           wouldn't reach a certain height that they had to get to and\n           he told them to set a ladder up on top of the lift and I told\n                                    16\n\f       them not to set no ladder up on there because they be\n       done fell out and kill theirself. And I told Ms. Bowie and\n       Mr. Harris that. Well, Mr. Harris started laughing about it\n       and said that that was stupid of Roland to even suggest that\n       being in the position that he's in.\n     Q. And you were standing there when Mr. Brackens told this\n        to Stevie?\n     A. No. They came and told me, and I confronted Mr. Bracket\n        about it.\n     Q. Stevie was one of them, was the other one --\n     A. Mike and Alex.\n     Q. All three.\n     A. Yes.\n     Q. And they told you and then you went --\n     A. And then I went and talked to Roland about it first,\n        asked him why would he tell them to set a ladder up on\n        that lift.\n     Q. And what did he say?\n     A. He said that Dr. Fennell want this done, he want it done by\n        Friday, so whatever it takes to get it done, that's what we\n        need to do.\n\n(CCR 24:4041-4042) (emphasis added).\n\n     THE CONFRONTATION ON THE AFTERNOON OF OCTOBER 21ST\n\n     Rollins’ refusal to obey Mr. Brackens had consequences. Later\n\nthat evening Rollins “was called to the office by Mr. Harris and Ms.\n\nBowie....” (CCR 4:297-298). As Mr. Rollins put it: “…Mr. Bracket\n\nhad told them that I said I wasn’t going to get up there and do it….”\n\n(CCR. 4:298). Harris told Rollins that Brackens had “complained”\n\n                                 17\n\fthat Rollins was an “ongoing discipline problem” and that Rollins\n\n“didn’t want to do as told.” (CCR 25:4133). “Mr. Harris informed\n\n[Rollins] that in order to keep [his] job [he] needed to get the\n\nceiling fixed as directed.” Id. (emphasis added).\n\n     In his deposition, Rollins described the pressure to be on the lift\n\ndue to the presence of a camera in the gym:\n\n     Q. Now, I do want to ask you about this conversation. Tell me,\n        just describe in your own words as best you can what you\n        said to them and what they said to you.\n     A. Well, when I walked in the office, I asked Mr. Harris what\n        was going on, and I saw Ms. Bowie. And normally if\n        something is going on that Mr. Harris want me to take care\n        of, he usually calls me up there and I do the job. When I\n        saw Ms. Bowie, I asked them what was going on.\n       They said, \"Mr. Bracket said that you won't do nothing\n       he said.\"\n       And I told them he was a liar. I say, \"I done been in the\n       gym this morning and started Mike and them in there\n       patching the roof.\" We got cameras in there in the gym,\n       and I was seen on the cameras up there on the lift.\n     Q. How do you know that? Was that part of this conversation?\n     A. Was it part of who conversation?\n     Q. The conversation with Mr. Harris and Ms. Bowie?\n     A. Yes. I told them I was seen by Dr. Fennell and Ms. Marshall.\n     Q. On the camera.\n     A. Yes.\n     Q. How do you find out about that?\n     A. Ms. Marshall told me.\n     Q. When did she tell you that?\n                                  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span>\n\f<span class=\"reporter\">A.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">That evening on the way home. She said, \"I was sitting up\n   here wondering why did you get up on the lift feeling\n   the way you feel.\"\n    AND I TOLD HER I DIDN'T HAVE NO CHOICE and I got to\n    finish it up tomorrow.\nQ. But you were discussing that with Mr. Harris and Ms.\n   Bowie?\nA. Yes.\nQ. But you weren't aware that you were seen on the camera\n   until after you left the campus to go home.\nA. No, no, no. When we got in the car, Ms. Marshall\n   automatically started talking with me about why would you\n   get up on that lift.\n…\nQ. So, tell me -- all right. So, tell me about this discussion\n   then about being on the camera with – I mean, the\n   discussion you had with Ms. Bowie and Mr. Harris about\n   being on the camera.\nA. It wasn't a long discussion, it was just when I was called in\n   the office that evening, I was already in Ms. Marshall's office\n   sitting in her office. And she sit up there and ask me,\n   \"Why would you get up on the lift like that and you\n   know how you're feeling?\"\n    So, I told her at that time, \"Well, Roland told me that I\n    had to GET UP THERE and get it done.\" And then in the\n    next two or three minutes, Mr. Harris called my phone and\n    had me come around to his office, we're in the same\n    building. I went around to his office, and he immediately\n    told me that Mr. Bracket said that I wouldn't do nothing he\n    told me to do and I was supposed to been in there fixing\n    that gym and I wasn't even doing that.\n    And I told him that Mr. Bracket is telling a lie, I say Ms.\n    Marshall and Dr. Fennell saw me on there.\nQ. So, Ms. Marshall told you that she and Dr. Fennell saw\n   you.\n\n                              19\n\f     A. Yes.\n\n(CCR 4:300 - 303) (emphasis added). Rollins continued to describe\n\nthe specific directive he received that afternoon from Mr. Harris:\n\n     Q. Did you have any further conversation with Ms. Bowie and\n        Mr. Harris?\n     A. No. As far as on that evening, Mr. Harris just told me that\n        first thing in the morning go in there and get that done, he\n        say, because Dr. Fennell been telling Roland that he wanted\n        to get it done and Roland come up here and say you say you\n        ain't going to do it, but we need to get that done before\n        Friday. I told Mr. Harris, \"Mr. Harris, I'm going to tell you\n        like I told Roland, I'm afraid of the height, but I'm going to\n        get in there and I'm going to get it done.\" And at that time, I\n        was also angry. But when Tuesday came, I went in there\n        and I got it done.\n\n(CCR 4:304-305).\n\n     Interestingly, Mr. Brackens testied repeatedly that Rollins was\n\nnot at work on the 21st. (CCR 20:3289). But Michael Johnson, a co-\n\nworker indicated that Rollins was there and had instructed him to\n\ndisregard the crazy ladder instruction made by Brackens earlier on\n\nthat day. (CCR 20:3269).\n\n     THE WORK ON OCTOBER 22ND\n\n     Rollins testified that he showed up for work at about 7:15 am\n\non the morning of the 22nd and after a short “McDonalds” breakfast\n\nthe crew got to work. (CCR 4:307). He continued:\n\n\n                                 20\n\f       And by that time, the guys would be through picking up\n       trash out through the campus, and we all get started to\n       work. So, on that Tuesday, I knew I didn't have a choice,\n       I feel like my job was in jeopardy and I was still mad and\n       angry. But I went in the gym, me, Steve Alex, Mike hadn't\n       showed up yet, and we try to get the lift started. We couldn't\n       get it started; so, it was another lift on the other end, we\n       went down there and we managed to get that one crunk up.\n       And I went up there and start patching the holes. Maybe\n       five minutes Mike came in, and he told me that he would go\n       ahead and finish it. And I told him, nah, I said, no, Roland\n       done called me in the -- I mean, Mr. Harris done called me\n       in the office yesterday evening because of Roland telling\n       him that I wouldn't do it. He said, \"Well, Roland is just\n       lying, we was in here.\" I said, \"Well, I know it\" I said, \"but\n       I'm not worried about that,\" I say, \"I just need to get this\n       done because I don't need them saying nothing else to me\n       about this gym.\"\n\nId. In another exchange, Rollins testified about the situation with\n\nmore detail:\n\n     Q. And how long were you up on the lift up there by yourself\n        before Mike came in?\n     A. Maybe 5 or 8 minutes. When he came in, I let it down and\n        he got on. And he told me that, \"Well, you go ahead and\n        get off, man, because you look like you're scared.\" I\n        said, \"Well, I don't want to be up here anyway, but your\n        uncle went and lied yesterday; so, I got to get this\n        done.\"\n     Q. So, he and Mike initiated the comment that you go ahead\n        and get down because you look like you're scared.\n     A. Yes.\n     Q. And then you told him no because your uncle --\n     A. I had to get it done.\n     Q. Because your uncle lied yesterday.\n\n                                21\n\f     A. Yes. I was directed by Mr. Harris to get it done Tuesday.\n     Q. That wasn't T-uesday, was it?\n     A. That was on a Monday when Mr. Harris direct me\n        Tuesday morning GET UP THERE and get it done.\n\n(CCR 309)(emphasis added).\n\n     Rollins was “afraid” of working on the scissor lift at that time\n\n“because [he] didn’t know how to operate it, hadn’t been trained, and\n\nwas fearful because of [his] injury and blackouts.” (CCR 25:4134).\n\n     Harris testified that Rollins was duty bound to get on the lift if\n\nMr. Brackens told him to – even if Brackens knew about the syncope!\n\n     Q. So, you're now going to testify -- or are you testifying now\n        that if a manager knows that an employee is suffering\n        from seizures, the employee should get on the scissor\n        lift if the manager says get up there and do it, is that\n        what you're telling me?\n     A. Yes.\n\n(CCR 868). This is the type of evidence which supports a finding of\n\ngross negligence. Brackens has completely denied the events and\n\nstated that he told Mr. Rollins not to “be in the Gym” on Oct. 22d.\n\n(CCR 4:354).\n\n     Rollins “would not have gotten on the lift if [he] had not been\n\nspecifically instructed to do so by Mr. Brackens and later by Mr.\n\nHarris.” (CCR 25:4134). “The only reason [he] got on the lift is\n\n\n                                 22\n\fbecause [he] was told to do so and was made to feel as though\n\n[his] job depended on it.” (CCR 25:4134-4135) (emphasis added).\n\nRollins “didn't want to do it.” (CCR 25:4135).\n\n             If Mr. Brackens had looked at the owner's manual and\n      informed [Rollins] that a person with blackouts shouldn't be on\n      a lift, [Rollins] would not have gotten on. Mr. Brackens however\n      did not do this. He did not look at a safety manual, and if he\n      did, he certainly did not inform or warn [Rollins] that a person\n      in [Rollins’] condition shouldn't be on a scissor lift.\nId.\n\n      THE FINAL “BLACK OUT” AND THE “FALL”\n\n      Once Mike “brought the lift down” Rollins “went to exit and fell\n\nfrom the top of the platform flat on [his] back onto the gym floor.”\n\n(CCR 25:4134). “The top of the lift platform is still a good three feet\n\noff the ground when its all the way down and [he] fell straight back\n\nwith nothing breaking his fall.”     Id.   Rollins does not “remember\n\ntaking the first step down.” Id.\n\n      Insinuating that Rollins’ prior ordeal (of multiple hospital visits,\n\nmedical tests, and ultimate syncope diagnosis) was the first part of\n\nsome elaborate fraud, Michael Johnson who is apparently Bracken’s\n\nnephew (CCR 4:309) and was still on the payroll (CCR 4:400) testified\n\nthat Rollins looked like he just “let go.” (CCR 4:410). Johnson also\n\nclaimed Rollins offered to “take care of” him “when this is over.” (CCR\n                                   23\n\f4:413). In a move completely inconsistent with fraud, after the fall,\n\nRollins said something like “Yea, I’m fine or okay.” (CCR 4:458.) He\n\ntold Stevie Barron “that he was just embarrassed.” Id. Rollins was,\n\nin fact, embarrassed and thought he was alright. (CCR 25:4134). He\n\n“tried to get up fast because [he] was more embarrassed knowing that\n\nDr. Fennell was looking at the cameras.” (CCR 21:3620). “Of course,\n\n[he] later ended up having to have major surgery.” Id.\n\n     Regardless, the “stress of the work at that height had [him]\n\ndisoriented and dizzy. Id. He was already “nervous being that high\n\nin the air.” Id. All Rollins remembered was “turning around on the\n\nplatform, gripping the handrails, and then being on [his] back.” Id.\n\n     Q. So, you had a right hand on one handrail and a left hand\n        on the other.\n     A. Yes.\n     Q. While you were still standing on the platform, the floor.\n     A. Right.\n     Q. And then you proceeded to step down --\n     A. Yes.\n     Q. -- the first step? With your right foot or left foot?\n     A. I don't know was it my right or left, I can't recall.\n     Q. Were you able to step down on that step?\n     A. I stepped down, and when I stepped, I fell.\n     Q. How did you fall?\n\n\n                                   </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span>\n\f     <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span> <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> just fell flat on my back, I don't know what happened, I\n        just fell.\n\n(CCR. 21:3619-3620).\n\n     THE ATTEMPT TO MANUFACTURE EVIDENCE OF “CONSCIOUSNESS”\n\n     In deposition, Texas College’s counsel repeatedly asked Rollins\n\nquestions which could be misconstrued.       When Rollins said he\n\nremembered “falling,” counsel attempted to make it seem as though\n\nthe witness was saying that he was conscious, but Rollins had to\n\ncorrect the effort of misdirection:\n\n     Q. Don't remember if you slipped.\n     A. No.\n     Q. Don't remember if you stumbled?\n     A. No.\n     Q. But you do remember falling down on the floor.\n     A. Yes.\n     Q. So, you were conscious the whole time.\n     A. I don't know if I was conscious or not. When I hit the\n        floor -- right at this time, I don't know what happened.\n     Q. But do you -- you recall falling down, right?\n     A. Yes.\n     Q. You don't recall -- I mean, you recall holding on and then\n        you fell down.\n     A. And that's all I remember.\n\n(CCR 4:313-314).\n\n\n\n\n                                      25\n\f     The testimony above makes it clear that Mr. Rollins lost\n\nconsciousness or most likely lost consciousness. Despite counsels’\n\ncontinued attempt to get Mr. Rollins to admit to consciousness\n\nduring the fall, the witness simply stated: that he remembered falling\n\n(as in being standing, then being on the ground) – not that he\n\nremembered the entire sequence of the fall.\n\n     This testimony was not clearly presented to the trial court, but\n\ninstead paraphrased: “Rollins has no explanation as to how he fell;;\n\njust that he fell.” See TC’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT, p. 2. (CCR\n\n4:250).\n\n     Ironically, when cross examined by counsel for MPF, the\n\nsyncope explanation becomes more likely:\n\n     Q. All right, Mr. Rollins. You testified that before the October\n        22nd incident you had an issue where you were driving\n        home and you started to black out; is that correct?\n     A. Yes.\n     Q. Okay. Is it a possibility that the day that you fell off the lift\n        that you blacked out and fell on it?\n     A. I really don’t know how to answer that because I really don’t\n        know what happened that day.\n     Q. (BY MR. GEDDIE) Okay. So you agree with me that that’s a\n        possibility that you blacked out that day.\n     A. Again, my response is I don’t know exactly what happened.\n     Q. Can you think of any reason why it could not be an\n        explanation for your fall that you blacked out?\n                                   26\n\f     A. No.\n\n(CCR 2:155-156) (emphasis added). Rollins explanation might be\n\nsimple, but it makes sense: “I shouldn't have been on it.”       (CCR\n\n4:317).\n\n     THE CONDITION OF THE LIFT AND TRAINING\n\n     The lift had been rented by Texas College from MPF.         (CCR\n\n5:469). According to Brackens, who signed off on the lift, there was\n\nno owner’s manual on board the lift.     (CCR 2:162). Mr. Bracken’s\n\ntestified that although he was given instruction on “how to operate”\n\nthe lift, he did not pass that training onto his subordinates:\n\n     Q. But you didn’t’ turn around and show or train your\n        subordinates how to operate it?\n     A. My subordinates had already been trained, because that is\n        not the first time that we had a scissor lift on the premises\n        and was used.\n     Q. And is proof of training kept in their personnel files?\n     A. No.\n     Q. Why?\n     A. That I can’t answer.\n\n(CCR 2:162).    Rollins swore that MFP (A-1) “did not offer us\n\ntraining” or “familiarize us with the lift.”          (CCR 25:4133)\n\n(emphasis added).    Mr. Harris, agreed that “untrained employees\n\nshouldn’t be on scissor lifts.” (CCR 7:863).\n\n\n\n\n                                  27\n\f     Rollins “hadn’t been trained” and “didn’t know how to operate\n\nit.) (CCR 25:4134). Rollins was “present outside the gym when A·1\n\nRent All delivered the scissor lift to Texas College.” (CCR 25:4143).\n\nHe “asked the delivery person if A·1 would bring the lift inside the\n\ngym and who was going to show [them] how to use it.” Id. “The A·1\n\nperson informed [Rollins] that he couldn't bring the lift indoors and\n\nthat the folks at Texas College knew how to use the lift.” Id. Rollins\n\nstated that “A-1 did not offer us training nor did it familiarize us with\n\nthe lift. The person from A·1 just came and delivered the machine\n\nand left.” Id.\n\n     When asked about what training could have made a difference,\n\nMr. Rollins testified as follows:\n\n     Q. Here's my question, and I'm trying to make sure that I'm\n        clear about it: What training could you have been given, if\n        any, if you know, that would have enabled you to get on the\n        lift or get off of it onto the floor any better than you did?\n     A. Any proper training that someone that already knew how to\n        use the lift or someone that already was licensed to use the\n        lift.\n     Q. (BY MR. YARBROUGH) Is that your answer?\n     A. Yes.\n     Q. And how would that specifically have helped you do\n        anything different?\n     A. Then I would have been trained to know how to use it and\n        to get on and off the proper way, operate it the proper way.\n\n                                    28\n\f        But it still -- I was still afraid to get on it, period; so, I\n        shouldn't have been on it.\n\n(CCR 4:316-317) (emphasis added).\n\n     THE INJURY\n\n     Mr. Rollins testified that as soon as he fell, he was “hurting” in\n\nthe “back of my neck.” (CCR 4:314). He had no prior complaints\n\nabout neck pain:\n\n     Q. Yeah. What I'm asking is after you recovered from the first\n        surgery to your neck, two months after that before the\n        incident at Texas College on October 22, 2013, had you\n        complained of pain in your neck\"?\n     A. No, I had not complained about pain in my neck.\n\n(CCR 4:318).\n\n     In his report to the trial court, Dr. Gilbert Martinez, noted the\n\nlink between the fall and Rollins’ neck injury:\n\n          Correspondence on July 18, 2014, by Dr. Barnett includes\n     the opinion that there was reasonable medical probability\n     that Mr. Rollins suffered an acute herniated disc at C4-C5\n     and spinal cord contusion caused by the fall on October 22,\n     2013, and that he would have chronic pain in his neck and\n     spinal cord dysfunction as a result of the injury.\n\nREPORT OF GILBERT MARTINEZ PHD (CCR 6:611). The photos are telling:\n\n\n\n\n                                  29\n\fREPORT   OF   JOE G. GONZALES, MD (CCR 6:674). Dr. Martinez’ Report\n\ncontinues:\n\n     3. Mr. Rollins will benefit from a comprehensive pain\n     management program with a focus on interventions designed to\n     reduce the effects of acute and chronic and pain. This should\n     include evaluation by a medical pain specialist who can\n     evaluate Mr. Rollins' potential for benefiting from medical\n     procedures designed to alleviating chronic pain, as well as\n     participation in various therapies designed to improve physical\n     and behavioral adjustment of individuals with chronic pain.\n     Such programs typically include a brief inpatient\n     hospitalization for initial evaluation, medication management,\n     and intensive therapy, followed by a more extended course of\n     outpatient therapy.\n     4. In addition to the effects of his physical problems, Mr. Rollins'\n     chronic reactive depression will contribute to his functional\n     disability and will have a negative impact on his long-term\n     vocational adjustment. Life care planning should account for\n     Mr. Rollins' significantly diminished occupational potential.\n                                  30\n\fREPORT OF GILBERT MARTINEZ, PHD (CCR 6:620). The prognosis if poor\n\nfor Gary Rollins:\n\n           Based on the known medical conditions, Mr. Gary L.\n     Rollins will have lifelong, progressive symptoms, physical\n     impairment and subsequent disability which will require long-\n     term medical care.\n\nREPORT OF JOE G GONZALES, MD (CCR 6:628).\n\n                    SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n\n     When one seeks to win by excluding key evidence on the basis\n\nof strategic, technical grounds, one must live and die by the technical\n\nand strategic failures of one’s own motions. Rather than argue the\n\nmerits of this case, Texas College and MPF launched a technical war\n\nand jointly attempted to eliminate all relevant testimony, affidavits,\n\nexpert reports, operating manuals, and relevant medical records from\n\nthe record. Instead, they failed to convince the court to strike key\n\nparts of Rollins’ Affidavit, they lost a key battle over Doctor Reports\n\nwhich they introduced and referenced without objection, and they\n\nactually introduced the majority of the testimony which proves their\n\nown liability.\n\n\n\n\n                                  31\n\f     Moreover, many of the evidentiary objections were simply\n\nwithout merit.    If revisited by this Court, even more summary\n\njudgment evidence supporting appellants’ claims will surface.\n\n     Finally, even on the remote chance more evidence is needed,\n\nthis Court should reverse the trial courts denial of the motion to re-\n\nopen the evidence.\n\n                            ARGUMENT\n\n\n\n1.

In a particularly instructive passage, the Desiga court\n\nstated:\n\n          However, in view of the unique circumstances of this case,\n     we find this omission to be not fatal as to Dr. Guerrero's\n     summary judgment for the following reasons.

THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GRANTING TEXAS\n     COLLEGE’S TRADITIONAL AND NO EVIDENCE MOTION\n     FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n\n     Because the trial court did not hold oral argument and because\n\nits orders are silent as to any reasoning, this brief will examine the\n\nrationale behind appellees’ motions.\n\n     NATURE OF CLAIMS INVOLVED\n\n     Texas College’s motion is chock full of inapplicable premises\n\nliability cases, as well as cases in which there was no evidence of\n\nunusual danger.     Here, there is a singular sterling difference\n\nbetween the facts of this case and the facts of any case cited in\n\nsupport of Texas College’s motion. It is the truly insane and\n\nspiteful order for Rollins to “get up there” and finish the work.\n\n                                  39\n\fThe order was given despite both Brackens and Harris knowing that\n\nRollins was “unfit” for the job due to his “black-out” spells. Appellee’s\n\nmotions would have this court adopt the standard of liability provided\n\nby Harris in his deposition:\n\n     Q. So, you're now going to testify -- or are you testifying now\n        that if a manager knows that an employee is suffering\n        from seizures, the employee should get on the scissor\n        lift if the manager says get up there and do it, is that\n        what you're telling me?\n     B. Yes.\n\n(CCR 7:868). This is not the law. It should not be the law. None of\n\nthe cases cited in the motions involve the commanding of an\n\nemployee to do a knowingly unsafe act – an act which is not unsafe\n\nbecause of a premises condition – but is unsafe because the plaintiff\n\nwas physically “unfit” for the job – he had fainting spells.\n\n     This is not a premises liability case.         The only place in\n\nappellants’ pleadings which the word “premises” appears is the\n\nprayer: “WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Plaintiffs pray….”\n\n(CCR 498-505, 8th Amended) (CCR 92-101, 7th Amended) (CCR 83-\n\n91, 6th Amended). This case involves active and grossly negligent\n\nsupervision. As to Texas College, Rollins plead:\n\n         Defendant's failure to: 1) provide a reasonably safe\n     workplace; 2) furnish reasonably safe machinery or reasonably\n\n                                   40\n\f        safe personal protective equipment for use with the Lift and for\n        use in lifting the marble slab counter top; 3) provide adequate\n        help in the performance of work; 4) train and/or properly\n        supervise Plaintiff Garry Rollins while using the Lift and lifting\n        the marble slab counter top; and 5) to ensure that Plaintiff\n        Garry Rollins was fit to perform work on a scissor lift.\n7TH AMENDED PETITION (CCR 1:96) (emphasis added).\n        THE ELEMENTS AND THE EVIDENCE\n\n  1. Duty and Breach of Duty\n\n        Tex. Labor Code Ann. § 406.033 eliminates significant defenses\n\nin nonsubscriber cases such as this. The provision reads in pertinent\n\npart:\n\n        “… it is not a defense that:\n             (1) the employee was guilty of contributory negligence;\n             (2) the employee assumed the risk of injury or death;\n        or\n              (3) the injury or death was caused by the negligence of a\n        fellow employee.\n\nId.

Indeed, loading purchases into vehicles is a task\nperformed regularly—without any special training or\nassistance—by customers throughout the grocery and retail\nindustry. While there is evidence that grocery carts had rolled\ninto vehicles due to the parking lot's slope and may have posed\na foreseeable risk of damage to customers' vehicles, this is no\nevidence that the slope posed a foreseeable risk of injury to\nKroger's employees. Elwood presented NO EVIDENCE that his\nJOB REQUIRED SPECIALIZED TRAINING. See Nat'l\nConvenience Stores, 987 S.W.2d at 149. Elwood testified that,\nprior to working at Kroger, he knew it was dangerous to place\nhis hand in a vehicle's doorjamb. Moreover, there is NO\nEVIDENCE that carts with wheel locks or ADDITIONAL\nPERSONNEL WERE NECESSARY to safely load groceries. See\nAllsup's Convenience Stores, 934 S.W.2d at 438.\n      Kroger had no duty to warn Elwood of a danger known to\nall and NO OBLIGATION TO provide training or equipment to\nDISSUADE an employee from using a vehicle doorjamb for\nleverage.

The highlighted matters\n\nare discussed below:\n\n             a) Ordinary Care\n\n     First and foremost:      Is there really any doubt that a\n\nsupervisor who knows his employee is having “black outs” is not\n\nexercising “ordinary care” when he instructs that employee to\n\n“get up there” in a scissor lift and patch the gym ceiling? Mr.\n\nElwood’s supervisors did not tell him to “get over there and put your\n\nhand in the door jamb.”\n\n             b) Duty to provide assistance\n\n     Second, the facts here show that Texas College breached the\n\nduty to provide assistance.   Recall that on October 21st Brackens\n\ntold Rollins that he “had to GET UP THERE and get it done.\" (CCR\n\n4:303) (emphasis added). But Rollins had safely gotten off the lift\n\nand directed his assistants do the work. He “…stayed up there about\n\nfive minutes on the 21st showing him what needed to be done, and\n\nhim and a community service finished off.”       (CCR 4:297).    Mr.\n\nBrackens had been apparently upset by that fact.       So later that\n\nafternoon “…Mr. Bracket [sic] had told them that [Rollins] said [he]\n\nwasn’t going to get up there and do it….” (CCR 4:298). So, once\n\n                                 44\n\fagain, Rollins was ordered to get up there. “That was on a Monday\n\nwhen Mr. Harris direct me Tuesday morning GET UP THERE and\n\nget it done.” (CCR 4:309) (emphasis added). Rather than let Rollins\n\nuse the assistance of his subordinates to do the patching, as he was\n\nattempting to do on the 21st, Brackens and Harris got mad about it,\n\nand ordered him personally to “get up there” on the 22nd. They made\n\nthe order, knowing he had been having “black outs.” The evidence\n\nshows without a doubt that Texas College breached the duty to\n\nprovide needed assistance as set forth in Elwood.\n\n             c) No Duty to Warn\n\n     Here, Rollins is not complaining that Texas College should have\n\nwarned him of something he already knew (that it was dangerous for\n\nhim to get on the lift in his condition). He certainly knew that. He is\n\ncomplaining that despite the fact that his employer also knew it, the\n\nemployer ordered him to take the risk he did not want to take. This\n\nis not a “failure to warn” case. It is an “ordered to do it” case –\n\ninvolving active and gross negligence.\n\n     Very recently, the Texas Supreme Court answered questions\n\nwhich had been certified to it by the United States Court of Appeal\n\nfor the Fifth Circuit. In the case of Austin v. Kroger Texas, L.P., 465\n\n                                  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span>\n\f<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 2015), the Texas Supreme Court surveyed the\n\nlandscape of cases relating to employer duty in non-subscriber cases.\n\nAlthough most of the opinion deals with questions of liability relating\n\nto premises defects, the Court mentioned an exception to the “no-\n\nduty” rule in premises cases, which has at least some logical bearing\n\nhere:\n\n             Instead, the Court's abolition of the no-duty rule should\n        play a role only when an exception to the general rule applies—\n        that is, when the nonsubscribing employer owes a duty\n        despite the obviousness or employee's appreciation of a\n        danger because, despite the awareness of the danger, it is\n        necessary that the employee use the dangerous premises and\n        the employer should anticipate that THE EMPLOYEE IS\n        UNABLE TO TAKE MEASURES TO AVOID THE RISK. In such\n        cases, the employer cannot rely on the fact that the risk\n        was obvious and known to the employee to argue that the\n        employee bears some portion of the responsibility for his\n        own injuries, because the TWCA waives those defenses.\n        Compare Del Lago, 307 S.W.3d at 772–73; Parker, 565 S.W.2d\n        at 520, with Tex. Lab. Code § 406.033(a); Keng, 23 S.W.3d at\n        352.\n\nId. at 210 (emphasis added). Here there is active negligence, but even\n\nif it were a premises case, it would be excepted from the no-duty to\n\nwarn rule, because Rollins, being ordered to “get up there,” was\n\n“unable to take measures to avoid the risk.”       Once he obeys the\n\n\n\n\n                                   46\n\fmaster’s orders, the risk is unavoidable. He is up high, in harm’s\n\nway, subject to “blacking out.”\n\n             d) Negligent Supervision, Negligent Training\n\n     In addition, as the Texas Supreme Court noted in Austin:\n\n           Thus, when a claim does not result from contemporaneous\n     activity, the invitee has no negligent-activity claim, and his\n     claim sounds exclusively in premises-liability. See Shumake,\n     199 S.W.3d at 284; Keetch, 845 S.W.2d at 265.\n          But when the landowner is also an employer and the\n     invitee is also its employee, this additional relationship\n     may give rise to additional duties, such as a DUTY TO\n     PROVIDE NECESSARY EQUIPMENT, TRAINING, OR\n     SUPERVISION. …..\n            When an injury arises from a premises condition, it is often\n     the case that any resulting claim sounds exclusively in premises\n     liability, but that is not necessarily the case. An injury can have\n     more than one proximate cause. Del Lago, 307 S.W.3d at 774;\n     Lee Lewis Constr., Inc. v. Harrison, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1591675\"><a href=\"/opinion/1591675/lee-lewis-const-inc-v-harrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">778</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 784\n     (Tex.2001). The fact that Austin alleged that a condition of\n     the premises proximately caused his injury does not\n     preclude his allegation that Kroger's negligent failure to\n     provide the Spill Magic system also caused his injury. If the\n     only relationship between Austin and Kroger were that of\n     landowner–invitee, the alleged facts could only give rise to a\n     premises-liability claim. …..\n          AS AUSTIN'S EMPLOYER, KROGER OWED AUSTIN\n     duties in addition to its premises-liability duty and ITS\n     DUTY NOT TO ENGAGE IN NEGLIGENT ACTIVITIES,\n     including the duty to provide Austin with necessary\n     instrumentalities.\n\n\n\n\n                                  47\n\fId. at 215-16 (emphasis added). Here, there is not even an allegation\n\nof premises liability, such as in Austin. But it is clear that the Texas\n\nSupreme Court acknowledges the duties owed in this case.\n\n     The evidence of negligent supervision is glaring.    Not only did\n\nHarris and Brackens give Rollins a foolish order to “get up there”\n\n(CCR 4:303, 4:309), Brackens admitted that he had “leadership and\n\nauthority” problems (CCR 4:344). He had even suggested they put a\n\nladder on the platform to reach even higher. (CCR 4:303-304). This\n\nis a textbook “reasonable person” failure.\n\n     As far as negligent training, Brackens admitted that he did not\n\npass the training he received on to his subordinates. (CCR 3:162).\n\n(CCR 25:4133). Rollins “hadn’t been trained” and “didn’t know how\n\nto operate it.) (CCR 25:4134) Mr. Harris, agreed that “untrained\n\nemployees shouldn’t be on scissor lifts.” (CCR 7:863).\n\n             e) No Duty to Provide Unnecessary Assistance\n\n     This statement in Elwood is a non-sequitur.           Who needs\n\n“unnecessary” assistance? Here, to avoid undue risk, the assistance\n\nRollins wanted was necessary.       It is not outlandish to require a\n\nsupervisor with knowledge of the risk that one of his employees may\n\nsuddenly fall, to provide assistance and prevent it. See e.g.\n\n                                  48\n\fMcEachern v.

Here, there is no indication that untrained students were using\n\nthe scissor lift regularly. It goes without saying that elevating one’s\n\nself to the top of a gymnasium ceiling on a “scissor lift” is precarious.\n\n\n\n\n                                   49\n\f     (CCR 21:3467)\n\n               g) No evidence that the job required specialized\n                  training\n\n     Here, again the case facts are opposite Elwood. Even Mr. Harris\n\nsaid that that “untrained employees shouldn’t be on scissor lifts.”\n\n(CCR 7:863).\n\n               h) No evidence that additional personnel were\n                  necessary\n\n     Once again, this case is different from Elwood. Here, Rollins\n\nused additional personnel on the 21st without incident, and let them\n\nfinish the work. (CCR 4:297). But on the 22d, the order of “get up\n\n\n\n\n                                 50\n\fthere” forced him upon the lift, when using his subordinates would\n\nbe the safer choice.\n\n             i) No obligation to dissuade\n\n     Finally, this case is different from Elwood and its companions\n\nin that Rollins’ superiors were commanding him to take the\n\ndangerous action. They were not watching him do it on his own and\n\nfailing to “dissuade” him. They were “persuading” him to do it under\n\nthreat of insubordination and possible termination. As the Texas\n\nSupreme Court Stated in Austin: “an employee always has the option\n\nto decline to perform an assigned task and incur the consequences\n\nof that decision.” 465 S.W.3d at 214 (citing in jest, the long abrogated\n\nMcKee v.

The plaintiff here\n     collected benefits under the Workmen's Compensation Act,\n     Vernon's Ann.Civ.St. art. 8306 et seq.

Texas College commanded Rollins to\n\n“get up there” without any training, and more importantly, while\n\nknowing he had been suffering “black-outs.”         This simple act\n\nbreached all of these duties.\n\n  2.

(CCR 25:4134).      By simple logic, the\n\nfall would not have occurred had he not been ordered to “get up\n\nthere.”\n\n     The accident was foreseeable here.      It simply defies logic to\n\nbelieve that Brackens should not have foreseen the possibility of\n\nRollins falling. Rollins informed both Harris and Brackens that he\n\n“was now having dizziness and blackout spells.” ROLLINS AFFIDAVIT\n\n(CCR 25:4132).    They had removed him from driving duty (CCR\n\n25:4132), presumably to prevent an accident.\n\n     Certainly an order to engage in a negligent activity can be the\n\nproximate cause of an accident.

Similarly, an order to “get up there”\n\nknowing the possibility of a black out, can be the proximate cause of\n\na fall.\n\n              b) Medical Causation\n\n      It is assumed that Appellees worked so hard at the trial court\n\nlevel to exclude the doctor’s reports because they knew they needed\n\nto defeat Rollins on the issue of medical causation.        They tried\n\nmightily to eliminate proof that the fall caused Rollins’ neck injury.\n\nBut they succeeded only in excluding the letter from Rollins’ treating\n\nphysician Samuel Barnett, MD. They did this by convincing the lower\n\ncourt that the letter had not been properly authenticated. However,\n\nit was properly authenticated as will be shown below in the next\n\nargument. Nonetheless, there are two reasons why excluding Dr.\n\nBarnett’s letter is irrelevant.\n\n      First, in a personal injury and fall case, lay testimony on\n\ninjury causation is sufficient:\n\n                                    54\n\f           …non-expert evidence may be sufficient to support a\n     finding of causation in cases where both the occurrence and the\n     medical conditions complained of are such that the general\n     experience and common sense of lay persons are sufficient to\n     evaluate the conditions and whether they were probably caused\n     by the occurrence.\nCity of Dallas v.

Rollins’\n\naffidavit also indicates that immediately after the fall, he “could not\n\nmove at first” and “eventually” rolled over onto his feet.        (CCR\n\n25:4134). Rollins described the fall as “I just fell flat on my back and\n\nmy neck.” (CCR 4:311).     Dr. Barnett’s surgery discharge summary\n\nin the medical records filed by Texas College shows that his major\n\nneck surgery happened on October 26, just a few days after the\n\nOctober 22nd fall. (CCR 8:1050). The records also indicate a primary\n\ndiagnoses of “syncope and collapse.” (CCR 8:983). Certainly this is a\n\nstrong, logically traceable connection between the event and the\n\ncondition.\n\n     Second, the attempt at excluding the Dr. Reports failed. The\n\ntrial court denied the motion to strike them, and they contained the\n\nvery same information appellees were seeking to exclude by keeping\n\nout the Barnett letter. The disclosure responses which incorporated\n\n                                  56\n\fthe reports, were specifically used as summary judgment evidence.\n\n(CCR 2:109) (See reference to summary judgment exhibit “H” -\n\nPlaintiffs' Fifth Supplemental Responses to Requests for Disclosure.).\n\nThe language of the reports leaves little doubt as to medical\n\ncausation:\n\n          Correspondence on July 18, 2014, by Dr. Barnett includes\n     the opinion that there was reasonable medical probability\n     that Mr. Rollins suffered an acute herniated disc at C4-C5\n     and spinal cord contusion caused by the fall on October 22,\n     2013, and that he would have chronic pain in his neck and\n     spinal cord dysfunction as a result of the injury.\n\nREPORT OF GILBERT MARTINEZ PHD (CCR 6:611).\n\n     In summary, there is ample evidence of duty, breach of duty,\n\nand causation. It was all still before the court after the onslaught of\n\nexclusionary rulings.   The summary judgment granted in favor of\n\nTexas College should be reversed.\n\n     ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE WAS IMPROPERLY STRICKEN\n\n     Even if one assumes that somehow more evidence is needed to\n\ndefeat Texas College’s summary judgment motion, more evidence can\n\nbe considered (see argument, infra). The trial court made numerous\n\nbasic errors when it granted Texas College’s Motion to Strike\n\nEvidence (and related references in appellants’ response). Since the\n\n\n                                  57\n\forder itself contains most of the text of what was stricken, it serves\n\nas an easy guide to follow with the argument. It is contained in the\n\nappendix as “FEB 9 ORDER ON TC EVIDENCE OBJECTIONS.”\n\n        1. Bracken’s Deposition Excerpts\n\n     A brief review of page 2 of the order indicates that the court\n\nstruck evidence to which Mr. Brackens was qualified to speak. He\n\nindicated that he had received “scissor lift” training in his deposition.\n\n(CCR 2:162).      Moreover, he is simply reading the conditions\n\nprescribed by a regulation and then stating (with his personal\n\nknowledge) that the conditions required “did not take place.” (CCR\n\n24: 3926).\n\n  2. Owner’s Manual\n\n     This was excluded on page 3 of the order. Perhaps it was not\n\nnoticed, but the manual was authenticated during Mike Frazier’s\n\nDeposition:\n\n     Q. (BY MR. SIGMON) Have you ever seen this document\n        before?\n     A. sure.\n     Q. Okay. What is this?\n     A. This is the operation and safety manual that's inside the\n        scissor lift.\n\n\n\n\n                                   58\n\f(CCR 20:3319). It is certainly relevant and Mr. Frazier is certainly\n\nqualified. He is the “Manager of A-1 Rent All.” (CCR 2:172). It should\n\nnot have been excluded.\n\n  3. Rollins Affidavit\n\n     Parts of the Rollins affidavit were redacted based upon the order\n\nof the Court.   Although the redacted version was plenty to support\n\nthe statement of facts set forth in this brief, some additional relevant\n\nmaterial should not have been taken from the affidavit.\n\n     The objection labelled “D-3” on page 4-5 of the order should not\n\nhave been sustained. Mr. Rollins is perfectly qualified to authenticate\n\nthe excuses given to him by his Doctors.\n\n     The objection labelled “D-6” on page 5 of the order should not\n\nhave been sustained. Mr. Rollins is qualified to testify as to what his\n\ndoctor told him, and it is clearly admissible hearsay, because it is a\n\nstatement made for the purpose of medical diagnoses and is\n\nadmissible pursuant to 803(4) of the Texas Rules of Evidence.\n\n     The objection labelled “D-7” on page 5 of the order should not\n\nhave been sustained. It is not hearsay. He is simply stating what he\n\nwas directed to do. Moreover, he is qualified to authenticate a note\n\ngiven to him by his doctor.\n\n                                  59\n\f  4. Barnett Letter\n\n     The objection labelled “D-15” on page 7 of the order should not\n\nhave been sustained. This is Mr. Rollins’ authentication of the letter\n\nfrom Dr. Barnett, the non-paid, treating physician who performed the\n\nsurgery on Rollins. In its motion to exclude, Texas College did not\n\nobject to the effort of Mr. Rollins to authenticate it. That is no doubt\n\nbecause they were aware of the significant body of law allowing lay\n\nwitnesses to identify and authenticate correspondence.         See, e.g.\n\nHubenak v. San Jacinto Gas Transmission Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894542\"><a href=\"/opinion/894542/hubenak-v-san-jacinto-gas-transmission-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 177\n\n(Tex. 2004) (Dunwoody's affidavit also authenticates correspondence\n\nthat passed between the condemnors and the landowners).\n\nMoreover, the bar on authentication is very low.

The objection in its entirety is as\n\nfollows:\n\n           This portion within Section 6 of Mr. Rollins' affidavit\n     should be stricken and not considered by the Court because the\n     information is hearsay. The letter attached to Rollins'\n     affidavit as Exhibit D is incompetent hearsay for which no\n     exception applies. Mr. Rollins' sole purpose for including such\n     records is to prove the truth of the matter asserted by Mr.\n     Rollins. Therefore, Texas College's objection to this portion of\n     Mr. Rollins' affidavit and the exhibit referenced should be\n     sustained, and this portion and the exhibit stricken and\n     disregarded by the Court.\n(CCR 22:3678) (emphasis added). The objection is simply erroneous\n\nand inapplicable. Rule 803(4) specifically reads as follows:\n\n     (4) Statement Made for Medical Diagnosis or Treatment. A\n     statement that:\n           (A) is made for--and is reasonably pertinent to--medical\n           diagnosis or treatment; and\n           (B) describes medical history; past or present symptoms or\n           sensations; their inception; or their general cause.\n\nTX R EVID Rule 803. A simple review of the letter indicates that it is\n\nprecisely what the rule applies to. See BARNETT LETTER (in Appendix).\n\nThe Barnett letter should not have been excluded.\n\n     THE TRIAL COURT SHOULD HAVE REOPENED THE EVIDENCE\n\n     Appellants sought leave to introduce two pieces of evidence in\n\nits motion to re-open the evidence. However, they now complain only\n\n                                 61\n\fabout the trial court’s refusal to consider the Barnett Affidavit. See\n\nBARNET AFFIDAVIT (in Appendix). Dr. Barnett's sworn affidavit offers\n\nnearly the exact same information that is contained in the Barnett\n\nLetter. See BARNETT LETTER (in Appendix).        Thus, this appellate\n\nrequest is superfluous in the event that this Court agrees that the\n\nletter was properly authenticated.     Moreover, since the opinions of\n\nDr. Barnett were also summarized by Dr. Gonzales in his report, this\n\nargument is, in reality, a fourth tier of insurance. For this issue to\n\nbe decisive, this Court would first have to: (1) reject Rollins’ lay\n\ntestimony combined with the medical records already in evidence, (2)\n\nreject the use of Dr. Gonzales report, and (3) rule that Rollins was\n\nunqualified to authenticate correspondence about his own treatment\n\nfrom his treating physician. Nevertheless, in the event of such a slim\n\npossibility, this Court should then concern itself with fairness - not\n\ntechnicalities.\n\n     A trial court may permit a party to offer other additional\n\nevidence when it \"clearly appears to be necessary to the due\n\nadministration of justice.\" Tex. R. Civ. P. 270. In determining whether\n\nto grant a motion to reopen, the trial court considers whether: (1) the\n\nmoving party showed due diligence in obtaining the evidence, (2) the\n\n                                  62\n\fproffered evidence is decisive, (3) reception of such evidence will\n\ncause undue delay, and (4) the Court's refusal will cause an injustice.\n\nWord of Faith World Outreach v.

App. 1997) the Court of Appeals reversed a directed defense\n\nverdict in a case involving a death due to improper operation of a\n\ncrane. Among the significant facts of the case, the court described\n\nthe following:\n\n           …there was no operator's manual present, and, that the\n     operator's manual that should have been in the crane contained\n     specific instructions to avoid moving the crane until all\n     personnel are clear. Wiethorn further testified that there was no\n     load chart to comply with the American National Standards\n     Institute (ANSI) within the crane. The operator's manual was\n     required by OSHA and ANSI to be kept in the cab at all\n     times. According to Wiethorn, OSHA and ANSI standards\n     applied to this particular crane and Coastal could have easily\n     provided the people who worked with the crane with the\n     pertinent OSHA standards regarding its operation. He testified\n     that proper operation of a crane calls for the operator to be\n     thoroughly conversant with the crane's operating manual,\n     which the crane operator could not have done in this case\n     because it was not present in the cab.\n\nId. at 760-61 (emphasis added).        The court indicated that even\n\nthough the general contractor [Coastal] did not control the crane,\n\n“Coastal had a responsibility to ensure a safe and suitable crane…”\n\nId. at 761.

While OSHA was written to protect employees,\n     an unsafe practice for an employee applies equally well to a\n     customer who legitimately finds himself in the same geographic\n     space as the employee. Safety principles don't change\n     depending on whether the victim is an employee, a customer, or\n     a passerby. Therefore it has relevance to the standard of care.\n     It doesn't establish negligence per se, and it does not create a\n     separate cause of action. Melerine v.

JLG OWNER'S MANUAL \"FOREWORD.”\n\n(CCR 23:3766) (emphasis added). Nothing more need be said. There\n\nis a duty.\n\n  2. Breach of duty\n\n     Here, there was no owner’s manual on board the lift.\n\n(CCR 2:162).    Rollins swore that MFP (A-1) “did not offer us\n\ntraining” or “familiarize us with the lift.”          (CCR 25:4133)\n\n(emphasis added). The MPF [A-1] delivery crew did not bother to\n\ncome in and train Rollins, even though he inquired. They told him\n\nthat Texas College already “knew how to use the lift.”      Id.   (CCR\n\n25:4143). Rollins stated that “A-1 did not offer us training nor did it\n\n                                  67\n\ffamiliarize us with the lift.   The person from A·1 just came and\n\ndelivered the machine and left.” Id. Of course the “machine” had no\n\nmanual. The duty was breached.\n\n  3. Proximate Cause\n\n     Rollins “hadn’t been trained” and “didn’t know how to operate\n\nit.) (CCR 25:4134) Mr. Harris, agreed that “untrained employees\n\nshouldn’t be on scissor lifts.” (CCR 7:863). When asked about what\n\ntraining could have made a difference, Mr. Rollins testified that he\n\n“would have been trained to know how to use it and to get on and off\n\nthe proper way…” (CCR 4:316-317).\n\n     Most importantly, section 2.1 of the manual reads:\n\n          The aerial platform is a personnel handling device; so it is\n     necessary that it be operated and maintained only by trained\n     personnel.\n          Persons under the influence of drugs or alcohol or who are\n     subject to seizures, dizziness or loss of physical control\n     must not operate this machine.\n\nJLG OWNER'S MANUAL at 2-1 (CR 23:3341) (uncorrected record).

This is\n\ncertainly more than a scintilla of evidence on proximate cause.\n\n\n                                  68\n\f     ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE WAS IMPROPERLY STRICKEN\n\n       1. Owner’s Manual\n\n     The objections to the admission of the owner’s manual is\n\nludicrous. First and foremost, it is part of the equipment that they\n\nadmittedly rented. Second, a copy (as asserted by MPF) was already\n\nin their possession. It was produced at Mike Frazier’s Deposition and\n\nproperly authenticated:\n\n     (Plaintiff's Exhibit 4 marked.)\n     MR. SIGMON: Let me hand you what' a being marked as\n        Plaintiff's 4.\n     THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. Closing these so I have some room.\n        Okay, sir.\n     Q. (BY MR. SIGMON) Have you ever seen this document before?\n     A. sure.\n     Q. Okay. What is this?\n     A. This is the operation and safety manual that's inside\n        the scissor lift.\n     Q. Okay. So this is an operation and safety manual from JLG,\n        correct?\n     A. Yes.\n     Q. JLG is the manufacturer of the model 1930es right?\n     A. Yes.\n     Q, Which is the same model that you rented to Texas College\n        that is involved in this lawsuit, right?\n     A. Yes.\n     Q, Now, on the front page down in the left-hand portion of the\n        page, you see four letters? You see those four letters?\n     A. The AN -- the ANI -- ANSI?\n     Q. Yes,\n     A.

American National Safety Institute.\n     Q. So you'd agree with me that the American National Safety\n        Institute has put its logo on the front of this owner's\n        manual, right?\n     MR. GEDDIE: Objection, form.\n     A. It's yes, it's on there.\n\n(CCR 20:3318-3319). As one can see, the objection that “plaintiffs\n\nhave failed to establish its authenticity or relevance, or lay any proper\n\npredicate for the admissibility of same, either through a qualified\n\nwitness or otherwise,” as set forth in MPF’s filing (CCR 22:3720) is\n\nbaseless.\n\n     Moreover, one can look at the objections filed by MPF\n\n(CCR 22:3718-3725) and discern that they are (in large part) stock\n\nobjections, edited and filed without any supporting evidence, and in\n\nmany cases lacking detail. MPF objected to the manual on the basis\n\nthat it was not produced timely in violation of Texas Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 193.6(a). (CCR 22:3719-3720). But the objection is a\n\n“stock objection,” taken off the shelf and pressed without any\n\nsupporting evidence or explanation. Bare stock objections filed in\n\nwriting - with no oral hearing, no evidence, or explanation - should\n\n\n\n\n                                   70\n\fbe given short shrift by this Court. As shown in the argument above,\n\nthe manual is probative. It was authenticated. It is admissible.\n\n         2. Rollins Affidavit\n\n     MPF objected to the Rollins affidavit on the grounds that it was\n\na sham and should “be stricken in its entirety. (CCR 22:3720).\n\nHowever the trial court did not exclude the entire affidavit, but rather\n\npainstakingly edited it in response to Texas College’s objections.\n\n     MPF alternatively asked the court to, at a minimum, exclude\n\n“the statements that directly contradict” his testimony. Id. Because\n\nMPF sought an alternative form of relief, the objection is multifarious.\n\nCompounding the confusion, the order is vague. It is simply a check\n\nline with a check mark in it, placed in the “sustained” column. See\n\nFEB 9 ORDER   ON   MPF EVIDENCE OBJECTIONS p. 2 (CCR 24:3937) (also\n\nin appendix). There is no way for this Court to discern which one of\n\nthe alternative forms of relief was granted by looking solely at the\n\norder.   However, because the trial court did edit the affidavit to\n\nexclude the testimony referenced in the alternative plea (CCR\n\n24:3930-3931) (Texas College objection 13 sustained), one can\n\ndiscern that the trial court did not strike the affidavit entirely, but\n\n\n\n                                  71\n\fgranted the lesser relief. Thus, this Court should consider the entire\n\naffidavit (subject to Texas College objection 13) as to MPF.\n\n  3. Thorpe Affidavit\n\n     Appellees filed a joint motion to strike the affidavit of appellants’\n\naerial lift safety expert, Burt Thorpe.     See THORPE AFFIDAVIT (CR\n\n23:3402-3409) (original record) (also in appendix).        Tellingly, the\n\nmotion to strike the affidavit did not emphasize unfair surprise or\n\nprejudice. That is because there was none.\n\n     The issues presented in the Motion were: whether Plaintiffs\n\ntimely disclosed Burt Thorpe; whether the disclosure was sufficient;\n\nand whether Plaintiffs' supplemental designations passed muster of\n\nthe discovery rules and in no way constitute unfair surprise,\n\nprejudice or trial by ambush. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 193.6(b).\n\n     It was undisputed that the trial court's scheduling order\n\nrequired Plaintiffs' to designate all experts by October 16, 2014.\n\nPlaintiffs met the deadline with their October 13, 2014 Fourth\n\nSupplemental Disclosure adding Burt Thorpe as a safety expert.\n\n(CCR 6:710-718) Appellees argued that the supplemental October 13\n\ndisclosure was inadequate and therefore untimely per Rule 194.2(f).\n\n\n\n                                   72\n\f     Appellees cited Cunningham v. Columbia/St. David's Healthcare\n\nSystem, L.P., 185S.W.3d 7 (Tex.App.-Austin 2005) for support. In\n\nCunningham, the plaintiff was required to designate all experts by\n\nJune 29, 2004. Id. at 11. Plaintiff responded to a December 2003\n\nrequest for disclosure that she had not yet determined \"any testifying\n\nexpert witnesses\" and would supplement. Id. The June disclosure\n\ndeadline passed without plaintiff supplementing her response (i.e.\n\nshe provided no information about her expert). Id. On September 7,\n\n2004 (i.e. 90 days later) plaintiff attached her expert's affidavit for the\n\nfirst time, attempting to rely upon it as proof that her claims should\n\nsurvive summary judgment. Id. at 11. The appeals court affirmed\n\ndefendant's motion to strike on the grounds that plaintiff had herself\n\nconceded the designation was untimely and that she failed to satisfy\n\nher burden of showing either good cause or a lack of unfair surprise\n\nor prejudice. Id. at 13.\n\n     The facts here are distinguishable: at the time Rollins disclosed\n\nBurt Thorpe in October, he provided to appellees all of the\n\nrequirements of 194.2(f) including: his name, address and telephone\n\nnumber; the subject matter on which he was to testify; the general\n\nsubstance of his mental impressions and opinions; and his current\n\n                                    73\n\fresume.   See PLAINTIFFS' FOURTH SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE at 6-7\n\n(CCR 6:710-718). At the time of the disclosure, Plaintiffs expert had\n\nnot been provided any \"documents, tangible things, reports, models\n\nor data compilations\" per 194.2(f)(A). In fact, he had only been\n\nretained recently to testify about issues pertaining to safety and the\n\nlack thereof - not on medical or damages issues.       The difference\n\nbetween the substance of Plaintiffs' disclosure of Burt Thorpe in this\n\nmatter, (timely per the scheduling order) and the complete lack of\n\nresponse by the plaintiff in Cunningham is clear. The court in\n\nCunningham was absolutely correct in its judgment that the plaintiff\n\nhad not met her burden. There was no evidence of her expert's utter\n\nexistence prior to her summary judgment response, which is the\n\nepitome of \"unfair surprise\"- particularly in the context of a\n\ndispositive proceeding. Id. at 14. Here, Rollins met the initial\n\nrequirement of a timely disclosure per the rules and the Court's\n\nScheduling Order when he designated Mr. Thorpe on October 13.\n\n     Defendants received fair notice of Mr. Thorpe's participation as\n\nan expert; and were given the subject matter of his testimony, thus\n\nrefuting any claim of unfair surprise.

Ironically, with\n\nrespect to ANSI 92.6, MPF itself produced the same text on 6/26/14\n\nin response to Plaintiffs’ written request for production. (SR 13).\n\n     Both standards are discussed in the Thorpe affidavit. They are\n\nreferenced in response to requests for disclosure regarding Mr.\n\nThorpe’s testimony.      They are relevant.       Although the trial court\n\nsustained the objections, it should not have. Appellant submitted\n\nthe matters requesting “judicial notice of the Code of Federal\n\nRegulations, OSHA and ANSI provisions cited” therein, and gave\n\n“notice of their intent to rely” on them.

Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1568490\"><a href=\"/opinion/1568490/daugherty-v-southern-pacific-transp-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">772</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 1989) wherein\n\nthe Texas Supreme Court held that: (1) a court may take judicial\n\n                                     75\n\fnotice of OSHA regulations without such regulations being included\n\nin the pleadings, and (2) that the trial court committed reversible\n\nerror by not considering the OSHA regulation. See also Tex. R. Evid.\n\n201. It bears repeating that ANSI standards “form the basis for most\n\nOSHA standards.” Seale, 904 S.W.2d at 720. Since OSHA adopts\n\nANSI standards as its standards, the court was duty bound under\n\nRule 201 to take notice.\n\n     THE TRIAL COURT SHOULD HAVE REOPENED THE EVIDENCE\n\n     Appellants incorporate by reference the same argument made\n\nas to Texas College.\n\n                    CONCLUSION AND PRAYER\n\n\n     Wherefore, Appellants pray that this Court: (1) reverse the trial\n\ncourt’s order granting summary judgment in favor of Texas College;\n\n(2) reverse the trial court’s order granting summary judgment in favor\n\nof MPF Investments, LLC; and (3) remand the case for further\n\nproceedings.

Rollins' formal work title was \"Maintenance Technician\". His office was in the TC\n\nPhysical Plant (the \"Plant\").              Rollins reported to Roland Brackens, the Plant\n\nSuperintendent, and to James Harris, Vice President of Business and Finance at TC.\n\nRollins also supervised a three to four person maintenance crew.                           Rollins' overall\n\nresponsibility at TC included general maintenance, light construction, driving detail and\n\nessentially anything else the school required. He was hired to work at TC in 2008.\n\n11.     During September 2013, Rollins was asked by his supervisor to help move some\n\nmarble counter tops that were to be installed in the school's Science building. The\n\nslabs of marble themselves weighed anywhere from 150-185 pounds. TC asked Mr.\n\nRollins and one other worker to perform the task with no other assistance-man nor\n\nmachine. While moving the slab, Mr. Rollins sneezed/coughed, dropped the object and\n\nsuffered a momentary loss of consciousness. On or around September 9, 2013 Rollins\n\nsought emergency medical care because of the incident and was advised not to drive.\n\nRollins informed agents and employees of TC of his restriction and was subsequently\n\nremoved from a TC driving task that he had been performing on Tuesdays and\n\nThursdays. Upon information and belief, Mr. Brackens or Mr. Harris removed Rollins\n\nfrom the task.\n\n12.     A few weeks later, sometime during October 2013, the gymnasium ceiling at TC\n\nneeded repair. TC rented a hydraulic \"scissor lift\" (the \"Lift\") from defendant A-1 for\n\nPlaintiff Rollins and others to use while doing the repairs.\n\n13.     The Lift is capable of reaching upwards of approximately 20 feet from the ground\n\nand is often accompanied by a safety harness to prevent worker injury. TC did not rent\n\nPLAINTIFFS' SIXTH AMENDED PETITION                                                                        3\nMacintosh HD:Users:esigmon:Documents:CASES:Rollins-001 :Pleadings: Rollins Sixth Amended Petition .docx\n                                                                                        APPENDIX 17\n                                                                                                              Page 85\n\for purchase a harness for use with the Lift, nor did it purchase or rent any other\n\npersonal protective equipment needed to ensure worker safety. Upon information and\n\nbelief, A-1 did not offer or suggest that TC purchase or rent personal protective\n\nequipment for use with the Lift nor did it adequately confirm whether TC or its agents\n\nwere \"qualified personnel\" with the training and experience needed to safely operate the\n\nLift.   Upon information and belief, A-1 did not familiarize Rollins with the Lift and its\n\noperation nor did they offer to train Rollins. Rollins' immediate supervisor, Mr. Brackens\n\ndid not check or confirm whether A-1 Rent All included an owner/operator manual with\n\nthe Lift as required by its manufacturer, JLG.\n\n14.     On or around October 22, 2013 TC directed Rollins and others to use the Lift \"as\n\nis\" to make the repairs-minus training or supervision.                     After completing the work,\n\nRollins fell from the Lift as he was attempting to exit to safety. He immediately reported\n\nthe incident to the TC human resources department as required. At the time, Rollins\n\nassumed his fall had been relatively inconsequential as he was able to walk away\n\nunassisted.\n\n15.     Three days later, on or around October 25, 2013, Rollins lost sensation in his\n\nlegs and toes and was subsequently admitted to Zale Lipshy University Hospital in\n\nDallas Texas where he underwent invasive neck surgery.\n\n16.     Rollins is now convalescing at home, unable to walk unassisted and requires\n\nintensive at home physical therapy and care three times a week. He is no longer able\n\nto perform many of the household tasks he once did to assist his wife Carla with the\n\nmaintenance and care of their home.\n\n17.     On or around December 6, 2013 Rollins received correspondence from TC\n\nadvising him that he would be terminated if he does not return to work within 3 months.\n\nPLAINTIFFS' SIXTH AMENDED PETITION                                                                        4\nMacintosh HD:Users:esigmon:Documents:CASES:Rollins-001 :Pleadings: Rollins Sixth Amended Petition .docx\n                                                                                        APPENDIX 18\n                                                                                                              Page 86\n\f                                        CAUSES OF ACTION\n\nTEXAS COLLEGE - NEGLIGENCE AND GROSS NEGLIGENCE\n\n18.     Texas College was Rollins' employer at the time of his avoidable injury and owed\n\nhim a special duty of care at law. Texas College is a non-subscriber to Texas Worker's\n\nCompensation and does not carry any sort of insurance for work related injury.\n\nDefendant Texas College breached its duty of care to Rollins. Its breach includes and\n\nis not limited to Defendant's failure to: 1) provide a reasonably safe workplace; 2)\n\nfurnish reasonably safe machinery or reasonably safe personal protective equipment for\n\nuse with the Lift and for use in lifting the marble slab counter top; 3) provide adequate\n\nhelp in the performance of work; 4) train and/or properly supervise Plaintiff Garry Rollins\n\nwhile using the Lift and lifting the marble slab counter top; and 5) to ensure that Plaintiff\n\nGarry Rollins was fit to perform work on a scissor lift. The foregoing acts and omissions\n\nby TC constitute negligence and gross negligence.\n\nCHRISTIAN METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH - VICARIOUS LIABILITY, ALTER\nEGO, NEGLIGENCE AND GROSS NEGLIGENCE\n\n19.     During the time of Plaintiff Rollins' avoidable injury, Defendant CME represented\n\nto the public through documents on file with the Texas Secretary of State that TC\n\noperates under the \"supervision, care and ownership\" of CME. CME has and continues\n\nto represent to the general public that TC is one of its \"affiliate\" educational institutions,\n\nof which there are several.           CME makes extensive reference to TC throughout its\n\ninternal documentation and by-laws, and the role it plays in establishing TC policies and\n\nprocedures. CME also has a significant \"financial relationship\" with TC that has been\n\nreported to the IRS.\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFFS' SIXTH AMENDED PETITION                                                                        5\nMacintosh HD:Users:esigmon:Documents:CASES:Rollins-001 :Pleadings: Rollins Sixth Amended Petition .docx\n                                                                                        APPENDIX 19\n                                                                                                              Page 87\n\f20.     TC acted as CM E's agent at all times relevant to the facts made the basis of this\n\nlawsuit. CME is therefore liable for the torts of its agent as alleged and described herein\n\nand above and as recognized by the laws of Texas and the Restatement (2d) of Torts.\n\n21.     Plaintiffs further allege that CME exercises a measure of control over TC so as to\n\nqualify it as CME's \"alter-ego\" functioning as CME's mere tool or business conduit.\n\n22.     CME owed Plaintiffs a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid a foreseeable\n\nrisk of injury to others. CME also owed Plaintiffs a duty to exercise reasonable care in\n\nperforming services, whether gratuitously or for consideration that CME should\n\nrecognize as necessary for the protection of other persons or things.\n\n23.     CME breached its duties by failing to exercise reasonable care to secure Mr.\n\nRollins' safety while employed at TC and in doing so significantly increased his risk of\n\nharm.     This breach makes CME liable to Plaintiffs vicariously and directly.                            The\n\nforegoing acts and omissions by CME constitute negligence and gross negligence.\n\n\nMPF INVESTMENTS, LLC D/B/A \"A-1 RENT ALL\" - NEGLIGENCE, NEGLIGENT\nENTRUSTMENT AND GROSS NEGLIGENCE\n\n24.     MPF owed Plaintiffs a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid a foreseeable\n\nrisk of injury to others as well as a duty to take affirmative action to avoid increasing the\n\ndanger from a condition created by its conduct. Defendant MPF breached its duty of\n\ncare to Plaintiffs. MPF's breach includes and is not limited to its failure to ensure that\n\nthe Lift was being rented and used by competent and authorized persons; and to act\n\nreasonably and prudently in all manners regarding its rental transaction with TC and the\n\nsteps it should have taken to prevent the readily foreseeable harm that the Lift could\n\ncause subsequent users who were either unfit, untrained or incompetent to operate it.\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFFS' SIXTH AMENDED PETITION                                                                          6\nMacintosh HD:Users:esigmon:Documents:CASES:Rollins-001 :Pleadings: Rollins Sixth Amended Petition .docx\n                                                                                        APPENDIX 20\n                                                                                                                Page 88\n\fThe foregoing acts and omissions by MPF constitute negligence, negligent entrustment\n\nand gross negligence.\n\n                                    DAMAGES TO PLAINTIFFS\n\n25.

Garry L. Rollins (hereinafter \"Rollins') is a maintenance worker employed by\n\nTexas College in the capacity of maintenance technician. Texas College itself operates\n\nunder the \"supervision, care and ownership\" of CME and has rented heavy equipment\n\n\"aerial work platforms\" from A-1 on various occasions.\n\n10.     Rollins' formal work title was \"Maintenance Technician\". His office was in the TC\n\nPhysical Plant (the \"Plant\").             Rollins reported to Roland Brackens, the Plant\n\nSuperintendent, and to James Harris, Vice President of Business and Finance at TC.\n\nRollins also supervised a three to four person maintenance crew.                          Rollins' overall\n\nresponsibility at TC included general maintenance, light construction, driving detail and\n\nessentially anything else the school required. He was hired to work at TC in 2008.\n\n11.     During September 2013, Rollins was asked by his supervisor to help move some\n\nmarble counter tops that were to be installed in the school's Science building. The\n\nslabs of marble themselves weighed anywhere from 150-185 pounds. TC asked Mr.\n\nRollins and one other worker to perform the task with no other assistance-man nor\n\nmachine. While moving the slab, Mr. Rollins sneezed/coughed, dropped the object and\n\nsuffered a momentary loss of consciousness. On or around September 9, 2013 Rollins\n\nsought emergency medical care because of the incident and was advised not to drive.\n\nRollins informed agents and employees of TC of his restriction and was subsequently\n\nremoved from a TC driving task that he had been performing on Tuesdays and\n\nThursdays. Upon information and belief, Mr. Brackens or Mr. Harris removed Rollins\n\nfrom the task.\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFFS' SEVENTH AMENDED PETITION                                                                        3\nMacintosh HD:Users:esigmon:Documents:CASES:Rollins-001 :Pleadings: Rollins Seventh Amended Petition .docx\n                                                                                       APPENDIX 26\n                                                                                                                Page 94\n\f12.     A few weeks later, sometime during October 2013, the gymnasium ceiling at TC\n\nneeded repair. TC rented a hydraulic \"scissor lift\" (the \"Lift\") from defendant A-1 for\n\nPlaintiff Rollins and others to use while doing the repairs.\n\n13.     The Lift is capable of reaching upwards of approximately 20 feet from the ground\n\nand is often accompanied by a safety harness to prevent worker injury. TC did not rent\n\nor purchase a harness for use with the Lift, nor did it purchase or rent any other\n\npersonal protective equipment needed to ensure worker safety. Upon information and\n\nbelief, A-1 did not offer or suggest that TC purchase or rent personal protective\n\nequipment for use with the Lift nor did it adequately confirm whether TC or its agents\n\nwere \"qualified personnel\" with the training and experience needed to safely operate the\n\nLift.   Upon information and belief, A-1 did not familiarize Rollins with the Lift and its\n\noperation nor did they offer to train Rollins. Rollins' immediate supervisor, Mr. Brackens\n\ndid not check or confirm whether A-1 Rent All included an owner/operator manual with\n\nthe Lift as required by its manufacturer, JLG.\n\n14.     On or around October 22, 2013 TC directed Rollins and others to use the Lift \"as\n\nis\" to make the repairs-minus training or supervision.                    After completing the work,\n\nRollins fell from the Lift as he was attempting to exit to safety. He immediately reported\n\nthe incident to the TC human resources department as required. At the time, Rollins\n\nassumed his fall had been relatively inconsequential as he was able to walk away\n\nunassisted.\n\n15.     Three days later, on or around October 25, 2013, Rollins lost sensation in his\n\nlegs and toes and was subsequently admitted to Zale Lipshy University Hospital in\n\nDallas Texas where he underwent invasive neck surgery.\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFFS' SEVENTH AMENDED PETITION                                                                        4\nMacintosh HD:Users:esigmon:Documents:CASES:Rollins-001 :Pleadings: Rollins Seventh Amended Petition .docx\n                                                                                       APPENDIX 27\n                                                                                                                Page 95\n\f16.     Rollins is now convalescing at home, unable to walk unassisted and requires\n\nintensive at home physical therapy and care three times a week. He is no longer able\n\nto perform many of the household tasks he once did to assist his wife Carla with the\n\nmaintenance and care of their home.\n\n17.     On or around December 6, 2013 Rollins received correspondence from TC\n\nadvising him that he would be terminated if he does not return to work within 3 months.\n\n                                        CAUSES OF ACTION\n\nTEXAS COLLEGE - NEGLIGENCE AND GROSS NEGLIGENCE\n\n18.     Texas College was Rollins' employer at the time of his avoidable injury and owed\n\nhim a special duty of care at law. Texas College is a non-subscriber to Texas Worker's\n\nCompensation and does not carry any sort of insurance for work related injury.\n\nDefendant Texas College breached its duty of care to Rollins. Its breach includes and\n\nis not limited to Defendant's failure to: 1) provide a reasonably safe workplace; 2)\n\nfurnish reasonably safe machinery or reasonably safe personal protective equipment for\n\nuse with the Lift and for use in lifting the marble slab counter top; 3) provide adequate\n\nhelp in the performance of work; 4) train and/or properly supervise Plaintiff Garry Rollins\n\nwhile using the Lift and lifting the marble slab counter top; and 5) to ensure that Plaintiff\n\nGarry Rollins was fit to perform work on a scissor lift.

CME makes extensive reference to TC throughout its\n\ninternal documentation and by-laws, and the role it plays in establishing TC policies and\n\nprocedures. CME also has a significant \"financial relationship\" with TC that has been\n\nreported to the IRS.\n\n20.     TC acted as CM E's agent at all times relevant to the facts made the basis of this\n\nlawsuit. CME is therefore liable for the torts of its agent as alleged and described herein\n\nand above and as recognized by the laws of Texas and the Restatement (2d) of Torts.\n\n21.     Plaintiffs further allege that CME exercises a measure of control over TC so as to\n\nqualify it as CME's \"alter-ego\" functioning as CME's mere tool or business conduit.\n\nCME has engaged in financial transactions pledging and leveraging Texas College\n\nassets; and controls the school through an elected body of officials composed\n\npredominately of CME officers and bishops acting on behalf of the CME-retaining for\n\nitself the power to merge, consolidate, convey, or terminate Texas College as it deems\n\nfit. The official bylaws of Texas College mandate that upon dissolution, the school's\n\nassets will revert back to CME. The elected body of officials (referenced supra) acts\n\nthrough various \"committees\", one of which established policies and procedures at the\n\nTexas College physical plant where Garry Rollins was employed for several years.\n\nThese policies and procedures impacted employee training and employee safety at\n\nTexas College.\n\n22.     CME owed Plaintiffs a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid a foreseeable\n\nrisk of injury to others. CME also owed Plaintiffs a duty to exercise reasonable care in\n\nperforming services, whether gratuitously or for consideration that CME should\n\nrecognize as necessary for the protection of other persons or things.\n\nPLAINTIFFS' SEVENTH AMENDED PETITION                                                                        6\nMacintosh HD:Users:esigmon:Documents:CASES:Rollins-001 :Pleadings: Rollins Seventh Amended Petition .docx\n                                                                                       APPENDIX 29\n                                                                                                                Page 97\n\f23.     CME breached its duties by failing to exercise reasonable care to secure Mr.\n\nRollins' safety while employed at TC and in doing so significantly increased his risk of\n\nharm.     This breach makes CME liable to Plaintiffs vicariously and directly.                         The\n\nforegoing acts and omissions by CME constitute negligence and gross negligence.\n\n\nMPF INVESTMENTS, LLC D/B/A \"A-1 RENT ALL\" - NEGLIGENCE, NEGLIGENT\nENTRUSTMENT AND GROSS NEGLIGENCE\n\n24.     MPF owed Plaintiffs a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid a foreseeable\n\nrisk of injury to others as well as a duty to take affirmative action to avoid increasing the\n\ndanger from a condition created by its conduct. Defendant MPF breached its duty of\n\ncare to Plaintiffs. MPF's breach includes and is not limited to its failure to ensure that\n\nthe Lift was being rented and used by competent and authorized persons; and to act\n\nreasonably and prudently in all manners regarding its rental transaction with TC and the\n\nsteps it should have taken to prevent the readily foreseeable harm that the Lift could\n\ncause subsequent users who were either unfit, untrained or incompetent to operate it.\n\nThe foregoing acts and omissions by MPF constitute negligence, negligent entrustment\n\nand gross negligence.\n\n                                    DAMAGES TO PLAINTIFFS\n\n25.

As a direct and proximate result of the occurrence made the basis of this lawsuit,\n\nPlaintiff Carla D.

Plaintiffs further allege that Defendants' acts and omissions, whether taken\n\nsingularly or in combination, were aggravated by the kind of malice and reckless\n\ndisregard for which the law allows the imposition of exemplary damages. TC's conduct\n\namounts to gross negligence as defined by the laws of Texas. CME's conduct amounts\n\nto gross negligence as by the laws of Texas. CME is either directly liable for exemplary\n\ndamages because of its conduct or liable because of its agent's acts. MPF's conduct\n\namounts to gross negligence as defined by the laws of Texas. In light of the foregoing,\n\nPlaintiffs seek such exemplary damages against each defendant named herein in an\n\namount that exceeds the minimum jurisdictional threshold of the Court.\n\n\n1\n  Exemplary damages are considered special damages and must be specially pleaded (as they are here in Plaintiffs'\nSeventh Amended Petition).

Garry L. Rollins (hereinafter \"Rollins\") is a maintenance worker employed by\n\nTexas College in the capacity of maintenance technician. Texas College has rented\n\nheavy equipment \"aerial work platforms\" from A-1 on various occasions.\n\n9.      Rollins' formal work title was \"Maintenance Technician\". His office was in the TC\n\nPhysical Plant (the \"Plant\").             Rollins reported to Roland Brackens, the Plant\n\nSuperintendent, and to James Harris, Vice President of Business and Finance at TC.\n\nPLAINTIFFS' EIGHTH AMENDED PETITION                                                                       2\nMacintosh HD:Users:esigmon:Documents:CASES:Rollins-001 :Pleadings:Rollins Eighth Amended Petition .docx\n                                                                                       APPENDIX 35\n                                                                                                              Page 499\n\fRollins also supervised a three to four person maintenance crew.                         Rollins' overall\n\nresponsibility at TC included general maintenance, light construction, driving detail and\n\nessentially anything else the school required. He was hired to work at TC in 2008.\n\n10.     During September 2013, Rollins was asked by his supervisor to help move some\n\nmarble counter tops that were to be installed in the school's Science building. The\n\nslabs of marble themselves weighed anywhere from 150-185 pounds. TC asked Mr.\n\nRollins and one other worker to perform the task with no other assistance-man nor\n\nmachine. VVhile moving the slab, Mr. Rollins sneezed/coughed, dropped the object and\n\nsuffered a momentary loss of consciousness. On or around September 9, 2013 Rollins\n\nsought emergency medical care because of the incident and was advised not to drive.\n\nRollins informed agents and employees of TC of his restriction and was subsequently\n\nremoved from a TC driving task that he had been performing on Tuesdays and\n\nThursdays. Upon information and belief, Mr. Brackens or Mr. Harris removed Rollins\n\nfrom the task.\n\n11.     A few weeks later, sometime during October 2013, the gymnasium ceiling at TC\n\nneeded repair. TC rented a hydraulic \"scissor lift\" (the \"Lift') from defendant A-1 for\n\nPlaintiff Rollins and others to use while doing the repairs.\n\n12.     The Lift is capable of reaching upwards of approximately 20 feet from the ground\n\nand is often accompanied by a safety harness to prevent worker injury. TC did not rent\n\nor purchase a harness for use with the Lift, nor did it purchase or rent any other\n\npersonal protective equipment needed to ensure worker safety. A-1 did not offer or\n\nsuggest that TC purchase or rent personal protective equipment for use with the Lift nor\n\ndid it adequately confirm whether TC or its agents were \"qualified personnel\" with the\n\ntraining and experience needed to safely operate the Lift. A-1 did not familiarize Rollins\n\nPLAINTIFFS' EIGHTH AMENDED PETITION                                                                       3\nMacintosh HD:Users:esigmon:Documents:CASES:Rollins-001 :Pleadings:Rollins Eighth Amended Petition .docx\n                                                                                       APPENDIX 36\n                                                                                                              Page 500\n\fwith the Lift and its operation nor did it offer to train Rollins. A-1 Rent All did not include\n\nan owner/operator manual with the Lift as required by the manufacturer, JLG.\n\n13.     On or around October 22, 2013 TC directed Rollins and others to use the Lift \"as\n\nis\" to make the repairs-minus training or supervision.                    After completing the work,\n\nRollins fell from the Lift as he was attempting to exit to safety. He immediately reported\n\nthe incident to the TC human resources department as required. TC did not formally\n\ninvestigate the incident nor did it report Mr. Rollins' workplace fall to OSHA.                     At the\n\ntime, Rollins assumed his fall had been relatively inconsequential as he was able to\n\nwalk away unassisted.\n\n14.     Three days later, on or around October 25, 2013, Rollins lost sensation in his\n\nlegs and toes and was subsequently admitted to Zale Lipshy University Hospital in\n\nDallas Texas where he underwent invasive neck surgery.\n\n15.     Rollins is now convalescing at home, unable to walk unassisted and requires\n\nintensive at home physical therapy and care three times a week. He is no longer able\n\nto perform many of the household tasks he once did to assist his wife Carla with the\n\nmaintenance and care of their home.\n\n16.     On or around December 6, 2013 Rollins received correspondence from TC\n\nadvising him that he would be terminated if he does not return to work within 3 months.\n\n                                        CAUSES OF ACTION\n\nTEXAS COLLEGE - NEGLIGENCE AND GROSS NEGLIGENCE\n\n17.

The foregoing acts and omissions\n\nby TC are violations of the Texas Labor Code (Chapter 411 et. seq.), the common laws\n\nof Texas, and various other rules and regulations pertaining to worker safety.

MPF owed Plaintiffs a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid a foreseeable\n\nrisk of injury to others as well as a duty to take affirmative action to avoid increasing the\n\ndanger from a condition created by its conduct. Defendant MPF breached its duty of\n\ncare to Plaintiffs. MPF's breach includes and is not limited to its failure to: 1) ensure that\n\nthe Lift was being rented and used by competent and authorized persons; 2) deliver the\n\nLift in \"fit for service\" condition prior to use; 3) offer training or familiarization with the\n\nLift; and 4) to act as a reasonable and prudent renter of heavy machinery under the\n\ncircumstances in all manners pertaining to the transaction with TC and the steps it\n\nshould have taken to prevent the readily foreseeable harm that could result from unfit,\n\nuntrained or incompetent operators using the Lift.

Over the course of\n\n     the next several weeks in September and into October, Mr. Brackens began having me perform\n\n     maintenance and repair jobs that were at times degrading and a little frightening. For example, on one\n\n     occasion he insisted that I crawl underneath several buildings on campus to take photographs of the\n\n     different buildings' foundation.

This kind of thing made me and otheremployees question the school'sattitude toward our\n\n     safety.\n\n\n4.   During October 2013, Mr. Brackens assigned me and my crew the job of fIXing the gym ceiling in\n\n     preparation for the Texas College homecoming celebration. Texas College rented a scissor lift from\n\n     ClA_l R.ent All\" in Tyler, Texas for us to do the work at about 19-20 feet in the air. Dr. Fennell wanted\n\n     the ceiling repaired and wanted it done immediately. Over the course of my professional career, I\n\n     havedone work on roofs and at heights but I havenever operated a scissor lift (which is different from\n\n     say a \"boom\" lift) and J have become leery of heights in my olderage for fear of falling. I explained\n\n     to Mr. Brackens that I did not know how to operate a scissor lift and that I was afraid of the height.\n\n     Later that day, Mr. Harris called me to his office along with Ms. Bowie and infonned me that Mr.\n\n     Brackens had complained that I was an ongoing discipline problem and that J didn't want to do as told,\n\n     Mr. Harris infonned me that In orderto keep myjob I needed to get the ceiling fixed as directed.\n\nS.   I was present outside the gym when A·I Rent All delivered the scissor lift to Texas College. I asked\n\n     the delivery person If A·[ would brini the lift inside the gym and who was going to show us how to\n\n     use It. The A·I person informed me that he couldn't bring the lift indoors and thlt the folks at Texas\n\n     Collcae knew how to use the lift. A-I did not offer WI training nor did it familiarize us with the lift.\n\n     The person from A·I just came and delivered the machine and left.\n\n\n6.   I began doing the gym ceiling work with Michael Johnson on October 21,2013 as directed by Mr.\n\n     Bra<:kens and Mr. Harris.

When Mr. Johnson arrived I lowered the\n\n      lift and brought him up. While in the air, Michael Johnson told me I didn't look good. He also\n\n     testified to this fact in his deposition.    r was present at his deposition.          He was correct: I didn't feel\n\n     right being that high up. Michael suggested that we come down and that I set otTthe lift. Once he\n\n     brought the lift down, I went to exit and fell from the top of the platform flat on my back ontothe gym\n\n     floor. The top of the lift platform is still a good three feet off the ground when its all the way down,\n\n     and I fell straightback with nothing breaking the fall. I don't remember taking the first step down. )\n\n     wasn't wearing any safety harness and had not been given a hard hat.

SIGMON): And if you look at - if you Pg. 17\nlook at subsection (a) of [OSHA] Section\n 1926.454, it states that, \"The employer shall\nhave each employee who performs work while\non a scissor lift trained by a person qualified in\nthe subject matter to recognize the hazards\nassociated with the type of set - of scissor lift\nbeing used and to understand the procedures to\ncontrol or minimize those hazards.\" And you've\njust testified that that did not take place,\ncorrect?\n\n A. Correct.\n Q. So the rules that we just spoke about, Pg. 17\n specifically those OSHA examples, those are\n safety rules, right?\n\n A. Correct.\n Q. But my question to you, Mr. Brackens, is, Pg. 18\n you just testified that OSHA section 1926.454\n was not followed. It was violated. That rule\n was broken. No training was given by a\n competent person to these employees at Texas\n College on how to operate a scissor lift.\n A. Okay.\n\n Q. Correct?\n A. Yes, I correct - yes, I did say that.\n\n        Mr. Brackens was not qualified by Plaintiffs to testify as an expert on specific OSHA\n\nrules or regulations or make any conclusory opinions on same, and made it clear through his\n\ntestimony that he is not an expert on same. Brackens dep. 18:8-14. While he may be familiar\n\ngenerally with OSHA, Plaintiffs have attempted to obtain definitive legal conclusions from\n\nBrackens and elicit from him opinion testimony on specific standards. While he has been shown\n\nto be knowledgeable and experienced on the mounting, dismounting, and the operation of scissor\n\nand boom lifts and other matters addressed in his deposition, OSHA standards and their\n\napplication to specific workplace items are not among those matters.

The JLG Owner's Manual Model 1930-ES\n\n        Texas College objects to Plaintiffs' attempted use of a purported JLG Owner's Manual\n\non the basis that Plaintiffs have failed to establish its authenticity or relevance, or lay any proper\n\npredicate for the admissibility of same, either through a qualified witness or otherwise. The\n\npurported manual is inadmissible hearsay and not competent as summary-judgment proof. No\n\nexception to the hearsay rules apply to the subject manual filed as an independent document with\n\nthe Court. Since Plaintiffs are attempting to offer statements within the JLG Owner's Manual to\n\nprove the matter asserted, the JLG Owner's Manual itself, and the statements referenced within\n\nit, are inadmissible hearsay.\n\n        Texas College's objections to the JLG Owner's Manual should be sustained, any\n\nreference to the JLG Owner's Manual should stricken, and the JLG Owner's Manual and any\n\nreference to it should be disregarded by the Court. The references within Plaintiffs' response\n\nthat Texas College requests to be stricken are listed below.\n\n                                                                        p\n                                                        Page 16\n\n Use extreme caution when entering or leaving\n platform. Ensure that the scissor arm assembly\n is fully lowered. Face the machine when\n entering or leaving the platform. Always\n maintain \"three point contact\" with the machine\n using two hands and one foot or two feet and\n one hand at all times during entry and exit.\n JLG, the manufacturer of the subject lift, also Page 18\n requires that lift operators be trained.\n\n\n\nDEFE:'iDA:'iT TEXAS COLLEGE'S OBJECTIO:'iS/MOTIO:'i TO STRIKE\nEVIDE:'iCE A'.\\ll REFERE:'iCES I:'i PLAI:'iTIFFS' RESPO:'iSE TO TEXAS\nCOLLEGE'S MOTIO:'i FOR St:MMARY Jt:DGME:'iT                                              PAGE4OF19\n                                                                                  APPENDIX 67\n                                                                                                         Page 3669\n\f There is developed evidence (affinned by Page 18\n common sense, and discussed supra) that a\n scissor lift is a piece of machinery that requires\n extreme caution because of its potential dangers\n and hazards.\n The undisputed evidence is that a person in Mr. Page 20\n Rollins condition should not have been\n operating this type of machinery and that it is\n incumbent on the employer to recognize these\n potential hazards\n The undisputed evidence is that a person in Mr. Page 22\n Rollins condition should not have been on or\n ooerating this type of machinery\n\nIV.

Set forth below are those portions of Rollins' affidavit\n\nand the corresponding references within Plaintiffs' response the College respectfully submits\n\nshould be stricken, and the supporting grounds.           However, the affidavit is so replete with\n\ninadmissible hearsay, irrelevant testimony, and sworn statements that fundamentally contradict\n\nRollins' earlier sworn deposition testimony (making it a \"Sham Affidavit\"), the College\n\nrespectfully requests in the alternative that it be stricken in its entirety.\n\n        A summary judgment affidavit must affinnatively establish the basis for affiant's\n\npersonal knowledge of the infonnation in the affidavit.
