          "plain_text": "In the\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFor the Seventh Circuit\n\nNo. 00-4145\n\nGLEN DELANEY,\n\nPlaintiff-Appellee,\n\nv.\n\nGEORGE DeTELLA, GLENN MALONE,\nCHRISTOPHER HUGHES, EUGENE McADORY,\nCLARENCE WRIGHT, DONALD BURNS, and\nDAVID WALKER,\n\nDefendants-Appellants.\n\nAppeal from the United States District Court\nfor the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division.\nNo. 98 C 4476--David H. Coar, Judge.\n\nArgued June 4, 2001--Decided July 9, 2001\n\n\n  Before RIPPLE, EVANS, and WILLIAMS, Circuit\nJudges.\n\n  EVANS, Circuit Judge. Glen Delaney, an\ninmate at Stateville Correctional Center\nin Illinois, filed this suit under 42\nU.S.C. sec. 1983 alleging an Eighth\nAmendment violation for being denied all\nout-of-cell exercise opportunities for 6\nmonths. The defendants, six guards and\nthe prison warden, filed a motion for\nsummary judgment asserting a qualified\nimmunity defense. District Judge David H.\nCoar denied the motion and the defendants\nappeal.\n\n  In January 1995, Delaney was placed in\nStateville’s segregation unit. While in\nsegregation, he was allowed 5 hours of\nout-of-cell exercise time (yard\nprivileges) per week as called for by a\nprison regulation./1\n\n  In the spring of 1996, Stateville\ninstituted a \"lockdown\" for the purpose\nof reviewing security measures,\nconducting a \"shakedown\" of inmates, and\nredesigning prisoner cells. The lockdown\ncontinued for just over 6 months, and\nduring this time Delaney was denied all\nout-of-cell exercise. His movements were\nrestricted to a once a week shower, three\nfamily visits (one in April, one in May,\n\fand one in June), and two brief trips to\nthe prison’s medical unit. During these\nexcursions he was shackled and chained to\nthe inmate in front and behind him. A\ntrip to either the medical unit or the\nvisitation center took around 10 minutes.\n\n  The segregation cells are small and\ncramped, measuring only about 122 inches\nby 43 to 56 inches. During the 6-month\nlockdown, Delaney says he repeatedly\nspoke with the correctional officer\ndefendants (McAdory, Malone, Hughes,\nWalker, Burns, and Wright) about getting\nyard privileges so he could exercise. He\nalso filed a grievance with Warden George\nDeTella. However, no out-of-cell exercise\nopportunities were offered to Delaney or,\nfor that matter, to any other segregated\ninmates during the long lockdown.\n\n  As a result of being denied an\nopportunity to exercise for over 6\nmonths, Delaney contends he suffered from\nmigraines, heartburn, stomach cramps,\nneck pains, constipation, lethargy, and\ndepression. Although he received some\nmedication for his ailments, he requested\nmedical attention from more senior\npersonnel and filed grievances against\nseveral prison medical technicians.\n\n  Before Judge Coar, the defendants argued\nthat penological interests justified the\n6-month denial of exercise privileges and\nthat guards (but not Warden DeTella) were\nnot personally involved in the lockdown\ndecision. On appeal, the defendants shift\ntheir focus, arguing primarily that\nDelaney did not suffer a serious injury\nand that even if he did, they were not\ntold of the severity of his complaint.\n\n  We have jurisdiction over an\ninterlocutory appeal from a denial of\nqualified immunity only when no factual\nissues need be resolved. Behrens v.\nPelletier, 516 U.S. 299, 308 (1996);\nLevenstein v. Salafsky, 164 F.3d 345, 346\n(7th Cir. 1998). We must review the\ndistrict court’s denial of qualified\nimmunity de novo, considering all\nundisputed facts in the light most\nfavorable to Delaney. Khuans v. School\nDist. 110, 123 F.3d 1010, 1013 (7th Cir.\n1997).\n\n  In reviewing the affirmative defense of\nqualified immunity, we apply a two-step\napproach. As a threshold issue, we\n\fdetermine if Delaney has asserted a\nviolation of a constitutional right.\nCounty of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S.\n833, 841 n. 5 (1998); Kitzman-Kelley v.\nWarner, 203 F.3d 454, 457 (7th Cir.\n2000). We next consider whether the right\nwas clearly established at the time the\nalleged violation occurred. Wilson v.\nLayne, 526 U.S. 603, 609, 119 S. Ct.\n1692, 1697 (1999). Thus, the judge-made\nqualified immunity doctrine serves to\nprotect government officials from\ninsubstantial suits based on\nunforeseeable changes in the law. See\nCrawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574, 590\n(1998).\n\n  Whether the first prong of a qualified\nimmunity defense, as outlined by the\nCourt in Lewis, is a mandatory step or\nmerely a recommendation remains, to some\nextent, a bit of an open question. See\nHudson v. Hall, 231 F.3d 1289, 1296 f.5\n(11th Cir. 2000); Kalka v. Hawk, 215 F.3d\n90 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Horne v. Coughlin,\n191 F.3d 244 (2nd Cir. 1999). However, in\nrecent cases where the Supreme Court\nconsidered qualified immunity defenses on\nsummary judgment, Saucier v. Katz, 2001\nWL 672265, ___ S. Ct. ___ (June 18,\n2001), Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, and\nConn v. Gabbert, 526 U.S. 286, 119 S. Ct.\n1292 (1999), it first addressed if a\nconstitutional violation was asserted\nbefore moving on to the question of\nwhether it was \"clearly established\" at\nthe time of the alleged violation.\n\n  These cases, however, require only that\na plaintiff allege a constitutional\ndeprivation; thus we are required to\ndetermine only whether Delaney’s\nallegations, if true, state a claim of\ndeprivation. Wilson, 526 U.S. at 609;\nConn, 526 U.S. at 290; see also Siegert\nv. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226, 232 (1991)\n(prior to deciding if right is \"clearly\nestablished,\" must determine if\nconstitutional claim is asserted at all\nand this determination is \"purely\nlegal\").\n\n  An Eighth Amendment claim has two\ncomponents-- objective and subjective. To\nsatisfy the objective component, \"the\ndeprivation alleged must be, objectively,\n’sufficiently serious.’\" Henderson v.\nSheahan, 196 F.3d 839, 845 (7th Cir.\n1999) (citing Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S.\n825, 834 (1994)). \"Therefore, ’extreme\n\fdeprivations are required to make out a\nconditions-of-confinement claim.’\" Id.\n(quoting Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1,\n9 (1992)).\n\n  The subjective component relates to a\ndefendant’s state of mind and requires a\nshowing of deliberate indifference. At a\nminimum in a case like this, an inmate\nmust allege \"actual knowledge of\nimpending harm easily preventable.\" Jack\nson v. Duckworth, 955 F.2d 21, 22 (7th\nCir. 1992) (quoting Duckworth v. Franzen,\n780 F.2d 645, 653 (7th Cir. 1985)). \"A\nfailure of prison officials to act in\nsuch circumstances suggests that the\nofficials actually want the prisoner to\nsuffer the harm.\" Id.\n\n  Delaney contends that to deny a\nsegregated inmate all out-of-cell\nexercise opportunities for 6 months\nconstitutes an objectively serious\ndeprivation of a basic human need. In\ndetermining whether an act or omission\nconstitutes cruel and unusual punishment,\nthe Eighth Amendment provides little\nguidance. Thus, courts have added\nsubstance to its meager admonishment by\nconsulting the \"evolving standards of\ndecency that mark the progress of a\nmaturing society.\" Rhodes v. Chapman, 452\nU.S. 337, 346 (1981). Thus, conditions\nwhich may have been acceptable long ago\nmay be considered unnecessarily cruel in\nlight of our growing understanding of\nhuman needs and the changing norms of our\nsociety. Davenport v. DeRobertis, 844\nF.2d 1310, 1315 (1988) (\"The conditions\nin which prisoners are housed, like the\npoverty line, is a function of a\nsociety’s standard of living. As that\nstandard rises, the standard of minimum\ndecency of prison conditions, like the\npoverty line, rises too.\"). While the\nConstitution does not require that\nprisons be comfortable, prison conditions\ndo violate the Constitution where they\n\"deprive inmates of the minimal civilized\nmeasure of life’s necessities.\" Rhodes,\n452 U.S. at 347. Therefore, we consider\nwhether a complete denial of reasonable\nexercise opportunities for 6 months falls\nbelow contemporary standards.\n\n  In recent years we have not only\nacknowledged that a lack of exercise can\nrise to a constitutional violation,\nFrench v. Owen, 777 F.2d 1250, 1255 (7th\nCir. 1986), but have concluded that\n\f\"exercise is now regarded in many\nquarters as an indispensable component of\npreventive medicine.\" Anderson v. Romero,\n72 F.3d 518, 528 (7th Cir. 1995). Given\ncurrent norms, exercise is no longer\nconsidered an optional form of\nrecreation, but is instead a necessary\nrequirement for physical and mental well-\nbeing.\n\n  Although we have recognized the value of\nexercise and its medicinal effects, we\nhave also consistently held that short-\nterm denials of exercise may be\ninevitable in the prison context and are\nnot so detrimental as to constitute a\nconstitutional deprivation. Thomas v.\nRamos, 130 F.3d 754, 764 (7th Cir. 1997)\n(70-day denial permissible); Harris v.\nFleming, 839 F.2d 1232, 1236 (7th Cir.\n1988) (28-day denial not deprivation);\nShelby County Jail Inmates v. Westlake,\n798 F.2d 1085, 1089 (7th Cir. 1986)\n(limited recreational activities\nsufficient, where average prison stay was\n10 days or less); Caldwell v. Miller, 790\nF.2d 589, 601 (7th Cir. 1986) (no\ndeprivation where exercise was denied for\n30 days, but then allowed one hour indoor\nexercise for next 6 months); but see\nAntonelli v. Sheahan, 81 F.3d 1422, 1432\n(7th Cir. 1996) (viable constitutional\nclaim where prisoner denied recreational\nopportunities for 7 weeks); Jamison-Bey\nv. Thieret, 867 F.2d 1046, 1048 (1989)\n(reversing summary judgment for prison\nofficials where segregated prisoner\ndenied exercise for 101 days).\n\n  Here, both in duration and severity, the\nnature of Delaney’s alleged deprivation\nwas significant and serious, and\napparently no alternatives were made\navailable to mitigate the effects of the\ndeprivation. We recently noted that\nsegregation is akin to solitary\nconfinement and that such confinement,\nuninterrupted by opportunities for out-\nof-cell exercise \"could reasonably be\ndescribed as cruel and, by reference to\nthe current norms of American prisons,\nunusual.\" Pearson v. Ramos, 237 F.3d 881,\n884 (7th Cir. 2001). Except for limited\ncalisthenics inside his small cell, the\ndefendants do not argue that Delaney had\nany other recreational alternatives or\naccess to common areas which may have\nmitigated the severity of a 6-month\ndenial of yard privileges. See Harris,\n839 F.2d at 1236 (no serious deprivation\n\fwhere segregated inmate retained ability\nto move freely through unit and could\nimprovise exercise regimen); Shelby, 798\nF.2d at 1089 (no violation where\nprisoners had access to common area\nexercise bikes). Here, for 6 months,\nDelaney remained in a cell the size of a\nphone booth without any meaningful chance\nto exercise.\n\n  Nor can the defendants argue that the 6-\nmonth denial was brought on by Delaney’s\nmisconduct or propensity to escape. See\nPearson, 237 F.3d at 885 (four\nconsecutive, 90-day denials of out-of-\ncell exercise privileges for serious\nviolations of prison disciplinary rules\nnot cruel and unusual punishment);\nLeMaire v. Maass, 12 F.3d 1444, 1457-58\n(9th Cir. 1993) (no Eighth Amendment\nviolation where prisoner denied out-of-\ncell exercise for 5 years because inmate\nposed constant threat of attack); Martin\nv. Tyson, 845 F.2d 1451, 1456 (7th Cir.\n1988) (no constitutional violation for 4-\nmonth denial of exercise where prisoner\nposed escape risk). Rather, the parties\nagree that Delaney was not a fractious\ninmate and his yard privileges, prior to\nthe lockdown, were never withheld for\ndisciplinary purposes.\n\n  While there may in certain cases be\nlegitimate penological reasons justifying\nan extended denial of exercise\nprivileges, here none are presented.\nCiting the lockdown, the defendants\nmerely say, in conclusory fashion, that\nallowing inmates yard time for exercise\nwould pose a \"potential security threat.\"\nThis unsupported statement is\ninsufficient. Given the length of this\nexercise restriction, the state\ndefendants should have, but didn’t,\nadvance any legitimate penological need\nfor denying all forms of outside\nexercise.\n\n  The defendants also argue that the\ndenial of all exercise opportunities was\nnot an objectively serious deprivation\nbecause Delaney didn’t provide expert\ntestimony showing that his physical\nhealth was threatened by the denial. But\nas we have noted, on a motion for\nqualified immunity we consider whether\nplaintiff’s allegations, if true, state\na claim of deprivation. Wilson, 526 U.S.\n603, 609. To decide if qualified immunity\nshould be granted we ask only, if viewed\n\fin the light most favorable to Delaney,\nwas a deprivation alleged? Thus, we\nconsider whether it was possible that\nserious injuries were sustained, not\nwhether it was probable. See Antonelli,\n81 F.3d 1422, 1432 (viable Eighth\nAmendment claim for denial of exercise\nwhere inmate alleged \"health and physical\nwell being have deteriorated\").\n\n  Moreover, while we have not waived the\ninjury requirement for claims involving\nthe denial of exercise, but see Lopez v.\nSmith, 203 F.3d 1122, 1133 f.15 (9th Cir.\n2000) (where inmate alleges long-term\ndenial of exercise--in excess of 6 weeks-\n-no showing of adverse medical effects\nrequired), we have acknowledged the\nstrong likelihood of psychological injury\nwhen segregated prisoners are denied all\naccess to exercise for more than 90 days.\nDavenport v. DeRobertis, 844 F.2d 1310,\n1313 (\"[T]he record shows, what anyway\nseems pretty obvious, that isolating a\nhuman being from other human beings year\nafter year or even month after month can\ncause substantial psychological damage .\n. . .\"). We have also noted, in\nconditions-of-confinement cases, that\nthere may be some interplay between the\nseverity of the deprivation alleged and\nthe required showing of injury. Dixon v.\nGodinez, 114 F.3d 640, 643 (given\nseverity and duration of prison\ncondition,\"[c]old temperatures need not\nimminently threaten inmates’ health to\nviolate the Eighth Amendment\"); Del Raine\nv. Williford, 32 F.3d 1024, 1035 (7th\nCir. 1994) (need not allege frostbite or\nhypothermia to establish that cold\ntemperatures endangered inmate’s health).\n\n  The defendants also are wrong in\nconcluding that only a showing of\nphysical injury can satisfy an Eighth\nAmendment claim. See Hudson, 503 U.S. 1,\n16 (Blackmun, J., concurring) (\"It is not\nhard to imagine inflictions of\npsychologial harm--without corresponding\nphysical harm--that might prove to be\ncruel and unusual punishment.\"). Here,\nDelaney alleges both physical and mental\ninjuries including migraines, heartburn,\nstomach cramps, neck pains, constipation,\nlethargy, and depression. It is possible\nthat his mental injuries, along with the\nattendant physical symptoms, were\nsufficiently severe. He was given\nmedications and taken to the health unit\ntwice, and he repeatedly requested\n\fadditional treatment. Thus, Delaney has\nalleged an injury from an objectively\nserious deprivation.\n\n  We now turn to the subjective prong of\nthis claim, the element of deliberate\nindifference. Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S.\n294, 303 (1991). \"[A]n Eighth Amendment\nclaimant need not show that a prison\nofficial acted or failed to act believing\nthat harm actually would befall an\ninmate; it is enough that the official\nacted or failed to act despite his\nknowledge of a substantial risk of\nserious harm.\" Farmer v. Brennan, 511\nU.S. 825, 842 (1994). Moreover, in\ndetermining whether prison officials had\nknowledge of the potential harm, we\nconsider whether \"the circumstances\nsuggest that the defendant-official being\nsued had been exposed to information\nconcerning the risk and thus ’must have\nknown’ about it . . . .\" Id.\n\n  Delaney argues that these defendants\nwere subjectively aware that denying\nprisoners access to all out-of-cell exer\ncise for more than 90 days posed a\nsubstantial risk of serious harm. In 1988\nwe upheld an injunction requiring prison\nofficials (at Stateville) to provide 5\nhours of exercise per week to prisoners\nin segregation for more than 90 days.\nDavenport, 844 F.2d 1310, 1314. We noted\nthat at trial the medical director of the\nIllinois Department of Corrections\ntestified to the \"serious adverse effects\non the physical and mental health\" of\nsegregated inmates who were denied access\nto exercise. Id. at 1313. The risk\nidentified in Davenport was acknowledged\nin the institutional directive requiring\n5 hours of exercise per week for\nsegregated inmates.\n\n  Also, the defendants argue that they\nwere unaware that the denial of exercise\nposed a significant risk to Delaney.\nHowever, it is enough that Delaney\nalleges that they acted with deliberate\nindifference towards all members of a\nclass of which he is a part, rather than\nhaving to allege that they acted with\nparticularized malice towards him. See\nCrawford-El, 523 U.S. 574, 592 (\"When\nintent is an element of a constitutional\nviolation . . . the primary focus is not\non any possible animus directed at the\nplaintiff; rather, it is more specific,\nsuch as an intent to disadvantage all\n\fmembers of a class that includes the\nplaintiff . . . .\"). Deliberate indiffer\nence is akin to criminal recklessness;\nthus, it is enough that defendants are\naware that their action may cause injury\nwithout being able to divine the most\nlikely victim. Farmer, 511 U.S. at 843\n(\"Nor may a prison official escape\nliability for deliberate indifference by\nshowing that, while he was aware of an\nobvious, substantial risk to inmate\nsafety, he did not know that the\ncomplainant was especially likely to be\nassaulted by the specific prisoner . . .\n.\").\n\n  Here, Delaney alleges that he repeatedly\ncomplained to each of the named\ndefendants, filed a grievance, and\nrequested medical attention frequently\nbecause he could not exercise outside his\ncell. In spite of these repeated requests\nand their knowledge of the potential\nrisk, Delaney claims the defendants did\nnothing. This inaction satisfies the sub\njective element of an Eighth Amendment\nclaim. See Jackson, 955 F.2d 21, 22\n(inmate’s allegation that prison officers\nknew of unconstitutional conditions but\ndid nothing was sufficient to show\n\"deliberate indifference\").\n\n  Having found that Delaney has alleged a\nconstitutional violation, we consider\nwhether the right he asserts was clearly\nestablished prior to the spring of 1996.\n\"’[C]learly established’ for purposes of\nqualified immunity means that ’[t]he\ncontours of the right must be\nsufficiently clear that a reasonable\nofficial would understand that what he is\ndoing violates that right.’\" Wilson v.\nLayne, 526 U.S. 603, 614-15 (quoting\nAnderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640\n(1987)); Lanigan v. Village of East Hazel\nCrest, 110 F.3d 467, 472 (7th Cir. 1997).\n\"[T]he inquiry focuses on the objective\nlegal reasonableness of the action, not\nthe state of mind or good faith of the\nofficials in question.\" Levenstein v.\nSalafsky, 164 F.3d 345, 350 (7th Cir.\n1998) (quoting Erwin v. Daley, 92 F.3d\n521, 525 (7th Cir. 1996)).\n\n  While the right must be defined at the\nappropriate level of specificity, it is\nnot to say \"that an official action is\nprotected by qualified immunity unless\nthe very action in question has\npreviously been held unlawful . . . .\"\n\fWilson, 526 U.S. at 615. Rather, it is\nenough if, based on the pre-existing law,\nthe unlawfulness of the conduct is\napparent. Id.\n\n  As early as 1986--10 years before this\nlockdown was instituted--we held that a\nlack of exercise could rise to a\nconstitutional violation. French, 777\nF.2d 1250, 1255. Then in 1988 we decided\nDavenport v. DeRobertis, 844 F.2d 1310,\narising from this same segregation unit.\nWe upheld the district court’s injunction\nrequiring Stateville officials to provide\nsegregated inmates \"with at least five\nhours of exercise time per week in order\nto comply with the Eighth Amendment.\" Id.\nat 1315. We based our decision in part on\nthe impressive number of cases from our\nsister circuits which held that failure\nto provide inmates with the opportunity\nfor at least 5 hours of exercise a week\noutside the cell raised serious\nconstitutional questions. Id. A year\nbefore this lockdown was instituted, we\nagain noted that \"[t]o deny a prisoner\nall opportunity for exercise outside his\ncell would, the cases suggest, violate\nthe Eighth Amendment unless the prisoner\nposed an acute security risk if allowed\nout of his cell for even a short time.\"\nAnderson v. Romero, 72 F.3d 518, 527 (7th\nCir. 1995). Thus, years before the\nlockdown at issue here was instituted,\nthe case law clearly established that\nextended denials of exercise privileges\nraised constitutional concerns./2 In\nlight of Davenport and Anderson, it was\nobjectively unreasonable for prison offi\ncials to institute a complete 6-month\ndenial of all out-of-cell exercise\nprivileges for segregated prisoners.\n\n  Finally, we note that it may very well\nbe that the defendant guards have no\nliability here because they did not\nestablish the lockdown. If they had no\ndiscretion, then it would appear that\nonly Warden DeTella is a proper\ndefendant. But we can’t say that now on\nthis record, for the defendants have made\nno effort to, for instance, outline the\nchain of command--with responsibilities--\nassigned to each. On this record, Judge\nCoar was right to deny the qualified\nimmunity plea of all defendants. While\nall of these defendants may have other\ndefenses available to them, at this stage\nof the case the order denying them an\nearly exit on qualified immunity grounds\n\fis AFFIRMED and the case REMANDED for\nfurther proceedings.\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\n/1 The Stateville Institutional Directive\n05.04.000K3 at II.C.9 provides:\n\nInmates who have been housed in segregation less\nthan 90 days will be afforded a minimum of one\nhour of recreational activity outside their cells\nper week. Recreational activity will be noted in\na log. Five hours of recreational yard time shall\nbe available to all inmates who have served a\nminimum of 90 days in segregation status in\ncompliance with the Davenport Consent Decree.\n\n/2 To support its argument that the pre-1996 case\nlaw on the denial of exercise was unclear, the\ndefendants cite two cases outside this circuit.\nStrickler v. Waters, 989 F.2d 1375, 1380 (4th\nCir. 1993) (6 months without outdoor exercise did\nnot constitute a constitutional violation where\ninmates had access to day room for indoor exer-\ncise during waking hours), and Wishon v. Gammon,\n978 F.2d 446, 449 (8th Cir. 1992) (limiting out-\nof-cell exercise to 45 minutes once a week did\nnot violate the Eighth Amendment rights where\ninmate was confined to protective custody for his\nown safety). Both cases are easily distinguish-\nable. Neither case involved a complete denial of\nall out-of-cell exercise or recreational options.\n\f",

Glen Delaney, an\ninmate at Stateville Correctional Center\nin Illinois, filed this suit under 42\nU.S.C. sec. 1983 alleging an Eighth\nAmendment violation for being denied all\nout-of-cell exercise opportunities for 6\nmonths. The defendants, six guards and\nthe prison warden, filed a motion for\nsummary judgment asserting a qualified\nimmunity defense. District Judge David H.\nCoar denied the motion and the defendants\nappeal.\n\n  In January 1995, Delaney was placed in\nStateville’s segregation unit. While in\nsegregation, he was allowed 5 hours of\nout-of-cell exercise time (yard\nprivileges) per week as called for by a\nprison regulation./1\n\n  In the spring of 1996, Stateville\ninstituted a \"lockdown\" for the purpose\nof reviewing security measures,\nconducting a \"shakedown\" of inmates, and\nredesigning prisoner cells. The lockdown\ncontinued for just over 6 months, and\nduring this time Delaney was denied all\nout-of-cell exercise. His movements were\nrestricted to a once a week shower, three\nfamily visits (one in April, one in May,\n\fand one in June), and two brief trips to\nthe prison’s medical unit. During these\nexcursions he was shackled and chained to\nthe inmate in front and behind him. A\ntrip to either the medical unit or the\nvisitation center took around 10 minutes.\n\n  The segregation cells are small and\ncramped, measuring only about 122 inches\nby 43 to 56 inches. During the 6-month\nlockdown, Delaney says he repeatedly\nspoke with the correctional officer\ndefendants (McAdory, Malone, Hughes,\nWalker, Burns, and Wright) about getting\nyard privileges so he could exercise. He\nalso filed a grievance with Warden George\nDeTella. However, no out-of-cell exercise\nopportunities were offered to Delaney or,\nfor that matter, to any other segregated\ninmates during the long lockdown.\n\n  As a result of being denied an\nopportunity to exercise for over 6\nmonths, Delaney contends he suffered from\nmigraines, heartburn, stomach cramps,\nneck pains, constipation, lethargy, and\ndepression. Although he received some\nmedication for his ailments, he requested\nmedical attention from more senior\npersonnel and filed grievances against\nseveral prison medical technicians.\n\n  Before Judge Coar, the defendants argued\nthat penological interests justified the\n6-month denial of exercise privileges and\nthat guards (but not Warden DeTella) were\nnot personally involved in the lockdown\ndecision. On appeal, the defendants shift\ntheir focus, arguing primarily that\nDelaney did not suffer a serious injury\nand that even if he did, they were not\ntold of the severity of his complaint.\n\n  We have jurisdiction over an\ninterlocutory appeal from a denial of\nqualified immunity only when no factual\nissues need be resolved.

In\ndetermining whether an act or omission\nconstitutes cruel and unusual punishment,\nthe Eighth Amendment provides little\nguidance.

It is possible\nthat his mental injuries, along with the\nattendant physical symptoms, were\nsufficiently severe.

Seiter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112626\"><a href=\"/opinion/112626/wilson-v-seiter/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 303 (1991). \"[A]n Eighth Amendment\nclaimant need not show that a prison\nofficial acted or failed to act believing\nthat harm actually would befall an\ninmate; it is enough that the official\nacted or failed to act despite his\nknowledge of a substantial risk of\nserious harm.\" Farmer v. Brennan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087956\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087956/farmer-v-brennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 842 (1994). Moreover, in\ndetermining whether prison officials had\nknowledge of the potential harm, we\nconsider whether \"the circumstances\nsuggest that the defendant-official being\nsued had been exposed to information\nconcerning the risk and thus ’must have\nknown’ about it . . . .\" Id.\n\n  Delaney argues that these defendants\nwere subjectively aware that denying\nprisoners access to all out-of-cell exer\ncise for more than 90 days posed a\nsubstantial risk of serious harm. In 1988\nwe upheld an injunction requiring prison\nofficials (at Stateville) to provide 5\nhours of exercise per week to prisoners\nin segregation for more than 90 days.\nDavenport, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"504678\"><a href=\"/opinion/504678/james-davenport-v-richard-derobertis-michael-oleary-and-michael-p/\"><span class=\"volume\">844</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1310</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1314. We noted\nthat at trial the medical director of the\nIllinois Department of Corrections\ntestified to the \"serious adverse effects\non the physical and mental health\" of\nsegregated inmates who were denied access\nto exercise. Id. at 1313. The risk\nidentified in Davenport was acknowledged\nin the institutional directive requiring\n5 hours of exercise per week for\nsegregated inmates.\n\n  Also, the defendants argue that they\nwere unaware that the denial of exercise\nposed a significant risk to Delaney.\nHowever, it is enough that Delaney\nalleges that they acted with deliberate\nindifference towards all members of a\nclass of which he is a part, rather than\nhaving to allege that they acted with\nparticularized malice towards him. See\nCrawford-El, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118203\"><a href=\"/opinion/118203/crawford-el-v-britton/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">574</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 592 (\"When\nintent is an element of a constitutional\nviolation . . . the primary focus is not\non any possible animus directed at the\nplaintiff; rather, it is more specific,\nsuch as an intent to disadvantage all\n\fmembers of a class that includes the\nplaintiff . . . .\"). Deliberate indiffer\nence is akin to criminal recklessness;\nthus, it is enough that defendants are\naware that their action may cause injury\nwithout being able to divine the most\nlikely victim. Farmer, 511 U.S. at 843\n(\"Nor may a prison official escape\nliability for deliberate indifference by\nshowing that, while he was aware of an\nobvious, substantial risk to inmate\nsafety, he did not know that the\ncomplainant was especially likely to be\nassaulted by the specific prisoner . . .\n.\").\n\n  Here, Delaney alleges that he repeatedly\ncomplained to each of the named\ndefendants, filed a grievance, and\nrequested medical attention frequently\nbecause he could not exercise outside his\ncell. In spite of these repeated requests\nand their knowledge of the potential\nrisk, Delaney claims the defendants did\nnothing. This inaction satisfies the sub\njective element of an Eighth Amendment\nclaim.

We based our decision in part on\nthe impressive number of cases from our\nsister circuits which held that failure\nto provide inmates with the opportunity\nfor at least 5 hours of exercise a week\noutside the cell raised serious\nconstitutional questions. Id. A year\nbefore this lockdown was instituted, we\nagain noted that \"[t]o deny a prisoner\nall opportunity for exercise outside his\ncell would, the cases suggest, violate\nthe Eighth Amendment unless the prisoner\nposed an acute security risk if allowed\nout of his cell for even a short time.\"\nAnderson v.

Thus, years before the\nlockdown at issue here was instituted,\nthe case law clearly established that\nextended denials of exercise privileges\nraised constitutional concerns./2 In\nlight of Davenport and Anderson, it was\nobjectively unreasonable for prison offi\ncials to institute a complete 6-month\ndenial of all out-of-cell exercise\nprivileges for segregated prisoners.\n\n  Finally, we note that it may very well\nbe that the defendant guards have no\nliability here because they did not\nestablish the lockdown. If they had no\ndiscretion, then it would appear that\nonly Warden DeTella is a proper\ndefendant. But we can’t say that now on\nthis record, for the defendants have made\nno effort to, for instance, outline the\nchain of command--with responsibilities--\nassigned to each. On this record, Judge\nCoar was right to deny the qualified\nimmunity plea of all defendants. While\nall of these defendants may have other\ndefenses available to them, at this stage\nof the case the order denying them an\nearly exit on qualified immunity grounds\n\fis AFFIRMED and the case REMANDED for\nfurther proceedings.\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\n/1 The Stateville Institutional Directive\n05.04.000K3 at II.C.9 provides:\n\nInmates who have been housed in segregation less\nthan 90 days will be afforded a minimum of one\nhour of recreational activity outside their cells\nper week. Recreational activity will be noted in\na log. Five hours of recreational yard time shall\nbe available to all inmates who have served a\nminimum of 90 days in segregation status in\ncompliance with the Davenport Consent Decree.\n\n/2 To support its argument that the pre-1996 case\nlaw on the denial of exercise was unclear, the\ndefendants cite two cases outside this circuit.\nStrickler v.
