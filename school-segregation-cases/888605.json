JOHN HOSPITAL & MEDICAL\n CENTER, RALPH DiLISIO M.D. and\n EFSTATHIOS TAPAZOGLOU, M.D.,\n\n               Defendant-Appellees.\n\n\n BEFORE THE ENTIRE BENCH\n\n HATHAWAY, J.\n\n        This case addresses the burden of proof necessary to establish proximate causation\n\n in a traditional medical malpractice action. At issue is whether the Court of Appeals\n\n properly reversed the trial court’s denial of summary disposition. The trial court ruled\n\n that plaintiff had established a question of fact on the issue of proximate causation\n\n sufficient to withstand a motion for summary disposition.                 The Court of Appeals\n\n reversed. It treated plaintiff’s claim as a loss-of-opportunity claim instead of a traditional\n\n medical malpractice claim and held that plaintiff did not raise a genuine issue of fact, as\n\frequired by Fulton v William Beaumont Hosp, 253 Mich App 70; 655 NW2d 569 (2002),\n\nbecause plaintiff could not prove that receiving the alleged appropriate treatment would\n\nhave decreased his risk of stroke by greater than 50 percentage points. We disagree with\n\nthe Court of Appeals’ analysis and conclusion.\n\n         We hold that the Court of Appeals erred by relying on Fulton and determining that\n\nthis is a loss-of-opportunity case controlled by both the first and second sentences\n\nof MCL 600.2912a(2), and instead hold that this case presents a claim for traditional\n\nmedical malpractice controlled only by the first sentence of § 2912a(2). Further, we\n\nconclude that plaintiff established a question of fact on the issue of proximate causation\n\nbecause plaintiff’s experts opined that defendants’ negligence more probably than not\n\nwas the proximate cause of plaintiff’s injuries. Finally, we hold that Fulton did not\n\ncorrectly set forth the burden of proof necessary to establish proximate causation for\n\ntraditional medical malpractice cases as set forth in § 2912a(2). Therefore, we overrule\n\nFulton to the extent that it has led courts to improperly designate what should be\n\ntraditional medical malpractice claims as loss-of-opportunity claims and has improperly\n\ntransformed the burden of proof in a traditional malpractice case from a proximate cause\n\nto the proximate cause.\n\n         Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this\n\nmatter to the Court of Appeals for consideration of the issue not decided on appeal in that\n\ncourt.\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f                             I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n\n       This case involves allegations of negligence in medical care. Plaintiff had an\n\nillness known as sickle cell anemia. Plaintiff developed acute chest syndrome (ACS),\n\nwhich is a known complication of sickle cell anemia. Plaintiff claims that his ACS was\n\nmisdiagnosed as pneumonia and as a consequence he did not receive the correct\n\ntreatment. Plaintiff’s experts opined that ACS requires treatment with an aggressive\n\nblood transfusion or an exchange transfusion, either of which needs to be given on a\n\ntimely basis. While plaintiff ultimately received a transfusion, his experts opined that it\n\nwas given too late and as a consequence, plaintiff suffered a disabling stroke. Plaintiff\n\nalleged that defendants’ failure to provide a timely transfusion violated the standard of\n\ncare and that defendants’ negligence was a proximate cause of his disabling stroke.\n\nPlaintiff’s complaint pled a traditional malpractice claim and did not plead a claim for\n\nlost opportunity.\n\n       In support of his position, plaintiff offered two expert hematologists who testified\n\nthat defendants’ violations of the standard of care more probably than not caused\n\nplaintiff’s injuries. Plaintiff’s third hematology expert explained his opinion in statistical\n\nterms and testified that a patient with ACS has a 10 to 20 percent chance of developing a\n\nstroke. He further testified that with a timely exchange transfusion, the risk of stroke is\n\nreduced to less than 5 to 10 percent.\n\n       Defendants brought a motion for summary disposition challenging the sufficiency\n\nof plaintiff’s expert testimony on the issue of proximate causation.            Even though\n\nplaintiff’s complaint pled only traditional malpractice, defendants’ motion made no\n\n\n                                              3\n\fdistinction between the proof required for proximate causation in a traditional\n\nmalpractice claim and the burden required for a claim based on loss of opportunity.\n\nInstead, defendants argued that plaintiff’s case was controlled by both the first and\n\nsecond sentences of MCL 600.2912a(2), which requires that the plaintiff prove “that he\n\nor she suffered an injury that more probably than not was proximately caused by the\n\nnegligence of the defendant or defendants” and that “the plaintiff cannot recover for loss\n\nof an opportunity to survive or an opportunity to achieve a better result unless the\n\nopportunity was greater than 50%.”\n\n       Defendants argued that a reduction in the risk of stroke from 10 to 20 percent to\n\nless than 5 to 10 percent amounted to at best a 20 percentage point differential,1 which\n\nwould be insufficient to meet the burden of proof on proximate causation. Defendants\n\nrelied on Fulton to support their position that plaintiff must comply with this percentage\n\npoint differential theory. Plaintiff countered that defendants’ statistical portrayal of these\n\nnumbers was mathematically inaccurate because his experts’ testimony supported a\n\nfinding that his injuries were more probably than not proximately caused by defendants’\n\nnegligence. The trial court agreed with plaintiff. The trial court denied defendants’\n\n\n\n\n       1\n         The Court of Appeals reasoned: “This number is the difference between the\nhighest chance plaintiff had of developing a stroke without proper treatment (i.e., 20\npercent) and the lowest chance of developing a stroke with proper treatment (i.e., less\nthan five percent, or in the light most favorable to plaintiff, zero percent)”. O’Neal v St\nJohn Hosp & Med Ctr, unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued\nNovember 4, 2008 (Docket Nos. 277317 and 277318), p 5 n 7.\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\fmotion, ruling that plaintiff had presented sufficient testimony to establish a question of\n\nfact on proximate causation.\n\n       The Court of Appeals based its decision entirely on Fulton and reversed the trial\n\ncourt in an unpublished opinion per curiam, holding that this case presented a claim for a\n\nloss of opportunity and that plaintiff had not met his burden of proof under MCL\n\n600.2912a(2).2 The Court of Appeals reasoned that plaintiff was bound by the Fulton\n\nanalysis and that a percentage point differential applied to this case.3 The Court opined:\n\n               In asserting that defendants’ negligence resulted in a stroke, plaintiff\n       essentially argues that had defendants ordered a transfusion sooner, plaintiff\n       would have avoided a stroke. Thus, to say defendants’ failure to apply\n       proper treatment caused the stroke is to say that this failure deprived\n       plaintiff a greater opportunity to avoid the stroke. Consequently, plaintiff’s\n       claim amounts to one of lost opportunity to achieve a better result, and §\n       2912a(2) is applicable.\n\n             In Fulton, this Court set forth the formula by which to calculate\n       whether the opportunity to achieve a better result was greater than 50\n       percent – specifically, the Court must “subtract[] the plaintiff's opportunity\n       to survive after the defendant’s alleged malpractice from the initial\n       opportunity to survive without the malpractice.” Ensink [v Mecosta Co Gen\n       Hosp, 262 Mich App 518, 531; 687 NW2d 143 (2004)], supra at 531.[4]\n\n       We granted leave to review this matter, asking the parties to brief:\n\n              (1) whether the requirements set forth in the second sentence of\n       MCL 600.2912a(2) apply in this case; (2) if not, whether the plaintiff\n       presented sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of fact with regard to\n       whether the defendants’ conduct proximately caused his injury or (3) if so,\n       whether Fulton v William Beaumont Hosp, 253 Mich App 70 (2002), was\n       2\n           Id. at 4.\n       3\n           Id. at 4-5.\n       4\n           Id. at 4.\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f      correctly decided, or whether a different approach is required to correctly\n      implement the second sentence of § 2912a(2).[5]\n\n                             II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n      This case involves review of a trial court’s decision on a motion for summary\n\ndisposition which this Court reviews de novo.6 The issue also involves questions of\n\nstatutory interpretation. Statutory interpretation is a question of law, which this Court\n\nalso reviews de novo.7\n\n                                    III. ANALYSIS\n\n      At issue is whether the Court of Appeals properly reversed the trial court’s denial\n\nof summary disposition on the issue of proximate causation. In order to answer this\n\nquestion we must review MCL 600.2912a.\n\n      MCL 600.2912a provides:\n\n\n              (1) Subject to subsection (2), in an action alleging malpractice, the\n      plaintiff has the burden of proving that in light of the state of the art\n      existing at the time of the alleged malpractice:\n\n              (a) The defendant, if a general practitioner, failed to provide the\n      plaintiff the recognized standard of acceptable professional practice or care\n      in the community in which the defendant practices or in a similar\n      community, and that as a proximate result of the defendant failing to\n      provide that standard, the plaintiff suffered an injury.\n\n\n\n      5\n          O’Neal v St John Hosp & Med Ctr, 485 Mich 901 (2009).\n      6\n          Herald Co v Bay City, 463 Mich 111, 117; 614 NW2d 873 (2000).\n      7\n      In re Investigation of March 1999 Riots in East Lansing), 463 Mich 378, 383;\n617 NW2d 310 (2000).\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\f              (b) The defendant, if a specialist, failed to provide the recognized\n      standard of practice or care within that specialty as reasonably applied in\n      light of the facilities available in the community or other facilities\n      reasonably available under the circumstances, and as a proximate result of\n      the defendant failing to provide that standard, the plaintiff suffered an\n      injury.\n\n              (2) In an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff has the\n      burden of proving that he or she suffered an injury that more probably than\n      not was proximately caused by the negligence of the defendant or\n      defendants. In an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff cannot\n      recover for loss of an opportunity to survive or an opportunity to achieve a\n      better result unless the opportunity was greater than 50%.\n\n      This statute, which governs the burden of proof in medical malpractice cases, was\n\noriginally added to the Revised Judicature Act in 1977. It has been amended on several\n\noccasions, with the most recent amendment in 1993 adding subsection (2), which is at\n\nissue in this case. Subsection (2) contains two sentences. It is undisputed that the first\n\nsentence, which repeats the burden of proof as articulated in subsections (1)(a) and (b),\n\nmerely reiterates the longstanding rule requiring a plaintiff to prove “that he or she\n\nsuffered an injury that more probably than not was proximately caused by the negligence\n\nof the defendant or defendants.” MCL 600.2912a(2).\n\n      The second sentence of § 2912a(2) addresses a subcategory of injuries in medical\n\nmalpractice litigation governed by the loss-of-opportunity doctrine. The Legislature did\n\nnot define the phrase “loss of an opportunity to survive or an opportunity to achieve a\n\nbetter result.” However, while not defined in the statute, the doctrine was initially\n\n\n\n\n                                            7\n\frecognized and defined in Michigan in Falcon v Mem Hosp, 436 Mich 443; 462 NW2d\n\n44 (1990).8\n\n       It is generally accepted that the 1993 amendment to § 2912a was adopted in a\n\ndirect reaction to Falcon, meaning that it repudiated Falcon’s reduced proximate\n\ncausation theory.9 Thus, it is generally accepted that in adopting this amendment, the\n\nLegislature intended to limit medical malpractice claims to the pre-Falcon state of the\n\nlaw: if it was more probable than not that the plaintiff would have died even with the best\n\nof treatment, a claim for medical malpractice is precluded.10\n\n       We next turn to the correct interpretation of both sentences of § 2912a(2) and their\n\napplicability to the case before us. In examining the first line of § 2912a(2), we are\n\nguided by the principle that nothing in § 2912a(2) has changed the burden of proof for\n\ntraditional medical malpractice claims. The language of the first line of subsection (2) is\n\nclear: “in an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff has the burden of proving\n\nthat he or she suffered an injury that more probably than not was proximately caused by\n\n       8\n         Falcon held that in a wrongful death case a plaintiff could bring a claim for a\ndecedent’s loss of opportunity to survive even if he or she did not meet the traditional\nproximate causation standard. Falcon reasoned that when the decedent suffered a\nsubstantial reduction in the loss of opportunity to survive—in that case 37.5 percent—\neven though the plaintiff could not maintain a traditional malpractice claim for the death\nitself because the plaintiff could not establish causation, she could bring a claim for loss\nof opportunity to survive. Falcon also stated that the doctrine applied to wrongful death\nclaims and left the question of whether the doctrine applied to lesser injuries to another\nday. 436 Mich at 460-462, 469-470 (opinion by LEVIN, J.).\n       9\n           Stone v Willaimson, 482 Mich 144, 169; 753 NW2d 106 (2008).\n       10\n            Nothing in our opinion today alters or changes that premise.\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\fthe negligence of the defendant or defendants.” This language reiterates the language of\n\nthe previous subsections and merely restates the well-accepted, well-established historical\n\nrule for proximate causation.11 As the meaning of this sentence is well-established, no\n\nfurther statutory construction is necessary.\n\n       The proper interpretation of proximate causation in a negligence action is well-\n\nsettled in Michigan. In order to be a proximate cause, the negligent conduct must have\n\nbeen a cause of the plaintiff’s injury and the plaintiff’s injury must have been a natural\n\nand probable result of the negligent conduct.        These two prongs are respectively\n\ndescribed as “cause-in-fact” and “legal causation.” See Skinner v Square D Co, 445\n\nMich 153, 162-163; 516 NW2d 475 (1994); Sutter v Biggs, 377 Mich 80; 139 NW2d 684\n\n(1966); Glinski v Szylling, 358 Mich 182; 99 NW2d 637 (1959). While legal causation\n\nrelates to the foreseeability of the consequences of the defendant’s conduct, the cause-in-\n\nfact prong “generally requires showing that ‘but for’ the defendant’s actions, the\n\nplaintiff’s injury would not have occurred.” Skinner, 455 Mich at 163. It is equally well-\n\nsettled that proximate causation in a malpractice claim is treated no differently than in an\n\nordinary negligence claim, and it is well-established that there can be more than one\n\nproximate cause contributing to an injury. Brisboy v Fibreboard Corp, 429 Mich 540;\n\n418 NW2d 650 (1988); Barringer v Arnold, 358 Mich 594; 101 NW2d 365 (1960);\n\nGleason v Hanafin, 308 Mich 31; 13 NW2d 196 (1944). Finally, it is well-established\n\n\n       11\n       Kirby v Larson, 400 Mich 585, 600-607; 256 NW2d 400 (1977)(opinion by\nWILLIAMS, J.).\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\fthat the proper standard for proximate causation in a negligence action is that the\n\nnegligence must be “a proximate cause” not “the proximate cause.” Kirby v Larson, 400\n\nMich 585; 256 NW2d 400 (1977). Thus, the burden of proof for proximate causation in\n\ntraditional medical malpractice cases is analyzed according to its historical common law\n\ndefinitions and the analysis is the same as in any other ordinary negligence claim.\n\nNothing in this opinion changes or alters these well-settled principles.12\n\n       We next consider whether the Court of Appeals erred by relying on Fulton and\n\napplying the second sentence of § 2912a(2) to the present case. The second sentence of\n\n§ 2912a(2) provides “In an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff cannot\n\nrecover for loss of an opportunity to survive or an opportunity to achieve a better result\n\nunless the opportunity was greater than 50%.” Since the statute was amended in 1993,\n\nlitigants and the courts have debated the meaning of this second sentence.13 While the\n\n       12\n          This is true despite the contrary statements in Justice YOUNG’s dissent. The\ncomments of the dissent amount to nothing more than another intemperate outburst of\ninappropriate accusations and illogical assertions. While the dissent decries confusion,\nthe only apparent confusion in this matter lies in the dissent itself, which lacks sound\nanalytical reasoning and even a basic understanding of the law of proximate causation.\nThe dissent, if followed to its logical conclusion, would allow recourse for the negligent\nactions of medical providers only in those instances in which one provider’s conduct is at\nissue and only when no pre-existing medical condition exists. Such an interpretation is\nnot supported by any case law or the statute itself.\n       13\n          The opinions in Stone illustrate this point. The debate has centered on such\nquestions as whether the Legislature intended this sentence to restore the law to its pre-\nFalcon state, meaning that loss-of-opportunity claims are not recognized at all, or\nwhether the Legislature’s choice of language reflected intent to recognize such claims but\nlimit their availability. Questions have also arisen about whether the last sentence of\n§ 2912a(2) applies to all medical malpractice cases, including traditional ones, or only\nthose that are presented as loss-of-opportunity claims.\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\fdebate over the meaning of the second sentence demonstrates that significant questions\n\nsurround loss-of-opportunity cases, it is clear from the plain language of the statute that\n\nthe second sentence is intended to apply to loss-of-opportunity cases. Today we address\n\nwhether the second sentence of § 2912a(2) also applies to traditional malpractice cases\n\nand we unequivocally hold that it does not. Because the Court of Appeals in this case\n\nrelied on Fulton, which erroneously applied the second sentence to a traditional\n\nmalpractice case, we review Fulton and determine what, if any, continuing validity it has.\n\n       Fulton involved a claim for the failure to timely diagnose cervical cancer. The\n\nplaintiff, the personal representative of the decedent’s estate, alleged that if decedent’s\n\ncancer had been diagnosed during her pregnancy, she would have had treatment options\n\navailable that could have saved her life. The theory was that the decedent was not\n\ndiagnosed until her cancer was untreatable and, as a consequence, she died.            The\n\nplaintiff’s expert’s testimony on proximate causation was described by the Court of\n\nAppeals as follows:\n\n              Defendants moved for summary disposition under MCR\n       2.116(C)(10), arguing that plaintiff could not show that their negligence\n       was the cause of Fulton's death. In response, plaintiff submitted an\n       affidavit from Dr. Taylor, opining that if Fulton's cancer had been\n       diagnosed while she was pregnant and if she had been treated after her child\n       was delivered, she would have had an eighty-five percent chance to survive.\n       Dr. Taylor opined that when Fulton was actually diagnosed with cancer, her\n       opportunity to survive had decreased to sixty to sixty-five percent.\n       Therefore, according to Dr. Taylor, Fulton's opportunity to survive the\n       cancer decreased by twenty to twenty-five percent because of defendants'\n       malpractice. In reply, defendants argued that Dr. Taylor's affidavit was\n       improper because it contradicted his deposition testimony and that, in any\n\n\n\n\n                                            11\n\f       event, this affidavit was not enough to create a question of fact under MCL\n       600.2912a(2).[14]\n\n       Fulton opined that because the decedent went from an 85 percent pre-malpractice\n\nchance of survival to a 60-65 percent post-malpractice chance of survival, she “suffered a\n\nloss of a twenty to twenty-five percent chance of survival.”15 Fulton determined that a\n\npercentage point differential subtraction analysis was required by the statute.          As\n\ndemonstrated by the Fulton analysis, the conclusion is reached by a simplistic subtraction\n\nformula.      Fulton subtracted the statistical likelihood of a better outcome without\n\ntreatment from the statistical likelihood of a better outcome with treatment to determine if\n\nthe resulting number is greater than 50.\n\n       Fulton’s simplistic subtraction formula is not an accurate way to determine\n\nwhether a defendant’s malpractice is a proximate cause of the injury. Fulton’s analysis\n\nwas erroneous because it misconstrued proximate causation as it applies to a traditional\n\nmalpractice case. Under the Fulton subtraction formula it is mathematically impossible\n\nfor there to be more than one proximate cause.        Thus, in creating and applying this\n\nsimplistic formula, Fulton fundamentally altered plaintiff’s burden of proof. Fulton\n\ntransformed the burden of proof in traditional malpractice cases from a proximate cause\n\nto the proximate cause because it allows for only one proximate cause in any case. This\n\nproposition is in error because it has no basis in statute or common law and it is\n\ninconsistent with the clear and unambiguous language of the first sentence of § 2912a(2).\n       14\n            Fulton, 253 Mich App at 74-75.\n       15\n            Id. at 82.\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\fMoreover, as the Court of Appeals’ decision in this case illustrates, Fulton’s analysis is\n\nbeing applied to all malpractice cases, even when they are pled only as traditional\n\nmalpractice cases.\n\n       The Court of Appeals analysis in the present case perpetuates the Fulton doctrine\n\nand the confusion surrounding proximate causation in medical malpractice claims. Much\n\nof the confusion stems from the inherent nature of medical malpractice: the plaintiff is\n\ngenerally seeking treatment for a preexisting medical condition that is causing a problem\n\nof some sort on its own, whereas in an ordinary negligence claim the plaintiff is generally\n\nan otherwise uninjured person who is claiming that the entire injury was caused by the\n\nincident.\n\n       In the present case, plaintiff was prepared to offer three expert witnesses to testify\n\non his behalf on the issue of proximate causation at the time of trial. Two of plaintiff’s\n\nexperts unequivocally opined, in a discovery deposition, that had the necessary treatment\n\nbeen given, it was more probable than not that plaintiff would not have had a stroke.\n\n       Plaintiff’s first expert, Dr. Richard Stein, opined:\n\n              Q. I just have one question. Doctor, based on the extrapolation of\n       the peds data that you’ve described for us, within a reasonable degree of\n       medical certainty, and by that I mean with a greater than 50 percent\n       likelihood, if Dr Tapazoglou had met the standard of care as you defined it\n       today, would the stroke have been avoided?\n\n              A. To a reasonable degree of medical certainty, my opinion is yes,\n       and I have already stated the basis for that opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\f      After opining that an exchange transfusion was necessary to reduce plaintiff’s\n\nhemoglobin S concentration to less than 30 percent, Dr. Luce, plaintiff’s second expert,\n\nopined:\n\n            Q. With respect to Mr. O’Neal, if the hemoglobin S had been\n      reduced to less than 30 percent, do you have an opinion as to whether or not\n      he would have had the stroke anyhow?\n\n             A. I think it is probable that he would not have.\n\n             Q. When you say “probable,” are you prepared to say more\n      probably than not had Mr. O’Neal had his hemoglobin S reduced to less\n      than 30 percent he would not have had a stroke?\n\n             A. Correct.\n\n      The testimony of the third expert, Dr. Griffin Rodgers, was more specific in\n\nexpressing the statistics. The trial court summarized his testimony:\n\n             Dr. Griffin Rodgers, a hematologist, testified that a patient in sickle\n      cell crisis of acute chest syndrome has in the order of 10 or 20 percent\n      chance of developing a stroke. With a timely exchange transfusion, it\n      reduces the risk of stroke to less than 5 or 10 percent. Dr. Griffin’s\n      testimony demonstrates that Plaintiff had more than a 50 percent chance to\n      avoid a stroke.\n\n      As this case demonstrates, the way causation is analyzed is important, especially\n\nwhen reviewing statistical data. In this instance, do these facts represent at best a 20\n\npercent chance to avoid an injury, as the Court of Appeals concluded, or do they establish\n\nproximate causation as found by the trial court? To answer this question we must\n\ndetermine whether we use a percentage point differential subtraction analysis (as used by\n\nthe Court of Appeals in applying the Fulton formula) or whether we follow the approach\n\ntaken by the trial court. In doing so we must follow the analysis that is most consistent\n\nwith our historical rules governing proximate causation and the plain language of\n\n\n                                            14\n\f§ 2912a(2), which requires that a plaintiff prove that he or she suffered an injury that\n\nmore probably than not was proximately caused by the negligence of the defendant or\n\ndefendants, in the context of this case. While the use of mathematical statistics is not\n\nrequired by the statute, and we do not impose such a requirement, we conclude that the\n\nanalysis used by plaintiff’s experts and the trial court represents the correct approach in\n\nthis instance because it accurately represents the historical view of proximate causation\n\nas expressed in the first sentence of § 2912a(2) based on its application to these facts.\n\n       In this case, it is undisputed that with or without treatment plaintiff was more\n\nprobably than not going to avoid the stroke. In other words, even without treatment it\n\nwas more probable that plaintiff would not have a stroke. However, plaintiff did have a\n\nstroke. If the Fulton 50 percentage point differential subtraction analysis is used, plaintiff\n\ncannot proceed with a traditional claim because the failure to provide treatment was not\n\nthe cause of the injury expressed in percentage point differential terms. As previously\n\nindicated, however, the problem is that a 50 percentage point differential subtraction\n\nanalysis necessarily means that there can only be one cause of an injury. This analysis is\n\nnot consistent with the historical test for proximate causation, which has always been that\n\nthe malpractice be a proximate cause rather than the proximate cause.\n\n       Applying a 50 percentage point differential subtraction analysis requires that we\n\nchange the traditional analysis of causation in medical malpractice cases to the one most\n\nimmediate, efficient, and direct cause of the injury. This, however, is the standard for\n\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\fdetermining the proximate cause rather than a proximate cause. This approach is simply\n\nnot in keeping with our historical view of causation.16\n\n       The Fulton approach is incorrect because it requires a reliance on probabilities and\n\npossibilities of things that have not yet occurred, rather than reliance on what has actually\n\noccurred. Plaintiff in this case did have a stroke and was injured; his claim is for an\n\nexisting injury, not just the possibility of one. Plaintiff’s injury is no longer a statistical\n\nprobability, it is a reality. The focus, once he was injured, is on the connection between\n\ndefendants’ conduct and the injury. The relevant inquiry for proximate causation is\n\nwhether the negligent conduct was a cause of plaintiff’s injury and whether plaintiff’s\n\ninjury was a natural and probable result of the negligent conduct. If so, defendants’\n\nconduct was a proximate cause, even though there may have been other causes. The\n\nanalysis for proximate causation is the same whether we are discussing medical\n\nmalpractice or ordinary negligence. Defendants’ conduct in this case meets this standard\n\nwhen the defendants’ actual conduct, rather than plaintiff’s statistical probability of\n\nachieving a better outcome, is the focus of the inquiry.\n\n\n16\n   Common-law rules apply to medical malpractice actions unless specifically abrogated\nby statute. See MCL 600.2912(1) which provides:\n\n              A civil action for malpractice may be maintained against any person\n       professing or holding himself out to be a member of a state licensed\n       profession. The rules of the common law applicable to actions against\n       members of a state licensed profession, for malpractice, are applicable\n       against any person who holds himself out to be a member of a state\n       licensed profession. [Emphasis added.]\n\n\n\n\n                                              16\n\f      In this instance, plaintiff suffered an injury that was more probably than not\n\nproximately caused by the negligence of defendants. As the trial court properly found,\n\ndefendants’ negligent conduct increased plaintiff’s risk of stroke from less than 5 to 10\n\npercent to 10 to 20 percent. When viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff, the\n\nchange is from less than 5 percent to 20 percent. As the trial court analyzed, this\n\nrepresents a change that is greater than 50 percent in this instance. The trial court’s\n\napproach is in keeping with the historical analysis of proximate causation because it\n\ninvolves a comparative analysis, not a simplistic subtraction formula. Determining what\n\nis “more probable than not” is inherently a comparative analysis. The proper method of\n\ndetermining whether defendant’s conduct more probably than not proximately caused the\n\ninjury involves a comparative analysis, which is dependent upon the facts and\n\ncircumstances and expert opinion in a given case.17\n\n      We conclude that Fulton’s simple subtraction analysis is wrong and\n\nunsupportable. While § 2912a(2) does not mandate the use of statistics or require any\n\nparticular mathematical formula, the historic analysis of proximate cause must be\n\nfollowed to wit: the analysis or formulation used cannot require that the cause must be\n\nthe proximate cause rather than a proximate cause.\n\n      No single formula can be dispositive for all cases. In this case if we were to use a\n\nstandard percentage decrease calculation (meaning that defendants were responsible for\n\n      17\n         Comparative analyses could include standard percentage increases, standard\npercentage decreases, or other scientifically accepted statistical analyses offered by the\nexperts.\n\n\n\n                                           17\n\f15 percentage points out of the 20 total percentage points of plaintiff’s risk of the bad\n\nresult, so that there is a 15/20 chance or 75 percent chance) defendant’s malpractice was a\n\nproximate cause of the injury.18 Similarly, if the evidence is viewed as a standard\n\npercentage increase calculation (meaning that defendant was responsible for 15\n\npercentage points of increase over the 5 percentage points to begin with, thus causing a\n\n300% (15/5) increase in plaintiff’s risk of harm,) defendant’s malpractice was a\n\nproximate cause of the injury.19\n\n       It is also important to emphasize that not all traditional medical malpractice cases\n\ncan or will be expressed in statistical or percentage terms, nor is a plaintiff required to\n\nexpress proximate causation in percentage terms. The plain language of the statute\n\nrequires that proximate causation in traditional malpractice cases be expressed by\n\nshowing that the defendant’s conduct was more probably than not a cause of the injury,\n\nnot by statistical or percentage terms.20\n\n\n       18\n           Moreover, either of the mathematical formulas used as an example (standard\nstatistical decrease or increase) may not be appropriate in all cases because either could\nlimit causation to one proximate cause in those cases involving the conduct of more than\none defendant.\n       19\n         I recognize that Justice CAVANAGH and I differ on whether an increased risk of\nharm is a valid statistical method for determining proximate causation in a traditional\nmalpractice case. However, both Justice CAVANAGH and I agree that claims evaluated in\nthat manner may be brought; we only disagree about whether those claims proceed as\nclaims for traditional malpractice or claims for loss-of-opportunity.\n       20\n          We also recognize that different mathematical formulations can have varying\nresults and that the results must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\nparty. For example, while percentage increases and percentage decreases would both be\nvalid methods to determine proximate causation, they can yield different results. In those\n\n\n                                            18\n\f       Given that Fulton used an incorrect mathematical formula and is being used to\n\ntransform the burden of proof in traditional malpractice cases, we must next decide if it\n\nhas any continuing validity. We find that it has none in the context of traditional medical\n\nmalpractice cases. In Stone, all seven justices of this Court recognized that Fulton’s\n\nanalysis was incorrect or should be found to no longer be good law, though their reasons\n\nfor doing so varied.21 While I was not a member of this Court when Stone was decided, I\n\nalso conclude that Fulton did not correctly set forth the burden of proof necessary to\n\nestablish proximate causation as set forth in § 2912a(2). As all justices of this Court have\n\nconcluded that Fulton’s analysis of § 2912a(2) is wrong, it is illogical to fail to overrule\n\nFulton, because by failing to do so, this Court fosters unnecessary confusion for litigants\n\nand the lower courts. Accordingly, we overrule Fulton to the extent that it has led courts\n\nto improperly designate what should be traditional medical malpractice claims as loss-of-\n\nopportunity claims and has improperly transformed the burden of proof in a traditional\n\nmalpractice case from a proximate cause to the proximate cause.\n\n       We emphasize that we hold that the second sentence of § 2912a(2) applies only to\n\nmedical malpractice cases that plead loss of opportunity and not to those that plead\n\ntraditional medical malpractice; we do not address the scope, extent, or nature of loss-of-\n\nopportunity claims as that issue is not before us. Significant questions surround such\n\n\ninstances, if either calculation demonstrates that the plaintiff suffered an injury that more\nprobably than not was proximately caused by the negligence of the defendant or\ndefendants, the plaintiff’s case may proceed.\n       21\n            Stone, 482 Mich at 164 (opinion by TAYLOR, C.J.).\n\n\n\n                                             19\n\fclaims.22 However, we decline to decide issues that are not necessary to the resolution of\n\nthe case before us.\n\n                                   IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       For all the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the Court of Appeals erred in the\n\npresent case by reversing the trial court’s denial of summary disposition. The case before\n\nus presents a traditional malpractice claim. It does not present a claim for loss of\n\nopportunity. In traditional malpractice cases, the plaintiff is required to prove that the\n\ndefendant’s negligence more probably than not caused the plaintiff’s injury. In this case,\n\nthe testimony of plaintiff’s expert witnesses supports plaintiff’s position on proximate\n\ncausation. While that testimony is not dispositive, it is sufficient to raise a question of\n\nfact to defeat a motion for summary disposition, allowing the issue to be adjudicated on\n\nthe merits by the trier of fact. Finally, we overrule Fulton to the extent that it has led\n\ncourts to improperly designate what should be traditional medical malpractice claims as\n\nloss-of-opportunity claims and has improperly transformed the burden of proof in a\n\ntraditional malpractice case from a proximate cause to the proximate cause.\n\n\n\n\n       22\n          Questions exist about the full scope and extent of loss-of-opportunity claims and\nthe extent of damages recoverable in those actions, which we do not decide today. For\nexample, a partial discussion of the scope of loss-of-opportunity claims was at issue in\nWickens v Oakwood Healthcare Sys, 465 Mich 53; 631 NW2d 686 (2001). While Justice\nCAVANAGH and I do not fully agree in this case, I do agree with Justice CAVANAGH’s\npartial dissent in Wickens that a living person may pursue a claim for loss of opportunity\nunder the circumstances presented in that case.\n\n\n\n                                            20\n\f         Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this\n\nmatter to the Court of Appeals for consideration of the issue not decided on appeal in that\n\ncourt.\n\n\n         WEAVER, J., concurred with HATHAWAY, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                            21\n\f                            STATE OF MICHIGAN\n\n                                     SUPREME COURT\n\n\nRAYMOND O’NEAL,\n\n              Plaintiff-Appellant,\n\nv                                                            No. 138180, 138181\n\nST. JOHN HOSPITAL & MEDICAL\nCENTER, RALPH DiLISIO, M.D., and\nEFSTATHIOS TAPAZOGLOU, M.D.,\n\n              Defendant-Appellees.\n\n\nCAVANAGH, J. (concurring).\n\n       I concur in the result. I agree with the majority that the Court of Appeals’\n\njudgment in this case should be reversed because the Court erred by treating this case as a\n\nloss-of-opportunity case instead of a traditional medical malpractice case and, as a result,\n\nerred by requiring plaintiff to meet the requirements in the second sentence of MCL\n\n600.2912a(2). I further agree that Fulton v William Beaumont Hosp, 253 Mich App 70;\n\n655 NW2d 569 (2002), should be overruled to the extent that courts have relied on it to\n\nimproperly transform what could be traditional medical malpractice claims into loss-of-\n\nopportunity claims.1 I write separately to express my views on the issues presented.\n\n\n       1\n         Contrary to Justice YOUNG’s assertion, I overrule Fulton only to the extent that it\nis implicated in this case. Regardless, I am sincerely baffled about what relevance Chief\nJustice KELLY’s views on a former composition of this Court have to do with whether we\nshould overrule a Court of Appeals case.\n\f      This case raises the issue of what the proper burden of proof for proximate\n\ncausation is in medical malpractice cases in which the plaintiff had a preexisting risk of\n\nthe bad result that occurred, even absent the defendant’s alleged negligence. I agree with\n\nthe lead opinion that the second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) is inapplicable to this\n\ncase because it only applies to loss-of-opportunity claims and this case does not involve a\n\nloss-of-opportunity claim. Instead, the key issue in this case is the proper interpretation\n\nof the first sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2).\n\n      The first sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) clearly provides that a plaintiff in any\n\nmedical malpractice case, including a traditional medical malpractice case, bears the\n\nburden of showing that it is more probable than not that the plaintiff’s injury was\n\nproximately caused by the defendant’s negligence. Under traditional malpractice law in\n\nMichigan, proximate cause includes two prongs: (1) cause in fact and (2) legal, or\n\n“proximate,” cause.2 See, e.g., Skinner v Square D Co, 445 Mich 153, 162-163; 516\n\nNW2d 475 (1994).         While legal causation relates to the foreseeability of the\n\nconsequences of the defendant’s conduct, the cause-in-fact prong “generally requires\n\nshowing that ‘but for’ the defendant’s actions, the plaintiff’s injury would not have\n\noccurred.” Id. at 163. The cause-in-fact prong is sometimes also stated as requiring that\n\n“it is more likely than not that the conduct of the defendant was a cause in fact of the\n\nresult.” Weymers v Khera, 454 Mich 639, 648; 563 NW2d 647 (1997) (quotation marks\n\n      2\n        Because the statute incorporates words and phrases from the common law, it is\nappropriate to consider common-law meanings of these phrases. See People v Wright,\n432 Mich 84, 92; 437 NW2d 603 (1989).\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\fand citations omitted). Thus, even in cases in which there is statistical evidence that the\n\nplaintiff had a risk of the bad result occurring absent negligence,3 a plaintiff may still\n\nmeet the cause-in-fact prong of the proximate causation analysis if the plaintiff can show\n\nthat it is more probable than not that the defendant’s alleged negligence was a cause in\n\nfact of the bad result occurring. I would hold that this threshold is met if the plaintiff can\n\nshow that the alleged negligence was responsible for a majority, or “more than fifty\n\npercent,” of the risk of the bad result occurring. See MCL 600.2912a(2) and Falcon v\n\nMem Hosp, 436 Mich 443, 450; 462 NW2d 44 (1990).4\n\n       Under this approach, a court should consider the total risk of the bad result that the\n\nplaintiff faced, including the risk caused by the alleged negligence. Then, the court\n\nshould consider how much of that risk was created by the negligence. If the negligence\n\nwas responsible for more than half of the total risk of the bad result and the plaintiff\n\nsuffered that bad result, then the cause-in-fact prong of the proximate cause analysis is\n\nmet because it is more probable than not that the defendant’s negligence was a cause in\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         I agree with the lead opinion, however, that not all traditional medical\nmalpractice cases need to be expressed in statistical or percentage terms in order to meet\nthe “more probable than not” standard.\n       4\n        If a plaintiff cannot meet the burden for a traditional medical malpractice claim, I\nwould hold that the plaintiff may still pursue a loss-of-opportunity claim if the plaintiff\ncan meet the requirements for those claims provided in MCL 600.2912a(2) and Falcon,\nas explained in my opinion in Stone v Williamson, 482 Mich 144, 170-179; 753 NW2d\n106 (2008).\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\ffact of the bad result.5 This approach is consistent with the statutory language “more\n\nprobable than not” and with the historical approach to proximate causation.6\n\n\n       5\n         To give a nonmedical example, if I am rolling a die, there is ordinarily a 1 out of\n6 chance that I will roll a number one. But if a defendant negligently changes two\nadditional sides of the die to number ones, then the die will have three number ones.\nNow my chances of rolling a number one are 3 out of 6 (or 1/2). If I actually roll a\nnumber one, there is a 2/3 (approximately 67 percent) chance that I rolled a number one\nthat was created by the defendant’s negligence. Therefore, there is a more than 50\npercent chance that I rolled a number one because of the defendant’s negligence, i.e., it is\nmore probable than not that the defendant’s negligence was a cause in fact of the result.\nNotably, this analysis will differ somewhat if the plaintiff’s increased risk of the bad\nresult is alleged to have been caused by multiple negligent actors, depending on the\ntiming and the interaction of the various causes.\n       6\n          Justice YOUNG haphazardly concludes that “the majority” is extending the\nexception to the cause-in-fact prong created in Falcon to all medical malpractice claims.\nI agree that Falcon created what was essentially an exception to this rule, but I fail to see,\nand Justice YOUNG utterly fails to explain, how my approach in this case is an extension\nof that rule to all traditional medical malpractice cases. Justice YOUNG himself explains\nthat “[i]n cases in which the plaintiff alleges that the defendant’s negligence more\nprobably than not caused the injury, the claim is one of simple medical malpractice [as\nopposed to loss-of-opportunity].” (Quotation marks and citation omitted.)\n\n        Setting aside the numerous pages of Justice YOUNG’s opinion that consist only of\nirrelevant, hyperbolic, or unsubstantiated commentary, he appears to raise only two\nsubstantive concerns with my approach, and neither provides support for his conclusion\nthat it does not satisfy the cause-in-fact prong. First, he irrelevantly notes that, as I\nconcede in footnote 7, this approach is inconsistent with an example I used in Stone.\nSecond, he alleges that I should not have compared the low end of the possible range of\nplaintiff’s risk of the bad result absent negligence to the high end of the range of\nplaintiff’s risk with negligence. I think that my approach is perfectly consistent with our\ncharge to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, given that even\nJustice YOUNG explains that the experts testified that plaintiff’s risk was somewhere\nbetween the ranges the experts provided. But regardless, this criticism only challenges\nwhich numbers to use and not the merits of the approach itself, and it would be possible,\nas Justice YOUNG prefers, to instead compare the low ends of the ranges, or the high\nends, only to each other. For example, if the alleged negligence increased a plaintiff’s\nrisk of the bad result from 5 to 10 percent to 30 to 40 percent, then, regardless of which\nnumbers are compared, the negligence would have been responsible for a majority of the\n\n\n                                              4\n\f       In adopting this approach, I reject the view that a plaintiff must show that the\n\ndefendant’s negligence increased the plaintiff’s risk by more than 50 percentage points,\n\ne.g., from 25 percent to 76 percent, or from 10 percent to 61 percent.7 As noted by the\n\nlead opinion, this approach is inconsistent with the historical approach to proximate\n\ncausation. It is also inconsistent with the first sentence in MCL 600.2912a(2) because it\n\nwould preclude traditional medical malpractice claims in many cases in which the\n\ndefendant’s negligence was more probably than not a cause in fact of the bad result, such\n\nas in a case in which the negligence increased the risk of a bad result from 5 percent to 45\n\npercent.8 I also reject the lead opinion’s “percent-increase” test because it is similarly\n\ninconsistent with a more-probable-than-not standard. The fact that a negligent act caused\n\n\n\n\nplaintiff’s risk of the bad result, and, given that the bad result occurred, it would be more\nprobable than not that the negligence was a cause in fact of the bad result occurring.\nJustice YOUNG fails to address why this logic is incorrect or levy a criticism that actually\nsupports his conclusion that my approach eviscerates the cause-in-fact requirement.\n       7\n         To the extent that I endorsed the percentage point approach by way of an\nexample in my opinion in Stone, I repudiate that position. See Stone, 482 Mich at 177\n(opinion by CAVANAGH, J.), stating that a plaintiff whose chance of survival decreased\nfrom 80 to 40 percent could not bring a traditional malpractice claim because it would not\namount to a 50 percent change.\n       8\n          In this example, the defendant was responsible for 40 percentage points of the\nplaintiff’s risk, out of a total of 45 percentage points, meaning that there is a 40 out of 45\nchance, or 40/45 (approximately 89 percent) chance, that the defendant’s negligence was\na cause in fact of the bad outcome. In contrast, under the percentage-point approach, the\nplaintiff’s burden would not have been met because the increase in risk was 40\npercentage points.\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\fa 50 percent increase in the risk of a bad result does not demonstrate that it is more\n\nprobable than not that the negligence was a cause in fact of the bad result.9\n\n       In this case, plaintiff presented sufficient facts to establish the cause-in-fact prong\n\nof the proximate cause analysis in a traditional medical malpractice claim. Viewing the\n\nfacts in the light most favorable to plaintiff, plaintiff’s expert testified that defendants’\n\nalleged negligence increased plaintiff’s risk of the bad result, the stroke, from 5 percent to\n\n20 percent. Defendant was thus responsible for 15 percentage points out of the total 20\n\npercentage points of plaintiff’s risk of the bad result, meaning that there is a 15/20\n\nchance, or 75 percent chance, that defendant’s alleged negligence was a cause in fact of\n\nthe bad result.10 Thus, plaintiff has presented evidence sufficient to support his allegation\n\n\n\n       9\n         For example, if a defendant’s negligence caused an increase in a plaintiff’s risk\nof a bad result from 10 percent to 15 percent, this would be a 50 percent increase in risk.\nBut it is not more probable than not that the defendant’s negligence was a cause in fact\nbecause the defendant would only have been responsible for five out of the total 15\npercentage points of the plaintiff’s risk of the bad result, meaning that there is only a 5/15\nchance, or an approximately 33 percent chance, that the negligence was a cause in fact of\nthe bad result. As I explain in footnote 3, however, the plaintiff could still pursue a loss-\nof-opportunity claim.\n       10\n          Although this formulation is mathematically identical to Justice MARKMAN’s\napproach, there are very important differences in how we view its utility. I favor\nadopting it because it is consistent with the more-probable-than-not standard in the first\nsentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) as applied to traditional medical malpractice claims in\nwhich the plaintiff had a risk of the bad result even absent negligence. In contrast, Justice\nMARKMAN believes it is required by the second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) and,\nunlike myself, believes that all medical malpractice claims in which there was a risk of\nthe bad result occurring even absent negligence should be treated as loss-of-opportunity\nclaims, regardless of whether the plaintiff can meet the burden of proof for a traditional\nmedical malpractice claim. As explained in my concurring opinion in Stone, I continue\nto think that Justice MARKMAN’s interpretation is inconsistent with the statute’s text and\n\n\n                                              6\n\fthat it is “more probable than not” that defendant’s negligence was a cause in fact of the\n\nstroke occurring.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, I concur with the lead opinion that the judgment of the\n\nCourt of Appeals should be reversed. I would remand the case to the Court of Appeals\n\nfor further proceedings.\n\n\n       KELLY, C.J., concurred with CAVANAGH, J.\n\n\n\n\nMichigan law, including Falcon.

I write separately to\n\nnote that by overruling the Court of Appeals’ decision in Fulton, we are not overruling\n\nprecedent from this Court. Justice YOUNG’s dissent, however, attempts to mislead the\n\npublic into thinking that this Court is overruling such precedent by introducing a\n\ndiscussion of stare decisis into this case.\n\n       Justice YOUNG’S dissent lists 12 cases that have been overruled by this Court in\n\nthe past 18 months. While Justice YOUNG may feel aggrieved by this Court overruling\n\nthose 12 cases, amongst those cases were some of the most egregious examples of\n\njudicial activism that did great harm to the people of Michigan. Those decisions were\n\nmade by the “majority of four,” including Justice YOUNG, under the guise of ideologies\n\nsuch as “textualism” and “judicial traditionalism.”\n\f       As I stated in my concurrence in Univ of Mich Regents v Titan Ins Co, ___ Mich\n\n___, ___ ; ___ NW2d ___ (2010), I agree with the sentiment recently expressed by Chief\n\nJustice Roberts of the United States Supreme Court in his concurrence to the decision in\n\nCitizens United v Fed Election Comm, 558 US ___, ___; 130 S Ct 876, 920; 175 L Ed 2d\n\n753, 806 (2010), when he said that\n\n       stare decisis is neither an “inexorable command,” Lawrence v. Texas, 539\n       U. S. 558, 577 [123 S Ct 2472; 156 L Ed 2d 508] (2003), nor “a mechanical\n       formula of adherence to the latest decision,” Helvering v.

He explained that\n\n“[i]ts greatest purpose is to serve a constitutional ideal—the rule of law.

Grandpa’s presence is undoubtedly a cause of\n       mortification to the host. But since only the most ill-bred of guests would\n       be coarse enough to comment on Grandpa’s presence and condition, all\n       concerned simply try ignore him.

However, I concur in the result reached by the\n\nmajority because plaintiff has raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether he\n\nsuffered a greater than 50 percent loss of an opportunity under MCL 600.2912a.\n\nTherefore, I agree with the majority that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be\n\nreversed and this case should be remanded to the Court of Appeals for it to consider\n\ndefendants’ remaining issue on appeal, i.e., the admissibility of the expert testimony\n\nproffered by plaintiff. However, I strongly disagree with the analysis of the majority and\n\nbelieve that it will lead to confusion and unnecessary litigation.\n\f                             I. STATUTE AND CASELAW\n\n       MCL 600.2912a(2) provides:\n\n               In an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff has the\n       burden of proving that he or she suffered an injury that more probably than\n       not was proximately caused by the negligence of the defendant or\n       defendants. In an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff cannot\n       recover for loss of an opportunity to survive or an opportunity to achieve a\n       better result unless the opportunity was greater than 50%.[1]\n\nIn Fulton v William Beaumont Hosp, 253 Mich App 70; 655 NW2d 569 (2002), the Court\n\nof Appeals held that a lost-opportunity plaintiff must prove that his loss was greater than\n\n50 percentage points.     That is, the difference between the plaintiff’s premalpractice\n\nchance to achieve a better result and the plaintiff’s postmalpractice chance to achieve a\n\nbetter result must be greater than 50 percentage points.2\n\n       In Stone v Williamson, 482 Mich 144; 753 NW2d 106 (2008), although all seven\n\njustices concluded that Fulton was wrongly decided, this Court could not overrule Fulton\n\nbecause, while four justices concluded that Fulton was a lost-opportunity case, six\n\njustices concluded that Stone was not a lost-opportunity case. See Stone, 482 Mich at\n\n164 n 14 (opinion by TAYLOR, C.J.) (“[B]ecause a majority of justices hold that this is\n\nnot a lost-opportunity case, the issue of the correctness of Fulton, cannot be reached, and\n\n\n       1\n         For a discussion of the common law that existed before the enactment of this\nstatutory provision, see my concurring opinion in Stone v Williamson, 482 Mich 144; 753\nNW2d 106 (2008) (MARKMAN, J., concurring).\n       2\n         As I did in Stone, I use the term “premalpractice chance” to refer to the plaintiff’s\nchance to survive or achieve a better result with proper treatment, and the term\n“postmalpractice chance” to refer to the plaintiff’s chance to survive or achieve a better\nresult without proper treatment.\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fFulton’s approach remains undisturbed as the method of analyzing lost-opportunity\n\ncases.”).3 In Stone, Chief Justice TAYLOR and Justices CORRIGAN and YOUNG concluded\n\nthat the loss-of-an-opportunity provision is “unenforceable.” Stone, 482 Mich at 147\n\n(opinion by TAYLOR, C.J.).       They concluded that if the plaintiff’s premalpractice\n\nopportunity to achieve a better result was greater than 50 percent, the plaintiff could bring\n\na traditional medical-malpractice action.     However, if the plaintiff’s premalpractice\n\nopportunity to achieve a better result was 50 percent or less, the plaintiff could not bring\n\na traditional medical-malpractice action or a lost-opportunity action because lost-\n\nopportunity actions are no longer allowed under the language of the statute.\n\n       Justices CAVANAGH, KELLY, and WEAVER concluded in Stone that if the\n\npercentage point difference between the plaintiff’s premalpractice opportunity to achieve\n\na better result and his postmalpractice opportunity to achieve a better result was greater\n\nthan 50 percentage points, the plaintiff could bring a traditional medical-malpractice\n\naction. However, if the percentage point difference was 50 points or less, the plaintiff\n\ncould only bring a lost-opportunity action and would have to prove that his\n\npremalpractice opportunity to achieve a better result was greater than 50 percent.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         Because a majority of justices now believes that neither Fulton nor the instant\ncase are lost-opportunity cases, Fulton is now apparently overruled at least with regard to\nthe determination concerning whether a case is a traditional medical-malpractice action\nor a lost-opportunity action. However, because a majority of the justices conclude that\nthe instant case is not a lost-opportunity case, Fulton’s method of analyzing lost-\nopportunity cases is unaffected by the decision in this case.\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\f       Finally, in Stone, I concluded that a lost-opportunity case is “one in which it is at\n\nleast possible that the bad outcome would have occurred even if the patient had received\n\nproper treatment.” Id. at 186 (MARKMAN, J., concurring).4 I further concluded that in\n\norder for a lost-opportunity plaintiff to prevail, he must prove that his lost opportunity\n\nwas greater than 50 percent. And,\n\n       [i]n order to determine whether the “lost opportunity” was greater than 50\n       percent, the postmalpractice chance of obtaining a better result must be\n       subtracted from the premalpractice chance, the postmalpractice chance\n       must then be subtracted from 100, the former number must be divided by\n       the latter number, and then this quotient must be multiplied by 100 to\n       obtain a percentage. [Id.]\n\n“If this percentage is greater than 50, the plaintiff may be able to prevail; if this\n\npercentage is 50 or less, then the plaintiff cannot prevail.” Id.\n\n                             II. PROBLEMS WITH FULTON\n\n       As I observed in Stone, the first problem with Fulton is that it requires a loss of\n\nmore than 50 percentage points, while MCL 600.2912a(2) requires a loss of more than 50\n\npercent.\n\n               The Court of Appeals in Fulton . . . concluded that because the\n       plaintiff’s premalpractice chance of survival was 85 percent and her\n       postmalpractice chance of survival was 60 percent to 65 percent, her “lost\n       opportunity” was 20 percent to 25 percent and, thus, because the plaintiff’s\n       “lost opportunity” was not greater than 50 percent, she could not recover\n       under MCL 600.2912a(2). However, Fulton did not offer any explanation\n       as to why it merely subtracted the postmalpractice chance from the\n       premalpractice chance to determine the “lost opportunity.” This might have\n\n       4\n        “By contrast, if there is no question that the proper treatment would have resulted\nin a good outcome, then the patient who has suffered a bad outcome has a traditional\nmedical-malpractice action.” Stone, 482 Mich at 186 (MARKMAN, J., concurring).\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f       been the correct method of determining the “lost opportunity” if MCL\n       600.2912a(2) required that such a loss be “greater than 50 percentage\n       points.” However, MCL 600.2912a(2) requires that the “lost opportunity”\n       be “greater than 50%.” There is a significant distinction between 50\n       percentage points and 50 percent. As Dr. Roy Waddell, a board-certified\n       orthopedic surgeon in Grand Rapids, has explained: “A decrease in survival\n       rate from 50 percent to 10 percent is a 40-percentage-point decrease, but it\n       is an 80 percent decrease.” Waddell, A doctor’s view of “opportunity to\n       survive”: Fulton’s assumptions and math are wrong, 86 Mich B J 32, 33\n       (March 2007) (emphasis in original). Similarly, a reduction in wages from\n       $5 an hour to $1 an hour is not a 4 percent reduction in wages; rather, it is\n       an 80 percent reduction in wages. [Id. at 196 (emphasis in the original).]\n\nAs I also observed in my concurring opinion in Stone, Justice CAVANAGH made this same\n\nmistake in his concurring opinion in Stone:\n\n              Like the Court of Appeals in Fulton, Justice CAVANAGH offers no\n       explanation as to why he repeatedly calculates the “lost opportunity” in\n       terms of the percentage points lost rather than the actual percentage lost\n       when MCL 600.2912a(2) clearly states that the “lost opportunity” must be\n       “greater than 50%,” not greater than 50 percentage points. These statistical\n       concepts are utterly distinct. [Id. at 196 n 11.]\n\nI am pleased that Justice CAVANAGH and the other justices who signed his opinion in\n\nStone (Chief Justice KELLY and Justice WEAVER) now apparently recognize this\n\nanalytical error, and that they now “repudiate” that position. Thus, a majority of the\n\njustices of this Court now agree that MCL 600.2912a(2) requires us to determine whether\n\nthe lost opportunity is “greater than 50%,” not whether the lost opportunity is greater than\n\n50 percentage points.\n\n       The other problem with Fulton, that Justice CAVANAGH and his colleagues in the\n\nmajority also now apparently recognize, is that “it does not differentiate between those\n\npatients who would have survived regardless of whether they received proper or improper\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\ftreatment and those patients who needed the proper treatment in order to survive.” Id. at\n\n197.5 As I observed in Stone:\n\n              Such a differentiation is necessary because only those in the latter\n       group have truly suffered a “lost opportunity” as a result of the improper\n       treatment. That is, if a patient would have survived regardless of whether\n       he received proper or improper treatment, the improper treatment cannot be\n       said to have caused him to lose an opportunity to survive. On the other\n       hand, if the patient would have survived only if he had received the proper\n       treatment, the improper treatment can be said to have caused him to lose an\n       opportunity to survive. MCL 600.2912a(2) requires us to determine\n       whether the patient more likely than not fell into the latter category rather\n       than the former category, because the statute only allows a plaintiff to\n       recover for a “loss of an opportunity” that was “greater than 50%” and that\n       was “caused by the negligence of the defendant . . . .” Dr. Waddell’s\n       calculation does just that:\n\n                   (Premalpractice chance) - (Postmalpractice chance)\n                             100-(Postmalpractice chance)\n\n       5\n          Although the majority describes their formula in considerably different terms\nthan I did in Stone, the same result is produced under either formula. That is, regardless\nof whether the formula is described as I do [(premalpractice chance of better result) -\n(postmalpractice chance of better result)]/[100 - (postmalpractice chance of better\nresult)], or, as the majority now does [(postmalpractice chance of worse result) -\n(premalpractice chance of worse result)]/[(postmalpractice chance of worse result)], the\nsame figure is obtained. Given Justice CAVANAGH’s forceful criticisms of my formula in\nStone, it is encouraging that we are now in agreement on this critical point. See, e.g.,\nStone, 482 Mich at 183-184 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting) (“the Waddell formula [which I\nadopted in Stone and to which I continue to adhere] is blatantly inconsistent with the\nlanguage of MCL 600.2912a(2)”; “[i]t is inconceivable that Justice MARKMAN can read\nthe [statute] and conclude that it should be translated into this formula”; “[t]he approach\ntaken by Justice MARKMAN and Dr. Waddell requires [the statute] to be rewritten”; “the\nWaddell approach leads to such anomalous results that it cannot possibly reflect the\nintention of the Legislature”). While Justice CAVANAGH is correct that he employs the\nformula to determine whether plaintiff’s cause of action is a traditional medical-\nmalpractice action or a lost-opportunity action, and I use it to determine whether plaintiff\nhas satisfied the greater-than-50-percent requirement, we agree nonetheless that the\nnumber produced by the formula represents the opportunity that the plaintiff lost as a\nresult of the defendant’s negligence.\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\fThe quotient resulting from this numerator and denominator is then\nmultiplied by 100 to obtain a percentage. This number must be “greater\nthan 50%” in order to satisfy the requirement of the second sentence of\nMCL 600.2912a(2). For instance, if the patient’s premalpractice chance to\nachieve a better result was 80 percent and, as a result of the defendant’s\nmalpractice, the patient’s postmalpractice chance is reduced to 20 percent,\nthe patient has suffered a 75 percent loss of an opportunity to survive.[6]\n\n        What the Waddell formula essentially does is test the sufficiency of\nthe expert testimony, which is typically presented in the form of two\nstatistics: the likelihood that a patient would have had a good outcome with\nproper treatment (the “[premalpractice chance]”) and the likelihood that a\npatient would have had a good outcome with negligent treatment (the\n“[postmalpractice chance]”). The Waddell formula allows a court analyzing\nthis data to determine whether the plaintiff, when the patient has\nexperienced a bad outcome, has created a question of material fact\nconcerning whether proper treatment more likely than not would have made\na difference. The formula does this by identifying the universe of patients\nwho would have had a bad outcome (the denominator) and the subset of\nthose patients who could have been favorably treated (the numerator).\n\n       It is easiest to start with the formula’s denominator. This\ndenominator consists of the universe of all patients who would have had a\nbad outcome, for whatever reason. This group includes two subsets of\npatients: those who would have had a bad outcome because they received\nnegligent treatment, and those who would have had a bad outcome despite\nreceiving proper treatment.        The formula identifies this group by\nsubtracting from 100 the percentage of patients who would have had a good\noutcome even without proper treatment; in other words, it subtracts the\n“[postmalpractice chance]” from 100. In this way, a court can take the\nexpert’s statistics and identify those patients who were not treated properly\nand who experienced a bad outcome. A patient who is the subject of a\nmedical-malpractice action is a member of this group. But we cannot\ndetermine whether the patient is a member of this group because he or she\nwas denied the proper treatment or because he or she would have suffered a\nbad outcome even with proper treatment.\n\n       One more calculation must then be made in order to answer the\ndispositive question posed by the statute: whether it is more likely than not\nthat the patient would have benefited from proper treatment or, put another\n\n6\n    [(80 - 20)/(100 -20)] x 100 = 75%.\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\fway, whether the “opportunity to survive or . . . to achieve a better result”\nwas “greater than 50%.” MCL 600.2912a(2). A court has to determine\nwhat percentage of those patients with a bad outcome (those patients in the\ndenominator) would have benefited from treatment. This brings us to the\nWaddell formula’s numerator. The numerator consists of those patients\nwho would have had a bad outcome only if they had been negligently\ntreated. It is calculated by subtracting the “[postmalpractice chance]” from\nthe “[premalpractice chance],” thus identifying those patients who required\ntreatment to avoid a bad outcome.\n\n        Once the numerator and denominator have been calculated,\ncomparison of these two numbers by their quotient allows a court to\nreasonably determine whether improper treatment more likely than not\nmade a difference in the patient’s outcome. If the number of patients who\nwould have had a bad outcome only if they had been negligently treated\n(the numerator) comprises more than half of the number of patients who\nwould have had a bad outcome overall (the denominator), then the plaintiff\nhas established that proper treatment more likely than not would have made\na difference. In other words, when this has been shown, the plaintiff has\ncreated a question of material fact concerning whether the “opportunity”--\nthe benefit that would have been realized by a group of patients from the\ntreatment that was not given to this specific patient-- was greater than 50\npercent. Such a plaintiff has presented adequate expert testimony to\nestablish a “lost opportunity” cause of action within the meaning of the\nstatute.\n\n      As Dr. Waddell has explained:\n\n       “[T]he intent of the law is to disallow damages unless it can be\nshown that proper treatment creates a better than even (“greater than\n50%”) chance of survival of the patients who would have died without\ntreatment. In other words, if appropriate treatment cannot save at least half\nof the patients who otherwise would have died, then you do not have\nsufficient evidence to show that the negligence made the difference in the\nadverse outcome (death). Conversely, if good treatment can save more\nthan half of the patients who otherwise would have died, then you have\nadequate evidence that the poor treatment or negligence was likely to blame\nfor the bad outcome. This is exactly what this definition of opportunity\nmeasures.” [Waddell, 86 Mich B J at 33 (emphasis in original).]\n\nMCL 600.2912a(2) only allows a plaintiff to recover for a “loss of an\nopportunity” that was “greater than 50%” and that was “caused by the\nnegligence of the defendant . . . .” Use of Dr. Waddell’s formula, which\ngenerates the actual percentage lost rather than the number of percentage\n\n\n                                     8\n\f       points lost, and excludes those who would have achieved a good result\n       regardless of the malpractice, best ensures, in my judgment, that these\n       statutory requirements are satisfied. That is, this calculation would impose\n       liability, in accordance with MCL 600.2912a(2), in those instances in\n       which the medical care received more likely than not affected whether the\n       patient survived. [Id. at 197-202.]\n\n                                    III. APPLICATION\n\n       In the instant case, plaintiff alleged that defendants failed to timely and properly\n\ntreat his acute chest syndrome, a serious complication of sickle-cell disease, and that, as a\n\nresult, he suffered a stroke. More specifically, plaintiff alleged that defendants should\n\nhave performed an exchange blood transfusion in which the patient’s abnormal blood is\n\ntaken out and replaced with normal blood, rather than a simple blood transfusion in\n\nwhich normal blood is simply added to the patient’s abnormal blood.7 Plaintiff’s expert\n\nwitness testified that there was a 10 to 20 percent chance of stroke without proper\n\ntreatment, but that with proper treatment there would have been only a 5 to 10 percent\n\nchance of stroke. In other words, with proper treatment plaintiff had a 90 to 95 or more\n\npercent chance of not suffering a stroke, and without proper treatment he had an 80 to 90\n\npercent chance of not suffering a stroke. That is, plaintiff’s premalpractice chance to\n\nachieve a better result was, at best, 95 percent, and his postmalpractice chance was, at\n\nworst, 80 percent.     Pursuant to the Waddell calculation, plaintiff lost a 75 percent\n\nopportunity to achieve a better result:\n\n\n       7\n        An exchange blood transfusion was not performed until after plaintiff suffered a\nstroke. As a result of the stroke, plaintiff suffers from partial paralysis of his left leg and\ncomplete loss of function of his left hand and arm.\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\f                          95 - 80 x 100 = 75%\n                         100 - 80\n\nTherefore, plaintiff has raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether he\n\nsuffered a greater than 50 percent loss of an opportunity under MCL 600.2912a(2). For\n\nthese reasons, I agree with the majority that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should\n\nbe reversed and this case should be remanded to the Court of Appeals for it to consider\n\ndefendants’ remaining issue on appeal, i.e., the admissibility of the expert witness\n\ntestimony proffered by plaintiff.\n\n                              IV. MAJORITY’S ANALYSIS\n\n       Although I agree with the majority that the Court of Appeals should be reversed, I\n\nstrongly disagree with its analysis.\n\n     A. LOST OPPORTUNITY VS. TRADITIONAL MEDICAL MALPRACTICE\n\n                 1. GREATER-THAN-50-PERCENT REQUIREMENT\n\n       On the one hand, the majority concludes that whether the plaintiff’s lost\n\nopportunity is greater than 50 percent determines whether the plaintiff’s action is a lost-\n\nopportunity action or a traditional medical-malpractice action. I find this conclusion to\n\nbe completely illogical. Either the defendant’s negligence has caused the plaintiff to\n\nsuffer the injury, or it has caused the plaintiff to suffer a loss of an opportunity to achieve\n\na better result-- the better result being not to suffer the injury. How substantial the\n\nplaintiff’s lost opportunity is determines whether he satisfies the “greater than 50%”\n\nrequirement of MCL 600.2912a(2), not whether the plaintiff’s action constitutes a lost-\n\nopportunity action in the first place. As I stated in Stone:\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\f              In order to satisfy traditional medical-malpractice action\n       requirements, there must be no question that the proper treatment would\n       have resulted in a good outcome (at least with regard to the specific injury\n       suffered by the patient), because if there is any chance that a patient who\n       received proper treatment might nevertheless have suffered the specific bad\n       outcome ultimately suffered by the patient, it cannot be proved that the\n       improper treatment caused the bad outcome. If there is any chance that the\n       proper treatment could have resulted in the bad outcome, the chances of a\n       good outcome with proper treatment and the chances of a good outcome\n       with improper treatment must be compared. That is, under those\n       circumstances, although the plaintiff cannot prove that the defendant’s\n       malpractice caused the bad outcome because the bad outcome might have\n       occurred even with proper treatment, the plaintiff may be able to prove that\n       the defendant’s malpractice increased the patient’s chances of obtaining a\n       bad outcome and, thus, caused him or her to suffer a “lost opportunity” to\n       achieve a better result. This is the only coherent concept of a “lost\n       opportunity” cause of action under MCL 600.2912a(2). [Stone, 482 Mich\n       at 271 (MARKMAN, J., concurring).]\n\nBecause it is possible that the bad outcome in this case, i.e., suffering a stroke, might\n\nhave occurred even if plaintiff had received proper treatment, the instant case constitutes\n\na lost-opportunity action.\n\n                             2. PLAINTIFF’S PLEADINGS\n\n       On the other hand, the lead opinion concludes that “the second sentence of\n\n§ 2912a(2) applies only to medical malpractice cases that plead loss of opportunity, and\n\nnot to those that plead traditional medical malpractice . . . .” That is, the lead opinion\n\nconcludes that whether the plaintiff’s action constitutes a lost-opportunity action or a\n\ntraditional medical-malpractice action is a function of whether the plaintiff has used the\n\nmagic words “lost opportunity” in his pleading. If he did not, the action is a traditional\n\nmedical-malpractice action and the plaintiff need not concern himself with satisfying the\n\ngreater-than-50-percent requirement of MCL 600.2912a(2). However, if the plaintiff did\n\n\n\n                                            11\n\fuse the words “lost opportunity” in his pleading, the action is a lost-opportunity action\n\nand the plaintiff must satisfy the greater-than-50-percent requirement of MCL\n\n600.2912a(2). Besides being utterly inconsistent with the majority’s own conclusion that\n\na lost opportunity greater than 50 percent determines whether the plaintiff’s action\n\nconstitutes a lost-opportunity action or a traditional medical-malpractice action, it is also\n\ninconsistent with the well-established principle that Michigan courts are “not bound by a\n\nparty’s choice of label for its action [because this would] put form over substance . . . .”\n\nSt. Paul Fire & Marine Ins Co v Littky, 60 Mich App 375, 378-379; 230 NW2d 440\n\n(1975). Instead, as we explained in Maiden v Rozwood, 461 Mich 109, 135; 597 NW2d\n\n817 (1999), “the gravamen of plaintiff's action is determined by considering the entire\n\nclaim.” (Emphasis added.)\n\n       Thus, just as whether a plaintiff labels an action as an ordinary negligence action\n\ndoes not control whether that action is, in fact, an ordinary negligence action or a\n\nmedical-malpractice action, see Bryant v Oakpointe Villa Nursing Ctr, Inc, 471 Mich\n\n411; 684 NW2d 864 (2004), whether a plaintiff labels an action as a traditional medical-\n\nmalpractice action or a lost-opportunity action cannot control whether the plaintiff’s\n\naction is, in fact, a traditional medical-malpractice action or a lost-opportunity action.\n\nThis established principle ensures that the governing law, and not the label the parties\n\nattach to that law, controls the outcome of an action. As the United States Supreme Court\n\nhas observed, any other approach would allow a party to avoid the requirements of a\n\nlegislative mandate simply by artful pleading. See Allis-Chalmers Corp v Lueck, 471 US\n\n202, 211; 105 S Ct 1904; 85 L Ed 2d 206 (1985). Yet this is exactly what the lead\n\n\n                                             12\n\fopinion would allow a plaintiff to do in relation to the requirements of MCL\n\n600.2912a(2).    Apparently, according to the justices joining the lead opinion, all a\n\nplaintiff need do to avoid the “greater than 50%” requirement in MCL 600.2912a(2) is to\n\nomit the words “lost opportunity” in his complaint. Thus, no artfulness is even required\n\nto nullify this particular statute under their theory.\n\n       Indeed, in light of the lead opinion, the discussions in the various opinions in this\n\ncase concerning appropriate formulas for determining loss of opportunity seem pointless.\n\nFor what plaintiff, and what competent plaintiff’s attorney, would ever plead a lost-\n\nopportunity claim if it could be so easily avoided? Simply put, under the lead opinion’s\n\nrule, would the lost-opportunity doctrine enacted by the Legislature even continue to\n\nexist as a viable legal doctrine in this state? Would a court have any power to apply the\n\nactual law, or would it be required to participate in a charade of the plaintiff’s (and the\n\nlead opinion’s) making? As an example, could a public official plaintiff avoid having to\n\nprove actual malice in a defamation case by simply leaving the words “public official”\n\nout of his pleading? Could a plaintiff suing a public entity entitled to governmental\n\nimmunity avoid such immunity by simply omitting that the defendant is a public entity\n\nfrom his pleading? Could an independent contractor transmute himself into an employee\n\nby simply asserting such in his pleading?\n\n            B. WHICHEVER FORMULA BEST SERVES THE PLAINTIFF\n\n       The lead opinion offers no explanation, and I can think of none, to support its\n\nalternative “standard percentage increase calculation” formula, other than the fact the\n\njustices signing the lead opinion believe that it somehow indicates that plaintiff has\n\n\n                                               13\n\fsuffered a 300 percent loss of an opportunity! However, none of this really seems to\n\nmatter to the justices signing the lead opinion because in the end they conclude that MCL\n\n600.2912a(2) does not require “any particular mathematical formula,” and that if “either\n\ncalculation,” or, indeed, some other yet-to-be-discovered calculation, demonstrates a\n\ngreater than 50 percent lost opportunity, the plaintiff’s case may proceed, because “the\n\nresults must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.” This is\n\nsimply nonsensical. Although it is true that evidence is to be viewed in a light most\n\nfavorable to the non-moving party, Dressel v Ameribank, 468 Mich 557, 561; 664 NW2d\n\n151 (2003), which, as in this case, will almost invariably be the plaintiff, this is the first I\n\nhave heard of a judicially created rule that we are to construe an unambiguous law in a\n\nlight most favorable to one side or the other. Needless to say, and for reasons that are\n\napparent, the lead opinion does not bother to cite any authority in support of such a rule.\n\nIs there some logical reason for this rule other than an apparent desire by the lead justices\n\nto place a finger on the scales of justice on behalf of the plaintiff class? Is this rule\n\nlimited to lost-opportunity cases or is it equally applicable to all medical-malpractice\n\nactions? Why is such a rule appropriate in a lost-opportunity case, but not in other realms\n\nof the civil law? When is such a default interpretation of the law warranted, and when is\n\nit not? If the law does not require “any particular formula,” why does the lead opinion\n\ndevote such attention to identifying the two formulas that it does identify? Why not just\n\ndevise a third formula under which the plaintiff will always prevail? Could it possibly be\n\n\n\n\n                                              14\n\fthat the lead justices may be confusing their own personal political philosophies with the\n\ndictates of the actual law that they pledged to uphold?8\n\n                                   V. CONCLUSION\n\n       As I summarized in Stone:\n\n              A “lost opportunity” action is one in which it is possible that the bad\n       outcome would have occurred even if the patient had received proper\n       treatment. On the other hand, if there is no question that the proper\n       treatment would have resulted in a good outcome and the patient has\n       suffered a bad outcome, the plaintiff possesses a traditional medical-\n       malpractice action. In order for a traditional medical-malpractice plaintiff\n       to prevail, the plaintiff must prove that the bad outcome was more probably\n       than not caused by the defendant’s malpractice. In order for a “lost\n       opportunity” plaintiff to prevail, the plaintiff must prove that the “lost\n       opportunity” to achieve a better result was more probably than not caused\n       by the defendant’s malpractice and that the “lost opportunity” was greater\n       than 50 percent. In order to determine whether the “lost opportunity” was\n       greater than 50 percent, the postmalpractice chance of obtaining a better\n       result must be subtracted from the premalpractice chance; the\n       postmalpractice chance must then be subtracted from 100; the former\n       number must be divided by the latter number; and then this quotient must\n       be multiplied by 100 to obtain a percentage. The calculation can be\n       summarized as follows:\n\n       8\n         The lead opinion indicates that the justices signing that opinion now support\n“Justice CAVANAGH’s dissent in Wickens [v Oakwood Healthcare Sys, 465 Mich 53; 631\nNW2d 686 (2001)] that a living person may pursue a claim for loss of opportunity under\nthe circumstances presented in that case.” What this gratuitous observation has to do\nwith the instant case, I have not a clue. Do the justices signing the lead opinion also\nsupport Justice CAVANAGH’s dissent in People v Gardner, 482 Mich 41; 753 NW2d 78\n(2008), or any one of his other random dissents? Given that three justices previously\nsupported Justices CAVANAGH’s dissent (Chief Justice KELLY, and Justices CAVANAGH\nand WEAVER), by indicating that she now supports Wickens, Justice HATHAWAY seems\nto be signaling that there is now majority support in favor of such dissent. Unfortunately,\nthis type of behavior seems to have become the new majority’s modus operandi--\nunnecessarily sowing uncertainty, doubt and confusion into the law by gratuitously\nquestioning prior cases decided by the former majority. For more discussion on this, see\nmy dissent in McCormick v Carrier, __ Mich __; __ NW2d __ (2010).\n\n\n\n                                            15\n\f                    (Premalpractice chance) - (Postmalpractice chance)\n                             100 - (Postmalpractice chance)\n\n       If this percentage is greater than 50, the plaintiff may be able to prevail; if\n       this percentage is 50 or less, then the plaintiff cannot prevail. [Stone, 482\n       Mich at 218-219 (MARKMAN, J., concurring).][9]\n\n       As discussed earlier, because it is possible that the bad outcome in this case, i.e.,\n\nsuffering a stroke, would have occurred even if plaintiff had received proper treatment,\n\nthe instant case is, in fact, a lost-opportunity action, and because plaintiff has raised a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact regarding whether he suffered a greater than 50 percent loss\n\nof an opportunity under MCL 600.2912a, I agree with the majority that the judgment of\n\nthe Court of Appeals should be reversed and this case should be remanded to the Court of\n\nAppeals for it to consider defendants’ remaining issue on appeal, i.e., the admissibility of\n\nthe expert witness testimony proffered by plaintiff.\n\n       However, I emphatically disagree with the majority’s incoherent analysis and the\n\nimplications of such analysis. The majority effectively transforms a lost-opportunity\n\naction into a traditional medical-malpractice action, for no other apparent reason than to\n\nafford plaintiffs with larger potential recoveries. Instead of limiting a plaintiff’s recovery\n\n\n       9\n         However, the present status of the law seems to be, pursuant to the lead opinion\nand Justice CAVANAGH’s concurring opinion, that if the plaintiff’s lost opportunity is\ngreater than 50 percent (the calculation of which is anyone’s guess in view of the\ndifferent tests of these two opinions), the plaintiff can bring a traditional medical-\nmalpractice action, but, if the plaintiff’s lost opportunity is not greater than 50 percent,\nthen the plaintiff can only bring a lost-opportunity action. And, pursuant to Fulton, a\nlost-opportunity plaintiff must prove that the difference between his premalpractice\nchance of achieving a better result and his postmalpractice chance of achieving a better\nresult is greater than 50 percentage points. Neither of these conclusions is, to say the\nleast, consistent with my own reading of the statute.\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\fto the opportunity that he or she may have lost as a result of the defendant’s negligence,\n\nthe majority now expands the plaintiff’s recovery to include potentially all damages\n\nrelated to his medical condition, even though the plaintiff may well have suffered the\n\ncondition even had he received perfect medical treatment.          Thus, having already\n\nundermined the Legislature’s attempt at medical-malpractice reform, see e.g., Bush v\n\nShabahang, 484 Mich 156; 772 NW2d 272 (2009); Potter v McLeary, 484 Mich 397; 774\n\nNW2d 1 (2009); and ADM File No. 2009-13, 485 Mich __, __ (order entered February\n\n16, 2010), the majority now embarks upon transforming medical-malpractice law in\n\nexactly the opposite direction of that sought by the Legislature. At the same time, the\n\ndiffering formulas, and non-formulas, adopted by the majority, as well as the internal\n\ninconsistencies in its analysis, will only produce more confusion in an already confused\n\narea of the law, and more litigation in an already heavily litigated area of the law.

(dissenting).\n\n      Our new Chief Justice established the “agenda” for the newly reconstituted Court\n\nin her recent comments captured by the press:\n\n            We the new majority [Chief Justice KELLY and Justices\n      CAVANAGH, WEAVER, and HATHAWAY] will get the ship off the shoals\n      and back on course, and we will undo a great deal of the damage that\n      the Republican-dominated court has done. Not only will we not neglect\n      our duties, we will not sleep on the bench.[1]\n\n\n\n\n      1\n         She Said, Detroit Free Press, December 10, 2008, p 2A. Chief Justice KELLY\nobjects that I “continue to quote and misleadingly characterize a statement [she] made\nnearly two years ago off the bench.” Ante at ___ (KELLY, C.J., concurring). As my\ndissenting opinion in Univ of Michigan Regents v Titan Ins Co, ___ Mich ___; ___\nNW2d ___ (2010) (YOUNG, J., dissenting), explains at length, my characterization of her\nstatement is not misleading. Chief Justice KELLY’s remarks both set an agenda for\nundoing the precedents of the previous 10 years and are especially mean-spirited in light\nof the political attacks against former Chief Justice TAYLOR during the 2008 campaign.\n\fThere are many cases this term that can be said to exemplify the new majority's\n\ncommitment to “undo . . . the damage” of the prior majority, but this case certainly\n\nqualifies as a first among equals. Here, not only do my colleagues in the “new majority”\n\ndestroy the doctrinal integrity of medical malpractice law, they do so in highly fractured\n\nopinions that will require a Venn diagram for the bench and bar to construct the points at\n\nwhich four of them agree on any governing principle of law. The new majority has thus\n\nmade it more difficult to determine what it has done today. Perhaps this is intended.\n\n        Chaos and confusion in the law only promote more litigation. The decisions the\n\nnew majority has issued today in this case will thus benefit only those who profit from\n\nlitigating medical malpractice cases. The rest of us desire to know what legal rules\n\ncontrol our rights and obligations, and we desire and deserve to know them before we\n\nact. The citizens of this state are entitled to that kind of clarity in the decisions from the\n\nstate’s senior court, not the disorder this Court has sown today. Today’s decision returns\n\nthis Court to an era in which the bench and bar must decipher this Court’s split opinions\n\nin order to figure out what principles of law they collectively articulate.2 It is no small\n\nchallenge to respond in dissent to the various opinions that shred our medical malpractice\n\nlaws.\n\n\n\n\n        2\n        See, e.g., Smith v Dep’t of Pub Health, 428 Mich 540; 410 NW2d 749 (1987), for\na model case in the same chaotic vein as today’s split decisions. It exemplifies the era to\nwhich this Court returns in this case.\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f      Despite the Legislature’s codification of the traditional obligation to prove that\n\nalleged malpractice “more probably than not” caused a plaintiff’s injury,3 20 years ago, in\n\nFalcon v Mem Hosp, this Court waded into the realm of policy-making and judicially\n\ncreated the lost opportunity doctrine as an exception to the traditional and statutorily\n\ncodified causation standard of proof.4 Even after the Legislature subsequently recognized\n\nthe lost opportunity doctrine,5 it also expressly retained the traditional requirement that\n\n“[i]n an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff has the burden of proving that\n\nhe or she suffered an injury that more probably than not was proximately caused by the\n\nnegligence of the defendant or defendants.”6\n\n      Until today, this Court has always made clear that when a traditional medical\n\nmalpractice claim was at issue, the more-probable-than-not standard of causation applied\n\nand required the plaintiff to “‘exclude other reasonable hypotheses with a fair amount of\n\ncertainty.’”7 However, as the Court did in Falcon, today the majority makes a radical\n\ntransformation of medical malpractice law and again jettisons traditional causation\n\ndoctrine by equating causation of the injury with risk of the injury. But, unlike in\n\nFalcon, the new majority here does not recognize merely an exception to the traditional\n\n      3\n          1977 PA 272.\n      4\n          Falcon v Mem Hosp, 436 Mich 443; 462 NW2d 44 (1990).\n      5\n          See MCL 600.2912a, as amended by 1993 PA 78.\n      6\n          MCL 600.2912a(2).\n      7\n        Skinner v Square D Co, 445 Mich 153, 166; 516 NW2d 475 (1994) (citation\nomitted).\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\fmalpractice requirement of “but for” causation, it essentially eliminates the traditional\n\nrule entirely by importing that exception into all malpractice cases. In declaring this case\n\nto be a “traditional” medical malpractice claim, the new majority applies the relaxed\n\ncausation rules that previously had applied only to lost opportunity claims. After today,\n\ntherefore, all malpractice claims will be treated under relaxed causation principles\n\npreviously applied only to lost opportunity claims. This is a tectonic shift in our law, for\n\nwhich there is no basis but the preference of the justices in the new majority to foster\n\nmore legal chaos that will promote litigation in this area of the law. This shift is\n\nsignificant because a traditional medical malpractice injury creates liability for the entire\n\ninjury, while a lost opportunity claim creates liability only for that portion of the\n\nincreased risk of injury attributable to a defendant.8 Make no mistake: Although Justice\n\nCAVANAGH feigns that he is unaware of the significant change in the law being made in\n\nthis case, the reduced burden of persuasion and the broader scope of damages permitted\n\nis the reason the new majority now applies lost opportunity causation principles to all\n\nmedical malpractice claims.9\n\n       Rather than attempting to give meaning to the words of the statute at issue in this\n\ncase, the new majority performs a spectacularly hubristic feat in treating a statutory\n\n       8\n        See Falcon, 436 Mich at 471 (opinion by LEVIN, J.) (“In this case, 37.5 percent\ntimes the damages recoverable for wrongful death would be an appropriate measure of\ndamages.”).\n       9\n        See n 52 of this opinion for further elaboration on the significance of Justice\nCAVANAGH’s repudiation of the position he took just two years ago in Stone v\nWilliamson, 482 Mich 144, 175-177; 753 NW2d 106 (2008) (opinion by CAVANAGH, J.).\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\fmedical malpractice claim as though it were a mere matter of common law and thus\n\nsubject to its revisionary powers. What is more, these justices have decided to use those\n\nextraconstitutional powers to circumvent the Legislature’s explicit decision to retain\n\ntraditional causation rules. The new majority has chosen “free form” to change the law to\n\nmatch its policy preference that no legal doctrines shall exist to eliminate any claim of\n\nmedical malpractice—even those doctrines codified by our Legislature to accomplish this\n\nvery goal.\n\n       For someone who campaigned on the theme that more of this Court’s precedent\n\nshould be preserved,10 we are surprised at how eagerly Justice HATHAWAY has striven in\n\nthis case to overturn precedent—even to the extent of offering her own new views that\n\nprecedent is not a serious barrier to any change desired by the new majority.11\n\n       The dicta in Justice HATHAWAY’s opinion bears out her newfound position on\n\nstare decisis because her opinion purports to opine on “the full scope and extent of loss-\n\nof-opportunity claims,”12 even while denying that such a claim is involved in this case.\n\nIn doing so, Justice HATHAWAY engages in a completely gratuitous assault on this\n       10\n          Berg, Hathaway attacks, Michigan Lawyers Weekly, October 27, 2008\n(“‘People need to know what the law is,’ Hathaway said. ‘I believe in stare decisis.\nSomething must be drastically wrong for the court to overrule.’”); Lawyers’ election\nguide: Judge Diane Marie Hathaway, Michigan Lawyers Weekly, October 30, 2006\n(quoting Justice HATHAWAY, then running for a position on the Court of Appeals, as\nsaying that “[t]oo many appellate decisions are being decided by judicial activists who\nare overturning precedent”).\n       11\n        See, e.g., Univ of Mich Regents v Titan Ins Co, ___ Mich ___, ___; ___ NW2d\n___ (2010) (HATHAWAY, J., concurring).\n       12\n            Ante at ___ (opinion by HATHAWAY, J.).\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\fCourt’s decision in Wickens v Oakwood Healthcare Sys.13 Wickens involved a claim for\n\nthe lost opportunity to survive, and it was brought by a living plaintiff—someone who\n\nhad not yet lost her opportunity to survive. No justice even contends that plaintiff in this\n\ncase has asserted a claim for the lost opportunity to survive, and therefore it is completely\n\nunnecessary for Justice HATHAWAY to opine on whether the majority or dissent correctly\n\ninterpreted the question whether a living plaintiff could recover for the loss of an\n\nopportunity to survive.\n\n       Ordinarily, this fact would hinder any justice from engaging in a discussion on the\n\nscope of a claim for the lost opportunity to survive that is not implicated in the case\n\nbefore the Court. Justice HATHAWAY, though, is not constrained to consider only the\n\nlegal issues she claims are involved here because, consistent with the new majority’s\n\n“agenda,”14 she has a desire to overrule in one fell swoop as many cases decided by the\n\n“Republican-dominated court” as she can. Unfazed by the inconvenient fact that Wickens\n\nis irrelevant to any question posed by this case, Justice HATHAWAY’s opinion observes\n\nthat it “agree[s] with Justice CAVANAGH’S partial dissent in Wickens . . . .”15 Such dicta\n\ndo not yet operate to overturn this Court’s decision in Wickens. Nevertheless, given that\n\nJustice HATHAWAY is now the fourth sitting justice on this Court to support the partial\n\n\n\n\n       13\n            Wickens v Oakwood Healthcare Sys, 465 Mich 53; 631 NW2d 686 (2001).\n       14\n            See the text accompanying n 1 of this opinion.\n       15\n            Ante at ___ (opinion by HATHAWAY, J.).\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\fdissenting opinion in Wickens, it is safe to conclude that the majority opinion in Wickens\n\nhas, more probably than not, lost a substantial part of its opportunity to survive.16\n\n       Finally, the new majority overrules the Court of Appeals decision in Fulton v\n\nWilliam Beaumont Hosp to the extent it is inconsistent with their opinions.17 However,\n\nagain, the new majority overreaches; Fulton applies only to lost opportunity cases, not to\n\ntraditional medical malpractice cases, and the new majority’s decision to convert claims\n\npreviously considered lost opportunity claims into traditional medical malpractice claims\n\nserves to eliminate the application of Fulton. The new majority’s deliberate decision to\n\nrepudiate Fulton in this expansive manner, provides further support for my claim that it\n\nnow applies lost opportunity principles to all medical malpractice claims.\n\n       For these reasons and more, I vigorously dissent. I believe that the new majority\n\nhas intentionally mischaracterized this as a “traditional” medical malpractice claim\n\nbecause plaintiff’s expert testimony unquestionably established that the alleged\n\nmalpractice was not the “but for” cause of plaintiff’s injury. Were the new majority’s\n\ncharacterization of this case as a traditional medical malpractice claim accurate, I would\n\naffirm for failure of proofs. However, because I believe this to be a lost opportunity case,\n\n\n       16\n         One could read this dicta in Justice HATHAWAY’s opinion as a signal that the\nnew majority will overrule Wickens. However, the majority has already so signaled in its\norder granting leave to appeal in Edry v Adelman, 485 Mich 901 (2009). Edry was\ndecided on narrow evidentiary grounds, Edry v Adelman, 486 Mich ___; ___ NW2d ___\n(2010), but, as Justice HATHAWAY’s decision in this case exemplifies, its decision was\ndecidedly not a reaffirmation of the continued vitality of Wickens.\n       17\n            Fulton v William Beaumont Hosp, 253 Mich App 70; 655 NW2d 569 (2002).\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fI would vacate as improvidently granted our September 30, 2009, order granting leave to\n\nappeal.     I continue to adhere to the position stated in the lead opinion in Stone v\n\nWilliamson that the second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) codifying the lost opportunity\n\nremedy is unenforceable as enacted.18 Because the Legislature has not clarified the\n\nintention of its 1993 amendment of § 2912a(2), vacating the grant order is the most\n\nappropriate course of action.\n\n                          I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       Because none of the opinions that collectively create a majority elaborates on the\n\nfacts necessary to decide this case, I present the following complete recitation of the\n\npertinent facts and procedural history of this case.\n\n       Plaintiff, Raymond O’Neal, suffers from sickle cell anemia, a genetic condition\n\nthat produces an increased amount of abnormally shaped red blood cells in his\n\nbloodstream.19 In January 2003, plaintiff’s progressively worsening chest pain developed\n\ninto acute chest syndrome (ACS), a known complication of sickle cell anemia.20 To treat\n\nACS, a patient must undergo blood transfusions to reduce the amount of abnormal red\n\nblood cells.       The difference between and effectiveness of two types of blood\n\ntransfusions—standard transfusions and exchange transfusions—is at issue in this case.\n\nStandard transfusions add healthy red blood cells to the patient’s existing blood supply\n       18\n            Stone, 482 Mich at 144 (opinion by TAYLOR, C.J.).\n       19\n        Beers & Berkow, eds, The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy (17th ed)\n(Whitehouse Station, NJ: Merck & Co, Inc, 1999), pp 877-878.\n       20\n            Id. at 879.\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\fand thereby reduce the patient’s percentage of abnormal red blood cells. Exchange\n\ntransfusions are more complicated, but they also more aggressively treat the blood\n\nabnormality because they physically remove existing abnormal red blood cells and\n\nreplace them with healthy red blood cells.\n\n       On January 23 through 24, 2003, plaintiff received a standard transfusion of three\n\nunits of blood cells. He received two additional units of blood cells in another standard\n\ntransfusion on January 28, 2003. Plaintiff suffered a stroke on the right side of his brain\n\non February 1, 2003. Plaintiff received a third transfusion—an exchange transfusion—on\n\nFebruary 2 through 3, 2003. Plaintiff’s condition stabilized after this final transfusion,\n\nbut he alleged permanent injury as a result of the stroke, including partial paralysis of his\n\nleft leg and loss of function of his left hand and arm.\n\n       Plaintiff filed the instant medical malpractice complaint, alleging that defendants\n\nfailed to comply with the appropriate standard of care, which required them to “arrange\n\nfor exchange transfusions” to treat plaintiff’s ACS on or before January 28, 2003. He\n\nalso alleged that “[p]erformance of [an] exchange transfusion prior to the . . . stroke\n\nwould have prevented the stroke from occurring.”\n\n       Plaintiff retained and deposed three expert witnesses to testify on his behalf on the\n\nissue of causation. Dr. John Luce, a pulmonary care specialist, testified that reducing\n\nplaintiff’s abnormal hemoglobin count to under 30 percent would have made it “probable\n\nthat he would not have” suffered the stroke, although he acknowledged that plaintiff still\n\ncould have suffered the stroke even with such a reduced abnormal hemoglobin count.\n\nBecause no data existed on the frequency of strokes in adult sickle cell patients, Dr.\n\n\n                                              9\n\fRichard Stein, a hematologist, extrapolated from existing data on the effects of aggressive\n\ntransfusion therapy on children with sickle cell disease. He testified that “more likely\n\nthan not” plaintiff would have avoided a stroke if he had received aggressive transfusion\n\ntherapy, what plaintiff alleged is the appropriate standard of care. Dr. Griffin Rodgers,\n\nalso a hematologist, provided the most detailed testimony regarding the causal\n\nrelationships between the stroke, plaintiff’s underlying medical condition, and\n\ndefendants’ alleged malpractice. He explained that sickle cell patients generally have a\n\nbaseline risk of stroke that is significantly higher than the average population. Moreover,\n\nplaintiff’s ACS further increased his baseline risk of stroke to between 10 and 20 percent.\n\nDr. Rodgers testified that, with aggressive transfusion therapy, the plaintiff’s risk of\n\nstroke would have “been cut in half,” that is, to between 5 and 10 percent. Stated\n\notherwise, plaintiff’s opportunity to avoid a stroke would have been between 90 and 95\n\npercent with aggressive transfusion therapy, but it was reduced to between 80 and 90\n\npercent without aggressive transfusion therapy. Thus, under either treatment regime,\n\nplaintiff’s experts testified that it was more likely than not that plaintiff would avoid a\n\nstroke.\n\n          Defendants moved for summary disposition, arguing that Dr. Rodgers’s testimony\n\nregarding plaintiff’s lost opportunity to avoid a stroke failed to satisfy the requirement of\n\nMCL 600.2912a(2)21 and Fulton v William Beaumont Hosp,22 that the opportunity to\n\n          21\n         MCL 600.2912a(2) provides, in pertinent part: “In an action alleging medical\nmalpractice, the plaintiff cannot recover for loss of an opportunity to survive or an\nopportunity to achieve a better result unless the opportunity was greater than 50%.”\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\fachieve a better result must decrease by more than 50 percentage points. The trial court\n\ndenied defendants’ motion, noting that defendants “[didn’t] have a clue about what\n\n[Fulton] says.”\n\n       After the Court of Appeals denied defendants’ interlocutory application for leave\n\nto appeal, in lieu of granting leave to appeal, we remanded this case to the Court of\n\nAppeals for consideration as on leave granted.23 On remand, the Court of Appeals\n\nreversed the trial court’s denial of summary disposition in an unpublished opinion per\n\ncuriam.24 The majority opinion held that plaintiff’s claim was a lost opportunity claim,\n\nthat Fulton required the loss of opportunity to be greater than 50 percentage points, and\n\nthat the loss of opportunity here was, at most, 15 percentage points. The concurring\n\nopinion concluded that plaintiff also failed to present sufficient evidence of proximate\n\ncausation because his “preexisting medical condition” precluded him from satisfying “his\n\nburden of establishing the existence of a genuine factual dispute concerning whether\n\ndefendants’ alleged professional negligence ‘more probably tha[n] not’ proximately\n\ncaused his stroke.”25\n\n       We granted leave to appeal and directed the parties to brief:\n\n\n\n       22\n            Fulton v William Beaumont Hosp, 253 Mich App 70; 655 NW2d 569 (2002).\n       23\n            O’Neal v St John Hosp & Med Ctr, 477 Mich 1087 (2007).\n       24\n        O’Neal v St John Hosp & Med Ctr, unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court\nof Appeals, issued November 4, 2008 (Docket Nos. 277317 and 277318).\n       25\n            Id. at 2 (JANSEN, J., concurring).\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\f             (1) whether the requirements set forth in the second sentence of\n      MCL 600.2912a(2) apply in this case; (2) if not, whether the plaintiff\n      presented sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of fact with regard to\n      whether the defendants’ conduct proximately caused his injury; or (3) if so,\n      whether Fulton v William Beaumont Hosp, 253 Mich App 70 (2002), was\n      correctly decided, or whether a different approach is required to correctly\n      implement the second sentence of § 2912a(2).[26]\n\n                              II. LEGAL BACKGROUND\n\n      The lead opinion in Stone aptly summarized the pertinent legal background\n\nrelevant to this case, including the distinction between traditional malpractice claims and\n\nlost opportunity claims that the majority now eviscerates:\n\n             In the first Michigan case to refer to the legal theory of “the value of\n      lost chance,” the Court of Appeals explained: “This theory is potentially\n      available in situations where a plaintiff cannot prove that a defendant’s\n      actions were the cause of his injuries, but can prove that the defendant’s\n      actions deprived him of a chance to avoid those injuries.” Vitale v Reddy,\n      150 Mich App 492, 502; 389 NW2d 456 (1986). The Court in Vitale noted\n      that allowing such claims would expand existing common law, and it\n      declined to do so, stating that such a decision “is best left to either the\n      Supreme Court or the Legislature.” Id. at 504. . . .\n\n              In accord with this analysis, this Court has stated: “The lost\n      opportunity doctrine allows a plaintiff to recover when the defendant’s\n      negligence possibly, i.e., [by] a probability of fifty percent or less, caused\n      the plaintiff’s injury.” Weymers v Khera, 454 Mich 639, 648; 563 NW2d\n      647 (1997) (emphasis added). The Weymers Court aptly described the lost-\n      opportunity doctrine as “the antithesis of proximate cause.” Id. In cases in\n      which the plaintiff alleges that the defendant’s negligence more probably\n      than not caused the injury, the claim is one of simple medical malpractice.\n      Id. at 647-648.\n\n             In Falcon v Mem Hosp, 436 Mich 443; 462 NW2d 44 (1990), this\n      Court first recognized a claim for lost opportunity to survive. Falcon was a\n      wrongful-death case in which this Court allowed a claim to go forward\n\n      26\n           O’Neal v St John Hosp & Med Ctr, 485 Mich 901 (2009).\n\n\n\n                                            12\n\feven though the plaintiff’s granddaughter would have had only a 37.5\npercent chance of surviving a medical accident had she received proper\ncare. Because proper medical procedures had not been followed, the\ngranddaughter’s chance of surviving the accident went to essentially zero.\nThe lead opinion in Falcon admitted that the plaintiff could not show that\nthe malpractice had more likely than not caused her granddaughter’s death,\nbut could show that it had caused her granddaughter to lose a “substantial\nopportunity of avoiding physical harm.” Id. at 470 (LEVIN, J.). The lead\nopinion disavowed the traditional rule that requires a plaintiff to show that,\nbut for the defendant’s negligence, the patient would not have suffered the\nphysical harm, saying that the “more probable than not standard, as well as\nother standards of causation, are analytic devices—tools to be used in\nmaking causation judgments.” Id. at 451. Instead, despite the fact that the\nplaintiff could not show that the doctor’s malpractice had more probably\nthan not caused her granddaughter’s death, the plaintiff had a claim because\nthe malpractice did cause her granddaughter harm. The 37.5 percent\nchance for a better outcome was “hardly the kind of opportunity that any of\nus would willingly allow our health care providers to ignore.” Id. at 460.\nThis harm occurred before the granddaughter’s death, at the moment\n“[w]hen, by reason of the failure to implement [certain] procedures,” she\nwas denied any opportunity of living. Id. at 469, 471 n 44. The lead\nopinion characterized its holding as requiring the plaintiff to show, more\nprobably than not, that the malpractice reduced the opportunity of avoiding\nharm: “failure to protect [the granddaughter’s] opportunity of living.” Id. at\n469. Loss of her 37.5 percent opportunity of living, the lead opinion stated,\n“constitutes a loss of a substantial opportunity of avoiding physical harm.”\nId. at 470.\n\n        The lead opinion in Falcon thus concluded that the loss-of-\nopportunity claim accrued not when the patient died, but at the moment she\nwent from having a 37.5 [percent] chance of survival to having no chance\nof survival. Under this theory, a plaintiff would have a cause of action\nindependent of that for the physical injury and could recover for the\nmalpractice that caused the plaintiff to go from a class of patients having a\n“good chance” to one having a “bad chance.” Without this analysis, the\nplaintiff in Falcon would not have had a viable claim because it could not\nhave been shown that the defendant more probably than not caused the\nphysical injury. Until Falcon, medical-malpractice plaintiffs alleging that\nthe defendant’s act or omission hastened or worsened the injury (such as by\nfailing to diagnose a condition) had to prove that the defendant’s\nmalpractice more probably than not was the proximate cause of the injury.\nSee, e.g., Morgan v Taylor, 434 Mich 180; 451 NW2d 852 (1990);\n\n\n\n                                     13\n\fNaccarato v Grob, 384 Mich 248, 252; 180 NW2d 788 (1970); Skeffington\nv Bradley, 366 Mich 552; 115 NW2d 303 (1962).\n\n       When the Court decided Falcon, MCL 600.2912a read:\n\n       “In an action alleging malpractice the plaintiff shall have the burden\nof proving that in light of the state of the art existing at the time of the\nalleged malpractice:\n\n        “(a) The defendant, if a general practitioner, failed to provide the\nplaintiff the recognized standard of acceptable professional practice in the\ncommunity in which the defendant practices or in a similar community, and\nthat as a proximate result of the defendant failing to provide that standard,\nthe plaintiff suffered an injury.\n\n        “(b) The defendant, if a specialist, failed to provide the recognized\nstandard of care within that specialty as reasonably applied in light of the\nfacilities available in the community or other facilities reasonably available\nunder the circumstances, and as a proximate result of the defendant failing\nto provide that standard, the plaintiff suffered an injury.”\n\n        Three years after Falcon, the Legislature enacted 1993 PA 78,\namending MCL 600.2912a to add the second subsection. In its entirety, the\nstatute as amended reads:\n\n        “(1) Subject to subsection (2), in an action alleging malpractice, the\nplaintiff has the burden of proving that in light of the state of the art\nexisting at the time of the alleged malpractice:\n\n        “(a) The defendant, if a general practitioner, failed to provide the\nplaintiff the recognized standard of acceptable professional practice or care\nin the community in which the defendant practices or in a similar\ncommunity, and that as a proximate result of the defendant failing to\nprovide that standard, the plaintiff suffered an injury.\n\n        “(b) The defendant, if a specialist, failed to provide the recognized\nstandard of practice or care within that specialty as reasonably applied in\nlight of the facilities available in the community or other facilities\nreasonably available under the circumstances, and as a proximate result of\nthe defendant failing to provide that standard, the plaintiff suffered an\ninjury.\n\n\n\n\n                                     14\n\f             “(2) In an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff has the\n      burden of proving that he or she suffered an injury that more probably than\n      not was proximately caused by the negligence of the defendant or\n      defendants. In an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff cannot\n      recover for loss of an opportunity to survive or an opportunity to achieve a\n      better result unless the opportunity was greater than 50%.” [New language\n      emphasized.]\n\n             As can be seen, the Legislature retained the already-existing\n      language, making it subsection 1 of the statute. Both subsection 1(a) and\n      subsection 1(b) require the plaintiff to show that, “as a proximate result of\n      the defendant failing to provide [the appropriate standard of practice or\n      care], the plaintiff suffered an injury.” Further, the Legislature added\n      subsection 2. Specifically, the first sentence of this new subsection codifies\n      and reiterates the common-law requirement that a plaintiff show that the\n      defendant’s malpractice more probably than not caused the plaintiff’s\n      injury. The second sentence of subsection 2 adds that, in medical-\n      malpractice cases, a “plaintiff cannot recover for loss of an opportunity to\n      survive or an opportunity to achieve a better result unless the opportunity\n      was greater than 50%.” However, one must keep in mind that the relevant\n      caselaw when subsection 2 was enacted held that the lost-opportunity\n      doctrine applies “in situations where a plaintiff cannot prove that a\n      defendant’s actions were the cause of his injuries . . . .” Vitale, [150 Mich\n      App] at 502 (emphasis added). That is, the first sentence of subsection 2\n      requires plaintiffs in every medical-malpractice case to show the\n      defendant’s malpractice proximately caused the injury while, at the same\n      time, the second sentence refers to cases in which such proof not only is\n      unnecessary, but is impossible.[27]\n\n      Thus, in contrast with traditional malpractice claims, the very nature of the lost\n\nopportunity doctrine allows a plaintiff to recover in the absence of proximate causation\n\nbetween the alleged malpractice and the physical injury suffered. The lead opinion in\n\nStone determined that “the two sentences of subsection 2 create a paradox, allowing\n\n\n\n\n      27\n           Stone, 482 Mich at 152-157 (opinion by TAYLOR, C.J.).\n\n\n\n                                           15\n\fclaims in the second sentence while precluding them by the first sentence.”28 In this case,\n\nJustice HATHAWAY’s opinion and Justice CAVANAGH’s concurring opinion altogether\n\navoid the implications of this paradox by essentially applying the lost opportunity\n\nanalysis (which never required “but for” causation) to a traditional medical malpractice\n\nclaim that, until today, always required “but for” causation. In doing so, the new\n\nmajority radically alters proximate causation doctrine by casting aside the traditional\n\ncomponent of “but for” causation and by replacing causation of the injury with\n\nconsideration only of the increased risk of the injury. This is a revolutionary change in\n\nour law and represents a change that not even the Falcon Court dared to make.\n\n       A necessary component of proximate causation is “but for” causation, or causation\n\nin fact.29 As this Court has previously held:\n\n              As a matter of logic, a court must find that the defendant’s\n       negligence was a cause in fact of the plaintiff’s injuries before it can hold\n       that the defendant’s negligence was the proximate or legal cause of those\n       injuries.\n\n              Generally, an act or omission is a cause in fact of an injury only if\n       the injury could not have occurred without (or “but for”) that act or\n       omission. While a plaintiff need not prove that an act or omission was the\n       sole catalyst for his injuries, he must introduce evidence permitting the jury\n       to conclude that the act or omission was a cause.\n\n             It is important to bear in mind that a plaintiff cannot satisfy this\n       burden by showing only that the defendant may have caused his injuries.\n       Our case law requires more than a mere possibility or a plausible\n\n       28\n            Id. at 157.\n       29\n        Weymers v Khera, 454 Mich 639, 647; 563 NW2d 647 (1997), citing Skinner,\n445 Mich at 162-163.\n\n\n\n                                            16\n\f      explanation. Rather, a plaintiff establishes that the defendant’s conduct was\n      a cause in fact of his injuries only if he “set[s] forth specific facts that\n      would support a reasonable inference of a logical sequence of cause and\n      effect.”[30]\n\n      As Justice CAVANAGH has himself previously concluded, plaintiffs must present\n\nevidence of proximate causation that “‘must exclude other reasonable hypotheses with a\n\nfair amount of certainty.’”31 By allowing plaintiff’s claim to proceed as a traditional\n\nmedical malpractice claim, the new majority today eviscerates the distinction between the\n\nweaker causation allowed in lost opportunity claims and the “but for” causation that has\n\nalways been required in traditional medical malpractice claims.\n\n                                   III. APPLICATION\n\n          A. PLAINTIFF ASSERTED A LOST OPPORTUNITY CLAIM\n       BECAUSE THERE IS NO “BUT FOR” CAUSATION BETWEEN THE\n      ALLEGED MALPRACTICE AND THE PHYSICAL INJURY SUFFERED.\n\n      As stated, the crux of a lost opportunity claim is that a plaintiff cannot show that,\n\nmore probably than not, the alleged malpractice proximately caused his injuries. This is\n\nbecause a plaintiff need only show that the alleged malpractice merely reduced his\n\nopportunity to achieve a better result. Accordingly, whether a claim is a traditional\n\nmalpractice claim or a claim for the loss of an opportunity to achieve a better result\n\ndepends on whether the alleged malpractice proximately caused the alleged injury.\n\n\n\n\n      30\n          Craig v Oakwood Hosp, 471 Mich 67, 87; 684 NW2d 296 (2004), quoting\nSkinner, 445 Mich at 174.\n      31\n           Skinner, 445 Mich at 166 (CAVANAGH, C.J.) (citation omitted).\n\n\n\n                                            17\n\f       Contrary to the new majority’s position, this case presents a prototypical lost\n\nopportunity claim because no proximate causation exists between the alleged malpractice\n\nand plaintiff’s physical injury. Plaintiff’s experts testified that plaintiff’s underlying\n\nmedical condition—sickle cell anemia complicated by ACS—increased his risk of stroke\n\nabove that of a healthy person and even above that of a sickle cell patient who has not\n\ndeveloped ACS. Plaintiff’s underlying medical condition created a heightened chance of\n\nsuffering a stroke, with or without the alleged malpractice. As Dr. Rogers, who provided\n\nthe most detail of plaintiff’s causation experts, testified, plaintiff would have had a 5 to\n\n10 percent chance of suffering a stroke even if he had been treated according to the\n\nplaintiff’s proposed standard of care.\n\n       The evidence here, therefore, does not “‘exclude other reasonable hypotheses\n\n[of the cause of injury] with a fair amount of certainty,’”32 as is required to prove “but\n\nfor” causation in a traditional medical malpractice action. Plaintiff’s expert testified that,\n\nin the absence of the alleged medical malpractice, plaintiff had between a 90 percent and\n\n95 percent chance of avoiding a stroke.         The alleged medical malpractice reduced\n\nplaintiff’s chance of avoiding a stroke to between 80 percent and 90 percent. Even\n\nlooking at the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, there is no basis for a\n\nfact-finder to conclude that defendants’ actions more probably than not caused plaintiff’s\n\ninjury. But this is unimportant because the new majority now only requires causation for\n\nthe increased risk of injury.\n\n       32\n            Id. (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n                                             18\n\f         Simply stated, the plaintiff has not asserted, and neither Justice HATHAWAY’s\n\nopinion nor Justice CAVANAGH’s concurring opinion assert—that the alleged medical\n\nmalpractice increased his chance of suffering a stroke by the more than 50 percentage\n\npoints required to prove proximate causation.33 This fact irrefutably establishes that\n\nthe plaintiff asserts a lost opportunity claim, not a traditional medical malpractice\n\nclaim.\n\n B. THE CONCLUSION THAT PLAINTIFF HAS ASSERTED A TRADITIONAL\nMEDICAL MALPRACTICE CLAIM AND HAS SATISFIED THE REQUIREMENTS\n     OF “BUT FOR” CAUSATION IS A DANGEROUS DEPARTURE FROM\n              TRADITIONAL CAUSATION REQUIREMENTS.\n\n         As stated, in determining that plaintiff’s claim is a traditional medical malpractice\n\nclaim, the new majority today applies relaxed causation rules that previously had applied\n\nonly to lost opportunity claims—claims involving an increased risk of injury that did not\n\nrise to the level of proximate causation. These relaxed rules are inconsistent with the\n\nposition that three of the justices of the new majority have taken previously on what\n\nevidence is required for a plaintiff to prove a traditional medical malpractice claim.34\n\nSuch claims have always required “but for” causation. After today’s shift, therefore, all\n\n\n         33\n         See Falcon v Mem Hosp, 436 Mich 443, 450; 462 NW2d 44 (1990) (opinion by\nLEVIN, J.) (characterizing the traditional approach to “but for” causation as “measured as\nmore than fifty percent” and concluding that a 37.5 percentage point reduction in the\nopportunity for surviving could not prove “but for” causation). Thus no one, not even\nthose in the Falcon decision who created an exception, has ever required less than a\n“more than 50 percentage point” change in order to establish a traditional medical\nmalpractice claim. Just two years ago, Justices CAVANAGH, WEAVER, and KELLY\nreaffirmed this position. See Stone, 482 Mich at 175-177 (opinion by CAVANAGH, J.).\n         34\n              See id.\n\n\n\n                                              19\n\fmalpractice claims will be established using principles that could only have applied to\n\nlost opportunity claims. Few can miss how significant a departure this is from all of this\n\nCourt’s medical malpractice jurisprudence that preceded this case.\n\n  1. THREE JUSTICES TODAY REPUDIATE THE TRADITIONAL CAUSATION\n       PRINCIPLES THAT THEY REAFFIRMED JUST TWO YEARS AGO.\n\n       The new majority appears to be of the view that the less said about its radical\n\nrewriting of this statute the better.    When a judge is “doing” policy rather than\n\ninterpreting the law, it is apparently not required to maintain a consistent position or\n\nexplain a fundamental change in position. Certainly, such disclosures are probably not\n\ndesired by jurists whose positions are undergoing radical “revision.” I commend the\n\nreader to compare the positions taken today by Chief Justice KELLY and Justices\n\nCAVANAGH and WEAVER with those taken just two years ago in Stone.35 These three\n\njustices now repudiate the traditional proximate cause requirements that they previously\n\nrecognized and applied at that time.\n\n       In Stone, Justice CAVANAGH, writing for himself and Justices KELLY and\n\nWEAVER, held that a traditional medical malpractice action required “but for” causation.\n\nHe specifically posed a hypothetical example in which a plaintiff’s opportunity to achieve\n\na better result was reduced by 40 percentage points, from 80 percent to 40 percent. Thus,\n\nthis hypothetical plaintiff’s risk of suffering a bad result increased from 20 percent to 60\n\npercent as a result of the alleged medical malpractice. According to Justice CAVANAGH\n\n       35\n         See id. Justice CAVANAGH at least has the forthrightness to indicate that he\ntoday repudiates this position. Ante at ___ (CAVANAGH, J., concurring).\n\n\n\n                                            20\n\fjust two years ago, this hypothetical plaintiff “could not meet the more-probably-than-not\n\nstandard of causation . . . .”36 Today these same three justices declare that a much\n\nsmaller reduction in the opportunity to achieve a better result—from 90 to 95 percent to\n\n80 to 90 percent—now satisfies the causation standard of a traditional malpractice case.\n\nThis is not a product of the rule of law. This is a naked display of judicial whimsy and\n\naggressive policy-making.\n\n   2. JUSTICE HATHAWAY’S OPINION MISREADS CASELAW TO REDEFINE\n       PROXIMATE CAUSE AND TO DO AWAY WITH THE TRADITIONAL\n   REQUIREMENT THAT A PLAINTIFF PROVE A “BUT FOR” CAUSE UNDER\n               THE MORE-PROBABLE-THAN-NOT STANDARD\n\n       Justice HATHAWAY’s opinion places much emphasis on the fact that our caselaw\n\nindicates that “a plaintiff need not prove that an act or omission was the sole catalyst for\n\nhis injuries,”37 in recognition that any given injury may have more than one proximate\n\ncause. It then uses this fact of logic and causation to create a false distinction that\n\nradically refashions proximate causation and negates the traditional requirement—as\n\npreviously articulated even by Justice CAVANAGH—that proof of “but for” causation\n\nmust “exclude other reasonable hypotheses with a fair amount of certainty.”38\n\n       The proposition that any injury may have more than one proximate cause is an\n\nunremarkable one for anyone who understands the principles of “but for” causation. An\n\n\n       36\n            Stone, 482 Mich at 177 (opinion by CAVANAGH, J.).\n       37\n            Craig, 471 Mich at 87.\n       38\n            Skinner, 445 Mich at 166 (emphasis added; quotation marks and citation\nomitted).\n\n\n\n                                            21\n\finjury that involves a series of individual occurrences before it is manifested will have\n\nmultiple “but for” causes. However, in such a case, each of these causes must be\n\nproved to have produced the injury under the more-probable-than-not standard, not\n\nmerely proved to have increased the risk of injury, as this case does.\n\n       One of this Court’s cases on traditional causation, Brackins v Olympia, Inc,\n\nillustrates this point.39 The plaintiff, a roller skating instructor, fell while roller skating at\n\nthe defendant’s rink. He alleged that another skater had clipped his right skate and that,\n\n“as a result his skates became locked with his right foot and skate behind his left skate.”40\n\nFurthermore, the plaintiff claimed that he could not have prevented the fall “because his\n\nleft skate struck a ridge or inequality in the floor of the rink . . . .”41 The defendant rink\n\nowner sought summary disposition because it claimed that the proximate cause of the\n\nplaintiff’s injury was the other skater clipping the plaintiff’s skate, not the flaw in the rink\n\nsurface. To be sure, the other skater’s action was a “but for” cause of the plaintiff’s\n\ninjury, as the injury would not have occurred without it. However, this Court concluded\n\nthat the skating rink surface was also a proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injury:\n\n               Defendant is not absolved from liability for its negligence because of\n       the act of the other skater . . . . The proofs support the conclusion . . . that\n       plaintiff fell because of the roughness of, or the inequality in, the floor of\n       the skating rink. Defendant’s negligence, if not the sole proximate cause of\n       the accident, was, in any event, a proximate cause.[42]\n       39\n            Brackins v Olympia, Inc, 316 Mich 275; 25 NW2d 197 (1946).\n       40\n            Id. at 277.\n       41\n            Id.\n       42\n            Id. at 283 (emphasis added).\n\n\n                                               22\n\fEach of the “but for” causes in Brackins could be proved with near certainty.\n\nAccordingly, the Brackins Court concluded that both “but for” causes more probably than\n\nnot directly caused the plaintiff’s injury, and therefore it affirmed the jury’s award of\n\ndamages to the plaintiff against the defendant. Nevertheless, in recognizing that an\n\ninjury may have more than one “but for” cause, this Court has always, until now,\n\nrequired the traditional burden of proving that each particular “but for” cause more\n\nprobably than not produced the injury.43\n\n       The dual “but for” causes in Brackins are very different from the situation in the\n\ninstant case. Here, all that plaintiff can show is that defendants’ alleged malpractice\n\nexacerbated plaintiff’s preexisting sickle cell anemia to the extent of increasing his risk of\n\n\n       43\n           Justice HATHAWAY claims that this position “would allow recourse for the\nnegligent actions of medical providers only in those instances in which one provider’s\nconduct is at issue and only when no preexisting medical condition exists.” Ante at ___\n(opinion by HATHAWAY, J.). This is patently false. First, as stated, there can be multiple\n“but for” causes for a particular injury, including the negligent conduct of multiple\nmedical providers. Each of these hypothetical negligent acts, however, must themselves\nbe “but for” causes, like the chain reaction of events that caused the roller skating injury\nin Brackins. Second, a medical provider’s negligence may, more probably than not, be a\n“but for” cause of an injury even when the plaintiff has a preexisting condition. This was\nthe very situation that this Court encountered in Stone. The plaintiff in Stone alleged that\na timely diagnosis of an aortic aneurysm would have given him a 95 percent chance of\nattaining a good result. Instead, his aneurysm ruptured, requiring emergency surgery and\nultimately amputation of his legs. According to the plaintiff’s experts, “misdiagnosed\npatients whose aneurysms rupture have only a 10 percent chance to achieve a good\nresult.” Stone, 482 Mich at 148 (opinion by TAYLOR, C.J.). Thus, even though the\nplaintiff had a preexisting medical condition, the defendants’ misconduct increased the\nplaintiff’s probability of suffering a bad result from 5 percent to 90 percent. This\nincrease of 85 percentage points provided a sufficient factual basis to defeat the\ndefendant’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.\n\n\n\n                                             23\n\fsuffering a stroke by between 5 and 10 percentage points. Plaintiff has simply not proved\n\nthat the alleged malpractice caused his stroke, nor has he “exclude[d]” the “other\n\nreasonable hypothes[i]s”—his preexisting sickle cell anemia—“with a fair amount of\n\ncertainty.”44 Thus, plaintiff’s preexisting sickle cell anemia could well have operated to\n\ninjure him even in the absence of defendants’ alleged malpractice.\n\n   3. JUSTICE HATHAWAY’S AND JUSTICE CAVANAGH’S OPINIONS TAKE\n    INAPPROPRIATE LIBERTIES WITH PLAINTIFF’S EXPERT STATISTICAL\n           EVIDENCE BY FAILING TO COMPARE LIKE WITH LIKE\n\n       Even in applying their radical new approach to proximate causation, the justices in\n\nthe new majority only reach their desired result by manipulating the expert’s statistical\n\nevidence in ways inconsistent with the expert’s own use of the statistical evidence and,\n\nsimilarly, in ways inconsistent with the uncontroversial and essential principle of\n\nstatistical methodology of comparing “like with like.” The new majority’s inappropriate\n\nuse of the statistical evidence presented in this case provides further proof that it is\n\nengaging in result-driven jurisprudence. Only this motivation could support such a\n\nmathematically illiterate presentation.\n\n       Justice HATHAWAY’s opinion declares, under the guise of requiring “results [to] be\n\nviewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,”45 that any mishmash of\n\nfigures that yields a result of greater than 50 percent will establish proximate causation\n\nbetween the alleged malpractice and plaintiff’s injury sufficient to defeat summary\n\n       44\n            Skinner, 445 Mich at 166 (quotation marks and citation omitted).\n       45\n            Ante at ___ (opinion by HATHAWAY, J.).\n\n\n\n                                             24\n\fdisposition. Thus, while Justice HATHAWAY’s opinion expressly declines to adopt any\n\nparticular mathematical formula for determining whether proximate cause exists in a\n\ngiven case, it essentially adopts every formula that an attorney or judge can manufacture.\n\nThis is not a serious analysis—“statistical” or otherwise. Justice HATHAWAY’s opinion is\n\nsimply an invitation for the artful manipulation of probability figures and calls to mind\n\nthe adage Mark Twain once attributed to Benjamin Disraeli, that there are “three kinds of\n\nlies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.”46\n\n       Two of the formulas that Justice HATHAWAY’s opinion identifies by name bear\n\ncloser analysis. Her opinion indicates that the evidence in this case can be “viewed as a\n\nstandard percentage increase calculation. . . .”47       The flaw in using this “standard\n\npercentage increase calculation” in a traditional medical malpractice case is obvious.\n\nSuch a calculation would turn the facts of Falcon—a case in which no justice\n\nbelieved that the plaintiff could prove “but for” causation using a more-probable-\n\nthan-not standard48—into a traditional medical malpractice case.\n\n\n\n       46\n         Twain, My Autobiography: “Chapters” from the North American Review\n(Mineola, NY: Dover Publications, Inc, 1999), p 208.\n       47\n            Ante at ___ (opinion by HATHAWAY, J.).\n       48\n           Falcon, 436 Mich at 460 (opinion by LEVIN, J.) (“[I]t cannot be said, more\nprobably than not, that [defendant] caused [plaintiff’s] death.”); id. at 472-473 (BOYLE,\nJ., concurring) (“I concur in the recognition of ‘lost opportunity to survive’ as injury for\nwhich tort law should allow recovery in proportion to the extent of the lost chance of\nsurvival . . . provided that the negligence of the defendant more probably than not caused\nthe loss of opportunity.”); id. at 473 (RILEY, C.J., dissenting) (“[I]t is uncontested that the\nplaintiff cannot show that defendant’s negligence caused the decedent’s death . . . .”).\n\n\n\n                                              25\n\f       In Falcon, the plaintiff’s decedent, Nena Falcon, suffered an amniotic fluid\n\nembolism, “an unpreventable complication” of childbirth.49 A woman who suffers this\n\ncomplication has a 62.5 percent probability of dying, even if it is treated immediately.\n\nBecause of alleged malpractice, however, Nena Falcon’s amniotic fluid embolism was\n\nnot treated immediately. This alleged malpractice increased her chance of death to 100\n\npercent.50     Under the “standard percentage increase calculation” used by Justice\n\nHATHAWAY to support her radical departure from requiring traditional proximate\n\ncausation in this case, the defendant’s alleged malpractice in Falcon was responsible for\n\nincreasing Nena Falcon’s chance of dying by 37.5 percentage points over the preexisting\n\n62.5 percentage point chance of dying. This represents a 60 percent increase in her\n\nchance of dying (37.5/62.5), and satisfies Justice HATHAWAY’s conclusion that any\n\nformula that reaches the magic number of more than 50 percent is satisfactory. Justice\n\nHATHAWAY’s opinion has, therefore, taken a judicially created aberration of proximate\n\ncausation, Falcon, and applied it so that she can satisfy the proximate cause component\n\nof a traditional medical malpractice claim. Fortunately, Justice HATHAWAY’s opinion is\n\nthe only opinion that adopts this approach, so this “standard percentage increase\n\ncalculation” does not, therefore, have support from a majority of this Court.\n\n       However, a second approach used by Justice HATHAWAY that I wish to discuss\n\ndoes appear to have the support from a majority of this Court—what Justice HATHAWAY\n\n       49\n            Falcon, 436 Mich at 454 (opinion by LEVIN, J.).\n       50\n            Id. at 454 n 16.\n\n\n\n                                             26\n\fcalls the “standard percentage decrease calculation.”51 This approach takes the pre- and\n\npostmalpractice probabilities of suffering the injury and calculates what proportion of the\n\npostmalpractice probability of injury is attributable to the malpractice. The percentage\n\napproach is found nowhere in this Court’s proximate cause jurisprudence, yet both\n\nJustice HATHAWAY’s opinion and Justice CAVANAGH’s concurring opinion apply it to\n\nconclude that plaintiff has made the requisite showing of probable cause to defeat\n\ndefendant’s motion for summary disposition.\n\n      As stated, three of the justices who support this approach do so in opposition to\n\ntheir previously stated positions.52 Moreover, Justice HATHAWAY’s opinion and Justice\n\n\n\n      51\n           Ante at ___ (opinion by HATHAWAY, J.).\n      52\n          Under the hypothetical example Justice CAVANAGH posed in Stone, a plaintiff\nwhose risk of suffering a bad result increases from 20 percent to 60 percent is unable to\nprove causation under the more-probable-than-not standard. This is because the\nplaintiff’s risk has not increased by the more than 50 percentage points traditionally\nrequired to prove “but for” causation. Justice CAVANAGH applies a very different\napproach today, and, under that approach, his hypothetical Stone plaintiff would be able\nto prove causation. Whatever innocence Justice CAVANAGH now feigns in treating both\nthat hypothetical case and the instant case as traditional medical malpractice cases, he is\nunequivocally converting what used to be a lost opportunity case into a traditional\nmedical malpractice case.\n\n        A plaintiff who has a preexisting medical condition is only able to prove “but for”\ncausation when the alleged malpractice increases the plaintiff’s risk of suffering a “bad\nresult” by more than 50 percentage points. Otherwise, there is no way to exclude, as\nJustice CAVANAGH (and this Court) has previously required, all “other reasonable\nhypotheses with a fair amount of certainty.” Skinner, 445 Mich at 166 (quotation marks\nand citation omitted). The approach adopted by the opinions of Justices HATHAWAY and\nCAVANAGH negates this basic requirement of proximate cause and would allow a\nplaintiff to recover for a bad result even in situations in which other, nonmalpractice\n“causes” for the result predominated in creating it.\n\n\n\n                                            27\n\fCAVANAGH’s concurring opinion apply the new standard in an especially troubling\n\nfashion. It is a truism in statistical methodology that one marshaling statistical evidence\n\nto support causation must apply the principle of ceteris paribus by “comparing like with\n\nlike.”53 The new majority violates this basic principle of statistical analysis to reach its\n\ndesired result. The expert testimony indicated that plaintiff’s chance of suffering a stroke\n\nwould have been reduced from the range of 10 to 20 percent to the range of 5 to 10\n\npercent if plaintiff had been treated according to the asserted standard of care.            In\n\n\n       The new majority’s approach would allow a plaintiff to recover in full from a\ndoctor who, for example, failed to diagnose cancer at its earliest stages, but still\ndiagnosed it at a stage where it was much more probable than not that a patient would\nsurvive. To put figures on this situation, suppose a plaintiff's risk of dying from cancer is\n1 percent if it is caught at its earliest stages. A doctor who fails to catch the cancer at that\nstage, but who catches it and treats it at a stage where the risk of dying from cancer is 3\npercent, then, is liable, under the new majority’s new approach, for the entire injury,\nshould one occur, because the failure to diagnose contributed to 2/3 of the risk of injury.\nThis is true, according to the new majority, even though the doctor only decreased the\npatient's chance of surviving by 2 percentage points, from 99 percent to 97 percent.\n\n        By shifting many lost opportunity claims into traditional medical malpractice\nclaims, the new majority creates additional liability of a defendant for the entire injury,\nnot just for the increased risk of injury, as lost opportunity claims provide. See Falcon,\n436 Mich at 471 (opinion by LEVIN, J.) (“In this case, 37.5 percent times the damages\nrecoverable for wrongful death would be an appropriate measure of damages.”). This\nshift in determining a defendant’s liability is essential to understanding what the new\nmajority is trying to accomplish in this case. Now plaintiffs need only prove that a\ndoctor’s negligence contributed to the risk of injury, not that his negligence actually\ncaused the injury. And no amount of pretended ignorance about the significance of these\nchanges by members of the new majority alters their fundamental and radical impact on\nthis area of the law.\n       53\n          See Lewis-Beck, Bryman, & Liao, eds, 1 The SAGE Encyclopedia of Social\nScience Research Methods (Thousand Oaks, Cal: SAGE Publications, Inc, 2004), p 117\n(“Ceteris paribus . . . refers to the process of comparing like with like when asserting a\ncausal relationship or the effect of one variable on another.”).\n\n\n\n                                              28\n\fclarifying these statistical ranges, the expert concluded that plaintiff’s likelihood of\n\nsuffering a stroke would have been “cut in half” under the standard of care urged by\n\nplaintiff. In other words, the upper end of the range of plaintiff’s likelihood of suffering a\n\nstroke was “cut in half,” from 20 percent to 10 percent, and the lower end of that range\n\nwas also “cut in half,” from 10 percent to 5 percent. Rather than comparing like with\n\nlike—the lower end of each range or the upper end of each range—a majority of this\n\nCourt fallaciously compares the lower end of one range (5 percent) with the upper end of\n\nthe other (20 percent). They do so in order to conclude that the alleged malpractice\n\ncaused 75 percent of plaintiff’s chance of suffering a stroke (15/20).54 This failure to\n\n“compare like with like” is a patent error of statistical analysis, but it gets the majority\n\nwhere it needs to go to support its conclusion that plaintiff has established “but for”\n\ncause.\n\n         Finally, Justice HATHAWAY’s opinion concludes that “plaintiff established a\n\nquestion of fact on the issue of proximate causation because plaintiff’s experts opined\n\nthat defendants’ negligence more probably than not was the proximate cause of the\n\nplaintiff’s injuries.”55 This statement might have had more relevance if it had been\n\n\n         54\n          The new majority calculates that defendants’ alleged malpractice caused an\nincrease in plaintiff’s risk of suffering a stroke by 15 percentage points (5 percent risk\nwithout malpractice subtracted from 20 percent risk with malpractice). They then divide\nthat figure by plaintiff’s 20 percent risk of a stroke with malpractice to conclude that the\nalleged malpractice caused 75 percent of plaintiff’s chance of suffering a stroke. See\nante at ___ (opinion by HATHAWAY, J.); ante at ___ (CAVANAGH, J., concurring).\n         55\n              Ante at ___ (opinion by HATHAWAY, J.).\n\n\n\n                                              29\n\fsupported by the experts’ actual statistical evidence of plaintiff’s chances of suffering the\n\nstroke. However, as discussed above, plaintiff’s experts were unable to show proximate\n\ncausation between the alleged malpractice and plaintiff’s stroke. All they were able to\n\nshow was a connection between the alleged malpractice and plaintiff’s increased\n\nlikelihood of suffering a stroke, from between 5 to 10 percent to between 10 to 20\n\npercent. Justice HATHAWAY’s analysis, such as it is, allows an expert to say certain\n\n“magic words” about proximate causation, while presenting statistical evidence to the\n\ncontrary.\n\n       As stated, this case is a prototypical lost opportunity case because plaintiff cannot\n\nestablish that, more probably than not, defendants proximately caused his stroke because\n\nhe was predisposed to suffer one, his risk being in the range of 5 to 10 percent, even with\n\nmedical care that satisfied plaintiff’s proposed standard of care.          Accordingly, I\n\nvigorously dissent from the conclusion of a majority of this Court that plaintiff asserted a\n\ntraditional medical malpractice claim and would instead conclude that plaintiff asserted a\n\nlost opportunity claim.\n\n         C. MCL 600.2912a(2) IS (STILL) UNENFORCEABLE AS ENACTED\n\n       Because the new majority concludes that plaintiff’s claim is a traditional medical\n\nmalpractice claim, it does not need to reach the question whether plaintiff’s claim meets\n\nthe requirements of the second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2), which applies only to lost\n\nopportunity claims. The decision of the new majority to treat this case as a traditional\n\nmedical malpractice claim, of course, obviates the need for interpreting the second\n\nsentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) because the new majority essentially treats all medical\n\n\n                                             30\n\fmalpractice claims under the weakened Falcon causation standard heretofore applicable\n\nonly to lost opportunity claims. Therefore, the decision of the new majority to overrule\n\nthe Court of Appeals decision in Fulton, to the extent Fulton drew a line between lost\n\nopportunity cases and traditional medical malpractice cases, also does away with Fulton’s\n\napplication of the sentence in § 2912a(2) that applies to lost opportunity cases. Fulton\n\nonly applies to lost opportunity cases. By concluding that the instant case sounds in\n\ntraditional medical malpractice, the new majority essentially writes the decision in Fulton\n\nout of existence. Thus, its expansive decision in this case is characteristic of the new\n\nmajority that overreaches in its decisions in order to achieve its own preferred policy\n\noutcomes.56\n\n\n      56\n          Although the “new majority” has only been in existence 18 months, it has an\nimpressive record of overturning cases consistent with the Chief Justice’s promise to\n“undo . . . the damage that the Republican-dominated court has done.” She Said, Detroit\nFree Press, December 10, 2008, p 2A.\n\n        By my count, the new majority has now overturned this term 12 cases in addition\nto the one that it overturns today:\n\n       1. In People v Feezel, 486 Mich 184; 783 NW2d 67 (2010), the new majority\noverruled People v Derror, 475 Mich 316; 715 NW2d 822 (2006).\n\n       2.

See Pollard v Suburban\nMobility Auth for Regional Transp, 486 Mich 963, 963-965 (2010) (YOUNG, J.,\ndissenting statement). As in three other cases decided this term, Justice WEAVER repeats\nher tired and unsuccessful attempt to defend her changing position on stare decisis. Ante\nat ___ (WEAVER, J., concurring). See also Univ of Mich Regents, ___ Mich at ___\n(WEAVER, J., concurring); Lansing Sch Ed Ass’n, ___ Mich at ___ (WEAVER, J.,\nconcurring); McCormick, ___ Mich at ___ (WEAVER, J., concurring). Her position does\nnot become any more convincing with repetition. My dissenting opinion in Univ of Mich\nRegents, ___ Mich at ___ (YOUNG, J., dissenting), explains in full why Justice WEAVER’s\nposition is merely an attempt to justify stark judicial policy-making.\n\n\n\n                                           32\n\f      The Legislature added subsection (2) to MCL 600.2912a shortly after the Falcon\n\nCourt created the new claim for loss of an opportunity to survive. The new subsection\n\nprovides:\n\n              In an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff has the\n      burden of proving that he or she suffered an injury that more probably than\n      not was proximately caused by the negligence of the defendant or\n      defendants. In an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff cannot\n      recover for loss of an opportunity to survive or an opportunity to achieve a\n      better result unless the opportunity was greater than 50%.[57]\n\n      As the lead opinion in Stone aptly observed, there are multiple problems in\n\ndetermining whether the requirements of MCL 600.2912a(2) apply in any particular case.\n\nAs stated above, the two sentences are internally inconsistent and, therefore, create a\n\nparadox:\n\n              [T]he first sentence of this new subsection codifies and reiterates the\n      common-law requirement that a plaintiff show that the defendant’s\n      malpractice more probably than not caused the plaintiff’s injury. The\n      second sentence of subsection 2 adds that, in medical-malpractice cases, a\n      “plaintiff cannot recover for loss of an opportunity to survive or an\n      opportunity to achieve a better result unless the opportunity was greater\n      than 50%.” However, one must keep in mind that the relevant caselaw\n      when subsection 2 was enacted held that the lost-opportunity doctrine\n      applies “in situations where a plaintiff cannot prove that a defendant’s\n      actions were the cause of his injuries . . . .” Vitale, [150 Mich App] at 502\n      (emphasis added). That is, the first sentence of subsection 2 requires\n      plaintiffs in every medical-malpractice case to show the defendant’s\n      malpractice proximately caused the injury while, at the same time, the\n      second sentence refers to cases in which such proof not only is\n      unnecessary, but is impossible.[58]\n\n\n      57\n           MCL 600.2912a(2).\n      58\n           Stone, 482 Mich at 156-157 (opinion by TAYLOR, C.J.).\n\n\n\n                                            33\n\f      Even ignoring the internal inconsistency, the second sentence of subsection (2) is\n\nincomprehensible as written. Subsequent to the amendment, the split Court of Appeals\n\npanel in Fulton offered two contradictory interpretations of the second sentence, neither\n\nof which was consistent with the text of that sentence as enacted. The Fulton majority\n\ndetermined that “MCL 600.2912a(2) requires a plaintiff to show that the loss of the\n\nopportunity to survive or achieve a better result exceeds fifty percent.”59 As the lead\n\nopinion in Stone indicated, this interpretation “improperly adds to the statute the words\n\n‘loss of,’ effectively replacing the word ‘opportunity’ where it is used the second time\n\nwith the phrase ‘loss of opportunity.’”60 Thus, the Fulton majority essentially rewrote the\n\nsecond sentence of § 2912a(2) to include the following bracketed words: “In an action\n\nalleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff cannot recover for loss of an opportunity to\n\nsurvive or an opportunity to achieve a better result unless the [loss of] opportunity was\n\ngreater than 50%.”\n\n      The dissenting judge in Fulton did not fare any better. His interpretation of MCL\n\n600.2912a(2) required a plaintiff “‘to show that, had the defendant not been negligent,\n\nthere was a greater than fifty percent chance of survival or a better result.’”61 This\n\n\n      59\n           Fulton, 253 Mich App at 83.\n      60\n           Stone, 482 Mich at 159 n 9 (opinion by TAYLOR, C.J.).\n      61\n         Fulton, 253 Mich App at 91 (SMOLENSKI, J., dissenting), quoting Wickens v\nOakwood Healthcare System, 242 Mich App 385, 392; 619 NW2d 7 (2000). The\npublished Court of Appeals decision in Wickens was not controlling in Fulton because\nthis Court had already reversed in part and vacated in part that published decision.\nWickens v Oakwood Healthcare System, 465 Mich 53; 631 NW2d 686 (2001).\n\n\n\n                                            34\n\finterpretation essentially rewrote the second sentence of § 2912a(2) to include the\n\nfollowing bracketed word: “In an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff cannot\n\nrecover for loss of an opportunity to survive or an opportunity to achieve a better result\n\nunless the [initial] opportunity was greater than 50%.”\n\n       Thus, both the majority and the dissent in Fulton inserted additional words into the\n\nstatute. Their reasons for doing so were identical: each believed the additional language\n\nwas necessary to enforce the perceived legislative intent to respond to the Falcon Court’s\n\ncreation of the lost opportunity claim. However, these multiple interpretations show that,\n\neven if they were correct that the amendment was a legislative response to Falcon, the\n\nscope of such response was far from clear.\n\n       In the end, the lead opinion in Stone concluded:\n\n              It is confounding to attempt to ascertain just what the Legislature\n       was trying to do with this amendment. . . .\n\n              As written, the second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) can be made\n       understandable only by adding words or by redefining “injury” in a way\n       significantly contrary to the mass of caselaw at the time the sentence was\n       added. . . . None of these multiple, contradictory interpretations can be\n       shown to be the “correct” construction of legislative intent. Choosing\n       between them can only be a guess. . . . Accordingly, I conclude that the\n       second sentence of subsection 2 cannot be judicially enforced because\n       doing so requires the Court to impose its own prerogative on an act of the\n       Legislature.[62]\n\n\n\n\n       62\n            Stone, 482 Mich at 160-161 (opinion by TAYLOR, C.J.).\n\n\n\n                                             35\n\fSince this Court’s split opinions in Stone, the Legislature has not clarified the confusion\n\nsurrounding the appropriate interpretation of MCL 600.2912a(2). Therefore, my position\n\nremains that the provision is unenforceable as enacted.\n\n       The decision by the new majority that this case represents a traditional medical\n\nmalpractice case further muddles this important area of the law. Moreover, three justices\n\nof the new majority have changed their published positions over the past several years on\n\nthe nature of the evidence required to prove proximate cause.\n\n       If the numerous fractured decisions and inconsistent opinions of the members\n\nof this Court fail to demonstrate that this statute is impossible to interpret\n\nreasonably, then it is hard to envision a better illustration that MCL 600.2912a(2) is\n\ninherently internally inconsistent and cannot be parsed.\n\n                                    IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       Confusion and uncertainty in the law prevent citizens from arranging their affairs\n\nin a predictable fashion. This Court initially created uncertainty in adopting the lost\n\nopportunity claim in Falcon because it was so profoundly at odds with traditional\n\nprinciples of causation. It is no wonder that the Legislature had difficulty reconciling\n\n“Falcon causation” with the traditional causation that the Legislature clearly desired to\n\nmaintain in medical malpractice claims. Today, the new majority has created even more\n\nuncertainty in interpreting the legislative response to Falcon. While the result in this case\n\nundoubtedly serves the interests of lawyers who litigate medical malpractice cases, it\n\npoorly serves the people of this state to have the law become even more\n\nincomprehensibly muddled. This is not an accidental act, but one intentionally designed\n\n\n                                             36\n\fto thwart the legislative directive that the plaintiff prove the traditional requirement of\n\nproximate cause in every “action alleging medical malpractice . . . .”63 Judges, as neutral\n\narbiters whose function is merely to interpret the laws enacted through the democratic\n\nprocess, should not be agents of “societal change” they desire, and they certainly should\n\nnot contribute to confusion and chaos in the law. The new majority’s resolution of this\n\ncase fails on both counts.\n\n       Plaintiff’s claim is a prototypical lost opportunity claim. As such, the second\n\nsentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) expressly controls plaintiff’s claim. However, I continue\n\nto maintain that § 2912a(2) is unenforceable as enacted, and I reiterate former Chief\n\nJustice TAYLOR’s call for the Legislature “to reexamine its goal and the policies it wishes\n\nto promote and strive to better articulate its intent in that regard.”64 Today, that call is\n\nmore urgent than it was just two years ago.\n\n       Today is a sad day for predictability in Michigan law. The disorder sown by the\n\nnew majority in their several opinions speaks poorly of the quality of decision-making in\n\nthis Court.     Doctrinal destruction aside, the obvious manipulation of the statistical\n\nevidence by the justices of the new majority to achieve their goal of creating a cause of\n\naction when the proofs have failed is itself worthy of condemnation.\n\n\n\n\n       63\n            MCL 600.2912a(2).\n       64\n            Stone, 482 Mich at 165 (opinion by TAYLOR, C.J.).\n\n\n\n                                              37\n\f      For all of the reasons stated, I vigorously dissent from overreaching by the new\n\nmajority and, instead, would vacate as improvidently entered this Court’s September 30,\n\n2009, order granting leave to appeal.\n\n\n      CORRIGAN, J., concurred with YOUNG, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                          38\n\f",

We disagree with\n\nthe Court of Appeals’ analysis and conclusion.\n\n         We hold that the Court of Appeals erred by relying on Fulton and determining that\n\nthis is a loss-of-opportunity case controlled by both the first and second sentences\n\nof MCL 600.2912a(2), and instead hold that this case presents a claim for traditional\n\nmedical malpractice controlled only by the first sentence of § 2912a(2).

Finally, we hold that Fulton did not\n\ncorrectly set forth the burden of proof necessary to establish proximate causation for\n\ntraditional medical malpractice cases as set forth in § 2912a(2). Therefore, we overrule\n\nFulton to the extent that it has led courts to improperly designate what should be\n\ntraditional medical malpractice claims as loss-of-opportunity claims and has improperly\n\ntransformed the burden of proof in a traditional malpractice case from a proximate cause\n\nto the proximate cause.\n\n         Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this\n\nmatter to the Court of Appeals for consideration of the issue not decided on appeal in that\n\ncourt.\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f                             I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n\n       This case involves allegations of negligence in medical care. Plaintiff had an\n\nillness known as sickle cell anemia. Plaintiff developed acute chest syndrome (ACS),\n\nwhich is a known complication of sickle cell anemia. Plaintiff claims that his ACS was\n\nmisdiagnosed as pneumonia and as a consequence he did not receive the correct\n\ntreatment. Plaintiff’s experts opined that ACS requires treatment with an aggressive\n\nblood transfusion or an exchange transfusion, either of which needs to be given on a\n\ntimely basis. While plaintiff ultimately received a transfusion, his experts opined that it\n\nwas given too late and as a consequence, plaintiff suffered a disabling stroke. Plaintiff\n\nalleged that defendants’ failure to provide a timely transfusion violated the standard of\n\ncare and that defendants’ negligence was a proximate cause of his disabling stroke.\n\nPlaintiff’s complaint pled a traditional malpractice claim and did not plead a claim for\n\nlost opportunity.\n\n       In support of his position, plaintiff offered two expert hematologists who testified\n\nthat defendants’ violations of the standard of care more probably than not caused\n\nplaintiff’s injuries. Plaintiff’s third hematology expert explained his opinion in statistical\n\nterms and testified that a patient with ACS has a 10 to 20 percent chance of developing a\n\nstroke. He further testified that with a timely exchange transfusion, the risk of stroke is\n\nreduced to less than 5 to 10 percent.\n\n       Defendants brought a motion for summary disposition challenging the sufficiency\n\nof plaintiff’s expert testimony on the issue of proximate causation.            Even though\n\nplaintiff’s complaint pled only traditional malpractice, defendants’ motion made no\n\n\n                                              3\n\fdistinction between the proof required for proximate causation in a traditional\n\nmalpractice claim and the burden required for a claim based on loss of opportunity.\n\nInstead, defendants argued that plaintiff’s case was controlled by both the first and\n\nsecond sentences of MCL 600.2912a(2), which requires that the plaintiff prove “that he\n\nor she suffered an injury that more probably than not was proximately caused by the\n\nnegligence of the defendant or defendants” and that “the plaintiff cannot recover for loss\n\nof an opportunity to survive or an opportunity to achieve a better result unless the\n\nopportunity was greater than 50%.”\n\n       Defendants argued that a reduction in the risk of stroke from 10 to 20 percent to\n\nless than 5 to 10 percent amounted to at best a 20 percentage point differential,1 which\n\nwould be insufficient to meet the burden of proof on proximate causation. Defendants\n\nrelied on Fulton to support their position that plaintiff must comply with this percentage\n\npoint differential theory. Plaintiff countered that defendants’ statistical portrayal of these\n\nnumbers was mathematically inaccurate because his experts’ testimony supported a\n\nfinding that his injuries were more probably than not proximately caused by defendants’\n\nnegligence. The trial court agreed with plaintiff. The trial court denied defendants’\n\n\n\n\n       1\n         The Court of Appeals reasoned: “This number is the difference between the\nhighest chance plaintiff had of developing a stroke without proper treatment (i.e., 20\npercent) and the lowest chance of developing a stroke with proper treatment (i.e., less\nthan five percent, or in the light most favorable to plaintiff, zero percent)”. O’Neal v St\nJohn Hosp & Med Ctr, unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued\nNovember 4, 2008 (Docket Nos. 277317 and 277318), p 5 n 7.\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\fmotion, ruling that plaintiff had presented sufficient testimony to establish a question of\n\nfact on proximate causation.\n\n       The Court of Appeals based its decision entirely on Fulton and reversed the trial\n\ncourt in an unpublished opinion per curiam, holding that this case presented a claim for a\n\nloss of opportunity and that plaintiff had not met his burden of proof under MCL\n\n600.2912a(2).2 The Court of Appeals reasoned that plaintiff was bound by the Fulton\n\nanalysis and that a percentage point differential applied to this case.3 The Court opined:\n\n               In asserting that defendants’ negligence resulted in a stroke, plaintiff\n       essentially argues that had defendants ordered a transfusion sooner, plaintiff\n       would have avoided a stroke. Thus, to say defendants’ failure to apply\n       proper treatment caused the stroke is to say that this failure deprived\n       plaintiff a greater opportunity to avoid the stroke. Consequently, plaintiff’s\n       claim amounts to one of lost opportunity to achieve a better result, and §\n       2912a(2) is applicable.\n\n             In Fulton, this Court set forth the formula by which to calculate\n       whether the opportunity to achieve a better result was greater than 50\n       percent – specifically, the Court must “subtract[] the plaintiff's opportunity\n       to survive after the defendant’s alleged malpractice from the initial\n       opportunity to survive without the malpractice.” Ensink [v Mecosta Co Gen\n       Hosp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2028967\"><a href=\"/opinion/2028967/ensink-v-mecosta-county-general-hosp/\"><span class=\"volume\">262</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.

STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n      This case involves review of a trial court’s decision on a motion for summary\n\ndisposition which this Court reviews de novo.6 The issue also involves questions of\n\nstatutory interpretation. Statutory interpretation is a question of law, which this Court\n\nalso reviews de novo.7\n\n                                    III. ANALYSIS\n\n      At issue is whether the Court of Appeals properly reversed the trial court’s denial\n\nof summary disposition on the issue of proximate causation. In order to answer this\n\nquestion we must review MCL 600.2912a.\n\n      MCL 600.2912a provides:\n\n\n              (1) Subject to subsection (2), in an action alleging malpractice, the\n      plaintiff has the burden of proving that in light of the state of the art\n      existing at the time of the alleged malpractice:\n\n              (a) The defendant, if a general practitioner, failed to provide the\n      plaintiff the recognized standard of acceptable professional practice or care\n      in the community in which the defendant practices or in a similar\n      community, and that as a proximate result of the defendant failing to\n      provide that standard, the plaintiff suffered an injury.\n\n\n\n      5\n          O’Neal v St John Hosp & Med Ctr, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">901</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2009).\n      6\n          Herald Co v Bay City, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2211455\"><a href=\"/opinion/2211455/herald-co-v-city-of-bay-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 117; 614 NW2d 873 (2000).\n      7\n      In re Investigation of March 1999 Riots in East Lansing), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2227292\"><a href=\"/opinion/2227292/in-re-investigation-of-march-1999-riots/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">378</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 383;\n617 NW2d 310 (2000).\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\f              (b) The defendant, if a specialist, failed to provide the recognized\n      standard of practice or care within that specialty as reasonably applied in\n      light of the facilities available in the community or other facilities\n      reasonably available under the circumstances, and as a proximate result of\n      the defendant failing to provide that standard, the plaintiff suffered an\n      injury.\n\n              (2) In an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff has the\n      burden of proving that he or she suffered an injury that more probably than\n      not was proximately caused by the negligence of the defendant or\n      defendants. In an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff cannot\n      recover for loss of an opportunity to survive or an opportunity to achieve a\n      better result unless the opportunity was greater than 50%.\n\n      This statute, which governs the burden of proof in medical malpractice cases, was\n\noriginally added to the Revised Judicature Act in 1977. It has been amended on several\n\noccasions, with the most recent amendment in 1993 adding subsection (2), which is at\n\nissue in this case. Subsection (2) contains two sentences. It is undisputed that the first\n\nsentence, which repeats the burden of proof as articulated in subsections (1)(a) and (b),\n\nmerely reiterates the longstanding rule requiring a plaintiff to prove “that he or she\n\nsuffered an injury that more probably than not was proximately caused by the negligence\n\nof the defendant or defendants.” MCL 600.2912a(2).\n\n      The second sentence of § 2912a(2) addresses a subcategory of injuries in medical\n\nmalpractice litigation governed by the loss-of-opportunity doctrine. The Legislature did\n\nnot define the phrase “loss of an opportunity to survive or an opportunity to achieve a\n\nbetter result.” However, while not defined in the statute, the doctrine was initially\n\n\n\n\n                                            7\n\frecognized and defined in Michigan in Falcon v Mem Hosp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2212458\"><a href=\"/opinion/2212458/falcon-v-memorial-hosp/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 462 NW2d\n\n44 (1990).8\n\n       It is generally accepted that the 1993 amendment to § 2912a was adopted in a\n\ndirect reaction to Falcon, meaning that it repudiated Falcon’s reduced proximate\n\ncausation theory.9 Thus, it is generally accepted that in adopting this amendment, the\n\nLegislature intended to limit medical malpractice claims to the pre-Falcon state of the\n\nlaw: if it was more probable than not that the plaintiff would have died even with the best\n\nof treatment, a claim for medical malpractice is precluded.10\n\n       We next turn to the correct interpretation of both sentences of § 2912a(2) and their\n\napplicability to the case before us. In examining the first line of § 2912a(2), we are\n\nguided by the principle that nothing in § 2912a(2) has changed the burden of proof for\n\ntraditional medical malpractice claims. The language of the first line of subsection (2) is\n\nclear: “in an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff has the burden of proving\n\nthat he or she suffered an injury that more probably than not was proximately caused by\n\n       8\n         Falcon held that in a wrongful death case a plaintiff could bring a claim for a\ndecedent’s loss of opportunity to survive even if he or she did not meet the traditional\nproximate causation standard. Falcon reasoned that when the decedent suffered a\nsubstantial reduction in the loss of opportunity to survive—in that case 37.5 percent—\neven though the plaintiff could not maintain a traditional malpractice claim for the death\nitself because the plaintiff could not establish causation, she could bring a claim for loss\nof opportunity to survive. Falcon also stated that the doctrine applied to wrongful death\nclaims and left the question of whether the doctrine applied to lesser injuries to another\nday. 436 Mich at 460-462, 469-470 (opinion by LEVIN, J.).\n       9\n           Stone v Willaimson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 169; 753 NW2d 106 (2008).\n       10\n            Nothing in our opinion today alters or changes that premise.\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\fthe negligence of the defendant or defendants.” This language reiterates the language of\n\nthe previous subsections and merely restates the well-accepted, well-established historical\n\nrule for proximate causation.11 As the meaning of this sentence is well-established, no\n\nfurther statutory construction is necessary.\n\n       The proper interpretation of proximate causation in a negligence action is well-\n\nsettled in Michigan. In order to be a proximate cause, the negligent conduct must have\n\nbeen a cause of the plaintiff’s injury and the plaintiff’s injury must have been a natural\n\nand probable result of the negligent conduct.        These two prongs are respectively\n\ndescribed as “cause-in-fact” and “legal causation.” See Skinner v Square D Co, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1864721\"><a href=\"/opinion/1864721/skinner-v-square-d-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 162-163; 516 NW2d 475 (1994); Sutter v Biggs, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1306162\"><a href=\"/opinion/1306162/sutter-v-biggs/\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 139 NW2d 684\n\n(1966); Glinski v Szylling, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2156065\"><a href=\"/opinion/2156065/glinski-v-szylling/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">182</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 99 NW2d 637 (1959).

It is equally well-\n\nsettled that proximate causation in a malpractice claim is treated no differently than in an\n\nordinary negligence claim, and it is well-established that there can be more than one\n\nproximate cause contributing to an injury.

Thus, the burden of proof for proximate causation in\n\ntraditional medical malpractice cases is analyzed according to its historical common law\n\ndefinitions and the analysis is the same as in any other ordinary negligence claim.\n\nNothing in this opinion changes or alters these well-settled principles.12\n\n       We next consider whether the Court of Appeals erred by relying on Fulton and\n\napplying the second sentence of § 2912a(2) to the present case. The second sentence of\n\n§ 2912a(2) provides “In an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff cannot\n\nrecover for loss of an opportunity to survive or an opportunity to achieve a better result\n\nunless the opportunity was greater than 50%.” Since the statute was amended in 1993,\n\nlitigants and the courts have debated the meaning of this second sentence.13 While the\n\n       12\n          This is true despite the contrary statements in Justice YOUNG’s dissent. The\ncomments of the dissent amount to nothing more than another intemperate outburst of\ninappropriate accusations and illogical assertions. While the dissent decries confusion,\nthe only apparent confusion in this matter lies in the dissent itself, which lacks sound\nanalytical reasoning and even a basic understanding of the law of proximate causation.\nThe dissent, if followed to its logical conclusion, would allow recourse for the negligent\nactions of medical providers only in those instances in which one provider’s conduct is at\nissue and only when no pre-existing medical condition exists. Such an interpretation is\nnot supported by any case law or the statute itself.\n       13\n          The opinions in Stone illustrate this point. The debate has centered on such\nquestions as whether the Legislature intended this sentence to restore the law to its pre-\nFalcon state, meaning that loss-of-opportunity claims are not recognized at all, or\nwhether the Legislature’s choice of language reflected intent to recognize such claims but\nlimit their availability. Questions have also arisen about whether the last sentence of\n§ 2912a(2) applies to all medical malpractice cases, including traditional ones, or only\nthose that are presented as loss-of-opportunity claims.\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\fdebate over the meaning of the second sentence demonstrates that significant questions\n\nsurround loss-of-opportunity cases, it is clear from the plain language of the statute that\n\nthe second sentence is intended to apply to loss-of-opportunity cases. Today we address\n\nwhether the second sentence of § 2912a(2) also applies to traditional malpractice cases\n\nand we unequivocally hold that it does not. Because the Court of Appeals in this case\n\nrelied on Fulton, which erroneously applied the second sentence to a traditional\n\nmalpractice case, we review Fulton and determine what, if any, continuing validity it has.\n\n       Fulton involved a claim for the failure to timely diagnose cervical cancer. The\n\nplaintiff, the personal representative of the decedent’s estate, alleged that if decedent’s\n\ncancer had been diagnosed during her pregnancy, she would have had treatment options\n\navailable that could have saved her life. The theory was that the decedent was not\n\ndiagnosed until her cancer was untreatable and, as a consequence, she died.            The\n\nplaintiff’s expert’s testimony on proximate causation was described by the Court of\n\nAppeals as follows:\n\n              Defendants moved for summary disposition under MCR\n       2.116(C)(10), arguing that plaintiff could not show that their negligence\n       was the cause of Fulton's death. In response, plaintiff submitted an\n       affidavit from Dr. Taylor, opining that if Fulton's cancer had been\n       diagnosed while she was pregnant and if she had been treated after her child\n       was delivered, she would have had an eighty-five percent chance to survive.\n       Dr. Taylor opined that when Fulton was actually diagnosed with cancer, her\n       opportunity to survive had decreased to sixty to sixty-five percent.\n       Therefore, according to Dr. Taylor, Fulton's opportunity to survive the\n       cancer decreased by twenty to twenty-five percent because of defendants'\n       malpractice. In reply, defendants argued that Dr. Taylor's affidavit was\n       improper because it contradicted his deposition testimony and that, in any\n\n\n\n\n                                            11\n\f       event, this affidavit was not enough to create a question of fact under MCL\n       600.2912a(2).[14]\n\n       Fulton opined that because the decedent went from an 85 percent pre-malpractice\n\nchance of survival to a 60-65 percent post-malpractice chance of survival, she “suffered a\n\nloss of a twenty to twenty-five percent chance of survival.”15 Fulton determined that a\n\npercentage point differential subtraction analysis was required by the statute.          As\n\ndemonstrated by the Fulton analysis, the conclusion is reached by a simplistic subtraction\n\nformula.      Fulton subtracted the statistical likelihood of a better outcome without\n\ntreatment from the statistical likelihood of a better outcome with treatment to determine if\n\nthe resulting number is greater than 50.\n\n       Fulton’s simplistic subtraction formula is not an accurate way to determine\n\nwhether a defendant’s malpractice is a proximate cause of the injury. Fulton’s analysis\n\nwas erroneous because it misconstrued proximate causation as it applies to a traditional\n\nmalpractice case. Under the Fulton subtraction formula it is mathematically impossible\n\nfor there to be more than one proximate cause.        Thus, in creating and applying this\n\nsimplistic formula, Fulton fundamentally altered plaintiff’s burden of proof. Fulton\n\ntransformed the burden of proof in traditional malpractice cases from a proximate cause\n\nto the proximate cause because it allows for only one proximate cause in any case. This\n\nproposition is in error because it has no basis in statute or common law and it is\n\ninconsistent with the clear and unambiguous language of the first sentence of § 2912a(2).\n       14\n            Fulton, 253 Mich App at 74-75.\n       15\n            Id. at 82.\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\fMoreover, as the Court of Appeals’ decision in this case illustrates, Fulton’s analysis is\n\nbeing applied to all malpractice cases, even when they are pled only as traditional\n\nmalpractice cases.\n\n       The Court of Appeals analysis in the present case perpetuates the Fulton doctrine\n\nand the confusion surrounding proximate causation in medical malpractice claims. Much\n\nof the confusion stems from the inherent nature of medical malpractice: the plaintiff is\n\ngenerally seeking treatment for a preexisting medical condition that is causing a problem\n\nof some sort on its own, whereas in an ordinary negligence claim the plaintiff is generally\n\nan otherwise uninjured person who is claiming that the entire injury was caused by the\n\nincident.\n\n       In the present case, plaintiff was prepared to offer three expert witnesses to testify\n\non his behalf on the issue of proximate causation at the time of trial. Two of plaintiff’s\n\nexperts unequivocally opined, in a discovery deposition, that had the necessary treatment\n\nbeen given, it was more probable than not that plaintiff would not have had a stroke.\n\n       Plaintiff’s first expert, Dr. Richard Stein, opined:\n\n              Q. I just have one question. Doctor, based on the extrapolation of\n       the peds data that you’ve described for us, within a reasonable degree of\n       medical certainty, and by that I mean with a greater than 50 percent\n       likelihood, if Dr Tapazoglou had met the standard of care as you defined it\n       today, would the stroke have been avoided?\n\n              A. To a reasonable degree of medical certainty, my opinion is yes,\n       and I have already stated the basis for that opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\f      After opining that an exchange transfusion was necessary to reduce plaintiff’s\n\nhemoglobin S concentration to less than 30 percent, Dr. Luce, plaintiff’s second expert,\n\nopined:\n\n            Q. With respect to Mr. O’Neal, if the hemoglobin S had been\n      reduced to less than 30 percent, do you have an opinion as to whether or not\n      he would have had the stroke anyhow?\n\n             A. I think it is probable that he would not have.\n\n             Q. When you say “probable,” are you prepared to say more\n      probably than not had Mr. O’Neal had his hemoglobin S reduced to less\n      than 30 percent he would not have had a stroke?\n\n             A. Correct.\n\n      The testimony of the third expert, Dr. Griffin Rodgers, was more specific in\n\nexpressing the statistics. The trial court summarized his testimony:\n\n             Dr. Griffin Rodgers, a hematologist, testified that a patient in sickle\n      cell crisis of acute chest syndrome has in the order of 10 or 20 percent\n      chance of developing a stroke. With a timely exchange transfusion, it\n      reduces the risk of stroke to less than 5 or 10 percent. Dr. Griffin’s\n      testimony demonstrates that Plaintiff had more than a 50 percent chance to\n      avoid a stroke.\n\n      As this case demonstrates, the way causation is analyzed is important, especially\n\nwhen reviewing statistical data. In this instance, do these facts represent at best a 20\n\npercent chance to avoid an injury, as the Court of Appeals concluded, or do they establish\n\nproximate causation as found by the trial court? To answer this question we must\n\ndetermine whether we use a percentage point differential subtraction analysis (as used by\n\nthe Court of Appeals in applying the Fulton formula) or whether we follow the approach\n\ntaken by the trial court. In doing so we must follow the analysis that is most consistent\n\nwith our historical rules governing proximate causation and the plain language of\n\n\n                                            14\n\f§ 2912a(2), which requires that a plaintiff prove that he or she suffered an injury that\n\nmore probably than not was proximately caused by the negligence of the defendant or\n\ndefendants, in the context of this case. While the use of mathematical statistics is not\n\nrequired by the statute, and we do not impose such a requirement, we conclude that the\n\nanalysis used by plaintiff’s experts and the trial court represents the correct approach in\n\nthis instance because it accurately represents the historical view of proximate causation\n\nas expressed in the first sentence of § 2912a(2) based on its application to these facts.\n\n       In this case, it is undisputed that with or without treatment plaintiff was more\n\nprobably than not going to avoid the stroke. In other words, even without treatment it\n\nwas more probable that plaintiff would not have a stroke. However, plaintiff did have a\n\nstroke. If the Fulton 50 percentage point differential subtraction analysis is used, plaintiff\n\ncannot proceed with a traditional claim because the failure to provide treatment was not\n\nthe cause of the injury expressed in percentage point differential terms. As previously\n\nindicated, however, the problem is that a 50 percentage point differential subtraction\n\nanalysis necessarily means that there can only be one cause of an injury. This analysis is\n\nnot consistent with the historical test for proximate causation, which has always been that\n\nthe malpractice be a proximate cause rather than the proximate cause.\n\n       Applying a 50 percentage point differential subtraction analysis requires that we\n\nchange the traditional analysis of causation in medical malpractice cases to the one most\n\nimmediate, efficient, and direct cause of the injury. This, however, is the standard for\n\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\fdetermining the proximate cause rather than a proximate cause. This approach is simply\n\nnot in keeping with our historical view of causation.16\n\n       The Fulton approach is incorrect because it requires a reliance on probabilities and\n\npossibilities of things that have not yet occurred, rather than reliance on what has actually\n\noccurred. Plaintiff in this case did have a stroke and was injured; his claim is for an\n\nexisting injury, not just the possibility of one. Plaintiff’s injury is no longer a statistical\n\nprobability, it is a reality. The focus, once he was injured, is on the connection between\n\ndefendants’ conduct and the injury. The relevant inquiry for proximate causation is\n\nwhether the negligent conduct was a cause of plaintiff’s injury and whether plaintiff’s\n\ninjury was a natural and probable result of the negligent conduct. If so, defendants’\n\nconduct was a proximate cause, even though there may have been other causes. The\n\nanalysis for proximate causation is the same whether we are discussing medical\n\nmalpractice or ordinary negligence. Defendants’ conduct in this case meets this standard\n\nwhen the defendants’ actual conduct, rather than plaintiff’s statistical probability of\n\nachieving a better outcome, is the focus of the inquiry.\n\n\n16\n   Common-law rules apply to medical malpractice actions unless specifically abrogated\nby statute. See MCL 600.2912(1) which provides:\n\n              A civil action for malpractice may be maintained against any person\n       professing or holding himself out to be a member of a state licensed\n       profession. The rules of the common law applicable to actions against\n       members of a state licensed profession, for malpractice, are applicable\n       against any person who holds himself out to be a member of a state\n       licensed profession. [Emphasis added.]\n\n\n\n\n                                              16\n\f      In this instance, plaintiff suffered an injury that was more probably than not\n\nproximately caused by the negligence of defendants. As the trial court properly found,\n\ndefendants’ negligent conduct increased plaintiff’s risk of stroke from less than 5 to 10\n\npercent to 10 to 20 percent. When viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff, the\n\nchange is from less than 5 percent to 20 percent. As the trial court analyzed, this\n\nrepresents a change that is greater than 50 percent in this instance. The trial court’s\n\napproach is in keeping with the historical analysis of proximate causation because it\n\ninvolves a comparative analysis, not a simplistic subtraction formula. Determining what\n\nis “more probable than not” is inherently a comparative analysis. The proper method of\n\ndetermining whether defendant’s conduct more probably than not proximately caused the\n\ninjury involves a comparative analysis, which is dependent upon the facts and\n\ncircumstances and expert opinion in a given case.17\n\n      We conclude that Fulton’s simple subtraction analysis is wrong and\n\nunsupportable. While § 2912a(2) does not mandate the use of statistics or require any\n\nparticular mathematical formula, the historic analysis of proximate cause must be\n\nfollowed to wit: the analysis or formulation used cannot require that the cause must be\n\nthe proximate cause rather than a proximate cause.\n\n      No single formula can be dispositive for all cases. In this case if we were to use a\n\nstandard percentage decrease calculation (meaning that defendants were responsible for\n\n      17\n         Comparative analyses could include standard percentage increases, standard\npercentage decreases, or other scientifically accepted statistical analyses offered by the\nexperts.\n\n\n\n                                           17\n\f15 percentage points out of the 20 total percentage points of plaintiff’s risk of the bad\n\nresult, so that there is a 15/20 chance or 75 percent chance) defendant’s malpractice was a\n\nproximate cause of the injury.18 Similarly, if the evidence is viewed as a standard\n\npercentage increase calculation (meaning that defendant was responsible for 15\n\npercentage points of increase over the 5 percentage points to begin with, thus causing a\n\n300% (15/5) increase in plaintiff’s risk of harm,) defendant’s malpractice was a\n\nproximate cause of the injury.19\n\n       It is also important to emphasize that not all traditional medical malpractice cases\n\ncan or will be expressed in statistical or percentage terms, nor is a plaintiff required to\n\nexpress proximate causation in percentage terms. The plain language of the statute\n\nrequires that proximate causation in traditional malpractice cases be expressed by\n\nshowing that the defendant’s conduct was more probably than not a cause of the injury,\n\nnot by statistical or percentage terms.20\n\n\n       18\n           Moreover, either of the mathematical formulas used as an example (standard\nstatistical decrease or increase) may not be appropriate in all cases because either could\nlimit causation to one proximate cause in those cases involving the conduct of more than\none defendant.\n       19\n         I recognize that Justice CAVANAGH and I differ on whether an increased risk of\nharm is a valid statistical method for determining proximate causation in a traditional\nmalpractice case. However, both Justice CAVANAGH and I agree that claims evaluated in\nthat manner may be brought; we only disagree about whether those claims proceed as\nclaims for traditional malpractice or claims for loss-of-opportunity.\n       20\n          We also recognize that different mathematical formulations can have varying\nresults and that the results must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\nparty. For example, while percentage increases and percentage decreases would both be\nvalid methods to determine proximate causation, they can yield different results. In those\n\n\n                                            18\n\f       Given that Fulton used an incorrect mathematical formula and is being used to\n\ntransform the burden of proof in traditional malpractice cases, we must next decide if it\n\nhas any continuing validity. We find that it has none in the context of traditional medical\n\nmalpractice cases. In Stone, all seven justices of this Court recognized that Fulton’s\n\nanalysis was incorrect or should be found to no longer be good law, though their reasons\n\nfor doing so varied.21 While I was not a member of this Court when Stone was decided, I\n\nalso conclude that Fulton did not correctly set forth the burden of proof necessary to\n\nestablish proximate causation as set forth in § 2912a(2). As all justices of this Court have\n\nconcluded that Fulton’s analysis of § 2912a(2) is wrong, it is illogical to fail to overrule\n\nFulton, because by failing to do so, this Court fosters unnecessary confusion for litigants\n\nand the lower courts. Accordingly, we overrule Fulton to the extent that it has led courts\n\nto improperly designate what should be traditional medical malpractice claims as loss-of-\n\nopportunity claims and has improperly transformed the burden of proof in a traditional\n\nmalpractice case from a proximate cause to the proximate cause.\n\n       We emphasize that we hold that the second sentence of § 2912a(2) applies only to\n\nmedical malpractice cases that plead loss of opportunity and not to those that plead\n\ntraditional medical malpractice; we do not address the scope, extent, or nature of loss-of-\n\nopportunity claims as that issue is not before us. Significant questions surround such\n\n\ninstances, if either calculation demonstrates that the plaintiff suffered an injury that more\nprobably than not was proximately caused by the negligence of the defendant or\ndefendants, the plaintiff’s case may proceed.\n       21\n            Stone, 482 Mich at 164 (opinion by TAYLOR, C.J.).\n\n\n\n                                             19\n\fclaims.22 However, we decline to decide issues that are not necessary to the resolution of\n\nthe case before us.\n\n                                   IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       For all the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the Court of Appeals erred in the\n\npresent case by reversing the trial court’s denial of summary disposition. The case before\n\nus presents a traditional malpractice claim. It does not present a claim for loss of\n\nopportunity. In traditional malpractice cases, the plaintiff is required to prove that the\n\ndefendant’s negligence more probably than not caused the plaintiff’s injury. In this case,\n\nthe testimony of plaintiff’s expert witnesses supports plaintiff’s position on proximate\n\ncausation. While that testimony is not dispositive, it is sufficient to raise a question of\n\nfact to defeat a motion for summary disposition, allowing the issue to be adjudicated on\n\nthe merits by the trier of fact. Finally, we overrule Fulton to the extent that it has led\n\ncourts to improperly designate what should be traditional medical malpractice claims as\n\nloss-of-opportunity claims and has improperly transformed the burden of proof in a\n\ntraditional malpractice case from a proximate cause to the proximate cause.\n\n\n\n\n       22\n          Questions exist about the full scope and extent of loss-of-opportunity claims and\nthe extent of damages recoverable in those actions, which we do not decide today. For\nexample, a partial discussion of the scope of loss-of-opportunity claims was at issue in\nWickens v Oakwood Healthcare Sys, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 631 NW2d 686 (2001). While Justice\nCAVANAGH and I do not fully agree in this case, I do agree with Justice CAVANAGH’s\npartial dissent in Wickens that a living person may pursue a claim for loss of opportunity\nunder the circumstances presented in that case.\n\n\n\n                                            20\n\f         Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this\n\nmatter to the Court of Appeals for consideration of the issue not decided on appeal in that\n\ncourt.\n\n\n         WEAVER, J., concurred with HATHAWAY, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                            21\n\f                            STATE OF MICHIGAN\n\n                                     SUPREME COURT\n\n\nRAYMOND O’NEAL,\n\n              Plaintiff-Appellant,\n\nv                                                            No. 138180, 138181\n\nST.

I agree with the majority that the Court of Appeals’\n\njudgment in this case should be reversed because the Court erred by treating this case as a\n\nloss-of-opportunity case instead of a traditional medical malpractice case and, as a result,\n\nerred by requiring plaintiff to meet the requirements in the second sentence of MCL\n\n600.2912a(2). I further agree that Fulton v William Beaumont Hosp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1659357\"><a href=\"/opinion/1659357/fulton-v-pontiac-general-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">253</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">;\n\n655 NW2d 569 (2002), should be overruled to the extent that courts have relied on it to\n\nimproperly transform what could be traditional medical malpractice claims into loss-of-\n\nopportunity claims.1 I write separately to express my views on the issues presented.\n\n\n       1\n         Contrary to Justice YOUNG’s assertion, I overrule Fulton only to the extent that it\nis implicated in this case. Regardless, I am sincerely baffled about what relevance Chief\nJustice KELLY’s views on a former composition of this Court have to do with whether we\nshould overrule a Court of Appeals case.\n\f      This case raises the issue of what the proper burden of proof for proximate\n\ncausation is in medical malpractice cases in which the plaintiff had a preexisting risk of\n\nthe bad result that occurred, even absent the defendant’s alleged negligence. I agree with\n\nthe lead opinion that the second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) is inapplicable to this\n\ncase because it only applies to loss-of-opportunity claims and this case does not involve a\n\nloss-of-opportunity claim. Instead, the key issue in this case is the proper interpretation\n\nof the first sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2).\n\n      The first sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) clearly provides that a plaintiff in any\n\nmedical malpractice case, including a traditional medical malpractice case, bears the\n\nburden of showing that it is more probable than not that the plaintiff’s injury was\n\nproximately caused by the defendant’s negligence. Under traditional malpractice law in\n\nMichigan, proximate cause includes two prongs: (1) cause in fact and (2) legal, or\n\n“proximate,” cause.2 See, e.g., Skinner v Square D Co, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1864721\"><a href=\"/opinion/1864721/skinner-v-square-d-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 162-163; 516\n\nNW2d 475 (1994).         While legal causation relates to the foreseeability of the\n\nconsequences of the defendant’s conduct, the cause-in-fact prong “generally requires\n\nshowing that ‘but for’ the defendant’s actions, the plaintiff’s injury would not have\n\noccurred.” Id. at 163. The cause-in-fact prong is sometimes also stated as requiring that\n\n“it is more likely than not that the conduct of the defendant was a cause in fact of the\n\nresult.” Weymers v Khera, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1877633\"><a href=\"/opinion/1877633/weymers-v-khera/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">639</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 648; 563 NW2d 647 (1997) (quotation marks\n\n      2\n        Because the statute incorporates words and phrases from the common law, it is\nappropriate to consider common-law meanings of these phrases.

Thus, even in cases in which there is statistical evidence that the\n\nplaintiff had a risk of the bad result occurring absent negligence,3 a plaintiff may still\n\nmeet the cause-in-fact prong of the proximate causation analysis if the plaintiff can show\n\nthat it is more probable than not that the defendant’s alleged negligence was a cause in\n\nfact of the bad result occurring. I would hold that this threshold is met if the plaintiff can\n\nshow that the alleged negligence was responsible for a majority, or “more than fifty\n\npercent,” of the risk of the bad result occurring. See MCL 600.2912a(2) and Falcon v\n\nMem Hosp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2212458\"><a href=\"/opinion/2212458/falcon-v-memorial-hosp/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 450; 462 NW2d 44 (1990).4\n\n       Under this approach, a court should consider the total risk of the bad result that the\n\nplaintiff faced, including the risk caused by the alleged negligence. Then, the court\n\nshould consider how much of that risk was created by the negligence. If the negligence\n\nwas responsible for more than half of the total risk of the bad result and the plaintiff\n\nsuffered that bad result, then the cause-in-fact prong of the proximate cause analysis is\n\nmet because it is more probable than not that the defendant’s negligence was a cause in\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         I agree with the lead opinion, however, that not all traditional medical\nmalpractice cases need to be expressed in statistical or percentage terms in order to meet\nthe “more probable than not” standard.\n       4\n        If a plaintiff cannot meet the burden for a traditional medical malpractice claim, I\nwould hold that the plaintiff may still pursue a loss-of-opportunity claim if the plaintiff\ncan meet the requirements for those claims provided in MCL 600.2912a(2) and Falcon,\nas explained in my opinion in Stone v Williamson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 170-179; 753 NW2d\n106 (2008).\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\ffact of the bad result.5 This approach is consistent with the statutory language “more\n\nprobable than not” and with the historical approach to proximate causation.6\n\n\n       5\n         To give a nonmedical example, if I am rolling a die, there is ordinarily a 1 out of\n6 chance that I will roll a number one. But if a defendant negligently changes two\nadditional sides of the die to number ones, then the die will have three number ones.\nNow my chances of rolling a number one are 3 out of 6 (or 1/2). If I actually roll a\nnumber one, there is a 2/3 (approximately 67 percent) chance that I rolled a number one\nthat was created by the defendant’s negligence. Therefore, there is a more than 50\npercent chance that I rolled a number one because of the defendant’s negligence, i.e., it is\nmore probable than not that the defendant’s negligence was a cause in fact of the result.\nNotably, this analysis will differ somewhat if the plaintiff’s increased risk of the bad\nresult is alleged to have been caused by multiple negligent actors, depending on the\ntiming and the interaction of the various causes.\n       6\n          Justice YOUNG haphazardly concludes that “the majority” is extending the\nexception to the cause-in-fact prong created in Falcon to all medical malpractice claims.\nI agree that Falcon created what was essentially an exception to this rule, but I fail to see,\nand Justice YOUNG utterly fails to explain, how my approach in this case is an extension\nof that rule to all traditional medical malpractice cases. Justice YOUNG himself explains\nthat “[i]n cases in which the plaintiff alleges that the defendant’s negligence more\nprobably than not caused the injury, the claim is one of simple medical malpractice [as\nopposed to loss-of-opportunity].” (Quotation marks and citation omitted.)\n\n        Setting aside the numerous pages of Justice YOUNG’s opinion that consist only of\nirrelevant, hyperbolic, or unsubstantiated commentary, he appears to raise only two\nsubstantive concerns with my approach, and neither provides support for his conclusion\nthat it does not satisfy the cause-in-fact prong. First, he irrelevantly notes that, as I\nconcede in footnote 7, this approach is inconsistent with an example I used in Stone.\nSecond, he alleges that I should not have compared the low end of the possible range of\nplaintiff’s risk of the bad result absent negligence to the high end of the range of\nplaintiff’s risk with negligence. I think that my approach is perfectly consistent with our\ncharge to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, given that even\nJustice YOUNG explains that the experts testified that plaintiff’s risk was somewhere\nbetween the ranges the experts provided. But regardless, this criticism only challenges\nwhich numbers to use and not the merits of the approach itself, and it would be possible,\nas Justice YOUNG prefers, to instead compare the low ends of the ranges, or the high\nends, only to each other. For example, if the alleged negligence increased a plaintiff’s\nrisk of the bad result from 5 to 10 percent to 30 to 40 percent, then, regardless of which\nnumbers are compared, the negligence would have been responsible for a majority of the\n\n\n                                              4\n\f       In adopting this approach, I reject the view that a plaintiff must show that the\n\ndefendant’s negligence increased the plaintiff’s risk by more than 50 percentage points,\n\ne.g., from 25 percent to 76 percent, or from 10 percent to 61 percent.7 As noted by the\n\nlead opinion, this approach is inconsistent with the historical approach to proximate\n\ncausation. It is also inconsistent with the first sentence in MCL 600.2912a(2) because it\n\nwould preclude traditional medical malpractice claims in many cases in which the\n\ndefendant’s negligence was more probably than not a cause in fact of the bad result, such\n\nas in a case in which the negligence increased the risk of a bad result from 5 percent to 45\n\npercent.8 I also reject the lead opinion’s “percent-increase” test because it is similarly\n\ninconsistent with a more-probable-than-not standard. The fact that a negligent act caused\n\n\n\n\nplaintiff’s risk of the bad result, and, given that the bad result occurred, it would be more\nprobable than not that the negligence was a cause in fact of the bad result occurring.\nJustice YOUNG fails to address why this logic is incorrect or levy a criticism that actually\nsupports his conclusion that my approach eviscerates the cause-in-fact requirement.\n       7\n         To the extent that I endorsed the percentage point approach by way of an\nexample in my opinion in Stone, I repudiate that position. See Stone, 482 Mich at 177\n(opinion by CAVANAGH, J.), stating that a plaintiff whose chance of survival decreased\nfrom 80 to 40 percent could not bring a traditional malpractice claim because it would not\namount to a 50 percent change.\n       8\n          In this example, the defendant was responsible for 40 percentage points of the\nplaintiff’s risk, out of a total of 45 percentage points, meaning that there is a 40 out of 45\nchance, or 40/45 (approximately 89 percent) chance, that the defendant’s negligence was\na cause in fact of the bad outcome. In contrast, under the percentage-point approach, the\nplaintiff’s burden would not have been met because the increase in risk was 40\npercentage points.\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\fa 50 percent increase in the risk of a bad result does not demonstrate that it is more\n\nprobable than not that the negligence was a cause in fact of the bad result.9\n\n       In this case, plaintiff presented sufficient facts to establish the cause-in-fact prong\n\nof the proximate cause analysis in a traditional medical malpractice claim. Viewing the\n\nfacts in the light most favorable to plaintiff, plaintiff’s expert testified that defendants’\n\nalleged negligence increased plaintiff’s risk of the bad result, the stroke, from 5 percent to\n\n20 percent. Defendant was thus responsible for 15 percentage points out of the total 20\n\npercentage points of plaintiff’s risk of the bad result, meaning that there is a 15/20\n\nchance, or 75 percent chance, that defendant’s alleged negligence was a cause in fact of\n\nthe bad result.10 Thus, plaintiff has presented evidence sufficient to support his allegation\n\n\n\n       9\n         For example, if a defendant’s negligence caused an increase in a plaintiff’s risk\nof a bad result from 10 percent to 15 percent, this would be a 50 percent increase in risk.\nBut it is not more probable than not that the defendant’s negligence was a cause in fact\nbecause the defendant would only have been responsible for five out of the total 15\npercentage points of the plaintiff’s risk of the bad result, meaning that there is only a 5/15\nchance, or an approximately 33 percent chance, that the negligence was a cause in fact of\nthe bad result. As I explain in footnote 3, however, the plaintiff could still pursue a loss-\nof-opportunity claim.\n       10\n          Although this formulation is mathematically identical to Justice MARKMAN’s\napproach, there are very important differences in how we view its utility. I favor\nadopting it because it is consistent with the more-probable-than-not standard in the first\nsentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) as applied to traditional medical malpractice claims in\nwhich the plaintiff had a risk of the bad result even absent negligence. In contrast, Justice\nMARKMAN believes it is required by the second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) and,\nunlike myself, believes that all medical malpractice claims in which there was a risk of\nthe bad result occurring even absent negligence should be treated as loss-of-opportunity\nclaims, regardless of whether the plaintiff can meet the burden of proof for a traditional\nmedical malpractice claim. As explained in my concurring opinion in Stone, I continue\nto think that Justice MARKMAN’s interpretation is inconsistent with the statute’s text and\n\n\n                                              6\n\fthat it is “more probable than not” that defendant’s negligence was a cause in fact of the\n\nstroke occurring.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, I concur with the lead opinion that the judgment of the\n\nCourt of Appeals should be reversed. I would remand the case to the Court of Appeals\n\nfor further proceedings.\n\n\n       KELLY, C.J., concurred with CAVANAGH, J.\n\n\n\n\nMichigan law, including Falcon.

STATUTE AND CASELAW\n\n       MCL 600.2912a(2) provides:\n\n               In an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff has the\n       burden of proving that he or she suffered an injury that more probably than\n       not was proximately caused by the negligence of the defendant or\n       defendants. In an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff cannot\n       recover for loss of an opportunity to survive or an opportunity to achieve a\n       better result unless the opportunity was greater than 50%.[1]\n\nIn Fulton v William Beaumont Hosp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1659357\"><a href=\"/opinion/1659357/fulton-v-pontiac-general-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">253</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.

They concluded that if the plaintiff’s premalpractice\n\nopportunity to achieve a better result was greater than 50 percent, the plaintiff could bring\n\na traditional medical-malpractice action.     However, if the plaintiff’s premalpractice\n\nopportunity to achieve a better result was 50 percent or less, the plaintiff could not bring\n\na traditional medical-malpractice action or a lost-opportunity action because lost-\n\nopportunity actions are no longer allowed under the language of the statute.\n\n       Justices CAVANAGH, KELLY, and WEAVER concluded in Stone that if the\n\npercentage point difference between the plaintiff’s premalpractice opportunity to achieve\n\na better result and his postmalpractice opportunity to achieve a better result was greater\n\nthan 50 percentage points, the plaintiff could bring a traditional medical-malpractice\n\naction. However, if the percentage point difference was 50 points or less, the plaintiff\n\ncould only bring a lost-opportunity action and would have to prove that his\n\npremalpractice opportunity to achieve a better result was greater than 50 percent.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         Because a majority of justices now believes that neither Fulton nor the instant\ncase are lost-opportunity cases, Fulton is now apparently overruled at least with regard to\nthe determination concerning whether a case is a traditional medical-malpractice action\nor a lost-opportunity action. However, because a majority of the justices conclude that\nthe instant case is not a lost-opportunity case, Fulton’s method of analyzing lost-\nopportunity cases is unaffected by the decision in this case.\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\f       Finally, in Stone, I concluded that a lost-opportunity case is “one in which it is at\n\nleast possible that the bad outcome would have occurred even if the patient had received\n\nproper treatment.” Id. at 186 (MARKMAN, J., concurring).4 I further concluded that in\n\norder for a lost-opportunity plaintiff to prevail, he must prove that his lost opportunity\n\nwas greater than 50 percent. And,\n\n       [i]n order to determine whether the “lost opportunity” was greater than 50\n       percent, the postmalpractice chance of obtaining a better result must be\n       subtracted from the premalpractice chance, the postmalpractice chance\n       must then be subtracted from 100, the former number must be divided by\n       the latter number, and then this quotient must be multiplied by 100 to\n       obtain a percentage. [Id.]\n\n“If this percentage is greater than 50, the plaintiff may be able to prevail; if this\n\npercentage is 50 or less, then the plaintiff cannot prevail.” Id.\n\n                             II. PROBLEMS WITH FULTON\n\n       As I observed in Stone, the first problem with Fulton is that it requires a loss of\n\nmore than 50 percentage points, while MCL 600.2912a(2) requires a loss of more than 50\n\npercent.\n\n               The Court of Appeals in Fulton . . . concluded that because the\n       plaintiff’s premalpractice chance of survival was 85 percent and her\n       postmalpractice chance of survival was 60 percent to 65 percent, her “lost\n       opportunity” was 20 percent to 25 percent and, thus, because the plaintiff’s\n       “lost opportunity” was not greater than 50 percent, she could not recover\n       under MCL 600.2912a(2). However, Fulton did not offer any explanation\n       as to why it merely subtracted the postmalpractice chance from the\n       premalpractice chance to determine the “lost opportunity.” This might have\n\n       4\n        “By contrast, if there is no question that the proper treatment would have resulted\nin a good outcome, then the patient who has suffered a bad outcome has a traditional\nmedical-malpractice action.” Stone, 482 Mich at 186 (MARKMAN, J., concurring).\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f       been the correct method of determining the “lost opportunity” if MCL\n       600.2912a(2) required that such a loss be “greater than 50 percentage\n       points.” However, MCL 600.2912a(2) requires that the “lost opportunity”\n       be “greater than 50%.” There is a significant distinction between 50\n       percentage points and 50 percent. As Dr. Roy Waddell, a board-certified\n       orthopedic surgeon in Grand Rapids, has explained: “A decrease in survival\n       rate from 50 percent to 10 percent is a 40-percentage-point decrease, but it\n       is an 80 percent decrease.” Waddell, A doctor’s view of “opportunity to\n       survive”: Fulton’s assumptions and math are wrong, 86 Mich B J 32, 33\n       (March 2007) (emphasis in original). Similarly, a reduction in wages from\n       $5 an hour to $1 an hour is not a 4 percent reduction in wages; rather, it is\n       an 80 percent reduction in wages. [Id. at 196 (emphasis in the original).]\n\nAs I also observed in my concurring opinion in Stone, Justice CAVANAGH made this same\n\nmistake in his concurring opinion in Stone:\n\n              Like the Court of Appeals in Fulton, Justice CAVANAGH offers no\n       explanation as to why he repeatedly calculates the “lost opportunity” in\n       terms of the percentage points lost rather than the actual percentage lost\n       when MCL 600.2912a(2) clearly states that the “lost opportunity” must be\n       “greater than 50%,” not greater than 50 percentage points. These statistical\n       concepts are utterly distinct. [Id. at 196 n 11.]\n\nI am pleased that Justice CAVANAGH and the other justices who signed his opinion in\n\nStone (Chief Justice KELLY and Justice WEAVER) now apparently recognize this\n\nanalytical error, and that they now “repudiate” that position. Thus, a majority of the\n\njustices of this Court now agree that MCL 600.2912a(2) requires us to determine whether\n\nthe lost opportunity is “greater than 50%,” not whether the lost opportunity is greater than\n\n50 percentage points.\n\n       The other problem with Fulton, that Justice CAVANAGH and his colleagues in the\n\nmajority also now apparently recognize, is that “it does not differentiate between those\n\npatients who would have survived regardless of whether they received proper or improper\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\ftreatment and those patients who needed the proper treatment in order to survive.” Id. at\n\n197.5 As I observed in Stone:\n\n              Such a differentiation is necessary because only those in the latter\n       group have truly suffered a “lost opportunity” as a result of the improper\n       treatment. That is, if a patient would have survived regardless of whether\n       he received proper or improper treatment, the improper treatment cannot be\n       said to have caused him to lose an opportunity to survive. On the other\n       hand, if the patient would have survived only if he had received the proper\n       treatment, the improper treatment can be said to have caused him to lose an\n       opportunity to survive. MCL 600.2912a(2) requires us to determine\n       whether the patient more likely than not fell into the latter category rather\n       than the former category, because the statute only allows a plaintiff to\n       recover for a “loss of an opportunity” that was “greater than 50%” and that\n       was “caused by the negligence of the defendant . . . .” Dr. Waddell’s\n       calculation does just that:\n\n                   (Premalpractice chance) - (Postmalpractice chance)\n                             100-(Postmalpractice chance)\n\n       5\n          Although the majority describes their formula in considerably different terms\nthan I did in Stone, the same result is produced under either formula. That is, regardless\nof whether the formula is described as I do [(premalpractice chance of better result) -\n(postmalpractice chance of better result)]/[100 - (postmalpractice chance of better\nresult)], or, as the majority now does [(postmalpractice chance of worse result) -\n(premalpractice chance of worse result)]/[(postmalpractice chance of worse result)], the\nsame figure is obtained. Given Justice CAVANAGH’s forceful criticisms of my formula in\nStone, it is encouraging that we are now in agreement on this critical point. See, e.g.,\nStone, 482 Mich at 183-184 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting) (“the Waddell formula [which I\nadopted in Stone and to which I continue to adhere] is blatantly inconsistent with the\nlanguage of MCL 600.2912a(2)”; “[i]t is inconceivable that Justice MARKMAN can read\nthe [statute] and conclude that it should be translated into this formula”; “[t]he approach\ntaken by Justice MARKMAN and Dr. Waddell requires [the statute] to be rewritten”; “the\nWaddell approach leads to such anomalous results that it cannot possibly reflect the\nintention of the Legislature”). While Justice CAVANAGH is correct that he employs the\nformula to determine whether plaintiff’s cause of action is a traditional medical-\nmalpractice action or a lost-opportunity action, and I use it to determine whether plaintiff\nhas satisfied the greater-than-50-percent requirement, we agree nonetheless that the\nnumber produced by the formula represents the opportunity that the plaintiff lost as a\nresult of the defendant’s negligence.\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\fThe quotient resulting from this numerator and denominator is then\nmultiplied by 100 to obtain a percentage. This number must be “greater\nthan 50%” in order to satisfy the requirement of the second sentence of\nMCL 600.2912a(2). For instance, if the patient’s premalpractice chance to\nachieve a better result was 80 percent and, as a result of the defendant’s\nmalpractice, the patient’s postmalpractice chance is reduced to 20 percent,\nthe patient has suffered a 75 percent loss of an opportunity to survive.[6]\n\n        What the Waddell formula essentially does is test the sufficiency of\nthe expert testimony, which is typically presented in the form of two\nstatistics: the likelihood that a patient would have had a good outcome with\nproper treatment (the “[premalpractice chance]”) and the likelihood that a\npatient would have had a good outcome with negligent treatment (the\n“[postmalpractice chance]”). The Waddell formula allows a court analyzing\nthis data to determine whether the plaintiff, when the patient has\nexperienced a bad outcome, has created a question of material fact\nconcerning whether proper treatment more likely than not would have made\na difference. The formula does this by identifying the universe of patients\nwho would have had a bad outcome (the denominator) and the subset of\nthose patients who could have been favorably treated (the numerator).\n\n       It is easiest to start with the formula’s denominator. This\ndenominator consists of the universe of all patients who would have had a\nbad outcome, for whatever reason. This group includes two subsets of\npatients: those who would have had a bad outcome because they received\nnegligent treatment, and those who would have had a bad outcome despite\nreceiving proper treatment.        The formula identifies this group by\nsubtracting from 100 the percentage of patients who would have had a good\noutcome even without proper treatment; in other words, it subtracts the\n“[postmalpractice chance]” from 100. In this way, a court can take the\nexpert’s statistics and identify those patients who were not treated properly\nand who experienced a bad outcome. A patient who is the subject of a\nmedical-malpractice action is a member of this group. But we cannot\ndetermine whether the patient is a member of this group because he or she\nwas denied the proper treatment or because he or she would have suffered a\nbad outcome even with proper treatment.\n\n       One more calculation must then be made in order to answer the\ndispositive question posed by the statute: whether it is more likely than not\nthat the patient would have benefited from proper treatment or, put another\n\n6\n    [(80 - 20)/(100 -20)] x 100 = 75%.\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\fway, whether the “opportunity to survive or . . . to achieve a better result”\nwas “greater than 50%.” MCL 600.2912a(2). A court has to determine\nwhat percentage of those patients with a bad outcome (those patients in the\ndenominator) would have benefited from treatment. This brings us to the\nWaddell formula’s numerator. The numerator consists of those patients\nwho would have had a bad outcome only if they had been negligently\ntreated. It is calculated by subtracting the “[postmalpractice chance]” from\nthe “[premalpractice chance],” thus identifying those patients who required\ntreatment to avoid a bad outcome.\n\n        Once the numerator and denominator have been calculated,\ncomparison of these two numbers by their quotient allows a court to\nreasonably determine whether improper treatment more likely than not\nmade a difference in the patient’s outcome. If the number of patients who\nwould have had a bad outcome only if they had been negligently treated\n(the numerator) comprises more than half of the number of patients who\nwould have had a bad outcome overall (the denominator), then the plaintiff\nhas established that proper treatment more likely than not would have made\na difference. In other words, when this has been shown, the plaintiff has\ncreated a question of material fact concerning whether the “opportunity”--\nthe benefit that would have been realized by a group of patients from the\ntreatment that was not given to this specific patient-- was greater than 50\npercent. Such a plaintiff has presented adequate expert testimony to\nestablish a “lost opportunity” cause of action within the meaning of the\nstatute.\n\n      As Dr. Waddell has explained:\n\n       “[T]he intent of the law is to disallow damages unless it can be\nshown that proper treatment creates a better than even (“greater than\n50%”) chance of survival of the patients who would have died without\ntreatment. In other words, if appropriate treatment cannot save at least half\nof the patients who otherwise would have died, then you do not have\nsufficient evidence to show that the negligence made the difference in the\nadverse outcome (death). Conversely, if good treatment can save more\nthan half of the patients who otherwise would have died, then you have\nadequate evidence that the poor treatment or negligence was likely to blame\nfor the bad outcome. This is exactly what this definition of opportunity\nmeasures.” [Waddell, 86 Mich B J at 33 (emphasis in original).]\n\nMCL 600.2912a(2) only allows a plaintiff to recover for a “loss of an\nopportunity” that was “greater than 50%” and that was “caused by the\nnegligence of the defendant . . . .” Use of Dr. Waddell’s formula, which\ngenerates the actual percentage lost rather than the number of percentage\n\n\n                                     8\n\f       points lost, and excludes those who would have achieved a good result\n       regardless of the malpractice, best ensures, in my judgment, that these\n       statutory requirements are satisfied. That is, this calculation would impose\n       liability, in accordance with MCL 600.2912a(2), in those instances in\n       which the medical care received more likely than not affected whether the\n       patient survived. [Id. at 197-202.]\n\n                                    III. APPLICATION\n\n       In the instant case, plaintiff alleged that defendants failed to timely and properly\n\ntreat his acute chest syndrome, a serious complication of sickle-cell disease, and that, as a\n\nresult, he suffered a stroke. More specifically, plaintiff alleged that defendants should\n\nhave performed an exchange blood transfusion in which the patient’s abnormal blood is\n\ntaken out and replaced with normal blood, rather than a simple blood transfusion in\n\nwhich normal blood is simply added to the patient’s abnormal blood.7 Plaintiff’s expert\n\nwitness testified that there was a 10 to 20 percent chance of stroke without proper\n\ntreatment, but that with proper treatment there would have been only a 5 to 10 percent\n\nchance of stroke. In other words, with proper treatment plaintiff had a 90 to 95 or more\n\npercent chance of not suffering a stroke, and without proper treatment he had an 80 to 90\n\npercent chance of not suffering a stroke. That is, plaintiff’s premalpractice chance to\n\nachieve a better result was, at best, 95 percent, and his postmalpractice chance was, at\n\nworst, 80 percent.     Pursuant to the Waddell calculation, plaintiff lost a 75 percent\n\nopportunity to achieve a better result:\n\n\n       7\n        An exchange blood transfusion was not performed until after plaintiff suffered a\nstroke. As a result of the stroke, plaintiff suffers from partial paralysis of his left leg and\ncomplete loss of function of his left hand and arm.\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\f                          95 - 80 x 100 = 75%\n                         100 - 80\n\nTherefore, plaintiff has raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether he\n\nsuffered a greater than 50 percent loss of an opportunity under MCL 600.2912a(2). For\n\nthese reasons, I agree with the majority that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should\n\nbe reversed and this case should be remanded to the Court of Appeals for it to consider\n\ndefendants’ remaining issue on appeal, i.e., the admissibility of the expert witness\n\ntestimony proffered by plaintiff.\n\n                              IV. MAJORITY’S ANALYSIS\n\n       Although I agree with the majority that the Court of Appeals should be reversed, I\n\nstrongly disagree with its analysis.\n\n     A. LOST OPPORTUNITY VS. TRADITIONAL MEDICAL MALPRACTICE\n\n                 1. GREATER-THAN-50-PERCENT REQUIREMENT\n\n       On the one hand, the majority concludes that whether the plaintiff’s lost\n\nopportunity is greater than 50 percent determines whether the plaintiff’s action is a lost-\n\nopportunity action or a traditional medical-malpractice action. I find this conclusion to\n\nbe completely illogical. Either the defendant’s negligence has caused the plaintiff to\n\nsuffer the injury, or it has caused the plaintiff to suffer a loss of an opportunity to achieve\n\na better result-- the better result being not to suffer the injury. How substantial the\n\nplaintiff’s lost opportunity is determines whether he satisfies the “greater than 50%”\n\nrequirement of MCL 600.2912a(2), not whether the plaintiff’s action constitutes a lost-\n\nopportunity action in the first place. As I stated in Stone:\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\f              In order to satisfy traditional medical-malpractice action\n       requirements, there must be no question that the proper treatment would\n       have resulted in a good outcome (at least with regard to the specific injury\n       suffered by the patient), because if there is any chance that a patient who\n       received proper treatment might nevertheless have suffered the specific bad\n       outcome ultimately suffered by the patient, it cannot be proved that the\n       improper treatment caused the bad outcome. If there is any chance that the\n       proper treatment could have resulted in the bad outcome, the chances of a\n       good outcome with proper treatment and the chances of a good outcome\n       with improper treatment must be compared. That is, under those\n       circumstances, although the plaintiff cannot prove that the defendant’s\n       malpractice caused the bad outcome because the bad outcome might have\n       occurred even with proper treatment, the plaintiff may be able to prove that\n       the defendant’s malpractice increased the patient’s chances of obtaining a\n       bad outcome and, thus, caused him or her to suffer a “lost opportunity” to\n       achieve a better result. This is the only coherent concept of a “lost\n       opportunity” cause of action under MCL 600.2912a(2). [Stone, 482 Mich\n       at 271 (MARKMAN, J., concurring).]\n\nBecause it is possible that the bad outcome in this case, i.e., suffering a stroke, might\n\nhave occurred even if plaintiff had received proper treatment, the instant case constitutes\n\na lost-opportunity action.\n\n                             2. PLAINTIFF’S PLEADINGS\n\n       On the other hand, the lead opinion concludes that “the second sentence of\n\n§ 2912a(2) applies only to medical malpractice cases that plead loss of opportunity, and\n\nnot to those that plead traditional medical malpractice . . . .” That is, the lead opinion\n\nconcludes that whether the plaintiff’s action constitutes a lost-opportunity action or a\n\ntraditional medical-malpractice action is a function of whether the plaintiff has used the\n\nmagic words “lost opportunity” in his pleading. If he did not, the action is a traditional\n\nmedical-malpractice action and the plaintiff need not concern himself with satisfying the\n\ngreater-than-50-percent requirement of MCL 600.2912a(2). However, if the plaintiff did\n\n\n\n                                            11\n\fuse the words “lost opportunity” in his pleading, the action is a lost-opportunity action\n\nand the plaintiff must satisfy the greater-than-50-percent requirement of MCL\n\n600.2912a(2). Besides being utterly inconsistent with the majority’s own conclusion that\n\na lost opportunity greater than 50 percent determines whether the plaintiff’s action\n\nconstitutes a lost-opportunity action or a traditional medical-malpractice action, it is also\n\ninconsistent with the well-established principle that Michigan courts are “not bound by a\n\nparty’s choice of label for its action [because this would] put form over substance . . . .”\n\nSt. Paul Fire & Marine Ins Co v Littky, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1635624\"><a href=\"/opinion/1635624/st-paul-fire-marine-ins-co-v-littky/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.

Yet this is exactly what the lead\n\n\n                                             12\n\fopinion would allow a plaintiff to do in relation to the requirements of MCL\n\n600.2912a(2).    Apparently, according to the justices joining the lead opinion, all a\n\nplaintiff need do to avoid the “greater than 50%” requirement in MCL 600.2912a(2) is to\n\nomit the words “lost opportunity” in his complaint. Thus, no artfulness is even required\n\nto nullify this particular statute under their theory.\n\n       Indeed, in light of the lead opinion, the discussions in the various opinions in this\n\ncase concerning appropriate formulas for determining loss of opportunity seem pointless.\n\nFor what plaintiff, and what competent plaintiff’s attorney, would ever plead a lost-\n\nopportunity claim if it could be so easily avoided? Simply put, under the lead opinion’s\n\nrule, would the lost-opportunity doctrine enacted by the Legislature even continue to\n\nexist as a viable legal doctrine in this state? Would a court have any power to apply the\n\nactual law, or would it be required to participate in a charade of the plaintiff’s (and the\n\nlead opinion’s) making? As an example, could a public official plaintiff avoid having to\n\nprove actual malice in a defamation case by simply leaving the words “public official”\n\nout of his pleading? Could a plaintiff suing a public entity entitled to governmental\n\nimmunity avoid such immunity by simply omitting that the defendant is a public entity\n\nfrom his pleading? Could an independent contractor transmute himself into an employee\n\nby simply asserting such in his pleading?\n\n            B. WHICHEVER FORMULA BEST SERVES THE PLAINTIFF\n\n       The lead opinion offers no explanation, and I can think of none, to support its\n\nalternative “standard percentage increase calculation” formula, other than the fact the\n\njustices signing the lead opinion believe that it somehow indicates that plaintiff has\n\n\n                                               13\n\fsuffered a 300 percent loss of an opportunity! However, none of this really seems to\n\nmatter to the justices signing the lead opinion because in the end they conclude that MCL\n\n600.2912a(2) does not require “any particular mathematical formula,” and that if “either\n\ncalculation,” or, indeed, some other yet-to-be-discovered calculation, demonstrates a\n\ngreater than 50 percent lost opportunity, the plaintiff’s case may proceed, because “the\n\nresults must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.” This is\n\nsimply nonsensical. Although it is true that evidence is to be viewed in a light most\n\nfavorable to the non-moving party, Dressel v Ameribank, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"848793\"><a href=\"/opinion/848793/dressel-v-ameribank/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">557</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 561; 664 NW2d\n\n151 (2003), which, as in this case, will almost invariably be the plaintiff, this is the first I\n\nhave heard of a judicially created rule that we are to construe an unambiguous law in a\n\nlight most favorable to one side or the other. Needless to say, and for reasons that are\n\napparent, the lead opinion does not bother to cite any authority in support of such a rule.\n\nIs there some logical reason for this rule other than an apparent desire by the lead justices\n\nto place a finger on the scales of justice on behalf of the plaintiff class? Is this rule\n\nlimited to lost-opportunity cases or is it equally applicable to all medical-malpractice\n\nactions? Why is such a rule appropriate in a lost-opportunity case, but not in other realms\n\nof the civil law? When is such a default interpretation of the law warranted, and when is\n\nit not? If the law does not require “any particular formula,” why does the lead opinion\n\ndevote such attention to identifying the two formulas that it does identify? Why not just\n\ndevise a third formula under which the plaintiff will always prevail? Could it possibly be\n\n\n\n\n                                              14\n\fthat the lead justices may be confusing their own personal political philosophies with the\n\ndictates of the actual law that they pledged to uphold?8\n\n                                   V. CONCLUSION\n\n       As I summarized in Stone:\n\n              A “lost opportunity” action is one in which it is possible that the bad\n       outcome would have occurred even if the patient had received proper\n       treatment. On the other hand, if there is no question that the proper\n       treatment would have resulted in a good outcome and the patient has\n       suffered a bad outcome, the plaintiff possesses a traditional medical-\n       malpractice action. In order for a traditional medical-malpractice plaintiff\n       to prevail, the plaintiff must prove that the bad outcome was more probably\n       than not caused by the defendant’s malpractice. In order for a “lost\n       opportunity” plaintiff to prevail, the plaintiff must prove that the “lost\n       opportunity” to achieve a better result was more probably than not caused\n       by the defendant’s malpractice and that the “lost opportunity” was greater\n       than 50 percent. In order to determine whether the “lost opportunity” was\n       greater than 50 percent, the postmalpractice chance of obtaining a better\n       result must be subtracted from the premalpractice chance; the\n       postmalpractice chance must then be subtracted from 100; the former\n       number must be divided by the latter number; and then this quotient must\n       be multiplied by 100 to obtain a percentage. The calculation can be\n       summarized as follows:\n\n       8\n         The lead opinion indicates that the justices signing that opinion now support\n“Justice CAVANAGH’s dissent in Wickens [v Oakwood Healthcare Sys, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 631\nNW2d 686 (2001)] that a living person may pursue a claim for loss of opportunity under\nthe circumstances presented in that case.” What this gratuitous observation has to do\nwith the instant case, I have not a clue. Do the justices signing the lead opinion also\nsupport Justice CAVANAGH’s dissent in People v Gardner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 753 NW2d 78\n(2008), or any one of his other random dissents? Given that three justices previously\nsupported Justices CAVANAGH’s dissent (Chief Justice KELLY, and Justices CAVANAGH\nand WEAVER), by indicating that she now supports Wickens, Justice HATHAWAY seems\nto be signaling that there is now majority support in favor of such dissent. Unfortunately,\nthis type of behavior seems to have become the new majority’s modus operandi--\nunnecessarily sowing uncertainty, doubt and confusion into the law by gratuitously\nquestioning prior cases decided by the former majority. For more discussion on this, see\nmy dissent in McCormick v Carrier, __ Mich __; __ NW2d __ (2010).\n\n\n\n                                            15\n\f                    (Premalpractice chance) - (Postmalpractice chance)\n                             100 - (Postmalpractice chance)\n\n       If this percentage is greater than 50, the plaintiff may be able to prevail; if\n       this percentage is 50 or less, then the plaintiff cannot prevail. [Stone, 482\n       Mich at 218-219 (MARKMAN, J., concurring).][9]\n\n       As discussed earlier, because it is possible that the bad outcome in this case, i.e.,\n\nsuffering a stroke, would have occurred even if plaintiff had received proper treatment,\n\nthe instant case is, in fact, a lost-opportunity action, and because plaintiff has raised a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact regarding whether he suffered a greater than 50 percent loss\n\nof an opportunity under MCL 600.2912a, I agree with the majority that the judgment of\n\nthe Court of Appeals should be reversed and this case should be remanded to the Court of\n\nAppeals for it to consider defendants’ remaining issue on appeal, i.e., the admissibility of\n\nthe expert witness testimony proffered by plaintiff.\n\n       However, I emphatically disagree with the majority’s incoherent analysis and the\n\nimplications of such analysis. The majority effectively transforms a lost-opportunity\n\naction into a traditional medical-malpractice action, for no other apparent reason than to\n\nafford plaintiffs with larger potential recoveries. Instead of limiting a plaintiff’s recovery\n\n\n       9\n         However, the present status of the law seems to be, pursuant to the lead opinion\nand Justice CAVANAGH’s concurring opinion, that if the plaintiff’s lost opportunity is\ngreater than 50 percent (the calculation of which is anyone’s guess in view of the\ndifferent tests of these two opinions), the plaintiff can bring a traditional medical-\nmalpractice action, but, if the plaintiff’s lost opportunity is not greater than 50 percent,\nthen the plaintiff can only bring a lost-opportunity action. And, pursuant to Fulton, a\nlost-opportunity plaintiff must prove that the difference between his premalpractice\nchance of achieving a better result and his postmalpractice chance of achieving a better\nresult is greater than 50 percentage points. Neither of these conclusions is, to say the\nleast, consistent with my own reading of the statute.\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\fto the opportunity that he or she may have lost as a result of the defendant’s negligence,\n\nthe majority now expands the plaintiff’s recovery to include potentially all damages\n\nrelated to his medical condition, even though the plaintiff may well have suffered the\n\ncondition even had he received perfect medical treatment.          Thus, having already\n\nundermined the Legislature’s attempt at medical-malpractice reform, see e.g., Bush v\n\nShabahang, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"836245\"><a href=\"/opinion/836245/bush-v-shabahang/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 772 NW2d 272 (2009); Potter v McLeary, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1665997\"><a href=\"/opinion/1665997/potter-v-mcleary/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">397</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 774\n\nNW2d 1 (2009); and ADM File No. 2009-13, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"831906\"><a href=\"/opinion/831906/dept-of-agriculture-v-appletree-marketing/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">__, __ (order entered February\n\n16, 2010), the majority now embarks upon transforming medical-malpractice law in\n\nexactly the opposite direction of that sought by the Legislature.

Not only will we not neglect\n      our duties, we will not sleep on the bench.[1]\n\n\n\n\n      1\n         She Said, Detroit Free Press, December 10, 2008, p 2A. Chief Justice KELLY\nobjects that I “continue to quote and misleadingly characterize a statement [she] made\nnearly two years ago off the bench.” Ante at ___ (KELLY, C.J., concurring). As my\ndissenting opinion in Univ of Michigan Regents v Titan Ins Co, ___ Mich ___; ___\nNW2d ___ (2010) (YOUNG, J., dissenting), explains at length, my characterization of her\nstatement is not misleading. Chief Justice KELLY’s remarks both set an agenda for\nundoing the precedents of the previous 10 years and are especially mean-spirited in light\nof the political attacks against former Chief Justice TAYLOR during the 2008 campaign.\n\fThere are many cases this term that can be said to exemplify the new majority's\n\ncommitment to “undo . . . the damage” of the prior majority, but this case certainly\n\nqualifies as a first among equals. Here, not only do my colleagues in the “new majority”\n\ndestroy the doctrinal integrity of medical malpractice law, they do so in highly fractured\n\nopinions that will require a Venn diagram for the bench and bar to construct the points at\n\nwhich four of them agree on any governing principle of law. The new majority has thus\n\nmade it more difficult to determine what it has done today. Perhaps this is intended.\n\n        Chaos and confusion in the law only promote more litigation. The decisions the\n\nnew majority has issued today in this case will thus benefit only those who profit from\n\nlitigating medical malpractice cases. The rest of us desire to know what legal rules\n\ncontrol our rights and obligations, and we desire and deserve to know them before we\n\nact. The citizens of this state are entitled to that kind of clarity in the decisions from the\n\nstate’s senior court, not the disorder this Court has sown today. Today’s decision returns\n\nthis Court to an era in which the bench and bar must decipher this Court’s split opinions\n\nin order to figure out what principles of law they collectively articulate.2 It is no small\n\nchallenge to respond in dissent to the various opinions that shred our medical malpractice\n\nlaws.\n\n\n\n\n        2\n        See, e.g., Smith v Dep’t of Pub Health, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1250599\"><a href=\"/opinion/1250599/smith-v-dept-of-public-health/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">540</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 410 NW2d 749 (1987), for\na model case in the same chaotic vein as today’s split decisions.

But, unlike in\n\nFalcon, the new majority here does not recognize merely an exception to the traditional\n\n      3\n          </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">PA</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n      4\n          Falcon v Mem Hosp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2212458\"><a href=\"/opinion/2212458/falcon-v-memorial-hosp/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 462 NW2d 44 (1990).\n      5\n          See MCL 600.2912a, as amended by </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">PA</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n      6\n          MCL 600.2912a(2).\n      7\n        Skinner v Square D Co, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1864721\"><a href=\"/opinion/1864721/skinner-v-square-d-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 166; 516 NW2d 475 (1994) (citation\nomitted).\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\fmalpractice requirement of “but for” causation, it essentially eliminates the traditional\n\nrule entirely by importing that exception into all malpractice cases. In declaring this case\n\nto be a “traditional” medical malpractice claim, the new majority applies the relaxed\n\ncausation rules that previously had applied only to lost opportunity claims. After today,\n\ntherefore, all malpractice claims will be treated under relaxed causation principles\n\npreviously applied only to lost opportunity claims. This is a tectonic shift in our law, for\n\nwhich there is no basis but the preference of the justices in the new majority to foster\n\nmore legal chaos that will promote litigation in this area of the law. This shift is\n\nsignificant because a traditional medical malpractice injury creates liability for the entire\n\ninjury, while a lost opportunity claim creates liability only for that portion of the\n\nincreased risk of injury attributable to a defendant.8 Make no mistake: Although Justice\n\nCAVANAGH feigns that he is unaware of the significant change in the law being made in\n\nthis case, the reduced burden of persuasion and the broader scope of damages permitted\n\nis the reason the new majority now applies lost opportunity causation principles to all\n\nmedical malpractice claims.9\n\n       Rather than attempting to give meaning to the words of the statute at issue in this\n\ncase, the new majority performs a spectacularly hubristic feat in treating a statutory\n\n       8\n        See Falcon, 436 Mich at 471 (opinion by LEVIN, J.) (“In this case, 37.5 percent\ntimes the damages recoverable for wrongful death would be an appropriate measure of\ndamages.”).\n       9\n        See n 52 of this opinion for further elaboration on the significance of Justice\nCAVANAGH’s repudiation of the position he took just two years ago in Stone v\nWilliamson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 175-177; 753 NW2d 106 (2008) (opinion by CAVANAGH, J.).\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\fmedical malpractice claim as though it were a mere matter of common law and thus\n\nsubject to its revisionary powers. What is more, these justices have decided to use those\n\nextraconstitutional powers to circumvent the Legislature’s explicit decision to retain\n\ntraditional causation rules. The new majority has chosen “free form” to change the law to\n\nmatch its policy preference that no legal doctrines shall exist to eliminate any claim of\n\nmedical malpractice—even those doctrines codified by our Legislature to accomplish this\n\nvery goal.\n\n       For someone who campaigned on the theme that more of this Court’s precedent\n\nshould be preserved,10 we are surprised at how eagerly Justice HATHAWAY has striven in\n\nthis case to overturn precedent—even to the extent of offering her own new views that\n\nprecedent is not a serious barrier to any change desired by the new majority.11\n\n       The dicta in Justice HATHAWAY’s opinion bears out her newfound position on\n\nstare decisis because her opinion purports to opine on “the full scope and extent of loss-\n\nof-opportunity claims,”12 even while denying that such a claim is involved in this case.\n\nIn doing so, Justice HATHAWAY engages in a completely gratuitous assault on this\n       10\n          Berg, Hathaway attacks, Michigan Lawyers Weekly, October 27, 2008\n(“‘People need to know what the law is,’ Hathaway said. ‘I believe in stare decisis.\nSomething must be drastically wrong for the court to overrule.’”); Lawyers’ election\nguide: Judge Diane Marie Hathaway, Michigan Lawyers Weekly, October 30, 2006\n(quoting Justice HATHAWAY, then running for a position on the Court of Appeals, as\nsaying that “[t]oo many appellate decisions are being decided by judicial activists who\nare overturning precedent”).\n       11\n        See, e.g., Univ of Mich Regents v Titan Ins Co, ___ Mich ___, ___; ___ NW2d\n___ (2010) (HATHAWAY, J., concurring).\n       12\n            Ante at ___ (opinion by HATHAWAY, J.).\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\fCourt’s decision in Wickens v Oakwood Healthcare Sys.13 Wickens involved a claim for\n\nthe lost opportunity to survive, and it was brought by a living plaintiff—someone who\n\nhad not yet lost her opportunity to survive. No justice even contends that plaintiff in this\n\ncase has asserted a claim for the lost opportunity to survive, and therefore it is completely\n\nunnecessary for Justice HATHAWAY to opine on whether the majority or dissent correctly\n\ninterpreted the question whether a living plaintiff could recover for the loss of an\n\nopportunity to survive.\n\n       Ordinarily, this fact would hinder any justice from engaging in a discussion on the\n\nscope of a claim for the lost opportunity to survive that is not implicated in the case\n\nbefore the Court. Justice HATHAWAY, though, is not constrained to consider only the\n\nlegal issues she claims are involved here because, consistent with the new majority’s\n\n“agenda,”14 she has a desire to overrule in one fell swoop as many cases decided by the\n\n“Republican-dominated court” as she can. Unfazed by the inconvenient fact that Wickens\n\nis irrelevant to any question posed by this case, Justice HATHAWAY’s opinion observes\n\nthat it “agree[s] with Justice CAVANAGH’S partial dissent in Wickens . . . .”15 Such dicta\n\ndo not yet operate to overturn this Court’s decision in Wickens. Nevertheless, given that\n\nJustice HATHAWAY is now the fourth sitting justice on this Court to support the partial\n\n\n\n\n       13\n            Wickens v Oakwood Healthcare Sys, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 631 NW2d 686 (2001).\n       14\n            See the text accompanying n 1 of this opinion.\n       15\n            Ante at ___ (opinion by HATHAWAY, J.).\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\fdissenting opinion in Wickens, it is safe to conclude that the majority opinion in Wickens\n\nhas, more probably than not, lost a substantial part of its opportunity to survive.16\n\n       Finally, the new majority overrules the Court of Appeals decision in Fulton v\n\nWilliam Beaumont Hosp to the extent it is inconsistent with their opinions.17 However,\n\nagain, the new majority overreaches; Fulton applies only to lost opportunity cases, not to\n\ntraditional medical malpractice cases, and the new majority’s decision to convert claims\n\npreviously considered lost opportunity claims into traditional medical malpractice claims\n\nserves to eliminate the application of Fulton. The new majority’s deliberate decision to\n\nrepudiate Fulton in this expansive manner, provides further support for my claim that it\n\nnow applies lost opportunity principles to all medical malpractice claims.\n\n       For these reasons and more, I vigorously dissent. I believe that the new majority\n\nhas intentionally mischaracterized this as a “traditional” medical malpractice claim\n\nbecause plaintiff’s expert testimony unquestionably established that the alleged\n\nmalpractice was not the “but for” cause of plaintiff’s injury. Were the new majority’s\n\ncharacterization of this case as a traditional medical malpractice claim accurate, I would\n\naffirm for failure of proofs. However, because I believe this to be a lost opportunity case,\n\n\n       16\n         One could read this dicta in Justice HATHAWAY’s opinion as a signal that the\nnew majority will overrule Wickens.

I continue to adhere to the position stated in the lead opinion in Stone v\n\nWilliamson that the second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) codifying the lost opportunity\n\nremedy is unenforceable as enacted.18 Because the Legislature has not clarified the\n\nintention of its 1993 amendment of § 2912a(2), vacating the grant order is the most\n\nappropriate course of action.\n\n                          I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       Because none of the opinions that collectively create a majority elaborates on the\n\nfacts necessary to decide this case, I present the following complete recitation of the\n\npertinent facts and procedural history of this case.\n\n       Plaintiff, Raymond O’Neal, suffers from sickle cell anemia, a genetic condition\n\nthat produces an increased amount of abnormally shaped red blood cells in his\n\nbloodstream.19 In January 2003, plaintiff’s progressively worsening chest pain developed\n\ninto acute chest syndrome (ACS), a known complication of sickle cell anemia.20 To treat\n\nACS, a patient must undergo blood transfusions to reduce the amount of abnormal red\n\nblood cells.       The difference between and effectiveness of two types of blood\n\ntransfusions—standard transfusions and exchange transfusions—is at issue in this case.\n\nStandard transfusions add healthy red blood cells to the patient’s existing blood supply\n       18\n            Stone, 482 Mich at 144 (opinion by TAYLOR, C.J.).\n       19\n        Beers & Berkow, eds, The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy (17th ed)\n(Whitehouse Station, NJ: Merck & Co, Inc, 1999), pp 877-878.\n       20\n            Id. at 879.\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\fand thereby reduce the patient’s percentage of abnormal red blood cells. Exchange\n\ntransfusions are more complicated, but they also more aggressively treat the blood\n\nabnormality because they physically remove existing abnormal red blood cells and\n\nreplace them with healthy red blood cells.\n\n       On January 23 through 24, 2003, plaintiff received a standard transfusion of three\n\nunits of blood cells. He received two additional units of blood cells in another standard\n\ntransfusion on January 28, 2003. Plaintiff suffered a stroke on the right side of his brain\n\non February 1, 2003. Plaintiff received a third transfusion—an exchange transfusion—on\n\nFebruary 2 through 3, 2003. Plaintiff’s condition stabilized after this final transfusion,\n\nbut he alleged permanent injury as a result of the stroke, including partial paralysis of his\n\nleft leg and loss of function of his left hand and arm.\n\n       Plaintiff filed the instant medical malpractice complaint, alleging that defendants\n\nfailed to comply with the appropriate standard of care, which required them to “arrange\n\nfor exchange transfusions” to treat plaintiff’s ACS on or before January 28, 2003. He\n\nalso alleged that “[p]erformance of [an] exchange transfusion prior to the . . . stroke\n\nwould have prevented the stroke from occurring.”\n\n       Plaintiff retained and deposed three expert witnesses to testify on his behalf on the\n\nissue of causation. Dr. John Luce, a pulmonary care specialist, testified that reducing\n\nplaintiff’s abnormal hemoglobin count to under 30 percent would have made it “probable\n\nthat he would not have” suffered the stroke, although he acknowledged that plaintiff still\n\ncould have suffered the stroke even with such a reduced abnormal hemoglobin count.\n\nBecause no data existed on the frequency of strokes in adult sickle cell patients, Dr.\n\n\n                                              9\n\fRichard Stein, a hematologist, extrapolated from existing data on the effects of aggressive\n\ntransfusion therapy on children with sickle cell disease. He testified that “more likely\n\nthan not” plaintiff would have avoided a stroke if he had received aggressive transfusion\n\ntherapy, what plaintiff alleged is the appropriate standard of care. Dr. Griffin Rodgers,\n\nalso a hematologist, provided the most detailed testimony regarding the causal\n\nrelationships between the stroke, plaintiff’s underlying medical condition, and\n\ndefendants’ alleged malpractice. He explained that sickle cell patients generally have a\n\nbaseline risk of stroke that is significantly higher than the average population. Moreover,\n\nplaintiff’s ACS further increased his baseline risk of stroke to between 10 and 20 percent.\n\nDr. Rodgers testified that, with aggressive transfusion therapy, the plaintiff’s risk of\n\nstroke would have “been cut in half,” that is, to between 5 and 10 percent. Stated\n\notherwise, plaintiff’s opportunity to avoid a stroke would have been between 90 and 95\n\npercent with aggressive transfusion therapy, but it was reduced to between 80 and 90\n\npercent without aggressive transfusion therapy. Thus, under either treatment regime,\n\nplaintiff’s experts testified that it was more likely than not that plaintiff would avoid a\n\nstroke.\n\n          Defendants moved for summary disposition, arguing that Dr. Rodgers’s testimony\n\nregarding plaintiff’s lost opportunity to avoid a stroke failed to satisfy the requirement of\n\nMCL 600.2912a(2)21 and Fulton v William Beaumont Hosp,22 that the opportunity to\n\n          21\n         MCL 600.2912a(2) provides, in pertinent part: “In an action alleging medical\nmalpractice, the plaintiff cannot recover for loss of an opportunity to survive or an\nopportunity to achieve a better result unless the opportunity was greater than 50%.”\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\fachieve a better result must decrease by more than 50 percentage points. The trial court\n\ndenied defendants’ motion, noting that defendants “[didn’t] have a clue about what\n\n[Fulton] says.”\n\n       After the Court of Appeals denied defendants’ interlocutory application for leave\n\nto appeal, in lieu of granting leave to appeal, we remanded this case to the Court of\n\nAppeals for consideration as on leave granted.23 On remand, the Court of Appeals\n\nreversed the trial court’s denial of summary disposition in an unpublished opinion per\n\ncuriam.24 The majority opinion held that plaintiff’s claim was a lost opportunity claim,\n\nthat Fulton required the loss of opportunity to be greater than 50 percentage points, and\n\nthat the loss of opportunity here was, at most, 15 percentage points. The concurring\n\nopinion concluded that plaintiff also failed to present sufficient evidence of proximate\n\ncausation because his “preexisting medical condition” precluded him from satisfying “his\n\nburden of establishing the existence of a genuine factual dispute concerning whether\n\ndefendants’ alleged professional negligence ‘more probably tha[n] not’ proximately\n\ncaused his stroke.”25\n\n       We granted leave to appeal and directed the parties to brief:\n\n\n\n       22\n            Fulton v William Beaumont Hosp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1659357\"><a href=\"/opinion/1659357/fulton-v-pontiac-general-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">253</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.

LEGAL BACKGROUND\n\n      The lead opinion in Stone aptly summarized the pertinent legal background\n\nrelevant to this case, including the distinction between traditional malpractice claims and\n\nlost opportunity claims that the majority now eviscerates:\n\n             In the first Michigan case to refer to the legal theory of “the value of\n      lost chance,” the Court of Appeals explained: “This theory is potentially\n      available in situations where a plaintiff cannot prove that a defendant’s\n      actions were the cause of his injuries, but can prove that the defendant’s\n      actions deprived him of a chance to avoid those injuries.” Vitale v Reddy,\n      </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1878104\"><a href=\"/opinion/1878104/vitale-v-reddy/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 502; 389 NW2d 456 (1986). The Court in Vitale noted\n      that allowing such claims would expand existing common law, and it\n      declined to do so, stating that such a decision “is best left to either the\n      Supreme Court or the Legislature.” Id. at 504. . . .\n\n              In accord with this analysis, this Court has stated: “The lost\n      opportunity doctrine allows a plaintiff to recover when the defendant’s\n      negligence possibly, i.e., [by] a probability of fifty percent or less, caused\n      the plaintiff’s injury.” Weymers v Khera, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1877633\"><a href=\"/opinion/1877633/weymers-v-khera/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">639</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 648; 563 NW2d\n      647 (1997) (emphasis added). The Weymers Court aptly described the lost-\n      opportunity doctrine as “the antithesis of proximate cause.” Id. In cases in\n      which the plaintiff alleges that the defendant’s negligence more probably\n      than not caused the injury, the claim is one of simple medical malpractice.\n      Id. at 647-648.\n\n             In Falcon v Mem Hosp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2212458\"><a href=\"/opinion/2212458/falcon-v-memorial-hosp/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 462 NW2d 44 (1990), this\n      Court first recognized a claim for lost opportunity to survive. Falcon was a\n      wrongful-death case in which this Court allowed a claim to go forward\n\n      26\n           O’Neal v St John Hosp & Med Ctr, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">901</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2009).\n\n\n\n                                            12\n\feven though the plaintiff’s granddaughter would have had only a 37.5\npercent chance of surviving a medical accident had she received proper\ncare. Because proper medical procedures had not been followed, the\ngranddaughter’s chance of surviving the accident went to essentially zero.\nThe lead opinion in Falcon admitted that the plaintiff could not show that\nthe malpractice had more likely than not caused her granddaughter’s death,\nbut could show that it had caused her granddaughter to lose a “substantial\nopportunity of avoiding physical harm.” Id. at 470 (LEVIN, J.). The lead\nopinion disavowed the traditional rule that requires a plaintiff to show that,\nbut for the defendant’s negligence, the patient would not have suffered the\nphysical harm, saying that the “more probable than not standard, as well as\nother standards of causation, are analytic devices—tools to be used in\nmaking causation judgments.” Id. at 451. Instead, despite the fact that the\nplaintiff could not show that the doctor’s malpractice had more probably\nthan not caused her granddaughter’s death, the plaintiff had a claim because\nthe malpractice did cause her granddaughter harm. The 37.5 percent\nchance for a better outcome was “hardly the kind of opportunity that any of\nus would willingly allow our health care providers to ignore.” Id. at 460.\nThis harm occurred before the granddaughter’s death, at the moment\n“[w]hen, by reason of the failure to implement [certain] procedures,” she\nwas denied any opportunity of living. Id. at 469, 471 n 44. The lead\nopinion characterized its holding as requiring the plaintiff to show, more\nprobably than not, that the malpractice reduced the opportunity of avoiding\nharm: “failure to protect [the granddaughter’s] opportunity of living.” Id. at\n469. Loss of her 37.5 percent opportunity of living, the lead opinion stated,\n“constitutes a loss of a substantial opportunity of avoiding physical harm.”\nId. at 470.\n\n        The lead opinion in Falcon thus concluded that the loss-of-\nopportunity claim accrued not when the patient died, but at the moment she\nwent from having a 37.5 [percent] chance of survival to having no chance\nof survival. Under this theory, a plaintiff would have a cause of action\nindependent of that for the physical injury and could recover for the\nmalpractice that caused the plaintiff to go from a class of patients having a\n“good chance” to one having a “bad chance.” Without this analysis, the\nplaintiff in Falcon would not have had a viable claim because it could not\nhave been shown that the defendant more probably than not caused the\nphysical injury. Until Falcon, medical-malpractice plaintiffs alleging that\nthe defendant’s act or omission hastened or worsened the injury (such as by\nfailing to diagnose a condition) had to prove that the defendant’s\nmalpractice more probably than not was the proximate cause of the injury.\nSee, e.g., Morgan v Taylor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2110210\"><a href=\"/opinion/2110210/morgan-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">180</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 451 NW2d 852 (1990);\n\n\n\n                                     13\n\fNaccarato v Grob, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1807231\"><a href=\"/opinion/1807231/naccarato-v-grob/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 252; 180 NW2d 788 (1970); Skeffington\nv Bradley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2142506\"><a href=\"/opinion/2142506/skeffington-v-bradley/\"><span class=\"volume\">366</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">552</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 115 NW2d 303 (1962).\n\n       When the Court decided Falcon, MCL 600.2912a read:\n\n       “In an action alleging malpractice the plaintiff shall have the burden\nof proving that in light of the state of the art existing at the time of the\nalleged malpractice:\n\n        “(a) The defendant, if a general practitioner, failed to provide the\nplaintiff the recognized standard of acceptable professional practice in the\ncommunity in which the defendant practices or in a similar community, and\nthat as a proximate result of the defendant failing to provide that standard,\nthe plaintiff suffered an injury.\n\n        “(b) The defendant, if a specialist, failed to provide the recognized\nstandard of care within that specialty as reasonably applied in light of the\nfacilities available in the community or other facilities reasonably available\nunder the circumstances, and as a proximate result of the defendant failing\nto provide that standard, the plaintiff suffered an injury.”\n\n        Three years after Falcon, the Legislature enacted </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">PA</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\namending MCL 600.2912a to add the second subsection.

Both subsection 1(a) and\n      subsection 1(b) require the plaintiff to show that, “as a proximate result of\n      the defendant failing to provide [the appropriate standard of practice or\n      care], the plaintiff suffered an injury.” Further, the Legislature added\n      subsection 2. Specifically, the first sentence of this new subsection codifies\n      and reiterates the common-law requirement that a plaintiff show that the\n      defendant’s malpractice more probably than not caused the plaintiff’s\n      injury. The second sentence of subsection 2 adds that, in medical-\n      malpractice cases, a “plaintiff cannot recover for loss of an opportunity to\n      survive or an opportunity to achieve a better result unless the opportunity\n      was greater than 50%.” However, one must keep in mind that the relevant\n      caselaw when subsection 2 was enacted held that the lost-opportunity\n      doctrine applies “in situations where a plaintiff cannot prove that a\n      defendant’s actions were the cause of his injuries . . . .” Vitale, [150 Mich\n      App] at 502 (emphasis added). That is, the first sentence of subsection 2\n      requires plaintiffs in every medical-malpractice case to show the\n      defendant’s malpractice proximately caused the injury while, at the same\n      time, the second sentence refers to cases in which such proof not only is\n      unnecessary, but is impossible.[27]\n\n      Thus, in contrast with traditional malpractice claims, the very nature of the lost\n\nopportunity doctrine allows a plaintiff to recover in the absence of proximate causation\n\nbetween the alleged malpractice and the physical injury suffered. The lead opinion in\n\nStone determined that “the two sentences of subsection 2 create a paradox, allowing\n\n\n\n\n      27\n           Stone, 482 Mich at 152-157 (opinion by TAYLOR, C.J.).\n\n\n\n                                           15\n\fclaims in the second sentence while precluding them by the first sentence.”28 In this case,\n\nJustice HATHAWAY’s opinion and Justice CAVANAGH’s concurring opinion altogether\n\navoid the implications of this paradox by essentially applying the lost opportunity\n\nanalysis (which never required “but for” causation) to a traditional medical malpractice\n\nclaim that, until today, always required “but for” causation. In doing so, the new\n\nmajority radically alters proximate causation doctrine by casting aside the traditional\n\ncomponent of “but for” causation and by replacing causation of the injury with\n\nconsideration only of the increased risk of the injury. This is a revolutionary change in\n\nour law and represents a change that not even the Falcon Court dared to make.\n\n       A necessary component of proximate causation is “but for” causation, or causation\n\nin fact.29 As this Court has previously held:\n\n              As a matter of logic, a court must find that the defendant’s\n       negligence was a cause in fact of the plaintiff’s injuries before it can hold\n       that the defendant’s negligence was the proximate or legal cause of those\n       injuries.\n\n              Generally, an act or omission is a cause in fact of an injury only if\n       the injury could not have occurred without (or “but for”) that act or\n       omission. While a plaintiff need not prove that an act or omission was the\n       sole catalyst for his injuries, he must introduce evidence permitting the jury\n       to conclude that the act or omission was a cause.\n\n             It is important to bear in mind that a plaintiff cannot satisfy this\n       burden by showing only that the defendant may have caused his injuries.\n       Our case law requires more than a mere possibility or a plausible\n\n       28\n            Id. at 157.\n       29\n        Weymers v Khera, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1877633\"><a href=\"/opinion/1877633/weymers-v-khera/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">639</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 647; 563 NW2d 647 (1997), citing Skinner,\n445 Mich at 162-163.\n\n\n\n                                            16\n\f      explanation. Rather, a plaintiff establishes that the defendant’s conduct was\n      a cause in fact of his injuries only if he “set[s] forth specific facts that\n      would support a reasonable inference of a logical sequence of cause and\n      effect.”[30]\n\n      As Justice CAVANAGH has himself previously concluded, plaintiffs must present\n\nevidence of proximate causation that “‘must exclude other reasonable hypotheses with a\n\nfair amount of certainty.’”31 By allowing plaintiff’s claim to proceed as a traditional\n\nmedical malpractice claim, the new majority today eviscerates the distinction between the\n\nweaker causation allowed in lost opportunity claims and the “but for” causation that has\n\nalways been required in traditional medical malpractice claims.\n\n                                   III. APPLICATION\n\n          A. PLAINTIFF ASSERTED A LOST OPPORTUNITY CLAIM\n       BECAUSE THERE IS NO “BUT FOR” CAUSATION BETWEEN THE\n      ALLEGED MALPRACTICE AND THE PHYSICAL INJURY SUFFERED.\n\n      As stated, the crux of a lost opportunity claim is that a plaintiff cannot show that,\n\nmore probably than not, the alleged malpractice proximately caused his injuries. This is\n\nbecause a plaintiff need only show that the alleged malpractice merely reduced his\n\nopportunity to achieve a better result. Accordingly, whether a claim is a traditional\n\nmalpractice claim or a claim for the loss of an opportunity to achieve a better result\n\ndepends on whether the alleged malpractice proximately caused the alleged injury.\n\n\n\n\n      30\n          Craig v Oakwood Hosp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2108736\"><a href=\"/opinion/2108736/craig-ex-rel-craig-v-oakwood-hosp/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 87; 684 NW2d 296 (2004), quoting\nSkinner, 445 Mich at 174.\n      31\n           Skinner, 445 Mich at 166 (CAVANAGH, C.J.) (citation omitted).\n\n\n\n                                            17\n\f       Contrary to the new majority’s position, this case presents a prototypical lost\n\nopportunity claim because no proximate causation exists between the alleged malpractice\n\nand plaintiff’s physical injury. Plaintiff’s experts testified that plaintiff’s underlying\n\nmedical condition—sickle cell anemia complicated by ACS—increased his risk of stroke\n\nabove that of a healthy person and even above that of a sickle cell patient who has not\n\ndeveloped ACS. Plaintiff’s underlying medical condition created a heightened chance of\n\nsuffering a stroke, with or without the alleged malpractice. As Dr. Rogers, who provided\n\nthe most detail of plaintiff’s causation experts, testified, plaintiff would have had a 5 to\n\n10 percent chance of suffering a stroke even if he had been treated according to the\n\nplaintiff’s proposed standard of care.\n\n       The evidence here, therefore, does not “‘exclude other reasonable hypotheses\n\n[of the cause of injury] with a fair amount of certainty,’”32 as is required to prove “but\n\nfor” causation in a traditional medical malpractice action. Plaintiff’s expert testified that,\n\nin the absence of the alleged medical malpractice, plaintiff had between a 90 percent and\n\n95 percent chance of avoiding a stroke.         The alleged medical malpractice reduced\n\nplaintiff’s chance of avoiding a stroke to between 80 percent and 90 percent. Even\n\nlooking at the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, there is no basis for a\n\nfact-finder to conclude that defendants’ actions more probably than not caused plaintiff’s\n\ninjury. But this is unimportant because the new majority now only requires causation for\n\nthe increased risk of injury.\n\n       32\n            Id.

THE CONCLUSION THAT PLAINTIFF HAS ASSERTED A TRADITIONAL\nMEDICAL MALPRACTICE CLAIM AND HAS SATISFIED THE REQUIREMENTS\n     OF “BUT FOR” CAUSATION IS A DANGEROUS DEPARTURE FROM\n              TRADITIONAL CAUSATION REQUIREMENTS.\n\n         As stated, in determining that plaintiff’s claim is a traditional medical malpractice\n\nclaim, the new majority today applies relaxed causation rules that previously had applied\n\nonly to lost opportunity claims—claims involving an increased risk of injury that did not\n\nrise to the level of proximate causation. These relaxed rules are inconsistent with the\n\nposition that three of the justices of the new majority have taken previously on what\n\nevidence is required for a plaintiff to prove a traditional medical malpractice claim.34\n\nSuch claims have always required “but for” causation. After today’s shift, therefore, all\n\n\n         33\n         See Falcon v Mem Hosp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2212458\"><a href=\"/opinion/2212458/falcon-v-memorial-hosp/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 450; 462 NW2d 44 (1990) (opinion by\nLEVIN, J.) (characterizing the traditional approach to “but for” causation as “measured as\nmore than fifty percent” and concluding that a 37.5 percentage point reduction in the\nopportunity for surviving could not prove “but for” causation). Thus no one, not even\nthose in the Falcon decision who created an exception, has ever required less than a\n“more than 50 percentage point” change in order to establish a traditional medical\nmalpractice claim. Just two years ago, Justices CAVANAGH, WEAVER, and KELLY\nreaffirmed this position. See Stone, 482 Mich at 175-177 (opinion by CAVANAGH, J.).\n         34\n              See id.\n\n\n\n                                              19\n\fmalpractice claims will be established using principles that could only have applied to\n\nlost opportunity claims. Few can miss how significant a departure this is from all of this\n\nCourt’s medical malpractice jurisprudence that preceded this case.\n\n  1. THREE JUSTICES TODAY REPUDIATE THE TRADITIONAL CAUSATION\n       PRINCIPLES THAT THEY REAFFIRMED JUST TWO YEARS AGO.\n\n       The new majority appears to be of the view that the less said about its radical\n\nrewriting of this statute the better.    When a judge is “doing” policy rather than\n\ninterpreting the law, it is apparently not required to maintain a consistent position or\n\nexplain a fundamental change in position. Certainly, such disclosures are probably not\n\ndesired by jurists whose positions are undergoing radical “revision.” I commend the\n\nreader to compare the positions taken today by Chief Justice KELLY and Justices\n\nCAVANAGH and WEAVER with those taken just two years ago in Stone.35 These three\n\njustices now repudiate the traditional proximate cause requirements that they previously\n\nrecognized and applied at that time.\n\n       In Stone, Justice CAVANAGH, writing for himself and Justices KELLY and\n\nWEAVER, held that a traditional medical malpractice action required “but for” causation.\n\nHe specifically posed a hypothetical example in which a plaintiff’s opportunity to achieve\n\na better result was reduced by 40 percentage points, from 80 percent to 40 percent. Thus,\n\nthis hypothetical plaintiff’s risk of suffering a bad result increased from 20 percent to 60\n\npercent as a result of the alleged medical malpractice. According to Justice CAVANAGH\n\n       35\n         See id. Justice CAVANAGH at least has the forthrightness to indicate that he\ntoday repudiates this position. Ante at ___ (CAVANAGH, J., concurring).\n\n\n\n                                            20\n\fjust two years ago, this hypothetical plaintiff “could not meet the more-probably-than-not\n\nstandard of causation . . . .”36 Today these same three justices declare that a much\n\nsmaller reduction in the opportunity to achieve a better result—from 90 to 95 percent to\n\n80 to 90 percent—now satisfies the causation standard of a traditional malpractice case.\n\nThis is not a product of the rule of law. This is a naked display of judicial whimsy and\n\naggressive policy-making.\n\n   2. JUSTICE HATHAWAY’S OPINION MISREADS CASELAW TO REDEFINE\n       PROXIMATE CAUSE AND TO DO AWAY WITH THE TRADITIONAL\n   REQUIREMENT THAT A PLAINTIFF PROVE A “BUT FOR” CAUSE UNDER\n               THE MORE-PROBABLE-THAN-NOT STANDARD\n\n       Justice HATHAWAY’s opinion places much emphasis on the fact that our caselaw\n\nindicates that “a plaintiff need not prove that an act or omission was the sole catalyst for\n\nhis injuries,”37 in recognition that any given injury may have more than one proximate\n\ncause. It then uses this fact of logic and causation to create a false distinction that\n\nradically refashions proximate causation and negates the traditional requirement—as\n\npreviously articulated even by Justice CAVANAGH—that proof of “but for” causation\n\nmust “exclude other reasonable hypotheses with a fair amount of certainty.”38\n\n       The proposition that any injury may have more than one proximate cause is an\n\nunremarkable one for anyone who understands the principles of “but for” causation. An\n\n\n       36\n            Stone, 482 Mich at 177 (opinion by CAVANAGH, J.).\n       37\n            Craig, 471 Mich at 87.\n       38\n            Skinner, 445 Mich at 166 (emphasis added; quotation marks and citation\nomitted).\n\n\n\n                                            21\n\finjury that involves a series of individual occurrences before it is manifested will have\n\nmultiple “but for” causes. However, in such a case, each of these causes must be\n\nproved to have produced the injury under the more-probable-than-not standard, not\n\nmerely proved to have increased the risk of injury, as this case does.\n\n       One of this Court’s cases on traditional causation, Brackins v Olympia, Inc,\n\nillustrates this point.39 The plaintiff, a roller skating instructor, fell while roller skating at\n\nthe defendant’s rink. He alleged that another skater had clipped his right skate and that,\n\n“as a result his skates became locked with his right foot and skate behind his left skate.”40\n\nFurthermore, the plaintiff claimed that he could not have prevented the fall “because his\n\nleft skate struck a ridge or inequality in the floor of the rink . . . .”41 The defendant rink\n\nowner sought summary disposition because it claimed that the proximate cause of the\n\nplaintiff’s injury was the other skater clipping the plaintiff’s skate, not the flaw in the rink\n\nsurface. To be sure, the other skater’s action was a “but for” cause of the plaintiff’s\n\ninjury, as the injury would not have occurred without it. However, this Court concluded\n\nthat the skating rink surface was also a proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injury:\n\n               Defendant is not absolved from liability for its negligence because of\n       the act of the other skater . . . . The proofs support the conclusion . . . that\n       plaintiff fell because of the roughness of, or the inequality in, the floor of\n       the skating rink. Defendant’s negligence, if not the sole proximate cause of\n       the accident, was, in any event, a proximate cause.[42]\n       39\n            Brackins v Olympia, Inc, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3493195\"><a href=\"/opinion/3523819/brackins-v-olympia-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">316</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 25 NW2d 197 (1946).\n       40\n            Id. at 277.\n       41\n            Id.\n       42\n            Id. at 283 (emphasis added).\n\n\n                                               22\n\fEach of the “but for” causes in Brackins could be proved with near certainty.\n\nAccordingly, the Brackins Court concluded that both “but for” causes more probably than\n\nnot directly caused the plaintiff’s injury, and therefore it affirmed the jury’s award of\n\ndamages to the plaintiff against the defendant. Nevertheless, in recognizing that an\n\ninjury may have more than one “but for” cause, this Court has always, until now,\n\nrequired the traditional burden of proving that each particular “but for” cause more\n\nprobably than not produced the injury.43\n\n       The dual “but for” causes in Brackins are very different from the situation in the\n\ninstant case. Here, all that plaintiff can show is that defendants’ alleged malpractice\n\nexacerbated plaintiff’s preexisting sickle cell anemia to the extent of increasing his risk of\n\n\n       43\n           Justice HATHAWAY claims that this position “would allow recourse for the\nnegligent actions of medical providers only in those instances in which one provider’s\nconduct is at issue and only when no preexisting medical condition exists.” Ante at ___\n(opinion by HATHAWAY, J.). This is patently false. First, as stated, there can be multiple\n“but for” causes for a particular injury, including the negligent conduct of multiple\nmedical providers. Each of these hypothetical negligent acts, however, must themselves\nbe “but for” causes, like the chain reaction of events that caused the roller skating injury\nin Brackins. Second, a medical provider’s negligence may, more probably than not, be a\n“but for” cause of an injury even when the plaintiff has a preexisting condition. This was\nthe very situation that this Court encountered in Stone. The plaintiff in Stone alleged that\na timely diagnosis of an aortic aneurysm would have given him a 95 percent chance of\nattaining a good result. Instead, his aneurysm ruptured, requiring emergency surgery and\nultimately amputation of his legs. According to the plaintiff’s experts, “misdiagnosed\npatients whose aneurysms rupture have only a 10 percent chance to achieve a good\nresult.” Stone, 482 Mich at 148 (opinion by TAYLOR, C.J.). Thus, even though the\nplaintiff had a preexisting medical condition, the defendants’ misconduct increased the\nplaintiff’s probability of suffering a bad result from 5 percent to 90 percent. This\nincrease of 85 percentage points provided a sufficient factual basis to defeat the\ndefendant’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.\n\n\n\n                                             23\n\fsuffering a stroke by between 5 and 10 percentage points. Plaintiff has simply not proved\n\nthat the alleged malpractice caused his stroke, nor has he “exclude[d]” the “other\n\nreasonable hypothes[i]s”—his preexisting sickle cell anemia—“with a fair amount of\n\ncertainty.”44 Thus, plaintiff’s preexisting sickle cell anemia could well have operated to\n\ninjure him even in the absence of defendants’ alleged malpractice.\n\n   3. JUSTICE HATHAWAY’S AND JUSTICE CAVANAGH’S OPINIONS TAKE\n    INAPPROPRIATE LIBERTIES WITH PLAINTIFF’S EXPERT STATISTICAL\n           EVIDENCE BY FAILING TO COMPARE LIKE WITH LIKE\n\n       Even in applying their radical new approach to proximate causation, the justices in\n\nthe new majority only reach their desired result by manipulating the expert’s statistical\n\nevidence in ways inconsistent with the expert’s own use of the statistical evidence and,\n\nsimilarly, in ways inconsistent with the uncontroversial and essential principle of\n\nstatistical methodology of comparing “like with like.” The new majority’s inappropriate\n\nuse of the statistical evidence presented in this case provides further proof that it is\n\nengaging in result-driven jurisprudence. Only this motivation could support such a\n\nmathematically illiterate presentation.\n\n       Justice HATHAWAY’s opinion declares, under the guise of requiring “results [to] be\n\nviewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,”45 that any mishmash of\n\nfigures that yields a result of greater than 50 percent will establish proximate causation\n\nbetween the alleged malpractice and plaintiff’s injury sufficient to defeat summary\n\n       44\n            Skinner, 445 Mich at 166 (quotation marks and citation omitted).\n       45\n            Ante at ___ (opinion by HATHAWAY, J.).\n\n\n\n                                             24\n\fdisposition. Thus, while Justice HATHAWAY’s opinion expressly declines to adopt any\n\nparticular mathematical formula for determining whether proximate cause exists in a\n\ngiven case, it essentially adopts every formula that an attorney or judge can manufacture.\n\nThis is not a serious analysis—“statistical” or otherwise. Justice HATHAWAY’s opinion is\n\nsimply an invitation for the artful manipulation of probability figures and calls to mind\n\nthe adage Mark Twain once attributed to Benjamin Disraeli, that there are “three kinds of\n\nlies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.”46\n\n       Two of the formulas that Justice HATHAWAY’s opinion identifies by name bear\n\ncloser analysis. Her opinion indicates that the evidence in this case can be “viewed as a\n\nstandard percentage increase calculation. . . .”47       The flaw in using this “standard\n\npercentage increase calculation” in a traditional medical malpractice case is obvious.\n\nSuch a calculation would turn the facts of Falcon—a case in which no justice\n\nbelieved that the plaintiff could prove “but for” causation using a more-probable-\n\nthan-not standard48—into a traditional medical malpractice case.\n\n\n\n       46\n         Twain, My Autobiography: “Chapters” from the North American Review\n(Mineola, NY: Dover Publications, Inc, 1999), p 208.\n       47\n            Ante at ___ (opinion by HATHAWAY, J.).\n       48\n           Falcon, 436 Mich at 460 (opinion by LEVIN, J.) (“[I]t cannot be said, more\nprobably than not, that [defendant] caused [plaintiff’s] death.”); id. at 472-473 (BOYLE,\nJ., concurring) (“I concur in the recognition of ‘lost opportunity to survive’ as injury for\nwhich tort law should allow recovery in proportion to the extent of the lost chance of\nsurvival . . . provided that the negligence of the defendant more probably than not caused\nthe loss of opportunity.”); id. at 473 (RILEY, C.J., dissenting) (“[I]t is uncontested that the\nplaintiff cannot show that defendant’s negligence caused the decedent’s death . . . .”).\n\n\n\n                                              25\n\f       In Falcon, the plaintiff’s decedent, Nena Falcon, suffered an amniotic fluid\n\nembolism, “an unpreventable complication” of childbirth.49 A woman who suffers this\n\ncomplication has a 62.5 percent probability of dying, even if it is treated immediately.\n\nBecause of alleged malpractice, however, Nena Falcon’s amniotic fluid embolism was\n\nnot treated immediately. This alleged malpractice increased her chance of death to 100\n\npercent.50     Under the “standard percentage increase calculation” used by Justice\n\nHATHAWAY to support her radical departure from requiring traditional proximate\n\ncausation in this case, the defendant’s alleged malpractice in Falcon was responsible for\n\nincreasing Nena Falcon’s chance of dying by 37.5 percentage points over the preexisting\n\n62.5 percentage point chance of dying. This represents a 60 percent increase in her\n\nchance of dying (37.5/62.5), and satisfies Justice HATHAWAY’s conclusion that any\n\nformula that reaches the magic number of more than 50 percent is satisfactory. Justice\n\nHATHAWAY’s opinion has, therefore, taken a judicially created aberration of proximate\n\ncausation, Falcon, and applied it so that she can satisfy the proximate cause component\n\nof a traditional medical malpractice claim. Fortunately, Justice HATHAWAY’s opinion is\n\nthe only opinion that adopts this approach, so this “standard percentage increase\n\ncalculation” does not, therefore, have support from a majority of this Court.\n\n       However, a second approach used by Justice HATHAWAY that I wish to discuss\n\ndoes appear to have the support from a majority of this Court—what Justice HATHAWAY\n\n       49\n            Falcon, 436 Mich at 454 (opinion by LEVIN, J.).\n       50\n            Id. at 454 n 16.\n\n\n\n                                             26\n\fcalls the “standard percentage decrease calculation.”51 This approach takes the pre- and\n\npostmalpractice probabilities of suffering the injury and calculates what proportion of the\n\npostmalpractice probability of injury is attributable to the malpractice. The percentage\n\napproach is found nowhere in this Court’s proximate cause jurisprudence, yet both\n\nJustice HATHAWAY’s opinion and Justice CAVANAGH’s concurring opinion apply it to\n\nconclude that plaintiff has made the requisite showing of probable cause to defeat\n\ndefendant’s motion for summary disposition.\n\n      As stated, three of the justices who support this approach do so in opposition to\n\ntheir previously stated positions.52 Moreover, Justice HATHAWAY’s opinion and Justice\n\n\n\n      51\n           Ante at ___ (opinion by HATHAWAY, J.).\n      52\n          Under the hypothetical example Justice CAVANAGH posed in Stone, a plaintiff\nwhose risk of suffering a bad result increases from 20 percent to 60 percent is unable to\nprove causation under the more-probable-than-not standard. This is because the\nplaintiff’s risk has not increased by the more than 50 percentage points traditionally\nrequired to prove “but for” causation. Justice CAVANAGH applies a very different\napproach today, and, under that approach, his hypothetical Stone plaintiff would be able\nto prove causation. Whatever innocence Justice CAVANAGH now feigns in treating both\nthat hypothetical case and the instant case as traditional medical malpractice cases, he is\nunequivocally converting what used to be a lost opportunity case into a traditional\nmedical malpractice case.\n\n        A plaintiff who has a preexisting medical condition is only able to prove “but for”\ncausation when the alleged malpractice increases the plaintiff’s risk of suffering a “bad\nresult” by more than 50 percentage points. Otherwise, there is no way to exclude, as\nJustice CAVANAGH (and this Court) has previously required, all “other reasonable\nhypotheses with a fair amount of certainty.” Skinner, 445 Mich at 166 (quotation marks\nand citation omitted). The approach adopted by the opinions of Justices HATHAWAY and\nCAVANAGH negates this basic requirement of proximate cause and would allow a\nplaintiff to recover for a bad result even in situations in which other, nonmalpractice\n“causes” for the result predominated in creating it.\n\n\n\n                                            27\n\fCAVANAGH’s concurring opinion apply the new standard in an especially troubling\n\nfashion. It is a truism in statistical methodology that one marshaling statistical evidence\n\nto support causation must apply the principle of ceteris paribus by “comparing like with\n\nlike.”53 The new majority violates this basic principle of statistical analysis to reach its\n\ndesired result. The expert testimony indicated that plaintiff’s chance of suffering a stroke\n\nwould have been reduced from the range of 10 to 20 percent to the range of 5 to 10\n\npercent if plaintiff had been treated according to the asserted standard of care.            In\n\n\n       The new majority’s approach would allow a plaintiff to recover in full from a\ndoctor who, for example, failed to diagnose cancer at its earliest stages, but still\ndiagnosed it at a stage where it was much more probable than not that a patient would\nsurvive. To put figures on this situation, suppose a plaintiff's risk of dying from cancer is\n1 percent if it is caught at its earliest stages. A doctor who fails to catch the cancer at that\nstage, but who catches it and treats it at a stage where the risk of dying from cancer is 3\npercent, then, is liable, under the new majority’s new approach, for the entire injury,\nshould one occur, because the failure to diagnose contributed to 2/3 of the risk of injury.\nThis is true, according to the new majority, even though the doctor only decreased the\npatient's chance of surviving by 2 percentage points, from 99 percent to 97 percent.\n\n        By shifting many lost opportunity claims into traditional medical malpractice\nclaims, the new majority creates additional liability of a defendant for the entire injury,\nnot just for the increased risk of injury, as lost opportunity claims provide. See Falcon,\n436 Mich at 471 (opinion by LEVIN, J.) (“In this case, 37.5 percent times the damages\nrecoverable for wrongful death would be an appropriate measure of damages.”). This\nshift in determining a defendant’s liability is essential to understanding what the new\nmajority is trying to accomplish in this case. Now plaintiffs need only prove that a\ndoctor’s negligence contributed to the risk of injury, not that his negligence actually\ncaused the injury. And no amount of pretended ignorance about the significance of these\nchanges by members of the new majority alters their fundamental and radical impact on\nthis area of the law.\n       53\n          See Lewis-Beck, Bryman, & Liao, eds, 1 The SAGE Encyclopedia of Social\nScience Research Methods (Thousand Oaks, Cal: SAGE Publications, Inc, 2004), p 117\n(“Ceteris paribus . . . refers to the process of comparing like with like when asserting a\ncausal relationship or the effect of one variable on another.”).\n\n\n\n                                              28\n\fclarifying these statistical ranges, the expert concluded that plaintiff’s likelihood of\n\nsuffering a stroke would have been “cut in half” under the standard of care urged by\n\nplaintiff. In other words, the upper end of the range of plaintiff’s likelihood of suffering a\n\nstroke was “cut in half,” from 20 percent to 10 percent, and the lower end of that range\n\nwas also “cut in half,” from 10 percent to 5 percent. Rather than comparing like with\n\nlike—the lower end of each range or the upper end of each range—a majority of this\n\nCourt fallaciously compares the lower end of one range (5 percent) with the upper end of\n\nthe other (20 percent). They do so in order to conclude that the alleged malpractice\n\ncaused 75 percent of plaintiff’s chance of suffering a stroke (15/20).54 This failure to\n\n“compare like with like” is a patent error of statistical analysis, but it gets the majority\n\nwhere it needs to go to support its conclusion that plaintiff has established “but for”\n\ncause.\n\n         Finally, Justice HATHAWAY’s opinion concludes that “plaintiff established a\n\nquestion of fact on the issue of proximate causation because plaintiff’s experts opined\n\nthat defendants’ negligence more probably than not was the proximate cause of the\n\nplaintiff’s injuries.”55 This statement might have had more relevance if it had been\n\n\n         54\n          The new majority calculates that defendants’ alleged malpractice caused an\nincrease in plaintiff’s risk of suffering a stroke by 15 percentage points (5 percent risk\nwithout malpractice subtracted from 20 percent risk with malpractice). They then divide\nthat figure by plaintiff’s 20 percent risk of a stroke with malpractice to conclude that the\nalleged malpractice caused 75 percent of plaintiff’s chance of suffering a stroke. See\nante at ___ (opinion by HATHAWAY, J.); ante at ___ (CAVANAGH, J., concurring).\n         55\n              Ante at ___ (opinion by HATHAWAY, J.).\n\n\n\n                                              29\n\fsupported by the experts’ actual statistical evidence of plaintiff’s chances of suffering the\n\nstroke. However, as discussed above, plaintiff’s experts were unable to show proximate\n\ncausation between the alleged malpractice and plaintiff’s stroke. All they were able to\n\nshow was a connection between the alleged malpractice and plaintiff’s increased\n\nlikelihood of suffering a stroke, from between 5 to 10 percent to between 10 to 20\n\npercent. Justice HATHAWAY’s analysis, such as it is, allows an expert to say certain\n\n“magic words” about proximate causation, while presenting statistical evidence to the\n\ncontrary.\n\n       As stated, this case is a prototypical lost opportunity case because plaintiff cannot\n\nestablish that, more probably than not, defendants proximately caused his stroke because\n\nhe was predisposed to suffer one, his risk being in the range of 5 to 10 percent, even with\n\nmedical care that satisfied plaintiff’s proposed standard of care.          Accordingly, I\n\nvigorously dissent from the conclusion of a majority of this Court that plaintiff asserted a\n\ntraditional medical malpractice claim and would instead conclude that plaintiff asserted a\n\nlost opportunity claim.\n\n         C. MCL 600.2912a(2) IS (STILL) UNENFORCEABLE AS ENACTED\n\n       Because the new majority concludes that plaintiff’s claim is a traditional medical\n\nmalpractice claim, it does not need to reach the question whether plaintiff’s claim meets\n\nthe requirements of the second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2), which applies only to lost\n\nopportunity claims. The decision of the new majority to treat this case as a traditional\n\nmedical malpractice claim, of course, obviates the need for interpreting the second\n\nsentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) because the new majority essentially treats all medical\n\n\n                                             30\n\fmalpractice claims under the weakened Falcon causation standard heretofore applicable\n\nonly to lost opportunity claims. Therefore, the decision of the new majority to overrule\n\nthe Court of Appeals decision in Fulton, to the extent Fulton drew a line between lost\n\nopportunity cases and traditional medical malpractice cases, also does away with Fulton’s\n\napplication of the sentence in § 2912a(2) that applies to lost opportunity cases. Fulton\n\nonly applies to lost opportunity cases. By concluding that the instant case sounds in\n\ntraditional medical malpractice, the new majority essentially writes the decision in Fulton\n\nout of existence. Thus, its expansive decision in this case is characteristic of the new\n\nmajority that overreaches in its decisions in order to achieve its own preferred policy\n\noutcomes.56\n\n\n      56\n          Although the “new majority” has only been in existence 18 months, it has an\nimpressive record of overturning cases consistent with the Chief Justice’s promise to\n“undo . . . the damage that the Republican-dominated court has done.” She Said, Detroit\nFree Press, December 10, 2008, p 2A.\n\n        By my count, the new majority has now overturned this term 12 cases in addition\nto the one that it overturns today:\n\n       1.

See also Univ of Mich Regents, ___ Mich at ___\n(WEAVER, J., concurring); Lansing Sch Ed Ass’n, ___ Mich at ___ (WEAVER, J.,\nconcurring); McCormick, ___ Mich at ___ (WEAVER, J., concurring). Her position does\nnot become any more convincing with repetition. My dissenting opinion in Univ of Mich\nRegents, ___ Mich at ___ (YOUNG, J., dissenting), explains in full why Justice WEAVER’s\nposition is merely an attempt to justify stark judicial policy-making.\n\n\n\n                                           32\n\f      The Legislature added subsection (2) to MCL 600.2912a shortly after the Falcon\n\nCourt created the new claim for loss of an opportunity to survive. The new subsection\n\nprovides:\n\n              In an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff has the\n      burden of proving that he or she suffered an injury that more probably than\n      not was proximately caused by the negligence of the defendant or\n      defendants. In an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff cannot\n      recover for loss of an opportunity to survive or an opportunity to achieve a\n      better result unless the opportunity was greater than 50%.[57]\n\n      As the lead opinion in Stone aptly observed, there are multiple problems in\n\ndetermining whether the requirements of MCL 600.2912a(2) apply in any particular case.\n\nAs stated above, the two sentences are internally inconsistent and, therefore, create a\n\nparadox:\n\n              [T]he first sentence of this new subsection codifies and reiterates the\n      common-law requirement that a plaintiff show that the defendant’s\n      malpractice more probably than not caused the plaintiff’s injury. The\n      second sentence of subsection 2 adds that, in medical-malpractice cases, a\n      “plaintiff cannot recover for loss of an opportunity to survive or an\n      opportunity to achieve a better result unless the opportunity was greater\n      than 50%.” However, one must keep in mind that the relevant caselaw\n      when subsection 2 was enacted held that the lost-opportunity doctrine\n      applies “in situations where a plaintiff cannot prove that a defendant’s\n      actions were the cause of his injuries . . . .” Vitale, [150 Mich App] at 502\n      (emphasis added). That is, the first sentence of subsection 2 requires\n      plaintiffs in every medical-malpractice case to show the defendant’s\n      malpractice proximately caused the injury while, at the same time, the\n      second sentence refers to cases in which such proof not only is\n      unnecessary, but is impossible.[58]\n\n\n      57\n           MCL 600.2912a(2).\n      58\n           Stone, 482 Mich at 156-157 (opinion by TAYLOR, C.J.).\n\n\n\n                                            33\n\f      Even ignoring the internal inconsistency, the second sentence of subsection (2) is\n\nincomprehensible as written. Subsequent to the amendment, the split Court of Appeals\n\npanel in Fulton offered two contradictory interpretations of the second sentence, neither\n\nof which was consistent with the text of that sentence as enacted. The Fulton majority\n\ndetermined that “MCL 600.2912a(2) requires a plaintiff to show that the loss of the\n\nopportunity to survive or achieve a better result exceeds fifty percent.”59 As the lead\n\nopinion in Stone indicated, this interpretation “improperly adds to the statute the words\n\n‘loss of,’ effectively replacing the word ‘opportunity’ where it is used the second time\n\nwith the phrase ‘loss of opportunity.’”60 Thus, the Fulton majority essentially rewrote the\n\nsecond sentence of § 2912a(2) to include the following bracketed words: “In an action\n\nalleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff cannot recover for loss of an opportunity to\n\nsurvive or an opportunity to achieve a better result unless the [loss of] opportunity was\n\ngreater than 50%.”\n\n      The dissenting judge in Fulton did not fare any better. His interpretation of MCL\n\n600.2912a(2) required a plaintiff “‘to show that, had the defendant not been negligent,\n\nthere was a greater than fifty percent chance of survival or a better result.’”61 This\n\n\n      59\n           Fulton, 253 Mich App at 83.\n      60\n           Stone, 482 Mich at 159 n 9 (opinion by TAYLOR, C.J.).\n      61\n         Fulton, 253 Mich App at 91 (SMOLENSKI, J., dissenting), quoting Wickens v\nOakwood Healthcare System, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2036566\"><a href=\"/opinion/2036566/wickens-v-oakwood-healthcare-system/\"><span class=\"volume\">242</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.

Their reasons for doing so were identical: each believed the additional language\n\nwas necessary to enforce the perceived legislative intent to respond to the Falcon Court’s\n\ncreation of the lost opportunity claim. However, these multiple interpretations show that,\n\neven if they were correct that the amendment was a legislative response to Falcon, the\n\nscope of such response was far from clear.\n\n       In the end, the lead opinion in Stone concluded:\n\n              It is confounding to attempt to ascertain just what the Legislature\n       was trying to do with this amendment. . . .\n\n              As written, the second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) can be made\n       understandable only by adding words or by redefining “injury” in a way\n       significantly contrary to the mass of caselaw at the time the sentence was\n       added. . . . None of these multiple, contradictory interpretations can be\n       shown to be the “correct” construction of legislative intent. Choosing\n       between them can only be a guess. . . . Accordingly, I conclude that the\n       second sentence of subsection 2 cannot be judicially enforced because\n       doing so requires the Court to impose its own prerogative on an act of the\n       Legislature.[62]\n\n\n\n\n       62\n            Stone, 482 Mich at 160-161 (opinion by TAYLOR, C.J.).\n\n\n\n                                             35\n\fSince this Court’s split opinions in Stone, the Legislature has not clarified the confusion\n\nsurrounding the appropriate interpretation of MCL 600.2912a(2). Therefore, my position\n\nremains that the provision is unenforceable as enacted.\n\n       The decision by the new majority that this case represents a traditional medical\n\nmalpractice case further muddles this important area of the law. Moreover, three justices\n\nof the new majority have changed their published positions over the past several years on\n\nthe nature of the evidence required to prove proximate cause.\n\n       If the numerous fractured decisions and inconsistent opinions of the members\n\nof this Court fail to demonstrate that this statute is impossible to interpret\n\nreasonably, then it is hard to envision a better illustration that MCL 600.2912a(2) is\n\ninherently internally inconsistent and cannot be parsed.\n\n                                    IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       Confusion and uncertainty in the law prevent citizens from arranging their affairs\n\nin a predictable fashion. This Court initially created uncertainty in adopting the lost\n\nopportunity claim in Falcon because it was so profoundly at odds with traditional\n\nprinciples of causation. It is no wonder that the Legislature had difficulty reconciling\n\n“Falcon causation” with the traditional causation that the Legislature clearly desired to\n\nmaintain in medical malpractice claims. Today, the new majority has created even more\n\nuncertainty in interpreting the legislative response to Falcon. While the result in this case\n\nundoubtedly serves the interests of lawyers who litigate medical malpractice cases, it\n\npoorly serves the people of this state to have the law become even more\n\nincomprehensibly muddled. This is not an accidental act, but one intentionally designed\n\n\n                                             36\n\fto thwart the legislative directive that the plaintiff prove the traditional requirement of\n\nproximate cause in every “action alleging medical malpractice . . . .”63 Judges, as neutral\n\narbiters whose function is merely to interpret the laws enacted through the democratic\n\nprocess, should not be agents of “societal change” they desire, and they certainly should\n\nnot contribute to confusion and chaos in the law. The new majority’s resolution of this\n\ncase fails on both counts.\n\n       Plaintiff’s claim is a prototypical lost opportunity claim. As such, the second\n\nsentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) expressly controls plaintiff’s claim. However, I continue\n\nto maintain that § 2912a(2) is unenforceable as enacted, and I reiterate former Chief\n\nJustice TAYLOR’s call for the Legislature “to reexamine its goal and the policies it wishes\n\nto promote and strive to better articulate its intent in that regard.”64 Today, that call is\n\nmore urgent than it was just two years ago.\n\n       Today is a sad day for predictability in Michigan law. The disorder sown by the\n\nnew majority in their several opinions speaks poorly of the quality of decision-making in\n\nthis Court.     Doctrinal destruction aside, the obvious manipulation of the statistical\n\nevidence by the justices of the new majority to achieve their goal of creating a cause of\n\naction when the proofs have failed is itself worthy of condemnation.\n\n\n\n\n       63\n            MCL 600.2912a(2).\n       64\n            Stone, 482 Mich at 165 (opinion by TAYLOR, C.J.).\n\n\n\n                                              37\n\f      For all of the reasons stated, I vigorously dissent from overreaching by the new\n\nmajority and, instead, would vacate as improvidently entered this Court’s September 30,\n\n2009, order granting leave to appeal.\n\n\n      CORRIGAN, J., concurred with YOUNG, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                          38\n\f</pre>",
