The district court rendered summary judgment for the\n\nschool superintendent, Dr. Herman Smith, on the ground of qualified immunity, and\n\ncertified it as final.1 We reverse.\n\n                                      BACKGROUND\n\n       Barrow was a classroom teacher within the Greenville Independent School District\n\nin July 1998 when she learned of an opening at the district’s middle school for the\n\nposition of assistant principal. Barrow expressed her interest in the position, but was\n\nadvised that to be considered for it she had to re-enroll her children in a public school.\n\nBarrow and her husband met with Smith, then district superintendent, who told them that\n\nthe district required that the children of all principals and administrators attend public\n\nschool. Barrow refused to comply with the district’s policy, and as a result, the district\n\ndid not consider her for the position of assistant principal.\n\n       Barrow initiated the instant action against the district and Smith under 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1983. Smith moved for summary judgment asserting qualified immunity, allowing the\n\ncourt to assume for that limited purpose that he decided not to promote Barrow in part\n\nbecause she chose to educate her children in a private school. The district court\n\ndetermined that Barrow had failed to allege the violation of a clearly established\n\nconstitutional right in 1998 and that Smith was therefore entitled to qualified immunity.\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n\n\n\n       1\n              See FED. R. CIV. P. 54(b).\n\n                                              2\n\f       Whether a public official is entitled to qualified immunity requires that the court\n\npass on two questions.2 First, viewing the facts in a light most favorable to the plaintiff,\n\nthe court must determine if the plaintiff has alleged the violation of a constitutional right.3\n\nThe second question (which we need address only if we answer the first question in the\n\naffirmative) requires the court to determine if the constitutional right was clearly\n\nestablished when the violation supposedly occurred.4 The right can be said to have been\n\nclearly established only if all reasonable officials in the defendant’s position would have\n\nconcluded that the challenged state action was unconstitutional.5\n\n       In her amended complaint, Barrow argued that Smith violated her right to select a\n\nprivate-school education for her children as guaranteed by the First Amendment and “the\n\npenumbra of familial privacy rights” (count I); her right under the Due Process Clause of\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment to direct the upbringing of her children (count II); and her\n\nright under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to provide a religious\n\neducation for her children (count III). We will consider these three claims together: at\n\n\n       2\n                 Smith argues that even if we reverse the district court’s determination that he is\nentitled to qualified immunity this court can affirm the judgment below by finding that Barrow\nwould not have received the assistant principal position anyway. He argues (1) that Barrow failed\nto complete a required written application for the position and (2) that the qualifications of other\ncandidates were superior to Barrow’s. Never having reached the merits of Barrow’s claims, the\ndistrict court of course did not address these arguments. On this record we cannot rule on these\nissues as a matter of law.\n       3\n               See Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001).\n       4\n               See id.\n       5\n               See Cozzo v. Tangipahoa Parish Council, 279 F.3d 273, 284 (5th Cir. 2002).\n\n                                                 3\n\fbottom all aver that Barrow, a public-school employee, has a constitutionally-protected\n\nright to select a private-school education for her children. Our inquiry at this stage is\n\nlimited to the question whether there is a recognized constitutional right and not whether\n\nthat right is grounded in the First Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, or both.\n\n       Twenty years ago, in Brantley v. Surles,6 we said that “[t]he parental interest in the\n\ndirection and control of a child’s education is central to the family’s constitutionally\n\nprotected privacy rights.”7 We also recognized that constitutional rights take on a\n\ndifferent hue in the context of public-school employment in light of the state’s interest “in\n\npromoting efficiency in the educational services which it provides through its school\n\nemployees.”8 Thus, the state may restrict its employee’s constitutionally-protected\n\nconduct “whenever that conduct materially and substantially impedes the operation or\n\neffectiveness of the [state’s] educational program.”9 The question presented in Brantley\n\nwas whether a Mississippi school district superintendent could lawfully terminate\n\nBrantley, an elementary-school cafeteria manager, who decided to transfer her son to a\n\n\n\n       6\n               718 F.2d 1354 (5th Cir. 1983).\n       7\n                 Id. at 1358 (citing Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923), and Pierce v. Soc. of\nSisters, 268 U.S. 510 (1925)). In Meyer, the Court recognized that parents have a protected\nliberty interest in the upbringing of their children under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. 262 U.S. at 399-400. In Pierce, the Court held that the liberty interest described in\nMeyer protected the choice of parents to enroll their children in private school. 268 U.S. at 534-\n35.\n       8\n               Id. at 1359.\n       9\n               Id.\n\n                                                 4\n\fsegregated private school. Brantley was white and worked in a predominately black\n\npublic school. The superintendent testified that interracial dissension “might” occur if\n\nBrantley’s son continued to attend the segregated private school.10 We rejected this\n\njustification for terminating Brantley, concluding that it “was unsupported by any\n\nobjective evidence.”11\n\n       Several years later we decided Fyfe v. Curlee.12 The plaintiff in that case, a\n\nsecretary to a school principal, also decided to enroll her daughter in a segregated private\n\nschool. As a result, the school superintendent transferred her to a menial position with no\n\nresponsibility. Relying on Brantley, we affirmed that the Fyfe plaintiff had a protected\n\nright to select a private-school education for her child “under the First Amendment and\n\nthe penumbra of familial privacy rights recognized by the Supreme Court.”13 In Fyfe,\n\nblack families threatened to boycott businesses in the town in which the school district\n\nwas located unless the district promised to not hire anyone whose children attended a\n\nsegregated private school. However, the school district offered no evidence of a causal\n\nlink between the threatened boycott and Fyfe’s daughter’s attendance of the private\n\nschool. In the absence of evidence that Fyfe’s choice of a private-school education for\n\nher daughter would substantially and materially interfere with the school district’s\n\n\n       10\n              765 F.2d 478, 480 (5th Cir. 1985) (appeal following remand).\n       11\n              Id.; cf. Stough v. Crenshaw County Bd. of Educ., 744 F.2d 1479 (11th Cir. 1984).\n       12\n              902 F.2d 401 (5th Cir. 1990).\n       13\n              Id. at 403.\n\n                                              5\n\foperations and effectiveness we held that Fyfe must prevail as a matter of law.14\n\n       Our decisions in Brantley and Fyfe leave no doubt that public-school employees\n\nlike Barrow have a protected right to educate their children in private school. The state\n\ncannot take an adverse employment action against a public-school employee for\n\nexercising this right unless it can prove that the employee’s selection of private school\n\nmaterially and substantially affects the state’s educational mission. In this case, for\n\npurposes of this decision, Smith refused to consider Barrow for the position of assistant\n\nprincipal because her children attended private school. Refusal to promote is an adverse\n\nemployment action.15 Because Smith failed to present a fact issue that Barrow’s\n\nchildren’s attendance of a private school would negatively impair district operations were\n\nBarrow selected for assistant principal, the violation of a constitutional right is shown.\n\n       Brantley and Fyfe also confirm that the constitutional right of public-school\n\nemployees to select a private-school education for their children was clearly established\n\nwhen Smith refused to consider Barrow for the position of assistant principal. Smith\n\nargues that Brantley and Fyfe do not give fair warning to all reasonable officials in his\n\nplace that refusing to consider Barrow for the assistant principal position would be\n\nunconstitutional. Initially, we note that the question whether there was a clearly-\n\nestablished right does not turn on the existence of a court decision determining that\n\n\n\n       14\n              Id. at 405-06.\n       15\n              See Harrington v. Harris, 118 F.3d 359, 365 (5th Cir. 1997).\n\n                                              6\n\fconduct identical to that which is at issue here is unlawful.16 Rather, the pertinent inquiry\n\nasks “whether the state of the law [in 1998] gave [Smith] fair warning that [his] alleged\n\ntreatment of [Barrow] was unconstitutional.”17 Smith points out that the plaintiff-school\n\nemployees in Brantley and Fyfe were in non-administrative positions, whereas Barrow\n\nsought the position of assistant principal. He suggests that requiring administrative\n\nemployees to enroll their children in public schools better serves the district’s interest in\n\npublic confidence in the public school system than imposing a similar requirement on\n\nnon-administrative employees does. Smith may be correct that the public tends to be\n\nmore attuned to the personal educational decisions of the school district’s administrative\n\nemployees than of its other employees. We may also assume that the district’s interest in\n\npublic confidence in its schools is both legitimate and important.18 However, our\n\ndecisions in Brantley and Fyfe did not rest on a too-attenuated nexus between the public\n\nconfidence in public schools and the personal educational choices of cafeteria managers\n\n\n\n       16\n               See Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987).\n       17\n               See Hope v. Pelzer, 122 S. Ct. 2508, 2516 (2002).\n       18\n                 Indeed, in some instances, the success of a public education program may depend\non the perception that it is superior to that of both other public schools and private schools. See\nZelman v. Simmons-Harris, 122 S. Ct. 2460 (2002) (upholding a state law authorizing parents to\nassign tax dollars to another public school or to a private school upon their decision not to enroll\ntheir children in the schools of the public-school district in which they reside). Further, it is\nconceivable, as Smith suggests, that the public might interpret the decision of one or more senior\npublic-school employees to enroll their children in a private school as a vote of no-confidence in\nschool district in which they work. The burden of the school district would then be to prove that\nthe private school placement materially and substantially impeded the operation and the\neffectiveness of the state’s educational program.\n\n                                                  7\n\fand secretaries. Instead, those decisions rely on our recognition that (1) public-school\n\nemployees enjoy a protected right to enroll their children in private school, and (2) a state\n\naction that interferes with this protected right is unsustainable unless proved to further a\n\nstate interest. Brantley and Fyfe require the state to prove that a state action that\n\ninterferes with protected educational choices of its public-school employees furthers the\n\nstate’s interest in the efficient operation of its schools. Nothing about those two decisions\n\nsuggests that the state can forgo this burden with respect to its more senior employees.19\n\nWe therefore hold that no reasonable official could conclude that the application of the\n\nschool district’s public-school patronage policy to Barrow was constitutional.20\n\n       REVERSED and REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n       19\n                In support of his claim that the right of public-school employees to enroll their\nchildren in private school is not clearly established, Smith offered the testimony of several\nprofessional educators, all of whom opined that patronage policies like the one in this case are\nlawful or are of uncertain legality. The question whether an asserted constitutional right is clearly\nestablished is one of law. Smith’s subjective reasonableness has no place in our inquiry.\n       20\n                In so holding, we express no opinion on the particular degree of scrutiny a state\naction must undergo to withstand a challenge to its constitutionality in a case like this one.\nInstead, we simply recognize that the state cannot strip its school employees of the right to\nchoose a private-school education for their children without proving that the unfettered exercise\nof this right will undermine a state interest. Barrow and amici curiae argue that any state action\nthat interferes with this right is subject to strict scrutiny. We need not take up this question today.\nIn the absence of objective proof that Barrow’s choice of a private-school education for her\nchildren will undermine a state interest the district’s patronage policy fails irrespective of the\ndegree of scrutiny applied.\n\n                                                  8\n\f",

We will consider these three claims together: at\n\n\n       2\n                 Smith argues that even if we reverse the district court’s determination that he is\nentitled to qualified immunity this court can affirm the judgment below by finding that Barrow\nwould not have received the assistant principal position anyway. He argues (1) that Barrow failed\nto complete a required written application for the position and (2) that the qualifications of other\ncandidates were superior to Barrow’s. Never having reached the merits of Barrow’s claims, the\ndistrict court of course did not address these arguments. On this record we cannot rule on these\nissues as a matter of law.\n       3\n               See Saucier v.

Our inquiry at this stage is\n\nlimited to the question whether there is a recognized constitutional right and not whether\n\nthat right is grounded in the First Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, or both.\n\n       Twenty years ago, in Brantley v. Surles,6 we said that “[t]he parental interest in the\n\ndirection and control of a child’s education is central to the family’s constitutionally\n\nprotected privacy rights.”7 We also recognized that constitutional rights take on a\n\ndifferent hue in the context of public-school employment in light of the state’s interest “in\n\npromoting efficiency in the educational services which it provides through its school\n\nemployees.”8 Thus, the state may restrict its employee’s constitutionally-protected\n\nconduct “whenever that conduct materially and substantially impedes the operation or\n\neffectiveness of the [state’s] educational program.”9 The question presented in Brantley\n\nwas whether a Mississippi school district superintendent could lawfully terminate\n\nBrantley, an elementary-school cafeteria manager, who decided to transfer her son to a\n\n\n\n       6\n               </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"425951\"><a href=\"/opinion/425951/mrs-tobie-brantley-v-mf-surles-superintendent-of-education-montgomery/\"><span class=\"volume\">718</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1354</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1983).\n       7\n                 Id. at 1358 (citing Meyer v.

In Meyer, the Court recognized that parents have a protected\nliberty interest in the upbringing of their children under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. 262 U.S. at 399-400.

Brantley was white and worked in a predominately black\n\npublic school. The superintendent testified that interracial dissension “might” occur if\n\nBrantley’s son continued to attend the segregated private school.10 We rejected this\n\njustification for terminating Brantley, concluding that it “was unsupported by any\n\nobjective evidence.”11\n\n       Several years later we decided Fyfe v. Curlee.12 The plaintiff in that case, a\n\nsecretary to a school principal, also decided to enroll her daughter in a segregated private\n\nschool. As a result, the school superintendent transferred her to a menial position with no\n\nresponsibility. Relying on Brantley, we affirmed that the Fyfe plaintiff had a protected\n\nright to select a private-school education for her child “under the First Amendment and\n\nthe penumbra of familial privacy rights recognized by the Supreme Court.”13 In Fyfe,\n\nblack families threatened to boycott businesses in the town in which the school district\n\nwas located unless the district promised to not hire anyone whose children attended a\n\nsegregated private school. However, the school district offered no evidence of a causal\n\nlink between the threatened boycott and Fyfe’s daughter’s attendance of the private\n\nschool.

The state\n\ncannot take an adverse employment action against a public-school employee for\n\nexercising this right unless it can prove that the employee’s selection of private school\n\nmaterially and substantially affects the state’s educational mission. In this case, for\n\npurposes of this decision, Smith refused to consider Barrow for the position of assistant\n\nprincipal because her children attended private school. Refusal to promote is an adverse\n\nemployment action.15 Because Smith failed to present a fact issue that Barrow’s\n\nchildren’s attendance of a private school would negatively impair district operations were\n\nBarrow selected for assistant principal, the violation of a constitutional right is shown.\n\n       Brantley and Fyfe also confirm that the constitutional right of public-school\n\nemployees to select a private-school education for their children was clearly established\n\nwhen Smith refused to consider Barrow for the position of assistant principal. Smith\n\nargues that Brantley and Fyfe do not give fair warning to all reasonable officials in his\n\nplace that refusing to consider Barrow for the assistant principal position would be\n\nunconstitutional.

He suggests that requiring administrative\n\nemployees to enroll their children in public schools better serves the district’s interest in\n\npublic confidence in the public school system than imposing a similar requirement on\n\nnon-administrative employees does. Smith may be correct that the public tends to be\n\nmore attuned to the personal educational decisions of the school district’s administrative\n\nemployees than of its other employees. We may also assume that the district’s interest in\n\npublic confidence in its schools is both legitimate and important.18 However, our\n\ndecisions in Brantley and Fyfe did not rest on a too-attenuated nexus between the public\n\nconfidence in public schools and the personal educational choices of cafeteria managers\n\n\n\n       16\n               See Anderson v.

Further, it is\nconceivable, as Smith suggests, that the public might interpret the decision of one or more senior\npublic-school employees to enroll their children in a private school as a vote of no-confidence in\nschool district in which they work. The burden of the school district would then be to prove that\nthe private school placement materially and substantially impeded the operation and the\neffectiveness of the state’s educational program.\n\n                                                  7\n\fand secretaries. Instead, those decisions rely on our recognition that (1) public-school\n\nemployees enjoy a protected right to enroll their children in private school, and (2) a state\n\naction that interferes with this protected right is unsustainable unless proved to further a\n\nstate interest. Brantley and Fyfe require the state to prove that a state action that\n\ninterferes with protected educational choices of its public-school employees furthers the\n\nstate’s interest in the efficient operation of its schools. Nothing about those two decisions\n\nsuggests that the state can forgo this burden with respect to its more senior employees.19\n\nWe therefore hold that no reasonable official could conclude that the application of the\n\nschool district’s public-school patronage policy to Barrow was constitutional.20\n\n       REVERSED and REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n       19\n                In support of his claim that the right of public-school employees to enroll their\nchildren in private school is not clearly established, Smith offered the testimony of several\nprofessional educators, all of whom opined that patronage policies like the one in this case are\nlawful or are of uncertain legality. The question whether an asserted constitutional right is clearly\nestablished is one of law. Smith’s subjective reasonableness has no place in our inquiry.\n       20\n                In so holding, we express no opinion on the particular degree of scrutiny a state\naction must undergo to withstand a challenge to its constitutionality in a case like this one.\nInstead, we simply recognize that the state cannot strip its school employees of the right to\nchoose a private-school education for their children without proving that the unfettered exercise\nof this right will undermine a state interest. Barrow and amici curiae argue that any state action\nthat interferes with this right is subject to strict scrutiny. We need not take up this question today.\nIn the absence of objective proof that Barrow’s choice of a private-school education for her\nchildren will undermine a state interest the district’s patronage policy fails irrespective of the\ndegree of scrutiny applied.\n\n                                                  8\n\f</pre>",
