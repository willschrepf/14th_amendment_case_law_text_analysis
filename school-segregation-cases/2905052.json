The district court granted the District’s motion for summary judgment\nwith respect to the federal claims and dismissed Humphries’s state law claims without\n\fprejudice. Both parties appeal, and for the reasons discussed below, we affirm in part\nand reverse in part.\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n\n       Humphries, a white female with a doctorate degree in elementary education, has\nbeen employed with the District since 1984 and has worked as an elementary school\ncounselor since 1989. Since 2001, Humphries has applied for virtually every\nelementary school assistant principal position that has been available in the District,\nincluding two such openings in August 2005. In 2007, Humphries also applied for a\ndirector of counseling services position with the District. In each instance, Humphries\nasserts that the District preferentially hired black applicants.\n\n        In August 2005, Humphries filed a claim with the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission (“EEOC”), alleging that the District repeatedly denied her\nan assistant principal position based on her race. After receiving a notice from the\nEEOC regarding her right to sue, Humphries filed suit in the district court on May 24,\n2006, contending that the District discriminated against her based on her race when\nit failed to promote her to the assistant principal positions and that the District\nbreached its contract with her by failing to give priority consideration to current\nemployees when filling the assistant principal positions.1 Humphries filed an\namended complaint on September 26, 2007, which added the allegation that she was\ndenied the director of counseling services position because of her race.\n\n     Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. In her motion for summary\njudgment, Humphries contended that direct evidence supported her discrimination\n\n\n      1\n       Humphries initially claimed that the District also discriminated against her\nbased on her age. The district court subsequently granted Humphries’s motion to\ndismiss her age discrimination claims.\n\n                                         -2-\n\fclaims, including the District’s policy of using biracial interview committees, the\nDistrict’s announced preference to “employ and advance blacks,” the District’s\npublished racial quotas and goals for hiring black administrators, the District’s\npractice of hiring assistant principals such that at least one assistant principal is of a\ndifferent race than that school’s principal, and statistical evidence establishing that the\nDistrict favors black applicants in its hiring of administrative personnel.\n\n       In its motion for summary judgment, the District argued that its policies for\nemployment and promotion were promulgated in response to court orders requiring\nthe District to desegregate and implement procedures that would make the District\nattractive to minority students, teachers, and administrators. The District has a lengthy\nhistory of involvement in desegregation litigation. See Little Rock Sch. Dist. v. N.\nLittle Rock Sch. Dist., 451 F.3d 528, 529 (8th Cir. 2006) (summarizing the District’s\nhistory of involvement in federal desegregation litigation). In 1982, the Little Rock\nSchool District sued the District, the North Little Rock School District, the State of\nArkansas, and the Arkansas State Board of Education, seeking consolidation of the\nthree Pulaski County school districts as a remedy for allegedly unconstitutional efforts\nto maintain racially segregated schools. See Little Rock Sch. Dist. v. Pulaski County\nSpec. Sch. Dist. No. 1, 778 F.2d 404, 408-09 (8th Cir. 1985) (en banc). This court\naffirmed the district court’s finding that the District acted to perpetuate segregation\nby, among other things, failing to meet staff hiring goals. Id. at 427-28. In response\nto our decision, the District negotiated a settlement agreement with the other school\ndistricts, which we eventually ordered the district court to approve. See Little Rock\nSch. Dist. v. Pulaski County Spec. Sch. Dist. No. 1, 921 F.2d 1371, 1388 (8th Cir.\n1990). We also ordered the creation of the Office of Desegregation Monitoring\n(“ODM”) to assist the district court in its supervision of the school districts. See id.\nThe District operated under that settlement agreement until March 2000, when the\ndistrict court approved a new plan submitted by the District called “Plan 2000.” Little\nRock Sch. Dist. v. Pulaski County Spec. Sch. Dist. No.1, Case No. 4:82-cv-866, Doc.\nNo. 3347, at 2 (E.D. Ark. Mar. 21, 2000).\n\n                                           -3-\n\f       Regarding staffing, Plan 2000 requires that the District “recruit applicants for\neach available administrative position . . . in a manner designed to communicate,\nbroadly, its availability and to develop a racially diverse pool of applicants.” It also\nrequires the District to “allocate teachers and other professional staff in a manner\nwhich avoids the racial identification of schools.” The District’s assistant\nsuperintendent for desegregation has “the authority to direct that additional\nrecruitment take place prior to the offering of the position to a particular applicant.”\nFurther, the District’s compliance with Plan 2000 is subject to continuous monitoring\nby the ODM.2\n\n       The district court granted summary judgment to the District, holding that\nHumphries failed to set forth direct evidence of unlawful discrimination because she\n“presented no evidence that the ‘affirmative action’ plan played any part in the\nDistrict’s decisions not to promote her.” The court further held that even if\nHumphries could establish that the District followed its affirmative action plan in\nfailing to promote her, Humphries could not establish that its plan was invalid. The\ncourt also dismissed Humphries’s state law claims without prejudice. Humphries\nappeals the district court’s grant of summary judgment to the District and denial of her\nmotion for summary judgment. The District cross-appeals the district court’s\ndismissal of Humphries’s state law claims without prejudice.\n\nII.   DISCUSSION\n\n       “We review a district court’s decision on cross-motions for summary judgment\nde novo.” Thirty and 141, L.P. v. Lowe’s Home Ctrs., Inc., 565 F.3d 443, 445-46 (8th\nCir. 2009). “Summary judgment is appropriate when, viewing the facts in the light\n\n\n      2\n       In May 2003, the ODM found that the District “lacked a consistent guideline\nthat defined what constituted a diverse pool of applicants.” In December 2006, the\nODM found that the District still had no guideline for what constituted a diverse pool\nof applicants.\n\n                                          -4-\n\fmost favorable to the non-movant, there are no genuine issues of material fact and the\nmovant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Id. at 446. “A genuine issue of\nmaterial fact exists if a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the party opposing\nthe motion.” Chao v. Barbeque Ventures, LLC, 547 F.3d 938, 941 (8th Cir. 2008).3\n\n       Humphries’s claims may survive the District’s motion for summary judgment\nin one of two ways. First, Humphries “may present admissible evidence directly\nindicating unlawful discrimination, that is, evidence showing a specific link between\nthe alleged discriminatory animus and the challenged decision, sufficient to support\na finding by a reasonable fact finder that an illegitimate criterion actually motivated\nthe adverse employment action.” See Fields v. Shelter Mut. Ins. Co., 520 F.3d 859,\n863 (8th Cir. 2008). In the alternative, Humphries may present evidence “creating an\ninference of unlawful discrimination under the burden-shifting framework established\nin McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04 (1973).” See Fields,\n520 F.3d at 863-64 (parallel citations omitted).\n\n        Under the McDonnell Douglas framework, Humphries can establish a prima\nfacie case of discrimination by showing: “(1) that she is a member of a protected\nclass; (2) that she was meeting her employer’s legitimate job expectations; (3) that she\nsuffered an adverse employment action; and (4) that similarly situated employees\noutside the protected class were treated differently.” See id. at 864. If Humphries\nmeets her burden to establish a prima facie case of discrimination, the burden then\nshifts to the District “to establish a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for taking the\nallegedly discriminatory action.” See Hammer v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 722, 724 (8th\nCir. 2004). If the District puts forth such a reason, Humphries must then show that\nthe District’s proffered explanation is pretextual or her claims will fail. See id.\n\n\n      3\n        Because Humphries’s Title VII and §§ 1981 and 1983 claims “‘set forth\nparallel, substantially identical, legal theories of recovery,’ we apply the same analysis\nto” each claim. See Fields v. Shelter Mut. Ins. Co., 520 F.3d 859, 863 n.3 (8th Cir.\n2008) (quoting Kim v. Nash Finch Co., 123 F.3d 1046, 1063 (8th Cir. 1997)).\n\n                                           -5-\n\f      A. Assistant Principal Positions\n\n        Humphries first contends that the district court erred by finding that she\npresented no direct evidence of unlawful discrimination. In particular, she points to\nevidence of the District’s affirmative action policies. The District does not dispute\nthat it has affirmative action policies. For example, the District does not dispute that\nits policy is to use biracial committees to conduct interviews when filling above-entry-\nlevel positions, and it concedes that it used biracial committees to select the candidates\nfor the assistant principal positions sought by Humphries. The District also does not\ndeny that its job postings for the two assistant principal positions announced in August\n2005 included the following language: THE DISTRICT WILL MAKE SPECIAL\nEFFORTS TO EMPLOY AND ADVANCE WOMEN, BLACKS, AND\nHANDICAPPED PERSONS. Further, the District’s published hiring goals include\nhaving at least one minority administrator at each elementary school and “attain[ing]\na ratio of black administrators in the [District] in proportion to the ratio of black\ncertified personnel in the [D]istrict in the preceding year.” Members of the biracial\ninterview committees are trained to abide by the District’s “racial equality” policies.\n\n       The District does, however, dispute Humphries’s assertion that it has a policy\nof hiring assistant principals such that at least one assistant principal at each school\nis of a different race than that school’s principal. Humphries contends that she\npresented sufficient evidence to create a question of fact about whether the district has\nsuch a policy. She points to evidence that from October 2002 to August 2005, black\napplicants were hired for twelve out of fourteen assistant principal openings and, in\neleven of those instances, the principal at the school was white. In the twelfth\ninstance, the school’s principal was black, but the school already had one white\nassistant principal. The two white assistant principals were hired at schools where the\nprincipals were black. Humphries’s expert concluded that a statistical analysis of this\nevidence showed that the District has a policy of biracially pairing principals and\nassistant principals because black applicants were selected at schools with white\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fprincipals in excess of 5.64 standard deviations above what would have been expected\nin the absence of such a policy, based on the relevant labor market. Cf. Hazelwood\nSch. Dist. v. United States, 433 U.S. 299, 309 n.14 (1977) (suggesting that standard\ndeviations between 2 and 3 constitute acceptable statistical proof of discrimination).\n\n        The District argues that Humphries’s statistical evidence is unreliable,\nchallenging several aspects of her analysis, particularly whether Humphries’s expert\nused the appropriate applicant pool. Humphries’s expert used the number of certified\nteachers in the District as the comparative applicant pool. The District’s expert used\nthe number of applicants for each job as the comparative pool and concluded that the\nstatistical evidence did not support the proposition that the District had such a policy.\nAs the Supreme Court has noted, when a job requires special qualifications,\n“comparisons to the general population (rather than to the smaller group of individuals\nwho possess the necessary qualifications) may have little probative value.” Id. at 308\nn.13. Humphries argues that all certified teachers possess the necsesary qualifications\nfor an assistant principal job, while the District asserts that only certain teachers\npossess the necessary administrative certification. The parties’ different methods of\nanalysis create an issue of fact, and the “determination of the appropriate comparative\nfigures in this case will depend upon further evaluation by the trial court.” See id. at\n312 (“Statistics come in infinite variety. Their usefulness depends on all of the\nsurrounding facts and circumstances. Only the trial court is in a position to make the\nappropriate determination after further findings.” (internal citation and alterations\nomitted)). The district court made no findings regarding Humphries’s statistical\nevidence. It did not, for example, conclude that Humphries’s expert’s analysis was\nflawed because the analysis failed to control for relevant variables. Cf. El Deeb v.\nUniv. of Minn., 60 F.3d 423, 430-31 (8th Cir. 1995) (affirming the district court’s\ngrant of summary judgment where the district court found that the plaintiff’s statistical\nanalysis was insufficient as a matter of law because it failed to control for relevant\nvariables). We cannot say as a matter of law whether one analysis is superior to the\nother. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Humphries, a reasonable jury\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fcould conclude that the District has a policy of pairing assistant principals with\nprincipals of different races.\n\n       The District next argues that each of its affirmative action policies was properly\npromulgated in response to various court orders requiring the District to implement\nprocedures to desegregate and make itself attractive to minority administrators. While\nthis court has not addressed the issue of whether reliance on a court-sanctioned\naffirmative action plan may be direct evidence of discrimination, several of our sister\ncircuits have suggested that an affirmative action plan may be direct evidence of\ndiscrimination if the challenged employment action resulted from the employer acting\nin connection with that plan. See Frank v. Xerox Corp., 347 F.3d 130, 137 (5th Cir.\n2003) (also requiring a showing that the plan is invalid); Bass v. Bd. of County\nComm’rs, 256 F.3d 1095, 1110 (11th Cir. 2001) (same); McGarry v. Bd. of County\nComm’rs, 175 F.3d 1193, 1200 (10th Cir. 1999); Brown v. McLean, 159 F.3d 898, 904\n(4th Cir. 1998); Ceratto v. S.F. Cmty. Coll. Dist., 26 F.3d 968, 976 (9th Cir. 1994).\n\n       We now join our sister circuits in concluding that evidence that an employer\nfollowed an affirmative action plan in taking a challenged adverse employment action\nmay constitute direct evidence of unlawful discrimination. If the employer defends\nby asserting that it acted pursuant to a valid affirmative action plan, the question then\nbecomes whether the affirmative action plan is valid under Title VII and the Equal\nProtection Clause. See Bass, 256 F.3d at 1113, cf. Ricci v. Destefano, 557 U.S. ---,\n129 S. Ct. 2658, 2673 (2009) (holding that a city’s making promotion decisions based\non race would violate Title VII without a “valid defense”); Donaghy v. City of Omaha,\n933 F.2d 1448, 1458 (8th Cir. 1991) (holding that satisfaction of the four-part\nMcDonnell Douglas test will not necessarily show a prima facie violation of § 1983\nin a reverse discrimination case where the employer was acting pursuant to a “bona\nfide affirmative action plan,” but not discussing whether evidence of an employer’s\nacting pursuant to the affirmative action plan would constitute direct evidence of\nunlawful discrimination).\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\f        Because the District does not dispute the existence of several of its affirmative\naction policies, Humphries must next show that the District acted pursuant to those\npolicies in failing to promote her to the assistant principal positions. See Fields, 520\nF.3d at 863 (requiring a “specific link between the alleged discriminatory animus and\nthe challenged decision”). We conclude that Humphries has raised a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact concerning whether there was a specific link between the District’s\ndecision not to promote her and the District’s various affirmative action policies.\nHumphries presented evidence that the District’s interview committees are instructed\nto abide by the District’s affirmative action policies. The District’s published hiring\ngoals include hiring at least one minority administrator at each school and attaining\na ratio of black administrators in proportion to the number of black certified personnel\nin the District. And, as explained above, Humphries created a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact concerning whether the District has a policy of hiring assistant principals\nwho are of a different race than the principal at a particular school. A reasonable jury\ncould conclude that interviewers, who had been trained in the District’s “racial\nequality” policies, effectuated those policies through their scoring and ranking of\napplicants and that the District therefore acted pursuant to its affirmative action\npolicies when it failed to promote Humphries to one of the assistant principal\npositions. See Bass, 256 F.3d at 1112-13; Frank, 347 F.3d at 137 (finding direct\nevidence of unlawful discrimination where the employer explicitly identified racial\ngoals and managers were evaluated on how well they complied with the affirmative\naction policy’s objectives).\n\n       The District argues that Humphries cannot show that she was adversely affected\nby its affirmative action policies because her low scores during her initial interviews\nprecluded her from reaching the final stage of interviewing. The District relies on\nDonaghy, in which we held that the plaintiff, a white male, did not have standing to\nchallenge his employer’s decision to interview and promote a black applicant because\nthe plaintiff’s scores on a multiple choice test left him ranked below several other\napplicants. Donaghy, 933 F.2d at 1454-55. However, there was no allegation in\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fDonaghy that the multiple choice test was biased against whites or subjective in any\nother way. By contrast, Humphries asserts that the District’s interviewers were\ninfluenced by the District’s affirmative action policies and that their rankings were\ntherefore biased by their desire to comply with those policies. Thus, Donaghy does\nnot support the District’s position. As explained above, Humphries has met her\nburden of raising a genuine issue of material fact about whether there was a specific\nlink between the District’s failure to promote her and the District’s affirmative action\npolicies.\n\n       Finally, to defeat summary judgment, Humphries must show that the District’s\naffirmative action policies are invalid. See Bass, 256 F.3d at 1113; cf. Johnson v.\nTransp. Agency, 480 U.S. 616, 626-27 (1987) (explaining that the burden is on the\nTitle VII plaintiff to show that an affirmative action policy is invalid). An affirmative\naction policy is valid if the policy is remedial and narrowly tailored to meet the goal\nof remedying the effects of past discrimination. Donaghy, 933 F.2d at 1458. A policy\nmay be considered remedial if the employer has identified a “manifest imbalance” in\nthe work force. Maitland v. Univ. of Minn., 155 F.3d 1013, 1016 (8th Cir. 1998)\n(quoting Johnson, 480 U.S. at 631). A policy may be shown to be remedial through\nevidence that it was implemented “in adherence to a court order, whether entered by\nconsent or after litigation.” Donaghy, 933 F.2d at 1459; see also Maitland, 155 F.3d\nat 1017. But a policy may not “unnecessarily trammel” the rights of non-minorities,\nand it must be “intended to attain a balance, not to maintain one.” Maitland, 155 F.3d\nat 1016 (internal quotation and alteration omitted).\n\n       The District contends that its policies are consistent with Plan 2000 and with\nprevious court orders, as well as with mandates from the ODM in response to its\nfindings concerning the District’s implementation of Plan 2000. Although the district\ncourt found that the District’s policies were valid, it did not discuss the basis for that\nfinding. The court merely noted that “[w]hile Humphries argues that the District is\nno longer subject to monitoring as to its administrative staffing and has met or perhaps\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fexceeded its goals, the Court is not prepared to say that the District’s plan is invalid\nand that the District is no longer subject to an agreement approved by the court in the\nLittle Rock School Desegregation Case.” If the District’s affirmative action policies\nwere implemented pursuant to court orders, that would “not guarantee that the\n[policies] serve a remedial purpose,” but “the heightened judicial oversight inherent\nin a properly entered [court order]” would support the District’s argument that its\npolices are remedial. See id. at 1016-17 (internal quotations and citations omitted).\nHowever, at oral argument the District could not identify with specificity which court\norders, besides Plan 2000, that it was bound by or whether the ODM had required it\nto implement other policies in response to the ODM’s monitoring. Without this\ninformation, we cannot determine whether the District’s affirmative action policies are\nconsistent with court orders or ODM mandates.\n\n       Moreover, the District’s assertion that its policies were implemented in\nadherence to Plan 2000 does not support its argument that its polices are remedial.\nMany of the District’s policies seem to be aimed at increasing the number of minority\nadministrators hired. However, Plan 2000 merely requires the District to attain a\nracially diverse applicant pool for administrative positions; it does not set hiring goals.\nAs the District conceded at oral argument, there is nothing in Plan 2000 related to\nbiracial interview committees or hiring quotas for particular positions. Additionally,\nHumphries showed that there is an issue of fact regarding whether the District has a\npolicy of pairing assistant principals with principals of different races. If such a\npolicy exists, it is not a part of Plan 2000. Thus, the District cannot rely on Plan 2000\nto show that its policies were remedial.\n\n      We turn, then, to the question whether the District’s policies were remedial\nbecause they addressed a manifest racial imbalance in the District’s work force. See\nMaitland, 155 F.3d at 1016. We conclude that there are genuine issues of material\nfact related to the questions whether the District’s affirmative action policies\naddressed a manifest racial imbalance in the workforce and, relatedly, whether the\n\n\n                                           -11-\n\fpolicies were aimed at attaining a balance in the workforce. See id. at 1018 (reversing\na grant of summary judgment to an employer because the plaintiff “demonstrated that\nthere is a genuine issue of material fact on the question of whether there was a\nmanifest . . . imbalance in faculty salaries based on gender”). The parties did not\nfocus on this issue in their briefs on appeal or in the district court, though Humphries\ndid present evidence that the District’s annual reports claim that the District\n“continues to meet” its racial quotas for administrators. Humphries contends, and we\nagree, that this evidence creates a genuine issue of material fact about whether there\nwas a manifest imbalance in the workforce and whether the District is impermissibly\nmaintaining, rather than attaining, a racial balance. See id. Because there are genuine\nquestions of material fact remaining, we are unable to determine whether the District’s\naffirmative action policies are valid as a matter of law. See id.\n\n        Accordingly, we find that Humphries has presented sufficient direct evidence\nof unlawful race discrimination by showing that there are genuine issues of material\nfact regarding the District’s affirmative action policies, regarding whether the District\nacted pursuant to those policies when it failed to promote her to the assistant principal\npositions, and regarding whether the District’s affirmative action policies are valid.\nWe therefore reverse the district court’s grant of the District’s motion for summary\njudgment with regard to Humphries’s claims that the District discriminated against her\nwhen it refused to promote her to the assistant principal positions.4\n\n      B. Director of Counseling Services Position\n\n      Humphries failed to file a complaint of unlawful discrimination with the EEOC\nwith respect to the District’s failure to promote her to the director of counseling\nservices position. “Although an EEOC complaint need not specifically articulate the\n\n      4\n       Because there are genuine issues of material fact concerning Humphries’s\nclaims, the district court did not err in denying Humphries’s motion for summary\njudgment.\n\n                                          -12-\n\fprecise claim, it must nevertheless be sufficient to give the employer notice of the\nsubject matter of the charge and identify generally the basis for a claim.” Fair v.\nNorris, 480 F.3d 865, 867 n.2 (8th Cir. 2007) (internal quotation omitted). Thus, we\nagree with the district court that summary judgment is appropriate because Humphries\nfailed to exhaust her administrative remedies on her claim that the District’s failure\nto promote her to the director of counseling services position was racially\ndiscriminatory. See Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 114 (2002)\n(explaining that discrete acts such as failure to hire are “easy to identify,” and noting\nthat “[e]ach incident of [alleged] discrimination . . . constitutes a separate actionable\n‘unlawful employment practice’”).\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the district court’s grant of summary\njudgment to the District with respect to Humphries’s assistant principal claims, affirm\nthe grant of summary judgment on her director of counseling claim, and remand for\nproceedings consistent with this opinion. We also reinstate Humphries’s state law\nclaims so that the district court may reconsider whether to hear the state law claims\nalong with the federal claims. See Rorie v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 151 F.3d 757,\n763 (8th Cir. 1998).\n\nMELLOY, Circuit Judge, concurring in part.\n\n       While I agree with the majority’s opinion in large part, I write separately to\nemphasize that compliance with a valid remedial consent decree is a complete defense\nto claims for individualized relief. See Martinez v. City of St. Louis, 539 F.3d 857,\n861 (8th Cir. 2008). On remand, the district court’s inquiry should focus on whether\nthe policies now at issue were implemented pursuant to the consent decree.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\f        This is not the first time we have considered a discrimination claim in the\ncontext of a consent decree, and not all consent decrees play the same role in any\nensuing litigation. In Maitland v. University of Minnesota, a male university faculty\nmember brought a gender-based discrimination claim against a university, challenging\nthe university’s affirmative action salary plan. 155 F.3d 1015 (8th Cir. 1998). In that\ncase, we repeated our holding in Donaghy v. City of Omaha, 933 F.2d 1448, 1459 (8th\nCir. 1991), that “the employer’s required showing in defense of its plan remains the\nsame notwithstanding the court’s sanction.” Maitland, 155 F.3d at 1016. Importantly,\nhowever, we noted in Maitland that the affirmative action plan could not “be said to\nhave been imposed after making a formal finding of intentional discrimination.” Id.\n(internal quotation omitted). In discounting the relevance of the consent decree, we\nnoted that the court issuing the decree “frankly acknowledge[d] there [was] an open\nquestion as to whether discrimination even exist[ed].” Id. at 1018. Similarly, in\nDonaghy, we distinguished the consent decree there at issue from “a remedial plan\nthat a court has imposed after making a formal finding of intentional discrimination.”\n933 F.2d at 1459. While it remains true that an affirmative action policy implemented\npursuant to a court-approved compromise may not always “guarantee that the policies\nserve a remedial purpose,” ante, at *11 (alteration omitted), the same cannot be said\nof all policies or all consent decrees.\n\n       In contrast to Maitland and Donaghy, and notwithstanding Humphries’s\nassertions to the contrary, the historically pervasive discrimination in the District has\nbeen subject to decades of litigation, and desegregation of administrative staff has\nlong been considered integral to the broader desegregation goals. See, e.g., Little\nRock Sch. Dist. v. N. Little Rock Sch. Dist., 451 F.3d 528, 529 (8th Cir. 2006); Little\nRock Sch. Dist. v. Pulaski County Spec. Sch. Dist. No. 1, 778 F.2d 404 (8th Cir.\n1985) (en banc). As such, Maitland and Donaghy are limited in their present\napplication. Here, unless the remedial consent decree was invalid when entered into,\ncompliance with the decree “is a complete defense to . . . claims for damages and other\nindividualized relief” until such time as the decree is modified or dissolved. Martinez,\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\f539 F.3d at 861. Here, the validity of the consent decree when entered into remains\nunchallenged, and the consent decree had not been dissolved at the time of the alleged\ndiscrimination (and has not been dissolved to date). Thus, the primary question is not\nwhether the affirmative action policies were independently remedial nor whether there\nwas a manifest imbalance in assistant principal positions but whether the affirmative\naction policies were implemented pursuant to the remedial consent decree.\n\n       The majority correctly explains that Humphries has raised a triable question as\nto whether the District’s affirmative action policies were linked to its decision not to\npromote her but that she must also show that the relevant policies are invalid. Ante,\nat *10. In light of the existing remedial consent decree, however, the initial focus of\nthe validity analysis must be whether the affirmative action policies at issue fall within\nthe scope of that decree. The express terms of Plan 2000 provide the starting point of\nthis analysis, but they do not provide the ending point, for, as the majority notes, Plan\n2000 is subject to ongoing monitoring by the ODM. Ante, at *4. While the consent\ndecree “cannot be used to justify actions aside from those mandated by its own terms,”\nMartinez, 539 F.3d at 861 (quotation omitted), I disagree with the majority’s\nconclusion that other court orders or ODM mandates would not afford the District the\nsame defense as that which would be provided if found in the express terms of Plan\n2000. See ante, at *11. Accordingly, in determining whether the District’s\naffirmative action plans are valid, on remand the district court should first consider\nwhether the policies were implemented pursuant to the consent decree then in place,\nwhether through the express language of Plan 2000 or otherwise.\n                         ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                          -15-\n\f",

The district court granted the District’s motion for summary judgment\nwith respect to the federal claims and dismissed Humphries’s state law claims without\n\fprejudice. Both parties appeal, and for the reasons discussed below, we affirm in part\nand reverse in part.\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n\n       Humphries, a white female with a doctorate degree in elementary education, has\nbeen employed with the District since 1984 and has worked as an elementary school\ncounselor since 1989. Since 2001, Humphries has applied for virtually every\nelementary school assistant principal position that has been available in the District,\nincluding two such openings in August 2005. In 2007, Humphries also applied for a\ndirector of counseling services position with the District. In each instance, Humphries\nasserts that the District preferentially hired black applicants.\n\n        In August 2005, Humphries filed a claim with the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission (“EEOC”), alleging that the District repeatedly denied her\nan assistant principal position based on her race. After receiving a notice from the\nEEOC regarding her right to sue, Humphries filed suit in the district court on May 24,\n2006, contending that the District discriminated against her based on her race when\nit failed to promote her to the assistant principal positions and that the District\nbreached its contract with her by failing to give priority consideration to current\nemployees when filling the assistant principal positions.1 Humphries filed an\namended complaint on September 26, 2007, which added the allegation that she was\ndenied the director of counseling services position because of her race.\n\n     Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. In her motion for summary\njudgment, Humphries contended that direct evidence supported her discrimination\n\n\n      1\n       Humphries initially claimed that the District also discriminated against her\nbased on her age. The district court subsequently granted Humphries’s motion to\ndismiss her age discrimination claims.\n\n                                         -2-\n\fclaims, including the District’s policy of using biracial interview committees, the\nDistrict’s announced preference to “employ and advance blacks,” the District’s\npublished racial quotas and goals for hiring black administrators, the District’s\npractice of hiring assistant principals such that at least one assistant principal is of a\ndifferent race than that school’s principal, and statistical evidence establishing that the\nDistrict favors black applicants in its hiring of administrative personnel.\n\n       In its motion for summary judgment, the District argued that its policies for\nemployment and promotion were promulgated in response to court orders requiring\nthe District to desegregate and implement procedures that would make the District\nattractive to minority students, teachers, and administrators. The District has a lengthy\nhistory of involvement in desegregation litigation. See Little Rock Sch. Dist. v. N.\nLittle Rock Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794680\"><a href=\"/opinion/794680/little-rock-school-district-lorene-joshua-leslie-joshua-stacy-joshua-wayne/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">528</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 529 (8th Cir. 2006) (summarizing the District’s\nhistory of involvement in federal desegregation litigation). In 1982, the Little Rock\nSchool District sued the District, the North Little Rock School District, the State of\nArkansas, and the Arkansas State Board of Education, seeking consolidation of the\nthree Pulaski County school districts as a remedy for allegedly unconstitutional efforts\nto maintain racially segregated schools. See Little Rock Sch. Dist. v. Pulaski County\nSpec. Sch. Dist. No. 1, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"461402\"><a href=\"/opinion/461402/little-rock-school-district-v-pulaski-county-special-school-district-no-1/\"><span class=\"volume\">778</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">404</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 408-09 (8th Cir. 1985) (en banc). This court\naffirmed the district court’s finding that the District acted to perpetuate segregation\nby, among other things, failing to meet staff hiring goals. Id. at 427-28. In response\nto our decision, the District negotiated a settlement agreement with the other school\ndistricts, which we eventually ordered the district court to approve. See Little Rock\nSch. Dist. v. Pulaski County Spec. Sch. Dist. No. 1, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553317\"><a href=\"/opinion/553317/little-rock-school-district-lorene-joshua-as-next-friend-of-minors-leslie/\"><span class=\"volume\">921</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1371</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1388 (8th Cir.\n1990). We also ordered the creation of the Office of Desegregation Monitoring\n(“ODM”) to assist the district court in its supervision of the school districts. See id.\nThe District operated under that settlement agreement until March 2000, when the\ndistrict court approved a new plan submitted by the District called “Plan 2000.” Little\nRock Sch. Dist. v. Pulaski County Spec. Sch. Dist. No.1, Case No. 4:82-cv-866, Doc.\nNo. 3347, at 2 (E.D. Ark. Mar. 21, 2000).\n\n                                           -3-\n\f       Regarding staffing, Plan 2000 requires that the District “recruit applicants for\neach available administrative position . . . in a manner designed to communicate,\nbroadly, its availability and to develop a racially diverse pool of applicants.” It also\nrequires the District to “allocate teachers and other professional staff in a manner\nwhich avoids the racial identification of schools.” The District’s assistant\nsuperintendent for desegregation has “the authority to direct that additional\nrecruitment take place prior to the offering of the position to a particular applicant.”\nFurther, the District’s compliance with Plan 2000 is subject to continuous monitoring\nby the ODM.2\n\n       The district court granted summary judgment to the District, holding that\nHumphries failed to set forth direct evidence of unlawful discrimination because she\n“presented no evidence that the ‘affirmative action’ plan played any part in the\nDistrict’s decisions not to promote her.” The court further held that even if\nHumphries could establish that the District followed its affirmative action plan in\nfailing to promote her, Humphries could not establish that its plan was invalid. The\ncourt also dismissed Humphries’s state law claims without prejudice. Humphries\nappeals the district court’s grant of summary judgment to the District and denial of her\nmotion for summary judgment. The District cross-appeals the district court’s\ndismissal of Humphries’s state law claims without prejudice.\n\nII.   DISCUSSION\n\n       “We review a district court’s decision on cross-motions for summary judgment\nde novo.” Thirty and 141, L.P. v. Lowe’s Home Ctrs., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1211149\"><a href=\"/opinion/1211149/thirty-and-141-lp-v-lowes-home-centers-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">565</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 445-46 (8th\nCir. 2009). “Summary judgment is appropriate when, viewing the facts in the light\n\n\n      2\n       In May 2003, the ODM found that the District “lacked a consistent guideline\nthat defined what constituted a diverse pool of applicants.” In December 2006, the\nODM found that the District still had no guideline for what constituted a diverse pool\nof applicants.\n\n                                          -4-\n\fmost favorable to the non-movant, there are no genuine issues of material fact and the\nmovant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Id. at 446. “A genuine issue of\nmaterial fact exists if a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the party opposing\nthe motion.” Chao v. Barbeque Ventures, LLC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1226471\"><a href=\"/opinion/1226471/chao-v-barbeque-ventures-llc/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">938</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 941 (8th Cir. 2008).3\n\n       Humphries’s claims may survive the District’s motion for summary judgment\nin one of two ways. First, Humphries “may present admissible evidence directly\nindicating unlawful discrimination, that is, evidence showing a specific link between\nthe alleged discriminatory animus and the challenged decision, sufficient to support\na finding by a reasonable fact finder that an illegitimate criterion actually motivated\nthe adverse employment action.” See Fields v. Shelter Mut. Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1201129\"><a href=\"/opinion/1201129/fields-v-shelter-mut-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">859</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n863 (8th Cir. 2008). In the alternative, Humphries may present evidence “creating an\ninference of unlawful discrimination under the burden-shifting framework established\nin McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 802-04 (1973).” See Fields,\n520 F.3d at 863-64 (parallel citations omitted).\n\n        Under the McDonnell Douglas framework, Humphries can establish a prima\nfacie case of discrimination by showing: “(1) that she is a member of a protected\nclass; (2) that she was meeting her employer’s legitimate job expectations; (3) that she\nsuffered an adverse employment action; and (4) that similarly situated employees\noutside the protected class were treated differently.” See id. at 864. If Humphries\nmeets her burden to establish a prima facie case of discrimination, the burden then\nshifts to the District “to establish a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for taking the\nallegedly discriminatory action.” See Hammer v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787748\"><a href=\"/opinion/787748/charles-w-hammer-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general-department-of-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">383</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">722</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 724 (8th\nCir. 2004). If the District puts forth such a reason, Humphries must then show that\nthe District’s proffered explanation is pretextual or her claims will fail. See id.\n\n\n      3\n        Because Humphries’s Title VII and §§ 1981 and 1983 claims “‘set forth\nparallel, substantially identical, legal theories of recovery,’ we apply the same analysis\nto” each claim. See Fields v. Shelter Mut. Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1201129\"><a href=\"/opinion/1201129/fields-v-shelter-mut-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">859</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 863 n.3 (8th Cir.\n2008) (quoting Kim v.

Assistant Principal Positions\n\n        Humphries first contends that the district court erred by finding that she\npresented no direct evidence of unlawful discrimination. In particular, she points to\nevidence of the District’s affirmative action policies. The District does not dispute\nthat it has affirmative action policies. For example, the District does not dispute that\nits policy is to use biracial committees to conduct interviews when filling above-entry-\nlevel positions, and it concedes that it used biracial committees to select the candidates\nfor the assistant principal positions sought by Humphries. The District also does not\ndeny that its job postings for the two assistant principal positions announced in August\n2005 included the following language: THE DISTRICT WILL MAKE SPECIAL\nEFFORTS TO EMPLOY AND ADVANCE WOMEN, BLACKS, AND\nHANDICAPPED PERSONS. Further, the District’s published hiring goals include\nhaving at least one minority administrator at each elementary school and “attain[ing]\na ratio of black administrators in the [District] in proportion to the ratio of black\ncertified personnel in the [D]istrict in the preceding year.” Members of the biracial\ninterview committees are trained to abide by the District’s “racial equality” policies.\n\n       The District does, however, dispute Humphries’s assertion that it has a policy\nof hiring assistant principals such that at least one assistant principal at each school\nis of a different race than that school’s principal. Humphries contends that she\npresented sufficient evidence to create a question of fact about whether the district has\nsuch a policy. She points to evidence that from October 2002 to August 2005, black\napplicants were hired for twelve out of fourteen assistant principal openings and, in\neleven of those instances, the principal at the school was white. In the twelfth\ninstance, the school’s principal was black, but the school already had one white\nassistant principal. The two white assistant principals were hired at schools where the\nprincipals were black. Humphries’s expert concluded that a statistical analysis of this\nevidence showed that the District has a policy of biracially pairing principals and\nassistant principals because black applicants were selected at schools with white\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fprincipals in excess of 5.64 standard deviations above what would have been expected\nin the absence of such a policy, based on the relevant labor market. Cf. Hazelwood\nSch. Dist. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109724\"><a href=\"/opinion/109724/hazelwood-school-dist-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 309 n.14 (1977) (suggesting that standard\ndeviations between 2 and 3 constitute acceptable statistical proof of discrimination).\n\n        The District argues that Humphries’s statistical evidence is unreliable,\nchallenging several aspects of her analysis, particularly whether Humphries’s expert\nused the appropriate applicant pool. Humphries’s expert used the number of certified\nteachers in the District as the comparative applicant pool. The District’s expert used\nthe number of applicants for each job as the comparative pool and concluded that the\nstatistical evidence did not support the proposition that the District had such a policy.\nAs the Supreme Court has noted, when a job requires special qualifications,\n“comparisons to the general population (rather than to the smaller group of individuals\nwho possess the necessary qualifications) may have little probative value.” Id. at 308\nn.13. Humphries argues that all certified teachers possess the necsesary qualifications\nfor an assistant principal job, while the District asserts that only certain teachers\npossess the necessary administrative certification. The parties’ different methods of\nanalysis create an issue of fact, and the “determination of the appropriate comparative\nfigures in this case will depend upon further evaluation by the trial court.” See id. at\n312 (“Statistics come in infinite variety. Their usefulness depends on all of the\nsurrounding facts and circumstances. Only the trial court is in a position to make the\nappropriate determination after further findings.” (internal citation and alterations\nomitted)). The district court made no findings regarding Humphries’s statistical\nevidence. It did not, for example, conclude that Humphries’s expert’s analysis was\nflawed because the analysis failed to control for relevant variables. Cf.

If the employer defends\nby asserting that it acted pursuant to a valid affirmative action plan, the question then\nbecomes whether the affirmative action plan is valid under Title VII and the Equal\nProtection Clause. See Bass, 256 F.3d at 1113, cf. Ricci v.

See Fields, 520\nF.3d at 863 (requiring a “specific link between the alleged discriminatory animus and\nthe challenged decision”). We conclude that Humphries has raised a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact concerning whether there was a specific link between the District’s\ndecision not to promote her and the District’s various affirmative action policies.\nHumphries presented evidence that the District’s interview committees are instructed\nto abide by the District’s affirmative action policies. The District’s published hiring\ngoals include hiring at least one minority administrator at each school and attaining\na ratio of black administrators in proportion to the number of black certified personnel\nin the District. And, as explained above, Humphries created a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact concerning whether the District has a policy of hiring assistant principals\nwho are of a different race than the principal at a particular school. A reasonable jury\ncould conclude that interviewers, who had been trained in the District’s “racial\nequality” policies, effectuated those policies through their scoring and ranking of\napplicants and that the District therefore acted pursuant to its affirmative action\npolicies when it failed to promote Humphries to one of the assistant principal\npositions. See Bass, 256 F.3d at 1112-13; Frank, 347 F.3d at 137 (finding direct\nevidence of unlawful discrimination where the employer explicitly identified racial\ngoals and managers were evaluated on how well they complied with the affirmative\naction policy’s objectives).\n\n       The District argues that Humphries cannot show that she was adversely affected\nby its affirmative action policies because her low scores during her initial interviews\nprecluded her from reaching the final stage of interviewing. The District relies on\nDonaghy, in which we held that the plaintiff, a white male, did not have standing to\nchallenge his employer’s decision to interview and promote a black applicant because\nthe plaintiff’s scores on a multiple choice test left him ranked below several other\napplicants. Donaghy, 933 F.2d at 1454-55. However, there was no allegation in\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fDonaghy that the multiple choice test was biased against whites or subjective in any\nother way. By contrast, Humphries asserts that the District’s interviewers were\ninfluenced by the District’s affirmative action policies and that their rankings were\ntherefore biased by their desire to comply with those policies. Thus, Donaghy does\nnot support the District’s position. As explained above, Humphries has met her\nburden of raising a genuine issue of material fact about whether there was a specific\nlink between the District’s failure to promote her and the District’s affirmative action\npolicies.\n\n       Finally, to defeat summary judgment, Humphries must show that the District’s\naffirmative action policies are invalid. See Bass, 256 F.3d at 1113; cf. Johnson v.\nTransp. Agency, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111846\"><a href=\"/opinion/111846/johnson-v-transportation-agency-santa-clara-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">616</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 626-27 (1987) (explaining that the burden is on the\nTitle VII plaintiff to show that an affirmative action policy is invalid). An affirmative\naction policy is valid if the policy is remedial and narrowly tailored to meet the goal\nof remedying the effects of past discrimination. Donaghy, 933 F.2d at 1458. A policy\nmay be considered remedial if the employer has identified a “manifest imbalance” in\nthe work force. Maitland v. Univ. of Minn., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757831\"><a href=\"/opinion/757831/ian-maitland-v-university-of-minnesota-regents-of-the-university-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1013</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1016 (8th Cir. 1998)\n(quoting Johnson, 480 U.S. at 631). A policy may be shown to be remedial through\nevidence that it was implemented “in adherence to a court order, whether entered by\nconsent or after litigation.” Donaghy, 933 F.2d at 1459; see also Maitland, 155 F.3d\nat 1017. But a policy may not “unnecessarily trammel” the rights of non-minorities,\nand it must be “intended to attain a balance, not to maintain one.” Maitland, 155 F.3d\nat 1016 (internal quotation and alteration omitted).\n\n       The District contends that its policies are consistent with Plan 2000 and with\nprevious court orders, as well as with mandates from the ODM in response to its\nfindings concerning the District’s implementation of Plan 2000. Although the district\ncourt found that the District’s policies were valid, it did not discuss the basis for that\nfinding. The court merely noted that “[w]hile Humphries argues that the District is\nno longer subject to monitoring as to its administrative staffing and has met or perhaps\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fexceeded its goals, the Court is not prepared to say that the District’s plan is invalid\nand that the District is no longer subject to an agreement approved by the court in the\nLittle Rock School Desegregation Case.” If the District’s affirmative action policies\nwere implemented pursuant to court orders, that would “not guarantee that the\n[policies] serve a remedial purpose,” but “the heightened judicial oversight inherent\nin a properly entered [court order]” would support the District’s argument that its\npolices are remedial. See id. at 1016-17 (internal quotations and citations omitted).\nHowever, at oral argument the District could not identify with specificity which court\norders, besides Plan 2000, that it was bound by or whether the ODM had required it\nto implement other policies in response to the ODM’s monitoring. Without this\ninformation, we cannot determine whether the District’s affirmative action policies are\nconsistent with court orders or ODM mandates.\n\n       Moreover, the District’s assertion that its policies were implemented in\nadherence to Plan 2000 does not support its argument that its polices are remedial.\nMany of the District’s policies seem to be aimed at increasing the number of minority\nadministrators hired. However, Plan 2000 merely requires the District to attain a\nracially diverse applicant pool for administrative positions; it does not set hiring goals.\nAs the District conceded at oral argument, there is nothing in Plan 2000 related to\nbiracial interview committees or hiring quotas for particular positions. Additionally,\nHumphries showed that there is an issue of fact regarding whether the District has a\npolicy of pairing assistant principals with principals of different races. If such a\npolicy exists, it is not a part of Plan 2000. Thus, the District cannot rely on Plan 2000\nto show that its policies were remedial.\n\n      We turn, then, to the question whether the District’s policies were remedial\nbecause they addressed a manifest racial imbalance in the District’s work force. See\nMaitland, 155 F.3d at 1016. We conclude that there are genuine issues of material\nfact related to the questions whether the District’s affirmative action policies\naddressed a manifest racial imbalance in the workforce and, relatedly, whether the\n\n\n                                           -11-\n\fpolicies were aimed at attaining a balance in the workforce. See id. at 1018 (reversing\na grant of summary judgment to an employer because the plaintiff “demonstrated that\nthere is a genuine issue of material fact on the question of whether there was a\nmanifest . . . imbalance in faculty salaries based on gender”). The parties did not\nfocus on this issue in their briefs on appeal or in the district court, though Humphries\ndid present evidence that the District’s annual reports claim that the District\n“continues to meet” its racial quotas for administrators. Humphries contends, and we\nagree, that this evidence creates a genuine issue of material fact about whether there\nwas a manifest imbalance in the workforce and whether the District is impermissibly\nmaintaining, rather than attaining, a racial balance. See id. Because there are genuine\nquestions of material fact remaining, we are unable to determine whether the District’s\naffirmative action policies are valid as a matter of law. See id.\n\n        Accordingly, we find that Humphries has presented sufficient direct evidence\nof unlawful race discrimination by showing that there are genuine issues of material\nfact regarding the District’s affirmative action policies, regarding whether the District\nacted pursuant to those policies when it failed to promote her to the assistant principal\npositions, and regarding whether the District’s affirmative action policies are valid.\nWe therefore reverse the district court’s grant of the District’s motion for summary\njudgment with regard to Humphries’s claims that the District discriminated against her\nwhen it refused to promote her to the assistant principal positions.4\n\n      B. Director of Counseling Services Position\n\n      Humphries failed to file a complaint of unlawful discrimination with the EEOC\nwith respect to the District’s failure to promote her to the director of counseling\nservices position. “Although an EEOC complaint need not specifically articulate the\n\n      4\n       Because there are genuine issues of material fact concerning Humphries’s\nclaims, the district court did not err in denying Humphries’s motion for summary\njudgment.\n\n                                          -12-\n\fprecise claim, it must nevertheless be sufficient to give the employer notice of the\nsubject matter of the charge and identify generally the basis for a claim.” Fair v.\nNorris, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797196\"><a href=\"/opinion/797196/viola-fair-v-larry-norris-director-arkansas-department-of-correction/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">865</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 867 n.2 (8th Cir. 2007) (internal quotation omitted). Thus, we\nagree with the district court that summary judgment is appropriate because Humphries\nfailed to exhaust her administrative remedies on her claim that the District’s failure\nto promote her to the director of counseling services position was racially\ndiscriminatory. See Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121149\"><a href=\"/opinion/121149/national-railroad-passenger-corporation-v-morgan/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 114 (2002)\n(explaining that discrete acts such as failure to hire are “easy to identify,” and noting\nthat “[e]ach incident of [alleged] discrimination . . . constitutes a separate actionable\n‘unlawful employment practice’”).\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the district court’s grant of summary\njudgment to the District with respect to Humphries’s assistant principal claims, affirm\nthe grant of summary judgment on her director of counseling claim, and remand for\nproceedings consistent with this opinion. We also reinstate Humphries’s state law\nclaims so that the district court may reconsider whether to hear the state law claims\nalong with the federal claims. See Rorie v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"756717\"><a href=\"/opinion/756717/77-fair-emplpraccas-bna-512-73-empl-prac-dec-p-45425-lisa-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">757</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n763 (8th Cir. 1998).\n\nMELLOY, Circuit Judge, concurring in part.\n\n       While I agree with the majority’s opinion in large part, I write separately to\nemphasize that compliance with a valid remedial consent decree is a complete defense\nto claims for individualized relief. See Martinez v. City of St. Louis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1427404\"><a href=\"/opinion/1427404/martinez-v-city-of-st-louis/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">857</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n861 (8th Cir. 2008). On remand, the district court’s inquiry should focus on whether\nthe policies now at issue were implemented pursuant to the consent decree.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\f        This is not the first time we have considered a discrimination claim in the\ncontext of a consent decree, and not all consent decrees play the same role in any\nensuing litigation. In Maitland v. University of Minnesota, a male university faculty\nmember brought a gender-based discrimination claim against a university, challenging\nthe university’s affirmative action salary plan. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1015</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Cir. 1998). In that\ncase, we repeated our holding in Donaghy v. City of Omaha, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"561812\"><a href=\"/opinion/561812/thomas-j-donaghy-v-city-of-omaha-a-municipal-corporation-james-skinner/\"><span class=\"volume\">933</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1448</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1459 (8th\nCir. 1991), that “the employer’s required showing in defense of its plan remains the\nsame notwithstanding the court’s sanction.” Maitland, 155 F.3d at 1016. Importantly,\nhowever, we noted in Maitland that the affirmative action plan could not “be said to\nhave been imposed after making a formal finding of intentional discrimination.” Id.\n(internal quotation omitted). In discounting the relevance of the consent decree, we\nnoted that the court issuing the decree “frankly acknowledge[d] there [was] an open\nquestion as to whether discrimination even exist[ed].” Id. at 1018. Similarly, in\nDonaghy, we distinguished the consent decree there at issue from “a remedial plan\nthat a court has imposed after making a formal finding of intentional discrimination.”\n933 F.2d at 1459. While it remains true that an affirmative action policy implemented\npursuant to a court-approved compromise may not always “guarantee that the policies\nserve a remedial purpose,” ante, at *11 (alteration omitted), the same cannot be said\nof all policies or all consent decrees.\n\n       In contrast to Maitland and Donaghy, and notwithstanding Humphries’s\nassertions to the contrary, the historically pervasive discrimination in the District has\nbeen subject to decades of litigation, and desegregation of administrative staff has\nlong been considered integral to the broader desegregation goals. See, e.g., Little\nRock Sch. Dist. v. N. Little Rock Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794680\"><a href=\"/opinion/794680/little-rock-school-district-lorene-joshua-leslie-joshua-stacy-joshua-wayne/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">528</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 529 (8th Cir. 2006); Little\nRock Sch. Dist. v. Pulaski County Spec. Sch. Dist. No. 1, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"461402\"><a href=\"/opinion/461402/little-rock-school-district-v-pulaski-county-special-school-district-no-1/\"><span class=\"volume\">778</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">404</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Cir.\n1985) (en banc). As such, Maitland and Donaghy are limited in their present\napplication. Here, unless the remedial consent decree was invalid when entered into,\ncompliance with the decree “is a complete defense to . . . claims for damages and other\nindividualized relief” until such time as the decree is modified or dissolved. Martinez,\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\f539 F.3d at 861. Here, the validity of the consent decree when entered into remains\nunchallenged, and the consent decree had not been dissolved at the time of the alleged\ndiscrimination (and has not been dissolved to date). Thus, the primary question is not\nwhether the affirmative action policies were independently remedial nor whether there\nwas a manifest imbalance in assistant principal positions but whether the affirmative\naction policies were implemented pursuant to the remedial consent decree.\n\n       The majority correctly explains that Humphries has raised a triable question as\nto whether the District’s affirmative action policies were linked to its decision not to\npromote her but that she must also show that the relevant policies are invalid. Ante,\nat *10. In light of the existing remedial consent decree, however, the initial focus of\nthe validity analysis must be whether the affirmative action policies at issue fall within\nthe scope of that decree. The express terms of Plan 2000 provide the starting point of\nthis analysis, but they do not provide the ending point, for, as the majority notes, Plan\n2000 is subject to ongoing monitoring by the ODM. Ante, at *4. While the consent\ndecree “cannot be used to justify actions aside from those mandated by its own terms,”\nMartinez, 539 F.3d at 861 (quotation omitted), I disagree with the majority’s\nconclusion that other court orders or ODM mandates would not afford the District the\nsame defense as that which would be provided if found in the express terms of Plan\n2000. See ante, at *11. Accordingly, in determining whether the District’s\naffirmative action plans are valid, on remand the district court should first consider\nwhether the policies were implemented pursuant to the consent decree then in place,\nwhether through the express language of Plan 2000 or otherwise.\n                         ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                          -15-\n\f</pre>",
