Howard, appeals from his criminal\n\f                                                                                          2\n\n\nconviction and sentence on four counts of Trafficking in Cocaine, two counts of Possession, and\n\none count of Having Weapons While Under Disability. Howard’s conviction also included eight\n\nforfeiture specifications.\n\n       {¶ 2}      Howard contends that the trial court abused its discretion in rejecting his plea\n\nagreement with the Appellee, the State of Ohio, because it failed to state its reasons for the\n\nrejection on the record. Additionally, Howard argues that the trial court erred in overruling his\n\nmotion to suppress evidence on grounds that police officers exceeded the scope of a search\n\nwarrant. Howard also contends that the trial court abused its discretion in overruling his motion\n\nfor relief from joinder, claiming that joinder of his offenses was unduly prejudicial. Howard\n\nfurther argues that the trial court abused its discretion in overruling his motion for a trial\n\ncontinuance. Finally, Howard contends that the cumulative nature of the trial court’s alleged\n\nerrors denied him the right to a fair trial and due process.\n\n       {¶ 3}      We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting\n\nHoward’s plea agreement. The trial court stated its reasons for the rejection on the record during\n\nHoward’s sentencing hearing, and the trial court’s reasoning was sound.\n\n       {¶ 4}      We next conclude that the trial court did not err in overruling Howard’s motion\n\nto suppress evidence that was obtained by a search warrant. The language in the search warrant\n\nspecifically authorized police officers to search the area in which the evidence was found.\n\nTherefore, the search did not exceed the scope of the warrant.\n\n       {¶ 5}      We also conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling\n\nHoward’s motion for relief from joinder. Howard’s offenses were properly joined pursuant to\n\nCrim.R. 8(A) and R.C. 2901.12(H), and Howard failed to demonstrate that he was unduly\n\nprejudiced as a result of the joinder.\n\f                                                                                        3\n\n\n       {¶ 6}     As a further matter, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling\n\nHoward’s motion for a trial continuance. Howard’s reasons for requesting a continuance were\n\ninsufficient to warrant a continuance and defense counsel’s actions partially contributed to the\n\nneed for a continuance.\n\n       {¶ 7}     Finally, upon finding that the trial court committed no error, we conclude that\n\nthere was no cumulative error which denied Howard’s right to a fair trial and due process.\n\nAccordingly, the judgment of the trial court will be Affirmed.\n\n\n\n                             I. Facts and Course of Proceedings\n\n       {¶ 8}     This case arises from an operation of the Greene County Agencies for Combined\n\nEnforcement Task Force (A.C.E.). A.C.E. is a group of officers from individual police agencies\n\nwithin Greene County who investigate drug trafficking. A.C.E. learned through a confidential\n\ninformant that the Appellant, Christopher T. Howard, was trafficking cocaine. On various\n\noccasions, A.C.E. instructed the confidential informant to call Howard in an attempt to purchase\n\ncocaine.\n\n       {¶ 9}     On January 6, 2011, the confidential informant set up a meeting with Howard at\n\nthe K-Mart parking lot on Indian Ripple Road in the city of Beavercreek, Greene County, Ohio.\n\nAt the meeting, the confidential informant was wired, and he purchased 13.15 grams of cocaine\n\nfrom Howard.\n\n       {¶ 10}    On January 27, 2011, the confidential informant set up another meeting with\n\nHoward at Cruxten Drive in the city of Huber Heights, Montgomery County, Ohio. At the\n\nmeeting, the confidential informant was wired and he purchased 11.94 grams of cocaine from\n\nHoward.\n\f                                                                                           4\n\n\n       {¶ 11}        On March 18, 2011 and March 23, 2011, the confidential informant called\n\nHoward in an attempt to buy one-half ounce (14.25 grams) of cocaine. The telephone calls were\n\nrecorded, and the recordings captured Howard and the confidential informant discussing the\n\npurchase price of cocaine. No meeting or sale resulted from these communications.\n\n       {¶ 12}        Howard drove a white Cadillac Escalade to each meeting with the confidential\n\ninformant.   The Escalade was registered in the name of Howard’s mother, Doris Howard.\n\nHoward’s mother resided at 6135 Sandbury Drive, Huber Heights, Ohio. Howard’s mother\n\ntestified that Howard does not live with her, but that he is always welcome in her home.\n\nHoward receives his mail at his mother’s residence, and his son, and the mother of his son, both\n\nlive at the residence as well.\n\n       {¶ 13}        On March 24, 2011, Detective Richard Miller of A.C.E. obtained a search\n\nwarrant stating that he had probable cause to believe that there was cocaine and other illegal\n\nproperty concealed at 6135 Sandbury Drive. Specifically, the warrant authorized a search:\n\n                a.        upon the person(s) of:\n\n                          1.     Any person found at said residence [6135 Sandbury Dr,\n\n                                 Huber Heights, Ohio]\n\n                b.        within the listed vehicles:\n\n                          1.     1999 Cadillac Escalade white in color Oh reg FBJ4141,\n\n                                 VIN 1GYEK13R7XR413582\n\n                c.        and / or at the following place(s):\n\n                          The dwelling at 6135 Sandbury Dr, Huber Heights, Montgomery\n\n                          County Ohio is a ranch style single family home. * * * At the rear\n\n                          of the residence there is a two car detached garage that has white\n\f                                                                                            5\n\n\n                       vinyl siding, dark colored shingled roof, and white garage door.\n\n                       Surrounding curtilage. * * * Exhibit A attached to Defendant’s\n\n                       Motion to Suppress Evidence (Oct. 5, 2011).\n\n         {¶ 14}   On March 29, 2011, the search warrant was executed by A.C.E. officers at the\n\nresidence of 6135 Sandbury Drive. During the search, the officers discovered 269.63 grams of\n\ncocaine in the trunk of a white Chrysler Sebring. The Sebring was located in the residence’s\n\ntwo-car detached garage. The officers also found various firearms inside the residence. At the\n\ntime, Howard was under a weapons disability due to a prior felony offense for possession of\n\ndrugs.\n\n         {¶ 15}   As a result of A.C.E.’s investigation and search, Howard was indicted in Greene\n\nCounty for three counts of Trafficking in Cocaine in an amount equal to or exceeding ten grams,\n\nbut less than 20 grams, one count of Trafficking in Cocaine in the vicinity of a school in an\n\namount equal to or exceeding 100 grams, but less than 500 grams, two counts of Possession of\n\nCocaine in an amount equal to or exceeding five grams, but less than 25 grams, and one count of\n\nHaving Weapons While Under Disability. His indictment also included a firearm specification\n\nand eight forfeiture specifications. The firearm specification and the specification for trafficking\n\nin the vicinity of a school were later dismissed.\n\n         {¶ 16}   On October 5, 2011, Howard filed a motion to suppress the evidence obtained\n\npursuant to the search warrant. The trial court overruled the motion on April 20, 2012. On\n\nFebruary 29, 2012, Howard filed a motion for relief from prejudicial joinder of offenses. The\n\ntrial court overruled the motion on April 20, 2012.\n\n         {¶ 17}   Prior to trial, Howard and the State negotiated a plea bargain in which Howard\n\nagreed to plead guilty to all counts in exchange for serving a stipulated six-year prison term. A\n\f                                                                                                6\n\n\nfew days before trial, both counsel advised the trial court of the plea bargain, but the trial court\n\nrefused to accept it.\n\n        {¶ 18}    On the day of trial, April 23, 2012, Howard filed a motion for a trial\n\ncontinuance, which the trial court overruled. The trial court also mentioned the plea bargain,\n\nand confirmed on the record that it was rejected. Counsel for the State requested the trial court\n\nto state its reasons for the rejection, but the court failed to give its reasons at that time. Trial\n\nwent forward, and the jury found Howard guilty on all charges. At Howard’s sentencing hearing\n\non May 17, 2012, the trial court stated its reasons for rejecting the plea agreement on the record,\n\nand sentenced Howard to 11 years in prison. Howard subsequently filed an appeal.\n\n\n\n             II. Did the Trial Court Err When it Rejected the Plea Agreement?\n\n        {¶ 19}    Howard’s First Assignment of Error states that:\n\n              The Trial Court Erred in Rejecting a Valid Plea Agreement.\n\n        {¶ 20}    Under this assignment of error, Howard argues that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion when it rejected the parties’ plea agreement on grounds that it failed to give a reason\n\nfor the rejection on the record. The State concedes error in this regard, and claims that the\n\nrecord is insufficient to support the rejection. Based on the record, we disagree.\n\n        {¶ 21}    It is well settled that “[t]he decision to accept or reject a plea bargain rests solely\n\nwithin the discretion of the trial court.” (Citation omitted.) State v. Arde, 190 Ohio App.3d 196,\n\n2010-Ohio-5274, 941 N.E.2d 119, ¶ 18 (2d Dist.). An appellate court generally “reviews a trial\n\ncourt’s rejection of a plea agreement under an abuse of discretion standard.” (Citation omitted.)\n\nState v. Keyes, 4th Dist. Meigs No. 05CA16, 2006-Ohio-5032, ¶ 8. Abuse of discretion is “an\n\nattitude that is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.”             (Citation omitted.)      AAAA\n\f                                                                                             7\n\n\nEnterprises, Inc. v. River Place Community Urban Redevelopment Corp., 50 Ohio St.3d 157,\n\n161, 553 N.E.2d 597 (1990). “A decision is unreasonable if there is no sound reasoning process\n\nthat would support that decision.” Id.\n\n         {¶ 22}    With respect to plea agreements, the trial court “must exercise its discretion\n\nbased on the facts and circumstances before it * * *.” (Citation omitted.) State v. Carter, 124\n\nOhio App.3d 423, 428, 706 N.E.2d 409 (2d Dist. 1997); Accord State v. Raymond, 10th Dist.\n\nFranklin No. 05AP-1043, 2006-Ohio-3259, ¶ 15; State v. Graves, 10th Dist. Franklin No.\n\n98AP-272, 1998 WL 808356, *4 (Nov. 19, 1998). “When a recommended plea bargain is\n\nrejected, the court ought to state reasons for his rejection * * * ” unless “the facts themselves\n\nspeak so eloquently that no statement by the judge is required.” City of Akron v. Ragsdale, 61\n\nOhio App.2d 107, 109, 399 N.E.2d 119 (9th Dist. 1978); Accord State v. Ligon, 12th Dist.\n\nClermont No. CA 2009-09-056, 2010-Ohio-2054, ¶ 8; State v. Brown, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 08\n\nMA 13, 2009-Ohio-1172, ¶ 17; State v. Newland, 4th Dist. Ross No. 02CA2666,\n\n2003-Ohio-3230, ¶ 23. It is good public policy for the trial court to state its reasons for rejecting\n\na plea agreement. State v. Russell, 4th Dist. Highland No. 634, 1987 WL 16081, *2 (Aug. 27,\n\n1987).\n\n         {¶ 23} Prior to the trial in this case, the State requested that the trial court provide its\n\nreasons for rejecting the plea agreement on the record. While the trial court did not initially\n\ncomply with the State’s request, it did eventually state its reasons during Howard’s sentencing\n\nhearing. The trial court stated:\n\n                  You may have gathered from the fact that the Court refused this original\n\n         plea bargain that I felt that six years was not an adequate sentence for someone\n\n         who has alleged to have committed the offenses that [Howard] did, and now a jury\n\f                                                                                                8\n\n\n       has spoken and said you did, indeed commit those offenses.\n\n                The Court, probably more than any other feature, notices the fact that for\n\n       most of your adult life you have been convicted of these same type of offenses,\n\n       possession or trafficking in drugs, both in the State and the Federal System, and a\n\n       substantial portion of your adult life – I’ll call it a substantial portion, you have\n\n       been in prison for these offenses. Transcript Vol. III, p. 589, ln. 20-25, p. 590, ln.\n\n       1-7.\n\n       {¶ 24}    The record indicates that the trial court rejected the plea agreement based on the\n\nnature of Howard’s offenses, the fact that Howard had a history of committing the same types of\n\noffenses, and that he had already been to prison for his past offenses. The trial court’s reasoning\n\nis sound and is not unreasonable. While it would have been prudent for the trial court to have\n\nimmediately responded when asked to set forth its reasoning for the rejection, we find no error\n\nresulted given the fact that the trial court eventually provided its reasoning on the record, and\n\nsuch reasoning was not an abuse of discretion.\n\n       {¶ 25}    Howard’s First Assignment of Error is overruled.\n\n\n\n       III. Did the Trial Court Err in Overruling Appellant’s Motion to Suppress?\n\n       {¶ 26}    Howard’s Second Assignment of Error states that:\n\n                The Trial Court Erred in Overruling the Motion to Suppress.\n\n       {¶ 27}    Under this assignment of error, Howard claims that police officers exceeded the\n\nscope of the search warrant issued for his mother’s residence at 6135 Sandbury Drive. Howard\n\nclaims that the scope of the warrant was exceeded because the vehicle in which the cocaine was\n\nfound, a Chrysler Sebring, was not listed on the warrant. Howard also argues that the search\n\f                                                                                           9\n\n\nwarrant did not apply to the detached garage in which the Chrysler Sebring was located.\n\n       {¶ 28}    We disagree with Howard’s contentions because the search warrant specifically\n\nauthorized officers to search the residence at 6135 Sandbury Drive and its “surrounding\n\ncurtilage.”\n\n       {¶ 29}    The term “curtilage” “ ‘includes all outbuildings used in connection with a\n\nresidence, such as garages, sheds, [and] barns ... connected with and in close vicinity of the\n\nresidence.’ ” (Emphasis sic.) United States v. Dunn, 480 U.S. 294, 308, 107 S.Ct. 1134, 94\n\nL.Ed.2d 326 (1987), quoting Luman v. Oklahoma, 629 P.2d 1275, 1276 (Okla.Crim.App.1981).\n\n       {¶ 30}    “ ‘[V]ehicles parked in a driveway or otherwise in immediate proximity to the\n\nhouse are part of the curtilage and properly searched when the search warrant specifies\n\n“curtilage.” ’ ” (Citation omitted.) State v. Simpson, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 19011, 2002 WL\n\n441488, *2 (Mar. 22, 2002), quoting State v. Amendola, 71 Ohio Misc.2d 30, 34, 654 N.E.2d 196\n\n(6th C.P. 1995). \" ‘ “[A]ll federal and state courts which have addressed * * * this issue have\n\ndetermined that it is constitutionally permissible to search automobiles found within the curtilage\n\nof a residence which is being searched pursuant to a valid warrant.” ’ \" (Citation omitted.) Id.\n\n       {¶ 31}    In this case, a large amount of cocaine was located in the trunk of a Chrysler\n\nSebring that was parked in the detached garage of 6135 Sandbury Drive. Because the detached\n\ngarage is an outbuilding used in connection with the residence, it is considered a part of the\n\nsurrounding curtilage. Furthermore, the warrant specifically mentioned the two-car detached\n\ngarage in its description of the residence. The Chrysler Sebring itself is also a part of the\n\nsurrounding curtilage because it was parked within immediate proximity of the residence.\n\nAccordingly, the scope of the search warrant was not exceeded because the evidence was\n\ndiscovered in the surrounding curtilage of 6135 Sandbury Drive, which the warrant specifically\n\f                                                                                           10\n\n\nauthorized police officers to search.\n\n       {¶ 32}      Howard’s Second Assignment of Error is overruled.\n\n\n\n                 IV.   Did the Trial Court Err in Overruling Appellant’s Motion\n\n                                        for Relief from Joinder?\n\n       {¶ 33}      Howard’s Third Assignment of Error states that:\n\n               The Trial Court Erred in Overruling the Motion for Relief from Joinder.\n\n       {¶ 34}      Under this assignment of error, Howard contends that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion when it failed to sever the joinder of Howard’s offenses. He argues that Counts One\n\nand Two of his indictment should not have been joined with the other remaining five counts,\n\nbecause the first two counts occurred in Greene County and the other five counts occurred in\n\nMontgomery County.          Howard also claims that joining the counts together was unduly\n\nprejudicial.\n\n       {¶ 35} “It is well-established that the law favors joinder because the avoidance of\n\nmultiple trials conserves time and expense and minimizes the potentially incongruous outcomes\n\nthat can result from successive trials before different juries.” State v.

This statute provides that joinder is permitted when the offenses were committed\n\n“as part of a course of criminal conduct.” R.C. 2901.12(H). “Course of criminal conduct”\n\nincludes offenses that are “in furtherance of the same purpose or objective.” R.C. 2901.12(H)(3).\n\n“[T]he offender may be tried for all of those offenses in any jurisdiction in which one of those\n\noffenses or any element of one of those offenses occurred.” R.C. 2901.12(H).\n\n        {¶ 38}    A defendant can move to sever joined offenses pursuant to Crim.R.14, which\n\nstates that, “If it appears that a defendant *** is prejudiced by a joinder of offenses * * * the court\n\nshall order an election or separate trial of counts, grant a severance of defendants or provide such\n\nother relief as justice requires.”\n\n        {¶ 39}    “The defendant claiming error in the trial court's refusal to sever multiple\n\ncharges has the burden of affirmatively showing that his rights were prejudiced.” (Citations\n\nomitted.)

Clark No. 2003-CA-62, 2004-Ohio-4517, ¶ 41.\n\f                                                                                          12\n\n\n       {¶ 40}    In this case, all of Howard’s offenses relate to his sales and possession of\n\ncocaine. The offenses are therefore part of a common scheme, plan, or course of criminal\n\nconduct. As such, they were properly joined pursuant to Crim.R. 8(A) and R.C. 2901.12(H).\n\nThey were also properly venued in Greene County, since two of the offenses occurred there. As\n\na result, Howard had the burden to show that he was prejudiced by the joinder and that the trial\n\ncourt abused its discretion when it failed to sever the offenses.\n\n       {¶ 41}    Howard first asserts that he was prejudiced because the jury was presented with\n\nevidence that he engaged in criminal activity across jurisdictional lines. According to Howard,\n\nthis is prejudicial because it gives the appearance of a greater or more elaborate criminal scheme.\n\n Howard does not cite any authority in support of this assertion. We find that his argument has\n\nno merit, because the multi-jurisdictional offenses were properly joined and venued in Greene\n\nCounty. The prosecution’s presentation of evidence showing that Howard committed offenses\n\nin Greene and Montgomery counties is an obvious result of the offenses being joined together.\n\nFurthermore, the offender did in fact commit crimes in both counties; therefore it was not\n\nimproper for the jury to be presented with that information.\n\n       {¶ 42}     Howard also asserts that he was prejudiced because he was prevented from\n\ngiving testimony. Howard claims that he wanted to testify against some counts at trial, but not\n\nothers, and that the joinder forced him to testify in all or none. A defendant seeking severance\n\nfor this reason “must produce sufficient information regarding the nature of the testimony he\n\nwishes to give in the one case, and his reasons for not wishing to testify in the other, so as to\n\nsatisfy the court that his claim of prejudice is genuine.” (Citations omitted.) State v. Roberts,\n\n62 Ohio St.2d 170, 176-177, 405 N.E.2d 247 (1980); Accord State v. Massey, 10th Dist. Franklin\n\nNos. 99AP-1355, 99AP-1356, 99AP-1357, 99AP-1358, 2000 WL 1742072, *3 (Nov. 28, 2000).\n\f                                                                                         13\n\n\n       {¶ 43}    In this case, Howard did not indicate which counts he wanted to testify against,\n\nand he also failed to provide any reasons for his unknown preference. The record is completely\n\ndevoid of any explanation or reason for his desire to testify against some counts, but not others.\n\nAccordingly, under Roberts, an affirmative showing of prejudice has not been made.\n\n       {¶ 44}    The trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling the motion for relief\n\nfrom joinder because Howard’s offenses were properly joined and Howard failed to demonstrate\n\nthat he was prejudiced as a result of the joinder.\n\n       {¶ 45}    Howard’s Third Assignment of Error is overruled.\n\n\n\n        V. Did the Trial Court Err in Overruling Appellant’s Motion to Continue?\n\n       {¶ 46}    For his Fourth Assignment of Error Howard states:\n\n                   The Trial Court Erred in Overruling the Motion to Continue.\n\n       {¶ 47}    Under this assignment of error, Howard contends that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in failing to grant a trial continuance.     Howard claims a trial continuance was\n\nnecessary because defense counsel was unable to prepare for trial due to: (1) the court’s late\n\nrulings on various pretrial motions; (2) never receiving copies of the audio and video recordings\n\nused by the State; (3) never receiving a legible prosecutor’s agreement with the confidential\n\ninformant; and (4) the inability to timely interview the confidential informant.\n\n       {¶ 48}    “An appellate court must not reverse denial of a continuance unless an abuse of\n\ndiscretion has been demonstrated.” (Citations omitted.) State v. Parks, 69 Ohio App.3d 150, 154,\n\n590 N.E.2d 300 (2d Dist. 1990). According to Parks:\n\n                “In evaluating a motion for a continuance, a court should note, inter\n\n       alia : the length of the delay requested; whether other continuances have been\n\f                                                                                            14\n\n\n       requested and received; the inconvenience to litigants, witnesses, opposing\n\n       counsel and the court; whether the requested delay is for legitimate reasons or\n\n       whether it is dilatory, purposeful, or contrived; whether the defendant\n\n       contributed to the circumstance which gives rise to the request for a\n\n       continuance; and other relevant factors, depending on the unique facts of each\n\n       case.” (Citations omitted.) Id.\n\n       {¶ 49} We have reviewed Howard’s arguments under this assignment of error, and we\n\nwill address each of them separately.\n\n\n\n                                     A. Late Pretrial Motions\n\n       {¶ 50}     The trial court’s rulings on pretrial motions were issued on Friday, April 20,\n\n2012, three days before trial. This gave counsel a reasonable amount of time to prepare for trial.\n\n On the day of trial, defense counsel claimed that he was prevented from adequately preparing for\n\ntrial because he did not receive notice of the court’s rulings until late in the evening on Sunday,\n\nApril 22nd.     Defense counsel did not state why he received late notice.         The record also\n\nindicates that defense counsel was not prevented from preparing for trial in anticipation of the\n\ncourt’s rulings. Therefore, defense counsel’s own failure to prepare in anticipation of the court’s\n\nrulings partially fueled his desire for a trial continuance in this matter. As a result, we find that\n\nthe timing of the pretrial motions did not prevent defense counsel from preparing for trial, and\n\ndid not warrant a continuance.\n\n\n\n                           B. Copies of Audio and Video Recordings\n\n       {¶ 51} On October 27, 2011, the State filed a certification of non-disclosure, indicating\n\f                                                                                          15\n\n\nthat it would not make copies of the audio and video recording evidence because the recordings\n\ndisclosed the identity of the confidential informant, and disclosure would put the confidential\n\ninformant’s safety in danger. The certification also stated that defense counsel was free to view\n\nand inspect the recordings upon coordination with A.C.E. Protecting the safety of a witness is a\n\npermissible reason for non-disclosure of materials under Crim.R.16(D)(1). Defense counsel\n\nstated on the record that he was able to review the recordings prior to trial. Accordingly, we find\n\nthat the failure to obtain copies of the audio and video recordings did not prevent defense counsel\n\nfrom preparing for trial, and did not warrant a continuance.\n\n\n\n                                C. Illegible Prosecutor’s Agreement\n\n       {¶ 52}       The State faxed the prosecutor’s agreement with the confidential informant to\n\ndefense counsel three days before trial. The record indicates that the fax was partially illegible,\n\nbut defense counsel never advised the State of this until the day of trial. The record also\n\nindicates that the illegible portion of the document only contained the confidential informant’s\n\ncriminal history.     However, defense counsel was provided with the missing information before\n\nthe trial began, and was able to use it during his cross-examination of the confidential informant.\n\nAccordingly, we find that the partially illegible prosecutor’s agreement did not prevent defense\n\ncounsel from preparing for trial, and did not warrant a continuance.\n\n\n\n                           D. Untimely Confidential Informant Interview\n\n       {¶ 53}       Howard’s trial counsel claims he was unable to adequately prepare for trial\n\nbecause his interview with the confidential informant was untimely. The record indicates that\n\ndefense counsel interviewed the confidential informant four days before trial on April 19, 2012.\n\f                                                                                            16\n\n\nWe find that this is an adequate amount of time to prepare his cross-examination for trial.\n\n       {¶ 54}    After reviewing the record, we find that Howard’s reasons for requesting a trial\n\ncontinuance were insufficient to warrant a continuance, and that defense counsel partially\n\ncontributed to the circumstances giving rise to the need for a continuance. Accordingly, the trial\n\ncourt’s decision overruling the motion for trial continuance was not an abuse of discretion.\n\n\n\n             VI. Did the Trial Court Deny Appellant’s Right to a Fair Trial and\n\n                            Due Process Due to Cumulative Error?\n\n       {¶ 55}    For his Fifth Assignment of Error, Howard states:\n\n                The Cumulative Nature of the Trial Court’s Error Denied Appellant the\n\n       Right to a Fair Trial and Due Process.\n\n       {¶ 56}    Under this assignment of error, Howard advances a claim of cumulative error.\n\nHe contends that the effect of the errors alleged in the first four assignments of error cumulatively\n\ndeprived him of a fair trial and due process.\n\n       {¶ 57}    “It is true that separately harmless errors may violate a defendant's right to a fair\n\ntrial when the errors are considered together. To find cumulative error present, we first must find\n\nmultiple errors committed at trial. We then must find a reasonable probability that the outcome\n\nbelow would have been different but for the combination of separately harmless errors.”\n\n(Citations omitted.) State v. Carr, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 22603, 2009-Ohio-1942, ¶ 74.\n\n       {¶ 58} We have reviewed Howard’s other arguments and found no errors. Therefore, we\n\nfind no cumulative error. Accordingly Howard’s Fifth Assignment of Error is overruled.\n\n\n\n                                        VII. Conclusion\n\f                                                                                           17\n\n\n        {¶ 59} Having overruled all of Christopher T. Howard’s assignments of error, we hereby\n\naffirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\n                                                   .............\n\n\nDONOVAN and FROELICH, JJ., concurring in judgment and opinion and writing separately:\n\n        {¶ 60} We concur with the majority that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\n\ndenying a motion for a continuance; specifically, we agree that the record does not demonstrate\n\nthat the Appellant was prejudiced by the State’s not delivering a hard copy of a video prior to the\n\nday of trial.\n\n        {¶ 61} We write separately to express an opinion that Crim.R. 16(D) requires more than\n\na generalized certification that disclosure of certain information “jeopardizes both the life of the\n\nconfidential informant and puts sensitive investigative techniques at risk.” (State’s Criminal\n\nRule 16 Certification of Non-Disclosure, filed October 27, 2011).\n\n        {¶ 62} Crim.R. 16(D) requires that the prosecuting attorney certify to the court that the\n\nprosecutor is not disclosing material or portions of material otherwise subject to disclosure\n\nbecause the prosecutor has “reasonable, articulable grounds to believe that disclosure will\n\ncompromise the safety of a witness, victim, or third party, or subject them to intimidation or\n\ncoercion,” Crim.R. 16(D)(1), or that “[d]isclosure will compromise an ongoing criminal\n\ninvestigation or a confidential law enforcement technique or investigation * * *,” Crim.R.\n\n16(D)(3). “Reasonable, articulable grounds may include, but are not limited to, the nature of the\n\ncase, the specific course of conduct of one or more parties, threats or prior instances of witness\n\ntampering or intimidation, whether or not those instances resulted in criminal charges, whether\n\nthe defendant is pro se, and any other relevant information.” Crim.R. 16(D).\n\f                                                                                            18\n\n\n       {¶ 63} In October, the prosecutor certified non-disclosure of “audio and video\n\nsurveillance recordings.” The certification stated that the identity of “one or more confidential\n\ninformants is revealed in these recordings.” It further stated:\n\n       [I]n addition, specific investigative techniques utilized by the drug task force are\n\n       revealed on these videos. * * * [T]o produce copies and provide these copies to\n\n       the defendant jeopardizes both the life of the confidential informants and puts\n\n       sensitive investigative techniques at risk. To provide the personal identifying\n\n       information of a confidential informant when that informant is a potential witness\n\n       against a defendant puts that informant’s life at risk. This is especially true in this\n\n       case where the Defendant is facing significant charges and the Defendant is out on\n\n       bond, and no trial date has been set. The threat posed to the informant comes not\n\n       necessarily from the Defendant himself, but from his associates in his drug\n\n       enterprise, and from the internet, where videos of confidential informants and\n\n       undercover police officers have become all too frequently uploaded and\n\n       disseminated to the general public.\n\n       {¶ 64}    We understand that the certification can be – and often must be – nonspecific\n\nand that the defense can question it pursuant to a Crim.R. 16(F) motion; the trial court then\n\nreviews the prosecutor’s decision for abuse of discretion. See, e.g., State v. Gillard, 40 Ohio\n\nSt.3d 226, 533 N.E.2d 272 (1988), reversed on other grounds; State v. McGuire, 80 Ohio St.3d\n\n390, 685 N.E.2d 1112 (1997).\n\n       {¶ 65} However, to the extent possible, the certification must be more than a request for\n\nquasi-judicial notice that undercover investigations of drug offenses involve serious risks to those\n\ninvolved. “Articulable” is the key word, as it is, analogously, in Terry stop and frisk cases.\n\f                                    19\n\n\n\n\n                       ..........\n\n\nCopies mailed to:\n\nElizabeth Ellis\nJay A.

Howard, appeals from his criminal\n\f                                                                                          2\n\n\nconviction and sentence on four counts of Trafficking in Cocaine, two counts of Possession, and\n\none count of Having Weapons While Under Disability. Howard’s conviction also included eight\n\nforfeiture specifications.\n\n       {¶ 2}      Howard contends that the trial court abused its discretion in rejecting his plea\n\nagreement with the Appellee, the State of Ohio, because it failed to state its reasons for the\n\nrejection on the record. Additionally, Howard argues that the trial court erred in overruling his\n\nmotion to suppress evidence on grounds that police officers exceeded the scope of a search\n\nwarrant. Howard also contends that the trial court abused its discretion in overruling his motion\n\nfor relief from joinder, claiming that joinder of his offenses was unduly prejudicial. Howard\n\nfurther argues that the trial court abused its discretion in overruling his motion for a trial\n\ncontinuance. Finally, Howard contends that the cumulative nature of the trial court’s alleged\n\nerrors denied him the right to a fair trial and due process.\n\n       {¶ 3}      We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting\n\nHoward’s plea agreement. The trial court stated its reasons for the rejection on the record during\n\nHoward’s sentencing hearing, and the trial court’s reasoning was sound.\n\n       {¶ 4}      We next conclude that the trial court did not err in overruling Howard’s motion\n\nto suppress evidence that was obtained by a search warrant. The language in the search warrant\n\nspecifically authorized police officers to search the area in which the evidence was found.\n\nTherefore, the search did not exceed the scope of the warrant.\n\n       {¶ 5}      We also conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling\n\nHoward’s motion for relief from joinder. Howard’s offenses were properly joined pursuant to\n\nCrim.R. 8(A) and R.C. 2901.12(H), and Howard failed to demonstrate that he was unduly\n\nprejudiced as a result of the joinder.\n\f                                                                                        3\n\n\n       {¶ 6}     As a further matter, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling\n\nHoward’s motion for a trial continuance. Howard’s reasons for requesting a continuance were\n\ninsufficient to warrant a continuance and defense counsel’s actions partially contributed to the\n\nneed for a continuance.\n\n       {¶ 7}     Finally, upon finding that the trial court committed no error, we conclude that\n\nthere was no cumulative error which denied Howard’s right to a fair trial and due process.\n\nAccordingly, the judgment of the trial court will be Affirmed.\n\n\n\n                             I. Facts and Course of Proceedings\n\n       {¶ 8}     This case arises from an operation of the Greene County Agencies for Combined\n\nEnforcement Task Force (A.C.E.). A.C.E. is a group of officers from individual police agencies\n\nwithin Greene County who investigate drug trafficking. A.C.E. learned through a confidential\n\ninformant that the Appellant, Christopher T. Howard, was trafficking cocaine. On various\n\noccasions, A.C.E. instructed the confidential informant to call Howard in an attempt to purchase\n\ncocaine.\n\n       {¶ 9}     On January 6, 2011, the confidential informant set up a meeting with Howard at\n\nthe K-Mart parking lot on Indian Ripple Road in the city of Beavercreek, Greene County, Ohio.\n\nAt the meeting, the confidential informant was wired, and he purchased 13.15 grams of cocaine\n\nfrom Howard.\n\n       {¶ 10}    On January 27, 2011, the confidential informant set up another meeting with\n\nHoward at Cruxten Drive in the city of Huber Heights, Montgomery County, Ohio. At the\n\nmeeting, the confidential informant was wired and he purchased 11.94 grams of cocaine from\n\nHoward.\n\f                                                                                           4\n\n\n       {¶ 11}        On March 18, 2011 and March 23, 2011, the confidential informant called\n\nHoward in an attempt to buy one-half ounce (14.25 grams) of cocaine. The telephone calls were\n\nrecorded, and the recordings captured Howard and the confidential informant discussing the\n\npurchase price of cocaine. No meeting or sale resulted from these communications.\n\n       {¶ 12}        Howard drove a white Cadillac Escalade to each meeting with the confidential\n\ninformant.   The Escalade was registered in the name of Howard’s mother, Doris Howard.\n\nHoward’s mother resided at 6135 Sandbury Drive, Huber Heights, Ohio. Howard’s mother\n\ntestified that Howard does not live with her, but that he is always welcome in her home.\n\nHoward receives his mail at his mother’s residence, and his son, and the mother of his son, both\n\nlive at the residence as well.\n\n       {¶ 13}        On March 24, 2011, Detective Richard Miller of A.C.E. obtained a search\n\nwarrant stating that he had probable cause to believe that there was cocaine and other illegal\n\nproperty concealed at 6135 Sandbury Drive. Specifically, the warrant authorized a search:\n\n                a.        upon the person(s) of:\n\n                          1.

During the search, the officers discovered 269.63 grams of\n\ncocaine in the trunk of a white Chrysler Sebring. The Sebring was located in the residence’s\n\ntwo-car detached garage. The officers also found various firearms inside the residence. At the\n\ntime, Howard was under a weapons disability due to a prior felony offense for possession of\n\ndrugs.\n\n         {¶ 15}   As a result of A.C.E.’s investigation and search, Howard was indicted in Greene\n\nCounty for three counts of Trafficking in Cocaine in an amount equal to or exceeding ten grams,\n\nbut less than 20 grams, one count of Trafficking in Cocaine in the vicinity of a school in an\n\namount equal to or exceeding 100 grams, but less than 500 grams, two counts of Possession of\n\nCocaine in an amount equal to or exceeding five grams, but less than 25 grams, and one count of\n\nHaving Weapons While Under Disability. His indictment also included a firearm specification\n\nand eight forfeiture specifications. The firearm specification and the specification for trafficking\n\nin the vicinity of a school were later dismissed.\n\n         {¶ 16}   On October 5, 2011, Howard filed a motion to suppress the evidence obtained\n\npursuant to the search warrant. The trial court overruled the motion on April 20, 2012. On\n\nFebruary 29, 2012, Howard filed a motion for relief from prejudicial joinder of offenses. The\n\ntrial court overruled the motion on April 20, 2012.\n\n         {¶ 17}   Prior to trial, Howard and the State negotiated a plea bargain in which Howard\n\nagreed to plead guilty to all counts in exchange for serving a stipulated six-year prison term. A\n\f                                                                                                6\n\n\nfew days before trial, both counsel advised the trial court of the plea bargain, but the trial court\n\nrefused to accept it.\n\n        {¶ 18}    On the day of trial, April 23, 2012, Howard filed a motion for a trial\n\ncontinuance, which the trial court overruled. The trial court also mentioned the plea bargain,\n\nand confirmed on the record that it was rejected. Counsel for the State requested the trial court\n\nto state its reasons for the rejection, but the court failed to give its reasons at that time. Trial\n\nwent forward, and the jury found Howard guilty on all charges. At Howard’s sentencing hearing\n\non May 17, 2012, the trial court stated its reasons for rejecting the plea agreement on the record,\n\nand sentenced Howard to 11 years in prison. Howard subsequently filed an appeal.\n\n\n\n             II. Did the Trial Court Err When it Rejected the Plea Agreement?\n\n        {¶ 19}    Howard’s First Assignment of Error states that:\n\n              The Trial Court Erred in Rejecting a Valid Plea Agreement.\n\n        {¶ 20}    Under this assignment of error, Howard argues that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion when it rejected the parties’ plea agreement on grounds that it failed to give a reason\n\nfor the rejection on the record. The State concedes error in this regard, and claims that the\n\nrecord is insufficient to support the rejection. Based on the record, we disagree.\n\n        {¶ 21}    It is well settled that “[t]he decision to accept or reject a plea bargain rests solely\n\nwithin the discretion of the trial court.” (Citation omitted.)

While the trial court did not initially\n\ncomply with the State’s request, it did eventually state its reasons during Howard’s sentencing\n\nhearing. The trial court stated:\n\n                  You may have gathered from the fact that the Court refused this original\n\n         plea bargain that I felt that six years was not an adequate sentence for someone\n\n         who has alleged to have committed the offenses that [Howard] did, and now a jury\n\f                                                                                                8\n\n\n       has spoken and said you did, indeed commit those offenses.\n\n                The Court, probably more than any other feature, notices the fact that for\n\n       most of your adult life you have been convicted of these same type of offenses,\n\n       possession or trafficking in drugs, both in the State and the Federal System, and a\n\n       substantial portion of your adult life – I’ll call it a substantial portion, you have\n\n       been in prison for these offenses. Transcript Vol. III, p. 589, ln. 20-25, p. 590, ln.\n\n       1-7.\n\n       {¶ 24}    The record indicates that the trial court rejected the plea agreement based on the\n\nnature of Howard’s offenses, the fact that Howard had a history of committing the same types of\n\noffenses, and that he had already been to prison for his past offenses. The trial court’s reasoning\n\nis sound and is not unreasonable. While it would have been prudent for the trial court to have\n\nimmediately responded when asked to set forth its reasoning for the rejection, we find no error\n\nresulted given the fact that the trial court eventually provided its reasoning on the record, and\n\nsuch reasoning was not an abuse of discretion.\n\n       {¶ 25}    Howard’s First Assignment of Error is overruled.\n\n\n\n       III. Did the Trial Court Err in Overruling Appellant’s Motion to Suppress?\n\n       {¶ 26}    Howard’s Second Assignment of Error states that:\n\n                The Trial Court Erred in Overruling the Motion to Suppress.\n\n       {¶ 27}    Under this assignment of error, Howard claims that police officers exceeded the\n\nscope of the search warrant issued for his mother’s residence at 6135 Sandbury Drive. Howard\n\nclaims that the scope of the warrant was exceeded because the vehicle in which the cocaine was\n\nfound, a Chrysler Sebring, was not listed on the warrant. Howard also argues that the search\n\f                                                                                           9\n\n\nwarrant did not apply to the detached garage in which the Chrysler Sebring was located.\n\n       {¶ 28}    We disagree with Howard’s contentions because the search warrant specifically\n\nauthorized officers to search the residence at 6135 Sandbury Drive and its “surrounding\n\ncurtilage.”\n\n       {¶ 29}    The term “curtilage” “ ‘includes all outbuildings used in connection with a\n\nresidence, such as garages, sheds, [and] barns ... connected with and in close vicinity of the\n\nresidence.’ ” (Emphasis sic.)

Id.\n\n       {¶ 31}    In this case, a large amount of cocaine was located in the trunk of a Chrysler\n\nSebring that was parked in the detached garage of 6135 Sandbury Drive. Because the detached\n\ngarage is an outbuilding used in connection with the residence, it is considered a part of the\n\nsurrounding curtilage. Furthermore, the warrant specifically mentioned the two-car detached\n\ngarage in its description of the residence. The Chrysler Sebring itself is also a part of the\n\nsurrounding curtilage because it was parked within immediate proximity of the residence.\n\nAccordingly, the scope of the search warrant was not exceeded because the evidence was\n\ndiscovered in the surrounding curtilage of 6135 Sandbury Drive, which the warrant specifically\n\f                                                                                           10\n\n\nauthorized police officers to search.\n\n       {¶ 32}      Howard’s Second Assignment of Error is overruled.\n\n\n\n                 IV.

He argues that Counts One\n\nand Two of his indictment should not have been joined with the other remaining five counts,\n\nbecause the first two counts occurred in Greene County and the other five counts occurred in\n\nMontgomery County.          Howard also claims that joining the counts together was unduly\n\nprejudicial.\n\n       {¶ 35} “It is well-established that the law favors joinder because the avoidance of\n\nmultiple trials conserves time and expense and minimizes the potentially incongruous outcomes\n\nthat can result from successive trials before different juries.” State v.

As such, they were properly joined pursuant to Crim.R. 8(A) and R.C. 2901.12(H).\n\nThey were also properly venued in Greene County, since two of the offenses occurred there.

According to Howard,\n\nthis is prejudicial because it gives the appearance of a greater or more elaborate criminal scheme.\n\n Howard does not cite any authority in support of this assertion. We find that his argument has\n\nno merit, because the multi-jurisdictional offenses were properly joined and venued in Greene\n\nCounty. The prosecution’s presentation of evidence showing that Howard committed offenses\n\nin Greene and Montgomery counties is an obvious result of the offenses being joined together.\n\nFurthermore, the offender did in fact commit crimes in both counties; therefore it was not\n\nimproper for the jury to be presented with that information.\n\n       {¶ 42}     Howard also asserts that he was prejudiced because he was prevented from\n\ngiving testimony. Howard claims that he wanted to testify against some counts at trial, but not\n\nothers, and that the joinder forced him to testify in all or none. A defendant seeking severance\n\nfor this reason “must produce sufficient information regarding the nature of the testimony he\n\nwishes to give in the one case, and his reasons for not wishing to testify in the other, so as to\n\nsatisfy the court that his claim of prejudice is genuine.” (Citations omitted.)

The record is completely\n\ndevoid of any explanation or reason for his desire to testify against some counts, but not others.\n\nAccordingly, under Roberts, an affirmative showing of prejudice has not been made.\n\n       {¶ 44}    The trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling the motion for relief\n\nfrom joinder because Howard’s offenses were properly joined and Howard failed to demonstrate\n\nthat he was prejudiced as a result of the joinder.\n\n       {¶ 45}    Howard’s Third Assignment of Error is overruled.\n\n\n\n        V. Did the Trial Court Err in Overruling Appellant’s Motion to Continue?\n\n       {¶ 46}    For his Fourth Assignment of Error Howard states:\n\n                   The Trial Court Erred in Overruling the Motion to Continue.\n\n       {¶ 47}    Under this assignment of error, Howard contends that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in failing to grant a trial continuance.     Howard claims a trial continuance was\n\nnecessary because defense counsel was unable to prepare for trial due to: (1) the court’s late\n\nrulings on various pretrial motions; (2) never receiving copies of the audio and video recordings\n\nused by the State; (3) never receiving a legible prosecutor’s agreement with the confidential\n\ninformant; and (4) the inability to timely interview the confidential informant.\n\n       {¶ 48}    “An appellate court must not reverse denial of a continuance unless an abuse of\n\ndiscretion has been demonstrated.” (Citations omitted.)

Id.\n\n       {¶ 49} We have reviewed Howard’s arguments under this assignment of error, and we\n\nwill address each of them separately.\n\n\n\n                                     A. Late Pretrial Motions\n\n       {¶ 50}     The trial court’s rulings on pretrial motions were issued on Friday, April 20,\n\n2012, three days before trial. This gave counsel a reasonable amount of time to prepare for trial.\n\n On the day of trial, defense counsel claimed that he was prevented from adequately preparing for\n\ntrial because he did not receive notice of the court’s rulings until late in the evening on Sunday,\n\nApril 22nd.     Defense counsel did not state why he received late notice.         The record also\n\nindicates that defense counsel was not prevented from preparing for trial in anticipation of the\n\ncourt’s rulings. Therefore, defense counsel’s own failure to prepare in anticipation of the court’s\n\nrulings partially fueled his desire for a trial continuance in this matter. As a result, we find that\n\nthe timing of the pretrial motions did not prevent defense counsel from preparing for trial, and\n\ndid not warrant a continuance.\n\n\n\n                           B. Copies of Audio and Video Recordings\n\n       {¶ 51} On October 27, 2011, the State filed a certification of non-disclosure, indicating\n\f                                                                                          15\n\n\nthat it would not make copies of the audio and video recording evidence because the recordings\n\ndisclosed the identity of the confidential informant, and disclosure would put the confidential\n\ninformant’s safety in danger. The certification also stated that defense counsel was free to view\n\nand inspect the recordings upon coordination with A.C.E. Protecting the safety of a witness is a\n\npermissible reason for non-disclosure of materials under Crim.R.16(D)(1). Defense counsel\n\nstated on the record that he was able to review the recordings prior to trial. Accordingly, we find\n\nthat the failure to obtain copies of the audio and video recordings did not prevent defense counsel\n\nfrom preparing for trial, and did not warrant a continuance.\n\n\n\n                                C. Illegible Prosecutor’s Agreement\n\n       {¶ 52}       The State faxed the prosecutor’s agreement with the confidential informant to\n\ndefense counsel three days before trial. The record indicates that the fax was partially illegible,\n\nbut defense counsel never advised the State of this until the day of trial. The record also\n\nindicates that the illegible portion of the document only contained the confidential informant’s\n\ncriminal history.     However, defense counsel was provided with the missing information before\n\nthe trial began, and was able to use it during his cross-examination of the confidential informant.\n\nAccordingly, we find that the partially illegible prosecutor’s agreement did not prevent defense\n\ncounsel from preparing for trial, and did not warrant a continuance.\n\n\n\n                           D. Untimely Confidential Informant Interview\n\n       {¶ 53}       Howard’s trial counsel claims he was unable to adequately prepare for trial\n\nbecause his interview with the confidential informant was untimely. The record indicates that\n\ndefense counsel interviewed the confidential informant four days before trial on April 19, 2012.\n\f                                                                                            16\n\n\nWe find that this is an adequate amount of time to prepare his cross-examination for trial.\n\n       {¶ 54}    After reviewing the record, we find that Howard’s reasons for requesting a trial\n\ncontinuance were insufficient to warrant a continuance, and that defense counsel partially\n\ncontributed to the circumstances giving rise to the need for a continuance. Accordingly, the trial\n\ncourt’s decision overruling the motion for trial continuance was not an abuse of discretion.\n\n\n\n             VI. Did the Trial Court Deny Appellant’s Right to a Fair Trial and\n\n                            Due Process Due to Cumulative Error?\n\n       {¶ 55}    For his Fifth Assignment of Error, Howard states:\n\n                The Cumulative Nature of the Trial Court’s Error Denied Appellant the\n\n       Right to a Fair Trial and Due Process.\n\n       {¶ 56}    Under this assignment of error, Howard advances a claim of cumulative error.\n\nHe contends that the effect of the errors alleged in the first four assignments of error cumulatively\n\ndeprived him of a fair trial and due process.\n\n       {¶ 57}    “It is true that separately harmless errors may violate a defendant's right to a fair\n\ntrial when the errors are considered together. To find cumulative error present, we first must find\n\nmultiple errors committed at trial. We then must find a reasonable probability that the outcome\n\nbelow would have been different but for the combination of separately harmless errors.”\n\n(Citations omitted.) State v. Carr, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 22603, 2009-Ohio-1942, ¶ 74.\n\n       {¶ 58} We have reviewed Howard’s other arguments and found no errors. Therefore, we\n\nfind no cumulative error. Accordingly Howard’s Fifth Assignment of Error is overruled.\n\n\n\n                                        VII. Conclusion\n\f                                                                                           17\n\n\n        {¶ 59} Having overruled all of Christopher T. Howard’s assignments of error, we hereby\n\naffirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\n                                                   .............\n\n\nDONOVAN and FROELICH, JJ., concurring in judgment and opinion and writing separately:\n\n        {¶ 60} We concur with the majority that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\n\ndenying a motion for a continuance; specifically, we agree that the record does not demonstrate\n\nthat the Appellant was prejudiced by the State’s not delivering a hard copy of a video prior to the\n\nday of trial.\n\n        {¶ 61} We write separately to express an opinion that Crim.R. 16(D) requires more than\n\na generalized certification that disclosure of certain information “jeopardizes both the life of the\n\nconfidential informant and puts sensitive investigative techniques at risk.” (State’s Criminal\n\nRule 16 Certification of Non-Disclosure, filed October 27, 2011).\n\n        {¶ 62} Crim.R. 16(D) requires that the prosecuting attorney certify to the court that the\n\nprosecutor is not disclosing material or portions of material otherwise subject to disclosure\n\nbecause the prosecutor has “reasonable, articulable grounds to believe that disclosure will\n\ncompromise the safety of a witness, victim, or third party, or subject them to intimidation or\n\ncoercion,” Crim.R. 16(D)(1), or that “[d]isclosure will compromise an ongoing criminal\n\ninvestigation or a confidential law enforcement technique or investigation * * *,” Crim.R.\n\n16(D)(3). “Reasonable, articulable grounds may include, but are not limited to, the nature of the\n\ncase, the specific course of conduct of one or more parties, threats or prior instances of witness\n\ntampering or intimidation, whether or not those instances resulted in criminal charges, whether\n\nthe defendant is pro se, and any other relevant information.” Crim.R. 16(D).\n\f                                                                                            18\n\n\n       {¶ 63} In October, the prosecutor certified non-disclosure of “audio and video\n\nsurveillance recordings.” The certification stated that the identity of “one or more confidential\n\ninformants is revealed in these recordings.” It further stated:\n\n       [I]n addition, specific investigative techniques utilized by the drug task force are\n\n       revealed on these videos. * * * [T]o produce copies and provide these copies to\n\n       the defendant jeopardizes both the life of the confidential informants and puts\n\n       sensitive investigative techniques at risk. To provide the personal identifying\n\n       information of a confidential informant when that informant is a potential witness\n\n       against a defendant puts that informant’s life at risk. This is especially true in this\n\n       case where the Defendant is facing significant charges and the Defendant is out on\n\n       bond, and no trial date has been set. The threat posed to the informant comes not\n\n       necessarily from the Defendant himself, but from his associates in his drug\n\n       enterprise, and from the internet, where videos of confidential informants and\n\n       undercover police officers have become all too frequently uploaded and\n\n       disseminated to the general public.\n\n       {¶ 64}    We understand that the certification can be – and often must be – nonspecific\n\nand that the defense can question it pursuant to a Crim.R. 16(F) motion; the trial court then\n\nreviews the prosecutor’s decision for abuse of discretion.
