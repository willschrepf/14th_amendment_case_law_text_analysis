Rowley, 458 U.S. 176 (1982),\nand concluded that the District provided a free appropriate\npublic education. The district court concluded that Congress\nsuperseded Rowley in the 1997 Individuals with Disabilities\nEducation Act amendment and held that K.L. was denied a\nfree appropriate public education. The District appeals.\n\n   The district court exercised federal question jurisdiction\nover the instant case under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. We have appel-\nlate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We hold that Rowley\ncontinues to set the free appropriate public education stan-\ndard. We vacate the district court’s orders except to the extent\nthat we reverse the district court’s conclusion that the District\ncommitted procedural violations of the Individuals with Dis-\nabilities Education Act that resulted in the denial of a free\nappropriate public education. We remand to the district court\nto review the ALJ’s determination that the District provided\nK.L. with educational benefit as required by Rowley.\n  1\n   In the interest of preserving the family’s privacy because K.L. was a\nminor at all relevant times, we identify Plaintiffs as “K.L.,” “Parents,”\n“Mother” and “Father.”\n\f             J. L. v. MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT             10457\n                                  I\n\n   K.L. is a student of average intelligence that the District\ndiagnosed with learning disabilities in first grade.2 For second\nand third grades, the District educated K.L. in several general\neducation classes upon determining that she would benefit\nfrom an education alongside her typically-developing peers\nfor social and academic purposes. To “level the playing field”\nin K.L.’s mainstreamed general education classes, the District\nprovided K.L. with accommodations. The District also pro-\nvided K.L. with specially designed instruction (i.e., “special\neducation”) in reading and writing in a “resource room” for\nspecial students. For fourth and fifth grades, Parents paid for\nK.L. to attend a private school serving children with reading\nand writing difficulties.\n\n   K.L. returned to the District for her sixth grade education\nat Islander Middle School. The District reevaluated K.L. and\ndetermined that she was still eligible for special education.\nK.L.’s intelligence quotient (“IQ”) revealed that she was in\nthe average range at the low end. In accordance with K.L.’s\nindividualized educational program, the District educated\nK.L. with specially designed instruction in reading, writing\nand mathematics. The District provided K.L. with accommo-\ndations in her general education classes including peers to\nhelp her read and take notes, use of spelling software, modi-\nfied instructions, alternate exam methods, reduced assign-\nments and extra time for assignments. K.L. ended her sixth\ngrade year with an “A-” in special education reading, an\n“A-” in special education language arts, a “B+” in special\neducation mathematics, an “A” in special education structured\nstudy, an “A-” in general education science, a “pass” in gen-\neral education art and a “pass” in general education Spanish.\n  2\n  This factual background reflects our “particular deference” to the\nALJ’s “thorough and careful” administrative findings. See JG v. Douglas\nCounty Sch. Dist., 552 F.3d 786, 793 (9th Cir. 2008).\n\f10458       J. L. v. MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT\n   In seventh grade, K.L. continued with largely the same\nindividualized educational program that she followed in sixth\ngrade after her individualized educational program team con-\ncluded that the program was effective. At the end of seventh\ngrade, K.L. received an “A-” in special education language\narts (i.e., reading and writing), an “A” in special education\nmathematics, an “A-” in special education structured study, a\n“B+” in general education biology and an “A” in general edu-\ncation art.\n\n   In eighth grade, the District modified K.L.’s individualized\neducational program and provided 750 minutes per week of\nspecially designed instruction in reading, writing, mathemat-\nics and study skills. K.L.’s accommodations basically stayed\nthe same. Halfway through eighth grade, in January 2003,\nMother contacted the District regarding K.L.’s frustrations\nwith her language arts class. K.L. considered her language\narts class “boring,” “stupid” and “too hard.” Specifically, K.L.\ndid not like being singled out to give an answer in front of her\nclassmates. In response, K.L.’s language arts teacher changed\nher teaching style, thereby galvanizing K.L. to increase her\nclassroom participation and self-confidence.\n\n   K.L. took a standardized test of basic skills and scored in\nthe second percentile of eighth graders. Although K.L. made\nprogress on all of her eighth grade individualized educational\nprogram objectives, she failed to meet all writing objectives,\ntwo reading objectives, one mathematics objective and one\nstudy skills objective. At the end of eighth grade, K.L.\nreceived a “B” in special education language arts, a “B+” in\nspecial education mathematics, an “A” in special education\nstructured study, an “A” in general education science, an “A”\nin general education social studies and a “pass” as a teacher’s\nassistant.\n\n  The District reevaluated K.L. after eighth grade in June\n2003. K.L.’s IQ showed improvement in mathematics and\nregression in numerical operations. One of K.L.’s teachers\n\f            J. L. v. MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT        10459\nobserved that K.L. performed much better in class than her\nstandardized test results showed. This was due to a combina-\ntion of K.L.’s sporadic lack of motivation and propensity to\nget frustrated on tests and simply give up. K.L’s individual-\nized educational program team met shortly thereafter to dis-\ncuss the District’s reevaluation. A few days later, K.L.’s\nindividualized educational program team met and developed\na ninth grade individualized educational program with lofty\nobjectives. Based on K.L.’s great progress in eighth grade\nmathematics, K.L. was placed in a ninth grade algebra class\nwith a difficulty level between special education mathematics\nand general education algebra.\n\n   During first semester of ninth grade at Mercer Island High\nSchool, not only did K.L. earn good grades, such as an “A-”\nin algebra, but she also participated in athletics and enjoyed\nan active (and sometimes distractive) social life. Unfortu-\nnately, in March 2004, K.L. missed three weeks of school due\nto an illness. One of K.L.’s teachers believed that K.L. “was\nnot the same student” after she returned and that she was less\nmotivated. K.L. turned in only half of her algebra homework\nand her quiz and test grades decreased as a result. At K.L.’s\nrequest, her individualized educational program team returned\nher to special education mathematics and provided her with\nanother resource room period. Parents hired a private educa-\ntional consultant and began researching private schools for\nK.L.\n\n   At the end of ninth grade, K.L. received a “B-” in special\neducation English foundations, an “A-” in special education\nmathematics, a “C+” in general education history, a “B” in\ngeneral education chemistry and an “A” as a teacher’s assis-\ntant. K.L.’s grade point average was a 3.49, which was higher\nthan both the median and mean grade point average for ninth\ngraders in the District. By the end of ninth grade, K.L. met all\nof her mathematics and study skills individualized educational\nprogram objectives, however, she did not meet two of her\nreading objectives and any of her writing objectives. Never-\n\f10460          J. L. v. MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT\ntheless, K.L.’s individualized educational program team\nthought that K.L. “had a very successful year, her grades have\nbeen high and though at times she is frustrated or afraid, she\nhas managed to tackle the projects with support.” Unbe-\nknownst to anyone at the District, Mother completed much of\nK.L.’s ninth grade homework, sometimes even in K.L.’s\nabsence.\n\n   Shortly after ninth grade concluded, in June 2004, the Dis-\ntrict held an individualized educational program meeting and\npresented a proposed tenth grade individualized educational\nprogram to Parents. The proposed program provided 972 min-\nutes per week of specially designed instruction in reading,\nwriting, mathematics, study skills and transitions. K.L.’s read-\ning goal was to increase reading decoding and comprehension\nskills on grade-level materials. K.L.’s written language goal\nwas to increase written expression skills in a more indepen-\ndent manner. The individualized educational program pro-\nvided most of the same accommodations as K.L.’s ninth grade\nindividualized educational program with the addition of\naccess to books on tape. The individualized educational pro-\ngram’s transition statement indicated that K.L.’s program-\nming “is aimed at attending a community or technical college.”3\nParents told the District that they were displeased with K.L.’s\nninth grade education and were “looking at other options.”\nThis was the first time that Parents had ever expressed dissat-\nisfaction with K.L.’s education.\n\n   On the same day, Parents applied to Landmark School, a\nprivate residential school in Massachusetts exclusively for\nlearning-disabled students.4 In her part of the application, K.L.\n  3\n     Plaintiffs assert that they were actually interested in four-year colleges;\nhowever, they admit that K.L. never communicated this aspiration to any-\none at the District.\n   4\n     On the application form, Parents indicated that they were negotiating\nwith the District to fund Landmark School. In fact, Plaintiffs had not even\ndisclosed their interest in Landmark School to the District at that point in\ntime.\n\f            J. L. v. MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT         10461\nindicated that she did not like attending Mercer Island High\nSchool because “my resource room teacher does not let me\nrelax” and “I don’t like the pressure to be an A student.” K.L.\ngenerally thought that her peers were “competitive academi-\ncally” and that if a student did not receive a 4.0 grade point\naverage, “you were the odd one out” and “didn’t fit in.”\n\n   The day after the individualized educational program meet-\ning, the District emailed Parents to set up another individual-\nized educational program meeting to address Parents’\ndissatisfaction with the proposed program. Parents received\nthe District’s email but chose not to respond. Sometime there-\nafter, Mother told K.L.’s case manager at the District that\nK.L.’s primary problem was with the teaching style utilized\nin English foundations. K.L.’s case manager asked Mother if\nK.L. would be more comfortable in a class with either a one-\nto-one or one-to-two teacher to student ratio, although K.L.’s\ncase manager personally believed that this environment would\nbe too restrictive. Mother declined this more reading intensive\nproposal.\n\n   Later in June 2004, Parents sent the District a letter request-\ning an independent educational evaluation at the District’s\nexpense to be performed by Dr. Deborah Hill. See 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1415(b)(1)(A). Parents indicated that they disagreed with\nthe District’s June 2003 reevaluation primarily because of\ninappropriate recommendations for instructional strategies\nand special education services. The District first rejected Dr.\nHill because she was not on the District’s approved list of\nevaluators; however, the District approved Dr. Hill shortly\nthereafter.\n\n   A few days later, the District sent a letter to Parents seeking\ntheir consent for an independent educational evaluation to be\nconducted by Children’s Hospital Regional Medical Center\n(“Children’s Hospital”). See 20 U.S.C. § 1414(a)(2). Parents\ndid not return the consent form.\n\f10462       J. L. v. MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT\n   Dr. Hill evaluated K.L. in early July 2004. Dr. Hill found\nthat K.L. was generally average and had an IQ of 101. K.L.\nscored in the borderline or extremely low range in written\ncomprehension and written language. Dr. Hill concluded that\nK.L.’s special education at the District had been inadequate\nbecause K.L. needed an intensive approach to remedy her dis-\nability. Ultimately, Dr. Hill determined, no public school in\nWashington could provide K.L. with an appropriate educa-\ntion. Dr. Hill recommended Landmark School because of its\nfocus on improving phonological awareness skills.\n\n   In early August 2004, Parents informed the District that\nthey were unilaterally enrolling K.L. in Landmark School for\ntenth grade. They requested tuition reimbursement from the\nDistrict.\n\n   A few days later, the District sent Parents another consent\nform for Children’s Hospital to evaluate K.L. Parents did not\nrespond to the District before K.L. left to attend Landmark\nSchool in Massachusetts.\n\n   In late August, Parents denied consent to the independent\neducational evaluation proposed by the District. Parents indi-\ncated that they would only allow the District to review\nrecords, teacher reports and guidance team reviews. Parents\nrefused to allow any communication between the doctors that\nwould be examining K.L. and the District. Parents asserted\nthat they could not provide knowledgeable consent until they\nreceived a written description of the evaluation procedures to\nbe conducted, the purpose of any testing and each evaluation\ntest, procedure, record or report used to formulate the Dis-\ntrict’s proposal to evaluate. Parents stated that they wanted to\nmake sure each evaluation was necessary and avoid duplica-\ntive tests. Parents put the District on notice that they had an\nattorney.\n\n  In early September 2004, the District sent Parents a third\nconsent form. The District also scheduled an individualized\n\f            J. L. v. MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT       10463\neducational program meeting for mid-September, which was\nthe earliest time the meeting could be scheduled due to the\nlarge number of participants. District staff held a “pre-\nmeeting meeting” to develop an individualized educational\nprogram proposal and discuss the recommendations of Par-\nents and Dr. Hill. At the actual individualized educational\nprogram meeting, the District presented a proposal with sev-\neral changes that followed Dr. Hill’s recommendations,\nincluding more intensive reading instruction. No representa-\ntive from Landmark School attended this meeting. The indi-\nvidualized educational program provided for 1215 minutes\nper week of specially designed instruction in reading, writing,\nmathematics and study skills. The program included transition\nobjectives such as exploring career options, meeting success-\nful dyslexic adults, developing self-advocacy and increasing\nproblem-solving skills. The individualized educational pro-\ngram provided the same accommodations as K.L.’s ninth\ngrade program with the addition of spelling not counting\nagainst K.L.’s grades and the use of additional computer tech-\nnology for spelling. The individualized educational program\nteam rejected a Landmark School placement as inappropriate\nfor K.L. for various reasons, most notably because the Land-\nmark School curriculum did not target K.L.’s deficient areas\nand completely segregated her from her typically-developing\npeers. At the conclusion of the meeting, Parents informed the\nDistrict that K.L. would not return to Mercer Island High\nSchool.\n\n   The District sent Parents a fourth independent educational\nevaluation consent form at the end of September. In early\nOctober, Parents finally consented. The independent educa-\ntional evaluation took place in November when K.L. was\nhome visiting her family on vacation. The independent educa-\ntional evaluation reports from Children’s Hospital over-\nwhelmingly agreed with the District’s proposed\nindividualized educational program. The doctors agreed with\nthe District that sixth to eighth grade was the appropriate\ninstructional level for K.L and that K.L. demonstrated age-\n\f10464         J. L. v. MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT\nappropriate phonological awareness skills. The doctors found\nthat K.L. had made an average of at least one year’s progress\nper year at the District. The doctors concluded that K.L.\nshould be educated with her typically-developing peers as\nmuch as possible. One doctor even opined that there was no\nevidence demonstrating the effectiveness of Landmark\nSchool’s teaching methodology.\n\n   After receiving the independent educational evaluation\nreports, the District conducted its own reevaluation and\ndrafted a reevaluation report dated March 2005. The reevalua-\ntion report concluded that K.L. exhibited age-appropriate pho-\nnological awareness skills, scored in the low range of\nexpressive language skills and spelled poorly. The report rec-\nommended keeping most of K.L.’s ninth grade individualized\neducational program, which meant keeping her in several gen-\neral education classes because the District continued to\nbelieve that mainstreaming was appropriate for K.L.\n\n   The individualized educational program team convened\nlater in March to discuss the District’s proposed program for\neleventh grade. No representatives from Landmark School\nattended but the team reviewed K.L.’s Landmark School\nprogress reports. The proposed program incorporated many\nrecommendations suggested by Dr. Hill and all made by Chil-\ndren’s Hospital. The individualized educational program pro-\nvided previous accommodations as well as access to teacher\nnotes, not being called on without warning, extra time to\nrespond to questions, no penalty for spelling errors and home-\nwork limited to three hours per night. The District expressly\nrejected Parents’ request to include the Landmark School cur-\nriculum in the program. The District also declined to name a\nparticular teaching methodology to be utilized by all teachers\nbecause its experts recommended several effective programs,\nnot just a single “right” choice.5\n  5\n   The parties’ arguments throughout this litigation have routinely bor-\ndered on the quintessential “battle of the experts” concerning what educa-\n\f               J. L. v. MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT                10465\n  On June 6, 2005, Plaintiffs filed a due process hearing\nrequest pursuant to 20 U.S.C. § 1415(f), seeking reimburse-\nment for K.L.’s Landmark School tuition and expenses. The\nDistrict attempted once more, in August 2005, to appease Par-\nents. The District sent Parents a letter offering a program\nengineered by an expert in reading who works at Children’s\nHospital. Parents declined the District’s offer.\n\n  K.L. completed tenth, eleventh and twelfth grades at Land-\nmark School.6 K.L.’s total expenses were $46,479.90 for tenth\ngrade, $50,681.24 for eleventh grade and $54,838.54 for\ntwelfth grade.\n\n                                     II\n\n   The ALJ conducted the due process hearing over the course\nof eleven days in September and October 2005. The ALJ con-\ncluded that the District provided a free appropriate public\neducation to K.L. as required by Rowley and denied tuition\nreimbursement. See 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(10)(C)(i) (stating\nthat a school district is not responsible for private school\nreimbursement if it offered a free appropriate public educa-\ntion). Plaintiffs sought review from the United States District\nCourt for the Western District of Washington. See 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1415(i)(2)(A).\n\n   The district court reversed and remanded. After examining\ncongressional findings added in the 1997 Individuals with\nDisabilities Education Act amendment and the definition of\n“transition services,” the district court concluded that Con-\ngress sought to supersede the “educational benefit” standard\nset forth in Rowley. The district court’s analysis yielded the\n\ntional policy and teaching method is most effective for learning-disabled\nstudents. The District is entitled to deference in deciding what program-\nming is appropriate as a matter of educational policy. See Rowley, 458\nU.S. at 206.\n   6\n     Plaintiffs moved out of the District prior to K.L.’s twelfth grade year.\n\f10466       J. L. v. MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT\nfollowing new free appropriate public education standard\nfocused on transition services:\n\n    [W]hether the District’s approach to [the student’s]\n    educational challenges met the IDEA standard of\n    “equality of opportunity, full participation, indepen-\n    dent living, and economic self-sufficiency” for the\n    minor and whether the programs developed for her\n    conferred a “meaningful educational benefit” in light\n    of the IDEA’s goals.\n\nJ.L. v. Mercer Island Sch. Dist., No. C06-494P, 2006 WL\n3628033, at *6 (W.D. Wash. Dec. 8, 2006). The district court\ninstructed the ALJ that under the new standard, K.L. did not\nreceive a free appropriate public education in eighth, ninth\nand tenth grades. See id. at *4 (“Parents are correct that the\nfailure of the IEPs to focus on progressing K.L. toward self-\nsufficiency (i.e., independent living) and her desired goal of\npost-secondary education represents a failure to confer the\nbenefit contemplated by the IDEA.”). The ALJ’s only tasks\non remand were to determine whether Landmark School was\nan appropriate placement and to fashion relief.\n\n   On remand, the ALJ concluded that K.L.’s placement at\nLandmark School was appropriate. The ALJ awarded reim-\nbursement for tuition and related expenses for tenth and elev-\nenth grades based on the district court’s holding that K.L. did\nnot receive a free appropriate public education in those\ngrades. However, the ALJ equitably reduced tenth grade reim-\nbursement by the cost of seven months of enrollment at Land-\nmark School after finding that Parents unreasonably delayed\nthe District’s reevaluation of K.L. prior to her tenth grade\nyear. See JG v. Douglas County Sch. Dist., 552 F.3d 786, 795\n(9th Cir. 2008) (discussing equitable reductions). The ALJ\nawarded reimbursement for twelfth grade as “compensatory\neducation” based on the district court’s holding that K.L. did\nnot receive a free appropriate public education in eighth and\nninth grades. See Parents of Student W v. Puyallup Sch. Dist.,\n\f            J. L. v. MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT        10467\nNo. 3, 31 F.3d 1489, 1496 (9th Cir. 1994) (discussing com-\npensatory education). Both parties sought district court review\nof the ALJ’s second decision.\n\n   The district court mostly upheld the ALJ’s decision. The\ndistrict court did not impose the ALJ’s equitable reduction.\nThe district court ordered the District to pay for three years\nof Landmark School and $160,687.50 in attorneys’ fees. This\nappeal followed.\n\n                              III\n\n   [1] “The IDEA provides federal funds to assist state and\nlocal agencies in educating children with disabilities, but con-\nditions such funding on compliance with certain goals and\nprocedures.” N.B. v.

Dist., 394 F.3d 634, 644 (9th\nCir. 2005)). “State standards that are not inconsistent with\nfederal standards [under the IDEA] are also enforceable in\nfederal court.” Id. at 1208 (quoting W.G. v. Bd. of Trs. of Tar-\nget Range Sch. Dist. No. 23, 960 F.2d 1479, 1483 (9th Cir.\n1992)).\n\n   States satisfy the Individuals with Disabilities Education\nAct’s substantive requirements by providing a disabled child\nwith a free appropriate public education. In 1975, Congress\nenacted the Education for All Handicapped Children Act,\nwhich contained the following definition of a “free appropri-\nate public education”:\n\f10468       J. L. v. MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT\n    The term “free appropriate public education” means\n    special education and related services which (A)\n    have been provided at public expense, under public\n    supervision and direction, and without charge, (B)\n    meet the standards of the State educational agency,\n    (C) include an appropriate preschool, elementary, or\n    secondary school education in the State involved,\n    and (D) are provided in conformity with the individ-\n    ualized education program required under section\n    614(a)(5).\n\nPub. L. No. 94-142, § 4, 89 Stat. 773, 775 (1975) (codified as\namended at 20 U.S.C. § 1401(8)(D)).\n\n   [2] In 1982, the Supreme Court rendered its seminal deci-\nsion construing the Act and the scope of a free appropriate\npublic education in Board of Education of the Hendrick Hud-\nson Central School District v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176 (1982).\nThe Court noted that “Congress was rather sketchy in estab-\nlishing substantive requirements.” Id. at 206. The Court con-\ncluded that states must provide a “basic floor of opportunity”\nto disabled students, not a “potential-maximizing education.”\nId. at 197 n.21, 200. “Congress did not impose upon the\nStates any greater substantive educational standard than\nwould be necessary to make such access meaningful.” Id. at\n192. Phrased another way, states must “confer some educa-\ntional benefit upon the handicapped child.” Id. at 200.\n\n   To assist courts in this labyrinth of experts, educational pol-\nicy and charged emotions, the Court established a two-part\ntest to determine whether a state has provided a free appropri-\nate public education. Id. at 206-07. “First, has the State com-\nplied with the procedures set forth in the Act? And second, is\nthe individualized educational program developed through the\nAct’s procedures reasonably calculated to enable the child to\nreceive educational benefits?” Id. (footnotes omitted). “If\nthese requirements are met, the State has complied with the\n\f            J. L. v. MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT         10469\nobligations imposed by Congress and the courts can require\nno more.” Id. at 207.\n\n   [3] Congress amended the Act in 1983. See Pub. L. No. 98-\n199, 97 Stat. 1357 (1983). Congress did not alter the defini-\ntion of a free appropriate public education, see id. § 2, 97 Stat.\nat 1357, or indicate its disapproval with Rowley, see generally\nPub. L. No. 98-199, 97 Stat. 1357. Congress introduced the\nconcept of “transition services” by authorizing federal fund-\ning for states “to assist in the transitional process to postse-\ncondary education, vocational training, competitive\nemployment, continuing education, or adult services.” Id.\n§ 10, 97 Stat. at 1367. Congress did not require states to sup-\nply transition services. See id.\n\n   Congress amended the Act again in 1986. See Pub. L. No.\n99-457, 100 Stat. 1145 (1986). Congress did not change the\ndefinition of a free appropriate public education, see id. § 672,\n100 Stat. at 1146-47, or indicate disapproval with Rowley, see\ngenerally Pub. L. No. 99-457, 100 Stat. 1145. Congress\nslightly changed the law regarding transition services to “in-\nclude[ ] supported employment” as an acceptable form of\n“competitive employment.” Id. § 306, 100 Stat. at 1163.\n\n   Congress’ next amendment came in 1990 when the Act’s\nname was changed to the “Individuals with Disabilities Edu-\ncation Act.” See Pub. L. No. 101-476, § 901(a)(1), 104 Stat.\n1103, 1141-42 (1990). Congress again did not change the def-\ninition of a free appropriate public education, see id. § 101,\n104 Stat. at 1103-05, or indicate disapproval with the Rowley\nfree appropriate public education standard, see generally Pub.\nL. No. 101-476, 104 Stat. 1103. Congress made two substan-\ntial changes regarding transition services. First, Congress\nnewly required individualized educational programs to con-\ntain “a statement of the needed transition services for students\nbeginning no later than age 16 and annually thereafter (and,\nwhen determined appropriate for the individual, beginning at\nage 14 or younger) . . . .” Id. § 101(e)(1), 104 Stat. at 1104.\n\f10470         J. L. v. MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT\nSecond, Congress amended the definition of “transition ser-\nvices” to the following:\n\n      The term “transition services” means a coordinated\n      set of activities for a student, designed within an\n      outcome-oriented process, which promotes move-\n      ment from school to post-school activities, including\n      postsecondary education, vocational training, inte-\n      grated employment (including supported employ-\n      ment), continuing and adult education, adult\n      services, independent living, or community partici-\n      pation. The coordinated set of activities shall be\n      based upon the individual student’s needs, taking\n      into account the student’s preferences and interests,\n      and shall include instruction, community experi-\n      ences, the development of employment and other\n      post-school adult living objectives, and, when appro-\n      priate, acquisition of daily living skills and func-\n      tional vocational evaluation.\n\nId. § 101(d), 104 Stat. at 1103-04.\n\n    Congress amended the Individuals with Disabilities Educa-\ntion Act in 1997, the effect of which is disputed in the present\nlitigation.7 See Pub. L. No. 105-17, 111 Stat. 37 (1997). Even\nthough Congress added numerous new findings, see id. § 101,\n111 Stat. at 38-42, Congress did not indicate disapproval with\nRowley, see generally Pub. L. No. 105-17, 111 Stat. 37. Con-\ngress enacted the same definition of a free appropriate public\neducation for all intents and purposes.8 See id. § 602, 111 Stat.\n  7\n     Congress amended the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act\nagain in 2004. See Pub. L. No. 108-446, 118 Stat. 2647 (2004) (codified\nat 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-1491). Plaintiffs’ claims are governed by the 1997\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act because they filed their due\nprocess hearing request before the 2004 Act’s effective date of July 1,\n2005.\n   8\n     Congress merely changed “which” to “that,” replaced commas with\nsemi-colons and updated the internal section reference. See id. § 602, 111\nStat. at 44.\n\f            J. L. v. MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT         10471\nat 44. Congress newly required, “beginning at age 14, and\nupdated annually, a statement of the transition service needs\nof the child . . . that focuses on the child’s courses of study\n(such as participation in advanced-placement courses or a\nvocational education program).” Id. § 614(d)(1)(A)(vii)(I),\n111 Stat. at 84.\n\n                               IV\n\n   “We review the district court’s findings of fact for clear\nerror, even when the district court based those findings on an\nadministrative record.” Douglas County, 552 F.3d at 793. “A\nfinding of fact is clearly erroneous when the evidence in the\nrecord supports the finding but the reviewing court is left with\na definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been com-\nmitted.” Hellgate, 541 F.3d at 1207 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). “Questions of law and mixed questions of fact and\nlaw are reviewed de novo, unless the mixed question is pri-\nmarily factual.” Id.\n\n   “In IDEA cases, unlike other cases reviewing administra-\ntive action, we do not employ a highly deferential standard of\nreview. Nevertheless, complete de novo review ‘is inappropri-\nate.’ We give ‘due weight’ to the state administrative proceed-\nings.” Douglas County, 552 F.3d at 793 (citations omitted).\n“We give particular deference to ‘thorough and careful’\nadministrative findings.” Id.\n\n                               V\n\n   The District argues that the district court erred in conclud-\ning that Congress sought to supersede Rowley or otherwise\nchange the free appropriate public education standard. To\nsupport its newly-extrapolated free appropriate public educa-\ntion standard requiring transition services targeted at “equality\nof opportunity, full participation, independent living, and eco-\nnomic self-sufficiency,” the district court relied on three new\n\f10472       J. L. v. MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT\ncongressional findings and the definition of “transition ser-\nvices.”\n\n  We first examine the district court’s reliance on Congress’\ndefinition of “transition services,” originally added in the\n1990 Individuals with Disabilities Education Act amendment.\nThe district court stated:\n\n       The IDEA is not simply about “access;” it is\n    focused on “transition services, . . . an outcome-\n    oriented process, which promotes movement from\n    school to post-school activities . . . taking into\n    account the student’s preferences and interests.” This\n    is such a significant departure from the previous leg-\n    islative scheme that any citation to pre-1997 case\n    law on special education is suspect.\n\nMercer Island, 2006 WL 3628033, at *4 (citations omitted).\nThe District argues that the district court failed to appreciate\nthat the Education for All Handicapped Children Act was\namended in 1990. The District suggests that this explains the\ndistrict court’s omission of any discussion of the nexus\nbetween the 1990 amendment, 1997 amendment and the dis-\ntrict court’s newfound standard.\n\n   Although the district court’s order is ambiguous, the Dis-\ntrict is likely correct based on two of the district court’s\nremarks. First, the district court stated that “[i]t is important\nto note that the law regarding ‘disability education’ underwent\na change about ten years ago. Prior to that time, the statutory\nscheme was the Education for [sic] Handicapped Children Act\nof 1975 (EHA) . . . .” Mercer Island, 2006 WL 3628033, at\n*4 (emphasis added). Of course, the Education for All Handi-\ncapped Children Act ceased to exist in 1990 when it was\nreplaced by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act,\nwhich was not “about ten years ago.” See Pub. L. No. 101-\n476, § 101(d), 104 Stat. 1103, 1103-04 (1990). The district\ncourt simply appears to have been unaware of the 1990\n\f            J. L. v. MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT         10473\namendment. This explains the district court’s reliance on what\nit thought was a new definition of “transition services” in\n1997, i.e., “about ten years” before the district court’s 2006\norder. The second remark demonstrating that the district court\nwas not cognizant of the 1990 amendment was its footnote\nindicating “[a] 1995 (pre-IDEA) case.” Mercer Island, 2006\nWL 3628033, at *5. This footnote clearly shows that the dis-\ntrict court did not realize that the Individuals with Disabilities\nEducation Act existed before 1997.\n\n   However, because of the equivocal nature of the district\ncourt’s order, it is also possible that the district court thought\nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act “evolved”\nover time to eventually supercede Rowley in 1997. Neither\nPlaintiffs nor the district court have pointed to authority sup-\nporting the proposition that we should consider the legislative\n“evolution” of a statute when determining Congress’ intent.\nPlain meaning interpretation is a “cardinal canon” of statutory\nconstruction, and evolutionary arguments are by no means\nplain. See Conn. Nat’l Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S. 249,\n253-54 (1992); Rubin v. United States, 449 U.S. 424, 430\n(1981) (“When we find the terms of a statute unambiguous,\njudicial inquiry is complete, except in rare and exceptional\ncircumstances.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Addi-\ntionally, for legislation enacted pursuant to the Spending\nClause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1, such as the Individuals\nwith Disabilities Education Act, it would seem that “evolu-\ntionary” theories by their very nature are foreclosed by the\nSupreme Court. See Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v.\nMurphy, 548 U.S. 291, 296 (2006) (requiring Congress to set\nout federal funding conditions “unambiguously” so that states\ncan accept the funding “voluntarily and knowingly”).\n\n   [4] Regardless of the district court’s reasoning, we agree\nwith the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit that there is no\nplausible way to read the definition of “transition services” as\nchanging the free appropriate public education standard:\n\f10474       J. L. v. MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT\n    It seems obvious to us that the word “process”\n    denotes a praxis or procedure; it does not imply a\n    substantive standard or a particular measure of prog-\n    ress. The adjectival phrase “outcome-oriented” is\n    similarly agnostic with respect to ultimate results; it\n    specifies the perspective that participants in the pro-\n    cess should strive to attain but does not establish a\n    standard for evaluating the fruits of that process.\n\nLessard v. Wilton-Lyndeborough Coop. Sch. Dist., 518 F.3d\n18, 28 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n   In addition to the “transition services” definition, the dis-\ntrict court also relied on three new congressional findings to\nsupport its conclusion that the 1997 amendment dramatically\nchanged the free appropriate public education standard. First,\nCongress found that “[s]ince the enactment and implementa-\ntion of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of\n1975, this Act has been successful in ensuring children with\ndisabilities and the families of such children access to a free\nappropriate public education and in improving educational\nresults for children with disabilities.” Pub. L. No. 105-17,\n§ 101(c)(3), 111 Stat. 37, 39 (1997). Second, Congress found\nthat “the implementation of this Act has been impeded by low\nexpectations, and an insufficient focus on applying replicable\nresearch on proven methods of teaching and learning for chil-\ndren with disabilities.” Id. § 101(c)(4), 111 Stat. at 39. Third,\nCongress found that “[i]mproving educational results for chil-\ndren with disabilities is an essential element of our national\npolicy of ensuring equality of opportunity, full participation,\nindependent living, and economic self-sufficiency for individ-\nuals with disabilities.” Id. § 101(c)(1), 111 Stat. at 38.\n\n   [5] We conclude that the district court misinterpreted Con-\ngress’ intent. Had Congress sought to change the free appro-\npriate public education “educational benefit” standard—a\nstandard that courts have followed vis-à-vis Rowley since\n1982—it would have expressed a clear intent to do so.\n\f              J. L. v. MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT                10475\nInstead, three omissions suggest that Congress intended to\nkeep Rowley intact. First, Congress did not change the defini-\ntion of a free appropriate public education in any material\nrespect. If Congress desired to change the free appropriate\npublic education standard, the most logical way to do so\nwould have been to amend the free appropriate public educa-\ntion definition itself. Second, Congress did not indicate in its\ndefinition of “transition services,” or elsewhere, that a dis-\nabled student could not receive a free appropriate public edu-\ncation absent the attainment of transition goals. Third,\nCongress did not express disagreement with the “educational\nbenefit” standard or indicate that it sought to supersede Row-\nley. In fact, Congress did not even mention Rowley.\n\n   [6] In re-enacting the free appropriate public education def-\ninition in 1997, as Congress had done in the Act’s three prior\namendments, Congress presumably was aware of Rowley and\nits renowned “educational benefit” free appropriate public\neducation standard. See Forest Grove Sch. Dist. v. T.A., 129\nS. Ct. 2484, 2492 (2009) (“Congress is presumed to be aware\nof an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and\nto adopt that interpretation when it re-enacts a statute without\nchange.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). These vague\nlegislative findings cited by the district court are insufficient\nfor us to conclude that Congress sought to supersede the ubiq-\nuitous free appropriate public education standard set forth in\nRowley. See Branch v. Smith, 538 U.S. 254, 273 (2003) (stat-\ning that “absent a clearly expressed congressional intention,\nrepeals by implication are not favored” (citations and internal\nquotation marks omitted)).\n\n  [7] We hold that the district court erred in declaring Rowley\nsuperseded.9 The proper standard to determine whether a dis-\n  9\n    We need not separately address the district court’s analysis concerning\nwhether the District appropriately mainstreamed K.L. and provided her\nwith accommodations. The district court’s analysis was clearly infected by\nits interpretation of the 1997 Individuals with Disabilities Education Act\namendment. On remand, the district court may revisit these issues in light\nof Rowley and its progeny.\n\f10476         J. L. v. MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT\nabled child has received a free appropriate public education is\nthe “educational benefit” standard set forth by the Supreme\nCourt in Rowley.10 Our holding is necessary to avoid the con-\nclusion that Congress abrogated sub silentio the Supreme\nCourt’s decision in Rowley. Cf. Forest Grove, 129 S. Ct. at\n2493-94. On remand, the district court must review in the first\ninstance the ALJ’s determination that the District provided a\nfree appropriate public education as required by Rowley.\n\n                                   VI\n\n   Although we remand to the district court the issue of sub-\nstantive compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities\nEducation Act so that the court can consider the matter in the\nfirst instance, we need not remand the procedural compliance\nissues because the district court’s analysis did not turn on any\ndisputed legal standards. The district court held that the Dis-\ntrict failed to confer a free appropriate public education based\non procedural violations involving transition services, the Dis-\ntrict’s “pre-meeting meeting,” lack of a specified teaching\nmethodology and lack of specified minutes of instruction. We\ndiscuss each contention in turn.\n\n   [8] The District argues that Plaintiffs failed to exhaust their\nclaim that the District committed a procedural violation of the\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act in regards to tran-\nsition services. “[W]hen a plaintiff has alleged injuries that\ncould be redressed to any degree by the IDEA’s administra-\ntive procedures and remedies, exhaustion of those remedies is\n  10\n    Some confusion exists in this circuit regarding whether the Individuals\nwith Disabilities Education Act requires school districts to provide dis-\nabled students with “educational benefit,” “some educational benefit” or\na “meaningful” educational benefit. See, e.g., Hellgate, 541 F.3d at\n1212-13. As we read the Supreme Court’s decision in Rowley, all three\nphrases refer to the same standard. School districts must, to “make such\naccess meaningful,” confer at least “some educational benefit” on disabled\nstudents. See Rowley, 458 U.S. at 192, 200. For ease of discussion, we\nrefer to this standard as the “educational benefit” standard.\n\f            J. L. v. MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT         10477\nrequired.” Robb v. Bethel Sch. Dist. # 403, 308 F.3d 1047,\n1048 (9th Cir. 2002); see also 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(A).\nPlaintiffs did not raise a transition services argument in their\nadministrative complaint or due process hearing. For this rea-\nson, the ALJ did not address transition services. Nevertheless,\nthe district court held that K.L. was denied a free appropriate\npublic education based on the District’s failure to supply\nappropriate transition services. We hold that the district court\nlacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider this unexhausted\nclaim, and reverse the district court.\n\n   [9] The District next argues that the district court erred in\nconcluding that it predetermined K.L.’s individualized educa-\ntional program at the “pre-meeting meeting” in September\n2004. There is no evidence supporting the district court’s\nfinding that the District made program decisions at this prepa-\nratory meeting. See 34 C.F.R. 300.501(b)(3) (stating that an\nindividualized educational program meeting “does not include\npreparatory activities that public agency personnel engage in\nto develop a proposal or response to a parent proposal that\nwill be discussed at a later meeting”). Not only did Parents\nactively participate in the individualized educational program\nformulation process, the District changed various aspects of\nthe program based on the recommendations of Parents and Dr.\nHill. See Target Range, 960 F.2d at 1484. We hold that the\nDistrict did not commit a procedural violation of the Individu-\nals with Disabilities Education Act in its “pre-meeting meet-\ning,” and reverse the district court.\n\n   [10] The District next argues that the district court erred in\nconcluding that the District committed a procedural violation\nof the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act by not\nspecifying a teaching methodology in K.L.’s individualized\neducational program. Although school districts should specify\na teaching methodology for some students, for other students\n“IEPs may not need to address the instructional method to be\nused because specificity about methodology is not necessary\nto enable those students to receive an appropriate education.”\n\f10478       J. L. v. MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT\nSee 64 Fed. Reg. 12,552. We accord deference to the Dis-\ntrict’s determination and the ALJ’s finding that K.L.’s teach-\ners needed flexibility in teaching methodologies because there\nwas not a single methodology that would always be effective.\nWe hold that the District did not commit a procedural viola-\ntion of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act by not\nspecifying teaching methodologies in K.L.’s individualized\neducational programs, and reverse the district court.\n\n   [11] In a similar vein, the District argues that the district\ncourt erred in concluding that the District committed a proce-\ndural violation by not specifying the minutes of instruction to\nbe devoted to each of K.L.’s services in her individualized\neducational programs. School districts need not specify min-\nutes of instruction if they are reasonably known to all “in-\nvolved in both the development and implementation of the\nIEP.” See 64 Fed. Reg. 12,479. Under the circumstances of\nthis case, we conclude that the amount of time to be devoted\nto K.L’s services was clearly known to K.L.’s individualized\neducational program team. Even if the minutes were not\nknown, however, Plaintiffs have failed to set forth a plausible\nargument that this procedural violation resulted in the denial\nof a free appropriate public education. Cf. O’Toole v. Olathe\nDist. Schs. Unified Sch., 144 F.3d 692, 705-06 (10th Cir.\n1998) (holding that an individualized educational program\nthat merely provided for educational services “as appropriate”\ndid not result in the denial of a free appropriate public educa-\ntion). We hold that the District did not violate the Individuals\nwith Disabilities Education Act by not specifying minutes of\ninstruction in K.L.’s individualized educational program, and\nreverse the district court.\n\n                              VII\n\n  For the reasons discussed, we conclude that the district\ncourt erred in holding that the definition of a free appropriate\npublic education set forth by the Supreme Court in Rowley\n\f              J. L. v. MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT              10479\nhas been superseded, and accordingly, vacate its orders.11 In\naddition, we reverse the district court’s conclusions that the\nDistrict committed procedural violations of the Individuals\nwith Disabilities Education Act that resulted in the denial of\na free appropriate public education.\n\n   Because it is not clear whether our rulings dispose of all of\nK.L.’s claims, we remand this case to allow K.L. to pursue\nany such claims she may have asserted that are not deter-\nmined by our opinion. On remand, the district court must\nreview the ALJ’s determination that the District provided\nK.L. with a free appropriate public education pursuant to the\n“educational benefit” standard set forth in Rowley and reiter-\nated in this opinion. We deny the District’s request for a dif-\nferent judge on remand.\n\n REVERSED            in    part,    VACATED           in   part     and\nREMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n  11\n    Because the district court’s awards of reimbursement, related\nexpenses and attorneys’ fees were premised on its determination that the\nDistrict failed to provide K.L. with a free appropriate public education,\nvacation of that determination also vacates those awards.\n\f",

To “level the playing field”\nin K.L.’s mainstreamed general education classes, the District\nprovided K.L. with accommodations. The District also pro-\nvided K.L. with specially designed instruction (i.e., “special\neducation”) in reading and writing in a “resource room” for\nspecial students. For fourth and fifth grades, Parents paid for\nK.L. to attend a private school serving children with reading\nand writing difficulties.\n\n   K.L. returned to the District for her sixth grade education\nat Islander Middle School. The District reevaluated K.L. and\ndetermined that she was still eligible for special education.\nK.L.’s intelligence quotient (“IQ”) revealed that she was in\nthe average range at the low end. In accordance with K.L.’s\nindividualized educational program, the District educated\nK.L. with specially designed instruction in reading, writing\nand mathematics. The District provided K.L. with accommo-\ndations in her general education classes including peers to\nhelp her read and take notes, use of spelling software, modi-\nfied instructions, alternate exam methods, reduced assign-\nments and extra time for assignments. K.L. ended her sixth\ngrade year with an “A-” in special education reading, an\n“A-” in special education language arts, a “B+” in special\neducation mathematics, an “A” in special education structured\nstudy, an “A-” in general education science, a “pass” in gen-\neral education art and a “pass” in general education Spanish.\n  2\n  This factual background reflects our “particular deference” to the\nALJ’s “thorough and careful” administrative findings.

MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT\n   In seventh grade, K.L. continued with largely the same\nindividualized educational program that she followed in sixth\ngrade after her individualized educational program team con-\ncluded that the program was effective. At the end of seventh\ngrade, K.L. received an “A-” in special education language\narts (i.e., reading and writing), an “A” in special education\nmathematics, an “A-” in special education structured study, a\n“B+” in general education biology and an “A” in general edu-\ncation art.\n\n   In eighth grade, the District modified K.L.’s individualized\neducational program and provided 750 minutes per week of\nspecially designed instruction in reading, writing, mathemat-\nics and study skills. K.L.’s accommodations basically stayed\nthe same. Halfway through eighth grade, in January 2003,\nMother contacted the District regarding K.L.’s frustrations\nwith her language arts class. K.L. considered her language\narts class “boring,” “stupid” and “too hard.” Specifically, K.L.\ndid not like being singled out to give an answer in front of her\nclassmates. In response, K.L.’s language arts teacher changed\nher teaching style, thereby galvanizing K.L. to increase her\nclassroom participation and self-confidence.\n\n   K.L. took a standardized test of basic skills and scored in\nthe second percentile of eighth graders. Although K.L. made\nprogress on all of her eighth grade individualized educational\nprogram objectives, she failed to meet all writing objectives,\ntwo reading objectives, one mathematics objective and one\nstudy skills objective. At the end of eighth grade, K.L.\nreceived a “B” in special education language arts, a “B+” in\nspecial education mathematics, an “A” in special education\nstructured study, an “A” in general education science, an “A”\nin general education social studies and a “pass” as a teacher’s\nassistant.\n\n  The District reevaluated K.L. after eighth grade in June\n2003. K.L.’s IQ showed improvement in mathematics and\nregression in numerical operations. One of K.L.’s teachers\n\f            J. L. v. MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT        10459\nobserved that K.L. performed much better in class than her\nstandardized test results showed. This was due to a combina-\ntion of K.L.’s sporadic lack of motivation and propensity to\nget frustrated on tests and simply give up. K.L’s individual-\nized educational program team met shortly thereafter to dis-\ncuss the District’s reevaluation. A few days later, K.L.’s\nindividualized educational program team met and developed\na ninth grade individualized educational program with lofty\nobjectives. Based on K.L.’s great progress in eighth grade\nmathematics, K.L. was placed in a ninth grade algebra class\nwith a difficulty level between special education mathematics\nand general education algebra.\n\n   During first semester of ninth grade at Mercer Island High\nSchool, not only did K.L. earn good grades, such as an “A-”\nin algebra, but she also participated in athletics and enjoyed\nan active (and sometimes distractive) social life. Unfortu-\nnately, in March 2004, K.L. missed three weeks of school due\nto an illness. One of K.L.’s teachers believed that K.L. “was\nnot the same student” after she returned and that she was less\nmotivated. K.L. turned in only half of her algebra homework\nand her quiz and test grades decreased as a result. At K.L.’s\nrequest, her individualized educational program team returned\nher to special education mathematics and provided her with\nanother resource room period. Parents hired a private educa-\ntional consultant and began researching private schools for\nK.L.\n\n   At the end of ninth grade, K.L. received a “B-” in special\neducation English foundations, an “A-” in special education\nmathematics, a “C+” in general education history, a “B” in\ngeneral education chemistry and an “A” as a teacher’s assis-\ntant. K.L.’s grade point average was a 3.49, which was higher\nthan both the median and mean grade point average for ninth\ngraders in the District. By the end of ninth grade, K.L. met all\nof her mathematics and study skills individualized educational\nprogram objectives, however, she did not meet two of her\nreading objectives and any of her writing objectives. Never-\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">10460</span>          <span class=\"reporter\">Johns.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. v. MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT\ntheless, K.L.’s individualized educational program team\nthought that K.L. “had a very successful year, her grades have\nbeen high and though at times she is frustrated or afraid, she\nhas managed to tackle the projects with support.” Unbe-\nknownst to anyone at the District, Mother completed much of\nK.L.’s ninth grade homework, sometimes even in K.L.’s\nabsence.\n\n   Shortly after ninth grade concluded, in June 2004, the Dis-\ntrict held an individualized educational program meeting and\npresented a proposed tenth grade individualized educational\nprogram to Parents. The proposed program provided 972 min-\nutes per week of specially designed instruction in reading,\nwriting, mathematics, study skills and transitions. K.L.’s read-\ning goal was to increase reading decoding and comprehension\nskills on grade-level materials. K.L.’s written language goal\nwas to increase written expression skills in a more indepen-\ndent manner. The individualized educational program pro-\nvided most of the same accommodations as K.L.’s ninth grade\nindividualized educational program with the addition of\naccess to books on tape. The individualized educational pro-\ngram’s transition statement indicated that K.L.’s program-\nming “is aimed at attending a community or technical college.”3\nParents told the District that they were displeased with K.L.’s\nninth grade education and were “looking at other options.”\nThis was the first time that Parents had ever expressed dissat-\nisfaction with K.L.’s education.\n\n   On the same day, Parents applied to Landmark School, a\nprivate residential school in Massachusetts exclusively for\nlearning-disabled students.4 In her part of the application, K.L.\n  3\n     Plaintiffs assert that they were actually interested in four-year colleges;\nhowever, they admit that K.L. never communicated this aspiration to any-\none at the District.\n   4\n     On the application form, Parents indicated that they were negotiating\nwith the District to fund Landmark School. In fact, Plaintiffs had not even\ndisclosed their interest in Landmark School to the District at that point in\ntime.\n\f            J. L. v. MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT         10461\nindicated that she did not like attending Mercer Island High\nSchool because “my resource room teacher does not let me\nrelax” and “I don’t like the pressure to be an A student.” K.L.\ngenerally thought that her peers were “competitive academi-\ncally” and that if a student did not receive a 4.0 grade point\naverage, “you were the odd one out” and “didn’t fit in.”\n\n   The day after the individualized educational program meet-\ning, the District emailed Parents to set up another individual-\nized educational program meeting to address Parents’\ndissatisfaction with the proposed program. Parents received\nthe District’s email but chose not to respond. Sometime there-\nafter, Mother told K.L.’s case manager at the District that\nK.L.’s primary problem was with the teaching style utilized\nin English foundations. K.L.’s case manager asked Mother if\nK.L. would be more comfortable in a class with either a one-\nto-one or one-to-two teacher to student ratio, although K.L.’s\ncase manager personally believed that this environment would\nbe too restrictive. Mother declined this more reading intensive\nproposal.\n\n   Later in June 2004, Parents sent the District a letter request-\ning an independent educational evaluation at the District’s\nexpense to be performed by Dr. Deborah Hill. See 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1415(b)(1)(A). Parents indicated that they disagreed with\nthe District’s June 2003 reevaluation primarily because of\ninappropriate recommendations for instructional strategies\nand special education services. The District first rejected Dr.\nHill because she was not on the District’s approved list of\nevaluators; however, the District approved Dr. Hill shortly\nthereafter.\n\n   A few days later, the District sent a letter to Parents seeking\ntheir consent for an independent educational evaluation to be\nconducted by Children’s Hospital Regional Medical Center\n(“Children’s Hospital”). See 20 U.S.C. § 1414(a)(2). Parents\ndid not return the consent form.\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">10462</span>       <span class=\"reporter\">Johns.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. v. MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT\n   Dr. Hill evaluated K.L. in early July 2004. Dr. Hill found\nthat K.L. was generally average and had an IQ of 101. K.L.\nscored in the borderline or extremely low range in written\ncomprehension and written language. Dr. Hill concluded that\nK.L.’s special education at the District had been inadequate\nbecause K.L. needed an intensive approach to remedy her dis-\nability. Ultimately, Dr. Hill determined, no public school in\nWashington could provide K.L. with an appropriate educa-\ntion. Dr. Hill recommended Landmark School because of its\nfocus on improving phonological awareness skills.\n\n   In early August 2004, Parents informed the District that\nthey were unilaterally enrolling K.L. in Landmark School for\ntenth grade. They requested tuition reimbursement from the\nDistrict.\n\n   A few days later, the District sent Parents another consent\nform for Children’s Hospital to evaluate K.L. Parents did not\nrespond to the District before K.L. left to attend Landmark\nSchool in Massachusetts.\n\n   In late August, Parents denied consent to the independent\neducational evaluation proposed by the District. Parents indi-\ncated that they would only allow the District to review\nrecords, teacher reports and guidance team reviews. Parents\nrefused to allow any communication between the doctors that\nwould be examining K.L. and the District. Parents asserted\nthat they could not provide knowledgeable consent until they\nreceived a written description of the evaluation procedures to\nbe conducted, the purpose of any testing and each evaluation\ntest, procedure, record or report used to formulate the Dis-\ntrict’s proposal to evaluate. Parents stated that they wanted to\nmake sure each evaluation was necessary and avoid duplica-\ntive tests. Parents put the District on notice that they had an\nattorney.\n\n  In early September 2004, the District sent Parents a third\nconsent form. The District also scheduled an individualized\n\f            J. L. v. MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT       10463\neducational program meeting for mid-September, which was\nthe earliest time the meeting could be scheduled due to the\nlarge number of participants. District staff held a “pre-\nmeeting meeting” to develop an individualized educational\nprogram proposal and discuss the recommendations of Par-\nents and Dr. Hill. At the actual individualized educational\nprogram meeting, the District presented a proposal with sev-\neral changes that followed Dr. Hill’s recommendations,\nincluding more intensive reading instruction. No representa-\ntive from Landmark School attended this meeting. The indi-\nvidualized educational program provided for 1215 minutes\nper week of specially designed instruction in reading, writing,\nmathematics and study skills. The program included transition\nobjectives such as exploring career options, meeting success-\nful dyslexic adults, developing self-advocacy and increasing\nproblem-solving skills. The individualized educational pro-\ngram provided the same accommodations as K.L.’s ninth\ngrade program with the addition of spelling not counting\nagainst K.L.’s grades and the use of additional computer tech-\nnology for spelling. The individualized educational program\nteam rejected a Landmark School placement as inappropriate\nfor K.L. for various reasons, most notably because the Land-\nmark School curriculum did not target K.L.’s deficient areas\nand completely segregated her from her typically-developing\npeers. At the conclusion of the meeting, Parents informed the\nDistrict that K.L. would not return to Mercer Island High\nSchool.\n\n   The District sent Parents a fourth independent educational\nevaluation consent form at the end of September. In early\nOctober, Parents finally consented. The independent educa-\ntional evaluation took place in November when K.L. was\nhome visiting her family on vacation. The independent educa-\ntional evaluation reports from Children’s Hospital over-\nwhelmingly agreed with the District’s proposed\nindividualized educational program. The doctors agreed with\nthe District that sixth to eighth grade was the appropriate\ninstructional level for K.L and that K.L. demonstrated age-\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">10464</span>         <span class=\"reporter\">Johns.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. v. MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT\nappropriate phonological awareness skills. The doctors found\nthat K.L. had made an average of at least one year’s progress\nper year at the District. The doctors concluded that K.L.\nshould be educated with her typically-developing peers as\nmuch as possible. One doctor even opined that there was no\nevidence demonstrating the effectiveness of Landmark\nSchool’s teaching methodology.\n\n   After receiving the independent educational evaluation\nreports, the District conducted its own reevaluation and\ndrafted a reevaluation report dated March 2005. The reevalua-\ntion report concluded that K.L. exhibited age-appropriate pho-\nnological awareness skills, scored in the low range of\nexpressive language skills and spelled poorly. The report rec-\nommended keeping most of K.L.’s ninth grade individualized\neducational program, which meant keeping her in several gen-\neral education classes because the District continued to\nbelieve that mainstreaming was appropriate for K.L.\n\n   The individualized educational program team convened\nlater in March to discuss the District’s proposed program for\neleventh grade. No representatives from Landmark School\nattended but the team reviewed K.L.’s Landmark School\nprogress reports. The proposed program incorporated many\nrecommendations suggested by Dr. Hill and all made by Chil-\ndren’s Hospital. The individualized educational program pro-\nvided previous accommodations as well as access to teacher\nnotes, not being called on without warning, extra time to\nrespond to questions, no penalty for spelling errors and home-\nwork limited to three hours per night. The District expressly\nrejected Parents’ request to include the Landmark School cur-\nriculum in the program. The District also declined to name a\nparticular teaching methodology to be utilized by all teachers\nbecause its experts recommended several effective programs,\nnot just a single “right” choice.5\n  5\n   The parties’ arguments throughout this litigation have routinely bor-\ndered on the quintessential “battle of the experts” concerning what educa-\n\f               J. L. v. MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT                10465\n  On June 6, 2005, Plaintiffs filed a due process hearing\nrequest pursuant to 20 U.S.C. § 1415(f), seeking reimburse-\nment for K.L.’s Landmark School tuition and expenses. The\nDistrict attempted once more, in August 2005, to appease Par-\nents. The District sent Parents a letter offering a program\nengineered by an expert in reading who works at Children’s\nHospital. Parents declined the District’s offer.\n\n  K.L. completed tenth, eleventh and twelfth grades at Land-\nmark School.6 K.L.’s total expenses were $46,479.90 for tenth\ngrade, $50,681.24 for eleventh grade and $54,838.54 for\ntwelfth grade.\n\n                                     II\n\n   The ALJ conducted the due process hearing over the course\nof eleven days in September and October 2005. The ALJ con-\ncluded that the District provided a free appropriate public\neducation to K.L. as required by Rowley and denied tuition\nreimbursement. See 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(10)(C)(i) (stating\nthat a school district is not responsible for private school\nreimbursement if it offered a free appropriate public educa-\ntion). Plaintiffs sought review from the United States District\nCourt for the Western District of Washington. See 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1415(i)(2)(A).\n\n   The district court reversed and remanded. After examining\ncongressional findings added in the 1997 Individuals with\nDisabilities Education Act amendment and the definition of\n“transition services,” the district court concluded that Con-\ngress sought to supersede the “educational benefit” standard\nset forth in Rowley. The district court’s analysis yielded the\n\ntional policy and teaching method is most effective for learning-disabled\nstudents. The District is entitled to deference in deciding what program-\nming is appropriate as a matter of educational policy. See Rowley, 458\nU.S. at 206.\n   6\n     Plaintiffs moved out of the District prior to K.L.’s twelfth grade year.\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">10466</span>       <span class=\"reporter\">Johns.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. v.

See id. at *4 (“Parents are correct that the\nfailure of the IEPs to focus on progressing K.L. toward self-\nsufficiency (i.e., independent living) and her desired goal of\npost-secondary education represents a failure to confer the\nbenefit contemplated by the IDEA.”). The ALJ’s only tasks\non remand were to determine whether Landmark School was\nan appropriate placement and to fashion relief.\n\n   On remand, the ALJ concluded that K.L.’s placement at\nLandmark School was appropriate. The ALJ awarded reim-\nbursement for tuition and related expenses for tenth and elev-\nenth grades based on the district court’s holding that K.L. did\nnot receive a free appropriate public education in those\ngrades. However, the ALJ equitably reduced tenth grade reim-\nbursement by the cost of seven months of enrollment at Land-\nmark School after finding that Parents unreasonably delayed\nthe District’s reevaluation of K.L. prior to her tenth grade\nyear.

The Court con-\ncluded that states must provide a “basic floor of opportunity”\nto disabled students, not a “potential-maximizing education.”\nId. at 197 n.21, 200. “Congress did not impose upon the\nStates any greater substantive educational standard than\nwould be necessary to make such access meaningful.” Id. at\n192. Phrased another way, states must “confer some educa-\ntional benefit upon the handicapped child.” Id. at 200.\n\n   To assist courts in this labyrinth of experts, educational pol-\nicy and charged emotions, the Court established a two-part\ntest to determine whether a state has provided a free appropri-\nate public education. Id. at 206-07. “First, has the State com-\nplied with the procedures set forth in the Act? And second, is\nthe individualized educational program developed through the\nAct’s procedures reasonably calculated to enable the child to\nreceive educational benefits?” Id.

No. 98-199, 97 Stat. 1357. Congress introduced the\nconcept of “transition services” by authorizing federal fund-\ning for states “to assist in the transitional process to postse-\ncondary education, vocational training, competitive\nemployment, continuing education, or adult services.” Id.\n§ 10, 97 Stat. at 1367.

MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT\nSecond, Congress amended the definition of “transition ser-\nvices” to the following:\n\n      The term “transition services” means a coordinated\n      set of activities for a student, designed within an\n      outcome-oriented process, which promotes move-\n      ment from school to post-school activities, including\n      postsecondary education, vocational training, inte-\n      grated employment (including supported employ-\n      ment), continuing and adult education, adult\n      services, independent living, or community partici-\n      pation. The coordinated set of activities shall be\n      based upon the individual student’s needs, taking\n      into account the student’s preferences and interests,\n      and shall include instruction, community experi-\n      ences, the development of employment and other\n      post-school adult living objectives, and, when appro-\n      priate, acquisition of daily living skills and func-\n      tional vocational evaluation.\n\nId. § 101(d), 104 Stat. at 1103-04.\n\n    Congress amended the Individuals with Disabilities Educa-\ntion Act in 1997, the effect of which is disputed in the present\nlitigation.7 See Pub. L. No. 105-17, 111 Stat. 37 (1997). Even\nthough Congress added numerous new findings, see id. § 101,\n111 Stat. at 38-42, Congress did not indicate disapproval with\nRowley, see generally Pub. L. No. 105-17, 111 Stat. 37. Con-\ngress enacted the same definition of a free appropriate public\neducation for all intents and purposes.8 See id. § 602, 111 Stat.\n  7\n     Congress amended the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act\nagain in 2004. See Pub. L. No. 108-446, 118 Stat. 2647 (2004) (codified\nat 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-1491). Plaintiffs’ claims are governed by the 1997\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act because they filed their due\nprocess hearing request before the 2004 Act’s effective date of July 1,\n2005.\n   8\n     Congress merely changed “which” to “that,” replaced commas with\nsemi-colons and updated the internal section reference. See id. § 602, 111\nStat. at 44.\n\f            J. L. v. MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT         10471\nat 44. Congress newly required, “beginning at age 14, and\nupdated annually, a statement of the transition service needs\nof the child . . . that focuses on the child’s courses of study\n(such as participation in advanced-placement courses or a\nvocational education program).” Id. § 614(d)(1)(A)(vii)(I),\n111 Stat. at 84.\n\n                               IV\n\n   “We review the district court’s findings of fact for clear\nerror, even when the district court based those findings on an\nadministrative record.” Douglas County, 552 F.3d at 793. “A\nfinding of fact is clearly erroneous when the evidence in the\nrecord supports the finding but the reviewing court is left with\na definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been com-\nmitted.” Hellgate, 541 F.3d at 1207 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). “Questions of law and mixed questions of fact and\nlaw are reviewed de novo, unless the mixed question is pri-\nmarily factual.” Id.\n\n   “In IDEA cases, unlike other cases reviewing administra-\ntive action, we do not employ a highly deferential standard of\nreview.

To\nsupport its newly-extrapolated free appropriate public educa-\ntion standard requiring transition services targeted at “equality\nof opportunity, full participation, independent living, and eco-\nnomic self-sufficiency,” the district court relied on three new\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">10472</span>       <span class=\"reporter\">Johns.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. v. MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT\ncongressional findings and the definition of “transition ser-\nvices.”\n\n  We first examine the district court’s reliance on Congress’\ndefinition of “transition services,” originally added in the\n1990 Individuals with Disabilities Education Act amendment.\nThe district court stated:\n\n       The IDEA is not simply about “access;” it is\n    focused on “transition services, . . . an outcome-\n    oriented process, which promotes movement from\n    school to post-school activities . . . taking into\n    account the student’s preferences and interests.” This\n    is such a significant departure from the previous leg-\n    islative scheme that any citation to pre-1997 case\n    law on special education is suspect.\n\nMercer Island, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3628033</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4 (citations omitted).\nThe District argues that the district court failed to appreciate\nthat the Education for All Handicapped Children Act was\namended in 1990. The District suggests that this explains the\ndistrict court’s omission of any discussion of the nexus\nbetween the 1990 amendment, 1997 amendment and the dis-\ntrict court’s newfound standard.\n\n   Although the district court’s order is ambiguous, the Dis-\ntrict is likely correct based on two of the district court’s\nremarks. First, the district court stated that “[i]t is important\nto note that the law regarding ‘disability education’ underwent\na change about ten years ago. Prior to that time, the statutory\nscheme was the Education for [sic] Handicapped Children Act\nof 1975 (EHA) . . . .” Mercer Island, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3628033</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at\n*4 (emphasis added). Of course, the Education for All Handi-\ncapped Children Act ceased to exist in 1990 when it was\nreplaced by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act,\nwhich was not “about ten years ago.” See Pub. L. No. 101-\n476, § 101(d), 104 Stat. 1103, 1103-04 (1990). The district\ncourt simply appears to have been unaware of the </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1990</span>\n\f            <span class=\"reporter\">Johns.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. v. MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT         10473\namendment. This explains the district court’s reliance on what\nit thought was a new definition of “transition services” in\n1997, i.e., “about ten years” before the district court’s 2006\norder. The second remark demonstrating that the district court\nwas not cognizant of the 1990 amendment was its footnote\nindicating “[a] 1995 (pre-IDEA) case.” Mercer Island, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3628033</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5. This footnote clearly shows that the dis-\ntrict court did not realize that the Individuals with Disabilities\nEducation Act existed before 1997.\n\n   However, because of the equivocal nature of the district\ncourt’s order, it is also possible that the district court thought\nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act “evolved”\nover time to eventually supercede Rowley in 1997. Neither\nPlaintiffs nor the district court have pointed to authority sup-\nporting the proposition that we should consider the legislative\n“evolution” of a statute when determining Congress’ intent.\nPlain meaning interpretation is a “cardinal canon” of statutory\nconstruction, and evolutionary arguments are by no means\nplain.

Addi-\ntionally, for legislation enacted pursuant to the Spending\nClause, U.S. Const. art.

MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT\n    It seems obvious to us that the word “process”\n    denotes a praxis or procedure; it does not imply a\n    substantive standard or a particular measure of prog-\n    ress. The adjectival phrase “outcome-oriented” is\n    similarly agnostic with respect to ultimate results; it\n    specifies the perspective that participants in the pro-\n    cess should strive to attain but does not establish a\n    standard for evaluating the fruits of that process.\n\nLessard v.

First,\nCongress found that “[s]ince the enactment and implementa-\ntion of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of\n1975, this Act has been successful in ensuring children with\ndisabilities and the families of such children access to a free\nappropriate public education and in improving educational\nresults for children with disabilities.” Pub. L. No. 105-17,\n§ 101(c)(3), 111 Stat. 37, 39 (1997). Second, Congress found\nthat “the implementation of this Act has been impeded by low\nexpectations, and an insufficient focus on applying replicable\nresearch on proven methods of teaching and learning for chil-\ndren with disabilities.” Id. § 101(c)(4), 111 Stat. at 39. Third,\nCongress found that “[i]mproving educational results for chil-\ndren with disabilities is an essential element of our national\npolicy of ensuring equality of opportunity, full participation,\nindependent living, and economic self-sufficiency for individ-\nuals with disabilities.” Id. § 101(c)(1), 111 Stat. at 38.\n\n   [5] We conclude that the district court misinterpreted Con-\ngress’ intent. Had Congress sought to change the free appro-\npriate public education “educational benefit” standard—a\nstandard that courts have followed vis-à-vis Rowley since\n1982—it would have expressed a clear intent to do so.\n\f              J. L. v. MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT                10475\nInstead, three omissions suggest that Congress intended to\nkeep Rowley intact. First, Congress did not change the defini-\ntion of a free appropriate public education in any material\nrespect. If Congress desired to change the free appropriate\npublic education standard, the most logical way to do so\nwould have been to amend the free appropriate public educa-\ntion definition itself. Second, Congress did not indicate in its\ndefinition of “transition services,” or elsewhere, that a dis-\nabled student could not receive a free appropriate public edu-\ncation absent the attainment of transition goals. Third,\nCongress did not express disagreement with the “educational\nbenefit” standard or indicate that it sought to supersede Row-\nley. In fact, Congress did not even mention Rowley.\n\n   [6] In re-enacting the free appropriate public education def-\ninition in 1997, as Congress had done in the Act’s three prior\namendments, Congress presumably was aware of Rowley and\nits renowned “educational benefit” free appropriate public\neducation standard. See Forest Grove Sch. Dist. v. T.A., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145855\"><a href=\"/opinion/145855/forest-grove-school-dist-v-t-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.

These vague\nlegislative findings cited by the district court are insufficient\nfor us to conclude that Congress sought to supersede the ubiq-\nuitous free appropriate public education standard set forth in\nRowley.

Cf. Forest Grove, 129 S. Ct. at\n2493-94. On remand, the district court must review in the first\ninstance the ALJ’s determination that the District provided a\nfree appropriate public education as required by Rowley.\n\n                                   VI\n\n   Although we remand to the district court the issue of sub-\nstantive compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities\nEducation Act so that the court can consider the matter in the\nfirst instance, we need not remand the procedural compliance\nissues because the district court’s analysis did not turn on any\ndisputed legal standards. The district court held that the Dis-\ntrict failed to confer a free appropriate public education based\non procedural violations involving transition services, the Dis-\ntrict’s “pre-meeting meeting,” lack of a specified teaching\nmethodology and lack of specified minutes of instruction. We\ndiscuss each contention in turn.\n\n   [8] The District argues that Plaintiffs failed to exhaust their\nclaim that the District committed a procedural violation of the\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act in regards to tran-\nsition services. “[W]hen a plaintiff has alleged injuries that\ncould be redressed to any degree by the IDEA’s administra-\ntive procedures and remedies, exhaustion of those remedies is\n  10\n    Some confusion exists in this circuit regarding whether the Individuals\nwith Disabilities Education Act requires school districts to provide dis-\nabled students with “educational benefit,” “some educational benefit” or\na “meaningful” educational benefit. See, e.g., Hellgate, 541 F.3d at\n1212-13. As we read the Supreme Court’s decision in Rowley, all three\nphrases refer to the same standard. School districts must, to “make such\naccess meaningful,” confer at least “some educational benefit” on disabled\nstudents. See Rowley, 458 U.S. at 192, 200. For ease of discussion, we\nrefer to this standard as the “educational benefit” standard.\n\f            J. L. v. MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT         10477\nrequired.” Robb v. Bethel Sch.

For this rea-\nson, the ALJ did not address transition services. Nevertheless,\nthe district court held that K.L. was denied a free appropriate\npublic education based on the District’s failure to supply\nappropriate transition services. We hold that the district court\nlacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider this unexhausted\nclaim, and reverse the district court.\n\n   [9] The District next argues that the district court erred in\nconcluding that it predetermined K.L.’s individualized educa-\ntional program at the “pre-meeting meeting” in September\n2004. There is no evidence supporting the district court’s\nfinding that the District made program decisions at this prepa-\nratory meeting. See 34 C.F.R. 300.501(b)(3) (stating that an\nindividualized educational program meeting “does not include\npreparatory activities that public agency personnel engage in\nto develop a proposal or response to a parent proposal that\nwill be discussed at a later meeting”). Not only did Parents\nactively participate in the individualized educational program\nformulation process, the District changed various aspects of\nthe program based on the recommendations of Parents and Dr.\nHill. See Target Range, 960 F.2d at 1484. We hold that the\nDistrict did not commit a procedural violation of the Individu-\nals with Disabilities Education Act in its “pre-meeting meet-\ning,” and reverse the district court.\n\n   [10] The District next argues that the district court erred in\nconcluding that the District committed a procedural violation\nof the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act by not\nspecifying a teaching methodology in K.L.’s individualized\neducational program. Although school districts should specify\na teaching methodology for some students, for other students\n“IEPs may not need to address the instructional method to be\nused because specificity about methodology is not necessary\nto enable those students to receive an appropriate education.”\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">10478</span>       <span class=\"reporter\">Johns.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. v.

We accord deference to the Dis-\ntrict’s determination and the ALJ’s finding that K.L.’s teach-\ners needed flexibility in teaching methodologies because there\nwas not a single methodology that would always be effective.\nWe hold that the District did not commit a procedural viola-\ntion of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act by not\nspecifying teaching methodologies in K.L.’s individualized\neducational programs, and reverse the district court.\n\n   [11] In a similar vein, the District argues that the district\ncourt erred in concluding that the District committed a proce-\ndural violation by not specifying the minutes of instruction to\nbe devoted to each of K.L.’s services in her individualized\neducational programs. School districts need not specify min-\nutes of instruction if they are reasonably known to all “in-\nvolved in both the development and implementation of the\nIEP.” See 64 Fed. Reg. 12,479. Under the circumstances of\nthis case, we conclude that the amount of time to be devoted\nto K.L’s services was clearly known to K.L.’s individualized\neducational program team. Even if the minutes were not\nknown, however, Plaintiffs have failed to set forth a plausible\nargument that this procedural violation resulted in the denial\nof a free appropriate public education. Cf. O’Toole v. Olathe\nDist. Schs. Unified Sch., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"156357\"><a href=\"/opinion/156357/otoole-v-olathe-dist-schools/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">692</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 705-06 (10th Cir.\n1998) (holding that an individualized educational program\nthat merely provided for educational services “as appropriate”\ndid not result in the denial of a free appropriate public educa-\ntion). We hold that the District did not violate the Individuals\nwith Disabilities Education Act by not specifying minutes of\ninstruction in K.L.’s individualized educational program, and\nreverse the district court.\n\n                              VII\n\n  For the reasons discussed, we conclude that the district\ncourt erred in holding that the definition of a free appropriate\npublic education set forth by the Supreme Court in Rowley\n\f              J. L. v. MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT              10479\nhas been superseded, and accordingly, vacate its orders.11 In\naddition, we reverse the district court’s conclusions that the\nDistrict committed procedural violations of the Individuals\nwith Disabilities Education Act that resulted in the denial of\na free appropriate public education.\n\n   Because it is not clear whether our rulings dispose of all of\nK.L.’s claims, we remand this case to allow K.L. to pursue\nany such claims she may have asserted that are not deter-\nmined by our opinion. On remand, the district court must\nreview the ALJ’s determination that the District provided\nK.L. with a free appropriate public education pursuant to the\n“educational benefit” standard set forth in Rowley and reiter-\nated in this opinion. We deny the District’s request for a dif-\nferent judge on remand.\n\n REVERSED            in    part,    VACATED           in   part     and\nREMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n  11\n    Because the district court’s awards of reimbursement, related\nexpenses and attorneys’ fees were premised on its determination that the\nDistrict failed to provide K.L. with a free appropriate public education,\nvacation of that determination also vacates those awards.\n\f</pre>",
