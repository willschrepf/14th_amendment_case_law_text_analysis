OVERVIEW\n\n         The United States and intervenors Charles Ridley et al. (collectively \"Plaintiffs\") appeal from the\n\ndistrict court's order approving the Meriwether County Board of Education's (\"Board\") \"Five Year Facilities\n\nPlan\" (\"Plan\"). Plaintiffs contend that the district court applied the wrong legal standard in gauging the Plan\n\nand assert that the court's subsequent approval of the Plan constituted an abuse of discretion. For the reasons\n\nstated below, we disagree. Accordingly, we affirm.\n\n                               II. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n         The facts relevant to this appeal begin in 1988. The point of contention was the issue of a\n\nconsolidated high school for Meriwether County.1 Plaintiffs favored the construction of a consolidated\n\nschool, whereas the 1988 Board did not. In April of 1988, following the election of a new Board, the new\n\nBoard disavowed an earlier proposal adopted by the 1987 Board prior to the election that had promoted the\n\nconstruction of a consolidated high school. The Board's about face against consolidation was due to a shift\n\n\n\n\n   1\n    For a fuller account, please see United States v. Georgia, 19 F.3d 1388, 1390-91 (11th Cir.1994).\n\fin its political alignment—a majority of the board now opposed consolidation, whereas only months before\n\na majority had favored it.\n\n        More than a year later, in July 1989, the Board, having abandoned the consolidation model, formally\n\ndecided to adopt a new construction plan that would involve two high schools and that would be financed by\n\na bond issue. The bond issue was to be passed by referendum. Soon thereafter, on October 16, 1989, the\n\nPlaintiffs filed in district court, arguing that abandonment of the consolidation plan violated the 1973\n\ndesegregation order (\"1973 Order\").2 Accordingly, they sought, among other relief, an order from the district\n\ncourt mandating the pursuit of the earlier plan calling for the construction of a consolidated high school. As\n\na preliminary response to Plaintiffs' filing, the district court entered an order directing the State of Georgia\n\nto freeze state funds which had been previously been allocated to the Board for the construction of a\n\nconsolidated high school. The district court then set a bench trial for 1990.\n\n        At the conclusion of the bench trial in 1990, the district court declined to order that Meriwether\n\nCounty build a consolidated high school.3 The court did order the closing of one high school, Woodbury\n\n\n\n   2\n    A three-judge panel of the Northern District of Georgia entered the 1973 Order permanently\nenjoining Meriwether County, and several other counties, from taking any action \"which tends to\nsegregate students or faculty by or within schools on the basis of race, color or national origin.\" 1973\nOrder at 6. In outlining the school districts' desegregation obligations, the order also stated that: \"All\nschool construction, school consolidation and site selection (including the location of any temporary\nclassrooms) in the system shall be done in a manner which will prevent the reoccurrence of the dual\nschool structure.\" 1973 Order at 7.\n\n                The 1973 Order is the same order with respect to which an intervenor in a companion\n        case takes the position that the 1973 Order constituted a finding of \"unitary status.\" No such\n        argument is made in this case, but in any event, we reject that argument in the companion case in\n        a decision issued simultaneously with this decision. See United States v. Georgia, --- F.3d ----\n        (No. 97-9199, 11th Cir.1999).\n   3\n    Regarding the consolidation issue, Judge Robert L. Vining, Jr. stated:\n\n                 I will not make a decision in this case on the basis or having as one of its premises that\n                 one high school would be superior to two. I do not think that's for me to say. It may be\n                 that one high school would be superior to two, but I think the basis of my decision must\n                 be, or the standard must be, whether the plan as adopted and put into effect by the school\n                 board at my direction will ensure that a segregated system is not maintained or returned\n\n                                                       2\n\fHigh School, halted intra-district transfers (except majority-to-minority transfers) and halted new inter-district\n\ntransfers (except for students who lived within the Manchester city limits of Talbot County). Furthermore,\n\nthe court ordered equalization of the curriculum of all schools in the district and achievement of racial balance\n\nin teaching and staff assignments. Again, however, the court did not order consolidation. No appeal was\n\ntaken from this ruling.\n\n        In January 1993, the Board realigned itself, and again moved toward the construction of a\n\nconsolidated high school. At the request of all parties, on January 27, 1993, the district court ordered the\n\nState of Georgia to release the state funds that had been earmarked for the building of the consolidated high\n\nschool to Meriwether County. Nine days later, Coleman Bass4 and others opposed to consolidation filed a\n\nmotion to intervene, seeking to enjoin the distribution of the funds for consolidation. All parties to the\n\nlitigation opposed the intervention, and on March 2, 1993, the district court denied the intervention motion.5\n\n        On May 27, 1993, before the funds for construction had been released, however, the putative\n\nintervenors succeeded in enjoining the Board from pursuing the consolidation project by winning a temporary\n\nrestraining order from Fulton County Superior Court Judge William Daniel.6 The Board appealed the\n\ndecision to the Georgia Supreme Court, but that court dismissed the appeal on October 31, 1994. Meriwether\n\nCounty Board of Education v. Bass et al., Docket No. S95A0115 (Ga.1994). The Board then approached the\n\npopulace of Meriwether County for guidance, placing before it in a referendum the issue of closing the two\n\n\n\n                 to. I think that, broadly speaking, that has got to be the basis.\n\n        Transcript of Proceedings, May 31, 1990 Hearing at 98.\n   4\n    Coleman Bass was the former chairman of the Board who had opposed the original consolidation\nplan. See United States v. Georgia, 19 F.3d at 1392 n. 4 (commenting on Bass' former political position).\n   5\n    This court subsequently affirmed in United States v. Georgia, 19 F.3d 1388 (11th Cir.1994).\n   6\n    Judge Daniel enjoined the consolidation effort based on his view that O.C.G.A. § 20-2-260 had not\nbeen satisfied. That statute mandates, inter alia, that a school board hold at least two public hearings to\nprovide an opportunity for full discussion of a consolidation plan. See United States v. Georgia, 19 F.3d\nat 1392 n. 5 (discussing statute).\n\n                                                        3\n\fexisting high schools, Greenville and Manchester, and building a consolidated school. The voters rejected\n\nthe proposal on November 8, 1994.\n\n        Defeated yet again, the Board abandoned the consolidation effort and returned to developing a new\n\nfacilities plan using a two-high school model. After several modifications, the final version of the Plan was\n\nadopted by a unanimous Board.7 The Board submitted the Plan to the district court for approval on January\n\n23, 1996. The court approved. The United States and the intervenors (\"Plaintiffs\") did not sign on, however.\n\nThey filed objections to the Plan on March 22, 1996. The district court issued an opinion approving the Plan\n\non August 22, 1996, and disagreeing with the Plaintiffs that the Plan constituted a violation of the school\n\ndistrict's desegregation obligations. Plaintiffs now appeal that ruling.\n\n                                        III. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n         A district court's approval of a proposed facilities plan is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Harris\n\nv. Crenshaw County Bd. of Educ., 968 F.2d 1090, 1091 (11th Cir.1992). Its findings of fact are reviewed\n\nunder the clearly erroneous standard. Lee v. Anniston City Sch. Sys., 737 F.2d 952, 955 (11th Cir.1984)(citing\n\nRoss v. Houston Independent Sch. Dist., 699 F.2d 218, 226 (5th Cir.1983)).8\n\n                                               IV. DISCUSSION\n\n         At core, a federal court's obligation is to enforce the constitutional mandate \"[t]hat the duty and\n\nresponsibility of a school district once segregated by law is to take all steps necessary to eliminate the vestiges\n\nof the unconstitutional de jure system.\" Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 485, 112 S.Ct. 1430, 1443, 118\n\nL.Ed.2d 108 (1992). But while the court clearly has as its goal to remedy the underlying constitutional\n\nviolation, a federal court \"in devising a remedy must take into account the interest of state and local\n\n\n\n   7\n    The bond referendum to provide the financing for the construction called for under the Plan later\npassed in September 1996.\n   8\n    Plaintiffs do not argue that we should not apply the clearly erroneous standard with respect to the\nfindings of fact and the overall abuse of discretion standard. Rather, Plaintiffs argue only that the district\ncourt abused its discretion, and point to specific instances in which the district court allegedly applied an\nerroneous legal principle (which we address below).\n\n                                                        4\n\fauthorities in managing their own affairs, consistent with the Constitution.\" Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S.\n\n267, 280-81, 97 S.Ct. 2749, 2757-58, 53 L.Ed.2d 745 (1977); see also Freeman, 503 U.S. at 489, 112 S.Ct.\n\nat 1445 (\"We have said that the court's end purpose must be to remedy the violation and, in addition, to\n\nrestore state and local authorities to the control of a school system that is operating in compliance with the\n\nConstitution.\")(citing Milliken ). Indeed, this court has pointed out that \"[o]ne of the ultimate considerations\n\nin a desegregation case is that the basic administration of a school district, such as the number and location\n\nof schools, should be left to the political process.\" United States v. Georgia, 19 F.3d 1388, 1392 (11th\n\nCir.1994). Thus, while the school district has a continuing obligation \"to act in a manner that would prevent\n\na recurrence of the previous dual school system,\" Adams v. Board of Pub. Educ., 770 F.2d 1562, 1565 (11th\n\nCir.1985), it is a federal court's duty to recall, upon a showing of good faith by the school district that it has\n\ncomplied with the desegregation order to the extent practicable, that the \" 'school authorities have the primary\n\nresponsibility for elucidating, assessing and solving these problems.' \" Lee v. Anniston City Sch. Sys., 737\n\nF.2d 952, 955 (11th Cir.1984)(quoting Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. at 281, 97 S.Ct. at 2757). Against this\n\nbackdrop, we approach the narrow question presented here-whether the district court abused its discretion\n\nin approving the Board's Plan. Plaintiffs argue generally that the district court abused its discretion in\n\napproving the Plan, and they point to specific instances in which they contend that the district court applied\n\nerroneous legal principles. We address both in our discussion below.\n\n         First, we address Plaintiffs' argument that the district court employed the wrong legal standard by\n\nimproperly focusing solely on whether the Plan stemmed from any impermissible racial animus and by thus\n\nneglecting the school district's affirmative duty to remedy the effects of segregation. In sum, they assert that\n\nthe district court incorrectly based its stamp of approval on the faulty legal premise that any \"facilities plan\n\nis acceptable as long as it is not discriminatorily motivated.\" Brief of United States at 24. We do not believe\n\nthis fairly characterizes the district court's order.\n\n\n\n\n                                                        5\n\f        Rather than focusing exclusively on intentional discrimination, the district court merely discussed\n\nthe absence of evidence indicating that racial motives played any part in the Board's decisionmaking process.\n\nThis observation is certainly a relevant one under the law of this Circuit. See Adams v. Board of Public\n\nEduc., 770 F.2d 1562, 1566 (11th Cir.1985) (noting that plaintiffs failed to present any evidence that racial\n\nfactors played a part in board's decisionmaking process); Lee v. Anniston City Sch. Sys., 737 F.2d 952, 956-\n\n57 (11th Cir.1984)(discussing whether school closing was racially motivated and concluding it was not). The\n\ndistrict court considered the absence of racial animus as only one factor in its examination of the Plan, and\n\nhaving checked that factor off its list for lack of any supporting evidence, moved on to consider other\n\nfactors-such as the effects of the Plan. We cannot say this methodology was an abuse of a discretion.\n\n        Indeed, any plan that was motivated by discriminatory intent would certainly perpetuate the vestiges\n\nof discrimination and thus would not meet the school district's obligation under Freeman. By frontally\n\neliminating this possibility, the court was simply attacking the case from the ground up, and considering the\n\nmultifaceted inquiry that desegregation jurisprudence entails. We cannot fault the approach of looking first\n\nto motive and then to effects.\n\n         In addition to the lack of intentional discrimination, the court went on to consider five of the six\n\nfactors from Green v. County School Bd. of New Kent County, 391 U.S. 430, 437, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 1693, 20\n\nL.Ed.2d 716 (1968). The six Green factors are: student assignments, transportation, faculty, staff,\n\nextracurricular activities, and facilities. Id. By addressing the lion's share of these factors, the district court\n\napplied the proper legal standard articulated in Green, for the Green factors are the guideposts in a court's\n\ndetermination as to whether a proposed plan would eliminate the \"vestiges of de jure segregation ... as far as\n\npracticable.\" See Board of Educ. of Oklahoma City v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 250, 111 S.Ct. 630, 638, 112\n\nL.Ed.2d 715 (1991)(stating that courts should look to the Green factors in considering whether vestiges of\n\npast discrimination have been eliminated to the extent practicable). Therefore, we are satisfied that by\n\n\n\n\n                                                        6\n\ffollowing the directives of Green, the district court employed the proper legal standard in gauging the\n\nPlan-that is, whether the Plan eliminated the vestiges of prior de jure segregation to the extent practicable.\n\nA.       Student Assignments\n\n         One such vestige, indeed the hallmark of a dual system, is schools that are markedly identifiable in\n\nterms of race. Freeman, 503 U.S. at 487, 112 S.Ct. at 1443. The district court expressly addressed the\n\nPlaintiffs' concerns regarding racial identifiability with respect to student assignments on pages 6 and 7 of\n\nthe order, finding that, none of the schools were projected to have an enrollment that differed more than 20%\n\nfrom the district-wide ratio, and that the schools were not impermissibly racially identifiable. Order at 6-7.9\n\n         Plaintiffs now argue that the district court employed the 20% deviation figure as the universal legal\n\nbenchmark and that such a tactic constitutes an abuse of discretion. This argument misreads the district court\n\nopinion. The district court expressly acknowledged in its racial identifiability analysis \"that there is no magic\n\nstatistical number which can be utilized to determine whether schools are racially identifiable.\" Order at 7.\n\nThe court did go on to conclude, however, that a \" +/ratio of 20% is not enough in and of itself to warrant\n\nsuch identification.\" Order at 7. Other courts have also utilized such a 20% deviation figure. See, e.g.,\n\nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 476, 112 S.Ct. at 1438; Stell v. Board of Public Educ., 860 F.Supp. 1563, 1570-71\n\n(S.D.Ga.1994).\n\n         Plaintiffs' argument seems to suggest that because the enrollment percentages deviated by no more\n\nthan 20% from the district-wide average, that the district court closed its eyes to all of Plaintiffs' evidence\n\nregarding racial identifiability. This is simply not the case. The court considered Plaintiffs' arguments\n\nregarding community perceptions and past and current enrollments. There is ample evidence in the record\n\n\n\n\n     9\n     According to Defendants, once the Plan is implemented, of the system's seven schools, one will be\nclose to perfectly racially balanced (North Elementary); two schools will be within 10% of the\ncounty-wide ratio (North Middle and South Middle); two will be within 15% of the county-wide ratio\n(South Elementary and South High School); and two will be within 20% of the county-wide ratio (North\nHigh and Middle Elementary). None of the schools deviates by more than 20% from the county-wide\nratio of 65% black and 35% white.\n\n                                                       7\n\fto support the district court's finding with respect to lack of racial identifiability, and its conclusion in this\n\nregard was not clearly erroneous.\n\n        Plaintiffs would have us impose an obligation on the Meriwether County school district that is far\n\nstricter than the one announced by the Supreme Court in Freeman. The court clearly stated in Freeman:\n\n        That there was racial imbalance in student attendance zones was not tantamount to a showing that\n        the school district was in non-compliance with the decree or with its duties under the law. Racial\n        balance is not to be achieved for its own sake. It is to be pursued when racial imbalance has been\n        caused by a constitutional violation. Once the racial imbalance due to the de jure violation has been\n        remedied, the school district is under no duty to remedy imbalance that is caused by demographic\n        factors.\n\nId., 503 U.S. at 494, 112 S.Ct. at 1447.\n\n        Meriwether County's population center is located in the southern portion of the county and that\n\nportion contains a larger percentage of white residents than do the central and northern portions of the county.\n\nThus, it follows that the northern and central schools would have a higher percentage of black students than\n\nthose in the southern region. The district court found, however, that this is the result of the above stated\n\ndemographics and is not traceable to a prior de jure policy of segregation. We cannot conclude that this\n\nfinding is clearly erroneous. Plaintiffs concede as much by stating that \"[w]hile it may be true that the present\n\npopulation of the high schools as well as that of the elementary schools reflects residential patterns in the\n\ncounty, it is not written in stone that this relatively small county must be divided on a north-south axis for\n\nschool attendance purposes. Traveling from north to south and vice versa to attend school is not impossible.\"\n\nBrief of United States at 32.\n\n         Plaintiffs' contention ignores the teaching of Freeman that racial balance is not an end in itself.\n\nTherefore, while it is not \"impossible\" to dramatically alter the attendance zones, neither is it necessary under\n\nFreeman, so long as they are not vestiges of past discrimination. The law does not make a school district a\n\nprisoner based on factors, such as demographic tendencies, that are beyond its control. This is the clear\n\nimport of Freeman. See id. at 495, 112 S.Ct. at 1448 (noting that where racial imbalances spring not from\n\nstate action but from private choices the imbalances do not have constitutional implications). Once a court\n\n\n                                                        8\n\fsatisfies itself that the enrollment patterns are not the product of de jure segregation, as the district court did\n\nhere, the school district need not wage a battle against demographics to achieve perfect racial balance.\n\nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 494-95, 112 S.Ct. at 1447-48.\n\n        An important consideration in this context is the school district's good faith. Freeman, 503 U.S. at\n\n494, 112 S.Ct. at 1448; Lee, 737 F.2d at 956 (11th Cir.1984). Meriwether County has demonstrated its good\n\nfaith by pursuing a consolidated high school in 1993 and 1994, characterized by the Plaintiffs as the most\n\ndesegregative alternative, and arguing against the intervention of those who opposed consolidation in United\n\nStates v. Georgia. Having lost the fight for consolidation10 in state court, and at the polls, and recognizing\n\nthat the entire school system was in need of significant repair, the Board decided to pursue a course that was\n\nthe most practicable and the most beneficial to the most schools in the county.11 We are persuaded that the\n\nBoard did arrive at the current Plan in a good faith attempt to comply with its desegregation obligations to\n\nthe most practicable extent.\n\n        Another important consideration is what this court has referred to as \"the limits of practicalities such\n\nas funding and transportation.\" Lee, 737 F.2d at 957. Meriwether County has encountered severe difficulty\n\nin recent years in passing bond referenda to finance school construction projects. In fact, not one succeeded\n\nuntil September 199612-the one approving funding for the Plan currently challenged by Plaintiffs. Yet\n\n\n   10\n     The issue of a consolidated high school, vel non, was also fully litigated before Judge Vining, and in\n1990 Judge Vining held that a consolidated high school was not constitutionally required. See supra note\n3. Plaintiffs do not ask us to revisit that ruling.\n   11\n     Phase 1 of the Plan proposes the construction of three new buildings: a new North Elementary\nSchool (to house the student populations of Luthersville Elementary and McCrary Elementary); a new\nNorth High School (to house students who previously attended Greenville High School); and a new\nSouth Elementary School (to house the current students of Warm Springs Elementary and Manchester\nElementary). It is worth noting that each section of the county will receive a new building under Phase 1\nof the Plan, including the northern regions of the county, which have the larger percentage of black\nstudents.\n   12\n     Notably, the Plan received the unanimous approval of the Board before it was sent before the county\nin the 1996 referendum. This unanimity was no doubt instrumental in the Plan's ultimate success in the\nreferendum. Defendants assert that this unanimity was achieved for three reasons: (1) the Plan did not\n\n                                                        9\n\fPlaintiffs would have us set aside this success, because, in their eyes, a Plan could be adopted that would\n\nachieve more perfect racial balance.13 As noted above, there was no obligation in Freeman to remedy\n\nimbalances that are a function of demographics; the circumstances are similar here, and there is likewise no\n\nsuch obligation here. The district court must view the Plan by the standard that it must eliminate the vestiges\n\nof the prior unconstitutional system to the extent practicable. Freeman, 503 U.S. at 492, 112 S.Ct. at 1446.\n\nDramatically altering attendance zones, when not constitutionally required, and demonstrably politically\n\nunpopular,14 is not a necessary path to take. Accord Lee, 737 F.2d at 956 (rejecting the plaintiffs' argument\n\n\n\nalter the attendance zones which had been in place (excepting the adjustments made after the closing of\nWoodbury High School in 1990) since the 1973 Order; (2) the Plan identified the three schools in the\nmost need of replacement: Greenville High School, Luthersville Elementary, and Warm Springs\nElementary; and (3) the Plan would provide Manchester-the population hub of the county-with a new\nfacility, thereby increasing the chance of a successful bond referendum. These reasons do not violate the\nconstitutional mandate of Freeman. Indeed, they seem to fall comfortably within it and embody precisely\nthe sort of local political decisionmaking that is essential to \"the basic administration of a school district.\"\nUnited States v. Georgia, 19 F.3d at 1392.\n   13\n     Plaintiffs' suggested alternatives mask their real desire to have a consolidated high school. As\npreviously noted, the district court refused to order consolidation after a bench trial in 1990, and a\nconsolidation proposal was defeated by Meriwether County voters in 1994.\n   14\n      As mentioned above, altering the school attendance zones would have been unpopular and would\nhave produced divisiveness among the Board members and in the community, thereby tainting the\nlikelihood of a successful bond referendum and dashing with it the hope of financing any new school\nconstruction. Plaintiff's expert, Dr. Gordon, who advocated such alterations to achieve a better racial\nbalance, admittedly did not consider such a practical sentiment in the course of his evaluation. Gordon\nDeposition at 134. Much more in keeping with the proper balance of practicality and a school board's\naffirmative obligation to move forward with projects without perpetuating the dual system is the poignant\ntestimony of the Chairman of the School Board, Mr. Hicks. Though a long proponent of consolidation,\nHicks recognized that the Plan represented a sensible, yet hard-won political compromise by which all\nraces benefitted:\n\n                          I think the first priority there's never any question, everybody on the board\n                 unanimously from day one has always known [that] Luthersville/McCrary is our biggest\n                 need ... [T]he board members from the south and the north have consistently, said, if we\n                 don't do anything else, that elementary will be built. So that was the first priority under\n                 anybody's plan ... The [Greenville] high school had to be the second priority to get a plan\n                 period. To get unanimous board approval, the high school had to be the second priority.\n                 That was the way the plan developed. For the folks to salvage something from this ten\n                 years [of litigation], that high school had to be the second priority. So then it just comes\n                 down to how much you're talking about. If you're talking twelve million dollars or a\n\n                                                      10\n\ffavoring a plan for the purpose of achieving even greater desegregation under circumstances similar to those\n\nin the instant case). All parties agree that the schools in Meriwether County are in poor condition and\n\ncontinue to deteriorate. Where, as here, there is no evidence of intentional discrimination and the Plan is\n\nconsistent with the obligation to eliminate any vestiges of past de jure segregation to the extent practicable,\n\nwe agree with the district court that the economically feasible Plan which has already been approved by the\n\nvoters of Meriwether County is constitutionally acceptable, and is consistent with the preexisting court\n\ndecrees.\n\nB.         Transportation\n\n           The district court also found in response to Plaintiffs' objections to the Plan's effects on transportation\n\nthat any transportation \"disruption(s)\" would stem from demographic factors and not a constitutionally\n\nsuspect scheme of segregation.15 In so finding, the court was deducing from Freeman, 503 U.S. at 467, 112\n\nS.Ct. at 1430, that because racial imbalances in attendance zones resulting from demographics and not prior\n\nde jure segregation are not unconstitutional, then disproportionate transportation burdens stemming from\n\ndemographic sources are likewise not unconstitutional. Again, it is undisputed that Meriwether County's\n\npopulation center is in its southern region and that more of the white population resides in this section of the\n\n\n\n\n                   limited amount of money, there's only one more project and Warm Springs is the oldest\n                   elementary school we have in the county. It's the oldest physical facility we have in the\n                   county. Greenville and Woodbury have been—are in much better physical shape than\n                   the Warm Springs one is and if you want to go back and look, the oldest renovated\n                   elementary we have in the county, the last time renovations were done to any of them, the\n                   oldest one is Manchester ... To pass this bond referendum, we have got to have the\n                   support in the south part of the county [the population center]. You're not going to pass\n                   the bond referendum without support in the south part of the county.\n\n           Hicks Deposition at 75-76.\n     15\n     As the district court pointed out, because there are no pupil locator maps cataloging students by race\nand residence, it is difficult, if not impossible, to make accurate predictions concerning the changes in\ntravel times and distances under the Plan. Thus, there is no actual evidence in the record that there will be\nsuch disproportion. However, the district court assumed arguendo in its evaluation of the Plan that black\nstudents in the central and northern areas of the county would be disproportionately burdened.\n\n                                                          11\n\fcounty than the central or northern sections of the county. Consequently, the fact that white students may\n\nbe somewhat less burdened by the transportation scheme is a function of demographics and not a\n\nconstitutional violation. In light of Freeman, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred in so finding.\n\nC.      Faculty/Staff Assignments and Extracurricular Activities\n\n         The district court expressly refers to faculty and staff assignments in its order, but concludes\n\n\"because no assignments have been made and because faculty and administrators can change from year to\n\nyear, this court is unwilling to assume an improper assignment of faculty or administrators based upon the\n\nspeculations of Dr. Gordon, the government, and intervenors.\" Order at 8. Therefore, the court decided \"the\n\nmore prudent approach is to wait and see what changes are actually made and then decide whether those\n\nchanges were improper.\" Id. None of the briefs to this Court address the matter and Plaintiffs' briefs to the\n\ndistrict court are not particularly helpful either, citing only general concerns that the Plan will result in excess\n\nfaculty and that the Plan will not address the racial identifiability of faculty and administrator assignments.\n\nDefendants respond by arguing that it is premature to criticize the assignments before they have been made.\n\nEspecially in light of the lack of adversarial development with respect to faculty and staff assignments, we\n\nfind the \"wait and see\" approach of the district court is not an abuse of discretion. With respect to\n\nextracurricular activities, there was no mention of this Green factor, in the briefs to our Court or in the briefs\n\nto the district court. We assume that the district court also took a \"wait and see\" approach with respect to this\n\nfactor, as it did with the faculty/staff assignment factor, and we find no abuse of discretion.\n\nD.      Facilities\n\n        With respect to the facilities called for under the Plan, Plaintiffs make several objections. First, they\n\nobject to the construction priorities in the overall Plan. Under Phase 1, two new consolidated elementary\n\nschools would be built: a new North Elementary School, combining the populations of Luthersville and\n\nMcCrary school, and a new South Central Elementary, combining the populations of Manchester Elementary\n\n\n\n\n                                                        12\n\fand Warm Springs. Finally, a new high school was planned for the Greenville area.16 Plaintiffs contend that\n\nPhase 1 of the Plan results in \"putting white children first [because it] is easier to sell to the citizenry that must\n\nvote for the bond issue.\"17 Brief of United States at 33. This argument is without merit.\n\n         Two out of the three new structures proposed by the Plan would benefit student populations which\n\nwould be predominantly black. The new North Elementary School is projected to be 62% black and 37%\n\nwhite and replaces Luthersville Elementary and McCrary Elementary, which were 55% and 88% black,\n\nrespectively. The new Greenville High School is projected to be 80% black, replacing the current Greenville\n\nHigh School which is 79% black. The only new facility included as part of Phase 1 that is projected to be\n\nmajority white is the new South Elementary, which will be 50% white and 49% black. We fail to see how\n\nreplacing two predominantly black schools puts white children first.\n\n\n\n\n   16\n      Phase 1 of the Plan is projected to cost around $19 million, with $6 million coming from an\nallocation of state funds, and $13 million to come from the successful September 1996 bond issue. Phase\n2 of the Plan is projected to cost around $8.5 million. Phase 2 entails building a new Central Elementary\nSchool, combining the populations of Greenville and Woodbury Elementary Schools, renovating the\nformer Greenville High School to transform it into a true middle school, and renovating Manchester\nMiddle and High Schools. Plaintiffs vigorously objected in the district court to Phase 1 of the Plan on the\nground that the Board could never successfully pass the bond issue necessary to begin Phase 1\nconstruction. Given the referendum's subsequent success, that argument is obviously moot. Now\nPlaintiffs assert, as they did regarding Phase 1, that the funding for Phase 2 is speculative at best and may\nnever be locked into place. Because the Board has demonstrated its good faith in steering this Plan\nthrough the treacherous course of litigation and public debate, we are hesitant to assume that Phase 2 will\nnever be pursued. The Board has already accomplished more than Plaintiffs ever thought it could by\nsuccessfully securing financing for Phase 1. Consequently, we will not assume that Phase 2 will fail\nbefore it has even had the opportunity to be pursued in good faith. If it becomes clear the Board has no\nintention of pursuing Phase 2, the Plaintiffs may petition the district court for relief at that juncture.\n   17\n     Rather than include the new South Elementary School as part of Phase 1, Plaintiffs contend that a\nnew Central Elementary School ought to be built as part of Phase 1. Central Elementary will combine the\npresent populations of Greenville and Woodbury Elementary Schools. However, this would do nothing\nto redress the severe overcrowding at Warm Springs Elementary, where many of the students must attend\nclass in portable units. Under the current Plan, a new South Elementary would be built, thus remedying\nthe poor conditions at Warm Springs; and a new North Meriwether High school would be built to replace\nGreenville High School, thus allowing students of middle school age from Greenville Elementary to\nmove into the former Greenville High School facility. Under the Board's Plan, no students would have to\nattend school in overcrowded portable units, whereas under Plaintiffs' proposed course, the unfortunate\ncircumstances at Warm Springs would persist.\n\n                                                         13\n\f        We refer again to the helpful comments of Mr. Hicks, supra note 14, which indicate that the\n\nconstruction priorities were determined on the basis of need, not race, with a watchful eye on what was\n\npracticable. The southern elementary schools were the oldest in the county, and in worse physical shape than\n\nthe substitute project suggested by Plaintiffs. We do not believe it was unreasonable for the Board to include\n\nthe South Elementary School project in Phase 1. Nor was it unreasonable18 for the Board to consider the fact\n\nthat it would enhance the chances of passage of the bond issue for Phase 1 to include a fair allocation of\n\nresources to the southern portion of the county, the population center of the county. As Mr. Hicks noted, the\n\nbond issue (and thus the construction of the two predominantly black schools) was likely to fail without a fair\n\nallocation for the southern population center. We reject Plaintiffs' argument that this well-discussed and\n\nwell-bargained political compromise runs afoul of the constitutional guideposts set out in Green. Indeed, it\n\nis Green that counsels us to recall \"[t]hat the burden on a school board today is to come forward with a plan\n\nthat promises realistically to work, and promises realistically to work now.\" Green, 391 U.S. at 439, 88 S.Ct.\n\nat 1694. We agree with the district court that the Board, after twelve years of debate, has produced a Plan\n\nthat honors its desegregation obligations under the 1973 Order and under the case law, and successfully\n\nincorporates a bond issue for Phase 1 construction which has already passed.\n\n        Plaintiffs also object to the physical plant of the proposed new North Meriwether High School.\n\nSpecifically, they allege that the new high school, though technologically superior, will lack important\n\nfeatures that the old Greenville High School possesses, such as a ballfield and an auditorium. The Board\n\ncounters that the architectural plans it presented to the district court demonstrate the presence of both a\n\ngymnasium and a cafetorium.19 Thus, the only feature that the new North Meriwether County High School\n\nwould lack is a ballfield with stadium seating. The Board provides a reasonable explanation for this absence:\n\n\n\n   18\n     The district court's finding that these decisions were reasonable and the finding that these decisions\nreflected no racial discrimination have ample support in the record.\n   19\n     Apparently, a \"cafetorium\" employs a multipurpose design, incorporating auditorium features, and\nfunctions as both a cafeteria and, when appropriate, as an auditorium.\n\n                                                      14\n\fthe field at the former Greenville high school can be utilized until a new one can be financed. In any event,\n\nwe find that the Plaintiffs' argument in this regard fails to demonstrate the sort of constitutional transgression\n\nforbidden under Green and its progeny.\n\n                                              V. CONCLUSION\n\n        Having carefully considered the district court's order, the Board's Plan, the Plaintiffs' objections to\n\nboth, and the school district's response thereto, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion\n\nin approving the Board's Plan. We agree with the judgment of the district court that the Meriwether County\n\nSchool Board in pursuing its proposed Facilities Plan district has complied with the constitutional mandate\n\nof Green to the extent practicable. Accordingly, we hold that the school district has addressed the significant\n\nand unquestioned needs of its antiquated system, while striking the proper balance between its desegregation\n\nobligations and its obligation to the citizens of Meriwether County to come forward with a realistic plan that\n\npromises to work, and to work now. We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\napproving the Plan; the Plan is consistent with the Board's desegregation obligations under the previous\n\norders and with the relevant case law outlining the Board's constitutional obligations.\n\n        The judgment of the district court approving the Plan is therefore AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       15\n\f",

OVERVIEW\n\n         The United States and intervenors Charles Ridley et al. (collectively \"Plaintiffs\") appeal from the\n\ndistrict court's order approving the Meriwether County Board of Education's (\"Board\") \"Five Year Facilities\n\nPlan\" (\"Plan\").

For the reasons\n\nstated below, we disagree. Accordingly, we affirm.\n\n                               II. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n         The facts relevant to this appeal begin in 1988. The point of contention was the issue of a\n\nconsolidated high school for Meriwether County.1 Plaintiffs favored the construction of a consolidated\n\nschool, whereas the 1988 Board did not. In April of 1988, following the election of a new Board, the new\n\nBoard disavowed an earlier proposal adopted by the 1987 Board prior to the election that had promoted the\n\nconstruction of a consolidated high school. The Board's about face against consolidation was due to a shift\n\n\n\n\n   1\n    For a fuller account, please see United States v. Georgia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"666061\"><a href=\"/opinion/666061/united-states-of-america-richmond-hill-brenda-phillips-jennye-hardaway/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1388</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1390-91 (11th Cir.1994).\n\fin its political alignment—a majority of the board now opposed consolidation, whereas only months before\n\na majority had favored it.\n\n        More than a year later, in July 1989, the Board, having abandoned the consolidation model, formally\n\ndecided to adopt a new construction plan that would involve two high schools and that would be financed by\n\na bond issue. The bond issue was to be passed by referendum. Soon thereafter, on October 16, 1989, the\n\nPlaintiffs filed in district court, arguing that abandonment of the consolidation plan violated the 1973\n\ndesegregation order (\"1973 Order\").2 Accordingly, they sought, among other relief, an order from the district\n\ncourt mandating the pursuit of the earlier plan calling for the construction of a consolidated high school. As\n\na preliminary response to Plaintiffs' filing, the district court entered an order directing the State of Georgia\n\nto freeze state funds which had been previously been allocated to the Board for the construction of a\n\nconsolidated high school. The district court then set a bench trial for 1990.\n\n        At the conclusion of the bench trial in 1990, the district court declined to order that Meriwether\n\nCounty build a consolidated high school.3 The court did order the closing of one high school, Woodbury\n\n\n\n   2\n    A three-judge panel of the Northern District of Georgia entered the 1973 Order permanently\nenjoining Meriwether County, and several other counties, from taking any action \"which tends to\nsegregate students or faculty by or within schools on the basis of race, color or national origin.\" 1973\nOrder at 6. In outlining the school districts' desegregation obligations, the order also stated that: \"All\nschool construction, school consolidation and site selection (including the location of any temporary\nclassrooms) in the system shall be done in a manner which will prevent the reoccurrence of the dual\nschool structure.\" 1973 Order at 7.\n\n                The 1973 Order is the same order with respect to which an intervenor in a companion\n        case takes the position that the 1973 Order constituted a finding of \"unitary status.\" No such\n        argument is made in this case, but in any event, we reject that argument in the companion case in\n        a decision issued simultaneously with this decision. See United States v. Georgia, --- F.3d ----\n        (No. 97-9199, 11th Cir.1999).\n   3\n    Regarding the consolidation issue, Judge Robert L. Vining, Jr. stated:\n\n                 I will not make a decision in this case on the basis or having as one of its premises that\n                 one high school would be superior to two. I do not think that's for me to say. It may be\n                 that one high school would be superior to two, but I think the basis of my decision must\n                 be, or the standard must be, whether the plan as adopted and put into effect by the school\n                 board at my direction will ensure that a segregated system is not maintained or returned\n\n                                                       2\n\fHigh School, halted intra-district transfers (except majority-to-minority transfers) and halted new inter-district\n\ntransfers (except for students who lived within the Manchester city limits of Talbot County). Furthermore,\n\nthe court ordered equalization of the curriculum of all schools in the district and achievement of racial balance\n\nin teaching and staff assignments. Again, however, the court did not order consolidation. No appeal was\n\ntaken from this ruling.\n\n        In January 1993, the Board realigned itself, and again moved toward the construction of a\n\nconsolidated high school. At the request of all parties, on January 27, 1993, the district court ordered the\n\nState of Georgia to release the state funds that had been earmarked for the building of the consolidated high\n\nschool to Meriwether County. Nine days later, Coleman Bass4 and others opposed to consolidation filed a\n\nmotion to intervene, seeking to enjoin the distribution of the funds for consolidation. All parties to the\n\nlitigation opposed the intervention, and on March 2, 1993, the district court denied the intervention motion.5\n\n        On May 27, 1993, before the funds for construction had been released, however, the putative\n\nintervenors succeeded in enjoining the Board from pursuing the consolidation project by winning a temporary\n\nrestraining order from Fulton County Superior Court Judge William Daniel.6 The Board appealed the\n\ndecision to the Georgia Supreme Court, but that court dismissed the appeal on October 31, 1994. Meriwether\n\nCounty Board of Education v. Bass et al., Docket No. S95A0115 (Ga.1994). The Board then approached the\n\npopulace of Meriwether County for guidance, placing before it in a referendum the issue of closing the two\n\n\n\n                 to. I think that, broadly speaking, that has got to be the basis.\n\n        Transcript of Proceedings, May 31, 1990 Hearing at 98.\n   4\n    Coleman Bass was the former chairman of the Board who had opposed the original consolidation\nplan. See United States v. Georgia, 19 F.3d at 1392 n. 4 (commenting on Bass' former political position).\n   5\n    This court subsequently affirmed in United States v. Georgia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"666061\"><a href=\"/opinion/666061/united-states-of-america-richmond-hill-brenda-phillips-jennye-hardaway/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1388</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir.1994).\n   6\n    Judge Daniel enjoined the consolidation effort based on his view that O.C.G.A. § 20-2-260 had not\nbeen satisfied. That statute mandates, inter alia, that a school board hold at least two public hearings to\nprovide an opportunity for full discussion of a consolidation plan. See United States v. Georgia, 19 F.3d\nat 1392 n. 5 (discussing statute).\n\n                                                        3\n\fexisting high schools, Greenville and Manchester, and building a consolidated school. The voters rejected\n\nthe proposal on November 8, 1994.\n\n        Defeated yet again, the Board abandoned the consolidation effort and returned to developing a new\n\nfacilities plan using a two-high school model. After several modifications, the final version of the Plan was\n\nadopted by a unanimous Board.7 The Board submitted the Plan to the district court for approval on January\n\n23, 1996. The court approved. The United States and the intervenors (\"Plaintiffs\") did not sign on, however.\n\nThey filed objections to the Plan on March 22, 1996.

Against this\n\nbackdrop, we approach the narrow question presented here-whether the district court abused its discretion\n\nin approving the Board's Plan. Plaintiffs argue generally that the district court abused its discretion in\n\napproving the Plan, and they point to specific instances in which they contend that the district court applied\n\nerroneous legal principles. We address both in our discussion below.\n\n         First, we address Plaintiffs' argument that the district court employed the wrong legal standard by\n\nimproperly focusing solely on whether the Plan stemmed from any impermissible racial animus and by thus\n\nneglecting the school district's affirmative duty to remedy the effects of segregation. In sum, they assert that\n\nthe district court incorrectly based its stamp of approval on the faulty legal premise that any \"facilities plan\n\nis acceptable as long as it is not discriminatorily motivated.\" Brief of United States at 24. We do not believe\n\nthis fairly characterizes the district court's order.\n\n\n\n\n                                                        5\n\f        Rather than focusing exclusively on intentional discrimination, the district court merely discussed\n\nthe absence of evidence indicating that racial motives played any part in the Board's decisionmaking process.\n\nThis observation is certainly a relevant one under the law of this Circuit. See Adams v. Board of Public\n\nEduc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"457593\"><a href=\"/opinion/457593/julius-c-adams-v-the-board-of-public-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">770</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1562</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1566 (11th Cir.1985) (noting that plaintiffs failed to present any evidence that racial\n\nfactors played a part in board's decisionmaking process); Lee v.

The\n\ndistrict court considered the absence of racial animus as only one factor in its examination of the Plan, and\n\nhaving checked that factor off its list for lack of any supporting evidence, moved on to consider other\n\nfactors-such as the effects of the Plan. We cannot say this methodology was an abuse of a discretion.\n\n        Indeed, any plan that was motivated by discriminatory intent would certainly perpetuate the vestiges\n\nof discrimination and thus would not meet the school district's obligation under Freeman. By frontally\n\neliminating this possibility, the court was simply attacking the case from the ground up, and considering the\n\nmultifaceted inquiry that desegregation jurisprudence entails. We cannot fault the approach of looking first\n\nto motive and then to effects.\n\n         In addition to the lack of intentional discrimination, the court went on to consider five of the six\n\nfactors from Green v. County School Bd. of New Kent County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107705\"><a href=\"/opinion/107705/green-v-county-school-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 437, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107705\"><a href=\"/opinion/107705/green-v-county-school-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The six Green factors are: student assignments, transportation, faculty, staff,\n\nextracurricular activities, and facilities. Id. By addressing the lion's share of these factors, the district court\n\napplied the proper legal standard articulated in Green, for the Green factors are the guideposts in a court's\n\ndetermination as to whether a proposed plan would eliminate the \"vestiges of de jure segregation ... as far as\n\npracticable.\" See Board of Educ. of Oklahoma City v.

Therefore, we are satisfied that by\n\n\n\n\n                                                        6\n\ffollowing the directives of Green, the district court employed the proper legal standard in gauging the\n\nPlan-that is, whether the Plan eliminated the vestiges of prior de jure segregation to the extent practicable.\n\nA.       Student Assignments\n\n         One such vestige, indeed the hallmark of a dual system, is schools that are markedly identifiable in\n\nterms of race. Freeman, 503 U.S. at 487, 112 S.Ct. at 1443. The district court expressly addressed the\n\nPlaintiffs' concerns regarding racial identifiability with respect to student assignments on pages 6 and 7 of\n\nthe order, finding that, none of the schools were projected to have an enrollment that differed more than 20%\n\nfrom the district-wide ratio, and that the schools were not impermissibly racially identifiable. Order at 6-7.9\n\n         Plaintiffs now argue that the district court employed the 20% deviation figure as the universal legal\n\nbenchmark and that such a tactic constitutes an abuse of discretion. This argument misreads the district court\n\nopinion. The district court expressly acknowledged in its racial identifiability analysis \"that there is no magic\n\nstatistical number which can be utilized to determine whether schools are racially identifiable.\" Order at 7.\n\nThe court did go on to conclude, however, that a \" +/ratio of 20% is not enough in and of itself to warrant\n\nsuch identification.\" Order at 7. Other courts have also utilized such a 20% deviation figure. See, e.g.,\n\nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 476, 112 S.Ct. at 1438; Stell v. Board of Public Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">860</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1563</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1570-71\n\n(S.D.Ga.1994).\n\n         Plaintiffs' argument seems to suggest that because the enrollment percentages deviated by no more\n\nthan 20% from the district-wide average, that the district court closed its eyes to all of Plaintiffs' evidence\n\nregarding racial identifiability. This is simply not the case. The court considered Plaintiffs' arguments\n\nregarding community perceptions and past and current enrollments. There is ample evidence in the record\n\n\n\n\n     9\n     According to Defendants, once the Plan is implemented, of the system's seven schools, one will be\nclose to perfectly racially balanced (North Elementary); two schools will be within 10% of the\ncounty-wide ratio (North Middle and South Middle); two will be within 15% of the county-wide ratio\n(South Elementary and South High School); and two will be within 20% of the county-wide ratio (North\nHigh and Middle Elementary). None of the schools deviates by more than 20% from the county-wide\nratio of 65% black and 35% white.\n\n                                                       7\n\fto support the district court's finding with respect to lack of racial identifiability, and its conclusion in this\n\nregard was not clearly erroneous.\n\n        Plaintiffs would have us impose an obligation on the Meriwether County school district that is far\n\nstricter than the one announced by the Supreme Court in Freeman. The court clearly stated in Freeman:\n\n        That there was racial imbalance in student attendance zones was not tantamount to a showing that\n        the school district was in non-compliance with the decree or with its duties under the law. Racial\n        balance is not to be achieved for its own sake. It is to be pursued when racial imbalance has been\n        caused by a constitutional violation. Once the racial imbalance due to the de jure violation has been\n        remedied, the school district is under no duty to remedy imbalance that is caused by demographic\n        factors.\n\nId., 503 U.S. at 494, 112 S.Ct. at 1447.\n\n        Meriwether County's population center is located in the southern portion of the county and that\n\nportion contains a larger percentage of white residents than do the central and northern portions of the county.\n\nThus, it follows that the northern and central schools would have a higher percentage of black students than\n\nthose in the southern region. The district court found, however, that this is the result of the above stated\n\ndemographics and is not traceable to a prior de jure policy of segregation. We cannot conclude that this\n\nfinding is clearly erroneous. Plaintiffs concede as much by stating that \"[w]hile it may be true that the present\n\npopulation of the high schools as well as that of the elementary schools reflects residential patterns in the\n\ncounty, it is not written in stone that this relatively small county must be divided on a north-south axis for\n\nschool attendance purposes. Traveling from north to south and vice versa to attend school is not impossible.\"\n\nBrief of United States at 32.\n\n         Plaintiffs' contention ignores the teaching of Freeman that racial balance is not an end in itself.\n\nTherefore, while it is not \"impossible\" to dramatically alter the attendance zones, neither is it necessary under\n\nFreeman, so long as they are not vestiges of past discrimination. The law does not make a school district a\n\nprisoner based on factors, such as demographic tendencies, that are beyond its control. This is the clear\n\nimport of Freeman. See id. at 495, 112 S.Ct. at 1448 (noting that where racial imbalances spring not from\n\nstate action but from private choices the imbalances do not have constitutional implications). Once a court\n\n\n                                                        8\n\fsatisfies itself that the enrollment patterns are not the product of de jure segregation, as the district court did\n\nhere, the school district need not wage a battle against demographics to achieve perfect racial balance.\n\nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 494-95, 112 S.Ct. at 1447-48.\n\n        An important consideration in this context is the school district's good faith. Freeman, 503 U.S. at\n\n494, 112 S.Ct. at 1448; Lee, 737 F.2d at 956 (11th Cir.1984). Meriwether County has demonstrated its good\n\nfaith by pursuing a consolidated high school in 1993 and 1994, characterized by the Plaintiffs as the most\n\ndesegregative alternative, and arguing against the intervention of those who opposed consolidation in United\n\nStates v. Georgia. Having lost the fight for consolidation10 in state court, and at the polls, and recognizing\n\nthat the entire school system was in need of significant repair, the Board decided to pursue a course that was\n\nthe most practicable and the most beneficial to the most schools in the county.11 We are persuaded that the\n\nBoard did arrive at the current Plan in a good faith attempt to comply with its desegregation obligations to\n\nthe most practicable extent.\n\n        Another important consideration is what this court has referred to as \"the limits of practicalities such\n\nas funding and transportation.\" Lee, 737 F.2d at 957. Meriwether County has encountered severe difficulty\n\nin recent years in passing bond referenda to finance school construction projects. In fact, not one succeeded\n\nuntil September 199612-the one approving funding for the Plan currently challenged by Plaintiffs. Yet\n\n\n   10\n     The issue of a consolidated high school, vel non, was also fully litigated before Judge Vining, and in\n1990 Judge Vining held that a consolidated high school was not constitutionally required. See supra note\n3. Plaintiffs do not ask us to revisit that ruling.\n   11\n     Phase 1 of the Plan proposes the construction of three new buildings: a new North Elementary\nSchool (to house the student populations of Luthersville Elementary and McCrary Elementary); a new\nNorth High School (to house students who previously attended Greenville High School); and a new\nSouth Elementary School (to house the current students of Warm Springs Elementary and Manchester\nElementary). It is worth noting that each section of the county will receive a new building under Phase 1\nof the Plan, including the northern regions of the county, which have the larger percentage of black\nstudents.\n   12\n     Notably, the Plan received the unanimous approval of the Board before it was sent before the county\nin the 1996 referendum. This unanimity was no doubt instrumental in the Plan's ultimate success in the\nreferendum. Defendants assert that this unanimity was achieved for three reasons: (1) the Plan did not\n\n                                                        9\n\fPlaintiffs would have us set aside this success, because, in their eyes, a Plan could be adopted that would\n\nachieve more perfect racial balance.13 As noted above, there was no obligation in Freeman to remedy\n\nimbalances that are a function of demographics; the circumstances are similar here, and there is likewise no\n\nsuch obligation here. The district court must view the Plan by the standard that it must eliminate the vestiges\n\nof the prior unconstitutional system to the extent practicable. Freeman, 503 U.S. at 492, 112 S.Ct. at 1446.\n\nDramatically altering attendance zones, when not constitutionally required, and demonstrably politically\n\nunpopular,14 is not a necessary path to take. Accord Lee, 737 F.2d at 956 (rejecting the plaintiffs' argument\n\n\n\nalter the attendance zones which had been in place (excepting the adjustments made after the closing of\nWoodbury High School in 1990) since the 1973 Order; (2) the Plan identified the three schools in the\nmost need of replacement: Greenville High School, Luthersville Elementary, and Warm Springs\nElementary; and (3) the Plan would provide Manchester-the population hub of the county-with a new\nfacility, thereby increasing the chance of a successful bond referendum. These reasons do not violate the\nconstitutional mandate of Freeman. Indeed, they seem to fall comfortably within it and embody precisely\nthe sort of local political decisionmaking that is essential to \"the basic administration of a school district.\"\nUnited States v. Georgia, 19 F.3d at 1392.\n   13\n     Plaintiffs' suggested alternatives mask their real desire to have a consolidated high school. As\npreviously noted, the district court refused to order consolidation after a bench trial in 1990, and a\nconsolidation proposal was defeated by Meriwether County voters in 1994.\n   14\n      As mentioned above, altering the school attendance zones would have been unpopular and would\nhave produced divisiveness among the Board members and in the community, thereby tainting the\nlikelihood of a successful bond referendum and dashing with it the hope of financing any new school\nconstruction. Plaintiff's expert, Dr. Gordon, who advocated such alterations to achieve a better racial\nbalance, admittedly did not consider such a practical sentiment in the course of his evaluation. Gordon\nDeposition at 134. Much more in keeping with the proper balance of practicality and a school board's\naffirmative obligation to move forward with projects without perpetuating the dual system is the poignant\ntestimony of the Chairman of the School Board, Mr. Hicks. Though a long proponent of consolidation,\nHicks recognized that the Plan represented a sensible, yet hard-won political compromise by which all\nraces benefitted:\n\n                          I think the first priority there's never any question, everybody on the board\n                 unanimously from day one has always known [that] Luthersville/McCrary is our biggest\n                 need ... [T]he board members from the south and the north have consistently, said, if we\n                 don't do anything else, that elementary will be built. So that was the first priority under\n                 anybody's plan ... The [Greenville] high school had to be the second priority to get a plan\n                 period. To get unanimous board approval, the high school had to be the second priority.\n                 That was the way the plan developed. For the folks to salvage something from this ten\n                 years [of litigation], that high school had to be the second priority. So then it just comes\n                 down to how much you're talking about. If you're talking twelve million dollars or a\n\n                                                      10\n\ffavoring a plan for the purpose of achieving even greater desegregation under circumstances similar to those\n\nin the instant case). All parties agree that the schools in Meriwether County are in poor condition and\n\ncontinue to deteriorate. Where, as here, there is no evidence of intentional discrimination and the Plan is\n\nconsistent with the obligation to eliminate any vestiges of past de jure segregation to the extent practicable,\n\nwe agree with the district court that the economically feasible Plan which has already been approved by the\n\nvoters of Meriwether County is constitutionally acceptable, and is consistent with the preexisting court\n\ndecrees.\n\nB.         Transportation\n\n           The district court also found in response to Plaintiffs' objections to the Plan's effects on transportation\n\nthat any transportation \"disruption(s)\" would stem from demographic factors and not a constitutionally\n\nsuspect scheme of segregation.15 In so finding, the court was deducing from Freeman, 503 U.S. at 467, 112\n\nS.Ct. at 1430, that because racial imbalances in attendance zones resulting from demographics and not prior\n\nde jure segregation are not unconstitutional, then disproportionate transportation burdens stemming from\n\ndemographic sources are likewise not unconstitutional. Again, it is undisputed that Meriwether County's\n\npopulation center is in its southern region and that more of the white population resides in this section of the\n\n\n\n\n                   limited amount of money, there's only one more project and Warm Springs is the oldest\n                   elementary school we have in the county. It's the oldest physical facility we have in the\n                   county. Greenville and Woodbury have been—are in much better physical shape than\n                   the Warm Springs one is and if you want to go back and look, the oldest renovated\n                   elementary we have in the county, the last time renovations were done to any of them, the\n                   oldest one is Manchester ... To pass this bond referendum, we have got to have the\n                   support in the south part of the county [the population center]. You're not going to pass\n                   the bond referendum without support in the south part of the county.\n\n           Hicks Deposition at 75-76.\n     15\n     As the district court pointed out, because there are no pupil locator maps cataloging students by race\nand residence, it is difficult, if not impossible, to make accurate predictions concerning the changes in\ntravel times and distances under the Plan. Thus, there is no actual evidence in the record that there will be\nsuch disproportion. However, the district court assumed arguendo in its evaluation of the Plan that black\nstudents in the central and northern areas of the county would be disproportionately burdened.\n\n                                                          11\n\fcounty than the central or northern sections of the county. Consequently, the fact that white students may\n\nbe somewhat less burdened by the transportation scheme is a function of demographics and not a\n\nconstitutional violation. In light of Freeman, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred in so finding.\n\nC.      Faculty/Staff Assignments and Extracurricular Activities\n\n         The district court expressly refers to faculty and staff assignments in its order, but concludes\n\n\"because no assignments have been made and because faculty and administrators can change from year to\n\nyear, this court is unwilling to assume an improper assignment of faculty or administrators based upon the\n\nspeculations of Dr. Gordon, the government, and intervenors.\" Order at 8. Therefore, the court decided \"the\n\nmore prudent approach is to wait and see what changes are actually made and then decide whether those\n\nchanges were improper.\" Id. None of the briefs to this Court address the matter and Plaintiffs' briefs to the\n\ndistrict court are not particularly helpful either, citing only general concerns that the Plan will result in excess\n\nfaculty and that the Plan will not address the racial identifiability of faculty and administrator assignments.\n\nDefendants respond by arguing that it is premature to criticize the assignments before they have been made.\n\nEspecially in light of the lack of adversarial development with respect to faculty and staff assignments, we\n\nfind the \"wait and see\" approach of the district court is not an abuse of discretion. With respect to\n\nextracurricular activities, there was no mention of this Green factor, in the briefs to our Court or in the briefs\n\nto the district court. We assume that the district court also took a \"wait and see\" approach with respect to this\n\nfactor, as it did with the faculty/staff assignment factor, and we find no abuse of discretion.\n\nD.      Facilities\n\n        With respect to the facilities called for under the Plan, Plaintiffs make several objections. First, they\n\nobject to the construction priorities in the overall Plan. Under Phase 1, two new consolidated elementary\n\nschools would be built: a new North Elementary School, combining the populations of Luthersville and\n\nMcCrary school, and a new South Central Elementary, combining the populations of Manchester Elementary\n\n\n\n\n                                                        12\n\fand Warm Springs. Finally, a new high school was planned for the Greenville area.16 Plaintiffs contend that\n\nPhase 1 of the Plan results in \"putting white children first [because it] is easier to sell to the citizenry that must\n\nvote for the bond issue.\"17 Brief of United States at 33. This argument is without merit.\n\n         Two out of the three new structures proposed by the Plan would benefit student populations which\n\nwould be predominantly black. The new North Elementary School is projected to be 62% black and 37%\n\nwhite and replaces Luthersville Elementary and McCrary Elementary, which were 55% and 88% black,\n\nrespectively. The new Greenville High School is projected to be 80% black, replacing the current Greenville\n\nHigh School which is 79% black. The only new facility included as part of Phase 1 that is projected to be\n\nmajority white is the new South Elementary, which will be 50% white and 49% black. We fail to see how\n\nreplacing two predominantly black schools puts white children first.\n\n\n\n\n   16\n      Phase 1 of the Plan is projected to cost around $19 million, with $6 million coming from an\nallocation of state funds, and $13 million to come from the successful September 1996 bond issue. Phase\n2 of the Plan is projected to cost around $8.5 million. Phase 2 entails building a new Central Elementary\nSchool, combining the populations of Greenville and Woodbury Elementary Schools, renovating the\nformer Greenville High School to transform it into a true middle school, and renovating Manchester\nMiddle and High Schools. Plaintiffs vigorously objected in the district court to Phase 1 of the Plan on the\nground that the Board could never successfully pass the bond issue necessary to begin Phase 1\nconstruction. Given the referendum's subsequent success, that argument is obviously moot. Now\nPlaintiffs assert, as they did regarding Phase 1, that the funding for Phase 2 is speculative at best and may\nnever be locked into place. Because the Board has demonstrated its good faith in steering this Plan\nthrough the treacherous course of litigation and public debate, we are hesitant to assume that Phase 2 will\nnever be pursued. The Board has already accomplished more than Plaintiffs ever thought it could by\nsuccessfully securing financing for Phase 1. Consequently, we will not assume that Phase 2 will fail\nbefore it has even had the opportunity to be pursued in good faith. If it becomes clear the Board has no\nintention of pursuing Phase 2, the Plaintiffs may petition the district court for relief at that juncture.\n   17\n     Rather than include the new South Elementary School as part of Phase 1, Plaintiffs contend that a\nnew Central Elementary School ought to be built as part of Phase 1. Central Elementary will combine the\npresent populations of Greenville and Woodbury Elementary Schools. However, this would do nothing\nto redress the severe overcrowding at Warm Springs Elementary, where many of the students must attend\nclass in portable units. Under the current Plan, a new South Elementary would be built, thus remedying\nthe poor conditions at Warm Springs; and a new North Meriwether High school would be built to replace\nGreenville High School, thus allowing students of middle school age from Greenville Elementary to\nmove into the former Greenville High School facility. Under the Board's Plan, no students would have to\nattend school in overcrowded portable units, whereas under Plaintiffs' proposed course, the unfortunate\ncircumstances at Warm Springs would persist.\n\n                                                         13\n\f        We refer again to the helpful comments of Mr. Hicks, supra note 14, which indicate that the\n\nconstruction priorities were determined on the basis of need, not race, with a watchful eye on what was\n\npracticable. The southern elementary schools were the oldest in the county, and in worse physical shape than\n\nthe substitute project suggested by Plaintiffs. We do not believe it was unreasonable for the Board to include\n\nthe South Elementary School project in Phase 1. Nor was it unreasonable18 for the Board to consider the fact\n\nthat it would enhance the chances of passage of the bond issue for Phase 1 to include a fair allocation of\n\nresources to the southern portion of the county, the population center of the county. As Mr. Hicks noted, the\n\nbond issue (and thus the construction of the two predominantly black schools) was likely to fail without a fair\n\nallocation for the southern population center. We reject Plaintiffs' argument that this well-discussed and\n\nwell-bargained political compromise runs afoul of the constitutional guideposts set out in Green. Indeed, it\n\nis Green that counsels us to recall \"[t]hat the burden on a school board today is to come forward with a plan\n\nthat promises realistically to work, and promises realistically to work now.\" Green, 391 U.S. at 439, 88 S.Ct.\n\nat 1694. We agree with the district court that the Board, after twelve years of debate, has produced a Plan\n\nthat honors its desegregation obligations under the 1973 Order and under the case law, and successfully\n\nincorporates a bond issue for Phase 1 construction which has already passed.\n\n        Plaintiffs also object to the physical plant of the proposed new North Meriwether High School.\n\nSpecifically, they allege that the new high school, though technologically superior, will lack important\n\nfeatures that the old Greenville High School possesses, such as a ballfield and an auditorium. The Board\n\ncounters that the architectural plans it presented to the district court demonstrate the presence of both a\n\ngymnasium and a cafetorium.19 Thus, the only feature that the new North Meriwether County High School\n\nwould lack is a ballfield with stadium seating. The Board provides a reasonable explanation for this absence:\n\n\n\n   18\n     The district court's finding that these decisions were reasonable and the finding that these decisions\nreflected no racial discrimination have ample support in the record.\n   19\n     Apparently, a \"cafetorium\" employs a multipurpose design, incorporating auditorium features, and\nfunctions as both a cafeteria and, when appropriate, as an auditorium.\n\n                                                      14\n\fthe field at the former Greenville high school can be utilized until a new one can be financed. In any event,\n\nwe find that the Plaintiffs' argument in this regard fails to demonstrate the sort of constitutional transgression\n\nforbidden under Green and its progeny.\n\n                                              V. CONCLUSION\n\n        Having carefully considered the district court's order, the Board's Plan, the Plaintiffs' objections to\n\nboth, and the school district's response thereto, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion\n\nin approving the Board's Plan. We agree with the judgment of the district court that the Meriwether County\n\nSchool Board in pursuing its proposed Facilities Plan district has complied with the constitutional mandate\n\nof Green to the extent practicable. Accordingly, we hold that the school district has addressed the significant\n\nand unquestioned needs of its antiquated system, while striking the proper balance between its desegregation\n\nobligations and its obligation to the citizens of Meriwether County to come forward with a realistic plan that\n\npromises to work, and to work now. We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\napproving the Plan; the Plan is consistent with the Board's desegregation obligations under the previous\n\norders and with the relevant case law outlining the Board's constitutional obligations.\n\n        The judgment of the district court approving the Plan is therefore AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       15\n\f</pre>",
