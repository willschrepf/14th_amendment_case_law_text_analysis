Black v. City of Milwaukee, 2015 WI App 60, 364\n\nWis. 2d 626, 869 N.W.2d 522.\n\n      ¶2       This case requires us to interpret and apply Article\n\nXI, § 3(1) of the Wisconsin Constitution, better known as the\n\nhome rule amendment. \"Adopted in 1924, the home rule amendment\n\nwas     intended       to    provide       cities         and        villages      with     greater\n\nautonomy        over     local         affairs,\"       while          still       retaining        the\n\nLegislature's          power      to    legislate.          Madison         Teachers,       Inc.    v.\n\nWalker,        2014     WI     99,      ¶89,     358        Wis. 2d 1,         851     N.W.2d 337\n\n(footnotes omitted). Accordingly, the home rule amendment gives\n\ncities     and    villages         the    ability         \"to        determine       their     local\n\naffairs and government, subject only to this constitution and to\nsuch enactments of the legislature of statewide concern as with\n\nuniformity       shall       affect      every       city    or      every     village.\"2       Wis.\n\n\n      1\n          The Honorable Paul R. Van Grunsven presided.\n      2\n       In Madison Teachers, Inc. v. Walker, 2014 WI 99, 358\nWis. 2d 1, 851 N.W.2d 337, we noted, \"The home rule amendment\ndoes not apply to counties in Wisconsin. However, counties have\nhome rule protection pursuant to statute, though it is more\nlimited than the protection afforded by constitutional municipal\nhome rule.\" 358 Wis. 2d 1, ¶89 n.26.\n\n\n                                                 2\n\f                                                                                 No.     2014AP400\n\n\n\nConst. art. XI, § 3(1). In other words, a city or village may,\n\nunder its home rule authority, create a law that deals with its\n\nlocal affairs, but the Legislature has the power to statutorily\n\noverride      the     city's      or     village's        law     if     the    state       statute\n\ntouches      upon     a    matter      of     statewide        concern    or    if     the    state\n\nstatute uniformly affects every city or village. See Madison\n\nTeachers, 358 Wis. 2d 1, ¶101.\n\n       ¶3     In the present case, we interpret and apply the home\n\nrule amendment to determine whether a section in the City of\n\nMilwaukee's         (\"the    City\"       or    \"Milwaukee\")        charter       can     trump    a\n\nstatute enacted by the Legislature. Since 1938, Milwaukee has\n\nrequired       its        city    employees          to   comply         with    a     residency\n\nrequirement          or    face     termination           of     their     employment.          Its\n\nresidency requirement is set forth in section 5-02 of the City's\n\ncharter. Put simply, it requires city employees to reside within\n\ncity       limits.    In     2013,       the     Legislature           enacted       Wis.     Stat.\n\n§ 66.0502       (2013-14).3          Simply       stated,         Wis.     Stat.       § 66.0502\n\nprohibits       cities,          villages,           towns,      counties,        and        school\ndistricts4 from requiring their employees to reside within their\n\njurisdictional limits. It is obvious the charter and the statute\n\nconflict:      one        imposes    a      residency      requirement          and     one    bans\n\nresidency       requirements.               Despite       enactment        of     Wis.        Stat.\n\n       3\n       All subsequent references to the Wisconsin Statutes are\nthe 2013-2014 version unless otherwise noted.\n       4\n       As noted in an earlier footnote, the home rule amendment\napplies only to cities and villages. Wisconsin Stat. § 66.0502\napplies to any city, village, town, county, or school district.\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f                                                                               No.     2014AP400\n\n\n\n§ 66.0502,       the    City     has    continued      to       enforce   its        residency\n\nrequirement.5\n\n      ¶4     The City claims that it can continue to enforce its\n\nresidency requirement pursuant to its home rule authority under\n\nArticle    XI,    § 3(1)        of    the     Wisconsin         Constitution.         The    City\n\ncontends that its residency requirement (contained in section 5-\n\n02 of its charter) involves a matter of \"local affairs\" because\n\n(1) the City has an interest in maintaining a tax base from\n\nwhich to draw revenue; (2) the City has an interest in its\n\nemployees    sharing        a   common      community       investment         as    Milwaukee\n\nresidents;       and   (3)      the    City    has    an    interest      in    efficiently\n\ndelivering city services. Moreover, the City argues that Wis.\n\nStat. § 66.0502 cannot trump section 5-02 because it does not\n\nwith uniformity affect every city or every village. It believes\n\nthat \"uniformity\" must be understood as \"actually affecting all\n\nmunicipalities         in   equal      measure     uniformly.\"        According         to    the\n\nCity,     Wis.   Stat.       § 66.0502        fails   to        satisfy   the        home    rule\n\namendment's uniformity requirement because it does not impact\nall cities or villages in equal measure.\n\n      ¶5     In contrast, the Police Association claims that the\n\nCity can no longer enforce its residency requirement because\n\nWis. Stat. § 66.0502 trumps section 5-02 of the City's charter.\n\nThe     Police     Association          contends,          in    relevant       part,        that\n\n      5\n       In their briefs, both the City and the Police Association\nstate that the parties have agreed that the City will not act to\nenforce its residency requirement until our final decision on\nthe merits.\n\n\n                                               4\n\f                                                                         No.    2014AP400\n\n\n\nresidency      requirements         constitute       a    matter     primarily        of\n\nstatewide concern because (1) when the Legislature enacted Wis.\n\nStat.      § 66.0502,    it    found     that    \"public      employee         residency\n\nrequirements are a matter of statewide concern;\" and (2) the\n\nLegislature may legislate on matters that concern public health,\n\nsafety, and welfare, and here, it is reasonable to presume that\n\nthe     Legislature        determined         that       residency       requirements\n\nnegatively impact the welfare of public employees. Additionally,\n\nthe Police Association argues that Wis. Stat. § 66.0502 trumps\n\nsection 5-02 of the City's charter because Wis. Stat. § 66.0502\n\nwith uniformity affects every city or village. Unlike the City,\n\nit believes that \"uniformity\" must be understood as requiring\n\n\"facial uniformity.\" According to the Police Association, Wis.\n\nStat. § 66.0502 is facially uniform because, by its terms, it\n\napplies to all cities, villages, towns, counties, and school\n\ndistricts.     Finally,       the   Police     Association       seeks    relief     and\n\ndamages     under   42     U.S.C.     § 1983.     It     claims    that        the   City\n\nunconstitutionally deprived it of its \"liberty interest in being\nfree from 'residency' being required as a condition of municipal\n\nemployment\" when the City continued enforcement of its residency\n\nrequirement after the Legislature enacted Wis. Stat. § 66.0502.\n\n      ¶6     This   case      presents   two    issues     for    our    review.      The\n\nfirst is whether Wis. Stat. § 66.0502 precludes the City from\n\nenforcing its residency requirement. The second is whether the\n\nPolice Association is entitled to relief and damages under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983.\n\n\n                                          5\n\f                                                                             No.       2014AP400\n\n\n\n      ¶7     As    to     the    first    issue,         we   hold    that       Wis.     Stat.\n\n§ 66.0502        precludes      the    City       from     enforcing       its     residency\n\nrequirement.       The    Legislature         has    the      power   to     legislate       on\n\nmatters of local affairs when its enactment uniformly affects\n\nevery     city    or    every    village,         notwithstanding          the     home    rule\n\namendment. For purposes of the home rule amendment, an enactment\n\nis    uniform      when    it     is     facially        uniform.      Wisconsin          Stat.\n\n§ 66.0502 is facially uniform because it applies to \"any city,\n\nvillage, town, county, or school district.\" Wis. Stat. § 66.0502\n\n(2)   (emphasis        added).    Because      Wis.      Stat.   § 66.0502         uniformly\n\naffects every city or village, it trumps section 5-02 of the\n\nCity's charter. As a result, Milwaukee may no longer enforce its\n\nresidency requirement.\n\n      ¶8     As    to     the    second    issue,        we   hold    that       the    Police\n\nAssociation is not entitled to relief or damages under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983.     Its     section       1983    claim       fails      because         the    Police\n\nAssociation has not met the requirements necessary to prevail on\n\na section 1983 claim.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n    ¶9      For   many     years,    Milwaukee7      has   required       its   city\n\nemployees   to    reside    within     city       limits   as   a   condition     of\n\nemployment. Moreover, it has mandated discharge for any employee\n\ncaught living outside its city limits. Section 5-02 of the City\n\ncharter contains Milwaukee's residency rule:\n\n    1. RESIDENCY REQUIRED. All employe[e]s of the city of\n    Milwaukee are required to establish and maintain their\n    actual bona fide residence within the boundaries of\n    the city. Any employe[e] who does not reside within\n    the city shall be ineligible for employment by the\n    city and his employment shall be terminated in a\n    manner hereinafter set forth.\n    ¶10     On    June   20,   2013,        the    Legislature      enacted     2013\n\nWisconsin Act 20 (\"Act 20\").8 Section 1270 of Act 20 created Wis.\n\nStat. § 66.0502, which prohibits any city, village, county, or\n\nschool district from requiring an employee to live within a\n\njurisdictional limit. Specifically, it states,\n\n\n\n\n    7\n       Milwaukee is certainly not the only city that had a\nresidency requirement prior to the enactment of Wis. Stat.\n§ 66.0502. The record shows that 114 municipalities have some\ntype of restriction on where their employees reside. Moreover,\n13 municipalities required all their employees to live within\nthe municipal limits. The record also shows that 20 counties\nhave some type of residency restriction on where their employees\nreside. Further, 3 counties require all or most of their\nemployees to live within the county. See Legis. Fiscal Bureau,\nNo. 544, Local Government Employee Residency Requirements, at 3\n(May 9, 2013).\n    8\n       The Governor signed Act 20 on June 30, 2013, and the Act\ntook effect on July 2, 2013.\n\n\n                                        7\n\f                                                   No.   2014AP400\n\n\n    (1) The     legislature finds that public employee\n    residency   requirements are a matter of statewide\n    concern.\n\n    (2) In this section, \"local governmental unit\" means\n    any city, village, town, county, or school district.\n\n    (3)(a) Except as provided in sub. (4), no local\n    governmental unit may require, as a condition of\n    employment, that any employee or prospective employee\n    reside within any jurisdictional unit.\n\n    (b) If a local governmental unit has a residency\n    requirement in effect on July 2, 2013, the residency\n    requirement does not apply and may not be enforced.9\n\n    9\n       Wisconsin Stat. § 66.0502 contains exceptions that permit\na 15 mile residency requirement for law enforcement, fire, or\nemergency personnel:\n\n    (4)(a) This statute does not affect any statute that\n    requires residency within the jurisdictional limits of\n    any local governmental unit or any provision of state\n    or local law that requires residency in this state.\n\n    (b) Subject to par. (c), a local governmental unit may\n    impose a residency requirement on law enforcement,\n    fire, or emergency personnel that requires such\n    personnel   to  reside   within   15   miles  of   the\n    jurisdictional boundaries of the local governmental\n    unit.\n\n    (c) If the local governmental unit is a county, the\n    county may impose a residency requirement on law\n    enforcement,   fire,   or  emergency   personnel  that\n    requires such personnel to reside within 15 miles of\n    the jurisdictional boundaries of the city, village, or\n    town to which the personnel are assigned.\n\n    (d) A residency requirement imposed by a local\n    governmental unit under par. (b) or (c) does not apply\n    to any volunteer law enforcement, fire, or emergency\n    personnel who are employees of a local governmental\n    unit.\n\nWis. Stat. § 66.0502(4)(a)-(d).\n\n\n                                  8\n\f                                                                  No.     2014AP400\n\n\nWis. Stat. § 66.0502(1)-(3)(b).\n    ¶11   On   the       day   Act   20   took   effect,   the   City's    Common\n\nCouncil   passed     a    resolution      titled,    \"Substitute    resolution\n\ndirecting all City officials to continue enforcement of s. 5-02\n\nof the Milwaukee City charter relating to residency.\" It states,\n\nin pertinent part,\n\n    This resolution directs all City officials to continue\n    enforcement of s. 5-02 of the Milwaukee City Charter\n    relating to residency of City employees. The Common\n    Council    finds   that    legislative    action,    and\n    specifically the enactment of 2013 Wisconsin Act 20,\n    s. 1270, violates the City's constitutional home rule\n    authority under Article XI, Section 3(1), of the\n    Wisconsin State Constitution. Section 1270 purports to\n    prohibit   most  municipal   laws   requiring   employee\n    residency including provisions of the Milwaukee City\n    Charter.\n\n    The Common Council further finds that acquiescence to\n    this unconstitutional exercise of state authority\n    would significantly harm the interests of the City and\n    its residents.\n\n     . . . .\n\n    [] The issue of local residency is not a matter                       of\n    state-wide concern but is instead clearly a matter                    of\n    \"local affairs and government\" to be determined                       by\n    local governments that are directly accountable                       to\n    local voters; and\n\n    [] In 1938, as an exercise of its Constitutional Home\n    Rule authority, the City of Milwaukee enacted a\n    charter ordinance, now City Charter s. 5-02, requiring\n    that all employees reside within the boundaries of the\n    City . . . .\nFurthermore, the resolution listed justifications for the Common\n\nCouncil's decision to pass the resolution, such as (1) \"the need\n\nto ensure that sufficient staff are able to respond in a timely\nmanner to\" emergencies; (2) the need to \"minimize[] the City's\n\n                                          9\n\f                                                                      No.   2014AP400\n\n\n\nresponse time;\" (3) the need for city employees to \"contribut[e]\n\nto the City's economy; (4) and the desire for city employees to\n\nhave        \"better   knowledge      of         neighborhoods     and       enhanced\n\nrelationships with residents.\"\n\n       ¶12    The City's Mayor signed the resolution on the same day\n\nthe Common Council passed it. In addition, the Mayor publicly\n\nannounced that the City would terminate the employment of any\n\nemployee found to be in violation of its residency requirement.\n\n       ¶13    On July 10, 2013, the Police Association10 filed suit\n\nagainst the City in Milwaukee County Circuit Court. The Police\n\nAssociation      sought   a    declaratory       judgment,    pursuant      to    Wis.\n\nStat.       § 806.04,11   in     order    to     determine      the    rights     and\n\nobligations of the parties under Wis. Stat. § 66.0502, as well\n\nas     a    declaration   that     the    City     had    violated     Wis.      Stat.\n\n§ 66.0502.12      Additionally,     the        Police    Association    asked      for\n       10\n       The Police Association filed on behalf of \"itself and on\nbehalf of its Members, Michael V. Crivello, James A. Black,\nGlenn J. Podlesnik, and Steven J. Van Erden.\" For readability\npurposes, we refer to this group collectively as the \"Police\nAssociation.\"\n       11\n       Wisconsin Stat. § 806.04(1) provides, in pertinent part,\n\"Courts of record within their respective jurisdictions shall\nhave power to declare rights, status, and other legal relations\nwhether or not further relief is or could be claimed.\"\n       12\n       At one point, the Police Association also sought a writ\nof mandamus compelling the City to begin complying with Wis.\nStat. § 66.0502 by ceasing enforcement of its residency\nrequirement. However, as the circuit court noted in its decision\nand order, \"[The Police Association] is no longer pursuing the\nwrit of mandamus set forth as the third cause of action in the\ncomplaint . . . .\" Accordingly, we do not consider whether the\nPolice Association is entitled to a writ of mandamus.\n\n\n                                          10\n\f                                                                                  No.     2014AP400\n\n\n\nrelief and damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. It claimed that it\n\nwas   entitled          to    relief    under      section         1983   because       the    City\n\nviolated         its    liberty        interest         to    be    free    from        residency\n\nrequirements           as    a     condition      of    employment         when    its     Common\n\nCouncil passed, and the Mayor signed, the resolution.\n\n      ¶14        Some       time     later,       the    Fire       Fighters       Association\n\nintervened in the action. It sought an \"adjudication of the\n\nconstitutionality and enforceability of § 66.0502 of Wisconsin\n\nStatutes,\" and \"a permanent injunction enjoining the City of\n\nMilwaukee from enforcing any ordinances, resolutions, policies,\n\norders,      or    directives         in    any    form,      in    contravention         of    the\n\nrights      of    the       members    of   Local       215    under      § 66.0502       of    the\n\nWisconsin Statutes.\"13 All parties moved for summary judgment.\n\n      ¶15        On January 27, 2014, the circuit court held a hearing\n\non the parties' motions for summary judgment. That same day, the\n\ncourt      issued       a    decision      and    order.      Regarding      the        home   rule\n\namendment, the circuit court succinctly stated its findings in\n\nits concluding paragraph:\n\n      This Court finds that Wis. Stat. § 66.0502 deals with\n      a matter primarily of statewide concern and applies\n      uniformly to all local government units in this state.\n      The enactment of Wis. Stat. § 66.0502 withdrew from\n      local governments the power to regulate the matter of\n      residency requirements for municipal employees, and\n      thereby removed the issue of residency from the scope\n      of home rule authority under art. XI, sec. 3(1), Wis.\n      Const. Consequently, the home rule amendment does not\n      authorize the City to continue regulating residency\n      13\n       In addition, the Fire Fighters Association sought costs\nand disbursements.\n\n\n                                                  11\n\f                                                                      No.     2014AP400\n\n\n    requirements by enforcing an ordinance which is\n    directly contrary to the legislative mandates of Wis.\n    Stat. § 66.0502. The City's residency ordinance and\n    related [resolution] are unenforceable to the extent\n    that they fail to comply with the legislative mandates\n    of Wis. Stat. § 66.0502.\nRegarding       the   Police   Association's        section        1983    claim     for\n\ndamages, the circuit court concluded that \"Wis. Stat. § 66.0502\n\ncreates     a     liberty      interest       in    freedom        from     residency\n\nrequirements as a condition of municipal employment, except as\n\nprovided by the statute.\" But the court did not award damages\nbecause \"the City's actions thus far have not deprived any part\n\nof the liberty interest created by Wis. Stat. § 66.0502.\"\n\n    ¶16     The City appealed, and the Police Association14 cross-\n\nappealed. The court of appeals affirmed in part and reversed in\n\npart the circuit court's grant of summary judgment. Black v.\n\nCity of Milwaukee, 2015 WI App 60, ¶3, 364 Wis. 2d 626, 869\n\nN.W.2d 522. With respect to the section 1983 claim, the court of\n\nappeals   affirmed      the    circuit    court's     decision       not    to     award\n\nrelief or damages under section 1983. Id., ¶3. It did so on the\n\ngrounds that Wis. Stat. § 66.0502 \"did not create a protectable\n\nliberty   interest.\"      Id.,   ¶35.     With     respect    to    the     home    rule\n\namendment, the court of appeals concluded, \"because Wis. Stat.\n\n§ 66.0502 does not involve a matter of statewide concern and\n\ndoes not affect all local government units uniformly, it does\n\nnot trump the Milwaukee ordinance.\" Id., ¶3 (emphasis omitted).\n\n    14\n       Only the Police Association and Michael Crivello cross-\nappealed. James Black, Glenn Podlesnik, and Steven Van Erden did\nnot cross-appeal.\n\n\n                                         12\n\f                                                                            No.      2014AP400\n\n\n\n       ¶17     In reaching its conclusion on the home rule amendment,\n\nthe     court       of      appeals       expressed      deep       concern        over    the\n\ndisproportionate \"impact\" it believed Wis. Stat. § 66.0502 could\n\nhave on the City. See id., ¶¶5-8, 20-29, 33; see also id., ¶¶36-\n\n37 (Kessler, J., concurring).                  As a consequence of that concern,\n\nit determined that Wis. Stat. § 66.0502 primarily addressed a\n\nmatter of local affairs and did not impact every city or village\n\nequally. To support its conclusions, the court of appeals relied\n\non the Legislative Fiscal Bureau's Paper (#554), titled \"Local\n\nGovernment and Employee Residency Requirements.\" According to\n\nthe court of appeals, Paper #554 hypothesized that elimination\n\nof such requirements might adversely impact Milwaukee's \"levels\n\nof      employment,          incomes,         and     home      values        in     certain\n\nneighborhoods.\" Id. ¶6 (majority opinion).\n\n       ¶18     Further, the court of appeals feared that Milwaukee\n\nmight        become        the     next    Detroit:       \"Significantly, . . . the\n\nLegislative Fiscal Bureau paper's analysis warns that abolishing\n\nresidency requirements could result in Milwaukee's suffering the\nsame    economic         decline      recently       experienced      by   the      city    of\n\nDetroit,\" and \"The report surmised that Milwaukee could face the\n\nsame      fate        as         [Detroit],         despite        arguments        to     the\n\ncontrary . . . .\" Id., ¶7. The court of appeals felt so strongly\n\nabout the impact Wis. Stat. § 66.0502 might have on the City, it\n\nwent    so    far     as    to    state,   \"Regardless        of    what   the     statute's\n\nlanguage says, the facts in the record make clear that only one\n\ncity——Milwaukee——will be deeply and broadly affected.\" Id., ¶33\n(emphasis added); see also id., ¶21 (\"The facts in the record,\n                                               13\n\f                                                                   No.    2014AP400\n\n\n\nexemplified by the Legislative Fiscal Bureau's paper, make clear\n\nthat the goal of Wis. Stat. § 66.0502 was to target the City of\n\nMilwaukee.\"        (emphasis    added)).     Consequently,    the        court    of\n\nappeals ruled that section 5-02 of the City's ordinance was\n\n\"still good law.\" Id., ¶35.\n\n      ¶19    The    Police     Association    petitioned     this    court       for\n\nreview.

Even though the\n      determination made by it should be held not to be\n      absolutely controlling, nevertheless it is entitled to\n      great weight because matters of public policy are\n      primarily for the legislature.\n\n222 Wis. at 73-74.\n\n\n                                           24\n\f                                                                                No.   2014AP400\n\n\n\njudge     of     what     is    necessary         to   meet     the     needs         of   the\n\npublic . . . .\").         While       we   give   deference      to     a       Legislature's\n\ndetermination,          the    ultimate      decision        \"whether       a    legislative\n\nenactment is primarily a matter of local or statewide concern\n\nrests     with    this        court    and    not      the    legislature.\"           Madison\n\nTeachers, 359 Wis. 2d 1, ¶128.20\n\n\n\n\n     20\n       Despite articulating an understanding of the rule that\nthe Legislature's determination is entitled to great weight, the\ncourt of appeals chose to dismiss the Legislature's specific\ndetermination here:\n\n          The argument that residency requirements are a\n     matter of statewide concern simply because the\n     legislature said so is not persuasive because it is\n     unsubstantiated. Neither the Police Association nor\n     the trial court point to any facts supporting this\n     claim; the Police Association merely argues on appeal\n     that the Legislature can do what it wants. We\n     disagree. . . . In this case, we cannot conclude that\n     \"because the legislature said so\" is reason enough to\n     affirm the trial court when there are no facts to\n     support such a conclusion. The facts in the record,\n     exemplified by the Legislative Fiscal Bureau Paper,\n     make clear that the goal of Wis. Stat. § 66.0502 was\n     to target the City of Milwaukee. Nearly every portion\n     of the Legislative Fiscal Bureau paper's analysis\n     explains in great detail how Milwaukee will be\n     affected. The effect on the state, on the other hand,\n     is never substantiated, and only given lip-service\n     with broad policy arguments.\n\n                                                                                 (continued)\n                                             25\n\f                                                                            No.    2014AP400\n\n\n\n       ¶31    In this case, we are being asked to weigh a statewide\n\npolicy-based concern against a local economic interest. On the\n\none hand, the Legislature, through its enactment of Wis. Stat.\n\n§ 66.0502, has determined that public employees should have the\n\nright to choose where they wish to live. On the other hand, the\n\nCity    has       asserted       an   interest     in    maintaining       its    residency\n\nrequirement in order to protect its tax base, its interest in\n\nits    employees         sharing      a   common      community    investment      as     city\n\nresidents,         and     its    interest       in     its    efficient      delivery     of\n\nservices.21\n\n       ¶32    Given       the     competing        interests       outlined      above,     we\n\nconclude that Wis. Stat. § 66.0502 constitutes a \"mixed bag\"\n\nbecause it concerns both statewide and local interests. At this\n\npoint,       we    would     ordinarily       proceed         to   apply   the     test    of\n\nparamountcy to determine whether the legislative enactment is\n\n\"primarily\" or \"paramountly\" a matter of local affairs or a\n\n\nBlack v. City of Milwaukee, 2015 WI App 60, ¶21, 364\nWis. 2d 626, 869 N.W.2d 522. Our cases discussing deference to\nlegislative determinations of whether a matter is primarily of\nlocal or statewide concern under the home rule amendment have\nnever   required    the   Legislature   to    substantiate such\ndeterminations. See, e.g., Madison Teachers, 358 Wis. 2d 1,\n¶¶125-128; Van Gilder, 222 Wis. at 73-74. The court of appeals\nwas not bound by the Legislature's determination that \"public\nemployee residency requirements are a matter of statewide\nconcern.\" However, the court of appeals should have at least\nattempted to follow the law it said it understood by giving\ngreat weight to that legislative determination.\n       21\n       In its brief, the Police Association conceded that\nresidency requirements at least partly involve matters of local\nconcern.\n\n\n                                              26\n\f                                                                      No.      2014AP400\n\n\n\nmatter of statewide concern. However, in this case, we do not\n\napply the test of paramountcy to determine which interest (state\n\nor local) is paramount. Instead, we give the City the benefit of\n\nthe   doubt:     we    assume,    without      deciding,       that     Wis.      Stat.\n\n§ 66.0502 is a matter of local affairs. Accordingly, we move on\n\nto consider the second step in the home rule analysis——whether\n\nWis. Stat. § 66.0502 uniformly affects every city or village.\n\n  2. Whether Wis. Stat. § 66.0502 With Uniformity Affects Every\n                         City Or Village\n      ¶33   We   are    instructed     by     our   determination       in       Madison\n\nTeachers that if the statute concerns a matter of primarily\n\nlocal affairs, the reviewing court then examines whether the\n\nstatute     \"with     uniformity\"      \"affects\"      \"every     city       or    every\n\nvillage.\" See 358 Wis. 2d 1, ¶101. This is not the first time we\n\nhave examined the home rule amendment's uniformity requirement.\n\nWe addressed the home rule amendment's uniformity requirement in\n\nThompson    v.   Kenosha    County,      64    Wis. 2d 673,      221     N.W.2d 845\n\n(1974), and Van Gilder v. City of Madison, 222 Wis. 58, 267 N.W.\n\n25 (1936). Both of these cases are constitutional home rule\ncases,    interpreting     and   applying       the   same     amendment         we   are\n\ncurrently interpreting and applying: Article XI, § 3(1) of the\n\nWisconsin Constitution. With this precedent as our guide, we\n\nturn to the question of whether Wis. Stat. § 66.0502 affects\n\nwith uniformity every city or village.\n\n      ¶34   In      Thompson,    the    Legislature      passed         Wis.      Stat.\n\n§ 70.99,    which     allowed    any   Wisconsin      county     to    establish        a\ncounty assessor system. 64 Wis. 2d at 676. The plaintiffs argued\n\n                                        27\n\f                                                             No.     2014AP400\n\n\n\nthat Wis. Stat. § 70.99 violated the home rule amendment. Under\n\nthe statute, if a county chose to establish a county assessor\n\nsystem, then the office of assessor in all cities, villages, and\n\ntowns within the county was eliminated. Id. Kenosha County chose\n\nto adopt a county assessor system; thus, the office of assessor\n\nwas eliminated in all cities, villages, and towns within Kenosha\n\nCounty.   Relying   on   the   home   rule    amendment,   the     plaintiffs\n\nargued that   Wis. Stat. § 70.99           did not uniformly affect all\n\ncities and villages because the cities and villages in Kenosha\n\nCounty had no office of assessor, while cities and villages\n\nlocated in counties that chose to forego adoption of a county\n\nassessor system had an office of assessor. Id. at 683. This\n\ncourt dismissed their argument, commenting,\n\n    Sec. 70.99 is, on its face, uniformly applicable\n    throughout the state. The legislature did not enact a\n    statute which could only apply to Kenosha county, or\n    as is often the case, Milwaukee county. Each county in\n    the state has an equal right to decide to adopt a\n    countywide assessor system. . . . Where a statute\n    confers equal legal powers, that would seem sufficient\n    to satisfy the uniformity requirement. Thus, for\n    example, two cities may have identical powers, yet the\n    respective city councils may enact entirely different\n    sets of ordinances. The state could hardly be held to\n    have violated the uniformity requirement in such a\n    situation.\nId. at 687 (emphasis added). In short, since 1974 we have held\n\nthat a statute satisfies the home rule amendment's uniformity\n\nrequirement if it is, on its face, uniformly applicable to every\n\ncity or village. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                      28\n\f                                                                           No.   2014AP400\n\n\n\n       ¶35    We also considered the uniformity requirement in Van\n\nGilder. There, we expressed skepticism toward the notion that a\n\nlaw could have a uniform impact on every city or village:\n\n       Was it the intention of the people that the\n       legislature should be without power to enact any law\n       affecting a city of 2,500 people unless that law at\n       the same time affected in the same way the City of\n       Milwaukee, a metropolitan community having few if any\n       interests akin to those of a small city of the fourth\n       class? What was meant by uniformity? Was the law to be\n       uniform in its application to the city of X with 2,500\n       population and affect it in the same way it affects\n       the city of Milwaukee, a metropolitan community having\n       a population of 600,000? In that sense there could\n       hardly be a law affecting with uniformity every city.\n       A law uniform in its application might work out one\n       way in one city and in another way in another city\n       depending upon the local situation and the way in\n       which it was in fact administered and so \"affect\" them\n       differently.\nVan Gilder, 222 Wis. at 67 (emphasis added). We ultimately held,\n\n\"[W]e   can     reach     no   other     conclusion        than    that    it    was   the\n\nintention      of   the   people    in    the   adoption      of    the    [home      rule]\n\namendment to leave a large measure of control over municipal\n\naffairs      with   the   legislature.\"         Id.   at    71.    We     went   on,    \"To\n\nconstrue      the    amendment      as    meaning     that        every    act   of     the\n\nlegislature relating to cities is subject to a charter ordinance\n\nunless the act of the legislature affected with uniformity every\n\ncity    from    smallest       to   the    greatest,         practically         destroys\n\nlegislative         control     over      municipal         affairs . . . .\"            Id.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n       ¶36    In sum, our precedent——going back to at least 1936——\nconfirms that facial uniformity is sufficient to satisfy the\n\n\n                                           29\n\f                                                                                   No.      2014AP400\n\n\n\nhome rule amendment's uniformity requirement. As long as the\n\nstatute,      on    its       face,    uniformly          affects        cities       or    villages\n\nthroughout         the    State,      the     home       rule    amendment's            uniformity\n\nrequirement is satisfied.\n\n    ¶37       The effect of the court of appeals' interpretation of\n\nuniformity is to ignore the holdings in Van Gilder and Thompson.\n\nThat is, while            Van Gilder          and      Thompson      instruct that facial\n\nuniformity is sufficient, the court of appeals would hold that\n\nfacial   uniformity            would    \"all        but      obliterate         the     home     rule\n\namendment.\" Black, 364 Wis. 2d 626, ¶32. The court of appeals\n\nmisperceives the point of the home rule amendment. As stated\n\npreviously, \"The legislative power in this state is lodged in\n\nthe legislature. When it exerts that power, it exerts it on\n\nbehalf   of    and       in    the     name    of      the     people      of     the      State   of\n\nWisconsin.\" Van Gilder, 222 Wis. at 67. The home rule amendment\n\n\"confer[red]         upon      cities       and     villages         a    measure          of   self-\n\ngovernment not theretofore possessed;\" however, the amendment\n\ndid so via \"a grant of power to cities and villages,\" not via an\n\"express      limitation         upon       the        power    of       the    Legislature.\"22\n\n    22\n       \"In ascertaining the meaning of the home-rule amendment,\nwe should also take into account the fact that the legislature\nwas not hostile to a larger measure of local self-government by\ncities.\" Van Gilder, 222 Wis. 2d at 71. The Legislature was not\nadverse to the idea of cities having some control because, as\nnoted by the Attorney General in the helpful amicus curiae brief\nprepared by the Solicitor General's office,\n\n    At the time Wisconsin debated the Amendment, the\n    problem of the day was the Legislature enacting city-\n    specific legislation, addressing purely local issues,\n    because cities lacked sufficient legal power to\n                                                   (continued)\n                                                  30\n\f                                                                        No.      2014AP400\n\n\n\nBaxter, 195 Wis. at 445. (\"The [amendment] is a grant of power\n\nto cities and villages. . . . The phrase 'subject only to this\n\nconstitution,' etc., is a phrase of limitation, but it is a\n\nlimitation upon the power granted to cities and villages.\").\n\n      ¶38    Thus, under the home rule amendment, a city or village\n\n\"operates freed from legislative restriction\" only in \"a rather\n\nnarrow field.\" Van Gilder, 222 Wis. at 80-81. We have explained,\n\n      When the legislature deals with local affairs as\n      distinguished from matters which are primarily of\n      state-wide concern, it can only do so effectually by\n      an act which affects with uniformity every city. It is\n      true that this leaves a rather narrow field in which\n      the    home-rule   amendment    operates    freed    from\n      legislative restriction, but there is no middle\n      ground. Either the field within which the home-rule\n      amendment operates must be narrowed or the field\n      within   which   the   legislature   operates   must   be\n      narrowed, and as was pointed out in the Baxter Case,\n      the    amendment   clearly    contemplates    legislative\n      regulation of municipal affairs and there was no\n      intention on the part of the people in adopting the\n      home rule amendment to create a state within a state,\n      an imperium in imperio.\nId.   at    80-81.    When   the     Legislature       wants    to   legislate      on   a\nmatter of local affairs, it may do so if the law, on its face,\n\nuniformly affects every city or village.\n\n      ¶39    In      this    case,     the        Legislature    banned       residency\n\nrequirements         throughout      Wisconsin        by    enacting      Wis.     Stat.\n\n§ 66.0502.     We    conclude      that   Wis.      Stat.   § 66.0502     (consistent\n\n\n      regulate their own affairs. The Amendment sought to\n      cure this problem by giving cities general law-making\n      authority so the Legislature would no longer have to\n      pass such laws.\n\n\n                                             31\n\f                                                              No.     2014AP400\n\n\n\nwith the home rule amendment) uniformly affects every city or\n\nvillage. We so conclude because the plain language of Wis. Stat.\n\n§ 66.0502 demonstrates its uniform effect: Wis. Stat. § 66.0502\n\nsays that \"no local governmental unit\" may have a residency\n\nrequirement, and it goes on to define \"local governmental unit\"\n\nto mean \"any city, village, town, county, or school district\" in\n\nthe    State.   Wis.    Stat.     § 66.0502(2)-(3)    (emphasis      added).23\n\nConsequently,    Wis.    Stat.    § 66.0502     uniformly   bans    residency\n\nrequirements,    and    in   so   doing,   it   satisfies   the     home   rule\n\namendment's uniformity requirement.24\n\n\n\n       23\n       Here, the Legislature ensured that Wis. Stat. § 66.0502\nwould with uniformity affect every city or village by making\nWis. Stat. § 66.0502 apply to any city, village, town, county,\nor school district in the state. While the Legislature can\npreempt a city ordinance under the home rule amendment by making\na statute apply to all cities or villages, it is no small\ndecision to make a statute applicable to every city or village\nin the State. The Legislature must still make an important\ntrade-off when it is considering whether it should legislate on\na matter of local concern.\n       24\n       In its petition for review, the Police Association raised\ntwo additional issues:\n\n      1. May a municipality disregard legislative prohibitions on\n         certain conditions of municipal employment, by simply\n         passing an ordinance disputing the legislature's policy\n         determination and asserting [h]ome [r]ule authority to do\n         so, without first seeking a declaration as to the rights\n         and obligations of the parties?\n\n      2. Should a municipality be required to prove \"beyond a\n         reasonable doubt\" that a statute is an unconstitutional\n         overreach of its authority under the [h]ome [r]ule\n         [a]mendment?\n\n                                                                   (continued)\n                                      32\n\f                                                                        No.        2014AP400\n\n\n\n\n   B. WHETHER THE POLICE ASSOCIATION IS ENTITLED TO RELIEF AND\n                    DAMAGES UNDER SECTION 1983\n       ¶40    Finally, we address the Police Association's argument\n\nthat    it    is    entitled     to   relief     and     damages    under     42    U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983. \"Section 1983 provides a remedy against 'any person'\n\nwho,    under      color    of   state    law,     deprives    another        of    rights\n\nprotected      by    the    Constitution.\"25       Collins    v.

Whether The City's Actions Shock The Conscience\n\n       ¶44    Actions shock the conscience when they offend \"even\n\nhardened sensibilities\" or \"the decencies of civilized conduct.\"\n\nRochin v.

For   example,      in     Rochin     v.\n\nCalifornia, 342 U.S. 165 (1952), the case that first developed\n\nthe shock the conscience test, police officers illegally broke\n\ninto Rochin's home, jumped on him, handcuffed him, struggled to\n\nopen his mouth, forced an emetic solution into his stomach, and\n\nmade him vomit, so they could obtain evidence. 342 U.S. at 166.\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States held that these actions\n\nwere \"too close to the rack and the screw to permit . . . .\" Id.\n\nat 172.\n\n      ¶45   In the present case, the Common Council passed, and\n\nthe Mayor signed, a resolution, which affirmed the section of\n\nits City charter requiring city employee residency. Relying on\n\nthe home rule amendment, the resolution claimed that the City\n\ncould     still   enforce   its     residency     requirement        because     its\ncharter (section 5.02) trumped the state statute (Wis. Stat.\n\n§ 66.0502). Because the City believed its charter prevailed over\n\n\n\n\n                                      36\n\f                                                                      No.    2014AP400\n\n\n\nthe state statute, the resolution stated that the City would\n\ncontinue to enforce its residency requirement.26\n\n     ¶46    Simply    stated,       these    actions     do     not    \"shock      the\n\nconscience\"——they do not offend \"even hardened sensibilities\" or\n\n\"the decencies of civilized conduct.\" Here, we had a genuine\n\nlegal dispute as to which law, Wis. Stat. § 66.0502 or section\n\n5-02 of the City's charter, would prevail. The Common Council\n\nand the Mayor, by passing the resolution, merely provided the\n\nCity's    opinion    that,    pursuant       to   the   home    rule     amendment,\n\nsection 5-02 of the City's charter trumped Wis. Stat. § 66.0502.\n\nThe City has not pointed to any case where factually similar\n\nconduct was held to shock the conscience. Therefore, we are not\n\nwilling    to   conclude     that   a   genuine     legal      dispute      over   the\n\npriority of two competing laws (one a statute and one a section\n\nof a city charter) rises to the level of conscience-shocking\n\nbehavior.\n\n ii. Whether The City's Actions Deprived The Police Association\n               Of A Fundamental Right Or Liberty\n     ¶47    The Supreme Court of the United States \"has always\nbeen reluctant to expand the concept of substantive due process\n\n\n     26\n       In its brief, the Police Association applied the shocks\nthe conscience test to both the Mayor's actions and the Common\nCouncil's actions: \"Substantive due process is violated by\nexecutive action when it can properly be characterized as\narbitrary, or conscience shocking, in a constitutional sense,\"\nand \"Substantive due process is violated by legislative action\nand can properly be recognized as arbitrary or conscience\nshocking, when its sweep is unnecessarily broad and invades a\nprotected freedom.\" (quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n\n                                        37\n\f                                                                                 No.    2014AP400\n\n\n\nbecause     guideposts           for     reasonable        decision       making        in     this\n\nunchartered area are scarce and open-ended.\" Collins, 503 U.S.\n\nat   126.

In determining whether an\n\nasserted    right         falls       within     the     purview    of    substantive          due\n\nprocess, the Supreme Court has \"regularly observed that the Due\n\nProcess Clause specially protects those fundamental rights and\n\nliberties       which       are,        objectively,          'deeply     rooted        in    this\n\nNation's history and tradition.'\" Id.

Rather, the Police Association\n\nclaims that Wis. Stat. § 66.0502——on the day it was enacted——\n\ncreated     a     liberty            interest     in     being     free    from        residency\n\nrequirements         as     a        condition     of    employment.

Helms, 459 U.S. 460 (1983) for the proposition that a liberty\n\ninterest may arise from two sources: the Due Process Clause or\n\nthe laws of a state. 459 U.S. at 466. In Hewitt, the Supreme\n\nCourt       of    the       United     States      ultimately         concluded          that    the\n\n\"statutory            framework       governing        the    administration             of     state\n\nprisons gave rise to a liberty interest . . . , but . . . the\n\nprocedures afforded [the] respondent were 'due process' under\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment.\" Id. (emphasis added). Throughout its\n\nopinion, the Court made reference to the state regulation giving\n\nrise       to     procedural          due       process       protections:          \"procedural\n\nguidelines,\" \"procedural rights,\" \"procedural requirements,\" and\n\n\"procedural safeguards.\" Id. at 471, 472, 473, 475. There, the\n\n\"Due       Process      Clause       require[d]        only   an     informal      nonadversary\n\nreview of evidence . . . in order to confine an inmate feared to\n\nbe     a     threat         to     institutional         security       to    administrative\nsegregation.\" Id. at 474 (emphasis added).\n\n       ¶50       We recognize that the Supreme Court, in cases like\n\nHewitt,         has    \"repeatedly         held   that       state    statutes       may      create\n\nliberty          interests         that     are        entitled       to     the         procedural\n\nprotections            of    the     Due    Process       Clause       of    the     Fourteenth\n\nAmendment.\" Vitek v.

However, the \"Supreme Court has never held that such\n\nstate-created               interests       constitute         a     fundamental              liberty\ninterest         protected         under    a     substantive        due     process          theory.\n                                                  39\n\f                                                                  No.      2014AP400\n\n\n\nRather, the Court has analyzed state-created liberties under a\n\nprocedural due process theory.\" Krausharr v.

Ind. 1995) (\"A state\n\ncannot     legislate    or    otherwise      determine   what   constitutes       a\n\nfundamental principle of justice and liberty so as to be worthy\n\nof   protection   under       the   federal    constitution.\").      The    Police\n\nAssociation has not pointed to any contrary authority. Because\n\n\"[t]he     doctrine    of    judicial   restraint   requires    [a      court]   to\n\nexercise the utmost care\" when determining whether a substantive\n\ndue process right exists, we decline to create a new right or\n\nliberty interest in being free from residency requirements as a\n\ncondition of employment. See Collins, 503 U.S. at 126. As a\n\nresult, we conclude that the Police Association's substantive\n\ndue process argument fails. Because the Police Association has\n\nnot shown a deprivation of rights, privileges, or immunities\n\nprotected by the Constitution or laws of the United States, it\n\nis not entitled to relief or damages under section 1983.27\n\n\n\n\n      27\n       The Police Association appears to argue (1) that the\nCity's resolution deprived it of a non-fundamental liberty\ninterest in being free from a residency requirement and (2) that\nthis deprivation does not survive rational basis review. Even\nassuming that the first of these arguments is valid (which we do\nnot decide), the resolution survives rational basis review. The\nresolution was rationally related to the City's legitimate\ninterest in expressing its opinion on whether, pursuant to the\nhome rule amendment, section 5-02 of the City's charter trumped\nWis. Stat. § 66.0502.\n\n\n                                        40\n\f                                                                               No.    2014AP400\n\n\n\n                                    IV. CONCLUSION\n\n      ¶51    To summarize, first, we hold that Wis. Stat. § 66.0502\n\nprecludes the City from enforcing its residency requirement. The\n\nLegislature       has    the    power      to    legislate        on   matters       of    local\n\naffairs when its enactment uniformly affects every city or every\n\nvillage, notwithstanding the home rule amendment. For purposes\n\nof the home rule amendment, an enactment is uniform when it is\n\nfacially uniform. Wisconsin Stat. § 66.0502 is facially uniform\n\nbecause     it    applies      to   \"any    city,         village,     town,     county,      or\n\nschool     district.\"      Wis.     Stat.       § 66.0502        (2)   (emphasis      added).\n\nBecause Wis. Stat. § 66.0502 uniformly affects every city or\n\nvillage, it trumps section 5-02 of the City's charter. Milwaukee\n\nmay no longer enforce its residency requirement. Second, we hold\n\nthat the Police Association is not entitled to relief or damages\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Its section 1983 claim fails because the\n\nPolice Association has not met the requirements necessary to\n\nprevail     on    a     section     1983    claim.         Specifically,        the       Police\n\nAssociation has not shown a deprivation of rights, privileges,\nor   immunities       protected      by    the       Constitution       or   laws     of    the\n\nUnited States.\n\n      By    the    Court.—The       decision         of    the    court   of     appeals      is\n\naffirmed in part and reversed in part.\n\n\n\n\n                                                41\n\f                                                                          No.    2014AP400.rgb\n\n\n\n\n       ¶52    REBECCA G.

I write separately to\n\npoint out that the original meaning of the home rule amendment\n\nto the Wisconsin Constitution decrees a different interpretation\n\nthan this court gives.

The    majority     holds       that    the\n\nstatute      controls   over      any    conflicting           city    charter        ordinance\n\n\"either (1) when the enactment addresses a matter of statewide\n\nconcern, or (2) when the enactment with uniformity affects every\n\ncity or village.\"           Majority op., ¶26.\n\n       ¶53    I cannot agree with this interpretation based on the\n\ntext of the home rule amendment and its original meaning.                                   After\nexamining the constitutional debates and practices surrounding\n\nthe    amendment's          adoption,        I       conclude    that      a     legislative\n\nenactment preempts a conflicting city charter ordinance under\n\nthe home rule amendment only when the enactment both concerns a\n\nmatter of statewide concern and with uniformity affects every\n\ncity or village.            See Wis. Const. art. XI, § 3(1).                      Here, Wis.\n\nStat. § 66.0502 meets both the statewide concern and uniformity\n\nrequirements;        therefore,        § 66.0502          prevails     over     the    City    of\nMilwaukee's residency requirement found in section 5-02 of the\n\n                                                 1\n\f                                                                               No.    2014AP400.rgb\n\n\nCity's       charter.        As     a   result,         although    I    disagree       with    the\n\nmajority's        interpretation             and    application          of    the     home    rule\n\namendment, I agree with the end result: Wis. Stat. § 66.0502\n\nprecludes the City of Milwaukee from enforcing its residency\n\nrequirement.\n\n                 I. INTERPRETATION OF THE HOME RULE AMENDMENT\n\n       ¶54      The methodology used to interpret amendments to the\n\nWisconsin         Constitution          is     well          established.            See,      e.g.,\n\nDairyland Greyhound Park, Inc. v.

We    independently\n\ninterpret the Wisconsin Constitution,1 \"to give effect to the\n\nintent of the framers and of the people who adopted it; and it\n\nis a rule of construction applicable to all constitutions that\n\nthey are to be construed so as to promote the objects for which\n\nthey were framed and adopted.\"                      State v.

We may look to \"three primary sources in determining\n\nthe    meaning         of    a    constitutional             provision:        [1]     the     plain\n\nmeaning, [2] the constitutional debates and practices of the\n\ntime, and [3] the earliest interpretations of the provision by\n\nthe    legislature,          as    manifested          through     the    first       legislative\n\naction following adoption.\"                    Dairyland Greyhound Park, 295 Wis.\n\n\n\n       1\n       Thompson v.

See Wis. Const. art. XI, § 3(1).\n\nI give priority to the plain meaning of the words of the home\n\nrule amendment.       See Dairyland Greyhound Park, 295 Wis. 2d 1,\n\n¶117 (Prosser, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part).\n\n                               A. Plain meaning\n\n      ¶55    To understand the original meaning of the home rule\n\namendment, I begin with the text of the amendment.                      The home\n\nrule amendment provides, in pertinent part: \"Cities and villages\n\norganized    pursuant    to    state   law       may   determine     their   local\n\naffairs and government, subject only to this constitution and to\n\nsuch enactments of the legislature of statewide concern as with\n\nuniformity shall affect every city or every village.\"                         Wis.\n\n\n      I do not address legislative interpretations to determine\n      2\n\nthe meaning of the home rule amendment because\n\n           In the performance of assigned constitutional\n      duties each branch of the Government must initially\n      interpret the Constitution, and the interpretation of\n      its powers by any branch is due great respect from the\n      others. . . . Many decisions of this Court, however,\n      have unequivocally reaffirmed the holding of Marbury\n      v. Madison that '(i)t is emphatically the province and\n      duty of the judicial department to say what the law\n      is.'\n\nUnited States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 703 (1974)(quoting Marbury\nv. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 177, 1 Cranch 137, 2 L.Ed. 60\n(1803))(internal citation omitted).\n\n                                       3\n\f                                                                          No.      2014AP400.rgb\n\n\nConst. art. XI, § 3(1).                  The structure of this sentence reveals\n\nthe    meaning    of    the       home    rule       amendment.        The     first      clause\n\nprovides: \"Cities and villages organized pursuant to state law\n\nmay determine their local affairs and government.\"                                       See   id.\n\nThis independent clause grants power to cities and villages to\n\ngovern      \"their     local      affairs    and      government.\"           See    id.        The\n\nsecond       clause,    a      dependent        clause,      modifies        the     preceding\n\nindependent clause and places two limitations on the grant of\n\npower to cities and villages.                   First, the constitution may limit\n\ncity or village authority to determine its local affairs.                                      The\n\nsecond limitation subordinates the power of cities and villages\n\nto:    \"such enactments of the legislature of statewide concern as\n\nwith uniformity shall affect every city or every village.\"                                     See\n\nid.    This second limitation contains two requirements evidenced\n\nby its grammatical construction.3                     The subject of this limitation\n\nis \"enactments of the legislature,\" while the verb is \"shall\n\naffect.\"       The phrase \"of statewide concern\" specifies the type\n\nof enactments that supersede local governance, and the phrase\n\"as    with     uniformity\"            specifies      how    those    enactments          \"shall\n\naffect\"       every    city       or    every    village.            Because       one    phrase\n\nmodifies the subject and the other phrase modifies the verb,\n\nboth       modifiers        are        necessary,       rather        than      unilaterally\n\nsufficient requirements.                 In other words, the text of the home\n\nrule       amendment    authorizes         cities      and    villages       to     \"determine\n\n       3\n       \"Words are to be given the meaning that proper grammar and\nusage would assign them.\"     Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner,\nReading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 140 (2012).\n\n\n                                                 4\n\f                                                                 No.   2014AP400.rgb\n\n\ntheir   local      affairs     and   government\"     subject       only     to   the\n\nWisconsin    Constitution         and   a     legislative       enactment        both\n\naddressing   a     statewide     concern    and   with    uniformity      affecting\n\nevery city or every village.               The \"subject to\" phrase accords\n\npriority4 over local governance to both the constitution and\n\nenactments of the legislature of statewide concern, provided the\n\nuniformity requirement is met.             In the event of conflict between\n\na local enactment and either the constitution or an enactment of\n\nthe legislature (1) where the subject matter is of statewide\n\nconcern and (2) that applies with uniformity to every city and\n\nvillage, the local enactment must give way.                     The text of the\n\nhome rule amendment cannot be reasonably or grammatically read\n\nin any other way.\n\n    ¶56     Much of this court's precedent, including our recent\n\ndecision in Madison Teachers, Inc. v. Walker, 2014 WI 99, ¶101,\n\n358 Wis. 2d 1, 851 N.W.2d 337, fails to apply the plain meaning\n\nof the home rule amendment.             Nevertheless, the majority relies\n\nentirely    upon    the   home   rule   framework        set   forth   in   Madison\nTeachers without any attempt to explain how the text of the\n\namendment supports that framework.            The majority states:\n\n    [O]ur home rule case law instructs us that, when\n    reviewing a legislative enactment under the home rule\n    amendment, we apply a two-step analysis. First, as a\n    threshold matter, the court determines whether the\n    statute concerns a matter of primarily statewide or\n    primarily local concern.   If the statute concerns a\n    matter of primarily statewide interest, the home rule\n    amendment is not implicated and our analysis ends.\n    If, however, the statute concerns a matter of\n    4\n        Id. at 127.\n\n\n                                        5\n\f                                                                No.   2014AP400.rgb\n\n     primarily local affairs, the reviewing court then\n     examines whether the statute satisfies the uniformity\n     requirement. If the statute does not, it violates the\n     home rule amendment.\nMajority op.,       ¶25 (quoting     Madison Teachers, 358 Wis. 2d 1,\n\n¶101) (emphasis added).           To conclude as the majority does, that\n\nanalysis of the home rule amendment stops if the legislative\n\nenactment at issue addresses an issue primarily of statewide\n\nconcern    and    that   the    uniformity     requirement   applies     only   to\n\nlegislation concerning issues primarily of local concern, simply\n\ndoes not comport with the text of the amendment.\n\n     ¶57    As emphasized above, Madison Teachers did not purport\n\nto rely on the text of the home rule amendment to craft the\n\nanalytical       framework     employed   by   the   majority    opinion    here.\n\nInstead, Madison Teachers relied on case law concerning the home\n\nrule amendment dating back to 1926.              Id., ¶¶96-101, 117 (citing\n\nState ex rel. Ekern v. City of Milwaukee, 190 Wis. 633, 640, 209\n\nN.W. 860 (1926)).         The problem with Madison Teachers' reliance\n\non precedent and in turn the majority opinion's employment of\n\nthe analytical framework from Madison Teachers is that no prior\ncase reconciles the text of the home rule amendment with this\n\njudicially-created analytical framework.5\n\n\n\n\n     5\n       See, e.g., Thompson v.

Id.       Hoan first explained in his amicus brief in\n\nBaxter that he \"drafted this Home Rule Amendment to overcome the\n\ndifficulties pointed out in [Mueller]\" and that he presented the\n\namendment's wording and meaning to city attorneys around the\n\nstate and to legislative committee members and that during those\n\npresentations       \"no   other       interpretation         of    this    amendment       was\n\nthere offered except as outlined in this brief.\"                                Id. at 2-3.\n\nHe   then    explained     that       he    determined       that     striking      certain\n\nlanguage from Article XI, Section 3, pertaining to legislative\n\nauthority,     to    create     the        grant    of    authority       to    cities     and\n\nvillages, rather than adding a new section to the constitution,\n\nwould provide greater clarity as to the purpose and meaning of\n\nthe home rule amendment.               Id. at 8.            He stated that the home\n\nrule amendment makes \"certain that cities and villages shall\n\nhave    a   grant   of    power   to       determine       their    local       affairs    and\ngovernment.\"        Id. at 12-13.           To ensure that cities and villages\n\nreceived     this    authority        under    the        home    rule    amendment,      the\n\namendment      contains        only     two        limitations      on     local        power:\n\n\"'subject only to this constitution and to such enactments of\n\nthe legislature of state-wide concern as shall with uniformity\n\naffect every city or every village.'\"                       Id. at 13 (quoting Wis.\n\nConst. art.

We submit that this\n      wording is not ambiguous as other constitutional Home\n      Rule amendments may be.    It does not say——subject to\n      state laws, subject to state laws of state-wide\n      concern, or subject to laws uniformly affecting\n      cities, but it does say——subject only to such state\n      laws as are therein defined, and these laws must meet\n      two tests: First——do they involve a subject of state-\n      wide concern, and second——do they with uniformity\n      affect every city or village?\nId. at      13-14 (emphasis added)        (italics in original).                  There\n\ncould not be a clearer confirmation of the original meaning of\n\nthe home rule amendment than this.                The person who drafted the\n\nhome rule amendment specifically clarified that a legislative\n\nenactment must both involve a matter of statewide concern and\n\nwith uniformity affect every city or every village.\n\n      ¶63      In addition to the framer's interpretation of the home\n\nrule amendment, between 1919 and 1924, newspapers from across\n\nthe state published content addressing the need for a home rule\n\namendment and providing voters with information regarding the\nmeaning of home rule amendment.               For example, in 1919, Hoan, who\n\nwas then Mayor of Milwaukee, wrote a letter to the editor in\n\nsupport of the home rule amendment, which had recently failed to\n\npass the Senate by a single vote.               Daniel W. Hoan, Letter to the\n\nEditor, Voice of the People, The Capital Times, Apr. 22, 1919,\n\nat 4.    Mayor Hoan's letter strongly advocated for the passage of\n\nthe     home    rule   amendment    to        address    the   problem       of    the\nlegislature      having   to   review    numerous       proposed    bills    dealing\n\nwith purely local matters.

In    1921,    The\n\nCapital Times reported:\n\n      While the amendment was broad in its application\n      covering other cities of the state, the principle\n      purpose of passing it was to aid Milwaukee.     It is\n      estimated that over 25 percent of the measures before\n      the Wisconsin legislature directly affecting Milwaukee\n      and a home rule [] could be passed upon locally if\n      home rule were in force.\nHome Rule Amendment Is Nullified, The Capital Times, Jan. 27,\n\n1921, at 1.

This is because the purpose of the\n\nhome rule amendment, as discussed in Part I, was to empower\n\ncities and villages to address matters of purely local concern\n\nrather than require legislative action to resolve these matters.\n\nWhen a legislative enactment involves any degree of statewide\n\nconcern, it will not violate the home rule amendment so long as\n\nthe    enactment      with    uniformity       affects    every    city        or    every\n\nvillage.\n\n       ¶70    Here,    Wis.

Finally,      the    prohibition        on     residency\n\nrequirements under § 66.0502 addresses issues of public welfare,\n\nthe free movement of citizens, and the recruitment of workers——\n\nall matters of statewide concern.                       In sum, because Wis.

See Wis. Const. art.\n\nXI, § 3(1).       This interpretation is based on the plain meaning\n\nof the home rule amendment as reflected in the history of the\n\namendment and the constitutional debates and practices at the\n\ntime the amendment was adopted.              Here, Wis.

Instead      of     freeing\n\nmunicipalities from interference by the legislature when dealing\n\nwith local affairs, the majority limits the power and restrains\n\nthe ability of municipalities to self-govern.\n\n    ¶76     In reaching its conclusion that Wis.

It does\n\nthis by contravening the well-recognized purpose of the Home\nRule Amendment, ignoring the evidentiary record, and creating a\n\nheretofore unknown facial uniformity rule.\n\n    ¶77     Contrary to the majority, I conclude that the city of\n\nMilwaukee may enforce its residency requirement under the powers\n\ngranted to local municipalities by the Wisconsin Constitution's\n\nHome Rule Amendment.

Kenosha County, 64 Wis. 2d 673,\n\n676, 221 N.W.2d 845 (1974), the majority asserts that \"facial\n\nuniformity is sufficient to satisfy the home rule amendment's\nuniformity requirement.\"           Majority op., ¶36.           However, Thompson\n\nis distinguishable because it examined legislation that gave,\n\nrather than eliminated, municipalities' power to govern their\n\nlocal affairs.        64 Wis. 2d at 687.\n\n    ¶111 As      the     Thompson    court    explained,        conferring      equal\n\npower     satisfies        the       uniformity          requirement          because\n\n    7\n       See, e.g., Marmolejo-Campos v. Holder, 558 F.3d 903, 930\n(9th Cir. 2009) (\"This purported explanation is a non-\nexplanation——an ipse dixit or 'because I said so' edict.\").\n\n\n                                       13\n\f                                                                No. 2014AP400.awb\n\n\nmunicipalities retain the right to enact the ordinances they\n\nchoose:\n\n       Each county in the state has an equal right to decide\n       to adopt a countywide assessor system. The residents\n       of all cites, villages, and towns have an equal right\n       to participate in making that decision through their\n       right to vote for and petition county board members.\n       Where a statute confers equal legal powers, that would\n       seem sufficient to satisfy the uniformity requirement.\n       Thus, for example, two cities may have identical\n       powers, yet the respective city councils may enact\n       entirely different sets of ordinances.\nId.    Thompson thus concluded that \"[t]he state could hardly be\n\nheld   to   have     violated     the   uniformity    requirement       in   such   a\n\nsituation.\"     Id.\n\n       ¶112 Granting municipalities power is distinguishable from\n\nthe elimination of Milwaukee's residency requirement under Wis.\n\nStat § 66.0502.        When the legislature grants every municipality\n\npower over an area of governance, each municipality is uniformly\n\naffected because it retains the discretionary authority to act\n\nunder that power.\n\n       ¶113 In contrast, the elimination of residency requirements\nrestricts, rather than expands a grant of local power.                        Here,\n\nmunicipalities without an employee residency requirement will be\n\nunaffected by Wis. Stat. § 66.0502, but it will have an outsize\n\neffect    on   the    city   of   Milwaukee   which    did   have   a    residency\n\nrequirement.\n\n       ¶114 Admittedly,       Van   Gilder    presents   a   more   challenging\n\nprecedent. It sends mixed messages and ultimately lands on a\n\nconstitutional interpretation that is at odds with the text of\nthe constitutional Home Rule Amendment.\n\n                                         14\n\f                                                                        No. 2014AP400.awb\n\n\n      ¶115 Initially         Van Gilder         signals an interpretation that\n\nhonors   the    language         of    the    constitutional         amendment.        \"The\n\npower[] of municipalities . . . to enact an organic law dealing\n\nwith local affairs and government is subject to such acts of the\n\nlegislature relating thereto as are of state-wide concern and\n\naffect with uniformity all cities.\"                   Van Gilder, 222 Wis. at 73.\n\n      ¶116 Later, however, Van Gilder lands on an interpretation\n\nthat is at odds with the text of the Home Rule Amendment:                              \"when\n\nthe legislature deals with local affairs as distinguished from\n\nmatters which are primarily of state-wide concern, it can only\n\ndo so effectually by an act which affects with uniformity every\n\ncity.\"   Id. at 80-81.\n\n      ¶117 The        latter           misguided         interpretation           of     the\n\nconstitutional        Home        Rule       Amendment     has       been   adopted       by\n\nsubsequent courts, including recently by this court in Madison\n\nTeachers and by the majority today.\n\n      ¶118 In Madison Teachers, this court interpreted the Home\n\nRule Amendment to mean that legislative enactments will trump\nlocal    laws    if   they        either      address     a    statewide     matter      or\n\nuniformly affect every municipality.                     358 Wis. 2d 1, ¶101.            If\n\nthe   matter    is    primarily          a    local    concern,       Madison     Teachers\n\ninstructs   that      the    court       must      determine     whether    the    statute\n\nuniformly   affects         every      municipality.           Id.     If   the    statute\n\nsatisfies the uniformity requirement, it does not violate the\n\nHome Rule Amendment.             Id.    I dissented in Madison Teachers.\n\n      ¶119 Contrary         to    the    majority's       interpretation,         I    agree\nwith the amicus briefs of the League of Wisconsin Municipalities\n\n                                              15\n\f                                                                      No. 2014AP400.awb\n\n\nand the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, as well as the\n\nbrief      of   the   city    of    Milwaukee      and    the    unanimous      court    of\n\nappeals'        observation    that        \"the   test    articulated      in    Madison\n\nTeachers is somewhat at odds with the plain language of the home\n\nrule amendment.\"         Black, 364 Wis. 2d 626, ¶15.\n\n       ¶120 The majority here continues this error.                        I interpret\n\nthe home rule constitutional amendment to mean what it says:\n\nthe legislature can enact a law superseding a municipality's\n\ncharter ordinance if the law is of \"state wide concern as with\n\nuniformity shall affect every city or every village.\"8\n\n       ¶121 A legislative act must be of statewide concern and\n\nthen it must apply uniformly.                     The majority's interpretation\n\nprovides        otherwise.         It   states     that   a     legislative     act     can\n\nsupersede a city’s charter ordinance dealing with solely local\n\nmatters, with no statewide concern whatsoever, as long as it\n\ndoes       so   uniformly.         Thus,    the    majority     simply     ignores      the\n\nrequisite        \"statewide        concern\"       language      of   the     Home     Rule\n\nAmendment.\n       ¶122 Additionally, the majority also ignores the lack of\n\nuniform effect.        Although Wis. Stat. § 66.0502 does not name any\n\nparticular municipality, it will have an outsizes effect on the\n\ncity of Milwaukee for the reasons set forth above, including a\n\nprojected loss of $649 million from Milwaukee's tax base.\n\n\n\n       8\n       Because the textual analysis of the Home Rule Amendment is\nset forth in ¶4 of Justice Rebecca Bradley's concurrence, I need\nnot repeat that analysis here.\n\n\n                                             16\n\f                                                                    No. 2014AP400.awb\n\n\n      ¶123 The effect on other Wisconsin municipalities is simply\n\nnot addressed by the majority opinion.                  As the court of appeals\n\naptly states, \"the notion that a statute purporting to gut the\n\ntax   bases   and    compromise     the      neighborhood        integrity    of    all\n\nmunicipalities would pass both houses of the legislature defies\n\nlogic.\"       Id.,   ¶33.        The    majority's        newly    created      facial\n\nuniformity rule eliminates the requirement that courts review\n\nthe factual particulars of a home rule challenge.\n\n      ¶124 Under the majority opinion, the only legislation that\n\nwould not uniformly affect all municipalities is one that would\n\novertly   single      out    a   particular        city     or     village.         The\n\nlegislature is now free to search for laws unique to Milwaukee,\n\nMadison, Green Bay, or any other municipality of its choosing\n\nand   enact   facially      neutral     legislation       abrogating     individual\n\nlocal laws.\n\n      ¶125 Ultimately,        the      majority     opinion        disregards       the\n\nfundamental rule that \"we interpret the home rule amendment with\n\nan eye toward preserving the constitution.\"                       Id., ¶32 (citing\nState ex rel. Ekern v. City of Milwaukee, 190 Wis. 633, 639, 209\n\nN.W. 860 (1926)).           As the court of appeals warned, a facial\n\nuniformity     standard      \"all      but     obliterate[s]       the   home      rule\n\namendment, which is not only illogical but also contrary to\n\nlaw.\"   Id.\n\n      ¶126 In sum, I conclude that the city of Milwaukee may\n\nenforce its residency requirement under the powers granted to\n\nlocal municipalities by the Wisconsin Constitution's Home Rule\nAmendment.      I    would    therefore        affirm    the     court   of   appeals\n\n                                          17\n\f                                                          No. 2014AP400.awb\n\n\ndetermination     that   Wis.

Since 1938, Milwaukee has\n\nrequired       its        city    employees          to   comply         with    a     residency\n\nrequirement          or    face     termination           of     their     employment.          Its\n\nresidency requirement is set forth in section 5-02 of the City's\n\ncharter. Put simply, it requires city employees to reside within\n\ncity       limits.    In     2013,       the     Legislature           enacted       Wis.     Stat.\n\n§ 66.0502       (2013-14).3          Simply       stated,         Wis.     Stat.       § 66.0502\n\nprohibits       cities,          villages,           towns,      counties,        and        school\ndistricts4 from requiring their employees to reside within their\n\njurisdictional limits. It is obvious the charter and the statute\n\nconflict:      one        imposes    a      residency      requirement          and     one    bans\n\nresidency       requirements.               Despite       enactment        of     Wis.        Stat.\n\n       3\n       All subsequent references to the Wisconsin Statutes are\nthe 2013-2014 version unless otherwise noted.\n       4\n       As noted in an earlier footnote, the home rule amendment\napplies only to cities and villages. Wisconsin Stat. § 66.0502\napplies to any city, village, town, county, or school district.\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f                                                                               No.     2014AP400\n\n\n\n§ 66.0502,       the    City     has    continued      to       enforce   its        residency\n\nrequirement.5\n\n      ¶4     The City claims that it can continue to enforce its\n\nresidency requirement pursuant to its home rule authority under\n\nArticle    XI,    § 3(1)        of    the     Wisconsin         Constitution.         The    City\n\ncontends that its residency requirement (contained in section 5-\n\n02 of its charter) involves a matter of \"local affairs\" because\n\n(1) the City has an interest in maintaining a tax base from\n\nwhich to draw revenue; (2) the City has an interest in its\n\nemployees    sharing        a   common      community       investment         as    Milwaukee\n\nresidents;       and   (3)      the    City    has    an    interest      in    efficiently\n\ndelivering city services. Moreover, the City argues that Wis.\n\nStat. § 66.0502 cannot trump section 5-02 because it does not\n\nwith uniformity affect every city or every village. It believes\n\nthat \"uniformity\" must be understood as \"actually affecting all\n\nmunicipalities         in   equal      measure     uniformly.\"        According         to    the\n\nCity,     Wis.   Stat.       § 66.0502        fails   to        satisfy   the        home    rule\n\namendment's uniformity requirement because it does not impact\nall cities or villages in equal measure.\n\n      ¶5     In contrast, the Police Association claims that the\n\nCity can no longer enforce its residency requirement because\n\nWis. Stat. § 66.0502 trumps section 5-02 of the City's charter.\n\nThe     Police     Association          contends,          in    relevant       part,        that\n\n      5\n       In their briefs, both the City and the Police Association\nstate that the parties have agreed that the City will not act to\nenforce its residency requirement until our final decision on\nthe merits.\n\n\n                                               4\n\f                                                                         No.    2014AP400\n\n\n\nresidency      requirements         constitute       a    matter     primarily        of\n\nstatewide concern because (1) when the Legislature enacted Wis.\n\nStat.      § 66.0502,    it    found     that    \"public      employee         residency\n\nrequirements are a matter of statewide concern;\" and (2) the\n\nLegislature may legislate on matters that concern public health,\n\nsafety, and welfare, and here, it is reasonable to presume that\n\nthe     Legislature        determined         that       residency       requirements\n\nnegatively impact the welfare of public employees. Additionally,\n\nthe Police Association argues that Wis. Stat. § 66.0502 trumps\n\nsection 5-02 of the City's charter because Wis. Stat. § 66.0502\n\nwith uniformity affects every city or village. Unlike the City,\n\nit believes that \"uniformity\" must be understood as requiring\n\n\"facial uniformity.\" According to the Police Association, Wis.\n\nStat. § 66.0502 is facially uniform because, by its terms, it\n\napplies to all cities, villages, towns, counties, and school\n\ndistricts.     Finally,       the   Police     Association       seeks    relief     and\n\ndamages     under   42     U.S.C.     § 1983.     It     claims    that        the   City\n\nunconstitutionally deprived it of its \"liberty interest in being\nfree from 'residency' being required as a condition of municipal\n\nemployment\" when the City continued enforcement of its residency\n\nrequirement after the Legislature enacted Wis. Stat. § 66.0502.\n\n      ¶6     This   case      presents   two    issues     for    our    review.      The\n\nfirst is whether Wis. Stat. § 66.0502 precludes the City from\n\nenforcing its residency requirement. The second is whether the\n\nPolice Association is entitled to relief and damages under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983.\n\n\n                                          5\n\f                                                                             No.       2014AP400\n\n\n\n      ¶7     As    to     the    first    issue,         we   hold    that       Wis.     Stat.\n\n§ 66.0502        precludes      the    City       from     enforcing       its     residency\n\nrequirement.       The    Legislature         has    the      power   to     legislate       on\n\nmatters of local affairs when its enactment uniformly affects\n\nevery     city    or    every    village,         notwithstanding          the     home    rule\n\namendment. For purposes of the home rule amendment, an enactment\n\nis    uniform      when    it     is     facially        uniform.      Wisconsin          Stat.\n\n§ 66.0502 is facially uniform because it applies to \"any city,\n\nvillage, town, county, or school district.\" Wis. Stat. § 66.0502\n\n(2)   (emphasis        added).    Because      Wis.      Stat.   § 66.0502         uniformly\n\naffects every city or village, it trumps section 5-02 of the\n\nCity's charter. As a result, Milwaukee may no longer enforce its\n\nresidency requirement.\n\n      ¶8     As    to     the    second    issue,        we   hold    that       the    Police\n\nAssociation is not entitled to relief or damages under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983.     Its     section       1983    claim       fails      because         the    Police\n\nAssociation has not met the requirements necessary to prevail on\n\na section 1983 claim. Specifically, the Police Association has\nnot shown a deprivation of rights, privileges, or immunities\n\nprotected by the Constitution or the laws of the United States.6\n\n\n\n\n      6\n       Stated otherwise, we affirm the court of appeals'\ndetermination that the Police Association is not entitled to\nrelief and damages pursuant to section 1983. However, we reverse\nthe court of appeals' conclusion that, under the home rule\namendment, section 5-02 of the City's charter trumps Wis. Stat.\n§ 66.0502.\n\n\n                                              6\n\f                                                                    No.    2014AP400\n\n\n\n            I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n    ¶9      For   many     years,    Milwaukee7      has   required       its   city\n\nemployees   to    reside    within     city       limits   as   a   condition     of\n\nemployment. Moreover, it has mandated discharge for any employee\n\ncaught living outside its city limits. Section 5-02 of the City\n\ncharter contains Milwaukee's residency rule:\n\n    1. RESIDENCY REQUIRED. All employe[e]s of the city of\n    Milwaukee are required to establish and maintain their\n    actual bona fide residence within the boundaries of\n    the city. Any employe[e] who does not reside within\n    the city shall be ineligible for employment by the\n    city and his employment shall be terminated in a\n    manner hereinafter set forth.\n    ¶10     On    June   20,   2013,        the    Legislature      enacted     2013\n\nWisconsin Act 20 (\"Act 20\").8 Section 1270 of Act 20 created Wis.\n\nStat. § 66.0502, which prohibits any city, village, county, or\n\nschool district from requiring an employee to live within a\n\njurisdictional limit. Specifically, it states,\n\n\n\n\n    7\n       Milwaukee is certainly not the only city that had a\nresidency requirement prior to the enactment of Wis. Stat.\n§ 66.0502. The record shows that 114 municipalities have some\ntype of restriction on where their employees reside. Moreover,\n13 municipalities required all their employees to live within\nthe municipal limits. The record also shows that 20 counties\nhave some type of residency restriction on where their employees\nreside. Further, 3 counties require all or most of their\nemployees to live within the county. See Legis. Fiscal Bureau,\nNo. 544, Local Government Employee Residency Requirements, at 3\n(May 9, 2013).\n    8\n       The Governor signed Act 20 on June 30, 2013, and the Act\ntook effect on July 2, 2013.\n\n\n                                        7\n\f                                                   No.   2014AP400\n\n\n    (1) The     legislature finds that public employee\n    residency   requirements are a matter of statewide\n    concern.\n\n    (2) In this section, \"local governmental unit\" means\n    any city, village, town, county, or school district.\n\n    (3)(a) Except as provided in sub. (4), no local\n    governmental unit may require, as a condition of\n    employment, that any employee or prospective employee\n    reside within any jurisdictional unit.\n\n    (b) If a local governmental unit has a residency\n    requirement in effect on July 2, 2013, the residency\n    requirement does not apply and may not be enforced.9\n\n    9\n       Wisconsin Stat. § 66.0502 contains exceptions that permit\na 15 mile residency requirement for law enforcement, fire, or\nemergency personnel:\n\n    (4)(a) This statute does not affect any statute that\n    requires residency within the jurisdictional limits of\n    any local governmental unit or any provision of state\n    or local law that requires residency in this state.\n\n    (b) Subject to par. (c), a local governmental unit may\n    impose a residency requirement on law enforcement,\n    fire, or emergency personnel that requires such\n    personnel   to  reside   within   15   miles  of   the\n    jurisdictional boundaries of the local governmental\n    unit.\n\n    (c) If the local governmental unit is a county, the\n    county may impose a residency requirement on law\n    enforcement,   fire,   or  emergency   personnel  that\n    requires such personnel to reside within 15 miles of\n    the jurisdictional boundaries of the city, village, or\n    town to which the personnel are assigned.\n\n    (d) A residency requirement imposed by a local\n    governmental unit under par. (b) or (c) does not apply\n    to any volunteer law enforcement, fire, or emergency\n    personnel who are employees of a local governmental\n    unit.\n\nWis. Stat. § 66.0502(4)(a)-(d).\n\n\n                                  8\n\f                                                                  No.     2014AP400\n\n\nWis. Stat. § 66.0502(1)-(3)(b).\n    ¶11   On   the       day   Act   20   took   effect,   the   City's    Common\n\nCouncil   passed     a    resolution      titled,    \"Substitute    resolution\n\ndirecting all City officials to continue enforcement of s. 5-02\n\nof the Milwaukee City charter relating to residency.\" It states,\n\nin pertinent part,\n\n    This resolution directs all City officials to continue\n    enforcement of s. 5-02 of the Milwaukee City Charter\n    relating to residency of City employees. The Common\n    Council    finds   that    legislative    action,    and\n    specifically the enactment of 2013 Wisconsin Act 20,\n    s. 1270, violates the City's constitutional home rule\n    authority under Article XI, Section 3(1), of the\n    Wisconsin State Constitution. Section 1270 purports to\n    prohibit   most  municipal   laws   requiring   employee\n    residency including provisions of the Milwaukee City\n    Charter.\n\n    The Common Council further finds that acquiescence to\n    this unconstitutional exercise of state authority\n    would significantly harm the interests of the City and\n    its residents.\n\n     . . . .\n\n    [] The issue of local residency is not a matter                       of\n    state-wide concern but is instead clearly a matter                    of\n    \"local affairs and government\" to be determined                       by\n    local governments that are directly accountable                       to\n    local voters; and\n\n    [] In 1938, as an exercise of its Constitutional Home\n    Rule authority, the City of Milwaukee enacted a\n    charter ordinance, now City Charter s. 5-02, requiring\n    that all employees reside within the boundaries of the\n    City . . . .\nFurthermore, the resolution listed justifications for the Common\n\nCouncil's decision to pass the resolution, such as (1) \"the need\n\nto ensure that sufficient staff are able to respond in a timely\nmanner to\" emergencies; (2) the need to \"minimize[] the City's\n\n                                          9\n\f                                                                      No.   2014AP400\n\n\n\nresponse time;\" (3) the need for city employees to \"contribut[e]\n\nto the City's economy; (4) and the desire for city employees to\n\nhave        \"better   knowledge      of         neighborhoods     and       enhanced\n\nrelationships with residents.\"\n\n       ¶12    The City's Mayor signed the resolution on the same day\n\nthe Common Council passed it. In addition, the Mayor publicly\n\nannounced that the City would terminate the employment of any\n\nemployee found to be in violation of its residency requirement.\n\n       ¶13    On July 10, 2013, the Police Association10 filed suit\n\nagainst the City in Milwaukee County Circuit Court. The Police\n\nAssociation      sought   a    declaratory       judgment,    pursuant      to    Wis.\n\nStat.       § 806.04,11   in     order    to     determine      the    rights     and\n\nobligations of the parties under Wis. Stat. § 66.0502, as well\n\nas     a    declaration   that     the    City     had    violated     Wis.      Stat.\n\n§ 66.0502.12      Additionally,     the        Police    Association    asked      for\n       10\n       The Police Association filed on behalf of \"itself and on\nbehalf of its Members, Michael V.

However, as the circuit court noted in its decision\nand order, \"[The Police Association] is no longer pursuing the\nwrit of mandamus set forth as the third cause of action in the\ncomplaint . . . .\" Accordingly, we do not consider whether the\nPolice Association is entitled to a writ of mandamus.\n\n\n                                          10\n\f                                                                                  No.     2014AP400\n\n\n\nrelief and damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.

Regarding      the        home   rule\n\namendment, the circuit court succinctly stated its findings in\n\nits concluding paragraph:\n\n      This Court finds that Wis. Stat. § 66.0502 deals with\n      a matter primarily of statewide concern and applies\n      uniformly to all local government units in this state.\n      The enactment of Wis. Stat. § 66.0502 withdrew from\n      local governments the power to regulate the matter of\n      residency requirements for municipal employees, and\n      thereby removed the issue of residency from the scope\n      of home rule authority under art. XI, sec. 3(1), Wis.\n      Const. Consequently, the home rule amendment does not\n      authorize the City to continue regulating residency\n      13\n       In addition, the Fire Fighters Association sought costs\nand disbursements.\n\n\n                                                  11\n\f                                                                      No.     2014AP400\n\n\n    requirements by enforcing an ordinance which is\n    directly contrary to the legislative mandates of Wis.\n    Stat. § 66.0502. The City's residency ordinance and\n    related [resolution] are unenforceable to the extent\n    that they fail to comply with the legislative mandates\n    of Wis. Stat. § 66.0502.\nRegarding       the   Police   Association's        section        1983    claim     for\n\ndamages, the circuit court concluded that \"Wis. Stat. § 66.0502\n\ncreates     a     liberty      interest       in    freedom        from     residency\n\nrequirements as a condition of municipal employment, except as\n\nprovided by the statute.\" But the court did not award damages\nbecause \"the City's actions thus far have not deprived any part\n\nof the liberty interest created by Wis.

Stat. § 66.0502 could\n\nhave on the City. See id., ¶¶5-8, 20-29, 33; see also id., ¶¶36-\n\n37 (Kessler, J., concurring).                  As a consequence of that concern,\n\nit determined that Wis. Stat. § 66.0502 primarily addressed a\n\nmatter of local affairs and did not impact every city or village\n\nequally. To support its conclusions, the court of appeals relied\n\non the Legislative Fiscal Bureau's Paper (#554), titled \"Local\n\nGovernment and Employee Residency Requirements.\" According to\n\nthe court of appeals, Paper #554 hypothesized that elimination\n\nof such requirements might adversely impact Milwaukee's \"levels\n\nof      employment,          incomes,         and     home      values        in     certain\n\nneighborhoods.\" Id. ¶6 (majority opinion).\n\n       ¶18     Further, the court of appeals feared that Milwaukee\n\nmight        become        the     next    Detroit:       \"Significantly, . . . the\n\nLegislative Fiscal Bureau paper's analysis warns that abolishing\n\nresidency requirements could result in Milwaukee's suffering the\nsame    economic         decline      recently       experienced      by   the      city    of\n\nDetroit,\" and \"The report surmised that Milwaukee could face the\n\nsame      fate        as         [Detroit],         despite        arguments        to     the\n\ncontrary . . . .\" Id., ¶7. The court of appeals felt so strongly\n\nabout the impact Wis. Stat. § 66.0502 might have on the City, it\n\nwent    so    far     as    to    state,   \"Regardless        of    what   the     statute's\n\nlanguage says, the facts in the record make clear that only one\n\ncity——Milwaukee——will be deeply and broadly affected.\" Id., ¶33\n(emphasis added); see also id., ¶21 (\"The facts in the record,\n                                               13\n\f                                                                   No.    2014AP400\n\n\n\nexemplified by the Legislative Fiscal Bureau's paper, make clear\n\nthat the goal of Wis.

On the other hand, the\n\nCity    has       asserted       an   interest     in    maintaining       its    residency\n\nrequirement in order to protect its tax base, its interest in\n\nits    employees         sharing      a   common      community    investment      as     city\n\nresidents,         and     its    interest       in     its    efficient      delivery     of\n\nservices.21\n\n       ¶32    Given       the     competing        interests       outlined      above,     we\n\nconclude that Wis.

The court of appeals\nwas not bound by the Legislature's determination that \"public\nemployee residency requirements are a matter of statewide\nconcern.\" However, the court of appeals should have at least\nattempted to follow the law it said it understood by giving\ngreat weight to that legislative determination.\n       21\n       In its brief, the Police Association conceded that\nresidency requirements at least partly involve matters of local\nconcern.\n\n\n                                              26\n\f                                                                      No.      2014AP400\n\n\n\nmatter of statewide concern. However, in this case, we do not\n\napply the test of paramountcy to determine which interest (state\n\nor local) is paramount.

Both of these cases are constitutional home rule\ncases,    interpreting     and   applying       the   same     amendment         we   are\n\ncurrently interpreting and applying: Article XI, § 3(1) of the\n\nWisconsin Constitution. With this precedent as our guide, we\n\nturn to the question of whether Wis. Stat. § 66.0502 affects\n\nwith uniformity every city or village.\n\n      ¶34   In      Thompson,    the    Legislature      passed         Wis.      Stat.\n\n§ 70.99,    which     allowed    any   Wisconsin      county     to    establish        a\ncounty assessor system. 64 Wis. 2d at 676. The plaintiffs argued\n\n                                        27\n\f                                                             No.     2014AP400\n\n\n\nthat Wis. Stat. § 70.99 violated the home rule amendment. Under\n\nthe statute, if a county chose to establish a county assessor\n\nsystem, then the office of assessor in all cities, villages, and\n\ntowns within the county was eliminated. Id. Kenosha County chose\n\nto adopt a county assessor system; thus, the office of assessor\n\nwas eliminated in all cities, villages, and towns within Kenosha\n\nCounty.   Relying   on   the   home   rule    amendment,   the     plaintiffs\n\nargued that   Wis. Stat. § 70.99           did not uniformly affect all\n\ncities and villages because the cities and villages in Kenosha\n\nCounty had no office of assessor, while cities and villages\n\nlocated in counties that chose to forego adoption of a county\n\nassessor system had an office of assessor. Id. at 683. This\n\ncourt dismissed their argument, commenting,\n\n    Sec. 70.99 is, on its face, uniformly applicable\n    throughout the state. The legislature did not enact a\n    statute which could only apply to Kenosha county, or\n    as is often the case, Milwaukee county. Each county in\n    the state has an equal right to decide to adopt a\n    countywide assessor system. . . . Where a statute\n    confers equal legal powers, that would seem sufficient\n    to satisfy the uniformity requirement. Thus, for\n    example, two cities may have identical powers, yet the\n    respective city councils may enact entirely different\n    sets of ordinances. The state could hardly be held to\n    have violated the uniformity requirement in such a\n    situation.\nId. at 687 (emphasis added). In short, since 1974 we have held\n\nthat a statute satisfies the home rule amendment's uniformity\n\nrequirement if it is, on its face, uniformly applicable to every\n\ncity or village. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                      28\n\f                                                                           No.   2014AP400\n\n\n\n       ¶35    We also considered the uniformity requirement in Van\n\nGilder. There, we expressed skepticism toward the notion that a\n\nlaw could have a uniform impact on every city or village:\n\n       Was it the intention of the people that the\n       legislature should be without power to enact any law\n       affecting a city of 2,500 people unless that law at\n       the same time affected in the same way the City of\n       Milwaukee, a metropolitan community having few if any\n       interests akin to those of a small city of the fourth\n       class? What was meant by uniformity? Was the law to be\n       uniform in its application to the city of X with 2,500\n       population and affect it in the same way it affects\n       the city of Milwaukee, a metropolitan community having\n       a population of 600,000? In that sense there could\n       hardly be a law affecting with uniformity every city.\n       A law uniform in its application might work out one\n       way in one city and in another way in another city\n       depending upon the local situation and the way in\n       which it was in fact administered and so \"affect\" them\n       differently.\nVan Gilder, 222 Wis. at 67 (emphasis added). We ultimately held,\n\n\"[W]e   can     reach     no   other     conclusion        than    that    it    was   the\n\nintention      of   the   people    in    the   adoption      of    the    [home      rule]\n\namendment to leave a large measure of control over municipal\n\naffairs      with   the   legislature.\"         Id.   at    71.

The court of appeals\n\nmisperceives the point of the home rule amendment. As stated\n\npreviously, \"The legislative power in this state is lodged in\n\nthe legislature. When it exerts that power, it exerts it on\n\nbehalf   of    and       in    the     name    of      the     people      of     the      State   of\n\nWisconsin.\" Van Gilder, 222 Wis. at 67. The home rule amendment\n\n\"confer[red]         upon      cities       and     villages         a    measure          of   self-\n\ngovernment not theretofore possessed;\" however, the amendment\n\ndid so via \"a grant of power to cities and villages,\" not via an\n\"express      limitation         upon       the        power    of       the    Legislature.\"22\n\n    22\n       \"In ascertaining the meaning of the home-rule amendment,\nwe should also take into account the fact that the legislature\nwas not hostile to a larger measure of local self-government by\ncities.\" Van Gilder, 222 Wis. 2d at 71. The Legislature was not\nadverse to the idea of cities having some control because, as\nnoted by the Attorney General in the helpful amicus curiae brief\nprepared by the Solicitor General's office,\n\n    At the time Wisconsin debated the Amendment, the\n    problem of the day was the Legislature enacting city-\n    specific legislation, addressing purely local issues,\n    because cities lacked sufficient legal power to\n                                                   (continued)\n                                                  30\n\f                                                                        No.      2014AP400\n\n\n\nBaxter, 195 Wis. at 445. (\"The [amendment] is a grant of power\n\nto cities and villages. . . . The phrase 'subject only to this\n\nconstitution,' etc., is a phrase of limitation, but it is a\n\nlimitation upon the power granted to cities and villages.\").\n\n      ¶38    Thus, under the home rule amendment, a city or village\n\n\"operates freed from legislative restriction\" only in \"a rather\n\nnarrow field.\" Van Gilder, 222 Wis. at 80-81. We have explained,\n\n      When the legislature deals with local affairs as\n      distinguished from matters which are primarily of\n      state-wide concern, it can only do so effectually by\n      an act which affects with uniformity every city. It is\n      true that this leaves a rather narrow field in which\n      the    home-rule   amendment    operates    freed    from\n      legislative restriction, but there is no middle\n      ground. Either the field within which the home-rule\n      amendment operates must be narrowed or the field\n      within   which   the   legislature   operates   must   be\n      narrowed, and as was pointed out in the Baxter Case,\n      the    amendment   clearly    contemplates    legislative\n      regulation of municipal affairs and there was no\n      intention on the part of the people in adopting the\n      home rule amendment to create a state within a state,\n      an imperium in imperio.\nId.   at    80-81.    When   the     Legislature       wants    to   legislate      on   a\nmatter of local affairs, it may do so if the law, on its face,\n\nuniformly affects every city or village.\n\n      ¶39    In      this    case,     the        Legislature    banned       residency\n\nrequirements         throughout      Wisconsin        by    enacting      Wis.     Stat.\n\n§ 66.0502.     We    conclude      that   Wis.      Stat.   § 66.0502     (consistent\n\n\n      regulate their own affairs. The Amendment sought to\n      cure this problem by giving cities general law-making\n      authority so the Legislature would no longer have to\n      pass such laws.\n\n\n                                             31\n\f                                                              No.     2014AP400\n\n\n\nwith the home rule amendment) uniformly affects every city or\n\nvillage. We so conclude because the plain language of Wis. Stat.\n\n§ 66.0502 demonstrates its uniform effect: Wis. Stat. § 66.0502\n\nsays that \"no local governmental unit\" may have a residency\n\nrequirement, and it goes on to define \"local governmental unit\"\n\nto mean \"any city, village, town, county, or school district\" in\n\nthe    State.   Wis.    Stat.     § 66.0502(2)-(3)    (emphasis      added).23\n\nConsequently,    Wis.    Stat.    § 66.0502     uniformly   bans    residency\n\nrequirements,    and    in   so   doing,   it   satisfies   the     home   rule\n\namendment's uniformity requirement.24\n\n\n\n       23\n       Here, the Legislature ensured that Wis. Stat. § 66.0502\nwould with uniformity affect every city or village by making\nWis. Stat. § 66.0502 apply to any city, village, town, county,\nor school district in the state. While the Legislature can\npreempt a city ordinance under the home rule amendment by making\na statute apply to all cities or villages, it is no small\ndecision to make a statute applicable to every city or village\nin the State. The Legislature must still make an important\ntrade-off when it is considering whether it should legislate on\na matter of local concern.\n       24\n       In its petition for review, the Police Association raised\ntwo additional issues:\n\n      1. May a municipality disregard legislative prohibitions on\n         certain conditions of municipal employment, by simply\n         passing an ordinance disputing the legislature's policy\n         determination and asserting [h]ome [r]ule authority to do\n         so, without first seeking a declaration as to the rights\n         and obligations of the parties?\n\n      2. Should a municipality be required to prove \"beyond a\n         reasonable doubt\" that a statute is an unconstitutional\n         overreach of its authority under the [h]ome [r]ule\n         [a]mendment?\n\n                                                                   (continued)\n                                      32\n\f                                                                        No.        2014AP400\n\n\n\n\n   B.

Because the Police Association has\n\nnot shown a deprivation of rights, privileges, or immunities\n\nprotected by the Constitution or laws of the United States, it\n\nis not entitled to relief or damages under section 1983.27\n\n\n\n\n      27\n       The Police Association appears to argue (1) that the\nCity's resolution deprived it of a non-fundamental liberty\ninterest in being free from a residency requirement and (2) that\nthis deprivation does not survive rational basis review. Even\nassuming that the first of these arguments is valid (which we do\nnot decide), the resolution survives rational basis review. The\nresolution was rationally related to the City's legitimate\ninterest in expressing its opinion on whether, pursuant to the\nhome rule amendment, section 5-02 of the City's charter trumped\nWis. Stat. § 66.0502.\n\n\n                                        40\n\f                                                                               No.    2014AP400\n\n\n\n                                    IV. CONCLUSION\n\n      ¶51    To summarize, first, we hold that Wis. Stat. § 66.0502\n\nprecludes the City from enforcing its residency requirement. The\n\nLegislature       has    the    power      to    legislate        on   matters       of    local\n\naffairs when its enactment uniformly affects every city or every\n\nvillage, notwithstanding the home rule amendment. For purposes\n\nof the home rule amendment, an enactment is uniform when it is\n\nfacially uniform. Wisconsin Stat. § 66.0502 is facially uniform\n\nbecause     it    applies      to   \"any    city,         village,     town,     county,      or\n\nschool     district.\"      Wis.     Stat.       § 66.0502        (2)   (emphasis      added).\n\nBecause Wis. Stat. § 66.0502 uniformly affects every city or\n\nvillage, it trumps section 5-02 of the City's charter. Milwaukee\n\nmay no longer enforce its residency requirement. Second, we hold\n\nthat the Police Association is not entitled to relief or damages\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Its section 1983 claim fails because the\n\nPolice Association has not met the requirements necessary to\n\nprevail     on    a     section     1983    claim.         Specifically,        the       Police\n\nAssociation has not shown a deprivation of rights, privileges,\nor   immunities       protected      by    the       Constitution       or   laws     of    the\n\nUnited States.\n\n      By    the    Court.—The       decision         of    the    court   of     appeals      is\n\naffirmed in part and reversed in part.\n\n\n\n\n                                                41\n\f                                                                          No.    2014AP400.rgb\n\n\n\n\n       ¶52    REBECCA G. BRADLEY, J.                      (concurring).        I agree that\n\nWis. Stat. § 66.0502 trumps Milwaukee's residency ordinance and\n\ntherefore I join the majority opinion.                          I write separately to\n\npoint out that the original meaning of the home rule amendment\n\nto the Wisconsin Constitution decrees a different interpretation\n\nthan this court gives.                The home rule amendment provides that:\n\n\"Cities and villages . . . may determine their local affairs and\n\ngovernment,      subject       only     to       this      constitution        and    to     such\n\nenactments      of    the    legislature             of    statewide    concern        as    with\n\nuniformity shall affect every city or every village. . . .\"\n\nWis.   Const.    art.       XI,   §    3(1).          The    majority     holds       that    the\n\nstatute      controls   over      any    conflicting           city    charter        ordinance\n\n\"either (1) when the enactment addresses a matter of statewide\n\nconcern, or (2) when the enactment with uniformity affects every\n\ncity or village.\"           Majority op., ¶26.\n\n       ¶53    I cannot agree with this interpretation based on the\n\ntext of the home rule amendment and its original meaning.                                   After\nexamining the constitutional debates and practices surrounding\n\nthe    amendment's          adoption,        I       conclude    that      a     legislative\n\nenactment preempts a conflicting city charter ordinance under\n\nthe home rule amendment only when the enactment both concerns a\n\nmatter of statewide concern and with uniformity affects every\n\ncity or village.            See Wis. Const. art. XI, § 3(1).                      Here, Wis.\n\nStat. § 66.0502 meets both the statewide concern and uniformity\n\nrequirements;        therefore,        § 66.0502          prevails     over     the    City    of\nMilwaukee's residency requirement found in section 5-02 of the\n\n                                                 1\n\f                                                                               No.    2014AP400.rgb\n\n\nCity's       charter.        As     a   result,         although    I    disagree       with    the\n\nmajority's        interpretation             and    application          of    the     home    rule\n\namendment, I agree with the end result: Wis. Stat. § 66.0502\n\nprecludes the City of Milwaukee from enforcing its residency\n\nrequirement.\n\n                 I.

Plain meaning\n\n      ¶55    To understand the original meaning of the home rule\n\namendment, I begin with the text of the amendment.                      The home\n\nrule amendment provides, in pertinent part: \"Cities and villages\n\norganized    pursuant    to    state   law       may   determine     their   local\n\naffairs and government, subject only to this constitution and to\n\nsuch enactments of the legislature of statewide concern as with\n\nuniformity shall affect every city or every village.\"                         Wis.\n\n\n      I do not address legislative interpretations to determine\n      2\n\nthe meaning of the home rule amendment because\n\n           In the performance of assigned constitutional\n      duties each branch of the Government must initially\n      interpret the Constitution, and the interpretation of\n      its powers by any branch is due great respect from the\n      others. . . . Many decisions of this Court, however,\n      have unequivocally reaffirmed the holding of Marbury\n      v.

XI, § 3(1).                  The structure of this sentence reveals\n\nthe    meaning    of    the       home    rule       amendment.        The     first      clause\n\nprovides: \"Cities and villages organized pursuant to state law\n\nmay determine their local affairs and government.\"                                       See   id.\n\nThis independent clause grants power to cities and villages to\n\ngovern      \"their     local      affairs    and      government.\"           See    id.        The\n\nsecond       clause,    a      dependent        clause,      modifies        the     preceding\n\nindependent clause and places two limitations on the grant of\n\npower to cities and villages.                   First, the constitution may limit\n\ncity or village authority to determine its local affairs.                                      The\n\nsecond limitation subordinates the power of cities and villages\n\nto:    \"such enactments of the legislature of statewide concern as\n\nwith uniformity shall affect every city or every village.\"                                     See\n\nid.    This second limitation contains two requirements evidenced\n\nby its grammatical construction.3                     The subject of this limitation\n\nis \"enactments of the legislature,\" while the verb is \"shall\n\naffect.\"       The phrase \"of statewide concern\" specifies the type\n\nof enactments that supersede local governance, and the phrase\n\"as    with     uniformity\"            specifies      how    those    enactments          \"shall\n\naffect\"       every    city       or    every    village.            Because       one    phrase\n\nmodifies the subject and the other phrase modifies the verb,\n\nboth       modifiers        are        necessary,       rather        than      unilaterally\n\nsufficient requirements.                 In other words, the text of the home\n\nrule       amendment    authorizes         cities      and    villages       to     \"determine\n\n       3\n       \"Words are to be given the meaning that proper grammar and\nusage would assign them.\"     Antonin Scalia & Bryan A.

The \"subject to\" phrase accords\n\npriority4 over local governance to both the constitution and\n\nenactments of the legislature of statewide concern, provided the\n\nuniformity requirement is met.             In the event of conflict between\n\na local enactment and either the constitution or an enactment of\n\nthe legislature (1) where the subject matter is of statewide\n\nconcern and (2) that applies with uniformity to every city and\n\nvillage, the local enactment must give way.                     The text of the\n\nhome rule amendment cannot be reasonably or grammatically read\n\nin any other way.\n\n    ¶56     Much of this court's precedent, including our recent\n\ndecision in Madison Teachers, Inc. v.

Nevertheless, the majority relies\n\nentirely    upon    the   home   rule   framework        set   forth   in   Madison\nTeachers without any attempt to explain how the text of the\n\namendment supports that framework.            The majority states:\n\n    [O]ur home rule case law instructs us that, when\n    reviewing a legislative enactment under the home rule\n    amendment, we apply a two-step analysis. First, as a\n    threshold matter, the court determines whether the\n    statute concerns a matter of primarily statewide or\n    primarily local concern.   If the statute concerns a\n    matter of primarily statewide interest, the home rule\n    amendment is not implicated and our analysis ends.\n    If, however, the statute concerns a matter of\n    4\n        Id. at 127.\n\n\n                                        5\n\f                                                                No.   2014AP400.rgb\n\n     primarily local affairs, the reviewing court then\n     examines whether the statute satisfies the uniformity\n     requirement. If the statute does not, it violates the\n     home rule amendment.\nMajority op.,       ¶25 (quoting     Madison Teachers, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wis. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n¶101) (emphasis added).           To conclude as the majority does, that\n\nanalysis of the home rule amendment stops if the legislative\n\nenactment at issue addresses an issue primarily of statewide\n\nconcern    and    that   the    uniformity     requirement   applies     only   to\n\nlegislation concerning issues primarily of local concern, simply\n\ndoes not comport with the text of the amendment.\n\n     ¶57    As emphasized above, Madison Teachers did not purport\n\nto rely on the text of the home rule amendment to craft the\n\nanalytical       framework     employed   by   the   majority    opinion    here.\n\nInstead, Madison Teachers relied on case law concerning the home\n\nrule amendment dating back to 1926.

The person who drafted the\n\nhome rule amendment specifically clarified that a legislative\n\nenactment must both involve a matter of statewide concern and\n\nwith uniformity affect every city or every village.\n\n      ¶63      In addition to the framer's interpretation of the home\n\nrule amendment, between 1919 and 1924, newspapers from across\n\nthe state published content addressing the need for a home rule\n\namendment and providing voters with information regarding the\nmeaning of home rule amendment.               For example, in 1919, Hoan, who\n\nwas then Mayor of Milwaukee, wrote a letter to the editor in\n\nsupport of the home rule amendment, which had recently failed to\n\npass the Senate by a single vote.               Daniel W. Hoan, Letter to the\n\nEditor, Voice of the People, The Capital Times, Apr. 22, 1919,\n\nat 4.    Mayor Hoan's letter strongly advocated for the passage of\n\nthe     home    rule   amendment    to        address    the   problem       of    the\nlegislature      having   to   review    numerous       proposed    bills    dealing\n\nwith purely local matters.

In    1921,    The\n\nCapital Times reported:\n\n      While the amendment was broad in its application\n      covering other cities of the state, the principle\n      purpose of passing it was to aid Milwaukee.     It is\n      estimated that over 25 percent of the measures before\n      the Wisconsin legislature directly affecting Milwaukee\n      and a home rule [] could be passed upon locally if\n      home rule were in force.\nHome Rule Amendment Is Nullified, The Capital Times, Jan. 27,\n\n1921, at 1.        Similarly, the Oshkosh Daily Northwestern reported\n\nthat according to Mayor Hoan, \"City legislation of only local\n\ninterest takes up at least a month of the legislature's time\n\neach session.\"           Income Tax Bills Posted for Hearing, Oshkosh\nDaily Northwestern, Mar. 2, 1921, at 11.

It does\n\nthis by contravening the well-recognized purpose of the Home\nRule Amendment, ignoring the evidentiary record, and creating a\n\nheretofore unknown facial uniformity rule.\n\n    ¶77     Contrary to the majority, I conclude that the city of\n\nMilwaukee may enforce its residency requirement under the powers\n\ngranted to local municipalities by the Wisconsin Constitution's\n\nHome Rule Amendment.

I dissented in Madison Teachers.\n\n      ¶119 Contrary         to    the    majority's       interpretation,         I    agree\nwith the amicus briefs of the League of Wisconsin Municipalities\n\n                                              15\n\f                                                                      No. 2014AP400.awb\n\n\nand the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, as well as the\n\nbrief      of   the   city    of    Milwaukee      and    the    unanimous      court    of\n\nappeals'        observation    that        \"the   test    articulated      in    Madison\n\nTeachers is somewhat at odds with the plain language of the home\n\nrule amendment.\"         Black, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">364</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wis. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">626</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶15.\n\n       ¶120 The majority here continues this error.                        I interpret\n\nthe home rule constitutional amendment to mean what it says:\n\nthe legislature can enact a law superseding a municipality's\n\ncharter ordinance if the law is of \"state wide concern as with\n\nuniformity shall affect every city or every village.\"8\n\n       ¶121 A legislative act must be of statewide concern and\n\nthen it must apply uniformly.                     The majority's interpretation\n\nprovides        otherwise.         It   states     that   a     legislative     act     can\n\nsupersede a city’s charter ordinance dealing with solely local\n\nmatters, with no statewide concern whatsoever, as long as it\n\ndoes       so   uniformly.         Thus,    the    majority     simply     ignores      the\n\nrequisite        \"statewide        concern\"       language      of   the     Home     Rule\n\nAmendment.\n       ¶122 Additionally, the majority also ignores the lack of\n\nuniform effect.        Although Wis. Stat. § 66.0502 does not name any\n\nparticular municipality, it will have an outsizes effect on the\n\ncity of Milwaukee for the reasons set forth above, including a\n\nprojected loss of $649 million from Milwaukee's tax base.\n\n\n\n       8\n       Because the textual analysis of the Home Rule Amendment is\nset forth in ¶4 of Justice Rebecca Bradley's concurrence, I need\nnot repeat that analysis here.\n\n\n                                             16\n\f                                                                    No. 2014AP400.awb\n\n\n      ¶123 The effect on other Wisconsin municipalities is simply\n\nnot addressed by the majority opinion.                  As the court of appeals\n\naptly states, \"the notion that a statute purporting to gut the\n\ntax   bases   and    compromise     the      neighborhood        integrity    of    all\n\nmunicipalities would pass both houses of the legislature defies\n\nlogic.\"       Id.,   ¶33.        The    majority's        newly    created      facial\n\nuniformity rule eliminates the requirement that courts review\n\nthe factual particulars of a home rule challenge.\n\n      ¶124 Under the majority opinion, the only legislation that\n\nwould not uniformly affect all municipalities is one that would\n\novertly   single      out    a   particular        city     or     village.         The\n\nlegislature is now free to search for laws unique to Milwaukee,\n\nMadison, Green Bay, or any other municipality of its choosing\n\nand   enact   facially      neutral     legislation       abrogating     individual\n\nlocal laws.\n\n      ¶125 Ultimately,        the      majority     opinion        disregards       the\n\nfundamental rule that \"we interpret the home rule amendment with\n\nan eye toward preserving the constitution.\"                       Id., ¶32 (citing\nState ex rel. Ekern v.

I    would    therefore        affirm    the     court   of   appeals\n\n                                          17\n\f                                                          No. 2014AP400.awb\n\n\ndetermination     that   Wis.
