TIFFANY GORBET\n\n              An Appeal from the Chancery Court for Madison County\n                    No. 67639     James F. Butler, Chancellor\n\n\n               No. W2011-01879-COA-R3-CV - Filed October 11, 2012\n\n\nThis is a divorce case. Prior to the parties’ marriage, the wife lived in Arkansas and the\nhusband lived in Tennessee. When the parties married, the wife quit her job in Arkansas and\nthe parties moved into a house in Tennessee. They separated after just seven months of\nmarriage, and the husband filed this complaint for divorce. After a two-day trial, the trial\ncourt declared the parties divorced and equitably divided the parties’ marital property. The\ntrial court awarded the wife transitional alimony, attorney fees as alimony in solido, and\nmoving expenses for the wife to return to Arkansas. The husband now appeals. Discerning\nno error, we affirm.\n\nTenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgment of the Chancery Court is Affirmed\n\nH OLLY M. K IRBY, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which A LAN E. H IGHERS, P.J.,\nW.S., and D AVID R. F ARMER, J., joined.\n\nDavid W. Camp, Jackson, Tennessee, for the Petitioner/Appellant Damon Gorbet\n\nEdward M. Bearman, Memphis, Tennessee, for the Respondent/Appellee Tiffany Gorbet\n\n                                        OPINION\n\nBefore the parties to this appeal met, Defendant/Appellee Tiffany Gorbet (“Wife”) lived in\na home in Bauxite, Arkansas, with her twelve-year-old daughter from a previous marriage.\nShe was employed at Baptist Health Medical Center in nearby Little Rock, Arkansas, as a\nquality management analyst. Plaintiff/Appellant Damon Gorbet (“Husband”) owned a\nconstruction company, Gorbet Construction, LLC (“Gorbet Construction”), in Jackson,\nTennessee. He lived in an apartment in Jackson and operated his business out of his home.\n\fIn 2009, Husband and Wife met through an online dating service and embarked on a long-\ndistance relationship. They became engaged in December 2009. To start their new life\ntogether, they jointly decided that, after the wedding, Wife would quit her job and move to\nJackson with her daughter to live with Husband.\n\nBefore the wedding, Husband and Wife together selected a home in Jackson, located on\nWillow Green Drive, to be the home for all of them after the parties married. On June 25,\n2010, a few weeks before the wedding, Husband closed on the Willow Green home. Wife\nwas not present at the closing. The only name on the deed to the home was Husband’s name;\nWife’s name was never added to the deed.\n\nOn July 17, 2010, the parties married in Jackson. Wife and her daughter moved into the home\non Willow Green with Husband. Wife placed her Arkansas home for sale, but the marriage\ncrumbled before it sold.\n\nThe parties’ relationship began disintegrating almost immediately after Wife and her\ndaughter moved to Jackson. On February 22, 2011, after only seven months of marriage,\nHusband moved out of the home on Willow Green.\n\nShortly after that, the parties hired lawyers and the litigation began. On March 1, 2011,\nHusband filed a complaint for divorce, accompanied by a petition for an order requiring Wife\nto vacate the marital home. On March 18, 2011, Wife countered with a motion for exclusive\nuse of the Willow Green home. Wife also filed a motion for alimony pendente lite and health\ninsurance coverage.\n\nLater the same month, the trial court held a hearing on the parties’ motions. At the\nconclusion of the hearing, the trial court entered an order denying Husband’s petition to\nrequire Wife to vacate the home on Willow Green, granting Wife’s petition for exclusive use\nof the home, and awarding Wife $2,055 per month in temporary alimony. The trial court also\nordered Husband to continue “to pay all expenses associated with the marital home including,\nbut not limited to, the house payment, utilities, [Wife’s] cell phone bill, and any yard care\nexpense associated with the upkeep of said home.”1 Discovery ensued.\n\nOn July 15 and 18, 2011, the trial court conducted a trial in this matter. The evidence\nconsisted primarily of the testimony of Husband and Wife. They gave differing perspectives\non the volatile, short-lived marriage.\n\n\n\n1\n The next month, Husband filed another motion for exclusive use of the marital home or, alternatively, for\nexclusive use of Wife’s home in Arkansas. The trial court denied that motion.\n\n                                                   -2-\n\fHusband testified that, when he and Wife decided to get married, it was understood that Wife\nand her daughter would relocate to Jackson to live with him. Husband voluntarily paid\ntuition of about $7,500 for Wife’s daughter to attend school in Jackson. Husband has a\ndaughter from a previous marriage, then about ten years old, with whom he had residential\nparenting time every other weekend.\n\nHusband said that the parties’ arguments started in the first month of their marriage. He\ndescribed Wife as erratic, explosive, verbally abusive, and at times physically violent. He\ntestified that Wife’s yelling and screaming so upset his daughter that several times he called\nhis previous wife to take the child back home before the end of his scheduled parenting time.\nHusband recounted several of Wife’s outbursts. On one occasion, he said, the administrators\nat his daughter’s school had to ask Wife to leave. Another occurred at their home on Willow\nGreen with Wife’s daughter present, in which Husband locked himself in a bedroom to get\naway from Wife, and she responded by kicking a hole in the door and breaking the door\nframe. On another occasion, Wife trashed Husband’s home office by slinging drawings,\nfiles, and other items onto the floor. Things got so bad, Husband claimed, that he began to\nvideotape Wife’s behavior with his cell phone. Three of these video recordings were\nintroduced into evidence at trial.\n\nHusband also testified about his business, Gorbet Construction. At the time of trial, Husband\nhad been the sole owner of the limited liability company for about nine years. He said that\nhe primarily builds custom homes, “[m]ostly bigger . . . more expensive homes,” and at\ntimes would purchase lots on a speculative basis, anticipating that a client may become\ninterested in building on the lot.\n\nHusband insisted that Wife was never employed by Gorbet Construction. At most, he said,\nshe helped him when they were first married by signing about twenty checks, and the two of\nthem met several prospective clients during a home show.\n\nHusband described how he operated his business and personal bank accounts. The\ncompany’s business, he said, was conducted primarily through a checking account at\nCommercial Bank in the name of Gorbet Construction, LLC.2 He also maintained a personal\nchecking account at Commercial Bank, but it was treated as a savings account to hold his\n“extra” money. Husband conceded that, although the LLC account was in the name of the\nbusiness, he used that account for both business and personal matters. He said that money\nacquired through his construction projects is deposited into the LLC’s Commercial Bank\naccount; he then pays for the costs of construction out of that account, and the remainder is\n\n\n2\nHusband said that he had business accounts at both First Tennessee Bank and The Bank of Jackson, but both\nwere maintained only for business purposes and had not been used in years.\n\n                                                  -3-\n\fretained in the same account as his profit. Rather than writing himself a paycheck out of the\nbusiness account and depositing it into a personal account, Husband explained, he just pays\nhis personal expenses out of the same account:\n\n       Q: Okay. And how do you personally get paid?\n       A: I withdraw money from the construction company [Commercial Bank\n       account].\n       Q: Do you put it into the personal account?\n       A: Well, sometimes I do that. But most of the time what happens is – I write\n       checks like I say out of Quick Books and it just shows up as a[n] owner\n       withdrawal from the company.\n       ...\n       Q: So as to paying utilities at Willow Green, . . . or paying any expenses that\n       you might incur on a personal nature, the general source of where that’s going\n       to come from will come from the LLC account at Commercial Bank?\n       A: Yeah. It doesn’t make sense to take money and put it in another account\n       and write it again. It just creates another transaction.\n       Q: I understand. What do you keep the personal account for then? . . .\n       A: Well, they have a – they pay four percent interest if you happen to have any\n       money in it. . . . So if I have any extra money I put that in there.\n       Q: So are you treating it more as a savings type account?\n       A: Yeah.\n       ...\n       Q: So Mr. Gorbet, would this be the way that you’ve conducted your business\n       during the time that you’ve been married to Mrs. Gorbet, which was July of\n       last year until now?\n       A: Sure. I’ve always done it that away [sic].\n       ...\n       Q: . . . Would those [profits] be used for the purpose of paying living expenses\n       that you and your wife were incurring while you were together?\n       A: Sure. Yeah.\n\nThe approximately $1,000 per month that Husband receives in child support from his\nprevious wife is deposited into the same LLC account. Husband said that he and Wife never\nhad a bank account in both of their names, so Wife never had access to any of Husband’s\n\n\n\n\n                                             -4-\n\fincome.3 When he moved out of the home on Willow Green in February 2011, Husband\ngave Wife $1,800 for her monthly expenses.\n\nHusband contended that the Willow Green home the parties lived in during their marriage\nshould be classified as his separate property. Husband testified that he purchased the home\nbefore the parties married, the title and mortgage were in his name only, and the mortgage\npayment every month came out of the LLC’s Commercial Bank account. Husband first said\nthat he purchased the home before the parties “even scheduled [their] wedding,” but then\nacknowledged that the closing on the home took place a few weeks before the wedding.\nHusband said that he never told Wife that she was an owner of the home.4 Husband agreed\nthat the parties’ plan when he purchased the home was to share it “as the marital home” and\nto live in “the home that we got under the same roof as a married couple.” Husband admitted\nthat Wife gave the car that she owned prior to the marriage to workmen in exchange for\n$2,000 worth of stonework performed on the home.\n\nHusband stated that Wife attempted to steal money from him after he told her that he\nintended to file for divorce. First, Wife opened a bank account at Regions Bank under the\nname “Tiffany Thompson-Gorbet d/b/a Gorbet Construction” without his authorization. Into\nthat account, she deposited two checks totaling $7,680 made out to Gorbet Construction that\nshe had taken from Husband, and two other checks, totaling $8,716, with unknown origins.\nWhen Husband discovered what Wife had done, he convinced her to return the monies to the\nrightful owners, and the account was closed. Husband also claimed that Wife wrote checks\nout of the LLC’s Commercial Bank account, to herself and to creditors, without his\nauthorization. Ultimately, Commercial Bank reversed these charges. Wife also tried to add\nherself as a signator on the LLC’s Commercial Bank account; the Bank officers refused to\nadd her without Husband’s authorization. Husband said that Wife’s “shenanigans” made the\nBank reluctant to loan him money for his business.\n\nHusband claimed that all four of the tracts of real property at issue were his separate\nproperty; he conceded that Wife’s Arkansas home was her separate property. The four pieces\nof real estate were the Willow Green home, two homes under construction on Greenhill in\nJackson, and an undeveloped lot on San Arbor Cove in Jackson (“the San Arbor property”).\nHusband said that Gorbet Construction built the Greenhill homes before the parties’ marriage\n\n3\n Perhaps epitomizing the marriage, upon the advice of a marriage counselor, Husband and Wife opened a\njoint checking account in both of their names in early 2011. Only one check was written on the account, and\nit was closed shortly thereafter.\n4\n In his trial testimony, Husband said that Wife was never upset by the fact that she was not on the title to the\nhome. In his deposition, Husband said that Wife brought up the topic of having her name added to the deed,\nand that he told her there was no need because they might sell the house in the future.\n\n                                                      -5-\n\fas speculative homes. When they did not sell, Husband rented them. The San Arbor\nproperty was purchased in February 2011, during the marriage, for a similar purpose. The\n$16,000 down payment on the San Arbor lot came out of the LLC’s Commercial Bank\naccount.\n\nHusband claimed that he earns approximately $60,000 to $70,000 per year. He testified that\nhe owned a Hummer vehicle, a Harley motorcycle, and a $162,000 annuity funded by a\nsettlement from his first marriage. Husband estimated his net worth to be about $625,000.\n\nHusband testified that, for ten years prior to the trial, he had procured a term life insurance\npolicy every year with his first wife as the beneficiary, with the understanding that the\nproceeds would go toward the support of his daughter. During his marriage to Wife, the\ninsurance company offered Husband the opportunity to convert this policy into a whole-life\npolicy, which would give him lifetime guaranteed life insurance and also have a cash value.\nHusband accepted the offer and paid the insurance company $20,000 out of the LLC’s\nCommercial Bank account to convert the policy. He said that the cash value of the policy\nwas $13,500. He maintained that the whole-life policy was his separate property; it was not\nprocured as a result of his marriage to Wife, and Wife was never intended to be the\nbeneficiary of the policy.\n\nIn his testimony, Husband acknowledged infidelity. During the marriage, he said, he had an\nextramarital affair, and he took his paramour on out-of-town trips and paid for her hotel and\nmeals. He also conceded that he initially denied the affair under oath in discovery, and only\nadmitted it after Wife discovered proof of it. Husband said that, after the parties separated,\nhe had text exchanges and telephone conversations with two former girlfriends.\n\nWife also testified at trial. She said that the parties agreed that she would move to Jackson\nafter their wedding. She testified that she quit her job in Arkansas and left her home, her\nchurch, and her family to marry Husband. Wife claimed that Husband did not want her to\nwork for a third party but, instead, wanted her to help with his construction business. She\ndid, she claimed, by running errands, signing checks, and helping Husband with a week-long\nhome show.\n\nDuring the parties’ marriage, Wife said, she had no access to Husband’s bank accounts. She\nasserted that, prior to the marriage, she had a savings account with about $20,000. She\nclaimed that she “basically lived off that the whole time [she] was . . . in Jackson. ” The\nmonies in that account were used, Wife testified, to pay her own bills, such as her car note\nand the mortgage on her Arkansas home, as well as marital expenses such as groceries,\ndinners, and household items. This account was completely used up during the parties’\nmarriage.\n\n                                              -6-\n\fWife did not deny that, at times, she had emotional outbursts and acted in an inappropriate\nmanner. She claimed that Husband provoked these incidents of anger and that he was\nphysically abusive during the marriage. Wife described an argument in which Husband\npushed her down and “busted up my face and started kicking me.” Photographs of Wife’s\nbruised legs were submitted into evidence to support this claim. She acknowledged the video\nrecordings of her that Husband submitted into evidence, but explained that they were taken\nwithout her knowledge. Typically, she asserted, Husband would go out drinking at a bar,\ncome home around 3:00 a.m., initiate a conversation with her while she was in bed, and then\nrecord the ensuing incident.\n\nWhen Wife was asked about the account that she opened at Regions Bank in her name “d/b/a\nGorbet Construction,” she declined to answer and invoked her Fifth Amendment right not\nto incriminate herself. She did assert, however, that anything that had been taken was\nreturned.\n\nWife’s proposed property distribution listed the Willow Green home in Jackson as marital\nproperty. Wife testified that, in early June 2010, she and Husband and their daughters\nselected that house to live in as a family. She said that she offered to come to the closing on\nthe home, but Husband told her that there was no need for her to be there, adding they could\n“add [her] name at any time on the title.” Wife stated that Husband never indicated to her\nthat the house was his separate property or that she had no ownership interest in it. She said\nthat she willingly gave her car to workmen in exchange for $2,000 worth of\nstonework/brickwork that was performed on the house. Wife proposed that she and Husband\nshare equally in the equity of the house.\n\nWife’s proposed property distribution also listed the San Arbor property as marital property.\nShe claimed that she and Husband purchased that lot with the intent to someday build a home\non it for themselves. She described going to the bank together to get a loan for the lot, and\nnoted that the $16,000 down payment on the property was made during the marriage out of\nthe LLC’s Commercial Bank account.\n\nWife also claimed that the cash value of Husband’s whole-life policy was marital property.\nWife said that she and Husband together decided to pay $20,000 to convert the policy to a\nwhole-life policy because it would earn a favorable interest rate. The $20,000 conversion\ncost, she stated, was paid out of the LLC Commercial Bank account. Based on her\ndiscussions with Husband prior to converting the policy, Wife mistakenly assumed that she\nwas the beneficiary on that policy.\n\nWife asked the trial court to award spousal support “[j]ust until I can get back on my feet.”\nDuring the ten or eleven years she worked in her job at the hospital in Arkansas, Wife said,\n\n                                              -7-\n\fshe had “worked [her]self up” to a position in which she earned over $32,000 per year.5\nAfter the parties separated, Wife called the hospital about getting her old job back, but she\nwas informed that the hospital was in a “hiring freeze,” and that even if she were rehired, she\nwould not be able to regain her seniority status. Wife acknowledged that she has a bachelor’s\ndegree in speech pathology and audiology, but claimed that she would need a master’s degree\nor special certification to get a job in that field. Wife claimed that she had used her best\nefforts to find a job in Arkansas while living in Jackson, but ultimately determined that she\nwould need to live in Arkansas in order to get a job there. She also claimed that Husband\nhad hindered her efforts to find employment by cutting off her phone, so prospective\nemployers could not return her telephone calls. Other than Husband’s temporary alimony\npayments, at the time of trial, Wife’s only income was the $500 per month that she received\nin child support from her former husband.6 She submitted into evidence a list of her monthly\nexpenses, which indicated that her expenses exceeded her income by $2,790 per month.\n\nWife testified that the attorney fees she incurred in the divorce were substantially increased\nby Husband’s decision not to be forthcoming in response to discovery about his relationship\nwith his paramour. In response to Husband’s denials, Wife said, she and her attorney\nattended hearings, conducted depositions, made telephone calls, reviewed telephone records,\nand engaged in other efforts to obtain proof of Husband’s extramarital conduct. Wife also\nalleged that her attorney fees were increased unnecessarily by Husband’s failure to comply\nwith his obligation to pay temporary spousal support and his failure to maintain the marital\nhome. In light of Husband’s conduct, Wife’s lack of resources, and Husband’s ability to pay,\nWife asked the trial court to award her attorney fees of $15,137.\n\nOn July 19, 2011, the trial court wrote an opinion letter setting out its decision. First, the trial\ncourt declared the parties divorced and restored Wife’s maiden name. It attached to the\nletter a chart identifying, valuing, and classifying all of the property owned by the parties as\neither separate or marital. The trial court equitably divided all of the property that was\nclassified as marital. Relevant to this appeal, the trial court classified as marital property\nthree items that Husband had claimed as his separate property: (1) the Willow Green home,\nwith equity of $60,400, (2) the San Arbor property, with equity of $16,000, and (3)\nHusband’s whole-life insurance policy, with a cash value of $13,500. Of those assets, the\ntrial court awarded Wife the following: $25,200 (42%) of the equity in the marital home;\n$8,000 (50%) of the equity in the San Arbor property; and $4,000 (30%) of the cash value\nof Husband’s whole life insurance policy. In addition, the trial court awarded Wife\n\n\n5\n Wife initially testified that she earned $37,000 per year in her job at the Arkansas hospital, but she later\nacknowledged her 2010 tax return, which showed that she earned just over $32,000 in 2009.\n6\n    Wife claimed that her daughter’s father was $7,000 behind in his child support payments.\n\n                                                     -8-\n\ftransitional alimony for two years — $1,700 per month in the first year, and $750 per month\nin the second year. The trial court reasoned that, although the marriage was one of short\nduration, Wife needed funds “to help bridge the gap for a certain period of time until she can\nreestablish [in Arkansas],” and “to soften the economic blow of the divorce . . . .” The trial\ncourt also awarded Wife attorney fees of $8,000 as alimony in solido based on its finding that\nHusband’s conduct during the divorce enhanced Wife’s fees, and because requiring Wife to\npay all of her attorney fees would negatively impact her ability to reestablish in Arkansas.\nFinally, the trial court ordered Husband to pay Wife $2,500 to defray her moving expenses.\nOn August 9, 2011, the trial court entered a final decree of divorce incorporating its letter\nruling in total. From this order, Husband now appeals.\n\n                     ISSUES ON A PPEAL AND S TANDARD OF R EVIEW\n\nHusband raises the following issues on appeal:\n\n       (1) Did the trial court err in its award of transitional alimony to Wife?\n       (2) Did the trial court err in its classification of the marital home, the San\n       Arbor property, and Husband’s whole-life insurance policy as marital property,\n       rather than separate property?\n       (3) Did the trial court err in awarding attorney fees to Wife as alimony in\n       solido?\n       (4) Did the trial court err in awarding Wife $2,500 in moving expenses?\n\nWe review the trial court’s findings of fact de novo on the record, presuming those findings\nto be correct unless the evidence preponderates otherwise. Tenn. R. App. P. 13(d); Bogan\nv. Bogan, 60 S.W.3d 721, 727 (Tenn. 2001); Hass v. Knighton, 676 S.W.2d 554, 555 (Tenn.\n1984). When “the trial court’s factual determinations are based on its assessment of witness\ncredibility, this Court will not reevaluate that assessment absent clear and convincing\nevidence to the contrary.” Heffington v. Heffington, No. M2009-00434-COA-R3-CV, 2010\nWL 623629, at *2 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 19, 2010) (citing Jones v. Garrett, 92 S.W.3d 835,\n838 (Tenn. 2002)). We review a trial court’s conclusions of law de novo, with no\npresumption of correctness. Whaley v. Perkins, 197 S.W.3d 665, 670 (Tenn. 2006); Union\nCarbide Corp. v. Huddleston, 854 S.W.2d 87, 91 (Tenn. 1993).\n\n                                         A NALYSIS\n\n                                   Transitional Alimony\n\nHusband first challenges the trial court’s award of transitional alimony to Wife. He\nemphasizes that this was a marriage of short duration; the parties were married only 220 days\n\n                                             -9-\n\fbefore they separated. Husband also notes that Wife received $25,620 in temporary alimony\nbefore trial, which included $2,055 per month paid directly to her, as well as Husband’s\npayment of numerous bills for Wife’s benefit. He argues that, during all of this time, Wife\nhas had the ability to earn a living, given her education and past work experience, pointing\nout that she earned over $32,000 per year at her former job. Husband insinuates that, after\nthe marriage failed, Wife’s efforts to obtain work in Arkansas were perfunctory, noting that\nWife frequently traveled back to Arkansas for visits but “never arranged for an interview”\nwhile there. Husband challenges the trial court’s credibility determination in favor of Wife,\nparticularly in light of Wife’s attempted thievery by opening a Regions Bank account with\nchecks made out to Gorbet Construction. For these reasons, Husband argues, the facts of this\ncase do not support the trial court’s decision to award Wife transitional alimony.\n\nUnder the Tennessee statutes governing alimony, a trial court is authorized to award alimony\nin divorce cases “to be paid by one spouse to or for the benefit of the other, or out of either\nspouse’s property, according to the nature of the case and the circumstances of the parties.”\nTenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(a) (Supp. 2012). The statute provides: “The court may fix some\ndefinite amount or amounts to be paid in monthly, semimonthly or weekly installments, or\notherwise, as the circumstances may warrant.” Id. All relevant factors, including the\nstatutory factors listed in Tennessee Code Annotated § 36-5-121(i), must be considered in\ndetermining whether alimony should be awarded to the relatively disadvantaged spouse and,\nif so, “the nature, amount, length of term, and manner of payment” of such an award.\n\nThe most important factors for a trial court faced with an alimony decision are the obligee\nspouse’s need for the alimony and the obligor spouse’s ability to pay. Bogan, 60 S.W.3d at\n730; Riggs v. Riggs, 250 S.W.3d 453, 457 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2007). The trial court “is afforded\nwide discretion regarding the award of spousal support, and we will reverse the court’s\nfindings only upon determining that such discretion ‘has manifestly been abused.’” Hill v.\nHill, M2007-00471-COA-R3-CV, 2008 WL 1822453, at *7 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 23, 2008)\n(citing Hanover v. Hanover, 775 S.W.2d 612, 617 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1989)).\n\nThe statute specifically authorizes trial courts to award “transitional” alimony where\nwarranted. Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(d)(1). Transitional alimony is appropriate “when\nthe court finds that rehabilitation is not necessary, but the economically disadvantaged spouse\nneeds assistance to adjust to the economic consequences of a divorce . . . .” Tenn. Code Ann.\n§ 36-5-121(g). In this case, the trial court explained that, although this was admittedly a\nshort marriage, Wife was in need of transitional alimony:\n\n       While the Court is aware that this is a short marriage, Wife is temporarily\n       economically disadvantaged from the Husband, and has been detrimentally\n       effected [sic] by the breakdown of the marriage more so than normal since she\n\n                                             -10-\n\f       gave up her job and her living situation in Arkansas to move to Jackson with\n       her Husband. As a result, she must go back and start over. She will need\n       funds to help bridge the gap for a certain period of time until she can\n       reestablish. It is appropriate that Husband contribute to Wife in order to soften\n       the economic blow of the divorce on the Wife. Husband has sufficient funds\n       to pay transitional alimony.\n\nWe first dispense with Husband’s argument that we should disregard the trial court’s\ncredibility determinations in this case. The trial court is afforded wide discretion in assessing\nwitnesses’ credibility, and we are bound by its credibility determinations in the absence of\nclear and convincing evidence to the contrary. Sullivan v. Sullivan, 107 S.W.3d 507, 510\n(Tenn. Ct. App. 2002). Wife’s actions with respect to the Regions Bank account, while\ndubious, do not amount to the clear and convincing evidence necessary for us to put aside the\ntrial court’s credibility findings. Thus, we consider the evidence in the record, giving\nappropriate deference to the trial court’s view of the parties’ credibility.\n\nOn the propriety of the trial court’s award, Husband rightly emphasizes the short duration of\nthe marriage and the fact that Wife is educated and has ample work experience to support\nherself. Nevertheless, we are not persuaded that the trial court abused its discretion in\nawarding transitional alimony under the circumstances of this case. When the parties decided\nto marry, Wife moved from her home state and left a stable job with eleven years of seniority\nto start a life with Husband in Jackson, Tennessee. Thus, as noted by the trial court, Wife\nwas uprooted from her home and job in Arkansas because of the marriage, and as a\nconsequence suffered more than the normal amount of detrimental effect from the demise\nof the marriage. Wife testified that her former job in Arkansas was unavailable, and that\neven if she were rehired, the seniority status she had earned would be forfeited. She testified\nthat her attempts to find employment in Arkansas had thus far been fruitless, and that she\nhad concluded that she could not find a job in Arkansas until she completed her move there.\nIn our view, this is precisely the type of situation for which transitional alimony was\nintended.\n\nIn the alternative, Husband argues that, even if this Court holds that the trial court did not err\nin awarding transitional alimony, the amount of alimony award was unwarranted. We\ndisagree; we find that the amount awarded was well within the trial court’s discretion. An\naward of $1,700 per month for one year helps enable Wife to pay her house note and her car\nnote for the first year, while leaving her only about $700 per month for all of her other\nexpenses. According to the evidence in the record on Wife’s reported expenses, this amount\nof transitional alimony still leaves her with a shortfall of about $1,000 per month. The\nstepped-down award of $750 per month in the second year is not unreasonable to ease her\ntransition, and the evidence indicates that this amount is well within Husband’s means to pay.\n\n                                              -11-\n\fUnder the circumstances, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s award of\ntransitional alimony.\n\n                                 Classification of Property\n\nHusband next challenges the trial court’s holding that several disputed properties were\nmarital property. Our Supreme Court has explained why the classification of the parties’\nproperty is key to the equitable division of property in a divorce case:\n\n       Tennessee is a “dual property” state because its domestic relations law\n       recognizes both “marital property” and “separate property.” See generally\n       Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-121; Eldridge v. Eldridge, 137 S.W.3d 1, 12 (Tenn.\n       Ct. App. 2002). When a married couple seeks a divorce, the “marital\n       property” must be divided equitably between them, without regard to fault on\n       the part of either party. Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-121(a)(1). “Separate\n       property” is not part of the marital estate and is therefore not subject to\n       division. See Cutsinger, 917 S.W.2d at 241. Thus, it is imperative that the\n       parties, the trial court, or both identify all of the assets possessed by the\n       divorcing parties as either marital or separate so that a proper division can be\n       accomplished.\n\nSnodgrass v. Snodgrass, 295 S.W.3d 240, 246 (Tenn. 2009). Broadly speaking, “separate\nproperty” is “[a]ll real and personal property owned by a spouse before marriage . . . .” Tenn.\nCode Ann. § 36-4-121(b)(2)(A). “Marital property” is defined as “all real and personal\nproperty, both tangible and intangible, acquired by either or both spouses during the course\nof the marriage up to the date of the final divorce hearing and owned by either or both\nspouses as of the date of filing of a complaint for divorce . . . .” Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-\n121(b)(1)(A). As discussed below, a party’s separate property may become marital property\nvia the doctrine of comingling or the doctrine of transmutation.\n\nThe trial court’s classification and division of property is a finding of fact, which we presume\nto be correct unless the evidence preponderates otherwise. Dunlap v. Dunlap, 996 S.W.2d\n803, 814 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1998); Dellinger v. Dellinger, 958 S.W.2d 778, 780 (Tenn. Ct.\nApp. 1997).\n\nThe properties that Husband argues were erroneously classified as marital property are: (1)\nthe Willow Green home, (2) the San Arbor property, and (3) Husband’s whole-life insurance\npolicy. We will address each of these items in turn.\n\n\n\n\n                                              -12-\n\f                                      Willow Green Home\n\nThe trial court held that the home on Willow Green, in which the parties lived together, was\nHusband’s separate property when it was purchased, but that it became marital property by\nvirtue of transmutation. In its letter ruling, the trial court stated that, “[p]rior to the marriage,\nthe parties jointly picked out [the Willow Green house] to be their marital home,” and that\nthe house “purchase closed one week prior to the marriage and they moved in.” The trial\ncourt’s attachment to the letter ruling summarized the factual findings that formed the basis\nfor its conclusion that the house had become marital property through transmutation:\n\n       Bought one week prior to marriage–Wife & Husband selected it–Moved in\n       after marriage–Utilized as marital home–Mortgage paid by Husband with\n       money earned during marriage–Marital Property by virtue of Transmutation.\n\nThe trial court determined that the marital home was worth $291,900, and that the parties had\n$60,400 equity in the home. Wife was awarded $25,200, 42% of the equity in the home.\n\nHusband argues that the evidence preponderates against the trial court’s finding that the\nWillow Green home was transmuted into marital property, because the home was purchased\nin his name only, and he lived with Wife in the home for only 220 days. He claims that\ntransmutation is not triggered solely based on the fact that Husband and Wife are residing in\nthe property together. See Patton v. Patton, No. 03A01-9601-CH-00001, 1996 WL 377087,\nat *2 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 8, 1996) (finding that separate property did not become marital\nproperty simply because parties lived in the home together for nine years, when the evidence\nshowed that “husband intended that this property be his separate property”).\n\n“[S]eparate property can become part of the marital estate due to the parties’ treatment of the\nseparate property.” Eldridge v. Eldridge, 137 S.W.3d 1, 13 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2002).\nDepending on how the property is treated, separate property can become marital property\neither through the doctrines of commingling or transmutation. Id. The related doctrines of\ncommingling and transmutation were explained in Langschmidt v. Langschmidt:\n\n       [S]eparate property becomes marital property [by commingling] if inextricably\n       mingled with marital property or with the separate property of the other\n       spouse. If the separate property continues to be segregated or can be traced\n       into its product, commingling does not occur. . . . [Transmutation] occurs\n       when separate property is treated in such a way as to give evidence of an\n       intention that it become marital property. . . . The rationale underlying these\n       doctrines is that dealing with property in these ways creates a rebuttable\n       presumption of a gift to the marital estate. This presumption is based also\n\n                                                -13-\n\f        upon the provision in many marital property statutes that property acquired\n        during the marriage is presumed to be marital. The presumption can be\n        rebutted by evidence of circumstances or communications clearly indicating\n        an intent that the property remain separate.\n\n81 S.W.3d 741, 747 (Tenn. 2002) (quoting 2 Homer H. Clark, The Law of Domestic\nRelations in the United States § 16.2 at 185 (2d ed. 1987)); see Batson v. Batson, 769\nS.W.2d 849, 858 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1988); see also Snodgrass, 295 S.W.3d at 256-57.\n\nIn our view, the evidence in the record supports the trial court’s finding that the Willow\nGreen home became marital property through the doctrine of transmutation. As noted by the\ntrial court, the house began as separate property; it was purchased by Husband prior to the\nmarriage and is titled in his name only. However, it is undisputed that Husband and Wife\nselected the house together, while they were engaged to be married, for the purpose of living\nin it together with their daughters as a family. They in fact moved into the home together\nafter they married; Husband paid the mortgage with funds earned during the marriage, and\nHusband acknowledged that Wife contributed her vehicle as payment for work done on the\nhome. Unlike the Patton case cited by Husband, in the case at bar, Husband submitted no\nevidence indicating that he intended to keep this property as his separate property after he\nmarried Wife. See Patton, 1996 WL 377087, at *2. Rather, in the instant case, Husband’s\nintent to keep the home as his separate property surfaced only after the demise of the\nmarriage.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the trial court’s holding that the Willow Green home in Jackson\nbecame marital property through the doctrine of transmutation.7\n\n                                      The San Arbor Property\n\nThe trial court held that the undeveloped lot at 25 San Arbor was marital property. In the\nattachment to the trial court’s letter ruling, its notation on this property states: “Unimproved\nlot purchased during marriage — Husband’s company paid $16,000 down and financed the\nbalance — This is Marital Property.” The summary of facts in the trial court’s letter ruling\nstates: “Since Husband was the sole member of the [Gorbet Construction] LLC, it was\nnormal for him to pay personal expenses out of the company’s account, both prior to and\nafter the marriage.” The trial court determined that the San Arbor property was worth\n\n\n\n7\n Husband does not challenge the proportion of the value of the marital home that was awarded to Wife;\nrather, he argues in his appellate brief that the trial court erred “in awarding [W]ife any portion of the\nproperty” based on its classification of the home as marital property.\n\n                                                  -14-\n\f$72,000, and that the parties had $16,000 equity in it. The trial court awarded Wife $8,000,\n50% of the equity in the property.\n\nHusband argues that the evidence preponderates against the trial court’s finding that the San\nArbor property was marital property subject to equitable division. He asserts that, as the trial\ncourt found, the property was purchased by Gorbet Construction – the LLC, not Husband\nindividually – with money from the LLC’s Commercial Bank account. Husband claims that\nWife had no interest in the construction company, nor did she have any interest in the Gorbet\nConstruction bank account. Because the lot was purchased with separate funds owned\nentirely by the business, Husband insists, the lot was separate and should have been classified\nas such.\n\nIn response, Wife asserts that the lot is marital property because it was purchased during the\nmarriage with marital funds. She points out that the bank account used to purchase this\nproperty was also used as a personal account by Husband. All of the funds earned by\nHusband during the marriage were deposited into this account, and personal bills were paid\nduring the marriage out of this account. Therefore, Wife argues, “[b]ecause the funds used\nto purchase [the property] were either proceeds from sales made during the marriage or\ncommingled with such proceeds, the funds, themselves, were marital property and any\npurchase made [with] those funds is similarly marital property subject to property division\nby the Court.”\n\nAs we have indicated, marital property is “all real and personal property, both tangible and\nintangible, acquired by either or both spouses during the course of the marriage . . . .” Tenn.\nCode Ann. § 36-4-121(b)(1)(A). Thus, the money Husband earned through Gorbet\nConstruction during the marriage was marital property. Wade v. Wade, 897 S.W.2d 702, 716\n(Tenn. Ct. App. 1994). By the same token, property purchased during the marriage with\nmarital earnings is marital property, absent evidence that the property was intended to be the\nseparate property of one spouse. Id. at 717.\n\nAs noted above, Husband’s earnings during the marriage constituted marital property.\nMoreover, Husband’s business earnings were deposited into the Gorbet Construction\nCommercial Bank checking account, out of which he paid all of his personal bills, both\nbefore and after the marriage. The $16,000 down payment for the San Arbor property was\nmade with money from the Commercial Bank account, which contained Husband’s earnings,\ni.e., marital property. The San Arbor property was acquired during the marriage. Under all\n\n\n\n\n                                              -15-\n\fof these circumstances, we cannot conclude that the evidence preponderates against the trial\ncourt’s finding that the San Arbor property should be classified as marital property.8\n\n                             Husband’s Whole-Life Insurance Policy\n\nThe trial court held that the cash value of Husband’s whole-life insurance policy was a\nmarital asset. It noted, however, that Wife made no monetary contribution to the policy.\nConsistent with Husband’s testimony, the trial court found that the cash value of the policy\nwas $13,500. It awarded Wife $4,000, 30% of the cash value, and awarded Husband $9,500,\n70% of the cash value.9\n\nHusband argues that the trial court erred in classifying the whole-life policy as marital\nproperty, because the policy was initially purchased when he divorced his first wife, and it\nwas intended solely for the benefit of his daughter. Wife was never made the beneficiary of\nthis policy, nor was she ever intended to be the beneficiary. Therefore, Husband maintains,\nbecause the policy came into existence prior to the marriage, and because Wife made no\nmonetary contribution to the policy, the policy cannot be classified as marital property.\n\nThe undisputed evidence in the record shows that, during Husband’s marriage to Wife,\nHusband paid $20,000 to convert the pre-existing term life insurance policy into a whole-life\npolicy. Once the term policy was converted to a whole-life policy, it became an asset to the\npolicyholder, and it had a present cash value. As with the San Arbor property, this asset was\nacquired with funds from the LLC Commercial Bank checking account, which contained the\nmonies Husband earned during the marriage. Thus, the whole-life policy was acquired\nduring the marriage with marital funds.\n\nUnder all of these circumstances, we cannot conclude that the evidence preponderates against\nthe trial court’s decision to classify the term-life policy as marital property.\n\n\n8\n We are mindful that the trial court classified the LLC’s Commercial Bank account as Husband’s separate\nproperty. The trial court’s classification of the Commercial Bank account as separate was not directly\nchallenged on appeal. However, the undisputed evidence shows that Husband’s earnings during the marriage\n– which are marital property – were deposited into this account. “[W]hatever Husband earned during the\nmarriage, regardless of the bank account into which it was deposited, remains marital property.” Wade, 897\nS.W.2d at 716. The trial court noted specifically that Husband treated the LLC account as both a business\nand a personal account, and it is undisputed that the San Arbor property was purchased with those funds\nduring the marriage. While we note this inconsistency in the trial court’s findings, the preponderance of the\nevidence clearly supports the trial court’s finding that the San Arbor property was marital property.\n9\n Husband does not challenge the trial court’s equitable division of the value of the policy, only its\nclassification as marital property.\n\n                                                    -16-\n\f                           Attorney Fees as Alimony In Solido\n\nThe trial court awarded Wife $8,000 in attorney fees as alimony in solido. It explained that\nit made the award because Wife’s “fees have been enhanced by virtue of the Husband’s\nconduct during the pendency of the divorce,” and because, “[w]hile Wife will have some\nfunds available to her, she will not have sufficient funds to compensate her attorney for\nerecting a proper defense and prosecution of her Counter-Complaint.” The trial court further\nreasoned that, “[t]o require [Wife] to pay all of her fees would impact her ability to\nreestablish after the divorce.”\n\nHusband argues that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding Wife $8,000 in attorney\nfees as alimony in solido, because she had already received over $10,000 in alimony\npendente lite, and she had also received other benefits by virtue of the fact that Husband paid\nall of her bills during the pendency of the litigation. Husband also asserts that Wife received\nenough transitional alimony out of which to pay her attorney fees; he points out that, by the\nend of the second year, Wife would have received a total of $29,400 in transitional alimony.\nIn addition, Wife was awarded the Arkansas home as her separate property, with equity of\n$36,000, her car with equity of $2,950, and other property out of which she could pay her\nattorney fees. Therefore, Husband argues, the trial court erred in awarding Wife attorney\nfees as alimony in solido.\n\nThe decision about whether to award attorney fees as alimony in solido is within the sound\ndiscretion of the trial court, and such an award will not be disturbed on appeal unless the\nevidence preponderates against factual findings that support the trial court’s decision.\nKincaid v. Kincaid, 912 S.W.2d 140, 144 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1995); Storey v. Storey, 835\nS.W.2d 593, 597 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1992). As with any alimony award, in deciding whether\nto award attorney fees as alimony in solido, the trial court should consider the factors\nenumerated in Section 36-5-121(i). Gonsewski v. Gonsewski, 350 S.W.3d 99, 113 (Tenn.\n2011). A spouse with adequate property and income is not entitled to an award of alimony\nto pay attorney fees and expenses, but such an award is appropriate where the disadvantaged\nspouse lacks sufficient funds to pay his or her own fees. Id. In addition, a trial court may\nbase an award of attorney fees on a finding that the attorney fees incurred by one spouse were\nenhanced by the other spouse’s litigious conduct or obstructive tactics. See Gilliam v.\nGilliam, 776 S.W.2d 81, 86-87 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1989).\n\nWe find that there is ample evidence in the record to support the award of attorney fees as\nalimony in solido. At the time of trial, Wife had no income other than the transitional\nalimony awarded and the somewhat erratic child support payments from her former husband.\nThe trial court correctly observed that requiring Wife to shoulder the total amount of the\nattorney fees she incurred would negatively impact her ability to reestablish herself in\n\n                                             -17-\n\fArkansas after the parties’ divorce. Moreover, Husband conveniently ignores the trial court’s\ndetermination that Wife’s fees were enhanced by his conduct in discovery on the question\nof his infidelity, which determination is supported in the record.\n\nBased on our review of the record, we find no abuse of the trial court’s discretion in\nawarding Wife $8,000 as alimony in solido.\n\n                                     Moving Expenses\n\nFinally, Husband argues that the trial court erred in awarding Wife $2,500 in moving\nexpenses. He contends that the amount of the award was based on speculative and unreliable\nestimates. We disagree. At trial, Husband conceded that he should pay Wife’s moving\nexpenses, and he testified that he received an estimate from a moving company of between\n$1,700 and $2,000 to complete the move. Wife testified that she obtained estimates from\nfour moving companies, and that the average cost from all four was $2,500. The trial court\nwas entitled to credit Wife’s testimony on this issue. Therefore, we find no error in the trial\ncourt’s award to Wife of $2,500 in moving expenses.\n\n                                        C ONCLUSION\n\nThe decision of the trial court is affirmed. Costs on appeal are to be taxed to Appellant\nDamon Gorbet and his surety, for which execution may issue, if necessary.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    _________________________________\n                                                    HOLLY M.

Butler, Chancellor\n\n\n               No. W2011-01879-COA-R3-CV - Filed October 11, 2012\n\n\nThis is a divorce case. Prior to the parties’ marriage, the wife lived in Arkansas and the\nhusband lived in Tennessee. When the parties married, the wife quit her job in Arkansas and\nthe parties moved into a house in Tennessee. They separated after just seven months of\nmarriage, and the husband filed this complaint for divorce. After a two-day trial, the trial\ncourt declared the parties divorced and equitably divided the parties’ marital property. The\ntrial court awarded the wife transitional alimony, attorney fees as alimony in solido, and\nmoving expenses for the wife to return to Arkansas. The husband now appeals. Discerning\nno error, we affirm.\n\nTenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgment of the Chancery Court is Affirmed\n\nH OLLY M. K IRBY, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which A LAN E.

Bearman, Memphis, Tennessee, for the Respondent/Appellee Tiffany Gorbet\n\n                                        OPINION\n\nBefore the parties to this appeal met, Defendant/Appellee Tiffany Gorbet (“Wife”) lived in\na home in Bauxite, Arkansas, with her twelve-year-old daughter from a previous marriage.\nShe was employed at Baptist Health Medical Center in nearby Little Rock, Arkansas, as a\nquality management analyst. Plaintiff/Appellant Damon Gorbet (“Husband”) owned a\nconstruction company, Gorbet Construction, LLC (“Gorbet Construction”), in Jackson,\nTennessee. He lived in an apartment in Jackson and operated his business out of his home.\n\fIn 2009, Husband and Wife met through an online dating service and embarked on a long-\ndistance relationship. They became engaged in December 2009. To start their new life\ntogether, they jointly decided that, after the wedding, Wife would quit her job and move to\nJackson with her daughter to live with Husband.\n\nBefore the wedding, Husband and Wife together selected a home in Jackson, located on\nWillow Green Drive, to be the home for all of them after the parties married. On June 25,\n2010, a few weeks before the wedding, Husband closed on the Willow Green home. Wife\nwas not present at the closing. The only name on the deed to the home was Husband’s name;\nWife’s name was never added to the deed.\n\nOn July 17, 2010, the parties married in Jackson. Wife and her daughter moved into the home\non Willow Green with Husband. Wife placed her Arkansas home for sale, but the marriage\ncrumbled before it sold.\n\nThe parties’ relationship began disintegrating almost immediately after Wife and her\ndaughter moved to Jackson. On February 22, 2011, after only seven months of marriage,\nHusband moved out of the home on Willow Green.\n\nShortly after that, the parties hired lawyers and the litigation began. On March 1, 2011,\nHusband filed a complaint for divorce, accompanied by a petition for an order requiring Wife\nto vacate the marital home. On March 18, 2011, Wife countered with a motion for exclusive\nuse of the Willow Green home. Wife also filed a motion for alimony pendente lite and health\ninsurance coverage.\n\nLater the same month, the trial court held a hearing on the parties’ motions. At the\nconclusion of the hearing, the trial court entered an order denying Husband’s petition to\nrequire Wife to vacate the home on Willow Green, granting Wife’s petition for exclusive use\nof the home, and awarding Wife $2,055 per month in temporary alimony. The trial court also\nordered Husband to continue “to pay all expenses associated with the marital home including,\nbut not limited to, the house payment, utilities, [Wife’s] cell phone bill, and any yard care\nexpense associated with the upkeep of said home.”1 Discovery ensued.\n\nOn July 15 and 18, 2011, the trial court conducted a trial in this matter. The evidence\nconsisted primarily of the testimony of Husband and Wife. They gave differing perspectives\non the volatile, short-lived marriage.\n\n\n\n1\n The next month, Husband filed another motion for exclusive use of the marital home or, alternatively, for\nexclusive use of Wife’s home in Arkansas. The trial court denied that motion.\n\n                                                   -2-\n\fHusband testified that, when he and Wife decided to get married, it was understood that Wife\nand her daughter would relocate to Jackson to live with him. Husband voluntarily paid\ntuition of about $7,500 for Wife’s daughter to attend school in Jackson. Husband has a\ndaughter from a previous marriage, then about ten years old, with whom he had residential\nparenting time every other weekend.\n\nHusband said that the parties’ arguments started in the first month of their marriage. He\ndescribed Wife as erratic, explosive, verbally abusive, and at times physically violent. He\ntestified that Wife’s yelling and screaming so upset his daughter that several times he called\nhis previous wife to take the child back home before the end of his scheduled parenting time.\nHusband recounted several of Wife’s outbursts. On one occasion, he said, the administrators\nat his daughter’s school had to ask Wife to leave. Another occurred at their home on Willow\nGreen with Wife’s daughter present, in which Husband locked himself in a bedroom to get\naway from Wife, and she responded by kicking a hole in the door and breaking the door\nframe. On another occasion, Wife trashed Husband’s home office by slinging drawings,\nfiles, and other items onto the floor. Things got so bad, Husband claimed, that he began to\nvideotape Wife’s behavior with his cell phone. Three of these video recordings were\nintroduced into evidence at trial.\n\nHusband also testified about his business, Gorbet Construction. At the time of trial, Husband\nhad been the sole owner of the limited liability company for about nine years. He said that\nhe primarily builds custom homes, “[m]ostly bigger . . . more expensive homes,” and at\ntimes would purchase lots on a speculative basis, anticipating that a client may become\ninterested in building on the lot.\n\nHusband insisted that Wife was never employed by Gorbet Construction. At most, he said,\nshe helped him when they were first married by signing about twenty checks, and the two of\nthem met several prospective clients during a home show.\n\nHusband described how he operated his business and personal bank accounts. The\ncompany’s business, he said, was conducted primarily through a checking account at\nCommercial Bank in the name of Gorbet Construction, LLC.2 He also maintained a personal\nchecking account at Commercial Bank, but it was treated as a savings account to hold his\n“extra” money. Husband conceded that, although the LLC account was in the name of the\nbusiness, he used that account for both business and personal matters. He said that money\nacquired through his construction projects is deposited into the LLC’s Commercial Bank\naccount; he then pays for the costs of construction out of that account, and the remainder is\n\n\n2\nHusband said that he had business accounts at both First Tennessee Bank and The Bank of Jackson, but both\nwere maintained only for business purposes and had not been used in years.\n\n                                                  -3-\n\fretained in the same account as his profit. Rather than writing himself a paycheck out of the\nbusiness account and depositing it into a personal account, Husband explained, he just pays\nhis personal expenses out of the same account:\n\n       Q: Okay. And how do you personally get paid?\n       A: I withdraw money from the construction company [Commercial Bank\n       account].\n       Q: Do you put it into the personal account?\n       A: Well, sometimes I do that. But most of the time what happens is – I write\n       checks like I say out of Quick Books and it just shows up as a[n] owner\n       withdrawal from the company.\n       ...\n       Q: So as to paying utilities at Willow Green, . . . or paying any expenses that\n       you might incur on a personal nature, the general source of where that’s going\n       to come from will come from the LLC account at Commercial Bank?\n       A: Yeah. It doesn’t make sense to take money and put it in another account\n       and write it again. It just creates another transaction.\n       Q: I understand. What do you keep the personal account for then? . . .\n       A: Well, they have a – they pay four percent interest if you happen to have any\n       money in it. . . . So if I have any extra money I put that in there.\n       Q: So are you treating it more as a savings type account?\n       A: Yeah.\n       ...\n       Q: So Mr. Gorbet, would this be the way that you’ve conducted your business\n       during the time that you’ve been married to Mrs. Gorbet, which was July of\n       last year until now?\n       A: Sure. I’ve always done it that away [sic].\n       ...\n       Q: . . . Would those [profits] be used for the purpose of paying living expenses\n       that you and your wife were incurring while you were together?\n       A: Sure. Yeah.\n\nThe approximately $1,000 per month that Husband receives in child support from his\nprevious wife is deposited into the same LLC account. Husband said that he and Wife never\nhad a bank account in both of their names, so Wife never had access to any of Husband’s\n\n\n\n\n                                             -4-\n\fincome.3 When he moved out of the home on Willow Green in February 2011, Husband\ngave Wife $1,800 for her monthly expenses.\n\nHusband contended that the Willow Green home the parties lived in during their marriage\nshould be classified as his separate property. Husband testified that he purchased the home\nbefore the parties married, the title and mortgage were in his name only, and the mortgage\npayment every month came out of the LLC’s Commercial Bank account. Husband first said\nthat he purchased the home before the parties “even scheduled [their] wedding,” but then\nacknowledged that the closing on the home took place a few weeks before the wedding.\nHusband said that he never told Wife that she was an owner of the home.4 Husband agreed\nthat the parties’ plan when he purchased the home was to share it “as the marital home” and\nto live in “the home that we got under the same roof as a married couple.” Husband admitted\nthat Wife gave the car that she owned prior to the marriage to workmen in exchange for\n$2,000 worth of stonework performed on the home.\n\nHusband stated that Wife attempted to steal money from him after he told her that he\nintended to file for divorce. First, Wife opened a bank account at Regions Bank under the\nname “Tiffany Thompson-Gorbet d/b/a Gorbet Construction” without his authorization. Into\nthat account, she deposited two checks totaling $7,680 made out to Gorbet Construction that\nshe had taken from Husband, and two other checks, totaling $8,716, with unknown origins.\nWhen Husband discovered what Wife had done, he convinced her to return the monies to the\nrightful owners, and the account was closed. Husband also claimed that Wife wrote checks\nout of the LLC’s Commercial Bank account, to herself and to creditors, without his\nauthorization. Ultimately, Commercial Bank reversed these charges. Wife also tried to add\nherself as a signator on the LLC’s Commercial Bank account; the Bank officers refused to\nadd her without Husband’s authorization. Husband said that Wife’s “shenanigans” made the\nBank reluctant to loan him money for his business.\n\nHusband claimed that all four of the tracts of real property at issue were his separate\nproperty; he conceded that Wife’s Arkansas home was her separate property. The four pieces\nof real estate were the Willow Green home, two homes under construction on Greenhill in\nJackson, and an undeveloped lot on San Arbor Cove in Jackson (“the San Arbor property”).\nHusband said that Gorbet Construction built the Greenhill homes before the parties’ marriage\n\n3\n Perhaps epitomizing the marriage, upon the advice of a marriage counselor, Husband and Wife opened a\njoint checking account in both of their names in early 2011. Only one check was written on the account, and\nit was closed shortly thereafter.\n4\n In his trial testimony, Husband said that Wife was never upset by the fact that she was not on the title to the\nhome. In his deposition, Husband said that Wife brought up the topic of having her name added to the deed,\nand that he told her there was no need because they might sell the house in the future.\n\n                                                      -5-\n\fas speculative homes. When they did not sell, Husband rented them. The San Arbor\nproperty was purchased in February 2011, during the marriage, for a similar purpose. The\n$16,000 down payment on the San Arbor lot came out of the LLC’s Commercial Bank\naccount.\n\nHusband claimed that he earns approximately $60,000 to $70,000 per year. He testified that\nhe owned a Hummer vehicle, a Harley motorcycle, and a $162,000 annuity funded by a\nsettlement from his first marriage. Husband estimated his net worth to be about $625,000.\n\nHusband testified that, for ten years prior to the trial, he had procured a term life insurance\npolicy every year with his first wife as the beneficiary, with the understanding that the\nproceeds would go toward the support of his daughter. During his marriage to Wife, the\ninsurance company offered Husband the opportunity to convert this policy into a whole-life\npolicy, which would give him lifetime guaranteed life insurance and also have a cash value.\nHusband accepted the offer and paid the insurance company $20,000 out of the LLC’s\nCommercial Bank account to convert the policy. He said that the cash value of the policy\nwas $13,500. He maintained that the whole-life policy was his separate property; it was not\nprocured as a result of his marriage to Wife, and Wife was never intended to be the\nbeneficiary of the policy.\n\nIn his testimony, Husband acknowledged infidelity. During the marriage, he said, he had an\nextramarital affair, and he took his paramour on out-of-town trips and paid for her hotel and\nmeals. He also conceded that he initially denied the affair under oath in discovery, and only\nadmitted it after Wife discovered proof of it. Husband said that, after the parties separated,\nhe had text exchanges and telephone conversations with two former girlfriends.\n\nWife also testified at trial. She said that the parties agreed that she would move to Jackson\nafter their wedding. She testified that she quit her job in Arkansas and left her home, her\nchurch, and her family to marry Husband. Wife claimed that Husband did not want her to\nwork for a third party but, instead, wanted her to help with his construction business. She\ndid, she claimed, by running errands, signing checks, and helping Husband with a week-long\nhome show.\n\nDuring the parties’ marriage, Wife said, she had no access to Husband’s bank accounts. She\nasserted that, prior to the marriage, she had a savings account with about $20,000. She\nclaimed that she “basically lived off that the whole time [she] was . . . in Jackson. ” The\nmonies in that account were used, Wife testified, to pay her own bills, such as her car note\nand the mortgage on her Arkansas home, as well as marital expenses such as groceries,\ndinners, and household items. This account was completely used up during the parties’\nmarriage.\n\n                                              -6-\n\fWife did not deny that, at times, she had emotional outbursts and acted in an inappropriate\nmanner. She claimed that Husband provoked these incidents of anger and that he was\nphysically abusive during the marriage. Wife described an argument in which Husband\npushed her down and “busted up my face and started kicking me.” Photographs of Wife’s\nbruised legs were submitted into evidence to support this claim. She acknowledged the video\nrecordings of her that Husband submitted into evidence, but explained that they were taken\nwithout her knowledge. Typically, she asserted, Husband would go out drinking at a bar,\ncome home around 3:00 a.m., initiate a conversation with her while she was in bed, and then\nrecord the ensuing incident.\n\nWhen Wife was asked about the account that she opened at Regions Bank in her name “d/b/a\nGorbet Construction,” she declined to answer and invoked her Fifth Amendment right not\nto incriminate herself. She did assert, however, that anything that had been taken was\nreturned.\n\nWife’s proposed property distribution listed the Willow Green home in Jackson as marital\nproperty. Wife testified that, in early June 2010, she and Husband and their daughters\nselected that house to live in as a family. She said that she offered to come to the closing on\nthe home, but Husband told her that there was no need for her to be there, adding they could\n“add [her] name at any time on the title.” Wife stated that Husband never indicated to her\nthat the house was his separate property or that she had no ownership interest in it. She said\nthat she willingly gave her car to workmen in exchange for $2,000 worth of\nstonework/brickwork that was performed on the house. Wife proposed that she and Husband\nshare equally in the equity of the house.\n\nWife’s proposed property distribution also listed the San Arbor property as marital property.\nShe claimed that she and Husband purchased that lot with the intent to someday build a home\non it for themselves. She described going to the bank together to get a loan for the lot, and\nnoted that the $16,000 down payment on the property was made during the marriage out of\nthe LLC’s Commercial Bank account.\n\nWife also claimed that the cash value of Husband’s whole-life policy was marital property.\nWife said that she and Husband together decided to pay $20,000 to convert the policy to a\nwhole-life policy because it would earn a favorable interest rate. The $20,000 conversion\ncost, she stated, was paid out of the LLC Commercial Bank account. Based on her\ndiscussions with Husband prior to converting the policy, Wife mistakenly assumed that she\nwas the beneficiary on that policy.\n\nWife asked the trial court to award spousal support “[j]ust until I can get back on my feet.”\nDuring the ten or eleven years she worked in her job at the hospital in Arkansas, Wife said,\n\n                                              -7-\n\fshe had “worked [her]self up” to a position in which she earned over $32,000 per year.5\nAfter the parties separated, Wife called the hospital about getting her old job back, but she\nwas informed that the hospital was in a “hiring freeze,” and that even if she were rehired, she\nwould not be able to regain her seniority status. Wife acknowledged that she has a bachelor’s\ndegree in speech pathology and audiology, but claimed that she would need a master’s degree\nor special certification to get a job in that field. Wife claimed that she had used her best\nefforts to find a job in Arkansas while living in Jackson, but ultimately determined that she\nwould need to live in Arkansas in order to get a job there. She also claimed that Husband\nhad hindered her efforts to find employment by cutting off her phone, so prospective\nemployers could not return her telephone calls. Other than Husband’s temporary alimony\npayments, at the time of trial, Wife’s only income was the $500 per month that she received\nin child support from her former husband.6 She submitted into evidence a list of her monthly\nexpenses, which indicated that her expenses exceeded her income by $2,790 per month.\n\nWife testified that the attorney fees she incurred in the divorce were substantially increased\nby Husband’s decision not to be forthcoming in response to discovery about his relationship\nwith his paramour. In response to Husband’s denials, Wife said, she and her attorney\nattended hearings, conducted depositions, made telephone calls, reviewed telephone records,\nand engaged in other efforts to obtain proof of Husband’s extramarital conduct. Wife also\nalleged that her attorney fees were increased unnecessarily by Husband’s failure to comply\nwith his obligation to pay temporary spousal support and his failure to maintain the marital\nhome. In light of Husband’s conduct, Wife’s lack of resources, and Husband’s ability to pay,\nWife asked the trial court to award her attorney fees of $15,137.\n\nOn July 19, 2011, the trial court wrote an opinion letter setting out its decision. First, the trial\ncourt declared the parties divorced and restored Wife’s maiden name. It attached to the\nletter a chart identifying, valuing, and classifying all of the property owned by the parties as\neither separate or marital. The trial court equitably divided all of the property that was\nclassified as marital. Relevant to this appeal, the trial court classified as marital property\nthree items that Husband had claimed as his separate property: (1) the Willow Green home,\nwith equity of $60,400, (2) the San Arbor property, with equity of $16,000, and (3)\nHusband’s whole-life insurance policy, with a cash value of $13,500. Of those assets, the\ntrial court awarded Wife the following: $25,200 (42%) of the equity in the marital home;\n$8,000 (50%) of the equity in the San Arbor property; and $4,000 (30%) of the cash value\nof Husband’s whole life insurance policy. In addition, the trial court awarded Wife\n\n\n5\n Wife initially testified that she earned $37,000 per year in her job at the Arkansas hospital, but she later\nacknowledged her 2010 tax return, which showed that she earned just over $32,000 in 2009.\n6\n    Wife claimed that her daughter’s father was $7,000 behind in his child support payments.\n\n                                                     -8-\n\ftransitional alimony for two years — $1,700 per month in the first year, and $750 per month\nin the second year. The trial court reasoned that, although the marriage was one of short\nduration, Wife needed funds “to help bridge the gap for a certain period of time until she can\nreestablish [in Arkansas],” and “to soften the economic blow of the divorce . . . .” The trial\ncourt also awarded Wife attorney fees of $8,000 as alimony in solido based on its finding that\nHusband’s conduct during the divorce enhanced Wife’s fees, and because requiring Wife to\npay all of her attorney fees would negatively impact her ability to reestablish in Arkansas.\nFinally, the trial court ordered Husband to pay Wife $2,500 to defray her moving expenses.\nOn August 9, 2011, the trial court entered a final decree of divorce incorporating its letter\nruling in total. From this order, Husband now appeals.\n\n                     ISSUES ON A PPEAL AND S TANDARD OF R EVIEW\n\nHusband raises the following issues on appeal:\n\n       (1) Did the trial court err in its award of transitional alimony to Wife?\n       (2) Did the trial court err in its classification of the marital home, the San\n       Arbor property, and Husband’s whole-life insurance policy as marital property,\n       rather than separate property?\n       (3) Did the trial court err in awarding attorney fees to Wife as alimony in\n       solido?\n       (4) Did the trial court err in awarding Wife $2,500 in moving expenses?\n\nWe review the trial court’s findings of fact de novo on the record, presuming those findings\nto be correct unless the evidence preponderates otherwise.

He\nemphasizes that this was a marriage of short duration; the parties were married only 220 days\n\n                                             -9-\n\fbefore they separated. Husband also notes that Wife received $25,620 in temporary alimony\nbefore trial, which included $2,055 per month paid directly to her, as well as Husband’s\npayment of numerous bills for Wife’s benefit. He argues that, during all of this time, Wife\nhas had the ability to earn a living, given her education and past work experience, pointing\nout that she earned over $32,000 per year at her former job. Husband insinuates that, after\nthe marriage failed, Wife’s efforts to obtain work in Arkansas were perfunctory, noting that\nWife frequently traveled back to Arkansas for visits but “never arranged for an interview”\nwhile there. Husband challenges the trial court’s credibility determination in favor of Wife,\nparticularly in light of Wife’s attempted thievery by opening a Regions Bank account with\nchecks made out to Gorbet Construction. For these reasons, Husband argues, the facts of this\ncase do not support the trial court’s decision to award Wife transitional alimony.\n\nUnder the Tennessee statutes governing alimony, a trial court is authorized to award alimony\nin divorce cases “to be paid by one spouse to or for the benefit of the other, or out of either\nspouse’s property, according to the nature of the case and the circumstances of the parties.”\nTenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(a) (Supp. 2012). The statute provides: “The court may fix some\ndefinite amount or amounts to be paid in monthly, semimonthly or weekly installments, or\notherwise, as the circumstances may warrant.” Id. All relevant factors, including the\nstatutory factors listed in Tennessee Code Annotated § 36-5-121(i), must be considered in\ndetermining whether alimony should be awarded to the relatively disadvantaged spouse and,\nif so, “the nature, amount, length of term, and manner of payment” of such an award.\n\nThe most important factors for a trial court faced with an alimony decision are the obligee\nspouse’s need for the alimony and the obligor spouse’s ability to pay. Bogan, 60 S.W.3d at\n730; Riggs v.

The trial court “is afforded\nwide discretion regarding the award of spousal support, and we will reverse the court’s\nfindings only upon determining that such discretion ‘has manifestly been abused.’” Hill v.\nHill, M2007-00471-COA-R3-CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1822453</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7 (Tenn.

Ct. App. 1989)).\n\nThe statute specifically authorizes trial courts to award “transitional” alimony where\nwarranted. Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(d)(1). Transitional alimony is appropriate “when\nthe court finds that rehabilitation is not necessary, but the economically disadvantaged spouse\nneeds assistance to adjust to the economic consequences of a divorce . . . .” Tenn. Code Ann.\n§ 36-5-121(g). In this case, the trial court explained that, although this was admittedly a\nshort marriage, Wife was in need of transitional alimony:\n\n       While the Court is aware that this is a short marriage, Wife is temporarily\n       economically disadvantaged from the Husband, and has been detrimentally\n       effected [sic] by the breakdown of the marriage more so than normal since she\n\n                                             -10-\n\f       gave up her job and her living situation in Arkansas to move to Jackson with\n       her Husband. As a result, she must go back and start over. She will need\n       funds to help bridge the gap for a certain period of time until she can\n       reestablish. It is appropriate that Husband contribute to Wife in order to soften\n       the economic blow of the divorce on the Wife. Husband has sufficient funds\n       to pay transitional alimony.\n\nWe first dispense with Husband’s argument that we should disregard the trial court’s\ncredibility determinations in this case. The trial court is afforded wide discretion in assessing\nwitnesses’ credibility, and we are bound by its credibility determinations in the absence of\nclear and convincing evidence to the contrary. Sullivan v. Sullivan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1637660\"><a href=\"/opinion/1637660/sullivan-v-sullivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 510\n(Tenn. Ct. App. 2002). Wife’s actions with respect to the Regions Bank account, while\ndubious, do not amount to the clear and convincing evidence necessary for us to put aside the\ntrial court’s credibility findings. Thus, we consider the evidence in the record, giving\nappropriate deference to the trial court’s view of the parties’ credibility.\n\nOn the propriety of the trial court’s award, Husband rightly emphasizes the short duration of\nthe marriage and the fact that Wife is educated and has ample work experience to support\nherself. Nevertheless, we are not persuaded that the trial court abused its discretion in\nawarding transitional alimony under the circumstances of this case. When the parties decided\nto marry, Wife moved from her home state and left a stable job with eleven years of seniority\nto start a life with Husband in Jackson, Tennessee. Thus, as noted by the trial court, Wife\nwas uprooted from her home and job in Arkansas because of the marriage, and as a\nconsequence suffered more than the normal amount of detrimental effect from the demise\nof the marriage. Wife testified that her former job in Arkansas was unavailable, and that\neven if she were rehired, the seniority status she had earned would be forfeited. She testified\nthat her attempts to find employment in Arkansas had thus far been fruitless, and that she\nhad concluded that she could not find a job in Arkansas until she completed her move there.\nIn our view, this is precisely the type of situation for which transitional alimony was\nintended.\n\nIn the alternative, Husband argues that, even if this Court holds that the trial court did not err\nin awarding transitional alimony, the amount of alimony award was unwarranted. We\ndisagree; we find that the amount awarded was well within the trial court’s discretion. An\naward of $1,700 per month for one year helps enable Wife to pay her house note and her car\nnote for the first year, while leaving her only about $700 per month for all of her other\nexpenses. According to the evidence in the record on Wife’s reported expenses, this amount\nof transitional alimony still leaves her with a shortfall of about $1,000 per month. The\nstepped-down award of $750 per month in the second year is not unreasonable to ease her\ntransition, and the evidence indicates that this amount is well within Husband’s means to pay.\n\n                                              -11-\n\fUnder the circumstances, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s award of\ntransitional alimony.\n\n                                 Classification of Property\n\nHusband next challenges the trial court’s holding that several disputed properties were\nmarital property. Our Supreme Court has explained why the classification of the parties’\nproperty is key to the equitable division of property in a divorce case:\n\n       Tennessee is a “dual property” state because its domestic relations law\n       recognizes both “marital property” and “separate property.” See generally\n       Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-121; Eldridge v. Eldridge, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1476946\"><a href=\"/opinion/1476946/eldridge-v-eldridge/\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 12 (Tenn.\n       Ct. App. 2002). When a married couple seeks a divorce, the “marital\n       property” must be divided equitably between them, without regard to fault on\n       the part of either party. Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-121(a)(1). “Separate\n       property” is not part of the marital estate and is therefore not subject to\n       division. See Cutsinger, 917 S.W.2d at 241. Thus, it is imperative that the\n       parties, the trial court, or both identify all of the assets possessed by the\n       divorcing parties as either marital or separate so that a proper division can be\n       accomplished.\n\nSnodgrass v. Snodgrass, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1057654\"><a href=\"/opinion/1057654/snodgrass-v-snodgrass/\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">240</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 246 (Tenn. 2009). Broadly speaking, “separate\nproperty” is “[a]ll real and personal property owned by a spouse before marriage . . . .” Tenn.\nCode Ann. § 36-4-121(b)(2)(A). “Marital property” is defined as “all real and personal\nproperty, both tangible and intangible, acquired by either or both spouses during the course\nof the marriage up to the date of the final divorce hearing and owned by either or both\nspouses as of the date of filing of a complaint for divorce . . . .” Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-\n121(b)(1)(A). As discussed below, a party’s separate property may become marital property\nvia the doctrine of comingling or the doctrine of transmutation.\n\nThe trial court’s classification and division of property is a finding of fact, which we presume\nto be correct unless the evidence preponderates otherwise.

In its letter ruling, the trial court stated that, “[p]rior to the marriage,\nthe parties jointly picked out [the Willow Green house] to be their marital home,” and that\nthe house “purchase closed one week prior to the marriage and they moved in.” The trial\ncourt’s attachment to the letter ruling summarized the factual findings that formed the basis\nfor its conclusion that the house had become marital property through transmutation:\n\n       Bought one week prior to marriage–Wife & Husband selected it–Moved in\n       after marriage–Utilized as marital home–Mortgage paid by Husband with\n       money earned during marriage–Marital Property by virtue of Transmutation.\n\nThe trial court determined that the marital home was worth $291,900, and that the parties had\n$60,400 equity in the home. Wife was awarded $25,200, 42% of the equity in the home.\n\nHusband argues that the evidence preponderates against the trial court’s finding that the\nWillow Green home was transmuted into marital property, because the home was purchased\nin his name only, and he lived with Wife in the home for only 220 days. He claims that\ntransmutation is not triggered solely based on the fact that Husband and Wife are residing in\nthe property together. See Patton v.

As noted by the\ntrial court, the house began as separate property; it was purchased by Husband prior to the\nmarriage and is titled in his name only. However, it is undisputed that Husband and Wife\nselected the house together, while they were engaged to be married, for the purpose of living\nin it together with their daughters as a family. They in fact moved into the home together\nafter they married; Husband paid the mortgage with funds earned during the marriage, and\nHusband acknowledged that Wife contributed her vehicle as payment for work done on the\nhome. Unlike the Patton case cited by Husband, in the case at bar, Husband submitted no\nevidence indicating that he intended to keep this property as his separate property after he\nmarried Wife. See Patton, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">377087</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2. Rather, in the instant case, Husband’s\nintent to keep the home as his separate property surfaced only after the demise of the\nmarriage.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the trial court’s holding that the Willow Green home in Jackson\nbecame marital property through the doctrine of transmutation.7\n\n                                      The San Arbor Property\n\nThe trial court held that the undeveloped lot at 25 San Arbor was marital property. In the\nattachment to the trial court’s letter ruling, its notation on this property states: “Unimproved\nlot purchased during marriage — Husband’s company paid $16,000 down and financed the\nbalance — This is Marital Property.” The summary of facts in the trial court’s letter ruling\nstates: “Since Husband was the sole member of the [Gorbet Construction] LLC, it was\nnormal for him to pay personal expenses out of the company’s account, both prior to and\nafter the marriage.” The trial court determined that the San Arbor property was worth\n\n\n\n7\n Husband does not challenge the proportion of the value of the marital home that was awarded to Wife;\nrather, he argues in his appellate brief that the trial court erred “in awarding [W]ife any portion of the\nproperty” based on its classification of the home as marital property.\n\n                                                  -14-\n\f$72,000, and that the parties had $16,000 equity in it. The trial court awarded Wife $8,000,\n50% of the equity in the property.\n\nHusband argues that the evidence preponderates against the trial court’s finding that the San\nArbor property was marital property subject to equitable division. He asserts that, as the trial\ncourt found, the property was purchased by Gorbet Construction – the LLC, not Husband\nindividually – with money from the LLC’s Commercial Bank account. Husband claims that\nWife had no interest in the construction company, nor did she have any interest in the Gorbet\nConstruction bank account. Because the lot was purchased with separate funds owned\nentirely by the business, Husband insists, the lot was separate and should have been classified\nas such.\n\nIn response, Wife asserts that the lot is marital property because it was purchased during the\nmarriage with marital funds. She points out that the bank account used to purchase this\nproperty was also used as a personal account by Husband. All of the funds earned by\nHusband during the marriage were deposited into this account, and personal bills were paid\nduring the marriage out of this account. Therefore, Wife argues, “[b]ecause the funds used\nto purchase [the property] were either proceeds from sales made during the marriage or\ncommingled with such proceeds, the funds, themselves, were marital property and any\npurchase made [with] those funds is similarly marital property subject to property division\nby the Court.”\n\nAs we have indicated, marital property is “all real and personal property, both tangible and\nintangible, acquired by either or both spouses during the course of the marriage . . . .” Tenn.\nCode Ann. § 36-4-121(b)(1)(A). Thus, the money Husband earned through Gorbet\nConstruction during the marriage was marital property. Wade v. Wade, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2435345\"><a href=\"/opinion/2435345/wade-v-wade/\"><span class=\"volume\">897</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">702</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 716\n(Tenn. Ct. App. 1994). By the same token, property purchased during the marriage with\nmarital earnings is marital property, absent evidence that the property was intended to be the\nseparate property of one spouse. Id. at 717.\n\nAs noted above, Husband’s earnings during the marriage constituted marital property.\nMoreover, Husband’s business earnings were deposited into the Gorbet Construction\nCommercial Bank checking account, out of which he paid all of his personal bills, both\nbefore and after the marriage. The $16,000 down payment for the San Arbor property was\nmade with money from the Commercial Bank account, which contained Husband’s earnings,\ni.e., marital property. The San Arbor property was acquired during the marriage. Under all\n\n\n\n\n                                              -15-\n\fof these circumstances, we cannot conclude that the evidence preponderates against the trial\ncourt’s finding that the San Arbor property should be classified as marital property.8\n\n                             Husband’s Whole-Life Insurance Policy\n\nThe trial court held that the cash value of Husband’s whole-life insurance policy was a\nmarital asset. It noted, however, that Wife made no monetary contribution to the policy.\nConsistent with Husband’s testimony, the trial court found that the cash value of the policy\nwas $13,500. It awarded Wife $4,000, 30% of the cash value, and awarded Husband $9,500,\n70% of the cash value.9\n\nHusband argues that the trial court erred in classifying the whole-life policy as marital\nproperty, because the policy was initially purchased when he divorced his first wife, and it\nwas intended solely for the benefit of his daughter. Wife was never made the beneficiary of\nthis policy, nor was she ever intended to be the beneficiary. Therefore, Husband maintains,\nbecause the policy came into existence prior to the marriage, and because Wife made no\nmonetary contribution to the policy, the policy cannot be classified as marital property.\n\nThe undisputed evidence in the record shows that, during Husband’s marriage to Wife,\nHusband paid $20,000 to convert the pre-existing term life insurance policy into a whole-life\npolicy. Once the term policy was converted to a whole-life policy, it became an asset to the\npolicyholder, and it had a present cash value. As with the San Arbor property, this asset was\nacquired with funds from the LLC Commercial Bank checking account, which contained the\nmonies Husband earned during the marriage. Thus, the whole-life policy was acquired\nduring the marriage with marital funds.\n\nUnder all of these circumstances, we cannot conclude that the evidence preponderates against\nthe trial court’s decision to classify the term-life policy as marital property.\n\n\n8\n We are mindful that the trial court classified the LLC’s Commercial Bank account as Husband’s separate\nproperty. The trial court’s classification of the Commercial Bank account as separate was not directly\nchallenged on appeal. However, the undisputed evidence shows that Husband’s earnings during the marriage\n– which are marital property – were deposited into this account. “[W]hatever Husband earned during the\nmarriage, regardless of the bank account into which it was deposited, remains marital property.” Wade, 897\nS.W.2d at 716. The trial court noted specifically that Husband treated the LLC account as both a business\nand a personal account, and it is undisputed that the San Arbor property was purchased with those funds\nduring the marriage. While we note this inconsistency in the trial court’s findings, the preponderance of the\nevidence clearly supports the trial court’s finding that the San Arbor property was marital property.\n9\n Husband does not challenge the trial court’s equitable division of the value of the policy, only its\nclassification as marital property.\n\n                                                    -16-\n\f                           Attorney Fees as Alimony In Solido\n\nThe trial court awarded Wife $8,000 in attorney fees as alimony in solido. It explained that\nit made the award because Wife’s “fees have been enhanced by virtue of the Husband’s\nconduct during the pendency of the divorce,” and because, “[w]hile Wife will have some\nfunds available to her, she will not have sufficient funds to compensate her attorney for\nerecting a proper defense and prosecution of her Counter-Complaint.” The trial court further\nreasoned that, “[t]o require [Wife] to pay all of her fees would impact her ability to\nreestablish after the divorce.”\n\nHusband argues that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding Wife $8,000 in attorney\nfees as alimony in solido, because she had already received over $10,000 in alimony\npendente lite, and she had also received other benefits by virtue of the fact that Husband paid\nall of her bills during the pendency of the litigation. Husband also asserts that Wife received\nenough transitional alimony out of which to pay her attorney fees; he points out that, by the\nend of the second year, Wife would have received a total of $29,400 in transitional alimony.\nIn addition, Wife was awarded the Arkansas home as her separate property, with equity of\n$36,000, her car with equity of $2,950, and other property out of which she could pay her\nattorney fees. Therefore, Husband argues, the trial court erred in awarding Wife attorney\nfees as alimony in solido.\n\nThe decision about whether to award attorney fees as alimony in solido is within the sound\ndiscretion of the trial court, and such an award will not be disturbed on appeal unless the\nevidence preponderates against factual findings that support the trial court’s decision.\nKincaid v.

A spouse with adequate property and income is not entitled to an award of alimony\nto pay attorney fees and expenses, but such an award is appropriate where the disadvantaged\nspouse lacks sufficient funds to pay his or her own fees. Id. In addition, a trial court may\nbase an award of attorney fees on a finding that the attorney fees incurred by one spouse were\nenhanced by the other spouse’s litigious conduct or obstructive tactics.

Ct. App. 1989).\n\nWe find that there is ample evidence in the record to support the award of attorney fees as\nalimony in solido. At the time of trial, Wife had no income other than the transitional\nalimony awarded and the somewhat erratic child support payments from her former husband.\nThe trial court correctly observed that requiring Wife to shoulder the total amount of the\nattorney fees she incurred would negatively impact her ability to reestablish herself in\n\n                                             -17-\n\fArkansas after the parties’ divorce. Moreover, Husband conveniently ignores the trial court’s\ndetermination that Wife’s fees were enhanced by his conduct in discovery on the question\nof his infidelity, which determination is supported in the record.\n\nBased on our review of the record, we find no abuse of the trial court’s discretion in\nawarding Wife $8,000 as alimony in solido.\n\n                                     Moving Expenses\n\nFinally, Husband argues that the trial court erred in awarding Wife $2,500 in moving\nexpenses. He contends that the amount of the award was based on speculative and unreliable\nestimates. We disagree. At trial, Husband conceded that he should pay Wife’s moving\nexpenses, and he testified that he received an estimate from a moving company of between\n$1,700 and $2,000 to complete the move. Wife testified that she obtained estimates from\nfour moving companies, and that the average cost from all four was $2,500. The trial court\nwas entitled to credit Wife’s testimony on this issue. Therefore, we find no error in the trial\ncourt’s award to Wife of $2,500 in moving expenses.\n\n                                        C ONCLUSION\n\nThe decision of the trial court is affirmed.
