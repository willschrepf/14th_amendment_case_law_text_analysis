LENTZ                         3\nresulting in the death of his ex-wife, Doris Lentz, in violation of the\nFederal Kidnapping Act, 18 U.S.C.A. § 1201(a)(1) (West 2000). In a\nseparate appeal, the United States challenges the district court’s grant\nof a new trial under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33 based\nupon the presence of unadmitted items of evidence in the jury room\nduring deliberations, as well as the district court’s findings that this\nextraneous evidence reached the jury as a result of intentional actions\non the part of Assistant United States Attorney Steven D. Mellin. In\na third appeal, AUSA Mellin challenges the district court’s findings\nregarding his conduct. Lentz has filed a motion to dismiss Mellin’s\nappeal.\n\n   For the following reasons, we reverse the district court’s judgment\nof acquittal, vacate the district court’s factual findings regarding\nintentional conduct on the part of AUSA Mellin, and affirm the dis-\ntrict court’s grant of a new trial. We dismiss the separate appeal of\nAUSA Mellin as moot, deny the motion to dismiss filed by Lentz as\nmoot, and remand the entire case to a new district court judge for fur-\nther proceedings.\n\n                           I. Background\n\n   This case involves the alleged kidnapping of Doris Lentz (\"Doris\")\nby her ex-husband, Jay Lentz (\"Lentz\"), and her resulting death.\nBecause we are evaluating the propriety of the district court’s grant\nof a judgment of acquittal to Lentz, we review the evidence in the\nlight most favorable to the government.\n\n   Lentz and Doris were married in 1989 and had one child, Julia,\nwho was born in 1991. Lentz was verbally and physically abusive to\nDoris during the marriage. Acquaintances of Doris testified that they\nobserved bruises on Doris’s body on at least two separate occasions\nprior to the couple’s separation in 1993. In addition, a Prince\nGeorge’s County police officer testified that he responded to a domes-\ntic violence call on one occasion at the Lentz home and observed\nbruises on Doris’s arms. Doris, in deposition testimony taken during\nthe divorce proceedings, had also testified that Lentz physically\nassaulted her on three occasions during the marriage.\n\n   There was significant testimony that Doris was afraid of Lentz dur-\ning the marriage and that this fear did not subside after their separa-\n\f4                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\ntion. When Doris first decided to leave the marital home, she asked\nher Episcopal priest to be present when she told Lentz of her decision.\nShe eventually moved into an apartment in Arlington, Virginia, that\nprovided security, parked in a controlled-access garage, instructed the\napartment management not to allow Lentz to proceed past the lobby\narea when he came to pick up Julia, and generally made arrangements\nto exchange custody of Julia in public places so as to avoid being\nalone with Lentz. As recently as the spring of 1996, Doris asked a\nfriend from her church to accompany her to the marital home in Fort\nWashington, Maryland, where Lentz had continued to live, to pick up\nJulia because she was afraid to go alone. And a co-worker of Lentz\ntestified that Lentz had told him in 1996 that he had \"kicked in\n[Doris’s] front door\" because she \"had made him mad.\" J.A. 987.\n\n   Although the divorce between the parties became final in 1995, a\nnumber of child support, child support arrearage, and marital property\ndistribution issues continued to be the subject of highly contested and\nbitter litigation in the family court. In particular, the marital home had\nbeen placed on the market for sale and Lentz and Doris frequently\nargued about how the proceeds from the sale should be divided. Doris\nrecorded a number of hostile telephone messages and conversations\nconcerning these ongoing issues that were played for the jury’s con-\nsideration.\n\n   In late March 1996, Lentz’s employer received a child support\norder requiring garnishment of Lentz’s wages. However, Lentz asked\nhis supervisor to postpone processing of the order within the company\nto give him some additional time. Two co-workers of Lentz testified\nthat Lentz told them at about this same time that he would kill Doris\nbefore he let her have custody of their child.\n\n   On Tuesday, April 16, 1996, Doris met Lentz in the lobby of her\napartment building in Arlington, Virginia. Lentz was picking up Julia\nfor a visit with Lentz’s parents in Indiana. Unbeknownst to Lentz,\nDoris had asked her friend, Jennifer Rigger, to follow Doris into the\nlobby and witness Doris’s planned attempt to ask Lentz to sign a doc-\nument pertaining to their ongoing family court litigation. As a result,\nRigger witnessed the exchange of Julia and the ensuing conversation\nconcerning Julia’s date of return. Rigger testified that Lentz initially\nexpressed frustration because Doris had only packed one suitcase\n\f                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                         5\ninstead of the two that Lentz had given them. Rigger also testified that\nLentz told Doris that Julia would return on Tuesday, April 23, exactly\none week later.\n\n   The evidence indicated that Doris initially believed Lentz would\naccompany Julia on the trip, and Julia was below the minimum age\nnecessary to fly unaccompanied. However, airline records revealed\nthat Julia flew unaccompanied to Indiana on April 17, under Lentz’s\nfalse representation that she met the minimum age requirement. The\nround-trip ticket that Lentz had reserved on April 15, had a scheduled\nreturn date of Friday, April 26. On April 16, Lentz changed the return\ndate to Saturday, April 27.\n\n  There was also evidence that Doris initially believed that Lentz\nwould return Julia to her on Wednesday, April 24. At noon on Satur-\nday, April 20, however, Lentz left a message on Doris’s answering\nmachine asking to change the meeting from Wednesday to Tuesday\nevening, April 23, between 7:30 p.m. and 8:00 p.m., and asking that\nDoris confirm that this was acceptable.\n\n   On Tuesday, April 23, at about 4:00 p.m., Lentz left the following\nmessage for Doris: \"Yea Dee, this is, uh, you know, I’m back now\nok. It’s Tuesday afternoon about 4:00 p.m.\" Doris’s mother, boy-\nfriend, aunt, and friend testified that Doris told each of them she was\nto pick up Julia at Lentz’s home on the evening of April 23. Doris’s\nbrown day planner indicated that Lentz and Julia would be returning\non that date.1 In addition, Rigger testified that she and Doris talked\nby telephone after Doris got home that evening and that Doris ended\nthe conversation at approximately 6:50 p.m., telling Rigger that she\nhad to leave to go pick up Julia at Lentz’s home or Lentz would be\nangry.\n\n   There was no eyewitness testimony that Doris arrived at Lentz’s\nhome that evening. Telephone records from April 23 indicate that two\ncalls were placed from Lentz’s mother’s residence in Indiana to\n  1\n   A second black day planner belonging to Doris indicated that Julia\nwould be returning on April 24, which the government argued was also\nconsistent with Lentz’s April 20 telephone message changing the pick-up\nfrom Wednesday to Tuesday.\n\f6                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\nLentz’s house in Maryland between 10:00 and 11:00 that evening, but\nLentz’s mother does not recall speaking to Lentz. A six-minute tele-\nphone call was placed from Lentz’s home to his mother’s home a few\nminutes after 12 a.m. on April 24.\n\n   On April 24, at 8:30 a.m., Doris and Lentz were scheduled to\nappear at a hearing in the family court case. Although scheduled to\nsee Doris two hours later, Lentz left a message on Doris’s answering\nmachine at 6:14 a.m., stating that his mother had rescheduled Julia’s\nflight and that she would be returning on Thursday, April 25, instead\nof Saturday, April 27. Lentz appeared at the 8:30 a.m. hearing with\nhis attorney, but left after a short time. Doris’s attorney also appeared,\nbut Doris did not. Lentz appears to have returned to his home, where\nanother telephone call took place between his home and his mother’s\nhome in Indiana. Lentz’s coworker, Sherrie Roske, testified that Lentz\narrived at work after noon that day, looking disheveled, with bags\nunder his eyes. In the meantime, Lentz’s parents had changed Julia’s\nreturn date from April 27 to April 25 in order to accommodate their\nneed to travel on business elsewhere. At no time, however, was\nJulia’s ticketed return date scheduled for April 23.\n\n   On Thursday, April 25, Doris’s co-worker contacted the Arlington\nCounty Police to inform them that Doris was missing, and it was soon\ndiscovered that the last known plan on Doris’s part was to travel to\nLentz’s home on the evening of April 23 to pick up Julia. During his\ninitial interview with the police, Lentz said that he had last spoken to\nDoris on April 23 between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m., and told her not to come\npick up Julia, a conversation that would have preceded the 6:50 p.m.\ntime that Rigger had said Doris ended their conversation to go to\nLentz’s home. However, just before midnight on April 28, after the\nnews spread that Doris was last heard from around 7:00 p.m. on April\n23, Lentz left a voicemail message with a police investigator stating\nthat he had been mistaken earlier and that he had last spoken to Doris\naround 6:50 p.m. on April 23. In the meantime, Lentz had spoken to\nMarilyn Sauder, a babysitter for Julia, who testified that Lentz said he\ntold Doris that Julia would not be returning on the evening of April\n23 due to a ticketing mix-up and that she should not come to get her\nthat evening, but that Doris had come anyway. There was no evidence\nthat the airlines ever made a ticketing mistake.\n\f                        UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                          7\n   On April 28, 1996, Doris’s car was found in a parking lot in Wash-\nington, D.C., approximately eight miles from Lentz’s home and on a\nroute between Lentz’s home and that of Doris. The witness who\nreported the abandoned car stated that she first noticed it in the park-\ning lot on April 24, the morning after Doris was last heard from by\nanyone, and that the parking lot was a known dumping ground for\nstolen vehicles. When the police arrived to inspect the vehicle, the\ndoors were unlocked and the keys were on the passenger side floor.\nDoris’s purse, complete with wallet, money, checks, and credit cards,\nwas in plain view in the car. The driver’s seat was in the position far-\nthest back from the steering wheel, which would have accommodated\na tall driver such as Lentz, who is 6 feet tall, but not Doris, who was\na little more than five feet tall. The interior of the vehicle and the\ntrunk area were dirty, and there were blood stains on the passenger\nside of the vehicle. There were also two umbrellas in the back seat,\none for an adult and one for a child, and there was evidence that it\nwas raining heavily on the evening of April 23. The floor mats and\nJulia’s booster seat, however, were missing from the car. Two wit-\nnesses who had ridden in Doris’s car the day before her disappearance\ntestified that the interior of the car was completely clean and stain-\nfree and that the booster seat was in the back of the vehicle at that\ntime. They also testified that it was a clear night and there were no\numbrellas in the car.\n\n   Shortly after the car was discovered, blood stains found in the inte-\nrior were tested at the Virginia Forensic Laboratory and confirmed to\nmatch that of Doris. After Lentz was indicted in November 2001, the\ngovernment sent the blood-stained passenger seat to the Virginia\nForensic Laboratory for further DNA analysis, along with a DNA\nsample from Lentz. According to Robert Scanlon, the forensic scien-\ntist who completed the testing, all of the bloodstains contained\nDoris’s DNA, with the exception of one 3/4 inch stain found on the\ncenter of the passenger seat of Doris’s car. Scanlon testified that this\nsample contained Lentz’s DNA.2 In addition, Scanlon testified that\n  2\n   To refute this evidence, the defense presented the testimony of two\nexperts who examined the seat after this testing was completed and testi-\nfied that they found no evidence of the blood spot. The defense argued\nthat the sample did not exist and, even if it did, that Scanlon had either\ncontaminated the test or that Lentz’s DNA was present as a result of\n\"secondary transfer,\" i.e., a transfer of DNA by the child.\n\f8                      UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\nLentz could not be eliminated as a possible donor of a sample taken\nfrom the recline lever of the passenger seat. Witnesses testified that\nDoris purchased her vehicle after she and Lentz separated, that he had\nnot had access to her car, and that Doris was too afraid of Lentz to\nhave ever let him in the car with her.\n\n   It was also discovered that Lentz had left a message with his real\nestate agent, Diane Ives, on April 22, asking her to remove the lock-\nbox from his home because he wanted to do some interior painting.\nIves testified that when she arrived at the home on April 23, she\nentered the home and noticed a large blue tarp in the foyer but no\npainting supplies. She removed the lockbox and left. Lentz also\nrequested that his mail delivery be stopped indefinitely, effective\nApril 24. On Saturday, April 27, Ives replaced the lockbox, but Lentz\ncalled her and demanded that she remove it again. When she returned\nto the home, Ives noticed that the blue tarp was gone, but no interior\npainting had been done, and that a small square on the floor of the\ncarport had been freshly painted a gray color. On Monday, April 29,\nIves returned to the house and noticed that the painted area in the car-\nport had more than doubled in size. By May 10, the entire back third\nof the driveway had been painted gray. The interior was never\npainted. In addition, two police officers driving by the residence\nobserved Lentz, within several days of the disappearance, washing the\nfloor of the carport with a garden hose. Doris’s mother testified that,\nduring a visit to the home to see Julia in June 1996, she noticed that\nthe carpeting had been replaced or very well-cleaned, the living room\nsofa was missing, and a matching chair had been moved to where the\nsofa had been previously placed. Within a few months of Doris’s dis-\nappearance, Lentz obtained a court order, retroactive to April 23, sus-\npending his child support payments and the garnishment order. Lentz\nsold the marital home in late 1996 and moved with Julia to Indiana.\n\n   Because Doris’s body was never found, the Arlington County\ninvestigation into her disappearance and presumed murder ultimately\nstalled. The federal investigation continued. On April 24, 2001, a fed-\neral grand jury returned an indictment against Lentz, charging kidnap-\nping resulting in death in violation of the Federal Kidnapping Act, 18\nU.S.C.A. § 1201(a). In July 2003, a jury found Lentz guilty of the\nkidnapping charge and returned a unanimous verdict of life imprison-\nment. Shortly thereafter, the district court granted Lentz’s motion for\n\f                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                         9\njudgment of acquittal, see United States v. Lentz, 275 F. Supp. 2d 723,\n749 (E.D. Va. 2003), and the government filed a notice of appeal.\n\n                        II. Appeal No. 03-15\n\n   We first consider the government’s claim that the district court\nerred in granting Lentz’s motion for judgment of acquittal on the\ngrounds that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction\nof kidnapping resulting in death.\n\n   We review de novo the district court’s judgment of acquittal based\nupon the insufficiency of the evidence. See United States v. Wilson,\n118 F.3d 228, 234 (4th Cir. 1997). When addressing a sufficiency\nchallenge, \"[w]e must view the evidence in the light most favorable\nto the government and inquire whether any rational trier of fact could\nfind the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\nId.; see United States v. Higgs, 353 F.3d 281, 313 (4th Cir. 2003)\n(holding that a conviction must be sustained if there is \"‘evidence that\na reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to\nsupport a conclusion of a defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable\ndoubt\") (quoting United States v. Burgos, 94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.\n1996) (en banc)). The jury, not the reviewing court, assesses the cred-\nibility of the witnesses and resolves any conflicts in the evidence\npresented. See Wilson, 118 F.3d at 234; United States v. Arrington,\n719 F.2d 701, 704 (4th Cir. 1983). \"Those functions are reserved for\nthe jury, and if the evidence supports different, reasonable interpreta-\ntions, the jury decides which interpretation to believe.\" Wilson, 118\nF.3d at 234 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                  A. The Federal Kidnapping Act\n\n   Adopted in 1932, the Federal Kidnapping Act (the \"Act\") was pri-\nmarily designed \"to assist the states in stamping out [the] growing and\nsinister menace of kidnapping\" where perpetrators transported their\nvictims across state lines in order to frustrate state authorities con-\nfined in their investigations by jurisdictional boundaries. Chatwin v.\nUnited States, 326 U.S. 455, 463 (1946). As amended, the Act now\nauthorizes the punishment of death or life imprisonment of anyone\nwho\n\f10                      UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\n     unlawfully seizes, confines, inveigles, decoys, kidnaps,\n     abducts, or carries away and holds for ransom or reward or\n     otherwise any person, . . . when . . . the person is willfully\n     transported in interstate or foreign commerce, regardless of\n     whether the person was alive when transported across a\n     State boundary if the person was alive when the transporta-\n     tion began . . ., if the death of any person results.\n\n18 U.S.C.A. § 1201(a)(1).\n\n    Accordingly, in order to establish a kidnapping resulting in death\nunder section 1201(a)(1), the government was required to prove (1)\nthe jurisdictional component of interstate transportation; (2) that Doris\nwas \"unlawfully seized, confined, inveigled, decoyed, kidnapped,\nabducted, or carried away;\" (3) that Doris \"was held for ransom or\nreward or otherwise;\" and (4) that death resulted. Higgs, 353 F.3d at\n313; United States v. Wills, 234 F.3d 174, 177 (4th Cir. 2000) (Wills\nI).\n\n                            B. Jurisdiction\n\n   There is no dispute that the government presented sufficient evi-\ndence to establish the jurisdictional component that Doris was \"will-\nfully transported in interstate . . . commerce.\" 18 U.S.C.A.\n§ 1201(a)(1). There is no statutory requirement that a kidnapper \"ac-\ncompany, physically transport, or provide for the physical transporta-\ntion of the victim\" in order to satisfy the \"willfully transported\"\nelement of section 1201(a)(1). Wills I, 234 F.3d at 178. Rather, it is\nenough to show that the kidnapper \"willfully caused unaccompanied\ntravel over state lines.\" Id. at 179.\n\n   In Wills I, the defendant left a flyer at the victim’s residence in Vir-\nginia advertising a job opportunity. The victim — who had identified\nthe defendant as the person who had previously burglarized his home\n— contacted the defendant at the District of Columbia cellular tele-\nphone number provided and arrangements were made for the victim\nto travel to Union Station for a job interview. The victim’s abandoned\ncar was found the following day and he was never heard from again.\nThus, the evidence supported the conclusion that the defendant had\nlured the victim into traveling unaccompanied from his home in Vir-\n\f                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                        11\nginia to Washington, D.C., by promising a job interview in order to\neliminate the victim as an eyewitness to the burglary charged against\nhim. Because the victim crossed state lines unaccompanied by the\ndefendant, the district court dismissed the kidnapping charge on the\nground that it failed to satisfy the Act’s jurisdictional component of\ninterstate transportation.\n\n   On appeal from the dismissal of the charge, we held that jurisdic-\ntion exists for purposes of the Act \"when a victim, acting because of\nfalse pretenses initiated at the instance of the defendant, transports\nhimself across state lines without accompaniment by the alleged per-\npetrator or an accomplice.\" Id. at 176. We explained that\n\n    [t]he plain language of the Act does not require that the\n    defendant accompany, physically transport, or provide for\n    the physical transportation of the victim. Rather, the Act\n    only requires that the victim \"is willfully transported.\" If\n    Congress wished to make accompaniment by the defendant\n    over state lines a requirement under the Act, it could easily\n    have written the Act to provide for it.\n\nId. at 178.\n\n   Here, the jury reasonably concluded that Lentz, by telling Doris\nthat Julia had returned from Indiana and arranging for Doris to pick\nher up from his home on April 23, willfully caused Doris to be trans-\nported across state lines from her home in Virginia to his home in\nMaryland, thereby satisfying the jurisdictional component of the Act.\n\n                   C. The Substantive Elements\n\n   The substantive requirements of the statute are that the government\nprove (1) that Lentz unlawfully seized, confined, inveigled, decoyed,\nkidnapped, abducted, or carried away Doris; (2) that Lentz held her\n\"for ransom or reward or otherwise;\" and (3) that Doris’s death\nresulted from those actions. 18 U.S.C.A. § 1201(a). It is this \"involun-\ntariness of seizure and detention which is the very essence of the\ncrime of kidnaping.\" Chatwin, 326 U.S. at 464; see United States v.\nYoung, 512 F.2d 321, 323 (4th Cir. 1975) (noting that \"the true ele-\n\f12                     UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\nments of the offense are an unlawful seizure and holding\") (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n   Here, the government presented sufficient evidence to support the\nconclusion that Lentz inveigled Doris into traveling from her home to\nhis, thereby satisfying the seizure element of the Act. Cf. United\nStates v. Hughes, 716 F.2d 234, 239 (4th Cir. 1983) (holding that\n\"[b]y inducing his victim by misrepresentations to enter his vehicle\nand to accompany him, and knowing that the victim’s belief as to\ntheir purpose and destination is different from his actual illicit pur-\npose, the kidnapper has interfered with, and exercised control over,\nher actions\"). Lentz does not contend otherwise, and also concedes\nthat the evidence was sufficient to support the conclusion that Doris\nis deceased. Rather, Lentz’s challenge to his kidnapping conviction is\nnarrowly centered upon the claim that there was insufficient evidence\nfrom which the jury could reasonably have concluded that Doris was\nheld or otherwise restrained by Lentz \"for ransom or reward or other-\nwise.\" 18 U.S.C.A. § 1201(a). It is to that inquiry that we now turn.\n\n                                   1.\n\n   The Supreme Court has held that \"[t]he act of holding a kidnaped\nperson for a proscribed purpose,\" as required by the Act, \"necessarily\nimplies an unlawful physical or mental restraint for an appreciable\nperiod against the person’s will and with a willful intent so to confine\nthe victim.\" Chatwin, 326 U.S. at 460 (emphasis added). It implies\n\"an intent to restrain [the victim’s] movements contrary to her\nwishes.\" Id.; see United States v. Wills, 346 F.3d 476, 493 (4th Cir.\n2003) (Wills II) (\"To hold means to detain, seize, or confine a person\nin some manner against that person’s will.\") However, \"[i]t is not nec-\nessary that the government prove that the holding occurred prior to\nthe transportation in interstate commerce.\" Wills II, 346 F.3d at 493.\n\n   In Chatwin, the Court decided that the victim had not been \"held\"\nfor purposes of the Act because, even though the victim was\nmentally-challenged and had been persuaded to stay with the defen-\ndants in a plural marriage, the victim had remained free to move\nabout at will. The victim was not \"deprived of her liberty, compelled\nto remain where she did not wish to remain, or compelled to go where\nshe did not wish to go.\" Chatwin, 326 U.S. at 460. Nor was there evi-\n\f                        UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                        13\ndence that the defendants \"willfully intended through force, fear or\ndeception to confine the girl against her desires.\" Id. On the contrary,\n\"she was perfectly free to leave the [defendants] when and if she so\ndesired.\" Id.\n\n   Lentz claims that the evidence in this case was similarly insuffi-\ncient to prove that Lentz imposed \"an unlawful physical or mental\nrestraint for an appreciable period against [Doris’s] will.\" Id. Specifi-\ncally, Lentz argues that, although his inveiglement of Doris and her\nunaccompanied travel from Virginia to Maryland caused by it satis-\nfies the jurisdictional and seizure components of the statute, it cannot\nalso serve to establish the \"holding\" element because there was no\nevidence that Lentz exerted any physical or mental force sufficient to\neffect a restraint upon her movements during the trip. In other words,\nLentz argues that Doris was at all times \"perfectly free\" to return to\nher home or otherwise decide not to complete the journey to pick up\nJulia at his home. Lentz also argues that Doris’s murder upon her\narrival at his home (assuming the jury found that this to be supported\nby the evidence), cannot suffice because a \"holding\" under the kid-\nnapping statute requires a restraint of the victim beyond that required\nto accomplish the murder and there is no evidence that Doris was sub-\njected to any physical restraint beyond that necessary to simply kill\nher upon her arrival.\n\n   The government argues to the contrary, contending that Doris was\n\"held\" for purposes of the Act in two distinct ways: (1) by deception\nfrom the time she was inveigled or deceived into traveling from Vir-\nginia to Maryland through the time that she came into Lentz’s pres-\nence; and, (2) thereafter through physical force or fear up to and\nduring her murder. As explained below, viewing the evidence in the\nlight most favorable to the government and drawing all reasonable\ninferences in its favor, we are satisfied that the evidence, though cir-\ncumstantial, was sufficient to support the jury’s determination that,\nupon Doris’s arrival at Lentz’s home, Lentz exerted an unlawful\nphysical or mental restraint for an appreciable period against Doris’s\nwill.\n\n                                   2.\n\n   At the conclusion of the evidence in this case, the district court\ninstructed the jury that the government was required to prove (1) that\n\f14                      UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\nLentz knowingly and willfully inveigled or decoyed Doris, (2) that\nDoris was held for ransom, reward, or some other benefit that Lentz\nintended to derive by so holding Doris, (3) that Lentz willfully trans-\nported or caused the transportation of Doris in interstate commerce,\nand (4) that Lentz’s actions resulted in Doris’s death. The court\ninstructed the jury that \"[t]o inveigle or decoy a person means to lure\nor entice or lead a person astray by false representations or promises\nor other deceitful means\" and that \"[t]o hold means to detain, seize\nor confine a person in some manner against that person’s will.\" J.A.\n1922. In addition, the jury was instructed as follows:\n\n       [T]he government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt\n     that the defendant held his victim for some benefit and that\n     the defendant willfully transported the victim in interstate\n     commerce.\n\n       It is not necessary that the government prove that the\n     holding occurred prior to the transportation in interstate\n     commerce.\n\n       However, the holding must be separate from . . . the trans-\n     portation.\n\nJ.A. 1924. Later, the jury was informed, in response to its question,\nthat \"the defendant himself [would] have to do the actual detain-\ning/holding\" of the victim. J.A. 2059A.\n\n   With regard to the evidence of \"holding,\" the government produced\ntestimony from the child’s babysitter that Lentz admitted Doris had\ncome to his house on the evening of April 23. Additionally, the gov-\nernment’s evidence showed that Lentz stopped his mailman from\ncoming to the house and that the realtor’s lockbox was removed to\nkeep unexpected and unwanted visitors from entering the house; that\na blue tarp was present in the foyer of the home on the morning of\nApril 23, but with a false pretense by Lentz as to its purpose; that both\nDoris’s blood and Lentz’s blood were found later in her car, which\nwitnesses testified was clean and stain-free the evening before and\nwhich witnesses testified Doris would never voluntarily have allowed\nLentz to enter; and that the sofa had been removed from the home and\nreplaced with its matching chair, all of which taken together provides\n\f                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                        15\ncircumstantial evidence that Doris was brought into Lentz’s home\nupon her arrival and murdered there.\n\n   The evidence also sufficiently supported the conclusion that, once\nDoris arrived at Lentz’s home, Lentz was in the position of employing\nfurther means, be it deceit or force, necessary to bring Doris inside\nthe home where he could physically confine her and kill her. From the\nmoment Doris pulled up at Lentz’s home, she was in his company and\nno longer \"perfectly free to leave.\" Chatwin, 326 U.S. at 460. Rather,\nLentz was then in a position to confine her physically if necessary.\nSee Higgs, 353 F.3d at 313 (rejecting challenge to the \"holding\" ele-\nment where the evidence supported the conclusion that the kidnapper\n\"was prepared to confine [his inveigled victims] at gunpoint if neces-\nsary\"); cf. United States v. Boone, 959 F.2d 1550, 1555 n.5 (11th Cir.\n1992) (noting that \"[i]nveiglement becomes an unlawful form of kid-\nnapping under the statute when the alleged kidnapper interferes with\nhis victim’s actions, exercising control over his victim through the\nwillingness to use forcible action should his deception fail\"). Beyond\nthis, there was also sufficient evidence to support the jury’s conclu-\nsion that, once Lentz had lured or forced Doris into his home, he con-\ntinued to hold her and kill her, wrapped her body in the blue tarp,\ndrove her car into the carport, moved her bleeding body out to the car-\nport and into the front passenger seat of the car, disposed of the body,\nand abandoned her car in a high-crime neighborhood in Washington,\nD.C., with keys and wallet in plain view, no doubt hoping that some-\none would steal the car and be caught in it along with Doris’s wallet\nand credit cards.\n\n   It is against this backdrop of evidence that we must determine\nwhether there was a logical and supporting evidentiary basis for the\njury to conclude that Doris was \"held\" by Lentz after she arrived at\nhis house but before the fatal wounds were inflicted. We believe there\nwas. Given the evidence that Doris was extremely fearful of being\nalone with Lentz out of the public eye and given the evidence that\nDoris was inside the house when she was killed, the jury could rea-\nsonably conclude from circumstantial evidence that after her arrival\nat the house Lentz either physically forced or lured her inside or oth-\nerwise confined her against her will for an appreciable period of time\nin order to accomplish the purpose of the seizure — her murder and\nits accompanying benefit to him in the domestic litigation. The\n\f16                      UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\ndefense argues correctly that there is no direct evidence as to exactly\nwhat events occurred in the house preceding Doris’s murder. How-\never, the government’s inability to produce direct evidence on this\nissue is not fatal to its case, because we believe the circumstantial evi-\ndence in the case supports the jury’s finding that Lentz himself\naccomplished \"the actual detaining/holding\" of the victim against her\nwill, separate and apart from her trip to the house. J.A. 2059A.\n\n   To conclude, the evidence was sufficient for the properly instructed\njury to convict Lentz of kidnapping resulting in murder. In applying\nthe instructions given, a reasonable juror could readily have con-\ncluded from the evidence that Lentz, after inveigling Doris into trav-\neling across state lines to his home, employed \"unlawful physical or\nmental restraint for an appreciable period against [Doris’s] will and\nwith a willful intent so to confine [her]\" inside his home. Chatwin,\n326 U.S. at 460. Once Doris arrived at Lentz’s home, Lentz had suc-\ncessfully transported Doris across state lines by his deception and was\nin the position to complete his plan to confine and kill Doris in private\nto eliminate any requirement that he split their marital assets, and\neliminate any further liability on his part for child support payments.\nSee United States v. Healy, 376 U.S. 75, 81 (1964) (holding a victim\n\"for ransom, reward or otherwise\" under § 1201(a) encompasses hold-\ning a victim for any reason which is of benefit to the defendant);\nUnited States v. Childress, 26 F.3d 498, 503 (4th Cir. 1994) (stating\nthat the kidnapping need not be performed for pecuniary gain to sat-\nisfy the \"ransom or reward or otherwise\" element and that it is suffi-\ncient if \"the defendant acted for any reason which would in any way\nbe of benefit\").\n\n   Nor does this conclusion conflict with the purposes of the Act, as\nargued by Lentz, by \"federalizing\" a state murder case. Lentz’s plan\nwas to cause Doris, through his deceit, to travel beyond the borders\nof her home state into his home state and then to involve yet another\njurisdiction in the investigation by dumping Doris’s blood-stained\nvehicle and personal effects in the District of Columbia. Cf. Hughes,\n716 F.2d at 239 (\"The policy justification for the original federal kid-\nnapping statute was to provide federal officials the ‘power to disre-\ngard [state] barriers in pursuing’ kidnappers who planned their\nactivities to take the best possible advantage of the limited authority\nand coordination of state law enforcement agencies.\") (quoting Chat-\n\f                        UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                        17\nwin, 326 U.S. at 463). According to representations made by the gov-\nernment, the federal investigation and prosecution proceeded\nprecisely because jurisdictional boundaries stifling the state prosecu-\ntions had come into play and the circuit case law interpreting the Act,\nspecifically the Wills I case, had opened up the prospect of the federal\ncharge. See Lentz, 275 F. Supp. 2d at 748, n. 29 (\"They couldn’t\ncharge a homicide in Prince George’s County,\" where Lentz resided,\nand \"[t]hey couldn’t charge anything in Arlington. All you ha[d] in\nArlington [was] someone being told to come over and get the child.\nThat’s no charge.\"). According to the district court, \"[u]nlike the clas-\nsic tragic kidnapping case, . . . this case suggests a mysterious intra-\nstate disappearance of Ms. Lentz under suspicious circumstances.\" Id.\nat 748 (emphasis added). On the contrary, the evidence in this case\nsupports the jury’s finding that Doris was held and killed after Lentz\ntricked her into traveling interstate for the purpose of avoiding further\ndomestic litigation and liabilities on his part.\n\n   For similar reasons, we reject Lentz’s suggestion that the evidence\nin this case cannot suffice to establish a \"holding\" of Doris under the\nAct because it demonstrates no more than a holding incident to her\nmurder. Compare United States v. Howard, 918 F.2d 1529, 1537\n(11th Cir. 1991) (reversing conviction for conspiracy to kidnap and\nattempted kidnapping of a federal agent under § 1201(a)(5) where\ndefendants, during an attempted drug buy, unsuccessfully tried to\nforce the agent into their vehicle because the record was \"devoid of\nevidence to support an inference that [defendants] would have\ndetained [the agent] after stealing his money, and the limited deten-\ntion inherent in the crime of robbery does not rise to the level of a\nkidnapping in this case\"), with United States v. Etsitty, 130 F.3d 420,\n427 (9th Cir. 1997) (per curiam) (affirming kidnapping conviction\nunder § 1201(a)(2) of horse-back rider who \"roped\" a 16-year-old girl\non an Indian reservation and rejecting claim that the kidnapping\ncharge was merged into an assault charge because the charges of kid-\nnaping and assault involved different elements and because \"a reason-\nable trier of fact . . . could find seizure, holding or detention\" and\ndefendant \"prevented [the victim] from escaping, in effect seizing or\nholding her, for a substantial period of time, for the purpose of caus-\ning her considerable bodily and emotional harm\").\n\n  In Chatwin, the Supreme Court instructed that the holding need\nonly be for \"an appreciable period\" of time. The \"holding\" or \"deten-\n\f18                      UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\ntion\" element is separate and distinct from the \"kidnapping\" or \"sei-\nzure\" element, but they should not be viewed in a vacuum. In this\ncase, there was evidence that Doris was seized by inveiglement, trans-\nported across state lines by virtue of that inveiglement, and held by\nLentz for the purpose of killing her and eliminating the pending cus-\ntody, support, and marital asset issues. Far from a routine state murder\ncase, it is this type of seizure, interstate transportation, and holding\nthat the Act, as amended, was intended to reach. Cf. Wills II, 346 F.3d\nat 493 (\"‘Nothing in the policy [disregard of State borders in pursuit]\njustifies rewarding the kidnapper simply because he is ingenious\nenough to conceal his true motive, until he is able to transport . . . [his\nvictim] into another jurisdiction.’\") (quoting Hughes, 716 F.2d at\n239).\n\n  For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the district court erred in\ngranting Lentz’s motion for acquittal.3\n\n                         III. Appeal No. 04-7\n\n   We turn now to the government’s appeal of the district court’s\ndecision granting Lentz a new trial based upon the presence of extra-\nneous items of evidence in the jury room during deliberations and the\ncourt’s accompanying findings that the extraneous evidence reached\nthe jury as a result of intentional misconduct on the part of AUSA\nMellin.\n\n                            A. Background\n\n   Shortly after the jury returned the kidnapping conviction, three\njurors contacted defense counsel and informed them that a brown\nleather Day Planner (the \"brown day planner\") and a black Wisconsin\nParalyzed Veterans of America pocket-sized calender (the \"black day\nplanner\") belonging to Doris had been present in the jury room during\ndeliberations. Among other things, the planners contained Doris’s\n  3\n   Because there was sufficient evidence supporting the jury’s determi-\nnation that Doris was held upon her arrival at Lentz’s home, it is unnec-\nessary for us to address the government’s position that Doris was held\nby deception during her unaccompanied journey from Virginia to Mary-\nland.\n\f                        UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                        19\nnotes concerning Lentz’s harassing and threatening behavior towards\nDoris and Julia’s day care provider; notes concerning Doris’s efforts\nto obtain a protective order; names and telephone numbers of police\nofficers and a domestic violence support group; and notes summariz-\ning derogatory statements about Doris made by Lentz to Julia. The\nblack day planner was not marked as an exhibit, but Lentz had offered\ntwo photocopied pages from it into evidence during the cross-\nexamination of Doris’s friend, Jennifer Rigger. These pages indicated\nthat Doris had expected Julia to return from her Indiana trip on April\n24, 1996, which contradicted Rigger’s testimony that Doris told her\nthat she was picking up Julia at Lentz’s home on the evening of April\n23, 1996. The brown day planner was pre-marked Exhibit 548 by the\ngovernment, but the government only submitted two photocopied\npages from it into evidence during its re-direct examination of Rigger.\nThese pages corroborated Rigger’s testimony that Doris had expected\nJulia to return from her Indiana trip on April 23, 1996.4\n\n   On July 25, 2003, Lentz moved to vacate the jury’s verdict, assert-\ning that he had been prejudiced by the presence of the day planners\nin the jury room during deliberations. In addition, Lentz asked the dis-\ntrict court to \"hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the\nfacts surrounding the inadmissible materials making their way to the\njury dictate that a retrial should be barred\" under Oregon v. Kennedy,\n456 U.S. 667, 674-75 (1982). J.A. 3322; see Kennedy, 456 U.S. at\n675-76 (holding that \"[p]rosecutorial conduct that might be viewed as\nharassment or overreaching, even if sufficient to justify a mistrial on\ndefendant’s motion, . . . does not bar retrial absent intent on the part\nof the prosecutor to subvert the protections afforded by the Double\nJeopardy Clause\").\n\n   At the conclusion of a motions hearing on August 14, 2003, the\ndistrict court deferred ruling on Lentz’s motion to set aside the jury\nverdict based upon the alleged prejudicial effect of the day planners\n  4\n    During closing arguments, the government argued that the April 24\nentry in the black day planner was consistent with the message that Lentz\nleft on Doris’s answering machine requesting that they \"move the pick\nup\" of Julia from Wednesday, April 24, to Tuesday evening, April 23,\nand that, in any event, the black day planner entry was inconsistent with\nJulia’s return flight, which Lentz never scheduled for either date.\n\f20                     UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\nand granted Lentz’s request for an evidentiary hearing. United States\nAttorney Paul McNulty and Federal Public Defender Frank Dunham\nwere instructed to conduct an inquiry within their respective offices\n\"to ascertain what the facts are concerning the handling of these docu-\nments,\" J.A. 3561, and to select counsel to present the testimony of\nthe trial attorneys and others who handled the exhibits. The district\ncourt indicated that each person who handled the exhibits would be\ngiven an opportunity to testify, along with the district court’s own\nstaff who were involved in the gathering of exhibits for submission\nto the jury.5\n\n   On November 4 and 5, 2003, the district court held the evidentiary\nhearing into the question of whether there had been intentional mis-\nconduct and heard arguments from counsel on whether the jury’s con-\nsideration of the unadmitted evidence was sufficiently prejudicial to\nwarrant the grant of a mistrial or new trial under Rule 33. Three\njurors, the court’s security officer, the court’s deputy clerk, three\ndefense attorneys, two prosecutors, two government support staffers,\nan FBI Agent and an Arlington County Police Officer testified at the\nhearing.\n\n   On January 29, 2004, the district court issued a memorandum opin-\nion summarizing the testimony and finding that the two day planners\nhad been excluded from evidence but were nonetheless \"intentionally\nsubmitted to the jury by the Government.\" J.A. 2834. The district\ncourt placed the blame exclusively upon AUSA Mellin. Among other\ncharges, the district court found that Mellin placed the two day plan-\nners with the evidence after counsel and the court clerk sorted the evi-\ndence for the jury, and that he did so with the \"intent to act outside\nthe Orders of th[e] Court and the confines of the law.\" J.A. 2869. The\ncourt further concluded that Mellin’s \"actions with the day planners\nsuggest that this conduct was not a benign act or negligent error,\" but\nrather a \"reckless\" and \"intentional\" act on his part. J.A. 2869.\n  5\n    The government thereafter sought a writ of mandamus from this court\nseeking recusal of the district judge from conducting the hearing into\nhow the evidence found its way into the jury room because the hearing\nwould necessarily require the judge to weigh the credibility of the gov-\nernment representatives against his long-time court personnel. We sum-\nmarily denied the writ. See In re United States of America, No. 03-21\n(4th Cir., Oct. 3, 2003).\n\f                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                        21\n   In the order, the district court also found that the \"submission [of\nthe evidence] was not benign because it violated [Lentz’s] Sixth\nAmendment right to confrontation and prevented him from receiving\na fair trial,\" and that the government had \"fail[ed] to meet its burden\nto prove that the submission was harmless because the evidence bol-\nstered the [g]overnment’s arguments and completely destroyed\n[Lentz’s] credibility and, therefore, his case.\" J.A. 2834. Despite the\ndistrict court’s findings of intentional misconduct, however, the dis-\ntrict court made no ruling pertaining to Lentz’s contention that a\nretrial should be barred under the double jeopardy clause. Instead, the\ndistrict court granted a new trial in the event this court reversed the\nearlier judgment of acquittal. On February 13, 2004, the government\nfiled a notice of appeal from the district court’s order. We first\naddress the evidence and findings regarding intentional misconduct\non the part of Mellin and then review the district court’s determina-\ntion that the jury’s verdict should be set aside based upon the prejudi-\ncial effect of the extraneous evidence.\n\n                B. Intentional Misconduct Findings\n\n   The following facts, gleaned from the evidentiary hearing con-\nducted by the district court, appear to be undisputed. On the afternoon\nof June 16, 2002, the jury received its instructions and the parties\ncompleted their closing arguments in the guilt phase of Lentz’s trial.\nThe jury was then instructed to return at 10:00 the following morning\nto begin deliberations. At approximately 9:30 the next morning, the\ndefense team (Michael Lieberman, Frank Salvato, and Judy Clark)\nand the prosecution team (AUSA Steven Mellin, AUSA Patricia\nHaynes, and Michael Chellis) met with courtroom deputy clerk\nJoanna Solomon and court security officer William Scruggs in the\ncourtroom to assemble the admitted trial exhibits and prepare them\nfor transport into the jury room. Also present and assisting in the\nendeavor at various times were FBI Special Agent Brad Garrett,\nArlington County Sergeant John Coale, Information Technologist\nTyrone Bowie, and an intern with defense counsel Salvato’s office.\nAfter Solomon sorted and reviewed the exhibits with counsel for both\nsides, the items were turned over to Scruggs to be loaded onto an evi-\ndence cart and transported into the jury room. According to the jurors,\nat some point after they began their deliberations, the black and\nbrown day planners were noticed and reviewed in the jury room,\n\f22                     UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\nalthough the earliest any juror recalled seeing the day planners was\non the second day of deliberations.\n\n   By all accounts, the process of sorting and loading the evidence\ntook place among four counsel tables for a period of at least 45 min-\nutes and involved up to twelve people (not counting any persons mill-\ning about behind the bar or unnoticed in the well). The precise events\noccurring during this time period and, in particular, the method by\nwhich the two day planners found their way into the jury room, how-\never, have been the subject of much uncertainty and confusion.\n\n   Solomon, the courtroom deputy clerk, testified that she began her\ntask by checking her exhibit list with counsel for both sides and that\nthe sorting of unadmitted evidence from admitted evidence took place\nprimarily at the back counsel table used by the government. Accord-\ning to Solomon’s list, four pages from the brown day planner and two\npages from the black day planner had been admitted into evidence,\nand it appears that these excerpts were marked as exhibits, placed\nwith the admitted evidence, and taken to the jury. Solomon testified\nthat when sorting the evidence, she \"endeavored to look at everything\non the [back] table\" and that \"everything on the back table [was to]\nbe put on the cart to go to the jury.\" J.A. 2430. She then turned the\nevidence over to Scruggs for loading onto the cart. She testified that\nshe did not see either the brown day planner or the black day planner\nduring the process.\n\n   According to Scruggs, after the evidence was turned over to him\nby Solomon, his \"understanding was that only items that were sitting\non the back table on the right hand side . . . [were] approved to go\nback to the jury.\" J.A. 2439. Scruggs testified that he was responsible\nfor loading the cart, but that the cart was actually loaded by \"a combi-\nnation of people\" helping him. J.A. 2440. Specifically, he testified\nthat Chellis, Agent Garrett, and Sergeant Coale all offered to assist\nhim. Scruggs testified that he saw the brown day planner on the back\ntable with the evidence for the jury at the time the cart was loaded and\nthat he later saw the black day planner with the evidence when he\nretrieved it from the jury room. In an earlier affidavit, however,\nScruggs stated that he had seen both the black and brown day plan-\nners \"[s]itting on the rear table with the items of physical evidence.\"\nJ.A. 3525. According to Scruggs’s affidavit:\n\f                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                        23\n    I was in court on August 14, 2003, when Judge Lee deter-\n    mined that these same two diaries that I had seen on the rear\n    table with the other items of physical evidence, had gone to\n    the jury. The books Judge Lee held up in open court on that\n    occasion appeared to be the same two books I saw on the\n    prosecution’s rear table.\n\n    As I loaded the notebooks on the front table onto the cart,\n    [Garrett, Coale, and Chellis] offered to assist me by loading\n    the items from the rear table onto the cart. At that time, the\n    two diaries were included along with the other items loaded\n    onto the cart. I cannot say which of the three gentlemen\n    actually placed the diaries on the cart or where on the cart\n    they were actually placed . . ., but I do remember that they\n    were on the cart.\n\nJ.A. 3525-26. Scruggs testified at the hearing that \"[n]o one got near\nthe cart once it was loaded.\" J.A. 2459. In sum, Scruggs testified that\n\"when Judge Lee held up the [day planners] in open court and said\n. . . the issue was how did they get back to the jury,\" he \"knew right\nthen how they had gotten back to the jury\" — they were present on\nthe back prosecution table and were loaded along with the items of\nadmitted evidence onto the cart that day. J.A. 2461. Scruggs could not\nstate who placed the day planners with the evidence or which helper\nloaded the day planners onto the evidence cart, but made no mention\nof Mellin’s presence in the area at the time or any assistance offered\nby him.\n\n   Defense counsel Lieberman, Salvato, and Clark testified that they\nwere also present when the exhibits were assembled for the jury, but\ndid not observe anyone placing the day planners with the admitted\nevidence or on the evidence cart. According to defense counsel, at\none point very early in the process, Mellin sought approval to remove\nthe contents of the brown day planner from its leather cover and to\nsubmit the cover with the admitted excerpts from it, but no one\nchecked to see if this was done. According to Clark, after the exhibits\nwere loaded on the cart, \"somebody said, well, who wants to inspect\nthe cart now\" and Lieberman walked over to the cart, looked it over,\nand moved some boxes around. J.A. 2471. Lieberman confirmed that\nhe did so, but he did not individually examine every item and he did\n\f24                      UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\nnot recall seeing either day planner on the cart. This testimony\nappears to be inconsistent with Scruggs’s testimony that \"[n]o one got\nnear the cart once it was loaded.\" J.A. 2459.\n\n   Michael Chellis, an attorney employed by the U.S. Attorney’s\noffice, testified that he was charged with the primary responsibility\nfor sorting the government’s exhibits after the trial. Chellis testified\nthat he met with Solomon to review the Clerk’s exhibit list. He testi-\nfied that Solomon told counsel for both sides that the few items not\nlisted as admitted could be admitted if both sides agreed. In particular,\nChellis recalled that the blood evidence was not listed as admitted, but\nthat the parties agreed that it should be loaded on the cart and taken\nto the jury anyway. Haynes also testified about a similar conversation\nbetween counsel and Solomon. Chellis testified that he had placed the\nblack day planner on Mellin’s office chair a few days before closing\nand that he later saw it on the government’s counsel table in the court-\nroom. Chellis admitted that he personally placed the brown day plan-\nner on the back counsel table, which is consistent with Scruggs’s\ntestimony, but that he did not intend to place it with the admitted\nitems of evidence.\n\n   After Chellis testified, Solomon was recalled by the government.\nSolomon initially denied having ever told either side that evidence\nthat was intended to be, but inadvertently not, admitted during the\ntrial could be admitted and sent to the jury by agreement. After\nretrieving her exhibit list, however, Solomon acknowledged that her\nlist did not have the blood evidence as being used or admitted and did\nnot have the car seat evidence as being admitted. These exhibits were\nloaded onto the cart and taken to the jury, and it appears that the par-\nties agreed that these exhibits should have been shown as having been\nused and admitted during the trial. According to Solomon, there was\nanother list that she believed she must have inadvertently discarded,\n\"thinking [she] had everything transferred to one\" list. J.A. 2716.6\n   6\n     The record is unclear as to when this error on the court clerk’s part\ntook place. Solomon testified on redirect examination that she had both\nlists when she checked the defense and government exhibits. However,\nChellis’s testimony, Haynes’s testimony, and other portions of Solo-\nmon’s testimony indicate that the error occurred prior to the sorting of\nthe exhibits and Judge Lee’s order seems to interpret the testimony on\nthis issue in the latter fashion.\n\f                        UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                        25\nThere was also undisputed evidence that, after the jury deliberations\nhad concluded, Solomon had mistakenly returned a borrowed CD\nplayer to the AUSA’s office with an original CD exhibit in it.\n\n   For his part, AUSA Mellin testified that he last remembered seeing\nthe brown day planner during closing arguments the night before the\nevidence was submitted to the jury. He testified that he arrived at the\ncourtroom with AUSA Haynes the next morning and had a conversa-\ntion with defense counsel about the brown day planner early during\nthe process of sorting the evidence. He did not recall, however, asking\nto insert the photocopied pages in the brown leather binder in lieu of\nits entire contents or having it in his hand at the time of the conversa-\ntion. With regard to the black day planner, Mellin also did not exclude\nthe possibility that it was in the courtroom that morning, although he\ntestified that he was not aware of it being there and last remembers\nspecifically seeing it several days before closing arguments.\n\n   Based upon the testimony and evidence presented, the district court\nmade a number of findings and conclusions regarding the \"responsi-\nbility\" of the people involved in the trial process for the extraneous\nevidence reaching the jury. The district court attributed no responsi-\nbility to the court clerk or court security officer and no responsibility\nto any member of the defense team. Rather, the district court attri-\nbuted sole responsibility for the erroneous submission to Mellin and\nfound that the submission was the result of intentional misconduct on\nhis part. Specifically, the court found that \"Mellin [personally] placed\nthe two day planners with the evidence for the jury,\" and that \"[h]e\ndid this after the lawyers and court clerk had prepared all of the\nadmitted evidence for the jury.\" J.A. 2867. According to the district\ncourt’s view of the evidence,\n\n    after all of the lawyers and the courtroom clerk completed\n    their review of the evidence, Mr. Mellin placed the unadmit-\n    ted day planners in the evidence box. The unmarked black\n    day planner, inadmissible evidence, did not emerge from the\n    clear blue sky, and land in the jury room. Mr. Mellin had the\n    black day planner last and was well aware it was inadmissi-\n    ble. Similarly, Mr. Mellin’s submission of the whole brown\n    day planner to the jury was an intentional act. Mr. Mellin,\n    after discussing whether he could send the brown day plan-\n\f26                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\n     ner to the jury with defense counsel and acknowledging the\n     Court’s order excluding the whole day planner, inserted the\n     brown day planner in the evidence box as evidence for the\n     jury. . . .\n\n        The Court concludes that Mr. Mellin’s testimony indi-\n     cates much more than a lack of credibility; rather his testi-\n     mony demonstrates his intent to act outside the Orders of\n     this Court and the confines of the law. In sum, the Court\n     finds that Mr. Mellin’s actions with the day planners suggest\n     that this conduct was not a benign act or negligent error.\n     Rather this action was reckless, and it was intentional.\n\nJ.A. 2868-69.\n\n                        1. Standard of Review\n\n   We review for clear error the district court’s factual findings that\nAUSA Mellin intentionally placed the day planners with the evidence\nfor the jury. See United States v. Jones, 356 F.3d 529, 533 (4th Cir.\n2004). \"A finding is ‘clearly erroneous’ when although there is evi-\ndence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left\nwith the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been commit-\nted.’\" Scrimgeour v. Internal Revenue, 149 F.3d 318, 324 (4th Cir.\n1998) (quoting United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S.\n364, 395 (1948)). \"As an appellate court, we are ‘reluctant to overturn\nfactual findings of the trial court,’ and ‘this is doubly so where the\nquestion goes to the demeanor and credibility of witnesses at trial,\nsince the district court is so much better situated to evaluate these\nmatters.’\" Jones, 356 F.3d at 537 (quoting United States v. D’Anjou,\n16 F.3d 604, 614 (4th Cir. 1994)). \"Provided that there are two per-\nmissible ways to view the evidence,\" such findings \"are virtually\nunreviewable\" on appeal. Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n   Although we have the utmost respect for factual findings made by\na district court and, in particular, its credibility determinations, in this\ninstance we are compelled to vacate the district court’s factual finding\nthat Mellin intentionally placed or otherwise ensured that the day\nplanners in their entirety were taken to the jury room along with the\nadmitted exhibits. None of the witnesses observed Mellin or anyone\n\f                         UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                          27\nelse placing the day planners with the admitted evidence being taken\nto the jury. Nor did any of the witnesses profess knowledge of any\nevidence that Mellin or anyone else intentionally slipped the day plan-\nners to the jury in order to gain some advantage in the trial. Rather,\nthe district court’s factual finding of misconduct is based solely upon\nits belief that both day planners had been excluded in a pretrial ruling,\nthat the brown day planner had again been excluded at trial, that Mel-\nlin’s responses concerning the whereabouts of the day planners on the\nday the evidence was sorted were unconvincing, and that Mellin’s\ndemeanor generally indicated that he was not credible on the issue.\nHaving thoroughly reviewed the transcript from the trial and the evi-\ndentiary hearing, we are convinced that the district court’s finding of\nintentional misconduct rests upon several clearly erroneous underly-\ning factual findings.\n\n             2. The District Court’s Evidentiary Rulings\n\n   At the outset of the findings of fact, the district judge stated that\n\"[t]he trial judge’s responsibility is to rule on the admission or exclu-\nsion of evidence\" and to \"rule clearly so that the parties are aware of\nwhat evidence conforms to the law.\" J.A. 2857. However, the district\njudge erroneously found that, as a result of a pretrial motion in limine\nfiled by the government, he had \"issued a seventy-six page definitive\nopinion where [he had] excluded Doris Lentz’s day planners,\" J.A.\n2857-58, that he had denied a subsequent motion to reconsider this\nruling, and that he had again ruled the brown day planner inadmissi-\nble during trial. It is apparent that this erroneous belief regarding his\nrulings held special importance for the district judge in assigning\nresponsibility for the day planners reaching the jury room. Through-\nout the findings pertaining to this issue, the district judge frequently\nreferred to what he believed were government attempts to introduce\nthe evidence which had been refused.7 And, the district court obvi-\n  7\n    See J.A. 2835 (relating that he had \"admitted four photocopied pages\nfrom the brown day planner and two photocopied pages from the black\nday planner into evidence . . . to show [Doris’s] state of mind regarding\nher daughter’s return from a visit to Indiana,\" but that \"[a]ll other evi-\ndence in the two day planners was deemed inadmissible by the Court as\nirrelevant and unduly prejudicial\"); J.A. 2861 (stating that the black day\nplanner was \"excluded evidence\"); J.A. 2876 (stating that \"[p]rior to trial,\n\f28                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\nously relied upon this erroneous belief in concluding that Mellin\nplaced the day planners with the evidence with the \"intent to act out-\nside the Orders of this Court and the confines of the law.\" J.A. 2869.\n\n   Contrary to the district court’s opinion, the seventy-six page pre-\ntrial order did not specifically exclude Doris’s black day planner or\nbrown day planner from evidence. See United States v. Lentz, 282 F.\nSupp. 2d 399, 411-425 (E.D. Va. 2002).8 The district court was never\npresented with a motion to admit either of the day planners into evi-\ndence in their entirety. Although the district court’s pretrial ruling\nrejected evidence similar to that contained within the day planners,\nsee id at 423-24, the motion itself only sought a pretrial ruling regard-\ning those pages of each day planner that were ultimately ruled admis-\nsible.\n\n   Compounding this error, the district court also erroneously stated\nthat the government had \"attempted to persuade me to revise my rul-\nings on this evidence,\" and that AUSA \"Haynes sought to admit the\nbrown day planner in full despite the clear definitive ruling excluding\nthe full day planner.\" J.A. 2858. We can find no such definitive rul-\ning, nor any place in the record where Haynes unsuccessfully sought\nto admit the brown day planner in its entirety.\n\n     During her cross-examination of Rigger, Clark had introduced the\n\nthe Court excluded the majority of the evidence in the black and brown\nday planners as hearsay\"); J.A. 2879 (stating the he had \"declined to\nadmit\" the entries); J.A. 2885 (stating that \"[t]he black and brown day\nplanners contained several notes and articles that were not admitted\nbecause they were irrelevant and prejudicial\"); J.A. 2899 (noting that his\n\"pretrial ruling was very detailed\" and that \"Ms. Lentz’s day planner evi-\ndence was excluded\").\n   8\n     The district judge also stated that this court affirmed his evidentiary\nruling in an interlocutory appeal by the government. Our opinion, how-\never, only addressed the narrow issue appealed to us — whether the dis-\ntrict court had erred in excluding four specific statements allegedly made\nby Lentz and two specific statements allegedly made by Doris to other\nwitnesses. See United States v. Lentz, No. 02-19, 58 Fed. Appx. 961,\n2003 WL 253949 (4th Cir. Feb. 6, 2003).\n\f                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                       29\ntwo pages from the black day planner admitted in the pretrial order\nthat indicated that Julia was scheduled to return on April 24 rather\nthan April 23. On redirect examination, Haynes moved to introduce\nthe two pages from the brown day planner also admitted in the pretrial\norder that corroborated Rigger’s testimony that Doris was to pick up\nJulia on April 23. The precise colloquy from the redirect examination\nwas as follows:\n\n    Ms. Haynes: Your Honor, I’d move in Government’s\n    Exhibit 548, and there is no objection to it. If I can—\n\n    Ms. Clark: It’s just a two-page section because the whole\n    page is a bigger one.\n\n    Ms. Haynes: I think later we might try to want to move the\n    rest in. But for now, we’ll just move in these two pages.\n\n    The Court: Okay. Two pages of 548 will be received.\n\nJ.A. 599. At the evidentiary hearing, Clark, when asked if she recalled\nobjecting to Haynes’s supposed attempt to admit the entirety of the\nday planner testified as follows:\n\n    [Ms. Clark]. I do now that you’ve shown me the transcript\n    where I did object. What I did was object to the admission\n    of the entire document rather than just two pages. . . . [A]\n    [r]ather unintelligible one, but I thought I got the message\n    across.\n\nJ.A. 2463-64. In our view, if Clark intended to convey that message,\nshe failed to do so. Both the entire brown day planner and the excerpt\nadmitted in the pretrial order were marked by the government as\nExhibit 548. Although at first blush it might appear that Haynes was\nseeking to admit the entirety of Exhibit 548, Clark’s interruption of\nHaynes’s motion to introduce the evidence actually indicates that\nHaynes was only attempting to move in the two-page excerpt from\nthe brown day planner in response to Clark’s introduction of the two-\npage excerpt from the black day planner.\n\f30                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\n   Moreover, we cannot fairly interpret Clark’s statement as an objec-\ntion. At best, it was an interruption that might be viewed as clarifica-\ntion that Exhibit 548 consisted only of the admitted sections and not\nthe brown day planner in its entirety. Finally, we do not interpret the\ndistrict court’s ruling as one excluding disputed evidence. The collo-\nquy rather clearly demonstrates that Haynes only moved to introduce\nthe excerpt admitted pretrial and the district court simply admitted\nthat particular evidence.9\n\n   For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the district court\nclearly erred in finding that the government sought to introduce the\nentire contents of black and brown day planners into evidence pretrial\nand sought to introduce the entire contents of the brown day planner\nduring trial in contravention of the pretrial order. These clearly erro-\nneous findings regarding the government’s attempted use of the day\nplanners are significant because the district court inferred from this\nperceived pattern on the part of Mellin a steadfast intent and motive\non his part to get the day planners admitted into evidence in their\nentirety despite \"the Orders of th[e] Court and the confines of the\nlaw.\" J.A. 2869.\n  9\n   Mr. Dunham, who represented the defense team at the evidentiary\nhearing but was not present during the trial, appeared to acknowledge\nthat the transcript indicated no such ruling, and the district court seemed\nto have no independent recollection of it. Upon Clark’s testimony that\nshe made an objection, the following colloquy took place:\n      The Court:    Was [Ms. Clark’s objection] sustained or over-\n                    ruled?\n      Mr. Dunham:   The government withdrew the offer of the entire\n                    book, but noted that, I think, later, we might try\n                    to want to move the rest of it in. But, for now,\n                    we’ll just move in these two pages. So they\n                    withdrew the offer of the entire exhibit.\n      The Court:    All right. Did I admit the two pages at that time?\n      Mr. Dunham:   \"Yes, okay, two pages of 548 will be received.\"\n                    That was the Court’s ruling.\n      The Court:    All right. Thank you.\nJ.A. 2464. Counsel also acknowledged that it was \"technically correct\"\nthat the day planner was not actually offered in its entirety. J.A. 2823.\n\f                        UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                          31\n              3. The Responsibility of the Court Staff\n\n   The district court also clearly erred in finding that his courtroom\nstaff had no responsibility for the extraneous evidence reaching the\njury. This clearly erroneous factual finding, upon which the district\ncourt also bolstered its finding that Mellin must have intentionally\nslipped the evidence to the jury, is likewise not supported by a fair\nview of the evidence.\n\n   First, it is undisputed that the court clerk made at least two negli-\ngent errors in the handling of the exhibits in this case: she discarded\nthe complete exhibit list and kept an incomplete copy, and inadver-\ntently returned an original exhibit to the AUSA’s office. The district\ncourt acknowledged that the court clerk’s \"error of discarding the\noriginal exhibit list is significant because the unofficial clerk’s exhibit\nlist does not accurately reflect the exhibits that were identified and\nused at trial.\" J.A. 2860. However, the district court found that Solo-\nmon could not be held responsible for the extraneous evidence reach-\ning the jury because (1) the attorneys’ exhibit list reflected that the\nday planners were not admitted into evidence; (2) Solomon’s incom-\nplete \"exhibit list was accurate with respect to the black and brown\nday planners because it reflected the fact that only the photocopied\npages, and not the original day planners, were admitted into evi-\ndence;\" and (3) Solomon had never been in possession of the day\nplanners. J.A. 2860.\n\n   There is no dispute that counsel knew that only the small excerpts\nfrom the day planners had been introduced into evidence and, as far\nas we know, Solomon was never in possession of the complete day\nplanners, at least prior to sorting the evidence. But these findings do\nnot support the ultimate conclusion that Solomon had no responsibil-\nity whatsoever for the evidence getting to the jury room. It is the duty\nof the court clerk to be responsible for admitted exhibits during trial\nand jury deliberations and, as acknowledged by the court clerk, to\nassure that only admitted evidence goes to the jury at the conclusion\nof the trial. To do this, at the least the clerk must maintain an accurate\nlist of exhibits and handle them with great care. Here, all agree that\nthe court clerk reviewed the trial exhibits at the counsel tables for\nbetween 45 minutes and an hour while in the company of, and per-\nhaps being assisted by, up to twelve persons. Having supposedly sep-\n\f32                      UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\narated the admitted items from the non-admitted exhibits at the same\ncounsel table, the court clerk delegated exclusive responsibility to the\ncourt security officer to physically load the exhibits onto the cart, with\nthe assistance of whoever happened to help, for transport to the jury.\nThere is no indication that the court clerk at any time separated or\nreviewed these exhibits by herself or even took primary responsibility\nfor doing so. Nor is there any indication that, after going through the\ninitial process of meeting with counsel to separate and sort exhibits,\nshe physically segregated the exhibits away from the tables in order\nto check them off from the \"official\" court exhibit list to fulfill her\nduty of ensuring that no extraneous material was taken into the jury\nroom.\n\n   As a general observation, we think it highly unlikely that anyone\nwould have taken the brazen step of intentionally placing unadmitted\nexhibits either with the evidence on the table or in the loaded cart\nwhile in the presence of his or her colleagues, court personnel, oppos-\ning counsel, and law enforcement officers. The manner in which the\nevidence was sorted and loaded for transport to the jury, on the other\nhand, invited any one of numerous persons to inadvertently place the\nextraneous items with the \"admitted\" stack of the sorted evidence. In\nshort, had the court clerk taken the step of physically removing the\nadmitted exhibits from counsels’ tables to check them against her\nofficial exhibit list, the day planners (however they found their way\ninto the wrong pile) would likely have been discovered and removed\nwithout incident.\n\n   The district court’s findings that \"Scruggs did not cause the extra-\nneous evidence to go to the jury\" and \"cannot be held accountable for\nthe submission of the unadmitted black and brown day planners\nbecause his responsibility was limited to the transport of evidence,\"\nJ.A. 2859, are also clearly erroneous. Scruggs was not merely loading\ninto the cart the evidence that the courtroom clerk instructed him to\nload. According to his testimony, he was allowing numerous other\npersons to assist him in his duties and, according to Chellis, the day\nplanners were last known to be at counsel table near the area where\nthis activity was taking place. Thus, Scruggs or one of his helpers\nmay well have inadvertently placed the day planners in the cart while\nloading it. Scruggs, at least, was convinced that this was exactly how\nthe error had occurred. In addition, the district court never addressed\n\f                        UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                        33\nthe testimony of Scruggs and defense counsel over who was handling\nthe evidence after it was placed in the cart. According to Scruggs, no\none got near the cart after it was loaded. However, if the testimony\nof defense counsel is to be credited, Lieberman was invited to handle\nthe evidence after it was loaded.\n\n                          4. AUSA Mellin\n\n   Having erroneously found that the government repeatedly\nattempted to admit the day planners and that the district court rejected\nthese attempts both during the pretrial and trial proceedings, and hav-\ning erroneously exonerated the court staff from any responsibility for\nthe day planners finding their way into the jury room, the district\ncourt proceeded to make a rather broad leap to a finding that Mellin\nintentionally placed both day planners with the evidence after the law-\nyers and the clerk completed their review of the evidence in order to\ncircumvent the court’s prior rulings. These findings are unsupported\nby the evidence and clearly erroneous as well.\n\n                     a. The Black Day Planner\n\n    The district court found that Mellin \"is responsible for the inten-\ntional submission of the black day planner, excluded evidence, to the\njury\" based upon his conclusion that \"Mellin’s demeanor and testi-\nmony demonstrate that he was being less than candid with the Court\nwith respect to the black day planner.\" J.A. 2861. This adverse credi-\nbility determination is, in turn, grounded in the following three obser-\nvations by the trial court: (1) Mellin \"was the last person known to\nhave handled the black day planner,\" but did not \"recall its appear-\nance in court on the day the evidence went to the jury;\" (2) Mellin tes-\ntified that he \"was unaware of the location of the black day planner\nduring the trial,\" but filed a response to Lentz’s motion for a new trial\nstating that \"both day planners were in the courtroom on the Govern-\nment’s counsel table;\" and (3) Mellin \"was acutely aware of the\nimportance of the unadmitted black day planner because he directed\nthe jury’s attention to it in his closing argument, but he appeared to\ndiminish its importance on the day of the hearing.\" J.A. 2861-62.\nThese observations, however, are wholly insufficient to support the\ndistrict court’s credibility determination or the ultimate finding of\nintentional conduct.\n\f34                      UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\n   First, the fact that Mellin did not recall seeing the black day plan-\nner when the evidence was being sorted, but was known to have had\nit a few days before, does not support an adverse credibility determi-\nnation. According to the undisputed evidence, Chellis, at Mellin’s\nrequest, retrieved the black day planner from the evidence room a few\ndays before closing arguments to make copies of the pages introduced\nby defense counsel. Chellis testified that he placed the black day plan-\nner with the copies in Mellin’s chair at their office and that he later\nobserved the black day planner in the courtroom at the government’s\ntable. However, none of the other witnesses testified that they saw the\nblack day planner in the courtroom on the day the evidence was\nsorted (although Scruggs averred in his affidavit that he did). For his\npart, Mellin confirmed that he asked Chellis to obtain copies of the\ntwo admitted pages from the day planner in preparation for his clos-\ning argument. He did not deny that the black day planner was in the\ncourtroom or deny the possibility that he might have brought it there.\nIn short, Mellin’s testimony that he did not recall seeing the black day\nplanner in the courtroom is not contradicted and is hardly incriminat-\ning. The only evidence presented was that the black day planner was\nlast seen on the government’s table, but not in Mellin’s personal pos-\nsession.\n\n   Second, the government’s response to Lentz’s motion, indicating\nthat the black day planner was in the courtroom on government’s\ncounsel table, is not inconsistent with Mellin’s testimony that he did\nnot personally recall seeing the black day planner in the courtroom.\nMellin testified that he did not personally observe the black day plan-\nner it in the courtroom, but Chellis testified that he did see it on coun-\nsel’s table at some point after he made copies, which would render the\ngovernment’s response entirely consistent with the AUSA Office’s\ninternal investigation into the matter. In addition, the court security\nofficer, at least early on, was attesting that it was in the courtroom as\nwell.\n\n   Finally, the district court clearly erred in finding that Mellin’s use\nof the black day planner during closing was inconsistent with his\nposition at the evidentiary hearing that he placed no particular impor-\ntance upon it. During closing, Mellin argued that the black day plan-\nner, which indicated an April 24 pick-up date for Julia, was consistent\nwith Lentz’s April 20th telephone message moving the pick-up from\n\f                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                        35\nthe 24th to the 23rd and that, in any event, the difference was irrele-\nvant because neither date coincided with Julia’s return ticket. If any-\nthing, Mellin’s argument demonstrates that he did not view the black\nday planner entries as important, but rather as a red herring raised by\nthe defense that warranted only a brief explanation in closing.\n\n                    b. The Brown Day Planner\n\n   The district court’s finding that Mellin was also responsible for the\nintentional submission of the brown day planner is also clearly erro-\nneous. The district court based this finding upon (1) statements by\nseveral witnesses that Mellin had physical possession of the brown\nday planner during closing argument the day before the evidence was\nsorted; and (2) the testimony of defense counsel that, on the following\nmorning, Mellin asked for permission to remove the contents and sub-\nmit the brown leather cover with only the admitted pages and that he\nhad the brown day planner and the admitted copies in hand at the\ntime. This testimony is insufficient to support the district court’s\ndetermination that Mellin intentionally slipped the brown day planner\nwith its entire contents into the evidence being taken to the jury.\n\n   First, it was patently insufficient to rest a finding of intentional\nmisconduct on the undisputed fact that Mellin handled the brown day\nplanner during his closing argument and, while doing so, referred to\nits admitted entries pertaining to Julia’s expected date of return.\nAccording to the district court, Mellin’s \"act of holding the brown day\nplanner before the jury [during closing] served to focus their attention\non it because he wanted to make sure they reviewed it. Accordingly,\nit is reasonable to infer that Mr. Mellin was himself focused on the\nimportance of the brown day planner.\" J.A. 2864.\n\n   Although the district court does not elaborate upon these infer-\nences, we can only assume that the court believed Mellin concocted\na plan before closing to sneak the unadmitted and undiscussed por-\ntions of the planner into the jury room — evidence he never directly\nattempted to introduce — with the admitted portions that he discussed\nin his closing and that, as part of this plan, he drew some special\nattention to the brown day planner to ensure that the jury looked at\nit. Again, the district court’s view of the evidence was no doubt\ntainted by its erroneous belief that the day planner had been excluded\n\f36                      UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\nin the pretrial order and again during trial. Moreover, it is not reason-\nable to infer from Mellin’s mere use of the planner in closing argu-\nment that Mellin viewed the unadmitted contents of the brown day\nplanner as so critical or important that he would concoct a plan to\nhighlight the brown day planner to the jury in closing arguments and\nthen slip it to the jury in contravention of court orders. During his\nclosing argument, Mellin referred briefly to the admitted pages from\nthe day planner which corroborated the testimony of numerous wit-\nnesses that Doris told them she was bound for Lentz’s house on April\n23 to pick up Julia. The only other demonstrated importance that the\npages held for Mellin was that they contradicted the black day plan-\nner pages which, according to Lieberman, had been submitted to dem-\nonstrate \"an inconsistency and some confusion with the government’s\ntheory\" that \"on April 23rd of 1996, Doris Lentz went to Jay Lentz’s\nhouse to pick up their daughter.\" J.A. 2488.\n\n    We are also unable to endorse the district court’s finding of inten-\ntional conduct based upon defense counsel’s assertion that Mellin\nrequested their permission to insert the admitted excerpt from the\nbrown day planner inside the leather cover. Clark and Lieberman tes-\ntified that Mellin approached Clark and sought approval to remove\nthe contents of the brown day planner from the brown leather cover\nand submit the cover with the two admitted pages. According to Lie-\nberman, however, the request was made before Solomon even\nchecked the exhibits. Lieberman testified that, \"somewhat because of\nthe contentious nature of the relationship Mr. Mellin and I have had\nover the year,\" he \"said, almost sarcastically to Mr. Mellin, you know,\nthat’s fine, Steve, as long as you take everything else out.\" J.A. 2492.\n\n   Mellin acknowledged having a brief conversation with defense\ncounsel about the brown day planner, but did not recall making this\nalleged request. Mellin’s inability to recall caused the district court\n\"great concern.\" J.A. 2865. However, a fair reading of the evidence\ndoes not support the inference that Mellin was not credible, or that\nthis conversation was part of his plan to intentionally slip the entire\ncontents of the day planner to the jury. As lead prosecutor, Mellin was\noverseeing the process of sorting the exhibits, but no one has asserted\nthat he was involved in the hands-on sorting of evidence. There was\nno particular controversy going on that would have caused Mellin to\nremember the specifics of that morning. The prosecution team wit-\n\f                         UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                           37\nnesses had no recollection of a conversation between Clark and Mel-\nlin about the brown day planner contents. Solomon and Scruggs were\nin the area at the time of the purported conversation, but they also tes-\ntified that they overheard no such conversation. Defense counsel\nacknowledged that they did not inform Solomon of any agreement to\nsubmit the admitted two pages within the brown leather cover and\nthey admitted that no one from the defense team ever saw or exam-\nined the brown day planner to see if the contents had been removed\nand replaced. Indeed, it is quite a stretch to interpret even the defense\ncounsel’s recitation of what occurred as an \"agreement\" to submit the\nevidence in a different form. According to Lieberman, Mellin asked\nfor permission to submit Government’s Exhibit 548 (which consisted\nof the four photocopied pages) inside the brown leather binder (which\nwas also marked Exhibit 548 but never admitted in its entirety) before\nthe exhibits were even checked by the court clerk and received a sar-\ncastic response. And, Solomon testified that Exhibit 548 was sent to\nthe jury in its admitted form. Thus, it seems more probable that Mel-\nlin, assuming he ever made the request, simply abandoned it in light\nof Lieberman’s sarcastic response.10\n\n  10\n     To the extent that the district court relied upon findings that Mellin’s\ntestimony conflicted with that of his team members, we find that deter-\nmination also to be unsupported by the evidence and insufficient to sup-\nport a finding of \"intentional conduct\" on Mellin’s part. For example, the\ndistrict court erroneously found that Mellin testified \"that he was not in\nthe courtroom when the evidence was prepared for the jury.\" J.A. 2865.\nMellin testified that he walked to the courtroom with Haynes, left shortly\nthereafter to make sure that the audio clip CDs had been completed by\ninformation specialist Bowie, and returned to the courtroom approxi-\nmately 20 to 30 minutes later. Accordingly, by Mellin’s account, he was\npresent in the courtroom early in the process and again at the conclusion\nof the process. Similarly, the district court found Bowie’s testimony that\nhe prepared the audio clips the night before to be inconsistent with Mel-\nlin’s testimony that he left the courtroom to work with Bowie on the\nclips. Although the testimony of neither man is particularly clear, a con-\nclusion that it was inconsistent, thereby indicating untruthfulness on the\npart of Mellin, is simply not a fair reading of the testimony.\n\f38                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\n                             5. Conclusion\n\n   Having thoroughly reviewed the transcript from the trial and the\nevidentiary hearing, we hold that the district court’s finding that Mel-\nlin engaged in intentional misconduct is built upon several clearly\nerroneous underlying factual findings and an impermissible view of\nthe evidence of record.\n\n   It is clear that the evidentiary hearing did little to solve the mystery\nof how the day planners found their way into the jury room. Accord-\ning to Mr. Chellis, both day planners were in the courtroom prior to\nthe sorting of the evidence and that he placed the brown day planner\non the back table where the admitted evidence was being segregated.\nScruggs admitted that he saw the brown day planner on the rear table\nand, in an earlier affidavit, stated that he had seen both day planners\non the government’s table. The court clerk denies ever seeing either\nday planner anywhere. By all accounts, three attorneys and one staff\nperson with the defense team, three attorneys and one staff person\nwith the prosecution team, two law enforcement officers, and two\ncourt officers were all present at various times during the sorting pro-\ncess. The evidence was sorted on and around four tables in the court-\nroom and involved \"hundreds\" of pieces of documentary and physical\nevidence. Not a single witness observed Mellin place the brown or\nblack day planner with the evidence to be placed on the cart. There\nis no direct evidence whatsoever, and plainly insufficient circumstan-\ntial evidence, that Mellin placed any item on the cart or even that\nMellin handled either day planner after the exhibits had been checked\nor while the cart was being loaded. There is no evidence that Mellin\nwas ever alone in the area of the exhibits. And, there is no evidence\nthat Mellin told anyone to include the day planners with the admitted\nevidence or to place them in the cart.11\n   11\n      The district court, near the end of the hearing and after Mellin had\ntestified, also remained clearly in doubt:\n      In fact, what’s missing for me is still no one seems to want to\n      explain what happened to the [brown day] planner or the black\n      day planner, how they ended up in the courtroom. How they got\n      to the jury room and I’m — I’m waiting for your arguments to\n      hear what happened to it. How did these two items that were\n      never, ever admitted end[ ] up in the jury room?\nJ.A. 2751. Unfortunately, the district court appeared to believe that fault,\nindeed intentional fault, had to be placed somewhere, despite the univer-\nsal lack of knowledge on everyone’s part.\n\f                         UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                          39\n   In our view, despite the best intentions on the part of the district\ncourt and the frustrations associated with this serious incident, the\nevidence simply cannot support the district court’s findings that Mel-\nlin intentionally slipped these items into the jury room in contraven-\ntion of court orders and at risk to his legal career.12 The district court\nclearly erred in finding that it had excluded both day planners from\nevidence pretrial and that it had excluded the brown day planner dur-\ning a renewed attempt on the part of the government during trial, and\nerred in finding that these attempts demonstrated a motive on the part\nof Mellin to get the day planners before the jury notwithstanding the\ncourt’s rulings.\n\n   The district court also clearly erred in finding that his court staff\nhad no responsibility whatsoever for the extraneous evidence reaching\nthe jury room (although we acknowledge that their failures were\nlikely the result of negligence, inattention, or poor procedures on their\npart). And, the district court clearly erred in concluding that Mellin\nintentionally placed the brown and black day planner with the evi-\ndence to go to the jury based upon testimony that he handled both of\nthe day planners in the days leading up to the sorting of the evidence\nand handled the brown day planner prior to the exhibits being\nchecked by the court clerk, and the district court’s perception that the\ncontents of those planners were especially significant to him.\n\n  Accordingly, we reverse the district court’s finding of intentional\nmisconduct on the part of the government and, in particular, Mellin.\n  12\n     Indeed, with regard to any evidence of intentional misconduct, it\nmakes no more sense to assert that Mellin intentionally placed the items\nwith the evidence in order to bolster his case than it does to assert that\nthe defense team intentionally placed the items with the evidence in\norder to create a basis for a new trial motion. Neither theory is supported\nby the record and we frankly think it strains reason to find on this record\nthat an AUSA or anyone else would have even attempted to do so in the\nmidst of all of the people present and involved in the process at the time.\nIn short, there is plenty of blame to go around. The evidence would sup-\nport a finding that the exhibits reached the jury room as a result of negli-\ngent or inadvertent actions on the part of the court staff, on the part of\nthe government and its team, or on the part of someone associated with\nthe defense team. It most likely reached the jury room as a result of the\ninadvertent errors of some combination thereof.\n\f40                      UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\nAs an appellate court, we are reluctant to overturn factual findings of\na district court. Such findings, particularly those as to credibility, are\nentitled to great deference, but they are not unreviewable. When find-\nings are based on an erroneous recitation of the record and impermis-\nsible inferences drawn from it, we are compelled to vacate them.\nHere, the evidence was insufficient to support the district court’s find-\ning of intentional misconduct or even exclusive responsibility on the\npart of Mellin for the submission of the extraneous evidence, and the\ndistrict court clearly erred in so ruling.\n\n                         C. New Trial Grant\n\n  Finally, we consider the district court’s decision to order a new trial\non the kidnapping charge because the unadmitted evidence deprived\nLentz of a fair trial.\n\n   Under Rule 33, the district court \"may vacate any judgment and\ngrant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.\" Fed. R. Crim.\nP. 33(a). \"If prejudicial evidence that was not introduced at trial\ncomes before the jury, the defendant is entitled to a new trial.\" United\nStates v. Barnes, 747 F.2d 246, 250 (4th Cir. 1984). In determining\nwhether evidence is prejudicial, \"[t]he general standard . . . is whether\nthere is a reasonable possibility that the jury’s verdict was influenced\nby the material that improperly came before it.\" Id. (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). \"Furthermore, there is a presumption of prejudice\nwhere such improper evidence has been made available to the jury,\nand the burden is on the government to prove that it is harmless.\" Id.\nat 250-51. It is not necessary that the defendant prove that the prejudi-\ncial evidence was intentionally placed before the jury to obtain a new\ntrial; accidental or inadvertent submission of the materials will suf-\nfice. See United States v. Greene, 834 F.2d 86, 88 (4th Cir. 1987). We\nreview the district court’s decision to grant a new trial for abuse of\ndiscretion. See United States v. Cheek, 94 F.3d 136, 140 (4th Cir.\n1996).\n\n   Because there is no dispute that the brown day planner and the\nblack day planner were present in the jury room and reviewed by the\njurors during their deliberations, we proceed directly to the question\nof whether the district court abused its discretion in ruling that the\n\f                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                       41\ngovernment failed to overcome the presumption that the extraneous\nevidence was prejudicial.\n\n  In his motion to set aside the jury’s verdict, Lentz asserted that he\nwas prejudiced by the following notations contained within the brown\nday planner:\n\n    \"School rec’d threatening phone calls. Only way Julia stay\n    Jay sign stat. That he understands cannot pu Julia @ school\"\n\n    \"4th floor of courthouse - Protective Order -Ex Parte Order\n    - he’s served first\"\n\n    \"Judges in Arlington want criminal charge - protective\n    order\"\n\n    \"#XX-XXXXXXX 6/21/95; Chris Bibro; trespassing inci-\n    dent/harassing phone calls -\"Karen Crane, Commonwealth\n    Atty’s Office 358-7273 protective order/advice\" - \"Officer\n    Williams #951-204033\"\n\n\"Det. Capitello - Arl. Co. PD 358-4240; 6/12 spoke with 1:55 p.m.\"\n\n    \"358-4868 - Eileen Segal - Free counseling for domestic\n    violence support group\"\n\nJ.A. 3320. Lentz also asserted that he was prejudiced by the following\nnotations contained within the black day planner:\n\n    Jan 3, 1996 - Jay pu Julia - she said she wanted to stay with\n    mommy - he told her to stop playing games and get her coat\n    on. . . .\n\n    January 6, 1996 - \"My daddy told me you called the police\n    on him. Is that true?\"\n\n    January 7, 1996 - \"My daddy told me when I was a baby I\n    almost died because you couldn’t feed me because you were\n    taking drugs.\"\n\f42                      UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\n     January 10, 1996 - \"Do you want my dad’s house? My dad\n     told me you want money from him. Is that true?\"\n\n     January 11, 1996 - \"My dad says he loves me more than\n     you. He says he loves me so much he wishes he could have\n     me - live with me.\"\n\n     February 11, 1996 - 5:05 p.m. rec’d abusive phone call -\n     where the hell was I - why not pick Julia up between 4-4:30\n     - said he hadn’t asked for early pu therefore pu at 6:00. . . .\n\n     February 23, 1996 - My daddy told me the judge was going\n     to make him pick me up from school.\"\n\nJ.A. 3321.\n\n   The district court grouped the extraneous evidence into four cate-\ngories: (1) Doris’s notes concerning harassing and threatening tele-\nphone calls made by Lentz to her and to Julia’s day care center; (2)\nDoris’s notes indicating that she was pursuing a protective order; (3)\nDoris’s notes documenting statements made by Lentz to Julia; and (4)\nDoris’s notations of telephone numbers for an Arlington County\ndetective and for a domestic violence support group. After determin-\ning that the statements contained within the day planners violated\nLentz’s Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him and\nwere not admissible under any exception to the hearsay rules, the dis-\ntrict court concluded that they were indeed prejudicial and warranted\nthe grant of a new trial. Like the district court, we examine each cate-\ngory of notations for their prejudicial effect.\n\n   With regard to Doris’s notes concerning Lentz’s harassing and\nthreatening telephone calls made to her and to Julia’s day care center,\nthe district court held that the evidence was prejudicial because it sug-\ngested that Lentz was verbally abusive to Doris and the school staff\nin the months just prior to Doris’s disappearance. We cannot say that\nthis was an abuse of discretion, at least insofar as the notation con-\ncerning Lentz’s threatening telephone call to the day care center.\nAlthough the jury heard testimony and recordings demonstrating that\nLentz’s verbal harassment of Doris continued after the separation, the\n\f                        UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                        43\njury heard no evidence regarding Lentz’s alleged harassment of day-\ncare center staff. The fact that Lentz’s anger overflowed from Doris\nto others connected with her reflects on Lentz’s dangerousness.\n\n   With regard to Doris’s notes indicating that she was pursuing a\nprotective order against Lentz, the district court held that this evi-\ndence was prejudicial because there was no evidence at trial that\nDoris had sought or obtained a protective order against Lentz, and\ncertainly not in the months just prior to her disappearance. In addi-\ntion, the district court rejected the government’s argument that these\nnotations were merely cumulative of the evidence regarding Doris’s\nfear of Lentz. Again, we cannot say that this was an abuse of discre-\ntion. A number of witnesses testified that Doris was fearful of Lentz\nand that she had taken measures to avoid isolated contact with him.\nHowever, evidence that Doris had taken the additional step of pursu-\ning a protective order and the progress she had apparently made with\nthe authorities is of a quite different character — it may well have\nindicated to the jury that Doris had a recent and renewed fear of phys-\nical assault at the hands of Lentz in the months just prior to her disap-\npearance and that she feared such physical assault enough to take\nlegal measures to protect herself. Although such evidence may well\nbe relevant and admissible in proper form, the district court did not\nabuse its discretion in concluding that the government failed to estab-\nlish that the evidence was not prejudicial in the form presented.\n\n   With regard to Doris’s notes documenting Lentz’s alleged state-\nments to Julia about Doris, the district court ruled that the notes were\nprejudicial \"bad character\" evidence inadmissible under Rule 404 of\nthe Rules of Evidence, and \"cast Mr. Lentz in the worst possible light\nas a husband and a father.\" J.A. 2887. As noted by the district court,\nthe statements made by Lentz pertained to matters about which the\njury was already aware, such as the acute hostility between the par-\nties, the sale of their marital home and the division of its proceeds,\nand Doris’s attempts to always exchange Julia at the daycare center.\nEvidence that Lentz told his daughter about these matters, however,\nis of a more prejudicial nature because the jury could reasonably have\ninferred that Lentz was disparaging Doris to her daughter in the\nmonths prior to Doris’s disappearance in an attempt to alienate her\nfrom her mother and perhaps ameliorate the absence of her mother in\nthe future.\n\f44                      UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\n   Finally, with regard to Doris’s notations of telephone numbers for\nan Arlington County detective and for a domestic violence support\ngroup, the district court held that the evidence was prejudicial because\nthere was no evidence before the jury that Doris had been the victim\nof domestic abuse since her separation from Lentz in 1993. We can-\nnot say that this was an abuse of discretion because, as the district\ncourt noted, these references suggest that Lentz’s physically abusive\nbehavior towards Doris had continued after their separation.\n\n   To conclude, the district court held that the government failed to\ndemonstrate that there was no reasonable possibility that the jury’s\nverdict was not influenced by the notations contained within the black\nand brown day planners. In particular, the district court noted the cir-\ncumstantial nature of the evidence against Lentz, the extended length\nof the jury’s deliberations in the case, the fact that the jury at one\npoint was deadlocked, and the fact that, during the penalty phase,\nseven jurors indicated that they had residual doubt. When we look at\nthe information contained in the day planners in light of the district\ncourt’s evidentiary rulings restricting the government’s evidence\nregarding the actions of Doris and Lentz prior to her disappearance,\nwe can find no abuse of discretion in the decision of the district judge\nto grant a new trial. This is particularly so when one factors in that\nLentz was precluded from rebutting in any way the evidence of\nactions taken by him and statements attributed to him.13 Because we\ncannot say that this was an abuse of discretion, we affirm the district\ncourt’s grant of a new trial.\n\n                             IV. Remand\n\n   Our decision to affirm the district court’s granting of a new trial of\ncourse necessitates a remand. We have recognized that, even in the\nabsence of established bias, reassignment to a different judge on\nremand \"is appropriate in unusual circumstances where both for the\njudge’s sake and the appearance of justice an assignment to a differ-\nent judge is salutary and in the public interest, especially as it mini-\nmizes even a suspicion of partiality.\" United States v. North Carolina,\n180 F.3d 574, 582-83 (4th Cir. 1999) (internal quotation marks omit-\n  13\n    We express no opinion, however, regarding the admissibility of these\ncategories of evidence on retrial.\n\f                        UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                        45\nted); see also United States v. Gugliemi, 929 F.2d 1001, 1007 (4th\nCir. 1991). Specifically, we consider:\n\n    (1) whether the original judge would reasonably be expected\n    upon remand to have substantial difficulty in putting out of\n    his or her mind previously expressed views or findings\n    determined to be erroneous or based on evidence that must\n    be rejected,\n\n    (2) whether reassignment is advisable to preserve the\n    appearance of justice, and\n\n    (3) whether reassignment would entail waste and duplica-\n    tion out of proportion to any gain in preserving the appear-\n    ance of fairness.\n\nId. at 583 (internal quotation marks omitted); cf. Nell v. United States,\n450 F.2d 1090, 1093 (4th Cir. 1971) (outrageous conduct of attorney\nmay warrant assignment to different judge). Because this is an\nunusual case, we direct that on remand, the case be assigned to a dif-\nferent judge for a new trial.\n\n   Prior to the evidentiary hearing, the government filed a motion ask-\ning the district judge to recuse himself from holding the hearing into\nhow the extraneous evidence found its way into the jury room\nbecause it would necessarily require the judge to weigh the credibility\nof the government representatives against his long-time court person-\nnel. The government also took the extraordinary step of seeking a writ\nof mandamus from this court to recuse the district judge, which we\nsummarily denied.\n\n   Since then, however, the district court has extensively criticized the\ngovernment team and has decided that there was intentional miscon-\nduct on Mellin’s part during trial and when the evidence was submit-\nted. We have held that such findings are not supported by the record\nbefore us and must be vacated, but \"imply [no] personal criticism\" of\nthe district judge in doing so. Guglielmi, 929 F.2d at 1008 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). We remain concerned, however, that the\ndistrict judge \"cannot reasonably be expected to erase the earlier\n\f46                      UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\nimpressions from his . . . mind or may tend to lean over backwards\nor overreact in an effort to be fair and impartial\" on retrial. Id. (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted). In addition, we recognize that Mellin,\nif he is part of the prosecution team on remand, would be understand-\nably distracted from his task of representing the United States in this\nvery serious case. Although the district judge is very familiar with the\ncase and has already ruled upon various issues, the grant of a new trial\nwipes the slate clean. We do not believe that any waste or duplication\nwould be out of proportion to the appearance of fairness a reassign-\nment will preserve.\n\n                         V. Appeal No. 04-8\n\n   Mellin has filed a separate appeal challenging the district court’s\nfindings that he intentionally submitted the evidence to the jury. Lentz\nfiled a motion to dismiss Mellin’s appeal because (1) Mellin filed his\nappeal out of time and (2) Mellin lacks standing to appeal the order\nbecause a prosecutor may not independently appeal an order appealed\nby the government unless it also imposes sanctions upon the prosecu-\ntor individually. Because we have concluded that the findings chal-\nlenged in Mellin’s separate appeal were clearly erroneous and they\nhave been vacated in Appeal No. 04-7, we dismiss Mellin’s appeal as\nmoot.\n\n                            VI. Conclusion\n\n   For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the district court’s judgment\nof acquittal, vacate the district court’s findings of intentional miscon-\nduct on the part of the government, and affirm the district court’s\ngrant of a new trial based upon the prejudicial effect of the extraneous\nevidence. We also direct that this case be assigned to a different judge\non remand.\n\n     AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED\n\nMICHAEL, Circuit Judge, dissenting in part and concurring in part:\n\n   I respectfully dissent from the majority’s decision to reverse the\njudgment of acquittal entered by the district court. For a kidnapping\n\f                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                        47\nto occur, the perpetrator must hold his victim for an appreciable\nperiod of time. Here, the jury could only guess that Jay Lentz (Lentz)\nheld Doris Lentz (Doris) prior to her death: there is no direct evidence\nof a holding, nor is there any evidence from which a holding can be\nreasonably inferred. In short, the government did not prove a kidnap-\nping. Because reversal of the judgment of acquittal means that the\ncase against Lentz remains open, I concur in parts III, IV, and V of\nthe majority’s opinion, which, among other things, vacate the district\ncourt’s misconduct findings against the government, affirm the grant\nof a new trial, and deal with procedures on remand. My reasons for\ndissenting from part II.C of the majority opinion follow.\n\n                                   I.\n\n   Lentz was indicted for kidnapping that resulted in the victim’s\ndeath, in violation of the Federal Kidnapping Act, 18 U.S.C.\n§ 1201(a). To convict Lentz, the government had to prove: (1) that he\nwillfully caused Doris to be transported in interstate commerce; (2)\nthat he unlawfully seized, confined, inveigled, decoyed, kidnapped,\nabducted, or carried her away; (3) that he held Doris for ransom or\nreward or otherwise; and (4) that her death resulted. Ante at 9-10. The\ngovernment’s theory at trial was that Lentz devised an intricate\nscheme to lure Doris into driving from Virginia to his house in Mary-\nland, and at some point after she arrived, he killed her. Ante at 3-9.\nThe government, however, did not attempt to prove when, where, or\nhow Lentz killed Doris, nor did it offer any evidence or theory about\nwhat Lentz did between the time Doris arrived at his house and the\ntime of her death. The government simply failed to prove the holding\nelement of kidnapping.\n\n   At the close of the government’s case, Lentz made a motion for\njudgment of acquittal pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure\n29, asserting that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction\nbecause the government did not prove the holding element. According\nto Lentz, the jury could do nothing \"other than speculate that Ms.\nLentz was ever held.\" J.A. 1603. When the district court turned to the\ngovernment for a response, the following exchange occurred:\n\n    THE COURT: Tell me what the detention is in this case.\n\f48                      UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\n     [AN AUSA]: The detention began, Your Honor, when\n     [Doris] was inveigled. She was being held when she started\n     to be inveigled over to [Lentz’s] house. And when she got\n     to his house, he had to hold her to kill her.\n\n       Somehow or other, he detained her there and he killed\n     her.\n\n     THE COURT: What evidence do you have of any of that?\n\n     [AN AUSA]: That [Doris] was ultimately killed. And that\n     [Lentz] had to hold her to detain her to ultimately kill her.\n     ...\n\nJ.A. 1614-15. The district court requested briefing on the holding\nissue and permitted the trial to proceed. Then, at the close of all the\nevidence, Lentz renewed his Rule 29 motion, asserting that the gov-\nernment had still not introduced any evidence that Doris was held\nprior to her death. The district court again took the motion under\nadvisement, this time stating that it would allow the case to proceed\nto verdict in order to \"preserv[e] the government’s right to appeal in\nthe event a guilty verdict is returned but then is set aside by the grant-\ning of a judgment of acquittal.\" J.A. 2351.\n\n   The government’s closing argument to the jury is telling for its fail-\nure to point to any evidence that satisfies the holding element of kid-\nnapping. The lead AUSA said to the jury, \"Ladies and gentlemen, we\ndon’t know exactly what happened to Doris Lentz when she got to the\ndefendant’s house on April the 23rd. But we know that she ended up\ndead.\" J.A. 1940. The AUSA also reminded the jury that \"[t]his is not\na murder case. And we’re not required to prove the cause and manner\nof death, how it happened, where it happened. We don’t have to prove\nthat. [We] can’t do it in this case . . . .\" J.A. 1949. The AUSA then\nattempted to summarize the evidence tending to prove each of the\nfour elements necessary to convict Lentz of federal kidnapping. The\ntranscript of the closing argument shows that the government spent\ntwenty-three pages (J.A. 1950-74) summarizing the evidence that\nshowed Lentz had inveigled Doris into traveling to his house, twelve\npages (J.A. 1976-87) summarizing the evidence that showed Doris\ndied as a result of that trip, and two pages (J.A. 1974-76) summariz-\n\f                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                        49\ning the evidence that showed Doris had to travel across a state bound-\nary to reach Lentz’s house. In contrast, the government’s discussion\nof the holding element was limited to three lines. Specifically, the\nAUSA said, \"Next element, held for his purpose. This one is very\nstraight[forward]. All you have to do is find that he held her long\nenough to kill her.\" J.A. 1976. This argument on holding highlights\nthe fundamental failing in the government’s case. It is wrong as a\nmatter of law because the holding in a kidnapping must be for an\nappreciable period. What is more important, the AUSA did not direct\nthe jury to any evidence that would support a finding that Doris was\nheld. The jury nevertheless returned a guilty verdict. Shortly thereaf-\nter, the district court granted Lentz’s Rule 29 motion because \"the\nholding element of kidnaping was not proved.\" J.A. 2387. The gov-\nernment appeals that decision.\n\n                                  II.\n\n   In reviewing a judgment of acquittal, we \"view the evidence in the\nlight most favorable to the prosecution and inquire whether any ratio-\nnal trier of fact could find the essential elements of the crime beyond\na reasonable doubt.\" United States v. Wilson, 118 F.3d 228, 234 (4th\nCir. 1997) (citing Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979)).\nLentz does not contest that the government proved three of the four\nelements of kidnapping, specifically (1) that he inveigled Doris (2)\ninto traveling across state lines and (3) that her death resulted. Proof\nof the element that must precede the death — a holding — is con-\ntested. Therefore, the narrow question raised by the government’s\nappeal is whether the evidence would allow any rational trier of fact\nto conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Lentz held Doris prior to\nher death. In answering this question, we must keep in mind that:\n\n       The very existence of the Jackson test presupposes that\n    juries accurately charged on the elements of a crime and on\n    the strict burden of persuasion to which they must hold the\n    prosecution, nevertheless may occasionally convict even\n    when it can be said that no rational trier of fact could find\n    guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The test was adopted to\n    provide an additional safeguard against that possibility, and\n    was to give added assurance that guilt should never be found\n    except on a rationally supportable state of near certitude.\n\f50                      UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\nEvans-Smith v. Taylor, 19 F.3d 899, 905-06 (4th Cir. 1994) (internal\nquotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n   To satisfy the holding element of the Federal Kidnapping Act, the\ngovernment was required to prove that Lentz imposed \"an unlawful\nphysical or mental restraint for an appreciable period against [Doris’s]\nwill and with a willful intent so to confine [her].\" Chatwin v. United\nStates, 326 U.S. 455, 460 (1946). Throughout this case the govern-\nment has argued that the evidence satisfies the holding element for\neither of two reasons. First, the government argues that Doris was\nheld \"by deception from the time she was inveigled or deceived into\ntraveling from Virginia to Maryland through the time that she came\ninto Lentz’s presence.\" Ante at 13; see also Appellant’s Br. at 52. Sec-\nond, the government argues that \"murder is the ultimate holding,\"\nAppellant’s Br. at 58, and therefore \"the evidence that [Lentz] mur-\ndered [Doris], by whatever means, is sufficient to establish a holding\nby physical restraint.\" Id. at 62. In other words, the government\nargues that the holding element has been implicitly satisfied because,\nas Lentz concedes, the evidence was sufficient to show (1) that Doris\ndrove to Lentz’s house and (2) that Doris died as a result of her visit\nthere. Again, according to the government, either of these events con-\nstitutes a holding.\n\n   The majority does not rely on either of the government’s theories\nof holding. Instead, it concludes that \"the circumstantial evidence in\nthe case supports the jury’s finding that Lentz himself . . . [held Doris]\nagainst her will separate and apart from her trip to the house.\" Ante\nat 16. Specifically, the majority says that a jury could reasonably con-\nclude that once Doris arrived at Lentz’s house, he brought her inside\nand held her there for an appreciable amount of time before her death.\nAnte at 14-16. In support of this conclusion, the majority cites six\npieces of evidence: (1) Lentz told his daughter’s babysitter, Marilyn\nSauder, that Doris had come to his house on the evening of April 23,\n1996; (2) Lentz stopped his mail delivery beginning the morning of\nApril 24, 1996; (3) Lentz left a voice message with his real estate\nagent on April 22, 1996, asking that the lock box at his house be\nremoved so that he could do some interior painting without being dis-\nturbed by visitors; (4) Lentz’s realtor saw a blue tarp in his foyer on\nthe morning of April 23, 1996; the tarp was gone when the realtor\nreturned on April 28, 1996, but no painting had been done; (5) Doris’s\n\f                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                        51\ncar contained blood stains from Lentz and Doris that were not present\nas of April 22, 1996; (6) over a month after Doris disappeared, her\nmother, Bernice Butt, noticed that Lentz had removed a sofa from his\nliving room. Id. at 14. The majority believes that this circumstantial\nevidence provided \"a logical and supporting evidentiary basis for the\njury to conclude that Doris was ‘held’ by Lentz after she arrived at\nhis house but before the fatal wounds were inflicted.\" Ante at 15. I\nrespectfully disagree.\n\n   As the majority acknowledges, the government did not introduce\nany direct evidence that Doris was held. Ante at 16. Therefore, the\nmajority’s theory is correct only if the six pieces of circumstantial\nevidence listed above allow the reasonable inference that Doris was\nheld. It goes without saying that \"inferences from facts which have\nbeen [proven] by circumstantial evidence may be sufficient to sustain\na verdict of guilt.\" United States v. Thomas, 453 F.2d 141, 143 (9th\nCir. 1971); see also Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319; Stamper v. Muncie, 944\nF.2d 170, 174 (4th Cir. 1991). And we must \"accord[ ] the benefit of\nall reasonable inferences to the government.\" Evans-Smith, 19 F.3d at\n905. However, \"an inference is not reasonable if it is only a guess or\na possibility, for such an inference is not based on the evidence but\nis pure conjecture and speculation.\" Daniels v. Twin Oaks Nursing\nHome, 692 F.2d 1321, 1324 (11th Cir. 1982) (internal quotation\nmarks and citations omitted); see also Galloway v. United States, 319\nU.S. 372, 395 (1943); United States v. Galbraith, 20 F.3d 1054, 1057\n(10th Cir. 1994); Evans-Smith, 19 F.3d at 908 n.22 (\"While all infer-\nences must be made in favor of the prosecution, leaps of logic should\nnot be.\"); Thomas, 453 F.2d at 143.\n\n   When the evidence in this case is reviewed in light of these princi-\nples, it becomes clear that a jury could not rationally infer beyond a\nreasonable doubt that Doris was held for an appreciable period. Draw-\ning such an inference would necessarily require an impermissible\ndegree of speculation and conjecture. At the most, the evidence cited\nby the majority demonstrates that: (1) Lentz devised a scheme to lure\nDoris to travel to his house on April 23, 1996, and he intended to\ncause her harm when she arrived; (2) Lentz took steps to insure that\nnobody would be around when Doris arrived; (3) Doris did arrive at\nLentz’s house on April 23, 1996; (4) after Doris arrived, some harm\nbefell her that led to her death; and (5) Lentz transported Doris’s body\n\f52                      UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\nin her car. Although these permissible findings (almost all requiring\ninferences) strongly suggest that Lentz was involved in Doris’s disap-\npearance and was ultimately responsible for her death, none permit\nthe further inference that Doris was held for an appreciable period of\ntime before her death.\n\n   The majority’s analysis simply assumes a jury could infer that\nDoris was confined and killed in Lentz’s house based on the facts that\nshe arrived at his house, that Lentz did not want people around when\nshe arrived, and that Doris subsequently died. While these facts are\nconsistent with the theory that Doris was confined in Lentz’s house\nprior to her death, that is only one possibility. Lentz could have killed\nDoris in any number of ways that did not involve a holding. For\nexample, Lentz could have taken Doris’s life the moment she walked\ninto his house. Or he could have inflicted a deadly wound from a con-\ncealed position before she had a chance to enter the house. Indeed, it\nmight have been advantageous for Lentz to kill Doris immediately\nupon her arrival in order to minimize the risk that she would put up\na struggle or scream for help. Of course, if Lentz killed Doris as soon\nas she arrived, he did not hold her for the appreciable period neces-\nsary for a federal kidnapping. See Chatwin, 326 U.S. at 460 (conclud-\ning that the holding element \"necessarily implies an unlawful physical\nor mental restraint for an appreciable period\") (emphasis added); see\nalso United States v. Etsitty, 130 F.3d 420, 429 (9th Cir. 1997)\n(Kleinfeld, J., concurring) (\"[I]f [the holding] was not for an apprecia-\nble period, then treating the seizure and confinement of the victim as\nkidnapping would exceed the scope of the statute.\"); United States v.\nHoward, 918 F.2d 1529, 1536 (11th Cir. 1991) (overturning kidnap-\nping conviction when \"[t]here [wa]s no evidence in the record that\nappellants intended to detain [the victim] . . . beyond the few seconds\nit would take to [rob him]\"); Gov’t of Virgin Islands v. Berry, 604\nF.2d 221, 227-28 (3d Cir. 1979) (overturning kidnapping conviction\nwhen \"the degree of confinement to which [the victim] was subjected\nwas no greater than that which is inherent in the commission of\n[assault]\").\n\n   At trial the government tried to downplay the possibility of an\nimmediate killing by saying, \"[t]here’s no evidence of that. There’s\nno evidence that neighbors heard a gunshot. She clearly was inside\nthat house [when she was killed]. . . . This was a quiet crime that no\n\f                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                       53\none heard.\" J.A. 1616. But Lentz did not have to prove that Doris’s\ndeath was immediate; rather it was the government’s burden to prove\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Doris was not killed immediately. All\nof the evidence cited by the majority, including the presence of the\ntarp, Lentz’s plans to keep people away from the house, the blood in\nDoris’s car, and even the missing couch, suggest that Lentz was plan-\nning to, and did in fact, dispose of Doris’s body on the night of April\n23, but this evidence does not show what happened to Doris immedi-\nately before she died. The AUSA unwittingly put his finger on the\nproblem when he said in closing, \"we don’t know exactly what hap-\npened to Doris Lentz when she got to the defendant’s house on April\nthe 23rd. But we know that she ended up dead.\" J.A. 1940. A jury\nmight conclude, based on intuition, that because Doris arrived at\nLentz’s house, she went inside and was held for some amount of time\nbefore being killed. But \"intuition cannot substitute for admissible\nevidence when a defendant is on trial,\" United States v. Hamblin, 911\nF.2d 551, 558 (11th Cir. 1990), and the government failed to produce\nany evidence that demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that Lentz\nheld Doris before she died.\n\n   The majority might have a stronger argument if the evidence\nshowed that Lentz actually brought Doris into his house or that she\nwas murdered inside. Contrary to what the majority says, see ante at\n14, however, the record does not establish that either of these events\noccurred. The majority, for example, relies on testimony indicating\nthat Lentz removed a sofa from his living room at some point. The\nwitness who gave this testimony never said when she had last seen\nthe sofa in Lentz’s house, so the sofa could have been removed before\nDoris disappeared. Even if the sofa was removed after the evening of\nApril 23, 1996, a jury could not reasonably infer from the disappear-\nance of a piece of furniture that Doris entered Lentz’s house, was con-\nfined there, and was then murdered. This inference would be\nparticularly speculative in light of the fact that investigators never\nfound any physical evidence linking Doris to the interior of Lentz’s\nhouse. See Evans-Smith, 19 F.3d at 909-10 n.29 (\"Favoring the prose-\ncution with all inferences does not mean that we must ignore evidence\nthat is in the record, but which they ignore.\").\n\n  The majority also argues that the holding element was satisfied\nbecause the evidence showed that \"[f]rom the moment Doris pulled\n\f54                     UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\nup at Lentz’s home . . . Lentz was then in a position to confine her\nphysically if necessary.\" Ante at 15. To support this argument, the\nmajority cites United States v. Higgs, 353 F.3d 281, 313 (4th Cir.\n2003). The defendant in Higgs tricked three young women into enter-\ning his van by offering them a ride home. The defendant then drove\nto a secluded spot and shot all three. Our court reasoned that the hold-\ning element had been satisfied because once the victims had entered\nthe van, the defendant \"confin[ed] [them] . . . under the pretense of\ntaking them home,\" and he was further \"prepared to confine them at\ngunpoint if necessary.\" Id. at 313. Higgs merely stands for the propo-\nsition that a holding can occur when the perpetrator is confining his\nvictim through deception, while holding force in reserve. The case\ndoes not alter the definition of a holding, which requires an actual\n\"physical or mental restraint for an appreciable period,\" Chatwin, 326\nU.S. at 460, not simply a willingness to restrain should it become nec-\nessary. In this case, as I have pointed out, there is no evidence that\nDoris was confined, by deception or otherwise, after she arrived at\nLentz’s house. Nor is there any evidence that Lentz was in Doris’s\ncompany any longer than was necessary to kill her. Accordingly,\nHiggs does not strengthen the majority’s argument.\n\n   From the very beginning of this case the government has had trou-\nble articulating how a jury could reasonably infer that Lentz held\nDoris for an appreciable period after she arrived at his house but\nbefore she died. The government’s only argument on this score has\nbeen that \"somehow or other [Lentz] detained [Doris at his home] and\nhe killed her. . . . [Lentz] had to hold her to detain her to ultimately\nkill her.\" J.A. 1614-15. However, as our court has said before, \"to\nstart with the assumption that the crime was committed and then to\nshow that each piece of circumstantial evidence can be explained in\na consistent manner is fundamentally different from examining each\npiece of evidence and finally concluding beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat the defendant [is] guilty [of each element of the crime].\" Evans-\nSmith, 19 F.3d at 910. The majority has demonstrated that the evi-\ndence is not inconsistent with the theory that Doris was confined or\nheld before she died. What it has failed to do, however, is explain\nhow each piece of evidence could build to the fair or rational infer-\nence that Lentz held Doris after she arrived at his house but before\nshe was killed. This is not a case in which there is conflicting evi-\ndence on whether a holding occurred. Rather, this is a case in which\n\f                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                      55\nthere is no evidence that tells us what happened as far as the holding\nissue is concerned. See Twin Oaks Nursing Home, 692 F.2d at 1328.\nAnd the mere possibility that Doris was held prior to her death is too\nspeculative to be the basis for a jury verdict of guilt.\n\n   I would affirm the district court’s determination that \"the govern-\nment simply did not provide evidence supporting a finding that Ms.\nLentz was held in connection to her alleged murder.\" J.A. 2384. Doris\nLentz’s disappearance and (almost certain) death present a dreadful\ncase that needs to be solved. The Federal Kidnapping Act does not\noffer a solution, however, because there is no evidence of a holding.\n\f",

LENTZ                         3\nresulting in the death of his ex-wife, Doris Lentz, in violation of the\nFederal Kidnapping Act, 18 U.S.C.A. § 1201(a)(1) (West 2000). In a\nseparate appeal, the United States challenges the district court’s grant\nof a new trial under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33 based\nupon the presence of unadmitted items of evidence in the jury room\nduring deliberations, as well as the district court’s findings that this\nextraneous evidence reached the jury as a result of intentional actions\non the part of Assistant United States Attorney Steven D. Mellin. In\na third appeal, AUSA Mellin challenges the district court’s findings\nregarding his conduct. Lentz has filed a motion to dismiss Mellin’s\nappeal.\n\n   For the following reasons, we reverse the district court’s judgment\nof acquittal, vacate the district court’s factual findings regarding\nintentional conduct on the part of AUSA Mellin, and affirm the dis-\ntrict court’s grant of a new trial. We dismiss the separate appeal of\nAUSA Mellin as moot, deny the motion to dismiss filed by Lentz as\nmoot, and remand the entire case to a new district court judge for fur-\nther proceedings.\n\n                           I. Background\n\n   This case involves the alleged kidnapping of Doris Lentz (\"Doris\")\nby her ex-husband, Jay Lentz (\"Lentz\"), and her resulting death.\nBecause we are evaluating the propriety of the district court’s grant\nof a judgment of acquittal to Lentz, we review the evidence in the\nlight most favorable to the government.\n\n   Lentz and Doris were married in 1989 and had one child, Julia,\nwho was born in 1991. Lentz was verbally and physically abusive to\nDoris during the marriage. Acquaintances of Doris testified that they\nobserved bruises on Doris’s body on at least two separate occasions\nprior to the couple’s separation in 1993. In addition, a Prince\nGeorge’s County police officer testified that he responded to a domes-\ntic violence call on one occasion at the Lentz home and observed\nbruises on Doris’s arms. Doris, in deposition testimony taken during\nthe divorce proceedings, had also testified that Lentz physically\nassaulted her on three occasions during the marriage.\n\n   There was significant testimony that Doris was afraid of Lentz dur-\ning the marriage and that this fear did not subside after their separa-\n\f4                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\ntion. When Doris first decided to leave the marital home, she asked\nher Episcopal priest to be present when she told Lentz of her decision.\nShe eventually moved into an apartment in Arlington, Virginia, that\nprovided security, parked in a controlled-access garage, instructed the\napartment management not to allow Lentz to proceed past the lobby\narea when he came to pick up Julia, and generally made arrangements\nto exchange custody of Julia in public places so as to avoid being\nalone with Lentz. As recently as the spring of 1996, Doris asked a\nfriend from her church to accompany her to the marital home in Fort\nWashington, Maryland, where Lentz had continued to live, to pick up\nJulia because she was afraid to go alone. And a co-worker of Lentz\ntestified that Lentz had told him in 1996 that he had \"kicked in\n[Doris’s] front door\" because she \"had made him mad.\" J.A. 987.\n\n   Although the divorce between the parties became final in 1995, a\nnumber of child support, child support arrearage, and marital property\ndistribution issues continued to be the subject of highly contested and\nbitter litigation in the family court. In particular, the marital home had\nbeen placed on the market for sale and Lentz and Doris frequently\nargued about how the proceeds from the sale should be divided. Doris\nrecorded a number of hostile telephone messages and conversations\nconcerning these ongoing issues that were played for the jury’s con-\nsideration.\n\n   In late March 1996, Lentz’s employer received a child support\norder requiring garnishment of Lentz’s wages. However, Lentz asked\nhis supervisor to postpone processing of the order within the company\nto give him some additional time. Two co-workers of Lentz testified\nthat Lentz told them at about this same time that he would kill Doris\nbefore he let her have custody of their child.\n\n   On Tuesday, April 16, 1996, Doris met Lentz in the lobby of her\napartment building in Arlington, Virginia. Lentz was picking up Julia\nfor a visit with Lentz’s parents in Indiana. Unbeknownst to Lentz,\nDoris had asked her friend, Jennifer Rigger, to follow Doris into the\nlobby and witness Doris’s planned attempt to ask Lentz to sign a doc-\nument pertaining to their ongoing family court litigation. As a result,\nRigger witnessed the exchange of Julia and the ensuing conversation\nconcerning Julia’s date of return. Rigger testified that Lentz initially\nexpressed frustration because Doris had only packed one suitcase\n\f                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                         5\ninstead of the two that Lentz had given them. Rigger also testified that\nLentz told Doris that Julia would return on Tuesday, April 23, exactly\none week later.\n\n   The evidence indicated that Doris initially believed Lentz would\naccompany Julia on the trip, and Julia was below the minimum age\nnecessary to fly unaccompanied. However, airline records revealed\nthat Julia flew unaccompanied to Indiana on April 17, under Lentz’s\nfalse representation that she met the minimum age requirement. The\nround-trip ticket that Lentz had reserved on April 15, had a scheduled\nreturn date of Friday, April 26. On April 16, Lentz changed the return\ndate to Saturday, April 27.\n\n  There was also evidence that Doris initially believed that Lentz\nwould return Julia to her on Wednesday, April 24. At noon on Satur-\nday, April 20, however, Lentz left a message on Doris’s answering\nmachine asking to change the meeting from Wednesday to Tuesday\nevening, April 23, between 7:30 p.m. and 8:00 p.m., and asking that\nDoris confirm that this was acceptable.\n\n   On Tuesday, April 23, at about 4:00 p.m., Lentz left the following\nmessage for Doris: \"Yea Dee, this is, uh, you know, I’m back now\nok. It’s Tuesday afternoon about 4:00 p.m.\" Doris’s mother, boy-\nfriend, aunt, and friend testified that Doris told each of them she was\nto pick up Julia at Lentz’s home on the evening of April 23. Doris’s\nbrown day planner indicated that Lentz and Julia would be returning\non that date.1 In addition, Rigger testified that she and Doris talked\nby telephone after Doris got home that evening and that Doris ended\nthe conversation at approximately 6:50 p.m., telling Rigger that she\nhad to leave to go pick up Julia at Lentz’s home or Lentz would be\nangry.\n\n   There was no eyewitness testimony that Doris arrived at Lentz’s\nhome that evening. Telephone records from April 23 indicate that two\ncalls were placed from Lentz’s mother’s residence in Indiana to\n  1\n   A second black day planner belonging to Doris indicated that Julia\nwould be returning on April 24, which the government argued was also\nconsistent with Lentz’s April 20 telephone message changing the pick-up\nfrom Wednesday to Tuesday.\n\f6                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\nLentz’s house in Maryland between 10:00 and 11:00 that evening, but\nLentz’s mother does not recall speaking to Lentz. A six-minute tele-\nphone call was placed from Lentz’s home to his mother’s home a few\nminutes after 12 a.m. on April 24.\n\n   On April 24, at 8:30 a.m., Doris and Lentz were scheduled to\nappear at a hearing in the family court case. Although scheduled to\nsee Doris two hours later, Lentz left a message on Doris’s answering\nmachine at 6:14 a.m., stating that his mother had rescheduled Julia’s\nflight and that she would be returning on Thursday, April 25, instead\nof Saturday, April 27. Lentz appeared at the 8:30 a.m. hearing with\nhis attorney, but left after a short time. Doris’s attorney also appeared,\nbut Doris did not. Lentz appears to have returned to his home, where\nanother telephone call took place between his home and his mother’s\nhome in Indiana. Lentz’s coworker, Sherrie Roske, testified that Lentz\narrived at work after noon that day, looking disheveled, with bags\nunder his eyes. In the meantime, Lentz’s parents had changed Julia’s\nreturn date from April 27 to April 25 in order to accommodate their\nneed to travel on business elsewhere. At no time, however, was\nJulia’s ticketed return date scheduled for April 23.\n\n   On Thursday, April 25, Doris’s co-worker contacted the Arlington\nCounty Police to inform them that Doris was missing, and it was soon\ndiscovered that the last known plan on Doris’s part was to travel to\nLentz’s home on the evening of April 23 to pick up Julia. During his\ninitial interview with the police, Lentz said that he had last spoken to\nDoris on April 23 between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m., and told her not to come\npick up Julia, a conversation that would have preceded the 6:50 p.m.\ntime that Rigger had said Doris ended their conversation to go to\nLentz’s home. However, just before midnight on April 28, after the\nnews spread that Doris was last heard from around 7:00 p.m. on April\n23, Lentz left a voicemail message with a police investigator stating\nthat he had been mistaken earlier and that he had last spoken to Doris\naround 6:50 p.m. on April 23. In the meantime, Lentz had spoken to\nMarilyn Sauder, a babysitter for Julia, who testified that Lentz said he\ntold Doris that Julia would not be returning on the evening of April\n23 due to a ticketing mix-up and that she should not come to get her\nthat evening, but that Doris had come anyway. There was no evidence\nthat the airlines ever made a ticketing mistake.\n\f                        UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                          7\n   On April 28, 1996, Doris’s car was found in a parking lot in Wash-\nington, D.C., approximately eight miles from Lentz’s home and on a\nroute between Lentz’s home and that of Doris. The witness who\nreported the abandoned car stated that she first noticed it in the park-\ning lot on April 24, the morning after Doris was last heard from by\nanyone, and that the parking lot was a known dumping ground for\nstolen vehicles. When the police arrived to inspect the vehicle, the\ndoors were unlocked and the keys were on the passenger side floor.\nDoris’s purse, complete with wallet, money, checks, and credit cards,\nwas in plain view in the car. The driver’s seat was in the position far-\nthest back from the steering wheel, which would have accommodated\na tall driver such as Lentz, who is 6 feet tall, but not Doris, who was\na little more than five feet tall. The interior of the vehicle and the\ntrunk area were dirty, and there were blood stains on the passenger\nside of the vehicle. There were also two umbrellas in the back seat,\none for an adult and one for a child, and there was evidence that it\nwas raining heavily on the evening of April 23. The floor mats and\nJulia’s booster seat, however, were missing from the car. Two wit-\nnesses who had ridden in Doris’s car the day before her disappearance\ntestified that the interior of the car was completely clean and stain-\nfree and that the booster seat was in the back of the vehicle at that\ntime. They also testified that it was a clear night and there were no\numbrellas in the car.\n\n   Shortly after the car was discovered, blood stains found in the inte-\nrior were tested at the Virginia Forensic Laboratory and confirmed to\nmatch that of Doris. After Lentz was indicted in November 2001, the\ngovernment sent the blood-stained passenger seat to the Virginia\nForensic Laboratory for further DNA analysis, along with a DNA\nsample from Lentz. According to Robert Scanlon, the forensic scien-\ntist who completed the testing, all of the bloodstains contained\nDoris’s DNA, with the exception of one 3/4 inch stain found on the\ncenter of the passenger seat of Doris’s car. Scanlon testified that this\nsample contained Lentz’s DNA.2 In addition, Scanlon testified that\n  2\n   To refute this evidence, the defense presented the testimony of two\nexperts who examined the seat after this testing was completed and testi-\nfied that they found no evidence of the blood spot. The defense argued\nthat the sample did not exist and, even if it did, that Scanlon had either\ncontaminated the test or that Lentz’s DNA was present as a result of\n\"secondary transfer,\" i.e., a transfer of DNA by the child.\n\f8                      UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\nLentz could not be eliminated as a possible donor of a sample taken\nfrom the recline lever of the passenger seat. Witnesses testified that\nDoris purchased her vehicle after she and Lentz separated, that he had\nnot had access to her car, and that Doris was too afraid of Lentz to\nhave ever let him in the car with her.\n\n   It was also discovered that Lentz had left a message with his real\nestate agent, Diane Ives, on April 22, asking her to remove the lock-\nbox from his home because he wanted to do some interior painting.\nIves testified that when she arrived at the home on April 23, she\nentered the home and noticed a large blue tarp in the foyer but no\npainting supplies. She removed the lockbox and left. Lentz also\nrequested that his mail delivery be stopped indefinitely, effective\nApril 24. On Saturday, April 27, Ives replaced the lockbox, but Lentz\ncalled her and demanded that she remove it again. When she returned\nto the home, Ives noticed that the blue tarp was gone, but no interior\npainting had been done, and that a small square on the floor of the\ncarport had been freshly painted a gray color. On Monday, April 29,\nIves returned to the house and noticed that the painted area in the car-\nport had more than doubled in size. By May 10, the entire back third\nof the driveway had been painted gray. The interior was never\npainted. In addition, two police officers driving by the residence\nobserved Lentz, within several days of the disappearance, washing the\nfloor of the carport with a garden hose. Doris’s mother testified that,\nduring a visit to the home to see Julia in June 1996, she noticed that\nthe carpeting had been replaced or very well-cleaned, the living room\nsofa was missing, and a matching chair had been moved to where the\nsofa had been previously placed. Within a few months of Doris’s dis-\nappearance, Lentz obtained a court order, retroactive to April 23, sus-\npending his child support payments and the garnishment order. Lentz\nsold the marital home in late 1996 and moved with Julia to Indiana.\n\n   Because Doris’s body was never found, the Arlington County\ninvestigation into her disappearance and presumed murder ultimately\nstalled. The federal investigation continued. On April 24, 2001, a fed-\neral grand jury returned an indictment against Lentz, charging kidnap-\nping resulting in death in violation of the Federal Kidnapping Act, 18\nU.S.C.A. § 1201(a). In July 2003, a jury found Lentz guilty of the\nkidnapping charge and returned a unanimous verdict of life imprison-\nment. Shortly thereafter, the district court granted Lentz’s motion for\n\f                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                         9\njudgment of acquittal, see United States v.

The Federal Kidnapping Act\n\n   Adopted in 1932, the Federal Kidnapping Act (the \"Act\") was pri-\nmarily designed \"to assist the states in stamping out [the] growing and\nsinister menace of kidnapping\" where perpetrators transported their\nvictims across state lines in order to frustrate state authorities con-\nfined in their investigations by jurisdictional boundaries.

Jurisdiction\n\n   There is no dispute that the government presented sufficient evi-\ndence to establish the jurisdictional component that Doris was \"will-\nfully transported in interstate . . . commerce.\" 18 U.S.C.A.\n§ 1201(a)(1). There is no statutory requirement that a kidnapper \"ac-\ncompany, physically transport, or provide for the physical transporta-\ntion of the victim\" in order to satisfy the \"willfully transported\"\nelement of section 1201(a)(1).

Rather, it is\nenough to show that the kidnapper \"willfully caused unaccompanied\ntravel over state lines.\" Id. at 179.\n\n   In Wills I, the defendant left a flyer at the victim’s residence in Vir-\nginia advertising a job opportunity. The victim — who had identified\nthe defendant as the person who had previously burglarized his home\n— contacted the defendant at the District of Columbia cellular tele-\nphone number provided and arrangements were made for the victim\nto travel to Union Station for a job interview. The victim’s abandoned\ncar was found the following day and he was never heard from again.\nThus, the evidence supported the conclusion that the defendant had\nlured the victim into traveling unaccompanied from his home in Vir-\n\f                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                        11\nginia to Washington, D.C., by promising a job interview in order to\neliminate the victim as an eyewitness to the burglary charged against\nhim. Because the victim crossed state lines unaccompanied by the\ndefendant, the district court dismissed the kidnapping charge on the\nground that it failed to satisfy the Act’s jurisdictional component of\ninterstate transportation.\n\n   On appeal from the dismissal of the charge, we held that jurisdic-\ntion exists for purposes of the Act \"when a victim, acting because of\nfalse pretenses initiated at the instance of the defendant, transports\nhimself across state lines without accompaniment by the alleged per-\npetrator or an accomplice.\" Id. at 176. We explained that\n\n    [t]he plain language of the Act does not require that the\n    defendant accompany, physically transport, or provide for\n    the physical transportation of the victim. Rather, the Act\n    only requires that the victim \"is willfully transported.\" If\n    Congress wished to make accompaniment by the defendant\n    over state lines a requirement under the Act, it could easily\n    have written the Act to provide for it.\n\nId. at 178.\n\n   Here, the jury reasonably concluded that Lentz, by telling Doris\nthat Julia had returned from Indiana and arranging for Doris to pick\nher up from his home on April 23, willfully caused Doris to be trans-\nported across state lines from her home in Virginia to his home in\nMaryland, thereby satisfying the jurisdictional component of the Act.\n\n                   C. The Substantive Elements\n\n   The substantive requirements of the statute are that the government\nprove (1) that Lentz unlawfully seized, confined, inveigled, decoyed,\nkidnapped, abducted, or carried away Doris; (2) that Lentz held her\n\"for ransom or reward or otherwise;\" and (3) that Doris’s death\nresulted from those actions. 18 U.S.C.A. § 1201(a). It is this \"involun-\ntariness of seizure and detention which is the very essence of the\ncrime of kidnaping.\" Chatwin, 326 U.S. at 464; see United States v.\nYoung, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"326060\"><a href=\"/opinion/326060/united-states-v-tyrone-rogers-young-united-states-of-america-v-wayne/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 323 (4th Cir. 1975) (noting that \"the true ele-\n\f12                     UNITED STATES v.

Lentz does not contend otherwise, and also concedes\nthat the evidence was sufficient to support the conclusion that Doris\nis deceased. Rather, Lentz’s challenge to his kidnapping conviction is\nnarrowly centered upon the claim that there was insufficient evidence\nfrom which the jury could reasonably have concluded that Doris was\nheld or otherwise restrained by Lentz \"for ransom or reward or other-\nwise.\" 18 U.S.C.A. § 1201(a).

The victim was not \"deprived of her liberty, compelled\nto remain where she did not wish to remain, or compelled to go where\nshe did not wish to go.\" Chatwin, 326 U.S. at 460.

On the contrary,\n\"she was perfectly free to leave the [defendants] when and if she so\ndesired.\" Id.\n\n   Lentz claims that the evidence in this case was similarly insuffi-\ncient to prove that Lentz imposed \"an unlawful physical or mental\nrestraint for an appreciable period against [Doris’s] will.\" Id. Specifi-\ncally, Lentz argues that, although his inveiglement of Doris and her\nunaccompanied travel from Virginia to Maryland caused by it satis-\nfies the jurisdictional and seizure components of the statute, it cannot\nalso serve to establish the \"holding\" element because there was no\nevidence that Lentz exerted any physical or mental force sufficient to\neffect a restraint upon her movements during the trip. In other words,\nLentz argues that Doris was at all times \"perfectly free\" to return to\nher home or otherwise decide not to complete the journey to pick up\nJulia at his home. Lentz also argues that Doris’s murder upon her\narrival at his home (assuming the jury found that this to be supported\nby the evidence), cannot suffice because a \"holding\" under the kid-\nnapping statute requires a restraint of the victim beyond that required\nto accomplish the murder and there is no evidence that Doris was sub-\njected to any physical restraint beyond that necessary to simply kill\nher upon her arrival.\n\n   The government argues to the contrary, contending that Doris was\n\"held\" for purposes of the Act in two distinct ways: (1) by deception\nfrom the time she was inveigled or deceived into traveling from Vir-\nginia to Maryland through the time that she came into Lentz’s pres-\nence; and, (2) thereafter through physical force or fear up to and\nduring her murder. As explained below, viewing the evidence in the\nlight most favorable to the government and drawing all reasonable\ninferences in its favor, we are satisfied that the evidence, though cir-\ncumstantial, was sufficient to support the jury’s determination that,\nupon Doris’s arrival at Lentz’s home, Lentz exerted an unlawful\nphysical or mental restraint for an appreciable period against Doris’s\nwill.\n\n                                   2.\n\n   At the conclusion of the evidence in this case, the district court\ninstructed the jury that the government was required to prove (1) that\n\f14                      UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\nLentz knowingly and willfully inveigled or decoyed Doris, (2) that\nDoris was held for ransom, reward, or some other benefit that Lentz\nintended to derive by so holding Doris, (3) that Lentz willfully trans-\nported or caused the transportation of Doris in interstate commerce,\nand (4) that Lentz’s actions resulted in Doris’s death. The court\ninstructed the jury that \"[t]o inveigle or decoy a person means to lure\nor entice or lead a person astray by false representations or promises\nor other deceitful means\" and that \"[t]o hold means to detain, seize\nor confine a person in some manner against that person’s will.\" J.A.\n1922. In addition, the jury was instructed as follows:\n\n       [T]he government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt\n     that the defendant held his victim for some benefit and that\n     the defendant willfully transported the victim in interstate\n     commerce.\n\n       It is not necessary that the government prove that the\n     holding occurred prior to the transportation in interstate\n     commerce.\n\n       However, the holding must be separate from . . . the trans-\n     portation.\n\nJ.A. 1924. Later, the jury was informed, in response to its question,\nthat \"the defendant himself [would] have to do the actual detain-\ning/holding\" of the victim. J.A. 2059A.\n\n   With regard to the evidence of \"holding,\" the government produced\ntestimony from the child’s babysitter that Lentz admitted Doris had\ncome to his house on the evening of April 23. Additionally, the gov-\nernment’s evidence showed that Lentz stopped his mailman from\ncoming to the house and that the realtor’s lockbox was removed to\nkeep unexpected and unwanted visitors from entering the house; that\na blue tarp was present in the foyer of the home on the morning of\nApril 23, but with a false pretense by Lentz as to its purpose; that both\nDoris’s blood and Lentz’s blood were found later in her car, which\nwitnesses testified was clean and stain-free the evening before and\nwhich witnesses testified Doris would never voluntarily have allowed\nLentz to enter; and that the sofa had been removed from the home and\nreplaced with its matching chair, all of which taken together provides\n\f                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                        15\ncircumstantial evidence that Doris was brought into Lentz’s home\nupon her arrival and murdered there.\n\n   The evidence also sufficiently supported the conclusion that, once\nDoris arrived at Lentz’s home, Lentz was in the position of employing\nfurther means, be it deceit or force, necessary to bring Doris inside\nthe home where he could physically confine her and kill her. From the\nmoment Doris pulled up at Lentz’s home, she was in his company and\nno longer \"perfectly free to leave.\" Chatwin, 326 U.S. at 460. Rather,\nLentz was then in a position to confine her physically if necessary.\nSee Higgs, 353 F.3d at 313 (rejecting challenge to the \"holding\" ele-\nment where the evidence supported the conclusion that the kidnapper\n\"was prepared to confine [his inveigled victims] at gunpoint if neces-\nsary\"); cf.

Boone, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580342\"><a href=\"/opinion/580342/united-states-v-samuel-randolph-boone/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1550</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1555 n.5 (11th Cir.\n1992) (noting that \"[i]nveiglement becomes an unlawful form of kid-\nnapping under the statute when the alleged kidnapper interferes with\nhis victim’s actions, exercising control over his victim through the\nwillingness to use forcible action should his deception fail\"). Beyond\nthis, there was also sufficient evidence to support the jury’s conclu-\nsion that, once Lentz had lured or forced Doris into his home, he con-\ntinued to hold her and kill her, wrapped her body in the blue tarp,\ndrove her car into the carport, moved her bleeding body out to the car-\nport and into the front passenger seat of the car, disposed of the body,\nand abandoned her car in a high-crime neighborhood in Washington,\nD.C., with keys and wallet in plain view, no doubt hoping that some-\none would steal the car and be caught in it along with Doris’s wallet\nand credit cards.\n\n   It is against this backdrop of evidence that we must determine\nwhether there was a logical and supporting evidentiary basis for the\njury to conclude that Doris was \"held\" by Lentz after she arrived at\nhis house but before the fatal wounds were inflicted. We believe there\nwas. Given the evidence that Doris was extremely fearful of being\nalone with Lentz out of the public eye and given the evidence that\nDoris was inside the house when she was killed, the jury could rea-\nsonably conclude from circumstantial evidence that after her arrival\nat the house Lentz either physically forced or lured her inside or oth-\nerwise confined her against her will for an appreciable period of time\nin order to accomplish the purpose of the seizure — her murder and\nits accompanying benefit to him in the domestic litigation. The\n\f16                      UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\ndefense argues correctly that there is no direct evidence as to exactly\nwhat events occurred in the house preceding Doris’s murder. How-\never, the government’s inability to produce direct evidence on this\nissue is not fatal to its case, because we believe the circumstantial evi-\ndence in the case supports the jury’s finding that Lentz himself\naccomplished \"the actual detaining/holding\" of the victim against her\nwill, separate and apart from her trip to the house. J.A. 2059A.\n\n   To conclude, the evidence was sufficient for the properly instructed\njury to convict Lentz of kidnapping resulting in murder. In applying\nthe instructions given, a reasonable juror could readily have con-\ncluded from the evidence that Lentz, after inveigling Doris into trav-\neling across state lines to his home, employed \"unlawful physical or\nmental restraint for an appreciable period against [Doris’s] will and\nwith a willful intent so to confine [her]\" inside his home. Chatwin,\n326 U.S. at 460. Once Doris arrived at Lentz’s home, Lentz had suc-\ncessfully transported Doris across state lines by his deception and was\nin the position to complete his plan to confine and kill Doris in private\nto eliminate any requirement that he split their marital assets, and\neliminate any further liability on his part for child support payments.\nSee United States v.

Lentz’s plan\nwas to cause Doris, through his deceit, to travel beyond the borders\nof her home state into his home state and then to involve yet another\njurisdiction in the investigation by dumping Doris’s blood-stained\nvehicle and personal effects in the District of Columbia. Cf. Hughes,\n716 F.2d at 239 (\"The policy justification for the original federal kid-\nnapping statute was to provide federal officials the ‘power to disre-\ngard [state] barriers in pursuing’ kidnappers who planned their\nactivities to take the best possible advantage of the limited authority\nand coordination of state law enforcement agencies.\") (quoting Chat-\n\f                        UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                        17\nwin, 326 U.S. at 463). According to representations made by the gov-\nernment, the federal investigation and prosecution proceeded\nprecisely because jurisdictional boundaries stifling the state prosecu-\ntions had come into play and the circuit case law interpreting the Act,\nspecifically the Wills I case, had opened up the prospect of the federal\ncharge. See Lentz, 275 F. Supp. 2d at 748, n. 29 (\"They couldn’t\ncharge a homicide in Prince George’s County,\" where Lentz resided,\nand \"[t]hey couldn’t charge anything in Arlington. All you ha[d] in\nArlington [was] someone being told to come over and get the child.\nThat’s no charge.\"). According to the district court, \"[u]nlike the clas-\nsic tragic kidnapping case, . . . this case suggests a mysterious intra-\nstate disappearance of Ms. Lentz under suspicious circumstances.\" Id.\nat 748 (emphasis added). On the contrary, the evidence in this case\nsupports the jury’s finding that Doris was held and killed after Lentz\ntricked her into traveling interstate for the purpose of avoiding further\ndomestic litigation and liabilities on his part.\n\n   For similar reasons, we reject Lentz’s suggestion that the evidence\nin this case cannot suffice to establish a \"holding\" of Doris under the\nAct because it demonstrates no more than a holding incident to her\nmurder.

The \"holding\" or \"deten-\n\f18                      UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\ntion\" element is separate and distinct from the \"kidnapping\" or \"sei-\nzure\" element, but they should not be viewed in a vacuum. In this\ncase, there was evidence that Doris was seized by inveiglement, trans-\nported across state lines by virtue of that inveiglement, and held by\nLentz for the purpose of killing her and eliminating the pending cus-\ntody, support, and marital asset issues. Far from a routine state murder\ncase, it is this type of seizure, interstate transportation, and holding\nthat the Act, as amended, was intended to reach. Cf. Wills II, 346 F.3d\nat 493 (\"‘Nothing in the policy [disregard of State borders in pursuit]\njustifies rewarding the kidnapper simply because he is ingenious\nenough to conceal his true motive, until he is able to transport . . .

Appeal No. 04-7\n\n   We turn now to the government’s appeal of the district court’s\ndecision granting Lentz a new trial based upon the presence of extra-\nneous items of evidence in the jury room during deliberations and the\ncourt’s accompanying findings that the extraneous evidence reached\nthe jury as a result of intentional misconduct on the part of AUSA\nMellin.\n\n                            A. Background\n\n   Shortly after the jury returned the kidnapping conviction, three\njurors contacted defense counsel and informed them that a brown\nleather Day Planner (the \"brown day planner\") and a black Wisconsin\nParalyzed Veterans of America pocket-sized calender (the \"black day\nplanner\") belonging to Doris had been present in the jury room during\ndeliberations. Among other things, the planners contained Doris’s\n  3\n   Because there was sufficient evidence supporting the jury’s determi-\nnation that Doris was held upon her arrival at Lentz’s home, it is unnec-\nessary for us to address the government’s position that Doris was held\nby deception during her unaccompanied journey from Virginia to Mary-\nland.\n\f                        UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                        19\nnotes concerning Lentz’s harassing and threatening behavior towards\nDoris and Julia’s day care provider; notes concerning Doris’s efforts\nto obtain a protective order; names and telephone numbers of police\nofficers and a domestic violence support group; and notes summariz-\ning derogatory statements about Doris made by Lentz to Julia. The\nblack day planner was not marked as an exhibit, but Lentz had offered\ntwo photocopied pages from it into evidence during the cross-\nexamination of Doris’s friend, Jennifer Rigger. These pages indicated\nthat Doris had expected Julia to return from her Indiana trip on April\n24, 1996, which contradicted Rigger’s testimony that Doris told her\nthat she was picking up Julia at Lentz’s home on the evening of April\n23, 1996. The brown day planner was pre-marked Exhibit 548 by the\ngovernment, but the government only submitted two photocopied\npages from it into evidence during its re-direct examination of Rigger.\nThese pages corroborated Rigger’s testimony that Doris had expected\nJulia to return from her Indiana trip on April 23, 1996.4\n\n   On July 25, 2003, Lentz moved to vacate the jury’s verdict, assert-\ning that he had been prejudiced by the presence of the day planners\nin the jury room during deliberations. In addition, Lentz asked the dis-\ntrict court to \"hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the\nfacts surrounding the inadmissible materials making their way to the\njury dictate that a retrial should be barred\" under Oregon v. Kennedy,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110714\"><a href=\"/opinion/110714/oregon-v-kennedy/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">667</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 674-75 (1982). J.A. 3322; see Kennedy, 456 U.S. at\n675-76 (holding that \"[p]rosecutorial conduct that might be viewed as\nharassment or overreaching, even if sufficient to justify a mistrial on\ndefendant’s motion, . . . does not bar retrial absent intent on the part\nof the prosecutor to subvert the protections afforded by the Double\nJeopardy Clause\").\n\n   At the conclusion of a motions hearing on August 14, 2003, the\ndistrict court deferred ruling on Lentz’s motion to set aside the jury\nverdict based upon the alleged prejudicial effect of the day planners\n  4\n    During closing arguments, the government argued that the April 24\nentry in the black day planner was consistent with the message that Lentz\nleft on Doris’s answering machine requesting that they \"move the pick\nup\" of Julia from Wednesday, April 24, to Tuesday evening, April 23,\nand that, in any event, the black day planner entry was inconsistent with\nJulia’s return flight, which Lentz never scheduled for either date.\n\f20                     UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\nand granted Lentz’s request for an evidentiary hearing. United States\nAttorney Paul McNulty and Federal Public Defender Frank Dunham\nwere instructed to conduct an inquiry within their respective offices\n\"to ascertain what the facts are concerning the handling of these docu-\nments,\" J.A. 3561, and to select counsel to present the testimony of\nthe trial attorneys and others who handled the exhibits. The district\ncourt indicated that each person who handled the exhibits would be\ngiven an opportunity to testify, along with the district court’s own\nstaff who were involved in the gathering of exhibits for submission\nto the jury.5\n\n   On November 4 and 5, 2003, the district court held the evidentiary\nhearing into the question of whether there had been intentional mis-\nconduct and heard arguments from counsel on whether the jury’s con-\nsideration of the unadmitted evidence was sufficiently prejudicial to\nwarrant the grant of a mistrial or new trial under Rule 33. Three\njurors, the court’s security officer, the court’s deputy clerk, three\ndefense attorneys, two prosecutors, two government support staffers,\nan FBI Agent and an Arlington County Police Officer testified at the\nhearing.\n\n   On January 29, 2004, the district court issued a memorandum opin-\nion summarizing the testimony and finding that the two day planners\nhad been excluded from evidence but were nonetheless \"intentionally\nsubmitted to the jury by the Government.\" J.A. 2834. The district\ncourt placed the blame exclusively upon AUSA Mellin. Among other\ncharges, the district court found that Mellin placed the two day plan-\nners with the evidence after counsel and the court clerk sorted the evi-\ndence for the jury, and that he did so with the \"intent to act outside\nthe Orders of th[e] Court and the confines of the law.\" J.A. 2869. The\ncourt further concluded that Mellin’s \"actions with the day planners\nsuggest that this conduct was not a benign act or negligent error,\" but\nrather a \"reckless\" and \"intentional\" act on his part. J.A. 2869.\n  5\n    The government thereafter sought a writ of mandamus from this court\nseeking recusal of the district judge from conducting the hearing into\nhow the evidence found its way into the jury room because the hearing\nwould necessarily require the judge to weigh the credibility of the gov-\nernment representatives against his long-time court personnel. We sum-\nmarily denied the writ. See In re United States of America, No. 03-21\n(4th Cir., Oct. 3, 2003).\n\f                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                        21\n   In the order, the district court also found that the \"submission [of\nthe evidence] was not benign because it violated [Lentz’s] Sixth\nAmendment right to confrontation and prevented him from receiving\na fair trial,\" and that the government had \"fail[ed] to meet its burden\nto prove that the submission was harmless because the evidence bol-\nstered the [g]overnment’s arguments and completely destroyed\n[Lentz’s] credibility and, therefore, his case.\" J.A. 2834. Despite the\ndistrict court’s findings of intentional misconduct, however, the dis-\ntrict court made no ruling pertaining to Lentz’s contention that a\nretrial should be barred under the double jeopardy clause. Instead, the\ndistrict court granted a new trial in the event this court reversed the\nearlier judgment of acquittal. On February 13, 2004, the government\nfiled a notice of appeal from the district court’s order. We first\naddress the evidence and findings regarding intentional misconduct\non the part of Mellin and then review the district court’s determina-\ntion that the jury’s verdict should be set aside based upon the prejudi-\ncial effect of the extraneous evidence.\n\n                B. Intentional Misconduct Findings\n\n   The following facts, gleaned from the evidentiary hearing con-\nducted by the district court, appear to be undisputed. On the afternoon\nof June 16, 2002, the jury received its instructions and the parties\ncompleted their closing arguments in the guilt phase of Lentz’s trial.\nThe jury was then instructed to return at 10:00 the following morning\nto begin deliberations. At approximately 9:30 the next morning, the\ndefense team (Michael Lieberman, Frank Salvato, and Judy Clark)\nand the prosecution team (AUSA Steven Mellin, AUSA Patricia\nHaynes, and Michael Chellis) met with courtroom deputy clerk\nJoanna Solomon and court security officer William Scruggs in the\ncourtroom to assemble the admitted trial exhibits and prepare them\nfor transport into the jury room. Also present and assisting in the\nendeavor at various times were FBI Special Agent Brad Garrett,\nArlington County Sergeant John Coale, Information Technologist\nTyrone Bowie, and an intern with defense counsel Salvato’s office.\nAfter Solomon sorted and reviewed the exhibits with counsel for both\nsides, the items were turned over to Scruggs to be loaded onto an evi-\ndence cart and transported into the jury room. According to the jurors,\nat some point after they began their deliberations, the black and\nbrown day planners were noticed and reviewed in the jury room,\n\f22                     UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\nalthough the earliest any juror recalled seeing the day planners was\non the second day of deliberations.\n\n   By all accounts, the process of sorting and loading the evidence\ntook place among four counsel tables for a period of at least 45 min-\nutes and involved up to twelve people (not counting any persons mill-\ning about behind the bar or unnoticed in the well). The precise events\noccurring during this time period and, in particular, the method by\nwhich the two day planners found their way into the jury room, how-\never, have been the subject of much uncertainty and confusion.\n\n   Solomon, the courtroom deputy clerk, testified that she began her\ntask by checking her exhibit list with counsel for both sides and that\nthe sorting of unadmitted evidence from admitted evidence took place\nprimarily at the back counsel table used by the government. Accord-\ning to Solomon’s list, four pages from the brown day planner and two\npages from the black day planner had been admitted into evidence,\nand it appears that these excerpts were marked as exhibits, placed\nwith the admitted evidence, and taken to the jury. Solomon testified\nthat when sorting the evidence, she \"endeavored to look at everything\non the [back] table\" and that \"everything on the back table [was to]\nbe put on the cart to go to the jury.\" J.A. 2430. She then turned the\nevidence over to Scruggs for loading onto the cart. She testified that\nshe did not see either the brown day planner or the black day planner\nduring the process.\n\n   According to Scruggs, after the evidence was turned over to him\nby Solomon, his \"understanding was that only items that were sitting\non the back table on the right hand side . . . [were] approved to go\nback to the jury.\" J.A. 2439. Scruggs testified that he was responsible\nfor loading the cart, but that the cart was actually loaded by \"a combi-\nnation of people\" helping him. J.A. 2440. Specifically, he testified\nthat Chellis, Agent Garrett, and Sergeant Coale all offered to assist\nhim. Scruggs testified that he saw the brown day planner on the back\ntable with the evidence for the jury at the time the cart was loaded and\nthat he later saw the black day planner with the evidence when he\nretrieved it from the jury room. In an earlier affidavit, however,\nScruggs stated that he had seen both the black and brown day plan-\nners \"[s]itting on the rear table with the items of physical evidence.\"\nJ.A. 3525. According to Scruggs’s affidavit:\n\f                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                        23\n    I was in court on August 14, 2003, when Judge Lee deter-\n    mined that these same two diaries that I had seen on the rear\n    table with the other items of physical evidence, had gone to\n    the jury. The books Judge Lee held up in open court on that\n    occasion appeared to be the same two books I saw on the\n    prosecution’s rear table.\n\n    As I loaded the notebooks on the front table onto the cart,\n    [Garrett, Coale, and Chellis] offered to assist me by loading\n    the items from the rear table onto the cart. At that time, the\n    two diaries were included along with the other items loaded\n    onto the cart. I cannot say which of the three gentlemen\n    actually placed the diaries on the cart or where on the cart\n    they were actually placed . . ., but I do remember that they\n    were on the cart.\n\nJ.A. 3525-26. Scruggs testified at the hearing that \"[n]o one got near\nthe cart once it was loaded.\" J.A. 2459. In sum, Scruggs testified that\n\"when Judge Lee held up the [day planners] in open court and said\n. . . the issue was how did they get back to the jury,\" he \"knew right\nthen how they had gotten back to the jury\" — they were present on\nthe back prosecution table and were loaded along with the items of\nadmitted evidence onto the cart that day. J.A. 2461. Scruggs could not\nstate who placed the day planners with the evidence or which helper\nloaded the day planners onto the evidence cart, but made no mention\nof Mellin’s presence in the area at the time or any assistance offered\nby him.\n\n   Defense counsel Lieberman, Salvato, and Clark testified that they\nwere also present when the exhibits were assembled for the jury, but\ndid not observe anyone placing the day planners with the admitted\nevidence or on the evidence cart. According to defense counsel, at\none point very early in the process, Mellin sought approval to remove\nthe contents of the brown day planner from its leather cover and to\nsubmit the cover with the admitted excerpts from it, but no one\nchecked to see if this was done. According to Clark, after the exhibits\nwere loaded on the cart, \"somebody said, well, who wants to inspect\nthe cart now\" and Lieberman walked over to the cart, looked it over,\nand moved some boxes around. J.A. 2471. Lieberman confirmed that\nhe did so, but he did not individually examine every item and he did\n\f24                      UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\nnot recall seeing either day planner on the cart. This testimony\nappears to be inconsistent with Scruggs’s testimony that \"[n]o one got\nnear the cart once it was loaded.\" J.A. 2459.\n\n   Michael Chellis, an attorney employed by the U.S. Attorney’s\noffice, testified that he was charged with the primary responsibility\nfor sorting the government’s exhibits after the trial. Chellis testified\nthat he met with Solomon to review the Clerk’s exhibit list. He testi-\nfied that Solomon told counsel for both sides that the few items not\nlisted as admitted could be admitted if both sides agreed. In particular,\nChellis recalled that the blood evidence was not listed as admitted, but\nthat the parties agreed that it should be loaded on the cart and taken\nto the jury anyway. Haynes also testified about a similar conversation\nbetween counsel and Solomon. Chellis testified that he had placed the\nblack day planner on Mellin’s office chair a few days before closing\nand that he later saw it on the government’s counsel table in the court-\nroom. Chellis admitted that he personally placed the brown day plan-\nner on the back counsel table, which is consistent with Scruggs’s\ntestimony, but that he did not intend to place it with the admitted\nitems of evidence.\n\n   After Chellis testified, Solomon was recalled by the government.\nSolomon initially denied having ever told either side that evidence\nthat was intended to be, but inadvertently not, admitted during the\ntrial could be admitted and sent to the jury by agreement. After\nretrieving her exhibit list, however, Solomon acknowledged that her\nlist did not have the blood evidence as being used or admitted and did\nnot have the car seat evidence as being admitted. These exhibits were\nloaded onto the cart and taken to the jury, and it appears that the par-\nties agreed that these exhibits should have been shown as having been\nused and admitted during the trial. According to Solomon, there was\nanother list that she believed she must have inadvertently discarded,\n\"thinking [she] had everything transferred to one\" list. J.A. 2716.6\n   6\n     The record is unclear as to when this error on the court clerk’s part\ntook place. Solomon testified on redirect examination that she had both\nlists when she checked the defense and government exhibits. However,\nChellis’s testimony, Haynes’s testimony, and other portions of Solo-\nmon’s testimony indicate that the error occurred prior to the sorting of\nthe exhibits and Judge Lee’s order seems to interpret the testimony on\nthis issue in the latter fashion.\n\f                        UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                        25\nThere was also undisputed evidence that, after the jury deliberations\nhad concluded, Solomon had mistakenly returned a borrowed CD\nplayer to the AUSA’s office with an original CD exhibit in it.\n\n   For his part, AUSA Mellin testified that he last remembered seeing\nthe brown day planner during closing arguments the night before the\nevidence was submitted to the jury. He testified that he arrived at the\ncourtroom with AUSA Haynes the next morning and had a conversa-\ntion with defense counsel about the brown day planner early during\nthe process of sorting the evidence. He did not recall, however, asking\nto insert the photocopied pages in the brown leather binder in lieu of\nits entire contents or having it in his hand at the time of the conversa-\ntion. With regard to the black day planner, Mellin also did not exclude\nthe possibility that it was in the courtroom that morning, although he\ntestified that he was not aware of it being there and last remembers\nspecifically seeing it several days before closing arguments.\n\n   Based upon the testimony and evidence presented, the district court\nmade a number of findings and conclusions regarding the \"responsi-\nbility\" of the people involved in the trial process for the extraneous\nevidence reaching the jury. The district court attributed no responsi-\nbility to the court clerk or court security officer and no responsibility\nto any member of the defense team. Rather, the district court attri-\nbuted sole responsibility for the erroneous submission to Mellin and\nfound that the submission was the result of intentional misconduct on\nhis part. Specifically, the court found that \"Mellin [personally] placed\nthe two day planners with the evidence for the jury,\" and that \"[h]e\ndid this after the lawyers and court clerk had prepared all of the\nadmitted evidence for the jury.\" J.A. 2867. According to the district\ncourt’s view of the evidence,\n\n    after all of the lawyers and the courtroom clerk completed\n    their review of the evidence, Mr. Mellin placed the unadmit-\n    ted day planners in the evidence box. The unmarked black\n    day planner, inadmissible evidence, did not emerge from the\n    clear blue sky, and land in the jury room. Mr. Mellin had the\n    black day planner last and was well aware it was inadmissi-\n    ble. Similarly, Mr. Mellin’s submission of the whole brown\n    day planner to the jury was an intentional act. Mr. Mellin,\n    after discussing whether he could send the brown day plan-\n\f26                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\n     ner to the jury with defense counsel and acknowledging the\n     Court’s order excluding the whole day planner, inserted the\n     brown day planner in the evidence box as evidence for the\n     jury. . . .\n\n        The Court concludes that Mr. Mellin’s testimony indi-\n     cates much more than a lack of credibility; rather his testi-\n     mony demonstrates his intent to act outside the Orders of\n     this Court and the confines of the law. In sum, the Court\n     finds that Mr. Mellin’s actions with the day planners suggest\n     that this conduct was not a benign act or negligent error.\n     Rather this action was reckless, and it was intentional.\n\nJ.A. 2868-69.\n\n                        1. Standard of Review\n\n   We review for clear error the district court’s factual findings that\nAUSA Mellin intentionally placed the day planners with the evidence\nfor the jury. See United States v.

None of the witnesses observed Mellin or anyone\n\f                         UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                          27\nelse placing the day planners with the admitted evidence being taken\nto the jury. Nor did any of the witnesses profess knowledge of any\nevidence that Mellin or anyone else intentionally slipped the day plan-\nners to the jury in order to gain some advantage in the trial. Rather,\nthe district court’s factual finding of misconduct is based solely upon\nits belief that both day planners had been excluded in a pretrial ruling,\nthat the brown day planner had again been excluded at trial, that Mel-\nlin’s responses concerning the whereabouts of the day planners on the\nday the evidence was sorted were unconvincing, and that Mellin’s\ndemeanor generally indicated that he was not credible on the issue.\nHaving thoroughly reviewed the transcript from the trial and the evi-\ndentiary hearing, we are convinced that the district court’s finding of\nintentional misconduct rests upon several clearly erroneous underly-\ning factual findings.\n\n             2. The District Court’s Evidentiary Rulings\n\n   At the outset of the findings of fact, the district judge stated that\n\"[t]he trial judge’s responsibility is to rule on the admission or exclu-\nsion of evidence\" and to \"rule clearly so that the parties are aware of\nwhat evidence conforms to the law.\" J.A. 2857. However, the district\njudge erroneously found that, as a result of a pretrial motion in limine\nfiled by the government, he had \"issued a seventy-six page definitive\nopinion where [he had] excluded Doris Lentz’s day planners,\" J.A.\n2857-58, that he had denied a subsequent motion to reconsider this\nruling, and that he had again ruled the brown day planner inadmissi-\nble during trial. It is apparent that this erroneous belief regarding his\nrulings held special importance for the district judge in assigning\nresponsibility for the day planners reaching the jury room. Through-\nout the findings pertaining to this issue, the district judge frequently\nreferred to what he believed were government attempts to introduce\nthe evidence which had been refused.7 And, the district court obvi-\n  7\n    See J.A. 2835 (relating that he had \"admitted four photocopied pages\nfrom the brown day planner and two photocopied pages from the black\nday planner into evidence . . . to show [Doris’s] state of mind regarding\nher daughter’s return from a visit to Indiana,\" but that \"[a]ll other evi-\ndence in the two day planners was deemed inadmissible by the Court as\nirrelevant and unduly prejudicial\"); J.A. 2861 (stating that the black day\nplanner was \"excluded evidence\"); J.A. 2876 (stating that \"[p]rior to trial,\n\f28                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\nously relied upon this erroneous belief in concluding that Mellin\nplaced the day planners with the evidence with the \"intent to act out-\nside the Orders of this Court and the confines of the law.\" J.A. 2869.\n\n   Contrary to the district court’s opinion, the seventy-six page pre-\ntrial order did not specifically exclude Doris’s black day planner or\nbrown day planner from evidence. See United States v. Lentz, 282 F.\nSupp. 2d 399, 411-425 (E.D. Va. 2002).8 The district court was never\npresented with a motion to admit either of the day planners into evi-\ndence in their entirety. Although the district court’s pretrial ruling\nrejected evidence similar to that contained within the day planners,\nsee id at 423-24, the motion itself only sought a pretrial ruling regard-\ning those pages of each day planner that were ultimately ruled admis-\nsible.\n\n   Compounding this error, the district court also erroneously stated\nthat the government had \"attempted to persuade me to revise my rul-\nings on this evidence,\" and that AUSA \"Haynes sought to admit the\nbrown day planner in full despite the clear definitive ruling excluding\nthe full day planner.\" J.A. 2858. We can find no such definitive rul-\ning, nor any place in the record where Haynes unsuccessfully sought\nto admit the brown day planner in its entirety.\n\n     During her cross-examination of Rigger, Clark had introduced the\n\nthe Court excluded the majority of the evidence in the black and brown\nday planners as hearsay\"); J.A. 2879 (stating the he had \"declined to\nadmit\" the entries); J.A. 2885 (stating that \"[t]he black and brown day\nplanners contained several notes and articles that were not admitted\nbecause they were irrelevant and prejudicial\"); J.A. 2899 (noting that his\n\"pretrial ruling was very detailed\" and that \"Ms. Lentz’s day planner evi-\ndence was excluded\").\n   8\n     The district judge also stated that this court affirmed his evidentiary\nruling in an interlocutory appeal by the government. Our opinion, how-\never, only addressed the narrow issue appealed to us — whether the dis-\ntrict court had erred in excluding four specific statements allegedly made\nby Lentz and two specific statements allegedly made by Doris to other\nwitnesses. See United States v. Lentz, No. 02-19, 58 Fed. Appx. 961,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">253949</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. Feb. 6, 2003).\n\f                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                       29\ntwo pages from the black day planner admitted in the pretrial order\nthat indicated that Julia was scheduled to return on April 24 rather\nthan April 23. On redirect examination, Haynes moved to introduce\nthe two pages from the brown day planner also admitted in the pretrial\norder that corroborated Rigger’s testimony that Doris was to pick up\nJulia on April 23. The precise colloquy from the redirect examination\nwas as follows:\n\n    Ms. Haynes: Your Honor, I’d move in Government’s\n    Exhibit 548, and there is no objection to it. If I can—\n\n    Ms. Clark: It’s just a two-page section because the whole\n    page is a bigger one.\n\n    Ms. Haynes: I think later we might try to want to move the\n    rest in. But for now, we’ll just move in these two pages.\n\n    The Court: Okay. Two pages of 548 will be received.\n\nJ.A. 599. At the evidentiary hearing, Clark, when asked if she recalled\nobjecting to Haynes’s supposed attempt to admit the entirety of the\nday planner testified as follows:\n\n    [Ms. Clark]. I do now that you’ve shown me the transcript\n    where I did object. What I did was object to the admission\n    of the entire document rather than just two pages. . . . [A]\n    [r]ather unintelligible one, but I thought I got the message\n    across.\n\nJ.A. 2463-64. In our view, if Clark intended to convey that message,\nshe failed to do so. Both the entire brown day planner and the excerpt\nadmitted in the pretrial order were marked by the government as\nExhibit 548. Although at first blush it might appear that Haynes was\nseeking to admit the entirety of Exhibit 548, Clark’s interruption of\nHaynes’s motion to introduce the evidence actually indicates that\nHaynes was only attempting to move in the two-page excerpt from\nthe brown day planner in response to Clark’s introduction of the two-\npage excerpt from the black day planner.\n\f30                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\n   Moreover, we cannot fairly interpret Clark’s statement as an objec-\ntion. At best, it was an interruption that might be viewed as clarifica-\ntion that Exhibit 548 consisted only of the admitted sections and not\nthe brown day planner in its entirety. Finally, we do not interpret the\ndistrict court’s ruling as one excluding disputed evidence. The collo-\nquy rather clearly demonstrates that Haynes only moved to introduce\nthe excerpt admitted pretrial and the district court simply admitted\nthat particular evidence.9\n\n   For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the district court\nclearly erred in finding that the government sought to introduce the\nentire contents of black and brown day planners into evidence pretrial\nand sought to introduce the entire contents of the brown day planner\nduring trial in contravention of the pretrial order. These clearly erro-\nneous findings regarding the government’s attempted use of the day\nplanners are significant because the district court inferred from this\nperceived pattern on the part of Mellin a steadfast intent and motive\non his part to get the day planners admitted into evidence in their\nentirety despite \"the Orders of th[e] Court and the confines of the\nlaw.\" J.A. 2869.\n  9\n   Mr. Dunham, who represented the defense team at the evidentiary\nhearing but was not present during the trial, appeared to acknowledge\nthat the transcript indicated no such ruling, and the district court seemed\nto have no independent recollection of it. Upon Clark’s testimony that\nshe made an objection, the following colloquy took place:\n      The Court:    Was [Ms. Clark’s objection] sustained or over-\n                    ruled?\n      Mr. Dunham:   The government withdrew the offer of the entire\n                    book, but noted that, I think, later, we might try\n                    to want to move the rest of it in. But, for now,\n                    we’ll just move in these two pages. So they\n                    withdrew the offer of the entire exhibit.\n      The Court:    All right. Did I admit the two pages at that time?\n      Mr. Dunham:   \"Yes, okay, two pages of 548 will be received.\"\n                    That was the Court’s ruling.\n      The Court:    All right. Thank you.\nJ.A. 2464. Counsel also acknowledged that it was \"technically correct\"\nthat the day planner was not actually offered in its entirety. J.A. 2823.\n\f                        UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                          31\n              3. The Responsibility of the Court Staff\n\n   The district court also clearly erred in finding that his courtroom\nstaff had no responsibility for the extraneous evidence reaching the\njury. This clearly erroneous factual finding, upon which the district\ncourt also bolstered its finding that Mellin must have intentionally\nslipped the evidence to the jury, is likewise not supported by a fair\nview of the evidence.\n\n   First, it is undisputed that the court clerk made at least two negli-\ngent errors in the handling of the exhibits in this case: she discarded\nthe complete exhibit list and kept an incomplete copy, and inadver-\ntently returned an original exhibit to the AUSA’s office. The district\ncourt acknowledged that the court clerk’s \"error of discarding the\noriginal exhibit list is significant because the unofficial clerk’s exhibit\nlist does not accurately reflect the exhibits that were identified and\nused at trial.\" J.A. 2860. However, the district court found that Solo-\nmon could not be held responsible for the extraneous evidence reach-\ning the jury because (1) the attorneys’ exhibit list reflected that the\nday planners were not admitted into evidence; (2) Solomon’s incom-\nplete \"exhibit list was accurate with respect to the black and brown\nday planners because it reflected the fact that only the photocopied\npages, and not the original day planners, were admitted into evi-\ndence;\" and (3) Solomon had never been in possession of the day\nplanners. J.A. 2860.\n\n   There is no dispute that counsel knew that only the small excerpts\nfrom the day planners had been introduced into evidence and, as far\nas we know, Solomon was never in possession of the complete day\nplanners, at least prior to sorting the evidence. But these findings do\nnot support the ultimate conclusion that Solomon had no responsibil-\nity whatsoever for the evidence getting to the jury room. It is the duty\nof the court clerk to be responsible for admitted exhibits during trial\nand jury deliberations and, as acknowledged by the court clerk, to\nassure that only admitted evidence goes to the jury at the conclusion\nof the trial. To do this, at the least the clerk must maintain an accurate\nlist of exhibits and handle them with great care. Here, all agree that\nthe court clerk reviewed the trial exhibits at the counsel tables for\nbetween 45 minutes and an hour while in the company of, and per-\nhaps being assisted by, up to twelve persons. Having supposedly sep-\n\f32                      UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\narated the admitted items from the non-admitted exhibits at the same\ncounsel table, the court clerk delegated exclusive responsibility to the\ncourt security officer to physically load the exhibits onto the cart, with\nthe assistance of whoever happened to help, for transport to the jury.\nThere is no indication that the court clerk at any time separated or\nreviewed these exhibits by herself or even took primary responsibility\nfor doing so. Nor is there any indication that, after going through the\ninitial process of meeting with counsel to separate and sort exhibits,\nshe physically segregated the exhibits away from the tables in order\nto check them off from the \"official\" court exhibit list to fulfill her\nduty of ensuring that no extraneous material was taken into the jury\nroom.\n\n   As a general observation, we think it highly unlikely that anyone\nwould have taken the brazen step of intentionally placing unadmitted\nexhibits either with the evidence on the table or in the loaded cart\nwhile in the presence of his or her colleagues, court personnel, oppos-\ning counsel, and law enforcement officers. The manner in which the\nevidence was sorted and loaded for transport to the jury, on the other\nhand, invited any one of numerous persons to inadvertently place the\nextraneous items with the \"admitted\" stack of the sorted evidence. In\nshort, had the court clerk taken the step of physically removing the\nadmitted exhibits from counsels’ tables to check them against her\nofficial exhibit list, the day planners (however they found their way\ninto the wrong pile) would likely have been discovered and removed\nwithout incident.\n\n   The district court’s findings that \"Scruggs did not cause the extra-\nneous evidence to go to the jury\" and \"cannot be held accountable for\nthe submission of the unadmitted black and brown day planners\nbecause his responsibility was limited to the transport of evidence,\"\nJ.A. 2859, are also clearly erroneous. Scruggs was not merely loading\ninto the cart the evidence that the courtroom clerk instructed him to\nload. According to his testimony, he was allowing numerous other\npersons to assist him in his duties and, according to Chellis, the day\nplanners were last known to be at counsel table near the area where\nthis activity was taking place. Thus, Scruggs or one of his helpers\nmay well have inadvertently placed the day planners in the cart while\nloading it. Scruggs, at least, was convinced that this was exactly how\nthe error had occurred. In addition, the district court never addressed\n\f                        UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                        33\nthe testimony of Scruggs and defense counsel over who was handling\nthe evidence after it was placed in the cart. According to Scruggs, no\none got near the cart after it was loaded. However, if the testimony\nof defense counsel is to be credited, Lieberman was invited to handle\nthe evidence after it was loaded.\n\n                          4. AUSA Mellin\n\n   Having erroneously found that the government repeatedly\nattempted to admit the day planners and that the district court rejected\nthese attempts both during the pretrial and trial proceedings, and hav-\ning erroneously exonerated the court staff from any responsibility for\nthe day planners finding their way into the jury room, the district\ncourt proceeded to make a rather broad leap to a finding that Mellin\nintentionally placed both day planners with the evidence after the law-\nyers and the clerk completed their review of the evidence in order to\ncircumvent the court’s prior rulings. These findings are unsupported\nby the evidence and clearly erroneous as well.\n\n                     a. The Black Day Planner\n\n    The district court found that Mellin \"is responsible for the inten-\ntional submission of the black day planner, excluded evidence, to the\njury\" based upon his conclusion that \"Mellin’s demeanor and testi-\nmony demonstrate that he was being less than candid with the Court\nwith respect to the black day planner.\" J.A. 2861. This adverse credi-\nbility determination is, in turn, grounded in the following three obser-\nvations by the trial court: (1) Mellin \"was the last person known to\nhave handled the black day planner,\" but did not \"recall its appear-\nance in court on the day the evidence went to the jury;\" (2) Mellin tes-\ntified that he \"was unaware of the location of the black day planner\nduring the trial,\" but filed a response to Lentz’s motion for a new trial\nstating that \"both day planners were in the courtroom on the Govern-\nment’s counsel table;\" and (3) Mellin \"was acutely aware of the\nimportance of the unadmitted black day planner because he directed\nthe jury’s attention to it in his closing argument, but he appeared to\ndiminish its importance on the day of the hearing.\" J.A. 2861-62.\nThese observations, however, are wholly insufficient to support the\ndistrict court’s credibility determination or the ultimate finding of\nintentional conduct.\n\f34                      UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\n   First, the fact that Mellin did not recall seeing the black day plan-\nner when the evidence was being sorted, but was known to have had\nit a few days before, does not support an adverse credibility determi-\nnation. According to the undisputed evidence, Chellis, at Mellin’s\nrequest, retrieved the black day planner from the evidence room a few\ndays before closing arguments to make copies of the pages introduced\nby defense counsel. Chellis testified that he placed the black day plan-\nner with the copies in Mellin’s chair at their office and that he later\nobserved the black day planner in the courtroom at the government’s\ntable. However, none of the other witnesses testified that they saw the\nblack day planner in the courtroom on the day the evidence was\nsorted (although Scruggs averred in his affidavit that he did). For his\npart, Mellin confirmed that he asked Chellis to obtain copies of the\ntwo admitted pages from the day planner in preparation for his clos-\ning argument. He did not deny that the black day planner was in the\ncourtroom or deny the possibility that he might have brought it there.\nIn short, Mellin’s testimony that he did not recall seeing the black day\nplanner in the courtroom is not contradicted and is hardly incriminat-\ning. The only evidence presented was that the black day planner was\nlast seen on the government’s table, but not in Mellin’s personal pos-\nsession.\n\n   Second, the government’s response to Lentz’s motion, indicating\nthat the black day planner was in the courtroom on government’s\ncounsel table, is not inconsistent with Mellin’s testimony that he did\nnot personally recall seeing the black day planner in the courtroom.\nMellin testified that he did not personally observe the black day plan-\nner it in the courtroom, but Chellis testified that he did see it on coun-\nsel’s table at some point after he made copies, which would render the\ngovernment’s response entirely consistent with the AUSA Office’s\ninternal investigation into the matter. In addition, the court security\nofficer, at least early on, was attesting that it was in the courtroom as\nwell.\n\n   Finally, the district court clearly erred in finding that Mellin’s use\nof the black day planner during closing was inconsistent with his\nposition at the evidentiary hearing that he placed no particular impor-\ntance upon it. During closing, Mellin argued that the black day plan-\nner, which indicated an April 24 pick-up date for Julia, was consistent\nwith Lentz’s April 20th telephone message moving the pick-up from\n\f                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                        35\nthe 24th to the 23rd and that, in any event, the difference was irrele-\nvant because neither date coincided with Julia’s return ticket. If any-\nthing, Mellin’s argument demonstrates that he did not view the black\nday planner entries as important, but rather as a red herring raised by\nthe defense that warranted only a brief explanation in closing.\n\n                    b. The Brown Day Planner\n\n   The district court’s finding that Mellin was also responsible for the\nintentional submission of the brown day planner is also clearly erro-\nneous. The district court based this finding upon (1) statements by\nseveral witnesses that Mellin had physical possession of the brown\nday planner during closing argument the day before the evidence was\nsorted; and (2) the testimony of defense counsel that, on the following\nmorning, Mellin asked for permission to remove the contents and sub-\nmit the brown leather cover with only the admitted pages and that he\nhad the brown day planner and the admitted copies in hand at the\ntime. This testimony is insufficient to support the district court’s\ndetermination that Mellin intentionally slipped the brown day planner\nwith its entire contents into the evidence being taken to the jury.\n\n   First, it was patently insufficient to rest a finding of intentional\nmisconduct on the undisputed fact that Mellin handled the brown day\nplanner during his closing argument and, while doing so, referred to\nits admitted entries pertaining to Julia’s expected date of return.\nAccording to the district court, Mellin’s \"act of holding the brown day\nplanner before the jury [during closing] served to focus their attention\non it because he wanted to make sure they reviewed it. Accordingly,\nit is reasonable to infer that Mr. Mellin was himself focused on the\nimportance of the brown day planner.\" J.A. 2864.\n\n   Although the district court does not elaborate upon these infer-\nences, we can only assume that the court believed Mellin concocted\na plan before closing to sneak the unadmitted and undiscussed por-\ntions of the planner into the jury room — evidence he never directly\nattempted to introduce — with the admitted portions that he discussed\nin his closing and that, as part of this plan, he drew some special\nattention to the brown day planner to ensure that the jury looked at\nit. Again, the district court’s view of the evidence was no doubt\ntainted by its erroneous belief that the day planner had been excluded\n\f36                      UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\nin the pretrial order and again during trial. Moreover, it is not reason-\nable to infer from Mellin’s mere use of the planner in closing argu-\nment that Mellin viewed the unadmitted contents of the brown day\nplanner as so critical or important that he would concoct a plan to\nhighlight the brown day planner to the jury in closing arguments and\nthen slip it to the jury in contravention of court orders. During his\nclosing argument, Mellin referred briefly to the admitted pages from\nthe day planner which corroborated the testimony of numerous wit-\nnesses that Doris told them she was bound for Lentz’s house on April\n23 to pick up Julia. The only other demonstrated importance that the\npages held for Mellin was that they contradicted the black day plan-\nner pages which, according to Lieberman, had been submitted to dem-\nonstrate \"an inconsistency and some confusion with the government’s\ntheory\" that \"on April 23rd of 1996, Doris Lentz went to Jay Lentz’s\nhouse to pick up their daughter.\" J.A. 2488.\n\n    We are also unable to endorse the district court’s finding of inten-\ntional conduct based upon defense counsel’s assertion that Mellin\nrequested their permission to insert the admitted excerpt from the\nbrown day planner inside the leather cover. Clark and Lieberman tes-\ntified that Mellin approached Clark and sought approval to remove\nthe contents of the brown day planner from the brown leather cover\nand submit the cover with the two admitted pages. According to Lie-\nberman, however, the request was made before Solomon even\nchecked the exhibits. Lieberman testified that, \"somewhat because of\nthe contentious nature of the relationship Mr. Mellin and I have had\nover the year,\" he \"said, almost sarcastically to Mr. Mellin, you know,\nthat’s fine, Steve, as long as you take everything else out.\" J.A. 2492.\n\n   Mellin acknowledged having a brief conversation with defense\ncounsel about the brown day planner, but did not recall making this\nalleged request. Mellin’s inability to recall caused the district court\n\"great concern.\" J.A. 2865. However, a fair reading of the evidence\ndoes not support the inference that Mellin was not credible, or that\nthis conversation was part of his plan to intentionally slip the entire\ncontents of the day planner to the jury. As lead prosecutor, Mellin was\noverseeing the process of sorting the exhibits, but no one has asserted\nthat he was involved in the hands-on sorting of evidence. There was\nno particular controversy going on that would have caused Mellin to\nremember the specifics of that morning. The prosecution team wit-\n\f                         UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                           37\nnesses had no recollection of a conversation between Clark and Mel-\nlin about the brown day planner contents. Solomon and Scruggs were\nin the area at the time of the purported conversation, but they also tes-\ntified that they overheard no such conversation. Defense counsel\nacknowledged that they did not inform Solomon of any agreement to\nsubmit the admitted two pages within the brown leather cover and\nthey admitted that no one from the defense team ever saw or exam-\nined the brown day planner to see if the contents had been removed\nand replaced. Indeed, it is quite a stretch to interpret even the defense\ncounsel’s recitation of what occurred as an \"agreement\" to submit the\nevidence in a different form. According to Lieberman, Mellin asked\nfor permission to submit Government’s Exhibit 548 (which consisted\nof the four photocopied pages) inside the brown leather binder (which\nwas also marked Exhibit 548 but never admitted in its entirety) before\nthe exhibits were even checked by the court clerk and received a sar-\ncastic response. And, Solomon testified that Exhibit 548 was sent to\nthe jury in its admitted form. Thus, it seems more probable that Mel-\nlin, assuming he ever made the request, simply abandoned it in light\nof Lieberman’s sarcastic response.10\n\n  10\n     To the extent that the district court relied upon findings that Mellin’s\ntestimony conflicted with that of his team members, we find that deter-\nmination also to be unsupported by the evidence and insufficient to sup-\nport a finding of \"intentional conduct\" on Mellin’s part. For example, the\ndistrict court erroneously found that Mellin testified \"that he was not in\nthe courtroom when the evidence was prepared for the jury.\" J.A. 2865.\nMellin testified that he walked to the courtroom with Haynes, left shortly\nthereafter to make sure that the audio clip CDs had been completed by\ninformation specialist Bowie, and returned to the courtroom approxi-\nmately 20 to 30 minutes later. Accordingly, by Mellin’s account, he was\npresent in the courtroom early in the process and again at the conclusion\nof the process. Similarly, the district court found Bowie’s testimony that\nhe prepared the audio clips the night before to be inconsistent with Mel-\nlin’s testimony that he left the courtroom to work with Bowie on the\nclips. Although the testimony of neither man is particularly clear, a con-\nclusion that it was inconsistent, thereby indicating untruthfulness on the\npart of Mellin, is simply not a fair reading of the testimony.\n\f38                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\n                             5. Conclusion\n\n   Having thoroughly reviewed the transcript from the trial and the\nevidentiary hearing, we hold that the district court’s finding that Mel-\nlin engaged in intentional misconduct is built upon several clearly\nerroneous underlying factual findings and an impermissible view of\nthe evidence of record.\n\n   It is clear that the evidentiary hearing did little to solve the mystery\nof how the day planners found their way into the jury room. Accord-\ning to Mr. Chellis, both day planners were in the courtroom prior to\nthe sorting of the evidence and that he placed the brown day planner\non the back table where the admitted evidence was being segregated.\nScruggs admitted that he saw the brown day planner on the rear table\nand, in an earlier affidavit, stated that he had seen both day planners\non the government’s table. The court clerk denies ever seeing either\nday planner anywhere. By all accounts, three attorneys and one staff\nperson with the defense team, three attorneys and one staff person\nwith the prosecution team, two law enforcement officers, and two\ncourt officers were all present at various times during the sorting pro-\ncess. The evidence was sorted on and around four tables in the court-\nroom and involved \"hundreds\" of pieces of documentary and physical\nevidence. Not a single witness observed Mellin place the brown or\nblack day planner with the evidence to be placed on the cart. There\nis no direct evidence whatsoever, and plainly insufficient circumstan-\ntial evidence, that Mellin placed any item on the cart or even that\nMellin handled either day planner after the exhibits had been checked\nor while the cart was being loaded. There is no evidence that Mellin\nwas ever alone in the area of the exhibits. And, there is no evidence\nthat Mellin told anyone to include the day planners with the admitted\nevidence or to place them in the cart.11\n   11\n      The district court, near the end of the hearing and after Mellin had\ntestified, also remained clearly in doubt:\n      In fact, what’s missing for me is still no one seems to want to\n      explain what happened to the [brown day] planner or the black\n      day planner, how they ended up in the courtroom. How they got\n      to the jury room and I’m — I’m waiting for your arguments to\n      hear what happened to it. How did these two items that were\n      never, ever admitted end[ ] up in the jury room?\nJ.A. 2751. Unfortunately, the district court appeared to believe that fault,\nindeed intentional fault, had to be placed somewhere, despite the univer-\nsal lack of knowledge on everyone’s part.\n\f                         UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                          39\n   In our view, despite the best intentions on the part of the district\ncourt and the frustrations associated with this serious incident, the\nevidence simply cannot support the district court’s findings that Mel-\nlin intentionally slipped these items into the jury room in contraven-\ntion of court orders and at risk to his legal career.12 The district court\nclearly erred in finding that it had excluded both day planners from\nevidence pretrial and that it had excluded the brown day planner dur-\ning a renewed attempt on the part of the government during trial, and\nerred in finding that these attempts demonstrated a motive on the part\nof Mellin to get the day planners before the jury notwithstanding the\ncourt’s rulings.\n\n   The district court also clearly erred in finding that his court staff\nhad no responsibility whatsoever for the extraneous evidence reaching\nthe jury room (although we acknowledge that their failures were\nlikely the result of negligence, inattention, or poor procedures on their\npart). And, the district court clearly erred in concluding that Mellin\nintentionally placed the brown and black day planner with the evi-\ndence to go to the jury based upon testimony that he handled both of\nthe day planners in the days leading up to the sorting of the evidence\nand handled the brown day planner prior to the exhibits being\nchecked by the court clerk, and the district court’s perception that the\ncontents of those planners were especially significant to him.\n\n  Accordingly, we reverse the district court’s finding of intentional\nmisconduct on the part of the government and, in particular, Mellin.\n  12\n     Indeed, with regard to any evidence of intentional misconduct, it\nmakes no more sense to assert that Mellin intentionally placed the items\nwith the evidence in order to bolster his case than it does to assert that\nthe defense team intentionally placed the items with the evidence in\norder to create a basis for a new trial motion. Neither theory is supported\nby the record and we frankly think it strains reason to find on this record\nthat an AUSA or anyone else would have even attempted to do so in the\nmidst of all of the people present and involved in the process at the time.\nIn short, there is plenty of blame to go around. The evidence would sup-\nport a finding that the exhibits reached the jury room as a result of negli-\ngent or inadvertent actions on the part of the court staff, on the part of\nthe government and its team, or on the part of someone associated with\nthe defense team. It most likely reached the jury room as a result of the\ninadvertent errors of some combination thereof.\n\f40                      UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\nAs an appellate court, we are reluctant to overturn factual findings of\na district court. Such findings, particularly those as to credibility, are\nentitled to great deference, but they are not unreviewable. When find-\nings are based on an erroneous recitation of the record and impermis-\nsible inferences drawn from it, we are compelled to vacate them.\nHere, the evidence was insufficient to support the district court’s find-\ning of intentional misconduct or even exclusive responsibility on the\npart of Mellin for the submission of the extraneous evidence, and the\ndistrict court clearly erred in so ruling.\n\n                         C. New Trial Grant\n\n  Finally, we consider the district court’s decision to order a new trial\non the kidnapping charge because the unadmitted evidence deprived\nLentz of a fair trial.\n\n   Under Rule 33, the district court \"may vacate any judgment and\ngrant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.\" Fed. R. Crim.\nP. 33(a). \"If prejudicial evidence that was not introduced at trial\ncomes before the jury, the defendant is entitled to a new trial.\" United\nStates v.

LENTZ                       41\ngovernment failed to overcome the presumption that the extraneous\nevidence was prejudicial.\n\n  In his motion to set aside the jury’s verdict, Lentz asserted that he\nwas prejudiced by the following notations contained within the brown\nday planner:\n\n    \"School rec’d threatening phone calls. Only way Julia stay\n    Jay sign stat. That he understands cannot pu Julia @ school\"\n\n    \"4th floor of courthouse - Protective Order -Ex Parte Order\n    - he’s served first\"\n\n    \"Judges in Arlington want criminal charge - protective\n    order\"\n\n    \"#XX-XXXXXXX 6/21/95; Chris Bibro; trespassing inci-\n    dent/harassing phone calls -\"Karen Crane, Commonwealth\n    Atty’s Office 358-7273 protective order/advice\" - \"Officer\n    Williams #951-204033\"\n\n\"Det.

Lentz also asserted that he was prejudiced by the following\nnotations contained within the black day planner:\n\n    Jan 3, 1996 - Jay pu Julia - she said she wanted to stay with\n    mommy - he told her to stop playing games and get her coat\n    on. . . .\n\n    January 6, 1996 - \"My daddy told me you called the police\n    on him. Is that true?\"\n\n    January 7, 1996 - \"My daddy told me when I was a baby I\n    almost died because you couldn’t feed me because you were\n    taking drugs.\"\n\f42                      UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\n     January 10, 1996 - \"Do you want my dad’s house? My dad\n     told me you want money from him. Is that true?\"\n\n     January 11, 1996 - \"My dad says he loves me more than\n     you. He says he loves me so much he wishes he could have\n     me - live with me.\"\n\n     February 11, 1996 - 5:05 p.m. rec’d abusive phone call -\n     where the hell was I - why not pick Julia up between 4-4:30\n     - said he hadn’t asked for early pu therefore pu at 6:00. . . .\n\n     February 23, 1996 - My daddy told me the judge was going\n     to make him pick me up from school.\"\n\nJ.A. 3321.\n\n   The district court grouped the extraneous evidence into four cate-\ngories: (1) Doris’s notes concerning harassing and threatening tele-\nphone calls made by Lentz to her and to Julia’s day care center; (2)\nDoris’s notes indicating that she was pursuing a protective order; (3)\nDoris’s notes documenting statements made by Lentz to Julia; and (4)\nDoris’s notations of telephone numbers for an Arlington County\ndetective and for a domestic violence support group. After determin-\ning that the statements contained within the day planners violated\nLentz’s Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him and\nwere not admissible under any exception to the hearsay rules, the dis-\ntrict court concluded that they were indeed prejudicial and warranted\nthe grant of a new trial. Like the district court, we examine each cate-\ngory of notations for their prejudicial effect.\n\n   With regard to Doris’s notes concerning Lentz’s harassing and\nthreatening telephone calls made to her and to Julia’s day care center,\nthe district court held that the evidence was prejudicial because it sug-\ngested that Lentz was verbally abusive to Doris and the school staff\nin the months just prior to Doris’s disappearance. We cannot say that\nthis was an abuse of discretion, at least insofar as the notation con-\ncerning Lentz’s threatening telephone call to the day care center.\nAlthough the jury heard testimony and recordings demonstrating that\nLentz’s verbal harassment of Doris continued after the separation, the\n\f                        UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                        43\njury heard no evidence regarding Lentz’s alleged harassment of day-\ncare center staff. The fact that Lentz’s anger overflowed from Doris\nto others connected with her reflects on Lentz’s dangerousness.\n\n   With regard to Doris’s notes indicating that she was pursuing a\nprotective order against Lentz, the district court held that this evi-\ndence was prejudicial because there was no evidence at trial that\nDoris had sought or obtained a protective order against Lentz, and\ncertainly not in the months just prior to her disappearance. In addi-\ntion, the district court rejected the government’s argument that these\nnotations were merely cumulative of the evidence regarding Doris’s\nfear of Lentz. Again, we cannot say that this was an abuse of discre-\ntion. A number of witnesses testified that Doris was fearful of Lentz\nand that she had taken measures to avoid isolated contact with him.\nHowever, evidence that Doris had taken the additional step of pursu-\ning a protective order and the progress she had apparently made with\nthe authorities is of a quite different character — it may well have\nindicated to the jury that Doris had a recent and renewed fear of phys-\nical assault at the hands of Lentz in the months just prior to her disap-\npearance and that she feared such physical assault enough to take\nlegal measures to protect herself. Although such evidence may well\nbe relevant and admissible in proper form, the district court did not\nabuse its discretion in concluding that the government failed to estab-\nlish that the evidence was not prejudicial in the form presented.\n\n   With regard to Doris’s notes documenting Lentz’s alleged state-\nments to Julia about Doris, the district court ruled that the notes were\nprejudicial \"bad character\" evidence inadmissible under Rule 404 of\nthe Rules of Evidence, and \"cast Mr. Lentz in the worst possible light\nas a husband and a father.\" J.A. 2887. As noted by the district court,\nthe statements made by Lentz pertained to matters about which the\njury was already aware, such as the acute hostility between the par-\nties, the sale of their marital home and the division of its proceeds,\nand Doris’s attempts to always exchange Julia at the daycare center.\nEvidence that Lentz told his daughter about these matters, however,\nis of a more prejudicial nature because the jury could reasonably have\ninferred that Lentz was disparaging Doris to her daughter in the\nmonths prior to Doris’s disappearance in an attempt to alienate her\nfrom her mother and perhaps ameliorate the absence of her mother in\nthe future.\n\f44                      UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\n   Finally, with regard to Doris’s notations of telephone numbers for\nan Arlington County detective and for a domestic violence support\ngroup, the district court held that the evidence was prejudicial because\nthere was no evidence before the jury that Doris had been the victim\nof domestic abuse since her separation from Lentz in 1993. We can-\nnot say that this was an abuse of discretion because, as the district\ncourt noted, these references suggest that Lentz’s physically abusive\nbehavior towards Doris had continued after their separation.\n\n   To conclude, the district court held that the government failed to\ndemonstrate that there was no reasonable possibility that the jury’s\nverdict was not influenced by the notations contained within the black\nand brown day planners. In particular, the district court noted the cir-\ncumstantial nature of the evidence against Lentz, the extended length\nof the jury’s deliberations in the case, the fact that the jury at one\npoint was deadlocked, and the fact that, during the penalty phase,\nseven jurors indicated that they had residual doubt. When we look at\nthe information contained in the day planners in light of the district\ncourt’s evidentiary rulings restricting the government’s evidence\nregarding the actions of Doris and Lentz prior to her disappearance,\nwe can find no abuse of discretion in the decision of the district judge\nto grant a new trial. This is particularly so when one factors in that\nLentz was precluded from rebutting in any way the evidence of\nactions taken by him and statements attributed to him.13 Because we\ncannot say that this was an abuse of discretion, we affirm the district\ncourt’s grant of a new trial.\n\n                             IV. Remand\n\n   Our decision to affirm the district court’s granting of a new trial of\ncourse necessitates a remand. We have recognized that, even in the\nabsence of established bias, reassignment to a different judge on\nremand \"is appropriate in unusual circumstances where both for the\njudge’s sake and the appearance of justice an assignment to a differ-\nent judge is salutary and in the public interest, especially as it mini-\nmizes even a suspicion of partiality.\" United States v.

Because this is an\nunusual case, we direct that on remand, the case be assigned to a dif-\nferent judge for a new trial.\n\n   Prior to the evidentiary hearing, the government filed a motion ask-\ning the district judge to recuse himself from holding the hearing into\nhow the extraneous evidence found its way into the jury room\nbecause it would necessarily require the judge to weigh the credibility\nof the government representatives against his long-time court person-\nnel. The government also took the extraordinary step of seeking a writ\nof mandamus from this court to recuse the district judge, which we\nsummarily denied.\n\n   Since then, however, the district court has extensively criticized the\ngovernment team and has decided that there was intentional miscon-\nduct on Mellin’s part during trial and when the evidence was submit-\nted. We have held that such findings are not supported by the record\nbefore us and must be vacated, but \"imply [no] personal criticism\" of\nthe district judge in doing so. Guglielmi, 929 F.2d at 1008 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). We remain concerned, however, that the\ndistrict judge \"cannot reasonably be expected to erase the earlier\n\f46                      UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\nimpressions from his . . . mind or may tend to lean over backwards\nor overreact in an effort to be fair and impartial\" on retrial. Id. (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted). In addition, we recognize that Mellin,\nif he is part of the prosecution team on remand, would be understand-\nably distracted from his task of representing the United States in this\nvery serious case. Although the district judge is very familiar with the\ncase and has already ruled upon various issues, the grant of a new trial\nwipes the slate clean. We do not believe that any waste or duplication\nwould be out of proportion to the appearance of fairness a reassign-\nment will preserve.\n\n                         V. Appeal No. 04-8\n\n   Mellin has filed a separate appeal challenging the district court’s\nfindings that he intentionally submitted the evidence to the jury. Lentz\nfiled a motion to dismiss Mellin’s appeal because (1) Mellin filed his\nappeal out of time and (2) Mellin lacks standing to appeal the order\nbecause a prosecutor may not independently appeal an order appealed\nby the government unless it also imposes sanctions upon the prosecu-\ntor individually. Because we have concluded that the findings chal-\nlenged in Mellin’s separate appeal were clearly erroneous and they\nhave been vacated in Appeal No. 04-7, we dismiss Mellin’s appeal as\nmoot.\n\n                            VI. Conclusion\n\n   For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the district court’s judgment\nof acquittal, vacate the district court’s findings of intentional miscon-\nduct on the part of the government, and affirm the district court’s\ngrant of a new trial based upon the prejudicial effect of the extraneous\nevidence. We also direct that this case be assigned to a different judge\non remand.\n\n     AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED\n\nMICHAEL, Circuit Judge, dissenting in part and concurring in part:\n\n   I respectfully dissent from the majority’s decision to reverse the\njudgment of acquittal entered by the district court. For a kidnapping\n\f                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                        47\nto occur, the perpetrator must hold his victim for an appreciable\nperiod of time. Here, the jury could only guess that Jay Lentz (Lentz)\nheld Doris Lentz (Doris) prior to her death: there is no direct evidence\nof a holding, nor is there any evidence from which a holding can be\nreasonably inferred. In short, the government did not prove a kidnap-\nping. Because reversal of the judgment of acquittal means that the\ncase against Lentz remains open, I concur in parts III, IV, and V of\nthe majority’s opinion, which, among other things, vacate the district\ncourt’s misconduct findings against the government, affirm the grant\nof a new trial, and deal with procedures on remand. My reasons for\ndissenting from part II.C of the majority opinion follow.\n\n                                   I.\n\n   Lentz was indicted for kidnapping that resulted in the victim’s\ndeath, in violation of the Federal Kidnapping Act, 18 U.S.C.\n§ 1201(a). To convict Lentz, the government had to prove: (1) that he\nwillfully caused Doris to be transported in interstate commerce; (2)\nthat he unlawfully seized, confined, inveigled, decoyed, kidnapped,\nabducted, or carried her away; (3) that he held Doris for ransom or\nreward or otherwise; and (4) that her death resulted. Ante at 9-10. The\ngovernment’s theory at trial was that Lentz devised an intricate\nscheme to lure Doris into driving from Virginia to his house in Mary-\nland, and at some point after she arrived, he killed her. Ante at 3-9.\nThe government, however, did not attempt to prove when, where, or\nhow Lentz killed Doris, nor did it offer any evidence or theory about\nwhat Lentz did between the time Doris arrived at his house and the\ntime of her death. The government simply failed to prove the holding\nelement of kidnapping.\n\n   At the close of the government’s case, Lentz made a motion for\njudgment of acquittal pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure\n29, asserting that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction\nbecause the government did not prove the holding element. According\nto Lentz, the jury could do nothing \"other than speculate that Ms.\nLentz was ever held.\" J.A. 1603. When the district court turned to the\ngovernment for a response, the following exchange occurred:\n\n    THE COURT: Tell me what the detention is in this case.\n\f48                      UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\n     [AN AUSA]: The detention began, Your Honor, when\n     [Doris] was inveigled. She was being held when she started\n     to be inveigled over to [Lentz’s] house. And when she got\n     to his house, he had to hold her to kill her.\n\n       Somehow or other, he detained her there and he killed\n     her.\n\n     THE COURT: What evidence do you have of any of that?\n\n     [AN AUSA]: That [Doris] was ultimately killed. And that\n     [Lentz] had to hold her to detain her to ultimately kill her.\n     ...\n\nJ.A. 1614-15. The district court requested briefing on the holding\nissue and permitted the trial to proceed. Then, at the close of all the\nevidence, Lentz renewed his Rule 29 motion, asserting that the gov-\nernment had still not introduced any evidence that Doris was held\nprior to her death. The district court again took the motion under\nadvisement, this time stating that it would allow the case to proceed\nto verdict in order to \"preserv[e] the government’s right to appeal in\nthe event a guilty verdict is returned but then is set aside by the grant-\ning of a judgment of acquittal.\" J.A. 2351.\n\n   The government’s closing argument to the jury is telling for its fail-\nure to point to any evidence that satisfies the holding element of kid-\nnapping. The lead AUSA said to the jury, \"Ladies and gentlemen, we\ndon’t know exactly what happened to Doris Lentz when she got to the\ndefendant’s house on April the 23rd. But we know that she ended up\ndead.\" J.A. 1940. The AUSA also reminded the jury that \"[t]his is not\na murder case. And we’re not required to prove the cause and manner\nof death, how it happened, where it happened. We don’t have to prove\nthat. [We] can’t do it in this case . . . .\" J.A. 1949. The AUSA then\nattempted to summarize the evidence tending to prove each of the\nfour elements necessary to convict Lentz of federal kidnapping. The\ntranscript of the closing argument shows that the government spent\ntwenty-three pages (J.A. 1950-74) summarizing the evidence that\nshowed Lentz had inveigled Doris into traveling to his house, twelve\npages (J.A. 1976-87) summarizing the evidence that showed Doris\ndied as a result of that trip, and two pages (J.A. 1974-76) summariz-\n\f                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                        49\ning the evidence that showed Doris had to travel across a state bound-\nary to reach Lentz’s house. In contrast, the government’s discussion\nof the holding element was limited to three lines. Specifically, the\nAUSA said, \"Next element, held for his purpose. This one is very\nstraight[forward]. All you have to do is find that he held her long\nenough to kill her.\" J.A. 1976. This argument on holding highlights\nthe fundamental failing in the government’s case. It is wrong as a\nmatter of law because the holding in a kidnapping must be for an\nappreciable period. What is more important, the AUSA did not direct\nthe jury to any evidence that would support a finding that Doris was\nheld. The jury nevertheless returned a guilty verdict. Shortly thereaf-\nter, the district court granted Lentz’s Rule 29 motion because \"the\nholding element of kidnaping was not proved.\" J.A. 2387. The gov-\nernment appeals that decision.\n\n                                  II.\n\n   In reviewing a judgment of acquittal, we \"view the evidence in the\nlight most favorable to the prosecution and inquire whether any ratio-\nnal trier of fact could find the essential elements of the crime beyond\na reasonable doubt.\" United States v.

Proof\nof the element that must precede the death — a holding — is con-\ntested. Therefore, the narrow question raised by the government’s\nappeal is whether the evidence would allow any rational trier of fact\nto conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Lentz held Doris prior to\nher death. In answering this question, we must keep in mind that:\n\n       The very existence of the Jackson test presupposes that\n    juries accurately charged on the elements of a crime and on\n    the strict burden of persuasion to which they must hold the\n    prosecution, nevertheless may occasionally convict even\n    when it can be said that no rational trier of fact could find\n    guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The test was adopted to\n    provide an additional safeguard against that possibility, and\n    was to give added assurance that guilt should never be found\n    except on a rationally supportable state of near certitude.\n\f50                      UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\nEvans-Smith v. Taylor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"665995\"><a href=\"/opinion/665995/william-evans-smith-v-john-b-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">899</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 905-06 (4th Cir. 1994) (internal\nquotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n   To satisfy the holding element of the Federal Kidnapping Act, the\ngovernment was required to prove that Lentz imposed \"an unlawful\nphysical or mental restraint for an appreciable period against [Doris’s]\nwill and with a willful intent so to confine [her].\" Chatwin v. United\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104211\"><a href=\"/opinion/104211/chatwin-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">326</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">455</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 460 (1946). Throughout this case the govern-\nment has argued that the evidence satisfies the holding element for\neither of two reasons. First, the government argues that Doris was\nheld \"by deception from the time she was inveigled or deceived into\ntraveling from Virginia to Maryland through the time that she came\ninto Lentz’s presence.\" Ante at 13; see also Appellant’s Br. at 52. Sec-\nond, the government argues that \"murder is the ultimate holding,\"\nAppellant’s Br. at 58, and therefore \"the evidence that [Lentz] mur-\ndered [Doris], by whatever means, is sufficient to establish a holding\nby physical restraint.\" Id. at 62. In other words, the government\nargues that the holding element has been implicitly satisfied because,\nas Lentz concedes, the evidence was sufficient to show (1) that Doris\ndrove to Lentz’s house and (2) that Doris died as a result of her visit\nthere. Again, according to the government, either of these events con-\nstitutes a holding.\n\n   The majority does not rely on either of the government’s theories\nof holding. Instead, it concludes that \"the circumstantial evidence in\nthe case supports the jury’s finding that Lentz himself . . . [held Doris]\nagainst her will separate and apart from her trip to the house.\" Ante\nat 16. Specifically, the majority says that a jury could reasonably con-\nclude that once Doris arrived at Lentz’s house, he brought her inside\nand held her there for an appreciable amount of time before her death.\nAnte at 14-16. In support of this conclusion, the majority cites six\npieces of evidence: (1) Lentz told his daughter’s babysitter, Marilyn\nSauder, that Doris had come to his house on the evening of April 23,\n1996; (2) Lentz stopped his mail delivery beginning the morning of\nApril 24, 1996; (3) Lentz left a voice message with his real estate\nagent on April 22, 1996, asking that the lock box at his house be\nremoved so that he could do some interior painting without being dis-\nturbed by visitors; (4) Lentz’s realtor saw a blue tarp in his foyer on\nthe morning of April 23, 1996; the tarp was gone when the realtor\nreturned on April 28, 1996, but no painting had been done; (5) Doris’s\n\f                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                        51\ncar contained blood stains from Lentz and Doris that were not present\nas of April 22, 1996; (6) over a month after Doris disappeared, her\nmother, Bernice Butt, noticed that Lentz had removed a sofa from his\nliving room. Id. at 14. The majority believes that this circumstantial\nevidence provided \"a logical and supporting evidentiary basis for the\njury to conclude that Doris was ‘held’ by Lentz after she arrived at\nhis house but before the fatal wounds were inflicted.\" Ante at 15. I\nrespectfully disagree.\n\n   As the majority acknowledges, the government did not introduce\nany direct evidence that Doris was held. Ante at 16. Therefore, the\nmajority’s theory is correct only if the six pieces of circumstantial\nevidence listed above allow the reasonable inference that Doris was\nheld. It goes without saying that \"inferences from facts which have\nbeen [proven] by circumstantial evidence may be sufficient to sustain\na verdict of guilt.\" United States v.

Draw-\ning such an inference would necessarily require an impermissible\ndegree of speculation and conjecture. At the most, the evidence cited\nby the majority demonstrates that: (1) Lentz devised a scheme to lure\nDoris to travel to his house on April 23, 1996, and he intended to\ncause her harm when she arrived; (2) Lentz took steps to insure that\nnobody would be around when Doris arrived; (3) Doris did arrive at\nLentz’s house on April 23, 1996; (4) after Doris arrived, some harm\nbefell her that led to her death; and (5) Lentz transported Doris’s body\n\f52                      UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\nin her car. Although these permissible findings (almost all requiring\ninferences) strongly suggest that Lentz was involved in Doris’s disap-\npearance and was ultimately responsible for her death, none permit\nthe further inference that Doris was held for an appreciable period of\ntime before her death.\n\n   The majority’s analysis simply assumes a jury could infer that\nDoris was confined and killed in Lentz’s house based on the facts that\nshe arrived at his house, that Lentz did not want people around when\nshe arrived, and that Doris subsequently died. While these facts are\nconsistent with the theory that Doris was confined in Lentz’s house\nprior to her death, that is only one possibility. Lentz could have killed\nDoris in any number of ways that did not involve a holding. For\nexample, Lentz could have taken Doris’s life the moment she walked\ninto his house. Or he could have inflicted a deadly wound from a con-\ncealed position before she had a chance to enter the house. Indeed, it\nmight have been advantageous for Lentz to kill Doris immediately\nupon her arrival in order to minimize the risk that she would put up\na struggle or scream for help. Of course, if Lentz killed Doris as soon\nas she arrived, he did not hold her for the appreciable period neces-\nsary for a federal kidnapping.

There’s\nno evidence that neighbors heard a gunshot. She clearly was inside\nthat house [when she was killed]. . . . This was a quiet crime that no\n\f                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                       53\none heard.\" J.A. 1616. But Lentz did not have to prove that Doris’s\ndeath was immediate; rather it was the government’s burden to prove\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Doris was not killed immediately. All\nof the evidence cited by the majority, including the presence of the\ntarp, Lentz’s plans to keep people away from the house, the blood in\nDoris’s car, and even the missing couch, suggest that Lentz was plan-\nning to, and did in fact, dispose of Doris’s body on the night of April\n23, but this evidence does not show what happened to Doris immedi-\nately before she died. The AUSA unwittingly put his finger on the\nproblem when he said in closing, \"we don’t know exactly what hap-\npened to Doris Lentz when she got to the defendant’s house on April\nthe 23rd. But we know that she ended up dead.\" J.A. 1940. A jury\nmight conclude, based on intuition, that because Doris arrived at\nLentz’s house, she went inside and was held for some amount of time\nbefore being killed.

Contrary to what the majority says, see ante at\n14, however, the record does not establish that either of these events\noccurred. The majority, for example, relies on testimony indicating\nthat Lentz removed a sofa from his living room at some point. The\nwitness who gave this testimony never said when she had last seen\nthe sofa in Lentz’s house, so the sofa could have been removed before\nDoris disappeared. Even if the sofa was removed after the evening of\nApril 23, 1996, a jury could not reasonably infer from the disappear-\nance of a piece of furniture that Doris entered Lentz’s house, was con-\nfined there, and was then murdered. This inference would be\nparticularly speculative in light of the fact that investigators never\nfound any physical evidence linking Doris to the interior of Lentz’s\nhouse. See Evans-Smith, 19 F.3d at 909-10 n.29 (\"Favoring the prose-\ncution with all inferences does not mean that we must ignore evidence\nthat is in the record, but which they ignore.\").\n\n  The majority also argues that the holding element was satisfied\nbecause the evidence showed that \"[f]rom the moment Doris pulled\n\f54                     UNITED STATES v. LENTZ\nup at Lentz’s home . . . Lentz was then in a position to confine her\nphysically if necessary.\" Ante at 15. To support this argument, the\nmajority cites United States v. Higgs, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784555\"><a href=\"/opinion/784555/united-states-v-dustin-john-higgs/\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">281</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 313 (4th Cir.\n2003). The defendant in Higgs tricked three young women into enter-\ning his van by offering them a ride home. The defendant then drove\nto a secluded spot and shot all three. Our court reasoned that the hold-\ning element had been satisfied because once the victims had entered\nthe van, the defendant \"confin[ed] [them] . . . under the pretense of\ntaking them home,\" and he was further \"prepared to confine them at\ngunpoint if necessary.\" Id. at 313. Higgs merely stands for the propo-\nsition that a holding can occur when the perpetrator is confining his\nvictim through deception, while holding force in reserve. The case\ndoes not alter the definition of a holding, which requires an actual\n\"physical or mental restraint for an appreciable period,\" Chatwin, 326\nU.S. at 460, not simply a willingness to restrain should it become nec-\nessary. In this case, as I have pointed out, there is no evidence that\nDoris was confined, by deception or otherwise, after she arrived at\nLentz’s house. Nor is there any evidence that Lentz was in Doris’s\ncompany any longer than was necessary to kill her. Accordingly,\nHiggs does not strengthen the majority’s argument.\n\n   From the very beginning of this case the government has had trou-\nble articulating how a jury could reasonably infer that Lentz held\nDoris for an appreciable period after she arrived at his house but\nbefore she died. The government’s only argument on this score has\nbeen that \"somehow or other [Lentz] detained [Doris at his home] and\nhe killed her. . . . [Lentz] had to hold her to detain her to ultimately\nkill her.\" J.A. 1614-15. However, as our court has said before, \"to\nstart with the assumption that the crime was committed and then to\nshow that each piece of circumstantial evidence can be explained in\na consistent manner is fundamentally different from examining each\npiece of evidence and finally concluding beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat the defendant [is] guilty [of each element of the crime].\" Evans-\nSmith, 19 F.3d at 910. The majority has demonstrated that the evi-\ndence is not inconsistent with the theory that Doris was confined or\nheld before she died. What it has failed to do, however, is explain\nhow each piece of evidence could build to the fair or rational infer-\nence that Lentz held Doris after she arrived at his house but before\nshe was killed. This is not a case in which there is conflicting evi-\ndence on whether a holding occurred. Rather, this is a case in which\n\f                       UNITED STATES v. LENTZ                      55\nthere is no evidence that tells us what happened as far as the holding\nissue is concerned. See Twin Oaks Nursing Home, 692 F.2d at 1328.\nAnd the mere possibility that Doris was held prior to her death is too\nspeculative to be the basis for a jury verdict of guilt.\n\n   I would affirm the district court’s determination that \"the govern-\nment simply did not provide evidence supporting a finding that Ms.\nLentz was held in connection to her alleged murder.\" J.A. 2384. Doris\nLentz’s disappearance and (almost certain) death present a dreadful\ncase that needs to be solved. The Federal Kidnapping Act does not\noffer a solution, however, because there is no evidence of a holding.\n\f</pre>",
