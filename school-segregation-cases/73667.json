COURT OF COMMON PLEAS\n                                                         COUNTY OF SUMMIT, OHIO\n        Appellant/Cross-Appellee                         CASE No.   CV 2009-10-7488\n\n                                DECISION AND JOURNAL ENTRY\n\nDated: June 12, 2013\n\n\n\n        WHITMORE, Judge.\n\n        {¶1}    Appellant/Cross-Appellee, Gerald Mink, appeals from the judgment of the\n\nSummit County Court of Common Pleas in favor of Appellee/Cross-Appellant, Magnum Steel &\n\nTrading, LLC (“Magnum”).          Additionally, Magnum appeals from the judgment on several\n\ngrounds. This Court affirms in part and reverses in part.\n\n                                                    I\n\n        {¶2}    For several years, Gerald Mink (“G. Mink”), Jarrod Mink (“J. Mink”), and Jeffrey\n\nShupe worked at Magnum as scrap steel traders.               G. Mink, in particular, had a lengthy\n\nrelationship with the company and its owner, Paolo Giorgi. In their role as traders, the three men\n\npurchased scrap steel from various companies and sold that same scrap steel to other companies.\n\nAlthough the steel industry fluctuated to some extent over the course of the years, a serious\n\nmarket decline occurred in the fall of 2008 and resulted in a loss of profits for the three traders.\n\nThe decline coincided with growing dissatisfaction among the three traders and eventually led\n\f                                                2\n\n\nthem to the decision to form their own company; a company later named FerroTrade Corporation\n\n(“FerroTrade”). When Giorgi discovered that G. Mink, J. Mink, and Shupe had formed their\n\nown company and, from what Giorgi understood, had taken confidential information and\n\ncustomer resources from Magnum to do so, he terminated all three men. The termination\n\noccurred on October 5, 2009.\n\n       {¶3}    After the termination, Magnum brought an eleven-count complaint against G.\n\nMink, J. Mink, Shupe, and FerroTrade for trade secret misappropriation, breach of the duty of\n\nloyalty, conversion, tortious interference with contractual relations, tortious interference with\n\nbusiness relations, raiding, commercial disparagement and defamation, inevitable disclosure,\n\npromissory estoppel, unjust enrichment, and civil conspiracy. The four defendants answered and\n\nbrought five counterclaims/cross-claims of their own against Magnum and Giorgi. All of the\n\ncounterclaims/cross-claims were resolved by either dismissal or summary judgment and are not\n\nat issue on appeal.\n\n       {¶4}    Upon the defendants’ motion, the trial court entered judgment on the pleadings in\n\nfavor of the defendants on Magnum’s claims for raiding and inevitable disclosure.             The\n\ndefendants also moved for summary judgment on seven of Magnum’s other claims, but the trial\n\ncourt denied their motion. Magnum’s remaining nine claims were then presented to a jury. At\n\nthe conclusion of trial, the court granted a directed verdict in the defendants’ favor on Magnum’s\n\nclaims for conversion and commercial disparagement and defamation. The jury received the\n\nremaining seven counts. Of importance to this appeal, the jury found: (1) G. Mink liable for\n\n$219,355.07 on the tortious interference with contractual relations count; (2) G. Mink liable for\n\n$0 on the tortious interference with business relations count; (3) G. Mink liable for $115,926.51\n\non the promissory estoppel count; and (4) G. Mink liable for $0 on the unjust enrichment count.\n\f                                                 3\n\n\nThe jury also awarded Magnum $110,000 in punitive damages with regard to G. Mink on the\n\ncount for tortious interference with contractual relations and found that Magnum was entitled to\n\nan award of attorney fees.\n\n       {¶5}    Subsequently, both parties filed motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict\n\n(“JNOV”). Magnum also sought prejudgment interest on its promissory estoppel claim and\n\nattorney fees. The trial court denied the JNOV motions and Magnum’s request for prejudgment\n\ninterest, but ultimately awarded Magnum $66,036.50 in attorney fees. On February 14, 2012, the\n\ntrial court entered judgment in accordance with the jury’s verdicts.\n\n       {¶6}    After one attempted appeal resulted in a dismissal for lack of a final, appealable\n\norder, two more appeals were filed. The first appeal (Appeal No. 26127) was filed by G. Mink\n\nand Jeffrey Shupe. The second appeal (Appeal No. 26231) was only filed by G. Mink. Magnum\n\nfiled cross-appeals under both case numbers. This Court eventually consolidated the two appeals\n\nfor decision and named G. Mink and Shupe as the appellants/cross-appellees and Magnum as the\n\nappellee/cross-appellant. On January 25, 2013, the firm representing G. Mink and Shupe,\n\nRoderick Linton Belfance, LLP, filed a motion to withdraw as counsel for Shupe. The motion to\n\nwithdraw indicates that, before Appeal No. 26231 was filed, Shupe terminated the firm’s\n\nservices and notified the firm that he did not want it to pursue an appeal on his behalf.\n\nConsequently, the firm only filed Appeal No. 26231 on G. Mink’s behalf and filed the briefs in\n\nAppeal Nos. 26127 and 26231 on behalf of G. Mink alone. The certificate of service on the\n\nfirm’s motion to withdraw indicates that Shupe was served with a copy of the motion.\n\n       {¶7}    Shupe has not filed any briefs on appeal. He also never indicated to this Court\n\nthat he wished to pursue his appellate rights in either Appeal No. 26127 or Appeal No. 26231.\n\nConsequently, with regard to Appeal No. 26127, this Court dismisses the appeal solely as it\n\f                                                 4\n\n\nrelates to Shupe. See App.R. 18(C). Appeal No. 26127 remains as an appeal taken by G. Mink\n\nalone. With regard to Appeal No. 26231, Shupe remains designated as a cross-appellee; albeit\n\none who has not filed a responsive brief. See id. Roderick Linton Belfance, LLP’s motion to\n\nwithdraw as counsel for Shupe is granted.\n\n       {¶8}    G. Mink’s appeal and Magnum’s cross-appeal are now before this Court for\n\nreview. For ease of analysis, we consolidate several of the assignments of error.\n\n                                                 II\n\n                          G. Mink’s Assignment of Error Number One\n\n       THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DENIED DEFENDANTS’ MOTION\n       FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON PLAINTIFF’S CLAIM FOR TORTIOUS\n       INTERFERENCE WITH CONTRACTS.\n\n                          G. Mink’s Assignment of Error Number Two\n\n       THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DENIED DEFENDANTS’ MOTION\n       FOR DIRECTED VERDICT AND THE MOTION FOR JUDGMENT\n       NOTWITHSTANDING THE VERDICT ON PLAINTIFF’S CLAIM FOR\n       TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH CONTRACTS.\n\n                          G. Mink’s Assignment of Error Number Three\n\n       THE JURY VERDICT ON THE INTENTIONAL INTERFERENCE WITH\n       CONTRACT CLAIM IS AGAINST THE MANIFEST WEIGHT OF THE\n       EVIDENCE.\n\n       {¶9}    In his first three assignments of error, G. Mink argues that Magnum ought not to\n\nhave prevailed on its claim for tortious interference with contractual relations. He argues that the\n\ntrial court erred by denying his motion for summary judgment on the claim as well as his\n\nmotions for directed verdict and JNOV. Further, he argues that the jury’s verdict on the claim is\n\nagainst the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n       {¶10} “In order to recover for a claim of intentional interference with a contract, one\n\nmust prove (1) the existence of a contract, (2) the wrongdoer’s knowledge of the contract, (3) the\n\f                                                 5\n\n\nwrongdoer’s intentional procurement of the contract’s breach, (4) the lack of justification, and\n\n(5) resulting damages.” Kenty v. Transamerica Premium Ins. Co., 72 Ohio St.3d 415 (1995),\n\nparagraph two of the syllabus. “Tortious interference with a business relationship is similar but\n\noccurs when the result of the interference is not breach of contract, but that a third party does not\n\nenter into or continue a business relationship with the plaintiff.” Oliver v. Wagner, 9th Dist. No.\n\n2832-M, 1999 WL 1215131, *3 (Dec. 8, 1999). If no contract existed between the plaintiff and a\n\nthird party at the time when the defendant allegedly interfered, the plaintiff’s claim for\n\nintentional interference with a contract must fail as a matter of law. Egypt, Inc. v. Akron Bd. of\n\nEduc., 9th Dist. No. 14687, 1990 WL 209693, *2 (Dec. 19, 1990).\n\nMotion for Summary Judgment\n\n       {¶11} G. Mink first argues that the trial court erred by denying his motion for summary\n\njudgment. “[A]n error by the trial court in denying a motion for summary judgment is rendered\n\nharmless if a later trial on the merits involving the same issues demonstrates that there were\n\ngenuine issues of material fact and results in a judgment in favor of the party against whom the\n\nmotion was made.” Amore v. Ohio Turnpike Comm., 194 Ohio App.3d 182, 2011-Ohio-1903, ¶\n\n32 (9th Dist.). Magnum’s claim for tortious interference with contractual relations resulted in a\n\njury verdict in Magnum’s favor. Therefore, “[t]his Court, without determining whether the trial\n\ncourt committed any error in denying [G. Mink’s] motion for summary judgment, need only\n\ndetermine whether genuine issues of fact were raised at trial.” First Merit Bank, N.A. v. Wilson,\n\n9th Dist. No. 23363, 2007-Ohio-3239, ¶ 24. As explained below, genuine issues of material fact\n\nexisted for trial. Accordingly, any error by the trial court in denying G. Mink’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment was harmless. G. Mink’s first assignment of error is overruled.\n\f                                                 6\n\n\nDirected Verdict / Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict\n\n       {¶12} “An appellate court reviews a trial court’s ruling on a motion for a directed\n\nverdict de novo, as it presents an appellate court with a question of law. A motion for a directed\n\nverdict assesses the sufficiency of the evidence, not the weight of the evidence or the credibility\n\nof the witnesses.” (Internal citations omitted.) Jarvis v. Stone, 9th Dist. No. 23904, 2008-Ohio-\n\n3313, ¶ 7. See also Civ.R. 50(A). After a court enters judgment on a jury’s verdict, a party may\n\nfile a JNOV to have the judgment set aside on grounds other than the weight of the evidence.\n\nSee Civ.R. 50(B). As with an appeal from a court’s ruling on a directed verdict, this Court\n\nreviews a trial court’s grant or denial of a JNOV de novo. Williams v. Spitzer Auto World\n\nAmherst, Inc., 9th Dist. No. 07CA009098, 2008-Ohio-1467, ¶ 9. “JNOV is proper if upon\n\nviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party and presuming any doubt\n\nto favor the nonmoving party reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion, that being in\n\nfavor of the moving party.” Id. at ¶ 9, citing Civ.R. 50(B). If reasonable minds could reach\n\ndifferent conclusions, the motion must be denied. Garcea v. Woodhull, 9th Dist. No. 01CA0069,\n\n2002-Ohio-2437, ¶ 10.\n\n       {¶13} Magnum sought damages against G. Mink on its claim for tortious interference\n\nwith contractual relations based on G. Mink’s actions towards ten specific Magnum customers.\n\nThose ten customers were: Beaver Valley Slag, Beckett Gas, Spirol International, Machine Tek\n\nSystems, Inc., Stock Equipment Company, Clinton Aluminum & Stainless Steel, National\n\nMachine, Cleveland Steel Container, U.S. Gypsum, and Ohio Star Forge (“OSF”). According to\n\nG. Mink, he was entitled to a directed verdict/JNOV because Magnum failed to set forth\n\nsufficient evidence that it had a contract with any of the foregoing customers at the time that G.\n\nMink allegedly caused the customers to breach.\n\f                                               7\n\n\n       {¶14} Although Magnum did business with all ten of the foregoing customers when it\n\nterminated G. Mink, Giorgi admitted at trial that Magnum did not have a contract with Beaver\n\nValley Slag, Machine Tek Systems, Inc., or Stock Equipment Company. As to Beckett Gas and\n\nSpirol International, Giorgi testified that he did not know if Magnum had a contract with those\n\ncompanies. Representatives from those companies later testified, however, that their companies\n\ndid not have long-term contracts with Magnum. Wayne Walker from Beckett Gas and Brett\n\nWaller from Spirol International both testified that their companies only had month-to-month\n\narrangements with Magnum.\n\n       {¶15} Giorgi did not testify as to the specific arrangements between Magnum and\n\nNational Machine, Cleveland Steel Container, or Clinton Aluminum & Stainless Steel, but stated\n\nthat both National Machine and Cleveland Steel Container left Magnum several months after G.\n\nMink’s termination to do business with G. Mink’s company, FerroTrade. As to U.S. Gypsum\n\nand OSF, Giorgi specifically testified that Magnum had a written contract with both companies.\n\nU.S. Gypsum stayed with Magnum until the expiration of its contract and signed a contract with\n\nFerroTrade only after soliciting bids. OSF signed a contract with FerroTrade on October 6,\n\n2009, the day after Magnum terminated G. Mink.\n\n       {¶16} Magnum terminated G. Mink on October 5, 2009. Magnum’s owner, Paolo\n\nGiorgi, testified that he decided to terminate G. Mink after he discovered that G. Mink had been\n\ncontacting Magnum’s customers and that “documentation [had been] destroyed or taken away.”\n\nMike Coiner, a former Magnum employee who Giorgi rehired in mid-October, testified that\n\nwhen he returned to Magnum and looked through its customer files, he “could not find most of\n\nthe material” for Magnum’s customers, including its contracts. One particular contract Magnum\n\ncould not find was its contract with Greer Steel; a contract G. Mink admitted that he had kept in\n\f                                                 8\n\n\nhis desk. According to G. Mink, he removed information from his office at Magnum before he\n\nwas terminated, but all of the information he took was personal in nature.\n\n       {¶17} Brian Ray, a vice president with PNC Bank (fka National City Bank), testified\n\nthat he met with G. Mink in September 2009 regarding a line of credit for G. Mink’s new\n\ncompany. At the meeting, G. Mink told Ray that he was ready to break from Magnum and gave\n\nRay a list of companies that had already agreed to do business with him at his new company.\n\nOne of the companies he listed was OSF. G. Mink also told Ray that “the only contracts that\n\n[were] currently in place with customers [were] contracts with [him] directly, not with\n\n[Magnum].”\n\n       {¶18} The only copy of a written contract between Magnum and OSF that Magnum was\n\nable to produce at trial was a five-year contract that had expired on March 31, 2009. Giorgi\n\ntestified that in 2007, G. Mink happily approached him and told him that he had played golf with\n\nOSF’s president, Jeffrey Downing, and they “just renewed the contract for another seven years.”\n\nG. Mink specified that rather than signing an entirely new contract, the two agreed to simply\n\nwrite in a new date on the existing contract and initial the change.\n\n       {¶19} Downing testified at trial by way of deposition. Downing testified that he met\n\nwith G. Mink before his termination from Magnum. At that meeting, G. Mink told Downing he\n\nwas forming a new company and he wanted OSF to do business with his new company.\n\nDowning stated that he told G. Mink OSF was under contract with Magnum, but G. Mink\n\ninsisted that the contract had expired in March. Downing testified that he committed OSF “[i]n\n\nprinciple” at the meeting. Downing then later signed a contract with FerroTrade on October 6,\n\n2009. G. Mink testified that he typed up the contract at home the night before he and Downing\n\nsigned it. At trial, Magnum introduced copies of its expired contract with OSF and the new\n\f                                                9\n\n\ncontract that G. Mink drafted. Both contracts contained virtually the same provisions and\n\nformatting. Additionally, the new contract contained two handwritten provisions. G. Mink\n\ntestified that Downing wanted two changes to the contract he had prepared so, rather than type a\n\nnew contract, the two simply wrote in the changes and initialed them.\n\n       {¶20} G. Mink argues that the trial court erred by denying his motions for directed\n\nverdict/JNOV because he never caused any customer with whom Magnum had a contract to\n\nbreach that contract. According to G. Mink, Magnum failed to set forth any evidence that it had\n\na contract with eight of the ten customers that formed the basis of its claim. As to the ninth\n\ncustomer, U.S. Gypsum, G. Mink argues that Magnum failed to prove that he procured a breach\n\nof its contract with Magnum because the evidence was such that U.S. Gypsum waited for its\n\ncontract to expire before soliciting bids and ultimately signing a contract with FerroTrade. As to\n\nthe tenth customer, OSF, he argues that Magnum set forth insufficient evidence that it had an\n\nexisting contract with that company.\n\n       {¶21} Viewing all of the evidence in a light most favorable to Magnum, we cannot\n\nconclude that the trial court erred by denying G. Mink’s motions for directed verdict/JNOV.\n\nMagnum introduced evidence that G. Mink kept Magnum’s customer contracts in his desk\n\nduring his employment and, after his termination, Magnum was unable to locate all the materials\n\nfor its customers, including its customer contracts. It also introduced representations that G.\n\nMink made when he sought a line of credit for his new company, including the representation\n\nthat OSF had agreed to do business with him. Interestingly, G. Mink did not tell the bank that\n\nMagnum did not have any contracts with its customers. Instead, he told the bank that the\n\ncustomer contracts that were currently in place were contracts with him directly, not with\n\nMagnum.\n\f                                                10\n\n\n       {¶22} Even assuming that G. Mink is correct that Magnum failed to set forth sufficient\n\nevidence that it (1) had a contract and that (2) G. Mink caused a breach of that contract with\n\nregard to nine of the ten customers at issue, the same cannot be said about OSF. Giorgi testified\n\nthat in 2007 G. Mink told him he had “just renewed the [OSF] contract for another seven years.”\n\nHe specified that he and OSF’s president, Jeffrey Downing, had agreed to change the year on the\n\nexisting original contract by writing in the change and initialing it. Magnum was never able to\n\nfind its original contract with OSF; it only ever found a copy of it. Moreover, the new contract\n\nbetween OSF and FerroTrade that G. Mink created the night he was terminated contained\n\nvirtually the same provisions and formatting as the copy of Magnum’s expired contract with OSF\n\n(which, with the exception of an initialed portion extending the expiration date, would have been\n\nidentical to the original contract Magnum could not find). The new contract also contained a few\n\nadditional provisions that G. Mink and Downing had simply handwritten and initialed; the same\n\nmechanism G. Mink allegedly told Giorgi that he and Downing had agreed to use to update\n\nOSF’s contract with Magnum.\n\n       {¶23} G. Mink argues on appeal that Giorgi’s testimony did not suffice to prove the\n\nexistence of a contract because, at most, it merely supported that OSF and Magnum had an\n\n“agreement to agree,” which would be unenforceable under the statute of frauds. G. Mink,\n\nhowever, never made the foregoing arguments in his motions for directed verdict/JNOV. “When\n\nreviewing arguments on appeal, this Court cannot consider issues that are raised for the first time\n\non appeal.” Carnegie Cos., Inc. v. Summit Properties, Inc., 9th Dist. No. 25622, 2012-Ohio-\n\n1324, ¶ 8, quoting Harris v. Akron, 9th Dist. No. 24499, 2009-Ohio-3865, ¶ 9. Because G. Mink\n\ndid not raise his agreement to agree or statute of frauds arguments in the court below, this Court\n\nwill not address them on appeal.\n\f                                                 11\n\n\n       {¶24} Although Magnum could not produce a copy of a renewed written contract with\n\nOSF, that fact alone was not fatal to Magnum’s claim. See Akron Group Servs., Inc. v. Patron\n\nPlastics, Inc., 9th Dist. No. 22507, 2005-Ohio-5101, ¶ 24 (question of fact regarding existence of\n\ncontract where written contract could not be produced, but testimony supported its existence).\n\nSee also Campbell Oil Co. v. Shepperson, 7th Dist. No. 05 CA 817, 2006-Ohio-1763, ¶ 27 (“[I]t\n\nis possible to establish the existence and content of a lost or destroyed contract through\n\nsecondary evidence.”).    Given all the evidence in the record, this Court cannot say that\n\n“reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion,” on Magnum’s claim for tortious\n\ninterference with contractual relations. Williams, 2008-Ohio-1467, at ¶ 9. As such, the trial\n\ncourt did not err by denying G. Mink’s motions for directed verdict/JNOV. G. Mink’s second\n\nassignment of error is overruled.\n\nManifest Weight\n\n       {¶25} In his third assignment of error, G. Mink challenges the weight of the evidence as\n\nto both the jury’s verdict and the jury’s damage award. As to the verdict, G. Mink argues that\n\nthe jury lost its way because the evidence at trial supported the conclusion that Magnum and\n\nOSF did not have a contract that extended past March 31, 2009. As to the damage award, G.\n\nMink argues that Magnum failed to produce any competent evidence from which the jury could\n\nhave reasonably calculated the amount of damages to award Magnum for the purported loss of\n\nOSF as a customer.\n\n       {¶26} In a challenge to the weight of the evidence,\n\n       [t]he [reviewing] court * * * weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences,\n       considers the credibility of witnesses and determines whether in resolving\n       conflicts in the evidence, the [finder of fact] clearly lost its way and created such a\n       manifest miscarriage of justice that the [judgment] must be reversed and a new\n       trial ordered.\n\f                                                12\n\n\n(Alterations sic.) Eastley v. Volkman, 132 Ohio St.3d 328, 2012-Ohio-2179, ¶ 20, quoting State\n\nv. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387 (1997). “Manifest weight challenges the burden of\n\npersuasion.” Stocker v. Stocker, 9th Dist. No. 12CA0021, 2012-Ohio-5821, ¶ 26. “In weighing\n\nthe evidence, the court of appeals must always be mindful of the presumption in favor of the\n\nfinder of fact.” Eastley at ¶ 21.\n\n       {¶27} Both G. Mink and Downing testified at trial that Magnum and OSF did not have\n\na contract that extended past March 31, 2009. Giorgi testified, however, that G. Mink told him\n\nin 2007 that he had renewed Magnum’s contract with OSF for another seven years.\n\nAccordingly, Giorgi testified it was his understanding that Magnum and OSF had a contract\n\nthrough 2014. As previously set forth, Magnum was unable to produce its original contract with\n\nOSF, but Magnum’s theory at trial was that G. Mink took the original contract from Magnum\n\nbefore he was terminated. There was testimony that G. Mink kept Magnum’s customer contracts\n\nin his desk and that, after his termination, Magnum could not find all of its customer information,\n\nincluding contracts.\n\n       {¶28} In further support of its trial theory, Magnum presented testimony about a non-\n\ncompete agreement that Shupe signed as part of his employment agreement when Magnum hired\n\nhim. Shupe admitted that he signed a non-compete agreement, but Magnum was unable to\n\nproduce it at trial because it was not a part of Shupe’s personnel file. Anna Hardy, Magnum’s\n\nController, testified that G. Mink approached her in July or August of 2009 and asked her to turn\n\nover certain personnel files, including Shupe’s, so that he could note some type of incident that\n\nhad occurred. Hardy testified that G. Mink returned the files a few days later and said that he\n\nhad not had the time to put notes in the files after all. G. Mink admitted at trial that he shredded\n\nShupe’s non-compete agreement without consulting Giorgi. According to G. Mink, however, he\n\f                                                 13\n\n\nshredded the agreement within seven to ten days of Shupe’s signing it in August 2006, not much\n\nlater in July or August 2009.\n\n       {¶29} Based on our review of the record, we cannot conclude that the jury lost its way\n\nby finding that Magnum had a contract with OSF and that G. Mink tortiously interfered with it.\n\n“[T]he trier of fact was in the best position to evaluate the credibility of witnesses, and this Court\n\nwill not overturn the [jury’s] verdict on a manifest weight of the evidence challenge simply\n\nbecause the [jury] chose to believe certain witnesses’ testimony over the testimony of others.”\n\nState v. Watts, 9th Dist. No. 12CA0005, 2012-Ohio-5822, ¶ 18. Here, the jury simply chose to\n\nbelieve Magnum’s version of the events. G. Mink’s argument that the jury’s verdict is against\n\nthe manifest weight of the evidence lacks merit.\n\n       {¶30} G. Mink also argues that the jury’s damage award is against the manifest weight\n\nof the evidence because Magnum failed to “produce any competent evidence whatsoever” of\n\nMagnum’s loss of profits with regard to OSF. (Emphasis omitted.) According to G. Mink,\n\nMagnum only presented a calculation of lost profits as to all ten customers that left it to do\n\nbusiness with G. Mink’s company. Thus, G. Mink argues, Magnum failed to prove its future lost\n\nprofits with regard to OSF alone such that the jury could calculate its damages.\n\n       {¶31} To the extent G. Mink argues that Magnum failed to produce any competent\n\nevidence in support of a damage award, that argument is not an appropriate manifest weight\n\nargument. Manifest weight tests the burden of persuasion, not the burden of production. See\n\nEastley, 132 Ohio St.3d 328, 2012-Ohio-2179, at ¶ 17-19. Both Magnum and G. Mink presented\n\nexpert testimony on Magnum’s damages.           Magnum’s expert opined that Magnum suffered\n\ndamages as a result of the departure of G. Mink, J. Mink, and Shupe and explained to the jury\n\nhow he calculated Magnum’s damages. He provided the jury with a total monthly gross profits\n\f                                              14\n\n\nloss for Magnum as well as the individual components for each company comprising that total.\n\nMeanwhile, G. Mink’s expert opined that Magnum’s expert’s report was deficient for a variety\n\nof reasons and that Magnum’s damages, if any, could only be calculated with respect to OSF (the\n\nonly customer of the ten with whom Magnum allegedly had a contract). As to OSF, G. Mink’s\n\nexpert opined that Magnum did not suffer any damages.\n\n       {¶32} “In Ohio, it has long been held that the assessment of damages is so thoroughly\n\nwithin the province of the jury that a reviewing court is not at liberty to disturb the jury’s\n\nassessment absent an affirmative finding of passion and prejudice or a finding that the award is\n\nmanifestly excessive.” Moskovitz v. Mt. Sinai Med. Ctr., 69 Ohio St.3d 638, 655 (1994).\n\nAlthough Magnum’s expert projected that Magnum would incur a $1,027,665 loss over a ten\n\nyear period as a result of G. Mink, J. Mink, and Shupe’s actions, the jury only awarded Magnum\n\n$219,355.07 on its claim for tortious interference with contractual relations. G. Mink has not\n\nexplained why that award was the result of passion or prejudice or manifestly excessive given\n\nMagnum’s expert’s testimony. Having reviewed the record, we cannot conclude that the damage\n\naward is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Therefore, G. Mink’s third assignment of\n\nerror is overruled.\n\n                          G. Mink’s Assignment of Error Number Four\n\n       THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN OVERRULING\n       DEFENDANTS’ OBJECTIONS TO PLAINTIFF’S SPECULATIVE EXPERT\n       TESTIMONY CONCERNING FUTURE LOST PROFITS.\n\n       {¶33} In his fourth assignment of error, G. Mink argues that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion by allowing Magnum’s expert to testify with regard to the projected future profits\n\nMagnum lost as a result of G. Mink’s having tortiously interfered with Magnum’s contractual\n\nrelations. We disagree.\n\f                                                 15\n\n\n       {¶34} Initially, we note that G. Mink does not argue that Magnum’s expert was not\n\nqualified to testify or that his testimony failed to satisfy Evid.R. 702. Instead, he argues that the\n\ncourt should have excluded the expert’s future damage projections because they were purely\n\nspeculative, did not conform to the evidence, and did not provide the jury with any reasonably\n\ncertain basis for awarding damages. See Circuit Solutions, Inc. v. Mueller Elec. Co., 9th Dist.\n\nNo. 05CA008775, 2006-Ohio-4321, ¶ 7 (“The amount and existence of lost profits must be\n\nestablished with reasonable certainty.”). We, therefore, limit our review to G. Mink’s specific\n\nargument.\n\n       {¶35} “The admission or exclusion of expert testimony lies in the sound discretion of\n\nthe trial court and will, therefore, not be overturned absent an abuse of that discretion.” State v.\n\nBekelesky, 9th Dist. No. 24976, 2010-Ohio-2198, ¶ 6. An abuse of discretion implies that the\n\ntrial court’s attitude was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5\n\nOhio St.3d 217, 219 (1983). When reviewing for an abuse of discretion, an appellate court may\n\nnot merely substitute its judgment for that of the trial court. Pons v. Ohio State Med. Bd., 66\n\nOhio St.3d 619, 621 (1993).\n\n       {¶36} Robert Ranallo, a CPA, certified valuation analyst, and accredited business\n\nvaluator, testified on behalf of Magnum. Ranallo testified that he has been projecting business\n\ndamages for various companies since 1995 and previously has both consulted and testified as an\n\nexpert in valuation cases involving the scrap steel industry. In analyzing Magnum’s case,\n\nRanallo reviewed several years’ worth of Magnum’s financial documents, including its monthly\n\nprofit reports, income statements, and the expense reports from the trading division. Ranallo\n\nalso reviewed FerroTrade’s projected sales and projected gross profit margin, as reported by G.\n\nMink in the mission statement that he created for his company.                  Moreover, Ranallo\n\f                                                16\n\n\nindependently researched the scrap steel market to gain background information about its activity\n\nand volatility.\n\n        {¶37} Using all of the information he gathered, Ranallo testified that he used the sales\n\nprojection method to arrive at a damages measurement for Magnum. Ranallo used the actual\n\nmonth-to-month figures Magnum had for each of the ten customers at issue, averaged each over\n\ndifferent measuring periods, selected a specific three-month measuring period representative of\n\nthe averages he performed, and factored in the industry analysis that he performed. Ranallo\n\ntestified that he then arrived at a total monthly gross profit loss for Magnum of $38,150 for the\n\nten customers at issue, but also included the “individual components on a company-by-company\n\nbasis that [made] up that total.” Ranallo also performed a ten-year projection of Magnum’s\n\nlosses, deducting variable expenses and considering both costs and the time value of money.\n\nRanallo testified that he organized the ten-year projection into one-year periods of time (with an\n\nestimated monetary amount for each year) so that the jury would have a future profits calculation\n\nfor each year in the future up to ten years. Ranallo testified that he did not include in his\n\nprojections the possibility that customers might leave Magnum of their own accord because it\n\nwould be speculative to address potential causes of the loss of customers.\n\n        {¶38} Having reviewed the record and Ranallo’s specific testimony, we cannot conclude\n\nthat the trial court abused its discretion by allowing Ranallo to testify about Magnum’s future\n\nlost profits. Ranallo explained his calculation method in detail for the jury and provided the jury\n\nwith information about total losses as well as losses on a customer-by-customer basis. He also\n\ndid not simply provide the jury with a ten-year projection. In addition to giving the jury\n\ninformation about Magnum’s monthly loss, he gave the jury a projected damage amount per year\n\nfor a period of ten years. Therefore, the jury had the option of awarding any number of years’\n\f                                              17\n\n\nworth of damages up to and including ten years. The record does not support G. Mink’s\n\nargument that Ranallo’s testimony was purely speculative or divorced from the actual evidence\n\nintroduced at trial.\n\n        {¶39} Ranallo based his projections on multiple sources, including Magnum’s historical\n\nfinancial data over a period of several years and his own independent research about the scrap\n\nsteel market. The record supports the trial court’s decision to allow Ranallo’s testimony as an\n\naid to the jury in arriving at a damage award for Magnum’s lost profits. G. Mink’s argument that\n\nthe trial court should have excluded Ranallo’s testimony lacks merit. Consequently, his fourth\n\nassignment of error is overruled.\n\n                          Magnum’s Assignment of Error Number One\n\n        THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING MAGNUM’S MOTION FOR\n        JNOV ON MAGNUM’S CLAIM OF UNJUST ENRICHMENT AGAINST MR.\n        MINK.\n\n        {¶40} In its first assignment of error, Magnum argues that the trial court erred by\n\ndenying its motion for JNOV with regard to its claim for unjust enrichment. We disagree.\n\n        {¶41} This Court reiterates the standard of review for an appeal from the denial of a\n\nmotion for JNOV. As with an appeal from a court’s ruling on a directed verdict, this Court\n\nreviews a trial court’s grant or denial of a JNOV de novo. Williams, 2008-Ohio-1467, at ¶ 9.\n\n“JNOV is proper if upon viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party\n\nand presuming any doubt to favor the nonmoving party reasonable minds could come to but one\n\nconclusion, that being in favor of the moving party.” Id. at ¶ 9, citing Civ.R. 50(B). If\n\nreasonable minds could reach different conclusions, the motion must be denied. Garcea, 2002-\n\nOhio-2437, at ¶ 10.\n\f                                               18\n\n\n       {¶42} Magnum brought suit against G. Mink for both promissory estoppel and unjust\n\nenrichment. “To succeed on a promissory estoppel claim, a party must show (1) a clear and\n\nunambiguous promise; (2) reliance on that promise; (3) reliance that was reasonable and\n\nforeseeable; and (4) damages caused by that reliance.” Current Source, Inc. v. Elyria City\n\nSchool Dist., 157 Ohio App.3d 765, 2004-Ohio-3422, ¶ 31 (9th Dist.). “A successful claim of\n\nunjust enrichment requires that: (1) a benefit has been conferred by a plaintiff upon a defendant;\n\n(2) the defendant had knowledge of the benefit; and (3) the defendant retained the benefit under\n\ncircumstances where it would be unjust to do so without payment.” Chef Italiano v. Crucible\n\nDev. Corp., 9th Dist. No. 22415, 2005-Ohio-4254, ¶ 26. Unjust enrichment occurs when a\n\nperson “has and retains money or benefits which in justice and equity belong to another.” Bldg.\n\nIndustry Consultants, Inc. v. 3M Parkway, Inc., 182 Ohio App.3d 39, 2009-Ohio-1910, ¶ 16 (9th\n\nDist.), quoting Hummel v. Hummel, 133 Ohio St. 520, 528 (1938).\n\n       {¶43} The jury found G. Mink liable for both promissory estoppel and unjust\n\nenrichment. Whereas the jury awarded Magnum $115,926.51 on its promissory estoppel claim,\n\nhowever, the jury did not award Magnum any damages on its unjust enrichment claim. Magnum\n\nargues that it was entitled to a $33,717.82 award on its unjust enrichment claim because the\n\nparties stipulated that Magnum reimbursed G. Mink for unauthorized business expenses in that\n\namount during his tenure with the company.\n\n       {¶44}    Initially, we note that Magnum’s argument is essentially that its damage award\n\nwas inadequate. This Court previously has stated that “[s]uch an argument is not appropriate on\n\na motion for [JNOV] because Civ.R. 50(B) provides the means to challenge the jury’s verdict,\n\nnot the jury’s award of damages.” Jemson v. Falls Village Retirement Community, Ltd., 9th Dist.\n\nNo. 20845, 2002-Ohio-4155, ¶ 17. Accord Desai v. Franklin, 177 Ohio App.3d 679, 2008-Ohio-\n\f                                                19\n\n\n3957, ¶ 25 (9th Dist.). Instead, Civ.R. 59 provides litigants with an avenue to challenge damage\n\nawards in the form of a motion for a new trial. See Civ.R. 59(A)(4). Magnum never filed a\n\nmotion for a new trial, so we question whether, under Jemson, Magnum preserved its argument\n\nfor appeal. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that we have considered an appeal from the denial of\n\na motion for JNOV where the appellant sought an increased damage award on the basis that the\n\nparties had stipulated to damages. See Kane v. O’Day, 9th Dist. No. 23225, 2007-Ohio-702, ¶\n\n23-25. Because we conclude that the trial court properly denied Magnum’s motion for JNOV,\n\nwe merely note the issue at this time and assume for purposes of our analysis that Magnum’s\n\nargument is properly before us.\n\n       {¶45} G. Mink testified that Magnum routinely reimbursed him for the business\n\nexpenses that he reported while working there. He admitted that Magnum had reimbursed him\n\nfor certain expenses he reported that were not authorized expenses. He testified that he had\n\nreviewed his expense reports from December 2004 to August 2009 and determined that Magnum\n\nhad reimbursed him for $23,717.82 in unauthorized expenses. Moreover, he agreed that total\n\ncould be $5,000 to $10,000 higher because he was sure there were more unauthorized expenses\n\nthat he missed when reviewing his expense reports for trial. The parties later stipulated that “the\n\nadditional sums that were listed as business expenses * * * that were not actual business\n\nexpenses were somewhere between $5,000 and $10,000 worth.”\n\n       {¶46} According to Magnum, the trial court erred by denying its motion for JNOV\n\nbecause the parties stipulated to damages in the amount of $33,717.82 should the jury find G.\n\nMink liable for unjust enrichment. See, e.g., Kane, 2007-Ohio-702, at ¶ 23-25 (court erred by\n\ndenying JNOV where parties had stipulated to the amount of damages in the event the jury found\n\nthe defendant liable). We do not agree that the parties stipulated to $33,717.82 in damages. G.\n\f                                               20\n\n\nMink identified $23,717.82 in unauthorized expenses.          The parties then stipulated that\n\n“somewhere between $5,000 and $10,000 worth” of additional unauthorized expenses existed.\n\nThere was no stipulation that the damage amount was, in fact, $33,717.82.\n\n       {¶47} G. Mink argues that a zero dollar award was the appropriate measure of damages\n\non Magnum’s unjust enrichment claim because that claim and Magnum’s promissory estoppel\n\nclaim were alternative theories for relief. G. Mink avers that any additional damages awarded on\n\nMagnum’s unjust enrichment claim would result in a double recovery because Magnum\n\nrecovered on its promissory estoppel claim. According to Magnum, its unjust enrichment claim\n\ndiffered from its promissory estoppel claim because its unjust enrichment claim sought\n\nrepayment for G. Mink’s unauthorized business expenses while its promissory estoppel claim\n\nsought repayment for the deficit the trading division accrued during G. Mink’s last year with the\n\ncompany. For purposes of context, we set out the evidence that supports Magnum’s construction\n\nof its promissory estoppel claim.\n\n       {¶48} G. Mink testified that he approached Giorgi in August 2008 about adopting a new\n\ncompensation structure for the traders. Giorgi adopted G. Mink’s proposal and agreed to a\n\nsliding scale percentage structure. Under the new structure, the higher the amount of revenue the\n\ntraders earned, the higher the percentage of that revenue the traders would receive as\n\ncommission. As part of the new structure, however, G. Mink agreed that all of the expenses\n\nattributable to the trading division each month, including the traders’ salaries, would first be\n\ndeducted from the revenues they earned. Any commission, therefore, equaled the revenue,\n\nminus the expenses, times the percentage rate that applied. By way of example, G. Mink agreed\n\nthat if the traders brought in $100,000 for the month and had $50,000 in expenses, they would\n\f                                                 21\n\n\nreceive $10,000 in commission because a 20% commission rate applied in that instance\n\n($100,000 revenue - $50,000 expenses X 20% commission rate = $10,000).\n\n       {¶49} G. Mink agreed that the new compensation structure almost immediately resulted\n\nin a deficit balance because the price of scrap declined dramatically and the trading division did\n\nnot have enough revenue to cover its expenses. He further agreed that, as of the end of\n\nSeptember 2009, the deficit balance amounted to $115,926.51. According to Giorgi, Magnum\n\nallowed the deficit to build in the manner that it did because G. Mink gave Giorgi several\n\nassurances that he would personally pay the deficit if the scrap market did not recover. The jury\n\nawarded Magnum $115,926.51 on its promissory estoppel claim; the exact amount of the deficit\n\nowed at the time of G. Mink’s termination.\n\n       {¶50} Even if evidence would theoretically support a claim or defense, a court’s ruling\n\non a motion for JNOV must necessarily be constrained by the actual claims or defenses that were\n\npresented to the jury. See Glenmoore Builders, Inc. v. Smith Family Trust, 9th Dist. No. 24299,\n\n2009-Ohio-3174, ¶ 40, 46-47 (denial of JNOV affirmed when litigant failed to submit a statute of\n\nfrauds defense to the jury through jury instructions and did not challenge the court’s instruction\n\nthat the parties had agreed there was a contract). On appeal, Magnum asserts that it was entitled\n\nto damages for both its promissory estoppel and unjust enrichment claims because they were\n\nseparate and distinct. Having reviewed the record, however, we cannot agree that Magnum\n\nmade that distinction for the jury.\n\n       {¶51} In instructing the jury on promissory estoppel, the court instructed:\n\n       Magnum claims that defendant [G.] Mink promised Magnum that in exchange for\n       advanced funds, he would procure customers and business for Magnum.\n       Magnum claims that it relied upon this promise and Mr. Mink should be bound\n       even if no contract was made between them.\n\nIn instructing the jury on unjust enrichment, the court instructed:\n\f                                                22\n\n\n       Magnum claims that it is entitled to recover the reasonable value of funds it\n       advanced to [G.] Mink in exchange for his promise to procure customers and\n       business for the benefit of Magnum.\n\nAlthough the court also instructed the jury on the elements of promissory estoppel and unjust\n\nenrichment, the foregoing instructions for the claims did not differ in any meaningful way. Both\n\nsought the return of funds that Magnum advanced to G. Mink and neither identified those\n\nspecific funds. Similarly, the interrogatories given to the jury did not link any specific funds to\n\nthe two claims. The interrogatories only asked the jury whether Magnum proved each claim by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence and, if so, the amount of money Magnum was entitled to recover\n\non its respective claims.\n\n       {¶52} Perhaps most telling is the response that the jury was given on one of the\n\nquestions it submitted during deliberation. The jury’s question was:\n\n       Is promissory estoppel and/or unjust enrichment referring to the $23,000-33,000\n       of expenses being sought after? If not, what do they mean?\n\nThe answer provided to the jury was:\n\n       The promissory estoppel and unjust enrichment claims relate only to defendant\n       [G.] Mink and they deal with the compensation deficit and expense report\n       contentions.\n\nAccordingly, the jury was not told that one claim encompassed the deficit while the other\n\nencompassed the unauthorized business expenses. Rather, the jury was told that both claims\n\nencompassed both the deficit and the expenses. Magnum did not object to any of the jury\n\ninstructions or interrogatories given or take issue with the answer provided to the jury in\n\nresponse to the jury’s question.\n\n       {¶53} The record supports the conclusion that Magnum presented the jury with\n\nalternative theories for relief and the jury only intended to award Magnum $115,926.51.\n\f                                               23\n\n\nTherefore, the trial court did not err by denying Magnum’s motion for JNOV. Magnum’s first\n\nassignment of error is overruled.\n\n                             Magnum’s Assignment of Error Number Two\n\n       THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING MAGNUM’S MOTION FOR\n       PREJUDGMENT INTEREST ON MAGNUM’S PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL\n       CLAIM.\n\n       {¶54} In its second assignment of error, Magnum argues that the trial court erred by\n\ndenying its motion for prejudgment interest on the $115,926.51 award it received on its claim for\n\npromissory estoppel.

Moreover, although unjust enrichment is also only a quasi-contractual claim,\n\nthis Court has concluded that prejudgment interest under R.C. 1343.03(A) is available on a claim\n\nfor unjust enrichment. See Desai at ¶ 32; Zeck at ¶ 43-47. We see no reason to distinguish\n\nbetween a claim of promissory estoppel and a claim of unjust enrichment for purposes of R.C.\n\n1343.03(A)’s application. Therefore, we conclude that a party who prevails on a claim of\n\npromissory estoppel may seek a prejudgment interest award under R.C. 1343.03(A).\n\n       {¶58} The trial court determined that Magnum was not entitled to prejudgment interest\n\nbecause G. Mink had a good faith basis to contest liability for the deficit that resulted after he\n\nand Giorgi agreed to a new compensation structure. It further noted that G. Mink had offered a\n\nsix-figure settlement, “which was largely the result of the deficit,” but that Magnum had rejected\n\nhis offer. The court did not offer any additional rationale for denying Magnum’s motion.\n\n       {¶59} While a request for prejudgment interest under R.C. 1343.03(C) requires\n\nconsideration of a party’s good faith efforts to settle a case, a request under R.C. 1343.03(A)\n\ndoes not.

Mink had a good faith basis to contest liability and made a good faith settlement\n\noffer. Magnum prevailed on its promissory estoppel claim, so it was entitled to prejudgment\n\ninterest. The only question is the amount of prejudgment interest to which Magnum was\n\nentitled.   Because the start date of Magnum’s prejudgment interest period is a matter of\n\ndiscretion for the trial court, this Court will not make that determination in the first instance. See\n\nBCI v. DeRycke, 9th Dist. No. 21459, 2003-Ohio-6321, ¶ 20.

In their fee request, Magnum’s attorneys sought fees in the\n\namount of $398,881.41. The fee request included a copy of the billing invoice for all the work\n\nDunlap and Harris’ firm performed for Magnum as well as copies of the monthly invoices\n\nDunlap and Harris submitted to Magnum. The monthly invoices detail the hours expended by\n\neach person on specific days during the month. In reviewing the monthly invoices, the trial court\n\nreduced the total amount of fees Dunlap and Harris sought to $374,193.00. It is apparent from\n\nthe record that the court did so because the total billing invoice amount ($398,881.41) includes\n\ncharges for individuals apart from Dunlap and Harris. The monthly invoices reference those\n\nindividuals by name, but Magnum made no attempt to discuss those individuals at the attorney\n\nfee hearing. Moreover, Magnum has not argued on appeal that the trial court erred by reducing\n\nthe total fee amount requested from $398,881.41 to $374,193.00. Therefore, in performing our\n\nanalysis, we rely upon the $374,193.00 amount as the amount representing Magnum’s fee\n\nrequest.\n\n       {¶65}    Dunlap and Harris reported in their fee request that Dunlap expended 410.4\n\nhours’ worth of work representing Magnum and Harris expended 780.3 hours. At the fee\n\nhearing, Dunlap reported that his hourly rates were as follows: (1) $400 per hour in 2009; (2)\n\n$415 per hour in 2010; and (3) $425 per hour in 2011. Dunlap further reported Harris’ hourly\n\nrates as follows: (1) $230 per hour in 2009; (2) $250 per hour in 2010; and (3) $275 per hour in\n\n2011. There was testimony at the hearing that Dunlap had graduated from law school in 1989,\n\nhad worked in both Chicago and Cleveland, and had handled many cases similar to the one at\n\nissue in the past. Meanwhile, Harris had graduated from law school in 2005, had worked at his\n\ncurrent firm since graduating, and had been involved in a handful of trials.\n\f                                                 28\n\n\n          {¶66} Two experts testified at the fee hearing after the parties stipulated to their\n\nexpertise. Magnum’s expert, Ronald Kopp, testified that for the last 23-25 years he had focused\n\nhis practice on business litigation and that his personal hourly rate was $390 per hour. Kopp\n\ntestified that his fee was as high as any business litigator in the Akron area, but that he was aware\n\nof higher fees in the Northeast Ohio area in general. Kopp opined that both Dunlap and Harris\n\nhad charged reasonable fees. He further opined that the hours both attorneys had expended were\n\nreasonable given the complexity of the case, the litigation stakes, and their need to familiarize\n\nthemselves with both Magnum as a specific client and the scrap steel industry in general.\n\n          {¶67} G. Mink’s expert, Mark Bernlohr, testified that he had been practicing for 24\n\nyears, dealt primarily with litigation and commercial law, and personally charged an hourly rate\n\nbetween $175 and $250 an hour. Bernlohr admitted that his hourly rate was “[p]robably a little\n\nlow[,] but * * * acceptable in Summit County.” Bernlohr opined that both Dunlap and Harris\n\nhad charged an excessive hourly rate and that an hourly rate of $325 would be reasonable for an\n\nattorney with Dunlap’s experience while an hourly rate of $185 would be reasonable for an\n\nattorney with Harris’ experience. Bernlohr further opined that Dunlap and Harris expended too\n\nmany hours given the relatively straightforward nature of the case and various other factors.\n\nAccording to Bernlohr, it would have been reasonable for Dunlap to expend 350 hours on the\n\ncase (rather than 410.4 hours) and for Harris to expend 390 hours on the case (rather than 780.3\n\nhours).\n\n          {¶68} In addition to its judgment entry, the trial court issued an extremely detailed\n\nmemorandum of opinion regarding its award of attorney fees. The memorandum reflects that the\n\ntrial court relied extensively upon Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424 (1983), in reaching its\n\ndecision. In Hensley, the United States Supreme Court wrote that:\n\f                                                 29\n\n\n       The most useful starting point for determining the amount of a reasonable fee is\n       the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a\n       reasonable hourly rate.\n\nHensley at 433. The Supreme Court further wrote that a trial court may reduce the number of\n\nhours reported when the documentation for those hours is inadequate or the hours were not\n\nreasonably expended because they were “excessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary.” Id. at\n\n433-434.    Following Hensley, the trial court here began its analysis by reviewing the\n\nreasonableness of Dunlap’s and Harris’ hourly rates and the number of hours each expended.\n\n       {¶69} The trial court determined that although Dunlap’s hourly rate was “at the high end\n\nof the range of acceptable rates” for the locality, it was reasonable given his skill level. The\n\ncourt further determined that Dunlap had expended a reasonable number of hours. Therefore, as\n\na starting point, the court concluded that the initial estimate for Dunlap’s services amounted to\n\n$171,646 (410.4 hours X the $400-$425 rate in place for 2009, 2010, and 2011).\n\n       {¶70} As to Harris, the trial court determined that his hourly rate and the number of\n\nhours he expended were unreasonable. Specifically, the court determined that an hourly rate of\n\n$230-275 was excessive for a “four- to six-year attorney[] practicing in this jurisdiction.” The\n\ncourt agreed with G. Mink’s expert that $185 was a reasonable hourly rate for Harris and\n\nadjusted his rates accordingly.     As to the hours Harris expended, the court did not adopt\n\nBernlohr’s suggestion that Harris’ hours should be cut in half. Instead, the court reduced Harris’\n\nhours from 780.3 to 500 hours. The court reasoned that a reduction in hours was appropriate\n\nbecause the monthly invoices showed that Harris had expended more time than necessary on\n\nvarious tasks and had charged for performing work “that could have been performed by a\n\nparalegal or a legal secretary.” Therefore, as a starting point, the court concluded that the initial\n\nestimate for Harris’ services should have been $92,500 (500 hours X $185). Combining the\n\f                                                 30\n\n\ninitial estimates for Dunlap and Harris, the trial court determined that the initial estimate for the\n\nvalue of their services should have been $264,146.\n\n       {¶71} Magnum argues that the trial court abused its discretion by reducing the number\n\nof hours “charged by Mr. Dunlap and Mr. Harris.” The court, however, did not reduce Dunlap’s\n\nreported number of hours. The court agreed with the reasonableness of both Dunlap’s hourly\n\nrate and the number of hours he expended. The only reductions the trial court made were with\n\nregard to Harris.    With respect to those reductions, the court relied on Bernlohr’s expert\n\ntestimony as well as its own review of the monthly invoices.\n\n       {¶72} Bernlohr testified that Harris had only been in practice since 2005, was still an\n\nassociate with his firm, and had only tried a handful of cases. Specifically, Harris had appeared\n\nas second chair in three jury trials, including this case, and had acted as lead counsel in two to\n\nthree bench trials. Bernlohr researched those bench trials and found that they were small cases\n\ninvolving less than $10,000. Applying his expertise to Harris’ background, Bernlohr arrived at a\n\n$185 hour figure as a reasonable hourly rate for Harris’ services.\n\n       {¶73} As to the number of hours Harris expended, Bernlohr testified that the hours were\n\nexcessive for several reasons. First, the hours were excessive given that Harris and Dunlap had\n\nboth charged for repeated conferences they had with one another. Second, Bernlohr felt that it\n\nwas unreasonable for Harris to have billed “nearly three weeks, eight hours a day, getting ready\n\nfor a six-day trial.” Third, Bernlohr observed that some of the work Harris did could have been\n\nperformed by a law clerk or paralegal, but Harris “was basically doing everything.” Bernlohr\n\nultimately concluded that it would be appropriate to exclude half of Harris’ hours.\n\n       {¶74} Having reviewed the record, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion by reducing Harris’ hourly rate and the number of hours he expended. Bernlohr’s\n\f                                                 31\n\n\ntestimony supported the rate reduction. Moreover, although Bernlohr suggested reducing Harris’\n\nhours from 780.3 to 390 hours, the court only reduced Harris’ hours to 500 hours. The court\n\nspecified that it had conducted its own review of the monthly invoices and found a reduction\n\nappropriate because Harris’ hours were “excessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary.”\n\nHensley, 461 U.S. at 434. Magnum has not shown that the court’s initial estimation of the value\n\nof Dunlap and Harris’ services amounted to an abuse of discretion.\n\n       {¶75} Once the court arrived at an initial determination of $264,146 as the starting point\n\nfor the value of Dunlap and Harris’ legal services, the court then further reduced the fee award.\n\nAs the Supreme Court explained:\n\n       The product of reasonable hours times a reasonable rate does not end the inquiry.\n       There remain other considerations that may lead the [trial] court to adjust the fee\n       upward or downward, including the important factor of the “results obtained.”\n       This factor is particularly crucial where a plaintiff is deemed “prevailing” even\n       though he succeeded on only some of his claims for relief.\n\nId. “[W]ork on an unsuccessful claim cannot be deemed to have been expended in pursuit of the\n\nultimate result achieved.” (Internal quotations and citations omitted.) Id. at 435. Additionally,\n\nif a party is only entitled to recover its attorney fees on a particular claim, the court must decide\n\nwhether to reduce the fee award to the fees attributable to that particular claim. “[T]he court may\n\naward fees for the total work performed if the prevailing party’s claims present ‘a common core\n\nof facts and related legal theories.’” Fleischer v. George, 9th Dist. No. 09CA0057-M, 2010-\n\nOhio-3941, ¶ 32, quoting Parker v. I & F Insulation Co., Inc., 1st Dist. No. C-960602, 1998 WL\n\n144510, *6 (Mar. 27, 1998). If, however, “the claims for which fees are allowable are distinct\n\nfrom claims for which fees are not awarded,” the court must separate the fees and award only\n\nthose fees that are allowable. Fleischer at ¶ 32. “[T]he fee applicant bears the burden of\n\f                                                32\n\n\nestablishing entitlement to an award and documenting the appropriate hours expended and hourly\n\nrates.” Hensley, 461 U.S. at 437.\n\n       {¶76} In reaching its decision that Magnum’s fee award should be further reduced, the\n\ncourt considered both the results Dunlap and Harris obtained for their client and the number of\n\nsuccessful claims for which fees were awardable. Magnum brought a total of 11 claims against\n\nthe defendants in this case. Four claims were eliminated by virtue of either a judgment on the\n\npleadings or a directed verdict and two claims resulted in a verdict in favor of the defendants. Of\n\nthe five remaining claims, Magnum did not prevail against J. Mink or FerroTrade at all.\n\nMagnum’s compensatory damages were limited to: (1) a $30,000 verdict against G. Mink and\n\nShupe on its trade secret misappropriation claim; (2) a $219,355.07 verdict against G. Mink on\n\nits claim for tortious interference with contractual relations; and (3) a $115,926.51 verdict\n\nagainst G. Mink on its promissory estoppel claim.\n\n       {¶77} Magnum’s entitlement to attorney fees in this case arose strictly from the jury’s\n\ndetermination that G. Mink was liable for punitive damages. The jury, however, only found G.\n\nMink liable for punitive damages on one of its claims; the claim for tortious interference with\n\ncontractual relations. As to that claim, the jury awarded $219,355.07 in compensatory damages\n\nand $110,000 in punitive damages. The trial court noted that neither expert had been able to\n\ndetermine the number of billable hours that related to Magnum’s claim for tortious interference\n\nwith contractual relations because Dunlap and Harris had not reported their hours in that manner.\n\nBoth employed a block billing method and documented their hours in a generalized manner such\n\nthat it was not possible to segregate their work on a particular claim. Yet, the court noted that\n\nMagnum’s claims essentially fell within two categories: (1) those that arose from the allegations\n\nthat the defendants took confidential information, solicited business for themselves while still in\n\f                                                 33\n\n\nMagnum’s employ, and interfered with existing contracts and business relationships; and (2)\n\nthose that arose from G. Mink’s failure to pay the trading division’s deficit and his own\n\nunauthorized business expenses. The court further noted that the claim for which attorney fees\n\nwere eligible only fell within the first category of claims; a category that would include a\n\n$30,000 award on the trade secret misappropriation claim and a $219,355.07 award on the claim\n\nfor tortious interference with contractual relations.\n\n       {¶78} The trial court determined that Magnum had sought between $1.2 and $1.3\n\nmillion on its claim for tortious interference with contractual relations, but only had recovered\n\n$219,355.07. Similarly, Magnum had sought between $1.2 and $1.3 million on its trade secret\n\nmisappropriation claim, but only had recovered $30,000. As a result of those figures as well as\n\nthe outcome of all of the claims discussed above, the court found that Magnum enjoyed only\n\n“partial or limited success” in the litigation and that it was appropriate to reduce its fee award.\n\nThe court then determined that it was appropriate to reduce Magnum’s fee award by 75%, a\n\npercentage that Bernlohr testified would “approximate the amount by which the jury reduced the\n\ndamages sought on the tortious interference claim.”        Applying that reduction to its initial\n\nestimation of $264,146, then, the trial court awarded Magnum $66,036.50 in attorney fees.\n\n       {¶79} If a trial court determines that a fee award must be reduced it “may attempt to\n\nidentify specific hours that should be eliminated, or it may simply reduce the award to account\n\nfor the limited success. The court necessarily has discretion in making this equitable judgment.”\n\nHensley, 461 U.S. at 436-437.        The trial court here exercised its discretion and reduced\n\nMagnum’s award to account for its limited success. Having thoroughly reviewed the record, we\n\ncannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by awarding Magnum $66,036.50 in\n\nattorney fees. Magnum’s argument to the contrary lacks merit.\n\f                                                34\n\n\n       {¶80} Magnum’s brief also includes an argument that the trial court erred by denying\n\nMagnum’s request for $40,649.54 in expert witness fees. Expert fees, however, are distinct from\n\nattorney fees. Magnum’s captioned assignment of error only challenges the court’s attorney fee\n\naward. Magnum also has not explained why a punitive damage award would entitle it to its\n\nexpert fees. See Bryant v. Walt Sweeney Automotive, Inc., 1st Dist. Nos. C-010395 & C-010404,\n\n2002-Ohio-2577, ¶ 42 (“The Ohio Supreme Court has held that litigation expenses cannot be\n\ntaxed as costs, unless specifically provided for by statute.”); Younger v. Buckeye Local Sch.\n\nDist., 9th Dist. Nos. 2060 & 2065, 1992 WL 161163, *4 (July 8, 1992) (“A party’s expert\n\nwitness fee is not taxable as costs to be assessed to the losing party.”). We, therefore, will not\n\nentertain Magnum’s argument that the trial court erred by not awarding Magnum its expert\n\nwitness fees. Magnum’s third assignment of error is overruled.\n\n                                                III\n\n       {¶81} G. Mink’s assignments of error are overruled.

Additionally, Magnum appeals from the judgment on several\n\ngrounds. This Court affirms in part and reverses in part.\n\n                                                    I\n\n        {¶2}    For several years, Gerald Mink (“G. Mink”), Jarrod Mink (“J. Mink”), and Jeffrey\n\nShupe worked at Magnum as scrap steel traders.               G. Mink, in particular, had a lengthy\n\nrelationship with the company and its owner, Paolo Giorgi. In their role as traders, the three men\n\npurchased scrap steel from various companies and sold that same scrap steel to other companies.\n\nAlthough the steel industry fluctuated to some extent over the course of the years, a serious\n\nmarket decline occurred in the fall of 2008 and resulted in a loss of profits for the three traders.\n\nThe decline coincided with growing dissatisfaction among the three traders and eventually led\n\f                                                2\n\n\nthem to the decision to form their own company; a company later named FerroTrade Corporation\n\n(“FerroTrade”). When Giorgi discovered that G. Mink, J. Mink, and Shupe had formed their\n\nown company and, from what Giorgi understood, had taken confidential information and\n\ncustomer resources from Magnum to do so, he terminated all three men. The termination\n\noccurred on October 5, 2009.\n\n       {¶3}    After the termination, Magnum brought an eleven-count complaint against G.\n\nMink, J. Mink, Shupe, and FerroTrade for trade secret misappropriation, breach of the duty of\n\nloyalty, conversion, tortious interference with contractual relations, tortious interference with\n\nbusiness relations, raiding, commercial disparagement and defamation, inevitable disclosure,\n\npromissory estoppel, unjust enrichment, and civil conspiracy. The four defendants answered and\n\nbrought five counterclaims/cross-claims of their own against Magnum and Giorgi. All of the\n\ncounterclaims/cross-claims were resolved by either dismissal or summary judgment and are not\n\nat issue on appeal.\n\n       {¶4}    Upon the defendants’ motion, the trial court entered judgment on the pleadings in\n\nfavor of the defendants on Magnum’s claims for raiding and inevitable disclosure.             The\n\ndefendants also moved for summary judgment on seven of Magnum’s other claims, but the trial\n\ncourt denied their motion. Magnum’s remaining nine claims were then presented to a jury. At\n\nthe conclusion of trial, the court granted a directed verdict in the defendants’ favor on Magnum’s\n\nclaims for conversion and commercial disparagement and defamation. The jury received the\n\nremaining seven counts. Of importance to this appeal, the jury found: (1) G. Mink liable for\n\n$219,355.07 on the tortious interference with contractual relations count; (2) G. Mink liable for\n\n$0 on the tortious interference with business relations count; (3) G. Mink liable for $115,926.51\n\non the promissory estoppel count; and (4) G. Mink liable for $0 on the unjust enrichment count.\n\f                                                 3\n\n\nThe jury also awarded Magnum $110,000 in punitive damages with regard to G. Mink on the\n\ncount for tortious interference with contractual relations and found that Magnum was entitled to\n\nan award of attorney fees.\n\n       {¶5}    Subsequently, both parties filed motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict\n\n(“JNOV”). Magnum also sought prejudgment interest on its promissory estoppel claim and\n\nattorney fees. The trial court denied the JNOV motions and Magnum’s request for prejudgment\n\ninterest, but ultimately awarded Magnum $66,036.50 in attorney fees. On February 14, 2012, the\n\ntrial court entered judgment in accordance with the jury’s verdicts.\n\n       {¶6}    After one attempted appeal resulted in a dismissal for lack of a final, appealable\n\norder, two more appeals were filed. The first appeal (Appeal No. 26127) was filed by G. Mink\n\nand Jeffrey Shupe. The second appeal (Appeal No. 26231) was only filed by G. Mink. Magnum\n\nfiled cross-appeals under both case numbers. This Court eventually consolidated the two appeals\n\nfor decision and named G. Mink and Shupe as the appellants/cross-appellees and Magnum as the\n\nappellee/cross-appellant. On January 25, 2013, the firm representing G. Mink and Shupe,\n\nRoderick Linton Belfance, LLP, filed a motion to withdraw as counsel for Shupe. The motion to\n\nwithdraw indicates that, before Appeal No. 26231 was filed, Shupe terminated the firm’s\n\nservices and notified the firm that he did not want it to pursue an appeal on his behalf.\n\nConsequently, the firm only filed Appeal No. 26231 on G. Mink’s behalf and filed the briefs in\n\nAppeal Nos. 26127 and 26231 on behalf of G. Mink alone. The certificate of service on the\n\nfirm’s motion to withdraw indicates that Shupe was served with a copy of the motion.\n\n       {¶7}    Shupe has not filed any briefs on appeal. He also never indicated to this Court\n\nthat he wished to pursue his appellate rights in either Appeal No. 26127 or Appeal No. 26231.\n\nConsequently, with regard to Appeal No. 26127, this Court dismisses the appeal solely as it\n\f                                                 4\n\n\nrelates to Shupe. See App.R. 18(C). Appeal No. 26127 remains as an appeal taken by G. Mink\n\nalone. With regard to Appeal No. 26231, Shupe remains designated as a cross-appellee; albeit\n\none who has not filed a responsive brief. See id. Roderick Linton Belfance, LLP’s motion to\n\nwithdraw as counsel for Shupe is granted.\n\n       {¶8}    G. Mink’s appeal and Magnum’s cross-appeal are now before this Court for\n\nreview. For ease of analysis, we consolidate several of the assignments of error.\n\n                                                 II\n\n                          G. Mink’s Assignment of Error Number One\n\n       THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DENIED DEFENDANTS’ MOTION\n       FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON PLAINTIFF’S CLAIM FOR TORTIOUS\n       INTERFERENCE WITH CONTRACTS.\n\n                          G. Mink’s Assignment of Error Number Two\n\n       THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DENIED DEFENDANTS’ MOTION\n       FOR DIRECTED VERDICT AND THE MOTION FOR JUDGMENT\n       NOTWITHSTANDING THE VERDICT ON PLAINTIFF’S CLAIM FOR\n       TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH CONTRACTS.\n\n                          G. Mink’s Assignment of Error Number Three\n\n       THE JURY VERDICT ON THE INTENTIONAL INTERFERENCE WITH\n       CONTRACT CLAIM IS AGAINST THE MANIFEST WEIGHT OF THE\n       EVIDENCE.\n\n       {¶9}    In his first three assignments of error, G. Mink argues that Magnum ought not to\n\nhave prevailed on its claim for tortious interference with contractual relations. He argues that the\n\ntrial court erred by denying his motion for summary judgment on the claim as well as his\n\nmotions for directed verdict and JNOV. Further, he argues that the jury’s verdict on the claim is\n\nagainst the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n       {¶10} “In order to recover for a claim of intentional interference with a contract, one\n\nmust prove (1) the existence of a contract, (2) the wrongdoer’s knowledge of the contract, (3) the\n\f                                                 5\n\n\nwrongdoer’s intentional procurement of the contract’s breach, (4) the lack of justification, and\n\n(5) resulting damages.” Kenty v. Transamerica Premium Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995),\n\nparagraph two of the syllabus. “Tortious interference with a business relationship is similar but\n\noccurs when the result of the interference is not breach of contract, but that a third party does not\n\nenter into or continue a business relationship with the plaintiff.” Oliver v. Wagner, 9th Dist. No.\n\n2832-M, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1215131</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *3 (Dec. 8, 1999). If no contract existed between the plaintiff and a\n\nthird party at the time when the defendant allegedly interfered, the plaintiff’s claim for\n\nintentional interference with a contract must fail as a matter of law. Egypt, Inc. v. Akron Bd. of\n\nEduc., 9th Dist. No. 14687, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1990</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">209693</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *2 (Dec. 19, 1990).\n\nMotion for Summary Judgment\n\n       {¶11} G. Mink first argues that the trial court erred by denying his motion for summary\n\njudgment. “[A]n error by the trial court in denying a motion for summary judgment is rendered\n\nharmless if a later trial on the merits involving the same issues demonstrates that there were\n\ngenuine issues of material fact and results in a judgment in favor of the party against whom the\n\nmotion was made.” Amore v. Ohio Turnpike Comm., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">182</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2011-Ohio-1903, ¶\n\n32 (9th Dist.). Magnum’s claim for tortious interference with contractual relations resulted in a\n\njury verdict in Magnum’s favor. Therefore, “[t]his Court, without determining whether the trial\n\ncourt committed any error in denying [G. Mink’s] motion for summary judgment, need only\n\ndetermine whether genuine issues of fact were raised at trial.” First Merit Bank, N.A. v. Wilson,\n\n9th Dist. No. 23363, 2007-Ohio-3239, ¶ 24. As explained below, genuine issues of material fact\n\nexisted for trial. Accordingly, any error by the trial court in denying G. Mink’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment was harmless. G. Mink’s first assignment of error is overruled.\n\f                                                 6\n\n\nDirected Verdict / Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict\n\n       {¶12} “An appellate court reviews a trial court’s ruling on a motion for a directed\n\nverdict de novo, as it presents an appellate court with a question of law. A motion for a directed\n\nverdict assesses the sufficiency of the evidence, not the weight of the evidence or the credibility\n\nof the witnesses.” (Internal citations omitted.) Jarvis v. Stone, 9th Dist. No. 23904, 2008-Ohio-\n\n3313, ¶ 7. See also Civ.R. 50(A). After a court enters judgment on a jury’s verdict, a party may\n\nfile a JNOV to have the judgment set aside on grounds other than the weight of the evidence.\n\nSee Civ.R. 50(B). As with an appeal from a court’s ruling on a directed verdict, this Court\n\nreviews a trial court’s grant or denial of a JNOV de novo. Williams v. Spitzer Auto World\n\nAmherst, Inc., 9th Dist. No. 07CA009098, 2008-Ohio-1467, ¶ 9. “JNOV is proper if upon\n\nviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party and presuming any doubt\n\nto favor the nonmoving party reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion, that being in\n\nfavor of the moving party.” Id. at ¶ 9, citing Civ.R. 50(B). If reasonable minds could reach\n\ndifferent conclusions, the motion must be denied. Garcea v. Woodhull, 9th Dist. No. 01CA0069,\n\n2002-Ohio-2437, ¶ 10.\n\n       {¶13} Magnum sought damages against G. Mink on its claim for tortious interference\n\nwith contractual relations based on G. Mink’s actions towards ten specific Magnum customers.\n\nThose ten customers were: Beaver Valley Slag, Beckett Gas, Spirol International, Machine Tek\n\nSystems, Inc., Stock Equipment Company, Clinton Aluminum & Stainless Steel, National\n\nMachine, Cleveland Steel Container, U.S. Gypsum, and Ohio Star Forge (“OSF”). According to\n\nG. Mink, he was entitled to a directed verdict/JNOV because Magnum failed to set forth\n\nsufficient evidence that it had a contract with any of the foregoing customers at the time that G.\n\nMink allegedly caused the customers to breach.\n\f                                               7\n\n\n       {¶14} Although Magnum did business with all ten of the foregoing customers when it\n\nterminated G. Mink, Giorgi admitted at trial that Magnum did not have a contract with Beaver\n\nValley Slag, Machine Tek Systems, Inc., or Stock Equipment Company. As to Beckett Gas and\n\nSpirol International, Giorgi testified that he did not know if Magnum had a contract with those\n\ncompanies. Representatives from those companies later testified, however, that their companies\n\ndid not have long-term contracts with Magnum. Wayne Walker from Beckett Gas and Brett\n\nWaller from Spirol International both testified that their companies only had month-to-month\n\narrangements with Magnum.\n\n       {¶15} Giorgi did not testify as to the specific arrangements between Magnum and\n\nNational Machine, Cleveland Steel Container, or Clinton Aluminum & Stainless Steel, but stated\n\nthat both National Machine and Cleveland Steel Container left Magnum several months after G.\n\nMink’s termination to do business with G. Mink’s company, FerroTrade. As to U.S. Gypsum\n\nand OSF, Giorgi specifically testified that Magnum had a written contract with both companies.\n\nU.S. Gypsum stayed with Magnum until the expiration of its contract and signed a contract with\n\nFerroTrade only after soliciting bids. OSF signed a contract with FerroTrade on October 6,\n\n2009, the day after Magnum terminated G. Mink.\n\n       {¶16} Magnum terminated G. Mink on October 5, 2009. Magnum’s owner, Paolo\n\nGiorgi, testified that he decided to terminate G. Mink after he discovered that G. Mink had been\n\ncontacting Magnum’s customers and that “documentation [had been] destroyed or taken away.”\n\nMike Coiner, a former Magnum employee who Giorgi rehired in mid-October, testified that\n\nwhen he returned to Magnum and looked through its customer files, he “could not find most of\n\nthe material” for Magnum’s customers, including its contracts. One particular contract Magnum\n\ncould not find was its contract with Greer Steel; a contract G. Mink admitted that he had kept in\n\f                                                 8\n\n\nhis desk. According to G. Mink, he removed information from his office at Magnum before he\n\nwas terminated, but all of the information he took was personal in nature.\n\n       {¶17} Brian Ray, a vice president with PNC Bank (fka National City Bank), testified\n\nthat he met with G. Mink in September 2009 regarding a line of credit for G. Mink’s new\n\ncompany. At the meeting, G. Mink told Ray that he was ready to break from Magnum and gave\n\nRay a list of companies that had already agreed to do business with him at his new company.\n\nOne of the companies he listed was OSF. G. Mink also told Ray that “the only contracts that\n\n[were] currently in place with customers [were] contracts with [him] directly, not with\n\n[Magnum].”\n\n       {¶18} The only copy of a written contract between Magnum and OSF that Magnum was\n\nable to produce at trial was a five-year contract that had expired on March 31, 2009. Giorgi\n\ntestified that in 2007, G. Mink happily approached him and told him that he had played golf with\n\nOSF’s president, Jeffrey Downing, and they “just renewed the contract for another seven years.”\n\nG. Mink specified that rather than signing an entirely new contract, the two agreed to simply\n\nwrite in a new date on the existing contract and initial the change.\n\n       {¶19} Downing testified at trial by way of deposition. Downing testified that he met\n\nwith G. Mink before his termination from Magnum. At that meeting, G. Mink told Downing he\n\nwas forming a new company and he wanted OSF to do business with his new company.\n\nDowning stated that he told G. Mink OSF was under contract with Magnum, but G. Mink\n\ninsisted that the contract had expired in March. Downing testified that he committed OSF “[i]n\n\nprinciple” at the meeting. Downing then later signed a contract with FerroTrade on October 6,\n\n2009. G. Mink testified that he typed up the contract at home the night before he and Downing\n\nsigned it. At trial, Magnum introduced copies of its expired contract with OSF and the new\n\f                                                9\n\n\ncontract that G. Mink drafted. Both contracts contained virtually the same provisions and\n\nformatting. Additionally, the new contract contained two handwritten provisions. G. Mink\n\ntestified that Downing wanted two changes to the contract he had prepared so, rather than type a\n\nnew contract, the two simply wrote in the changes and initialed them.\n\n       {¶20} G. Mink argues that the trial court erred by denying his motions for directed\n\nverdict/JNOV because he never caused any customer with whom Magnum had a contract to\n\nbreach that contract. According to G. Mink, Magnum failed to set forth any evidence that it had\n\na contract with eight of the ten customers that formed the basis of its claim. As to the ninth\n\ncustomer, U.S. Gypsum, G. Mink argues that Magnum failed to prove that he procured a breach\n\nof its contract with Magnum because the evidence was such that U.S. Gypsum waited for its\n\ncontract to expire before soliciting bids and ultimately signing a contract with FerroTrade. As to\n\nthe tenth customer, OSF, he argues that Magnum set forth insufficient evidence that it had an\n\nexisting contract with that company.\n\n       {¶21} Viewing all of the evidence in a light most favorable to Magnum, we cannot\n\nconclude that the trial court erred by denying G. Mink’s motions for directed verdict/JNOV.\n\nMagnum introduced evidence that G. Mink kept Magnum’s customer contracts in his desk\n\nduring his employment and, after his termination, Magnum was unable to locate all the materials\n\nfor its customers, including its customer contracts. It also introduced representations that G.\n\nMink made when he sought a line of credit for his new company, including the representation\n\nthat OSF had agreed to do business with him. Interestingly, G. Mink did not tell the bank that\n\nMagnum did not have any contracts with its customers. Instead, he told the bank that the\n\ncustomer contracts that were currently in place were contracts with him directly, not with\n\nMagnum.\n\f                                                10\n\n\n       {¶22} Even assuming that G. Mink is correct that Magnum failed to set forth sufficient\n\nevidence that it (1) had a contract and that (2) G. Mink caused a breach of that contract with\n\nregard to nine of the ten customers at issue, the same cannot be said about OSF. Giorgi testified\n\nthat in 2007 G. Mink told him he had “just renewed the [OSF] contract for another seven years.”\n\nHe specified that he and OSF’s president, Jeffrey Downing, had agreed to change the year on the\n\nexisting original contract by writing in the change and initialing it. Magnum was never able to\n\nfind its original contract with OSF; it only ever found a copy of it. Moreover, the new contract\n\nbetween OSF and FerroTrade that G. Mink created the night he was terminated contained\n\nvirtually the same provisions and formatting as the copy of Magnum’s expired contract with OSF\n\n(which, with the exception of an initialed portion extending the expiration date, would have been\n\nidentical to the original contract Magnum could not find). The new contract also contained a few\n\nadditional provisions that G. Mink and Downing had simply handwritten and initialed; the same\n\nmechanism G. Mink allegedly told Giorgi that he and Downing had agreed to use to update\n\nOSF’s contract with Magnum.\n\n       {¶23} G. Mink argues on appeal that Giorgi’s testimony did not suffice to prove the\n\nexistence of a contract because, at most, it merely supported that OSF and Magnum had an\n\n“agreement to agree,” which would be unenforceable under the statute of frauds. G. Mink,\n\nhowever, never made the foregoing arguments in his motions for directed verdict/JNOV. “When\n\nreviewing arguments on appeal, this Court cannot consider issues that are raised for the first time\n\non appeal.” Carnegie Cos., Inc. v.

Mink\n\ndid not raise his agreement to agree or statute of frauds arguments in the court below, this Court\n\nwill not address them on appeal.\n\f                                                 11\n\n\n       {¶24} Although Magnum could not produce a copy of a renewed written contract with\n\nOSF, that fact alone was not fatal to Magnum’s claim. See Akron Group Servs., Inc. v. Patron\n\nPlastics, Inc., 9th Dist. No. 22507, 2005-Ohio-5101, ¶ 24 (question of fact regarding existence of\n\ncontract where written contract could not be produced, but testimony supported its existence).\n\nSee also Campbell Oil Co. v.

Given all the evidence in the record, this Court cannot say that\n\n“reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion,” on Magnum’s claim for tortious\n\ninterference with contractual relations. Williams, 2008-Ohio-1467, at ¶ 9. As such, the trial\n\ncourt did not err by denying G. Mink’s motions for directed verdict/JNOV. G. Mink’s second\n\nassignment of error is overruled.\n\nManifest Weight\n\n       {¶25} In his third assignment of error, G. Mink challenges the weight of the evidence as\n\nto both the jury’s verdict and the jury’s damage award. As to the verdict, G. Mink argues that\n\nthe jury lost its way because the evidence at trial supported the conclusion that Magnum and\n\nOSF did not have a contract that extended past March 31, 2009. As to the damage award, G.\n\nMink argues that Magnum failed to produce any competent evidence from which the jury could\n\nhave reasonably calculated the amount of damages to award Magnum for the purported loss of\n\nOSF as a customer.\n\n       {¶26} In a challenge to the weight of the evidence,\n\n       [t]he [reviewing] court * * * weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences,\n       considers the credibility of witnesses and determines whether in resolving\n       conflicts in the evidence, the [finder of fact] clearly lost its way and created such a\n       manifest miscarriage of justice that the [judgment] must be reversed and a new\n       trial ordered.\n\f                                                12\n\n\n(Alterations sic.)

Mink and Downing testified at trial that Magnum and OSF did not have\n\na contract that extended past March 31, 2009. Giorgi testified, however, that G. Mink told him\n\nin 2007 that he had renewed Magnum’s contract with OSF for another seven years.\n\nAccordingly, Giorgi testified it was his understanding that Magnum and OSF had a contract\n\nthrough 2014. As previously set forth, Magnum was unable to produce its original contract with\n\nOSF, but Magnum’s theory at trial was that G. Mink took the original contract from Magnum\n\nbefore he was terminated. There was testimony that G. Mink kept Magnum’s customer contracts\n\nin his desk and that, after his termination, Magnum could not find all of its customer information,\n\nincluding contracts.\n\n       {¶28} In further support of its trial theory, Magnum presented testimony about a non-\n\ncompete agreement that Shupe signed as part of his employment agreement when Magnum hired\n\nhim. Shupe admitted that he signed a non-compete agreement, but Magnum was unable to\n\nproduce it at trial because it was not a part of Shupe’s personnel file. Anna Hardy, Magnum’s\n\nController, testified that G. Mink approached her in July or August of 2009 and asked her to turn\n\nover certain personnel files, including Shupe’s, so that he could note some type of incident that\n\nhad occurred. Hardy testified that G. Mink returned the files a few days later and said that he\n\nhad not had the time to put notes in the files after all. G. Mink admitted at trial that he shredded\n\nShupe’s non-compete agreement without consulting Giorgi. According to G. Mink, however, he\n\f                                                 13\n\n\nshredded the agreement within seven to ten days of Shupe’s signing it in August 2006, not much\n\nlater in July or August 2009.\n\n       {¶29} Based on our review of the record, we cannot conclude that the jury lost its way\n\nby finding that Magnum had a contract with OSF and that G. Mink tortiously interfered with it.\n\n“[T]he trier of fact was in the best position to evaluate the credibility of witnesses, and this Court\n\nwill not overturn the [jury’s] verdict on a manifest weight of the evidence challenge simply\n\nbecause the [jury] chose to believe certain witnesses’ testimony over the testimony of others.”\n\nState v. Watts, 9th Dist. No. 12CA0005, 2012-Ohio-5822, ¶ 18. Here, the jury simply chose to\n\nbelieve Magnum’s version of the events. G. Mink’s argument that the jury’s verdict is against\n\nthe manifest weight of the evidence lacks merit.\n\n       {¶30} G. Mink also argues that the jury’s damage award is against the manifest weight\n\nof the evidence because Magnum failed to “produce any competent evidence whatsoever” of\n\nMagnum’s loss of profits with regard to OSF. (Emphasis omitted.) According to G. Mink,\n\nMagnum only presented a calculation of lost profits as to all ten customers that left it to do\n\nbusiness with G. Mink’s company. Thus, G. Mink argues, Magnum failed to prove its future lost\n\nprofits with regard to OSF alone such that the jury could calculate its damages.\n\n       {¶31} To the extent G. Mink argues that Magnum failed to produce any competent\n\nevidence in support of a damage award, that argument is not an appropriate manifest weight\n\nargument. Manifest weight tests the burden of persuasion, not the burden of production. See\n\nEastley, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">328</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2012-Ohio-2179, at ¶ 17-19. Both Magnum and G. Mink presented\n\nexpert testimony on Magnum’s damages.           Magnum’s expert opined that Magnum suffered\n\ndamages as a result of the departure of G. Mink, J. Mink, and Shupe and explained to the jury\n\nhow he calculated Magnum’s damages. He provided the jury with a total monthly gross profits\n\f                                              14\n\n\nloss for Magnum as well as the individual components for each company comprising that total.\n\nMeanwhile, G. Mink’s expert opined that Magnum’s expert’s report was deficient for a variety\n\nof reasons and that Magnum’s damages, if any, could only be calculated with respect to OSF (the\n\nonly customer of the ten with whom Magnum allegedly had a contract). As to OSF, G. Mink’s\n\nexpert opined that Magnum did not suffer any damages.\n\n       {¶32} “In Ohio, it has long been held that the assessment of damages is so thoroughly\n\nwithin the province of the jury that a reviewing court is not at liberty to disturb the jury’s\n\nassessment absent an affirmative finding of passion and prejudice or a finding that the award is\n\nmanifestly excessive.” Moskovitz v. Mt. Sinai Med. Ctr., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">638</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 655 (1994).\n\nAlthough Magnum’s expert projected that Magnum would incur a $1,027,665 loss over a ten\n\nyear period as a result of G. Mink, J. Mink, and Shupe’s actions, the jury only awarded Magnum\n\n$219,355.07 on its claim for tortious interference with contractual relations. G. Mink has not\n\nexplained why that award was the result of passion or prejudice or manifestly excessive given\n\nMagnum’s expert’s testimony. Having reviewed the record, we cannot conclude that the damage\n\naward is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Therefore, G. Mink’s third assignment of\n\nerror is overruled.\n\n                          G. Mink’s Assignment of Error Number Four\n\n       THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN OVERRULING\n       DEFENDANTS’ OBJECTIONS TO PLAINTIFF’S SPECULATIVE EXPERT\n       TESTIMONY CONCERNING FUTURE LOST PROFITS.\n\n       {¶33} In his fourth assignment of error, G. Mink argues that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion by allowing Magnum’s expert to testify with regard to the projected future profits\n\nMagnum lost as a result of G. Mink’s having tortiously interfered with Magnum’s contractual\n\nrelations. We disagree.\n\f                                                 15\n\n\n       {¶34} Initially, we note that G. Mink does not argue that Magnum’s expert was not\n\nqualified to testify or that his testimony failed to satisfy Evid.R. 702. Instead, he argues that the\n\ncourt should have excluded the expert’s future damage projections because they were purely\n\nspeculative, did not conform to the evidence, and did not provide the jury with any reasonably\n\ncertain basis for awarding damages. See Circuit Solutions, Inc. v. Mueller Elec. Co., 9th Dist.\n\nNo. 05CA008775, 2006-Ohio-4321, ¶ 7 (“The amount and existence of lost profits must be\n\nestablished with reasonable certainty.”). We, therefore, limit our review to G. Mink’s specific\n\nargument.\n\n       {¶35} “The admission or exclusion of expert testimony lies in the sound discretion of\n\nthe trial court and will, therefore, not be overturned absent an abuse of that discretion.” State v.\n\nBekelesky, 9th Dist. No. 24976, 2010-Ohio-2198, ¶ 6. An abuse of discretion implies that the\n\ntrial court’s attitude was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. Blakemore v.

When reviewing for an abuse of discretion, an appellate court may\n\nnot merely substitute its judgment for that of the trial court. Pons v. Ohio State Med. Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 621 (1993).\n\n       {¶36} Robert Ranallo, a CPA, certified valuation analyst, and accredited business\n\nvaluator, testified on behalf of Magnum. Ranallo testified that he has been projecting business\n\ndamages for various companies since 1995 and previously has both consulted and testified as an\n\nexpert in valuation cases involving the scrap steel industry. In analyzing Magnum’s case,\n\nRanallo reviewed several years’ worth of Magnum’s financial documents, including its monthly\n\nprofit reports, income statements, and the expense reports from the trading division. Ranallo\n\nalso reviewed FerroTrade’s projected sales and projected gross profit margin, as reported by G.\n\nMink in the mission statement that he created for his company.                  Moreover, Ranallo\n\f                                                16\n\n\nindependently researched the scrap steel market to gain background information about its activity\n\nand volatility.\n\n        {¶37} Using all of the information he gathered, Ranallo testified that he used the sales\n\nprojection method to arrive at a damages measurement for Magnum. Ranallo used the actual\n\nmonth-to-month figures Magnum had for each of the ten customers at issue, averaged each over\n\ndifferent measuring periods, selected a specific three-month measuring period representative of\n\nthe averages he performed, and factored in the industry analysis that he performed. Ranallo\n\ntestified that he then arrived at a total monthly gross profit loss for Magnum of $38,150 for the\n\nten customers at issue, but also included the “individual components on a company-by-company\n\nbasis that [made] up that total.” Ranallo also performed a ten-year projection of Magnum’s\n\nlosses, deducting variable expenses and considering both costs and the time value of money.\n\nRanallo testified that he organized the ten-year projection into one-year periods of time (with an\n\nestimated monetary amount for each year) so that the jury would have a future profits calculation\n\nfor each year in the future up to ten years. Ranallo testified that he did not include in his\n\nprojections the possibility that customers might leave Magnum of their own accord because it\n\nwould be speculative to address potential causes of the loss of customers.\n\n        {¶38} Having reviewed the record and Ranallo’s specific testimony, we cannot conclude\n\nthat the trial court abused its discretion by allowing Ranallo to testify about Magnum’s future\n\nlost profits. Ranallo explained his calculation method in detail for the jury and provided the jury\n\nwith information about total losses as well as losses on a customer-by-customer basis. He also\n\ndid not simply provide the jury with a ten-year projection. In addition to giving the jury\n\ninformation about Magnum’s monthly loss, he gave the jury a projected damage amount per year\n\nfor a period of ten years. Therefore, the jury had the option of awarding any number of years’\n\f                                              17\n\n\nworth of damages up to and including ten years. The record does not support G. Mink’s\n\nargument that Ranallo’s testimony was purely speculative or divorced from the actual evidence\n\nintroduced at trial.\n\n        {¶39} Ranallo based his projections on multiple sources, including Magnum’s historical\n\nfinancial data over a period of several years and his own independent research about the scrap\n\nsteel market. The record supports the trial court’s decision to allow Ranallo’s testimony as an\n\naid to the jury in arriving at a damage award for Magnum’s lost profits. G. Mink’s argument that\n\nthe trial court should have excluded Ranallo’s testimony lacks merit. Consequently, his fourth\n\nassignment of error is overruled.\n\n                          Magnum’s Assignment of Error Number One\n\n        THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING MAGNUM’S MOTION FOR\n        JNOV ON MAGNUM’S CLAIM OF UNJUST ENRICHMENT AGAINST MR.\n        MINK.\n\n        {¶40} In its first assignment of error, Magnum argues that the trial court erred by\n\ndenying its motion for JNOV with regard to its claim for unjust enrichment. We disagree.\n\n        {¶41} This Court reiterates the standard of review for an appeal from the denial of a\n\nmotion for JNOV. As with an appeal from a court’s ruling on a directed verdict, this Court\n\nreviews a trial court’s grant or denial of a JNOV de novo. Williams, 2008-Ohio-1467, at ¶ 9.\n\n“JNOV is proper if upon viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party\n\nand presuming any doubt to favor the nonmoving party reasonable minds could come to but one\n\nconclusion, that being in favor of the moving party.” Id. at ¶ 9, citing Civ.R. 50(B). If\n\nreasonable minds could reach different conclusions, the motion must be denied.

Mink for both promissory estoppel and unjust\n\nenrichment. “To succeed on a promissory estoppel claim, a party must show (1) a clear and\n\nunambiguous promise; (2) reliance on that promise; (3) reliance that was reasonable and\n\nforeseeable; and (4) damages caused by that reliance.” Current Source, Inc. v.

Mink liable for both promissory estoppel and unjust\n\nenrichment. Whereas the jury awarded Magnum $115,926.51 on its promissory estoppel claim,\n\nhowever, the jury did not award Magnum any damages on its unjust enrichment claim. Magnum\n\nargues that it was entitled to a $33,717.82 award on its unjust enrichment claim because the\n\nparties stipulated that Magnum reimbursed G. Mink for unauthorized business expenses in that\n\namount during his tenure with the company.\n\n       {¶44}    Initially, we note that Magnum’s argument is essentially that its damage award\n\nwas inadequate. This Court previously has stated that “[s]uch an argument is not appropriate on\n\na motion for [JNOV] because Civ.R. 50(B) provides the means to challenge the jury’s verdict,\n\nnot the jury’s award of damages.” Jemson v.

Instead, Civ.R. 59 provides litigants with an avenue to challenge damage\n\nawards in the form of a motion for a new trial. See Civ.R. 59(A)(4). Magnum never filed a\n\nmotion for a new trial, so we question whether, under Jemson, Magnum preserved its argument\n\nfor appeal. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that we have considered an appeal from the denial of\n\na motion for JNOV where the appellant sought an increased damage award on the basis that the\n\nparties had stipulated to damages. See Kane v. O’Day, 9th Dist. No. 23225, 2007-Ohio-702, ¶\n\n23-25. Because we conclude that the trial court properly denied Magnum’s motion for JNOV,\n\nwe merely note the issue at this time and assume for purposes of our analysis that Magnum’s\n\nargument is properly before us.\n\n       {¶45} G. Mink testified that Magnum routinely reimbursed him for the business\n\nexpenses that he reported while working there. He admitted that Magnum had reimbursed him\n\nfor certain expenses he reported that were not authorized expenses. He testified that he had\n\nreviewed his expense reports from December 2004 to August 2009 and determined that Magnum\n\nhad reimbursed him for $23,717.82 in unauthorized expenses. Moreover, he agreed that total\n\ncould be $5,000 to $10,000 higher because he was sure there were more unauthorized expenses\n\nthat he missed when reviewing his expense reports for trial. The parties later stipulated that “the\n\nadditional sums that were listed as business expenses * * * that were not actual business\n\nexpenses were somewhere between $5,000 and $10,000 worth.”\n\n       {¶46} According to Magnum, the trial court erred by denying its motion for JNOV\n\nbecause the parties stipulated to damages in the amount of $33,717.82 should the jury find G.\n\nMink liable for unjust enrichment. See, e.g., Kane, 2007-Ohio-702, at ¶ 23-25 (court erred by\n\ndenying JNOV where parties had stipulated to the amount of damages in the event the jury found\n\nthe defendant liable). We do not agree that the parties stipulated to $33,717.82 in damages. G.\n\f                                               20\n\n\nMink identified $23,717.82 in unauthorized expenses.          The parties then stipulated that\n\n“somewhere between $5,000 and $10,000 worth” of additional unauthorized expenses existed.\n\nThere was no stipulation that the damage amount was, in fact, $33,717.82.\n\n       {¶47} G. Mink argues that a zero dollar award was the appropriate measure of damages\n\non Magnum’s unjust enrichment claim because that claim and Magnum’s promissory estoppel\n\nclaim were alternative theories for relief. G. Mink avers that any additional damages awarded on\n\nMagnum’s unjust enrichment claim would result in a double recovery because Magnum\n\nrecovered on its promissory estoppel claim. According to Magnum, its unjust enrichment claim\n\ndiffered from its promissory estoppel claim because its unjust enrichment claim sought\n\nrepayment for G. Mink’s unauthorized business expenses while its promissory estoppel claim\n\nsought repayment for the deficit the trading division accrued during G. Mink’s last year with the\n\ncompany. For purposes of context, we set out the evidence that supports Magnum’s construction\n\nof its promissory estoppel claim.\n\n       {¶48} G. Mink testified that he approached Giorgi in August 2008 about adopting a new\n\ncompensation structure for the traders. Giorgi adopted G. Mink’s proposal and agreed to a\n\nsliding scale percentage structure. Under the new structure, the higher the amount of revenue the\n\ntraders earned, the higher the percentage of that revenue the traders would receive as\n\ncommission. As part of the new structure, however, G. Mink agreed that all of the expenses\n\nattributable to the trading division each month, including the traders’ salaries, would first be\n\ndeducted from the revenues they earned. Any commission, therefore, equaled the revenue,\n\nminus the expenses, times the percentage rate that applied. By way of example, G. Mink agreed\n\nthat if the traders brought in $100,000 for the month and had $50,000 in expenses, they would\n\f                                                 21\n\n\nreceive $10,000 in commission because a 20% commission rate applied in that instance\n\n($100,000 revenue - $50,000 expenses X 20% commission rate = $10,000).\n\n       {¶49} G. Mink agreed that the new compensation structure almost immediately resulted\n\nin a deficit balance because the price of scrap declined dramatically and the trading division did\n\nnot have enough revenue to cover its expenses. He further agreed that, as of the end of\n\nSeptember 2009, the deficit balance amounted to $115,926.51. According to Giorgi, Magnum\n\nallowed the deficit to build in the manner that it did because G. Mink gave Giorgi several\n\nassurances that he would personally pay the deficit if the scrap market did not recover. The jury\n\nawarded Magnum $115,926.51 on its promissory estoppel claim; the exact amount of the deficit\n\nowed at the time of G. Mink’s termination.\n\n       {¶50} Even if evidence would theoretically support a claim or defense, a court’s ruling\n\non a motion for JNOV must necessarily be constrained by the actual claims or defenses that were\n\npresented to the jury. See Glenmoore Builders, Inc. v. Smith Family Trust, 9th Dist. No. 24299,\n\n2009-Ohio-3174, ¶ 40, 46-47 (denial of JNOV affirmed when litigant failed to submit a statute of\n\nfrauds defense to the jury through jury instructions and did not challenge the court’s instruction\n\nthat the parties had agreed there was a contract). On appeal, Magnum asserts that it was entitled\n\nto damages for both its promissory estoppel and unjust enrichment claims because they were\n\nseparate and distinct. Having reviewed the record, however, we cannot agree that Magnum\n\nmade that distinction for the jury.\n\n       {¶51} In instructing the jury on promissory estoppel, the court instructed:\n\n       Magnum claims that defendant [G.] Mink promised Magnum that in exchange for\n       advanced funds, he would procure customers and business for Magnum.\n       Magnum claims that it relied upon this promise and Mr. Mink should be bound\n       even if no contract was made between them.\n\nIn instructing the jury on unjust enrichment, the court instructed:\n\f                                                22\n\n\n       Magnum claims that it is entitled to recover the reasonable value of funds it\n       advanced to [G.] Mink in exchange for his promise to procure customers and\n       business for the benefit of Magnum.\n\nAlthough the court also instructed the jury on the elements of promissory estoppel and unjust\n\nenrichment, the foregoing instructions for the claims did not differ in any meaningful way. Both\n\nsought the return of funds that Magnum advanced to G. Mink and neither identified those\n\nspecific funds. Similarly, the interrogatories given to the jury did not link any specific funds to\n\nthe two claims. The interrogatories only asked the jury whether Magnum proved each claim by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence and, if so, the amount of money Magnum was entitled to recover\n\non its respective claims.\n\n       {¶52} Perhaps most telling is the response that the jury was given on one of the\n\nquestions it submitted during deliberation. The jury’s question was:\n\n       Is promissory estoppel and/or unjust enrichment referring to the $23,000-33,000\n       of expenses being sought after? If not, what do they mean?\n\nThe answer provided to the jury was:\n\n       The promissory estoppel and unjust enrichment claims relate only to defendant\n       [G.] Mink and they deal with the compensation deficit and expense report\n       contentions.\n\nAccordingly, the jury was not told that one claim encompassed the deficit while the other\n\nencompassed the unauthorized business expenses. Rather, the jury was told that both claims\n\nencompassed both the deficit and the expenses. Magnum did not object to any of the jury\n\ninstructions or interrogatories given or take issue with the answer provided to the jury in\n\nresponse to the jury’s question.\n\n       {¶53} The record supports the conclusion that Magnum presented the jury with\n\nalternative theories for relief and the jury only intended to award Magnum $115,926.51.\n\f                                               23\n\n\nTherefore, the trial court did not err by denying Magnum’s motion for JNOV. Magnum’s first\n\nassignment of error is overruled.\n\n                             Magnum’s Assignment of Error Number Two\n\n       THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING MAGNUM’S MOTION FOR\n       PREJUDGMENT INTEREST ON MAGNUM’S PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL\n       CLAIM.\n\n       {¶54} In its second assignment of error, Magnum argues that the trial court erred by\n\ndenying its motion for prejudgment interest on the $115,926.51 award it received on its claim for\n\npromissory estoppel. We agree.\n\n       {¶55} “R.C. 1343.03(A) establishes interest rates for both prejudgment and post-\n\njudgment interest in actions based on contract.” (Internal quotations and citations omitted.)\n\nRutledge v.

Moreover, although unjust enrichment is also only a quasi-contractual claim,\n\nthis Court has concluded that prejudgment interest under R.C. 1343.03(A) is available on a claim\n\nfor unjust enrichment. See Desai at ¶ 32; Zeck at ¶ 43-47. We see no reason to distinguish\n\nbetween a claim of promissory estoppel and a claim of unjust enrichment for purposes of R.C.\n\n1343.03(A)’s application. Therefore, we conclude that a party who prevails on a claim of\n\npromissory estoppel may seek a prejudgment interest award under R.C. 1343.03(A).\n\n       {¶58} The trial court determined that Magnum was not entitled to prejudgment interest\n\nbecause G. Mink had a good faith basis to contest liability for the deficit that resulted after he\n\nand Giorgi agreed to a new compensation structure. It further noted that G. Mink had offered a\n\nsix-figure settlement, “which was largely the result of the deficit,” but that Magnum had rejected\n\nhis offer. The court did not offer any additional rationale for denying Magnum’s motion.\n\n       {¶59} While a request for prejudgment interest under R.C. 1343.03(C) requires\n\nconsideration of a party’s good faith efforts to settle a case, a request under R.C. 1343.03(A)\n\ndoes not.

Mink had a good faith basis to contest liability and made a good faith settlement\n\noffer. Magnum prevailed on its promissory estoppel claim, so it was entitled to prejudgment\n\ninterest. The only question is the amount of prejudgment interest to which Magnum was\n\nentitled.   Because the start date of Magnum’s prejudgment interest period is a matter of\n\ndiscretion for the trial court, this Court will not make that determination in the first instance. See\n\nBCI v. DeRycke, 9th Dist. No. 21459, 2003-Ohio-6321, ¶ 20.

In their fee request, Magnum’s attorneys sought fees in the\n\namount of $398,881.41. The fee request included a copy of the billing invoice for all the work\n\nDunlap and Harris’ firm performed for Magnum as well as copies of the monthly invoices\n\nDunlap and Harris submitted to Magnum. The monthly invoices detail the hours expended by\n\neach person on specific days during the month. In reviewing the monthly invoices, the trial court\n\nreduced the total amount of fees Dunlap and Harris sought to $374,193.00. It is apparent from\n\nthe record that the court did so because the total billing invoice amount ($398,881.41) includes\n\ncharges for individuals apart from Dunlap and Harris. The monthly invoices reference those\n\nindividuals by name, but Magnum made no attempt to discuss those individuals at the attorney\n\nfee hearing. Moreover, Magnum has not argued on appeal that the trial court erred by reducing\n\nthe total fee amount requested from $398,881.41 to $374,193.00. Therefore, in performing our\n\nanalysis, we rely upon the $374,193.00 amount as the amount representing Magnum’s fee\n\nrequest.\n\n       {¶65}    Dunlap and Harris reported in their fee request that Dunlap expended 410.4\n\nhours’ worth of work representing Magnum and Harris expended 780.3 hours. At the fee\n\nhearing, Dunlap reported that his hourly rates were as follows: (1) $400 per hour in 2009; (2)\n\n$415 per hour in 2010; and (3) $425 per hour in 2011. Dunlap further reported Harris’ hourly\n\nrates as follows: (1) $230 per hour in 2009; (2) $250 per hour in 2010; and (3) $275 per hour in\n\n2011. There was testimony at the hearing that Dunlap had graduated from law school in 1989,\n\nhad worked in both Chicago and Cleveland, and had handled many cases similar to the one at\n\nissue in the past. Meanwhile, Harris had graduated from law school in 2005, had worked at his\n\ncurrent firm since graduating, and had been involved in a handful of trials.\n\f                                                 28\n\n\n          {¶66} Two experts testified at the fee hearing after the parties stipulated to their\n\nexpertise. Magnum’s expert, Ronald Kopp, testified that for the last 23-25 years he had focused\n\nhis practice on business litigation and that his personal hourly rate was $390 per hour. Kopp\n\ntestified that his fee was as high as any business litigator in the Akron area, but that he was aware\n\nof higher fees in the Northeast Ohio area in general. Kopp opined that both Dunlap and Harris\n\nhad charged reasonable fees. He further opined that the hours both attorneys had expended were\n\nreasonable given the complexity of the case, the litigation stakes, and their need to familiarize\n\nthemselves with both Magnum as a specific client and the scrap steel industry in general.\n\n          {¶67} G. Mink’s expert, Mark Bernlohr, testified that he had been practicing for 24\n\nyears, dealt primarily with litigation and commercial law, and personally charged an hourly rate\n\nbetween $175 and $250 an hour. Bernlohr admitted that his hourly rate was “[p]robably a little\n\nlow[,] but * * * acceptable in Summit County.” Bernlohr opined that both Dunlap and Harris\n\nhad charged an excessive hourly rate and that an hourly rate of $325 would be reasonable for an\n\nattorney with Dunlap’s experience while an hourly rate of $185 would be reasonable for an\n\nattorney with Harris’ experience. Bernlohr further opined that Dunlap and Harris expended too\n\nmany hours given the relatively straightforward nature of the case and various other factors.\n\nAccording to Bernlohr, it would have been reasonable for Dunlap to expend 350 hours on the\n\ncase (rather than 410.4 hours) and for Harris to expend 390 hours on the case (rather than 780.3\n\nhours).\n\n          {¶68} In addition to its judgment entry, the trial court issued an extremely detailed\n\nmemorandum of opinion regarding its award of attorney fees. The memorandum reflects that the\n\ntrial court relied extensively upon Hensley v. Eckerhart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110929\"><a href=\"/opinion/110929/hensley-v-eckerhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1983), in reaching its\n\ndecision. In Hensley, the United States Supreme Court wrote that:\n\f                                                 29\n\n\n       The most useful starting point for determining the amount of a reasonable fee is\n       the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a\n       reasonable hourly rate.\n\nHensley at 433. The Supreme Court further wrote that a trial court may reduce the number of\n\nhours reported when the documentation for those hours is inadequate or the hours were not\n\nreasonably expended because they were “excessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary.” Id. at\n\n433-434.    Following Hensley, the trial court here began its analysis by reviewing the\n\nreasonableness of Dunlap’s and Harris’ hourly rates and the number of hours each expended.\n\n       {¶69} The trial court determined that although Dunlap’s hourly rate was “at the high end\n\nof the range of acceptable rates” for the locality, it was reasonable given his skill level. The\n\ncourt further determined that Dunlap had expended a reasonable number of hours. Therefore, as\n\na starting point, the court concluded that the initial estimate for Dunlap’s services amounted to\n\n$171,646 (410.4 hours X the $400-$425 rate in place for 2009, 2010, and 2011).\n\n       {¶70} As to Harris, the trial court determined that his hourly rate and the number of\n\nhours he expended were unreasonable. Specifically, the court determined that an hourly rate of\n\n$230-275 was excessive for a “four- to six-year attorney[] practicing in this jurisdiction.” The\n\ncourt agreed with G. Mink’s expert that $185 was a reasonable hourly rate for Harris and\n\nadjusted his rates accordingly.     As to the hours Harris expended, the court did not adopt\n\nBernlohr’s suggestion that Harris’ hours should be cut in half. Instead, the court reduced Harris’\n\nhours from 780.3 to 500 hours. The court reasoned that a reduction in hours was appropriate\n\nbecause the monthly invoices showed that Harris had expended more time than necessary on\n\nvarious tasks and had charged for performing work “that could have been performed by a\n\nparalegal or a legal secretary.” Therefore, as a starting point, the court concluded that the initial\n\nestimate for Harris’ services should have been $92,500 (500 hours X $185). Combining the\n\f                                                 30\n\n\ninitial estimates for Dunlap and Harris, the trial court determined that the initial estimate for the\n\nvalue of their services should have been $264,146.\n\n       {¶71} Magnum argues that the trial court abused its discretion by reducing the number\n\nof hours “charged by Mr. Dunlap and Mr. Harris.” The court, however, did not reduce Dunlap’s\n\nreported number of hours. The court agreed with the reasonableness of both Dunlap’s hourly\n\nrate and the number of hours he expended. The only reductions the trial court made were with\n\nregard to Harris.    With respect to those reductions, the court relied on Bernlohr’s expert\n\ntestimony as well as its own review of the monthly invoices.\n\n       {¶72} Bernlohr testified that Harris had only been in practice since 2005, was still an\n\nassociate with his firm, and had only tried a handful of cases. Specifically, Harris had appeared\n\nas second chair in three jury trials, including this case, and had acted as lead counsel in two to\n\nthree bench trials. Bernlohr researched those bench trials and found that they were small cases\n\ninvolving less than $10,000. Applying his expertise to Harris’ background, Bernlohr arrived at a\n\n$185 hour figure as a reasonable hourly rate for Harris’ services.\n\n       {¶73} As to the number of hours Harris expended, Bernlohr testified that the hours were\n\nexcessive for several reasons. First, the hours were excessive given that Harris and Dunlap had\n\nboth charged for repeated conferences they had with one another. Second, Bernlohr felt that it\n\nwas unreasonable for Harris to have billed “nearly three weeks, eight hours a day, getting ready\n\nfor a six-day trial.” Third, Bernlohr observed that some of the work Harris did could have been\n\nperformed by a law clerk or paralegal, but Harris “was basically doing everything.” Bernlohr\n\nultimately concluded that it would be appropriate to exclude half of Harris’ hours.\n\n       {¶74} Having reviewed the record, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion by reducing Harris’ hourly rate and the number of hours he expended. Bernlohr’s\n\f                                                 31\n\n\ntestimony supported the rate reduction. Moreover, although Bernlohr suggested reducing Harris’\n\nhours from 780.3 to 390 hours, the court only reduced Harris’ hours to 500 hours. The court\n\nspecified that it had conducted its own review of the monthly invoices and found a reduction\n\nappropriate because Harris’ hours were “excessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary.”\n\nHensley, 461 U.S. at 434. Magnum has not shown that the court’s initial estimation of the value\n\nof Dunlap and Harris’ services amounted to an abuse of discretion.\n\n       {¶75} Once the court arrived at an initial determination of $264,146 as the starting point\n\nfor the value of Dunlap and Harris’ legal services, the court then further reduced the fee award.\n\nAs the Supreme Court explained:\n\n       The product of reasonable hours times a reasonable rate does not end the inquiry.\n       There remain other considerations that may lead the [trial] court to adjust the fee\n       upward or downward, including the important factor of the “results obtained.”\n       This factor is particularly crucial where a plaintiff is deemed “prevailing” even\n       though he succeeded on only some of his claims for relief.\n\nId. “[W]ork on an unsuccessful claim cannot be deemed to have been expended in pursuit of the\n\nultimate result achieved.” (Internal quotations and citations omitted.) Id. at 435. Additionally,\n\nif a party is only entitled to recover its attorney fees on a particular claim, the court must decide\n\nwhether to reduce the fee award to the fees attributable to that particular claim. “[T]he court may\n\naward fees for the total work performed if the prevailing party’s claims present ‘a common core\n\nof facts and related legal theories.’” Fleischer v. George, 9th Dist. No. 09CA0057-M, 2010-\n\nOhio-3941, ¶ 32, quoting Parker v. I & F Insulation Co., Inc., 1st Dist. No. C-960602, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">144510</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *6 (Mar. 27, 1998). If, however, “the claims for which fees are allowable are distinct\n\nfrom claims for which fees are not awarded,” the court must separate the fees and award only\n\nthose fees that are allowable. Fleischer at ¶ 32. “[T]he fee applicant bears the burden of\n\f                                                32\n\n\nestablishing entitlement to an award and documenting the appropriate hours expended and hourly\n\nrates.” Hensley, 461 U.S. at 437.\n\n       {¶76} In reaching its decision that Magnum’s fee award should be further reduced, the\n\ncourt considered both the results Dunlap and Harris obtained for their client and the number of\n\nsuccessful claims for which fees were awardable. Magnum brought a total of 11 claims against\n\nthe defendants in this case. Four claims were eliminated by virtue of either a judgment on the\n\npleadings or a directed verdict and two claims resulted in a verdict in favor of the defendants. Of\n\nthe five remaining claims, Magnum did not prevail against J. Mink or FerroTrade at all.\n\nMagnum’s compensatory damages were limited to: (1) a $30,000 verdict against G. Mink and\n\nShupe on its trade secret misappropriation claim; (2) a $219,355.07 verdict against G. Mink on\n\nits claim for tortious interference with contractual relations; and (3) a $115,926.51 verdict\n\nagainst G. Mink on its promissory estoppel claim.\n\n       {¶77} Magnum’s entitlement to attorney fees in this case arose strictly from the jury’s\n\ndetermination that G. Mink was liable for punitive damages. The jury, however, only found G.\n\nMink liable for punitive damages on one of its claims; the claim for tortious interference with\n\ncontractual relations. As to that claim, the jury awarded $219,355.07 in compensatory damages\n\nand $110,000 in punitive damages. The trial court noted that neither expert had been able to\n\ndetermine the number of billable hours that related to Magnum’s claim for tortious interference\n\nwith contractual relations because Dunlap and Harris had not reported their hours in that manner.\n\nBoth employed a block billing method and documented their hours in a generalized manner such\n\nthat it was not possible to segregate their work on a particular claim. Yet, the court noted that\n\nMagnum’s claims essentially fell within two categories: (1) those that arose from the allegations\n\nthat the defendants took confidential information, solicited business for themselves while still in\n\f                                                 33\n\n\nMagnum’s employ, and interfered with existing contracts and business relationships; and (2)\n\nthose that arose from G. Mink’s failure to pay the trading division’s deficit and his own\n\nunauthorized business expenses. The court further noted that the claim for which attorney fees\n\nwere eligible only fell within the first category of claims; a category that would include a\n\n$30,000 award on the trade secret misappropriation claim and a $219,355.07 award on the claim\n\nfor tortious interference with contractual relations.\n\n       {¶78} The trial court determined that Magnum had sought between $1.2 and $1.3\n\nmillion on its claim for tortious interference with contractual relations, but only had recovered\n\n$219,355.07. Similarly, Magnum had sought between $1.2 and $1.3 million on its trade secret\n\nmisappropriation claim, but only had recovered $30,000. As a result of those figures as well as\n\nthe outcome of all of the claims discussed above, the court found that Magnum enjoyed only\n\n“partial or limited success” in the litigation and that it was appropriate to reduce its fee award.\n\nThe court then determined that it was appropriate to reduce Magnum’s fee award by 75%, a\n\npercentage that Bernlohr testified would “approximate the amount by which the jury reduced the\n\ndamages sought on the tortious interference claim.”        Applying that reduction to its initial\n\nestimation of $264,146, then, the trial court awarded Magnum $66,036.50 in attorney fees.\n\n       {¶79} If a trial court determines that a fee award must be reduced it “may attempt to\n\nidentify specific hours that should be eliminated, or it may simply reduce the award to account\n\nfor the limited success. The court necessarily has discretion in making this equitable judgment.”\n\nHensley, 461 U.S. at 436-437.        The trial court here exercised its discretion and reduced\n\nMagnum’s award to account for its limited success. Having thoroughly reviewed the record, we\n\ncannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by awarding Magnum $66,036.50 in\n\nattorney fees. Magnum’s argument to the contrary lacks merit.\n\f                                                34\n\n\n       {¶80} Magnum’s brief also includes an argument that the trial court erred by denying\n\nMagnum’s request for $40,649.54 in expert witness fees. Expert fees, however, are distinct from\n\nattorney fees. Magnum’s captioned assignment of error only challenges the court’s attorney fee\n\naward. Magnum also has not explained why a punitive damage award would entitle it to its\n\nexpert fees. See Bryant v. Walt Sweeney Automotive, Inc., 1st Dist. Nos. C-010395 & C-010404,\n\n2002-Ohio-2577, ¶ 42 (“The Ohio Supreme Court has held that litigation expenses cannot be\n\ntaxed as costs, unless specifically provided for by statute.”); Younger v. Buckeye Local Sch.\n\nDist., 9th Dist. Nos. 2060 & 2065, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">161163</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *4 (July 8, 1992) (“A party’s expert\n\nwitness fee is not taxable as costs to be assessed to the losing party.”). We, therefore, will not\n\nentertain Magnum’s argument that the trial court erred by not awarding Magnum its expert\n\nwitness fees. Magnum’s third assignment of error is overruled.\n\n                                                III\n\n       {¶81} G. Mink’s assignments of error are overruled.            Magnum’s first and third\n\nassignments of error are overruled, and its second assignment of error is sustained for the reasons\n\nset forth above.
