This case involves important\n\nissues   that   arise   under    the    Eighth   Amendment   to   the   U.S.\n\nConstitution. We are asked to determine whether the district court\n\nerred in concluding that the Massachusetts Department of Correction\n\n(\"DOC\") has violated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the\n\nEighth Amendment by providing allegedly inadequate medical care to\n\nprisoner Michelle Kosilek (\"Kosilek\").           More precisely, we are\n\nfaced with the question whether the DOC's choice of a particular\n\nmedical treatment is constitutionally inadequate, such that the\n\ndistrict court acts within its power to issue an injunction\n\nrequiring provision of an alternative treatment -- a treatment\n\nwhich would give rise to new concerns related to safety and prison\n\nsecurity.\n\n            After carefully considering the community standard of\n\nmedical care, the adequacy of the provided treatment, and the valid\n\nsecurity concerns articulated by the DOC, we conclude that the\n\ndistrict court erred and that the care provided to Kosilek by the\n\nDOC does not violate the Eighth Amendment.          We therefore reverse\n\nthe district court's grant of injunctive relief, and we remand with\n\ninstructions to dismiss the case.\n\n                            I.    Background\n\n            This litigation has now spanned more than twenty years\n\nand produced several opinions of significant length.          See Kosilek\n\nv. Spencer, 889 F. Supp. 2d 190 (D. Mass. 2012) (\"Kosilek II\");\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fKosilek v. Maloney, 221 F. Supp. 2d 156 (D. Mass. 2002) (\"Kosilek\n\nI\").     In light of the expansive record, we recite here only the\n\nfacts necessary to clarify the issues on appeal.\n\nA.   Michelle Kosilek\n\n            Michelle Kosilek -- born in 1949 as Robert Kosilek -- is\n\nan anatomically male prisoner in her mid-sixties who suffers from\n\ngender identity disorder (\"GID\")1 and self-identifies as a female.\n\nIn 1992 Kosilek was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced\n\nto   a   term   of   life   imprisonment    without   parole    for   the   1990\n\nstrangulation of her then-wife, Cheryl McCaul, whose body was found\n\nabandoned in the backseat of a vehicle at a local shopping mall.\n\nSee Commonwealth v. Kosilek, 423 Mass. 449, 668 N.E.2d 808 (1996).\n\nWhile awaiting trial for McCaul's murder, Kosilek twice attempted\n\nto commit suicide.            She also once tied a string around her\n\ntesticles in an attempt at self-castration, but removed the string\n\nwhen it became painful.         Since 1994, Kosilek has been housed at\n\nMCI-Norfolk,     a   medium    security    male   prison   in   Massachusetts.\n\nThroughout the twenty-year duration of her incarceration at MCI-\n\nNorfolk, Kosilek has not attempted to harm herself.\n\n\n\n\n1\n   The term \"gender identity disorder\" has recently been replaced\nwith the term \"gender dysphoria\" in the medical community. See Am.\nPsychiatric            Ass'n,        Gender        Dysphoria,\nhttp://www.dsm5.org/documents/gender%20dysphoria%20fact%20sheet.pdf\n(last visited June 3, 2014). To maintain consistency with prior\nrelated litigation and evidence in the record, we continue to use\nthe term \"GID\" in this opinion.\n\n                                     -4-\n\fB.   Kosilek I\n\n           Kosilek first sued the DOC in 1992, alleging that its\n\nfailure to provide direct treatment for her GID was a violation of\n\nthe Eighth Amendment.     At that time, Kosilek was receiving only\n\n\"supportive therapy\" to cope with the distress caused by her GID.\n\nKosilek   initially   sought   both   damages   and   injunctive   relief\n\nrequiring the DOC to provide her with sex reassignment surgery\n\n(\"SRS\"), although only her claim for injunctive relief survived to\n\ntrial.\n\n           The district court issued a decision in 2002, in which it\n\nconcluded that Kosilek had proven the existence of a serious\n\nmedical need and had shown that her then-current treatment plan was\n\ninadequate. The court concluded, however, that the DOC was unaware\n\nthat a failure to provide additional treatment to Kosilek might\n\nresult in serious harm.    Moreover, it held that the DOC's failure\n\nto provide treatment was rooted, at least in part, in \"sincere\n\nsecurity concerns.\"    As a result, the court ruled that the DOC was\n\nnot in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\n\n           Despite finding for the DOC, the district court's opinion\n\nmade clear that Kosilek required additional treatment for her GID,\n\nand that the DOC would need to develop and implement an improved\n\ntreatment plan.       The court warned that a failure to provide\n\ntreatment in the future, now that the DOC was on notice of the\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fpotential for harm if only \"supportive therapy\" was provided, could\n\namount to an Eighth Amendment violation.\n\nC.   The DOC offers treatment\n\n           The DOC responded to Kosilek I by revamping its policy\n\nfor GID treatment.      In the past, the DOC had adopted a policy of\n\n\"freezing\" a prisoner's treatment at whatever level that prisoner\n\nhad attained prior to incarceration.            Hormonal treatment, for\n\nexample,   would   be   available   only   to   prisoners     who   had   been\n\nprescribed hormones prior to incarceration.            In place of this\n\n\"freeze-frame\" policy, after Kosilek I the DOC adopted a plan that\n\nallowed prisoners to receive additional treatment beyond the level\n\nof that received before entering prison, when such care was\n\nmedically required.       Under this new plan, medical recommendations\n\nwould be made by the University of Massachusetts Correctional\n\nHealth Program (\"UMass\"), a health-services provider contracted by\n\nthe DOC.    The DOC Commissioner and the DOC Director of Health\n\nServices were responsible for assessing whether any change in\n\ntreatment would create increased security concerns.\n\n           Kosilek was evaluated by Dr. David Seil, a gender-\n\nidentity specialist, who prescribed a course of treatment to\n\nalleviate the mental distress -- often referred to as \"dysphoria\"\n\n--   associated    with    her   GID.      In   line   with     Dr.   Seil's\n\nrecommendations, in 2003 the DOC began providing Kosilek with\n\nsignificant ameliorative treatment aimed at directly addressing the\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fmental distress caused by GID.          In addition to continued mental\n\nhealth treatment, she was provided female, gender-appropriate\n\nclothing and personal effects, and electrolysis was performed to\n\npermanently remove her facial hair.2        Kosilek also began a course\n\nof hormonal treatments recommended by an endocrinologist.            These\n\ntreatments resulted in \"breast development and shrinkage of her\n\ntesticles.\" All of the treatments described continue to be offered\n\nto Kosilek to the present day.\n\nD.   Consideration of SRS\n\n           In line with the Harry Benjamin Standards of Care (\"the\n\n\"Standards of Care\" or \"the Standards\"),3 Dr. Seil recommended that\n\nKosilek   be   considered   for   SRS    after   one   year   of   hormonal\n\n\n2\n  Facial hair removal was delayed because of difficulty finding a\nprovider that was willing to perform these services on Kosilek.\nThe minutes of the DOC's Executive Staff Meetings show that they\nproactively sought out service providers throughout this period of\ndelay, and electrolysis was completed in November 2004.\n3\n   The Standards of Care are a set of treatment recommendations\nissued by the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria\nAssociation that provide guidance on the treatment of individuals\nwith GID.   Relevant to Kosilek II is the sixth version of the\nStandards of Care.    See Harry Benjamin Int'l Gender Dysphoria\nAss'n, Standards of Care for Gender Identity Disorders, Sixth\nVersion (2001) (\"Standards of Care\"). A seventh version of the\nStandards of Care was published in 2011, and adopts the Harry\nBenjamin Association's new name. See World Professional Ass'n for\nTransgender Health (\"WPATH\"), Standards of Care for the Health of\nTranssexual, Transgender, and Gender–Nonconforming People, Version\n7 (2011). The Standards of Care \"are intended to provide flexible\ndirections for the treatment\" of GID, and state that \"[i]ndividual\nprofessionals and organized programs may modify\" the Standards'\nrequirements in response to \"a patient's unique . . . situation\" or\n\"an experienced professional's evolving [treatment methodology].\"\nStandards of Care at 1-2 (emphasis added).\n\n                                   -7-\n\ftreatment.4    Accordingly, in 2004 the DOC began the process of\n\nfinding   an   appropriate   professional     to       evaluate     Kosilek's\n\neligibility for, and the necessity of, SRS. At the DOC's Executive\n\nStaff Meetings there was some debate regarding who should be hired\n\nto conduct this evaluation.          The UMass Mental Health Program\n\nDirector, Dr. Kenneth Appelbaum, suggested that the DOC consult\n\nwith the Fenway Community Health Center (the \"Fenway Center\"). The\n\nFenway Center is a Boston-based facility focused on serving the\n\nlesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community.             In contrast,\n\nthe DOC's Director of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services,\n\nGregory   Hughes   (\"Hughes\"),   suggested   consulting        with   Cynthia\n\nOsborne (\"Osborne\"), a gender identity specialist employed at the\n\nJohns Hopkins School of Medicine who had experience working with\n\nother departments of correction regarding GID treatment.\n\n           Hughes expressed concern with using the Fenway Center\n\nbecause of \"the perception that their approach was to come out with\n\nrecommendations    that   globally    endorsed     a    full      panoply   of\n\ntreatments.\"    It was thought that Osborne, in contrast, \"may do\n\nmore objective evaluations.\"     Dr. Appelbaum noted, however, that\n\nthe Fenway Center's approach was, to his knowledge, probably \"more\n\n\n\n4\n  This treatment plan aligns with the Standards of Care's triadic\nsequence for GID treatment. This sequence begins with diagnosis\nand the provision of therapy, progresses to endocrine treatments,\nand culminates with consideration of SRS after at least one full\nyear living a \"real life experience\" in the preferred gender role.\nMany individuals with GID choose not to complete the full sequence.\n\n                                  -8-\n\fthe norm than the exception.\"    The DOC also recognized that having\n\na Boston-based treatment provider might more easily facilitate the\n\nprocess of Kosilek's evaluation.\n\n          The Fenway Center was retained by the DOC, and Kosilek\n\nwas evaluated by Kevin Kapila, M.D., and Randi Kaufman, Psy.D., in\n\na ninety-minute interview.   Drs. Kapila and Kaufman also reviewed\n\nKosilek's medical records.      On February 24, 2005, they issued a\n\nreport recommending that Kosilek receive SRS (the \"Fenway Report\").\n\nThe Fenway Report acknowledged Kosilek's positive response to the\n\ntreatment provided by the DOC.\n\n          Her joy around being feminized through hormone\n          therapy, facial and body hair removal, and her\n          ability to have access, and to dress in,\n          feminine attire and make-up is palpable.\n          These responses further suggest that being\n          able to express herself as female has been\n          helpful    in     alleviating    her    gender\n          dysphoria. . . .      [I]t is clear that her\n          increasingly feminine presentation has been\n          beneficial to her psychologically.\n\nNonetheless, it also emphasized that Kosilek remained significantly\n\ndistressed by \"having male genitalia, as well as not having female\n\ngenitalia.\"   In light of this continuing distress, the Fenway\n\nCenter doctors stated that \"it is quite likely that Michelle will\n\nattempt suicide again if she is not able to change her anatomy.\"\n\nThe report also concluded that Kosilek had fully progressed through\n\nthe Standards of Care's triadic sequence, and that she \"appear[ed]\n\nto be ready\" for SRS. SRS, the doctors believed, would most likely\n\n\"allow Michelle to have full relief from the symptoms of gender\n\n                                  -9-\n\fdysphoria\" and would quite possibly \"increase her chance for\n\nsurvival\" by greatly decreasing the potential for future suicidal\n\nideation.\n\n            The Fenway Report was received by the DOC and reviewed by\n\nDr. Appelbaum and his UMass colleague, Dr. Arthur Brewer.                   The\n\nUMass    doctors    informed    the   DOC    that    they   found    no   clear\n\ncontraindications to SRS, but noted that they were \"unaware of any\n\nother case in which an inmate has undergone sex reassignment\n\nsurgery while incarcerated.\"\n\n            After considering the information from UMass, the DOC\n\ndecided to have Osborne conduct a peer review of the Fenway Report.\n\nIn a letter to Osborne, the DOC stated that it was requesting her\n\nservices because \"[t]he treatment of Gender Identity Disorder\n\nwithin a correctional environment is a complicated issue and one\n\nthat the Department takes very seriously.               We are aware of the\n\nsubstantial expertise you possess in this area and hope that you\n\ncan     provide    us   with   assistance    in     determining     appropriate\n\n\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\ftreatment.\"5   On April 12, 2005, the DOC sent Osborne copies of all\n\nprevious medical evaluations of Kosilek.\n\n          On April 28, 2005, the DOC Director of Health Services,\n\nSusan Martin (\"Martin\"), wrote UMass, stating her concern that\n\nUMass had not \"address[ed] the lack of detail, clarity and specific\n\nrecommendations in the evaluation done by the Fenway Clinic,\" and\n\nhad failed to provide an independent recommendation as to the\n\nappropriateness of surgery. She also asked for specific logistical\n\ninformation, including a list of doctors who might provide the\n\nsurgery, what procedures would be performed, and what recovery time\n\ncould be expected.\n\n          On May 10, 2005, Drs. Appelbaum and Brewer replied,\n\nindicating that they deferred to the Fenway Center's recommendation\n\nof surgery, as they were not experts in the area of SRS -- a\n\nmedical procedure specifically excluded from their contract to\n\nprovide services to the DOC.    They provided a preliminary list of\n\nsurgeons to consider, none of whom were licensed to practice\n\nmedicine in Massachusetts.\n\n\n5\n    Osborne previously worked with the Virginia and Wisconsin\nDepartments of Correction regarding their treatment of prisoners\nwith GID. It is unclear from the record whether the Fenway Center\nhad previously developed treatment plans for GID within a\npenological setting. When the DOC asked what consideration the\nFenway Center gave to issues such as \"criminal history [and]\nviolence against women,\" the center responded that \"independent of\nother psychological disorders [Fenway experts] don't consider\ncriminal history, homicide, [or] brutality.\" On January 5, 2005 --\nbefore the Fenway Center released its report -- the DOC's Director\nof Health Services \"expressed concern\" about these omissions.\n\n                                -11-\n\f           On May 20, 2005, Osborne finished her peer review of the\n\nFenway Report.       She began by making clear that her review was\n\nlimited to reading and evaluating the reports of others.                     As a\n\nresult, she could not independently diagnose Kosilek, but she\n\nagreed with the conclusion that Kosilek suffered from GID.              Still,\n\nshe    disagreed    with    what    she   believed   to   be     a    lack     of\n\ncomprehensiveness in the report and an inclination to minimize the\n\npossibility of comorbid conditions.           Namely, Osborne highlighted\n\nthat   Kosilek     had   previously    been   diagnosed   with       Antisocial\n\nPersonality Disorder, a diagnosis neither confirmed nor denied by\n\nthe Fenway Report, and that the report included no indication that\n\nKosilek had been assessed for other pathologies likely to lead to\n\nself-harming behavior.        Osborne expressed belief that threats of\n\nself-harm or suicide should serve as a contraindication to surgery,\n\nand that such threats were not a valid or clinically acceptable\n\njustification for surgery.         In consequence, she disagreed with the\n\nFenway Center's statements that surgery was medically necessary as\n\na means to diminish the likelihood that Kosilek would attempt\n\nsuicide in the future.\n\n           Osborne's report also highlighted that the Standards of\n\nCare admit of flexible application, and noted that the Standards\n\nstate that \"the diagnosis of GID invites the consideration of a\n\nvariety of therapeutic options, only one of which is the complete\n\ntherapeutic triad.\"        She emphasized that \"[t]here is currently no\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\funiversal professional consensus regarding what constitutes medical\n\nnecessity in GID.\"\n\n           In reference to the Standards of Care's application in a\n\npenological setting, Osborne noted that the Standards of Care\n\ninclude a criterion that candidates for SRS exhibit \"satisfactory\n\ncontrol of problems such as sociopathy, substance abuse, psychosis\n\nand   suicidality.\"    She   believed       that    this   requirement   was\n\ninherently   in   conflict   with     the   Standard's     application   to\n\nincarcerated persons, as she felt incarceration indicated a lack of\n\nmastery over such antisocial leanings.             Moreover, Osborne noted\n\nthat non-incarcerated individuals often face external constraints\n\nin their choice of treatments or determine, as a result of their\n\n\"real life experience,\" that other, non-invasive treatments are\n\npersonally preferable to SRS. In consequence, she felt that it was\n\nunrealistic for inmates to expect \"that prison life [would] provide\n\nno constraints or obstacles to cross gender preferences\" and that\n\nit was \"outside[] the bounds of good clinical practice\" for care\n\nproviders to try to meet this expectation. Given the isolation\n\nattendant to incarceration, Osborne also emphasized that prisoners\n\nmight often lack awareness of the frequency with which individuals\n\nchoose alternative treatments over SRS.\n\n           After considering Osborne's peer review, Martin again\n\nreached out to the doctors at UMass.                On May 25, 2005, she\n\nexpressed continuing concern with the Fenway Report, highlighting\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fthat Osborne's peer review had raised at least three questions\n\nregarding the report's thoroughness: (1) why the report omitted\n\nconsideration of potential comorbidities; (2) why the report did\n\nnot rely on formal psychological testing, but only an in-person\n\ninterview; and (3) why Kosilek's claims that she would likely seek\n\nto end her life if not provided with SRS were seen to justify,\n\nrather than serve as a contraindication to, surgery.         Martin also\n\nexpressed dissatisfaction that \"the February 24, 2005 evaluation by\n\nthe Fenway Clinic does not indicate whether sex reassignment\n\nsurgery is a medical necessity for Michele [sic] Kosilek\" and\n\n\"fails to adequately address the issue of whether the current\n\ntreatment provided to Kosilek provides sufficient relief of the\n\nsymptoms of gender dysphoria.\"\n\n          A   response   from   Drs.   Appelbaum   and   Brewer   came   on\n\nJune 14, 2005.   The doctors made clear that they were not experts\n\nin the treatment of GID, and that they deferred to the Fenway\n\nCenter's treatment recommendation.       Referring to the differences\n\nbetween the preferred treatment plans of the Fenway Center and\n\nOsborne, the doctors reminded Martin that Osborne's report had\n\nemphasized the \"dearth of empirical research upon which to base\n\ntreatment decisions\" for GID and had highlighted the lack of\n\n\"professional consensus\" regarding the \"medical necessity\" of SRS.\n\n          The Fenway Center issued a follow-up report aimed at\n\nanswering Osborne's critique of its initial recommendation.              In\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\fthis report, Drs. Kapila and Kaufmann noted that suicidal ideation\n\nwas common among individuals suffering from GID, and that it often\n\ndecreased with the provision of care.                Therefore, the likelihood\n\nthat Kosilek would become suicidal if denied surgery was, to the\n\ndoctors, not a contraindication to her eligibility, but instead was\n\na symptom that could be alleviated by provision of SRS.                            The\n\ndoctors also disagreed with Osborne's belief that incarceration was\n\na   significant    contraindication           to   surgery,     noting      that   the\n\nStandards of Care specifically state that \"[p]ersons who are\n\nreceiving     treatment        for    [GID]    should   continue       to     receive\n\nappropriate treatment . . . after incarceration.                    For example,\n\nthose who are receiving psychotherapy and/or cross-sex hormonal\n\ntreatments should be allowed to continue this medically necessary\n\ntreatment . . . .\"\n\n            The Fenway Center doctors further discussed their belief\n\nthat   a    key   step    of    the    triadic      sequence,    the     \"real-life\n\nexperience,\" could occur in prison.                This treatment prerequisite\n\nrequires that an individual live full-time in their preferred\n\ncross-gender role for at least one year prior to being deemed\n\neligible for SRS.        The purpose of this requirement is ensure that\n\nGID patients have an opportunity to experience a full measure of\n\nlife in a cross-gender role, including the social scrutiny that may\n\narise among professional counterparts and peers.                       Prison, the\n\nFenway Center's doctors surmised, might be considered a \"more\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\fstringent\"    real-life     experience,     because   a   prisoner's   gender\n\npresentation would be subject to full-time monitoring by prison\n\npersonnel and other inmates.         The report concluded by reiterating\n\nthe Fenway Center's recommendation that Kosilek receive SRS.              The\n\ndoctors recognized that performing \"such a procedure would . . .\n\nbring up issues of housing and safety,\" but emphasized that\n\n\"hormone therapy and [SRS] are the only clinical treatments found\n\nto be effective for GID.\"\n\nE.   The DOC's Security Report\n\n             On April 25, 2005, the district court issued an order\n\nrequiring that the DOC conduct a review of any potential safety and\n\nsecurity concerns arising from the provision of SRS.             In the next\n\nmonth, the DOC worked to formalize its security concerns into a\n\nreport, which it eventually submitted to the court on June 10,\n\n2005.   As made clear by the minutes of the DOC's staff meetings,\n\nhowever, these security issues were a topic of discussion prior to\n\nthe court's order.         Previously, on January 5, 2005, the meeting\n\nattendees had discussed how and if Kosilek's prior violent acts\n\nagainst her wife should impact their evaluation and treatment plan.\n\nOn   April   20,   2005,    the   parties   discussed     potential   security\n\nconcerns that would arise should Kosilek be housed, post-surgery,\n\nin MCI-Framingham, Massachusetts' only female prison.            During that\n\nmeeting, DOC personnel noted that they were prepared to provide an\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fevaluation of general climate and security concerns implicated by\n\nthe provision of surgery.\n\n          On    May   19,   2005,     DOC    Commissioner   Kathleen   Dennehy\n\n(\"Dennehy\") convened a meeting with the Superintendent of MCI-\n\nNorfolk, Luis Spencer (\"Spencer\"), and the Superintendent of MCI-\n\nFramingham, Lynne Bissonnette (\"Bissonnette\"), as well as the DOC's\n\nlegal counsel. The purpose of this meeting was to formally discuss\n\nthe security concerns previously expressed by both superintendents\n\nin phone conversations with Dennehy. It was also an opportunity to\n\nbegin preparation of the report requested by the district court.\n\n          The    report     focused    mainly    on   issues   of   safety   and\n\nsecurity surrounding Kosilek's post-operative housing.                 Dennehy\n\nconveyed concern regarding housing Kosilek at MCI-Norfolk, noting\n\nthat approximately twenty-five percent of male offenders in the\n\nMassachusetts prison system are classified as sex offenders and\n\nconcluding that \"Kosilek would clearly be a target for assault and\n\nvictimization in a male prison.\"                The report also expressed\n\nconcerns with housing Kosilek at MCI-Framingham, including the\n\nabsence of single-bed cells, such that all inmates had to share\n\ncells, and the possibility that Kosilek's presence might exacerbate\n\nmental distress among the significant portion of MCI-Framingham's\n\npopulation that had previously experienced domestic abuse and\n\ntrauma at the hands of male partners.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\f           Given the stated infeasibility of housing Kosilek in the\n\ngeneral population of either MCI-Framingham or MCI-Norfolk, the\n\nreport considered segregated housing in a protected ward.       It\n\nexpressed concern, however, about the possible deleterious impact\n\non Kosilek's mental health caused by any housing solution that\n\nrequired long-term isolation.   The report also noted that it was\n\nnot within the DOC's ability to create a special ward for prisoners\n\nwith GID, given that these prisoners present a significant range of\n\ncriminal histories, security ratings, and treatment needs that are\n\nantithetical to co-housing.\n\n           On June 10, 2005, citing both its internal review of\n\nsafety and security and Osborne's reported concerns regarding the\n\nappropriateness of SRS, the DOC informed the district court that it\n\nhad chosen to continue Kosilek's current ameliorative treatment,\n\nbut not to provide her with SRS.\n\nF.   Kosilek II\n\n           Trial commenced on May 30, 2006, with what would be the\n\nfirst of three rounds of testimony.    For the sake of clarity and\n\nconcision, we summarize this testimony topically, rather than\n\ntemporally.   We begin with evidence regarding the standard of care\n\nfor treatment of GID.\n\n\n\n\n                                -18-\n\f            1.    Testimony related to medical necessity\n\n                     a.   Initial testimony\n\n            First to testify in 2006 was an expert witness for\n\nKosilek, Dr. George Brown, who had previously evaluated Kosilek in\n\n2001 and was an author of the Standards of Care.                      Prior to\n\ntestifying, Dr. Brown issued a written report assessing Kosilek’s\n\nreadiness   for    surgery    and     evaluating    her   current   mental   and\n\nphysical presentation, as compared with 2001. Dr. Brown noted that\n\nKosilek consistently presented as female and that \"[a]ccess to\n\nmakeup and female undergarments, laser hair removal, along with\n\nhormonal    treatments    .   .   .   have    all   seemed   to   significantly\n\nreinforce and consolidate the outward expression of [Kosilek's]\n\ngender identity as female.\"           Other positive effects of treatment\n\nwere also described:\n\n            Hormonal treatments have resulted in obvious\n            breast growth since my last assessment,\n            decrease in upper body strength, increase in\n            hip size, changes in amount and texture of\n            body hair, skin texture changes, testicular\n            volume decrease, and a large reduction in\n            spontaneous     erections    .     .    .    .\n            Psychologically, the effects of these combined\n            treatments have [included] . . . resolution of\n            depression, resolution of suicidality and\n            suicide gestures and attempts, improved mood\n            with reduction in irritability, anxiety, and\n            depression . . . .\n\nBased on his observations, Dr. Brown concluded that Kosilek was\n\neligible for SRS, having met all of the readiness criteria.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\f            Before the court, Dr. Brown's testimony emphasized that\n\nthe provision of female clothing and effects, hair removal, and\n\nhormones    had    resulted   in    a    lessening    of   \"the    severity     of\n\n[Kosilek's] dysphoria.\"       According to Dr. Brown \"[s]he was clearly\n\nless depressed, less anxious, less irritable . . . .               She was not\n\nsuicidal . . . .\"         Despite these significant improvements, Dr.\n\nBrown testified that he believed SRS to be an appropriate and\n\n\"medical[ly] necessary component\" of Kosilek's treatment.                       He\n\nrelated instances in which incarcerated persons who could not\n\ncomplete the triadic sequence6 exhibited an increase in negative\n\nsymptoms, including a resurgence of self-harming behavior.\n\n            Dr. Brown further testified that, if not granted surgery,\n\nhe believed Kosilek’s feelings of \"hopelessness will intensify,\"\n\nand that she would likely attempt suicide.                  In reaching this\n\nconclusion, Dr. Brown emphasized that \"other parts of the treatment\n\nplan [e.g., hormones, hair removal, and the provision of female\n\nclothing] . . . all contribute in their own way to a level of\n\nimprovement.\"      Nonetheless, he felt that, if Kosilek lost hope of\n\nreceiving   SRS,    her   current       treatment   plan   would   not   stop    a\n\ndeterioration of her mental state and the possible reemergence of\n\nsuicidal ideation.\n\n\n\n6\n   The steps of this sequence, if fully completed, progress from\nGID diagnosis and therapeutic treatment, through endocrine\ntreatment, and culminate -- after at least a one-year-long real-\nlife experience -- with the consideration of SRS.\n\n                                        -20-\n\f           Dr.   Kaufman   from   the   Fenway    Center    also   testified,\n\nreiterating   that   the   Fenway    Center      believed   SRS    to   be   an\n\nappropriate and medically necessary step in Kosilek's treatment.\n\nShe further stated her belief that, if not given surgery, Kosilek\n\nwould present a significant risk of suicide: \"if she's not able to\n\nhave surgery, I think that she'll be hopeless and feel helpless and\n\nat that point really will have nothing else to live for.\"\n\n           Next to testify was Mark Burrows (\"Burrows\"), who had\n\nbeen Kosilek’s treating psychiatrist for approximately five years.\n\nBurrows testified to Kosilek's strong desire for SRS, and to her\n\nfeelings of hope associated with completing the formalization of\n\nher gender presentation.     Burrows also stated that denying surgery\n\nwould likely have a negative impact on Kosilek's mental health. He\n\nbelieved that it was \"slightly\" \"more probable than not\" that a\n\ndenial of the surgery would result in Kosilek attempting to commit\n\nsuicide.   Burrows also spoke about his belief that, if given SRS,\n\nKosilek should not continue to reside at MCI-Norfolk, as \"the risks\n\ninvolved in her possibly being assaulted are obvious.\"\n\n           Dr. Appelbaum of UMass was also called as a witness for\n\nKosilek.   He testified as to UMass's trust in the Fenway Center's\n\nrecommendations, and to his belief that the DOC need not have\n\nsought out a peer review of the Fenway Report, given the Fenway\n\nCenter's expertise in the treatment of GID.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\f            Kosilek testified next.          She expressed the depth of her\n\ndesire   for     SRS,   and   she   stated   that   she    would    continue   to\n\nexperience mental anguish regarding her gender identity so long as\n\nshe had male genitalia.         If not provided with SRS, Kosilek said\n\nthat she \"would not want to continue existing [as an anatomical\n\nmale]\" and might instead attempt to commit suicide.                She disagreed\n\nwith the suggestion that treatment short of SRS could adequately\n\nrelieve her mental distress, stating that \"[t]he problem is my\n\ngenitals.      That's what needs to be fixed.\"          Kosilek also testified\n\nas to feeling discomfort in the all-male environment of MCI-Norfolk\n\nand having a strong desire to be transferred to MCI-Framingham.\n\nShe felt that the inmates at MCI-Framingham would be more accepting\n\nand welcoming of her than those at MCI-Norfolk.\n\n            The DOC offered testimony from Dr. Chester Schmidt, a\n\nlicensed psychiatrist and Associate Director of the Johns Hopkins\n\nSchool of Medicine.       Dr. Schmidt expressed his belief that Kosilek\n\nhad undergone an \"excellent adaptation\" through treatment with\n\nhormones, hair removal, psychotherapy, and the provision of female\n\ngarb.    These treatments had alleviated the severity of her mental\n\ndistress and allowed Kosilek to significantly consolidate her\n\ngender identity.        Dr. Schmidt acknowledged that, if not provided\n\nSRS, Kosilek's level of mental distress would likely increase, with\n\ndepression or attempts at self-harm possible.                  On the whole,\n\nhowever,    he    believed    that   her     positive     adaptation   and     the\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\fconsolidation of her gender identity indicated that the current\n\ncourse of treatment provided by the DOC was medically adequate.\n\nDr. Schmidt explained that the severity of dysphoria associated\n\nwith GID may \"wax and wane,\" with patients feeling depressed or\n\nhopeless at times, but generally being able to alleviate these\n\ndepressive symptoms with appropriate psychotherapy and medical\n\ninterventions.     He felt that these measures, in combination with\n\nKosilek's current course of treatment, would allow her to live\n\nsafely and maintain a level of contentment.\n\n            On    cross-examination,     Dr.   Schmidt   was     questioned\n\nregarding   his    alleged   rejection    of   the   Standards   of   Care.\n\nDr. Schmidt responded that he found the Standards of Care \"very\n\nuseful for patients\" and that he commonly requested that patients\n\nfamiliarize themselves with these Standards when they began to seek\n\ncare for SRS.       Asked if he had stricter requirements for SRS\n\neligibility than those in the Standards of Care, Dr. Schmidt\n\nemphasized that he neither \"advocate[s] for nor . . . speak[s]\n\nagainst the decisions for the cross-gender hormones or eventually\n\nfor surgery.\"     Rather, he believes such decisions are best made by\n\nthe patient, based on their personal needs and desires.            In line\n\nwith this belief, Dr. Schmidt stated that he does not specifically\n\nrecommend SRS, but at a patient's request he will release medical\n\nfiles and send a letter indicating that a patient is ready for\n\nsurgery to their chosen SRS provider.\n\n\n                                  -23-\n\f             Dr.    Schmidt    further   testified    that    he   viewed   the\n\nStandards of Care as \"guidelines.\"             He explained, however, that\n\n\"[t]here are many people in the country who disagree with those\n\nstandards who are involved in the [GID] field.\" Because of this\n\ndisagreement, Dr. Schmidt expressed hesitation to refer to the\n\nStandards of Care, or the recommendation for SRS, as medically\n\nnecessary.      He emphasized the existence of alternative methods and\n\ntreatment plans accepted within the medical community.                He also\n\nquestioned whether the Standards of Care's requirement of a real-\n\nlife experience could occur in prison, opining that the real-life\n\nexperience required a range of social and vocational experiences\n\nunavailable within a penological setting.\n\n             Osborne testified next, reiterating her agreement with\n\nKosilek's GID diagnosis, but disagreeing that SRS was a medically\n\nnecessary treatment.           In reference to the Standards of Care,\n\nOsborne testified that she fully agreed that SRS was an effective\n\nand appropriate treatment for GID.            She emphasized, however, that\n\nshe did not view SRS as medically necessary in light of \"the whole\n\ncontinuum from noninvasive to invasive\" treatment options available\n\nto individuals with GID.            Regarding Kosilek personally, Osborne\n\nindicated that she believed Kosilek's current treatment plan had\n\nbeen   highly      effective   in   allowing   Kosilek   to   feel   \"hopeful,\n\neuphoric, and not depressed\" about her gender identity.              Osborne,\n\nlike Dr. Schmidt before her, again expressed skepticism as to\n\n\n                                       -24-\n\fwhether a real-life experience could occur in jail, given that a\n\nsingle-sex environment necessarily limited the sorts of social and\n\nhuman interactions available.     Osborne agreed that not providing\n\nKosilek with SRS might give rise to possible suicidal ideation, but\n\nnoted that the DOC had significant expertise in treating prisoners\n\nexhibiting self-harming behavior.    She felt that Kosilek's current\n\ntreatment plan, in conjunction with protective measures aimed at\n\nensuring her personal safety, was an appropriate and medically\n\nacceptable response to Kosilek's GID.\n\n                   b.   The UMass report\n\n             Following the close of initial testimony, the district\n\ncourt ordered UMass to review the testimony of all medical experts\n\nand to issue a report regarding whether the treatment proposed by\n\nDr. Schmidt was an adequate method of treating Kosilek's GID.     In\n\nthis report -- submitted to the court on September 18, 2006 -- Drs.\n\nAppelbaum and Brewer made clear that they \"worked with and relied\n\nupon Dr. Kapila and Dr. Kaufman\" who \"assist[ed] to prepare this\n\nresponse.\"     The report stated that the UMass doctors \"have been\n\ninformed by Dr. Kaufman and Dr. Kapila that . . . trial testimony\n\n. . . confirms their opinion that Michelle Kosilek has a 'serious\n\nmedical need' because there is a 'substantial risk of serious harm\n\nif it is not adequately treated.'\"         In conclusion, the report\n\nreiterated that the Fenway Center believed Dr. Schmidt's proposed\n\n\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\ftreatment plan would not provide adequate care, and UMass endorsed\n\nthat conclusion.\n\n                    c.   The court-appointed expert\n\n             At the conclusion of the first round of testimony, the\n\ndistrict court decided to appoint an independent expert to assist\n\nin determining what constituted the medical standard of treatment\n\nfor GID.      On October 31, 2006, with the parties' input, the\n\ndistrict court selected Dr. Stephen Levine, a practitioner at the\n\nCenter for Marital and Sexual Health in Ohio and a clinical\n\nprofessor of psychiatry at Case Western Reserve University School\n\nof Medicine.    Dr. Levine had helped to author the fifth version of\n\nthe Standards of Care, and served as Chairman of the Harry Benjamin\n\nInternational Gender Dysphoria Association's Standards of Care\n\nCommittee.\n\n             A month after his appointment, Dr. Levine issued a\n\nwritten report. The report began by explaining the dual roles that\n\nWPATH   --    formerly   the   Harry   Benjamin   Association   and   the\n\norganization that wrote the Standards of Care -- plays in its\n\nprovision of care to individuals with GID:\n\n             WPATH is supportive to those who want sex\n             reassignment surgery (SRS). . . . Skepticism\n             and strong alternate views are not well\n             tolerated. Such views have been known to be\n             greeted with antipathy from the large numbers\n             of nonprofessional adults who attend each [of]\n             the organization's biennial meetings. . . .\n\n                    The [Standards of Care are] the product\n             of an enormous effort to be balanced, but it\n\n                                   -26-\n\f          is not a politically neutral document. WPATH\n          aspires to be both a scientific organization\n          and an advocacy group for the transgendered.\n          These aspirations sometimes conflict.      The\n          limitations of the [Standards of Care],\n          however, are not primarily political.     They\n          are caused by the lack of rigorous research in\n          the field.\n\nDr. Levine further emphasized that \"large gaps\" exist in the\n\nmedical community's knowledge regarding the long-term effects of\n\nSRS and other GID treatments in relation to its positive or\n\nnegative correlation to suicidal ideation.\n\n          Dr. Levine next discussed the possibility of Kosilek\n\nhaving a real-life experience in prison.     He explained that the\n\nFenway Center, in stating that a real-life experience could be had\n\nin prison, \"failed to offer a mild caveat that the real life test\n\nwas designed to test the patients' capacity to function as a female\n\nin the community by mastering the demands of . . . family, social\n\nrelationships,   educational   accomplishment,   [and]   vocational\n\nperformance.\"    Such experiences and relationships, Dr. Levine\n\nnoted, are not a part of Kosilek's daily life in prison.       Dr.\n\nLevine's final conclusion was that:\n\n          Dr. Schmidt's view, however unpopular and\n          uncompassionate in the eyes of some experts in\n          GID, is within prudent professional community\n          standards.   Treatment stopping short of SRS\n          would   be   considered   adequate   by   many\n          psychiatrists, gender team members, and gender\n          patients themselves, if Kosilek were a citizen\n          in the community. . . . [T]here are a number\n          of acceptable community standards which derive\n          from differing assumptions about disorders,\n\n\n                               -27-\n\f             their causes,     and    the    possible   effective\n             interventions.\n\nHe recognized that the different treatment plans advocated by Dr.\n\nSchmidt and the Fenway Center \"each . . . [had] merit,\" as well as\n\nlimitations.    Dr. Levine further wrote that doctors generally \"do\n\nnot recommend treatment to GID patients. . . .                The decision is\n\n[the patient's], when and if they still want it.\"\n\n             Dr. Levine testified on December 16, 2006.                He first\n\nreiterated    his   belief    that   Dr.    Schmidt's   view,      although   not\n\npreferred by some GID specialists, was within \"prudent professional\n\nstandards.\"    He noted that Kosilek had received significant relief\n\non her current treatment plan, and that many patients with GID live\n\ncomfortably without completing the triadic sequence.                He believed\n\nthat Kosilek had already successfully consolidated her gender\n\nidentity, such that the removal of her male genitalia might relieve\n\ndysphoria, but it was not necessary to complete that consolidation.\n\nHe   also   indicated   variability        and   difficulty   in    forecasting\n\ndepressive symptoms and self-harming behavior in GID patients.                He\n\nexplained that he believed Kosilek would certainly express deep\n\ndisappointment if denied SRS -- described as the sole current focus\n\nof her life -- but that coping mechanisms might well change her\n\noutlook in months and years to come, allowing her to live happily\n\nwithout the provision of SRS.\n\n             The district court then asked Dr. Levine to narrow the\n\nlens of his inquiry by presuming that there were absolutely no\n\n                                     -28-\n\fexternal contraindications to surgery and that Kosilek had indeed\n\nhad a real-life experience in prison.         Given these presumptions,\n\nthe court asked Dr. Levine to testify as to whether it would still\n\nbe   prudent   to   not   provide   Kosilek   with   SRS.    Dr.   Levine\n\nacknowledged his belief that prudent professionals would generally\n\nnot deny surgery to a fully eligible individual.               Still, he\n\nhesitated to declare Dr. Schmidt's approach medically unacceptable.\n\nHe answered that the provision of SRS would surely be a prudent\n\ncourse of treatment, but then stated that \"I also believe it's\n\nprudent not to give her Sex Reassignment Surgery for lots of\n\nreasons.\" He again emphasized for the court that the treatment of\n\nGID was an evolving field, in which practitioners could reasonably\n\ndiffer in their preferred treatment methods.         Dr. Levine explained\n\nthat in many instances patients cannot or do not want to receive\n\nSRS, and prudent physicians commonly employ a range of treatments\n\nto ameliorate these patients' dysphoria.\n\n                    d.    Additional rounds of testimony\n\n           Several witnesses were recalled for additional testimony.\n\nDrs. Kapila and Kaufman appeared again on behalf of Kosilek.        Both\n\nreiterated their belief that Kosilek had a serious medical need and\n\nthat, given Kosilek's high risk of suicide if denied the surgery,\n\nSRS was the only adequate treatment plan.            Dr. Appelbaum also\n\ntestified again, as did the UMass Medical Director.           Both UMass\n\n\n\n\n                                    -29-\n\fdoctors   reaffirmed     their   endorsement    of   the   Fenway   Center's\n\ntreatment recommendations.\n\n           Kosilek also presented additional witness testimony from\n\nDr. Marshall Forstein, Associate Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard\n\nMedical   School,   who    had   previously    evaluated    Kosilek    during\n\nKosilek I. Dr. Forstein issued a written report, in which he noted\n\nthat \"the question of the most prudent form of treatment is\n\ncomplicated by the diagnosis of GID being on the margins of typical\n\nmedical practice.\" Despite this recognition, he testified that he\n\nbelieved SRS was necessary for Kosilek.         He felt that, if she was\n\nnot given SRS, there was a significant risk that Kosilek would\n\nattempt suicide or self-mutilation. Although Dr. Forstein believed\n\nthat psychotherapy might \"help with frustration, with harassment,\n\nand with depression,\" he was uncertain whether Kosilek could ever\n\nfully \"reconcile with being incompletely transitioned.\"\n\n           2.   Testimony regarding safety and security concerns\n\n                    a.    Initial testimony\n\n           In line with the June 10, 2005, security report prepared\n\nby Commissioner Dennehy, multiple DOC officials testified regarding\n\nthe safety and security concerns that were likely to arise if\n\nKosilek was provided SRS.\n\n           First to testify was Spencer, who at that time served as\n\nSuperintendent of MCI-Norfolk.        Spencer began by explaining the\n\ngeneral layout and security measures at MCI-Norfolk.                  He also\n\n\n                                    -30-\n\fexplained that the prison had, so far, successfully been able to\n\naccommodate Kosilek's receipt of care without incident.                 Spencer\n\nwas unaware of any issues or incidents of harassment related to\n\nKosilek's breast growth and increasingly feminine appearance.                He\n\nstated, however, that he would have significant concerns housing an\n\nanatomically female prisoner in MCI-Norfolk, an all-male prison.\n\nDespite the lack of historical incidents specific to Kosilek, he\n\nemphasized that \"inmates do get assaulted, inmates have been raped\n\n. . . [a]nd putting a female in a correctional environment like\n\nMCI-Norfolk would be of high concern to me.\"           If Kosilek remained\n\nat MCI-Norfolk, Spencer testified that he believed she would only\n\nbe   safe   if   housed   in   the   Special   Management   Unit,   a    highly\n\nrestricted secure building separated from the general population.\n\n            Bissonnette,       Superintendent    of   MCI-Framingham,      also\n\ntestified about the security concerns she believed would arise if\n\nKosilek was transferred to the all-female prison after receiving\n\nSRS.    She explained that MCI-Framingham does not have private\n\ncells, save for the segregation and medical units.             All women in\n\nthe general population are required to cohabitate, and that prison\n\nwould be unable to provide a single-occupancy cell for Kosilek.\n\nShe also explained that Kosilek's presence could create significant\n\ndisruption in MCI-Framingham's population, given that Kosilek had\n\nbeen convicted for violently murdering her wife, and that a\n\n\n\n\n                                      -31-\n\fsignificant portion of women at MCI-Framingham were victims of\n\ndomestic abuse.\n\n             Bissonnette acknowledged that there were procedures in\n\nplace designed to help women cope with exposure to upsetting or\n\ntraumatic experiences with other prisoners, but maintained that\n\nthese security concerns would require that Kosilek, if transferred\n\nto MCI-Framingham, be housed in the segregated Close Custody unit.\n\nBissonnette explained that she had significant hesitation about\n\nincarcerating anyone long-term in the Close Custody unit, given the\n\npotential negative effects of such long-term segregation.\n\n             Commissioner Dennehy also testified.     She described the\n\nsecurity concerns arising from cross-gender housing as \"obvious\" to\n\nany experienced corrections officer.       In line with her belief that\n\nthe safety and security concerns about post-operative housing were\n\nclear, Dennehy stated that she would not feel comfortable allowing\n\nSRS -- even if mandated by the court -- if she could not identify\n\nan adequate method of safely housing Kosilek after her operation.\n\nDennehy reiterated Spencer's and Bissonnette's concerns, stating\n\nthat   she    deeply   trusted   both    Superintendents'   professional\n\njudgments regarding the security of housing Kosilek at their\n\nrespective facilities.     Dennehy also explained why reliance on an\n\ninterstate compact to transfer Kosilek would be problematic.        She\n\nemphasized that other states take prisoners on a fully voluntary\n\n\n\n\n                                  -32-\n\fbasis, and that no state may be willing or able to accommodate a\n\ntransfer request for Kosilek.\n\n          Commissioner Dennehy was also questioned about negative\n\npress surrounding the DOC's possible provision of SRS to Kosilek.\n\nSpecifically, she was asked about her professional relationship\n\nwith a state senator who had vocally opposed surgery and sponsored\n\nlegislation to deny its provision.      She was also asked about any\n\ncontact with the then-lieutenant governor, who was another strong\n\nopponent of providing SRS to prisoners.      Dennehy stated that she\n\nwas aware of negative press reports and political opposition\n\nsurrounding Kosilek's request, but that her decision not to provide\n\nSRS was based only on security concerns and had not been influenced\n\nby this public pressure.\n\n          The district court recalled Dennehy on October 18, 2006,\n\nto ask additional questions regarding a growing amount of press\n\ncoverage surrounding the case.    Dennehy acknowledged that she was\n\naware of significant news coverage of Kosilek's case, but denied\n\npersonally following the story in the media.      She explained that\n\nthere were staff members within the DOC trained to deal with press\n\ninquiries and that she generally received only summaries of news\n\ncoverage from her staff.     Again, Dennehy strongly denied forming\n\nany opinion about correctional safety procedures based on media\n\nreports or public opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -33-\n\f                   b.   Commissioner Clarke\n\n           Dennehy ended her tenure as DOC Commissioner on April 30,\n\n2007, and in November 2007 the position was filled by Harold\n\nClarke.   After Clarke took over, the district court requested that\n\nhe familiarize himself with a selected number of trial transcripts.\n\nClarke was ordered to file a report, on the basis of those\n\ntranscripts, indicating whether he believed that the DOC had\n\nlegitimate reasons to refuse Kosilek's request for SRS.\n\n           Clarke's report, filed approximately a month after the\n\ndistrict court's order, stated that his conclusions were based on\n\nmore than three decades of correctional experience and were not\n\ninfluenced by political or media pressure.         He expressed concern\n\nregarding threats of suicide being used as a means for prisoners to\n\nreceive wanted benefits or concessions from staff.        Finding it to\n\nbe bad practice for prison administrators to give in to demands\n\naccompanied by the threat of suicide, Clarke stated that he\n\nbelieved the Massachusetts prison system had taken significant\n\nmeasures to ensure it was prepared to deal with suicidal ideation\n\namong its prison population.    In addition to considering the issue\n\nof suicide, Clarke's report reemphasized the significant post-\n\noperative security concerns expressed by his predecessor.               He\n\nstated that housing Kosilek at MCI-Norfolk created clear security\n\nconcerns related to mixed-gender prison populations, while housing\n\nKosilek   at   MCI-Framingham   would   pose   a   significant   risk   of\n\n\n                                 -34-\n\fdestabilizing that environment, given the number of women prisoners\n\nwho were victims of domestic violence.                    Clarke also stated his\n\nbelief   that    a    separate     unit    to     house   GID   prisoners    was    not\n\nfeasible, given that prisoners with GID might have a wide range of\n\nsecurity classifications and security needs, making cohabitation\n\nunsafe. In reference to the possibility of an interstate transfer,\n\nClarke reiterated the concern that any interstate transfer would be\n\ncompletely voluntary and that a receiving state might later decide\n\nto return Kosilek, at which time the housing concerns would\n\nreemerge.\n\n            Testifying before the court, Clarke acknowledged that he\n\nhad   received       several     letters    from    outraged     state   politicians\n\nclaiming that provision of the surgery would be an \"affront to the\n\ntaxpayers\" and citing state budget concerns as a reason to deny\n\nKosilek surgery.        The letters argued that a strained state budget\n\nshould not be used to accommodate what the legislators believed to\n\nbe an \"elective\" procedure and that the DOC would be \"unwise\" to\n\nprovide it.      Clarke, however, explained that he had not answered\n\nthese    letters,      as   he   believed       providing   an    answer    would   be\n\ninappropriate given his role as DOC Commissioner.                   He also denied\n\nbeing in any way influenced by cost concerns in reaching his\n\nconclusion regarding safety and security concerns. Clarke similarly\n\ntestified that he was aware of media coverage regarding Kosilek's\n\n\n\n\n                                           -35-\n\frequest, but he had not personally viewed the news or heard the\n\nradio stories.\n\nG.   Kosilek II\n\n           The    district   court    issued   an   extensive   opinion   on\n\nSeptember 4, 2012.      This opinion concluded that Kosilek had a\n\nserious medical need and that -- based on the court's belief that\n\nDr. Schmidt was not a prudent professional -- the only adequate way\n\nto treat this need was through SRS. Moreover, the court determined\n\nthat the DOC's stated security concerns were merely pretextual and\n\nconcluded that the DOC had in fact made its decision based on\n\npublic and political pressure. This, the court concluded, amounted\n\nto deliberate indifference under the Eighth Amendment. Stating its\n\nbelief that the DOC would continue to deny Kosilek adequate\n\ntreatment in the future, the district court granted an injunction\n\nrequiring that the DOC provide Kosilek with SRS.\n\n                             II.     Discussion\n\nA.   The Eighth Amendment and Medical Care in Prison\n\n           \"Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive\n\nfines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\"          U.S.\n\nConst. amend. VIII. From this brief amendment, courts have derived\n\nthe principles that govern the permissible conditions under which\n\nprisoners are held and that establish the medical treatment those\n\nprisoners must be afforded.        See Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825,\n\n832 (1994).       Where \"society takes from prisoners the means to\n\n\n                                     -36-\n\fprovide for their own needs,\" the failure to provide such care \"may\n\nactually produce physical torture or a lingering death.\"       Brown v.\n\nPlata, 131 S. Ct. 1910, 1928 (2011) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). Undue suffering, unrelated to any legitimate penological\n\npurpose, is considered a form of punishment proscribed by the\n\nEighth Amendment. Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 103 (1976). The\n\nEighth Amendment is meant to prohibit \"unnecessary and wanton\n\ninfliction of pain,\" which is \"repugnant to the conscience of\n\nmankind.\"    Id. at 105-06 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            The Amendment's focus on punishment means that not all\n\nshortages or failures in care exhibit the intent and harmfulness\n\nrequired to fall within its ambit.         See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837\n\n(reasoning that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of punishment\n\nimplies an act done with intentionality).       Therefore, to prove an\n\nEighth Amendment violation, a prisoner must satisfy both of two\n\nprongs:     (1) an objective prong that requires proof of a serious\n\nmedical need, and (2) a subjective prong that mandates a showing of\n\nprison administrators' deliberate indifference to that need.           See\n\nEstelle, 429 U.S. at 106 (holding that inadequate treatment must be\n\n\"sufficiently    harmful   to   evidence   deliberate   indifference    to\n\nserious medical needs\"); Sires v. Berman, 834 F.2d 9, 12 (1st Cir.\n\n1987) (\"A plaintiff must satisfy two elements to present a viable\n\n[Eighth Amendment] claim: he must show a serious medical need, and\n\nhe must prove the defendant's purposeful indifference thereto.\").\n\n\n                                   -37-\n\f              First, a medical need must be \"serious.\"                      Id.     This\n\nobjective prong requires that the need be \"one that has been\n\ndiagnosed by a physician as mandating treatment, or one that is so\n\nobvious that even a lay person would easily recognize the necessity\n\nfor a doctor's attention.\"                Gaudreault v. Municipality of Salem,\n\nMass., 923 F.2d 203, 208 (1st Cir. 1990).                       This prong does not\n\nimpose upon prison administrators a duty to provide care that is\n\nideal, or of the prisoner's choosing. See United States v. Derbes,\n\n369   F.3d     579,         583   (1st    Cir.     2004)     (stating    that     prison\n\nadministrators are \"by no means required to tailor a perfect plan\n\nfor every inmate; while [they are] constitutionally obligated to\n\nprovide medical services to inmates, these services need only be on\n\na level reasonably commensurate with modern medical science and of\n\na   quality       acceptable       within    prudent        professional    standards\"\n\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted)); United States v.\n\nDeCologero, 821 F.2d 39, 43 (1st Cir. 1987) (same); Ferranti v.\n\nMoran, 618 F.2d 888, 891 (1st Cir. 1980) (\"[A]llegations [that]\n\nsimply   reflect        a    disagreement        on   the    appropriate    course   of\n\ntreatment     .    .    .    fall[]      short   of   alleging     a    constitutional\n\nviolation.\").          Rather, the Constitution proscribes care that is\n\n\"'so inadequate as to shock the conscience.'\"                    Torraco v. Maloney,\n\n\n\n\n                                            -38-\n\f923 F.2d 231, 235 (1st Cir. 1991) (quoting Sires, 834 F.2d at\n\n13)).7\n\n          Second, even if medical care is so inadequate as to\n\nsatisfy the objective prong, the Eighth Amendment is not violated\n\nunless prison administrators also exhibit deliberate indifference\n\nto the prisoner's needs.     Estelle, 429 U.S. at 105-06.      For\n\npurposes of this subjective prong, deliberate indifference \"defines\n\na narrow band of conduct,\" Feeney v. Corr. Med. Servs. Inc., 464\n\nF.3d 158, 162   (1st Cir. 2006), and requires evidence that the\n\nfailure in treatment was purposeful.   See Estelle, 429 U.S. at 105\n\n(holding that \"an inadvertent failure to provide adequate medical\n\ncare\" is not a constitutional violation);8 id. at 106 (\"Medical\n\nmalpractice does not become a constitutional violation merely\n\nbecause the victim is a prisoner.\"); Watson v. Caton, 984 F.2d 537,\n\n540 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"The courts have consistently refused to\n\n\n7\n  Although these cases address the second, subjective prong of the\nEighth Amendment analysis, we have recognized that \"the subjective\ndeliberate indifference inquiry may overlap with the objective\nserious medical need determination\" and that \"similar evidence\n. . . may be relevant to both components.\" Leavitt v. Corr. Med.\nServs., Inc., 645 F.3d 484, 498 (1st Cir. 2011) (internal quotation\nmarks and brackets omitted); see also DesRosiers v. Moran, 949 F.2d\n15, 18-19 (1st Cir. 1991). As the adequacy of care is germane both\nto Kosilek's objective need for surgery and to the DOC's alleged\ndeliberate indifference to that need, the principles of these cases\nare relevant to both steps of our analysis.\n8\n   Although this case does not involve \"an inadvertent failure to\nprovide adequate medical care,\" see Estelle, 429 U.S. at 106, that\nfact alone does not elevate the DOC's choice among alternative\ntreatments to \"deliberate indifference\" for purposes of the Eighth\nAmendment analysis.\n\n                               -39-\n\fcreate constitutional claims out of disagreements between prisoners\n\nand doctors about the proper course of a prisoner's medical\n\ntreatment, or to conclude that simple medical malpractice rises to\n\nthe level of cruel and unusual punishment.\").                  \"The obvious case\n\nwould be a denial of needed medical treatment in order to punish\n\nthe   inmate.\"      Watson,      984   F.2d    at    540.      While    deliberate\n\nindifference may also be exhibited by a \"wanton disregard\" to a\n\nprisoner's needs,     Battista v. Clarke, 645 F.3d 449, 453 (1st Cir.\n\n2011), such disregard must be akin to criminal recklessness,\n\nrequiring consciousness of \"'impending harm, easily preventable.'\"\n\nWatson, 984 F.2d at 540.\n\n           When evaluating medical care and deliberate indifference,\n\nsecurity   considerations        inherent      in    the     functioning      of   a\n\npenological      institution      must    be   given        significant      weight.\n\nBattista, 645 F.3d at 454 (\"[S]ecurity considerations also matter\n\nat prisons . . . and administrators have to balance conflicting\n\ndemands.\").   \"[W]ide-ranging          deference\"     is    accorded    to   prison\n\nadministrators \"in the adoption and execution of policies and\n\npractices that in their judgement are needed to . . . maintain\n\ninstitutional security.\"         Whitley v.

In consequence, even a denial\n\nof care may not amount to an Eighth Amendment violation if that\n\ndecision is based in legitimate concerns regarding prisoner safety\n\n\n                                       -40-\n\fand institutional security. Cameron v. Tomes, 990 F.2d 14, 20 (1st\n\nCir.     1993)       (requiring     courts      to       \"embrace          security      and\n\nadministration, . . . not merely medical judgments\" in assessing\n\nclaims    of     deliberate     indifference);       Sires,          834    F.2d    at    13\n\n(\"[S]afety factors are properly included in the evaluation of the\n\nmedical needs of an inmate.\").

Standard of Review\n\n               The test for establishing an Eighth Amendment claim of\n\ninadequate medical care encompasses a multitude of questions                          that\n\npresent elements both factual and legal.                   Review of such \"mixed\n\nquestions\" is of a variable exactitude; the more law-based a\n\nquestion, the less deferentially we assess the district court's\n\nconclusion.      In Re Extradition of Howard, 996 F.2d 1320, 1328 (1st\n\nCir. 1993) (\"The standard of review applicable to mixed questions\n\nusually depends upon where they fall along the degree-of-deference\n\ncontinuum . . . .\").\n\n               The   ultimate     legal     conclusion          of    whether       prison\n\nadministrators have violated the Eighth Amendment is reviewed de\n\nnovo.

The Objective Prong: Serious Medical Need\n\n              To sustain a claim under the objective prong of the\n\nEighth Amendment, Kosilek must show that she has a serious medical\n\nneed for which she has received inadequate treatment. See Estelle,\n\n429 U.S. at 106; Sires, 834 F.2d at 13 (finding no Eighth Amendment\n\nviolation where the prisoner failed to \"present[] any evidence of\n\na serious medical need that has gone unmet\"); see also Derbes, 369\n\nF.3d at 583 (a prison's constitutional obligation to provide\n\nmedical services does not require \"a perfect plan for every\n\ninmate\"); DeCologero, 821 F.2d at 42 (\"[T]hough it is plain that an\n\ninmate deserves adequate medical care, he cannot insist that his\n\ninstitutional host provide him with the most sophisticated care\n\nthat money can buy.\").        A significant risk of future harm that\n\nprison administrators fail to mitigate may suffice under the\n\nobjective prong.     Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 35 (1993); see\n\nalso   Baze    v.   Rees,   553   U.S.   35,   50   (2008)   (\"[S]ubjecting\n\nindividuals to a risk of future harm . . . can qualify as cruel and\n\nunusual punishment.\"); Roe v.

Farnham, 394 F.3d 469, 479 (7th Cir. 2005))).\n\n             That GID is a serious medical need, and one which\n\nmandates treatment, is not in dispute in this case. The parties do\n\nnot spar over the fact that Kosilek requires medical care aimed at\n\nalleviating the harms associated with GID -- to the contrary, the\n\nDOC has provided such care since 2003.              Rather, the parties\n\ndisagree over whether SRS is a medically necessary component of\n\nKosilek's care, such that any course of treatment not including\n\nsurgery is constitutionally inadequate.           The parties' disparate\n\npositions on this issue are fit for succinct summary.\n\n             Kosilek argues that the only constitutionally sufficient\n\ntreatment regimen is to adhere to the Standards of Care's triadic\n\nsequence   in    full,   including   the    provision   of   SRS.   Kosilek\n\nemphasizes that doctors at both UMass and Fenway Clinic -- doctors\n\nhired by the DOC -- confirmed at trial that SRS was \"medically\n\nnecessary.\"      The failure to provide treatment, these doctors\n\ntestified, would almost certainly lead to a deterioration in\n\nKosilek's mental state and a high likelihood of self-harming\n\nbehaviors.      In light of this risk, and given that they believed\n\nKosilek had successfully met all eligibility criteria for SRS,\n\n\n                                     -46-\n\fthese doctors believed that any course of treatment excluding SRS\n\nis insufficient to treat Kosilek's GID.\n\n          In contrast, the DOC argues that full progression through\n\nthe Standards of Care's triadic sequence is not the only adequate\n\ntreatment option, as Kosilek's GID may be appropriately managed\n\nwith treatment short of SRS.   The DOC maintains that the evidence\n\ndoes not meet the standards for negligent treatment of a medical\n\ncondition, much less the higher Eighth Amendment standard.      See\n\nEstelle, 429 U.S. at 106 (\"Thus, a complaint that a physician has\n\nbeen negligent in diagnosing or treating a medical condition does\n\nnot state a valid claim of medical mistreatment under the Eighth\n\nAmendment.\"); Watson, 984 F.2d at 540 (stating that \"simple medical\n\nmalpractice\" does not \"rise[] to the level of cruel and unusual\n\npunishment\").\n\n          Relying   on   the    advice    of   accredited   medical\n\nprofessionals, the DOC argues that its alternative course of\n\ntreatment -- which provides Kosilek such alleviative measures as\n\npsychotherapy, hormones, electrolysis, and the provision of female\n\ngarb and accessories -- is sufficient to treat Kosilek's GID and\n\nfar exceeds a level of care that would be \"so inadequate as to\n\nshock the conscience.\"    See Torraco, 923 F.2d at 235 (quoting\n\nSires, 834 F.2d at 13). Moreover, this course of treatment has, in\n\npractice, greatly diminished Kosilek's mental distress and allowed\n\nher a fair measure of contentment.    Should suicidal ideation arise\n\n\n                               -47-\n\fin the future, the DOC contends that -- based on the advice of its\n\nmedical experts and its own penological experience -- it would be\n\nable   to    address    that    future      risk      appropriately      through\n\npsychotherapy and antidepressants.\n\n            We begin by discussing the district court's conclusions\n\nregarding the objective prong.              We then examine de novo the\n\nquestion    whether    the   treatment      offered    was   constitutionally\n\nadequate.\n\n            1.    The district court's medical prudence determination\n\n            The   district   court   ruled     that    SRS   was   a   medically\n\nnecessary treatment, and that Dr. Schmidt's alternative belief was\n\noutside the bounds of medical prudence.9               However, the court's\n\nfinding that Dr. Schmidt's views were medically imprudent was based\n\non several erroneous determinations.\n\n            First, the court ruled that, unlike prudent medical\n\nprofessionals, Dr. Schmidt did not \"follow\" the Standards of Care\n\nin his treatment of GID.       This finding ignored critical nuance in\n\nDr. Schmidt's testimony and based its conclusion on a severely\n\nstrained reading of Dr. Levine's expert testimony.\n\n\n\n\n9\n  For the sake of clarity, we reiterate that medical imprudence --\nwithout more -- is insufficient to establish an Eighth Amendment\nviolation. See Estelle, 429 U.S. at 105-06; Watson, 984 F.2d at\n540. Instead, a prisoner must satisfy both prongs of the Eighth\nAmendment inquiry, proving that the level of care provided is\n\"sufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate indifference to\nserious medical needs.\" Estelle, 429 U.S. at 106.\n\n                                     -48-\n\f              As an initial matter, the Standards of Care themselves\n\nadmit    of   significant     flexibility   in   their    interpretation   and\n\napplication.      They state, for example, that \"[t]he Standards of\n\nCare [a]re Clinical Guidelines\" and are \"intended to provide\n\nflexible directions\" to medical professionals in crafting treatment\n\nplans.    Standards of Care at 1 (emphases added).           The Standards of\n\nCare also specifically warn that \"[a]ll readers should be aware of\n\nthe limitations of knowledge in this area.\"              Standards of Care at\n\n1.       \"Individual   professionals    and      organized    programs,\"   the\n\nStandards of Care continue on, \"may modify [the standards]\" as\n\nappropriate.      Id. at 2.    Dr. Levine's testimony acknowledged this\n\nflexibility:\n\n              [DR. LEVINE]: [T]he \"Standards of Care\" was a\n              consensus document from people from seven\n              different countries or something, you know,\n              who come from different systems, and it was a\n              political process that forged together a set\n              of standards . . . .      So \"prudent\" is a\n              wonderful word, but it's not like it has one\n              simple definition.\n\n              . . .\n\n              THE COURT: But is this an area in which you\n              think prudent professionals can reasonably\n              differ as to what is at least minimally\n              adequate treatment for this condition?\n\n              [DR. LEVINE]: Yes, and do.\n\n\n              Moreover, the district court put great weight on the fact\n\nthat the Standards of Care require that patients receive two\n\nletters of recommendation prior to SRS.               The court concluded,\n\n                                     -49-\n\ftherefore,    that   \"prudent    professionals     who   treat   individuals\n\nsuffering from severe gender identity disorders write such letters\n\nof recommendation,\" and it faulted Dr. Schmidt as imprudent for his\n\nfailure to engage in this practice.          In so doing, the court relied\n\non Dr. Levine's testimony, which it believed stated that a prudent\n\nprofessional       would   not    \"[refuse]      to   write      letters     of\n\nrecommendation.\"\n\n             Dr.   Schmidt's    testimony,    however,   makes    clear    that\n\nalthough he does not advocate or recommend surgery to his patients,\n\nif a patient chooses to seek SRS, he releases all of their medical\n\nfiles to a surgeon and writes that surgeon a letter confirming that\n\nthe patient is eligible for surgery.           Insofar as Dr. Schmidt had\n\nnot advocated for the surgery, this neutrality aligns with what Dr.\n\nLevine describes as the accepted practice for doctors in the\n\ntreatment of GID: \"[i]f the patient meets eligibility requirements\n\n. . . we then write a letter of support . . . I understand how\n\nothers may perceive this as a recommendation . . . [but] we tell\n\nourselves we are opening a gate to their decision.\"               Therefore,\n\nwhatever the semantic force of the district court's distinction, we\n\nsee no material difference between the letters written by Dr.\n\nSchmidt confirming a patient's readiness for surgery and what the\n\nStandards of Care refers to as a letter of recommendation.\n\n             The district court next concluded that Dr. Schmidt was\n\nimprudent because antidepressants and psychotherapy alone are\n\n\n                                    -50-\n\finadequate to treat GID.    Again, the court claimed that it relied\n\non the testimony of Dr. Levine, but misconstrued his testimony in\n\nsupport of its conclusion.       Dr. Levine did in fact state that\n\n\"gender dysphoria is not significantly ameliorated . . . by\n\ntreating [patients] with a prozac-like drug alone.\"          He continued\n\non, however, to explain that he did not believe this was the\n\ntreatment plan advocated by Dr. Schmidt or the DOC.                To the\n\ncontrary, he understood that Kosilek would continue to receive\n\nameliorative treatment for her GID and, if she entered a depressive\n\nor   suicidal   state   based   on    her   inability   to   receive   SRS,\n\nantidepressants and psychotherapy would be used to help stabilize\n\nher mental state so as to alleviate the risk of suicide while\n\nworking with her to craft new perspectives and life goals beyond\n\nsurgery.   He felt that the treatment might well be successful in\n\nthis capacity, when combined with the direct alleviative treatments\n\ncurrently provided.\n\n           Finally, the district court found Dr. Schmidt imprudent\n\nbecause he did not believe that a real-life experience could occur\n\nin prison, given that it was an isolated, single-sex environment.\n\nThe district court disagreed, stating that it had concluded a real-\n\nlife experience could occur in prison, as Kosilek would remain\n\nincarcerated for her entire life.       In reaching this determination,\n\nthe court made a significantly flawed inferential leap: it relied\n\non its own -- non-medical -- judgment about what constitutes a\n\n\n                                     -51-\n\freal-life experience to conclude that Dr. Schmidt's differing\n\nviewpoint      was     illegitimate      or     imprudent.          Prudent    medical\n\nprofessionals, however, do reasonably differ in their opinions\n\nregarding the requirements of a real-life experience -- and this\n\nreasonable difference in medical opinions is sufficient to defeat\n\nKosilek's argument.           Cf. Bismark v. Fisher, 213 F. App'x 892, 897\n\n(11th   Cir.     2007)       (\"Nothing   in   our   case     law    would     derive   a\n\nconstitutional deprivation from a prison physician's failure to\n\nsubordinate his own professional judgment to that of another doctor\n\n. . . .\"); Estate of Cole by Pardue v. Fromm, 94 F.3d 254, 261 (7th\n\nCir. 1996); Bowring v. Godwin, 551 F.2d 44, 48 (4th Cir. 1977).\n\n            In       fact,    Dr.    Levine     noted   that       an   incarcerative\n\nenvironment might well be insufficient to expose Kosilek to the\n\nvariety of societal, familial, and vocational pressures foreseen by\n\na real-life experience.             This viewpoint aligned with that of Dr.\n\nSchmidt and Osborne.           And, although Dr. Forstein's written report\n\nappears to presume Kosilek had completed a real-life experience, it\n\nechoed this same point: \"being in prison has helped [Kosilek]\n\nconsolidate her desire . . . simplifying the issues, without the\n\nstressors and choices that she would have had to make out in the\n\noutside real world.\"           We find no support for the district court's\n\nconclusion that no reasonable medical expert could opine that\n\nKosilek lacked real-life experience, particularly in light of the\n\ncontrary testimony from medical experts concerning the range of\n\n\n                                         -52-\n\fsocial, environmental, and professional considerations that are\n\nnecessary to constitute a real-life experience under the Standards\n\nof Care.     The district court thus erred by substituting its own\n\nbeliefs for those of multiple medical experts.10\n\n             The district court's finding of medical imprudence relied\n\nheavily on inferences we do not believe can rightly be drawn from\n\nDr. Levine's testimony; this finding also ignored significant\n\ncontrary evidence regarding the breadth and variety of acceptable\n\ntreatments for GID within the medical community.11       Its conclusion\n\nthat   the   Fenway   Center's   recommendation   constituted   the   sole\n\nacceptable treatment plan is, thus, contradicted by the record.\n\n\n\n10\n    There are obvious reasons for the range of judgments in this\narea.    Although the medical experts disagreed over whether\nexperience in a prison setting could qualify as real-life\nexperience, none of the experts who opined that it could do so\nappear to have considered the fact that after SRS, Kosilek would\nmost likely be housed in the drastically different setting of a\nfemale facility. This distinction was reflected in Dr. Forstein's\nreport, which stated that \"[Kosilek's] 'real life experience' leads\nher to the conclusion that so long as she is in a male prison . . .\nshe cannot perceive herself as a true woman.\"       This statement\nacknowledges that any real-life experience available to Kosilek was\nshaped by her current, all-male prison environment.         Kosilek\nintroduced no evidence to show that her experience there would\nsatisfy the requirement that she have real-life experience in her\npost-operative housing environment.\n11\n   The district court ignored or minimized significant portions of\nDr. Levine's testimony on the theory that the doctor had based his\nevaluation of medical prudence on the \"erroneous assumption[]\" that\nKosilek may not have had a real-life experience in prison and faced\nno other extrinsic obstacles to surgery. As explained above, in\ndoing so the court improperly supplanted a question of medical\nopinion -- on which experts may differ -- with its own decision\nbased on a layman's view, and terming all contrary views imprudent.\n\n                                   -53-\n\f           2.    Adequacy of the DOC's treatment plan\n\n           Regarding the medical adequacy of Kosilek's treatment,\n\nthe district court held that psychotherapy and antidepressants\n\nalone would not adequately treat Kosilek's GID.              This finding\n\nmischaracterizes the issues on appeal and unduly minimizes the\n\nnature of the DOC's preferred treatment plan.          The DOC does not\n\nclaim   that    treating   Kosilek's   GID   merely   with   therapy   and\n\nantidepressants alone would constitute adequate care.          Cf. Fields\n\nv. Smith, 653 F.3d 550, 556 (7th Cir. 2011) (accepting, in the\n\nabsence of contrary evidence, expert testimony that \"psychotherapy\n\nas well as antipsychotics and antidepressants . . . do nothing to\n\ntreat the underlying disorder [of GID]\").       In fact, since Kosilek\n\nI the DOC has acknowledged the need to directly treat Kosilek's\n\nGID.    Beginning in 2003, it has provided hormones, electrolysis,\n\nfeminine clothing and accessories, and mental health services aimed\n\nat alleviating her distress.     The parties agree that this care has\n\nled to a real and marked improvement in Kosilek's mental state.\n\nThere is also no dispute that this care would continue, whether or\n\nnot SRS is provided.\n\n           The question before our court, therefore, is not whether\n\nantidepressants and psychotherapy alone are sufficient to treat\n\nGID, or whether GID constitutes a serious medical need.           Rather,\n\nthe question is whether the decision not to provide SRS -- in light\n\nof the continued provision of all ameliorative measures currently\n\n\n                                  -54-\n\fafforded    Kosilek    and    in     addition     to     antidepressants      and\n\npsychotherapy -- is sufficiently harmful to Kosilek so as to\n\nviolate the Eighth Amendment.        It is not.        See Smith v. Carpenter,\n\n316 F.3d 178, 186 (2d Cir. 2003) (\"[I]t's the particular risk of\n\nharm faced by a prisoner due to the challenged deprivation of care,\n\nrather than the severity of the prisoner's underlying medical\n\ncondition, considered in the abstract, that is relevant for Eighth\n\nAmendment purposes.\"); see also Estelle, 429 U.S. at 106 (requiring\n\nproof of \"acts or omissions sufficiently harmful\" as to illustrate\n\ndeliberate indifference to a serious medical need); Estate of\n\nBearden ex rel. Bearden v. Anglin, 543 F. App'x 918, 921 (11th Cir.\n\n2013); Leavitt, 645 F.3d at 497.\n\n            Kosilek admits that the DOC's current treatment regimen\n\nhas led to a significant stabilization in her mental state.\n\nKosilek's doctors testified to the same, highlighting her \"joy\n\naround being feminized.\"           This claim is also borne out by the\n\npassage    of   significant   time    since     she    exhibited   symptoms   of\n\nsuicidal ideation or attempted to self-castrate.               In addition to\n\nalleviating her depressive state, this treatment has also resulted\n\nin   significant   physical   changes       and   an    increasingly   feminine\n\nappearance.\n\n            The significance of a future risk of suicidality is not\n\none that this court takes lightly, and Kosilek is right to note\n\nthat a clear risk of future harm may suffice to sustain an Eighth\n\n\n                                     -55-\n\fAmendment claim.      See Helling, 509 U.S. at 35 (determining that an\n\n\"unreasonable   risk\"       of   future   harm   may   amount   to     an   Eighth\n\nAmendment violation); Baze, 553 U.S. at 49; Roe, 631 F.3d at 858.\n\nNonetheless, the risk of suicidal ideation is born from Kosilek's\n\nGID-related mental distress.              Therefore an assessment of the\n\ngravity of that risk, and its appropriate treatment, must encompass\n\nthe entirety of the DOC's treatment plan, not merely the potential\n\naddition of psychotherapy and antidepressants.\n\n            Kosilek    is    provided     hormones,    facial   hair    removal,\n\nfeminine clothing and accessories, and access to regular mental\n\nhealth treatment.      The DOC also stands ready to protect Kosilek\n\nfrom the potential for self-harm by employing its standard and\n\naccepted methods of treating any prisoner exhibiting suicidal\n\nideation.   Trial testimony established that this plan offers real\n\nand direct treatment for Kosilek's GID.           It employs methods proven\n\nto alleviate Kosilek's mental distress while crafting a plan to\n\nminimize the risk of future harm.          See Carpenter, 316 F.3d at 186.\n\nIt does not wantonly disregard Kosilek's needs, but accounts for\n\nthem.   See Torraco, 923 F.2d at 235.\n\n            The law is clear that where two alternative courses of\n\nmedical treatment exist, and both alleviate negative effects within\n\nthe boundaries of modern medicine, it is not the place of our court\n\nto \"second guess medical judgments\" or to require that the DOC\n\nadopt the more compassionate of two adequate options.                   Layne v.\n\n\n                                      -56-\n\fVinzant, 657 F.2d 468, 474 (1st Cir. 1981) (quoting Westlake v.\n\nLucas, 537 F.2d 857, 860 n.5 (6th Cir. 1976)); Bismark, 213 F.\n\nApp'x at 897; Medrano v. Smith, 161 F. App'x 596, 599 (7th Cir.\n\n2006); Sanchez v. Vild, 891 F.2d 240, 242 (9th Cir. 1989); Bowring,\n\n551 F.2d at 48.\n\n          That the DOC has chosen one of two alternatives -- both\n\nof which are reasonably commensurate with the medical standards of\n\nprudent professionals, and both of which provide Kosilek with a\n\nsignificant measure of relief -- is a decision that does not\n\nviolate the Eighth Amendment.12\n\n          Kosilek warns, however, that upholding the adequacy of\n\nthe DOC's course of treatment in this case -- despite her medical\n\n\n\n12\n   This holding in no way suggests that correctional administrators\nwishing to avoid treatment need simply to find a single\npractitioner willing to attest that some well-accepted treatment is\nnot necessary. We do not establish here a per se rule allowing a\ndissenting medical opinion to carry the day.           Rather, our\ndetermination is limited to the particular record on appeal, which\ninvolves a medical condition that admits of a number of valid\ntreatment options.    This fact was testified to by Dr. Levine,\nrecognized by the UMass doctors in their correspondence with the\nDOC, and corroborated by Dr. Forstein in his written report.\n\n   The DOC did not engage in a frenzy of serial consultations aimed\nat finding the one doctor out of a hundred willing to testify that\nSRS was not medically necessary.     Rather, it made a considered\ndecision to seek out a second opinion from an expert previously\nconsidered in its initial selection process. Our opinion rests on\nthe facts presented in this record, and we find merely that the\nregimen of care provided by the DOC -- which includes hormonal\ntreatments as well as feminine products, clothing, and hair\nremoval, and which has successfully alleviated the severity of a\nprisoner's distress -- is not sufficiently harmful to Kosilek to\nconstitute an Eighth Amendment violation.\n\n                                  -57-\n\fhistory and record of good behavior -- will create a de facto ban\n\nagainst SRS as a medical treatment for any incarcerated individual.\n\nWe do not agree.    For one, the DOC has specifically disclaimed any\n\nattempt to create a blanket policy regarding SRS. We are confident\n\nthat the DOC will abide by this assurance, as any such policy would\n\nconflict with the requirement that medical care be individualized\n\nbased on a particular prisoner's serious medical needs. See, e.g.,\n\nRoe, 631 F.3d at 862-63 (holding that the failure to conduct an\n\nindividualized assessment of a prisoner's needs may violate the\n\nEighth Amendment).\n\n           For another, this case presents unique circumstances; we\n\nare simply unconvinced that our decision on the record before us\n\ntoday will foreclose all litigants from successfully seeking SRS in\n\nthe future.     Certain facts in this particular record -- including\n\nthe medical providers' non-uniform opinions regarding the necessity\n\nof SRS, Kosilek's criminal history, and the feasibility of post-\n\noperative housing -- were important factors impacting the decision.\n\nD.   The Subjective Prong: Deliberate Indifference\n\n           1.    The DOC's reliance on medical experts\n\n           The subjective element of an Eighth Amendment claim for\n\ninjunctive relief requires not only that Kosilek show that the\n\ntreatment she received was constitutionally inadequate, but also\n\nthat the DOC was -- and continues to be -- deliberately indifferent\n\n\n\n\n                                 -58-\n\fto her serious risk of harm.         See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 844-45.13              On\n\nthe record presented, this is a burden Kosilek cannot meet.                      Even\n\nif   the   district   court    had        been    correct    in    its    erroneous\n\ndetermination that SRS was the only medically adequate treatment\n\nfor Kosilek's GID, the next relevant inquiry would be whether the\n\nDOC also knew or should have known this fact, but nonetheless\n\nfailed to respond in an appropriate manner.               See Wilson v. Seiter,\n\n501 U.S. 294, 298 (1991).          In answering this question, it is not\n\nthe district court's own belief about medical necessity that\n\ncontrols, but what was known and understood by prison officials in\n\ncrafting   their   policy.         Id.   at     300   (requiring   a     showing    of\n\npurposefulness or intent on the part of prison administrators).\n\n            In this case, the DOC solicited the opinion of multiple\n\nmedical    professionals     and    was    ultimately       presented     with     two\n\nalternative treatment plans, which were each developed by different\n\nmedical experts to mitigate the severity of Kosilek's mental\n\ndistress. The choice of a medical option that, although disfavored\n\nby some in the field, is presented by competent professionals does\n\n\n13\n     Although the DOC has not specifically argued that the\nconflicting medical opinions preclude a finding of subjective\ndeliberate indifference, we do not find this argument waived. As\nwe have explained above, the subjective and objective analyses\noverlap. See supra note 7; see also Leavitt, 645 F.3d at 498. The\nDOC's contention that the district court erred in deeming SRS\nmedically necessary and in rejecting Dr. Schmidt's approach as\nimprudent necessarily entails the DOC's subjective belief that SRS\nwas unnecessary. The contrary position -- i.e., that SRS is not\nobjectively necessary but that the DOC did not disagree as to the\nneed for SRS -- would be wholly illogical.\n\n                                         -59-\n\fnot exhibit a level of inattention or callousness to a prisoner's\n\nneeds rising to a constitutional violation.14 Cf. Torraco, 923 F.2d\n\nat 234 (\"[T]his court has hesitated to find deliberate indifference\n\nto a serious need '[w]here the dispute concerns not the absence of\n\nhelp, but the choice of a certain course of treatment,' [but]\n\ndeliberate indifference may be found where the attention received\n\nis 'so clearly inadequate as to amount to a refusal to provide\n\nessential care.'\" (internal citations omitted)). Moreover, a later\n\ncourt decision -- ruling that the prison administrators were wrong\n\nin their estimation of the treatment's reasonableness -- does not\n\n\n\n14\n    If the prison itself should have been aware that some of the\nmedical advice it was receiving was imprudent -- that is, if any\nlayperson could have realized that the advice was imprudent -- then\nthe decision to still follow that advice may qualify as deliberate\nindifference. See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 846 n.9 (\"If, for example,\nthe evidence before a district court establishes that an inmate\nfaces an objectively intolerable risk of serious injury, the\ndefendants could not plausibly persist in claiming lack of\nawareness . . . .\"); Hadix v. Johnson, 367 F.3d 513, 526 (6th Cir.\n2004) (\"If [the challenged prison conditions] are found to be\nobjectively unconstitutional, then that finding would also satisfy\nthe subjective prong because the same information that would lead\nto the court's conclusion was available to the prison officials.\").\nThe facts of this case, however, are highly distinct from such a\nscenario.\n\n   Nor did the district court's conclusion render the DOC's\ncontinued refusal to provide SRS deliberately indifferent. On the\ncontrary, the evidence was conflicting as to the medical need for\nSRS. The choice between reasonable medical views was not for the\ndistrict court to make, and the DOC remained entitled to reasonably\nrely on Schmidt's and Osborne's expert opinions. Moreover, even\nassuming arguendo that the DOC was on notice that its treatment was\ninsufficient, the DOC's continued refusal also rested on valid\nsecurity concerns, discussed below, such that its actions did not\namount to deliberate indifference in any event.\n\n                               -60-\n\fsomehow convert that choice into one exhibiting the sort of\n\nobstinacy and disregard required to find deliberate indifference.\n\nCf. Nadeau v. Helgemoe, 561 F.2d 411, 417 (1st Cir. 1977) (refusing\n\nto \"substitute the values and judgment of a court for the values\n\nand judgment of the . . . prison administration\").\n\n               2.    The DOC's security concerns\n\n               The subjective prong also recognizes that, in issues of\n\nsecurity, \"[p]rison administrators . . . should be accorded wide-\n\nranging deference in the adoption and execution of policies and\n\npractices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal\n\norder and discipline and to maintain institutional security.\"\n\nBell,    441    U.S.    at     547.   Although         we   cannot   \"abdicate    our\n\nresponsibility         to    ensure   that       the   limits     imposed   by    the\n\nConstitution are not ignored,\" Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 562\n\n(1st Cir. 1985), we do not sit to substitute our own judgment for\n\nthat of prison administrators, see Nadeau, 561 F.2d at 417.                        As\n\nlong as prison administrators make judgments balancing security and\n\nhealth concerns that are \"within the realm of reason and made in\n\ngood faith,\" their decisions do not amount to a violation of the\n\nEighth Amendment.           Battista, 645 F.3d at 454.\n\n               The DOC officials explained that they believed SRS would\n\ncreate   new        security    issues,   the     most      significant   being   the\n\nprovision of safe housing options for Kosilek after her surgery.\n\nThey further explained the importance of keeping other inmates from\n\n\n                                          -61-\n\fbelieving that they could use threats of suicide to extract\n\nconcessions from the prison administration.               Nonetheless, rather\n\nthan deferring to the expertise of prison administrators, the\n\ndistrict    court   ignored    the    DOC's    stated     security     concerns,\n\nreasoning both that Kosilek could be housed safely and that the DOC\n\nhad not acted out of a legitimate concern for Kosilek's safety and\n\nthe security of the DOC's facilities. As explained below, this was\n\nin error.\n\n                    a. The DOC's concerns about safety and security\n                    were reasonable\n\n            Recognizing    that      reasonable        concerns   would    arise\n\nregarding a post-operative, male-to-female transsexual being housed\n\nwith male prisoners takes no great stretch of the imagination. See\n\nFarmer, 511 U.S. at 848-49 (summarizing evidence that a prison's\n\nrefusal     to   provide   segregated        housing     to   a   pre-operative\n\nmale-to-female      transsexual      could     pose     significant    security\n\nconcerns). At the same time, as particularly relevant in Kosilek's\n\ncase, the DOC's security report reflected that significant concerns\n\nwould also arise from housing a formerly male inmate -- with a\n\ncriminal history of extreme violence against a female domestic\n\npartner -- within a female prison population containing high\n\nnumbers of domestic violence survivors. Nonetheless, in dismissing\n\nthe DOC's concerns, the district court relied heavily on the fact\n\nthat security issues have not yet arisen within MCI-Norfolk's\n\ngeneral     population.       Rejecting       the     testimony   of   multiple\n\n                                     -62-\n\findividuals with decades of penological experience -- all of whom\n\nacknowledged the risk of housing a female prisoner at MCI-Norfolk\n\n-- the district court reasoned that Kosilek's past safety was\n\nindicative of a likelihood that she could reside safely at the\n\nprison after her operation.\n\n             This reasoning wrongly circumvents the deference owed to\n\nprison administrators: the appropriate inquiry was not whether the\n\ncourt believed that Kosilek could be housed safely, but whether the\n\nDOC has a reasoned basis for its stated concerns.                 Indeed, that\n\nKosilek had so far been safe within MCI-Norfolk's prison population\n\ndoes not negate the DOC's well-reasoned belief that safety concerns\n\nwould arise in the future after SRS.        Cf. Jones v. N.C. Prisoners'\n\nLabor Union, 433 U.S. 119, 132-33 & n.9 (1977) (holding, in the\n\nFirst Amendment context, that the rights of prisoners may be\n\nabridged     based   on   a   reasonable   belief   that    future    harm   or\n\ndisruption may occur); cf. Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 526-27\n\n(1984) (requiring prison administrators to implement prophylactic\n\nsolutions to foreseeable security issues reasonably within the\n\nscope   of   their   expertise).      Moreover,     the    fact    that,   pre-\n\noperatively, Kosilek has not been subject to assault or threats\n\ndoes not vitiate the concern that she would be victimized after\n\nreceiving SRS.15\n\n\n15\n   These concerns were obvious to more than just those individuals\nwithin the DOC with significant penological experience.         The\nlikelihood that issues surrounding secure housing would arise after\n\n                                    -63-\n\f           The district court also reasoned that \"the DOC [could]\n\nreasonably assure the safety of Kosilek and others after sex\n\nreassignment surgery by housing Kosilek in a segregated protective\n\ncustody unit.\" It then noted, however, that there existed a strong\n\nargument   that    such   isolation    would     amount   to    \"a     form    of\n\nextrajudicial     punishment    that   is   prohibited     by    the     Eighth\n\nAmendment.\"    This warning echoes the very concerns highlighted by\n\nthe DOC, which expressed disagreement with the use of long-term\n\nisolation as a housing solution for Kosilek, based on its potential\n\nnegative effects on her mental health. See also Battista, 645 F.3d\n\nat 454 (explaining that creating a segregated treatment center to\n\nhouse a GID prisoner would \"pose administrative difficulties and be\n\nisolating\"). The deference awarded to prison administrators cannot\n\nbe defeated by such circular reasoning, which dismisses the DOC's\n\nconcern in one breath only to recognize its validity in the next.\n\n           The prison administrators in this case have decades of\n\ncombined experience in the management of penological institutions,\n\nand it is they, not the court, who are best situated to determine\n\nwhat security concerns will arise.             See Bell, 441 U.S. at 548\n\n(\"[J]udicial      deference    is   accorded    [in   part]     because       the\n\nadministrator ordinarily will . . . have a better grasp of his\n\ndomain than the reviewing judge . . . .\").             The DOC's judgment\n\n\n\nSRS was also acknowledged by Kosilek's treating psychologist, Mark\nBurrows, and by the Fenway Center doctors in their initial report.\n\n                                    -64-\n\fregarding post-operative housing is without doubt \"within the realm\n\nof reason,\" Battista, 645 F.3d at 454, and the district court's\n\nalternative belief as to the possibility of safely housing Kosilek\n\ndoes not suffice to undermine this reasonableness.\n\n          The DOC officials also expressed concern that providing\n\nKosilek SRS would incentivize the use of suicide threats by\n\nprisoners as a means of receiving desired benefits.       Although the\n\ndistrict court determined that, in this case, Kosilek's risk for\n\nsuicidal ideation was very real, this finding does not invalidate\n\nthe DOC's reasonable belief that providing SRS might lead to\n\nproliferation of false threats among other prisoners.\n\n          The DOC's concern -- regarding the unacceptable precedent\n\nthat would be established in dealing with future threats of suicide\n\nby inmates to force the prison authorities to comply with the\n\nprisoners' particular demands -- cannot be discounted as a minor or\n\ninvalid claim.    Such threats are not uncommon in prison settings\n\nand require firm rejection by the authorities, who must be given\n\nample discretion in dealing with such situations.             Given the\n\ncircumstances presented here, we cannot say that the DOC lacks\n\nreasonable security concerns.\n\n                   b.   Deference to the DOC's reasonable concerns\n                   about safety and security\n\n          The    district   court    ultimately   dismissed   the   DOC's\n\nconcerns as pretextual, reasoning that DOC was in fact acting in\n\nresponse to \"public and political criticism.\" The primary evidence\n\n                                    -65-\n\fon record tending to support this theory includes a press interview\n\nby Commissioner Dennehy, Dennehy's relationships with a state\n\nsenator and the lieutenant governor, and the acknowledgment that\n\nthe DOC was aware of negative news coverage regarding Kosilek's\n\nrequest for surgery.\n\n          In her testimony, Dennehy denied being influenced by such\n\nmedia and political pressures, and stated that the decision not to\n\nprovide SRS was founded in bona fide security concerns alone.   The\n\ndistrict court, however, found this testimony non-credible, and\n\nthis credibility finding is the sort of determination to which our\n\ncourt gives deference.     See Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(6).        Even\n\naccepting that Dennehy's motivations were colored by political and\n\nmedia pressure, however, does not take Kosilek's claim as far as it\n\nneeds to go.\n\n          As an initial matter, the fact that Dennehy was motivated\n\nin part by concerns unrelated to prison security does not mean that\n\nthe security concerns articulated by the DOC were irrelevant,\n\nwholly pretextual, or -- most importantly -- invalid on the merits.\n\nIn Battista, our court held that deference to the decisions of\n\nprison administrators could be overcome where those administrators\n\nadmittedly relied on inflated data, identified a security concern\n\nonly several years after refusing to provide treatment for an\n\nacknowledged medical need, and engaged in a pattern of changing\n\npositions and arguments before the court.    Battista, 645 F.3d at\n\n\n                               -66-\n\f455.   Such gross delays and misstatements were not present here.16\n\nRather, the DOC testified consistently that it believed the post-\n\noperative security concerns surrounding Kosilek's treatment were\n\nsignificant and problematic.17   Even if not entitled to deference,\n\nsee id., those concerns still matter insofar as they are reasonable\n\nand valid, and Kosilek did not put on any evidence showing that\n\nthey wholly lacked merit.18\n\n\n16\n   Great weight was placed on the fact that Dennehy told a reporter\nthat there were significant security concerns about post-operative\nhousing three days before she met with Superintendents Spencer and\nBissonnette. The record reveals, however, that discussions about\nhousing had previously occurred at Executive Staff Meetings, and\nDennehy testified that she had conducted phone calls with both\nSuperintendents prior to meeting to formalize their security\nreport.   This timeline, therefore, is far from sufficient to\nestablish that the DOC's security assessments were unprincipled or\ninvalid.\n17\n    That the DOC may have, in the district court's assessment,\nengaged in a pattern of prevarication regarding whether they\nunderstood that SRS was being recommended by UMass as medically\nnecessary, does not undercut the consistency with which they\nidentified safety and security concerns -- concerns which are\nwithin their expert province -- that would arise from the surgery.\n18\n    Kosilek did cross-examine Commissioner Clarke to show that a\ntransgendered prisoner had safely been housed in a Washington State\nprison under his supervision. Left unexplored, however, were the\nnumerous ways in which MCI-Norfolk's environment, facilities, or\npopulation might be distinct from this prison in Washington.\nNeither was there a comparison between that prisoner's criminal\nhistory and the criminal history of Kosilek. That an individual\nwas housed safely by Commissioner Clarke while employed in another\nstate does not rebut Superintendent Bissonnette's testimony that\nmoving her to MCI-Framingham would cause climate problems in that\nparticular prison. See Feeley v. Sampson, 570 F.2d 364, 371 (1st\nCir. 1978) (rejecting uniform housing conditions for detainees,\nwithout regard to their disparate criminal history, because\n\"Constitutional rights cannot be defined in terms of literal\ncomparisons of this nature\").\n\n                                 -67-\n\f              Second,   when   determining     the   appropriateness      of\n\ninjunctive relief, our focus must include \"current attitudes and\n\nconduct.\"      Farmer, 511 U.S. at 845 (\"'[D]eliberate indifference[]\n\nshould be determined in light of the prison authorities' current\n\nattitudes and conduct': their attitudes and conduct at the time\n\nsuit is brought and persisting thereafter.\" (quoting Helling, 509\n\nU.S. at 36)).      Dennehy has not served as DOC Commissioner since\n\n2007.   Given the age of this litigation and the changes in DOC\n\nleadership that have occurred since the suit was filed, the\n\ndistrict court's assumption that Dennehy's attitudes necessarily\n\ncarried over to her successors and governed their actions is\n\nunsupported by the record.        Although consideration of Dennehy's\n\nmotivation is surely relevant, it is insufficient to show that the\n\nDOC continued to be motivated by public pressure even after her\n\ndeparture, or that this is what motivates the DOC presently.\n\n              Indeed, it was Commissioner Clarke -- and not Dennehy --\n\nwho made the decision here.      And the only evidence tending to show\n\nthat Commissioner Clarke may have considered public and political\n\ncriticism were two letters received by Clarke -- who did not\n\nrespond -- from Massachusetts legislators. These letters, however,\n\nrelate almost in their entirety to concerns about the cost of SRS,\n\nand the district court soundly rejected any argument that the DOC,\n\nor   Clarke    specifically,   had   adopted   its   safety   and   security\n\nmeasures as a pretextual means of addressing the cost concerns\n\n\n                                     -68-\n\fraised by state legislators.        Moreover, Clarke was never found by\n\nthe court to be noncredible.19\n\n             The district court improperly imputed its belief that\n\nCommissioner Dennehy had acted out of concern for public and\n\npolitical pressure to its assessment of the motivations of future\n\nDOC Commissioners. This error ignores the requirement, in cases of\n\ninjunctive relief, that a court consider the attitudes and beliefs\n\nof prison administrators at the time of its decision.            Id. at 845-\n\n46.   The effect of this error is particularly clear given that\n\nClarke has now been replaced by Commissioner Spencer, so that\n\nDennehy is now several administrations and more than seven years\n\nremoved from the decisionmaking process.            Without proof that the\n\nDOC remains motivated by pretextual or improper concerns with\n\npublic pressure, even if it was assumed that Dennehy was improperly\n\nmotivated, the district court's finding that injunctive relief was\n\nrequired is unsupportable.\n\n                             III.   Conclusion\n\n             We are not tasked today with deciding whether the refusal\n\nto provide SRS is uncompassionate or less than ideal.               Neither\n\nfinding   would    support   Kosilek's     claims    of   a   constitutional\n\nviolation.      The Eighth Amendment, after all, proscribes only\n\nmedical care so unconscionable as to fall below society's minimum\n\n\n\n19\n   We further note that the DOC has not defended this case based\non cost considerations relating to the provision of SRS.\n\n                                    -69-\n\fstandards of decency.       See Estelle, 429 U.S. at 102-05.              In this\n\ncase, the DOC has chosen to provide a form of care that offers\n\ndirect treatment for Kosilek's GID.              Cf. Leavitt, 645 F.3d at 498\n\n(acknowledging that the effects of treatment decisions may be\n\nrelevant to consideration of the subjective component of the Eighth\n\nAmendment).     Moreover, it has done so in light of the fact that\n\nprovision of SRS would create new and additional security concerns\n\n-- concerns that do not presently arise from its current treatment\n\nregimen.\n\n            Given the positive effects of Kosilek's current regimen\n\nof care, and the DOC's plan to treat suicidal ideation should it\n\narise, the DOC's decision not to provide SRS does not illustrate\n\nsevere     obstinacy   or    disregard      of    Kosilek's     medical     needs.\n\nDesRosiers, 949 F.2d at 19 (\"[T]he complainant must prove that the\n\ndefendants had a culpable state of mind and intended wantonly to\n\ninflict pain.\").       Rather, it is a measured response to the valid\n\nsecurity concerns identified by the DOC. Battista, 645 F.3d at 454\n\n(\"Medical    'need'    in   real   life   is     an   elastic   term:     security\n\nconsiderations also matter at prisons. . . .\"); Cameron, 990 F.2d\n\nat 20 (\"Nothing in the Constitution mechanically gives controlling\n\nweight to one set of professional judgments.\").                 Having reviewed\n\nthe record before us, we conclude that Kosilek has failed, on these\n\nfacts, to demonstrate an Eighth Amendment violation.               Accordingly,\n\nwe reverse the district court's order of injunctive relief and\n\n\n                                     -70-\n\fremand this case to the district court with instructions to dismiss\n\nthe case.\n\n            Reversed and Remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                    -Dissenting Opinions Follow-\n\n\n\n\n                                -71-\n\f           THOMPSON, Circuit Judge, dissenting.         The majority turns\n\na blind eye to binding precedent, opting instead to cobble together\n\nlaw from other circuits and non-Eighth Amendment jurisprudence to\n\nformulate a standard of review that, though articulated as one of\n\nvariable exactitude, amounts to sweeping de novo review.                Armed\n\nwith the ability to take a fresh look at findings that clearly\n\nwarranted deference, the majority easily steps into the trial\n\njudge's shoes -- the inarguable superiority of the judge's ability\n\nto marshal facts, assess motive, and gauge credibility all but\n\nforgotten. The parameters set by the majority foretold the result.\n\nIt concludes that the Massachusetts Department of Correction did\n\nnot   violate   Michelle    Kosilek's   constitutional     rights.      That\n\nconclusion is erroneous, the majority's analytical path to it is\n\nmisguided, and the fact that this case is even subject to en banc\n\nscrutiny in the first place is wrong.       And so I dissent.\n\n                             I. En Banc Grant\n\n           The criteria for en banc relief are clear: it is not a\n\nfavored form of relief, and ordinarily should not be ordered unless\n\n\"(1) en banc consideration is necessary to secure or maintain\n\nuniformity of the court's decisions; or (2) the proceeding involves\n\na question of exceptional importance.\"       Fed. R. App. P. 35(a).       My\n\ncolleagues'     reasons    for   granting   en   banc    review   are    not\n\narticulated, but it seems clear that the maintenance of uniformity\n\npiece is not in play.      Therefore I can only assume they perceive an\n\n\n                                   -72-\n\fissue   of    exceptional    importance.         This   justification      is\n\nproblematic.\n\n             As my colleague has explained in a series of thoughtful\n\ndissents, in this circuit there has been what some might see \"as\n\nthe recurring unprincipled denial and granting of petitions for\n\nrehearing en banc, without any attempt to define and apply a set of\n\nobjective criteria to determine when a case is of exceptional\n\nimportance.\"    Kolbe v. BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP, 738 F.3d 432,\n\n474 (1st Cir. 2013) (Torruella, J., dissenting); see also Igartúa\n\nv. United States, 654 F.3d 99, 105 (1st Cir. 2011) (Torruella, J.,\n\nfiling opinion concerning denial of en banc consideration); United\n\nStates v. Vega-Santiago, 519 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2008) (Torruella,\n\nJ., dissenting).     I am at a loss to see what objective criteria\n\nwarranted review in this case.\n\n             While the relief ordered by the district court, and\n\naffirmed by a majority of the original panel, was unprecedented,\n\nKosilek's case is not a legally complicated one.            Rather it is a\n\nfact-intensive    dispute,   which    required   the    original   panel   to\n\ndetermine whether the district court's take on the significant\n\namount of evidence, and its ultimate holding as to the existence of\n\nan Eighth Amendment violation, was erroneous.           I fail to see what\n\nin this framework made this case worthy of en banc review.\n\n             I am not implying this case is unimportant.                This\n\nlitigation is significant to Kosilek, the DOC, and many others, and\n\n\n                                     -73-\n\fthe rights afforded under the Eighth Amendment are crucial. But if\n\nthose things alone were enough, nearly every case would attract the\n\nfull court's attention.   And a good deal more cases would be heard\n\nen banc if disagreeing with the result reached by the original\n\npanel, or simply desiring to weigh in, were valid grounds for\n\nawarding en banc review. They are not, but unfortunately I suspect\n\nthey were the grounds that carried the day here. See, e.g., Kolbe,\n\n738 F.3d at 474 (Torruella, J., dissenting) (\"En banc consideration\n\nis not for the purpose of correcting panel decisions.\") (citing\n\nCalderón   v. Thompson, 523 U.S. 538, 569 (1998) (Souter, J.,\n\ndissenting)).\n\n           This case does not satisfy the well-settled requirements\n\nfor a grant of en banc.     Lamentably, a majority of this court\n\ndecided otherwise.    Similarly, a majority has decided that the\n\ndistrict court got it wrong.     That conclusion is fundamentally\n\nflawed, starting with the level of scrutiny paid to the lower\n\ncourt's decision.\n\n                      II. Standard of Review\n\n           The issue of what standard of review should be employed\n\nis a significant point of divergence for me, and indeed one that\n\npermeates the entirety of my discord with the majority.        The\n\nmajority, undoubtedly aware that it could more handily toss aside\n\nthe district court's findings if it utilized a non-deferential\n\nstandard of review, formulates its standard by borrowing liberally\n\n\n                               -74-\n\ffrom other circuits and non-Eighth Amendment jurisprudence while\n\ndisregarding on-point case law from this circuit.                  The end result\n\nis a standard that, in theory, afforded minimal deference to the\n\nlower court's finding, and in the majority's actual application,\n\nafforded essentially none.\n\n            Let me start with our common ground.                I agree with the\n\nmajority that different standards of review are in play.                         When\n\ndeciding a post-bench-trial appeal, this court takes up questions\n\nof law de novo, but reviews findings of fact for clear error only.\n\nWojciechowicz v. United States, 582 F.3d 57, 66 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\nOn the latter point, this means we accept the court's factual\n\nfindings, and the inferences drawn from those facts, unless the\n\nevidence compels us to conclude a mistake was made.                      Janeiro v.\n\nUrological Surgery Prof'l Ass'n, 457 F.3d 130, 138 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\nWith inquiries that are more of a mixed bag, there is a continuum.\n\nJohnson v. Watts Regulator Co., 63 F.3d 1129, 1132 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\nThe more fact-intensive the question, the more deferential our\n\nreview.     Id.    Conversely, the more law-dominated the query, the\n\nmore likely our review is de novo.               Id.\n\n            That    is     where    the   congruity     ends.      The    majority,\n\nundoubtedly with a certain end result in mind, maneuvers the\n\nstandard    of    review    into    its   most    favorable     form.     While    it\n\ncorrectly    acknowledges          that    factual     and    legal     issues    are\n\nimplicated, the majority utterly favors the de novo end of the\n\n\n                                          -75-\n\fspectrum.20   This approach does not accord with our case law\n\n(although to read the majority you would think we had very little\n\non-point jurisprudence in this circuit).\n\n          For one, the majority posits that the issue of deliberate\n\nindifference is a legal one to be reviewed de novo.     It relies on\n\nFourth Amendment jurisprudence, citing criminal cases that, in the\n\ncontext of deciding the validity of searches and seizures, hold\n\nthat reasonable suspicion and probable cause determinations should\n\nreceive de novo appellate review.      See Ornelas v. United States,\n\n517 U.S. 690, 699 (1996); United States v. Camacho, 661 F.3d 718,\n\n724 (1st Cir. 2011).   I do not see how these cases are analogous to\n\nKosilek's challenge, nor why we should look to Fourth Amendment\n\ncases rather than our Eighth Amendment jurisprudence.\n\n          In the context of the Eighth Amendment, we have explained\n\nthat the existence of deliberate indifference is a \"state-of-mind\n\nissue\" that usually presents a jury question, Torraco v. Maloney,\n\n923 F.2d 231, 234 (1st Cir. 1991), or in other words, an issue for\n\n\n\n20\n   The majority's decision to give little deference to the district\ncourt is undoubtedly a boon to the DOC, and given the DOC's\ngarbled treatment of the standard of review issue on appeal, it is\na downright windfall. In violation of our rules, the DOC did not\ninclude a standard of review in its opening brief. See Fed. R.\nApp. P. 28(a)(8)(B). In its reply brief, the DOC gave us a bit\nmore, arguing that the appropriateness of medical care called for\nde novo review but neglecting to indicate what scrutiny a\ndeliberate indifference finding necessitated. In its petition for\nen banc review, the DOC's position continued to evolve.          It\ncontended that a heightened standard of review should be applied\nbecause this case involves intertwined issues of law and fact.\n\n                                -76-\n\fthe finder of fact. This makes sense. Often intertwined in state-\n\nof-mind issues are determinations about credibility and motivation;\n\nthose are classic examples of the judgment calls to which we give\n\ndeference.     See Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(6) (\"[T]he reviewing court\n\nmust give due regard to the trial court's opportunity to judge the\n\nwitnesses' credibility.\"); Monahan v. Romney, 625 F.3d 42, 46 (1st\n\nCir. 2010). See also Janeiro, 457 F.3d at 138-39 (explaining that,\n\nfollowing a bench trial, \"if the trial court's reading of the\n\nrecord [with respect to an actor's motivation] is plausible,\n\nappellate review is at an end\") (alteration in original).\n\n             The majority recognizes Torraco, citing it for the narrow\n\nproposition     that   \"issues    of   culpability     in    a   deliberate\n\nindifference     inquiry   are   usually   questions   for   a   jury,\"   in\n\nconnection with its discussion about what standard of review\n\nfindings of fact garner. But this is a mischaracterization of what\n\nTorraco held.      Rather, the case states that \"the existence of\n\ndeliberate indifference,\" is a state-of-mind issue, which makes it\n\na typical juror question.         Torraco, 923 F.2d at 234 (emphasis\n\nadded).   The majority's slight spin on this holding allows it to\n\nignore Torraco, and lean on Fourth Amendment jurisprudence instead\n\nto support the notion that deliberate indifference gets a fresh\n\nlook from this court.\n\n             Similarly erroneous is the majority's position that we\n\nreview de novo the district court's ultimate determination as to\n\n\n                                   -77-\n\fwhether an Eighth Amendment violation occurred.         For support it\n\ncites to a series of Eighth Amendment cases from other circuit\n\ncourts.   See, e.g., Thomas v. Bryant, 614 F.3d 1288, 1307 (11th\n\nCir. 2010); Hallett v. Morgan, 296 F.3d 732, 744 (9th Cir. 2002).\n\nAt first blush, there is some surface appeal to this position.      If\n\nnothing else, the existence of a constitutional violation sounds\n\nlike something that would fall closer to the question-of-law end of\n\nthe   spectrum.    The   problem   though   is   that    the   ultimate\n\nconstitutional question is inextricably tied up with the factual\n\ndetails that emerged at trial, the credibility of the witnesses,\n\nand the questions of motivation.      This counsels against pure de\n\nnovo review and our own case law supports this notion.\n\n          As explained above, a state-of-mind issue such as the\n\nexistence of deliberate indifference is typically left to the\n\nfinder of fact.   Torraco, 923 F.2d at 234.      And when reviewing a\n\ntrial judge's determination on the adequacy of medical treatment\n\nfollowing a bench trial, this court has applied the deferential\n\nclearly erroneous standard.   DesRosiers v. Moran, 949 F.2d 15, 19-\n\n20 (1st Cir. 1991).   On top of this, it is well established that\n\n\"elusive issues of motive and intent\" (relevant here in connection\n\nwith the Eighth Amendment's subjective prong) are typically fact-\n\nbound ones subject to the clearly erroneous rule.       Fed. Refinance\n\nCo. v. Klock, 352 F.3d 16, 27-28 (1st Cir. 2003); see also McIntyre\n\nex rel. Estate of McIntyre v. United States, 545 F.3d 27, 40 (1st\n\n\n                               -78-\n\fCir. 2008).      Thus the major pieces of the puzzle in an Eighth\n\nAmendment inquiry -- adequacy of medical care, the existence of\n\ndeliberate indifference, and the parties' motive and intent -- are\n\nsubject to the clearly erroneous standard, making unqualified de\n\nnovo review a bad fit.\n\n           Policy concerns do not counsel otherwise, making the\n\nmajority's reliance on Ornelas, 517 U.S. at 690, a Fourth Amendment\n\ncase, not particularly persuasive.21         Ornelas, which characterized\n\nthe ultimate reasonable suspicion and probable cause determination\n\nas a mixed question of law and fact, decided that de novo review\n\nwas the best fit for its resolution.          Id. at 696-97.   The Supreme\n\nCourt, as the majority points out, emphasized that \"[i]ndependent\n\nreview\" by appellate courts can help \"to maintain control of, and\n\nto clarify, the legal principles\" in reasonable suspicion and\n\nprobable cause cases.    Id. at 697.       While I do not disagree that as\n\nan   appellate   court   we   are   often    required   to   clarify   legal\n\n\n\n\n21\n    The majority also relies on United States v. Bajakajian, 524\nU.S. 321 (1998), an Eighth Amendment excessive punishment and fines\ncase, for the same proposition it cites Ornelas for. Specifically,\nthe majority states that in Bajakajian, the Supreme Court reasoned\nthat the \"'application of a constitutional standard to the facts of\na particular case' . . . may appropriately require de novo\nappellate review to ensure consistency in the law's development.\"\nBajakajian does not say this. The Court there did not address the\nconcept of consistency of the law; it simply cited Ornelas for the\nnarrower proposition that de novo review attaches to the issue of\nwhether a fine is constitutionally excessive. See id. 336, n.10.\nFor that reason I focus on Ornelas.\n\n                                    -79-\n\fprinciples and ensure continuity of the law's development, this is\n\nnot a persuasive justification for employing de novo review here.\n\n           As noted by the dissent in Ornelas, \"[l]aw clarification\n\nrequires   generalization,      and    some   issues   lend   themselves     to\n\ngeneralization much more than others.\"            Id. at 703 (Scalia, J.,\n\ndissenting).     The issues here do not.          Cases dealing with the\n\nconstitutional adequacy of medical care under the Eighth Amendment\n\nare incredibly fact-specific, resulting in distinctive issues. The\n\ntrial   judge   must,   among   other   things,   have   a    handle   on   the\n\nprisoner's medical condition, the treatment sought, the treatment\n\nprovided (if any), what treatment medical providers recommended,\n\nwhat the defendant knew and when, and what motivated its decisions.\n\nThis court cannot hope to match the district judge's expertise in\n\nthese areas, nor can I fathom why we would want to try.                     The\n\n\"extremely fact-bound nature\" of these cases means that \"de novo\n\nreview [will] have relatively little benefit,\" id. at 700 (Scalia,\n\nJ., dissenting), leaving us unmoved by the uniformity-of-the-law\n\nconsiderations raised by the majority.\n\n           So where does all this leave us with regard to the\n\nstandard that attaches to the determination of whether the Eighth\n\nAmendment has been violated? It is clear (and the majority agrees)\n\nthat with questions of varying exactitude, the \"standard of review\n\napplied depends, in the last analysis, on the extent to which a\n\nparticular question is fact-dominated or law-dominated.\" Turner v.\n\n\n                                      -80-\n\fUnited   States,   699   F.3d    578,   584   (1st   Cir.    2012)   (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted); see also In re IDC Clambakes, Inc., 727\n\nF.3d 58, 64 (1st Cir. 2013); Dugas v. Coplan, 506 F.3d 1, 8 (1st\n\nCir. 2007). Drawing the distinction between law-heavy versus fact-\n\nheavy questions is sometimes a tricky thing to do, and given that\n\nestablishing an Eighth Amendment claim involves a mixed question of\n\nlaw and fact, it is a thicket into which we must enter.               Luckily,\n\nI do not think it is a particularly thorny one in this case.\n\n           Here,   before       reaching    its   ultimate    constitutional\n\nconclusion, the trial court heard testimony from no fewer than\n\nnineteen witnesses (e.g., medical providers, medical experts,\n\nprison officials, and Kosilek) over the course of a trial that\n\nultimately extended two years.          The court scrutinized events that\n\nhad transpired over a twenty-year period, including those relating\n\nto what treatment Kosilek had requested, what treatment had been\n\nrecommended, and what care was ultimately provided.                  The court\n\nconsidered evidence about the DOC's security review, how it was\n\nconducted, and the concerns it raised. It assessed the credibility\n\nof Kosilek, DOC officials, and the medical experts.                  The court\n\nreviewed a copious amount of exhibits, such as Kosilek's medical\n\nrecords, Kosilek's prison records, DOC policies, DOC contracts, DOC\n\nmanuals, reports from Kosilek's medical providers, reports penned\n\nby each side's experts, DOC staff meeting notes, security reports,\n\nmedical literature, correspondence, and deposition testimony.              The\n\n\n                                     -81-\n\fend result was pages upon pages of factual findings made by the\n\ntrial judge.22\n\n          In other words, the district court \"engaged in a careful\n\nand close analysis of the trial evidence,\"          Turner, 699 F.3d at\n\n584, to make its ultimate determination that the DOC, without any\n\nvalid penological purpose, refused to provide medically necessary\n\ntreatment for Kosilek's life-threatening condition.               Given the\n\nclearly fact-intensive nature of the court's review, our own\n\nexamination into whether the court was correct that the DOC\n\nviolated the Eighth Amendment should be deferential, as opposed to\n\nthe fresh look the majority proposes.23        See id.; Fed. Refinance\n\nCo., 352 F.3d at 27 (explaining that the more fact-intensive the\n\nquestion, the more deferential our review).         As ably said by the\n\nSupreme Court, \"deferential review of mixed questions of law and\n\nfact is warranted when it appears that the district court is better\n\npositioned   than   the   appellate   court   to   decide   the   issue   in\n\n\n\n22\n   Indeed the majority dedicates over thirty pages of its opinion\nto the factual and procedural background in this case. This is not\nsurprising; those facts are integral to the resolution of the\nconstitutional question.    What is surprising is the majority's\nfailure to see the significance of the factually concentrated\nnature of this case.\n23\n   Plus, even assuming that the conclusion that the DOC's refusal\nto provide care constituted an Eighth Amendment violation lands\ncloser to the law side of the mixed-question spectrum, a measure of\ndeference is still appropriate. See Battista v. Clarke, 645 F.3d\n449, 454 (1st Cir. 2011) (\"The legal labels applied to facts are\nreviewed on appeal more closely than a district court fact-finding,\nbut often with some deference to the district judge.\").\n\n                                  -82-\n\fquestion, or that probing appellate scrutiny will not contribute to\n\nthe clarity of legal doctrine.\" Salve Regina Coll. v. Russell, 499\n\nU.S. 225, 233 (1991) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n             The majority's articulation of a standard of review that\n\nruns afoul of our case law is not the only problem.                 There is also\n\nits application.         While the majority's skewed standard allows\n\nminimal aspects of the lower court's decision to garner clear error\n\nreview, namely factual findings and credibility determinations, in\n\nactual application essentially no deference was paid.                   The only\n\nconclusion    of   the   district     court    that    the   majority   concedes\n\nwarranted deference was the judge's determination that Commissioner\n\nKathleen   Dennehy's      testimony    was    not     credible.24      Given   the\n\nvoluminous record in this case, and the breadth of the lower\n\ncourt's findings, it is simply unfathomable that the majority did\n\nnot consider a single other fact-drawn inference, credibility\n\nfinding, or motive determination, all of which warrant deference.\n\n             For instance, the district court drew inferences from the\n\nvarious medical providers' testimony to decide what constituted a\n\nprudent approach.        It also considered what Commissioner Harold\n\nClarke's motivations were for denying sex reassignment surgery. It\n\ndrew inferences from the DOC's conduct (e.g., the timing of\n\nsecurity   reviews   and    the   DOC's      communications     with    Kosilek's\n\n\n24\n   Of course the majority then goes on to explain why the court's\nadverse credibility determination does not matter, a point I will\nget into later.\n\n                                      -83-\n\fmedical providers) to determine that the DOC had engaged in\n\nprevarication and delay. The majority; however, does not appear to\n\nadjust its consideration of these issues to reflect any deference\n\nto the trial judge.        Rather it decides anew what inferences should\n\nbe drawn from the facts attested to at trial.                   Even under the\n\nmajority's standard, this is not proper.\n\n             Without doubt, the level of scrutiny applied by a court\n\npermeates its analysis and guides the outcome.               The impact here is\n\nclear. The Eighth Amendment is violated when prison officials fail\n\nto provide an inmate with adequate medical care, such that \"their\n\n'acts   or    omissions        [are]    sufficiently      harmful   to    evidence\n\ndeliberate indifference to serious medical needs.'\"                  Leavitt v.\n\nCorr. Med. Servs., Inc., 645 F.3d 484, 497 (1st Cir. 2011) (citing\n\nEstelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106 (1976)).                 The district court\n\nconcluded that the evidence established the DOC had committed such\n\na violation.        The majority says otherwise but its analysis is\n\nplagued with flaws, starting with its determination as to the\n\nobjective prong.\n\n                   III. Eighth Amendment: Objective Prong\n\n             Whether the so-called objective component of the Eighth\n\nAmendment    inquiry      is   satisfied    turns    on   whether   the    alleged\n\ndeprivation is \"objectively, sufficiently serious.\"                      Farmer v.\n\nBrennan,     511   U.S.   825,    834    (1994)   (internal    quotation     marks\n\nomitted); Leavitt, 645 F.3d at 497.               In this context, a prisoner\n\n\n                                        -84-\n\fwith   a \"serious medical need,\" Mahan v. Plymouth Cnty. House of\n\nCorr., 64 F.3d 14, 17-18 (1st Cir. 1995), is entitled to adequate\n\nmedical care, i.e, \"services at a level reasonably commensurate\n\nwith modern medical science and of a quality acceptable within\n\nprudent professional standards.\"   United States v. DeCologero, 821\n\nF.2d 39, 43 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n            That gender identity disorder is a serious medical need\n\nwhich warrants treatment, is not, as the majority notes, disputed.\n\nThe disagreement -- both between the parties and amongst this en\n\nbanc court -- centers around whether the district court correctly\n\nfound that the DOC's proffered regimen of care was inadequate, and\n\nthat sex reassignment surgery is the only appropriate treatment for\n\nKosilek.    Based on the record, and when one employs the proper\n\nstandard of review, that conclusion was generously supported by the\n\nevidence.\n\n                      A. Dr. Schmidt's Prudence\n\n            To start, despite the majority's qualms, the district\n\ncourt's conclusion that the DOC's expert, Dr. Chester Schmidt, was\n\nnot a prudent professional was not clearly erroneous.       In his\n\ntestimony, Dr. Schmidt expressed a good deal of disagreement with\n\nthe Harry Benjamin Standards of Care, which were widely relied upon\n\nby the other medical providers who testified below and which have\n\nbeen generally accepted by courts. See, e.g., De'Lonta v. Johnson,\n\n708 F.3d 520, 522-23 (4th Cir. 2013) (describing the Standards of\n\n\n                                -85-\n\fCare as \"the generally accepted protocols for the treatment of\n\nGID\"); Soneeya v. Spencer, 851 F. Supp. 2d 228, 231 (D. Mass. 2012)\n\n(noting that the \"course of treatment for Gender Identity Disorder\n\ngenerally followed in the community is governed by the 'Standards\n\nof Care'\"); O'Donnabhain v. Comm'r of Internal Revenue, 134 T.C.\n\n34, 65 (U.S. Tax Ct. 2010) (indicating that the Standards are\n\n\"widely accepted in the psychiatric profession, as evidenced by the\n\nrecognition of the standards' triadic therapy sequence as the\n\nappropriate    treatment    for       GID   and   transsexualism    in   numerous\n\npsychiatric and medical reference texts\").\n\n            While, as the majority notes, the Standards of Care have\n\na built-in flexibility, that pliancy appears to stem from the\n\nuniqueness of patient needs and the evolution of the gender\n\nidentity    disorder   field.25        Dr.     Schmidt's   departure     from   the\n\nStandards appeared more fundamental.              For instance, the Standards\n\nof   Care    explained     that       sex    reassignment    surgery      is    not\n\n\"experimental, investigational, elective, cosmetic, or optional in\n\nany meaningful sense.\"      Standards of Care, Version 6, at 18.                Dr.\n\nSchmidt disagreed.         In his expert report, he wrote that sex\n\nreassignment   surgery     was    a    \"voluntary,    elective     choice[]     and\n\nprocedure[],\" calling the steps towards reassignment \"equivalent to\n\n\n25\n   The Standards state: \"Clinical departures from these guidelines\nmay come about because of a patient's unique anatomic, social, or\npsychological situation, an experienced professional's evolving\nmethod of handling a common situation, or a research protocol.\"\nStandards of Care, Version 6, at 2.\n\n                                        -86-\n\fa variety of elective cosmetic non-surgical procedures and elective\n\ncosmetic surgical procedures.\"        Another example: the Standards of\n\nCare   provide   that,   for   persons      with   severe    gender   identity\n\ndisorder, sex reassignment surgery is effective, and when paired\n\nwith   hormone   therapy   and   a   real-life      experience,    \"medically\n\nindicated and medically necessary.\"          Standards of Care, Version 6,\n\nat 18.   Dr. Schmidt again was not on board.                He testified that\n\ngenerally he does not believe that sex reassignment surgery is\n\nmedically necessary and his practice manifests this philosophy. In\n\nthe approximately 300 patients he had evaluated, Dr. Schmidt never\n\nrecalled seeing even one case of gender identity disorder serious\n\nenough to warrant surgery.26\n\n           For Dr. Schmidt, there was an additional wrinkle. In Dr.\n\nSchmidt's opinion, a real-life experience living as the opposite\n\ngender could not be effectively replicated in prison, and this\n\ncounseled against surgery for Kosilek.             The district court found\n\nthat this viewpoint was not prudent.          The majority claims that in\n\ndoing so the court \"relied on its own -- non-medical -- judgment\n\n\n\n26\n    The majority makes much of the district judge faulting Dr.\nSchmidt for not writing letters of recommendation for patients\nseeking sex reassignment surgery, suggesting that the judge did not\nappreciate the nuance between opening the door for surgery and\nadvocating for it. I suspect the judge was more broadly concerned\nwith the fact that Dr. Schmidt did not think sex reassignment was\never medically necessary, nor had he ever seen a case where it was\nwarranted.   And despite having this strident perspective, Dr.\nSchmidt nonetheless opened the door for patients to undergo this\nmajor medical procedure.\n\n                                     -87-\n\fabout what constitutes a real-life experience.\"        This is not\n\naccurate.\n\n            The court based its determination, back in Kosilek I, on\n\nthe testimony of Dr. Marshall Forstein and Dr. George Brown, who\n\n\"convincingly testified [that] Kosilek's 'real life' is prison.\"\n\nKosilek v. Maloney, 221 F. Supp. 2d 156, 167 (D. Mass. 2002).   Then\n\nin Kosilek II, the court found the \"credible evidence in the\n\ninstant case confirmed the conclusion in Kosilek I that a person\n\ncan have a 'real life experience' in prison.\"   Kosilek v. Spencer,\n\n889 F. Supp. 2d 190, 232 (D. Mass. 2012).       Evidence before the\n\ncourt in Kosilek II included an expert report from Dr. Forstein,\n\nand testimony from Dr. Randi Kaufman, both of whom indicated that\n\nKosilek had undergone a real-life experience in prison.   There was\n\nalso the February 24, 2005 report from the Fenway doctors, Dr.\n\nKevin Kapila and Dr. Kaufman, which explained that Kosilek had\n\nmoved successfully through the steps outlined by the Standards of\n\nCare.    Then, in their October 7, 2005 report, the Fenway doctors\n\nexplained at length why Cynthia Osborne's review subtly distorted\n\nthe concept of the real-life experience, and why Kosilek had\n\ncompleted the real-life test -- a test made even more stringent by\n\nthe fact that she was living as a female in an all-male prison.\n\nDr. Brown echoed a similar sentiment.     He testified that Kosilek\n\nhad not only met the minimum real-life experience but had exceeded\n\nit.     Dr. Brown focused on the significant amount of information\n\n\n                                -88-\n\fthat existed regarding Kosilek's time in prison, a record that his\n\npatients in the outside world would never have.27\n\n          The record is clear.      The district court's determination\n\nthat Dr. Schmidt's viewpoint about the feasibility of a real-life\n\nexperience in prison was not based on the judge's own lay opinion.\n\nIt was, as the district court alluded to, grounded in a significant\n\namount of evidence offered by competent medical professionals, all\n\nof whom disagreed with Dr. Schmidt.28\n\n          The same can be said about what course of treatment was\n\nappropriate for Kosilek.        Dr. Schmidt testified that Kosilek had\n\n\"made an excellent adaptation\" on her current treatment regimen and\n\nthat   surgery    would   not    \"confer   any   additional   functional\n\ncapability.\"     Surgery was not, according to Dr. Schmidt, medically\n\nnecessary for Kosilek.      To minimize the risk of future harm to\n\n\n27\n   The majority mentions that none of the experts who opined that\nKosilek completed a real-life experience considered that she might\nbe housed in a female facility post-surgery.       This is hardly\nsurprising as this is a theory of my colleagues' own making. The\nDOC never made any argument that a potential post-surgery housing\nchange rendered Kosilek unable to complete the real-life\nexperience, nor did any provider opine that it was even a\nconsideration.\n28\n   The Seventh Version of the Standards of Care came out in 2011.\nNotably it contains a new section devoted to scenarios where\npersons with gender identity disorder are living in institutional\nenvironments such as prisons or long-term care facilities.\nStandards of Care, Version 7, at 67.      It provides that those\nindividuals' health care \"should mirror that which would be\navailable to them if they were living in a non-institutional\nsetting\" and that \"[a]ll elements of assessment and treatment as\ndescribed in the [Standards of Care] can be provided to people\nliving in institutions.\" Id.\n\n                                    -89-\n\fKosilek, Dr. Schmidt thought employing psychotherapy and medication\n\nto reduce her dysphoria and, if needed, placing Kosilek in a\n\nmedical facility would be effective.       A majority of the testifying\n\nmedical providers said otherwise though.         When asked what they\n\nthought   about   Dr.   Schmidt's   suggested   regimen,   Drs.    Kapila,\n\nKaufman, Appelbaum, and Forstein all thought it unreasonable.29 The\n\ncommon thinking was that Dr. Schmidt's approach was not likely to\n\neffectively reduce Kosilek's risk of self harm, given that the\n\nsource of her dysphoria was her male genitalia.\n\n           In the Eighth Amendment context, the adequacy of medical\n\ncare is \"measured against 'prudent professional standards.'\" Nunes\n\nv. Mass. Dept. of Corr., 766 F.3d 136, 142 (1st Cir. 2014) (quoting\n\nDeCologero, 821 F.2d at 43).        The district court here concluded\n\nthat Dr. Schmidt was not a prudent professional.       Given the above,\n\nI am not convinced that this determination was clearly erroneous.\n\nDr.   Schmidt's    significant   disagreement   with   widely     accepted\n\nguidelines and the sharp contrast between his and the other well-\n\ncredentialed providers' opinions, offer strong support for the\n\ncourt's finding.\n\n\n29\n   Court-appointed expert, Dr. Stephen Levine, ultimately testified\nthat from a purely medical perspective (absent considerations\nrelative to the prison environment), a prudent professional would\nnot deny Kosilek sex reassignment surgery. However, Dr. Levine\ninitially opined that Dr. Schmidt's view was reasonable (if not\npopular), a discrepancy that apparently arose from Dr. Levine\ndisregarding the district court's order to treat Kosilek as a\npatient in free society. Considering this incongruity, I do not\nlist Dr. Levine as one of Dr. Schmidt's critics.\n\n                                    -90-\n\f                    B. Adequacy of the DOC's Treatment\n\n             In light of the court's determination as to Dr. Schmidt's\n\nprudence, the question remains whether the evidence supported its\n\nconclusion that the DOC's treatment was not medically adequate.\n\nThe majority's consideration of this issue begins with a faulty\n\npremise.       It    states   that     the    \"district    court       held   that\n\npsychotherapy and antidepressants alone would not adequately treat\n\nKoslilek's    GID,\"    a   finding    the    majority   calls     an    incorrect\n\ncharacterization of the issues, and a minimization of the DOC's\n\nproffered treatment plan.          It is the majority who is wrong.\n\n             The district court was of course well aware that the DOC\n\nwas suggesting a more comprehensive treatment plan beyond therapy\n\nand medication.      Nonetheless, as it repeatedly explained, it found\n\nthat   all   treatment     other    than     sex   reassignment    surgery     was\n\ninadequate for Kosilek.        See, e.g., Kosilek, 889 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n202, 233, 236, 238, 240.       This included the DOC's past treatment,\n\nas well as its intended treatment going forward.             In other words,\n\nthe court did not minimize the DOC's regimen.                     Based on the\n\ntestimony and evidence presented, it simply found the regimen did\n\nnot, and would not going forward, adequately treat Kosilek's gender\n\nidentity disorder.         This finding was well within the court's\n\npurview to make.      The fact that the DOC fashioned some treatment,\n\nin the form of hormone therapy, electrolysis, and access to\n\nfeminine items does not insulate it from liability. In De'Lonta v.\n\n\n                                      -91-\n\fJohnson, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals found that an inmate,\n\nwho sought sex reassignment surgery after her gender identity\n\ndisorder failed to resolve despite receiving hormones, stated a\n\nplausible deliberate indifference claim.           708 F.3d at 522, 525.\n\nThe   court    concluded   that,   though   the   Virginia   Department   of\n\nCorrections had provided the inmate with hormone therapy and\n\npsychological counseling consistent with the Standards of Care, \"it\n\ndoes not follow that they have necessarily provided her with\n\nconstitutionally adequate treatment.\" Id. at 522, 526 (emphasis in\n\noriginal).\n\n              The majority nonetheless would have us believe the care\n\nprovided by the DOC can withstand constitutional scrutiny.                It\n\nendeavors to convince by giving little weight to the attested to\n\nshortcomings in Kosilek's treatment plan, and instead focusing\n\nheavily on the improvement Kosilek has made since being provided\n\nhormones, electrolysis, feminine garb and gear, and mental health\n\ntreatment.     This is not in dispute; Kosilek has indeed progressed.\n\nHowever, despite the short shrift the majority pays it, there was\n\nample evidence supporting the district court's conclusion that this\n\nimprovement was not sufficient to ease Kosilek's suffering to a\n\npoint where she was no longer facing a life-threatening risk of\n\nharm.\n\n              Though the DOC has been treating Kosilek for many years,\n\nthe district court found that she \"continues to suffer intense\n\n\n                                    -92-\n\fmental anguish.\"       Kosilek, 889 F. Supp. 2d at 202.                The court\n\nchronicled     the    evidence:    Kosilek's      own   testimony      about   her\n\ncontinued distress,30 the Fenway Center report indicating Kosilek's\n\nongoing angst over her male genitalia and the high likelihood of\n\nanother suicide attempt, and the along-the-same-lines testimony of\n\nKosilek's treating psychologist, Mark Burrowes.                 See id. at 226.\n\nThere   was    also   Dr.    Kaufman's      testimony   that,   even    with   the\n\ntreatment the DOC provided, Kosilek still suffered from clinically\n\nsignificant distress and severe dysphoria, a fact she found \"quite\n\nnotable.\" Dr. Brown testified similarly, explaining that Kosilek's\n\ntreatment to date, including the hormones, had not obviated her\n\nneed for surgery.           Further, there was evidence that Kosilek's\n\nimprovement     was   tangled     up   in   her   continuing    hope    that   sex\n\nreassignment surgery would be provided.            Dr. Brown testified: \"And\n\nwithout that hope, the [DOC's] treatments are -- I wouldn't say for\n\nnaught, but they are not going to continue her level of improvement\n\nwhere she is now.\"\n\n              Thus, even with Kosilek's documented improvement, Drs.\n\nBrown, Kaufman, Forstein, Kapila, and Appelbaum all testified\n\nunequivocally that sex reassignment surgery was medically necessary\n\nand the only appropriate treatment for Kosilek.                   They further\n\n\n30\n   The court found Kosilek testified credibly that although hormone\ntreatments had helped, she was distressed by her male genitalia and\nbelieved   that   she   needed  surgery.      Antidepressants   and\npsychotherapy, according to Kosilek, would not alter the fact that\nshe did not want to continue living with her male genitalia.\n\n                                       -93-\n\fagreed that there was a serious risk of harm, most likely suicide,\n\nshould Kosilek not receive the surgery, which was a concern the\n\nFenway doctors voiced as early as 2005. As the majority says, this\n\npotentiality matters because the Eighth Amendment's protections\n\nextend beyond present suffering to future harm.     See Helling v.\n\nMcKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33-34 (1993); Leavitt, 645 F.3d at 501.\n\n          The DOC's assertion that this future risk could be curbed\n\nwith medication and psychotherapy cannot carry the day.     As the\n\ndistrict court found, treating the underlying disorder and its\n\nsymptoms are two very different things, a distinction also drawn by\n\nthe Seventh Circuit.   See Fields v. Smith, 653 F.3d 550 (7th Cir.\n\n2011).   In Fields, the court found a Wisconsin statute that\n\nprohibited the state's correctional department from providing\n\ntransgender inmates with hormones and sex reassignment surgery\n\nunconstitutional.   Id. at 552-53, 559.   The court, discussing how\n\nsome patients require hormone therapy, found the department of\n\ncorrections had not effectively rebutted the evidence that an\n\noffering of medication and psychotherapy would \"do nothing to treat\n\nthe underlying disorder.\" Id. at 556. In the instant matter, Drs.\n\nAppelbaum and Kapila testified that the preferred approach is to\n\ntreat the underlying problem -- Kosilek's gender identity disorder\n\n-- as opposed to the symptoms it might produce.      As chronicled\n\nabove, the consensus was that the only way to adequately treat that\n\nproblem was with sex reassignment surgery.\n\n\n                               -94-\n\f           Lest we forget, the procedural posture of this case bears\n\nanother mention. The DOC is challenging the district court's grant\n\nof injunctive relief following a bench trial, meaning that due\n\nregard is paid to the judge's factual findings and credibility\n\ndeterminations.   See Monahan, 625 F.3d at 46.    When the evidence\n\nyields competing inferences or two permissible views, we cannot\n\nsecond guess, \"even if, had we been sitting as triers of the facts,\n\nwe might have arrived at a different set of judgments.\"     N. Ins.\n\nCo. of N.Y. v. Point Judith Marina, LLC, 579 F.3d 61, 67 (1st Cir.\n\n2009).   Here the judge concluded that the DOC's present treatment\n\nregimen, with the added medication and therapy to cushion the post-\n\nsurgery-denial fallout, would not reduce Kosilek's suffering to the\n\npoint where she did not have a major medical need.      Rather, sex\n\nreassignment surgery was the only adequate treatment for Kosilek's\n\nlife-threatening disorder.   As detailed above, these findings were\n\nsupported by the un-objected to testimony of multiple eminently\n\nqualified doctors, by widely accepted, published standards, and by\n\nthe testimony of Kosilek herself.       The factfinder found this\n\nevidence convincing; he found the DOC's evidentiary offering less\n\nso.   It is not for us to re-weigh the evidence and second-guess\n\nthis determination, but that is exactly what the majority does.\n\n           What's more, by upholding the adequacy of the DOC's\n\ncourse of treatment, the majority in essence creates a de facto ban\n\non sex reassignment surgery for inmates in this circuit.        Its\n\n\n                                -95-\n\fattempt to repudiate this notion is not compelling.                    For instance,\n\nthe fact that the DOC has \"disclaimed any attempt to create a\n\nblanket policy regarding SRS\" is a non-starter.                   The issue is not\n\nwhether correctional departments will voluntarily provide the\n\nsurgery, it is whether the precedent set by this court today will\n\npreclude inmates from ever being able to mount a successful Eighth\n\nAmendment    claim    for   sex    reassignment         surgery   in    the   courts.\n\nEqually unconvincing is the majority's assertion that the \"unique\n\ncircumstances\" presented by Kosilek's case will prevent any de\n\nfacto ban.       The first so-called anomaly cited by the majority --\n\nthe divergence of opinion as to Kosilek's need for surgery -- only\n\nresulted from the DOC disregarding the advice of Kosilek's treating\n\ndoctors and bringing in a predictable opponent to sex reassignment\n\nsurgery.     It is no stretch to imagine another department of\n\ncorrections stealing a page from this play book, i.e., just bring\n\nin someone akin to Osborne.             It is hardly a matchless scenario.\n\nThe same goes for Kosilek's criminal history and post-surgical\n\nhousing options, which the majority also points to.                    Rare will be\n\nthe prisoner who does not pose some type of security concern, or\n\nharbor some potential for causing climate unrest.                  So the question\n\nremains,    if    Kosilek   --    who     was    time   and   again    diagnosed     as\n\nsuffering    from    severe      gender    identity     disorder,      and    who   was\n\nuniformly thought by qualified medical professionals to require\n\n\n\n\n                                          -96-\n\fsurgery -- is not an appropriate candidate for surgery, what inmate\n\nis?\n\n             In sum, the majority's conclusion that the district court\n\nwrongly found that Kosilek satisfied the objective component of the\n\nEighth Amendment inquiry is, in my opinion, flatly incorrect. I am\n\nno more convinced by the majority's examination of the subjective\n\ncomponent.\n\n                IV. Eighth Amendment: Subjective Prong\n\n             A satisfied subjective prong means that prison officials\n\nhad \"a sufficiently culpable state of mind\" in that they showed\n\ndeliberate indifference to an inmate's health and safety.     Farmer,\n\n511 U.S. at 834; Leavitt, 645 F.3d at 497.    The officials were both\n\n\"aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a\n\nsubstantial risk of serious harm exists\" and they drew that\n\ninference. Ruiz-Rosa v. Rullán, 485 F.3d 150, 156 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\nThe majority posits that the DOC, because it was faced with\n\nconflicting medical opinions about what treatment was appropriate\n\nfor Kosilek, and because it proffered reasonable security concerns,\n\nwas not deliberately indifferent to Kosilek's risk for serious\n\nharm.   Both theories fail to convince.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -97-\n\f                 A. Conflicting Medical Opinions\n\n          The idea that incompatible medical opinions serve to\n\ninsulate the DOC from a deliberate indifference finding is a\n\nconcept not advanced by the DOC, which rests on several faulty\n\npropositions and has very problematic implications.\n\n          The majority concedes that the DOC never made this\n\nparticular argument, but charitably claims it is not waived because\n\n\"[t]he DOC's contention that the district court erred in deeming\n\nSRS medically necessary and in rejecting Dr. Schmidt's approach as\n\nimprudent necessarily entails the DOC's subjective belief that SRS\n\nwas unnecessary.\"31    This is a stretch.     An argument advanced on\n\nappeal years after surgery was denied is not the equivalent of the\n\nDOC's   subjective    belief   that   sex   reassignment   surgery   was\n\nunnecessary when it denied it.        Moreover, the mere existence of\n\ncontradictory medical opinions does not necessarily mean that the\n\nDOC did not deny Kosilek surgery for purely pretextual reasons. It\n\nis certainly conceivable that a correctional department could seize\n\non an opinion from a medical provider, whether or not it found it\n\ncompelling, as a means to justify denying treatment.\n\n\n\n\n31\n   When the DOC first informed the district court that it would not\nbe providing Kosilek with surgery (back in June 2005 under\nDennehy's watch), Dr. Schmidt had not even evaluated Kosilek let\nalone communicated his findings. At the time, the DOC was only\narmed with the report of Cynthia Osborne who had not met with\nKosilek but rather had simply peer reviewed the Fenway Report.\n\n                                  -98-\n\f             Another even more serious flaw in the majority's theory\n\nis that it is contradicted by the evidence.          Commissioner Dennehy\n\ntestified multiple times, and submitted a report to the same\n\neffect, that it was security concerns that motivated her decision\n\nto   deny    Kosilek   surgery.     During    Dennehy's   first    round   of\n\ntestimony, when she was still claiming ignorance about whether\n\nUMass     (the   DOC's   contracted     health-services     provider)      was\n\nrecommending surgery, she testified that based \"strictly [on]\n\nsafety and security concerns\" she would still veto the surgery even\n\nif UMass told her that it was medically necessary.                Then, once\n\nUMass's     position   that   surgery   was   medically   necessary   became\n\npellucid to Dennehy, she submitted a report to the court indicating\n\nthat she was standing firm in her decision to deny surgery based on\n\n\"alarming and substantial\" safety and security concerns. Her final\n\ntime on the stand, Dennehy testified that the only thing, in her\n\nview, preventing surgery for Kosilek was safety and security\n\nconcerns; absent such concerns, Dennehy would have no reason to\n\ninterfere with any medical order for treatment.\n\n             The evidence with regard to Commissioner Clarke's stance\n\non the issue was similar.         In his report to the court, Clarke\n\ndisclaimed any ability to render an opinion on the validity of the\n\nmedical opinions expressed at trial, and went on to explain his\n\nview that \"the safety and security concerns presented by the\n\nprospect of undertaking sex reassignment surgery for Michelle\n\n\n                                    -99-\n\fKosilek    are    insurmountable.\"          Clarke       then    hammered       home   his\n\nsecurity concerns on the stand.             Therefore, even though there was\n\ncontradictory opinions on whether surgery was medically necessary\n\nfor Kosilek, both Dennehy's and Clarke's decision to deny the\n\nprocedure was, as they put it, based solely on security concerns.\n\n               The majority's presumption that the existence of varying\n\nmedical       opinions    should    insulate       the     DOC      is    not   only   an\n\nunpreserved,      unsupported       argument      but    it     has      very   troubling\n\nimplications.          It gives correctional departments serious leeway\n\nwith the Eighth Amendment.                If they do not want to provide a\n\nprisoner with care recommended by one or more than one medical\n\nprovider, they need only find a doctor with a differing mind set\n\n(typically not a difficult task).               It is no stretch to think that\n\nmight    be     what    happened    here.         The    DOC     had     the    treatment\n\nrecommendation of Drs. Kaufman and Kapila, a local psychiatrist and\n\npsychologist who had evaluated Kosilek.                    The doctors themselves\n\nwere recommended by the DOC's own medical provider, UMass. Yet the\n\nDOC     took    the    unusual     step    of     having      the     Fenway     doctors'\n\nrecommendation peer reviewed by Cynthia Osborne, an out-of-state\n\nsocial worker with a known opinion about sex reassignment surgery.\n\nIt seems highly unlikely that the DOC was simply looking for a more\n\ncomplete picture of Kosilek's treatment options, and that Osborne's\n\npredictable opposition to Kosilek being provided with surgery was\n\na non-factor.          The DOC knew that Osborne was working with the\n\n\n                                          -100-\n\fVirginia and Wisconsin departments of corrections to help defend\n\nlawsuits filed by transgender prisoners, and internal DOC meeting\n\nminutes noted that Osborne \"may do more objective evaluations\" and\n\nwas \"[m]ore sympathetic to DOC position.\" Predictably, Osborne was\n\none-hundred percent sympathetic.\n\n                          B. Security Concerns\n\n             There is no dispute that \"security considerations . . .\n\nmatter at prisons,\" leaving \"ample room for professional judgment.\"\n\nBattista v. Clarke, 645 F.3d 449, 453, 454 (1st Cir. 2011).              \"Any\n\nprofessional judgment that decides an issue involving conditions of\n\nconfinement must embrace security and administration and not merely\n\nmedical judgments.\" Id. at 455 (quoting Cameron v. Tomes, 900 F.2d\n\n14, 20 (1st Cir. 1993) (emphasis in original)).           But it is also\n\ntrue that at some point a defendant forfeits the advantage of\n\ndeference,    for   instance   following   a   \"pattern   of   delays,   new\n\nobjections substituted for old ones, misinformation and other\n\nnegatives.\"32    Id.   The district court determined that the DOC had\n\ndone just this, causing undue delay in Kosilek's treatment regimen,\n\n\n32\n   The pattern in Battista -- a case in which a transgender inmate\nsued the Massachusetts DOC for failing to provide doctor-\nrecommended hormones -- included an initial failure to take the\ninmate's diagnosis and hormone request seriously, the years it took\nfor a solid security justification to be made, and the DOC's claim\nthat withholding hormones or placing the inmate in severely\nconstraining protective custody were the only two options.       In\nother words, there are some marked similarities between that case\nand this one. That is, apart from their outcomes. In Battista,\nthis court affirmed the district court's deliberate indifference\ndetermination.\n\n                                  -101-\n\fmanufacturing security concerns, and orchestrating a half-hearted\n\nsecurity review. The record amply supported these conclusions, yet\n\nthe majority too easily discounts them, especially given the\n\ndeferential look this issue warrants. See, e.g., Torraco, 923 F.2d\n\nat 234 (explaining that deliberate indifference is usually a jury\n\nquestion); Monahan, 625 F.3d at 46 (providing that due regard is\n\ngiven to credibility calls); Fed. Refinance Co., 352 F.3d at 27-28\n\n(noting    that   a    clear      error   look    makes   sense    when   there    are\n\nquestions of motive and intent).\n\n             Of course, it has been many years since medical providers\n\nbegan considering the propriety of surgery for Kosilek.                           Back\n\nduring Kosilek I, Dr. Forstein recommended that Kosilek be allowed\n\nto consult with a surgeon who specialized in sex reassignment\n\nsurgery.    Then in 2003, Dr. Seil said Kosilek should be allowed to\n\nmeet with a specialist after a year on hormones.                    But right when\n\nshe started as commissioner, Dennehy made a curious move.                          She\n\nreassessed the care being provided to all inmates suffering from\n\ngender identity disorder, despite the DOC's contract with UMass\n\nplacing that medical care squarely in UMass's purview.                    Then once\n\nthe Fenway doctors opined in 2005 that Kosilek should be allowed to\n\nhave   surgery,       the   DOC    frittered      away    time    claiming   not    to\n\nunderstand    that     UMass      recommended     surgery    for    Kosilek.       The\n\nmajority does not quibble with the court's finding that the DOC\n\nprevaricated in this respect because it \"does not undercut the\n\n\n                                          -102-\n\fconsistency    with   which    they    identified    safety    and   security\n\nconcerns.\"     This misses the point.          To establish a subjective\n\nintent, \"it is enough for the prisoner to show a wanton disregard\n\nsufficiently evidenced 'by denial, delay, or interference with\n\nprescribed health care.'\"        Battista, 645 F.3d at 453 (quoting\n\nDesRosiers, 949 F.2d at 19); see also Johnson v. Wright, 412 F.3d\n\n398, 404 (2d Cir. 2005) (A \"deliberate indifference claim can lie\n\nwhere   prison     officials     deliberately       ignore     the    medical\n\nrecommendations of a prisoner's treating physicians.\").              That is\n\nprecisely what the district court found happened here, and the\n\nevidentiary support for this determination is in the record.\n\n             The same goes for the court's conclusion that the DOC's\n\nsecurity reviews were rushed and results-driven.              Dennehy told a\n\nnews outlet that the DOC would deny Kosilek's request for surgery\n\ndespite only having \"generalized discussions\" and phone calls with\n\nthe relevant players; she had not yet received written reports or\n\nconvened a formal security meeting.           When the DOC did meet, there\n\nwas just a week left before its court-ordered security report was\n\ndue -- a report that was then penned predominantly by trial counsel\n\nand reviewed by Dennehy only a day or two before its filing.            Once\n\ntrial was underway, the hurriedness continued.           A mere nine days\n\nbefore expert disclosures were due, Dennehy contacted the director\n\nof the Federal Bureau of Prisons looking for a security expert.\n\nAnd the experts the DOC ultimately did present at trial seemed ill\n\n\n                                      -103-\n\fprepared, failing to take into account important details about\n\nKosilek's medical and disciplinary history.\n\n          For the district court, another reason not to esteem the\n\nDOC's proffered security concerns was the fact that they were\n\n\"largely false\" and \"greatly exaggerated.\"             This finding is not\n\nclearly erroneous.    Yet the majority easily dismisses it, in part\n\nby limiting its focus to what it presumably perceives as the DOC's\n\nmore valid security concerns -- where to house Kosilek post-\n\noperatively and the deterrence of false suicide threats by inmates.\n\nThe majority is conveniently forgetting the throw-it-up-and-see-\n\nwhat-sticks approach taken by the DOC below. It was this approach,\n\nin part, that led the court to question whether the DOC could be\n\ntrusted to give an accurate picture of security concerns consequent\n\nto surgery.\n\n          For    instance,     the   DOC        repeatedly      claimed   that\n\ntransporting    Kosilek   to   surgery    out    of   state    would   pose   an\n\ninsurmountable security risk. It is hardly surprising the district\n\ncourt thought this was an embellished concern.                Kosilek had been\n\ntransported to multiple doctor's appointments without issue, and it\n\nis illogical to think Kosilek would attempt to flee en route to the\n\nsurgery she has dedicated decades of her life to obtaining.               Also\n\neminently unlikely is that during the transport home from highly\n\ninvasive surgery, a sixty-five-year-old, recovering Kosilek would\n\nbe able to escape the grasp of DOC personnel.           Even Clarke thought\n\n\n                                  -104-\n\fit near certain that Kosilek could safely be transported to and\n\nfrom surgery.\n\n          With regard to housing Kosilek in a female prison, the\n\nDOC painted Kosilek as a highly-polarizing escape risk who could\n\nnot possibly safely reside in MCI-Framingham's general population.\n\nIt pointed to the comparatively weaker perimeter of MCI-Framingham,\n\nalleging that Kosilek's superior male strength and life sentence\n\nmade her a flight risk.   One can easily see why the district court\n\nwas not buying this.      Kosilek was advanced in age, physically\n\nslight, had taken female hormones for years, and had an excellent\n\ndisciplinary    record.   And   MCI-Framingham   successfully    housed\n\napproximately forty life offenders.     The court also had reason to\n\nbe skeptical of the DOC's adamant contention that Kosilek would\n\ncause inmate climate issues at MCI-Framingham due to the fact that\n\nshe murdered her wife.     Undoubtedly inmates find other inmates\n\noffensive for a plethora of reasons, such as, race, religion, gang\n\naffiliation, sexual orientation, or the crime committed.        Prisons\n\ndeal with these situations on a routine basis and the evidence\n\nestablished that MCI-Framingham had procedures in place to do just\n\nthat.\n\n          The DOC even admitted at oral argument that had a post-\n\noperative, transgender person out in free society committed murder,\n\nthe DOC would have to figure out where to house that person.       The\n\nDOC; however, did not think this a particularly important point,\n\n\n                                -105-\n\fprotesting that Kosilek presents unique concerns that separate her\n\nfrom this hypothetical inmate.         I am unmoved.       The fact that\n\nKosilek's crime was one of violence against a woman could equally\n\napply to another potential inmate.           And the fact that Kosilek\n\ngained notoriety by litigating against the DOC all these years          --\n\nin other words, successfully pursuing her constitutional right to\n\nadequate medical care -- hardly seems a compelling consideration.\n\n           For the district court, also blunting the DOC's fervent\n\ncries of overwhelming security concerns were the alternatives to\n\nplacing Kosilek in the general population of a Massachusetts\n\nprison. There was the option of transferring Kosilek to an out-of-\n\nstate prison (though this scenario appears to have been left\n\nlargely unexplored by the DOC).     In fact, the evidence established\n\nthat   Clarke's   former   employer,   the    Washington   Department   of\n\nCorrections, housed a post-operative female transgender inmate,\n\nalso serving a life sentence for murdering a female relative,\n\nwithout security or climate issues.          The inmate's housing was so\n\nunremarkable that Clarke was not even aware of it during his tenure\n\nin Washington.    Further, there was evidence that Kosilek's safety\n\ncould be ensured by placing her in a segregated housing unit.\n\n           The DOC's past conduct was also relevant to the district\n\ncourt's credibility assessment. In connection with Kosilek I, then\n\nCommissioner Michael Maloney hammered the serious security concerns\n\nsurrounding   Kosilek   remaining   at   MCI-Norfolk    while   receiving\n\n\n                                 -106-\n\fhormones, theorizing that an inmate living as a female (with female\n\nattributes) among sex offenders would create a risk of violence.\n\nHowever, once the DOC actually stopped to conduct a security\n\nreview, it determined there were no current security concerns with\n\nKosilek being provided estrogen therapy. Indeed no security issues\n\never arose. Kosilek has been safely housed at MCI-Norfolk for many\n\nyears presenting herself as female.        The DOC's reversal on this\n\nissue calls into question its stance before this court about the\n\nnon-feasibility of housing a post-surgical Kosilek at MCI-Norfolk.\n\n          The DOC also expressed concern that providing Kosilek\n\nwith surgery would encourage inmates to utilize suicide threats to\n\nreceive a desired benefit, and the majority deems this concern\n\nreasonable.     I am not convinced, and neither was the district\n\ncourt.   Not only is there absolutely no evidence that Kosilek is\n\ntrying to game the system, but the DOC, as it emphasized at trial,\n\nemploys mental health professionals and has policies in place to\n\ndeal with suicidality.    Presumably, these tools can be used by the\n\nDOC to assess whether an inmate's particular suicide threat is\n\nmanufactured or real, and it can be dealt with accordingly.         That\n\nthe DOC does not want to be inundated with a hypothetical influx of\n\nfalse suicide threats hardly seems a valid reason to deny a\n\nprisoner care deemed medically necessary.\n\n          For    the   district   court,   the   public   and   political\n\ndisapproval of Kosilek's surgical pursuit was another factor.         It\n\n\n                                  -107-\n\fdid not believe Dennehy's and Clarke's claims that the avoidance of\n\ncontroversy played no role in the DOC's decision to deny surgery.\n\nThe majority concedes that it must give deference to the court's\n\nfinding that Dennehy's motivations were colored by public pressure\n\nand so, instead, the majority hypes up the role of Commissioner\n\nClarke by characterizing him as the ultimate decision maker. I see\n\na few flaws with the majority's reasoning.\n\n            For one, the majority says the district court improperly\n\nimputed    Dennehy's      motivations     to    Clarke,    thus   ignoring    the\n\ninjunctive-relief requirement that it take into account the DOC's\n\nthen present-day stance.33          See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 845 (quoting\n\nHelling,    509    U.S.    at     36)   (The    court    considers     deliberate\n\nindifference      \"'in    light    of   the     prison    authorities'    current\n\nattitudes and conduct,' . . . their attitudes and conduct at the\n\ntime suit is brought and persisting thereafter.\").                   The majority\n\nhas it wrong.     The court took testimony from Clarke, reviewed his\n\nwritten report, and spoke extensively in its decision about why it\n\nwas not convinced that Clarke denied Kosilek surgery based on\n\n\n33\n   While a defendant's attitudes and conduct at the time a decision\nis rendered are relevant, what motivates the DOC today is not.\nThis fact may be less than clear given the majority's reference to\nthe DOC's present stance (\"proof that the DOC remains motivated by\npretextual or improper concerns\") and the fact that Dennehy is now\nseven years removed from the decision-making process. To be clear,\nwe are reviewing the district court's decision that the DOC,\nthrough Dennehy and Clarke, denied Kosilek surgery based on\npretextual reasons.     Indeed it would be an amazing feat of\nprescience for the district court to anticipate what the DOC's\nviewpoint would be two years after penning its decision.\n\n                                        -108-\n\flegitimate penological concerns.                   Of note, it was Kosilek who\n\nsought to have Clarke inform the court of his position, and the\n\nDOC, which stipulated at trial that Dennehy was the operative\n\ndecision maker, actually objected to Clarke even testifying as he\n\nwas simply \"maintain[ing] the position set forth by the DOC through\n\nformer Commissioner Dennehy.\"\n\n              Furthermore, though the majority defers to the court's\n\ntake on Dennehy, it refuses to do so for Clarke, claiming that\n\n\"Clarke was never found by the court to be non-credible.\"                        This is\n\nnot   entirely       accurate.         Clearly     the    import    of    the   court's\n\nconclusion that Clarke's articulated security concerns were either\n\nfalse or exaggerated as a pretext to deny surgery means that the\n\ncourt did not think Clarke a completely credible witness.                            See\n\nKosilek,   889    F.    Supp.     2d    at   241    (\"[T]he   purported         security\n\nconsiderations       that   Dennehy      and     Clarke    claim    motivated      their\n\ndecisions to deny Kosilek sex reassignment surgery are largely\n\nfalse   and    any     possible       genuine      concerns   have       been    greatly\n\nexaggerated     to    provide     a    pretext     for    denying    the   prescribed\n\ntreatment.\")     In fact, the court specifically found certain claims\n\nmade by Clarke not to be credible.                 See id. at 244 (finding that\n\n\"neither Dennehy nor Clarke has provided a credible explanation for\n\ntheir purported belief that if Kosilek's genitalia are altered the\n\nrisk to him and others at MCI Norfolk will be materially magnified\"\n\nand \"[t]he claims of Dennehy and Clarke that they have denied sex\n\n\n                                         -109-\n\freassignment surgery for Kosilek in part because MCI Framingham is\n\nnot sufficiently secure to prevent an escape by Kosilek, who has\n\nnever attempted to flee, are not credible.\")          Therefore, as it did\n\nwith Dennehy, the majority should be giving due regard to the\n\ncourt's conclusion that Clarke was not believable.\n\n              The majority also misses the mark with its contention\n\nthat the \"only evidence\" tending to show Clarke may have considered\n\npublic and political criticism were the two letters from the\n\nunhappy Massachusetts legislators.           This is not the whole picture.\n\nIn addition to the letters, what convinced the court that Clarke\n\nwas   improperly    motivated    was   his    advancing   inflated     security\n\nconcerns following a hasty review, suggesting that he did not\n\noperate with an open mind.        Having already detailed the evidence\n\nsupporting the court's distrust of the DOC's proffered security\n\nconcerns, I will not rehash.\n\n              As for the thoroughness of Clarke's review, the court\n\ncriticized Clarke for not consulting with Luis Spencer, who was\n\nSuperintendent of MCI-Norfolk at the time, and for not reviewing\n\nthe   DOC's    security-expert   trial   testimony,       prior   to   deciding\n\nwhether to deny surgery. The DOC counters that Clarke, pursuant to\n\nthe court's order, was not required to do either of those things.\n\nIt is both conceivable that Clarke's review was too cursory, or\n\nthat he felt constrained by the court's order, though the fact that\n\nClarke did not know significant details such as Kosilek's age and\n\n\n                                   -110-\n\fexcellent   disciplinary   record   favors    the    former   possibility.\n\nEither way, both views are permissible, which means that the\n\ndistrict court's choice of one of them cannot be clearly erroneous.\n\nSee Monahan, 625 F.3d at 46.        Nor is it appropriate for us to\n\nsecond-guess    the   court's   tenable      perception       of   Clarke's\n\nmotivations, as deference extends to \"inferences drawn from the\n\nunderlying facts, and if the trial court's reading of the record\n\n[with respect to an actor's motivation] is plausible, appellate\n\nreview is at an end.\"       Janeiro, 457 F.3d at 138-39 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted) (alteration in original).\n\n            Ultimately, there was adequate evidentiary support for\n\nthe   court's   determination   that    the    DOC     was    deliberately\n\nindifferent. The court did not obviously err in concluding the DOC\n\ndelayed implementing medical treatment recommended by its own\n\nproviders, sought out a more favorable medical opinion, engaged in\n\na hasty, result-driven security review, offered a host of poorly\n\nthought out security concerns, and then denied surgery based not on\n\nany legitimate penological concerns but on a fear of controversy.\n\nWhether I, or any of my colleagues, would have drawn these same\n\nconclusions had we been presiding over this trial is irrelevant;\n\nour review is circumscribed.    It is enough that the district court\n\nhad a reasonable basis for its judgment.            The district court's\n\ndetermination that the Eighth Amendment's subjective prong was\n\nsatisfied should stand.\n\n\n                                -111-\n\f                                 V. Conclusion\n\n             I am confident that I would not need to pen this dissent,\n\nover   twenty    years   after   Kosilek's    quest   for   constitutionally\n\nadequate medical care began, were she not seeking a treatment that\n\nmany see as strange or immoral.               Prejudice and fear of the\n\nunfamiliar      have   undoubtedly   played   a   role   in   this   matter's\n\nprotraction. Whether today's decision brings this case to a close,\n\nI cannot say.     But I am confident that this decision will not stand\n\nthe test of time, ultimately being shelved with the likes of Plessy\n\nv. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896), deeming constitutional state laws\n\nrequiring racial segregation, and Korematsu v. United States, 323\n\nU.S. 214 (1944), finding constitutional the internment of Japanese-\n\nAmericans in camps during World War II.           I only hope that day is\n\nnot far in the future, for the precedent the majority creates is\n\ndamaging.     It paves the way for unprincipled grants of en banc\n\nrelief, decimates the deference paid to a trial judge following a\n\nbench trial, aggrieves an already marginalized community, and\n\nenables correctional systems to further postpone their adjustment\n\nto the crumbling gender binary.\n\n             I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -112-\n\f           KAYATTA,      Circuit         Judge,    dissenting.      Reading     the\n\nmajority's lengthy and oft-revisited discussion of the applicable\n\nstandard of review, one would think that this case posed issues of\n\nlaw or application of law to fact.                This is plainly not so.\n\n           There is not a comma, much less a word, of the applicable\n\nlaw that the district court did not expressly and correctly explain\n\nand apply.      All the parties and all the judges in this case,\n\nincluding the trial judge, agree on the controlling principles of\n\nlaw, long ago established by the Supreme Court.                   See Estelle v.\n\nGamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976); Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825,\n\n837 (1994); see also United States v. DeCologero, 821 F.2d 39, 43\n\n(1st Cir. 1987). Under that law, a prison must supply medical care\n\nto its prisoners \"at a level reasonably commensurate with modern\n\nmedical   science      and   of     a    quality    acceptable    within   prudent\n\nprofessional standards.\"          DeCologero, 821 F.2d at 43.        The failure\n\nto provide such care, moreover, does not constitute an Eighth\n\nAmendment violation unless it rises to the level of \"deliberate\n\nindifference\"     to     a    \"serious         medical   need.\"      \"Deliberate\n\nindifference\"    means       that       the   prison   official   \"knows   of   and\n\ndisregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety.\"                  Farmer,\n\n511 U.S. at 837.        A \"serious medical need\" is defined as, among\n\nother things, \"one that has been diagnosed by a physician as\n\nmandating treatment.\"        Gaudreault v. Municipality of Salem, Mass.,\n\n923 F.2d 203, 208 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n\n                                          -113-\n\f             Our decision in this case therefore necessarily turns on\n\nthe facts themselves. And we begin our review knowing that Kosilek\n\ndoes indeed have a serious medical need, and the prison's own\n\ndoctors, as well as the specialists retained by those doctors,\n\ninformed DOC that treatment of Kosilek's medical condition in\n\naccordance     with   prudent   professional    standards      requires   sex\n\nreassignment    surgery   (SRS).34      That   leaves   only    two   factual\n\nquestions:    (1) Are the DOC's doctors correct that SRS is the only\n\ntreatment for Kosilek's condition that is commensurate with modern\n\nmedical science as practiced by prudent professionals;35 and, if so,\n\n(2) Did prison officials nevertheless deny that treatment not\n\nbecause they disbelieved their own doctors, and not because of\n\nprison security considerations, but rather simply because they\n\nfeared public ridicule.         If the answer to each of these two\n\nquestions is \"yes,\" Kosilek should win.         Otherwise, she loses.\n\n             Were I the trial judge charged with answering these two\n\nfactual questions based solely on the written record, I would\n\nlikely find against Kosilek on the first question for the reasons\n\nstated by the trial court's appointed independent expert, Dr.\n\nLevine.   In a nutshell, Dr. Levine, who participated in drafting\n\n\n34\n   None of these witnesses face challenge on the grounds that their\nopinions are outside the bounds of accepted science. See Daubert\nv. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 589-90 (1993).\n35\n   In the majority's words, \"whether SRS is a medically necessary\ncomponent of Kosilek's care, such that any course of treatment not\nincluding surgery is constitutionally inadequate.\" Slip Op. at 46.\n\n                                     -114-\n\fthe Standards of Care, provided carefully nuanced and persuasive\n\ntestimony     that    medical    science     has   not   reached     a    wide,\n\nscientifically       driven   consensus     mandating    SRS   as   the   only\n\nacceptable treatment for an incarcerated individual with gender\n\ndysphoria.    But I am not the trial judge in this case.            Nor are my\n\ncolleagues.     And that is the rub.\n\n             The experienced jurist who was the trial judge in this\n\ncase, and who actually sat and listened to the live testimony,\n\nfound as a matter of fact that:\n\n             (1) Commensurate with modern medical science, no prudent\n\nprofessional would recommend any treatment for Kosilek other than\n\nSRS; and\n\n             (2) Prison officials nevertheless denied the treatment\n\nnot because they rejected the accuracy of the medical advice\n\ntendered by their own doctors, and not because of security issues,\n\nbut rather because they feared public ridicule.           Their reasons for\n\ndenying the necessary treatment were thus in bad faith.\n\n             The majority never explains why these two findings are\n\nnot pure findings of fact, and are not therefore subject solely to\n\nreview for clear error.         Nor can it.    After all, we are talking\n\nabout, first, what the medical--not legal--standard of care is for\n\na particular affliction, and second, whether Dennehy and Clarke\n\nwere truthful in describing their security objections, such as\n\ntheir claim that they feared that Kosilek, after trying to get this\n\n\n                                    -115-\n\fsurgery for twenty years, would escape on the way to the operating\n\nroom or, fresh from the surgeon's knife, overpower her guards and\n\nrun away.   Let me be plain on this point:            Until today, there was\n\nabsolutely no precedent (and the majority cites none) for reviewing\n\nsuch quintessentially factual findings under anything other than\n\nthe clear error test.\n\n            As    Judge   Thompson       carefully    explains,   there   is   a\n\nconsiderable amount of evidence that directly supports the trial\n\ncourt's findings on these two points, depending on which witnesses\n\none believes.     I write separately only to stress that even if one\n\nagrees with the majority that the district court got the fact-\n\nfinding wrong, we should defer unless the result is clearly\n\nerroneous. Of course, deferring to the trial judge's fact-finding\n\nhappens to produce a result in this case that some of us find\n\nsurprising,      and   much   of   the    public     likely   finds   shocking.\n\nScientific knowledge advances quickly and without regard to settled\n\nnorms and arrangements. It sometimes draws in its wake a reluctant\n\ncommunity, unnerved by notions that challenge our views of who we\n\nare and how we fit in the universe.             The notion that hard-wired\n\naspects of gender may not unerringly and inexorably correspond to\n\nphysical anatomy is especially unnerving for many.\n\n            The solution, I think, is to trust our trial judges to\n\nresolve these factual issues when the evidence supports a finding\n\neither way.      Some will get it wrong; most will get it right.           The\n\n\n                                     -116-\n\farc of decision-making, over time, will bend towards the latter.\n\nFor each instance of error in fact-finding, such as possibly this\n\ncase itself, $25,000 or so may be lost.        But doctors and lawyers\n\nwill refine their presentations and other trial judges will make\n\ntheir own findings, not bound in any way by the fact-finding in\n\nthis case.\n\n             Instead, by deciding the facts in this case as an\n\nappellate court essentially finding law, the majority ends any\n\nsearch for the truth through continued examination of the medical\n\nevidence by the trial courts.     It locks in an answer that binds all\n\ntrial courts in the circuit:      no prison may be required to provide\n\nSRS to a prisoner who suffers from gender dysphoria as long as a\n\nprison   official   calls    up    Ms.    Osborne   or   Dr.   Schmidt.36\n\nAcknowledging that the majority may well be correct on the facts,\n\nI nevertheless decline the invitation to join the majority in\n\nembracing the authority to decide the facts.        I suspect that our\n\ncourt will devote some effort in the coming years to distinguishing\n\nthis case, and eventually reducing it to a one-off reserved only\n\nfor transgender prisoners.\n\n\n\n\n36\n    No prisoner is likely to have a more favorable record than\nKosilek.\n\n                                  -117-\n\f",

This case involves important\n\nissues   that   arise   under    the    Eighth   Amendment   to   the   U.S.\n\nConstitution. We are asked to determine whether the district court\n\nerred in concluding that the Massachusetts Department of Correction\n\n(\"DOC\") has violated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the\n\nEighth Amendment by providing allegedly inadequate medical care to\n\nprisoner Michelle Kosilek (\"Kosilek\").           More precisely, we are\n\nfaced with the question whether the DOC's choice of a particular\n\nmedical treatment is constitutionally inadequate, such that the\n\ndistrict court acts within its power to issue an injunction\n\nrequiring provision of an alternative treatment -- a treatment\n\nwhich would give rise to new concerns related to safety and prison\n\nsecurity.\n\n            After carefully considering the community standard of\n\nmedical care, the adequacy of the provided treatment, and the valid\n\nsecurity concerns articulated by the DOC, we conclude that the\n\ndistrict court erred and that the care provided to Kosilek by the\n\nDOC does not violate the Eighth Amendment.          We therefore reverse\n\nthe district court's grant of injunctive relief, and we remand with\n\ninstructions to dismiss the case.\n\n                            I.

In light of the expansive record, we recite here only the\n\nfacts necessary to clarify the issues on appeal.\n\nA.   Michelle Kosilek\n\n            Michelle Kosilek -- born in 1949 as Robert Kosilek -- is\n\nan anatomically male prisoner in her mid-sixties who suffers from\n\ngender identity disorder (\"GID\")1 and self-identifies as a female.\n\nIn 1992 Kosilek was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced\n\nto   a   term   of   life   imprisonment    without   parole    for   the   1990\n\nstrangulation of her then-wife, Cheryl McCaul, whose body was found\n\nabandoned in the backseat of a vehicle at a local shopping mall.\n\nSee Commonwealth v. Kosilek, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">449</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">668</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1996).\n\nWhile awaiting trial for McCaul's murder, Kosilek twice attempted\n\nto commit suicide.            She also once tied a string around her\n\ntesticles in an attempt at self-castration, but removed the string\n\nwhen it became painful.         Since 1994, Kosilek has been housed at\n\nMCI-Norfolk,     a   medium    security    male   prison   in   Massachusetts.\n\nThroughout the twenty-year duration of her incarceration at MCI-\n\nNorfolk, Kosilek has not attempted to harm herself.\n\n\n\n\n1\n   The term \"gender identity disorder\" has recently been replaced\nwith the term \"gender dysphoria\" in the medical community. See Am.\nPsychiatric            Ass'n,        Gender        Dysphoria,\nhttp://www.dsm5.org/documents/gender%20dysphoria%20fact%20sheet.pdf\n(last visited June 3, 2014). To maintain consistency with prior\nrelated litigation and evidence in the record, we continue to use\nthe term \"GID\" in this opinion.\n\n                                     -4-\n\fB.   Kosilek I\n\n           Kosilek first sued the DOC in 1992, alleging that its\n\nfailure to provide direct treatment for her GID was a violation of\n\nthe Eighth Amendment.     At that time, Kosilek was receiving only\n\n\"supportive therapy\" to cope with the distress caused by her GID.\n\nKosilek   initially   sought   both   damages   and   injunctive   relief\n\nrequiring the DOC to provide her with sex reassignment surgery\n\n(\"SRS\"), although only her claim for injunctive relief survived to\n\ntrial.\n\n           The district court issued a decision in 2002, in which it\n\nconcluded that Kosilek had proven the existence of a serious\n\nmedical need and had shown that her then-current treatment plan was\n\ninadequate. The court concluded, however, that the DOC was unaware\n\nthat a failure to provide additional treatment to Kosilek might\n\nresult in serious harm.    Moreover, it held that the DOC's failure\n\nto provide treatment was rooted, at least in part, in \"sincere\n\nsecurity concerns.\"    As a result, the court ruled that the DOC was\n\nnot in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\n\n           Despite finding for the DOC, the district court's opinion\n\nmade clear that Kosilek required additional treatment for her GID,\n\nand that the DOC would need to develop and implement an improved\n\ntreatment plan.       The court warned that a failure to provide\n\ntreatment in the future, now that the DOC was on notice of the\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fpotential for harm if only \"supportive therapy\" was provided, could\n\namount to an Eighth Amendment violation.\n\nC.   The DOC offers treatment\n\n           The DOC responded to Kosilek I by revamping its policy\n\nfor GID treatment.      In the past, the DOC had adopted a policy of\n\n\"freezing\" a prisoner's treatment at whatever level that prisoner\n\nhad attained prior to incarceration.            Hormonal treatment, for\n\nexample,   would   be   available   only   to   prisoners     who   had   been\n\nprescribed hormones prior to incarceration.            In place of this\n\n\"freeze-frame\" policy, after Kosilek I the DOC adopted a plan that\n\nallowed prisoners to receive additional treatment beyond the level\n\nof that received before entering prison, when such care was\n\nmedically required.       Under this new plan, medical recommendations\n\nwould be made by the University of Massachusetts Correctional\n\nHealth Program (\"UMass\"), a health-services provider contracted by\n\nthe DOC.    The DOC Commissioner and the DOC Director of Health\n\nServices were responsible for assessing whether any change in\n\ntreatment would create increased security concerns.\n\n           Kosilek was evaluated by Dr. David Seil, a gender-\n\nidentity specialist, who prescribed a course of treatment to\n\nalleviate the mental distress -- often referred to as \"dysphoria\"\n\n--   associated    with    her   GID.      In   line   with     Dr.   Seil's\n\nrecommendations, in 2003 the DOC began providing Kosilek with\n\nsignificant ameliorative treatment aimed at directly addressing the\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fmental distress caused by GID.          In addition to continued mental\n\nhealth treatment, she was provided female, gender-appropriate\n\nclothing and personal effects, and electrolysis was performed to\n\npermanently remove her facial hair.2        Kosilek also began a course\n\nof hormonal treatments recommended by an endocrinologist.            These\n\ntreatments resulted in \"breast development and shrinkage of her\n\ntesticles.\" All of the treatments described continue to be offered\n\nto Kosilek to the present day.\n\nD.   Consideration of SRS\n\n           In line with the Harry Benjamin Standards of Care (\"the\n\n\"Standards of Care\" or \"the Standards\"),3 Dr. Seil recommended that\n\nKosilek   be   considered   for   SRS    after   one   year   of   hormonal\n\n\n2\n  Facial hair removal was delayed because of difficulty finding a\nprovider that was willing to perform these services on Kosilek.\nThe minutes of the DOC's Executive Staff Meetings show that they\nproactively sought out service providers throughout this period of\ndelay, and electrolysis was completed in November 2004.\n3\n   The Standards of Care are a set of treatment recommendations\nissued by the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria\nAssociation that provide guidance on the treatment of individuals\nwith GID.   Relevant to Kosilek II is the sixth version of the\nStandards of Care.    See Harry Benjamin Int'l Gender Dysphoria\nAss'n, Standards of Care for Gender Identity Disorders, Sixth\nVersion (2001) (\"Standards of Care\"). A seventh version of the\nStandards of Care was published in 2011, and adopts the Harry\nBenjamin Association's new name. See World Professional Ass'n for\nTransgender Health (\"WPATH\"), Standards of Care for the Health of\nTranssexual, Transgender, and Gender–Nonconforming People, Version\n7 (2011). The Standards of Care \"are intended to provide flexible\ndirections for the treatment\" of GID, and state that \"[i]ndividual\nprofessionals and organized programs may modify\" the Standards'\nrequirements in response to \"a patient's unique . . . situation\" or\n\"an experienced professional's evolving [treatment methodology].\"\nStandards of Care at 1-2 (emphasis added).\n\n                                   -7-\n\ftreatment.4    Accordingly, in 2004 the DOC began the process of\n\nfinding   an   appropriate   professional     to       evaluate     Kosilek's\n\neligibility for, and the necessity of, SRS. At the DOC's Executive\n\nStaff Meetings there was some debate regarding who should be hired\n\nto conduct this evaluation.          The UMass Mental Health Program\n\nDirector, Dr. Kenneth Appelbaum, suggested that the DOC consult\n\nwith the Fenway Community Health Center (the \"Fenway Center\"). The\n\nFenway Center is a Boston-based facility focused on serving the\n\nlesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community.             In contrast,\n\nthe DOC's Director of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services,\n\nGregory   Hughes   (\"Hughes\"),   suggested   consulting        with   Cynthia\n\nOsborne (\"Osborne\"), a gender identity specialist employed at the\n\nJohns Hopkins School of Medicine who had experience working with\n\nother departments of correction regarding GID treatment.\n\n           Hughes expressed concern with using the Fenway Center\n\nbecause of \"the perception that their approach was to come out with\n\nrecommendations    that   globally    endorsed     a    full      panoply   of\n\ntreatments.\"    It was thought that Osborne, in contrast, \"may do\n\nmore objective evaluations.\"     Dr. Appelbaum noted, however, that\n\nthe Fenway Center's approach was, to his knowledge, probably \"more\n\n\n\n4\n  This treatment plan aligns with the Standards of Care's triadic\nsequence for GID treatment. This sequence begins with diagnosis\nand the provision of therapy, progresses to endocrine treatments,\nand culminates with consideration of SRS after at least one full\nyear living a \"real life experience\" in the preferred gender role.\nMany individuals with GID choose not to complete the full sequence.\n\n                                  -8-\n\fthe norm than the exception.\"    The DOC also recognized that having\n\na Boston-based treatment provider might more easily facilitate the\n\nprocess of Kosilek's evaluation.\n\n          The Fenway Center was retained by the DOC, and Kosilek\n\nwas evaluated by Kevin Kapila, M.D., and Randi Kaufman, Psy.D., in\n\na ninety-minute interview.   Drs. Kapila and Kaufman also reviewed\n\nKosilek's medical records.      On February 24, 2005, they issued a\n\nreport recommending that Kosilek receive SRS (the \"Fenway Report\").\n\nThe Fenway Report acknowledged Kosilek's positive response to the\n\ntreatment provided by the DOC.\n\n          Her joy around being feminized through hormone\n          therapy, facial and body hair removal, and her\n          ability to have access, and to dress in,\n          feminine attire and make-up is palpable.\n          These responses further suggest that being\n          able to express herself as female has been\n          helpful    in     alleviating    her    gender\n          dysphoria. . . .      [I]t is clear that her\n          increasingly feminine presentation has been\n          beneficial to her psychologically.\n\nNonetheless, it also emphasized that Kosilek remained significantly\n\ndistressed by \"having male genitalia, as well as not having female\n\ngenitalia.\"   In light of this continuing distress, the Fenway\n\nCenter doctors stated that \"it is quite likely that Michelle will\n\nattempt suicide again if she is not able to change her anatomy.\"\n\nThe report also concluded that Kosilek had fully progressed through\n\nthe Standards of Care's triadic sequence, and that she \"appear[ed]\n\nto be ready\" for SRS. SRS, the doctors believed, would most likely\n\n\"allow Michelle to have full relief from the symptoms of gender\n\n                                  -9-\n\fdysphoria\" and would quite possibly \"increase her chance for\n\nsurvival\" by greatly decreasing the potential for future suicidal\n\nideation.\n\n            The Fenway Report was received by the DOC and reviewed by\n\nDr. Appelbaum and his UMass colleague, Dr. Arthur Brewer.                   The\n\nUMass    doctors    informed    the   DOC    that    they   found    no   clear\n\ncontraindications to SRS, but noted that they were \"unaware of any\n\nother case in which an inmate has undergone sex reassignment\n\nsurgery while incarcerated.\"\n\n            After considering the information from UMass, the DOC\n\ndecided to have Osborne conduct a peer review of the Fenway Report.\n\nIn a letter to Osborne, the DOC stated that it was requesting her\n\nservices because \"[t]he treatment of Gender Identity Disorder\n\nwithin a correctional environment is a complicated issue and one\n\nthat the Department takes very seriously.               We are aware of the\n\nsubstantial expertise you possess in this area and hope that you\n\ncan     provide    us   with   assistance    in     determining     appropriate\n\n\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\ftreatment.\"5   On April 12, 2005, the DOC sent Osborne copies of all\n\nprevious medical evaluations of Kosilek.\n\n          On April 28, 2005, the DOC Director of Health Services,\n\nSusan Martin (\"Martin\"), wrote UMass, stating her concern that\n\nUMass had not \"address[ed] the lack of detail, clarity and specific\n\nrecommendations in the evaluation done by the Fenway Clinic,\" and\n\nhad failed to provide an independent recommendation as to the\n\nappropriateness of surgery. She also asked for specific logistical\n\ninformation, including a list of doctors who might provide the\n\nsurgery, what procedures would be performed, and what recovery time\n\ncould be expected.\n\n          On May 10, 2005, Drs. Appelbaum and Brewer replied,\n\nindicating that they deferred to the Fenway Center's recommendation\n\nof surgery, as they were not experts in the area of SRS -- a\n\nmedical procedure specifically excluded from their contract to\n\nprovide services to the DOC.    They provided a preliminary list of\n\nsurgeons to consider, none of whom were licensed to practice\n\nmedicine in Massachusetts.\n\n\n5\n    Osborne previously worked with the Virginia and Wisconsin\nDepartments of Correction regarding their treatment of prisoners\nwith GID. It is unclear from the record whether the Fenway Center\nhad previously developed treatment plans for GID within a\npenological setting. When the DOC asked what consideration the\nFenway Center gave to issues such as \"criminal history [and]\nviolence against women,\" the center responded that \"independent of\nother psychological disorders [Fenway experts] don't consider\ncriminal history, homicide, [or] brutality.\" On January 5, 2005 --\nbefore the Fenway Center released its report -- the DOC's Director\nof Health Services \"expressed concern\" about these omissions.\n\n                                -11-\n\f           On May 20, 2005, Osborne finished her peer review of the\n\nFenway Report.       She began by making clear that her review was\n\nlimited to reading and evaluating the reports of others.                     As a\n\nresult, she could not independently diagnose Kosilek, but she\n\nagreed with the conclusion that Kosilek suffered from GID.              Still,\n\nshe    disagreed    with    what    she   believed   to   be     a    lack     of\n\ncomprehensiveness in the report and an inclination to minimize the\n\npossibility of comorbid conditions.           Namely, Osborne highlighted\n\nthat   Kosilek     had   previously    been   diagnosed   with       Antisocial\n\nPersonality Disorder, a diagnosis neither confirmed nor denied by\n\nthe Fenway Report, and that the report included no indication that\n\nKosilek had been assessed for other pathologies likely to lead to\n\nself-harming behavior.        Osborne expressed belief that threats of\n\nself-harm or suicide should serve as a contraindication to surgery,\n\nand that such threats were not a valid or clinically acceptable\n\njustification for surgery.         In consequence, she disagreed with the\n\nFenway Center's statements that surgery was medically necessary as\n\na means to diminish the likelihood that Kosilek would attempt\n\nsuicide in the future.\n\n           Osborne's report also highlighted that the Standards of\n\nCare admit of flexible application, and noted that the Standards\n\nstate that \"the diagnosis of GID invites the consideration of a\n\nvariety of therapeutic options, only one of which is the complete\n\ntherapeutic triad.\"        She emphasized that \"[t]here is currently no\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\funiversal professional consensus regarding what constitutes medical\n\nnecessity in GID.\"\n\n           In reference to the Standards of Care's application in a\n\npenological setting, Osborne noted that the Standards of Care\n\ninclude a criterion that candidates for SRS exhibit \"satisfactory\n\ncontrol of problems such as sociopathy, substance abuse, psychosis\n\nand   suicidality.\"    She   believed       that    this   requirement   was\n\ninherently   in   conflict   with     the   Standard's     application   to\n\nincarcerated persons, as she felt incarceration indicated a lack of\n\nmastery over such antisocial leanings.             Moreover, Osborne noted\n\nthat non-incarcerated individuals often face external constraints\n\nin their choice of treatments or determine, as a result of their\n\n\"real life experience,\" that other, non-invasive treatments are\n\npersonally preferable to SRS. In consequence, she felt that it was\n\nunrealistic for inmates to expect \"that prison life [would] provide\n\nno constraints or obstacles to cross gender preferences\" and that\n\nit was \"outside[] the bounds of good clinical practice\" for care\n\nproviders to try to meet this expectation. Given the isolation\n\nattendant to incarceration, Osborne also emphasized that prisoners\n\nmight often lack awareness of the frequency with which individuals\n\nchoose alternative treatments over SRS.\n\n           After considering Osborne's peer review, Martin again\n\nreached out to the doctors at UMass.                On May 25, 2005, she\n\nexpressed continuing concern with the Fenway Report, highlighting\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fthat Osborne's peer review had raised at least three questions\n\nregarding the report's thoroughness: (1) why the report omitted\n\nconsideration of potential comorbidities; (2) why the report did\n\nnot rely on formal psychological testing, but only an in-person\n\ninterview; and (3) why Kosilek's claims that she would likely seek\n\nto end her life if not provided with SRS were seen to justify,\n\nrather than serve as a contraindication to, surgery.         Martin also\n\nexpressed dissatisfaction that \"the February 24, 2005 evaluation by\n\nthe Fenway Clinic does not indicate whether sex reassignment\n\nsurgery is a medical necessity for Michele [sic] Kosilek\" and\n\n\"fails to adequately address the issue of whether the current\n\ntreatment provided to Kosilek provides sufficient relief of the\n\nsymptoms of gender dysphoria.\"\n\n          A   response   from   Drs.   Appelbaum   and   Brewer   came   on\n\nJune 14, 2005.   The doctors made clear that they were not experts\n\nin the treatment of GID, and that they deferred to the Fenway\n\nCenter's treatment recommendation.       Referring to the differences\n\nbetween the preferred treatment plans of the Fenway Center and\n\nOsborne, the doctors reminded Martin that Osborne's report had\n\nemphasized the \"dearth of empirical research upon which to base\n\ntreatment decisions\" for GID and had highlighted the lack of\n\n\"professional consensus\" regarding the \"medical necessity\" of SRS.\n\n          The Fenway Center issued a follow-up report aimed at\n\nanswering Osborne's critique of its initial recommendation.              In\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\fthis report, Drs. Kapila and Kaufmann noted that suicidal ideation\n\nwas common among individuals suffering from GID, and that it often\n\ndecreased with the provision of care.                Therefore, the likelihood\n\nthat Kosilek would become suicidal if denied surgery was, to the\n\ndoctors, not a contraindication to her eligibility, but instead was\n\na symptom that could be alleviated by provision of SRS.                            The\n\ndoctors also disagreed with Osborne's belief that incarceration was\n\na   significant    contraindication           to   surgery,     noting      that   the\n\nStandards of Care specifically state that \"[p]ersons who are\n\nreceiving     treatment        for    [GID]    should   continue       to     receive\n\nappropriate treatment . . . after incarceration.                    For example,\n\nthose who are receiving psychotherapy and/or cross-sex hormonal\n\ntreatments should be allowed to continue this medically necessary\n\ntreatment . . . .\"\n\n            The Fenway Center doctors further discussed their belief\n\nthat   a    key   step    of    the    triadic      sequence,    the     \"real-life\n\nexperience,\" could occur in prison.                This treatment prerequisite\n\nrequires that an individual live full-time in their preferred\n\ncross-gender role for at least one year prior to being deemed\n\neligible for SRS.        The purpose of this requirement is ensure that\n\nGID patients have an opportunity to experience a full measure of\n\nlife in a cross-gender role, including the social scrutiny that may\n\narise among professional counterparts and peers.                       Prison, the\n\nFenway Center's doctors surmised, might be considered a \"more\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\fstringent\"    real-life     experience,     because   a   prisoner's   gender\n\npresentation would be subject to full-time monitoring by prison\n\npersonnel and other inmates.         The report concluded by reiterating\n\nthe Fenway Center's recommendation that Kosilek receive SRS.              The\n\ndoctors recognized that performing \"such a procedure would . . .\n\nbring up issues of housing and safety,\" but emphasized that\n\n\"hormone therapy and [SRS] are the only clinical treatments found\n\nto be effective for GID.\"\n\nE.   The DOC's Security Report\n\n             On April 25, 2005, the district court issued an order\n\nrequiring that the DOC conduct a review of any potential safety and\n\nsecurity concerns arising from the provision of SRS.             In the next\n\nmonth, the DOC worked to formalize its security concerns into a\n\nreport, which it eventually submitted to the court on June 10,\n\n2005.   As made clear by the minutes of the DOC's staff meetings,\n\nhowever, these security issues were a topic of discussion prior to\n\nthe court's order.         Previously, on January 5, 2005, the meeting\n\nattendees had discussed how and if Kosilek's prior violent acts\n\nagainst her wife should impact their evaluation and treatment plan.\n\nOn   April   20,   2005,    the   parties   discussed     potential   security\n\nconcerns that would arise should Kosilek be housed, post-surgery,\n\nin MCI-Framingham, Massachusetts' only female prison.            During that\n\nmeeting, DOC personnel noted that they were prepared to provide an\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fevaluation of general climate and security concerns implicated by\n\nthe provision of surgery.\n\n          On    May   19,   2005,     DOC    Commissioner   Kathleen   Dennehy\n\n(\"Dennehy\") convened a meeting with the Superintendent of MCI-\n\nNorfolk, Luis Spencer (\"Spencer\"), and the Superintendent of MCI-\n\nFramingham, Lynne Bissonnette (\"Bissonnette\"), as well as the DOC's\n\nlegal counsel. The purpose of this meeting was to formally discuss\n\nthe security concerns previously expressed by both superintendents\n\nin phone conversations with Dennehy. It was also an opportunity to\n\nbegin preparation of the report requested by the district court.\n\n          The    report     focused    mainly    on   issues   of   safety   and\n\nsecurity surrounding Kosilek's post-operative housing.                 Dennehy\n\nconveyed concern regarding housing Kosilek at MCI-Norfolk, noting\n\nthat approximately twenty-five percent of male offenders in the\n\nMassachusetts prison system are classified as sex offenders and\n\nconcluding that \"Kosilek would clearly be a target for assault and\n\nvictimization in a male prison.\"                The report also expressed\n\nconcerns with housing Kosilek at MCI-Framingham, including the\n\nabsence of single-bed cells, such that all inmates had to share\n\ncells, and the possibility that Kosilek's presence might exacerbate\n\nmental distress among the significant portion of MCI-Framingham's\n\npopulation that had previously experienced domestic abuse and\n\ntrauma at the hands of male partners.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\f           Given the stated infeasibility of housing Kosilek in the\n\ngeneral population of either MCI-Framingham or MCI-Norfolk, the\n\nreport considered segregated housing in a protected ward.       It\n\nexpressed concern, however, about the possible deleterious impact\n\non Kosilek's mental health caused by any housing solution that\n\nrequired long-term isolation.   The report also noted that it was\n\nnot within the DOC's ability to create a special ward for prisoners\n\nwith GID, given that these prisoners present a significant range of\n\ncriminal histories, security ratings, and treatment needs that are\n\nantithetical to co-housing.\n\n           On June 10, 2005, citing both its internal review of\n\nsafety and security and Osborne's reported concerns regarding the\n\nappropriateness of SRS, the DOC informed the district court that it\n\nhad chosen to continue Kosilek's current ameliorative treatment,\n\nbut not to provide her with SRS.\n\nF.   Kosilek II\n\n           Trial commenced on May 30, 2006, with what would be the\n\nfirst of three rounds of testimony.    For the sake of clarity and\n\nconcision, we summarize this testimony topically, rather than\n\ntemporally.   We begin with evidence regarding the standard of care\n\nfor treatment of GID.\n\n\n\n\n                                -18-\n\f            1.    Testimony related to medical necessity\n\n                     a.   Initial testimony\n\n            First to testify in 2006 was an expert witness for\n\nKosilek, Dr. George Brown, who had previously evaluated Kosilek in\n\n2001 and was an author of the Standards of Care.                      Prior to\n\ntestifying, Dr. Brown issued a written report assessing Kosilek’s\n\nreadiness   for    surgery    and     evaluating    her   current   mental   and\n\nphysical presentation, as compared with 2001. Dr. Brown noted that\n\nKosilek consistently presented as female and that \"[a]ccess to\n\nmakeup and female undergarments, laser hair removal, along with\n\nhormonal    treatments    .   .   .   have    all   seemed   to   significantly\n\nreinforce and consolidate the outward expression of [Kosilek's]\n\ngender identity as female.\"           Other positive effects of treatment\n\nwere also described:\n\n            Hormonal treatments have resulted in obvious\n            breast growth since my last assessment,\n            decrease in upper body strength, increase in\n            hip size, changes in amount and texture of\n            body hair, skin texture changes, testicular\n            volume decrease, and a large reduction in\n            spontaneous     erections    .     .    .    .\n            Psychologically, the effects of these combined\n            treatments have [included] . . . resolution of\n            depression, resolution of suicidality and\n            suicide gestures and attempts, improved mood\n            with reduction in irritability, anxiety, and\n            depression . . . .\n\nBased on his observations, Dr. Brown concluded that Kosilek was\n\neligible for SRS, having met all of the readiness criteria.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\f            Before the court, Dr. Brown's testimony emphasized that\n\nthe provision of female clothing and effects, hair removal, and\n\nhormones    had    resulted   in    a    lessening    of   \"the    severity     of\n\n[Kosilek's] dysphoria.\"       According to Dr. Brown \"[s]he was clearly\n\nless depressed, less anxious, less irritable . . . .               She was not\n\nsuicidal . . . .\"         Despite these significant improvements, Dr.\n\nBrown testified that he believed SRS to be an appropriate and\n\n\"medical[ly] necessary component\" of Kosilek's treatment.                       He\n\nrelated instances in which incarcerated persons who could not\n\ncomplete the triadic sequence6 exhibited an increase in negative\n\nsymptoms, including a resurgence of self-harming behavior.\n\n            Dr. Brown further testified that, if not granted surgery,\n\nhe believed Kosilek’s feelings of \"hopelessness will intensify,\"\n\nand that she would likely attempt suicide.                  In reaching this\n\nconclusion, Dr. Brown emphasized that \"other parts of the treatment\n\nplan [e.g., hormones, hair removal, and the provision of female\n\nclothing] . . . all contribute in their own way to a level of\n\nimprovement.\"      Nonetheless, he felt that, if Kosilek lost hope of\n\nreceiving   SRS,    her   current       treatment   plan   would   not   stop    a\n\ndeterioration of her mental state and the possible reemergence of\n\nsuicidal ideation.\n\n\n\n6\n   The steps of this sequence, if fully completed, progress from\nGID diagnosis and therapeutic treatment, through endocrine\ntreatment, and culminate -- after at least a one-year-long real-\nlife experience -- with the consideration of SRS.\n\n                                        -20-\n\f           Dr.   Kaufman   from   the   Fenway    Center    also   testified,\n\nreiterating   that   the   Fenway    Center      believed   SRS    to   be   an\n\nappropriate and medically necessary step in Kosilek's treatment.\n\nShe further stated her belief that, if not given surgery, Kosilek\n\nwould present a significant risk of suicide: \"if she's not able to\n\nhave surgery, I think that she'll be hopeless and feel helpless and\n\nat that point really will have nothing else to live for.\"\n\n           Next to testify was Mark Burrows (\"Burrows\"), who had\n\nbeen Kosilek’s treating psychiatrist for approximately five years.\n\nBurrows testified to Kosilek's strong desire for SRS, and to her\n\nfeelings of hope associated with completing the formalization of\n\nher gender presentation.     Burrows also stated that denying surgery\n\nwould likely have a negative impact on Kosilek's mental health. He\n\nbelieved that it was \"slightly\" \"more probable than not\" that a\n\ndenial of the surgery would result in Kosilek attempting to commit\n\nsuicide.   Burrows also spoke about his belief that, if given SRS,\n\nKosilek should not continue to reside at MCI-Norfolk, as \"the risks\n\ninvolved in her possibly being assaulted are obvious.\"\n\n           Dr. Appelbaum of UMass was also called as a witness for\n\nKosilek.   He testified as to UMass's trust in the Fenway Center's\n\nrecommendations, and to his belief that the DOC need not have\n\nsought out a peer review of the Fenway Report, given the Fenway\n\nCenter's expertise in the treatment of GID.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\f            Kosilek testified next.          She expressed the depth of her\n\ndesire   for     SRS,   and   she   stated   that   she    would    continue   to\n\nexperience mental anguish regarding her gender identity so long as\n\nshe had male genitalia.         If not provided with SRS, Kosilek said\n\nthat she \"would not want to continue existing [as an anatomical\n\nmale]\" and might instead attempt to commit suicide.                She disagreed\n\nwith the suggestion that treatment short of SRS could adequately\n\nrelieve her mental distress, stating that \"[t]he problem is my\n\ngenitals.      That's what needs to be fixed.\"          Kosilek also testified\n\nas to feeling discomfort in the all-male environment of MCI-Norfolk\n\nand having a strong desire to be transferred to MCI-Framingham.\n\nShe felt that the inmates at MCI-Framingham would be more accepting\n\nand welcoming of her than those at MCI-Norfolk.\n\n            The DOC offered testimony from Dr. Chester Schmidt, a\n\nlicensed psychiatrist and Associate Director of the Johns Hopkins\n\nSchool of Medicine.       Dr. Schmidt expressed his belief that Kosilek\n\nhad undergone an \"excellent adaptation\" through treatment with\n\nhormones, hair removal, psychotherapy, and the provision of female\n\ngarb.    These treatments had alleviated the severity of her mental\n\ndistress and allowed Kosilek to significantly consolidate her\n\ngender identity.        Dr. Schmidt acknowledged that, if not provided\n\nSRS, Kosilek's level of mental distress would likely increase, with\n\ndepression or attempts at self-harm possible.                  On the whole,\n\nhowever,    he    believed    that   her     positive     adaptation   and     the\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\fconsolidation of her gender identity indicated that the current\n\ncourse of treatment provided by the DOC was medically adequate.\n\nDr. Schmidt explained that the severity of dysphoria associated\n\nwith GID may \"wax and wane,\" with patients feeling depressed or\n\nhopeless at times, but generally being able to alleviate these\n\ndepressive symptoms with appropriate psychotherapy and medical\n\ninterventions.     He felt that these measures, in combination with\n\nKosilek's current course of treatment, would allow her to live\n\nsafely and maintain a level of contentment.\n\n            On    cross-examination,     Dr.   Schmidt   was     questioned\n\nregarding   his    alleged   rejection    of   the   Standards   of   Care.\n\nDr. Schmidt responded that he found the Standards of Care \"very\n\nuseful for patients\" and that he commonly requested that patients\n\nfamiliarize themselves with these Standards when they began to seek\n\ncare for SRS.       Asked if he had stricter requirements for SRS\n\neligibility than those in the Standards of Care, Dr. Schmidt\n\nemphasized that he neither \"advocate[s] for nor . . . speak[s]\n\nagainst the decisions for the cross-gender hormones or eventually\n\nfor surgery.\"     Rather, he believes such decisions are best made by\n\nthe patient, based on their personal needs and desires.            In line\n\nwith this belief, Dr. Schmidt stated that he does not specifically\n\nrecommend SRS, but at a patient's request he will release medical\n\nfiles and send a letter indicating that a patient is ready for\n\nsurgery to their chosen SRS provider.\n\n\n                                  -23-\n\f             Dr.    Schmidt    further   testified    that    he   viewed   the\n\nStandards of Care as \"guidelines.\"             He explained, however, that\n\n\"[t]here are many people in the country who disagree with those\n\nstandards who are involved in the [GID] field.\" Because of this\n\ndisagreement, Dr. Schmidt expressed hesitation to refer to the\n\nStandards of Care, or the recommendation for SRS, as medically\n\nnecessary.      He emphasized the existence of alternative methods and\n\ntreatment plans accepted within the medical community.                He also\n\nquestioned whether the Standards of Care's requirement of a real-\n\nlife experience could occur in prison, opining that the real-life\n\nexperience required a range of social and vocational experiences\n\nunavailable within a penological setting.\n\n             Osborne testified next, reiterating her agreement with\n\nKosilek's GID diagnosis, but disagreeing that SRS was a medically\n\nnecessary treatment.           In reference to the Standards of Care,\n\nOsborne testified that she fully agreed that SRS was an effective\n\nand appropriate treatment for GID.            She emphasized, however, that\n\nshe did not view SRS as medically necessary in light of \"the whole\n\ncontinuum from noninvasive to invasive\" treatment options available\n\nto individuals with GID.            Regarding Kosilek personally, Osborne\n\nindicated that she believed Kosilek's current treatment plan had\n\nbeen   highly      effective   in   allowing   Kosilek   to   feel   \"hopeful,\n\neuphoric, and not depressed\" about her gender identity.              Osborne,\n\nlike Dr. Schmidt before her, again expressed skepticism as to\n\n\n                                       -24-\n\fwhether a real-life experience could occur in jail, given that a\n\nsingle-sex environment necessarily limited the sorts of social and\n\nhuman interactions available.     Osborne agreed that not providing\n\nKosilek with SRS might give rise to possible suicidal ideation, but\n\nnoted that the DOC had significant expertise in treating prisoners\n\nexhibiting self-harming behavior.    She felt that Kosilek's current\n\ntreatment plan, in conjunction with protective measures aimed at\n\nensuring her personal safety, was an appropriate and medically\n\nacceptable response to Kosilek's GID.\n\n                   b.   The UMass report\n\n             Following the close of initial testimony, the district\n\ncourt ordered UMass to review the testimony of all medical experts\n\nand to issue a report regarding whether the treatment proposed by\n\nDr. Schmidt was an adequate method of treating Kosilek's GID.     In\n\nthis report -- submitted to the court on September 18, 2006 -- Drs.\n\nAppelbaum and Brewer made clear that they \"worked with and relied\n\nupon Dr. Kapila and Dr. Kaufman\" who \"assist[ed] to prepare this\n\nresponse.\"     The report stated that the UMass doctors \"have been\n\ninformed by Dr. Kaufman and Dr. Kapila that . . . trial testimony\n\n. . . confirms their opinion that Michelle Kosilek has a 'serious\n\nmedical need' because there is a 'substantial risk of serious harm\n\nif it is not adequately treated.'\"         In conclusion, the report\n\nreiterated that the Fenway Center believed Dr. Schmidt's proposed\n\n\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\ftreatment plan would not provide adequate care, and UMass endorsed\n\nthat conclusion.\n\n                    c.   The court-appointed expert\n\n             At the conclusion of the first round of testimony, the\n\ndistrict court decided to appoint an independent expert to assist\n\nin determining what constituted the medical standard of treatment\n\nfor GID.      On October 31, 2006, with the parties' input, the\n\ndistrict court selected Dr. Stephen Levine, a practitioner at the\n\nCenter for Marital and Sexual Health in Ohio and a clinical\n\nprofessor of psychiatry at Case Western Reserve University School\n\nof Medicine.    Dr. Levine had helped to author the fifth version of\n\nthe Standards of Care, and served as Chairman of the Harry Benjamin\n\nInternational Gender Dysphoria Association's Standards of Care\n\nCommittee.\n\n             A month after his appointment, Dr. Levine issued a\n\nwritten report. The report began by explaining the dual roles that\n\nWPATH   --    formerly   the   Harry   Benjamin   Association   and   the\n\norganization that wrote the Standards of Care -- plays in its\n\nprovision of care to individuals with GID:\n\n             WPATH is supportive to those who want sex\n             reassignment surgery (SRS). . . . Skepticism\n             and strong alternate views are not well\n             tolerated. Such views have been known to be\n             greeted with antipathy from the large numbers\n             of nonprofessional adults who attend each [of]\n             the organization's biennial meetings. . . .\n\n                    The [Standards of Care are] the product\n             of an enormous effort to be balanced, but it\n\n                                   -26-\n\f          is not a politically neutral document. WPATH\n          aspires to be both a scientific organization\n          and an advocacy group for the transgendered.\n          These aspirations sometimes conflict.      The\n          limitations of the [Standards of Care],\n          however, are not primarily political.     They\n          are caused by the lack of rigorous research in\n          the field.\n\nDr. Levine further emphasized that \"large gaps\" exist in the\n\nmedical community's knowledge regarding the long-term effects of\n\nSRS and other GID treatments in relation to its positive or\n\nnegative correlation to suicidal ideation.\n\n          Dr. Levine next discussed the possibility of Kosilek\n\nhaving a real-life experience in prison.     He explained that the\n\nFenway Center, in stating that a real-life experience could be had\n\nin prison, \"failed to offer a mild caveat that the real life test\n\nwas designed to test the patients' capacity to function as a female\n\nin the community by mastering the demands of . . . family, social\n\nrelationships,   educational   accomplishment,   [and]   vocational\n\nperformance.\"    Such experiences and relationships, Dr. Levine\n\nnoted, are not a part of Kosilek's daily life in prison.       Dr.\n\nLevine's final conclusion was that:\n\n          Dr. Schmidt's view, however unpopular and\n          uncompassionate in the eyes of some experts in\n          GID, is within prudent professional community\n          standards.   Treatment stopping short of SRS\n          would   be   considered   adequate   by   many\n          psychiatrists, gender team members, and gender\n          patients themselves, if Kosilek were a citizen\n          in the community. . . . [T]here are a number\n          of acceptable community standards which derive\n          from differing assumptions about disorders,\n\n\n                               -27-\n\f             their causes,     and    the    possible   effective\n             interventions.\n\nHe recognized that the different treatment plans advocated by Dr.\n\nSchmidt and the Fenway Center \"each . . . [had] merit,\" as well as\n\nlimitations.    Dr. Levine further wrote that doctors generally \"do\n\nnot recommend treatment to GID patients. . . .                The decision is\n\n[the patient's], when and if they still want it.\"\n\n             Dr. Levine testified on December 16, 2006.                He first\n\nreiterated    his   belief    that   Dr.    Schmidt's   view,      although   not\n\npreferred by some GID specialists, was within \"prudent professional\n\nstandards.\"    He noted that Kosilek had received significant relief\n\non her current treatment plan, and that many patients with GID live\n\ncomfortably without completing the triadic sequence.                He believed\n\nthat Kosilek had already successfully consolidated her gender\n\nidentity, such that the removal of her male genitalia might relieve\n\ndysphoria, but it was not necessary to complete that consolidation.\n\nHe   also   indicated   variability        and   difficulty   in    forecasting\n\ndepressive symptoms and self-harming behavior in GID patients.                He\n\nexplained that he believed Kosilek would certainly express deep\n\ndisappointment if denied SRS -- described as the sole current focus\n\nof her life -- but that coping mechanisms might well change her\n\noutlook in months and years to come, allowing her to live happily\n\nwithout the provision of SRS.\n\n             The district court then asked Dr. Levine to narrow the\n\nlens of his inquiry by presuming that there were absolutely no\n\n                                     -28-\n\fexternal contraindications to surgery and that Kosilek had indeed\n\nhad a real-life experience in prison.         Given these presumptions,\n\nthe court asked Dr. Levine to testify as to whether it would still\n\nbe   prudent   to   not   provide   Kosilek   with   SRS.    Dr.   Levine\n\nacknowledged his belief that prudent professionals would generally\n\nnot deny surgery to a fully eligible individual.               Still, he\n\nhesitated to declare Dr. Schmidt's approach medically unacceptable.\n\nHe answered that the provision of SRS would surely be a prudent\n\ncourse of treatment, but then stated that \"I also believe it's\n\nprudent not to give her Sex Reassignment Surgery for lots of\n\nreasons.\" He again emphasized for the court that the treatment of\n\nGID was an evolving field, in which practitioners could reasonably\n\ndiffer in their preferred treatment methods.         Dr. Levine explained\n\nthat in many instances patients cannot or do not want to receive\n\nSRS, and prudent physicians commonly employ a range of treatments\n\nto ameliorate these patients' dysphoria.\n\n                    d.    Additional rounds of testimony\n\n           Several witnesses were recalled for additional testimony.\n\nDrs. Kapila and Kaufman appeared again on behalf of Kosilek.        Both\n\nreiterated their belief that Kosilek had a serious medical need and\n\nthat, given Kosilek's high risk of suicide if denied the surgery,\n\nSRS was the only adequate treatment plan.            Dr. Appelbaum also\n\ntestified again, as did the UMass Medical Director.           Both UMass\n\n\n\n\n                                    -29-\n\fdoctors   reaffirmed     their   endorsement    of   the   Fenway   Center's\n\ntreatment recommendations.\n\n           Kosilek also presented additional witness testimony from\n\nDr. Marshall Forstein, Associate Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard\n\nMedical   School,   who    had   previously    evaluated    Kosilek    during\n\nKosilek I. Dr. Forstein issued a written report, in which he noted\n\nthat \"the question of the most prudent form of treatment is\n\ncomplicated by the diagnosis of GID being on the margins of typical\n\nmedical practice.\" Despite this recognition, he testified that he\n\nbelieved SRS was necessary for Kosilek.         He felt that, if she was\n\nnot given SRS, there was a significant risk that Kosilek would\n\nattempt suicide or self-mutilation. Although Dr. Forstein believed\n\nthat psychotherapy might \"help with frustration, with harassment,\n\nand with depression,\" he was uncertain whether Kosilek could ever\n\nfully \"reconcile with being incompletely transitioned.\"\n\n           2.   Testimony regarding safety and security concerns\n\n                    a.    Initial testimony\n\n           In line with the June 10, 2005, security report prepared\n\nby Commissioner Dennehy, multiple DOC officials testified regarding\n\nthe safety and security concerns that were likely to arise if\n\nKosilek was provided SRS.\n\n           First to testify was Spencer, who at that time served as\n\nSuperintendent of MCI-Norfolk.        Spencer began by explaining the\n\ngeneral layout and security measures at MCI-Norfolk.                  He also\n\n\n                                    -30-\n\fexplained that the prison had, so far, successfully been able to\n\naccommodate Kosilek's receipt of care without incident.                 Spencer\n\nwas unaware of any issues or incidents of harassment related to\n\nKosilek's breast growth and increasingly feminine appearance.                He\n\nstated, however, that he would have significant concerns housing an\n\nanatomically female prisoner in MCI-Norfolk, an all-male prison.\n\nDespite the lack of historical incidents specific to Kosilek, he\n\nemphasized that \"inmates do get assaulted, inmates have been raped\n\n. . . [a]nd putting a female in a correctional environment like\n\nMCI-Norfolk would be of high concern to me.\"           If Kosilek remained\n\nat MCI-Norfolk, Spencer testified that he believed she would only\n\nbe   safe   if   housed   in   the   Special   Management   Unit,   a    highly\n\nrestricted secure building separated from the general population.\n\n            Bissonnette,       Superintendent    of   MCI-Framingham,      also\n\ntestified about the security concerns she believed would arise if\n\nKosilek was transferred to the all-female prison after receiving\n\nSRS.    She explained that MCI-Framingham does not have private\n\ncells, save for the segregation and medical units.             All women in\n\nthe general population are required to cohabitate, and that prison\n\nwould be unable to provide a single-occupancy cell for Kosilek.\n\nShe also explained that Kosilek's presence could create significant\n\ndisruption in MCI-Framingham's population, given that Kosilek had\n\nbeen convicted for violently murdering her wife, and that a\n\n\n\n\n                                      -31-\n\fsignificant portion of women at MCI-Framingham were victims of\n\ndomestic abuse.\n\n             Bissonnette acknowledged that there were procedures in\n\nplace designed to help women cope with exposure to upsetting or\n\ntraumatic experiences with other prisoners, but maintained that\n\nthese security concerns would require that Kosilek, if transferred\n\nto MCI-Framingham, be housed in the segregated Close Custody unit.\n\nBissonnette explained that she had significant hesitation about\n\nincarcerating anyone long-term in the Close Custody unit, given the\n\npotential negative effects of such long-term segregation.\n\n             Commissioner Dennehy also testified.     She described the\n\nsecurity concerns arising from cross-gender housing as \"obvious\" to\n\nany experienced corrections officer.       In line with her belief that\n\nthe safety and security concerns about post-operative housing were\n\nclear, Dennehy stated that she would not feel comfortable allowing\n\nSRS -- even if mandated by the court -- if she could not identify\n\nan adequate method of safely housing Kosilek after her operation.\n\nDennehy reiterated Spencer's and Bissonnette's concerns, stating\n\nthat   she    deeply   trusted   both    Superintendents'   professional\n\njudgments regarding the security of housing Kosilek at their\n\nrespective facilities.     Dennehy also explained why reliance on an\n\ninterstate compact to transfer Kosilek would be problematic.

She was also asked about any\n\ncontact with the then-lieutenant governor, who was another strong\n\nopponent of providing SRS to prisoners.      Dennehy stated that she\n\nwas aware of negative press reports and political opposition\n\nsurrounding Kosilek's request, but that her decision not to provide\n\nSRS was based only on security concerns and had not been influenced\n\nby this public pressure.\n\n          The district court recalled Dennehy on October 18, 2006,\n\nto ask additional questions regarding a growing amount of press\n\ncoverage surrounding the case.    Dennehy acknowledged that she was\n\naware of significant news coverage of Kosilek's case, but denied\n\npersonally following the story in the media.      She explained that\n\nthere were staff members within the DOC trained to deal with press\n\ninquiries and that she generally received only summaries of news\n\ncoverage from her staff.     Again, Dennehy strongly denied forming\n\nany opinion about correctional safety procedures based on media\n\nreports or public opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -33-\n\f                   b.   Commissioner Clarke\n\n           Dennehy ended her tenure as DOC Commissioner on April 30,\n\n2007, and in November 2007 the position was filled by Harold\n\nClarke.   After Clarke took over, the district court requested that\n\nhe familiarize himself with a selected number of trial transcripts.\n\nClarke was ordered to file a report, on the basis of those\n\ntranscripts, indicating whether he believed that the DOC had\n\nlegitimate reasons to refuse Kosilek's request for SRS.\n\n           Clarke's report, filed approximately a month after the\n\ndistrict court's order, stated that his conclusions were based on\n\nmore than three decades of correctional experience and were not\n\ninfluenced by political or media pressure.         He expressed concern\n\nregarding threats of suicide being used as a means for prisoners to\n\nreceive wanted benefits or concessions from staff.        Finding it to\n\nbe bad practice for prison administrators to give in to demands\n\naccompanied by the threat of suicide, Clarke stated that he\n\nbelieved the Massachusetts prison system had taken significant\n\nmeasures to ensure it was prepared to deal with suicidal ideation\n\namong its prison population.    In addition to considering the issue\n\nof suicide, Clarke's report reemphasized the significant post-\n\noperative security concerns expressed by his predecessor.               He\n\nstated that housing Kosilek at MCI-Norfolk created clear security\n\nconcerns related to mixed-gender prison populations, while housing\n\nKosilek   at   MCI-Framingham   would   pose   a   significant   risk   of\n\n\n                                 -34-\n\fdestabilizing that environment, given the number of women prisoners\n\nwho were victims of domestic violence.                    Clarke also stated his\n\nbelief   that    a    separate     unit    to     house   GID   prisoners    was    not\n\nfeasible, given that prisoners with GID might have a wide range of\n\nsecurity classifications and security needs, making cohabitation\n\nunsafe. In reference to the possibility of an interstate transfer,\n\nClarke reiterated the concern that any interstate transfer would be\n\ncompletely voluntary and that a receiving state might later decide\n\nto return Kosilek, at which time the housing concerns would\n\nreemerge.\n\n            Testifying before the court, Clarke acknowledged that he\n\nhad   received       several     letters    from    outraged     state   politicians\n\nclaiming that provision of the surgery would be an \"affront to the\n\ntaxpayers\" and citing state budget concerns as a reason to deny\n\nKosilek surgery.        The letters argued that a strained state budget\n\nshould not be used to accommodate what the legislators believed to\n\nbe an \"elective\" procedure and that the DOC would be \"unwise\" to\n\nprovide it.      Clarke, however, explained that he had not answered\n\nthese    letters,      as   he   believed       providing   an    answer    would   be\n\ninappropriate given his role as DOC Commissioner.                   He also denied\n\nbeing in any way influenced by cost concerns in reaching his\n\nconclusion regarding safety and security concerns. Clarke similarly\n\ntestified that he was aware of media coverage regarding Kosilek's\n\n\n\n\n                                           -35-\n\frequest, but he had not personally viewed the news or heard the\n\nradio stories.\n\nG.   Kosilek II\n\n           The    district   court    issued   an   extensive   opinion   on\n\nSeptember 4, 2012.      This opinion concluded that Kosilek had a\n\nserious medical need and that -- based on the court's belief that\n\nDr. Schmidt was not a prudent professional -- the only adequate way\n\nto treat this need was through SRS. Moreover, the court determined\n\nthat the DOC's stated security concerns were merely pretextual and\n\nconcluded that the DOC had in fact made its decision based on\n\npublic and political pressure. This, the court concluded, amounted\n\nto deliberate indifference under the Eighth Amendment. Stating its\n\nbelief that the DOC would continue to deny Kosilek adequate\n\ntreatment in the future, the district court granted an injunction\n\nrequiring that the DOC provide Kosilek with SRS.\n\n                             II.

The parties do\n\nnot spar over the fact that Kosilek requires medical care aimed at\n\nalleviating the harms associated with GID -- to the contrary, the\n\nDOC has provided such care since 2003.              Rather, the parties\n\ndisagree over whether SRS is a medically necessary component of\n\nKosilek's care, such that any course of treatment not including\n\nsurgery is constitutionally inadequate.           The parties' disparate\n\npositions on this issue are fit for succinct summary.\n\n             Kosilek argues that the only constitutionally sufficient\n\ntreatment regimen is to adhere to the Standards of Care's triadic\n\nsequence   in    full,   including   the    provision   of   SRS.   Kosilek\n\nemphasizes that doctors at both UMass and Fenway Clinic -- doctors\n\nhired by the DOC -- confirmed at trial that SRS was \"medically\n\nnecessary.\"      The failure to provide treatment, these doctors\n\ntestified, would almost certainly lead to a deterioration in\n\nKosilek's mental state and a high likelihood of self-harming\n\nbehaviors.      In light of this risk, and given that they believed\n\nKosilek had successfully met all eligibility criteria for SRS,\n\n\n                                     -46-\n\fthese doctors believed that any course of treatment excluding SRS\n\nis insufficient to treat Kosilek's GID.\n\n          In contrast, the DOC argues that full progression through\n\nthe Standards of Care's triadic sequence is not the only adequate\n\ntreatment option, as Kosilek's GID may be appropriately managed\n\nwith treatment short of SRS.   The DOC maintains that the evidence\n\ndoes not meet the standards for negligent treatment of a medical\n\ncondition, much less the higher Eighth Amendment standard.      See\n\nEstelle, 429 U.S. at 106 (\"Thus, a complaint that a physician has\n\nbeen negligent in diagnosing or treating a medical condition does\n\nnot state a valid claim of medical mistreatment under the Eighth\n\nAmendment.\"); Watson, 984 F.2d at 540 (stating that \"simple medical\n\nmalpractice\" does not \"rise[] to the level of cruel and unusual\n\npunishment\").\n\n          Relying   on   the    advice    of   accredited   medical\n\nprofessionals, the DOC argues that its alternative course of\n\ntreatment -- which provides Kosilek such alleviative measures as\n\npsychotherapy, hormones, electrolysis, and the provision of female\n\ngarb and accessories -- is sufficient to treat Kosilek's GID and\n\nfar exceeds a level of care that would be \"so inadequate as to\n\nshock the conscience.\"    See Torraco, 923 F.2d at 235 (quoting\n\nSires, 834 F.2d at 13). Moreover, this course of treatment has, in\n\npractice, greatly diminished Kosilek's mental distress and allowed\n\nher a fair measure of contentment.    Should suicidal ideation arise\n\n\n                               -47-\n\fin the future, the DOC contends that -- based on the advice of its\n\nmedical experts and its own penological experience -- it would be\n\nable   to    address    that    future      risk      appropriately      through\n\npsychotherapy and antidepressants.\n\n            We begin by discussing the district court's conclusions\n\nregarding the objective prong.              We then examine de novo the\n\nquestion    whether    the   treatment      offered    was   constitutionally\n\nadequate.\n\n            1.    The district court's medical prudence determination\n\n            The   district   court   ruled     that    SRS   was   a   medically\n\nnecessary treatment, and that Dr. Schmidt's alternative belief was\n\noutside the bounds of medical prudence.9               However, the court's\n\nfinding that Dr. Schmidt's views were medically imprudent was based\n\non several erroneous determinations.\n\n            First, the court ruled that, unlike prudent medical\n\nprofessionals, Dr. Schmidt did not \"follow\" the Standards of Care\n\nin his treatment of GID.       This finding ignored critical nuance in\n\nDr. Schmidt's testimony and based its conclusion on a severely\n\nstrained reading of Dr. Levine's expert testimony.\n\n\n\n\n9\n  For the sake of clarity, we reiterate that medical imprudence --\nwithout more -- is insufficient to establish an Eighth Amendment\nviolation. See Estelle, 429 U.S. at 105-06; Watson, 984 F.2d at\n540. Instead, a prisoner must satisfy both prongs of the Eighth\nAmendment inquiry, proving that the level of care provided is\n\"sufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate indifference to\nserious medical needs.\" Estelle, 429 U.S. at 106.\n\n                                     -48-\n\f              As an initial matter, the Standards of Care themselves\n\nadmit    of   significant     flexibility   in   their    interpretation   and\n\napplication.      They state, for example, that \"[t]he Standards of\n\nCare [a]re Clinical Guidelines\" and are \"intended to provide\n\nflexible directions\" to medical professionals in crafting treatment\n\nplans.    Standards of Care at 1 (emphases added).           The Standards of\n\nCare also specifically warn that \"[a]ll readers should be aware of\n\nthe limitations of knowledge in this area.\"              Standards of Care at\n\n1.       \"Individual   professionals    and      organized    programs,\"   the\n\nStandards of Care continue on, \"may modify [the standards]\" as\n\nappropriate.      Id. at 2.    Dr. Levine's testimony acknowledged this\n\nflexibility:\n\n              [DR. LEVINE]: [T]he \"Standards of Care\" was a\n              consensus document from people from seven\n              different countries or something, you know,\n              who come from different systems, and it was a\n              political process that forged together a set\n              of standards . . . .      So \"prudent\" is a\n              wonderful word, but it's not like it has one\n              simple definition.\n\n              . . .\n\n              THE COURT: But is this an area in which you\n              think prudent professionals can reasonably\n              differ as to what is at least minimally\n              adequate treatment for this condition?\n\n              [DR. LEVINE]: Yes, and do.\n\n\n              Moreover, the district court put great weight on the fact\n\nthat the Standards of Care require that patients receive two\n\nletters of recommendation prior to SRS.               The court concluded,\n\n                                     -49-\n\ftherefore,    that   \"prudent    professionals     who   treat   individuals\n\nsuffering from severe gender identity disorders write such letters\n\nof recommendation,\" and it faulted Dr. Schmidt as imprudent for his\n\nfailure to engage in this practice.          In so doing, the court relied\n\non Dr. Levine's testimony, which it believed stated that a prudent\n\nprofessional       would   not    \"[refuse]      to   write      letters     of\n\nrecommendation.\"\n\n             Dr.   Schmidt's    testimony,    however,   makes    clear    that\n\nalthough he does not advocate or recommend surgery to his patients,\n\nif a patient chooses to seek SRS, he releases all of their medical\n\nfiles to a surgeon and writes that surgeon a letter confirming that\n\nthe patient is eligible for surgery.           Insofar as Dr. Schmidt had\n\nnot advocated for the surgery, this neutrality aligns with what Dr.\n\nLevine describes as the accepted practice for doctors in the\n\ntreatment of GID: \"[i]f the patient meets eligibility requirements\n\n. . . we then write a letter of support . . . I understand how\n\nothers may perceive this as a recommendation . . . [but] we tell\n\nourselves we are opening a gate to their decision.\"               Therefore,\n\nwhatever the semantic force of the district court's distinction, we\n\nsee no material difference between the letters written by Dr.\n\nSchmidt confirming a patient's readiness for surgery and what the\n\nStandards of Care refers to as a letter of recommendation.\n\n             The district court next concluded that Dr. Schmidt was\n\nimprudent because antidepressants and psychotherapy alone are\n\n\n                                    -50-\n\finadequate to treat GID.    Again, the court claimed that it relied\n\non the testimony of Dr. Levine, but misconstrued his testimony in\n\nsupport of its conclusion.       Dr. Levine did in fact state that\n\n\"gender dysphoria is not significantly ameliorated . . . by\n\ntreating [patients] with a prozac-like drug alone.\"          He continued\n\non, however, to explain that he did not believe this was the\n\ntreatment plan advocated by Dr. Schmidt or the DOC.                To the\n\ncontrary, he understood that Kosilek would continue to receive\n\nameliorative treatment for her GID and, if she entered a depressive\n\nor   suicidal   state   based   on    her   inability   to   receive   SRS,\n\nantidepressants and psychotherapy would be used to help stabilize\n\nher mental state so as to alleviate the risk of suicide while\n\nworking with her to craft new perspectives and life goals beyond\n\nsurgery.   He felt that the treatment might well be successful in\n\nthis capacity, when combined with the direct alleviative treatments\n\ncurrently provided.\n\n           Finally, the district court found Dr. Schmidt imprudent\n\nbecause he did not believe that a real-life experience could occur\n\nin prison, given that it was an isolated, single-sex environment.\n\nThe district court disagreed, stating that it had concluded a real-\n\nlife experience could occur in prison, as Kosilek would remain\n\nincarcerated for her entire life.       In reaching this determination,\n\nthe court made a significantly flawed inferential leap: it relied\n\non its own -- non-medical -- judgment about what constitutes a\n\n\n                                     -51-\n\freal-life experience to conclude that Dr. Schmidt's differing\n\nviewpoint      was     illegitimate      or     imprudent.          Prudent    medical\n\nprofessionals, however, do reasonably differ in their opinions\n\nregarding the requirements of a real-life experience -- and this\n\nreasonable difference in medical opinions is sufficient to defeat\n\nKosilek's argument.

This viewpoint aligned with that of Dr.\n\nSchmidt and Osborne.           And, although Dr. Forstein's written report\n\nappears to presume Kosilek had completed a real-life experience, it\n\nechoed this same point: \"being in prison has helped [Kosilek]\n\nconsolidate her desire . . . simplifying the issues, without the\n\nstressors and choices that she would have had to make out in the\n\noutside real world.\"           We find no support for the district court's\n\nconclusion that no reasonable medical expert could opine that\n\nKosilek lacked real-life experience, particularly in light of the\n\ncontrary testimony from medical experts concerning the range of\n\n\n                                         -52-\n\fsocial, environmental, and professional considerations that are\n\nnecessary to constitute a real-life experience under the Standards\n\nof Care.     The district court thus erred by substituting its own\n\nbeliefs for those of multiple medical experts.10\n\n             The district court's finding of medical imprudence relied\n\nheavily on inferences we do not believe can rightly be drawn from\n\nDr. Levine's testimony; this finding also ignored significant\n\ncontrary evidence regarding the breadth and variety of acceptable\n\ntreatments for GID within the medical community.11       Its conclusion\n\nthat   the   Fenway   Center's   recommendation   constituted   the   sole\n\nacceptable treatment plan is, thus, contradicted by the record.\n\n\n\n10\n    There are obvious reasons for the range of judgments in this\narea.    Although the medical experts disagreed over whether\nexperience in a prison setting could qualify as real-life\nexperience, none of the experts who opined that it could do so\nappear to have considered the fact that after SRS, Kosilek would\nmost likely be housed in the drastically different setting of a\nfemale facility. This distinction was reflected in Dr. Forstein's\nreport, which stated that \"[Kosilek's] 'real life experience' leads\nher to the conclusion that so long as she is in a male prison . . .\nshe cannot perceive herself as a true woman.\"       This statement\nacknowledges that any real-life experience available to Kosilek was\nshaped by her current, all-male prison environment.         Kosilek\nintroduced no evidence to show that her experience there would\nsatisfy the requirement that she have real-life experience in her\npost-operative housing environment.\n11\n   The district court ignored or minimized significant portions of\nDr. Levine's testimony on the theory that the doctor had based his\nevaluation of medical prudence on the \"erroneous assumption[]\" that\nKosilek may not have had a real-life experience in prison and faced\nno other extrinsic obstacles to surgery. As explained above, in\ndoing so the court improperly supplanted a question of medical\nopinion -- on which experts may differ -- with its own decision\nbased on a layman's view, and terming all contrary views imprudent.\n\n                                   -53-\n\f           2.    Adequacy of the DOC's treatment plan\n\n           Regarding the medical adequacy of Kosilek's treatment,\n\nthe district court held that psychotherapy and antidepressants\n\nalone would not adequately treat Kosilek's GID.              This finding\n\nmischaracterizes the issues on appeal and unduly minimizes the\n\nnature of the DOC's preferred treatment plan.          The DOC does not\n\nclaim   that    treating   Kosilek's   GID   merely   with   therapy   and\n\nantidepressants alone would constitute adequate care.          Cf. Fields\n\nv.

In addition to\n\nalleviating her depressive state, this treatment has also resulted\n\nin   significant   physical   changes       and   an    increasingly   feminine\n\nappearance.\n\n            The significance of a future risk of suicidality is not\n\none that this court takes lightly, and Kosilek is right to note\n\nthat a clear risk of future harm may suffice to sustain an Eighth\n\n\n                                     -55-\n\fAmendment claim.

Therefore an assessment of the\n\ngravity of that risk, and its appropriate treatment, must encompass\n\nthe entirety of the DOC's treatment plan, not merely the potential\n\naddition of psychotherapy and antidepressants.\n\n            Kosilek    is    provided     hormones,    facial   hair    removal,\n\nfeminine clothing and accessories, and access to regular mental\n\nhealth treatment.      The DOC also stands ready to protect Kosilek\n\nfrom the potential for self-harm by employing its standard and\n\naccepted methods of treating any prisoner exhibiting suicidal\n\nideation.   Trial testimony established that this plan offers real\n\nand direct treatment for Kosilek's GID.           It employs methods proven\n\nto alleviate Kosilek's mental distress while crafting a plan to\n\nminimize the risk of future harm.

We do not establish here a per se rule allowing a\ndissenting medical opinion to carry the day.           Rather, our\ndetermination is limited to the particular record on appeal, which\ninvolves a medical condition that admits of a number of valid\ntreatment options.    This fact was testified to by Dr. Levine,\nrecognized by the UMass doctors in their correspondence with the\nDOC, and corroborated by Dr. Forstein in his written report.\n\n   The DOC did not engage in a frenzy of serial consultations aimed\nat finding the one doctor out of a hundred willing to testify that\nSRS was not medically necessary.     Rather, it made a considered\ndecision to seek out a second opinion from an expert previously\nconsidered in its initial selection process. Our opinion rests on\nthe facts presented in this record, and we find merely that the\nregimen of care provided by the DOC -- which includes hormonal\ntreatments as well as feminine products, clothing, and hair\nremoval, and which has successfully alleviated the severity of a\nprisoner's distress -- is not sufficiently harmful to Kosilek to\nconstitute an Eighth Amendment violation.\n\n                                  -57-\n\fhistory and record of good behavior -- will create a de facto ban\n\nagainst SRS as a medical treatment for any incarcerated individual.\n\nWe do not agree.    For one, the DOC has specifically disclaimed any\n\nattempt to create a blanket policy regarding SRS. We are confident\n\nthat the DOC will abide by this assurance, as any such policy would\n\nconflict with the requirement that medical care be individualized\n\nbased on a particular prisoner's serious medical needs. See, e.g.,\n\nRoe, 631 F.3d at 862-63 (holding that the failure to conduct an\n\nindividualized assessment of a prisoner's needs may violate the\n\nEighth Amendment).\n\n           For another, this case presents unique circumstances; we\n\nare simply unconvinced that our decision on the record before us\n\ntoday will foreclose all litigants from successfully seeking SRS in\n\nthe future.     Certain facts in this particular record -- including\n\nthe medical providers' non-uniform opinions regarding the necessity\n\nof SRS, Kosilek's criminal history, and the feasibility of post-\n\noperative housing -- were important factors impacting the decision.\n\nD.   The Subjective Prong: Deliberate Indifference\n\n           1.    The DOC's reliance on medical experts\n\n           The subjective element of an Eighth Amendment claim for\n\ninjunctive relief requires not only that Kosilek show that the\n\ntreatment she received was constitutionally inadequate, but also\n\nthat the DOC was -- and continues to be -- deliberately indifferent\n\n\n\n\n                                 -58-\n\fto her serious risk of harm.         See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 844-45.13              On\n\nthe record presented, this is a burden Kosilek cannot meet.                      Even\n\nif   the   district   court    had        been    correct    in    its    erroneous\n\ndetermination that SRS was the only medically adequate treatment\n\nfor Kosilek's GID, the next relevant inquiry would be whether the\n\nDOC also knew or should have known this fact, but nonetheless\n\nfailed to respond in an appropriate manner.               See Wilson v. Seiter,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112626\"><a href=\"/opinion/112626/wilson-v-seiter/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 298 (1991).          In answering this question, it is not\n\nthe district court's own belief about medical necessity that\n\ncontrols, but what was known and understood by prison officials in\n\ncrafting   their   policy.         Id.   at     300   (requiring   a     showing    of\n\npurposefulness or intent on the part of prison administrators).\n\n            In this case, the DOC solicited the opinion of multiple\n\nmedical    professionals     and    was    ultimately       presented     with     two\n\nalternative treatment plans, which were each developed by different\n\nmedical experts to mitigate the severity of Kosilek's mental\n\ndistress. The choice of a medical option that, although disfavored\n\nby some in the field, is presented by competent professionals does\n\n\n13\n     Although the DOC has not specifically argued that the\nconflicting medical opinions preclude a finding of subjective\ndeliberate indifference, we do not find this argument waived. As\nwe have explained above, the subjective and objective analyses\noverlap. See supra note 7; see also Leavitt, 645 F.3d at 498. The\nDOC's contention that the district court erred in deeming SRS\nmedically necessary and in rejecting Dr. Schmidt's approach as\nimprudent necessarily entails the DOC's subjective belief that SRS\nwas unnecessary. The contrary position -- i.e., that SRS is not\nobjectively necessary but that the DOC did not disagree as to the\nneed for SRS -- would be wholly illogical.\n\n                                         -59-\n\fnot exhibit a level of inattention or callousness to a prisoner's\n\nneeds rising to a constitutional violation.14 Cf.

On the\ncontrary, the evidence was conflicting as to the medical need for\nSRS. The choice between reasonable medical views was not for the\ndistrict court to make, and the DOC remained entitled to reasonably\nrely on Schmidt's and Osborne's expert opinions. Moreover, even\nassuming arguendo that the DOC was on notice that its treatment was\ninsufficient, the DOC's continued refusal also rested on valid\nsecurity concerns, discussed below, such that its actions did not\namount to deliberate indifference in any event.\n\n                               -60-\n\fsomehow convert that choice into one exhibiting the sort of\n\nobstinacy and disregard required to find deliberate indifference.\n\nCf.

Nonetheless, rather\n\nthan deferring to the expertise of prison administrators, the\n\ndistrict    court   ignored    the    DOC's    stated     security     concerns,\n\nreasoning both that Kosilek could be housed safely and that the DOC\n\nhad not acted out of a legitimate concern for Kosilek's safety and\n\nthe security of the DOC's facilities. As explained below, this was\n\nin error.\n\n                    a. The DOC's concerns about safety and security\n                    were reasonable\n\n            Recognizing    that      reasonable        concerns   would    arise\n\nregarding a post-operative, male-to-female transsexual being housed\n\nwith male prisoners takes no great stretch of the imagination. See\n\nFarmer, 511 U.S. at 848-49 (summarizing evidence that a prison's\n\nrefusal     to   provide   segregated        housing     to   a   pre-operative\n\nmale-to-female      transsexual      could     pose     significant    security\n\nconcerns). At the same time, as particularly relevant in Kosilek's\n\ncase, the DOC's security report reflected that significant concerns\n\nwould also arise from housing a formerly male inmate -- with a\n\ncriminal history of extreme violence against a female domestic\n\npartner -- within a female prison population containing high\n\nnumbers of domestic violence survivors. Nonetheless, in dismissing\n\nthe DOC's concerns, the district court relied heavily on the fact\n\nthat security issues have not yet arisen within MCI-Norfolk's\n\ngeneral     population.       Rejecting       the     testimony   of   multiple\n\n                                     -62-\n\findividuals with decades of penological experience -- all of whom\n\nacknowledged the risk of housing a female prisoner at MCI-Norfolk\n\n-- the district court reasoned that Kosilek's past safety was\n\nindicative of a likelihood that she could reside safely at the\n\nprison after her operation.\n\n             This reasoning wrongly circumvents the deference owed to\n\nprison administrators: the appropriate inquiry was not whether the\n\ncourt believed that Kosilek could be housed safely, but whether the\n\nDOC has a reasoned basis for its stated concerns.                 Indeed, that\n\nKosilek had so far been safe within MCI-Norfolk's prison population\n\ndoes not negate the DOC's well-reasoned belief that safety concerns\n\nwould arise in the future after SRS.

See also Battista, 645 F.3d\n\nat 454 (explaining that creating a segregated treatment center to\n\nhouse a GID prisoner would \"pose administrative difficulties and be\n\nisolating\"). The deference awarded to prison administrators cannot\n\nbe defeated by such circular reasoning, which dismisses the DOC's\n\nconcern in one breath only to recognize its validity in the next.\n\n           The prison administrators in this case have decades of\n\ncombined experience in the management of penological institutions,\n\nand it is they, not the court, who are best situated to determine\n\nwhat security concerns will arise.

The DOC's judgment\n\n\n\nSRS was also acknowledged by Kosilek's treating psychologist, Mark\nBurrows, and by the Fenway Center doctors in their initial report.\n\n                                    -64-\n\fregarding post-operative housing is without doubt \"within the realm\n\nof reason,\" Battista, 645 F.3d at 454, and the district court's\n\nalternative belief as to the possibility of safely housing Kosilek\n\ndoes not suffice to undermine this reasonableness.\n\n          The DOC officials also expressed concern that providing\n\nKosilek SRS would incentivize the use of suicide threats by\n\nprisoners as a means of receiving desired benefits.       Although the\n\ndistrict court determined that, in this case, Kosilek's risk for\n\nsuicidal ideation was very real, this finding does not invalidate\n\nthe DOC's reasonable belief that providing SRS might lead to\n\nproliferation of false threats among other prisoners.\n\n          The DOC's concern -- regarding the unacceptable precedent\n\nthat would be established in dealing with future threats of suicide\n\nby inmates to force the prison authorities to comply with the\n\nprisoners' particular demands -- cannot be discounted as a minor or\n\ninvalid claim.    Such threats are not uncommon in prison settings\n\nand require firm rejection by the authorities, who must be given\n\nample discretion in dealing with such situations.             Given the\n\ncircumstances presented here, we cannot say that the DOC lacks\n\nreasonable security concerns.\n\n                   b.   Deference to the DOC's reasonable concerns\n                   about safety and security\n\n          The    district   court    ultimately   dismissed   the   DOC's\n\nconcerns as pretextual, reasoning that DOC was in fact acting in\n\nresponse to \"public and political criticism.\" The primary evidence\n\n                                    -65-\n\fon record tending to support this theory includes a press interview\n\nby Commissioner Dennehy, Dennehy's relationships with a state\n\nsenator and the lieutenant governor, and the acknowledgment that\n\nthe DOC was aware of negative news coverage regarding Kosilek's\n\nrequest for surgery.\n\n          In her testimony, Dennehy denied being influenced by such\n\nmedia and political pressures, and stated that the decision not to\n\nprovide SRS was founded in bona fide security concerns alone.   The\n\ndistrict court, however, found this testimony non-credible, and\n\nthis credibility finding is the sort of determination to which our\n\ncourt gives deference.     See Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(6).        Even\n\naccepting that Dennehy's motivations were colored by political and\n\nmedia pressure, however, does not take Kosilek's claim as far as it\n\nneeds to go.\n\n          As an initial matter, the fact that Dennehy was motivated\n\nin part by concerns unrelated to prison security does not mean that\n\nthe security concerns articulated by the DOC were irrelevant,\n\nwholly pretextual, or -- most importantly -- invalid on the merits.\n\nIn Battista, our court held that deference to the decisions of\n\nprison administrators could be overcome where those administrators\n\nadmittedly relied on inflated data, identified a security concern\n\nonly several years after refusing to provide treatment for an\n\nacknowledged medical need, and engaged in a pattern of changing\n\npositions and arguments before the court.    Battista, 645 F.3d at\n\n\n                               -66-\n\f455.   Such gross delays and misstatements were not present here.16\n\nRather, the DOC testified consistently that it believed the post-\n\noperative security concerns surrounding Kosilek's treatment were\n\nsignificant and problematic.17   Even if not entitled to deference,\n\nsee id., those concerns still matter insofar as they are reasonable\n\nand valid, and Kosilek did not put on any evidence showing that\n\nthey wholly lacked merit.18\n\n\n16\n   Great weight was placed on the fact that Dennehy told a reporter\nthat there were significant security concerns about post-operative\nhousing three days before she met with Superintendents Spencer and\nBissonnette. The record reveals, however, that discussions about\nhousing had previously occurred at Executive Staff Meetings, and\nDennehy testified that she had conducted phone calls with both\nSuperintendents prior to meeting to formalize their security\nreport.   This timeline, therefore, is far from sufficient to\nestablish that the DOC's security assessments were unprincipled or\ninvalid.\n17\n    That the DOC may have, in the district court's assessment,\nengaged in a pattern of prevarication regarding whether they\nunderstood that SRS was being recommended by UMass as medically\nnecessary, does not undercut the consistency with which they\nidentified safety and security concerns -- concerns which are\nwithin their expert province -- that would arise from the surgery.\n18\n    Kosilek did cross-examine Commissioner Clarke to show that a\ntransgendered prisoner had safely been housed in a Washington State\nprison under his supervision. Left unexplored, however, were the\nnumerous ways in which MCI-Norfolk's environment, facilities, or\npopulation might be distinct from this prison in Washington.\nNeither was there a comparison between that prisoner's criminal\nhistory and the criminal history of Kosilek. That an individual\nwas housed safely by Commissioner Clarke while employed in another\nstate does not rebut Superintendent Bissonnette's testimony that\nmoving her to MCI-Framingham would cause climate problems in that\nparticular prison.

Sampson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"353029\"><a href=\"/opinion/353029/leo-f-feeley-iv-v-george-sampson-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">570</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 371 (1st\nCir. 1978) (rejecting uniform housing conditions for detainees,\nwithout regard to their disparate criminal history, because\n\"Constitutional rights cannot be defined in terms of literal\ncomparisons of this nature\").\n\n                                 -67-\n\f              Second,   when   determining     the   appropriateness      of\n\ninjunctive relief, our focus must include \"current attitudes and\n\nconduct.\"      Farmer, 511 U.S. at 845 (\"'[D]eliberate indifference[]\n\nshould be determined in light of the prison authorities' current\n\nattitudes and conduct': their attitudes and conduct at the time\n\nsuit is brought and persisting thereafter.\" (quoting Helling, 509\n\nU.S. at 36)).      Dennehy has not served as DOC Commissioner since\n\n2007.   Given the age of this litigation and the changes in DOC\n\nleadership that have occurred since the suit was filed, the\n\ndistrict court's assumption that Dennehy's attitudes necessarily\n\ncarried over to her successors and governed their actions is\n\nunsupported by the record.        Although consideration of Dennehy's\n\nmotivation is surely relevant, it is insufficient to show that the\n\nDOC continued to be motivated by public pressure even after her\n\ndeparture, or that this is what motivates the DOC presently.\n\n              Indeed, it was Commissioner Clarke -- and not Dennehy --\n\nwho made the decision here.      And the only evidence tending to show\n\nthat Commissioner Clarke may have considered public and political\n\ncriticism were two letters received by Clarke -- who did not\n\nrespond -- from Massachusetts legislators. These letters, however,\n\nrelate almost in their entirety to concerns about the cost of SRS,\n\nand the district court soundly rejected any argument that the DOC,\n\nor   Clarke    specifically,   had   adopted   its   safety   and   security\n\nmeasures as a pretextual means of addressing the cost concerns\n\n\n                                     -68-\n\fraised by state legislators.        Moreover, Clarke was never found by\n\nthe court to be noncredible.19\n\n             The district court improperly imputed its belief that\n\nCommissioner Dennehy had acted out of concern for public and\n\npolitical pressure to its assessment of the motivations of future\n\nDOC Commissioners. This error ignores the requirement, in cases of\n\ninjunctive relief, that a court consider the attitudes and beliefs\n\nof prison administrators at the time of its decision.            Id. at 845-\n\n46.   The effect of this error is particularly clear given that\n\nClarke has now been replaced by Commissioner Spencer, so that\n\nDennehy is now several administrations and more than seven years\n\nremoved from the decisionmaking process.            Without proof that the\n\nDOC remains motivated by pretextual or improper concerns with\n\npublic pressure, even if it was assumed that Dennehy was improperly\n\nmotivated, the district court's finding that injunctive relief was\n\nrequired is unsupportable.\n\n                             III.   Conclusion\n\n             We are not tasked today with deciding whether the refusal\n\nto provide SRS is uncompassionate or less than ideal.               Neither\n\nfinding   would    support   Kosilek's     claims    of   a   constitutional\n\nviolation.      The Eighth Amendment, after all, proscribes only\n\nmedical care so unconscionable as to fall below society's minimum\n\n\n\n19\n   We further note that the DOC has not defended this case based\non cost considerations relating to the provision of SRS.\n\n                                    -69-\n\fstandards of decency.       See Estelle, 429 U.S. at 102-05.              In this\n\ncase, the DOC has chosen to provide a form of care that offers\n\ndirect treatment for Kosilek's GID.              Cf. Leavitt, 645 F.3d at 498\n\n(acknowledging that the effects of treatment decisions may be\n\nrelevant to consideration of the subjective component of the Eighth\n\nAmendment).     Moreover, it has done so in light of the fact that\n\nprovision of SRS would create new and additional security concerns\n\n-- concerns that do not presently arise from its current treatment\n\nregimen.\n\n            Given the positive effects of Kosilek's current regimen\n\nof care, and the DOC's plan to treat suicidal ideation should it\n\narise, the DOC's decision not to provide SRS does not illustrate\n\nsevere     obstinacy   or    disregard      of    Kosilek's     medical     needs.\n\nDesRosiers, 949 F.2d at 19 (\"[T]he complainant must prove that the\n\ndefendants had a culpable state of mind and intended wantonly to\n\ninflict pain.\").       Rather, it is a measured response to the valid\n\nsecurity concerns identified by the DOC.

Having reviewed\n\nthe record before us, we conclude that Kosilek has failed, on these\n\nfacts, to demonstrate an Eighth Amendment violation.               Accordingly,\n\nwe reverse the district court's order of injunctive relief and\n\n\n                                     -70-\n\fremand this case to the district court with instructions to dismiss\n\nthe case.\n\n            Reversed and Remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                    -Dissenting Opinions Follow-\n\n\n\n\n                                -71-\n\f           THOMPSON, Circuit Judge, dissenting.         The majority turns\n\na blind eye to binding precedent, opting instead to cobble together\n\nlaw from other circuits and non-Eighth Amendment jurisprudence to\n\nformulate a standard of review that, though articulated as one of\n\nvariable exactitude, amounts to sweeping de novo review.                Armed\n\nwith the ability to take a fresh look at findings that clearly\n\nwarranted deference, the majority easily steps into the trial\n\njudge's shoes -- the inarguable superiority of the judge's ability\n\nto marshal facts, assess motive, and gauge credibility all but\n\nforgotten. The parameters set by the majority foretold the result.\n\nIt concludes that the Massachusetts Department of Correction did\n\nnot   violate   Michelle    Kosilek's   constitutional     rights.      That\n\nconclusion is erroneous, the majority's analytical path to it is\n\nmisguided, and the fact that this case is even subject to en banc\n\nscrutiny in the first place is wrong.       And so I dissent.\n\n                             I. En Banc Grant\n\n           The criteria for en banc relief are clear: it is not a\n\nfavored form of relief, and ordinarily should not be ordered unless\n\n\"(1) en banc consideration is necessary to secure or maintain\n\nuniformity of the court's decisions; or (2) the proceeding involves\n\na question of exceptional importance.\"       Fed. R. App. P. 35(a).       My\n\ncolleagues'     reasons    for   granting   en   banc    review   are    not\n\narticulated, but it seems clear that the maintenance of uniformity\n\npiece is not in play.      Therefore I can only assume they perceive an\n\n\n                                   -72-\n\fissue   of    exceptional    importance.         This   justification      is\n\nproblematic.\n\n             As my colleague has explained in a series of thoughtful\n\ndissents, in this circuit there has been what some might see \"as\n\nthe recurring unprincipled denial and granting of petitions for\n\nrehearing en banc, without any attempt to define and apply a set of\n\nobjective criteria to determine when a case is of exceptional\n\nimportance.\"    Kolbe v.

I am at a loss to see what objective criteria\n\nwarranted review in this case.\n\n             While the relief ordered by the district court, and\n\naffirmed by a majority of the original panel, was unprecedented,\n\nKosilek's case is not a legally complicated one.            Rather it is a\n\nfact-intensive    dispute,   which    required   the    original   panel   to\n\ndetermine whether the district court's take on the significant\n\namount of evidence, and its ultimate holding as to the existence of\n\nan Eighth Amendment violation, was erroneous.           I fail to see what\n\nin this framework made this case worthy of en banc review.\n\n             I am not implying this case is unimportant.                This\n\nlitigation is significant to Kosilek, the DOC, and many others, and\n\n\n                                     -73-\n\fthe rights afforded under the Eighth Amendment are crucial. But if\n\nthose things alone were enough, nearly every case would attract the\n\nfull court's attention.   And a good deal more cases would be heard\n\nen banc if disagreeing with the result reached by the original\n\npanel, or simply desiring to weigh in, were valid grounds for\n\nawarding en banc review. They are not, but unfortunately I suspect\n\nthey were the grounds that carried the day here. See, e.g., Kolbe,\n\n738 F.3d at 474 (Torruella, J., dissenting) (\"En banc consideration\n\nis not for the purpose of correcting panel decisions.\") (citing\n\nCalderón   v. Thompson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118202\"><a href=\"/opinion/118202/calderon-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">538</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 569 (1998) (Souter, J.,\n\ndissenting)).\n\n           This case does not satisfy the well-settled requirements\n\nfor a grant of en banc.     Lamentably, a majority of this court\n\ndecided otherwise.    Similarly, a majority has decided that the\n\ndistrict court got it wrong.     That conclusion is fundamentally\n\nflawed, starting with the level of scrutiny paid to the lower\n\ncourt's decision.\n\n                      II. Standard of Review\n\n           The issue of what standard of review should be employed\n\nis a significant point of divergence for me, and indeed one that\n\npermeates the entirety of my discord with the majority.        The\n\nmajority, undoubtedly aware that it could more handily toss aside\n\nthe district court's findings if it utilized a non-deferential\n\nstandard of review, formulates its standard by borrowing liberally\n\n\n                               -74-\n\ffrom other circuits and non-Eighth Amendment jurisprudence while\n\ndisregarding on-point case law from this circuit.                  The end result\n\nis a standard that, in theory, afforded minimal deference to the\n\nlower court's finding, and in the majority's actual application,\n\nafforded essentially none.\n\n            Let me start with our common ground.                I agree with the\n\nmajority that different standards of review are in play.                         When\n\ndeciding a post-bench-trial appeal, this court takes up questions\n\nof law de novo, but reviews findings of fact for clear error only.\n\nWojciechowicz v.

The    majority,\n\nundoubtedly with a certain end result in mind, maneuvers the\n\nstandard    of    review    into    its   most    favorable     form.     While    it\n\ncorrectly    acknowledges          that    factual     and    legal     issues    are\n\nimplicated, the majority utterly favors the de novo end of the\n\n\n                                          -75-\n\fspectrum.20   This approach does not accord with our case law\n\n(although to read the majority you would think we had very little\n\non-point jurisprudence in this circuit).\n\n          For one, the majority posits that the issue of deliberate\n\nindifference is a legal one to be reviewed de novo.     It relies on\n\nFourth Amendment jurisprudence, citing criminal cases that, in the\n\ncontext of deciding the validity of searches and seizures, hold\n\nthat reasonable suspicion and probable cause determinations should\n\nreceive de novo appellate review.

The majority's slight spin on this holding allows it to\n\nignore Torraco, and lean on Fourth Amendment jurisprudence instead\n\nto support the notion that deliberate indifference gets a fresh\n\nlook from this court.\n\n             Similarly erroneous is the majority's position that we\n\nreview de novo the district court's ultimate determination as to\n\n\n                                   -77-\n\fwhether an Eighth Amendment violation occurred.         For support it\n\ncites to a series of Eighth Amendment cases from other circuit\n\ncourts.   See, e.g., Thomas v.

If\n\nnothing else, the existence of a constitutional violation sounds\n\nlike something that would fall closer to the question-of-law end of\n\nthe   spectrum.    The   problem   though   is   that    the   ultimate\n\nconstitutional question is inextricably tied up with the factual\n\ndetails that emerged at trial, the credibility of the witnesses,\n\nand the questions of motivation.      This counsels against pure de\n\nnovo review and our own case law supports this notion.\n\n          As explained above, a state-of-mind issue such as the\n\nexistence of deliberate indifference is typically left to the\n\nfinder of fact.   Torraco, 923 F.2d at 234.      And when reviewing a\n\ntrial judge's determination on the adequacy of medical treatment\n\nfollowing a bench trial, this court has applied the deferential\n\nclearly erroneous standard.

Thus the major pieces of the puzzle in an Eighth\n\nAmendment inquiry -- adequacy of medical care, the existence of\n\ndeliberate indifference, and the parties' motive and intent -- are\n\nsubject to the clearly erroneous standard, making unqualified de\n\nnovo review a bad fit.\n\n           Policy concerns do not counsel otherwise, making the\n\nmajority's reliance on Ornelas, 517 U.S. at 690, a Fourth Amendment\n\ncase, not particularly persuasive.21         Ornelas, which characterized\n\nthe ultimate reasonable suspicion and probable cause determination\n\nas a mixed question of law and fact, decided that de novo review\n\nwas the best fit for its resolution.          Id. at 696-97.   The Supreme\n\nCourt, as the majority points out, emphasized that \"[i]ndependent\n\nreview\" by appellate courts can help \"to maintain control of, and\n\nto clarify, the legal principles\" in reasonable suspicion and\n\nprobable cause cases.    Id. at 697.       While I do not disagree that as\n\nan   appellate   court   we   are   often    required   to   clarify   legal\n\n\n\n\n21\n    The majority also relies on United States v.

Specifically,\nthe majority states that in Bajakajian, the Supreme Court reasoned\nthat the \"'application of a constitutional standard to the facts of\na particular case' . . . may appropriately require de novo\nappellate review to ensure consistency in the law's development.\"\nBajakajian does not say this. The Court there did not address the\nconcept of consistency of the law; it simply cited Ornelas for the\nnarrower proposition that de novo review attaches to the issue of\nwhether a fine is constitutionally excessive. See id. 336, n.10.\nFor that reason I focus on Ornelas.\n\n                                    -79-\n\fprinciples and ensure continuity of the law's development, this is\n\nnot a persuasive justification for employing de novo review here.\n\n           As noted by the dissent in Ornelas, \"[l]aw clarification\n\nrequires   generalization,      and    some   issues   lend   themselves     to\n\ngeneralization much more than others.\"            Id. at 703 (Scalia, J.,\n\ndissenting).     The issues here do not.          Cases dealing with the\n\nconstitutional adequacy of medical care under the Eighth Amendment\n\nare incredibly fact-specific, resulting in distinctive issues. The\n\ntrial   judge   must,   among   other   things,   have   a    handle   on   the\n\nprisoner's medical condition, the treatment sought, the treatment\n\nprovided (if any), what treatment medical providers recommended,\n\nwhat the defendant knew and when, and what motivated its decisions.\n\nThis court cannot hope to match the district judge's expertise in\n\nthese areas, nor can I fathom why we would want to try.                     The\n\n\"extremely fact-bound nature\" of these cases means that \"de novo\n\nreview [will] have relatively little benefit,\" id. at 700 (Scalia,\n\nJ., dissenting), leaving us unmoved by the uniformity-of-the-law\n\nconsiderations raised by the majority.\n\n           So where does all this leave us with regard to the\n\nstandard that attaches to the determination of whether the Eighth\n\nAmendment has been violated? It is clear (and the majority agrees)\n\nthat with questions of varying exactitude, the \"standard of review\n\napplied depends, in the last analysis, on the extent to which a\n\nparticular question is fact-dominated or law-dominated.\" Turner v.\n\n\n                                      -80-\n\fUnited   States,   </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">699</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>    <span class=\"page\">578</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,   584   (1st   Cir.    2012)   (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted); see also In re IDC Clambakes, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">727</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 64 (1st Cir. 2013); Dugas v.

Drawing the distinction between law-heavy versus fact-\n\nheavy questions is sometimes a tricky thing to do, and given that\n\nestablishing an Eighth Amendment claim involves a mixed question of\n\nlaw and fact, it is a thicket into which we must enter.               Luckily,\n\nI do not think it is a particularly thorny one in this case.\n\n           Here,   before       reaching    its   ultimate    constitutional\n\nconclusion, the trial court heard testimony from no fewer than\n\nnineteen witnesses (e.g., medical providers, medical experts,\n\nprison officials, and Kosilek) over the course of a trial that\n\nultimately extended two years.          The court scrutinized events that\n\nhad transpired over a twenty-year period, including those relating\n\nto what treatment Kosilek had requested, what treatment had been\n\nrecommended, and what care was ultimately provided.                  The court\n\nconsidered evidence about the DOC's security review, how it was\n\nconducted, and the concerns it raised. It assessed the credibility\n\nof Kosilek, DOC officials, and the medical experts.                  The court\n\nreviewed a copious amount of exhibits, such as Kosilek's medical\n\nrecords, Kosilek's prison records, DOC policies, DOC contracts, DOC\n\nmanuals, reports from Kosilek's medical providers, reports penned\n\nby each side's experts, DOC staff meeting notes, security reports,\n\nmedical literature, correspondence, and deposition testimony.              The\n\n\n                                     -81-\n\fend result was pages upon pages of factual findings made by the\n\ntrial judge.22\n\n          In other words, the district court \"engaged in a careful\n\nand close analysis of the trial evidence,\"          Turner, 699 F.3d at\n\n584, to make its ultimate determination that the DOC, without any\n\nvalid penological purpose, refused to provide medically necessary\n\ntreatment for Kosilek's life-threatening condition.               Given the\n\nclearly fact-intensive nature of the court's review, our own\n\nexamination into whether the court was correct that the DOC\n\nviolated the Eighth Amendment should be deferential, as opposed to\n\nthe fresh look the majority proposes.23        See id.; Fed. Refinance\n\nCo., 352 F.3d at 27 (explaining that the more fact-intensive the\n\nquestion, the more deferential our review).         As ably said by the\n\nSupreme Court, \"deferential review of mixed questions of law and\n\nfact is warranted when it appears that the district court is better\n\npositioned   than   the   appellate   court   to   decide   the   issue   in\n\n\n\n22\n   Indeed the majority dedicates over thirty pages of its opinion\nto the factual and procedural background in this case. This is not\nsurprising; those facts are integral to the resolution of the\nconstitutional question.    What is surprising is the majority's\nfailure to see the significance of the factually concentrated\nnature of this case.\n23\n   Plus, even assuming that the conclusion that the DOC's refusal\nto provide care constituted an Eighth Amendment violation lands\ncloser to the law side of the mixed-question spectrum, a measure of\ndeference is still appropriate. See Battista v. Clarke, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"217138\"><a href=\"/opinion/217138/battista-v-clarke/\"><span class=\"volume\">645</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">449</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 454 (1st Cir. 2011) (\"The legal labels applied to facts are\nreviewed on appeal more closely than a district court fact-finding,\nbut often with some deference to the district judge.\").\n\n                                  -82-\n\fquestion, or that probing appellate scrutiny will not contribute to\n\nthe clarity of legal doctrine.\" Salve Regina Coll. v.

There is also\n\nits application.         While the majority's skewed standard allows\n\nminimal aspects of the lower court's decision to garner clear error\n\nreview, namely factual findings and credibility determinations, in\n\nactual application essentially no deference was paid.                   The only\n\nconclusion    of   the   district     court    that    the   majority   concedes\n\nwarranted deference was the judge's determination that Commissioner\n\nKathleen   Dennehy's      testimony    was    not     credible.24      Given   the\n\nvoluminous record in this case, and the breadth of the lower\n\ncourt's findings, it is simply unfathomable that the majority did\n\nnot consider a single other fact-drawn inference, credibility\n\nfinding, or motive determination, all of which warrant deference.\n\n             For instance, the district court drew inferences from the\n\nvarious medical providers' testimony to decide what constituted a\n\nprudent approach.        It also considered what Commissioner Harold\n\nClarke's motivations were for denying sex reassignment surgery. It\n\ndrew inferences from the DOC's conduct (e.g., the timing of\n\nsecurity   reviews   and    the   DOC's      communications     with    Kosilek's\n\n\n24\n   Of course the majority then goes on to explain why the court's\nadverse credibility determination does not matter, a point I will\nget into later.\n\n                                      -83-\n\fmedical providers) to determine that the DOC had engaged in\n\nprevarication and delay. The majority; however, does not appear to\n\nadjust its consideration of these issues to reflect any deference\n\nto the trial judge.        Rather it decides anew what inferences should\n\nbe drawn from the facts attested to at trial.                   Even under the\n\nmajority's standard, this is not proper.\n\n             Without doubt, the level of scrutiny applied by a court\n\npermeates its analysis and guides the outcome.               The impact here is\n\nclear. The Eighth Amendment is violated when prison officials fail\n\nto provide an inmate with adequate medical care, such that \"their\n\n'acts   or    omissions        [are]    sufficiently      harmful   to    evidence\n\ndeliberate indifference to serious medical needs.'\"                  Leavitt v.\n\nCorr.

For instance, the Standards\n\nof   Care    explained     that       sex    reassignment    surgery      is    not\n\n\"experimental, investigational, elective, cosmetic, or optional in\n\nany meaningful sense.\"      Standards of Care, Version 6, at 18.                Dr.\n\nSchmidt disagreed.         In his expert report, he wrote that sex\n\nreassignment   surgery     was    a    \"voluntary,    elective     choice[]     and\n\nprocedure[],\" calling the steps towards reassignment \"equivalent to\n\n\n25\n   The Standards state: \"Clinical departures from these guidelines\nmay come about because of a patient's unique anatomic, social, or\npsychological situation, an experienced professional's evolving\nmethod of handling a common situation, or a research protocol.\"\nStandards of Care, Version 6, at 2.\n\n                                        -86-\n\fa variety of elective cosmetic non-surgical procedures and elective\n\ncosmetic surgical procedures.\"        Another example: the Standards of\n\nCare   provide   that,   for   persons      with   severe    gender   identity\n\ndisorder, sex reassignment surgery is effective, and when paired\n\nwith   hormone   therapy   and   a   real-life      experience,    \"medically\n\nindicated and medically necessary.\"          Standards of Care, Version 6,\n\nat 18.   Dr. Schmidt again was not on board.                He testified that\n\ngenerally he does not believe that sex reassignment surgery is\n\nmedically necessary and his practice manifests this philosophy. In\n\nthe approximately 300 patients he had evaluated, Dr. Schmidt never\n\nrecalled seeing even one case of gender identity disorder serious\n\nenough to warrant surgery.26\n\n           For Dr. Schmidt, there was an additional wrinkle. In Dr.\n\nSchmidt's opinion, a real-life experience living as the opposite\n\ngender could not be effectively replicated in prison, and this\n\ncounseled against surgery for Kosilek.             The district court found\n\nthat this viewpoint was not prudent.          The majority claims that in\n\ndoing so the court \"relied on its own -- non-medical -- judgment\n\n\n\n26\n    The majority makes much of the district judge faulting Dr.\nSchmidt for not writing letters of recommendation for patients\nseeking sex reassignment surgery, suggesting that the judge did not\nappreciate the nuance between opening the door for surgery and\nadvocating for it. I suspect the judge was more broadly concerned\nwith the fact that Dr. Schmidt did not think sex reassignment was\never medically necessary, nor had he ever seen a case where it was\nwarranted.   And despite having this strident perspective, Dr.\nSchmidt nonetheless opened the door for patients to undergo this\nmajor medical procedure.\n\n                                     -87-\n\fabout what constitutes a real-life experience.\"        This is not\n\naccurate.\n\n            The court based its determination, back in Kosilek I, on\n\nthe testimony of Dr. Marshall Forstein and Dr. George Brown, who\n\n\"convincingly testified [that] Kosilek's 'real life' is prison.\"\n\nKosilek v.

Evidence before the\n\ncourt in Kosilek II included an expert report from Dr. Forstein,\n\nand testimony from Dr. Randi Kaufman, both of whom indicated that\n\nKosilek had undergone a real-life experience in prison.   There was\n\nalso the February 24, 2005 report from the Fenway doctors, Dr.\n\nKevin Kapila and Dr. Kaufman, which explained that Kosilek had\n\nmoved successfully through the steps outlined by the Standards of\n\nCare.    Then, in their October 7, 2005 report, the Fenway doctors\n\nexplained at length why Cynthia Osborne's review subtly distorted\n\nthe concept of the real-life experience, and why Kosilek had\n\ncompleted the real-life test -- a test made even more stringent by\n\nthe fact that she was living as a female in an all-male prison.\n\nDr. Brown echoed a similar sentiment.     He testified that Kosilek\n\nhad not only met the minimum real-life experience but had exceeded\n\nit.     Dr. Brown focused on the significant amount of information\n\n\n                                -88-\n\fthat existed regarding Kosilek's time in prison, a record that his\n\npatients in the outside world would never have.27\n\n          The record is clear.      The district court's determination\n\nthat Dr. Schmidt's viewpoint about the feasibility of a real-life\n\nexperience in prison was not based on the judge's own lay opinion.\n\nIt was, as the district court alluded to, grounded in a significant\n\namount of evidence offered by competent medical professionals, all\n\nof whom disagreed with Dr. Schmidt.28\n\n          The same can be said about what course of treatment was\n\nappropriate for Kosilek.        Dr. Schmidt testified that Kosilek had\n\n\"made an excellent adaptation\" on her current treatment regimen and\n\nthat   surgery    would   not    \"confer   any   additional   functional\n\ncapability.\"     Surgery was not, according to Dr. Schmidt, medically\n\nnecessary for Kosilek.      To minimize the risk of future harm to\n\n\n27\n   The majority mentions that none of the experts who opined that\nKosilek completed a real-life experience considered that she might\nbe housed in a female facility post-surgery.       This is hardly\nsurprising as this is a theory of my colleagues' own making. The\nDOC never made any argument that a potential post-surgery housing\nchange rendered Kosilek unable to complete the real-life\nexperience, nor did any provider opine that it was even a\nconsideration.\n28\n   The Seventh Version of the Standards of Care came out in 2011.\nNotably it contains a new section devoted to scenarios where\npersons with gender identity disorder are living in institutional\nenvironments such as prisons or long-term care facilities.\nStandards of Care, Version 7, at 67.      It provides that those\nindividuals' health care \"should mirror that which would be\navailable to them if they were living in a non-institutional\nsetting\" and that \"[a]ll elements of assessment and treatment as\ndescribed in the [Standards of Care] can be provided to people\nliving in institutions.\" Id.\n\n                                    -89-\n\fKosilek, Dr. Schmidt thought employing psychotherapy and medication\n\nto reduce her dysphoria and, if needed, placing Kosilek in a\n\nmedical facility would be effective.       A majority of the testifying\n\nmedical providers said otherwise though.         When asked what they\n\nthought   about   Dr.   Schmidt's   suggested   regimen,   Drs.    Kapila,\n\nKaufman, Appelbaum, and Forstein all thought it unreasonable.29 The\n\ncommon thinking was that Dr. Schmidt's approach was not likely to\n\neffectively reduce Kosilek's risk of self harm, given that the\n\nsource of her dysphoria was her male genitalia.\n\n           In the Eighth Amendment context, the adequacy of medical\n\ncare is \"measured against 'prudent professional standards.'\" Nunes\n\nv. Mass. Dept. of Corr., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">766</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">136</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 142 (1st Cir. 2014) (quoting\n\nDeCologero, 821 F.2d at 43).        The district court here concluded\n\nthat Dr. Schmidt was not a prudent professional.       Given the above,\n\nI am not convinced that this determination was clearly erroneous.\n\nDr.   Schmidt's    significant   disagreement   with   widely     accepted\n\nguidelines and the sharp contrast between his and the other well-\n\ncredentialed providers' opinions, offer strong support for the\n\ncourt's finding.\n\n\n29\n   Court-appointed expert, Dr. Stephen Levine, ultimately testified\nthat from a purely medical perspective (absent considerations\nrelative to the prison environment), a prudent professional would\nnot deny Kosilek sex reassignment surgery. However, Dr. Levine\ninitially opined that Dr. Schmidt's view was reasonable (if not\npopular), a discrepancy that apparently arose from Dr. Levine\ndisregarding the district court's order to treat Kosilek as a\npatient in free society. Considering this incongruity, I do not\nlist Dr. Levine as one of Dr. Schmidt's critics.\n\n                                    -90-\n\f                    B. Adequacy of the DOC's Treatment\n\n             In light of the court's determination as to Dr. Schmidt's\n\nprudence, the question remains whether the evidence supported its\n\nconclusion that the DOC's treatment was not medically adequate.\n\nThe majority's consideration of this issue begins with a faulty\n\npremise.       It    states   that     the    \"district    court       held   that\n\npsychotherapy and antidepressants alone would not adequately treat\n\nKoslilek's    GID,\"    a   finding    the    majority   calls     an    incorrect\n\ncharacterization of the issues, and a minimization of the DOC's\n\nproffered treatment plan.          It is the majority who is wrong.\n\n             The district court was of course well aware that the DOC\n\nwas suggesting a more comprehensive treatment plan beyond therapy\n\nand medication.      Nonetheless, as it repeatedly explained, it found\n\nthat   all   treatment     other    than     sex   reassignment    surgery     was\n\ninadequate for Kosilek.        See, e.g., Kosilek, 889 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n202, 233, 236, 238, 240.       This included the DOC's past treatment,\n\nas well as its intended treatment going forward.             In other words,\n\nthe court did not minimize the DOC's regimen.                     Based on the\n\ntestimony and evidence presented, it simply found the regimen did\n\nnot, and would not going forward, adequately treat Kosilek's gender\n\nidentity disorder.         This finding was well within the court's\n\npurview to make.      The fact that the DOC fashioned some treatment,\n\nin the form of hormone therapy, electrolysis, and access to\n\nfeminine items does not insulate it from liability. In De'Lonta v.\n\n\n                                      -91-\n\fJohnson, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals found that an inmate,\n\nwho sought sex reassignment surgery after her gender identity\n\ndisorder failed to resolve despite receiving hormones, stated a\n\nplausible deliberate indifference claim.           708 F.3d at 522, 525.\n\nThe   court    concluded   that,   though   the   Virginia   Department   of\n\nCorrections had provided the inmate with hormone therapy and\n\npsychological counseling consistent with the Standards of Care, \"it\n\ndoes not follow that they have necessarily provided her with\n\nconstitutionally adequate treatment.\" Id. at 522, 526 (emphasis in\n\noriginal).\n\n              The majority nonetheless would have us believe the care\n\nprovided by the DOC can withstand constitutional scrutiny.                It\n\nendeavors to convince by giving little weight to the attested to\n\nshortcomings in Kosilek's treatment plan, and instead focusing\n\nheavily on the improvement Kosilek has made since being provided\n\nhormones, electrolysis, feminine garb and gear, and mental health\n\ntreatment.     This is not in dispute; Kosilek has indeed progressed.\n\nHowever, despite the short shrift the majority pays it, there was\n\nample evidence supporting the district court's conclusion that this\n\nimprovement was not sufficient to ease Kosilek's suffering to a\n\npoint where she was no longer facing a life-threatening risk of\n\nharm.\n\n              Though the DOC has been treating Kosilek for many years,\n\nthe district court found that she \"continues to suffer intense\n\n\n                                    -92-\n\fmental anguish.\"       Kosilek, 889 F. Supp. 2d at 202.                The court\n\nchronicled     the    evidence:    Kosilek's      own   testimony      about   her\n\ncontinued distress,30 the Fenway Center report indicating Kosilek's\n\nongoing angst over her male genitalia and the high likelihood of\n\nanother suicide attempt, and the along-the-same-lines testimony of\n\nKosilek's treating psychologist, Mark Burrowes.                 See id. at 226.\n\nThere   was    also   Dr.    Kaufman's      testimony   that,   even    with   the\n\ntreatment the DOC provided, Kosilek still suffered from clinically\n\nsignificant distress and severe dysphoria, a fact she found \"quite\n\nnotable.\" Dr. Brown testified similarly, explaining that Kosilek's\n\ntreatment to date, including the hormones, had not obviated her\n\nneed for surgery.           Further, there was evidence that Kosilek's\n\nimprovement     was   tangled     up   in   her   continuing    hope    that   sex\n\nreassignment surgery would be provided.            Dr. Brown testified: \"And\n\nwithout that hope, the [DOC's] treatments are -- I wouldn't say for\n\nnaught, but they are not going to continue her level of improvement\n\nwhere she is now.\"\n\n              Thus, even with Kosilek's documented improvement, Drs.\n\nBrown, Kaufman, Forstein, Kapila, and Appelbaum all testified\n\nunequivocally that sex reassignment surgery was medically necessary\n\nand the only appropriate treatment for Kosilek.                   They further\n\n\n30\n   The court found Kosilek testified credibly that although hormone\ntreatments had helped, she was distressed by her male genitalia and\nbelieved   that   she   needed  surgery.      Antidepressants   and\npsychotherapy, according to Kosilek, would not alter the fact that\nshe did not want to continue living with her male genitalia.\n\n                                       -93-\n\fagreed that there was a serious risk of harm, most likely suicide,\n\nshould Kosilek not receive the surgery, which was a concern the\n\nFenway doctors voiced as early as 2005. As the majority says, this\n\npotentiality matters because the Eighth Amendment's protections\n\nextend beyond present suffering to future harm.     See Helling v.\n\nMcKinney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112888\"><a href=\"/opinion/112888/helling-v-mckinney/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 33-34 (1993); Leavitt, 645 F.3d at 501.\n\n          The DOC's assertion that this future risk could be curbed\n\nwith medication and psychotherapy cannot carry the day.     As the\n\ndistrict court found, treating the underlying disorder and its\n\nsymptoms are two very different things, a distinction also drawn by\n\nthe Seventh Circuit.   See Fields v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"222617\"><a href=\"/opinion/222617/fields-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">653</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">550</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir.\n\n2011).   In Fields, the court found a Wisconsin statute that\n\nprohibited the state's correctional department from providing\n\ntransgender inmates with hormones and sex reassignment surgery\n\nunconstitutional.   Id. at 552-53, 559.   The court, discussing how\n\nsome patients require hormone therapy, found the department of\n\ncorrections had not effectively rebutted the evidence that an\n\noffering of medication and psychotherapy would \"do nothing to treat\n\nthe underlying disorder.\" Id. at 556. In the instant matter, Drs.\n\nAppelbaum and Kapila testified that the preferred approach is to\n\ntreat the underlying problem -- Kosilek's gender identity disorder\n\n-- as opposed to the symptoms it might produce.      As chronicled\n\nabove, the consensus was that the only way to adequately treat that\n\nproblem was with sex reassignment surgery.\n\n\n                               -94-\n\f           Lest we forget, the procedural posture of this case bears\n\nanother mention. The DOC is challenging the district court's grant\n\nof injunctive relief following a bench trial, meaning that due\n\nregard is paid to the judge's factual findings and credibility\n\ndeterminations.   See Monahan, 625 F.3d at 46.    When the evidence\n\nyields competing inferences or two permissible views, we cannot\n\nsecond guess, \"even if, had we been sitting as triers of the facts,\n\nwe might have arrived at a different set of judgments.\"     N. Ins.\n\nCo. of N.Y. v. Point Judith Marina, LLC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203980\"><a href=\"/opinion/203980/northern-ins-co-of-ny-v-point-judith-marina/\"><span class=\"volume\">579</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 67 (1st Cir.\n\n2009).   Here the judge concluded that the DOC's present treatment\n\nregimen, with the added medication and therapy to cushion the post-\n\nsurgery-denial fallout, would not reduce Kosilek's suffering to the\n\npoint where she did not have a major medical need.      Rather, sex\n\nreassignment surgery was the only adequate treatment for Kosilek's\n\nlife-threatening disorder.   As detailed above, these findings were\n\nsupported by the un-objected to testimony of multiple eminently\n\nqualified doctors, by widely accepted, published standards, and by\n\nthe testimony of Kosilek herself.       The factfinder found this\n\nevidence convincing; he found the DOC's evidentiary offering less\n\nso.   It is not for us to re-weigh the evidence and second-guess\n\nthis determination, but that is exactly what the majority does.\n\n           What's more, by upholding the adequacy of the DOC's\n\ncourse of treatment, the majority in essence creates a de facto ban\n\non sex reassignment surgery for inmates in this circuit.        Its\n\n\n                                -95-\n\fattempt to repudiate this notion is not compelling.                    For instance,\n\nthe fact that the DOC has \"disclaimed any attempt to create a\n\nblanket policy regarding SRS\" is a non-starter.                   The issue is not\n\nwhether correctional departments will voluntarily provide the\n\nsurgery, it is whether the precedent set by this court today will\n\npreclude inmates from ever being able to mount a successful Eighth\n\nAmendment    claim    for   sex    reassignment         surgery   in    the   courts.\n\nEqually unconvincing is the majority's assertion that the \"unique\n\ncircumstances\" presented by Kosilek's case will prevent any de\n\nfacto ban.       The first so-called anomaly cited by the majority --\n\nthe divergence of opinion as to Kosilek's need for surgery -- only\n\nresulted from the DOC disregarding the advice of Kosilek's treating\n\ndoctors and bringing in a predictable opponent to sex reassignment\n\nsurgery.     It is no stretch to imagine another department of\n\ncorrections stealing a page from this play book, i.e., just bring\n\nin someone akin to Osborne.             It is hardly a matchless scenario.\n\nThe same goes for Kosilek's criminal history and post-surgical\n\nhousing options, which the majority also points to.                    Rare will be\n\nthe prisoner who does not pose some type of security concern, or\n\nharbor some potential for causing climate unrest.                  So the question\n\nremains,    if    Kosilek   --    who     was    time   and   again    diagnosed     as\n\nsuffering    from    severe      gender    identity     disorder,      and    who   was\n\nuniformly thought by qualified medical professionals to require\n\n\n\n\n                                          -96-\n\fsurgery -- is not an appropriate candidate for surgery, what inmate\n\nis?\n\n             In sum, the majority's conclusion that the district court\n\nwrongly found that Kosilek satisfied the objective component of the\n\nEighth Amendment inquiry is, in my opinion, flatly incorrect. I am\n\nno more convinced by the majority's examination of the subjective\n\ncomponent.\n\n                IV. Eighth Amendment: Subjective Prong\n\n             A satisfied subjective prong means that prison officials\n\nhad \"a sufficiently culpable state of mind\" in that they showed\n\ndeliberate indifference to an inmate's health and safety.     Farmer,\n\n511 U.S. at 834; Leavitt, 645 F.3d at 497.    The officials were both\n\n\"aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a\n\nsubstantial risk of serious harm exists\" and they drew that\n\ninference. Ruiz-Rosa v. Rullán, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202717\"><a href=\"/opinion/202717/ruiz-rosa-v-rivera-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">150</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 156 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\nThe majority posits that the DOC, because it was faced with\n\nconflicting medical opinions about what treatment was appropriate\n\nfor Kosilek, and because it proffered reasonable security concerns,\n\nwas not deliberately indifferent to Kosilek's risk for serious\n\nharm.   Both theories fail to convince.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -97-\n\f                 A. Conflicting Medical Opinions\n\n          The idea that incompatible medical opinions serve to\n\ninsulate the DOC from a deliberate indifference finding is a\n\nconcept not advanced by the DOC, which rests on several faulty\n\npropositions and has very problematic implications.\n\n          The majority concedes that the DOC never made this\n\nparticular argument, but charitably claims it is not waived because\n\n\"[t]he DOC's contention that the district court erred in deeming\n\nSRS medically necessary and in rejecting Dr. Schmidt's approach as\n\nimprudent necessarily entails the DOC's subjective belief that SRS\n\nwas unnecessary.\"31    This is a stretch.     An argument advanced on\n\nappeal years after surgery was denied is not the equivalent of the\n\nDOC's   subjective    belief   that   sex   reassignment   surgery   was\n\nunnecessary when it denied it.        Moreover, the mere existence of\n\ncontradictory medical opinions does not necessarily mean that the\n\nDOC did not deny Kosilek surgery for purely pretextual reasons. It\n\nis certainly conceivable that a correctional department could seize\n\non an opinion from a medical provider, whether or not it found it\n\ncompelling, as a means to justify denying treatment.\n\n\n\n\n31\n   When the DOC first informed the district court that it would not\nbe providing Kosilek with surgery (back in June 2005 under\nDennehy's watch), Dr. Schmidt had not even evaluated Kosilek let\nalone communicated his findings. At the time, the DOC was only\narmed with the report of Cynthia Osborne who had not met with\nKosilek but rather had simply peer reviewed the Fenway Report.\n\n                                  -98-\n\f             Another even more serious flaw in the majority's theory\n\nis that it is contradicted by the evidence.          Commissioner Dennehy\n\ntestified multiple times, and submitted a report to the same\n\neffect, that it was security concerns that motivated her decision\n\nto   deny    Kosilek   surgery.     During    Dennehy's   first    round   of\n\ntestimony, when she was still claiming ignorance about whether\n\nUMass     (the   DOC's   contracted     health-services     provider)      was\n\nrecommending surgery, she testified that based \"strictly [on]\n\nsafety and security concerns\" she would still veto the surgery even\n\nif UMass told her that it was medically necessary.                Then, once\n\nUMass's     position   that   surgery   was   medically   necessary   became\n\npellucid to Dennehy, she submitted a report to the court indicating\n\nthat she was standing firm in her decision to deny surgery based on\n\n\"alarming and substantial\" safety and security concerns. Her final\n\ntime on the stand, Dennehy testified that the only thing, in her\n\nview, preventing surgery for Kosilek was safety and security\n\nconcerns; absent such concerns, Dennehy would have no reason to\n\ninterfere with any medical order for treatment.\n\n             The evidence with regard to Commissioner Clarke's stance\n\non the issue was similar.         In his report to the court, Clarke\n\ndisclaimed any ability to render an opinion on the validity of the\n\nmedical opinions expressed at trial, and went on to explain his\n\nview that \"the safety and security concerns presented by the\n\nprospect of undertaking sex reassignment surgery for Michelle\n\n\n                                    -99-\n\fKosilek    are    insurmountable.\"          Clarke       then    hammered       home   his\n\nsecurity concerns on the stand.             Therefore, even though there was\n\ncontradictory opinions on whether surgery was medically necessary\n\nfor Kosilek, both Dennehy's and Clarke's decision to deny the\n\nprocedure was, as they put it, based solely on security concerns.\n\n               The majority's presumption that the existence of varying\n\nmedical       opinions    should    insulate       the     DOC      is    not   only   an\n\nunpreserved,      unsupported       argument      but    it     has      very   troubling\n\nimplications.          It gives correctional departments serious leeway\n\nwith the Eighth Amendment.                If they do not want to provide a\n\nprisoner with care recommended by one or more than one medical\n\nprovider, they need only find a doctor with a differing mind set\n\n(typically not a difficult task).               It is no stretch to think that\n\nmight    be     what    happened    here.         The    DOC     had     the    treatment\n\nrecommendation of Drs. Kaufman and Kapila, a local psychiatrist and\n\npsychologist who had evaluated Kosilek.                    The doctors themselves\n\nwere recommended by the DOC's own medical provider, UMass. Yet the\n\nDOC     took    the    unusual     step    of     having      the     Fenway     doctors'\n\nrecommendation peer reviewed by Cynthia Osborne, an out-of-state\n\nsocial worker with a known opinion about sex reassignment surgery.\n\nIt seems highly unlikely that the DOC was simply looking for a more\n\ncomplete picture of Kosilek's treatment options, and that Osborne's\n\npredictable opposition to Kosilek being provided with surgery was\n\na non-factor.          The DOC knew that Osborne was working with the\n\n\n                                          -100-\n\fVirginia and Wisconsin departments of corrections to help defend\n\nlawsuits filed by transgender prisoners, and internal DOC meeting\n\nminutes noted that Osborne \"may do more objective evaluations\" and\n\nwas \"[m]ore sympathetic to DOC position.\" Predictably, Osborne was\n\none-hundred percent sympathetic.\n\n                          B.

But it is also\n\ntrue that at some point a defendant forfeits the advantage of\n\ndeference,    for   instance   following   a   \"pattern   of   delays,   new\n\nobjections substituted for old ones, misinformation and other\n\nnegatives.\"32    Id.   The district court determined that the DOC had\n\ndone just this, causing undue delay in Kosilek's treatment regimen,\n\n\n32\n   The pattern in Battista -- a case in which a transgender inmate\nsued the Massachusetts DOC for failing to provide doctor-\nrecommended hormones -- included an initial failure to take the\ninmate's diagnosis and hormone request seriously, the years it took\nfor a solid security justification to be made, and the DOC's claim\nthat withholding hormones or placing the inmate in severely\nconstraining protective custody were the only two options.       In\nother words, there are some marked similarities between that case\nand this one. That is, apart from their outcomes. In Battista,\nthis court affirmed the district court's deliberate indifference\ndetermination.\n\n                                  -101-\n\fmanufacturing security concerns, and orchestrating a half-hearted\n\nsecurity review. The record amply supported these conclusions, yet\n\nthe majority too easily discounts them, especially given the\n\ndeferential look this issue warrants. See, e.g., Torraco, 923 F.2d\n\nat 234 (explaining that deliberate indifference is usually a jury\n\nquestion); Monahan, 625 F.3d at 46 (providing that due regard is\n\ngiven to credibility calls); Fed. Refinance Co., 352 F.3d at 27-28\n\n(noting    that   a    clear      error   look    makes   sense    when   there    are\n\nquestions of motive and intent).\n\n             Of course, it has been many years since medical providers\n\nbegan considering the propriety of surgery for Kosilek.                           Back\n\nduring Kosilek I, Dr. Forstein recommended that Kosilek be allowed\n\nto consult with a surgeon who specialized in sex reassignment\n\nsurgery.    Then in 2003, Dr. Seil said Kosilek should be allowed to\n\nmeet with a specialist after a year on hormones.                    But right when\n\nshe started as commissioner, Dennehy made a curious move.                          She\n\nreassessed the care being provided to all inmates suffering from\n\ngender identity disorder, despite the DOC's contract with UMass\n\nplacing that medical care squarely in UMass's purview.                    Then once\n\nthe Fenway doctors opined in 2005 that Kosilek should be allowed to\n\nhave   surgery,       the   DOC    frittered      away    time    claiming   not    to\n\nunderstand    that     UMass      recommended     surgery    for    Kosilek.       The\n\nmajority does not quibble with the court's finding that the DOC\n\nprevaricated in this respect because it \"does not undercut the\n\n\n                                          -102-\n\fconsistency    with   which    they    identified    safety    and   security\n\nconcerns.\"     This misses the point.          To establish a subjective\n\nintent, \"it is enough for the prisoner to show a wanton disregard\n\nsufficiently evidenced 'by denial, delay, or interference with\n\nprescribed health care.'\"        Battista, 645 F.3d at 453 (quoting\n\nDesRosiers, 949 F.2d at 19); see also Johnson v. Wright, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790697\"><a href=\"/opinion/790697/james-johnson-v-lester-wright-assoc-commissioner-health-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 404 (2d Cir. 2005) (A \"deliberate indifference claim can lie\n\nwhere   prison     officials     deliberately       ignore     the    medical\n\nrecommendations of a prisoner's treating physicians.\").              That is\n\nprecisely what the district court found happened here, and the\n\nevidentiary support for this determination is in the record.\n\n             The same goes for the court's conclusion that the DOC's\n\nsecurity reviews were rushed and results-driven.              Dennehy told a\n\nnews outlet that the DOC would deny Kosilek's request for surgery\n\ndespite only having \"generalized discussions\" and phone calls with\n\nthe relevant players; she had not yet received written reports or\n\nconvened a formal security meeting.           When the DOC did meet, there\n\nwas just a week left before its court-ordered security report was\n\ndue -- a report that was then penned predominantly by trial counsel\n\nand reviewed by Dennehy only a day or two before its filing.            Once\n\ntrial was underway, the hurriedness continued.           A mere nine days\n\nbefore expert disclosures were due, Dennehy contacted the director\n\nof the Federal Bureau of Prisons looking for a security expert.\n\nAnd the experts the DOC ultimately did present at trial seemed ill\n\n\n                                      -103-\n\fprepared, failing to take into account important details about\n\nKosilek's medical and disciplinary history.\n\n          For the district court, another reason not to esteem the\n\nDOC's proffered security concerns was the fact that they were\n\n\"largely false\" and \"greatly exaggerated.\"             This finding is not\n\nclearly erroneous.    Yet the majority easily dismisses it, in part\n\nby limiting its focus to what it presumably perceives as the DOC's\n\nmore valid security concerns -- where to house Kosilek post-\n\noperatively and the deterrence of false suicide threats by inmates.\n\nThe majority is conveniently forgetting the throw-it-up-and-see-\n\nwhat-sticks approach taken by the DOC below. It was this approach,\n\nin part, that led the court to question whether the DOC could be\n\ntrusted to give an accurate picture of security concerns consequent\n\nto surgery.\n\n          For    instance,     the   DOC        repeatedly      claimed   that\n\ntransporting    Kosilek   to   surgery    out    of   state    would   pose   an\n\ninsurmountable security risk. It is hardly surprising the district\n\ncourt thought this was an embellished concern.                Kosilek had been\n\ntransported to multiple doctor's appointments without issue, and it\n\nis illogical to think Kosilek would attempt to flee en route to the\n\nsurgery she has dedicated decades of her life to obtaining.               Also\n\neminently unlikely is that during the transport home from highly\n\ninvasive surgery, a sixty-five-year-old, recovering Kosilek would\n\nbe able to escape the grasp of DOC personnel.           Even Clarke thought\n\n\n                                  -104-\n\fit near certain that Kosilek could safely be transported to and\n\nfrom surgery.\n\n          With regard to housing Kosilek in a female prison, the\n\nDOC painted Kosilek as a highly-polarizing escape risk who could\n\nnot possibly safely reside in MCI-Framingham's general population.\n\nIt pointed to the comparatively weaker perimeter of MCI-Framingham,\n\nalleging that Kosilek's superior male strength and life sentence\n\nmade her a flight risk.   One can easily see why the district court\n\nwas not buying this.      Kosilek was advanced in age, physically\n\nslight, had taken female hormones for years, and had an excellent\n\ndisciplinary    record.   And   MCI-Framingham   successfully    housed\n\napproximately forty life offenders.     The court also had reason to\n\nbe skeptical of the DOC's adamant contention that Kosilek would\n\ncause inmate climate issues at MCI-Framingham due to the fact that\n\nshe murdered her wife.     Undoubtedly inmates find other inmates\n\noffensive for a plethora of reasons, such as, race, religion, gang\n\naffiliation, sexual orientation, or the crime committed.        Prisons\n\ndeal with these situations on a routine basis and the evidence\n\nestablished that MCI-Framingham had procedures in place to do just\n\nthat.\n\n          The DOC even admitted at oral argument that had a post-\n\noperative, transgender person out in free society committed murder,\n\nthe DOC would have to figure out where to house that person.       The\n\nDOC; however, did not think this a particularly important point,\n\n\n                                -105-\n\fprotesting that Kosilek presents unique concerns that separate her\n\nfrom this hypothetical inmate.         I am unmoved.       The fact that\n\nKosilek's crime was one of violence against a woman could equally\n\napply to another potential inmate.           And the fact that Kosilek\n\ngained notoriety by litigating against the DOC all these years          --\n\nin other words, successfully pursuing her constitutional right to\n\nadequate medical care -- hardly seems a compelling consideration.\n\n           For the district court, also blunting the DOC's fervent\n\ncries of overwhelming security concerns were the alternatives to\n\nplacing Kosilek in the general population of a Massachusetts\n\nprison. There was the option of transferring Kosilek to an out-of-\n\nstate prison (though this scenario appears to have been left\n\nlargely unexplored by the DOC).     In fact, the evidence established\n\nthat   Clarke's   former   employer,   the    Washington   Department   of\n\nCorrections, housed a post-operative female transgender inmate,\n\nalso serving a life sentence for murdering a female relative,\n\nwithout security or climate issues.          The inmate's housing was so\n\nunremarkable that Clarke was not even aware of it during his tenure\n\nin Washington.    Further, there was evidence that Kosilek's safety\n\ncould be ensured by placing her in a segregated housing unit.\n\n           The DOC's past conduct was also relevant to the district\n\ncourt's credibility assessment. In connection with Kosilek I, then\n\nCommissioner Michael Maloney hammered the serious security concerns\n\nsurrounding   Kosilek   remaining   at   MCI-Norfolk    while   receiving\n\n\n                                 -106-\n\fhormones, theorizing that an inmate living as a female (with female\n\nattributes) among sex offenders would create a risk of violence.\n\nHowever, once the DOC actually stopped to conduct a security\n\nreview, it determined there were no current security concerns with\n\nKosilek being provided estrogen therapy. Indeed no security issues\n\never arose. Kosilek has been safely housed at MCI-Norfolk for many\n\nyears presenting herself as female.        The DOC's reversal on this\n\nissue calls into question its stance before this court about the\n\nnon-feasibility of housing a post-surgical Kosilek at MCI-Norfolk.\n\n          The DOC also expressed concern that providing Kosilek\n\nwith surgery would encourage inmates to utilize suicide threats to\n\nreceive a desired benefit, and the majority deems this concern\n\nreasonable.     I am not convinced, and neither was the district\n\ncourt.   Not only is there absolutely no evidence that Kosilek is\n\ntrying to game the system, but the DOC, as it emphasized at trial,\n\nemploys mental health professionals and has policies in place to\n\ndeal with suicidality.    Presumably, these tools can be used by the\n\nDOC to assess whether an inmate's particular suicide threat is\n\nmanufactured or real, and it can be dealt with accordingly.         That\n\nthe DOC does not want to be inundated with a hypothetical influx of\n\nfalse suicide threats hardly seems a valid reason to deny a\n\nprisoner care deemed medically necessary.\n\n          For    the   district   court,   the   public   and   political\n\ndisapproval of Kosilek's surgical pursuit was another factor.         It\n\n\n                                  -107-\n\fdid not believe Dennehy's and Clarke's claims that the avoidance of\n\ncontroversy played no role in the DOC's decision to deny surgery.\n\nThe majority concedes that it must give deference to the court's\n\nfinding that Dennehy's motivations were colored by public pressure\n\nand so, instead, the majority hypes up the role of Commissioner\n\nClarke by characterizing him as the ultimate decision maker. I see\n\na few flaws with the majority's reasoning.\n\n            For one, the majority says the district court improperly\n\nimputed    Dennehy's      motivations     to    Clarke,    thus   ignoring    the\n\ninjunctive-relief requirement that it take into account the DOC's\n\nthen present-day stance.33          See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 845 (quoting\n\nHelling,    509    U.S.    at     36)   (The    court    considers     deliberate\n\nindifference      \"'in    light    of   the     prison    authorities'    current\n\nattitudes and conduct,' . . . their attitudes and conduct at the\n\ntime suit is brought and persisting thereafter.\").                   The majority\n\nhas it wrong.     The court took testimony from Clarke, reviewed his\n\nwritten report, and spoke extensively in its decision about why it\n\nwas not convinced that Clarke denied Kosilek surgery based on\n\n\n33\n   While a defendant's attitudes and conduct at the time a decision\nis rendered are relevant, what motivates the DOC today is not.\nThis fact may be less than clear given the majority's reference to\nthe DOC's present stance (\"proof that the DOC remains motivated by\npretextual or improper concerns\") and the fact that Dennehy is now\nseven years removed from the decision-making process. To be clear,\nwe are reviewing the district court's decision that the DOC,\nthrough Dennehy and Clarke, denied Kosilek surgery based on\npretextual reasons.     Indeed it would be an amazing feat of\nprescience for the district court to anticipate what the DOC's\nviewpoint would be two years after penning its decision.\n\n                                        -108-\n\flegitimate penological concerns.                   Of note, it was Kosilek who\n\nsought to have Clarke inform the court of his position, and the\n\nDOC, which stipulated at trial that Dennehy was the operative\n\ndecision maker, actually objected to Clarke even testifying as he\n\nwas simply \"maintain[ing] the position set forth by the DOC through\n\nformer Commissioner Dennehy.\"\n\n              Furthermore, though the majority defers to the court's\n\ntake on Dennehy, it refuses to do so for Clarke, claiming that\n\n\"Clarke was never found by the court to be non-credible.\"                        This is\n\nnot   entirely       accurate.         Clearly     the    import    of    the   court's\n\nconclusion that Clarke's articulated security concerns were either\n\nfalse or exaggerated as a pretext to deny surgery means that the\n\ncourt did not think Clarke a completely credible witness.                            See\n\nKosilek,   889    F.    Supp.     2d    at   241    (\"[T]he   purported         security\n\nconsiderations       that   Dennehy      and     Clarke    claim    motivated      their\n\ndecisions to deny Kosilek sex reassignment surgery are largely\n\nfalse   and    any     possible       genuine      concerns   have       been    greatly\n\nexaggerated     to    provide     a    pretext     for    denying    the   prescribed\n\ntreatment.\")     In fact, the court specifically found certain claims\n\nmade by Clarke not to be credible.                 See id. at 244 (finding that\n\n\"neither Dennehy nor Clarke has provided a credible explanation for\n\ntheir purported belief that if Kosilek's genitalia are altered the\n\nrisk to him and others at MCI Norfolk will be materially magnified\"\n\nand \"[t]he claims of Dennehy and Clarke that they have denied sex\n\n\n                                         -109-\n\freassignment surgery for Kosilek in part because MCI Framingham is\n\nnot sufficiently secure to prevent an escape by Kosilek, who has\n\nnever attempted to flee, are not credible.\")          Therefore, as it did\n\nwith Dennehy, the majority should be giving due regard to the\n\ncourt's conclusion that Clarke was not believable.\n\n              The majority also misses the mark with its contention\n\nthat the \"only evidence\" tending to show Clarke may have considered\n\npublic and political criticism were the two letters from the\n\nunhappy Massachusetts legislators.           This is not the whole picture.\n\nIn addition to the letters, what convinced the court that Clarke\n\nwas   improperly    motivated    was   his    advancing   inflated     security\n\nconcerns following a hasty review, suggesting that he did not\n\noperate with an open mind.        Having already detailed the evidence\n\nsupporting the court's distrust of the DOC's proffered security\n\nconcerns, I will not rehash.\n\n              As for the thoroughness of Clarke's review, the court\n\ncriticized Clarke for not consulting with Luis Spencer, who was\n\nSuperintendent of MCI-Norfolk at the time, and for not reviewing\n\nthe   DOC's    security-expert   trial   testimony,       prior   to   deciding\n\nwhether to deny surgery. The DOC counters that Clarke, pursuant to\n\nthe court's order, was not required to do either of those things.\n\nIt is both conceivable that Clarke's review was too cursory, or\n\nthat he felt constrained by the court's order, though the fact that\n\nClarke did not know significant details such as Kosilek's age and\n\n\n                                   -110-\n\fexcellent   disciplinary   record   favors    the    former   possibility.\n\nEither way, both views are permissible, which means that the\n\ndistrict court's choice of one of them cannot be clearly erroneous.\n\nSee Monahan, 625 F.3d at 46.        Nor is it appropriate for us to\n\nsecond-guess    the   court's   tenable      perception       of   Clarke's\n\nmotivations, as deference extends to \"inferences drawn from the\n\nunderlying facts, and if the trial court's reading of the record\n\n[with respect to an actor's motivation] is plausible, appellate\n\nreview is at an end.\"       Janeiro, 457 F.3d at 138-39 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted) (alteration in original).\n\n            Ultimately, there was adequate evidentiary support for\n\nthe   court's   determination   that    the    DOC     was    deliberately\n\nindifferent. The court did not obviously err in concluding the DOC\n\ndelayed implementing medical treatment recommended by its own\n\nproviders, sought out a more favorable medical opinion, engaged in\n\na hasty, result-driven security review, offered a host of poorly\n\nthought out security concerns, and then denied surgery based not on\n\nany legitimate penological concerns but on a fear of controversy.\n\nWhether I, or any of my colleagues, would have drawn these same\n\nconclusions had we been presiding over this trial is irrelevant;\n\nour review is circumscribed.    It is enough that the district court\n\nhad a reasonable basis for its judgment.            The district court's\n\ndetermination that the Eighth Amendment's subjective prong was\n\nsatisfied should stand.\n\n\n                                -111-\n\f                                 V. Conclusion\n\n             I am confident that I would not need to pen this dissent,\n\nover   twenty    years   after   Kosilek's    quest   for   constitutionally\n\nadequate medical care began, were she not seeking a treatment that\n\nmany see as strange or immoral.               Prejudice and fear of the\n\nunfamiliar      have   undoubtedly   played   a   role   in   this   matter's\n\nprotraction. Whether today's decision brings this case to a close,\n\nI cannot say.

And we begin our review knowing that Kosilek\n\ndoes indeed have a serious medical need, and the prison's own\n\ndoctors, as well as the specialists retained by those doctors,\n\ninformed DOC that treatment of Kosilek's medical condition in\n\naccordance     with   prudent   professional    standards      requires   sex\n\nreassignment    surgery   (SRS).34      That   leaves   only    two   factual\n\nquestions:    (1) Are the DOC's doctors correct that SRS is the only\n\ntreatment for Kosilek's condition that is commensurate with modern\n\nmedical science as practiced by prudent professionals;35 and, if so,\n\n(2) Did prison officials nevertheless deny that treatment not\n\nbecause they disbelieved their own doctors, and not because of\n\nprison security considerations, but rather simply because they\n\nfeared public ridicule.         If the answer to each of these two\n\nquestions is \"yes,\" Kosilek should win.         Otherwise, she loses.\n\n             Were I the trial judge charged with answering these two\n\nfactual questions based solely on the written record, I would\n\nlikely find against Kosilek on the first question for the reasons\n\nstated by the trial court's appointed independent expert, Dr.\n\nLevine.   In a nutshell, Dr. Levine, who participated in drafting\n\n\n34\n   None of these witnesses face challenge on the grounds that their\nopinions are outside the bounds of accepted science.

But I am not the trial judge in this case.            Nor are my\n\ncolleagues.     And that is the rub.\n\n             The experienced jurist who was the trial judge in this\n\ncase, and who actually sat and listened to the live testimony,\n\nfound as a matter of fact that:\n\n             (1) Commensurate with modern medical science, no prudent\n\nprofessional would recommend any treatment for Kosilek other than\n\nSRS; and\n\n             (2) Prison officials nevertheless denied the treatment\n\nnot because they rejected the accuracy of the medical advice\n\ntendered by their own doctors, and not because of security issues,\n\nbut rather because they feared public ridicule.           Their reasons for\n\ndenying the necessary treatment were thus in bad faith.\n\n             The majority never explains why these two findings are\n\nnot pure findings of fact, and are not therefore subject solely to\n\nreview for clear error.         Nor can it.    After all, we are talking\n\nabout, first, what the medical--not legal--standard of care is for\n\na particular affliction, and second, whether Dennehy and Clarke\n\nwere truthful in describing their security objections, such as\n\ntheir claim that they feared that Kosilek, after trying to get this\n\n\n                                    -115-\n\fsurgery for twenty years, would escape on the way to the operating\n\nroom or, fresh from the surgeon's knife, overpower her guards and\n\nrun away.   Let me be plain on this point:            Until today, there was\n\nabsolutely no precedent (and the majority cites none) for reviewing\n\nsuch quintessentially factual findings under anything other than\n\nthe clear error test.\n\n            As    Judge   Thompson       carefully    explains,   there   is   a\n\nconsiderable amount of evidence that directly supports the trial\n\ncourt's findings on these two points, depending on which witnesses\n\none believes.     I write separately only to stress that even if one\n\nagrees with the majority that the district court got the fact-\n\nfinding wrong, we should defer unless the result is clearly\n\nerroneous. Of course, deferring to the trial judge's fact-finding\n\nhappens to produce a result in this case that some of us find\n\nsurprising,      and   much   of   the    public     likely   finds   shocking.\n\nScientific knowledge advances quickly and without regard to settled\n\nnorms and arrangements. It sometimes draws in its wake a reluctant\n\ncommunity, unnerved by notions that challenge our views of who we\n\nare and how we fit in the universe.             The notion that hard-wired\n\naspects of gender may not unerringly and inexorably correspond to\n\nphysical anatomy is especially unnerving for many.\n\n            The solution, I think, is to trust our trial judges to\n\nresolve these factual issues when the evidence supports a finding\n\neither way.      Some will get it wrong; most will get it right.           The\n\n\n                                     -116-\n\farc of decision-making, over time, will bend towards the latter.\n\nFor each instance of error in fact-finding, such as possibly this\n\ncase itself, $25,000 or so may be lost.        But doctors and lawyers\n\nwill refine their presentations and other trial judges will make\n\ntheir own findings, not bound in any way by the fact-finding in\n\nthis case.\n\n             Instead, by deciding the facts in this case as an\n\nappellate court essentially finding law, the majority ends any\n\nsearch for the truth through continued examination of the medical\n\nevidence by the trial courts.     It locks in an answer that binds all\n\ntrial courts in the circuit:      no prison may be required to provide\n\nSRS to a prisoner who suffers from gender dysphoria as long as a\n\nprison   official   calls    up    Ms.    Osborne   or   Dr.   Schmidt.36\n\nAcknowledging that the majority may well be correct on the facts,\n\nI nevertheless decline the invitation to join the majority in\n\nembracing the authority to decide the facts.        I suspect that our\n\ncourt will devote some effort in the coming years to distinguishing\n\nthis case, and eventually reducing it to a one-off reserved only\n\nfor transgender prisoners.\n\n\n\n\n36\n    No prisoner is likely to have a more favorable record than\nKosilek.\n\n                                  -117-\n\f</pre>",
