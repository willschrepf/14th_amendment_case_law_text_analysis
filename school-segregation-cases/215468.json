Reg. 58, 631\n\n(2002), issued by the Department of the Interior (“DOI” or “the Department”), which declined to\n\ngrant federal recognition to the Muwekma as a Native American tribe under the acknowledgment\n\ncriteria of 25 C.F.R. § 83 (2006) (“Part 83”). Complaint (“Compl.”) ¶ 1. Currently before the\n\nCourt are the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment. After careful consideration of the\n\nparties’ submissions and all documents and exhibits presented with those filings, 2 the Court\n\n\n1\n  The plaintiff named the following individuals as defendants in its original complaint: (1) Gale Norton, in her\nofficial capacity as the Secretary of the Interior (“Secretary”); (2) Aurene Martin, in her capacity as the Acting\nAssistant Secretary for Indian Affairs; and (3) the Department of the Interior (collectively “the defendants” or “the\nDepartment”). Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d)(1), the Court has substituted the current Secretary of\nthe Interior, Ken Salazar, for the former Secretary, Gale Norton. Similarly, the Court has also substituted Larry\nEcho Hawk, the current Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, in place of former Assistant Secretary Aurene Martin.\n2\n There have been two rounds of summary judgment briefing in this case. The first set of summary judgment\nmotions filed in this case commenced on July 13, 2005. The Court denied those motions without prejudice and\n                                                                                                  (continued . . .)\n\fconcludes for the following reasons that it must deny the plaintiff’s motion for summary\n\njudgment and grant the defendants’ cross-motion for summary judgment.\n\n                                                 I. Background\n\nA.       Regulatory Framework\n\n         “The question of whether a Native American Group constitutes an Indian tribe is one of\n\nimmense significance in federal Indian law.” H.R. Rep. 103-781, P.L. 103-454, Federally\n\nRecognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994, 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3768, 1994 WL 542741. This is\n\nbecause federal recognition of a Native American group as a tribe “is a prerequisite to the\n\n\n(. . . continued)\nremanded the case to the Department for the purpose of having the agency explain why it “require[d the] Muwekma\nto proceed through the . . . tribal acknowledgment procedures while allowing other tribes that appear to be similarly\nsituated to bypass the procedures altogether.” Muwekma Ohlone Tribe v. Kempthorne, 425 F. Supp. 2d 105, 125\n(D.D.C. 2006) (Walton, J.). After the Department supplemented the agency record with regard to the waiver issue, a\nsecond round of summary judgment briefing commenced on February 16, 2007. In these second summary judgment\nbriefs, the parties focused on the question to be answered on remand by the Department, but they also renewed their\nother arguments on the remaining claims. See Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Plaintiff’s\nMotion for Summary Judgment at 36 (reasserting all grounds for summary judgment raised in its initial\nmemorandum in support of motion for summary judgment); Memorandum in Support of Defendants’ Cross-Motion\nfor Summary Judgment and Response in Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment at 25 (recounting\narguments raised in its initial cross-motion for summary judgment). The Court, therefore, will consider the\narguments presented in both the first and second round of summary judgment briefing in assessing the merits of the\nplaintiff’s claims under the APA and the Constitution.\n\nAccordingly, the Court considered the following submissions in reaching its decision: (1) the plaintiff’s Complaint\n(“Compl.”); (2) the defendants’ Answer; (3) the Points and Authorities in Support of Plaintiff’s Motion for\nSummary Judgment (“Pl.’s First SJ Mem.”); (4) the defendants’ first Memorandum in Support of Defendants’\nCross-Motion for Summary Judgment and Response in Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment\n(“Defs.’ First SJ Mem.”); (5) the Reply Brief in Support of Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment and Opposing\nDefendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment (“Pl.’s First SJ Opp’n”); (6) the Reply Memorandum in Support of\nDefendants’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (“Defs.’ First SJ Reply”); (7) the Plaintiff’s Notice of\nSupplemental Authority (“Pl.’s Supp. Not.”); (8) the Defendants’ Response to Plaintiff’s Filing of Supplemental\nAuthority (“Defs.’ Resp. to Supp. Not.”); (9) the Plaintiff’s Second Notice of Supplemental Authority (“Pl.’s Second\nSupp. Not.”); (10) the Defendants’ Response to Plaintiff’s Second Notice of Supplemental Authority (“Defs.’ Resp.\nto Second Supp. Not.”); (11) the Plaintiff’s Reply in Support of Second Notice of Supplemental Authority (“Pl.’s\nReply to Second Resp.”); (12) the Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Plaintiff’s Motion for\nSummary Judgment (“Pl.’s Second SJ Mem.”); (13) the Defendants’ second Memorandum in Support of\nDefendants’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment and Response in Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary\nJudgment (“Defs.’ Second SJ Mem.”); (14) the Reply Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of\nPlaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment and in Opposition to Defendants’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment\n(“Pl.’s Second SJ Opp’n”); (15) the Defendants’ Reply in Support of Defendants’ Cross-Motion for Summary\nJudgment (“Defs.’ Second SJ Reply”); (16) the Defendants’ Supplemental Memoranda (“Defs.’ Supp. Mem.”); and\n(17) the Plaintiff’s Opposition to Defendants’ Supplemental Memorandum on Issues Set Forth in the Court’s\nSeptember 30, 2008 Order (“Defs.’ Supp. Opp’n”).\n\n\n\n                                                         2\n\fprotection, services, and benefits” provided by the Federal government to Indian tribes, as well\n\nas the “immunities and privileges available to other federally acknowledged Indian tribes by\n\nvirtue of their government-to-government relationship with the United States.” 25 C.F.R. § 83.2.\n\nPursuant to statutorily delegated authority, the Department is empowered with the authority to\n\ndetermine which currently unrecognized Native American groups meet the criteria for federal\n\nrecognition. 25 U.S.C. §§ 2, 9 (2006); see also James v. HHS, 824 F.2d 1132, 1137 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1987) (stating that “Congress has specifically authorized the Executive Branch to prescribe\n\nregulations concerning Indian affairs and relations. The purpose of the regulatory scheme is to . .\n\n. determine which Indian groups exist as tribes” (citations omitted)).\n\n        In 1978, the Department promulgated regulations that formally addressed the tribal\n\nrecognition process, 43 Fed. Reg. 39, 361 (Sept. 5, 1978) (codified at 25 C.F.R. § 54 et seq.)\n\n(recodified at 25 C.F.R. § 83 et seq.), and it later revised these regulations in 1994, Muwekma\n\nOhlone Tribe v. Kempthorne, 452 F. Supp. 2d 105, 108 (D.D.C. 2006) (Walton, J.). Under these\n\nregulations, there are three avenues available to an Indian entity seeking recognition as a tribe by\n\nthe federal government. The principal means for an American Indian entity to be recognized as a\n\ntribe is under 25 C.F.R. § 83.7, which sets forth seven “mandatory criteria” for tribal recognition.\n\n25 C.F.R. § 83.7. The Part 83 criteria are the following:\n\n       (a) The petitioner has been identified as an American Indian entity on a substantially\n           continuous basis since 1900. . . .\n\n       (b) A predominant portion of the petitioning group comprises a distinct community and\n           has existed as a community from historical times until the present. . . .\n\n       (c) The petitioner has maintained political influence or authority over its members as an\n           autonomous entity from historical times until the present. . . .\n\n       (d) A copy of the group’s present governing document including its membership criteria.\n           ...\n\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f         (e) The petitioner’s membership consists of individuals who descend from a historical\n             Indian tribe or from historical Indian tribes which combined and functioned as a\n             single autonomous political entity. . . .\n\n         (f) The membership of the petitioning group is composed principally of persons who are\n             not members of any acknowledged North American Indian tribe. . . .\n\n         (g) Neither the petitioner nor its members are the subject of congressional legislation that\n             has expressly terminated or forbidden the [f]ederal relationship.\n\nId. The second means of attaining acknowledgment is through the “modified” Part 83 process,\n\nwhich is available to those entities that had been previously (but are not currently) acknowledged\n\nby the federal government as a Native American tribe. 25 C.F.R. § 83.8(a). Under the modified\n\ncriteria, petitioning Native American entities that can provide substantial evidence of\n\n“[u]nambiguous previous [f]ederal acknowledgment,” id., need only provide the following\n\nshowing as to the first three Part 83 criteria: (1) that it had been identified as an American Indian\n\nentity on a substantially continuous basis “since the point of [its] last [f]ederal acknowledgment,”\n\n25 C.F.R. § 83.8(d)(1); (2) that “it comprises a distinct community at present,” 25 C.F.R. §\n\n83.8(d)(2); and (3) that “political influence or authority is exercised within the group . . . from\n\nthe point of [its] last [f]ederal acknowledgment to the present,” 25 C.F.R. § 83.8(d)(3). Finally,\n\nthe last option for federal acknowledgment available to a Native American group is to seek a\n\nwaiver of the Part 83 requirements, which the Secretary has the authority to grant if waiver of the\n\nrequirements would be \"in the best interests of the Indians.\" 3 25 C.F.R. § 1.2.\n\n         A petitioner, however, is not required to provide conclusive evidence under each of the\n\nPart 83 criteria; rather, a “criterion shall be considered met if the available evidence establishes a\n\nreasonable likelihood of the validity of the facts relating to that criterion.” Id. Furthermore, the\n\nDepartment, in evaluating a petition, is required to “take into account historical situations and\n\n3\n  As discussed below, there have been at least two recent instances in which the Secretary has waived the Part 83\nrequirements and granted federal acknowledgment to those entities. See infra at 17-18.\n\n\n\n                                                         4\n\ftime periods for which evidence is demonstrably limited or not available.” 25 C.F.R. § 83.6(e).\n\nAfter evaluating all of the evidence proffered by a petitioner, should the Department conclude\n\nthat the evidence “demonstrates that it does not meet one or more criteria,” or if “there is\n\ninsufficient evidence that it meets one or more of the criteria,” then the Agency \"may\" deny\n\nacknowledgment to a petitioner. 4 25 C.F.R. § 83.6(d).\n\nB.       History of the Verona Band and its Descendants\n\n         The Muwekma Ohlone Tribe is a group of American Indians “located in Northern\n\nCalifornia in the San Francisco Bay Area.” Compl. ¶ 5. The name “Ohlone” is an alternative to\n\n“Costanoan,” which was a label given to “[t]he Indians along the Pacific coast near San\n\nFrancisco Bay,” and “who were concentrated by the Spaniards before 1834 at the Mission San\n\nJose.” Pl.’s First SJ Mem., Exhibit (\"Ex.\") 7 (Proposed Finding) at 10. 5 The plaintiff asserts that\n\nits members descended from these Indians, id., although nine other Indian groups that submitted\n\npetitions to the Department also “use[d] the Ohlone or Costanoan tribal name,” which, according\n\nto the Department, suggests that “the Muwekma . . . does not have an uncontested claim to\n\nrepresent the descendants of all the Ohlone of the San Francisco Bay Area or all the territory of\n\nthe Costanoan-speaking peoples,” id. at 9.\n\n\n\n\n4\n  As discussed below, the Court ultimately concludes that the Muwekma failed to provide sufficient evidence to the\nDepartment that it “has been identified as an American Indian entity on a substantially continuous basis since” 1927,\nwhen the Verona band was last recognized by the federal government. 25 C.F.R. § 83.7(a); see also 25 C.F.R. §\n83.8(d)(1) (requiring petitioners with previous federal acknowledgment to demonstrate that “[t]he group meets the\nrequirements of . . . [Section] 83.7(a), except that such identification shall be demonstrated since the point of last\nFederal acknowledgment”). Because the Muwekma’s failure to meet the requirements of Section 83.7(a) was a\nsufficient basis for the Department to deny federal recognition to the group, see 25. C.F.R. § 83.6(d), the remainder\nof this background section, as well as the Court’s analysis of the Muwekma’s claims, will focus only on the facts\nrelevant to the Department’s Section 83.7(a) analysis.\n5\n  When providing a pincite for either the Department's Proposed Finding or Final Determination, the Court will\nutilize the administrative-record page number, rather than the number affixed by the Department in creating the\nreport.\n\n\n\n                                                          5\n\f       Nonetheless, the evidence in the administrative record does reflect that many of the\n\nMuwekma descended from Indians who resided near the Mission San Jose. Id. at 10.\n\nSpecifically, there were two settlements located “in the area north of [the] historical Mission San\n\nJose and east of San Francisco Bay, an area referred to today as the “‘East Bay.’” Id. “The most\n\nprominent of these settlements was located in a canyon just southwest of the town of Pleasanton,\n\nCalifornia, and near a railroad station named Verona.” Id.. The settlement came to be “known\n\nas the Alisal or Pleasanton rancheria, and its members were referred to by [United States] Indian\n\nagents as the Verona band.” Id. The “second settlement, known as El Molino, was located near\n\nthe town of Niles, which was within ten miles of Verona.” Id. These “two Indian settlements, or\n\nRancherias, . . . existed until the 1910[]s in Alameda County.” Id.\n\n       In 1906, the Department appointed C.E. Kelsey to conduct a census of landless Indians\n\nresiding on the Alisal and Niles settlements, id. at 67, in connection with the Act of June 21,\n\n1906, which, inter alia, appropriated funds for the purchase of land for Indians who were not\n\nthen residing on reservations, Compl. ¶ 14. Kelsey ultimately prepared a documented titled\n\n“Schedule [S]howing [N]on-[R]eservation Indians in Northern California,” which noted that\n\nthere were 29 individuals residing at the Pleasanton rancheria, and 14 individuals residing at the\n\nNiles Rancheria. Pl.’s First SJ Mem., Ex. 7 (Proposed Finding) at 67. In addition to the Kelsey\n\ncensus, the federal census conducted for Alameda County in 1910 “included a special Indian\n\npopulation schedule which enumerated 17 Indian residents of ‘Indian town,’ which appears to\n\nhave been the Pleasanton rancheria.” Id. at 10. According to the Department’s findings,\n\napproximately “48 percent of the [Muwekma’s] members descend directly from an Indian . . . on\n\neither the 1905-1906 Kelsey census of Pleasanton or Niles, or the 1910 Federal census of ‘Indian\n\ntown.’” Id. Within that 48 percent, “[a]bout 70 percent of the [Muwekma’s] members\n\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fdescend[ed] from an Indian woman, Avelina (Cornates) Marine . . . , who, according to\n\nrecollections of her son in the 1960[]s, may have been raised in the household of the chief of one\n\nof those Indian Rancherias before the 1880[]s.” Id. Furthermore, “[t]wo of Marine’s children\n\nwere listed on the 1910 census,” although “Marine’s other children . . . were not listed on [that]\n\ncensus.” Id. It is from those unlisted children from whom “[t]he majority of the [Muwekma’s]\n\nmembers descend.” Id. Accordingly, “[a]ll of the [Muwekma’s] members descend either from\n\nan Indian individual listed on the 1905-1906 Kelsey census,” an Indian individual listed on the\n\n1910 census, “or from an unlisted Marine sibling of an individual on these lists.” Id.\n\n       The Department acknowledges that the Verona band was previously recognized by the\n\nfederal government as an Indian tribe. Id. at 8. This prior recognition was based on evidence\n\nthat “[t]he band was among the groups . . . under the jurisdiction of the Indian agency at\n\nSacramento, California,” and that “[t]he agency dealt with the Verona [b]and as a group and\n\nidentified it as a distinct social and political entity.” Pl.’s First SJ Mem., Ex. 47 (May 24, 1996\n\nLetter from Department of Interior to Rosemary Cambra) at 1. Specifically, the Department\n\nfound that in 1914, an agent of the Office of the Indian Affairs, C.H. Asbury, mentioned a\n\n“Verona band in Alameda County” as a “potential beneficiary of the” land-purchase program\n\ncreated by the Act of June 21, 1906. Pl.’s First SJ Mem., Ex. 7 (Proposed Finding) at 12. The\n\nSacramento Agency also mentioned the possibility of purchasing land for the Verona band in\n\n1923. Id. According to the Department, “[h]owever, no land was purchased for the group[,] and\n\nno negotiations to buy land on its behalf are known to have taken place.” Id. And, “[i]n 1927,\n\nSuperintendent L.A. Dorrington referred to the [Verona] band but concluded that land should not\n\nbe purchased on its behalf.” Id. Despite these references to the Verona band, the Department\n\nasserts that it is not aware of any “census of the members of the Verona band during the years\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fbetween 1914 and 1927.” Id. Nonetheless, the Department acknowledges that the Verona band\n\nhad been previously recognized by the federal government from Asbury’s identification of the\n\nBand in 1914 to Dorrington’s recommendation that the government not purchase land for the\n\nBand in 1927, id. at 8, and that neither Congress nor any executive agency ever formally\n\nwithdrew federal recognition of this group, Answer at 14.\n\n       In early 1989, the Muwekma submitted to the Department a letter of intent to petition for\n\nfederal acknowledgment as an Indian tribe. Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 11; Defs.’ First SJ Mem. at 4.\n\nIn its response, the Department directed the Muwekma to file a formal petition for\n\nacknowledgment along with detailed documentation in accordance with the Part 83 criteria. Pl.’s\n\nFirst SJ Mem., Ex. 46 (April 25, 1989 letter from Joseph Little to Rosemary Cambra) at 1\n\n(cautioning Muwekma that “[b]ecause of the significance and permanence of acknowledgment\n\nas a tribe, the process of evaluation is a lengthy and thorough one”). The Muwekma then\n\nsubmitted a formal petition for acknowledgment in early 1995, as well as “thousands of pages”\n\nof supplemental material, Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 11, which included “primary and secondary\n\nsource documents, genealogical evidence, arguments by its researchers, and responses to\n\nquestions posed by the Department’s staff,” Defs.’ First SJ Mem. at 5. After reviewing the\n\nMuwekma’s petition and the accompanying materials, the Department concluded preliminarily\n\nin May 1996 “that the Pleasanton or Verona Band of Alameda County[, from which members of\n\nthe Muwekma tribe are directly descended,] was previously acknowledged by the federal\n\ngovernment between 1914 and 1927.” Defs.’ First SJ Mem. at 5; see also Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at\n\n11. The Department thus informed Muwekma “that it would be able to complete its petition\n\ndocumentation with the expectation that it would be evaluated under the federal acknowledgment\n\nregulations’ modified criteria set out in § 83.8.” Defs.’ First SJ Mem. at 5.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\fC.       The Muwekma’s Petition for Acknowledgment\n\n         In its petition, the Muwekma asserts that the Verona band continued to exist as a tribal\n\nentity after 1928. 6 See Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 5 (asserting that “Congress . . . never enacted\n\nlegislation terminating the trust relationship with the . . . Verona Band,” and that the Band did\n\n“not voluntarily abandon[] tribal relations.”). For instance, the Muwekma presented evidence of\n\na genealogical connection between the members of the Muwekma and “24 persons listed by the”\n\nBureau of Indian Affairs (“BIA”) 7 on a census of California Indians issued in 1933,” Pl.’s First\n\nSJ Mem., Ex. 7 (Proposed Finding) at 12, and that its members had been listed on the judgment\n\nroll “on three separate occasions[:] in 1933, 1955[,] and 1970,” Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 6. This list\n\nof Indians “was produced as a result of an act passed by Congress in 1928 [that] gave the Court\n\nof Claims jurisdiction to hear claims against the United States on behalf of the ‘Indians of\n\nCalifornia’ for compensation for aboriginal territory acquired by the [federal g]overnment.” Pl.’s\n\nFirst SJ Mem., Ex. 7 (Proposed Finding) at 12. Specifically, the Act provided compensation to\n\nthose claimants who were “Indians . . . residing in the State of California on June 1, 1852[, as\n\nwell as] their descendants [who were] living in [the] State.” Id., Ex. 6 (Final Determination) at\n\n22.\n\n         According to the Muwekma, “eligibility for the [judgment] roll depended on the\n\napplicant’s ability to demonstrate affiliation with[,] and descent from[,] a tribe that had retained\n\n\n6\n  The Muwekma presented numerous items of evidence in support of its position that it had been recognized by\nexternal sources as an Indian entity between 1927 and 1985, but the Department ultimately concluded that the\nevidence only reflected identification by external sources from 1965 to 1971, and from 1982 to the present. See id.,\nEx. 6 (Final Determination) at 47. The Court, therefore, will limit its discussion to only those items of evidence that\nthe Muwekma contends demonstrate external identifications of its organization from 1928 to 1965, and 1972 to\n1982, and the Court will not consider whether the Department’s conclusions as to the other items of evidence run\nafoul of the APA.\n7\n The BIA is a component of the Department. See United States Department of the Interior Official Website,\nhttp://www.interior.gov/bureaus/index.cfm.\n\n\n\n                                                           9\n\ftribal relations at least through the period of treaty-making.” Id. In support of its position that\n\nparticipation in the California Claims Act required membership in a federally recognized Indian\n\ntribe, the Muwekma cited a question on the application form that asked the following question:\n\n“What is your degree of Indian blood and to what Tribe or Band of Indians of the State of\n\nCalifornia do you belong?” Id. Furthermore, the Muwekma noted in its petition that fourteen of\n\nthe eighteen applicants answered that question by identifying themselves as members of “some\n\nvariant of ‘Mission San Jose.’” Id.; see also id. at 23 (“In its discussion of these 18 applications,\n\nthe petitioner concludes every chart entry but one with the statement that the evidence shows\n\napplicants ‘identifying themselves’ and their ancestors as ‘Mission San Jose’ Indians.”). In\n\nparticular, the Muwekma pointed to the application form of Jose Binoco, in which a BIA\n\nexaminer had written on the application that “[t]he applicant is a full blood Indian. He is one of\n\nthe last surviving members of the Mission San Jose Indian band”; the Muwekma argued that this\n\ncomment exhibited an external identification by the BIA examiner of the individual’s\n\ncontemporary tribal affiliation. Id. at 24. All of this evidence, the Muwekma argued, supported\n\nits position that inclusion on the judgment roll “required tribal affiliation,” and that “the approval\n\nof applications provid[es] . . . an identification of a contemporary entity.” Id. at 21.\n\n       In addition to their ancestors’ participation in the California Claims Act, the Muwekma\n\nasserted in its petition that two of its members attended schools operated by the BIA. Pl.’s First\n\nSJ Mem., Ex. 7 (Proposed Finding) at 74. Specifically, the Muwekma provided “twelve pages of\n\nrecords from the Sherman Institute . . . which demonstrate[d] that Domingo Marine attended this\n\nIndian school during the 1930’s,” as well as “nine pages of records which demonstrate that John\n\nand Rayna Guzman attended the Indian school at Chemawa, Oregon.” Id., Ex. 6 (Final\n\n\n\n\n                                                  10\n\fDetermination) at 30. The Muwekma “contend[ed] that approval by the BIA of [school]\n\nenrollment constitutes evidence of an external identification of an Indian entity” by the BIA. Id.\n\n       The Muwekma also relied on scholarly publications in support of its position that\n\nexternal sources had identified it as a tribal entity. One example was “a paper written in 1955 by\n\nanthropologists Alfred Kroeber and Robert Heizer for use in Indian Claims Commission cases,”\n\nid. at 32, which the Muwekma argued contained “a clear reference” to the Indians of the San\n\nJose Mission, a group that had later taken refuge “in Pleasanton as one of the groups [that]\n\ncontinued to maintain their existence,” Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 39-40. The Muwekma relied as\n\nwell on a book authored by Malcolm Margolin in 1978 titled The Ohlone Way: Indian Life in the\n\nSan Francisco-Monterey Bay Area, in which Margolin made the following observation: “Today\n\nthe descendants of the Ohlone Indians are still among us . . . [as] a small, seldom noticed part of\n\nthe Bay Area population.” Id. at 44. The Muwekma also cited a 1978 article by Richard Levy\n\npublished in the Smithsonian Institution’s Handbook of North American Indians, which\n\nmentioned the formation of the Ohlone Indian Tribe, Inc. in 1971. Pl.’s First SJ Mem., Ex. 7\n\n(Proposed Finding) at 16. The Muwekma argued that all of these references evidence an\n\nidentification of the entity by external sources.\n\nD.     The Department’s Findings\n\n       The Department issued its proposed finding regarding the Muwekma’s petition on July\n\n30, 2001. Id. at 1. Because the Department initially made “a preliminary finding that the\n\n[group] was a successor to a previously recognized” tribe known as the Verona band, “which had\n\nbeen recognized as late as 1927,” id. at 15, the Department concluded that the Muwekma need\n\nonly present evidence that “satisf[ied] all of the criteria in paragraphs (a) through (g) of [Section]\n\n83.7,” 25 C.F.R. § 83.6(c), as modified by Section 83.8, 25 C.F.R. § 83.8(a), since 1927, id. at\n\n\n\n\n                                                    11\n\f15. Even under the modified criteria of Section 83.8, however, “the Department propose[d] to\n\ndecline . . . acknowledge[ment of] the . . . Muwekma . . . as an Indian Tribe” because the\n\nMuwekma did “not meet all seven criteria required for Federal acknowledgment.” Id. at 61.\n\nSpecifically, the Department concluded that the Muwekma did not, inter alia, meet the standard\n\nset forth in Section 83.7(a), as modified by Section 83.8(d)(1), id., because the Muwekma failed\n\nto present sufficient evidence of identification by external sources that it was “the same tribal\n\nentity that was previously acknowledged[,] or as a portion that has evolved from that entity.” Id.\n\nat 15 (quoting 25 C.F.R. § 83.8(d)(1)). After the Muwekma presented additional evidence in\n\nresponse to the issues raised by the Department, the Department then issued its Final\n\nDetermination on September 6, 2002, in which it adopted the conclusions presented in the\n\nProposed Finding and provided additional analysis regarding the newly presented evidence by\n\nthe Muwekma. See generally Pl.’s First SJ Mem., Ex. 6 (Final Determination).\n\n         As an initial matter, the Department concluded that the Muwekma failed to present\n\nsufficient evidence that the entity had been identified “as the same tribal entity that was\n\npreviously acknowledged[,] or as a portion that has evolved from that entity.” Pl.’s First SJ\n\nMem., Ex. 7 (Proposed Finding) at 15 (quoting 25 C.F.R. § 83.8(d)(1)). According to the\n\nDepartment, the Muwekma could only produce one example between 1927 and 1995 where the\n\nMuwekma was identified “as [the entity] that had evolved from the Indian settlement at the\n\nVerona station,” and the Department concluded that “[o]ne example is not sufficient to meet”\n\nSection 83.8(d)(1). 8 Id. Accordingly, the Department evaluated the Muwekma’s petition under\n\n\n8\n  It is not entirely clear why Rule 83.8(d)(1) requires a petitioner to demonstrate that not only has it been recognized\nas an American Indian entity on a substantially continuous basis since the date of last Federal acknowledgment, but\nthat the petitioner must also show that it has “been identified by [external] sources as the same tribal entity that was\npreviously acknowledged[,] or as a portion that has evolved from that entity.” After all, Rule 83.8(d)(5) makes clear\nthat if a petitioner is not able to demonstrate that external sources have identified it as the same entity that evolved\nfrom the previously acknowledged tribe, then that requirement is dispensed with, and the petitioner need only show\n                                                                                                            (continued . . .)\n\n\n                                                            12\n\fthe alternative criteria prescribed in Rules 83.8(d)(5) and 83.7(a)—whether the Muwekma “has\n\nbeen identified as an American Indian entity on a substantially continuous basis” since the date it\n\nwas last acknowledged by the Federal Government, or 1927.\n\n         Even under the modified standard of Rule 83.7(a), the Department concluded that the\n\nMuwekma failed to present sufficient evidence that it had been recognized as an American\n\nIndian entity on a substantially continuous basis by external sources between 1927 and 1985. 9\n\nId. at 24. First, the Department rejected the Muwekma’s argument that the listing of “its\n\nmembers or their ancestors . . . by the Bureau of Indian Affairs pursuant to the Act of May 18,\n\n1928, which allowed Indian claims to be made against the United States,” constitutes evidence of\n\nan external identification. Id. at 73. The Department concluded that “the claims against the\n\nUnited States authorized by that . . . act, as the petitioner acknowledges, were brought on behalf\n\nof the ‘Indians of California,’” and thus “[a]pplicants applied as individuals, and their statements\n\nabout their historical tribe of their ancestors were a form of self-identification of a[] historical,\n\nnot contemporary entity.” Id. In other words, “there was no need for the BIA to identify any\n\nspecific tribe or band of Indians for the accepted applicants” in order to determine whether an\n\napplicant was eligible to recover under the Claims Act. Id. As further evidence of its findings,\n\nthe Department pointed to a 1936 letter by the superintendent of the Sacramento Agency, who\n\ninformed “Dolores (Lola) Marine Galvan, one of the [plaintiff's] ancestors,” that she did not have\n\n(. . . continued)\nthat it has been recognized as an American Indian entity on a substantially continuous basis since the date of last\nFederal acknowledgment. It would appear, then, that the requirement that the petitioner had been identified as the\nsame tribal entity that was previously acknowledged is completely superfluous—indeed, the Department seemingly\nrecognized as much in the Proposed Finding. See Pl.’s First SJ Mem., Ex. 7 (Proposed Finding) at 15 (“It is a\npeculiarity of the regulations that there is a lower evidentiary burden on this petitioner if it is evaluated since 1927\nunder 83.7(a) without modification by [S]ection 83.8(d)(1).”). In any event, the plaintiff does not challenge the\nDepartment’s interpretation of Rule 83.8(d)(1) or 83.8(d)(5) in its motion for summary judgment, and thus the\nDepartment’s interpretation of these provisions is of no concern to the Court in resolving the motions before it.\n9\n  The Department concluded that the Muwekma provided sufficient evidence that it “ha[d] been identified as an\nIndian entity by a variety of external observers on a consistent basis since 1985.” Pl.’s First SJ Mem., Ex. 7\n(Proposed Finding) at 23.\n\n\n\n                                                           13\n\f“‘ward status’ or Federal recognition.” Id. This correspondence was significant to the\n\nDepartment because “Galvan was included on the 1933 judgment roll as a California Indian,”\n\nand thus “the superintendent did not equate” eligibility under the Act “with ‘ward status’ or\n\nFederal recognition.” Id. The Department found further corroboration of its analysis in another\n\nstatement by the superintendent, in which he stated that “Mrs. Galvan is shown on the Roll of\n\nCalifornia Indians . . . but does not have ward status and[,] therefore, is not eligible for any aid\n\nfrom Federal funds through this agency.” Id. at 73-74. As a result of its analysis, the\n\nDepartment gave no weight to any evidence that an individual’s recovery under the Claims Act\n\nconstituted an external identification of any American Indian entity. Id. at 73.\n\n       The Department also found no probative significance in the fact that the claims\n\napplication asked the applicant to identify their “degree of Indian blood and [the] Tribe or Band\n\nof Indians of the State of California” to which the applicant belonged. Pl.'s First SJ Mem., Ex. 6\n\n(Final Determination) at 22. The Department noted that “fourteen of the 18 applicants answer\n\n[that] question . . . with some variant of ‘Mission San Jose,’” and that “[t]his response referred to\n\n[nineteenth] century tribal ancestry, not to contemporary membership.” Id. Furthermore, the\n\nDepartment noted that two of the applicants had stated “Tribal name unknown,” and that another\n\napplicant had answered “Ohlones(?) Tribal name [u]nknown,” and that these answers hardly\n\ndemonstrate contemporary tribal affiliation because “[g]enerally, an individual’s active tribal\n\nmembership would not be unknown to him or her, while his or her specific tribal ancestry back\n\nto 1852 could be unknown.” Id. at 22-23. Thus, the claims application was “interpreted” by the\n\nDepartment “to inquire about the applicant’s historical tribal ancestry” and did not constitute a\n\ncontemporaneous identification by an external source. Id. at 23.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  14\n\f       Evidence that several members of the Muwekma attended Indian boarding schools also\n\nfailed to persuade the Department. Although the Department acknowledged a “1969 letter by\n\n[John] Guzman [that] refers to his attendance[] and his sister’s attendance” at a BIA school, the\n\nMuwekma failed to provide the Department with “BIA records and school records,” and thus it\n\nwas “impossible” for the Department “to know on what basis these individuals attended these\n\nschools.” Id. This was especially true, according to the Department, “because some Indian\n\nstudents were accepted on the basis of their blood degree, rather than their tribal membership.”\n\nId. at 74. Thus, the Department concluded that “attendance at these Indian schools was not\n\nnecessarily based on identification of an Indian tribe or group.” Id.\n\n       In response to the Proposed Finding, the Muwekma submitted, inter alia, “[a]n\n\napplication form for John Guzman, dated 1944,” but the Department concluded that “[t]he form\n\ncontain[ed] no information on tribal membership and no tribal certification or endorsement.”\n\nPl.'s First SJ Mem., Ex. 6 (Final Determination) at 31. And, while the form listed John\n\nGuzman’s tribe as “Mission,” the Department found this to be a “generic reference[ that] applies\n\nto many separate Indian groups,” and that it did not “refer to the [Muwekma] as a specific Indian\n\nentity.” Id. Indeed, “[a]n incomplete copy of a 1944 letter from the Sacramento Indian Agency\n\nabout . . . [John] Guzman stated: “There is no doubt that these children have sufficient Indian\n\nblood to admit them to a Government Boarding School.” Id. Based on this evidence, the\n\nDepartment concluded that entry into the boarding schools was not based on tribal affiliation, but\n\nrather on “their degree of Indian blood.” Id.\n\n       Finally, the Department rejected the scholarly articles that the Muwekma relied on in\n\ndemonstrating external identifications. First, the Department declined to accept the Smithsonian\n\nInstitution’s Handbook of North American Indians as an example of an external identification of\n\n\n\n\n                                                15\n\fthe Muwekma for several reasons. The Department found that the author of the article merely\n\n“described the Costanoan language family and concluded that the aboriginal Costanoan were\n\nneither a single ethnic group nor a political entity.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nFurthermore, the Department noted that the author “referred to [the] Pleasanton [rancheria] as\n\none of the multiethnic Indian communities [that] existed for a period of time after the\n\nsecularization of the missions in 1834.” Id. For these reasons, the Department discerned no\n\nreference to the Muwekma by the author of the book. See id.\n\n       Second, the Department rejected the Muwekma’s reliance on the 1955 paper written by\n\nanthropologists Alfred Kroeber and Robert Heizer. Id. at 32-33. In the paper, the authors\n\n“selected and examined a small, non-random[] ‘strategic sample’ of the 1933 census roll of the\n\n‘Indians of California’ as prepared by the [Department] in response to claims brought under the\n\nIndian claims jurisdiction act of 1928.” Id. at 32-33. Based on the Department’s analysis, it\n\nconcluded that the authors “did not claim that Indian entities or settlements existed in 1955, or in\n\n1933, but that historical groups that had lost their distinct culture had surviving lineal\n\ndescendants in the population of California at the time of the 1933 list.” Id. at 33. Put\n\ndifferently, the Department construed the 1955 paper as arguing “that even though Indian\n\ncultures had become extinct, Indian populations had not.” Id. Thus, the Department concluded\n\nthat the “1955 paper is not evidence sufficient to meet” Section 83.7(a) because “[w]hether\n\nindividuals of Indian descent survived until 1933, or later, is not the test posed by criterion (a).”\n\nId.\n\n       The Department also declined to give weight to the 1978 Margolin study. Id. at 44. The\n\nDepartment found that “the book is an account of an Ohlone lifestyle prior to European\n\nsettlement, and thus is not relevant to an analysis of the petitioner since 1927.” Id. The\n\n\n\n\n                                                  16\n\fDepartment acknowledged a passage cited by the petitioner in which the author noted that “the\n\ndescendants of the Ohlone Indians are still among us. . . . [as] a small, seldom noticed part of the\n\nBay Area population,” but the Department found this to be merely an “acknowledge[ment of] the\n\nexistence of living Ohlone individuals,” and not an identification of “any Indian entity in 1978.”\n\nId. (alteration in original).\n\nE.       The Department’s Affirmation of Tribal Status for the Lower Lake and Ione Tribes\n\n         In 1994, the Department conferred federal recognition upon the Ione Band of Miwok\n\n(“Ione”), a Central California Indian tribe. Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 25; id., Exs. 61-63; see also\n\nCompl. ¶ 26; Answer at 22. The Department similarly acknowledged the tribal status of the\n\nLower Lake Rancheria of California (“Lower Lake”), another Central California tribe, by placing\n\nit on the list of federally recognized tribes in 2001. 10 Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 24; id., Ex. 60; see\n\nalso Compl. ¶ 26; Answer at 23. Neither the Ione nor Lower Lake were required by the\n\nDepartment to submit a formal petition for tribal acknowledgment under Part 83, nor were they\n\nrequired to undergo the “lengthy and thorough” process of evaluation “based on detailed\n\ndocumentation provided by the petitioner,” Pl.’s First SJ Mem., Ex. 46, before receiving the\n\nbenefits of federal tribal recognition, Compl. ¶ 26; Answer at 22, 23 (admitting that the\n\nDepartment “clarified the status of [Ione] . . . [and] reaffirmed the status of [Lower Lake]\n\n\n10\n   There is some confusion in the record regarding the year in which the tribal status of Lower Lake was formally\nacknowledged. See Compl. ¶ 26 (stating that “in 2002, [Lower Lake] . . . was reaffirmed by administrative action”);\nAnswer at 23 (admitting that “in December 2000, [the Department] reaffirmed the status of [Lower Lake]”); Pl.’s\nFirst SJ Mem. at 24 (stating that “[o]n January 3, 2001, the Department announced that it would correct its records\nto recognize [Lower Lake]”) (citing Pl.’s First SJ Mem., Ex. 60 (January 3, 2001 DOI news release)). The precise\ndate of Lower Lake’s recognition is not material to this litigation, but for convenience the Court will refer to January\n3, 2001, the date on which the Department formally stated that it had “reaffirmed the federal trust relationship\nbetween the United States and . . . [Lower Lake],” as the operative date. Pl.’s First SJ Mem., Ex. 60 at 1. The\nDepartment also extended federal acknowledgment to two Alaska tribes, without requiring them to proceed through\nthe Part 83 process, at the same time it recognized Lower Lake. Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 24 (citing Pl.’s First SJ\nMem., Ex. 60); Pl.’s Opp. at 2; Answer at 30 (stating that “the former Assistant Secretary reaffirmed the status of\ntwo Alaska Native villages outside the [P]art 83 acknowledgment procedures during the pendency of the Muwekma\npetition”).\n\n\n\n                                                          17\n\fwithout requiring [them] to submit . . . petition[s] under . . . Part 83”); Answer at 30 (admitting\n\nthat “while the [Muwekma] Tribe’s petition for recognition was pending, the Department\n\nreaffirmed the status of [Ione] and [Lower Lake] outside the [Part 83] procedures”). Moreover,\n\nthe Department does not dispute the Muwekma’s allegation that the Ione and Lower Lake, like\n\nthe Muwekma, “were . . . Central California tribes previously recognized at least as late as 1927”\n\nwho did not appear on the 1979 list of federally recognized tribes despite “never [having] been\n\nterminated by Congress [or] by any official action of [the Department].” Pl.’s First SJ Opp. at 5;\n\nsee also Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 23-27; Answer at 22-23.\n\n       The Muwekma alleges that on several occasions, it requested that the Department\n\nreaffirm its tribal status through administrative correction, as the Department had done with the\n\nIone and Lower Lake, without requiring that its completed petition be evaluated under the Part\n\n83 criteria. Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 11; Compl. ¶ 27; Answer at 23. The Department denied the\n\nMuwekma’s requests, stating that it did not have the power to restore the Muwekma to the list of\n\nrecognized tribes by administrative means. Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 11; Compl. ¶ 27; Answer at 23\n\n(admitting that “[n]otwithstanding the Department actions to the contrary with respect to the Ione\n\nBand and Lower Lake, [Department] staff repeatedly advised [Muwekma] that the Assistant\n\nSecretary [of Indian Affairs] lacked authority to administratively reaffirm tribal status”).\n\nF.     The Present Litigation\n\n       The Muwekma brought this action on June 6, 2003, seeking reversal of the Final\n\nDetermination, placement on the Department’s list of federally recognized tribes, and other\n\ninjunctive relief. Compl. at 18. On July 13, 2005, the Muwekma moved for summary judgment,\n\nalleging that (1) “the Department recognized the Muwekma . . . under congressional legislation\n\nat least until 1927,” Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 17, and because “Congress has the sole authority to\n\n\n\n\n                                                 18\n\fterminate tribes,” id. at 15, the Department “had no authority to withdraw recognition [of the\n\nMuwekma] in the Final Determination, id. at 17; (2) the Department’s recognition of the Verona\n\nband in 1927 “established a trust relationship” and that the Department’s Final Determination\n\n“constituted [a] serious violation[] of its fiduciary duty to the Muwekma,” id.; (3) the\n\nDepartment violated the APA and the Equal Protection Clause when it required Muwekma to\n\npetition for acknowledgment of its tribal status pursuant to the “lengthy and thorough” regulatory\n\nprocedures of Part 83, id., Ex. 46, despite administratively reaffirming the status of similarly\n\nsituated tribes without requiring those tribes to undertake the Part 83 process and without\n\nsufficient explanation for the disparate treatment, id. at 21-22, 26-30; see also Pl.’s First SJ\n\nOpp’n at 9-12; Compl. ¶¶ 37-39, 44-47; (4) the Department violated the Muwekma’s due process\n\n“right to continued recognition, including the associated services, protections[,] and financial\n\nbenefits,” id. at 30; (5) the Department violated Section 554(d) of the APA by allowing “one of\n\nits attorney advisors” to both represent the Department in an earlier litigation involving the\n\nMuwekma, 11 and “advise[] . . . the Department[ in its] decision on the merits of the Muwekma’s\n\npetition for recognition,” id. at 33; see also 5 U.S.C. § 554(d) (barring “[a]n employee or agent”\n\nof an agency to participate both “in the performance of investigation or prosecuting functions for\n\nan agency” and to “participate or advise in the decision recommended decision, or agency\n\nreview” of that same or “factually related case, . . . except as witness or counsel in public\n\nproceedings”); and (6) “the Final Determination was arbitrary and capricious because it\n\nimproperly refused to consider, rejected[,] or misconstrued substantial evidence demonstrating\n\n11\n  The prior litigation in this Court referenced by the Muwekma involved a petition for a writ of mandamus it filed to\ncompel the Department “to complete within twelve months its review of the [Muwekma’s] petition for\nacknowledgment as a federally recognized Indian tribe.” Muwekma Tribe v. Babbitt, 133 F. Supp. 2d 30, 31\n(D.D.C. 2000) (Urbina, J.). Judge Urbina ultimately directed the Department to conclude its review of the\nMuwekma’s petition by March 11, 2002. Muwekma Tribe v.

Supp. 2d 42, 51 (D.D.C. 2001)\n(Urbina, J.).\n\n\n\n\n                                                         19\n\fthat the Tribe satisfied the recognition criteria” set forth under Section 83, id. at 35. In response\n\nto Muwekma’s summary judgment motion, the defendants filed a cross-motion for summary\n\njudgment on September 12, 2005, arguing that (1) the Muwekma’s claim that the Department\n\nunlawfully withdrew recognition in the Final Determination “is barred by the statute of\n\nlimitations[] because it accrued more than six years ago,” Defs.’ First SJ Mem at 28; (2) even\n\nassuming that the action is not barred by the statute of limitations, “it is clear that [the\n\nDepartment’s] application of the federal acknowledgment regulations to [the p]laintiff’s petition\n\nand subsequent [F]inal [D]etermination were lawful,” id. at 32; (2) the Muwekma’s assertion of a\n\ntrust obligation owed to it by the Department “has no merit,” id. at 37, because its “claim is\n\npremised on its faulty belief that it continues to be a recognized tribe,” id. at 38; (3) the\n\nMuwekma’s due process claim cannot survive because it does not have a “critical\n\nconstitutionally protected property interest” in federal acknowledgment as a Native American\n\ntribe, id. at 42; (4) Section 554(d) is inapposite because “by its express terms,” the statute applies\n\nin cases where an “[a]djudication [is] required by statute to be determined on the record after\n\nopportunity for an agency hearing,” id. at 48; (5) the Department did not violate the Equal\n\nProtection Clause because it had a rational basis for requiring the Muwekma to petition under\n\nSection 83, id. at 39-40, and that “groups demonstrating or alleging characteristics similar to\n\n[Muwekma] are regularly required to proceed through the federal acknowledgment process,” id.\n\nat 40; see also Defs.’ Reply at 17-19; and (6) “[t]he Assistant Secretary’s final determination that\n\n[the p]laintiff was not entitled to a government-to-government relationship with the United States\n\nis fully supported by the lengthy administrative record in this case,” id. at 9.\n\n        The Court issued a memorandum opinion and order on September 21, 2006, in which it\n\ndenied both parties’ motions for summary judgment and remanded this case back to the\n\n\n\n\n                                                  20\n\fDepartment to allow the agency to supplement the record. Muwekma Ohlone Tribe v.\n\nKempthorne, 452 F. Supp. 2d 105, 107 (D.D.C. 2006). Specifically, “the Court conclude[d] that\n\nthe defendants [had] not articulated a sufficient basis for the Department’s disparate treatment of\n\nMuwekma and the Ione and Lower Lake tribes.” Id. at 116. While the Court acknowledged the\n\nexistence of the modified Part 83 procedures for those entities that can demonstrate prior federal\n\nacknowledgment, the Court found the relevant inquiry to be “whether the Department has\n\nprovided a rational basis for requiring Muwekma to adhere to the Part 83 procedure while\n\nexempting other tribes that are purportedly similarly situated.” Id. at 116. After reviewing the\n\nrecord, the Court concluded that “the Department . . . has never provided a clear and coherent\n\nexplanation for its disparate treatment of Muwekma when compared with Ione and Lower Lake,\n\nnor has it ever, in the administrative record or in the papers before this Court, articulated\n\nstandards that guided its decision to require Muwekma to submit a petition and documentation\n\nunder Part 83 while allowing other tribes to bypass the formal tribal recognition procedure\n\naltogether.” Id. at 121; see also id. at 119 (“[T]he defendants here have cited nothing to explain\n\nthe basis for [its] decision to treat Muwekma differently from Ione and Lower Lake.”); id. at 120\n\n(“[T]he administrative record contains no indication why the Department would refuse to\n\nconsider Muwekma’s requests for administrative correction while allowing Ione and Lower Lake\n\nto proceed outside the Part 83 regulatory process.”); id. at 124 (“[T]here is no contemporaneous\n\nexplanation of the Department’s decision to treat Muwekma differently from Ione and Lower\n\nLake; indeed, it is the lack of a reasoned explanation in this regard that Muwekma is challenging\n\nunder the Equal Protection Clause and the APA.”); id. at 125 (“[T]he Court is unable to discern\n\nthe Department’s rationale for requiring Muwekma to proceed through the Part 83 tribal\n\nacknowledgment procedures while allowing other tribes that appear to be similarly situated to\n\n\n\n\n                                                 21\n\fbypass the procedures altogether . . . .”). The Court did observe in a footnote that the agency had\n\n“obliquely” attempted to distinguish the Muwekma from the Lower Lake by noting that the\n\ngovernment had previously acquired land in trust for the Lower Lake, and that the Lower Lake\n\nparticipated in an Indian Reorganization Act election, but the Court found this explanation\n\ninsufficient to justify “the Department’s allegedly differential treatment of Muwekma” because\n\n“this explanation pertain[ed] only to a difference between Muwekma and one of the tribes with\n\nwhom it is claiming to be similarly situated,” and that the record does not reflect that “it required\n\nthe Muwekman and not Lower Lake to undergo the Part 83 procedure because the latter, unlike\n\nthe former, had received land in trust and had participated in an election.” Id. at 118 n.13. The\n\nCourt, therefore, directed the Department to “provide a detailed explanation of the reasons for its\n\nrefusal to waive the Part 83 procedures when evaluating Muwekma’s request for federal tribal\n\nrecognition.” Id. at 124.\n\n       On November 27, 2006, in response to the Court’s memorandum opinion and order, the\n\nDepartment filed a document titled “Explanation to Supplement the Administrative Record –\n\nMuwekma Ohlone Tribe.” Explanation to Supplement the Administrative Record at 1. In this\n\nsubmission, the Department explained that its “decisions to clarify the status of Ione in 1994 and\n\nto reaffirm [f]ederal recognition of Lower Lake in 2000 . . . were not based merely on a finding\n\nthat those groups were previously recognized by the [f]ederal [g]overnment at some time in the\n\npast.” Id. at 2. Rather, the Department found that the “Lower Lake and Ione . . . had trust lands,\n\nagreements, legislation, or consultation [with the Federal Government] decades later than 1927,”\n\nwhere as the Muwekma had no such interactions with the federal government. Id. at 7. Rather,\n\nthe Department explained that “[t]he Ione and Lower Lake decisions justified action on behalf of\n\nthose groups that Muwekma did not share.” Id. at 3. For those reasons, the Department\n\n\n\n\n                                                 22\n\fconcluded that the “Muwekma was not similarly situated to either Ione or . . . Lower Lake.” Id.\n\nat 3.\n\n        With regard to the Lower Lake, the Department noted that the record in that case\n\n“demonstrates a pattern of Federal dealings with the Lower Lake Rancheria that differs from the\n\nabsence of any similar evidence for a Verona band.” Id. at 7. For instance, “[t]he [f]ederal\n\n[g]overnment purchased land to establish the Lower Lake Rancheria on January 25, 1916,” and\n\n“[t]he government held this land in trust until the Act of 1956 authorized its sale.” Id. The\n\nDepartment also cited a report issued in 1927 that both “advised against the purchase of land for\n\na Verona band,” and “recommended that land be purchased for the Lower Lake band.” Id.\n\nThen, “[i]n 1935,” the agency again sought to acquire additional land for the band and other\n\nsmall groups.” Id. Several years later, the Department issued a report in which it “noted the\n\nexistence of a Lower Lake group living off the rancheria,” after which it “authorized an\n\nindividual to move onto the rancheria and . . . surveyed the rancheria’s population.” Id. The\n\nDepartment also noted that the existence of the Lower Lake had been recognized by the federal\n\ngovernment on two separate occasions—in 1953, when the United States “House of\n\nRepresentatives listed the Lower Lake Rancheria” in House Report 2503, and in 1980 when “the\n\nBIA central office and regional office considered including the Lower Lake Rancheria on the list\n\nof federally recognized tribes, but did not do so.” Id. Based on these dealings with the federal\n\ngovernment, the Department concluded that the “Lower Lake and Muwekma were not similarly\n\nsituated.” Id. at 6.\n\n        The Department also identified a history of contact between the federal government and\n\nthe Ione. “The [f]ederal [g]overnment attempted to purchase land for” the Ione, which had been\n\nexplicitly “identified by a census made by a special agent in 1915.” Id. at 7. In 1916, “the\n\n\n\n\n                                                23\n\fIndian Office obtained a deed and abstract of title for the purchase of land for the Ione[,] . . . and\n\nthe Department provided the Office with a formal “Authority” for the purchase. Id. The\n\nDepartment then cited documents reflecting an “extensive, but unsuccessful, effort[] to clear title\n\nto the land for the” Ione from 1915 to 1925. Id. Then, “[i]n 1941, the Department considered a\n\npetition from the ‘Indians of the Ione Valley’ requesting the purchase of land.” Id. at 7-8. “In\n\n1970, two Ione individuals contacted the BIA about the status of the land on which they lived,”\n\nand subsequently “the California Rural Indian Land Project . . . of the California Indian Legal\n\nServices proposed bringing a quiet[-]title action on behalf of the Ione Band . . . and requesting\n\nthat the land be accepted and held in trust.” Id. As a result, in October 1972, the Department\n\nissued a letter “accept[ing] by relinquishment of title or gift [a] parcel of land to be held in trust\n\nfor the Ione Band of Miwok Indians.” Id. The Department found that these facts, which\n\nevidenced a “historical circumstance of an uncompleted acquisition of trust land on the [Ione’s]\n\nbehalf,” were sufficient to differentiate the Ione from the Muwekma.\n\n        As for the Muwekma, the Department concluded that the same 1927 report that\n\nrecommended a land purchase for the Lower Lake concluded that “a land purchase did not need\n\nto be made for members of a Verona band.” Id. The Department also noted that after 1906,\n\nvarious “appropriation acts that authorized purchases of land for homeless California Indians . . .\n\nalso did not mandate action specifically on behalf of the Verona band.” Id. Although the\n\nMuwekma contended that the author of the report “failed to carry out his instructions” to\n\npurchase land on behalf of the Verona band, the Department concluded that the author’s\n\n“instructions contained no request for specific action or a specific result on behalf of a Verona\n\nband.” Id. Rather, “[t]he instructions [he] received in 1927 were to submit a general report\n\nabout California Indians, without making an extensive field investigation, and to identify the\n\n\n\n\n                                                  24\n\fband for whom land should be purchased.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the\n\nDepartment concluded “that the historical circumstances of Muwekma can be distinguished from\n\nthose of Ione and Lower Lake.” Id. at 9.\n\n        Based on the Department’s supplementation of the record, the plaintiff once again moved\n\nfor summary judgment. Although the plaintiff has reasserted all of the grounds it relied upon in\n\nits initial summary judgment filing, Pl.’s Second SJ Mem. at 36, the plaintiff focused its efforts\n\non demonstrating that “the Department . . . denied equal protection of the law and acted\n\narbitrarily and capriciously toward the Muwekma . . . by unreasonably refusing to reaffirm\n\nMuwekma’s recognized status and by requiring it to submit instead to the burdensome\n\nprocedures of . . . []Part 83[],” Id. at 1. Specifically, the plaintiff argued, inter alia, that the\n\nDepartment’s reliance on having “at least intended to purchase federal trust property” as a basis\n\nfor distinguishing the Muwekma from Lower Lake and Ione “is merely a post hoc rationalization\n\nby Department officials that had nothing to do with the Ione or Lower Lake decisions at the\n\ntime,” id. at 28, because “[b]oth Congress and the Department of the Interior have repeatedly\n\nrecognized tribes that had no land, and have specifically provided for the purchase of land, to be\n\nheld in trust, after recognition, id. at 29 (footnotes omitted). The Muwekma further argues that\n\nits review of federal-acknowledgment “decisions demonstrates that not one . . . decision uses the\n\nlack of federal trust land (or any attempts to secure such trust land) as evidence against a\n\npetitioner or as a negative factor under the criteria.” Id. at 30 (footnote omitted). The Muwekma\n\nalso notes that “in neither of [the] decisions” relating to the Lower Lake or the Ione “did the\n\nDepartment state that the trust land . . . issue was a factor weighing in the decision to recognize\n\nthese two Tribes outside of the Part 83 process.” Id. at 33. In any event, the Muwekma argues\n\nthat “the trust land issue is a false factual distinction in any case” because “the Muwekma . . . , as\n\n\n\n\n                                                    25\n\fthe Verona [b]and, was found to be eligible for trust land purchase,” and that “none of [the three\n\nTribes] possessed any trust land at the time they sought recognition” by the federal government.\n\nId. (emphasis omitted).\n\n       The Department renewed its cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing, inter alia, that\n\nthe “[p]laintiff is not similarly situated to Lower Lake or Ione[] because it lacks a long-standing\n\ngovernmental relationship with the United States.” Defs.’ Second SJ Mem. at 8. The\n\nDepartment noted that “[i]n contrast to [the Lower Lake and Ione], there is no evidence of any\n\nfederal dealings with a Muwekma group or Verona band after 1927.” Id. (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). The Department emphasized the fact that it had multiple dealings with the\n\nLower Lake, id., and that “[l]ike Lower Lake, Ione had a long-standing governmental\n\nrelationship with the United States[,] although sporadically documented.” Id. at 10. As to the\n\nMuwekma, however, the Department argued that the “[p]laintiff’s relationship with the United\n\nStates ended much farther in the past.” Id. at 12. The Department once again rejected the\n\nposition that the enrollment of individuals “for judgment funds awarded to the ‘Indians of\n\nCalifornia,’” and the attendance at BIA schools by “three individuals in the 1930[]s and 1940[]s”\n\nwas proof that the Muwekma was recognized as a tribal entity by the United States, arguing that\n\n“the United States . . . provided funds and services to individual Indians.” Id. at 13. As a result,\n\nthe Department argued that “these allegations fail to establish that [the p]laintiff is similarly\n\nsituated to [the] Lower Lake and Ione.” Id.\n\n       After considering the parties’ renewed submissions, the Court issued an order on\n\nSeptember 30, 2008, concluding that the Department’s “arguments, and the explanation . . .\n\ngiving rise to them, seemingly cannot be reconciled with the Court’s September 21, 2006\n\n[M]emorandum [O]pinion.” Id. at 5. The Court noted that it had “determined in its prior\n\n\n\n\n                                                  26\n\f[M]emorandum [O]pinion that the defendants’ arguments to the effect that the plaintiff was not\n\nsimilarly situated to Ione and Lower Lake were without merit,” and that “[t]he necessary\n\nimplication of both conclusions is that the Court found the plaintiff to be similarly situated to\n\nIone and Lower Lake.” Id. at 7. The Court explained that it had “remanded the case to the\n\nDepartment so it could explain why it treated similarly situated tribes differently, not so that it\n\ncould construct post-hoc arguments as to whether the tribes were similarly situated in the first\n\nplace.” Id. at 9. The Court further stated that “[i]t certainly did not remand the case so that the\n\nDepartment could re-open the record, weigh facts that it had never previously considered, and\n\narrive at a conclusion vis-à-vis the similarity of the plaintiff’s situation to those of Ione and\n\nLower Lake that it had never reached before.” Id. at 9. Accordingly, the Court stayed the\n\nparties’ summary judgment motions, id. at 1, and directed “the parties to file supplemental\n\nmemoranda of law addressing . . . whether the Court should consider administrative records\n\npertaining to the [Lower Lake and Ione] that were not considered when the Department issued its\n\ninitial decision denying the plaintiff’s petition for recognition,” id. at 9.\n\n        The Department filed its Supplemental Memorandum on October 30, 2008. Defs.’ Supp.\n\nMem. at 16. The Department asserts that it “did not understand the Court’s Order of September\n\n21, 2006, to have held that [the p]laintiff was similarly situated to [the] Ione and Lower Lake”\n\nbecause the Court had concluded that . . . ‘it lack[ed] sufficient information about the\n\nDepartment’s decision to recognize [the] Ione and Lower Lake outside of the Part 83 process.”\n\nId. (quoting Muwekma, 452 F. Supp. 2d at 113). In any event, the Department argues that\n\n“neither the law-of-the-case doctrine nor the mandate rule apply to [the d]efendants’ arguments\n\nregarding [the p]laintiff’s equal protection and APA claim,” id. at 2, “because the Court’s Order\n\nof September 21, 2006, was an interlocutory order,” id. at 3, and such “‘orders are not subject to\n\n\n\n\n                                                   27\n\fthe law-of-the-case doctrine and may always be reconsidered prior to final judgment,’” id.\n\n(quoting Langevine v. Dist. of Columbia, 106 F.3d 1018, 1023 (D.C. Cir. 1997)). Furthermore,\n\nthe Department notes that “courts generally recognize an exception to the mandate rule in the\n\nevent that an earlier decision was erroneous,” id. at 5 (citing United States v. Allen, 41 Fed.\n\nApp’x 367, 369 (10th Cir. 2002) and United States v. Amedeo, 487 F.3d 823, 830 (6th Cir.\n\n2006)), and because it asserts that the findings set forth in the Explanation to Supplement the\n\nAdministrative Record “demonstrate[] that [the p]laintiff is not similarly situated to Ione and\n\nLower Lake in critical respects . . . . [,] the Court should deviate from its earlier mandate and\n\nfurther consider the question of whether [the p]laintiff is similarly situated to Ione and Lower\n\nLake,” id. at 6.\n\n        The Muwekma has responded to the Department’s supplemental memorandum by\n\nasserting that the Department “was . . . bound to follow the mandate of this Court and limit the\n\nscope of its remand to the Memorandum Opinion’s order of an ‘express justification’ and a\n\n‘detailed explanation of the reasons’ for requiring Muwekma to proceed through the lengthy\n\nfederal acknowledgment process while exempting” the Lower Lake and the Ione. Pl.’s Supp.\n\nOpp’n at 6. And the Muwekma contends that “[o]nly three exceptionally narrow reasons may\n\nprovide a basis” for “depart[ing] from the law[-]of[-]the[-]case and this Court’s mandate,” id. at\n\n8 (internal quotation marks omitted): “(1) if there is new intervening law; (2) if a prior holding is\n\nclearly erroneous and would work a manifest justice; and (3) where the evidence in a subsequent\n\ntrial or before a second judge is substantially different,” id. at 8-9 (footnote omitted), all of which\n\nit argues “do not apply here,” id. at 8; see also id. at 9. Thus, the Muwekma posits that it is\n\n“entitled to summary judgment restoring it to the list of federally recognized tribes.” Id. at 1.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  28\n\f                                   II.     Standard of Review\n\n       Courts will grant a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56(a) of the Federal Rules\n\nof Civil Procedure only if the moving party has shown “that there is no genuine dispute as to any\n\nmaterial fact and [it] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).\n\nMoreover, “in ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment, the Court shall grant summary\n\njudgment only if one of the moving parties is entitled to judgment as a matter of law upon\n\nmaterial facts that are not genuinely disputed.” Muwekma Ohlone Tribe, 452 F. Supp. 2d at 113\n\n(citation omitted). Summary judgment “is an appropriate procedure when a court reviews an\n\nagency’s administrative record,” Shays v. FEC, 424 F. Supp. 2d 100, 109-10 (D.D.C. 2006), and,\n\nbecause this case “involves a challenge to a final administrative action, the Court’s review is\n\nlimited to the administrative record,” Fund for Animals v. Babbitt, 903 F. Supp. 96, 105 (D.D.C.\n\n1995) (citing Camp v. Pitts, 411 U.S. 138, 142 (1973)).\n\n       “The APA entitles a person suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely\n\naffected or aggrieved by agency action” to “judicial review thereof.” 5 U.S.C. § 702; Hill\n\nDermaceuticals, Inc. v. FDA, 524 F. Supp. 2d 5, 9 (D.D.C. 2007). The APA requires the\n\nreviewing court to set aside an agency action that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion,\n\nor otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). In conducting this review,\n\nconsiderable deference must generally be accorded to the agency. See Citizens to Pres. Overton\n\nPark, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 416 (1971), overruled on unrelated grounds by Califano v.\n\nSanders, 430 U.S. 99, 105 (1977). Specifically, in the context of this case, the Department has\n\n“special expertise” in determining whether petitioning Indian tribes are entitled to tribal\n\nrecognition, James, 824 F.2d at 1138, and thus, the Court must be particularly deferential to its\n\ndeterminations, Bldg. & Const. Trades Dep’t v. Brock, 838 F.2d 1258, 1266 (D.C. Cir. 1988).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 29\n\fAccordingly, “[t]here is a presumption in favor of the validity of the administrative action.”\n\nBristol–Myers Squibb Co. v. Shalala, 923 F. Supp. 212, 216 (D.D.C. 1996); see also James, 824\n\nF.2d at 1138 (“the Department [of the Interior] has been implementing its regulations for\n\n[several] years and . . . it employs experts in the fields of history, anthropology and geneology, to\n\naid in determining tribal recognition. This . . . weighs in favor of giving deference to the agency\n\nby providing it with the opportunity to apply its expertise.”).\n\n       Despite the presumption of validity and the deference that must be afforded to an\n\nagency’s actions, a reviewing court “must consider whether the [agency’s] decision was based on\n\na consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.”\n\nMarsh v. Or. Natural Res. Council, 490 U.S. 360, 378 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nAt a minimum, the agency must have considered relevant data and articulated an explanation\n\nestablishing a “rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.” Bowen v.\n\nAm. Hosp. Ass’n, 476 U.S. 610, 626 (1986) (citation omitted).\n\n       [A]n agency rule would be arbitrary and capricious if the agency has relied on\n       factors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider\n       an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that\n       runs counter to evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not\n       be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.\n\nMotor Veh. Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983); see also\n\nCnty. of Los Angeles v. Shalala, 192 F.3d 1005, 1021 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (“Where the agency has\n\nfailed to provide a reasoned explanation, or where the record belies the agency’s conclusion, [the\n\ncourt] must undo its action.”). As noted, the “requirement that agency action not be arbitrary or\n\ncapricious includes a requirement that the agency adequately explain its result.” Pub. Citizen,\n\nInc. v. FAA, 988 F.2d 186, 197 (D.C. Cir. 1993). This requirement is not particularly\n\ndemanding, however. Id. Nothing more than a “brief statement” is necessary, so long as the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 30\n\fagency explains “why it chose to do what it did.” Tourus Records, Inc. v. DEA, 259 F.3d 731,\n\n737 (D.C. Cir. 2001). Thus, if the court can “reasonably ... discern[]” the agency’s path, it will\n\nuphold the agency’s decision. Pub. Citizen, 988 F.2d at 197 (citing Bowman Transp., Inc. v.\n\nArkansas–Best Freight Sys., Inc., 419 U.S. 281, 286 (1974)).\n\n                                      III.    Legal Analysis\n\n       The overarching question to be decided by the Court on the parties’ cross-motions for\n\nsummary judgment is whether to uphold the Department’s decision to deny acknowledgment of\n\nthe Muwekma as a Native American Tribe entitled “to the protection, services, and benefits”\n\nprovided by the Federal government to such entities, as well as the “immunities and privileges\n\navailable to other federally acknowledged Indian tribes by virtue of their government-to-\n\ngovernment relationship with the United States.” 25 C.F.R. § 83.2. In addressing this question,\n\nthe Court must confront and resolve the following issues: (1) whether the Department unlawfully\n\nterminated federal recognition of the Muwekma as a Native American tribe; (2) whether the\n\nDepartment’s recognition of the Verona band in 1927 established a trust relationship, and\n\nwhether any fiduciary duties owed as a result of that relationship were breached by the\n\nDepartment; (3) whether the Department’s Final Determination was arbitrary and capricious; (4)\n\nwhether the Department violated the Muwekma’s due process rights when it denied a “right to\n\ncontinued recognition, including the associated services, protections[,] and financial benefits,”\n\nPl.’s Opp’n at 30; (5) whether the participation in the decision-making and litigation process by\n\nan attorney-advisor at the Department violated Section 554(d) of the APA; and (6) whether the\n\nDepartment violated the APA and the Equal Protection Clause by requiring the Muwekma to\n\npetition for acknowledgment of its tribal status pursuant to the Part 83 procedures, while waiving\n\n\n\n\n                                                 31\n\fthose same procedures for the Lower Lake and Ione tribes. The Court will consider each issue in\n\nturn.\n\n      A. The Muwekma’s Unlawful Termination of Tribal Status Claim\n\n         The Muwekma argues, and it does not appear to be disputed, that “Congress has the sole\n\nauthority to terminate tribes.” Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 15. Because the Muwekma was found to\n\nhave descended from a Native American tribe (the Verona band) that had been federally\n\nrecognized until at least 1927, the Muwekma asserts that the Department “had no authority to\n\nwithdraw [its] recognition in the Final Determination.” Id. at 16. The Department, on the other\n\nhand, responds that this claim is barred by the statute of limitations, and that even assuming the\n\nMuwekma has timely brought this claim, the claim is without merit because “it improperly\n\nassumes that its descent from the once recognized Pleasanton or Verona band[] automatically\n\nindicates that it is a continuously existing political entity.” Def.’s First Cross-Mot. SJ Mem. at\n\n32.\n\n         The Court agrees with the defendants that this claim is barred by the statute of limitations\n\nof 28 U.S.C. § 2401(a). Under this statute, “every civil action commenced against the United\n\nStates shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years after the right of action first\n\naccrues.” 28 U.S.C. § 2401(a). The moment at which a cause of action first accrues within the\n\nmeaning of Section 2401(a) is when “the person challenging the agency action can institute and\n\nmaintain a suit in court.” Spannaus v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 824 F.2d 52, 56 (D.C. Cir. 1987).\n\nHere, the Department asserts several dates at which the Muwekma could have pursued a cause of\n\naction against the agency: (1) in 1927, when the Muwekma contends that “the Department\n\nprovided [it with only] a fraction of the federal funding and services allocated to . . . Indian\n\ntribes, Defs.’ First SJ Mem. at 30 (quoting Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 20); (2) in 1979, when the\n\n\n\n\n                                                  32\n\fMuwekma “was not listed on the Federal Register list of entities recognized by the Secretary of\n\nInterior as a tribe,” id.; and (3) in 1989, when the Muwekma filed its petition for federal\n\nacknowledgment, id. at 31. Of these three dates, the Court finds that the most obvious point at\n\nwhich the Muwekma could have first brought suit against the agency for purportedly terminating\n\nits tribal status was in 1989, when it was clear that it was aware that it was not a federally\n\nrecognized tribe. Given that the Muwekma did not bring this action against the Department until\n\n2001, approximately twelve years after it undoubtedly possessed knowledge that it lacked\n\nacknowledgment by the federal government as a tribe, its unlawful termination of tribal status\n\nclaim is plainly barred by the limitations period of 28 U.S.C. § 2401(a).\n\n       The Court cannot accept the Muwekma’s argument that “[t]he triggering event fixing\n\nliability in this case is the [Department’s] Final Determination.” Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 19. The\n\nMuwekma conflates two distinct causes of action that an aggrieved party could, in theory, bring\n\nagainst the Department regarding tribal-acknowledgment status: one for a wrongful denial of\n\nfederal acknowledgment, and one for a wrongful termination of federal acknowledgment. The\n\nPart 83 procedures fall squarely into the former category; the purpose of such procedures is to\n\ndetermine whether a Native American entity is entitled to a status that it does not have upon\n\npetitioning the Department: “[a]cknowledgement of tribal existence.” 25 C.F.R. § 83.2. The\n\nprocedures are not a mechanism for reviewing whether a federally recognized tribe should retain\n\nits tribal status—a process that could lead to litigation falling within the latter cause of action\n\nmentioned above because the end result would be the termination of that tribe’s status.\n\nOtherwise, it would make no sense that a federally recognized tribe would voluntarily initiate a\n\nletter of intent to request acknowledgment under the Part 83 Procedures. See 25 C.F.R. § 83.4(a)\n\n(“Any Indian group in the continental United States that believes it should be acknowledged as\n\n\n\n\n                                                  33\n\fan Indian tribe . . . may submit a letter of intent.”). Thus, the point of accrual for the\n\nMuwekma’s cause of action for wrongful termination of tribal status was the moment at which it\n\nrealized the federal government no longer recognized the entity as a tribe—a point in time that\n\noccurred long before the Department’s issuance of the Final Determination.\n\n       The Muwekma’s reliance on the “continuing claim” doctrine also fails. See Pl.’s First SJ\n\nMem. at 20 n.17. The “continuing claim” doctrine “allows a plaintiff to get relief for a time-\n\nbarred act by linking it with an act that is within the limitations period,” Selan v. Kiley, 969 F.2d\n\n560, 564 (7th Cir. 1992), and here, the Muwekma argues that “the linking governmental act\n\nwould be the Final Determination itself, which relied heavily on the premise that the Muwekma .\n\n. . was not recognized externally by the Department or others in the period after 1927,” Pl.’s First\n\nSJ Mem. at 20 n.17. Such an application of the doctrine “effectively would eradicate the statute\n\nof limitations” because “lack of formal recognition is the gravamen of the plaintiff[’s] complaint,\n\nso only formal recognition could bring an end to the ‘continuing claim,’” thereby “preserving\n\n[the Muwekma’s] cause of action until it becomes moot.” Miami Nation of Indians of Indiana,\n\nInc. v. Lujan, 832 F. Supp. 253, 257 (N.D. Ind. 1993). The “continuing claim” doctrine,\n\ntherefore, has no application to the facts of this case.\n\n       Accordingly, the Court concludes that the Muwekma’s cause of action based on its claim\n\nthat the Department wrongfully terminated its tribal status is barred by the statute of limitations.\n\n   B. The Muwekma’s Arbitrary and Capricious Claim\n\n       The Muwekma argues that “the [Department’s] Final Determination was arbitrary and\n\ncapricious because it improperly . . . rejected or misconstrued substantial evidence demonstrating\n\nthat the Tribe satisfied the recognition criteria.” Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 35. With respect to the\n\nrequirement under Section 83.8(a) that the Muwekma proffer evidence that it had been identified\n\n\n\n\n                                                  34\n\fas a tribal entity by external sources on a substantially continuous basis, the Muwekma contends\n\nthat the Department arbitrarily rejected evidence that members of the organization “enrolled . . .\n\nin the California Judgment Act,” id. at 37, because “the BIA required applicants to identify their\n\ntribal affiliation in sworn and witnessed applications,” see id. at 38 (noting that the application\n\nasked “What is your degree of Indian blood and to what Tribe or Band of Indians of the State of\n\nCalifornia do you belong?”), and that “the Bureau approved these applications, including the\n\nresponse of the Muwekma . . . members who replied to this [inquiry] by referring to the Mission\n\nSan Jose,” id. The Muwekma also argues that the Department erred in “reject[ing] evidence that\n\n[its] members attended BIA boarding schools in Oregon and . . . California during the 1930[]s\n\nand 1940[]s on the ground that the record did not indicate whether these tribal members were\n\naccepted based on their degree of Indian blood or membership in a recognized tribal group,”\n\nbecause the Department may not provide special services to Indians on the account of their race.\n\nId. at 39 (citing Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, 553-54 (1974)). Lastly, the Muwekma asserts\n\nthat “[t]he Final Determination arbitrarily rejected substantial evidence of external identification\n\nby scholars, including a 1955 report . . . prepared by anthropologists Alfred L. Kroeber and R.F.\n\nHeizer,” id. at 39, as well as “references to the continuing existence of the Muwekma Ohlone\n\npeople in a book written in 1978 by Malcolm Margolin” and in a 1978 Smithsonian publication,\n\nid. at 40. In rejecting all of this evidence, the Muwekma contends the Department “appl[ied] a\n\nstandard of proof far beyond the regulatory standard” of proof, id. at 35, and that “the\n\nDepartment ignored critical historical circumstances” in its Final Determination by “fail[ing] to .\n\n. . account [for] the impact of the lack of a landbase and the particularly horrible experience of\n\nCalifornia tribes on the [Muwekma’s] ability to document its prior activities,” id. at 36.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 35\n\f       The Court finds all of the Muwekma’s arguments to be without merit. With regard to the\n\nMuwekma’s contention that its members participated in the California Claims Act, the\n\nDepartment reasonably concluded that such evidence did not constitute an external identification\n\nof the Muwekma. The Department adequately explained that applicants’ indications of some\n\nassociation to “Mission San Jose” in response to the question: “What is your degree of Indian\n\nblood and to what Tribe or Band of Indians of California do you belong?” is insufficient to\n\nconstitute an external identification of the Muwekma because that identification “referred to 19th\n\ncentury tribal ancestry, not to contemporary membership.” Pl.’s First SJ Mem., Ex. 6 (Final\n\nDetermination) at 22. The Department’s conclusion is further supported by the answers provided\n\nby two other approved applicants who answered the same question by stating “Tribal name\n\nunknown” and “Ohlones(?) Tribal name [u]nknown.” Id. As the Department noted, “an\n\nindividual’s active tribal membership would not be unknown to him or her, while his or her\n\nspecific tribal ancestry back to 1852 could be unknown.” Id. at 22-23. The Court does not find\n\nthe Department’s analysis to be wanting in logic, and thus there is no reason for the Court to\n\ndisturb the agency’s conclusions regarding this evidence.\n\n       Likewise, the Court finds the Department’s conclusion that attendance at a BIA boarding\n\nschool did not require membership in a federally recognized tribe to be supported by the record.\n\nFirst, the Court is not persuaded that the BIA’s admission of students in its boarding schools\n\nmust have been based on their tribal membership, rather than their race as Indians, because of the\n\nSupreme Court’s decision in Mancari. See Mancari, 417 U.S. at 554 (holding that the Indian\n\nReorganization Act’s employment preference for qualified Indians does not constitute invidious\n\nracial discrimination because “[t]he preference, as applied, is granted to Indians not as a discrete\n\nracial group, but, rather, as members of quasi-sovereign tribal entities whose lives and activities\n\n\n\n\n                                                 36\n\fare governed by the BIA in a unique fashion.”). Even assuming that the Court agreed with the\n\nMuwekma that, under Mancari, “the legal basis for providing special services to Indians is not\n\ntheir race but the political relationship between the tribe and the federal government,” Pl.’s First\n\nSJ Mem. at 39., the Mancari decision was issued in 1974, decades after the Muwekma’s\n\nmembers attended these boarding schools, see id. (discussing evidence of attendance at BIA\n\nboarding schools “during the 1930[]s and 1940[]s”). The Court cannot logically conclude that\n\nthe Mancari decision has any relevance to the BIA’s earlier student admissions policies for its\n\nschools; such illogical reasoning is no more convincing than the premise that segregation did not\n\nexist in the 1940s because the Supreme Court later held the practice unconstitutional in Brown v.\n\nBoard of Education of Topeka, 349 U.S. 294 (1955). Thus, Mancari can have no sway on the\n\nCourt’s analysis of the Department’s position concerning earlier BIA boarding school\n\nattendance.\n\n       Second, the Department closely analyzed one of the boarding school student’s\n\napplications, which it noted did not include “information on tribal membership and . . . tribal\n\ncertification or endorsement.” Pl.’s First SJ Mem., Ex. 6 (Final Determination) at 31. The\n\nDepartment noted that the applicant had identified his tribe as “Mission,” and that such a\n\nreference was merely a “generic” one that “applies to many separate Indian groups,” and not the\n\nMuwekma specifically. Id. This conclusion is consistent with the Department’s observation that\n\nvarious “Ohlone” Indians “were concentrated by the Spaniards before 1834 at the Mission San\n\nJose,” id., Ex. 7 (Proposed Finding – Summary) at 10, and that several other Native American\n\nentities have claimed descent from those Indians residing at the Mission San Jose, see id., Ex. 7\n\n(Proposed Finding) at 9 (noting that the existence of other “Ohlone” applicants demonstrates that\n\n“the Muwekma . . . does not have an uncontested claim to represent the descendants of all the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 37\n\fOhlone of the San Francisco Bay Area or all the territory of the Costanoan-speaking peoples”).\n\nThe Department’s conclusion is further buttressed by a 1944 letter which stated: “There is no\n\ndoubt but what these children have sufficient Indian blood to admit them to a Government\n\nBoarding School.” Id., Ex. 6 (Final Determination) at 31. This evidence, when viewed\n\ncollectively, plainly supports the Department’s conclusion that evidence of attendance at BIA\n\nboarding schools does not reasonably demonstrate identification of the Muwekma by an external\n\nsource.\n\n          Third, the Court does not find any error in the Department’s rejection of the Muwekma’s\n\nscholarly evidence. According to the Department, the author of the Smithsonian article merely\n\n“described the Costanoan language family and concluded that the aboriginal Costanoan were\n\nneither a single ethnic group nor a political entity.” Id., Ex. 7 (Proposed Finding) at 76 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). With regard to Kroeber and Heizer’s 1955 paper, the Department\n\nfound the authors to be arguing “that even though Indian cultures had become extinct, Indian\n\npopulations had not.” Id., Ex. 6 (Final Determination) at 33. This proposition, the Department\n\nfound, “was a statement about the survival of individual descendants, rather than Indian groups.”\n\nId. Accordingly, “[b]ecause [Kroeber and Heizer] referred to surviving descendants rather than\n\ngroups, they did not identify an Indian entity in either [the 1930s or 1950s].” Id. As for the 1978\n\nMargolin book, the Department acknowledged that “[i]n general, the book is an analysis of an\n\nOhlone lifestyle prior to European settlement,” which it found “is not relevant to an analysis of\n\nthe [Muwekma] since 1927.” Id., Ex. 6 (Final Determination) at 44. Moreover, the Department\n\nfound that “[w]hile Margolin acknowledged the existence of living Ohlone individuals [when his\n\nresearch was conducted, he] did not identify” any Indian entity in 1978. Id. There is nothing in\n\n\n\n\n                                                 38\n\fthese findings from which the Court can conclude that the Department erred in rejecting this\n\nevidence as external identifications of the Muwekma.\n\n         Lastly, the Court is not persuaded that the Department misapplied 25 C.F.R. § 83.6.\n\nNone of the evidence proffered by the Muwekma establishes a “reasonable likelihood” that\n\nexternal sources had identified it as a Native American tribe; simply because the Muwekma\n\nbelieves that its evidence is persuasive does not mean it is so. As the Department sufficiently\n\nexplained in its Proposed Finding and Final Determination, the evidence proffered by the\n\nMuwekma and discussed above has no bearing on the issue of whether external sources\n\nidentified it as a Native American tribe. Moreover, the Court does not discern how it could find\n\nthat the Department failed to consider the Muwekma’s “historical circumstances” in assessing its\n\napplication for federal acknowledgment. See Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 36. Indeed, the Muwekma\n\ndoes not explain how “the particularly horrible experience of California tribes,” id., would have\n\naffected its ability to retain documentation of its existence after 1927. 12 Thus, the Court finds\n\nthis argument to be without merit.\n\n         For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the agency’s Final Determination was not\n\narbitrary and capricious and must therefore be upheld.\n\n     C. The Muwekma’s Breach of Fiduciary Duty Claim\n\n         Next, the Muwekma argues that the Department’s recognition of the Verona band in 1927\n\nestablished a trust relationship, that the Department owed the Muwekma fiduciary duties as a\n\nresult of that relationship, and that these duties were breached by the Department. Pl.’s First\n\nMem. at 18. Specifically, the Muwekma argues that “[o]nce the Department recognized [it in\n\n12\n  Indeed, the “horrible” experiences alleged by the Muwekma took place several decades before 1927, the point at\nwhich it was required to produce evidence of its continuing tribal existence. See Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 2 (“During\nthe late nineteenth century, non-Indians were particularly hostile to tribes, seeking out and killing Indians outright,\noften encouraged by local governments.” (emphasis added)).\n\n\n\n                                                           39\n\f1927] . . . as a tribe under its care and supervision, it had a duty to support and preserve the\n\nTribe,” and that the Department “lacked authority . . . to resign from or terminate the trust.” Id.\n\nat 19. Furthermore, the Muwekma argues that even assuming the Department possessed the\n\nauthority “to unilaterally withdraw from the . . . trust relationship . . . , it failed to do so in\n\naccordance with basic principles of fairness and trust responsibility.” Id. at 20.\n\n        The Court is not persuaded by the Muwekma’s position. Even if a trust relationship was\n\ncreated as a result of the federal government’s recognition of the Verona band, the Muwekma’s\n\nargument assumes that it was the Department that withdrew from that relationship. After all, as\n\nJudge Posner noted in Miami Nation of Indians of Indiana, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of the Interior, 255\n\nF.3d 342, 346 (7th Cir. 2001), “[i]t is . . . obvious that Indian nations, like foreign nations, can\n\ndisappear over time . . . whether through conquest, or voluntary absorption into a larger entity, or\n\nfission, or dissolution, or movement of population.” Should a tribe cease to exist, it follows that\n\nthe federal government would no longer have a trust relationship with that entity. See id. at 350\n\n(“If a nation doesn’t exist, it can’t be recognized”). The Muwekma thus needs to demonstrate it\n\ndid not cease to exist after 1927, and the manner in which the Muwekma is required to prove its\n\nexistence as a tribe is through the Part 83 procedures. See 25 C.F.R. § 83.2 (“The purpose of . . .\n\n[P]art [83] is to establish a departmental procedure and policy for acknowledging that certain\n\nAmerican Indian groups exist as tribes.”). And, because the Court finds that the Department’s\n\ndecision to deny acknowledgment of the Muwekma as a Native American tribe was a legally\n\ndefensible position, the Court also finds that the Department did not owe the Muwekma any\n\nfiduciary duties after 1927, and that any purported breach asserted by the Muwekma after this\n\ndate is without merit.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    40\n\f     D. The Due Process Claim\n\n        The Muwekma argues that “[t]he Department’s application of 25 C.F.R. [§] 83 failed to\n\nafford [it] due process for the withdrawal of recognition.” Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 31.\n\nSpecifically, the Muwekma asserts that “[t]he right to continued recognition, including the\n\nassociated services, protections[,] and financial benefits, once the right has been established, is a\n\nproperty right that cannot be revoked without due process.” Id. at 30. The Muwekma argues\n\nthat “[t]he hallmarks of procedural due process—notice, opportunity to be heard, and an\n\nimpartial decision[]maker—were entirely lacking in the Department’s procedures,” and while the\n\nMuwekma acknowledges being consulted in the decision by the Department’s staff, the\n\nDepartment did not provide it a formal hearing. Id. at 32. Furthermore, the Muwekma\n\ncomplains that it was not afforded an “opportunity to cross-examine the staff professionals who\n\ndeveloped and interpreted [the] evidence against [it].” Id. The Court finds this claim meritless. 13\n\n        The Muwekma’s due process claim cannot be maintained due to the Muwekma’s failure\n\nto demonstrate that it possessed a property right in its prior acknowledgment. As noted above,\n\nthe Seventh Circuit has recognized that “[i]t is . . . obvious that Indian nations, like foreign\n\nnations, can disappear over time . . . whether through conquest, or voluntary absorption into a\n\nlarger entity, or fission, or dissolution, or movement of population.” Miami Nation, 255 F.3d at\n\n346. Whether the Verona band continued to exist as an entity after 1927 and whether the\n\nMuwekma’s property right in federal acknowledgment ceased to exist along with the entity itself\n\nat the moment of dissolution are both questions the Department had to address. And it was the\n\nMuwekma’s burden to establish that, in fact, it continued to exist as a tribe after 1927 through\n\n13\n  Given that this claim is based on the purported “withdrawal of recognition” by the Department, it appears to the\nCourt that this claim is seemingly also barred by the statute of limitations. See supra at 34. The Department,\nhowever, does not argue anywhere in its submissions that the Muwekma’s due process claim is barred by the statute\nof limitations, and thus the Court will not make that determination.\n\n\n\n                                                       41\n\fthe Part 83 procedures. See id.; Koerpel v. Heckler, 797 F.2d 858, 863-65 (10th Cir. 1986)\n\n(holding that the plaintiff bears the burden of proving the existence of a constitutionally\n\nprotected property interest). Having failed to meet this burden, the Muwekma has failed to\n\nestablish that the Department violated the Due Process Clause in issuing its Final Determination.\n\n   E. The Muwekma’s Conflict-of-Interest Claim\n\n       The Muwekma argues that the Department violated 5 U.S.C. § 554(d) by allowing “one\n\nof its attorney[-]advisors” to advise the Department concerning its “decision on the merits of\n\nMuwekma’s petition for recognition,” and to also allow the same attorney-advisor to “represent[]\n\nthe Department in the Muwekma v. Babbitt litigation” that took place before Judge Urbina. Pl.’s\n\nFirst Mem. at 33. This argument rests on a misinterpretation of the APA. The various\n\nsubparagraphs of Section 554 apply only to “every case of adjudication required by statute to be\n\ndetermined on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing.” 5 U.S.C. § 554(d). Here, the\n\nMuwekma does not cite, nor is the Court aware of, a statute that requires the Department to\n\nprovide a hearing to an applicant seeking acknowledgment as a Native American tribe. Thus,\n\nSection 554(d) has no application to this case.\n\n   F. The Muwekma’s Equal Protection Claim\n\n       Finally, the Muwekma argues that the Department “violated [the E]qual [P]rotection\n\n[Clause] and the APA by restoring two similarly situated California tribes based on a lower\n\nevidentiary standard while denying” the Muwekma the opportunity to seek recognition under the\n\nsame standard. Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 21-22. Both the Equal Protection Clause and the APA\n\nprohibit agencies from treating similarly situated petitioners differently without providing a\n\nsufficiently reasoned justification for the disparate treatment. See, e.g., Settles v. U.S. Parole\n\nComm’n, 429 F.3d 1098, 1102-03 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (“To prevail on [an] equal protection claim,\n\n\n\n\n                                                  42\n\f[a plaintiff must] demonstrate that [it] was treated differently than similarly situated individuals\n\n[or entities] and that the [agency’s] explanation does not satisfy the relevant level of scrutiny.”\n\n(citing Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 216 (1982)); Cnty. of Los Angeles v. Shalala, 192 F.3d\n\n1005, 1022 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (holding that “an agency action is arbitrary when the agency offers\n\ninsufficient reasons for treating similar situations differently” (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitations omitted)); Freeman Eng’g Assocs. v.

Cir. 1994)\n\n(stating that the District of Columbia Circuit has “long held that an agency must provide [an]\n\nadequate explanation before it treats similarly situated parties differently” (citations omitted)).\n\nTo the Court’s knowledge, the District of Columbia Circuit has not explicitly defined what\n\nconstitutes “similarly situated,” but at least one other circuit has defined that term to mean that\n\nthe two classes being compared are “prima facie identical in all relevant respects, or directly\n\ncomparable . . . in all material respects.” Racine Charter One, Inc. v. Racine Unified Sch. Dist.,\n\n424 F.3d 677, 680 (7th Cir. 2005) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).\n\n       In addressing the Muwekma’s equal protection claim, the Court must first address an\n\nobservation made in its September 30, 2008 Order, wherein the Court construed the September\n\n21, 2006 Memorandum Opinion as having “implicitly[,] if not explicitly, [concluded] that the\n\n[Muwekma] is similarly situated to Ione and Lower Lake.” September 30, 2008 Order, at 8,\n\nMuwekma v. Babbitt, No. 03-cv-1231 (RBW) (D.D.C.). As noted above, the Department\n\nrepresents that it “did not understand the Court’s Order of September 21, 2006, to have held that\n\n[the Muwekma] was similarly situated to Ione and Lower Lake in that the Court concluded that .\n\n. . ‘it lacks sufficient information about the Department’s decision to recognize Ione and Lower\n\n\n\n\n                                                 43\n\fLake outside of the Part 83 process.” Defs.’ Supp. Mem. at 16 (quoting Muwekma, 452 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 113). The Muwekma, for its part, expressed its agreement with the Court’s Order that the\n\nDepartment “was . . . bound to follow the mandate of this Court and limit the scope of its remand\n\nto the Memorandum Opinion’s order of an ‘express justification’ and a ‘detailed explanation of\n\nthe reasons’ for requiring Muwekma to proceed through the lengthy federal acknowledgment\n\nprocess while exempting” the Lower Lake and Ione. Pl.’s Supp. Opp’n at 6.\n\n       Upon further reflection, the Court acknowledges that its September 30, 2008 Order\n\nincorrectly represented the ruling in its September 21, 2006 Memorandum Opinion. As the\n\nDepartment correctly observed, Defs.’ Supp. Mem. at 1, the Court did not decide the question of\n\nwhether the Muwekma was “similarly situated” to the Lower Lake and Ione, see Muwekma, 452\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 116 (noting that the relevant inquiry before the Court was “whether the\n\nDepartment has provided a rational basis for requiring [the p]laintiff to adhere to the Part 83\n\nprocedure while exempting other tribes that are purportedly similarly situated” (emphasis\n\nadded)). Indeed, “the Court’s review [was] limited to the administrative record,” Fund for\n\nAnimals, 903 F. Supp. at 105 (citing Camp, 411 U.S. at 142), and, as the Court noted numerous\n\ntimes in the September 21, 2006 Memorandum Opinion, the record did not reveal any\n\nconsideration by the Department of whether the Muwekma was entitled to the same waiver of\n\nthe Part 83 procedures that was granted to both the Lower Lake and the Ione, see Muwekma, 452\n\nF. Supp. at 113 (concluding that the Court “lack[ed] sufficient information about the\n\nDepartment’s decision to recognize Ione and Lower Lake outside of the Part 83 process to\n\nresolve [the p]laintiff’s equal protection and APA claims”); id. at 119 (“[T]he [Department has]\n\ncited nothing to explain the basis for the Department’s decision to treat Muwekma differently\n\nfrom Ione and Lower Lake.”); id. at 120 (“[T]he administrative record contains no indication\n\n\n\n\n                                                44\n\fwhy the Department would refuse to consider Muwekma’s requests for administrative correction\n\nwhile allowing Ione and Lowe Lake to proceed outside the Part 83 process.”). Without running\n\nafoul of well-settled law circumscribing this Court’s review of the Department’s Final\n\nDetermination, the Court could not have decided the question of whether the Muwekma, Lower\n\nLake, and Ione were “similarly situated.” Thus, contrary to the Court’s observations in the\n\nSeptember 30, 2008 Order, the Department was instructed on remand to address whether the\n\nseveral tribes were similarly situated, and it necessarily could make that assessment only by\n\nreviewing the record evidence.\n\n        Consequently, the Court must review the Department’s supplement to the administrative\n\nrecord to determine whether the agency provided an adequate explanation “why it chose to do\n\nwhat it did,” Tourus Records, Inc. v. DEA, 259 F.3d 731, 737 (D.C. Cir. 2001)—to wit, denying\n\nthe Muwekma a waiver to obtain federal acknowledgment without proceeding through the Part\n\n83 process. And, the Court now finds the Department’s explanation sufficient. The Department\n\nexplained that the record reflects a “pattern of federal dealings with the Lower Lake and Ione\n\nwhich evidences their long-standing and continuing governmental relationship with the United\n\nStates,” whereas, the Muwekma had no such interactions with the Federal Government. 14 Defs.’\n\nSecond SJ Mem at 8.\n\n        With regard to the Lower Lake, the Department noted that “[t]he Federal Government\n\npurchased land to establish the Lower Lake Rancheria on January 25, 1916,” and that “[t]he\n\n[G]overnment held this land in trust until the Act of 1956 authorized its sale.” Id. The\n\n\n\n14\n  The Department also argues that the Muwekma is not similarly situated to the Lower Lake and the Ione because it\n“lacks collective rights in lands.” Defs.’ Second SJ Mem. at 13. The Court need not assess the merits of this\ncontention, however, because it finds that the Muwekma’s lack of interactions as an entity with the federal\ngovernment is sufficient to support the Department’s conclusion that the Muwekma is not similarly situated to the\nLower Lake and Ione tribes.\n\n\n\n                                                       45\n\fDepartment also cited other instances demonstrating communications and dealings between the\n\nfederal government and the Lower Lake. See id. (citing various reports that contained a\n\n“recommend[ation] that land be purchased for the Lower Lake band,” a recommendation “to\n\nacquire additional land for the band and other small groups,” and an observation noting “the\n\nexistence of a Lower Lake group living off the rancheria”). The Department also noted that the\n\nLower Lake had been identified by the federal government on two separate instances—in 1953,\n\nwhen the United States “House of Representatives listed the Lower Lake Rancheria” in House\n\nReport 2503, and in 1980, when “the BIA central office and regional office considered including\n\nthe Lower Lake Rancheria on the list of federally recognized tribes, but did not do so.” Id.\n\nBased on these interactions with the federal government and the earlier references to it as an\n\nentity, the Court has no basis for finding that the Department’s conclusion that the “Lower Lake\n\nand Muwekma were not similarly situated,” id. at 6, is arbitrary and capricious.\n\n        Likewise, the supplement to the administrative record also identifies a history of dealings\n\nbetween the federal government and the Ione. In 1915, a special agent for the BIA identified the\n\nIone in a census conducted by the agency, and that “[t]he [f]ederal [g]overnment attempted to\n\npurchase land for” the Ione at that time. Id. at 7. The Department then noted that “the Indian\n\nOffice obtained a deed and abstract of title for the purchase of land for the Ione[,] . . . and the\n\nDepartment provided the Office with a formal “Authority” for the purchase. Id. Documents in\n\nthe record also reflect the federal government’s “extensive, but unsuccessful, effort[] to clear title\n\nto the land for the” Ione from 1915-1925. Id. The record further reveals efforts made by the\n\nIone to inquire as to the status of its tribal lands. See id. at 7-8 (noting that “[i]n 1941, the\n\nDepartment considered a petition from the ‘Indians of the Ione Valley’ requesting the purchase\n\nof land,” and that “[i]n 1970, two Ione individuals contacted the BIA about the status of the land\n\n\n\n\n                                                   46\n\fon which they lived,” and subsequently “the California Rural Indian Land Project . . . of the\n\nCalifornia Indian Legal Services proposed bringing a quiet[-]title action on behalf of the Ione\n\nBand . . . and requesting that the land be accepted and held in trust”). The Court finds these\n\nfacts, which the Department found to have evidenced a “historical circumstance of an\n\nuncompleted acquisition of trust land on the [Ione’s] behalf,” sufficient to differentiate the Ione\n\nfrom the Muwekma.\n\n       The Muwekma argues, however, that there is actually no longstanding pattern of federal\n\ndealings between the federal government and the Ione and the Lower Lake because the record\n\nreflects “large periods of time in which [the Department] had no relationship with Ione or Lower\n\nLake.” Pl.’s Reply to Second SJ Mem. at 7. The Muwekma’s argument misses the point.\n\nUnlike the evidence proffered by the Muwekma, which at best demonstrated interactions\n\nbetween the federal government and individuals that descended from the Verona band, the\n\nevidence in the supplemental administrative record reflects dealings between the federal\n\ngovernment and the Ione and Lower Lake tribes as entities. The Department viewed its\n\ninteractions with the Ione and Lower Lake tribes as evidence that the federal government dealt\n\nwith these entities as tribes, and thus concluded that it was appropriate to acknowledge these\n\ntribes outside of the Part 83 process. Thus, the Department’s conclusion that the Muwekma was\n\nnot “similarly situated” to the Ione and Lower Lake must be upheld.\n\n                                        IV.     Conclusion\n\n       Despite the Muwekma’s efforts to raise a smorgasbord of claims in an attempt to reverse\n\nthe Department’s Final Determination, the Court finds that there exists no basis upon which it\n\nmay overturn the agency’s findings. Accordingly, the Court must grant the Department’s cross-\n\nmotion for summary judgment, and deny the Muwekma’s motion for summary judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 47\n\f        SO ORDERED this 28th day of September, 2011. 15\n\n\n                                                                   REGGIE B.

After the Department supplemented the agency record with regard to the waiver issue, a\nsecond round of summary judgment briefing commenced on February 16, 2007. In these second summary judgment\nbriefs, the parties focused on the question to be answered on remand by the Department, but they also renewed their\nother arguments on the remaining claims.

The Court, therefore, will consider the\narguments presented in both the first and second round of summary judgment briefing in assessing the merits of the\nplaintiff’s claims under the APA and the Constitution.\n\nAccordingly, the Court considered the following submissions in reaching its decision: (1) the plaintiff’s Complaint\n(“Compl.”); (2) the defendants’ Answer; (3) the Points and Authorities in Support of Plaintiff’s Motion for\nSummary Judgment (“Pl.’s First SJ Mem.”); (4) the defendants’ first Memorandum in Support of Defendants’\nCross-Motion for Summary Judgment and Response in Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment\n(“Defs.’ First SJ Mem.”); (5) the Reply Brief in Support of Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment and Opposing\nDefendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment (“Pl.’s First SJ Opp’n”); (6) the Reply Memorandum in Support of\nDefendants’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (“Defs.’ First SJ Reply”); (7) the Plaintiff’s Notice of\nSupplemental Authority (“Pl.’s Supp. Not.”); (8) the Defendants’ Response to Plaintiff’s Filing of Supplemental\nAuthority (“Defs.’ Resp. to Supp. Not.”); (9) the Plaintiff’s Second Notice of Supplemental Authority (“Pl.’s Second\nSupp. Not.”); (10) the Defendants’ Response to Plaintiff’s Second Notice of Supplemental Authority (“Defs.’ Resp.\nto Second Supp. Not.”); (11) the Plaintiff’s Reply in Support of Second Notice of Supplemental Authority (“Pl.’s\nReply to Second Resp.”); (12) the Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Plaintiff’s Motion for\nSummary Judgment (“Pl.’s Second SJ Mem.”); (13) the Defendants’ second Memorandum in Support of\nDefendants’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment and Response in Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary\nJudgment (“Defs.’ Second SJ Mem.”); (14) the Reply Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of\nPlaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment and in Opposition to Defendants’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment\n(“Pl.’s Second SJ Opp’n”); (15) the Defendants’ Reply in Support of Defendants’ Cross-Motion for Summary\nJudgment (“Defs.’ Second SJ Reply”); (16) the Defendants’ Supplemental Memoranda (“Defs.’ Supp. Mem.”); and\n(17) the Plaintiff’s Opposition to Defendants’ Supplemental Memorandum on Issues Set Forth in the Court’s\nSeptember 30, 2008 Order (“Defs.’ Supp. Opp’n”).\n\n\n\n                                                         2\n\fprotection, services, and benefits” provided by the Federal government to Indian tribes, as well\n\nas the “immunities and privileges available to other federally acknowledged Indian tribes by\n\nvirtue of their government-to-government relationship with the United States.” 25 C.F.R. § 83.2.\n\nPursuant to statutorily delegated authority, the Department is empowered with the authority to\n\ndetermine which currently unrecognized Native American groups meet the criteria for federal\n\nrecognition. 25 U.S.C. §§ 2, 9 (2006); see also James v.

Under these\n\nregulations, there are three avenues available to an Indian entity seeking recognition as a tribe by\n\nthe federal government. The principal means for an American Indian entity to be recognized as a\n\ntribe is under 25 C.F.R. § 83.7, which sets forth seven “mandatory criteria” for tribal recognition.\n\n25 C.F.R. § 83.7. The Part 83 criteria are the following:\n\n       (a) The petitioner has been identified as an American Indian entity on a substantially\n           continuous basis since 1900. . . .\n\n       (b) A predominant portion of the petitioning group comprises a distinct community and\n           has existed as a community from historical times until the present. . . .\n\n       (c) The petitioner has maintained political influence or authority over its members as an\n           autonomous entity from historical times until the present. . . .\n\n       (d) A copy of the group’s present governing document including its membership criteria.\n           ...\n\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f         (e) The petitioner’s membership consists of individuals who descend from a historical\n             Indian tribe or from historical Indian tribes which combined and functioned as a\n             single autonomous political entity. . . .\n\n         (f) The membership of the petitioning group is composed principally of persons who are\n             not members of any acknowledged North American Indian tribe. . . .\n\n         (g) Neither the petitioner nor its members are the subject of congressional legislation that\n             has expressly terminated or forbidden the [f]ederal relationship.\n\nId. The second means of attaining acknowledgment is through the “modified” Part 83 process,\n\nwhich is available to those entities that had been previously (but are not currently) acknowledged\n\nby the federal government as a Native American tribe. 25 C.F.R. § 83.8(a). Under the modified\n\ncriteria, petitioning Native American entities that can provide substantial evidence of\n\n“[u]nambiguous previous [f]ederal acknowledgment,” id., need only provide the following\n\nshowing as to the first three Part 83 criteria: (1) that it had been identified as an American Indian\n\nentity on a substantially continuous basis “since the point of [its] last [f]ederal acknowledgment,”\n\n25 C.F.R. § 83.8(d)(1); (2) that “it comprises a distinct community at present,” 25 C.F.R. §\n\n83.8(d)(2); and (3) that “political influence or authority is exercised within the group . . . from\n\nthe point of [its] last [f]ederal acknowledgment to the present,” 25 C.F.R. § 83.8(d)(3). Finally,\n\nthe last option for federal acknowledgment available to a Native American group is to seek a\n\nwaiver of the Part 83 requirements, which the Secretary has the authority to grant if waiver of the\n\nrequirements would be \"in the best interests of the Indians.\" 3 25 C.F.R. § 1.2.\n\n         A petitioner, however, is not required to provide conclusive evidence under each of the\n\nPart 83 criteria; rather, a “criterion shall be considered met if the available evidence establishes a\n\nreasonable likelihood of the validity of the facts relating to that criterion.” Id. Furthermore, the\n\nDepartment, in evaluating a petition, is required to “take into account historical situations and\n\n3\n  As discussed below, there have been at least two recent instances in which the Secretary has waived the Part 83\nrequirements and granted federal acknowledgment to those entities.

The name “Ohlone” is an alternative to\n\n“Costanoan,” which was a label given to “[t]he Indians along the Pacific coast near San\n\nFrancisco Bay,” and “who were concentrated by the Spaniards before 1834 at the Mission San\n\nJose.” Pl.’s First SJ Mem., Exhibit (\"Ex.\") 7 (Proposed Finding) at 10. 5 The plaintiff asserts that\n\nits members descended from these Indians, id., although nine other Indian groups that submitted\n\npetitions to the Department also “use[d] the Ohlone or Costanoan tribal name,” which, according\n\nto the Department, suggests that “the Muwekma . . . does not have an uncontested claim to\n\nrepresent the descendants of all the Ohlone of the San Francisco Bay Area or all the territory of\n\nthe Costanoan-speaking peoples,” id. at 9.\n\n\n\n\n4\n  As discussed below, the Court ultimately concludes that the Muwekma failed to provide sufficient evidence to the\nDepartment that it “has been identified as an American Indian entity on a substantially continuous basis since” 1927,\nwhen the Verona band was last recognized by the federal government. 25 C.F.R. § 83.7(a); see also 25 C.F.R. §\n83.8(d)(1) (requiring petitioners with previous federal acknowledgment to demonstrate that “[t]he group meets the\nrequirements of . . . [Section] 83.7(a), except that such identification shall be demonstrated since the point of last\nFederal acknowledgment”). Because the Muwekma’s failure to meet the requirements of Section 83.7(a) was a\nsufficient basis for the Department to deny federal recognition to the group, see 25. C.F.R. § 83.6(d), the remainder\nof this background section, as well as the Court’s analysis of the Muwekma’s claims, will focus only on the facts\nrelevant to the Department’s Section 83.7(a) analysis.\n5\n  When providing a pincite for either the Department's Proposed Finding or Final Determination, the Court will\nutilize the administrative-record page number, rather than the number affixed by the Department in creating the\nreport.\n\n\n\n                                                          5\n\f       Nonetheless, the evidence in the administrative record does reflect that many of the\n\nMuwekma descended from Indians who resided near the Mission San Jose. Id. at 10.\n\nSpecifically, there were two settlements located “in the area north of [the] historical Mission San\n\nJose and east of San Francisco Bay, an area referred to today as the “‘East Bay.’” Id. “The most\n\nprominent of these settlements was located in a canyon just southwest of the town of Pleasanton,\n\nCalifornia, and near a railroad station named Verona.” Id.. The settlement came to be “known\n\nas the Alisal or Pleasanton rancheria, and its members were referred to by [United States] Indian\n\nagents as the Verona band.” Id. The “second settlement, known as El Molino, was located near\n\nthe town of Niles, which was within ten miles of Verona.” Id. These “two Indian settlements, or\n\nRancherias, . . . existed until the 1910[]s in Alameda County.” Id.\n\n       In 1906, the Department appointed C.E. Kelsey to conduct a census of landless Indians\n\nresiding on the Alisal and Niles settlements, id. at 67, in connection with the Act of June 21,\n\n1906, which, inter alia, appropriated funds for the purchase of land for Indians who were not\n\nthen residing on reservations, Compl. ¶ 14. Kelsey ultimately prepared a documented titled\n\n“Schedule [S]howing [N]on-[R]eservation Indians in Northern California,” which noted that\n\nthere were 29 individuals residing at the Pleasanton rancheria, and 14 individuals residing at the\n\nNiles Rancheria. Pl.’s First SJ Mem., Ex. 7 (Proposed Finding) at 67. In addition to the Kelsey\n\ncensus, the federal census conducted for Alameda County in 1910 “included a special Indian\n\npopulation schedule which enumerated 17 Indian residents of ‘Indian town,’ which appears to\n\nhave been the Pleasanton rancheria.” Id. at 10. According to the Department’s findings,\n\napproximately “48 percent of the [Muwekma’s] members descend directly from an Indian . . . on\n\neither the 1905-1906 Kelsey census of Pleasanton or Niles, or the 1910 Federal census of ‘Indian\n\ntown.’” Id. Within that 48 percent, “[a]bout 70 percent of the [Muwekma’s] members\n\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fdescend[ed] from an Indian woman, Avelina (Cornates) Marine . . . , who, according to\n\nrecollections of her son in the 1960[]s, may have been raised in the household of the chief of one\n\nof those Indian Rancherias before the 1880[]s.” Id. Furthermore, “[t]wo of Marine’s children\n\nwere listed on the 1910 census,” although “Marine’s other children . . . were not listed on [that]\n\ncensus.” Id. It is from those unlisted children from whom “[t]he majority of the [Muwekma’s]\n\nmembers descend.” Id. Accordingly, “[a]ll of the [Muwekma’s] members descend either from\n\nan Indian individual listed on the 1905-1906 Kelsey census,” an Indian individual listed on the\n\n1910 census, “or from an unlisted Marine sibling of an individual on these lists.” Id.\n\n       The Department acknowledges that the Verona band was previously recognized by the\n\nfederal government as an Indian tribe. Id. at 8. This prior recognition was based on evidence\n\nthat “[t]he band was among the groups . . . under the jurisdiction of the Indian agency at\n\nSacramento, California,” and that “[t]he agency dealt with the Verona [b]and as a group and\n\nidentified it as a distinct social and political entity.” Pl.’s First SJ Mem., Ex. 47 (May 24, 1996\n\nLetter from Department of Interior to Rosemary Cambra) at 1. Specifically, the Department\n\nfound that in 1914, an agent of the Office of the Indian Affairs, C.H. Asbury, mentioned a\n\n“Verona band in Alameda County” as a “potential beneficiary of the” land-purchase program\n\ncreated by the Act of June 21, 1906. Pl.’s First SJ Mem., Ex. 7 (Proposed Finding) at 12. The\n\nSacramento Agency also mentioned the possibility of purchasing land for the Verona band in\n\n1923. Id. According to the Department, “[h]owever, no land was purchased for the group[,] and\n\nno negotiations to buy land on its behalf are known to have taken place.” Id. And, “[i]n 1927,\n\nSuperintendent L.A. Dorrington referred to the [Verona] band but concluded that land should not\n\nbe purchased on its behalf.” Id. Despite these references to the Verona band, the Department\n\nasserts that it is not aware of any “census of the members of the Verona band during the years\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fbetween 1914 and 1927.” Id. Nonetheless, the Department acknowledges that the Verona band\n\nhad been previously recognized by the federal government from Asbury’s identification of the\n\nBand in 1914 to Dorrington’s recommendation that the government not purchase land for the\n\nBand in 1927, id. at 8, and that neither Congress nor any executive agency ever formally\n\nwithdrew federal recognition of this group, Answer at 14.\n\n       In early 1989, the Muwekma submitted to the Department a letter of intent to petition for\n\nfederal acknowledgment as an Indian tribe. Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 11; Defs.’ First SJ Mem. at 4.\n\nIn its response, the Department directed the Muwekma to file a formal petition for\n\nacknowledgment along with detailed documentation in accordance with the Part 83 criteria. Pl.’s\n\nFirst SJ Mem., Ex. 46 (April 25, 1989 letter from Joseph Little to Rosemary Cambra) at 1\n\n(cautioning Muwekma that “[b]ecause of the significance and permanence of acknowledgment\n\nas a tribe, the process of evaluation is a lengthy and thorough one”). The Muwekma then\n\nsubmitted a formal petition for acknowledgment in early 1995, as well as “thousands of pages”\n\nof supplemental material, Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 11, which included “primary and secondary\n\nsource documents, genealogical evidence, arguments by its researchers, and responses to\n\nquestions posed by the Department’s staff,” Defs.’ First SJ Mem. at 5. After reviewing the\n\nMuwekma’s petition and the accompanying materials, the Department concluded preliminarily\n\nin May 1996 “that the Pleasanton or Verona Band of Alameda County[, from which members of\n\nthe Muwekma tribe are directly descended,] was previously acknowledged by the federal\n\ngovernment between 1914 and 1927.” Defs.’ First SJ Mem. at 5; see also Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at\n\n11. The Department thus informed Muwekma “that it would be able to complete its petition\n\ndocumentation with the expectation that it would be evaluated under the federal acknowledgment\n\nregulations’ modified criteria set out in § 83.8.” Defs.’ First SJ Mem. at 5.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\fC.       The Muwekma’s Petition for Acknowledgment\n\n         In its petition, the Muwekma asserts that the Verona band continued to exist as a tribal\n\nentity after 1928. 6 See Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 5 (asserting that “Congress . . . never enacted\n\nlegislation terminating the trust relationship with the . . . Verona Band,” and that the Band did\n\n“not voluntarily abandon[] tribal relations.”). For instance, the Muwekma presented evidence of\n\na genealogical connection between the members of the Muwekma and “24 persons listed by the”\n\nBureau of Indian Affairs (“BIA”) 7 on a census of California Indians issued in 1933,” Pl.’s First\n\nSJ Mem., Ex. 7 (Proposed Finding) at 12, and that its members had been listed on the judgment\n\nroll “on three separate occasions[:] in 1933, 1955[,] and 1970,” Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 6. This list\n\nof Indians “was produced as a result of an act passed by Congress in 1928 [that] gave the Court\n\nof Claims jurisdiction to hear claims against the United States on behalf of the ‘Indians of\n\nCalifornia’ for compensation for aboriginal territory acquired by the [federal g]overnment.” Pl.’s\n\nFirst SJ Mem., Ex. 7 (Proposed Finding) at 12. Specifically, the Act provided compensation to\n\nthose claimants who were “Indians . . . residing in the State of California on June 1, 1852[, as\n\nwell as] their descendants [who were] living in [the] State.” Id., Ex. 6 (Final Determination) at\n\n22.\n\n         According to the Muwekma, “eligibility for the [judgment] roll depended on the\n\napplicant’s ability to demonstrate affiliation with[,] and descent from[,] a tribe that had retained\n\n\n6\n  The Muwekma presented numerous items of evidence in support of its position that it had been recognized by\nexternal sources as an Indian entity between 1927 and 1985, but the Department ultimately concluded that the\nevidence only reflected identification by external sources from 1965 to 1971, and from 1982 to the present. See id.,\nEx. 6 (Final Determination) at 47. The Court, therefore, will limit its discussion to only those items of evidence that\nthe Muwekma contends demonstrate external identifications of its organization from 1928 to 1965, and 1972 to\n1982, and the Court will not consider whether the Department’s conclusions as to the other items of evidence run\nafoul of the APA.\n7\n The BIA is a component of the Department. See United States Department of the Interior Official Website,\nhttp://www.interior.gov/bureaus/index.cfm.\n\n\n\n                                                           9\n\ftribal relations at least through the period of treaty-making.” Id. In support of its position that\n\nparticipation in the California Claims Act required membership in a federally recognized Indian\n\ntribe, the Muwekma cited a question on the application form that asked the following question:\n\n“What is your degree of Indian blood and to what Tribe or Band of Indians of the State of\n\nCalifornia do you belong?” Id. Furthermore, the Muwekma noted in its petition that fourteen of\n\nthe eighteen applicants answered that question by identifying themselves as members of “some\n\nvariant of ‘Mission San Jose.’” Id.; see also id. at 23 (“In its discussion of these 18 applications,\n\nthe petitioner concludes every chart entry but one with the statement that the evidence shows\n\napplicants ‘identifying themselves’ and their ancestors as ‘Mission San Jose’ Indians.”). In\n\nparticular, the Muwekma pointed to the application form of Jose Binoco, in which a BIA\n\nexaminer had written on the application that “[t]he applicant is a full blood Indian. He is one of\n\nthe last surviving members of the Mission San Jose Indian band”; the Muwekma argued that this\n\ncomment exhibited an external identification by the BIA examiner of the individual’s\n\ncontemporary tribal affiliation. Id. at 24. All of this evidence, the Muwekma argued, supported\n\nits position that inclusion on the judgment roll “required tribal affiliation,” and that “the approval\n\nof applications provid[es] . . . an identification of a contemporary entity.” Id. at 21.\n\n       In addition to their ancestors’ participation in the California Claims Act, the Muwekma\n\nasserted in its petition that two of its members attended schools operated by the BIA. Pl.’s First\n\nSJ Mem., Ex. 7 (Proposed Finding) at 74. Specifically, the Muwekma provided “twelve pages of\n\nrecords from the Sherman Institute . . . which demonstrate[d] that Domingo Marine attended this\n\nIndian school during the 1930’s,” as well as “nine pages of records which demonstrate that John\n\nand Rayna Guzman attended the Indian school at Chemawa, Oregon.” Id., Ex. 6 (Final\n\n\n\n\n                                                  10\n\fDetermination) at 30. The Muwekma “contend[ed] that approval by the BIA of [school]\n\nenrollment constitutes evidence of an external identification of an Indian entity” by the BIA. Id.\n\n       The Muwekma also relied on scholarly publications in support of its position that\n\nexternal sources had identified it as a tribal entity. One example was “a paper written in 1955 by\n\nanthropologists Alfred Kroeber and Robert Heizer for use in Indian Claims Commission cases,”\n\nid. at 32, which the Muwekma argued contained “a clear reference” to the Indians of the San\n\nJose Mission, a group that had later taken refuge “in Pleasanton as one of the groups [that]\n\ncontinued to maintain their existence,” Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 39-40. The Muwekma relied as\n\nwell on a book authored by Malcolm Margolin in 1978 titled The Ohlone Way: Indian Life in the\n\nSan Francisco-Monterey Bay Area, in which Margolin made the following observation: “Today\n\nthe descendants of the Ohlone Indians are still among us . . . [as] a small, seldom noticed part of\n\nthe Bay Area population.” Id. at 44. The Muwekma also cited a 1978 article by Richard Levy\n\npublished in the Smithsonian Institution’s Handbook of North American Indians, which\n\nmentioned the formation of the Ohlone Indian Tribe, Inc. in 1971. Pl.’s First SJ Mem., Ex. 7\n\n(Proposed Finding) at 16. The Muwekma argued that all of these references evidence an\n\nidentification of the entity by external sources.\n\nD.     The Department’s Findings\n\n       The Department issued its proposed finding regarding the Muwekma’s petition on July\n\n30, 2001. Id. at 1. Because the Department initially made “a preliminary finding that the\n\n[group] was a successor to a previously recognized” tribe known as the Verona band, “which had\n\nbeen recognized as late as 1927,” id. at 15, the Department concluded that the Muwekma need\n\nonly present evidence that “satisf[ied] all of the criteria in paragraphs (a) through (g) of [Section]\n\n83.7,” 25 C.F.R. § 83.6(c), as modified by Section 83.8, 25 C.F.R. § 83.8(a), since 1927, id. at\n\n\n\n\n                                                    11\n\f15. Even under the modified criteria of Section 83.8, however, “the Department propose[d] to\n\ndecline . . . acknowledge[ment of] the . . . Muwekma . . . as an Indian Tribe” because the\n\nMuwekma did “not meet all seven criteria required for Federal acknowledgment.” Id. at 61.\n\nSpecifically, the Department concluded that the Muwekma did not, inter alia, meet the standard\n\nset forth in Section 83.7(a), as modified by Section 83.8(d)(1), id., because the Muwekma failed\n\nto present sufficient evidence of identification by external sources that it was “the same tribal\n\nentity that was previously acknowledged[,] or as a portion that has evolved from that entity.” Id.\n\nat 15 (quoting 25 C.F.R. § 83.8(d)(1)). After the Muwekma presented additional evidence in\n\nresponse to the issues raised by the Department, the Department then issued its Final\n\nDetermination on September 6, 2002, in which it adopted the conclusions presented in the\n\nProposed Finding and provided additional analysis regarding the newly presented evidence by\n\nthe Muwekma. See generally Pl.’s First SJ Mem., Ex. 6 (Final Determination).\n\n         As an initial matter, the Department concluded that the Muwekma failed to present\n\nsufficient evidence that the entity had been identified “as the same tribal entity that was\n\npreviously acknowledged[,] or as a portion that has evolved from that entity.” Pl.’s First SJ\n\nMem., Ex. 7 (Proposed Finding) at 15 (quoting 25 C.F.R. § 83.8(d)(1)). According to the\n\nDepartment, the Muwekma could only produce one example between 1927 and 1995 where the\n\nMuwekma was identified “as [the entity] that had evolved from the Indian settlement at the\n\nVerona station,” and the Department concluded that “[o]ne example is not sufficient to meet”\n\nSection 83.8(d)(1). 8 Id. Accordingly, the Department evaluated the Muwekma’s petition under\n\n\n8\n  It is not entirely clear why Rule 83.8(d)(1) requires a petitioner to demonstrate that not only has it been recognized\nas an American Indian entity on a substantially continuous basis since the date of last Federal acknowledgment, but\nthat the petitioner must also show that it has “been identified by [external] sources as the same tribal entity that was\npreviously acknowledged[,] or as a portion that has evolved from that entity.” After all, Rule 83.8(d)(5) makes clear\nthat if a petitioner is not able to demonstrate that external sources have identified it as the same entity that evolved\nfrom the previously acknowledged tribe, then that requirement is dispensed with, and the petitioner need only show\n                                                                                                            (continued . . .)\n\n\n                                                            12\n\fthe alternative criteria prescribed in Rules 83.8(d)(5) and 83.7(a)—whether the Muwekma “has\n\nbeen identified as an American Indian entity on a substantially continuous basis” since the date it\n\nwas last acknowledged by the Federal Government, or 1927.\n\n         Even under the modified standard of Rule 83.7(a), the Department concluded that the\n\nMuwekma failed to present sufficient evidence that it had been recognized as an American\n\nIndian entity on a substantially continuous basis by external sources between 1927 and 1985. 9\n\nId. at 24. First, the Department rejected the Muwekma’s argument that the listing of “its\n\nmembers or their ancestors . . . by the Bureau of Indian Affairs pursuant to the Act of May 18,\n\n1928, which allowed Indian claims to be made against the United States,” constitutes evidence of\n\nan external identification. Id. at 73. The Department concluded that “the claims against the\n\nUnited States authorized by that . . . act, as the petitioner acknowledges, were brought on behalf\n\nof the ‘Indians of California,’” and thus “[a]pplicants applied as individuals, and their statements\n\nabout their historical tribe of their ancestors were a form of self-identification of a[] historical,\n\nnot contemporary entity.” Id. In other words, “there was no need for the BIA to identify any\n\nspecific tribe or band of Indians for the accepted applicants” in order to determine whether an\n\napplicant was eligible to recover under the Claims Act. Id. As further evidence of its findings,\n\nthe Department pointed to a 1936 letter by the superintendent of the Sacramento Agency, who\n\ninformed “Dolores (Lola) Marine Galvan, one of the [plaintiff's] ancestors,” that she did not have\n\n(. . . continued)\nthat it has been recognized as an American Indian entity on a substantially continuous basis since the date of last\nFederal acknowledgment. It would appear, then, that the requirement that the petitioner had been identified as the\nsame tribal entity that was previously acknowledged is completely superfluous—indeed, the Department seemingly\nrecognized as much in the Proposed Finding. See Pl.’s First SJ Mem., Ex. 7 (Proposed Finding) at 15 (“It is a\npeculiarity of the regulations that there is a lower evidentiary burden on this petitioner if it is evaluated since 1927\nunder 83.7(a) without modification by [S]ection 83.8(d)(1).”). In any event, the plaintiff does not challenge the\nDepartment’s interpretation of Rule 83.8(d)(1) or 83.8(d)(5) in its motion for summary judgment, and thus the\nDepartment’s interpretation of these provisions is of no concern to the Court in resolving the motions before it.\n9\n  The Department concluded that the Muwekma provided sufficient evidence that it “ha[d] been identified as an\nIndian entity by a variety of external observers on a consistent basis since 1985.” Pl.’s First SJ Mem., Ex. 7\n(Proposed Finding) at 23.\n\n\n\n                                                           13\n\f“‘ward status’ or Federal recognition.” Id. This correspondence was significant to the\n\nDepartment because “Galvan was included on the 1933 judgment roll as a California Indian,”\n\nand thus “the superintendent did not equate” eligibility under the Act “with ‘ward status’ or\n\nFederal recognition.” Id. The Department found further corroboration of its analysis in another\n\nstatement by the superintendent, in which he stated that “Mrs. Galvan is shown on the Roll of\n\nCalifornia Indians . . . but does not have ward status and[,] therefore, is not eligible for any aid\n\nfrom Federal funds through this agency.” Id. at 73-74. As a result of its analysis, the\n\nDepartment gave no weight to any evidence that an individual’s recovery under the Claims Act\n\nconstituted an external identification of any American Indian entity. Id. at 73.\n\n       The Department also found no probative significance in the fact that the claims\n\napplication asked the applicant to identify their “degree of Indian blood and [the] Tribe or Band\n\nof Indians of the State of California” to which the applicant belonged. Pl.'s First SJ Mem., Ex. 6\n\n(Final Determination) at 22. The Department noted that “fourteen of the 18 applicants answer\n\n[that] question . . . with some variant of ‘Mission San Jose,’” and that “[t]his response referred to\n\n[nineteenth] century tribal ancestry, not to contemporary membership.” Id. Furthermore, the\n\nDepartment noted that two of the applicants had stated “Tribal name unknown,” and that another\n\napplicant had answered “Ohlones(?) Tribal name [u]nknown,” and that these answers hardly\n\ndemonstrate contemporary tribal affiliation because “[g]enerally, an individual’s active tribal\n\nmembership would not be unknown to him or her, while his or her specific tribal ancestry back\n\nto 1852 could be unknown.” Id. at 22-23. Thus, the claims application was “interpreted” by the\n\nDepartment “to inquire about the applicant’s historical tribal ancestry” and did not constitute a\n\ncontemporaneous identification by an external source. Id. at 23.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  14\n\f       Evidence that several members of the Muwekma attended Indian boarding schools also\n\nfailed to persuade the Department. Although the Department acknowledged a “1969 letter by\n\n[John] Guzman [that] refers to his attendance[] and his sister’s attendance” at a BIA school, the\n\nMuwekma failed to provide the Department with “BIA records and school records,” and thus it\n\nwas “impossible” for the Department “to know on what basis these individuals attended these\n\nschools.” Id. This was especially true, according to the Department, “because some Indian\n\nstudents were accepted on the basis of their blood degree, rather than their tribal membership.”\n\nId. at 74. Thus, the Department concluded that “attendance at these Indian schools was not\n\nnecessarily based on identification of an Indian tribe or group.” Id.\n\n       In response to the Proposed Finding, the Muwekma submitted, inter alia, “[a]n\n\napplication form for John Guzman, dated 1944,” but the Department concluded that “[t]he form\n\ncontain[ed] no information on tribal membership and no tribal certification or endorsement.”\n\nPl.'s First SJ Mem., Ex. 6 (Final Determination) at 31. And, while the form listed John\n\nGuzman’s tribe as “Mission,” the Department found this to be a “generic reference[ that] applies\n\nto many separate Indian groups,” and that it did not “refer to the [Muwekma] as a specific Indian\n\nentity.” Id. Indeed, “[a]n incomplete copy of a 1944 letter from the Sacramento Indian Agency\n\nabout . . . [John] Guzman stated: “There is no doubt that these children have sufficient Indian\n\nblood to admit them to a Government Boarding School.” Id. Based on this evidence, the\n\nDepartment concluded that entry into the boarding schools was not based on tribal affiliation, but\n\nrather on “their degree of Indian blood.” Id.\n\n       Finally, the Department rejected the scholarly articles that the Muwekma relied on in\n\ndemonstrating external identifications. First, the Department declined to accept the Smithsonian\n\nInstitution’s Handbook of North American Indians as an example of an external identification of\n\n\n\n\n                                                15\n\fthe Muwekma for several reasons. The Department found that the author of the article merely\n\n“described the Costanoan language family and concluded that the aboriginal Costanoan were\n\nneither a single ethnic group nor a political entity.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nFurthermore, the Department noted that the author “referred to [the] Pleasanton [rancheria] as\n\none of the multiethnic Indian communities [that] existed for a period of time after the\n\nsecularization of the missions in 1834.” Id. For these reasons, the Department discerned no\n\nreference to the Muwekma by the author of the book. See id.\n\n       Second, the Department rejected the Muwekma’s reliance on the 1955 paper written by\n\nanthropologists Alfred Kroeber and Robert Heizer. Id. at 32-33. In the paper, the authors\n\n“selected and examined a small, non-random[] ‘strategic sample’ of the 1933 census roll of the\n\n‘Indians of California’ as prepared by the [Department] in response to claims brought under the\n\nIndian claims jurisdiction act of 1928.” Id. at 32-33. Based on the Department’s analysis, it\n\nconcluded that the authors “did not claim that Indian entities or settlements existed in 1955, or in\n\n1933, but that historical groups that had lost their distinct culture had surviving lineal\n\ndescendants in the population of California at the time of the 1933 list.” Id. at 33. Put\n\ndifferently, the Department construed the 1955 paper as arguing “that even though Indian\n\ncultures had become extinct, Indian populations had not.” Id. Thus, the Department concluded\n\nthat the “1955 paper is not evidence sufficient to meet” Section 83.7(a) because “[w]hether\n\nindividuals of Indian descent survived until 1933, or later, is not the test posed by criterion (a).”\n\nId.\n\n       The Department also declined to give weight to the 1978 Margolin study. Id. at 44. The\n\nDepartment found that “the book is an account of an Ohlone lifestyle prior to European\n\nsettlement, and thus is not relevant to an analysis of the petitioner since 1927.” Id. The\n\n\n\n\n                                                  16\n\fDepartment acknowledged a passage cited by the petitioner in which the author noted that “the\n\ndescendants of the Ohlone Indians are still among us. . . . [as] a small, seldom noticed part of the\n\nBay Area population,” but the Department found this to be merely an “acknowledge[ment of] the\n\nexistence of living Ohlone individuals,” and not an identification of “any Indian entity in 1978.”\n\nId. (alteration in original).\n\nE.       The Department’s Affirmation of Tribal Status for the Lower Lake and Ione Tribes\n\n         In 1994, the Department conferred federal recognition upon the Ione Band of Miwok\n\n(“Ione”), a Central California Indian tribe. Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 25; id., Exs. 61-63; see also\n\nCompl. ¶ 26; Answer at 22. The Department similarly acknowledged the tribal status of the\n\nLower Lake Rancheria of California (“Lower Lake”), another Central California tribe, by placing\n\nit on the list of federally recognized tribes in 2001. 10 Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 24; id., Ex. 60; see\n\nalso Compl. ¶ 26; Answer at 23. Neither the Ione nor Lower Lake were required by the\n\nDepartment to submit a formal petition for tribal acknowledgment under Part 83, nor were they\n\nrequired to undergo the “lengthy and thorough” process of evaluation “based on detailed\n\ndocumentation provided by the petitioner,” Pl.’s First SJ Mem., Ex. 46, before receiving the\n\nbenefits of federal tribal recognition, Compl. ¶ 26; Answer at 22, 23 (admitting that the\n\nDepartment “clarified the status of [Ione] . . . [and] reaffirmed the status of [Lower Lake]\n\n\n10\n   There is some confusion in the record regarding the year in which the tribal status of Lower Lake was formally\nacknowledged. See Compl. ¶ 26 (stating that “in 2002, [Lower Lake] . . . was reaffirmed by administrative action”);\nAnswer at 23 (admitting that “in December 2000, [the Department] reaffirmed the status of [Lower Lake]”); Pl.’s\nFirst SJ Mem. at 24 (stating that “[o]n January 3, 2001, the Department announced that it would correct its records\nto recognize [Lower Lake]”) (citing Pl.’s First SJ Mem., Ex. 60 (January 3, 2001 DOI news release)). The precise\ndate of Lower Lake’s recognition is not material to this litigation, but for convenience the Court will refer to January\n3, 2001, the date on which the Department formally stated that it had “reaffirmed the federal trust relationship\nbetween the United States and . . . [Lower Lake],” as the operative date. Pl.’s First SJ Mem., Ex. 60 at 1. The\nDepartment also extended federal acknowledgment to two Alaska tribes, without requiring them to proceed through\nthe Part 83 process, at the same time it recognized Lower Lake. Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 24 (citing Pl.’s First SJ\nMem., Ex. 60); Pl.’s Opp. at 2; Answer at 30 (stating that “the former Assistant Secretary reaffirmed the status of\ntwo Alaska Native villages outside the [P]art 83 acknowledgment procedures during the pendency of the Muwekma\npetition”).\n\n\n\n                                                          17\n\fwithout requiring [them] to submit . . . petition[s] under . . . Part 83”); Answer at 30 (admitting\n\nthat “while the [Muwekma] Tribe’s petition for recognition was pending, the Department\n\nreaffirmed the status of [Ione] and [Lower Lake] outside the [Part 83] procedures”). Moreover,\n\nthe Department does not dispute the Muwekma’s allegation that the Ione and Lower Lake, like\n\nthe Muwekma, “were . . . Central California tribes previously recognized at least as late as 1927”\n\nwho did not appear on the 1979 list of federally recognized tribes despite “never [having] been\n\nterminated by Congress [or] by any official action of [the Department].” Pl.’s First SJ Opp. at 5;\n\nsee also Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 23-27; Answer at 22-23.\n\n       The Muwekma alleges that on several occasions, it requested that the Department\n\nreaffirm its tribal status through administrative correction, as the Department had done with the\n\nIone and Lower Lake, without requiring that its completed petition be evaluated under the Part\n\n83 criteria. Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 11; Compl. ¶ 27; Answer at 23. The Department denied the\n\nMuwekma’s requests, stating that it did not have the power to restore the Muwekma to the list of\n\nrecognized tribes by administrative means. Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 11; Compl. ¶ 27; Answer at 23\n\n(admitting that “[n]otwithstanding the Department actions to the contrary with respect to the Ione\n\nBand and Lower Lake, [Department] staff repeatedly advised [Muwekma] that the Assistant\n\nSecretary [of Indian Affairs] lacked authority to administratively reaffirm tribal status”).\n\nF.     The Present Litigation\n\n       The Muwekma brought this action on June 6, 2003, seeking reversal of the Final\n\nDetermination, placement on the Department’s list of federally recognized tribes, and other\n\ninjunctive relief. Compl. at 18. On July 13, 2005, the Muwekma moved for summary judgment,\n\nalleging that (1) “the Department recognized the Muwekma . . . under congressional legislation\n\nat least until 1927,” Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 17, and because “Congress has the sole authority to\n\n\n\n\n                                                 18\n\fterminate tribes,” id. at 15, the Department “had no authority to withdraw recognition [of the\n\nMuwekma] in the Final Determination, id. at 17; (2) the Department’s recognition of the Verona\n\nband in 1927 “established a trust relationship” and that the Department’s Final Determination\n\n“constituted [a] serious violation[] of its fiduciary duty to the Muwekma,” id.; (3) the\n\nDepartment violated the APA and the Equal Protection Clause when it required Muwekma to\n\npetition for acknowledgment of its tribal status pursuant to the “lengthy and thorough” regulatory\n\nprocedures of Part 83, id., Ex. 46, despite administratively reaffirming the status of similarly\n\nsituated tribes without requiring those tribes to undertake the Part 83 process and without\n\nsufficient explanation for the disparate treatment, id. at 21-22, 26-30; see also Pl.’s First SJ\n\nOpp’n at 9-12; Compl. ¶¶ 37-39, 44-47; (4) the Department violated the Muwekma’s due process\n\n“right to continued recognition, including the associated services, protections[,] and financial\n\nbenefits,” id. at 30; (5) the Department violated Section 554(d) of the APA by allowing “one of\n\nits attorney advisors” to both represent the Department in an earlier litigation involving the\n\nMuwekma, 11 and “advise[] . . . the Department[ in its] decision on the merits of the Muwekma’s\n\npetition for recognition,” id. at 33; see also 5 U.S.C. § 554(d) (barring “[a]n employee or agent”\n\nof an agency to participate both “in the performance of investigation or prosecuting functions for\n\nan agency” and to “participate or advise in the decision recommended decision, or agency\n\nreview” of that same or “factually related case, . . . except as witness or counsel in public\n\nproceedings”); and (6) “the Final Determination was arbitrary and capricious because it\n\nimproperly refused to consider, rejected[,] or misconstrued substantial evidence demonstrating\n\n11\n  The prior litigation in this Court referenced by the Muwekma involved a petition for a writ of mandamus it filed to\ncompel the Department “to complete within twelve months its review of the [Muwekma’s] petition for\nacknowledgment as a federally recognized Indian tribe.” Muwekma Tribe v.

In response\n\nto Muwekma’s summary judgment motion, the defendants filed a cross-motion for summary\n\njudgment on September 12, 2005, arguing that (1) the Muwekma’s claim that the Department\n\nunlawfully withdrew recognition in the Final Determination “is barred by the statute of\n\nlimitations[] because it accrued more than six years ago,” Defs.’ First SJ Mem at 28; (2) even\n\nassuming that the action is not barred by the statute of limitations, “it is clear that [the\n\nDepartment’s] application of the federal acknowledgment regulations to [the p]laintiff’s petition\n\nand subsequent [F]inal [D]etermination were lawful,” id. at 32; (2) the Muwekma’s assertion of a\n\ntrust obligation owed to it by the Department “has no merit,” id. at 37, because its “claim is\n\npremised on its faulty belief that it continues to be a recognized tribe,” id. at 38; (3) the\n\nMuwekma’s due process claim cannot survive because it does not have a “critical\n\nconstitutionally protected property interest” in federal acknowledgment as a Native American\n\ntribe, id. at 42; (4) Section 554(d) is inapposite because “by its express terms,” the statute applies\n\nin cases where an “[a]djudication [is] required by statute to be determined on the record after\n\nopportunity for an agency hearing,” id. at 48; (5) the Department did not violate the Equal\n\nProtection Clause because it had a rational basis for requiring the Muwekma to petition under\n\nSection 83, id. at 39-40, and that “groups demonstrating or alleging characteristics similar to\n\n[Muwekma] are regularly required to proceed through the federal acknowledgment process,” id.\n\nat 40; see also Defs.’ Reply at 17-19; and (6) “[t]he Assistant Secretary’s final determination that\n\n[the p]laintiff was not entitled to a government-to-government relationship with the United States\n\nis fully supported by the lengthy administrative record in this case,” id. at 9.\n\n        The Court issued a memorandum opinion and order on September 21, 2006, in which it\n\ndenied both parties’ motions for summary judgment and remanded this case back to the\n\n\n\n\n                                                  20\n\fDepartment to allow the agency to supplement the record.

Specifically, “the Court conclude[d] that\n\nthe defendants [had] not articulated a sufficient basis for the Department’s disparate treatment of\n\nMuwekma and the Ione and Lower Lake tribes.” Id. at 116. While the Court acknowledged the\n\nexistence of the modified Part 83 procedures for those entities that can demonstrate prior federal\n\nacknowledgment, the Court found the relevant inquiry to be “whether the Department has\n\nprovided a rational basis for requiring Muwekma to adhere to the Part 83 procedure while\n\nexempting other tribes that are purportedly similarly situated.” Id. at 116. After reviewing the\n\nrecord, the Court concluded that “the Department . . . has never provided a clear and coherent\n\nexplanation for its disparate treatment of Muwekma when compared with Ione and Lower Lake,\n\nnor has it ever, in the administrative record or in the papers before this Court, articulated\n\nstandards that guided its decision to require Muwekma to submit a petition and documentation\n\nunder Part 83 while allowing other tribes to bypass the formal tribal recognition procedure\n\naltogether.” Id. at 121; see also id. at 119 (“[T]he defendants here have cited nothing to explain\n\nthe basis for [its] decision to treat Muwekma differently from Ione and Lower Lake.”); id. at 120\n\n(“[T]he administrative record contains no indication why the Department would refuse to\n\nconsider Muwekma’s requests for administrative correction while allowing Ione and Lower Lake\n\nto proceed outside the Part 83 regulatory process.”); id. at 124 (“[T]here is no contemporaneous\n\nexplanation of the Department’s decision to treat Muwekma differently from Ione and Lower\n\nLake; indeed, it is the lack of a reasoned explanation in this regard that Muwekma is challenging\n\nunder the Equal Protection Clause and the APA.”); id. at 125 (“[T]he Court is unable to discern\n\nthe Department’s rationale for requiring Muwekma to proceed through the Part 83 tribal\n\nacknowledgment procedures while allowing other tribes that appear to be similarly situated to\n\n\n\n\n                                                 21\n\fbypass the procedures altogether . . . .”). The Court did observe in a footnote that the agency had\n\n“obliquely” attempted to distinguish the Muwekma from the Lower Lake by noting that the\n\ngovernment had previously acquired land in trust for the Lower Lake, and that the Lower Lake\n\nparticipated in an Indian Reorganization Act election, but the Court found this explanation\n\ninsufficient to justify “the Department’s allegedly differential treatment of Muwekma” because\n\n“this explanation pertain[ed] only to a difference between Muwekma and one of the tribes with\n\nwhom it is claiming to be similarly situated,” and that the record does not reflect that “it required\n\nthe Muwekman and not Lower Lake to undergo the Part 83 procedure because the latter, unlike\n\nthe former, had received land in trust and had participated in an election.” Id. at 118 n.13. The\n\nCourt, therefore, directed the Department to “provide a detailed explanation of the reasons for its\n\nrefusal to waive the Part 83 procedures when evaluating Muwekma’s request for federal tribal\n\nrecognition.” Id. at 124.\n\n       On November 27, 2006, in response to the Court’s memorandum opinion and order, the\n\nDepartment filed a document titled “Explanation to Supplement the Administrative Record –\n\nMuwekma Ohlone Tribe.” Explanation to Supplement the Administrative Record at 1. In this\n\nsubmission, the Department explained that its “decisions to clarify the status of Ione in 1994 and\n\nto reaffirm [f]ederal recognition of Lower Lake in 2000 . . . were not based merely on a finding\n\nthat those groups were previously recognized by the [f]ederal [g]overnment at some time in the\n\npast.” Id. at 2. Rather, the Department found that the “Lower Lake and Ione . . . had trust lands,\n\nagreements, legislation, or consultation [with the Federal Government] decades later than 1927,”\n\nwhere as the Muwekma had no such interactions with the federal government. Id. at 7. Rather,\n\nthe Department explained that “[t]he Ione and Lower Lake decisions justified action on behalf of\n\nthose groups that Muwekma did not share.” Id. at 3. For those reasons, the Department\n\n\n\n\n                                                 22\n\fconcluded that the “Muwekma was not similarly situated to either Ione or . . . Lower Lake.” Id.\n\nat 3.\n\n        With regard to the Lower Lake, the Department noted that the record in that case\n\n“demonstrates a pattern of Federal dealings with the Lower Lake Rancheria that differs from the\n\nabsence of any similar evidence for a Verona band.” Id. at 7. For instance, “[t]he [f]ederal\n\n[g]overnment purchased land to establish the Lower Lake Rancheria on January 25, 1916,” and\n\n“[t]he government held this land in trust until the Act of 1956 authorized its sale.” Id. The\n\nDepartment also cited a report issued in 1927 that both “advised against the purchase of land for\n\na Verona band,” and “recommended that land be purchased for the Lower Lake band.” Id.\n\nThen, “[i]n 1935,” the agency again sought to acquire additional land for the band and other\n\nsmall groups.” Id. Several years later, the Department issued a report in which it “noted the\n\nexistence of a Lower Lake group living off the rancheria,” after which it “authorized an\n\nindividual to move onto the rancheria and . . . surveyed the rancheria’s population.” Id. The\n\nDepartment also noted that the existence of the Lower Lake had been recognized by the federal\n\ngovernment on two separate occasions—in 1953, when the United States “House of\n\nRepresentatives listed the Lower Lake Rancheria” in House Report 2503, and in 1980 when “the\n\nBIA central office and regional office considered including the Lower Lake Rancheria on the list\n\nof federally recognized tribes, but did not do so.” Id. Based on these dealings with the federal\n\ngovernment, the Department concluded that the “Lower Lake and Muwekma were not similarly\n\nsituated.” Id. at 6.\n\n        The Department also identified a history of contact between the federal government and\n\nthe Ione. “The [f]ederal [g]overnment attempted to purchase land for” the Ione, which had been\n\nexplicitly “identified by a census made by a special agent in 1915.” Id. at 7. In 1916, “the\n\n\n\n\n                                                23\n\fIndian Office obtained a deed and abstract of title for the purchase of land for the Ione[,] . . . and\n\nthe Department provided the Office with a formal “Authority” for the purchase. Id. The\n\nDepartment then cited documents reflecting an “extensive, but unsuccessful, effort[] to clear title\n\nto the land for the” Ione from 1915 to 1925. Id. Then, “[i]n 1941, the Department considered a\n\npetition from the ‘Indians of the Ione Valley’ requesting the purchase of land.” Id. at 7-8. “In\n\n1970, two Ione individuals contacted the BIA about the status of the land on which they lived,”\n\nand subsequently “the California Rural Indian Land Project . . . of the California Indian Legal\n\nServices proposed bringing a quiet[-]title action on behalf of the Ione Band . . . and requesting\n\nthat the land be accepted and held in trust.” Id. As a result, in October 1972, the Department\n\nissued a letter “accept[ing] by relinquishment of title or gift [a] parcel of land to be held in trust\n\nfor the Ione Band of Miwok Indians.” Id. The Department found that these facts, which\n\nevidenced a “historical circumstance of an uncompleted acquisition of trust land on the [Ione’s]\n\nbehalf,” were sufficient to differentiate the Ione from the Muwekma.\n\n        As for the Muwekma, the Department concluded that the same 1927 report that\n\nrecommended a land purchase for the Lower Lake concluded that “a land purchase did not need\n\nto be made for members of a Verona band.” Id. The Department also noted that after 1906,\n\nvarious “appropriation acts that authorized purchases of land for homeless California Indians . . .\n\nalso did not mandate action specifically on behalf of the Verona band.” Id. Although the\n\nMuwekma contended that the author of the report “failed to carry out his instructions” to\n\npurchase land on behalf of the Verona band, the Department concluded that the author’s\n\n“instructions contained no request for specific action or a specific result on behalf of a Verona\n\nband.” Id. Rather, “[t]he instructions [he] received in 1927 were to submit a general report\n\nabout California Indians, without making an extensive field investigation, and to identify the\n\n\n\n\n                                                  24\n\fband for whom land should be purchased.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the\n\nDepartment concluded “that the historical circumstances of Muwekma can be distinguished from\n\nthose of Ione and Lower Lake.” Id. at 9.\n\n        Based on the Department’s supplementation of the record, the plaintiff once again moved\n\nfor summary judgment. Although the plaintiff has reasserted all of the grounds it relied upon in\n\nits initial summary judgment filing, Pl.’s Second SJ Mem. at 36, the plaintiff focused its efforts\n\non demonstrating that “the Department . . . denied equal protection of the law and acted\n\narbitrarily and capriciously toward the Muwekma . . . by unreasonably refusing to reaffirm\n\nMuwekma’s recognized status and by requiring it to submit instead to the burdensome\n\nprocedures of . . . []Part 83[],” Id. at 1. Specifically, the plaintiff argued, inter alia, that the\n\nDepartment’s reliance on having “at least intended to purchase federal trust property” as a basis\n\nfor distinguishing the Muwekma from Lower Lake and Ione “is merely a post hoc rationalization\n\nby Department officials that had nothing to do with the Ione or Lower Lake decisions at the\n\ntime,” id. at 28, because “[b]oth Congress and the Department of the Interior have repeatedly\n\nrecognized tribes that had no land, and have specifically provided for the purchase of land, to be\n\nheld in trust, after recognition, id. at 29 (footnotes omitted). The Muwekma further argues that\n\nits review of federal-acknowledgment “decisions demonstrates that not one . . . decision uses the\n\nlack of federal trust land (or any attempts to secure such trust land) as evidence against a\n\npetitioner or as a negative factor under the criteria.” Id. at 30 (footnote omitted). The Muwekma\n\nalso notes that “in neither of [the] decisions” relating to the Lower Lake or the Ione “did the\n\nDepartment state that the trust land . . . issue was a factor weighing in the decision to recognize\n\nthese two Tribes outside of the Part 83 process.” Id. at 33. In any event, the Muwekma argues\n\nthat “the trust land issue is a false factual distinction in any case” because “the Muwekma . . . , as\n\n\n\n\n                                                    25\n\fthe Verona [b]and, was found to be eligible for trust land purchase,” and that “none of [the three\n\nTribes] possessed any trust land at the time they sought recognition” by the federal government.\n\nId. (emphasis omitted).\n\n       The Department renewed its cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing, inter alia, that\n\nthe “[p]laintiff is not similarly situated to Lower Lake or Ione[] because it lacks a long-standing\n\ngovernmental relationship with the United States.” Defs.’ Second SJ Mem. at 8. The\n\nDepartment noted that “[i]n contrast to [the Lower Lake and Ione], there is no evidence of any\n\nfederal dealings with a Muwekma group or Verona band after 1927.” Id. (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). The Department emphasized the fact that it had multiple dealings with the\n\nLower Lake, id., and that “[l]ike Lower Lake, Ione had a long-standing governmental\n\nrelationship with the United States[,] although sporadically documented.” Id. at 10. As to the\n\nMuwekma, however, the Department argued that the “[p]laintiff’s relationship with the United\n\nStates ended much farther in the past.” Id. at 12. The Department once again rejected the\n\nposition that the enrollment of individuals “for judgment funds awarded to the ‘Indians of\n\nCalifornia,’” and the attendance at BIA schools by “three individuals in the 1930[]s and 1940[]s”\n\nwas proof that the Muwekma was recognized as a tribal entity by the United States, arguing that\n\n“the United States . . . provided funds and services to individual Indians.” Id. at 13. As a result,\n\nthe Department argued that “these allegations fail to establish that [the p]laintiff is similarly\n\nsituated to [the] Lower Lake and Ione.” Id.\n\n       After considering the parties’ renewed submissions, the Court issued an order on\n\nSeptember 30, 2008, concluding that the Department’s “arguments, and the explanation . . .\n\ngiving rise to them, seemingly cannot be reconciled with the Court’s September 21, 2006\n\n[M]emorandum [O]pinion.” Id. at 5. The Court noted that it had “determined in its prior\n\n\n\n\n                                                  26\n\f[M]emorandum [O]pinion that the defendants’ arguments to the effect that the plaintiff was not\n\nsimilarly situated to Ione and Lower Lake were without merit,” and that “[t]he necessary\n\nimplication of both conclusions is that the Court found the plaintiff to be similarly situated to\n\nIone and Lower Lake.” Id. at 7. The Court explained that it had “remanded the case to the\n\nDepartment so it could explain why it treated similarly situated tribes differently, not so that it\n\ncould construct post-hoc arguments as to whether the tribes were similarly situated in the first\n\nplace.” Id. at 9. The Court further stated that “[i]t certainly did not remand the case so that the\n\nDepartment could re-open the record, weigh facts that it had never previously considered, and\n\narrive at a conclusion vis-à-vis the similarity of the plaintiff’s situation to those of Ione and\n\nLower Lake that it had never reached before.” Id. at 9. Accordingly, the Court stayed the\n\nparties’ summary judgment motions, id. at 1, and directed “the parties to file supplemental\n\nmemoranda of law addressing . . . whether the Court should consider administrative records\n\npertaining to the [Lower Lake and Ione] that were not considered when the Department issued its\n\ninitial decision denying the plaintiff’s petition for recognition,” id. at 9.\n\n        The Department filed its Supplemental Memorandum on October 30, 2008.

Legal Analysis\n\n       The overarching question to be decided by the Court on the parties’ cross-motions for\n\nsummary judgment is whether to uphold the Department’s decision to deny acknowledgment of\n\nthe Muwekma as a Native American Tribe entitled “to the protection, services, and benefits”\n\nprovided by the Federal government to such entities, as well as the “immunities and privileges\n\navailable to other federally acknowledged Indian tribes by virtue of their government-to-\n\ngovernment relationship with the United States.” 25 C.F.R. § 83.2. In addressing this question,\n\nthe Court must confront and resolve the following issues: (1) whether the Department unlawfully\n\nterminated federal recognition of the Muwekma as a Native American tribe; (2) whether the\n\nDepartment’s recognition of the Verona band in 1927 established a trust relationship, and\n\nwhether any fiduciary duties owed as a result of that relationship were breached by the\n\nDepartment; (3) whether the Department’s Final Determination was arbitrary and capricious; (4)\n\nwhether the Department violated the Muwekma’s due process rights when it denied a “right to\n\ncontinued recognition, including the associated services, protections[,] and financial benefits,”\n\nPl.’s Opp’n at 30; (5) whether the participation in the decision-making and litigation process by\n\nan attorney-advisor at the Department violated Section 554(d) of the APA; and (6) whether the\n\nDepartment violated the APA and the Equal Protection Clause by requiring the Muwekma to\n\npetition for acknowledgment of its tribal status pursuant to the Part 83 procedures, while waiving\n\n\n\n\n                                                 31\n\fthose same procedures for the Lower Lake and Ione tribes. The Court will consider each issue in\n\nturn.\n\n      A. The Muwekma’s Unlawful Termination of Tribal Status Claim\n\n         The Muwekma argues, and it does not appear to be disputed, that “Congress has the sole\n\nauthority to terminate tribes.” Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 15. Because the Muwekma was found to\n\nhave descended from a Native American tribe (the Verona band) that had been federally\n\nrecognized until at least 1927, the Muwekma asserts that the Department “had no authority to\n\nwithdraw [its] recognition in the Final Determination.” Id. at 16. The Department, on the other\n\nhand, responds that this claim is barred by the statute of limitations, and that even assuming the\n\nMuwekma has timely brought this claim, the claim is without merit because “it improperly\n\nassumes that its descent from the once recognized Pleasanton or Verona band[] automatically\n\nindicates that it is a continuously existing political entity.” Def.’s First Cross-Mot. SJ Mem. at\n\n32.\n\n         The Court agrees with the defendants that this claim is barred by the statute of limitations\n\nof 28 U.S.C. § 2401(a). Under this statute, “every civil action commenced against the United\n\nStates shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years after the right of action first\n\naccrues.” 28 U.S.C. § 2401(a). The moment at which a cause of action first accrues within the\n\nmeaning of Section 2401(a) is when “the person challenging the agency action can institute and\n\nmaintain a suit in court.” Spannaus v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"491631\"><a href=\"/opinion/491631/edward-spannaus-v-us-department-of-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">824</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 56 (D.C. Cir. 1987).\n\nHere, the Department asserts several dates at which the Muwekma could have pursued a cause of\n\naction against the agency: (1) in 1927, when the Muwekma contends that “the Department\n\nprovided [it with only] a fraction of the federal funding and services allocated to . . . Indian\n\ntribes, Defs.’ First SJ Mem. at 30 (quoting Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 20); (2) in 1979, when the\n\n\n\n\n                                                  32\n\fMuwekma “was not listed on the Federal Register list of entities recognized by the Secretary of\n\nInterior as a tribe,” id.; and (3) in 1989, when the Muwekma filed its petition for federal\n\nacknowledgment, id. at 31. Of these three dates, the Court finds that the most obvious point at\n\nwhich the Muwekma could have first brought suit against the agency for purportedly terminating\n\nits tribal status was in 1989, when it was clear that it was aware that it was not a federally\n\nrecognized tribe. Given that the Muwekma did not bring this action against the Department until\n\n2001, approximately twelve years after it undoubtedly possessed knowledge that it lacked\n\nacknowledgment by the federal government as a tribe, its unlawful termination of tribal status\n\nclaim is plainly barred by the limitations period of 28 U.S.C. § 2401(a).\n\n       The Court cannot accept the Muwekma’s argument that “[t]he triggering event fixing\n\nliability in this case is the [Department’s] Final Determination.” Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 19. The\n\nMuwekma conflates two distinct causes of action that an aggrieved party could, in theory, bring\n\nagainst the Department regarding tribal-acknowledgment status: one for a wrongful denial of\n\nfederal acknowledgment, and one for a wrongful termination of federal acknowledgment. The\n\nPart 83 procedures fall squarely into the former category; the purpose of such procedures is to\n\ndetermine whether a Native American entity is entitled to a status that it does not have upon\n\npetitioning the Department: “[a]cknowledgement of tribal existence.” 25 C.F.R. § 83.2. The\n\nprocedures are not a mechanism for reviewing whether a federally recognized tribe should retain\n\nits tribal status—a process that could lead to litigation falling within the latter cause of action\n\nmentioned above because the end result would be the termination of that tribe’s status.\n\nOtherwise, it would make no sense that a federally recognized tribe would voluntarily initiate a\n\nletter of intent to request acknowledgment under the Part 83 Procedures. See 25 C.F.R. § 83.4(a)\n\n(“Any Indian group in the continental United States that believes it should be acknowledged as\n\n\n\n\n                                                  33\n\fan Indian tribe . . . may submit a letter of intent.”). Thus, the point of accrual for the\n\nMuwekma’s cause of action for wrongful termination of tribal status was the moment at which it\n\nrealized the federal government no longer recognized the entity as a tribe—a point in time that\n\noccurred long before the Department’s issuance of the Final Determination.\n\n       The Muwekma’s reliance on the “continuing claim” doctrine also fails. See Pl.’s First SJ\n\nMem. at 20 n.17. The “continuing claim” doctrine “allows a plaintiff to get relief for a time-\n\nbarred act by linking it with an act that is within the limitations period,” Selan v. Kiley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586932\"><a href=\"/opinion/586932/59-fair-emplpraccas-bna-775-59-empl-prac-dec-p-41664-kate-t/\"><span class=\"volume\">969</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">560</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 564 (7th Cir. 1992), and here, the Muwekma argues that “the linking governmental act\n\nwould be the Final Determination itself, which relied heavily on the premise that the Muwekma .\n\n. . was not recognized externally by the Department or others in the period after 1927,” Pl.’s First\n\nSJ Mem. at 20 n.17. Such an application of the doctrine “effectively would eradicate the statute\n\nof limitations” because “lack of formal recognition is the gravamen of the plaintiff[’s] complaint,\n\nso only formal recognition could bring an end to the ‘continuing claim,’” thereby “preserving\n\n[the Muwekma’s] cause of action until it becomes moot.” Miami Nation of Indians of Indiana,\n\nInc. v. Lujan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1428734\"><a href=\"/opinion/1428734/miami-nation-of-indians-of-indiana-inc-v-lujan/\"><span class=\"volume\">832</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">253</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 257 (N.D. Ind. 1993). The “continuing claim” doctrine,\n\ntherefore, has no application to the facts of this case.\n\n       Accordingly, the Court concludes that the Muwekma’s cause of action based on its claim\n\nthat the Department wrongfully terminated its tribal status is barred by the statute of limitations.\n\n   B. The Muwekma’s Arbitrary and Capricious Claim\n\n       The Muwekma argues that “the [Department’s] Final Determination was arbitrary and\n\ncapricious because it improperly . . . rejected or misconstrued substantial evidence demonstrating\n\nthat the Tribe satisfied the recognition criteria.” Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 35. With respect to the\n\nrequirement under Section 83.8(a) that the Muwekma proffer evidence that it had been identified\n\n\n\n\n                                                  34\n\fas a tribal entity by external sources on a substantially continuous basis, the Muwekma contends\n\nthat the Department arbitrarily rejected evidence that members of the organization “enrolled . . .\n\nin the California Judgment Act,” id. at 37, because “the BIA required applicants to identify their\n\ntribal affiliation in sworn and witnessed applications,” see id. at 38 (noting that the application\n\nasked “What is your degree of Indian blood and to what Tribe or Band of Indians of the State of\n\nCalifornia do you belong?”), and that “the Bureau approved these applications, including the\n\nresponse of the Muwekma . . . members who replied to this [inquiry] by referring to the Mission\n\nSan Jose,” id. The Muwekma also argues that the Department erred in “reject[ing] evidence that\n\n[its] members attended BIA boarding schools in Oregon and . . . California during the 1930[]s\n\nand 1940[]s on the ground that the record did not indicate whether these tribal members were\n\naccepted based on their degree of Indian blood or membership in a recognized tribal group,”\n\nbecause the Department may not provide special services to Indians on the account of their race.\n\nId. at 39 (citing Morton v. Mancari, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109067\"><a href=\"/opinion/109067/morton-v-mancari/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">535</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 553-54 (1974)). Lastly, the Muwekma asserts\n\nthat “[t]he Final Determination arbitrarily rejected substantial evidence of external identification\n\nby scholars, including a 1955 report . . . prepared by anthropologists Alfred L. Kroeber and R.F.\n\nHeizer,” id. at 39, as well as “references to the continuing existence of the Muwekma Ohlone\n\npeople in a book written in 1978 by Malcolm Margolin” and in a 1978 Smithsonian publication,\n\nid. at 40. In rejecting all of this evidence, the Muwekma contends the Department “appl[ied] a\n\nstandard of proof far beyond the regulatory standard” of proof, id. at 35, and that “the\n\nDepartment ignored critical historical circumstances” in its Final Determination by “fail[ing] to .\n\n. . account [for] the impact of the lack of a landbase and the particularly horrible experience of\n\nCalifornia tribes on the [Muwekma’s] ability to document its prior activities,” id. at 36.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 35\n\f       The Court finds all of the Muwekma’s arguments to be without merit. With regard to the\n\nMuwekma’s contention that its members participated in the California Claims Act, the\n\nDepartment reasonably concluded that such evidence did not constitute an external identification\n\nof the Muwekma. The Department adequately explained that applicants’ indications of some\n\nassociation to “Mission San Jose” in response to the question: “What is your degree of Indian\n\nblood and to what Tribe or Band of Indians of California do you belong?” is insufficient to\n\nconstitute an external identification of the Muwekma because that identification “referred to 19th\n\ncentury tribal ancestry, not to contemporary membership.” Pl.’s First SJ Mem., Ex. 6 (Final\n\nDetermination) at 22. The Department’s conclusion is further supported by the answers provided\n\nby two other approved applicants who answered the same question by stating “Tribal name\n\nunknown” and “Ohlones(?) Tribal name [u]nknown.” Id. As the Department noted, “an\n\nindividual’s active tribal membership would not be unknown to him or her, while his or her\n\nspecific tribal ancestry back to 1852 could be unknown.” Id. at 22-23. The Court does not find\n\nthe Department’s analysis to be wanting in logic, and thus there is no reason for the Court to\n\ndisturb the agency’s conclusions regarding this evidence.\n\n       Likewise, the Court finds the Department’s conclusion that attendance at a BIA boarding\n\nschool did not require membership in a federally recognized tribe to be supported by the record.\n\nFirst, the Court is not persuaded that the BIA’s admission of students in its boarding schools\n\nmust have been based on their tribal membership, rather than their race as Indians, because of the\n\nSupreme Court’s decision in Mancari. See Mancari, 417 U.S. at 554 (holding that the Indian\n\nReorganization Act’s employment preference for qualified Indians does not constitute invidious\n\nracial discrimination because “[t]he preference, as applied, is granted to Indians not as a discrete\n\nracial group, but, rather, as members of quasi-sovereign tribal entities whose lives and activities\n\n\n\n\n                                                 36\n\fare governed by the BIA in a unique fashion.”). Even assuming that the Court agreed with the\n\nMuwekma that, under Mancari, “the legal basis for providing special services to Indians is not\n\ntheir race but the political relationship between the tribe and the federal government,” Pl.’s First\n\nSJ Mem. at 39., the Mancari decision was issued in 1974, decades after the Muwekma’s\n\nmembers attended these boarding schools, see id. (discussing evidence of attendance at BIA\n\nboarding schools “during the 1930[]s and 1940[]s”). The Court cannot logically conclude that\n\nthe Mancari decision has any relevance to the BIA’s earlier student admissions policies for its\n\nschools; such illogical reasoning is no more convincing than the premise that segregation did not\n\nexist in the 1940s because the Supreme Court later held the practice unconstitutional in Brown v.\n\nBoard of Education of Topeka, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105312\"><a href=\"/opinion/105312/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">349</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1955). Thus, Mancari can have no sway on the\n\nCourt’s analysis of the Department’s position concerning earlier BIA boarding school\n\nattendance.\n\n       Second, the Department closely analyzed one of the boarding school student’s\n\napplications, which it noted did not include “information on tribal membership and . . . tribal\n\ncertification or endorsement.” Pl.’s First SJ Mem., Ex. 6 (Final Determination) at 31. The\n\nDepartment noted that the applicant had identified his tribe as “Mission,” and that such a\n\nreference was merely a “generic” one that “applies to many separate Indian groups,” and not the\n\nMuwekma specifically. Id. This conclusion is consistent with the Department’s observation that\n\nvarious “Ohlone” Indians “were concentrated by the Spaniards before 1834 at the Mission San\n\nJose,” id., Ex. 7 (Proposed Finding – Summary) at 10, and that several other Native American\n\nentities have claimed descent from those Indians residing at the Mission San Jose, see id., Ex. 7\n\n(Proposed Finding) at 9 (noting that the existence of other “Ohlone” applicants demonstrates that\n\n“the Muwekma . . . does not have an uncontested claim to represent the descendants of all the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 37\n\fOhlone of the San Francisco Bay Area or all the territory of the Costanoan-speaking peoples”).\n\nThe Department’s conclusion is further buttressed by a 1944 letter which stated: “There is no\n\ndoubt but what these children have sufficient Indian blood to admit them to a Government\n\nBoarding School.” Id., Ex. 6 (Final Determination) at 31. This evidence, when viewed\n\ncollectively, plainly supports the Department’s conclusion that evidence of attendance at BIA\n\nboarding schools does not reasonably demonstrate identification of the Muwekma by an external\n\nsource.\n\n          Third, the Court does not find any error in the Department’s rejection of the Muwekma’s\n\nscholarly evidence. According to the Department, the author of the Smithsonian article merely\n\n“described the Costanoan language family and concluded that the aboriginal Costanoan were\n\nneither a single ethnic group nor a political entity.” Id., Ex. 7 (Proposed Finding) at 76 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). With regard to Kroeber and Heizer’s 1955 paper, the Department\n\nfound the authors to be arguing “that even though Indian cultures had become extinct, Indian\n\npopulations had not.” Id., Ex. 6 (Final Determination) at 33. This proposition, the Department\n\nfound, “was a statement about the survival of individual descendants, rather than Indian groups.”\n\nId. Accordingly, “[b]ecause [Kroeber and Heizer] referred to surviving descendants rather than\n\ngroups, they did not identify an Indian entity in either [the 1930s or 1950s].” Id. As for the 1978\n\nMargolin book, the Department acknowledged that “[i]n general, the book is an analysis of an\n\nOhlone lifestyle prior to European settlement,” which it found “is not relevant to an analysis of\n\nthe [Muwekma] since 1927.” Id., Ex. 6 (Final Determination) at 44. Moreover, the Department\n\nfound that “[w]hile Margolin acknowledged the existence of living Ohlone individuals [when his\n\nresearch was conducted, he] did not identify” any Indian entity in 1978. Id. There is nothing in\n\n\n\n\n                                                 38\n\fthese findings from which the Court can conclude that the Department erred in rejecting this\n\nevidence as external identifications of the Muwekma.\n\n         Lastly, the Court is not persuaded that the Department misapplied 25 C.F.R. § 83.6.\n\nNone of the evidence proffered by the Muwekma establishes a “reasonable likelihood” that\n\nexternal sources had identified it as a Native American tribe; simply because the Muwekma\n\nbelieves that its evidence is persuasive does not mean it is so. As the Department sufficiently\n\nexplained in its Proposed Finding and Final Determination, the evidence proffered by the\n\nMuwekma and discussed above has no bearing on the issue of whether external sources\n\nidentified it as a Native American tribe. Moreover, the Court does not discern how it could find\n\nthat the Department failed to consider the Muwekma’s “historical circumstances” in assessing its\n\napplication for federal acknowledgment. See Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 36. Indeed, the Muwekma\n\ndoes not explain how “the particularly horrible experience of California tribes,” id., would have\n\naffected its ability to retain documentation of its existence after 1927. 12 Thus, the Court finds\n\nthis argument to be without merit.\n\n         For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the agency’s Final Determination was not\n\narbitrary and capricious and must therefore be upheld.\n\n     C. The Muwekma’s Breach of Fiduciary Duty Claim\n\n         Next, the Muwekma argues that the Department’s recognition of the Verona band in 1927\n\nestablished a trust relationship, that the Department owed the Muwekma fiduciary duties as a\n\nresult of that relationship, and that these duties were breached by the Department. Pl.’s First\n\nMem. at 18. Specifically, the Muwekma argues that “[o]nce the Department recognized [it in\n\n12\n  Indeed, the “horrible” experiences alleged by the Muwekma took place several decades before 1927, the point at\nwhich it was required to produce evidence of its continuing tribal existence. See Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 2 (“During\nthe late nineteenth century, non-Indians were particularly hostile to tribes, seeking out and killing Indians outright,\noften encouraged by local governments.” (emphasis added)).\n\n\n\n                                                           39\n\f1927] . . . as a tribe under its care and supervision, it had a duty to support and preserve the\n\nTribe,” and that the Department “lacked authority . . . to resign from or terminate the trust.” Id.\n\nat 19. Furthermore, the Muwekma argues that even assuming the Department possessed the\n\nauthority “to unilaterally withdraw from the . . . trust relationship . . . , it failed to do so in\n\naccordance with basic principles of fairness and trust responsibility.” Id. at 20.\n\n        The Court is not persuaded by the Muwekma’s position. Even if a trust relationship was\n\ncreated as a result of the federal government’s recognition of the Verona band, the Muwekma’s\n\nargument assumes that it was the Department that withdrew from that relationship. After all, as\n\nJudge Posner noted in Miami Nation of Indians of Indiana, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of the Interior, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773808\"><a href=\"/opinion/773808/miami-nation-of-indians-of-indiana-inc-v-united-states-department-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">255</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">342</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 346 (7th Cir. 2001), “[i]t is . . . obvious that Indian nations, like foreign nations, can\n\ndisappear over time . . . whether through conquest, or voluntary absorption into a larger entity, or\n\nfission, or dissolution, or movement of population.” Should a tribe cease to exist, it follows that\n\nthe federal government would no longer have a trust relationship with that entity. See id. at 350\n\n(“If a nation doesn’t exist, it can’t be recognized”). The Muwekma thus needs to demonstrate it\n\ndid not cease to exist after 1927, and the manner in which the Muwekma is required to prove its\n\nexistence as a tribe is through the Part 83 procedures. See 25 C.F.R. § 83.2 (“The purpose of . . .\n\n[P]art [83] is to establish a departmental procedure and policy for acknowledging that certain\n\nAmerican Indian groups exist as tribes.”). And, because the Court finds that the Department’s\n\ndecision to deny acknowledgment of the Muwekma as a Native American tribe was a legally\n\ndefensible position, the Court also finds that the Department did not owe the Muwekma any\n\nfiduciary duties after 1927, and that any purported breach asserted by the Muwekma after this\n\ndate is without merit.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    40\n\f     D. The Due Process Claim\n\n        The Muwekma argues that “[t]he Department’s application of 25 C.F.R. [§] 83 failed to\n\nafford [it] due process for the withdrawal of recognition.” Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 31.\n\nSpecifically, the Muwekma asserts that “[t]he right to continued recognition, including the\n\nassociated services, protections[,] and financial benefits, once the right has been established, is a\n\nproperty right that cannot be revoked without due process.” Id. at 30. The Muwekma argues\n\nthat “[t]he hallmarks of procedural due process—notice, opportunity to be heard, and an\n\nimpartial decision[]maker—were entirely lacking in the Department’s procedures,” and while the\n\nMuwekma acknowledges being consulted in the decision by the Department’s staff, the\n\nDepartment did not provide it a formal hearing. Id. at 32. Furthermore, the Muwekma\n\ncomplains that it was not afforded an “opportunity to cross-examine the staff professionals who\n\ndeveloped and interpreted [the] evidence against [it].” Id. The Court finds this claim meritless. 13\n\n        The Muwekma’s due process claim cannot be maintained due to the Muwekma’s failure\n\nto demonstrate that it possessed a property right in its prior acknowledgment. As noted above,\n\nthe Seventh Circuit has recognized that “[i]t is . . . obvious that Indian nations, like foreign\n\nnations, can disappear over time . . . whether through conquest, or voluntary absorption into a\n\nlarger entity, or fission, or dissolution, or movement of population.” Miami Nation, 255 F.3d at\n\n346. Whether the Verona band continued to exist as an entity after 1927 and whether the\n\nMuwekma’s property right in federal acknowledgment ceased to exist along with the entity itself\n\nat the moment of dissolution are both questions the Department had to address. And it was the\n\nMuwekma’s burden to establish that, in fact, it continued to exist as a tribe after 1927 through\n\n13\n  Given that this claim is based on the purported “withdrawal of recognition” by the Department, it appears to the\nCourt that this claim is seemingly also barred by the statute of limitations. See supra at 34. The Department,\nhowever, does not argue anywhere in its submissions that the Muwekma’s due process claim is barred by the statute\nof limitations, and thus the Court will not make that determination.\n\n\n\n                                                       41\n\fthe Part 83 procedures.

Having failed to meet this burden, the Muwekma has failed to\n\nestablish that the Department violated the Due Process Clause in issuing its Final Determination.\n\n   E. The Muwekma’s Conflict-of-Interest Claim\n\n       The Muwekma argues that the Department violated 5 U.S.C. § 554(d) by allowing “one\n\nof its attorney[-]advisors” to advise the Department concerning its “decision on the merits of\n\nMuwekma’s petition for recognition,” and to also allow the same attorney-advisor to “represent[]\n\nthe Department in the Muwekma v. Babbitt litigation” that took place before Judge Urbina. Pl.’s\n\nFirst Mem. at 33. This argument rests on a misinterpretation of the APA. The various\n\nsubparagraphs of Section 554 apply only to “every case of adjudication required by statute to be\n\ndetermined on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing.” 5 U.S.C. § 554(d). Here, the\n\nMuwekma does not cite, nor is the Court aware of, a statute that requires the Department to\n\nprovide a hearing to an applicant seeking acknowledgment as a Native American tribe. Thus,\n\nSection 554(d) has no application to this case.\n\n   F. The Muwekma’s Equal Protection Claim\n\n       Finally, the Muwekma argues that the Department “violated [the E]qual [P]rotection\n\n[Clause] and the APA by restoring two similarly situated California tribes based on a lower\n\nevidentiary standard while denying” the Muwekma the opportunity to seek recognition under the\n\nsame standard. Pl.’s First SJ Mem. at 21-22. Both the Equal Protection Clause and the APA\n\nprohibit agencies from treating similarly situated petitioners differently without providing a\n\nsufficiently reasoned justification for the disparate treatment.

Indeed, “the Court’s review [was] limited to the administrative record,” Fund for\n\nAnimals, 903 F. Supp. at 105 (citing Camp, 411 U.S. at 142), and, as the Court noted numerous\n\ntimes in the September 21, 2006 Memorandum Opinion, the record did not reveal any\n\nconsideration by the Department of whether the Muwekma was entitled to the same waiver of\n\nthe Part 83 procedures that was granted to both the Lower Lake and the Ione, see Muwekma, 452\n\nF.

Without running\n\nafoul of well-settled law circumscribing this Court’s review of the Department’s Final\n\nDetermination, the Court could not have decided the question of whether the Muwekma, Lower\n\nLake, and Ione were “similarly situated.” Thus, contrary to the Court’s observations in the\n\nSeptember 30, 2008 Order, the Department was instructed on remand to address whether the\n\nseveral tribes were similarly situated, and it necessarily could make that assessment only by\n\nreviewing the record evidence.\n\n        Consequently, the Court must review the Department’s supplement to the administrative\n\nrecord to determine whether the agency provided an adequate explanation “why it chose to do\n\nwhat it did,” Tourus Records, Inc. v.

And, the Court now finds the Department’s explanation sufficient. The Department\n\nexplained that the record reflects a “pattern of federal dealings with the Lower Lake and Ione\n\nwhich evidences their long-standing and continuing governmental relationship with the United\n\nStates,” whereas, the Muwekma had no such interactions with the Federal Government. 14 Defs.’\n\nSecond SJ Mem at 8.\n\n        With regard to the Lower Lake, the Department noted that “[t]he Federal Government\n\npurchased land to establish the Lower Lake Rancheria on January 25, 1916,” and that “[t]he\n\n[G]overnment held this land in trust until the Act of 1956 authorized its sale.” Id. The\n\n\n\n14\n  The Department also argues that the Muwekma is not similarly situated to the Lower Lake and the Ione because it\n“lacks collective rights in lands.” Defs.’ Second SJ Mem. at 13. The Court need not assess the merits of this\ncontention, however, because it finds that the Muwekma’s lack of interactions as an entity with the federal\ngovernment is sufficient to support the Department’s conclusion that the Muwekma is not similarly situated to the\nLower Lake and Ione tribes.\n\n\n\n                                                       45\n\fDepartment also cited other instances demonstrating communications and dealings between the\n\nfederal government and the Lower Lake. See id. (citing various reports that contained a\n\n“recommend[ation] that land be purchased for the Lower Lake band,” a recommendation “to\n\nacquire additional land for the band and other small groups,” and an observation noting “the\n\nexistence of a Lower Lake group living off the rancheria”). The Department also noted that the\n\nLower Lake had been identified by the federal government on two separate instances—in 1953,\n\nwhen the United States “House of Representatives listed the Lower Lake Rancheria” in House\n\nReport 2503, and in 1980, when “the BIA central office and regional office considered including\n\nthe Lower Lake Rancheria on the list of federally recognized tribes, but did not do so.” Id.\n\nBased on these interactions with the federal government and the earlier references to it as an\n\nentity, the Court has no basis for finding that the Department’s conclusion that the “Lower Lake\n\nand Muwekma were not similarly situated,” id. at 6, is arbitrary and capricious.\n\n        Likewise, the supplement to the administrative record also identifies a history of dealings\n\nbetween the federal government and the Ione. In 1915, a special agent for the BIA identified the\n\nIone in a census conducted by the agency, and that “[t]he [f]ederal [g]overnment attempted to\n\npurchase land for” the Ione at that time. Id. at 7. The Department then noted that “the Indian\n\nOffice obtained a deed and abstract of title for the purchase of land for the Ione[,] . . . and the\n\nDepartment provided the Office with a formal “Authority” for the purchase. Id. Documents in\n\nthe record also reflect the federal government’s “extensive, but unsuccessful, effort[] to clear title\n\nto the land for the” Ione from 1915-1925. Id. The record further reveals efforts made by the\n\nIone to inquire as to the status of its tribal lands. See id. at 7-8 (noting that “[i]n 1941, the\n\nDepartment considered a petition from the ‘Indians of the Ione Valley’ requesting the purchase\n\nof land,” and that “[i]n 1970, two Ione individuals contacted the BIA about the status of the land\n\n\n\n\n                                                   46\n\fon which they lived,” and subsequently “the California Rural Indian Land Project . . . of the\n\nCalifornia Indian Legal Services proposed bringing a quiet[-]title action on behalf of the Ione\n\nBand . . . and requesting that the land be accepted and held in trust”). The Court finds these\n\nfacts, which the Department found to have evidenced a “historical circumstance of an\n\nuncompleted acquisition of trust land on the [Ione’s] behalf,” sufficient to differentiate the Ione\n\nfrom the Muwekma.\n\n       The Muwekma argues, however, that there is actually no longstanding pattern of federal\n\ndealings between the federal government and the Ione and the Lower Lake because the record\n\nreflects “large periods of time in which [the Department] had no relationship with Ione or Lower\n\nLake.” Pl.’s Reply to Second SJ Mem. at 7. The Muwekma’s argument misses the point.\n\nUnlike the evidence proffered by the Muwekma, which at best demonstrated interactions\n\nbetween the federal government and individuals that descended from the Verona band, the\n\nevidence in the supplemental administrative record reflects dealings between the federal\n\ngovernment and the Ione and Lower Lake tribes as entities. The Department viewed its\n\ninteractions with the Ione and Lower Lake tribes as evidence that the federal government dealt\n\nwith these entities as tribes, and thus concluded that it was appropriate to acknowledge these\n\ntribes outside of the Part 83 process. Thus, the Department’s conclusion that the Muwekma was\n\nnot “similarly situated” to the Ione and Lower Lake must be upheld.\n\n                                        IV.     Conclusion\n\n       Despite the Muwekma’s efforts to raise a smorgasbord of claims in an attempt to reverse\n\nthe Department’s Final Determination, the Court finds that there exists no basis upon which it\n\nmay overturn the agency’s findings. Accordingly, the Court must grant the Department’s cross-\n\nmotion for summary judgment, and deny the Muwekma’s motion for summary judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 47\n\f        SO ORDERED this 28th day of September, 2011. 15\n\n\n                                                                   REGGIE B. WALTON\n                                                                   United States District Judge\n\n\n\n\n15\n  An Order will be issued contemporaneously with this Memorandum Opinion (1) granting the Department’s cross-\nmotion for summary judgment, (2) denying the Muwekma’s motion for summary judgment, (3) closing this case,\nand (4) denying the Muwekma’s Motion for Status Conference, which the Court deems as moot in light of the\nforegoing rulings.\n\n\n\n                                                     48\n\f</pre>",
