Fry, Esq.\nArcher & Greiner\n1650 Market Street\nOne Liberty Place, 32nd Floor\nPhiladelphia, PA 19103\n       Counsel for Appellee\n\nSHWARTZ, Circuit Judge.\n\n       In 2013, a Pennsylvania court held that the statute authorizing the Philadelphia\n\nParking Authority (“PPA”) to charge taxicab operators an annual fee violated, among\n\nother things, due process. Two Philadelphia taxicab companies, Z&R Cab, LLC and\n\nZoro, Inc. (collectively, the “Cab Companies”), thereafter filed suit in the District Court\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 seeking a full refund of the fees they had paid. The District\n\nCourt dismissed their case for lack of jurisdiction. We conclude that the District Court\n\nhad jurisdiction. Thus, we will vacate the dismissal order and remand.\n\n                                              I\n\n       In 2004, Pennsylvania’s General Assembly amended the Parking Authority Law\n\n(“PAL”), transferring regulatory responsibility for certain taxicab and limousine\n\noperators in Philadelphia to the PPA. The PAL funded the PPA’s regulatory activities\n\nwith fees operators paid, 53 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. § 5708(b),1 and provided that the PPA\n\nwould annually submit a proposed fee schedule to the General Assembly, which would\n\nbecome effective if the legislature did not disapprove it, id. § 5707(b). The PAL also\n\nsubjected operators to fines, vehicle impoundment, and revocation of their operating\n\nlicenses for unpaid fees.\n\n       1\n           References to the PAL are to the version in effect from 2004 to 2013.\n                                              2\n\f       In 2012, several taxicab operators refused to pay the fees, were cited by the PPA,\n\nand challenged the constitutionality of the PAL in state court. In an opinion summarily\n\naffirmed by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, the Commonwealth Court declared the law\n\n“unconstitutional and unenforceable” because, among other things, it did not permit\n\ntaxicab operators to challenge the fees and imposed penalties for non-payment, and thus\n\n“confer[red] autocratic power upon the [PPA] to condemn property without due process”\n\nin violation of the Pennsylvania and United States Constitutions. MCT Transp., Inc. v.\n\nPhila. Parking Auth., 60 A.3d 899, 919-920 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2013) (“MCT”).2\n\n       Soon after the Commonwealth Court’s decision, the Cab Companies filed this\n\nputative class-action complaint on behalf of those entities that “paid to . . . the [PPA] fees\n\nassessed by the authority of [the PAL]” from 2004 through February 14, 2013, App. 41,\n\nseeking a refund of “all sums paid to . . . [the PPA] under authority of [the PAL],” plus\n\ninterest, App. 43.3 The PPA moved to dismiss the complaint under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(b)(6), arguing that the Cab Companies are not entitled to refunds because MCT does\n\nnot apply retroactively under Pennsylvania law. The District Court disagreed and\n\nconcluded that MCT applies retroactively, but held that “the question of appropriate\n\n\n\n\n       2\n         The General Assembly amended the PAL after the Commonwealth Court’s\ndecision. See 53 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. §§ 5707 et seq. in Omnibus Amendments Act of\nJuly 9, 2013, P.L. 455, No. 64. The law now requires that the PPA give taxicab and\nlimousine operators notice of the fees to be assessed, a fifteen-day period in which to\ncontest them, and a hearing. See id.\n       3\n         The Cab Companies also sought equitable relief, which was dismissed.\n                                              3\n\fremedy” is “entrusted to the Pennsylvania state courts,” App. 19, and dismissed the\n\ncomplaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.4\n\n       The Cab Companies moved for reconsideration of the dismissal order.5 The\n\nDistrict Court denied the motion, reiterating that any remedy to be afforded the Cab\n\nCompanies “lies exclusively in the hands of the state courts.” App. 35. As a result, the\n\nDistrict Court reasoned that there was “no case or controversy” for it to adjudicate, so it\n\nlacked subject matter jurisdiction to either entertain or abstain from deciding this case.\n\nApp. 31. The Cab Companies appeal, arguing that the District Court has jurisdiction over\n\ntheir complaint. For its part, the PPA asserts that principles of comity require the federal\n\ncourt to refrain from deciding this case.\n\n                                             II6\n\n                                             A\n\n       We first address the District Court’s conclusion that it lacked subject matter\n\njurisdiction over the Cab Companies’ refund claim.7 The Cab Companies seek\n\n\n       4\n         Less than one week after the District Court’s dismissal, the Cab Companies filed\nan identical complaint in Pennsylvania state court under § 1983, seeking a full refund.\nThis proceeding is ongoing.\n       5\n         The Cab Companies fully briefed their position concerning jurisdiction and\nabstention before the District Court in connection with the motion for reconsideration and\nthus were not prejudiced by the District Court’s initial sua sponte jurisdcitional ruling.\n       6\n         Neither party challenges MCT’s holding that the PAL violated federal due\nprocess or the District Court’s holding that MCT applies retroactively, and thus these\nissues are not before us.\n       7\n         We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. When reviewing a district court’s\n“order dismissing a claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, we exercise plenary\nreview over legal conclusions and review findings of fact for clear error.” White-Squire\nv. U. S. Postal Serv., 592 F.3d 453, 456 (3d Cir. 2010). Likewise, when “a district court\npredicates its denial of reconsideration on an issue of law, our review is plenary, and\n                                              4\n\fcompensation for a federal due process violation under § 1983. Because this claim arises\n\nunder the United States Constitution and federal law, 28 U.S.C. § 1331 grants the District\n\nCourt subject matter jurisdiction. Notwithstanding this statutory authority, the District\n\nCourt concluded, citing McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages & Tobacco,\n\nDepartment of Business Regulation of Florida, 496 U.S. 18 (1990), and Harper v.\n\nVirginia Department of Taxation, 509 U.S. 86 (1993), that it lacked subject matter\n\njurisdiction because the Pennsylvania courts enjoy “exclusive[]” authority to determine\n\nthe appropriate remedy due the Cab Companies, and thus the Cab Companies’ refund\n\nclaim presents no federal “case” or “controversy.” See App. 34-36.\n\n       While in McKesson and Harper the Supreme Court left to state courts the task of\n\nfashioning an appropriate remedy for plaintiffs subjected to unconstitutional state tax\n\nlaws, neither case barred a federal court from doing so. Indeed, in both cases, which\n\ninvolved direct appeals from state courts, the Supreme Court declined to order a specific\n\nremedy and remanded the issue to the state courts out of respect for the state’s “role in\n\nshaping the contours of . . . relief” in this context. McKesson, 496 U.S. at 50; see also\n\nHarper, 509 U.S. at 101-02 (leaving to Virginia courts “the crafting of any appropriate\n\nremedy”). The Court did not categorically bar federal courts from providing such relief,\n\nand in fact acknowledged that it granted such relief in other cases. See id. at 33-36\n\n(noting that in Ward v. Love County Board of Commissioners, 253 U.S. 17, 24 (1920),\n\n\n\n\nwhen it bases its denial on an issue of fact, we review for clear error.” Wiest v. Lynch,\n710 F.3d 121, 128 (3d Cir. 2013). Otherwise, we review the denial of a motion for\nreconsideration for abuse of discretion. Id.\n                                             5\n\fthe Court ordered a remedy for an unconstitutional state tax law). Accordingly, the\n\nDistrict Court erred in concluding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n                                              B\n\n       McKesson and Harper, as well as more recent cases such as Levin v. Commerce\n\nEnergy, Inc., 560 U.S. 413 (2010), and Direct Marketing Association v. Brohl, ___ U.S.\n\n___, ___, 135 S.Ct. 1124, 1134 (2015), do teach, however, that under principles of\n\ncomity, deference should be given to state courts to remedy constitutional violations\n\narising from state revenue-raising laws if adequate state remedies exist.\n\n       While the Levin Court indicated that “[c]omity’s constraint has particular force\n\nwhen lower federal courts are asked to pass on the constitutionality of state taxation of\n\ncommercial activity,” id. at 422, in discussing its preference for permitting states to\n\nfashion an appropriate remedy for challenges to state fiscal laws, it also referenced\n\n“economic legislation,” “tax classifications or other legislative prescriptions,” and “a\n\n[s]tate’s allocation of benefits or burdens,” id. at 426-27, suggesting that this type of\n\ncomity applies outside of tax cases. This is consistent with the Supreme Court’s\n\nexpressed “respect for state functions,” id. at 421, and “reluctance . . . to interfere with\n\nthe [state’s] fiscal operations.” Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v. Huffman, 319 U.S.\n\n293, 298 (1943).\n\n       In light of this language, and the fact that the state court has already ruled on the\n\nconstitutionality of the PAL, which governed a commercial activity in a single city, Levin\n\nsuggests that a federal court may wish to carefully weigh whether to intervene. Levin,\n\n560 U.S. at 425-32 & n. 11 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); see also\n\n                                              6\n\fDirect Marketing 135 S. Ct. at 1132 (comity may cause a court to refrain from deciding a\n\ncase that involves the fiscal operations of state government). Because the District Court\n\nconcluded it lacked jurisdiction and thus did not address whether it should refrain from\n\nadjudicating this case under this doctrine, we will remand to allow it to decide, among\n\nother things, whether comity should be invoked in this case seeking a monetary remedy\n\nfor the imposition of unconstitutional state fees.8\n\n                                             III\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, because the District Court had subject matter\n\njurisdiction over the Cab Companies’ refund claim, we will vacate the dismissal order\n\nand remand for the District Court to consider, among other things, whether it should\n\nrefrain from adjudicating this case under principles of comity.\n\n\n\n\n       8\n          The Levin Court identified several factors a federal court might weigh in\ndeciding whether to refrain, based upon comity, from deciding such a case, namely\nwhether: (1) the challenged law concerned “commercial matters over which” the state\n“enjoys wide regulatory latitude”; (2) the suit requires adjudicating “any fundamental\nright or classification” to which heightened scrutiny applies; (3) the state courts are\n“better positioned than their federal counterparts to correct any violation” and provide a\nremedy; and (4) more than one potential remedy could adequately redress the alleged\nconstitutional defect. Levin, 560 U.S. at 431-32. We leave consideration of these\nfactors, the unique facts of this case, and the applicable case law to the discretion of the\nDistrict Court. See Remington Rand Corp. Del. v. Bus. Sys. Inc., 830 F.2d 1260, 1266\n(3d Cir. 1987).\n                                              7\n\fAMBRO, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment\n\n       I join my colleagues in their holding that subject matter exists. I also agree that if\n\nPPA on remand moves to dismiss on the grounds of comity and the District Court deems\n\nthat argument not waived and meritorious, we would review its decision for abuse of\n\ndiscretion. I write separately, however, to explain why dismissing for comity concerns\n\nwould be, in my view, an error of law and therefore an abuse of discretion. Thus I concur\n\nin the judgment and join all but Part II.B of the majority opinion.\n\n       Several Supreme Court cases address the comity doctrine. Read together, they\n\nstand for the propositions that: (1) the doctrine is not jurisdictional, meaning that a state\n\nmust request its application or it will be deemed waived; and (2) federal courts should\n\nabstain from hearing lawsuits when (a) an adequate state remedy exists, (b) the plaintiff\n\nchallenges a state tax law, and (c) the state may choose among more than one\n\nconstitutionally permissible remedy. The first proposition is beyond debate. See Direct\n\nMktg. Ass’n v. Brohl, 135 S. Ct. 1124, 1134 (2015) (“[T]he comity doctrine is\n\nnonjurisdictional.”). Similarly the requirement in the second proposition of an adequate\n\nstate remedy is clear and is not at issue here, as the plaintiffs may repair to Pennsylvania\n\ncourts. See Nat’l Private Truck Council, Inc. v. Okla. Tax Comm’n, 515 U.S. 582, 587\n\n(1995) (requiring adequate state remedy); Howlett v. Rose, 496 U.S. 356, 367 (1990)\n\n(“Federal law is enforceable in state courts . . . because the Constitution and laws passed\n\npursuant to it are as much laws in the States as laws passed by the state legislature.”).\n\n       The remaining conditions are related. Historically, the comity doctrine has been\n\napplied only to tax cases; the justification for declining to extend it to other contexts,\n\n                                               1\n\fparticularly to suits that challenge regulatory fees, is that states have a great deal of\n\nflexibility in remedying unconstitutional taxes. This range of remedial options (whether\n\nto extend a benefit to an unconstitutionally burdened party, whether to burden an\n\nunconstitutionally benefitted party, or some combination) implicates sensitive questions\n\nof state policy, and the Constitution has no preference among the possible outcomes.\n\nHowever, in many constitutional challenges to state laws or policies, only one remedy, or\n\na suite of possible remedies no more varied than in any typical lawsuit, will satisfy the\n\nConstitution. The comity doctrine is unsuited to cases—such as this one—where state\n\nlegislative prerogatives are not at stake.\n\n       Before describing the comity doctrine in some detail to illustrate why I believe\n\napplying it to this case would be a mistake, I stress that only one remedy is possible here:\n\ndamages. The case before us concerns a procedural due process violation (I presume that\n\nthe Cab Companies will be able to preclude the Commonwealth from arguing that the\n\nchallenged regulatory scheme satisfied the Constitution’s requirements). Although\n\nprocedural due process is a flexible standard, the remedies for violations of it are\n\nstraightforward: equitable relief where appropriate (the Cab Companies concede their\n\nrequest for such relief is moot), and damages if plaintiffs can prove, consistent with\n\nordinary tort principles, that they in fact suffered compensable injuries. Carey v. Piphus,\n\n435 U.S. 247, 259–64 (1978). There is no similarly situated party Pennsylvania could\n\nchoose to burden to remedy the due process violation at issue here, but if the Cab\n\nCompanies lost money specifically because they lacked an opportunity to challenge the\n\nrates the PPA set, they can recover that amount of money. Id. The extent of the damages\n\n                                               2\n\fis open to debate; the Cab Companies demand all the fees paid to the PPA over a decade,\n\nbut it is not clear from the record before us that they will be entitled to nearly that amount\n\nof money. The causal relationship between the due process violation and the amount the\n\nCab Companies paid has yet to be established, and I note that any recovery may be\n\naffected by Pennsylvania’s two-year statute of limitations for § 1983 actions. See Kach v.\n\nHose, 589 F.3d 626, 634 (3d Cir. 2009).\n\n       Whatever sum may be appropriate to cover the Cab Companies’ injury, the\n\ncalculation of damages does not depend on the answer to any sensitive questions of state\n\npolicy. And, as I suggest in greater detail below, “[b]ecause state courts would have no\n\ngreater leeway than federal courts to cure the alleged violation, nothing would be lost in\n\nthe currency of comity or state autonomy by permitting the . . . suit to proceed in a\n\nfederal forum.” Levin v. Commerce Energy, Inc., 560 U.S. 413, 431 (2010).\n\n       I.     The Comity Doctrine Has Only Been Applied to Challenges to Taxes as\n              Unconstitutionally Discriminatory.\n\n       The Supreme Court has discussed the comity doctrine exclusively in the context of\n\nchallenges to state tax laws. Fair Assessment in Real Estate Ass’n v. McNary, 454 U.S.\n\n100 (1981); Nat’l Private Truck Council, 515 U.S. 582; Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U.S. 88\n\n(2004); Levin, 560 U.S. 413; Direct Mktg. Ass’n, 135 S. Ct. 1124. In each of these cases,\n\ncomity barred the suit where a plaintiff challenged a tax as violating a constitutional\n\nguarantee of equal treatment: McNary was an equal protection challenge to an allegedly\n\nirrational discrimination between non-suspect classes of property owners; National\n\nPrivate Truck Council and Direct Marketing were both dormant Commerce Clause cases\n\n\n                                              3\n\fwhereby out-of-state private parties accused states of favoring in-state taxpayers in\n\nviolation of the Constitution’s vesting in Congress the power to regulate interstate\n\ncommerce; and the plaintiff in Levin challenged a state tax under both the Equal\n\nProtection and dormant Commerce Clauses. Under both these Clauses (as well as the\n\nintergovernmental tax immunity doctrine, which prohibits one sovereign from\n\ndiscriminating against subjects of another sovereign in taxation, see Davis v. Mich. Dep’t\n\nof Treasury, 489 U.S. 803, 814 (1989)), an unconstitutional state tax scheme may be\n\nremedied either by burdening an unconstitutionally benefitted party, by benefitting an\n\nunconstitutionally burdened party, or by some combination of the two. Hibbs, the only\n\nrecent Supreme Court case to hold that comity did not bar a tax suit, concerned an alleged\n\nEstablishment Clause violation, and the only available remedy was annulling the\n\nchallenged tax credit. Levin, 560 U.S. at 431 (2010).\n\n       The comity doctrine got its start in McNary, when the Supreme Court was faced\n\nwith a conflict between a line of cases under § 1983 holding “that a litigant challenging\n\nthe constitutionality of any state action may proceed directly to federal court,” 455 U.S.\n\nat 102, and another line where “the comity principle . . . bars at least federal injunctive\n\nchallenges to state tax laws,” id. McNary modestly extended the comity principle to bar\n\nsuits seeking damages in challenges to state tax laws that violate a principle of equal\n\ntreatment. The Court based its holding on how “disruptive of Missouri’s tax system” it\n\nwould be to allow the suit to proceed, id. at 113–15, and it held explicitly “that taxpayers\n\nare barred by the principle of comity from asserting § 1983 actions against the validity of\n\nstate tax systems in federal courts,” id. at 116 (emphases added). Lest there be any doubt\n\n                                              4\n\fthat McNary was a tax case, its author, Chief Justice Rehnquist, wrote of the case, “Our\n\ndecision that such suits must be brought in state court was driven by the unique and\n\nsensitive interests at stake when federal courts confront claims that States acted\n\nimpermissibly in administering their own tax systems.” San Remo Hotel, L.P. v. San\n\nFrancisco, 545 U.S. 323, 350 (2005) (Rehnquist, C.J., concurring in the judgment)\n\n(emphases added).\n\n       National Private Truck Council again considered the scope of § 1983, interpreting\n\nthe statute “in light of the strong background principle against federal interference with\n\nstate taxation.” 515 U.S. at 589. In doing so, the Court characterized the Tax Injunction\n\nAct “as but a partial codification of the federal reluctance to interfere with state taxation,”\n\nid. at 590, and reasoned that “because of principles of comity and federalism, Congress\n\nnever authorized federal courts to entertain damages actions under § 1983 against state\n\ntaxes when state law furnishes an adequate legal remedy,” id. at 587 (emphasis added).\n\nThus, National Private Truck Council provides no sound basis for extending the comity\n\ndoctrine beyond the state tax context.\n\n       The doctrine of comity has not spread far from its historical roots in the reluctance\n\nto interfere with state tax laws. The reason for the consistency in the doctrine is that the\n\nConstitution and § 1983 do not command a specific remedy for unconstitutionally\n\ndiscriminatory taxes, an unusual circumstance discussed below.\n\n       II.    Remedial Flexibility Explains Why the Comity Doctrine Is Confined to\n              Tax Cases.\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f       The Supreme Court’s development of the comity doctrine has tethered the\n\nhistorical basis relied on in National Private Truck Council and McNary to the logical\n\nand practical post of remedial flexibility. States may remedy constitutional violations\n\nwith minimal federal supervision in cases involving the dormant Commerce Clause, the\n\nintergovernmental tax immunity doctrine, and the Equal Protection Clause (when there is\n\nno suspect classification) because these are all requirements of nondiscrimination. In\n\nremedying any constitutional infirmity in these cases, the Constitution is indifferent about\n\nwhether a state extends or contracts a burden or a benefit (or does some combination\n\nthereof).\n\n       Hibbs v. Winn, the next relevant case, is less important by itself than for how Levin\n\nlater treated it. Hibbs involved an Establishment Clause challenge to an Arizona tax\n\nprogram that effectively allowed taxpayers to divert taxes to religious schools. In a\n\nfootnote, the Court considered the argument that the case should be dismissed under the\n\ncomity doctrine and rejected it, as the plaintiffs did not seek “district-court aid in order to\n\narrest or countermand state tax collection.” Hibbs, 542 U.S. at 107 n.9. Relying on this\n\nfootnote, the Levin plaintiffs, challenging under the Equal Protection and dormant\n\nCommerce Clauses a tax law that did not implicate a fundamental right or a suspect class,\n\ncreatively requested the district court not to lower their own tax burden but to raise that of\n\ntheir competitors.\n\n       Levin distinguished Hibbs with reasoning that forecloses a comity challenge to the\n\nCab Companies’ suit here. It first noted that the statute at issue, one that taxed differently\n\npublic utilities and independent corporations that provided natural gas, was “economic\n\n                                               6\n\flegislation [that] does not employ classifications subject to heightened scrutiny or\n\nimpinge on fundamental rights.” 560 U.S. at 426. The Court then underscored that “in\n\ntaxation, even more than in other fields, legislatures possess the greatest freedom in\n\nclassification.” Id.\n\n       Next, the Court stressed that “[o]f key importance, when unlawful discrimination\n\ninfects tax classifications or other legislative prescriptions, the Constitution simply calls\n\nfor equal treatment. How equality is accomplished—by extension or invalidation of the\n\nunequally distributed benefit or burden, or some other measure—is a matter on which the\n\nConstitution is silent.” Levin, 560 U.S. at 426–27 (first emphasis added). The Court\n\ndeveloped this theme at length. It discussed how the remedy sought by the challengers in\n\nLevin could interfere with Ohio’s legislative prerogatives in a way the Constitution did\n\nnot command. Id. at 429. And it reiterated that, in Hibbs and in prior cases that had\n\nchallenged state allocations of tax revenue to maintain racially segregated schools, “only\n\none remedy would redress the plaintiffs’ grievance: invalidation of the credit. . . .\n\nBecause state courts would have no greater leeway than federal courts to cure the alleged\n\nviolation, nothing would be lost in the currency of comity or state autonomy by\n\npermitting the Hibbs suit to proceed in a federal forum.” Id. at 431. The constitutional\n\ncommand of equal treatment, and nothing more, was also present in National Private\n\nTruck Council and McNary, discussed above, as well as in Harper v. Virginia\n\nDepartment of Taxation, 509 U.S. 86 (1993), and McKesson v. Division of Alcoholic\n\nBeverages & Tobacco, 496 U.S. 18 (1990), the cases the District Court cited in\n\ndismissing this suit.\n\n                                              7\n\f       Remedial flexibility synthesizes the Supreme Court’s comity cases: informed by a\n\nhistorical reluctance to upend state tax systems, when a constitutional violation does not\n\nrequire a specific remedy and the available choices implicate sensitive policy questions\n\nbest left up to state governments, the federal courts will not interfere. However, § 1983\n\nauthorizes, indeed commands, federal courts to interfere in state policymaking that\n\nviolates individual rights if a specific remedy to the plaintiff is required.\n\n       A contrary reading of the comity doctrine would be difficult—dare I write\n\nimpossible—to square with the well-established narrowness of the traditional abstention\n\ndoctrines, which clearly do not apply to this case. In particular, if comity were extended\n\nto every case where a plaintiff challenged a state practice implicating revenue generation,\n\nBurford abstention would become irrelevant. See Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315\n\n(1943). It allows district courts to decline to hear suits that would result in repeated\n\nfederal intervention in a complex regulatory scheme and concomitant confusion\n\nthroughout state government. Id. at 327–34; see also New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc. v.\n\nNew Orleans, 491 U.S. 350, 361 (1989) (outlining cases where Burford abstention is\n\nappropriate). If the comity doctrine were extended to cases like this one, any suit from\n\nwhich a federal court could abstain under Burford would much more easily be dismissed\n\non comity grounds, a result hardly consistent with the Supreme Court’s admonition that\n\nthere is only a “narrow range of circumstances in which Burford can justify the dismissal\n\nof a federal action.” Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517 U.S. 706, 726 (1996).1\n\n\n1\n Nor are the other abstention doctrines relevant. Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971),\napplies when a District Court is asked to enjoin an ongoing state criminal case; Railroad\n                                               8\n\f       III.   Even If the Comity Doctrine Should Be Extended, It May Not Be\n              Stretched to This Case.\n\n       In the recent case of Direct Marketing Ass’n v. Brohl, the Supreme Court\n\ndiscussed how the Tax Injunction Act did not apply to a challenge to state law reporting\n\nrequirements that would affect tax collection, but it left open the question of whether the\n\n“nonjuristictional” comity doctrine would nonetheless bar the suit. 135 S. Ct. 1124,\n\n1133–34 (2015). Although “the comity doctrine is more embracive than the” Tax\n\nInjunction Act, Levin, 560 U.S. at 424, it is not wide enough to capture this case. This is\n\nin part because the comity doctrine is about the scope of § 1983; National Private Truck\n\nCouncil makes that clear, and it helps explain why the Court allowed the tax suit in\n\nHibbs, an Establishment Clause challenge, and in the cases involving tax benefits to\n\nsegregated schools. Those individual rights—like the right not to be deprived of property\n\nwithout due process of law—are at the core of § 1983 protection, in areas where federal\n\nsupervision is particularly important, whereas dormant Commerce Clause,\n\nintergovernmental tax immunity, and equal protection challenges to tax classifications\n\n\n\n\nCommission v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496 (1941), comes into play when an interpretation\nof state law may moot a federal constitutional case; and Colorado River Water\nConservation District v. United States, 424 U.S. 800 (1976), becomes pertinent when\nthere are parallel federal and state civil cases and four factors (which case was filed first,\nwhether the federal forum is convenient for the parties, whether there is in rem\njurisdiction, and whether there is a risk of piecemeal litigation that cannot be averted by\nissue preclusion) balance in favor of abstention. Younger and Pullman plainly don’t\napply, and the Colorado River factors weigh in favor of exercising jurisdiction: although\nthe Cab Companies have filed a parallel state suit, the federal case came first, the Eastern\nDistrict of Pennsylvania is convenient to the parties (all operate in and around\nPhiladelphia), there is no in rem jurisdiction here, and issue preclusion can likely attach\nto whatever judgment comes first.\n                                              9\n\fthat do not single out disenfranchised populations were less likely in Congress’s mind\n\nwhen it passed the Civil Rights Act of 1871.\n\n       Comity also should not apply here because the Constitution, enforced through\n\n§ 1983, commands a specific remedy (assuming the Cab Companies incurred damages\n\nbecause of a procedural due process violation), unlike in the tax-discrimination cases\n\nwhere a range of remedial options among which the Constitution has no preference can\n\ncure the relevant deficiency. Finally, as McNary, Levin, and National Private Truck\n\nCouncil confirm, the comity doctrine is important “particularly in the area of state\n\ntaxation.” McNary, 454 U.S. at 103 (emphasis added); see also Levin, 560 U.S. at 421\n\n(“Comity’s constraint has particular force when lower federal courts are asked to pass on\n\nthe constitutionality of state taxation of commercial activity.”); Nat’l Private Truck\n\nCouncil, 515 U.S. at 587 (1995) (discussing “longstanding federal reluctance to interfere\n\nwith state taxation”).\n\n       The strongest argument that the Commonwealth could raise here for the District\n\nCourt to favor Pennsylvania courts would be based on a simplistic reading of one\n\nparagraph in Levin. There the Supreme Court concluded its discussion of the comity\n\ndoctrine with sentences that the majority opinion’s eighth footnote rearranges and\n\ndecontextualizes:\n\n       First, respondents seek federal-court review of commercial matters over\n       which Ohio enjoys wide regulatory latitude; their suit does not involve any\n       fundamental right or classification that attracts heightened judicial scrutiny.\n       Second, while respondents portray themselves as third-party challengers to\n       an allegedly unconstitutional tax scheme, they are in fact seeking federal-\n       court aid in an endeavor to improve their competitive position. Third, the\n       Ohio courts are better positioned than their federal counterparts to correct\n\n                                             10\n\f       any violation because they are more familiar with state legislative\n       preferences and because the [Tax Injunction Act] does not constrain their\n       remedial options.\n\nLevin, 560 U.S. at 431–32. I do not, as my colleagues appear to suggest, believe these\n\nremarks created a multi-factor test that should be applied mechanistically to future cases;\n\nrather, I view them as a summary of a long opinion that turns on two key facts: (1) Levin\n\nwas a tax case, and (2) if the challenged tax was unconstitutional, the state could remedy\n\nits violation either by raising taxes for the plaintiffs’ competitors, lowering them for\n\nplaintiffs, or some combination.\n\n       Even if Levin created a multi-factor test to be applied to any challenge to any state\n\nlaw, those factors do not counsel in favor of dismissal here. It is true that the Cab\n\nCompanies seek review of a commercial statute, but, as for the second factor, they are not\n\nseeking to improve their “competitive position” because there are not similarly situated\n\ncompetitors unburdened by the PPA’s regulation. Third, and relatedly, although the\n\nremedial options in any lawsuit may be broad, they are not flexible in this case in the\n\nsame way that they are in tax cases where a state is to reapportion taxes among the\n\nclasses that must be treated equally.\n\n       IV.    The Circuit Courts and the “Fees v. Taxes” Line of Cases\n\n       For the reasons set forth above, I conclude that the Supreme Court’s comity\n\njurisprudence counsels federal courts against dismissing cases on comity grounds unless\n\na state seeks application of the doctrine, the plaintiff challenges a tax, and a range of\n\nremedial options is available to the state should a court deem the tax unconstitutional.\n\nAnd I am in good company. Every court of appeals to address the question has applied\n\n                                              11\n\fcomity only in state tax cases where an adequate state remedy exists. Taxes aside,\n\nfederal courts must exercise their “virtually unflagging obligation . . . to exercise the\n\njurisdiction given them,” Colorado River, 424 U.S. at 817, when presented with\n\nconstitutional challenges to regulatory fees. The cases describe “taxes” as generally\n\nimposed by a legislature, assessed against a broad class of people or entities, and used for\n\ngeneral public purposes, while “regulatory fees” are usually imposed by an agency,\n\nassessed against a narrow class of persons, and used for the benefit or regulation of those\n\nwho pay. See DIRECTV, Inc. v. Tolson, 513 F.3d 119, 125–26 (4th Cir. 2008); Marcus v.\n\nKan. Dep’t of Revenue, 170 F.3d 1305, 1311 (10th Cir. 1999) (conflating comity and Tax\n\nInjunction Act and distinguishing between fees and taxes); see also Kathrein v. Evanston,\n\n752 F.3d 680, 688–87 (7th Cir. 2014) (adopting distinction between fees and taxes under\n\ncomity doctrine, but applying different test to determine whether exaction is fee or tax).\n\nAnd several district courts have properly entertained challenges to regulatory fees despite\n\nmotions to dismiss based on comity. Pac. Bell Tel. Co. v. City of Hawthorne, 188 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 1169, 1177 (C.D. Cal. 2001); Attorneys’ Liab. Assurance Soc’y v. Fitzgerald,\n\n174 F. Supp. 2d 619, 629 (W.D. Mich. 2001); Diginet, Inc. v. W. Union ATS, Inc., 845 F.\n\nSupp. 1237, 1242 (N.D. Ill. 1994).2\n\n\n2\n The one case where a district court dismissed a challenge to regulatory fees on a comity\nground involved a dormant Commerce Clause challenge. Valero Terrestrial Corp. v.\nCallaghan, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17490 (N.D. W. Va. Sept. 28, 1995), vacated in part\non other grounds sub nom. Valero Terrestrial Corp. v. McCoy, 50 F. Supp. 2d 564 (N.D.\nW. Va. 1999), and further vacated on other grounds sub nom. Valero Terrestrial Corp. v.\nPaige, 211 F.3d 112, 122 (4th Cir. 2000). Valero presented a far better vehicle for\nexpanding the comity doctrine than our case because there the state had multiple remedial\noptions just as in the tax cases. Nonetheless, it was probably wrongly decided. Scott v.\n                                              12\n\f       Appellees concede that the policy challenged here involves collection of\n\nregulatory fees, but they argue that distinguishing between fees and taxes is arid\n\nformalism. I disagree. First, the comity doctrine of the McNary–Levin line has\n\ndeveloped exclusively in the state-tax context, and the cases emphasize specifically “the\n\nfederal reluctance to interfere with state taxation.” Levin, 560 U.S. at 424 (quoting Nat’l\n\nPrivate Truck Council, 515 U.S. at 590). Second, refraining from federal interference\n\nmakes particular sense in the tax context because of the remedial flexibility discussed\n\nabove and stressed in Levin.\n\n       It is hard for me to imagine (and no court has suggested) a limiting principle to\n\ncomity other than the historical reluctance to interfere with taxes and the related remedial\n\nflexibility. All § 1983 cases affect the public fisc directly or indirectly, and expanding\n\ncomity to our case would, it seems to me, mean that the doctrine would bar any suit\n\nagainst a state practice that is subject to rational basis review, a radical curtailment of the\n\nscope of § 1983 unsupported by cases from any level of the federal judiciary.\n\n                                *      *       *      *       *\n\n       No court, let alone the Supreme Court, has suggested that the comity doctrine is as\n\nbroad as the majority’s selective quotations from Levin and other similarly off-point cases\n\nimply.3 Given that a focus on remedial flexibility and the historical practice of not\n\n\nDonald, 165 U.S. 58, 101 (1897) (affirming a federal court’s award of damages incurred\nby violation of the dormant Commerce Clause).\n3\n  Particularly perplexing is the majority’s decision to quote Levin’s language about “other\nlegislative prescriptions” as suggesting that maybe comity could apply here. 456 U.S. at\nat 426. Let’s read the rest of the sentence (again): “Of key importance, when unlawful\ndiscrimination infects tax classifications or other legislative prescriptions, the\n                                              13\n\finterfering with state tax laws harmonizes the Supreme Court’s comity and Tax\n\nInjunction Act cases as well as the solid wall of other courts of appeals’ authority on the\n\ndistinction between regulatory fees and taxes, I would adopt the distinction between fees\n\nand taxes and conclude that comity should not bar the Cab Companies’ suit here. I would\n\nthus vacate the judgment of the District Court and remand the case with instructions not\n\nto consider the red herring called the comity doctrine.\n\n\n\n\nConstitution simply calls for equal treatment.” Id. (first two emphases added). This\nsentence alone exposes the impropriety of applying comity here, all the more so when\nread in light of a doctrine that has only been applied in the discriminatory tax context\n(excepting the Northern District of West Virginia, which erroneously, but at least\narguably plausibly, extended the doctrine to a different context calling for equal\ntreatment, see supra n.2).\n                                             14\n\f",

Fry, Esq.\nArcher & Greiner\n1650 Market Street\nOne Liberty Place, 32nd Floor\nPhiladelphia, PA 19103\n       Counsel for Appellee\n\nSHWARTZ, Circuit Judge.\n\n       In 2013, a Pennsylvania court held that the statute authorizing the Philadelphia\n\nParking Authority (“PPA”) to charge taxicab operators an annual fee violated, among\n\nother things, due process. Two Philadelphia taxicab companies, Z&R Cab, LLC and\n\nZoro, Inc. (collectively, the “Cab Companies”), thereafter filed suit in the District Court\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 seeking a full refund of the fees they had paid. The District\n\nCourt dismissed their case for lack of jurisdiction. We conclude that the District Court\n\nhad jurisdiction. Thus, we will vacate the dismissal order and remand.\n\n                                              I\n\n       In 2004, Pennsylvania’s General Assembly amended the Parking Authority Law\n\n(“PAL”), transferring regulatory responsibility for certain taxicab and limousine\n\noperators in Philadelphia to the PPA. The PAL funded the PPA’s regulatory activities\n\nwith fees operators paid, 53 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. § 5708(b),1 and provided that the PPA\n\nwould annually submit a proposed fee schedule to the General Assembly, which would\n\nbecome effective if the legislature did not disapprove it, id. § 5707(b). The PAL also\n\nsubjected operators to fines, vehicle impoundment, and revocation of their operating\n\nlicenses for unpaid fees.\n\n       1\n           References to the PAL are to the version in effect from 2004 to 2013.\n                                              2\n\f       In 2012, several taxicab operators refused to pay the fees, were cited by the PPA,\n\nand challenged the constitutionality of the PAL in state court. In an opinion summarily\n\naffirmed by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, the Commonwealth Court declared the law\n\n“unconstitutional and unenforceable” because, among other things, it did not permit\n\ntaxicab operators to challenge the fees and imposed penalties for non-payment, and thus\n\n“confer[red] autocratic power upon the [PPA] to condemn property without due process”\n\nin violation of the Pennsylvania and United States Constitutions.

Historically, the comity doctrine has been\n\napplied only to tax cases; the justification for declining to extend it to other contexts,\n\n                                               1\n\fparticularly to suits that challenge regulatory fees, is that states have a great deal of\n\nflexibility in remedying unconstitutional taxes. This range of remedial options (whether\n\nto extend a benefit to an unconstitutionally burdened party, whether to burden an\n\nunconstitutionally benefitted party, or some combination) implicates sensitive questions\n\nof state policy, and the Constitution has no preference among the possible outcomes.\n\nHowever, in many constitutional challenges to state laws or policies, only one remedy, or\n\na suite of possible remedies no more varied than in any typical lawsuit, will satisfy the\n\nConstitution. The comity doctrine is unsuited to cases—such as this one—where state\n\nlegislative prerogatives are not at stake.\n\n       Before describing the comity doctrine in some detail to illustrate why I believe\n\napplying it to this case would be a mistake, I stress that only one remedy is possible here:\n\ndamages. The case before us concerns a procedural due process violation (I presume that\n\nthe Cab Companies will be able to preclude the Commonwealth from arguing that the\n\nchallenged regulatory scheme satisfied the Constitution’s requirements). Although\n\nprocedural due process is a flexible standard, the remedies for violations of it are\n\nstraightforward: equitable relief where appropriate (the Cab Companies concede their\n\nrequest for such relief is moot), and damages if plaintiffs can prove, consistent with\n\nordinary tort principles, that they in fact suffered compensable injuries. Carey v. Piphus,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109815\"><a href=\"/opinion/109815/carey-v-piphus/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 259–64 (1978). There is no similarly situated party Pennsylvania could\n\nchoose to burden to remedy the due process violation at issue here, but if the Cab\n\nCompanies lost money specifically because they lacked an opportunity to challenge the\n\nrates the PPA set, they can recover that amount of money. Id. The extent of the damages\n\n                                               2\n\fis open to debate; the Cab Companies demand all the fees paid to the PPA over a decade,\n\nbut it is not clear from the record before us that they will be entitled to nearly that amount\n\nof money. The causal relationship between the due process violation and the amount the\n\nCab Companies paid has yet to be established, and I note that any recovery may be\n\naffected by Pennsylvania’s two-year statute of limitations for § 1983 actions.

And, as I suggest in greater detail below, “[b]ecause state courts would have no\n\ngreater leeway than federal courts to cure the alleged violation, nothing would be lost in\n\nthe currency of comity or state autonomy by permitting the . . . suit to proceed in a\n\nfederal forum.” Levin v.

Hibbs, the only\n\nrecent Supreme Court case to hold that comity did not bar a tax suit, concerned an alleged\n\nEstablishment Clause violation, and the only available remedy was annulling the\n\nchallenged tax credit. Levin, 560 U.S. at 431 (2010).\n\n       The comity doctrine got its start in McNary, when the Supreme Court was faced\n\nwith a conflict between a line of cases under § 1983 holding “that a litigant challenging\n\nthe constitutionality of any state action may proceed directly to federal court,” 455 U.S.\n\nat 102, and another line where “the comity principle . . . bars at least federal injunctive\n\nchallenges to state tax laws,” id. McNary modestly extended the comity principle to bar\n\nsuits seeking damages in challenges to state tax laws that violate a principle of equal\n\ntreatment. The Court based its holding on how “disruptive of Missouri’s tax system” it\n\nwould be to allow the suit to proceed, id. at 113–15, and it held explicitly “that taxpayers\n\nare barred by the principle of comity from asserting § 1983 actions against the validity of\n\nstate tax systems in federal courts,” id. at 116 (emphases added).

In doing so, the Court characterized the Tax Injunction\n\nAct “as but a partial codification of the federal reluctance to interfere with state taxation,”\n\nid. at 590, and reasoned that “because of principles of comity and federalism, Congress\n\nnever authorized federal courts to entertain damages actions under § 1983 against state\n\ntaxes when state law furnishes an adequate legal remedy,” id. at 587 (emphasis added).\n\nThus, National Private Truck Council provides no sound basis for extending the comity\n\ndoctrine beyond the state tax context.\n\n       The doctrine of comity has not spread far from its historical roots in the reluctance\n\nto interfere with state tax laws. The reason for the consistency in the doctrine is that the\n\nConstitution and § 1983 do not command a specific remedy for unconstitutionally\n\ndiscriminatory taxes, an unusual circumstance discussed below.\n\n       II.    Remedial Flexibility Explains Why the Comity Doctrine Is Confined to\n              Tax Cases.\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f       The Supreme Court’s development of the comity doctrine has tethered the\n\nhistorical basis relied on in National Private Truck Council and McNary to the logical\n\nand practical post of remedial flexibility. States may remedy constitutional violations\n\nwith minimal federal supervision in cases involving the dormant Commerce Clause, the\n\nintergovernmental tax immunity doctrine, and the Equal Protection Clause (when there is\n\nno suspect classification) because these are all requirements of nondiscrimination. In\n\nremedying any constitutional infirmity in these cases, the Constitution is indifferent about\n\nwhether a state extends or contracts a burden or a benefit (or does some combination\n\nthereof).\n\n       Hibbs v. Winn, the next relevant case, is less important by itself than for how Levin\n\nlater treated it. Hibbs involved an Establishment Clause challenge to an Arizona tax\n\nprogram that effectively allowed taxpayers to divert taxes to religious schools. In a\n\nfootnote, the Court considered the argument that the case should be dismissed under the\n\ncomity doctrine and rejected it, as the plaintiffs did not seek “district-court aid in order to\n\narrest or countermand state tax collection.” Hibbs, 542 U.S. at 107 n.9. Relying on this\n\nfootnote, the Levin plaintiffs, challenging under the Equal Protection and dormant\n\nCommerce Clauses a tax law that did not implicate a fundamental right or a suspect class,\n\ncreatively requested the district court not to lower their own tax burden but to raise that of\n\ntheir competitors.\n\n       Levin distinguished Hibbs with reasoning that forecloses a comity challenge to the\n\nCab Companies’ suit here. It first noted that the statute at issue, one that taxed differently\n\npublic utilities and independent corporations that provided natural gas, was “economic\n\n                                               6\n\flegislation [that] does not employ classifications subject to heightened scrutiny or\n\nimpinge on fundamental rights.” 560 U.S. at 426. The Court then underscored that “in\n\ntaxation, even more than in other fields, legislatures possess the greatest freedom in\n\nclassification.” Id.\n\n       Next, the Court stressed that “[o]f key importance, when unlawful discrimination\n\ninfects tax classifications or other legislative prescriptions, the Constitution simply calls\n\nfor equal treatment. How equality is accomplished—by extension or invalidation of the\n\nunequally distributed benefit or burden, or some other measure—is a matter on which the\n\nConstitution is silent.” Levin, 560 U.S. at 426–27 (first emphasis added). The Court\n\ndeveloped this theme at length. It discussed how the remedy sought by the challengers in\n\nLevin could interfere with Ohio’s legislative prerogatives in a way the Constitution did\n\nnot command. Id. at 429. And it reiterated that, in Hibbs and in prior cases that had\n\nchallenged state allocations of tax revenue to maintain racially segregated schools, “only\n\none remedy would redress the plaintiffs’ grievance: invalidation of the credit. . . .\n\nBecause state courts would have no greater leeway than federal courts to cure the alleged\n\nviolation, nothing would be lost in the currency of comity or state autonomy by\n\npermitting the Hibbs suit to proceed in a federal forum.” Id. at 431. The constitutional\n\ncommand of equal treatment, and nothing more, was also present in National Private\n\nTruck Council and McNary, discussed above, as well as in Harper v.

Although “the comity doctrine is more embracive than the” Tax\n\nInjunction Act, Levin, 560 U.S. at 424, it is not wide enough to capture this case. This is\n\nin part because the comity doctrine is about the scope of § 1983; National Private Truck\n\nCouncil makes that clear, and it helps explain why the Court allowed the tax suit in\n\nHibbs, an Establishment Clause challenge, and in the cases involving tax benefits to\n\nsegregated schools. Those individual rights—like the right not to be deprived of property\n\nwithout due process of law—are at the core of § 1983 protection, in areas where federal\n\nsupervision is particularly important, whereas dormant Commerce Clause,\n\nintergovernmental tax immunity, and equal protection challenges to tax classifications\n\n\n\n\nCommission v. Pullman Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103481\"><a href=\"/opinion/103481/railroad-commn-of-tex-v-pullman-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">312</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">496</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1941), comes into play when an interpretation\nof state law may moot a federal constitutional case; and Colorado River Water\nConservation District v.

Younger and Pullman plainly don’t\napply, and the Colorado River factors weigh in favor of exercising jurisdiction: although\nthe Cab Companies have filed a parallel state suit, the federal case came first, the Eastern\nDistrict of Pennsylvania is convenient to the parties (all operate in and around\nPhiladelphia), there is no in rem jurisdiction here, and issue preclusion can likely attach\nto whatever judgment comes first.\n                                              9\n\fthat do not single out disenfranchised populations were less likely in Congress’s mind\n\nwhen it passed the Civil Rights Act of 1871.\n\n       Comity also should not apply here because the Constitution, enforced through\n\n§ 1983, commands a specific remedy (assuming the Cab Companies incurred damages\n\nbecause of a procedural due process violation), unlike in the tax-discrimination cases\n\nwhere a range of remedial options among which the Constitution has no preference can\n\ncure the relevant deficiency. Finally, as McNary, Levin, and National Private Truck\n\nCouncil confirm, the comity doctrine is important “particularly in the area of state\n\ntaxation.” McNary, 454 U.S. at 103 (emphasis added); see also Levin, 560 U.S. at 421\n\n(“Comity’s constraint has particular force when lower federal courts are asked to pass on\n\nthe constitutionality of state taxation of commercial activity.”); Nat’l Private Truck\n\nCouncil, 515 U.S. at 587 (1995) (discussing “longstanding federal reluctance to interfere\n\nwith state taxation”).\n\n       The strongest argument that the Commonwealth could raise here for the District\n\nCourt to favor Pennsylvania courts would be based on a simplistic reading of one\n\nparagraph in Levin. There the Supreme Court concluded its discussion of the comity\n\ndoctrine with sentences that the majority opinion’s eighth footnote rearranges and\n\ndecontextualizes:\n\n       First, respondents seek federal-court review of commercial matters over\n       which Ohio enjoys wide regulatory latitude; their suit does not involve any\n       fundamental right or classification that attracts heightened judicial scrutiny.\n       Second, while respondents portray themselves as third-party challengers to\n       an allegedly unconstitutional tax scheme, they are in fact seeking federal-\n       court aid in an endeavor to improve their competitive position. Third, the\n       Ohio courts are better positioned than their federal counterparts to correct\n\n                                             10\n\f       any violation because they are more familiar with state legislative\n       preferences and because the [Tax Injunction Act] does not constrain their\n       remedial options.\n\nLevin, 560 U.S. at 431–32. I do not, as my colleagues appear to suggest, believe these\n\nremarks created a multi-factor test that should be applied mechanistically to future cases;\n\nrather, I view them as a summary of a long opinion that turns on two key facts: (1) Levin\n\nwas a tax case, and (2) if the challenged tax was unconstitutional, the state could remedy\n\nits violation either by raising taxes for the plaintiffs’ competitors, lowering them for\n\nplaintiffs, or some combination.\n\n       Even if Levin created a multi-factor test to be applied to any challenge to any state\n\nlaw, those factors do not counsel in favor of dismissal here. It is true that the Cab\n\nCompanies seek review of a commercial statute, but, as for the second factor, they are not\n\nseeking to improve their “competitive position” because there are not similarly situated\n\ncompetitors unburdened by the PPA’s regulation. Third, and relatedly, although the\n\nremedial options in any lawsuit may be broad, they are not flexible in this case in the\n\nsame way that they are in tax cases where a state is to reapportion taxes among the\n\nclasses that must be treated equally.\n\n       IV.    The Circuit Courts and the “Fees v. Taxes” Line of Cases\n\n       For the reasons set forth above, I conclude that the Supreme Court’s comity\n\njurisprudence counsels federal courts against dismissing cases on comity grounds unless\n\na state seeks application of the doctrine, the plaintiff challenges a tax, and a range of\n\nremedial options is available to the state should a court deem the tax unconstitutional.\n\nAnd I am in good company. Every court of appeals to address the question has applied\n\n                                              11\n\fcomity only in state tax cases where an adequate state remedy exists. Taxes aside,\n\nfederal courts must exercise their “virtually unflagging obligation . . . to exercise the\n\njurisdiction given them,” Colorado River, 424 U.S. at 817, when presented with\n\nconstitutional challenges to regulatory fees. The cases describe “taxes” as generally\n\nimposed by a legislature, assessed against a broad class of people or entities, and used for\n\ngeneral public purposes, while “regulatory fees” are usually imposed by an agency,\n\nassessed against a narrow class of persons, and used for the benefit or regulation of those\n\nwho pay.

Valero presented a far better vehicle for\nexpanding the comity doctrine than our case because there the state had multiple remedial\noptions just as in the tax cases. Nonetheless, it was probably wrongly decided. Scott v.\n                                              12\n\f       Appellees concede that the policy challenged here involves collection of\n\nregulatory fees, but they argue that distinguishing between fees and taxes is arid\n\nformalism. I disagree. First, the comity doctrine of the McNary–Levin line has\n\ndeveloped exclusively in the state-tax context, and the cases emphasize specifically “the\n\nfederal reluctance to interfere with state taxation.” Levin, 560 U.S. at 424 (quoting Nat’l\n\nPrivate Truck Council, 515 U.S. at 590). Second, refraining from federal interference\n\nmakes particular sense in the tax context because of the remedial flexibility discussed\n\nabove and stressed in Levin.\n\n       It is hard for me to imagine (and no court has suggested) a limiting principle to\n\ncomity other than the historical reluctance to interfere with taxes and the related remedial\n\nflexibility. All § 1983 cases affect the public fisc directly or indirectly, and expanding\n\ncomity to our case would, it seems to me, mean that the doctrine would bar any suit\n\nagainst a state practice that is subject to rational basis review, a radical curtailment of the\n\nscope of § 1983 unsupported by cases from any level of the federal judiciary.\n\n                                *      *       *      *       *\n\n       No court, let alone the Supreme Court, has suggested that the comity doctrine is as\n\nbroad as the majority’s selective quotations from Levin and other similarly off-point cases\n\nimply.3 Given that a focus on remedial flexibility and the historical practice of not\n\n\nDonald, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94587\"><a href=\"/opinion/94587/scott-v-donald/\"><span class=\"volume\">165</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 101 (1897) (affirming a federal court’s award of damages incurred\nby violation of the dormant Commerce Clause).\n3\n  Particularly perplexing is the majority’s decision to quote Levin’s language about “other\nlegislative prescriptions” as suggesting that maybe comity could apply here. 456 U.S. at\nat 426. Let’s read the rest of the sentence (again): “Of key importance, when unlawful\ndiscrimination infects tax classifications or other legislative prescriptions, the\n                                              13\n\finterfering with state tax laws harmonizes the Supreme Court’s comity and Tax\n\nInjunction Act cases as well as the solid wall of other courts of appeals’ authority on the\n\ndistinction between regulatory fees and taxes, I would adopt the distinction between fees\n\nand taxes and conclude that comity should not bar the Cab Companies’ suit here. I would\n\nthus vacate the judgment of the District Court and remand the case with instructions not\n\nto consider the red herring called the comity doctrine.\n\n\n\n\nConstitution simply calls for equal treatment.” Id. (first two emphases added). This\nsentence alone exposes the impropriety of applying comity here, all the more so when\nread in light of a doctrine that has only been applied in the discriminatory tax context\n(excepting the Northern District of West Virginia, which erroneously, but at least\narguably plausibly, extended the doctrine to a different context calling for equal\ntreatment, see supra n.2).\n                                             14\n\f</pre>",
