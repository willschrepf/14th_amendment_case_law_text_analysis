internationally known experts and peer-reviewed\r\nby experts in PTSD and trauma, some of whom had also written the DSM-IV.<span>  </span>Dr. Astin stated that trauma experts\r\nconsidered CAPS to be

Laura</span><span>=</span><span>s condition; instead, Dr. Astin testified that she had\r\nused this and other techniques in <i>treating</i> Laura.<span>  </span>Dr. Astin testified that EMDR is a therapy\r\ntechnique that involves asking a person to bring up some aspect of a traumatic\r\nmemory, along with the negative thoughts that have developed as a result of it,\r\nwhile watching the therapist</span><span>=</span><span>s fingers move\r\nback and forth in front of the patient</span><span>=</span><span>s\r\neyes.<span>  </span>Dr. Astin</span><span>=</span><span>s personal opinion,

research on EMDR at first, but that seven\r\nrecent, </span><span>A</span><span>very well controlled studies</span><span>@</span><span> had shown EMDR to be highly effective.<span>  </span>As a

that\r\nlarge numbers of clinicians were now using it, and she provided the trial court\r\nwith two articles about EMDR that explained why it was valid. <span>        </span>Regarding vicarious traumatization, Dr.\r\nAstin acknowledged that, early in her career, she had experienced symptoms of\r\nthis phenomenon, which is well recognized in the field of psychology.<span>  </span>Dr. Astin testified that, several years\r\nbefore Laura became her patient, she had written an article about her\r\nexperiences.<span>  </span>She also testified that\r\nshe had recognized how to prevent these feelings and symptoms, no longer had\r\nthem, and had never been treated for them.<span> \r\n</span>Finally, Dr. Astin testified that vicarious traumatization had not\r\naffected her diagnosis of

as imaging technology or blood work, or reviewing\r\nresults of similar cases of restraint.<span> \r\n</span>Appellants further assert that Laura</span><span>=</span><span>s\r\nMMPI-II score showed

class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Regarding medical\r\ntests, Dr. Pentzien testified that a blood test and neuroimaging technique were\r\navailable to serve as additional tools in diagnosing mental disorders.<span>  </span>He further testified, however, that the\r\ntests had not been conducted because they were not specific enough to\r\ndistinguish between particular types of disorders.<span>  </span>In addition, Dr. Pentzien testified that the neuroimaging\r\ntechnique was not sufficiently standardized to be generally accepted as\r\nreliable in the field of neuropsychiatry.<span> \r\n</span>Likewise, Dr. Astin testified that she knew of no literature in the\r\nfield of psychotherapy that suggested a blood test or brain scan could be\r\nspecific enough to

</span><span>A</span><span>horrible experiences</span><span>@</span><span> in a person</span><span>=</span><span>s childhood could affect her later in life, Dr. Astin\r\nopined that the cause of Laura</span><span>=</span><span>s PTSD and\r\ndepression was related to the June 1996 incidents. <p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Dr. Astin testified\r\nthat, in making her diagnoses, she had administered several standardized tests\r\nto Laura that are generally accepted as valid in the field of psychology for\r\ndetermining whether a person is suffering from PTSD and depression, and if so,\r\nwith what intensity. <p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Further, Dr. Astin\r\nacknowledged that much of the information she used in making her PTSD

patient</span><span>C</span><span>was not </span><span>A</span><span>pulling the wool over her eyes.</span><span>@</span><span><span>  </span>First, Dr.\r\nAstin relied on her clinical skills and experience.<span>  </span>She also asked Laura to give her detailed descriptions of each of\r\nthe symptoms Laura claimed to be having related to PTSD and depression (such as\r\nflashbacks, for example), so that she could determine whether Laura was\r\nactually experiencing the symptoms. <p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<span><br clear=\"all\">\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<div

levels that were inconsistent with their\r\nbehavior.<span>  </span>Over time, Dr. Astin examined\r\nthese individuals</span><span>=</span><span> detailed, repeated self-reporting about their alleged\r\nsymptoms and behavior to see if they were consistent with PTSD.<span>  </span>If, based on her extensive clinical training\r\nand experience, she determined that a particular patient was

possible criteria for PTSD listed\r\nin the DSM-IV.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span>[67]</span></sup></span><span>  </span>She explained that the standardization meant\r\nthat every clinician who administered CAPS to a patient conducted it according\r\nto the same format, thereby enabling clinicians to better determine the\r\nvalidity of the responses received and lending greater credence to their\r\nresulting diagnoses.<span>  </span>Dr. Astin stated\r\nthat CAPS had been developed in the 1980s as a result of research on potential\r\nPTSD sufferers by nationally and internationally known experts and peer-reviewed\r\nby experts in PTSD and trauma, some of whom had also written the DSM-IV.<span>  </span>Dr. Astin stated that trauma experts\r\nconsidered CAPS to be

</span>Eye Movement Desensitization\r\nand Reprocessing (EMDR).<span>  </span>Appellants\r\nalso assert that Dr. Astin admitted she had treated so many traumatized women\r\nthat she had been

clear=\"all\">\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"Section32\">\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>First, there is no\r\nevidence that Dr. Astin employed EMDR in <i>diagnosing</i> Laura</span><span>=</span><span>s condition; instead, Dr. Astin testified that she had\r\nused this and other techniques in <i>treating</i> Laura.<span>  </span>Dr. Astin testified that EMDR is a therapy\r\ntechnique that involves asking a person to bring up some aspect of a traumatic\r\nmemory, along with the negative thoughts that have developed as a result of it,\r\nwhile watching the therapist</span><span>=</span><span>s fingers move\r\nback and forth in front of the patient</span><span>=</span><span>s\r\neyes.<span>  </span>Dr. Astin</span><span>=</span><span>s personal opinion, however, was that the eye\r\nmovements were just a way to distract the person while thinking about the\r\ntrauma, therefore making it less aversive to do so.

accepted in the scientific community, but\r\nremained controversial because the inventor of the technique was a\r\ncontroversial person.<span>  </span>She explained\r\nthat there had been little good research on EMDR at first, but that seven\r\nrecent, </span><span>A</span><span>very well controlled studies</span><span>@</span><span> had shown EMDR to be highly effective.<span>  </span>As a result, this technique had been\r\nendorsed, although not promoted, by the Society for Traumatic Stress Studies<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span>[68]</span></sup></span></span><span>C</span><span>a well-respected organization of mental health\r\nproviders, including psychologists and psychiatrists, and </span><span>A</span><span>virtually all</span><span>@</span><span> of\r\nthe members of the national centers for PTSD established by the federal\r\ngovernment.<span>  </span>Dr. Astin testified that\r\nlarge numbers of clinicians were now using it, and she provided the trial court\r\nwith two articles about EMDR that explained why it was valid. <span>        </span>Regarding vicarious traumatization, Dr.\r\nAstin acknowledged that, early in her career, she had experienced symptoms of\r\nthis phenomenon, which is well recognized in the field of psychology.<span>  </span>Dr. Astin testified that, several years\r\nbefore Laura became her patient, she had written an article about her\r\nexperiences.<span>  </span>She also testified that\r\nshe had recognized how to prevent these feelings and symptoms, no longer had\r\nthem, and had never been treated for them.<span> \r\n</span>Finally, Dr. Astin testified that vicarious traumatization had not\r\naffected her diagnosis of Laura in any way. <p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Despite all of this\r\nevidence of reliability, appellants assert that these experts</span><span>=</span><span> testimony concerning Laura</span><span>=</span><span>s PTSD diagnosis is unreliable because the experts\r\nmade the diagnosis without conducting any rate-of-incidence studies or\r\nobjective medical tests, such as imaging technology or blood work, or reviewing\r\nresults of similar cases of restraint.<span> \r\n</span>Appellants further assert that Laura</span><span>=</span><span>s\r\nMMPI-II score showed she was </span><span>A</span><span>faking bad,</span><span>@</span><span> that is, exaggerating her symptoms. <p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<span><br clear=\"all\">\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<div

testified that he did not know of any case studies examining\r\nthe incidence of PTSD arising from Laura</span><span>=</span><span>s\r\ntype of situation. <p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Regarding medical\r\ntests, Dr. Pentzien testified that a blood test and neuroimaging technique were\r\navailable to serve as additional tools in diagnosing mental disorders.<span>  </span>He further testified, however, that the\r\ntests had not been conducted because they were not specific enough to\r\ndistinguish between particular types of disorders.<span>  </span>In addition, Dr. Pentzien testified that the neuroimaging\r\ntechnique was not sufficiently standardized to be generally accepted as\r\nreliable in the field of neuropsychiatry.<span> \r\n</span>Likewise, Dr. Astin testified that she knew of no literature in the\r\nfield of psychotherapy that suggested a blood test or brain scan could be\r\nspecific enough to reveal PTSD. <p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Drs. Astin and\r\nHelge conceded that Laura</span><span>=</span><span>s MMPI-II score showed she was </span><span>A</span><span>faking bad.</span><span>@</span><span><span>  </span>But they interpreted Laura</span><span>=</span><span>s particular score as consistent with a </span><span>A</span><span>cry for help,</span><span>@</span><span>\r\nmeaning that she was embellishing her symptoms somewhat in order to be heard,\r\nnot that she was claiming to have symptoms that did not exist.<span>  </span>Dr. Pentzien testified that, while he\r\nconsidered the MMPI-II helpful in making a diagnosis, he was not trained in the\r\nfield of psychometrics<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span>[70]</span></sup></span>\r\nand therefore was not qualified to interpret the MMPI-II test results. <p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<span><br clear=\"all\">\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"Section35\">\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Having conducted a\r\ncareful review, we conclude that, although the record shows that the methods\r\nand analyses that Drs.
