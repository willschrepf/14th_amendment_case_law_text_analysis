In his habeas petition, Rutledge challenges the loss\n\nof good conduct time (GCT) and other sanctions imposed while in federal custody at the\n\fFederal Correctional Institution in Fort Dix, New Jersey. For the following reasons, we\n\nwill affirm the District Court’s order.\n\n       While incarcerated at FCI Fort Dix, Rutledge was issued an incident report\n\ncharging him with abuse of the telephone, possession of anything unauthorized, and\n\nconduct that disrupts the running of the institution. The charges were based on the\n\ndiscovery of a cell phone which a friend of Rutledge’s brought him on a visit to FCI Fort\n\nDix. At a hearing before a Discipline Hearing Officer (DHO), Rutledge admitted that the\n\ncell phone was his, that his friend had brought it to him, and that he had used the phone\n\nwhile in custody. Based on Rutledge’s admissions, the DHO found that Rutledge had\n\ncommitted two infractions: (1) non-criminal telephone abuse in violation of Code 297;\n\nand (2) possession of anything unauthorized in violation of Code 305. The DHO imposed\n\nsanctions including forfeiture and disallowance of GCT, disciplinary segregation, and a\n\none-year loss of telephone privileges and visitation privileges.\n\n       Rutledge challenged the DHO’s decision by filing a habeas corpus petition in the\n\nUnited States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.1 Rutledge concedes\n\nthat he violated Code 305 by possessing an unauthorized cell phone, but he contests the\n\nDHO’s determination that he abused the telephone in violation of Code 297. Rutledge\n\nalso challenges the severity of the sanctions imposed. The District Court interpreted\n\n\n\n   1\n    By the time he filed his habeas petition, Rutledge had been transferred to the Low\nSecurity Correctional Institution (LSCI) Allenwood, which is within the judicial district\nof the Middle District of Pennsylvania.\n\n                                             2\n\fRutledge’s challenge to the Code 297 violation as a challenge to the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence, found evidence to support the DHO’s conclusion, ruled that the sanctions\n\nimposed were permissible, and denied Rutledge’s habeas petition. Rutledge appeals.2\n\n       We consider first Rutledge’s challenge to the DHO’s decision on the Code 297\n\ninfraction. Code 297 prohibits “[u]se of the telephone for abuses other than criminal\n\nactivity (e.g., circumventing telephone monitoring procedures, possession and/or use of\n\nanother inmate’s PIN number; third-party calling; third-party billing; using credit card\n\nnumbers to place telephone calls, conference calling; talking in code).” 28 C.F.R.\n\n§ 541.13, Table 3. Rutledge argues that this prohibition applies only to telephones\n\ninstalled in the institution, not to cell phones. The District Court concluded that using an\n\nunauthorized cell phone circumvents telephone monitoring procedures and rejected this\n\nargument. We agree fully with the District Court’s logical conclusion that using a cell\n\nphone circumvents telephone monitoring procedures. We also agree that the evidence\n\namply supports the DHO’s conclusion that Rutledge violated Code 297 – Rutledge\n\nadmitted that the cell phone was his and that he had used it while in custody.\n\n       We consider next Rutledge’s challenge to the severity of the sanctions imposed.\n\nRegarding the Code 297 infraction, the applicable regulation permits forfeiture of up to\n\n60 days GCT and disallowance of up to 27 GCT for the year, the precise sanction the\n\n\n\n   2\n    We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1291 and 2253(a). We exercise\nplenary review over the District Court’s legal conclusions and apply a clearly erroneous\nstandard to its findings of fact. See Ruggiano v. Reish, 307 F.3d 121, 126 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\n                                              3\n\fDHO imposed on Rutledge. See 28 C.F.R. § 541.13, Table 3. For his Code 305\n\ninfraction, Rutledge forfeited 13 days GCT and was disallowed 13 days GCT, also within\n\nthe limits prescribed by the regulation. See id. To the extent Rutledge complains about\n\nthe loss of visitation privileges, the regulations permit the loss of privileges. See id.\n\nMoreover, the loss of visitation privileges is especially appropriate where, as here, an\n\ninmate obtains an unauthorized cell phone from a visitor.\n\n       Finally, Rutledge argues that imposing sanctions under both Code 305 and Code\n\n297 violates the Double Jeopardy Clause. The Government asks that we decline to\n\nconsider Rutledge’s double jeopardy argument because he raises it for the first time on\n\nappeal. Rutledge acknowledges that he did not raise a double jeopardy claim in the\n\nDistrict Court. Under the circumstances presented here, we see no reason to depart from\n\nour general rule of not considering an issue raised for the first time on appeal. See Gass\n\nv. Virgin Islands Tel. Corp., 311 F.3d 237, 246-47 (3d Cir. 2002). Accordingly, we\n\ndecline to consider Rutledge’s double jeopardy argument.\n\n       For these reasons, we are convinced that the District Court properly denied\n\nRutledge’s habeas corpus petition. Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court’s\n\njudgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f",
