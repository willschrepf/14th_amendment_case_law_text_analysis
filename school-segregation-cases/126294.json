A number of people, preferring that the\n\nUnited States government not get this money, have intervened to prevent its forfeiture. So far,\n\nplaintiff United States has managed to dismiss from this action seven of these intervening parties\n\nand has successfully defeated a motion to dismiss the complaint.\n\n               The plaintiff now moves to dismiss from the action, for lack of standing, one\n\nmore claimant: European Federal Credit Bank Limited (“Eurofed”), an Antiguan bank in\n\nliquidation. And here the plaintiff’s winning streak comes to an end, because the Court\n\nconcludes that Eurofed, acting by and through its appointed liquidators, has standing to contest\n\nthe forfeiture of the defendant assets that are located in Antigua and Barbuda. As for the\n\fremaining assets to which Eurofed lays claim, however — those located in Lithuania and\n\nSwitzerland — the Court agrees with the plaintiff that Eurofed has not demonstrated its standing\n\nto contest their forfeiture. The Court therefore will grant the plaintiff’s motion in part and deny\n\nit in part.1\n\n\n                                         I. BACKGROUND\n\n                                 A. Nature of the Forfeiture Action\n\n                The United States initiated this litigation in 2004, seeking the forfeiture of money\n\nthat is allegedly traceable to a series of acts of “criminal fraud, extortion, bribery,\n\nmisappropriation, and money laundering” carried out by, among others, Pavel Ivanovich\n\nLazarenko, a.k.a. Pavlo Lazarenko, a prominent Ukrainian politician who, with the aid of various\n\nassociates, was “able to acquire hundreds of millions of United States dollars through a variety of\n\nacts of fraud, extortion, bribery, misappropriation and/or embezzlement” committed during the\n\n1990s. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 1, 10. According to the United States, those illegal acts, and subsequent\n\nattempts to launder the resulting criminal proceeds, involved the transfer of large sums of U.S.\n\ndollars into and out of United States financial institutions. Id. ¶¶ 11-13. The plaintiff seeks to\n\nclaim ownership of those sums of money pursuant to federal statutes that provide for the\n\n\n\n\n         1\n                 The documents reviewed by the Court in resolving the pending motion include\nthe following: plaintiff’s amended complaint (“Am. Compl.”); Eurofed’s verified claim and\nstatement (“Euro. Cl.”); Eurofed’s answer (“Euro. Ans.”); plaintiff’s corrected motion for\nsummary judgment (“MSJ”) and supporting memorandum (“Mem.”); Eurofed’s opposition\n(“Opp.”); plaintiff’s reply (“Reply”); Eurofed’s surreply (“Surreply”), and the various\ndeclarations and statements of fact that the parties have included with their memoranda. The\nCourt has also reviewed its earlier substantive opinions in this case: United States v. All Assets\nHeld at Bank Julius Baer & Co., Ltd., 571 F. Supp. 2d 1 (D.D.C. 2008) (“All Assets I”); id., 664\nF. Supp. 2d 97 (D.D.C. 2009) (“All Assets II”); id., 772 F. Supp. 2d 191 (D.D.C. 2011) (“All\nAssets III”); id., 772 F. Supp. 2d 205 (D.D.C. 2011) (“All Assets IV”), appeal dismissed, 455 F.\nApp’x 3 (D.C. Cir. 2012).\n\n                                                   2\n\fforfeiture to the United States government of funds traceable or otherwise related to criminal\n\nactivity that occurred at least in part in the United States. See id. ¶ 1.\n\n\n                                   B. Eurofed and its Liquidation\n\n                As permitted by the civil forfeiture statutes, several parties filed claims in this\n\naction asserting an interest in specific property sought by the plaintiff and contesting its\n\nforfeiture. At issue here is the claim submitted by an Antiguan bank, Eurofed, which is now in\n\nthe process of being liquidated under the laws of Antigua. The plaintiff alleges that, before its\n\nliquidation, Eurofed was used by Lazarenko to launder proceeds of his criminal activities. Over\n\n$100 million of the funds named as in rem defendants in the plaintiff’s complaint are alleged to\n\nhave been formerly held on deposit for Lazarenko’s benefit at Eurofed. See Am. Compl.\n\n¶ 5(d)-(h).\n\n                Eurofed, acting by and through its appointed liquidators (the “Liquidators”), has\n\nintervened in this action, asserting an interest in five of the specific properties being sought by\n\nthe plaintiff and named in paragraphs 5(d) through 5(h) of the amended complaint:\n\n                Approximately $85.5 million in United States dollars held at Bank\n                of Nova Scotia (Antigua) in the name of the Registrar of the High\n                Court of Antigua & Barbuda;\n\n                Approximately $1.6 million in United States dollars held at Bank\n                of Nova Scotia (Antigua) in the name of the Registrar of the High\n                Court of Antigua & Barbuda;\n\n                All assets held at Credit Suisse (Geneva), in account number 0251-\n                562927-6, in the name of European Federal Credit Bank Limited,\n                last valued at approximately $4.8 million in United States dollars;\n\n                All assets held at Banque SCS Alliance S.A. (Geneva) in account\n                number 5491, in the name of European Federal Credit Bank\n                Limited, last valued at approximately $483,629.69 in United States\n                dollars;\n\n\n\n                                                   3\n\f               All assets held at Vilniaus Bankas [Lithuania] held for the benefit\n               of European Federal Credit Bank Limited, formerly held at\n               accounts 073721 and 073420 at Bankas Hermis in the name of\n               European Federal Credit Bank Limited, last valued at\n               approximately $29,344,05.35 in United States dollars.\n\nEuro. Cl. at 3-4; see Am. Compl. ¶ 5(d)-(h). Eurofed has also asserted an interest in the\n\nplaintiff’s catch-all in rem defendant: “All assets traceable to the above-mentioned proceeds and\n\nproperty.” Am. Compl. ¶ 5(j); see Euro. Cl. at 4.2\n\n               Because many of the arguments raised in connection with Eurofed’s standing to\n\ncontest the forfeiture of these assets hinge on the precise details of Eurofed’s history and\n\nliquidation, a detailed account of both is necessary.\n\n               The plaintiff alleges that Lazarenko and an associate, Peter Kiritchenko, obtained\n\na controlling interest in Eurofed in 1997, becoming majority shareholders of the bank and\n\nplacing Lazarenko in control of its investment decisions. See Plaintiff’s Statement of Facts\n\n(“Pl.’s Stmnt.”) ¶¶ 1, 4. Lazarenko and his criminal associates were both the bank’s primary\n\nowners, the plaintiff alleges, and also its primary depositors. Id. ¶¶ 2-4. According to the\n\nplaintiff, the funds held by Eurofed on Lazarenko’s behalf were spread across a number of bank\n\naccounts — one in Lazarenko’s own name and six in the names of corporate entities that he\n\nallegedly controlled: Lady Lake Investments; Fairmont Group, Ltd.; Firststar Securities, Ltd.;\n\nGuardian Investment Group, Ltd.; Nemuro Industrial Group; and Orby International, Ltd. Id.\n\n¶ 5(d). Eurofed is alleged to have held security deposits for two of these companies as well. Id.\n\n               According to the plaintiff, by the end of 1997 over $100 million of Lazarenko’s\n\nmoney was held by Eurofed in these accounts. Pl.’s Stmnt. ¶ 4. In addition, the plaintiff alleges,\n\n\n\n       2\n                In addition to the Eurofed-related in rem defendants, the complaint also seeks\nforfeiture of over $150 million in funds located in Guernsey and Liechtenstein with no alleged\nconnection to Eurofed or Antigua. See Am. Compl. ¶ 5(a)-(c), (i).\n\n                                                 4\n\fapproximately $1.6 million was formerly held on deposit at Eurofed in the account of\n\nLazarenko’s associate Alexander Milchenko. Id. ¶ 5(e).\n\n               Eurofed’s Liquidators acknowledge that in 1997 Lazarenko obtained an\n\nownership interest in the bank, but they profess to lack enough information to confirm that he\n\nand his associates were the majority depositors. See Eurofed’s Statement of Facts (“Euro.\n\nStmnt.”) ¶ 3. The reason for this uncertainty, they say, is that in the course of their duties they\n\nhave not yet been able to determine whether the six companies allegedly affiliated with\n\nLazarenko truly were owned or controlled by him. Id. And the funds of those six companies\n\nmake up the bulk of the money at issue here: Lazarenko’s personal bank account appears to\n\nhave held only approximately $150,000 by 1999, while the combined value of the six\n\ncompanies’ accounts exceeded $93 million. Moreover, the Liquidators, while seemingly\n\nacknowledging that Lazarenko exerted some influence over Eurofed’s actions and was more than\n\na mere depositor, do not concede that he exerted total control over the bank or its investment\n\ndecisions. Id. ¶ 4. The Liquidators also emphasize that Eurofed held millions of dollars in\n\ndeposits from third parties who had no connection with Lazarenko. Id.; see Declaration of\n\nCharles William Augustine Walwyn ¶ 6 (estimating that innocent third parties had in excess of\n\n$25 million on deposit at Eurofed when it went into liquidation).\n\n               Eurofed apparently maintained few of its deposits in Antigua itself. Instead, it\n\nestablished “correspondent” bank accounts in its own name at various other financial institutions\n\naround the world, in which it stored the bulk of the money deposited by its customers. See\n\nDeclaration of Andrew Lewczyk, Ex. P, at 5. “These correspondent bank accounts were not held\n\nfor the benefit of any particular depositor,” according to the Liquidators. “As a result, a\n\ncustomer’s deposits were not located in any particular location or correspondent account.” Id.\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fat 8. In other words, if hypothetical Eurofed customers Sally, Sam, and Sue each deposited $40\n\nwith Eurofed in Antigua, the bank may well have divided that $120 among four of its own\n\ncorrespondent bank accounts in Switzerland, Lithuania, Liechtenstein, and the United States\n\n(placing, say, $30 into each account), making it impossible to trace Sally’s $40 deposit to any of\n\nEurofed’s four correspondent accounts.\n\n               In 1999, Antiguan government authorities with responsibility over financial\n\ncrimes began to investigate Eurofed. Walwyn Decl. ¶ 2. That fall, the nation’s Office of Drug\n\nand Money Laundering Control Policy (“ONDCP”) applied to the High Court of Justice of\n\nAntigua and Barbuda for an order freezing all Eurofed assets linked to Lazarenko. Id. The High\n\nCourt granted this request in an order dated October 29, 1999, prohibiting Lazarenko and several\n\nof his associates and affiliated companies from removing any of their funds from Antigua or in\n\nany way disposing of or diminishing those funds. Id., Ex. B, at 2. The apparent basis for this\n\nrestraining order was Lazarenko’s criminal prosecution in Switzerland on money laundering\n\ncharges, for which he was later convicted, and the alleged connection between those charges and\n\nthe funds held at Eurofed. See id., Ex. H.\n\n               On November 15, 1999, the Antiguan financial authorities placed Eurofed into\n\nreceivership, pursuant to the International Business Corporations Act of Antigua and Barbuda\n\n(the “IBC Act”). See Declaration of Nicolette M. Doherty, Exs. B, C. Charles Walwyn and\n\nDonald Ward, from the accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers Antigua, were appointed as\n\nreceiver-managers, and these appointments were confirmed on November 25, 1999 by the High\n\nCourt of Justice, which ordered the receivers to reorganize the bank. See id., Exs. C, D. Under\n\nthe IBC Act, the receivers were charged, among other things, with “taking into [their] custody\n\n\n\n\n                                                6\n\fand control the property of the Bank” and “opening and maintaining a bank account or accounts\n\nfor the moneys of the Bank coming under [their] control.” Id., Ex. C, at 1.\n\n               In fulfillment of their responsibilities, in late November 1999 the receivers\n\ntransferred approximately $76 million to Antigua that was being held in Eurofed correspondent\n\nbank accounts located within the United States. The Liquidators kept this money in a trust\n\naccount that they established for Eurofed funds. Pl.’s Stmnt. ¶¶ 6-7; Euro. Stmnt. ¶¶ 6-7.3\n\n               On December 3, 1999, the High Court of Justice rescinded its previous\n\nreceivership order and instead directed that Eurofed be liquidated and dissolved pursuant to the\n\nIBC Act. See Walwyn Decl., Ex. E. The court appointed Mr. Walwyn and Mr. Ward as\n\nliquidators, providing that they be remunerated at an hourly rate for their work from the funds of\n\nthe bank. Id., Ex. E, at 2.4\n\n               Under the IBC Act, a liquidator “must,” among other responsibilities, “take into\n\nhis custody and control the property of the corporation,” “open and maintain a trust account for\n\nthe moneys of the corporation received and paid out to him,” and, “after his final accounts are\n\napproved by the court, distribute any remaining property of the corporation among the\n\nshareholders according to their respective rights.” IBC Act § 307(c), (d), (f). The Act also\n\npermits a liquidator to “bring, defend or take part in any civil, criminal or administrative action\n\nor proceeding in the name of and on behalf of the corporation.” Id. § 308(1)(b).\n\n\n       3\n               By contrast, the Liquidators have not been able to secure the return of other\nEurofed funds that were held in overseas correspondent accounts back to Antigua. Specifically,\nEurofed deposits are still being maintained in accounts at Credit Suisse in Switzerland (last\nvalued at approximately $4.8 million), Banque SCS Alliance S.A. in Switzerland (last valued at\nnearly $500,000), and Vilniaus Bankas in Lithuania (last valued at approximately $29.3 million).\nThe Eurofed deposits located at these three institutions make up the in rem defendants named in\nparagraphs 5(f), 5(g), and 5(h) of the plaintiff’s complaint.\n       4\n             The High Court of Justice later appointed Robert Wilkinson to replace Mr. Ward.\nWalwyn Decl. ¶ 5.\n\n                                                  7\n\f               On July 7, 2000, granting an ex parte application by the ONDCP, the Antiguan\n\nHigh Court of Justice issued an order directing that “all funds of Pavel Lazarenko and all his\n\nassociated accounts frozen by Order of this Court” (in October of the previous year) be forfeited\n\nto the Antiguan government. Walwyn Decl., Ex. F, at 2. The Liquidators were ordered to pay\n\nthose funds — specified in the order as $114,919,356.82, “or such amount thereof as remains in\n\nthe Liquidators’ hands,” along with any accrued interest — into an Antiguan government bank\n\naccount at the Bank of Nova Scotia in St. John’s, Antigua. Id.\n\n               Both Lazarenko and the Liquidators promptly appealed this forfeiture order to the\n\nCourt of Appeal for Antigua and Barbuda of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court. See\n\nWalwyn Decl., Ex. H, at 1. Lazarenko also moved the appellate court for a stay of the forfeiture\n\norder pending his appeal. Id., Ex. G, at 1. The Court of Appeal granted Lazarenko’s motion for\n\na stay and ordered that, pending the appeal, the funds be placed into an interest-bearing account\n\nheld at the Bank of Nova Scotia in the name of the Registrar of the High Court of Justice. Id.\n\nThe preexisting freeze order from October 1999 remained in force. Id.\n\n               The Liquidators complied with the order and transferred the funds. This is how\n\nthe assets listed in paragraphs 5(d) and 5(e) of the plaintiff’s complaint in this action came to be\n\n“held at Bank of Nova Scotia (Antigua) in the name of the Registrar of the High Court of\n\nAntigua Barbuda.” Am. Compl. ¶ 5(d), (e).\n\n               The Liquidators’ appeal of the July 7, 2000 Antiguan forfeiture order was stayed\n\nby agreement of the parties, see Walwyn Decl., Ex. J, ¶ 4, while Lazarenko’s appeal of that order\n\ncontinued and ultimately succeeded. On April 27, 2001, the Court of Appeal ruled that the\n\nOctober 29, 1999 freeze order and the July 7, 2000 forfeiture order were not authorized by the\n\nAntiguan money laundering statute under the authority of which they ostensibly were issued.\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\fThe appellate court held that at the time of the orders no evidence had been presented to the High\n\nCourt linking the funds on deposit at Eurofed with the money laundering crime for which\n\nLazarenko was convicted in Switzerland. Because the Antiguan money laundering statute\n\nrequired such a showing to be made, both the freeze order and the forfeiture order were invalid.\n\nSee id., Ex. H, ¶ 1.5\n\n                A few days after the Court of Appeal ruled that the forfeiture and freeze orders\n\nwere invalid, the Antiguan money laundering authorities applied for a new freeze order from the\n\nHigh Court of Justice. That court issued another ex parte order on May 2, 2001, directing that\n\n“[a]ll the rights and interests” of Lazarenko, “whether in his name or otherwise,” be “frozen until\n\nfurther order.” Walwyn Decl., Ex. I, ¶¶ 1-2. This order applied to any interests of Lazarenko in\n\nmoney held “within the account maintained by the Registrar . . . at the St John’s Branch of the\n\nNova Scotia Bank” or “within any account maintained by the liquidators of Eurofed Bank Ltd.”\n\nId.\n\n                In light of this new freeze order, Eurofed’s Liquidators applied for their own order\n\nfrom the High Court of Justice later that month. The Liquidators explained to the court that the\n\nmoney held in the account of the Registrar of the High Court of Justice — where it had been\n        5\n                The Justice on the Court of Appeal who authored the judgment explained that the\nforfeiture order was “premature” because it “did not comply with the strict provisions” of\nSection 20(2a) of the Antiguan Money Laundering (Prevention) Act. Walwyn Decl., Ex. H,\n¶ 17. Under the money laundering statute, the court ruled, “the property to be frozen must be\nproved to have been derived from or connected with the offence committed in Switzerland. And\nunlike the learned Trial Judge . . . I am unable to see that the required connection has been\nestablished. I am of the view that there was no evidence that the large sum of money which the\nlearned Trial Judge ordered to be frozen was derived from or in connection with the offence with\nwhich [Lazarenko] was charged and convicted in Switzerland.” Id. ¶ 31. Therefore, “the learned\nTrial Judge had no power, authority, or jurisdiction to invoke section 20(2a) of the Act to make\nthe freezing order on October 29, 1999. It follows that the consequent forfeiture order made\nunder section 20(2a) must also be bad. Indeed, in his submission learned Counsel for the\nRespondent recognized that it was for the [Antiguan government] to show under section 20(2a)\nthat the property, proceeds or instrumentalities are at the time of the application derived from or\nconnected with the offence for which a person has been charged.” Id. ¶ 32.\n\n                                                 9\n\fordered deposited for safekeeping pending Lazarenko’s appeal of the now-vacated forfeiture\n\norder — made up the vast majority of the liquidation estate. Walwyn Decl., Ex. J, ¶¶ 3-6. The\n\nLiquidators further maintained that the innocent depositors and creditors of Eurofed who were\n\nnot alleged by the government to be affiliated with Lazarenko “have been prejudiced by the fact\n\nthat their funds have been removed from the liquidation together with the funds of [Lazarenko]\n\nand place[d] in the account of the Registrar.” Id. ¶ 10. Accordingly, the Liquidators proposed a\n\npro rata division of the funds being held in the Registrar’s account, under which the funds of\n\nLazarenko and the six companies he allegedly controlled would remain frozen in the Registrar’s\n\naccount, while the funds of the remaining third-party depositors of Eurofed would be released to\n\nthe Liquidators for use in the liquidation. Id. ¶ 7.\n\n               The Liquidators also described the basis for their conclusions about which funds\n\nshould be regarded as Lazarenko-related and remain frozen. As they explained, in view of the\n\nnew restraining order, which imposed restrictions only on Lazarenko’s interests in Eurofed’s\n\nfunds, it had become necessary to “quantify the funds held by the Liquidators for Pavlo\n\nLazarenko and his alleged companies.” Walwyn Decl., Ex. J, at 5. Although Lazarenko himself\n\nhad asserted ownership of the six companies alleged to be under his control, and had made\n\nclaims in the liquidation for over $100 million of Eurofed funds based on that purported\n\nownership, the Liquidators stated that they had “not been able to independently verify ownership\n\nof the companies.” Id. at 6. Taking a conservative approach, the Liquidators recommended\n\ntreating the combined sum of the money in Lazarenko’s personal bank account and the accounts\n\nof the six companies over which he claimed ownership as potentially Lazarenko-related for the\n\npurposes of the freeze order. Since Lazarenko “ha[d] not provided any evidence supporting a\n\nclaim any higher than this” amount, the Liquidators reasoned that the remainder of the funds\n\n\n\n                                                  10\n\fcould safely be regarded as non-Lazarenko-related and used to fund the liquidation claims of\n\nthird-party depositors and creditors. Id. at 6-7.6\n\n               The Liquidators proposed, in other words, that all funds potentially related to\n\nLazarenko would remain in the Registrar’s account, but that the remainder of the funds, which\n\nby all reports came from innocent third parties, be released to the Liquidators for use in funding\n\nthe liquidation.7 After pro rata calculations and reductions, the Liquidators’ proposal called for\n\nthe release of nearly $20 million to the Liquidators, while approximately $65 million in\n\npotentially Lazarenko-related funds would stay in the Registrar’s account. Id. at 10-11.\n\n               In an order dated November 6, 2003, the High Court of Justice granted the\n\nLiquidators’ motion, over the objections of Lazarenko’s counsel. See Walwyn Decl., Ex. K.\n\nThe court directed the Registrar to release the nearly $20 million from its account at the Bank of\n\nNova Scotia to the Liquidators “for the purpose of pro rata payment to third party depositors and\n       6\n                The Liquidators also noted, however, that “Mr. Lazarenko claims ownership [of\nthe six companies] and no other claims to ownership have been made.” Walwyn Decl., Ex. J,\nat 5; see Supplemental Declaration of Charles William Augustine Walwyn, Ex. B (copy of\nLazarenko’s claim in Eurofed liquidation, stating that “he is the beneficial owner” of all six\ncompanies). A clear link between Lazarenko and these companies is evident in certain financial\nagreements between the companies and Eurofed. For instance, a document executed by the\nFairmont Group Ltd., authorizing Eurofed to establish a bank account, provides: “Physical\npresence of Pavlo Lazarenko is required for all instructions or changes to this account.”\nDeclaration of John J. Truex, Ex. G, at 1. The Liquidators report to this Court in their motion\npapers that the true owners of the six companies still “have not been proven or identified.” Euro.\nStmnt. ¶ 2. The plaintiff spills a fair amount of ink arguing that Lazarenko is in fact the owner of\nthese companies and accusing the Liquidators of attempting to “obscure” the scope of his\ndeposits with Eurofed. See Pl.’s Reply Stmnt. at 2-4. While this matter may become important\nlater, nothing in this Opinion depends on whether or not Lazarenko is the owner of the six\ncompanies.\n       7\n               In the Liquidators’ words, “at the time we proposed the 2003 segregation of\nfunds, we conservatively attributed those funds to Lazarenko to avoid any potential argument\nthat these funds could be subject to forfeiture. We certainly were not disclaiming any right to\nuse those funds in the future for liquidation purposes should the forfeiture fail, or if Lazarenko\nwere unable to prove his ownership of those funds. We proposed the division simply to provide\na mechanism to allow partial payment of third party claims and to keep the Eurofed liquidation\napace.” Walwyn Decl. ¶ 14.\n\n                                                 11\n\fcreditors” and for expenses of the liquidation. Id. ¶ 2. “The funds designated to Pavlo\n\nLazarenko and associated companies,” however, totaling approximately $65 million, were to\n\n“remain frozen at the Bank of Nova Scotia, Antigua, in the account of the Registrar of the High\n\nCourt until further order.” Id. ¶ 5. It is unclear whether Eurofed funds allegedly held for the\n\nbenefit of Alexander Milchenko (approximately $1.6 million) were designated as being\n\npotentially Lazarenko-related in the Liquidators’ calculations, and thus whether a corresponding\n\namount of money (reduced pro rata) was released to the Liquidators as part of the approximately\n\n$20 million they received. See Lewczyk Decl., Ex. P, at 10-11.\n\n               Since the division of funds in 2003, the Liquidators report that they have worked\n\nto validate third-party claims and have used the $20 million released to them to make\n\ndistributions to validated depositors and creditors. As of March 2012, they state, they had\n\nvalidated approximately 74 claims submitted by claimants unrelated to Lazarenko and had\n\ndistributed over $14 million to those claimants. Because of the cap on the funds presently\n\navailable to them, however, and because there are 107 additional third-party depositors and\n\ncreditors whose claims have not yet been validated, the Liquidators have paid the validated third-\n\nparty depositors and claimants on a pro rata basis. They report that the balance still owed to\n\nthese 74 validated third-party claimants is $3,180,171. They also report that the total value of\n\nthe “potential claims” of the additional 107 third-party depositors and creditors whose claims\n\nhave not yet been validated is $6,966,692. “Thus . . . the total potential remaining amount due to\n\nthird party depositors and creditors unrelated to Lazarenko is $10,146,823,” while the “total\n\nunrestrained funds in the Liquidators’ possession . . . is $4,347,542, and therefore, there is a\n\ndeficit in the liquidation estate of at least $5,799,280.” Walwyn Decl. ¶¶ 16-17.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\f             C. Lazarenko’s Prosecution and the Initiation of this Forfeiture Action\n\n               Meanwhile, in the United States, Lazarenko was criminally prosecuted for\n\noffenses stemming from his alleged laundering of money through American banks. Indicted in\n\nthe Northern District of California on dozens of counts of conspiracy, money laundering, wire\n\nfraud, and interstate transportation of stolen property, Lazarenko was convicted in June 2004 of\n\nnumerous counts — eight of which, for money laundering and conspiracy, survived a post-trial\n\nmotion for a judgment of acquittal and an appeal to the Ninth Circuit. See United States v.\n\nLazarenko, 564 F.3d 1026, 1029-32, 1047 (9th Cir. 2009).\n\n               The plaintiff initiated civil forfeiture proceedings in this Court in May 2004. As\n\ngrounds for the forfeiture, the complaint alleges criminal conduct by Lazarenko that is similar to\n\nthe charges levied against him in his criminal prosecution. See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 120-155. This\n\nCourt’s jurisdiction rests on 28 U.S.C. § 1355(a), and venue is proper here because all of the\n\ndefendant properties are located in foreign bank accounts, and “[w]henever property subject to\n\nforfeiture under the laws of the United States is located in a foreign country . . . an action or\n\nproceeding for forfeiture may be brought . . . in the United States District Court for the District\n\nof Columbia.” All Assets I, 571 F. Supp. 2d at 7 & n.6 (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 1355(b)(2)); see\n\nUnited States v. All Funds in Account Nos. 747.034/278, 747.009/278, & 747.714/278 in Banco\n\nEspanol de Credito, Spain, 295 F.3d 2, 26 (D.C. Cir. 2002).\n\n               The amended complaint includes eight claims for forfeiture falling into two\n\ngeneral categories. The first four claims for relief allege the direct forfeiture of criminal\n\nproceeds pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 981(a)(1)(C), which provides for the forfeiture of proceeds\n\nfrom violation of certain enumerated criminal statutes or any offense constituting “specified\n\nunlawful activity” as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1956(c)(7). See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 120-139.

Compl. ¶¶ 140-155. The plaintiff argues that all of the defendant properties are forfeitable\n\nunder either theory.\n\n               Civil forfeiture actions are governed by the procedures set forth in 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 983 and the Supplemental Rules for Admiralty or Maritime Claims and Asset Forfeiture\n\nActions (“Supplemental Rules”), a subset of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. When the\n\ngovernment files a complaint for forfeiture, “any person claiming an interest in the seized\n\nproperty may file a claim asserting such person’s interest in the property in the manner set forth\n\nin the Supplemental Rules[.]” 18 U.S.C. § 983(a)(4)(A); see SUPP. R. G(5)(a).\n\n               Nine individuals and three business entities filed claims contesting the forfeiture\n\nin this action. The individual claims were filed by Pavel Lazarenko, Alexander Lazarenko,\n\nAlexei Ditiatkovsky, and six people who maintained that they were innocent depositors of\n\nEurofed. The institutional claims were filed by Eurofed (acting through its Liquidators), OAO\n\nGazprom, and Universal Trading & Investment Company, Inc. The latter two companies\n\nclaimed an interest in the defendant funds stemming from a kickback scheme allegedly\n\norchestrated by Lazarenko that involved natural gas contracts in the Ukraine. See All Assets III,\n\n772 F. Supp. 2d at 196-205; All Assets IV, 772 F. Supp. 2d at 211-18.\n\n               The Court denied a motion by the Liquidators to transfer venue to the Northern\n\nDistrict of California, where Lazarenko was being prosecuted, see Order, United States v. All\n\nAssets Held at Bank Julius Baer & Co., Ltd. (D.D.C. July 5, 2006), and it later denied a motion\n\nby Pavel and Alexander Lazarenko to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter\n\n\n\n                                                14\n\fjurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. See All Assets I, 571 F. Supp. 2d at 6-17. Upon\n\nmotion by the plaintiff, the Court dismissed the claims of the six individual Eurofed depositors,\n\nbecause those individuals did not file answers to the plaintiff’s complaint as required by\n\nSupplemental Rule G(5)(b), a fatal procedural deficiency under the Supplemental Rules. See All\n\nAssets II, 664 F. Supp. 2d at 101-03. The Court also granted judgment on the pleadings against\n\nOAO Gazprom and Universal Trading & Investment Company, Inc., concluding that neither\n\ncompany had standing to participate in this action because each lacked a cognizable interest in\n\nthe property whose forfeiture they sought to contest. See All Assets III, 772 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n196-205; All Assets IV, 772 F. Supp. 2d at 211-18. Four claimants now remain: Pavel\n\nLazarenko, Alexander Lazarenko, Alexei Ditiatkovsky, and Eurofed.\n\n\n                             D. Background on the Pending Motion\n\n               Supplemental Rule G(6) permits the government to issue special interrogatories to\n\nclaimants early in the forfeiture proceedings, “limited to the claimant’s identity and relationship\n\nto the defendant property.” SUPP. R. G(6)(a). The purpose of such special interrogatories is to\n\nallow the government “to gather information that bears on the claimant’s standing,” id., Advisory\n\nCommittee Notes, 2006 Adoption, which facilitates the prompt elimination of claimants who\n\nhave no right to participate in the proceedings and frees the government from the burden of\n\nresponding to dispositive motions filed by such claimants. “The special interrogatories,”\n\ntherefore, “are limited to questions dealing solely with claimant’s ownership interests in the\n\nproperty.” John K. Rabiej, Supplemental Rule G Governing Pretrial Procedures in Forfeiture in\n\nRem Actions, PRAC. LITIG., May 2008, at 51.8\n\n       8\n               See Rabiej, Supplemental Rule G, at 51 (“The advisory committee . . . provid[ed]\nthe government with an early, but limited, right to scrutinize and challenge the claimant’s\nasserted property interest before the court was required to consider the claimant’s motion to\n\n                                                 15\n\f               The plaintiff propounded special interrogatories to Eurofed’s Liquidators in 2008,\n\nsee Declaration of Jason A. Levine, Ex. 18, and the Liquidators responded. After a stay in\n\ndiscovery that temporarily put things on hold, and after two subsequent requests by the plaintiff\n\nfor more complete responses after discovery resumed, the Liquidators provided their second set\n\nof supplemental responses and objections to the plaintiff’s special interrogatories in April 2010.\n\nSee Levine Decl., Ex. 20.\n\n               Approximately one year after receiving these special interrogatory responses, the\n\nplaintiff filed a “Motion to Strike Liquidators’ Claim or, in the Alternative, to Compel Complete\n\nResponses to Special Interrogatories.” See Dkt. No. 244. Rather than simply moving the Court\n\nto order the Liquidators to provide more comprehensive interrogatory responses, something the\n\nplaintiff had not yet attempted, the motion asked the Court to strike Eurofed’s claim entirely and\n\ndismiss the bank from the proceedings under Supplemental Rule G(8)(c)(i)(A), which permits\n\nstriking the claim of a forfeiture claimant who has failed to comply with Rule G(6).9\n\n               The plaintiff charged that the Liquidators had “repeatedly sought to avoid\n\nanswering the threshold question of the nature and extent of their interest in the property subject\n\nto forfeiture through evasive and non-responsive answers to Special Interrogatories,” Dkt. No.\n\ndismiss the government’s complaint. Under the rule, the government can issue special\ninterrogatories early in the litigation. The scope of these interrogatories is much more limited\nthan the scope of ordinary interrogatories issued under the Civil Rules.”).\n       9\n                Dismissal for failure to comply with Rule G(6) is authorized because a claimant’s\nfailure to respond to special interrogatories can frustrate the government’s efforts to determine\nwhether that claimant has standing to participate in the action. See Rabiej, Supplemental Rule G,\nat 54-55 (“Subdivisions (6) and (8) set up the framework for the government to review a\nclaimant’s bona fides before it must meet its burden of proof to show that the property is subject\nto forfeiture. At the start of many forfeiture actions, the government has little or no information\nabout the claimant’s interest in the seized property. Under subdivision (6), the government may\nfile limited, special interrogatories that bear on the ‘claimant’s identity and relationship to the\ndefendant property’ at any time during discovery. . . . The claimant’s response to the\ninterrogatories provides the government with the necessary information to review and, if\nappropriate, to contest the claimant’s standing.”).\n\n                                                16\n\f244-1 at 1-2, and that dismissal was an appropriate sanction for this noncompliance because the\n\nLiquidators had “provided conflicting evasive assertions of interest in their Claim, Answer and\n\nSpecial Interrogatory responses” and had “failed substantively to respond to Special\n\nInterrogatories despite multiple opportunities.” Id. at 2. As an alternative to dismissal, the\n\nplaintiff requested that the Liquidators be ordered to “fully respond” to certain special\n\ninterrogatories, “so that Plaintiff and the Court are apprised of Liquidators’ purported interest in\n\nthe Defendants In Rem.” Id.\n\n               The Court heard argument on the plaintiff’s motion in January 2012, combined\n\nwith argument on another motion that has since been resolved. During the hearing, the Court\n\nindicated that, in its view, it would be unusual to strike a claim under Supplemental Rule G(8)\n\nbased on inadequate responses to special interrogatories (as opposed to a complete failure to\n\nrespond) where the plaintiff had not even taken the preliminary step of moving to compel\n\nadditional responses. Cf. SUPP. R. G(8), Advisory Committee Note (“As with other pleadings,\n\nthe court should strike a claim or answer only if satisfied that an opportunity should not be\n\nafforded to cure the defects[.] Not every failure to respond to subdivision (6) interrogatories\n\nwarrants an order striking the claim.”). The Court observed that much of the plaintiff’s briefing\n\nwas devoted to attacking the Liquidators’ standing outright, rather than the adequacy of their\n\nspecial interrogatory responses, but that the plaintiff had not moved to dismiss the Liquidators\n\nfor lack of standing, as it was authorized to do by Supplemental Rule G(8)(c)(i)(B), instead\n\nbasing its motion exclusively on the Liquidators’ purported discovery noncompliance. Given\n\nthat the fight over the Liquidators’ interrogatory responses appeared to be serving as a proxy for\n\na more fundamental dispute about their standing to participate in this action, the Court asked the\n\nparties to confer about whether, in lieu of having the Court determine whether additional\n\n\n\n                                                 17\n\finterrogatory responses should be compelled, the parties would prefer to brief the question of the\n\nLiquidators’ standing head-on and without further discovery.\n\n                  Shortly thereafter, the parties advised the Court that they had agreed “to proceed\n\nwithout further supplementation of Liquidators’ responses to the Special Interrogatories and to\n\nrely on the existing record.” Dkt. No. 278 at 1. Under a jointly proposed scheduling order, the\n\nplaintiff agreed to file a motion to strike the Liquidators for lack of standing. Id. That motion,\n\nwhich the plaintiff has brought as a motion for summary judgment, is now before the Court.\n\n\n                                    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n                  In a forfeiture action brought in rem pursuant to a federal statute, at any time\n\nbefore trial the United States “may move to strike a claim or answer . . . because the claimant\n\nlacks standing.” SUPP. R. G(8)(c)(i)(B). Such a challenge to a party’s claim and answer “may be\n\npresented . . . as a motion to determine after a hearing or by summary judgment whether the\n\nclaimant can carry the burden of establishing standing by a preponderance of the evidence.” Id.\n\nG(8)(c)(ii)(B).\n\n                  Summary judgment may be granted if “the movant shows that there is no genuine\n\ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” FED.\n\nR. CIV. P. 56(a); see Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48 (1986); Holcomb v.\n\nPowell, 433 F.3d 889, 895 (D.C. Cir. 2006). “A fact is ‘material’ if a dispute over it might affect\n\nthe outcome of a suit under the governing law; factual disputes that are ‘irrelevant or\n\nunnecessary’ do not affect the summary judgment determination.” Holcomb v. Powell, 433 F.3d\n\nat 895 (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. at 248). An issue is “genuine” if the\n\nevidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party. See Scott\n\nv. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. at 248; Holcomb\n\n\n                                                   18\n\fv. Powell, 433 F.3d at 895. When a motion for summary judgment is under consideration, “the\n\nevidence of the non-movant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his\n\nfavor.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. at 255; see also Mastro v. Potomac Electric\n\nPower Co., 447 F.3d 843, 849-50 (D.C. Cir. 2006); Aka v. Washington Hospital Center, 156\n\nF.3d 1284, 1288 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (en banc).\n\n               The non-moving party’s opposition, however, must consist of more than mere\n\nunsupported allegations or denials and must be supported by affidavits, declarations, or other\n\ncompetent evidence, setting forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\n\nFED. R. CIV. P. 56(c); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324 (1986). The non-moving party\n\nis required to provide evidence that would permit a reasonable jury to find in his favor.\n\nLaningham v. United States Navy, 813 F.2d 1236, 1242 (D.C. Cir. 1987). If the non-movant’s\n\nevidence is “merely colorable” or “not significantly probative,” summary judgment may be\n\ngranted. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. at 249-50; see Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. at\n\n380 (“[W]here the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the\n\nnon-moving party, there is ‘no genuine issue for trial.’”) (quoting Matsushita Electric Industrial\n\nCo. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986)).\n\n               On a motion for summary judgment, the Court must “eschew making credibility\n\ndeterminations or weighing the evidence.” Czekalski v. Peters, 475 F.3d 360, 363 (D.C.

Supp. 2d\n\n99, 103 (D.D.C. 2004) (referring to Supplemental Rule C(6), the predecessor of Supplemental\n\nRules G(5) and G(6)). “The extent of the interest in the defendant property sufficient to meet\n\nthis standing requirement is left to case law.” Rabiej, Supplemental Rule G, at 55; see also\n\nUnited States v. Funds from Prudential Securities, 300 F. Supp. 2d at 103 (stating that a claimant\n\nmust “demonstrat[e] an interest . . . sufficient to satisfy the court of his standing”).\n\n                Establishing standing requires only that the claimant demonstrate “a colorable\n\ninterest in the property, for example, by showing actual possession, control, title, or financial\n\nstake.” United States v.

The claimant’s burden “is not a heavy one,” United States v. Real\n\nProperty Located at 475 Martin Lane, 545 F.3d at 1140, and courts must not conflate the\n\nstanding inquiry “with the merits determination that comes later.” United States v.

One Lincoln Navigator, 328 F.3d\n\nat 1013 (“This threshold burden is not rigorous: To have standing, a claimant . . . need only\n\nshow a colorable interest in the property, redressable, at least in part, by a return of the property.”\n\n(internal quotation and citation omitted)); see also United States v. $8,440,190.00 in U.S.\n\nCurrency, 719 F.3d 49, 57 (1st Cir. 2013) (“At the initial stages of intervention, the requirements\n\nare not arduous and typically any colorable claim on the defendant property suffices.”). Because\n\nthe United States, rather than the claimant, is the plaintiff and bears the burden of proving the\n\n\n\n                                                  21\n\fproperty’s forfeitability, “[t]he function of standing in a forfeiture action is therefore truly\n\nthreshold only — to ensure that the government is put to its proof only where someone with a\n\nlegitimate interest contests the forfeiture.” United States v. $557,933.89, More or Less, in U.S.\n\nFunds, 287 F.3d at 79.\n\n                The nature of a claimant’s asserted property interest is “defined by the law of the\n\nState” — or here, nation — “in which the interest arose.” United States v.

But while state law\n\ndefines a claimant’s interest in specific property, “federal law determines the effect of [that]\n\nownership interest on [the claimant’s] right to bring a claim.” United States v.

BCCI Holdings, Luxembourg, S.A., 69 F. Supp. 2d 36, 57 (D.D.C.\n\n1999) (same).10\n\n\n\n        10\n                 This Court has not previously had need to determine whether the requirement\nthat a claimant have an “interest” in specific defendant property is one of constitutional, as\nopposed to statutory or prudential, standing. See All Assets III, 772 F. Supp. 2d at 198 n.2; All\nAssets II, 664 F. Supp. 2d at 103 n.7. The Court now adopts the consensus shared among the\ncourts of appeals cited above — that civil forfeiture claimants must demonstrate Article III\nstanding in addition to the separate, though partly overlapping, requirements of statutory\nstanding. See 18 U.S.C. § 983 (a)(4)(A) (limiting intervention in civil forfeiture actions to “any\nperson claiming an interest in the seized property” who “file[s] a claim asserting such person’s\ninterest in the property in the manner set forth in the Supplemental Rules”); United States v.\nProp. Identified as $88,260.00, 925 F. Supp. 838, 840-41 (D.D.C. 1996) (explaining that\ncompliance with the procedural and timing requirements of the Supplemental Rules for filing a\nverified claim is necessary in order for the claimant to acquire “statutory standing”). As for\nprudential standing, see infra at 61-62.\n\n                                                  22\n\f                                         IV. DISCUSSION\n\n               As a civil forfeiture claimant, Eurofed must establish standing as to each of the\n\nfive in rem defendants named in the plaintiff’s complaint in which it asserts an interest. See\n\nSUPP. R. G(5)(a)(i)(A) (providing that forfeiture claimants must “identify the specific property\n\nclaimed”). These five properties fall into two fundamentally different categories. On one hand\n\nare the funds that are currently being held at the Bank of Nova Scotia, Antigua, in the name of\n\nthe Registrar of the High Court of Justice, which the plaintiff alleges were formerly maintained\n\non deposit at Eurofed for the benefit of Lazarenko and Alexander Milchenko. See Am. Compl.\n\n¶ 5(d), (e). On the other hand are the funds located in Lithuania and Switzerland that are still on\n\ndeposit at financial institutions where Eurofed formerly maintained correspondent bank\n\naccounts. See Am. Compl. ¶ 5(f), (g), (h). Because these two categories of in rem defendants\n\nare separated by significant differences regarding their legal relationship to Eurofed and its\n\nLiquidators, with consequences for Eurofed’s standing to contest their forfeiture, the Court will\n\naddress the two categories separately.\n\n\n              A. Defendant Funds Held at the Bank of Nova Scotia, Antigua, in the\n                     Account of the Registrar of the High Court of Justice\n\n                      1. Eurofed’s Property Interest in the Antiguan Assets\n\n                        a. Relationship Between a Bank and its Deposits\n\n               The parties agree that Antiguan law defines the nature of any interest that Eurofed\n\nand its Liquidators may have in the defendant funds that are located in Antigua and Barbuda.\n\nSee Mem. at 25-29; Opp. at 17, 20-21. They further agree that where Antiguan statutes and case\n\nlaw do not answer a particular legal question, English common law applies, supplementing\n\nAntiguan law. See Mem. at 19, 27-28; Opp. at 21; Declaration of Nicolette M. Doherty in\n\n\n\n                                                 23\n\fSupport of Liquidators ¶ 13 (stating that “to the extent that local law has not restated or overruled\n\nEnglish law, English statute and case law are deemed to form part of the law of Antigua and\n\nBarbuda”); Declaration of Felicity Rosalind Toube in Support of Plaintiff ¶ 6 (agreeing that\n\n“English common law applies unless Antiguan law has overruled or restated it”).11\n\n               Under longstanding principles of English law, applicable in Antigua, funds\n\ndeposited with a bank become the property of the bank, and the depositor becomes a creditor of\n\nthe bank: “Money, when paid into a bank, ceases altogether to be the money of the principal; it\n\nis then the money of the banker, who is bound to return an equivalent by paying a similar sum to\n\nthat deposited with him when he is asked for it.” Foley v. Hill, [1848] 2 H.L.C. 28, 36, 9 E.R.\n\n1002, 1005; see id., 2 H.L.C. at 36-37 (“The money placed in the custody of a banker is, to all\n\nintents and purposes, the money of the banker, to do with it as he pleases; he is guilty of no\n\nbreach, of trust in employing it; he is not answerable to the principal if he puts it into jeopardy, if\n\nhe engages in a hazardous speculation; he is not bound to keep it or deal with it as the property of\n\nhis principal, but he is of course answerable for the amount, because he has contracted, having\n\nreceived that money, to repay to the principal, when demanded, a sum equivalent to that paid\n\ninto his hands.”). The plaintiff and the Liquidators both acknowledge that, based on this\n\nprecedent, Antiguan banks as a general rule own the deposits made by their customers. See Opp.\n\nat 20-21; Reply at 10.\n\n\n       11\n                 See also Doherty Decl., Ex. F (Common Law Declaration and Application Act of\n1705), § 2 (stating that “the Common Law of England, as far as it stands unaltered by any written\nLaw of these Islands . . . is in force” and that it provides the rules whereby “Rights and\nProperties . . . are and ought to be determined”); Doherty Decl., Ex. G (Eastern Caribbean\nSupreme Court Act), Chap. 143, § 11 (stating that the jurisdiction vested in the High Court of\nJustice “shall be exercised in accordance with this Act and any other law in operation in Antigua\nand Barbuda and rules of court, and where no special provision is therein contained such\njurisdiction shall be exercised as nearly as may be in conformity with the law and practice\nadministered for the time being in the High Court of Justice in England”).\n\n\n                                                  24\n\f               Deposits made with Eurofed by its customers, therefore, became Eurofed’s assets.\n\nBut what, if anything, changed when the bank went into liquidation? The IBC Act, which\n\ngoverns the liquidation of international corporations registered in Antigua, does not explicitly\n\naddress whether a corporation retains title to its assets once it enters liquidation. By repeatedly\n\nreferring to “the property of the corporation,” IBC Act § 306(2), 307(c), 310(1)-(2), and “the\n\nmoneys of the corporation,” id. § 307(d), however, the Act strongly suggests that it does retain\n\ntitle. Indeed, it is difficult to see how an appointed liquidator could, as the IBC Act directs,\n\n“carry on the business of the corporation,” id. § 308(c), or “sell by public auction or private sale\n\nany property of the corporation,” id. § 308(d), if that corporation was not the owner of its assets.\n\n               Applicable English case law, moreover, confirms that a corporation in the process\n\nof being liquidated retains title to its assets. See Ayerst (Inspector of Taxes) v. C. & K.\n\n(Construction) Ltd., [1975] A.C. 167 (H.L.), 177 (stating that “a winding-up order does not of\n\nitself divest the company of the legal title to any of its assets”). Once in liquidation, however,\n\nthe corporation loses the “beneficial ownership” of those assets. Id. at 177-81. In this respect,\n\nthe corporation in liquidation is comparable to a trustee in bankruptcy, who is vested with legal\n\nownership of the bankrupt’s property, but who “cannot enjoy the fruits of it himself or dispose of\n\nit for his own benefit” and instead is “under a duty to deal with it as directed by the statute for\n\nthe benefit of all the creditors who come in to prove a valid claim.” Id. at 178. In other words:\n\n“The resolution or order for winding up divests the company of the beneficial interest in its\n\nassets,” and those assets “become a fund which the company thereafter holds in trust to discharge\n\nits liabilities.” Buchler and another v. Talbot and others, [2004] UKHL 9, ¶ 28 (opinion of Lord\n\nHoffman) (citing Ayerst).12\n\n       12\n                While the House of Lords in Ayerst construed the legal interests of corporations\nand their liquidators under a specific British statute, see Ayerst (Inspector of Taxes) v. C. & K.\n\n                                                  25\n\f               Consistent with these principles of English law, the IBC Act dictates that a\n\ncorporation in liquidation “shall cease to carry on business, except the business that is, in the\n\nopinion of the liquidator, required for an orderly liquidation,” IBC Act § 305(1)(a), the aims of\n\nwhich are to pay off all creditors and to distribute any remaining corporate property among the\n\nshareholders. Id. § 307(i).\n\n               In sum, an Antiguan bank in liquidation retains title to — though not beneficial\n\nownership of — its assets, and those assets include the deposits made by the bank’s former\n\ncustomers. Therefore, the initiation of Eurofed’s liquidation did not divest the bank of its\n\nownership of funds that its customers deposited with the bank, though it did alter the bank’s\n\nrelationship with those funds by circumscribing what the bank could do with them.\n\n\n              b. Relationship Between a Bank’s Liquidators and the Bank’s Assets\n\n               Under the IBC Act, when a corporation is ordered to be liquidated, “the powers of\n\nthe directors and shareholders cease and are vested in the liquidator.” IBC Act § 305(1)(a). A\n\nliquidator is required by the IBC Act to “take into his custody and control the property of the\n\ncorporation,” to discharge any obligations to “creditors and other persons having claims against\n\nthe corporation,” and, ultimately, to “distribute any remaining property of the corporation among\n\nthe shareholders according to their respective rights.” IBC Act § 307(c)-(i). A liquidator also\n\nmay, among other things, “carry on the business of the corporation as required for all orderly\n\nliquidation,” “do all acts and execute any documents in the name and on behalf of the\n\ncorporation,” and “bring, defend or take part in any civil, criminal or administrative action or\n\nproceeding in the name of and on behalf of the corporation.” Id. § 308(1)(b), (c), (e). In other\n\n(Construction) Ltd., A.C. at 176, the court’s interpretation of the terms of that statute drew upon\n“a consistent line of judicial authority,” arising in a variety of contexts and dating back to the\nnineteenth century, establishing “that upon going into liquidation a company ceases to be\n‘beneficial owner’ of its assets.” See id. at 179-81.\n\n                                                 26\n\fwords, upon the commencement of a liquidation proceeding, the company’s corporate structure\n\nceases to exist, and the liquidator — alone empowered to act on the company’s behalf — runs\n\nthe company’s affairs with the limited end of winding them down and appropriately distributing\n\nits assets. “The functions of the liquidator are thus similar to those of a trustee [in] bankruptcy or\n\nan executor in the administration of an estate of a deceased person.” Ayerst (Inspector of Taxes)\n\nv. C. & K. (Construction) Ltd., A.C. at 176-77.\n\n                A key distinction, however, is that under English law (applicable in Antigua) a\n\ntrustee in bankruptcy gains legal title to the bankrupt’s property, and an estate administrator\n\ngains legal title to the deceased’s property, but a liquidator does not gain title to the corporation’s\n\nproperty. That is because, as explained earlier, the corporation in liquidation never loses title to\n\nits assets — merely the “beneficial ownership” of those assets. Ayerst (Inspector of Taxes) v. C.\n\n& K. (Construction) Ltd., A.C. at 177. While a liquidator is often described as being similar to a\n\ntrustee, therefore, “he is not a trustee in the strict sense,” but rather “is more rightly described as\n\nthe agent of the company” who “has cast upon him by statute and otherwise special duties,”\n\nincluding “the duty of applying the company’s assets in paying creditors and distributing the\n\nsurplus among the shareholders.” Knowles v. Scott, [1891] 1 Ch 717, 723; see Janvey v.\n\nWastell, [2010] EWCA Civ 137, ¶ 121 (opinion of Lady Arden) (“As a matter of law, the\n\nliquidators have two capacities. First, they are the agents of SIB. Secondly they are trustees for\n\nthe unsecured creditors. . . . However, their only interest in the assets of SIB . . . is as\n\ntrustees[.]”); cf. Deloitte & Touche (Liquidator) v. Bennett, 81 O.R. 3d 389, 396 (May 18, 2006)\n\n(Can. Ont. Sup. Ct. J.) (“A liquidator is separate and distinct from the company being\n\nliquidated. . . . The liquidator acts as a quasi-trustee for creditors and stands in a different\n\nposition from the corporation.”).\n\n\n\n                                                   27\n\f               Under Antiguan law, in short, liquidators take possession of the corporation’s\n\nproperty and control over its affairs (not ownership of its assets) — but they do so only with the\n\nlimited end of winding down the corporation in accordance with the provisions of the IBC Act,\n\nin the process of which they exercise a quasi-fiduciary duty to the creditors of the corporation.\n\n\n    2. Implications of Eurofed’s Property Interest in the Antiguan Assets under Federal Law\n\n               Having elucidated the legal relationships under Antiguan law among a bank in\n\nliquidation, its assets (which include the deposits of its customers), and its appointed liquidators,\n\nthe Court must next determine whether a bank’s interest in those assets is sufficient under federal\n\nlaw to support its standing, acting through its liquidators, to contest their forfeiture. See United\n\nStates v. 5 S 351 Tuthill Rd., 233 F.3d at 1021; United States v. U.S. Currency, $81,000.00, 189\n\nF.3d at 33. With little difficulty, the Court concludes that Eurofed, acting through its\n\nLiquidators, has a colorable interest in the defendant assets located in Antigua and therefore may\n\nnot be barred from contesting their forfeiture at the summary judgment stage. See United States\n\nv. Real Property Located at 475 Martin Lane, 545 F.3d at 1140; United States v. One Lincoln\n\nNavigator, 328 F.3d at 1013; United States v. $148,840 in U.S. Currency, 521 F.3d at 1275;\n\nUnited States v. $557,933.89, More or Less, in U.S. Funds, 287 F.3d at 79.\n\n               A variety of property interests may serve as the basis for a claimant’s entitlement\n\nto contest a civil forfeiture, including not only ownership but also possessory and other lesser\n\nforms of interest. “The type of interest claimed dictates the type of evidence required to\n\nestablish standing.” United States v. $148,840.00 in U.S. Currency, 521 F.3d at 1274 (citing\n\nUnited States v. $191,910.00 in U.S. Currency, 16 F.3d 1051, 1058 (9th Cir. 1994)).\n\n               A claimant who asserts an “ownership interest” in the defendant property and who\n\npresents “some evidence of ownership” supporting that assertion has satisfied its burden of\n\n\n                                                 28\n\fdemonstrating standing at the summary judgment stage. United States v. $133,420.00 in U.S.\n\nCurrency, 672 F.3d at 639. This is common ground among the courts of appeals. See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. $148,840.00 in U.S. Currency, 521 F.3d at 1276 (“[W]hen a claimant has\n\nasserted an ownership interest in the res at issue and has provided some evidence tending to\n\nsupport the existence of that ownership interest, the claimant has standing to challenge the\n\nforfeiture.”); United States v. U.S. Currency, $81,000.00, 189 F.3d at 35 (“[A]n allegation of\n\nownership and some evidence of ownership are together sufficient to establish standing to\n\ncontest a civil forfeiture.”); Torres v. $36,256.80, 25 F.3d 1154, 1158 (2d Cir. 1994) (same);\n\nUnited States v. $38,570 U.S. Currency, 950 F.2d 1108, 1112-13 (5th Cir. 1992) (“[A] claimant\n\nis required to submit some additional evidence of ownership along with his claim in order to\n\nestablish standing to contest the forfeiture.”).\n\n               Eurofed has repeatedly claimed to be the owner of the defendant funds at issue\n\nhere. See Euro. Cl. at 4 (asserting that Eurofed “is the legal owner of the accounts and/or funds”\n\nin which the bank has claimed an interest); Lewczyk Decl., Ex. P, at 5 (asserting that “all\n\ndeposits into Eurofed became assets of the Bank.”); Opp. at 17 (asserting that “Eurofed is the\n\nlegal owner of all of the defendant Eurofed assets”). The only question, then, is whether the\n\nbank has provided enough evidence supporting this assertion of ownership to satisfy the Court of\n\nits standing at this stage in the proceedings.\n\n               In assessing the sufficiency and probity of evidence that purports to demonstrate a\n\ncolorable ownership interest, courts generally look to “indicia of dominion and control such as\n\npossession, title, and financial stake.” United States v. $38,570 U.S. Currency, 950 F.2d at 1113;\n\nsee United States v. $148,840.00 in U.S. Currency, 521 F.3d at 1275; United States v. 1998\n\n\n\n\n                                                   29\n\fBMW “I” Convertible, 235 F.3d 397, 399 (8th Cir. 2000)). Eurofed has demonstrated all of\n\nthese.\n\n               As explained in the foregoing discussion of Antiguan banking and corporate law,\n\nEurofed gained title to the deposits of its customers. See supra at 23-25. Those deposits are\n\namong the funds now being held in the Registrar’s account that the plaintiff seeks to forfeit. See\n\nAm. Compl. ¶ 5(d) (stating that the funds sought in the Registrar’s account include “assets\n\nderived from deposits” of Lazarenko and his associated companies); id. ¶ 5(e) (making same\n\nassertion regarding deposits of Alexander Milchenko).\n\n               Based on the principle that a bank owns the deposits of its customers, it may be\n\nthat Eurofed itself lost title to the funds when it deposited them in Eurofed’s own correspondent\n\nbank accounts with other financial institutions overseas: at that point, it would appear, the\n\nfinancial institutions with whom Eurofed did business became the owners of the money, and\n\nEurofed was put into the position of the customer, with nothing more than a claim for damages\n\nagainst the institutions if they did not return the money upon request. But once Eurofed’s\n\nreceivers secured the transfer of these funds back to Antigua and placed them in the receivers’\n\ntrust account, as ordered by the Antiguan courts, the funds once again became “the property of\n\nthe corporation.” IBC Act § 307(c); see id. § 307(d), (e) (referencing “the moneys of the\n\ncorporation received”); Doherty Decl., Ex. C, at 1. Eurofed thus has made a sufficient showing\n\nthat it owns the funds being held in the Registrar’s account in Antigua, as it claims, and this is\n\nsufficient to establish the bank’s standing at the summary judgment stage. See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. One Lincoln Navigator, 328 F.3d at 1013 (holding that where state law defines the\n\n“owner” of a vehicle as “a person who holds the legal title,” such legal title “establishes a prima\n\n\n\n\n                                                 30\n\ffacie case of ownership,” which, in the circumstances, conferred standing to contest the vehicle’s\n\nforfeiture).13\n\n                 In addition to demonstrating a colorable ownership interest in these funds,\n\nEurofed also has provided evidence that it has a possessory interest in the funds and a financial\n\nstake in their disposition. The funds were placed into Eurofed’s hands by its customers, were\n\nmaintained by the bank in its own overseas accounts, and were reclaimed from those foreign\n\naccounts by Eurofed’s receivers. That the funds are not presently within Eurofed’s control —\n\nbeing temporarily frozen, for the convoluted reasons explained earlier, in the account of the\n\nRegistrar of the High Court of Justice — hardly diminishes Eurofed’s clear possessory\n\nrelationship to those funds. Moreover, Eurofed undoubtedly has a financial stake in the funds, as\n\nthe bank’s Liquidators are under a legal obligation to take into their control the bank’s property,\n\ndischarge financial obligations to creditors, and distribute any surplus to its shareholders. See\n\nIBC Act § 307(b). If the forfeiture action in this Court fails on the merits, and if no other\n\nattempts to forfeit the funds (whether by the government of Antigua or some other government)\n\nare successful, the funds presumptively will be released to Eurofed for use in the liquidation.\n\n                 Having made a showing of ownership, possession, and financial stake with\n\nrespect to the in rem defendants being held in Antigua, Eurofed has satisfied the “undemanding”\n\nrequirements necessary to survive a summary judgment challenge to its standing, United States\n\nv. 5 S 351 Tuthill Rd., 233 F.3d at 1022, unless the plaintiff can demonstrate any countervailing\n\nlegal or factual considerations that undermine this conclusion.\n        13\n                The plaintiff suggests that Eurofed again lost title to the funds when it transferred\nthem to the account of the High Court Registrar at the Bank of Nova Scotia, in accordance with\nthat court’s orders. But the plaintiff has offered no reason to believe that the general principles\nregarding a banker-customer relationship outlined above are applicable to this type of court-\nordered deposit. As one of the plaintiff’s own experts explains, a bank can serve “in either the\nrole of an ordinary banker (a simple debtor creditor relationship) or also as an agent or trustee.”\nToube Decl. ¶ 14.\n\n                                                 31\n\f                              3. The Plaintiff’s Counter-Arguments\n\n               In an effort to rebut the foregoing determinations, the plaintiff summons a\n\nveritable blizzard of legal and factual counter-arguments. Some of these arguments address\n\nEurofed’s property interest in the Antiguan assets, while others seek to pry Eurofed’s interests\n\nand legal rights apart from those of its Liquidators. When the storm clears, however, it becomes\n\nevident that none of these arguments has merit.\n\n\n                              a. Fiduciary or Custodial Relationship\n\n               The plaintiff alleges that Lazarenko, his associates, and his affiliated companies\n\ndid not have a normal depositor-creditor relationship with Eurofed. According to the plaintiff,\n\nthe Lazarenko-related funds were not held “on deposit” at Eurofed at all. Instead, “Eurofed\n\nBank had a ‘fiduciary and investment’ relationship with Lazarenko regarding his personal\n\naccount, while the accounts of his corporate shells and the personal account of Milchenko were\n\nsubject to custodial agreements.” Pl.’s Stmnt. ¶ 28. Therefore, according to the plaintiff, even if\n\nAntiguan banks generally own the deposits of their customers, Eurofed’s Lazarenko-related\n\nfunds “did not become assets of the bank” because they were merely “held in a custodial or\n\nsafekeeping relationship.” Mem. at 37. And since these funds never belonged to Eurofed at all,\n\nthe bank would suffer no injury from their forfeiture. Id.\n\n               In support of these assertions, the plaintiff furnishes several types of documents.\n\nTwo are stray pages of unknown provenance: The first, as the Liquidators correctly characterize\n\nit, is “an unidentified, shorthand spreadsheet that does not even identify Lazarenko at all,” Euro.\n\nStmnt. ¶ 28, but merely is entitled “Fiduciary Account Balance and Investment Portfolio.”\n\nLewczyk Decl., Ex. S, at 1. Next is a similarly unidentified sheet of paper, apparently a copy of\n\n\n\n                                                  32\n\fa fax transmittal, containing a single paragraph that purports to be signed by Lazarenko and\n\ndirects that his “deposit account” is “to be invested by the direction of” either Lazarenko himself\n\nor his associate Peter Kiritchenko. Id. at 2. The plaintiff also supplies six identical “Custodian\n\nAgreements,” signed by representatives of each of Lazarenko’s affiliated companies, which\n\nauthorize Eurofed to open a “custodian account” for each company. See id., Exs. Q, R, T;\n\nDeclaration of John J. Truex, Exs. A-F. Finally, the plaintiff supplies additional documents\n\nexecuted by Lazarenko’s affiliated companies appointing Eurofed as their banker and setting\n\nforth certain terms of their accounts. See id., Exs. G-L. In addition to these documents, the\n\nplaintiff has submitted a declaration by an English lawyer which opines that, based on her review\n\nof the documents, “it appears to me from these records that the funds held in these accounts were\n\nassets held in a trust or fiduciary relationship for Lazarenko, and therefore did not become assets\n\nof Eurofed.” Toube Decl. ¶ 19.\n\n               The plaintiff’s evidence, while suggestive, is far too limited and ambiguous to\n\nsupport a judgment, without any further factual development, that Eurofed held the money of\n\nLazarenko and his affiliated companies in a custodial or fiduciary capacity, rather than as\n\ntraditional cash deposits. The Liquidators assert that, according to the records available to them,\n\nall of the Eurofed accounts at issue in this proceeding are indeed cash accounts, contrary to Ms.\n\nToube’s assessment. Suppl. Walwyn Decl. ¶ 4. In support, they provide accounting records of\n\nEurofed from 1999 that, they say, show these deposits to have been recorded as assets of the\n\nbank, “rather than off balance-sheet assets that would be consistent with a custodial or trust\n\nrelationship.” Id.; see id., Ex. A. They also note that even Lazarenko himself has never claimed\n\nthat his deposits or those of his companies were held in trust or were anything other than\n\nstandard cash deposits — a claim he presumably had strong incentive to make, as it may have\n\n\n\n                                                33\n\fgiven him priority over regular depositors of Eurofed in the liquidation proceedings. See id.,\n\nEx. B, at 1 (copy of Lazarenko’s claim in Eurofed liquidation, asserting that he and his six\n\ncompanies “are all depositors of Eurofed Bank” (emphasis added)).\n\n               As for the custodian agreements supplied by the plaintiff, those agreements by\n\ntheir terms refer only to “securities” that are “left with the Bank for safekeeping.” See, e.g.,\n\nLewczyk Decl., Ex. Q. The plaintiff suggests that, despite this proviso, these custodian\n\nagreements are “broad enough to cover monies in accounts Lazarenko held in his own name or\n\nthrough his shell companies” and that these agreements therefore might actually govern the cash\n\ndeposits made with Eurofed by Lazarenko’s six companies. Reply at 11. As the plaintiff points\n\nout, the definition of “securities” in these custodian agreements appears curiously broad,\n\nencompassing “all securities and property.” Lewczyk Decl., Ex. Q, at 1. Together with other\n\nterms of the custodian agreements and with some of the other account documentation provided\n\nby the plaintiff, this language may indeed indicate that these “custodian agreements” covered not\n\nonly bona fide securities but also the cash that Eurofed received from its customers, which it\n\n“safeguarded” by depositing in the bank’s overseas correspondent accounts. See Toube Decl.\n\n¶¶ 20-25.14\n\n               At the summary judgment stage, however, “may,” “might,” and “it appears” do\n\nnot cut it for the moving party. The evidence provided by the plaintiff is far from definitive and\n\nis woefully inadequate to support a ruling on this question as a matter of law. For one thing, the\n       14\n                For instance, the custodian agreements govern not only securities that are stored\nin the bank’s vault but also those kept “in the safekeeping of any agent or authorized depositary\n[sic] of the Bank.” Lewczyk Decl., Ex. Q, at 1. Eurofed was required to “register in its own\nname or in the name of a nominee” all of the “securities” covered by the agreements, which,\nagain, included “all securities and property.” Id. Moreover, other agreements between Eurofed\nand the six Lazarenko companies describe Eurofed securities as being “held at foreign\ncorrespondents” and deposited there “in the name of the Bank but held for the account of a\ncustomer” — i.e., similar to the manner in which Eurofed is known to have maintained the cash\ndeposited by its customers. Truex Decl., Ex. G, at 2.\n\n                                                 34\n\fcustodian agreements appear to be standard contracts drawn up by Eurofed without any obvious\n\ntailoring to Lazarenko’s companies; the Liquidators assert that “[o]ther, non-Lazarenko, Eurofed\n\ndepositors signed the same agreements as part of the account-opening process in the event they\n\ndecided to place securities with Eurofed.” Supp. Walwyn Decl. ¶ 7. What’s more, the\n\nagreements are largely devoted to provisions that make sense only with respect to the custody of\n\nactual securities, including terms governing dividends, voting rights, payments and distributions,\n\nmaturity and redemption, and contingencies in the event of a call, subscription, or conversion.\n\nSee Lewczyk Decl., Ex. Q, ¶¶ 5-6. Furthermore, it is known that Eurofed did in fact store bonds\n\nat the same overseas financial institutions where it maintained its correspondent cash accounts.\n\nSee Order at 1, United States v. $1,379,879.09, No. 05-0946 (N.D. Cal. July 8, 2008) (describing\n\nthe government’s seizure, in pursuit of civil forfeiture, of “three accounts held by Bank of\n\nAmerica in the name of Eurofed, containing approximately $1.7 million plus 923,000 Ukrainian\n\nbonds”); United States v. Liquidators of European Fed. Credit Bank, 630 F.3d 1139, 1142 (9th\n\nCir. 2011).\n\n               Given the state of the evidence, the plaintiff’s speculation that the custodian\n\nagreements it has supplied governed Lazarenko’s cash deposits as well as the storage of genuine\n\nsecurities is just that — speculation. At this juncture, however, all justifiable inferences must be\n\ndrawn in Eurofed’s favor, Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. at 255, and judgment may\n\nbe granted to the plaintiff only if “the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of\n\nfact to find for” Eurofed. Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. at 380. Rather than weighing the evidence,\n\nCzekalski v. Peters, 475 F.3d at 363, the Court’s only task is to determine whether the plaintiff\n\nhas shown that “there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact” and the plaintiff is entitled to\n\njudgment “as a matter of law.” FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a). Because the question of whether\n\n\n\n                                                  35\n\fEurofed’s arrangements with Lazarenko and his companies rendered those parties’ funds\n\nsomething other than general cash deposits — a question that has both factual and legal\n\ncomponents — could “reasonably be resolved in favor of either party,” Anderson v. Liberty\n\nLobby, Inc., 477 U.S. at 250, summary judgment cannot be granted to the plaintiff on this basis.\n\nSee United States v. $148,840 in U.S. Currency, 521 F.3d at 1277 (holding that district court\n\nerred by dismissing forfeiture claimant for lack of standing, because court was required to view\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to claimant, the non-moving party); United States v. 1998\n\nBMW “I” Convertible, 235 F.3d at 400 (holding that summary judgment was inappropriate\n\nwhere “district court was presented with contradictory evidence bearing directly on the question\n\nof whether appellants had an ownership interest”).15\n\n\n                                      b. Beneficial Ownership\n\n               As explained earlier, Eurofed has retained title to its assets during liquidation, but\n\nthe bank no longer is the “beneficial owner” of those assets. In light of this rule, the plaintiff\n\nargues that “upon issuance of the winding up order, Claimant Eurofed Bank became, at most, a\n       15\n                In a related argument, the plaintiff asserts that because Lazarenko allegedly\n“purchased a controlling interest” in Eurofed and “controlled the investment decisions regarding\nthe funds he held at Eurofed,” the bank “acted as a mere nominee and lacked control of the\nDefendant Assets.” Therefore, as the plaintiff sees it, “the bank did not have an ownership\ninterest in the Defendant Assets sufficient to confer standing.” Mem. at 36. The plaintiff has not\ncome close to demonstrating the factual predicates for this argument, however. Indeed, the\ndistrict judge who presided over Lazarenko’s criminal trial and subsequent ancillary proceedings\nexpressed skepticism about a similar assertion made by the United States during a hearing: that\nEurofed functioned as Lazarenko’s alter ego: “I’m going to tell you, I sat through about a 10 or\n12 week trial. I’m not sure I would be prepared to go as far as you have as to whether Eurofed is\ncompletely Mr. Lazarenko and they are coextensive. I’m not sure that my record reflects that.\nBut that’s for another day[.]” Levine Decl., Ex. 14, at 5. In a subsequent attorneys’ fee dispute,\nthe district judge who took over the case concluded that “[t]he government has not sufficiently\ndemonstrated that Eurofed may be held accountable for Lazarenko’s conviction as his alter ego”\nbecause “the trial record does not support the conclusion that Eurofed and Lazarenko are\ncoextensive.” Order at 6, United States v. $1,379,879.09, supra. The plaintiff certainly has not\npersuaded this Court of the absence of genuine issues of material fact on whether Eurofed acted\nas a mere nominee for Lazarenko.\n\n                                                  36\n\fmere title holder or nominee owner without rights of use or disposal of the property held at the\n\nBank.” Reply at 3. And because courts frequently deny standing to nominal owners who lack\n\nany “true” interest in the property that the government seeks to forfeit, the plaintiff argues,\n\nEurofed should be treated accordingly.\n\n                The plaintiff relies heavily on the truism that, rather than legal ownership per se,\n\n“it is injury that is at the heart of the standing question,” and that the inquiry into a claimant’s\n\nownership interests is often “a surrogate for an inquiry into whether there is injury direct enough\n\nand sufficient enough to sustain standing.” United States v. Cambio Exacto, S.A., 166 F.3d 522,\n\n527 (2d Cir. 1999); see id. (explaining that “we look to ownership and possession because they\n\nare often reliable indicators of injury that occurs when property is seized”). But, as a general\n\nmatter, it is clear that “an owner of property seized in a forfeiture action . . . necessarily suffers\n\nan injury that can be redressed at least in part by the return of the seized property” and that\n\ntherefore the owner “will normally have standing to challenge the forfeiture.” Id. (quoting\n\nUnited States v. $515,060.42 in U.S. Currency, 152 F.3d 491, 497 (6th Cir. 1998)); accord\n\nUnited States v. Contents of Accounts Nos. 3034504504 and 144-07143, 971 F.2d 974, 985 (3d\n\nCir. 1992)); United States v. U.S. Currency, $81,000.00, 189 F.3d at 35.\n\n                Although circumstances do arise in which an owner will be found to lack a\n\ngenuine interest in its property for standing purposes, Eurofed’s lack of beneficial ownership in\n\nthe Antiguan assets does not make this one of those circumstances. The plaintiff likens Eurofed\n\nto a “nominee,” i.e., “one who holds bare legal title to property for the benefit of another,”\n\nScoville v. United States, 250 F.3d 1198, 1202 (8th Cir. 2001) (quoting BLACK’S LAW\n\nDICTIONARY (7th ed. 1999)), and who therefore “do[es] not . . . suffer an injury when the\n\nproperty is taken.” United States v. Cambio Exacto, S.A., 166 F.3d at 527. But the defining\n\n\n\n                                                   37\n\ffeature of nominees is that while they “do indeed ‘own’ the property,” they “hold title to it for\n\nsomebody else.” Id. at 527. Such nominal ownership is of concern in the forfeiture context\n\nbecause it can be used “as a subterfuge” to evade forfeiture and benefit the criminal whose illegal\n\nconduct gave rise to the forfeiture. United States v. 5 S 351 Tuthill Rd., 233 F.3d at 1022.\n\nTherefore courts do not regard nominees as “a true owner of an interest in the property” and on\n\nthat basis frequently deny them standing to contest forfeitures. United States v. Vacant Land\n\nLocated at 10th St. & Challenger Way, 15 F.3d 128, 130 (9th Cir. 1993); see, e.g., United States\n\nv. Weiss, 467 F.3d 1300, 1308-09 (11th Cir. 2006); United States v. Premises Known as 526\n\nLiscum Drive, Dayton, Montgomery Cnty., Ohio, 866 F.2d 213, 217 (6th Cir. 1989); United\n\nStates v. One 1982 Porsche 928, 732 F. Supp. 447, 451 (S.D.N.Y. 1990).\n\n                An Antiguan company in liquidation, though it no longer enjoys beneficial\n\nownership of its assets, is not a mere stand-in for another party — because during the liquidation\n\nthere is no beneficial owner of the company’s assets. See Buchler and another v. Talbot and\n\nothers, [2004] UKHL 9, at ¶ 28 (opinion of Lord Hoffman) (explaining that while a liquidation\n\norder “divests the company of the beneficial interests in its assets,” which “the company\n\nthereafter holds in trust” to discharge its liabilities, “[i]t is a special kind of trust because neither\n\nthe creditors nor anyone else have a proprietary beneficial interest in the fund”). This attribute\n\nmakes a company in liquidation like the executor of an estate, who under English law is the legal\n\nowner of the deceased’s property but who may not “enjoy the fruits of it himself or dispose of it\n\nfor his own benefit,” even though “it [is] impossible to identify . . . a person or persons in whom\n\nthe beneficial ownership in any particular property forming part of the estate [is] vested.” Ayerst\n\n(Inspector of Taxes) v. C. & K. (Construction) Ltd., A.C. at 178. A trustee in bankruptcy, who\n\nsimilarly assumes legal but not beneficial ownership of the bankrupt’s estate, likewise “cannot\n\n\n\n                                                   38\n\fenjoy the fruits of the estate himself,” but “is under a duty to deal with it as directed by the\n\nstatute for the benefit of all the creditors who come in to prove a valid claim.” Id. at 178. The\n\nsame is true of an Antiguan company in liquidation, which has no legal right to enjoy the benefit\n\nof its assets, and must instead dispose of them according to the dissolution scheme set forth in\n\nthe liquidation provisions of the IBC Act.\n\n               The plaintiff’s comparison of Eurofed to a nominee, based on the bank’s lack of\n\nbeneficial ownership of the defendant assets, thus is inapt. Although an Antiguan company in\n\nliquidation may no longer do with its assets whatever it wishes, that company is still an ongoing\n\nbusiness concern, duty-bound under Antiguan law and court order to carry on its affairs as\n\nnecessary while consolidating its assets and distributing them to its shareholders after paying off\n\nany debts. See IBC Act § 307. The Court therefore rejects the plaintiff’s suggestion that the\n\nmoment such a company enters liquidation, its assets are ripe for the plucking in a forfeiture\n\naction that the bank has no right to contest.\n\n\n                                  c. Antiguan Restraining Orders\n\n               Even if all of the foregoing is correct, says the plaintiff, the particular funds at\n\nissue here have never actually been part of the Eurofed liquidation estate, and therefore Eurofed\n\ncan claim no interest in them. The reason, according to the plaintiff, is the restraining order\n\nissued in 1999 by the High Court of Justice that froze all Lazarenko-related Eurofed funds. As\n\ndescribed earlier, the court issued this order in October 1999, prohibiting Lazarenko, his\n\nassociates, and his allegedly affiliated companies from removing any of their funds from Antigua\n\nor disposing of or diminishing those funds. Walwyn Decl., Ex. B, at 2. The restraining order\n\nwas already in place when Eurofed’s receivers, in late November 1999, transferred $76 million\n\nback to Antigua from the United States (where the money had been on deposit in correspondent\n\n\n                                                  39\n\fbank accounts) and placed it into their Eurofed trust account. The restraining order was still in\n\neffect when Eurofed was ordered liquidated shortly thereafter, and the funds have remained\n\nsubject to restraint ever since then. Therefore, according to the plaintiff, because the defendant\n\nfunds located in Antigua have at all times remained frozen and unavailable for use by the\n\nLiquidators, the funds “are not part of the liquidation estate of Eurofed Bank.” Mem. at 33.\n\n               This argument has two flaws. First, it gets the facts wrong. The October 1999\n\nrestraining order to which the plaintiff refers was invalidated as unlawful in April 2001. See\n\nsupra at 8-9; Walwyn Decl., Ex. H. Although the High Court of Justice issued a new restraining\n\norder the next month, see Walwyn Decl., Ex. I, that was nearly a year and a half after Eurofed\n\nwas ordered liquidated. Thus, the Antiguan restraining order that is presently in force did not\n\npredate the liquidation or Eurofed’s reacquisition of the funds — just the opposite.\n\n               More significantly, neither of the restraining orders had any effect on the legal\n\nownership of the funds. The restraining orders were merely that: precautionary measures to\n\nprevent parties from dissipating the money or moving it elsewhere, pending the resolution of the\n\nforfeiture action that was then being pursued by the Antiguan government. Orders of this sort\n\nhave no effect on ownership interests: “A restraint order alters no rights; it merely freezes the\n\nproperty to which it is applied.” Janvey v. Wastell, [2010] EWCA Civ 137, ¶ 179 (opinion of\n\nLord Hughes); see id. ¶ 121 (opinion of Lady Arden) (stating that “a restraint order is simply a\n\nfreezing order: it cannot of itself effect changes in the ownership of assets though it may prevent\n\ncertain new interests from arising”). As the High Court of Justice put it, addressing these very\n\nfunds: “Quite simply a restraining Order seeks to conserve the assets until it can be further dealt\n\nwith according to Law.” Lewczyk Decl., Ex. K, ¶ 37.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 40\n\f               Thus, neither the original restraining order of October 1999 nor its successor of\n\nMay 2001 in any way undermines Eurofed’s property interest in the defendant assets located in\n\nAntigua. The fact that those funds are presently frozen does not mean Eurofed or its Liquidators\n\nhave lost their legal interest in the funds. Only a successful forfeiture action can accomplish that.\n\n\n               d. Antiguan Court Orders Enforcing This Court’s Restraining Order\n\n               The plaintiff offers a second reason why the funds at issue here are not part of the\n\nliquidation estate and why Eurofed therefore has no interest in them: according to the plaintiff,\n\nthe Antiguan courts themselves have said so. Specifically, the plaintiff points to a 2010 order by\n\nthe High Court of Justice that, over the Liquidators’ objections, enforced a restraining order\n\nissued by this Court freezing the Eurofed assets located in Antigua, as well as a 2012 judgment\n\nfrom the Court of Appeal that, again over the Liquidators’ objections, affirmed the High Court.\n\nAs the plaintiff reads it, the Court of Appeal decision “held that, as a matter of law, the assets\n\nsubject to this Court’s Restraining Order are not considered part of the liquidation estate.” Mem.\n\nat 31. Because this is a mischaracterization of the Antiguan courts’ decisions, the Court rejects\n\nthe plaintiff’s argument.\n\n               In 2004, shortly after the plaintiff filed the original complaint in this action, this\n\nCourt granted the plaintiff’s ex parte motion for a restraining order covering all of the in rem\n\nassets named as defendants in the complaint. See Restraining Order (May 20, 2004). After the\n\nplaintiff filed an amended complaint in 2005, the Court issued an amended restraining order,\n\nwhich remains in force today. See Restraining Order (July 8, 2005). That order prohibits certain\n\nenumerated parties, including the Liquidators, from taking “any action that would affect the\n\navailability or value of the Defendants In Rem including, but not limited to, withdrawing,\n\ntransferring, assigning, pledging, distributing, encumbering, wasting, secreting or otherwise\n\n\n                                                  41\n\fdisposing of or diminishing the value of, by any means, all or any part of the Defendants In\n\nRem.” Id. at 7. The order further directs that any financial institutions holding any assets subject\n\nto the order must “maintain such assets so as to continue to preserve their value and, for such\n\npurposes, are authorized to invest them for purposes of capital appreciation and accrual of\n\ninterest in the normal course of business and in accordance with generally accepted practices for\n\nthe management of such assets.” Id.\n\n               At the time the Court issued this restraining order, the defendant assets located in\n\nAntigua were already being held in an interest-bearing account in the name of the Registrar of\n\nthe High Court of Antigua and Barbuda, pursuant to earlier orders of the Antiguan courts. See\n\nsupra at 8. The High Court, by this point, already had released nearly $20 million of non-\n\nLazarenko-related Eurofed funds from the Registrar’s account to the Liquidators for the purpose\n\nof pro rata payments to innocent third-party depositors and creditors. See supra at 9-12;\n\nWalwyn Decl., Ex. K. The approximately $65 million designated as potentially Lazarenko-\n\nrelated, however, remained in the Registrar’s account. Id.\n\n               In 2010, Antiguan law enforcement authorities moved the High Court of Justice\n\nfor an order that would enforce this Court’s 2005 Restraining Order within Antigua. The\n\nauthorities, it appears, were acting pursuant to treaty obligations requiring the governments of\n\nAntigua and the United States to provide mutual assistance with respect to certain criminal\n\nmatters, including forfeiture actions. See Lewczyk Decl., Ex. K, ¶¶ 1-5, 34. The Liquidators\n\nopposed the motion on several grounds, see id. ¶¶ 7-19, but in October 2010 the High Court\n\ngranted the motion and ordered this Court’s restraining order registered in the High Court of\n\nJustice and given full effect in Antigua. See id. ¶ 41; id. (Order of Oct. 18, 2010) ¶¶ 1-3.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 42\n\f               The Liquidators appealed this order to the Court of Appeal for Antigua and\n\nBarbuda of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court, focusing their appeal on a single issue: the use\n\nof interest that had accrued on the funds being held in the Registrar’s account. See Lewczyk\n\nDecl., Ex. L, ¶ 21. The problem, as the Liquidators saw it, was that the restraining order\n\nappeared to require that accrued interest be individually credited to the former bank accounts of\n\nLazarenko, Milchenko, and their six affiliated companies, which were the source of the funds in\n\nthe Registrar’s account.16 The Liquidators, however, wanted to use the interest that was accruing\n\nin the Registrar’s account to fund the payment of innocent third-party depositors — rather than\n\ncredit this interest to the Lazarenko-related accounts (which would mean leaving it frozen and\n\nuntouched pending the forfeiture proceedings). Lewczyk Decl., Ex. K, ¶ 21. This Court’s\n\nrestraining order, which prevented them from doing so, conflicted with Antiguan law, according\n\nto the Liquidators: When an Antiguan bank goes into liquidation, they maintained, interest\n\nimmediately stops accruing on individual accounts, and no depositor may recoup any interest\n\naccruing on such an account after the date of liquidation. The restraining order, by contrast,\n\nrequires interest to accrue on frozen liquidated accounts and mandates that the interest be\n\ncredited to those accounts. Id. ¶¶ 13-19.\n\n               The Court of Appeal agreed with the Liquidators that, as a general matter, “any\n\ninterest which may accrue in this case is for the benefit of and use in liquidation proceedings as a\n\nwhole and cannot be credited to a specific creditor or depositor.” Lewczyk Decl., Ex. L, ¶ 23.\n\nBut the court concluded that the importance of forfeiture proceedings trumped the general\n       16\n                    Those bank accounts are individually enumerated in this Court’s restraining order,\nas they are in the amended complaint, and the restraining order directs that financial institutions\nholding the frozen funds “shall continue to credit to the accounts in which the Defendants In\nRem may be found any . . . interest . . . or other credits in the normal course of business and such\n. . . interest . . . shall be subject to this Order.” Restraining Order at 7 (July 8, 2005). The order\nof the High Court of Justice that enforced this Court’s restraining order included identical\nlanguage. Lewczyk Decl., Ex. K (Order of Oct. 18, 2010), ¶ 3(b).\n\n                                                 43\n\fprinciples of liquidation law that otherwise would govern the status of this interest. As the court\n\nexplained, the potentially Lazarenko-related funds are alleged to be the proceeds of crime, and\n\n“not only the principal but the interest thereon as well could be the proceeds of crime.” Id. ¶ 39.\n\nTherefore, because “[t]he interest is as much a part of the alleged proceeds of crime as the\n\nprincipal sum,” the interest “cannot be alienated from the principal to make the interest a part of\n\nfunds available to liquidators,” and “such principal and interests thereon that are proved, at the\n\nenforcement stage, to be the proceeds of criminal activity, are subject to be forfeited.” Id. The\n\ncourt therefore rejected the Liquidators’ appeal and affirmed the High Court’s decision to\n\nenforce this Court’s restraining order: “In this case principal and interest will remain frozen,\n\nunless otherwise ordered, pending the outcome of forfeiture proceedings.” Id. This result, the\n\ncourt explained, was also justified on public policy grounds, because allowing third-party\n\ndepositors and creditors to reap the interest accrued on funds that might be the proceeds of crime\n\nwould entitle them “to share in the benefit of criminally tainted money.” Id. ¶ 40. In sum, the\n\ncourt held that “in effect, the restraint order takes precedence over the winding up order.” Id.\n\n¶ 33.\n\n               The Court of Appeal’s decision clearly addressed only the question of whether\n\ninterest on the funds in the Registrar’s account would remain frozen pending forfeiture\n\nproceedings. Yet the plaintiff insists that the decision is much broader. According to the\n\nplaintiff, the decision held that Eurofed’s Liquidators have no legal interest in any of the still-\n\nfrozen Eurofed funds in the Registrar’s account. The plaintiff emphasizes the court’s statement\n\nthat “the restraint order requires that the principal funds, which may be the proceeds of crime, is\n\n[sic] not to be considered a part of the liquidation corpus of assets. By extension, the interest\n\naccrued on the principal funds cannot be caught by the liquidation.” Lewczyk Decl., Ex. L, ¶ 33.\n\n\n\n                                                  44\n\fIn support of its interpretation that the Court of Appeal thereby repudiated any legal interest of\n\nEurofed in the frozen money, the plaintiff submits an expert declaration from a member of the\n\nAntiguan bar averring that the “ratio decidende” of the court’s decision “was that such funds\n\nfrozen or restrained do not form part of the corpus of assets subject to liquidation,” and therefore\n\n“if such funds are confiscated, the bank in liquidation suffers no injury.” Declaration of Stephen\n\nA. Singh ¶¶ 5-6.\n\n                With all due respect to the plaintiff’s expert, this interpretation represents a\n\nmisreading of the Court of Appeal’s opinion. The court’s discussion is focused on the narrow\n\nissue of whether accrued interest deriving from potentially Lazarenko-related Eurofed accounts\n\ncould be segregated from the principal amounts and immediately used to fund the liquidation\n\nclaims of other depositors. In determining that the money could not be used in this way, the\n\ncourt did not conclude that Eurofed has no legal interest in that interest or the principal funds.\n\nThe fact that the court stated that “the principal funds, which may be the proceeds of crime,” are\n\n“not to be considered a part of the liquidation corpus of assets,” Lewczyk Decl., Ex. L, ¶ 33, does\n\nnot change this. The plaintiff once again is confusing a restraining order — which merely “seeks\n\nto conserve the assets until it can be further dealt with according to Law,” according to the very\n\norder that the Court of Appeal affirmed, see Lewczyk Decl., Ex. K, ¶ 37 — with the ultimate\n\ndetermination of forfeitability. The latter has not occurred yet, which is why the Court of Appeal\n\nstated that “principal and interest will remain frozen, unless otherwise ordered, pending the\n\noutcome of forfeiture proceedings.” Lewczyk Decl., Ex. L, ¶ 39 (emphasis added); see id.,\n\nEx. K, ¶ 37 (“At the forfeiture proceedings all relevant issues can be ventilated including the\n\nissue of the legal status of the interest referred to by the respondent in this application.”).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  45\n\f               One only has to think for a moment about the plaintiff’s position to appreciate its\n\ncircularity: First, the plaintiff obtains a restraining order from this Court freezing the defendant\n\nassets, pending a determination of their forfeitability. Next, an Antiguan court enforces that\n\norder domestically, ruling that the assets cannot be used for the liquidation pending the forfeiture\n\nproceedings. Finally, the plaintiff uses the order of the Antiguan court to obtain an order from\n\nthis Court that the Liquidators have no right to challenge the forfeiture at all — because an\n\nAntiguan court has prevented them from using the assets in the liquidation. One can readily\n\nappreciate why this scenario, in which a simple freeze order is transformed into a weapon\n\ndisposing of all parties who claim ownership of the frozen assets, is appealing to the plaintiff.\n\nSuch alchemy, however, contradicts the decisions of the Antiguan courts, which acknowledge\n\nthat the purpose of this Court’s restraining order, and of their enforcement of that order, is\n\nmerely to preserve the defendant assets pending the determination of whether they are subject to\n\nforfeiture. See Lewczyk Decl., Ex. K, ¶ 37; id., Ex. L, ¶ 39.\n\n\n                                        e. Surplus of Funds\n\n               The plaintiff also argues that Eurofed would suffer no injury from the forfeiture of\n\nthe defendant funds because the Liquidators already have more than enough money available to\n\nfund the liquidation to its completion. See Mem. at 39-40.\n\n               As noted, the Liquidators report that they have validated approximately 74 claims\n\nsubmitted by Eurofed depositors and creditors unrelated to Lazarenko and have distributed over\n\n$14 million to these claimants. Because the funds presently available to the Liquidators are\n\nlimited, however, and because an additional 107 claims have not yet been validated, the\n\nLiquidators have paid the validated claimants on a pro rata basis. They report that the balance\n\nstill owed to these 74 validated claimants is $3,180,171. They also report that the “potential\n\n\n                                                 46\n\fclaims” of the unvalidated claimants add up to $6,966,692. “Thus . . . the total potential\n\nremaining amount due to third party depositors and creditors unrelated to Lazarenko is\n\n$10,146,823,” while the “total unrestrained funds in the Liquidators’ possession . . . is\n\n$4,347,542, and therefore, there is a deficit in the liquidation estate of at least $5,799,280.”\n\nWalwyn Decl. ¶¶ 16-17.\n\n               The Liquidators acknowledge, in other words, that they have enough money on\n\nhand to compensate in full all 74 validated claimants, who so far have received only partial\n\npayment on their claims. Paying the balance on those validated claims, however, would leave\n\nonly around $1 million remaining for the payment of any successful claims among the 107\n\nclaims that are still unvalidated, the total value of which could approach $7 million. And\n\naccording to the Liquidators, they “may not pay verified claims in full as long as there are\n\noutstanding potential claims that exceed the assets available for distribution.” Walwyn Decl.\n\n¶ 17; see IBC Act § 289(3) (“When the amount available to pay the claims of any class of\n\nclaimant . . . is not sufficient to provide payment in full to claimants in that class, the amount\n\navailable shall be distributed on a pro rata basis among the claimants in that class.”).\n\n               The plaintiff responds that “after twelve and a half years of liquidation\n\nproceedings, it strains credulity to believe that the Liquidators — long standing partners of\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers — still have not completed the validation process.” Mem. at 40. The\n\nCourt, however, does not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence on a motion for\n\nsummary judgment. Czekalski v. Peters, 475 F.3d at 363. For the plaintiff to obtain summary\n\njudgment against Eurofed on the basis of this argument, it must demonstrate the absence of any\n\ngenuine issue of material fact about the lack of any remaining bona fide Eurofed liquidation\n\nclaims that have not yet been validated. That showing is not made by expressing incredulity.\n\n\n\n                                                  47\n\fThis line of attack, therefore, does not support the plaintiff’s request for judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw on the existing record.17\n\n                The plaintiff also suggests that the Court should simply discount the significance\n\nof Eurofed’s unvalidated liquidation claims. As noted, the Liquidators’ estimates show that even\n\nif all potential claims were found to be valid and require payment from the liquidation estate, the\n\ndeficit facing the estate would be less than $7 million. The plaintiff argues that the\n\n“hypothetical, future validation” of claims that will not exceed this figure is “an insufficient basis\n\nfor the Court to find that the Claimant Liquidators have constitutional standing to contest the\n\nforfeiture of all of the assets held for the benefit of Lazarenko and Milchenko and involved in\n\ntheir crimes.” Mem. at 40. That is particularly so, according to the plaintiff, because the\n\nunvalidated claimants in question “have so far been unable or unwilling to do what is necessary\n\nto finalize their claims in the liquidation.” Id.\n\n                As far as the Court can tell, the plaintiff seems to be suggesting that the standing\n\ninquiry incorporate some amorphous type of proportionality analysis, under which claimants\n\nwith a relatively small stake in a forfeiture (“small” here meaning potentially seven million\n\n\n\n        17\n                Perhaps lending some justification to the plaintiff’s skepticism, in June 2010 the\nLiquidators reported to the High Court of Justice that, among the unvalidated claimants (who\nnumbered 111 at the time of the report), 70 claimants had not responded to any of the\nLiquidators’ attempts to contact them, 17 had submitted only a portion of the information\nrequired to validate their claims, and the remaining 24 all had their Eurofed deposits frozen by\nthe Antiguan money-laundering authorities. Lewczyk Decl., Ex. V, at 2. With respect to the 70\nclaimants who had not responded at all, the Liquidators proposed to the High Court that, after a\nfinal attempt to reach these claimants, the Liquidators would “allocate these funds on a pro rata\nbasis to the other claimants.” Id. In reporting to this Court about the 107 claimants allegedly\nstill awaiting validation, nothing in the Liquidators’ filings or statement of facts mentions these\n70 wayward claimants. The Court also notes that between the Liquidators’ completion of their\nmost recent special interrogatory responses and the filing of their memorandum opposing\nsummary judgment — two years later — the Liquidators, by their own reckoning, validated at\nmost a single claim. See id., Ex. P, at 26 (reporting that “approximately 73” claims were\nvalidated); Walwyn Decl. ¶ 16 (reporting that “approximately 74” claims were validated).\n\n                                                    48\n\fdollars) be denied the right to contest the outcome of the forfeiture on that basis. No analysis or\n\nauthority of any kind is offered in support of this proposition, however.\n\n               More fundamentally, the plaintiff’s argument rests on the false premise that\n\nEurofed’s legal interest in the defendant assets is limited to whatever amount of money is\n\nnecessary to compensate the non-Lazarenko-related depositors and creditors who have made\n\nclaims in the liquidation. As explained above, however, Eurofed has a colorable ownership\n\ninterest in all of the funds being held in Antigua, along with a possessory interest in those funds\n\nand a financial stake in their disposition. See supra at 23-31. Although Eurofed, thus far, has\n\nbeen permitted by the courts only to pay off the claims of depositors and creditors who\n\nundeniably have no relationship with Lazarenko, no court has yet determined that the $65\n\nmillion in the Registrar’s account is traceable to or proceeds of Lazarenko’s crimes. Until that\n\nhappens, Eurofed has an interest in the fate of that money.\n\n\n                        f. Distinction Between Eurofed and its Liquidators\n\n               Even if Eurofed has standing to contest the forfeiture of the defendant assets, the\n\nplaintiff argues, this does not necessarily mean that its Liquidators may participate in these\n\nproceedings on the bank’s behalf. Maintaining that “liquidators are not coextensive with the\n\ncompany that they are liquidating,” and that “the interests of a liquidator and a company in\n\nliquidation necessarily are different,” the plaintiff asserts that “Claimant Liquidators and\n\nClaimant Eurofed Bank are, simply put, two distinct entities each advancing its own distinct\n\npurported interests.” Moreover, by “conflating these two interests,” the Liquidators have\n\n“confuse[d] the litigation and hamper[ed] . . . the Court’s ability to adjudicate[] the legal basis\n\nfor their participation in this action.” Mem. at 19, 21-22.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  49\n\f                Part of the plaintiff’s argument here is that the Liquidators’ court filings and\n\ndiscovery responses have obscured whether they are acting exclusively as Eurofed’s agents,\n\npressing the bank’s interests on the bank’s behalf, or whether they are asserting their own,\n\ndistinct legal interests in the defendant assets. See Mem. at 19-25. This contention is essentially\n\na variant on the plaintiff’s procedural argument for the dismissal of Eurofed’s claim, discussed\n\nbelow. See infra at 56-61.\n\n                The other aspect of the plaintiff’s argument presents a substantive question:\n\nwhether the liquidator of an Antiguan corporation is entitled to appear on behalf of the\n\ncorporation to contest the forfeiture of its assets, or whether the liquidator’s distinct legal identity\n\nmeans that he or she can only pursue whatever separate right he or she has, as a liquidator, to the\n\ncorporation’s assets. Basically, the plaintiff is challenging the very notion that Eurofed may\n\ncontest this forfeiture “by and through” its Liquidators. Euro. Cl. at 3. To address the questions\n\nraised by the plaintiff, one must engage in a two-step inquiry because, as noted above, “[s]tate\n\nlaw defines and classifies property interests for purposes of the forfeiture statutes, while federal\n\nlaw determines the effect of the property interest on the claimant’s standing.” United States v. 5\n\nS 351 Tuthill Rd., 233 F.3d at 1021.\n\n                With respect to Antiguan property interests, the matter is fairly straightforward.\n\nAs explained earlier, title to Eurofed’s assets remains with the bank during liquidation and does\n\nnot transfer to its liquidators. See supra at 27. Nevertheless, the IBC Act commands a liquidator\n\nto “take into his custody and control the property of the corporation” and empowers him or her to\n\n“bring, defend or take part in any civil, criminal or administrative action or proceeding in the\n\nname of and on behalf of the corporation.” IBC Act §§ 307(c), (d), 308(1)(b). Thus, Antiguan\n\nlaw expressly provides that Eurofed’s Liquidators will take control of the bank’s assets and\n\n\n\n                                                  50\n\frepresent Eurofed’s interests in legal proceedings. Even the plaintiff acknowledges that a\n\nliquidator “has the ability to act on the entity’s behalf.” Toube Decl. ¶ 27. The mere fact that a\n\nliquidator is “an agent” of the corporation, and thus a separate legal personage with his own\n\ndistinct identity, as emphasized by the plaintiff, see Mem. at 19 (citing Knowles v. Scott, [1891]\n\n1 Ch 717, 723), does not diminish the liquidator’s entitlement to act on behalf of the company\n\nand assert its interests in court. See Ayerst (Inspector of Taxes) v. C. & K. (Construction) Ltd.,\n\nA.C. at 180 (explaining that during liquidation “the actual custody, control, realisation and\n\ndistribution of the proceeds of the property which is subject to the statutory scheme are taken out\n\nof the hands of the legal owner of the property, the company, and vested in a third party, the\n\nliquidator, over whom the company has no control”).\n\n                Turning to the second part of the inquiry — the effect of these state-defined\n\nproperty interests on the federal standing analysis — the Court disagrees that the Liquidators’\n\nseparate legal identity from Eurofed deprives them of the right to challenge the forfeiture of\n\nEurofed’s assets on the bank’s behalf. Mr. Walwyn and Mr. Wilkinson have not sought to\n\nappear in their personal capacities in this action, but only in their official roles as liquidators of\n\nEurofed. “Acts performed by the same person in two different capacities ‘are generally treated\n\nas the transactions of two different legal personages.’” Bender v. Williamsport Area Sch. Dist.,\n\n475 U.S. 534, 543 (1986) (quoting F. JAMES & G. HAZARD, CIVIL PROCEDURE § 11.6, at 594 (3d\n\ned. 1985)). And where a corporation’s liquidators appear in their official capacities, federal\n\ncourts have permitted them to participate in forfeiture proceedings or intervene in civil actions on\n\nbehalf of their corporations. See United States v. $7,599,358.09, --- F. Supp. 2d ----, 2013 WL\n\n3086107, at *4-5 (D.N.J. June 18, 2013) (holding that liquidator of Illinois company had\n\nstanding to challenge civil forfeiture); Zurich Capital Markets Inc. v. Coglianese, 236 F.R.D.\n\n\n\n                                                   51\n\f379, 383-87 (N.D. Ill. 2006) (holding that liquidator of Bahamian company could intervene as of\n\nright in action that threatened assets of the company).18 These decisions are borne out of a\n\nrecognition that, during liquidation, there is no functional difference between the corporation and\n\nits liquidators insofar as the liquidators are acting in their roles as agents and representatives of\n\nthat corporation. See United States v. BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg), S.A., 48 F.3d 551, 554\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1995) (assessing standing of bank liquidators to contest forfeiture “in their capacities\n\nas branch liquidators”).\n\n               The plaintiff cites no cases holding that a liquidator — or any similarly appointed\n\nrepresentative such as a receiver, trustee, or estate administrator — lacks standing to contest a\n\nforfeiture because of the legal distinction between the appointed representative and the entity or\n\nestate he or she represents. Indeed, where our own court of appeals has denied liquidators\n\nstanding to challenge a forfeiture, the court did so precisely because the interests of the\n\nliquidators were indistinguishable from those of the banks on whose behalf they acted. While\n\nthese banks had already been found to lack standing, their liquidators “assert[ed] that, as legally\n\nauthorized liquidators, they ha[d] interests separate from the institutions they represent[d],” an\n\nassertion that the court rejected: “A bank liquidator, however, stands in the shoes of the bank it\n\nrepresents and enjoys precisely the same rights and interests.” United States v. BCCI Holdings\n\n(Luxembourg), S.A., 48 F.3d at 554.19\n\n\n       18\n                Although United States v. $7,599,358.09 involved a liquidator who held title to\nthe assets of his company under state law, nothing marks this factor as critical to the court’s\nanalysis. See 2013 WL 3086107, at *5.\n       19\n                As authority for the proposition that a bank liquidator “stands in the shoes of the\nbank it represents and enjoys precisely the same rights and interests,” the court of appeals in\nBCCI cited decisions that involved the rights of liquidators and receivers appointed pursuant to\nfederal statutes or under the laws of individual states. See United States v. BCCI Holdings\n(Luxembourg), S.A., 48 F.3d at 554. The property interests in this case, by contrast, are\ngoverned by Antiguan law, under which liquidators do not become the owners of their\n\n                                                  52\n\f               The Court therefore concludes that Eurofed’s Liquidators have every right to\n\nappear in their official capacity on behalf of the bank and challenge the forfeiture, presenting all\n\nof the claims and defenses that Eurofed may possess. Or, to put it another way, Eurofed may\n\nappear in this action “by and through” its Liquidators.20\n\n               It bears emphasis, however, that the Liquidators are entitled to participate here\n\nonly on behalf of Eurofed. Apparently unable to help themselves from adding one more\n\nargument to bolster their standing, even if it contradicts their otherwise consistent insistence that\n\nthey exclusively represent Eurofed’s interests, the Liquidators briefly argue that because they\n\n“owe the depositors and creditors of Eurofed certain statutory fiduciary duties,” they “are\n\nexposed to personal liability under Antiguan law if they fail to fulfill those duties.” Opp. at 34.\n\nBut the Court reiterates that any personal interests of Mr. Walwyn or Mr. Wilkinson, and any\n\ninjuries that they might suffer from the outcome of this action in their personal capacities, are\n\nirrelevant. Likewise, Eurofed may not vicariously represent the legal interests of its individual\n\ndepositors and creditors in this action, and its standing rests solely on its own institutional\n\ninterests in complying with the IBC Act and completing the liquidation. As the Liquidators\n\nthemselves make clear, they “are not asserting the rights of others,” but have “filed a claim on\n\nbehalf of Eurofed so that they would be able to fulfill their continuing statutory and fiduciary\n\n\n\ncorporation’s assets. The Court therefore emphasizes that it does not accept two arguments\nadvanced here by the Liquidators: that title to Eurofed’s assets passed to the Liquidators upon\ntheir appointment, see Opp. at 21, or that the Liquidators enjoy “all of the same rights and\ninterests” as Eurofed. Id. at 22 (emphasis added). The relevant point is that the distinction\nbetween Eurofed and its Liquidators is immaterial for purposes of standing to contest the\nforfeiture of Eurofed’s assets.\n       20\n                 The plaintiff’s contention that counsel for the Liquidators, in a status conference\nheld before Magistrate Judge Robinson in June 2011, admitted that the Liquidators “have no\ninterest in the Defendants In Rem,” Mem. at 29, is a mischaracterization of counsel’s comments.\nSee Levine Decl., Ex. 22, at 12-15; id., Ex. 23, at 17-18, 40-42; Opp. at 34-35.\n\n                                                  53\n\fduties.” Opp. at 44-45. The only claimant here is Eurofed, acting by and through its\n\nLiquidators. See Euro. Cl. at 3.\n\n\n              B. Defendant Funds Held on Deposit in Lithuania and Switzerland in\n                             Eurofed’s Correspondent Accounts\n\n                The foregoing discussion has addressed only two of the five in rem defendants in\n\nwhich Eurofed claims an interest: the assets located in Antigua and held at the Bank of Nova\n\nScotia in the account of the Registrar of the High Court of Justice. The remaining three in rem\n\ndefendants are all located in bank accounts that Eurofed formerly maintained in its own name\n\nwith financial institutions in Lithuania and Switzerland. Specifically, these three defendants\n\ncomprise funds held on Eurofed’s behalf at Vilniaus Bankas (Vilniaus, Lithuania), last valued at\n\napproximately $29.3 million; Credit Suisse (Geneva, Switzerland), last valued at approximately\n\n$4.8 million; and Banque SCS Alliance S.A. (Geneva, Switzerland), last valued at approximately\n\n$484,000. See Am. Compl. ¶ 5(f)-(h); Euro. Cl. at 3-4.\n\n                As a result of freeze orders issued in Lithuania and Switzerland, the Liquidators\n\nhave never been able to transfer these funds out of the countries and financial institutions where\n\nthey are located back to Antigua and into their own control. See Lewczyk Decl., Ex. I (first\n\nreport of the receivers), at 2-3; id. (supplemental affidavit), at 1; id., Ex. V, at 2; Declaration of\n\nMarlee Engel ¶ 5; Supplemental Declaration of Marlee Engel ¶ 6.\n\n                Although Eurofed bears the burden of establishing its standing to contest the\n\nforfeiture of these assets, it does not even attempt to show that the laws of Lithuania or\n\nSwitzerland give it a property interest in the funds located in those countries. As discussed\n\nearlier, Antiguan law provides that a customer’s financial deposits with a bank generally become\n\nassets of the bank; consequently, the customer is no longer the owner of the money. See supra\n\n\n\n                                                   54\n\fat 24. This principle endowed Eurofed with title to the funds that its customers deposited. But\n\nonce Eurofed itself, now acting as a customer, deposited some of these funds with financial\n\ninstitutions in Lithuania and Switzerland, application of the same rule would suggest that\n\nEurofed in turn lost title to those funds — unless, perhaps, the laws of Lithuania and Switzerland\n\nprovide differently for the property rights of bank depositors.\n\n               Eurofed has not argued that this is the case or presented any evidence supporting\n\nsuch an argument. The Court therefore has no basis from which to infer that Eurofed, as a\n\ndepositor of Vilniaus Bankas, Credit Suisse, and Banque SCS Alliance, is anything other than a\n\ngeneral, unsecured creditor of those banks. And the federal courts “have consistently held that\n\nunsecured creditors do not have standing to challenge the civil forfeiture of their debtors’\n\nproperty.” All Assets IV, 772 F. Supp. at 212 (quoting United States v. One-Sixth Share, 326\n\nF.3d at 41); see United States v. BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg), S.A., 46 F.3d 1185, 1191 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1995) (holding that “a general creditor can never have an interest in specific forfeited\n\nproperty”).\n\n               Nor has Eurofed shown any other way that it could have an ownership interest in\n\nthese particular in rem defendants. Since the date that Eurofed deposited these funds overseas,\n\nneither the bank nor its Liquidators have ever regained possession of the funds or exerted any\n\ndominion or control over them. That puts these defendant assets in a fundamentally different\n\nposition from those located in Antigua: the Liquidators secured the return of those assets from\n\nthe United States and held them for months in their own trust account before turning them over\n\nto the Registrar of the High Court of Justice. Not so for the assets in Lithuania and Switzerland.\n\nMoreover, Eurofed has not demonstrated that it has any financial stake in these particular funds.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 55\n\fRather, it appears that the bank, at most, has a damages claim against the three financial\n\ninstitutions holding those funds if they unlawfully refuse to return them.\n\n               Thus, Eurofed has not established a colorable ownership interest in the defendant\n\nassets named in paragraph 5(f), 5(g), and 5(h) of the amended complaint, and thus it has not\n\ncarried its burden of demonstrating its standing to contest their forfeiture. As a practical matter,\n\nthis determination may not have much effect on Eurofed’s pursuit of its interests here, because\n\nthe Lithuania and Switzerland assets are allegedly derived from the same funds as those in\n\nAntigua, the forfeitability of which Eurofed has the right to contest.\n\n\n                                     C. Procedural Objections\n\n               Apart from the question of whether Eurofed and its Liquidators have a sufficient\n\ninterest in the defendant assets to contest their forfeiture, the plaintiff argues that neither Eurofed\n\nnor the Liquidators have complied with the procedural requirements governing asset forfeiture\n\nclaims and that Eurofed’s claim should be dismissed on this basis. See Mem. at 18-25. This\n\nargument represents a procedural counterpoint to the plaintiff’s substantive effort to separate\n\nEurofed from its Liquidators on the basis of their ostensibly distinct legal interests. The Court\n\nfinds this variant equally unpersuasive.\n\n               “To contest the forfeiture of property that has been named as a defendant in a civil\n\nforfeiture action, a claimant must proceed ‘in the manner set forth in the Supplemental Rules for\n\nCertain Admiralty and Maritime Claims [and Asset Forfeiture Actions.]’” All Assets II, 664 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 101 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 983(a)(4)(A)). A would-be claimant “must file with the\n\ncourt presiding over the forfeiture action a claim that (1) ‘identif[ies] the specific property\n\nclaimed,’ (2) ‘identif[ies] the claimant and state[s] the claimant’s interest in the property,’ and\n\n(3) is ‘signed by the claimant under penalty of perjury.’” Id. (quoting SUPP. R.\n\n\n                                                  56\n\fG(5)(a)(i)(A)-(C)). “She or he must also file either a motion to dismiss the government’s\n\ncomplaint or an answer to that complaint[.]” Id. (citing SUPP. R. G(5)(b)).\n\n                Eurofed intervened in these proceedings by filing a timely claim asserting an\n\ninterest in the Eurofed-related defendant assets. See Euro. Cl. Eurofed’s verified statement\n\nidentifies the claimant as “Eurofed Bank Limited (in liquidation), by and through its Receivers,\n\nRobert J. Wilkinson and Charles Walwyn (collectively ‘Eurofed’).” Id. at 3 (emphasis added).\n\nLeaving no doubt of the claimant’s identity, the document is titled “Eurofed Bank Limited’s (In\n\nLiquidation) Rule C(6)(A) Verified Statement,” see id. at 1, and the counsel who signed it are\n\nidentified as “Attorneys for Claimant Eurofed Bank Limited, In Liquidation.” Id. at 5.\n\n                A timely answer to the complaint was later filed by the same counsel, but this\n\nanswer consistently identifies the “claimants” as the “Liquidators of European Federal Credit\n\nBank (In Liquidation),” Euro. Ans. at 1; see id. at 2 (same); id. at 27 (same), rather than Eurofed\n\nitself, acting “by and through” its liquidators.\n\n                As a result of the discrepancy between these two filings, the plaintiff argues that\n\n“two claimants are appearing in this action with respect to Eurofed Bank Limited” — the bank\n\nitself and the Liquidators. Mem. at 18. And because, as the plaintiff sees it, the Liquidators did\n\nnot file a claim, while Eurofed did not file an answer, both claimants should be dismissed. See\n\nid. at 18-22.\n\n                As the Court has explained, the Liquidators have been empowered by Antiguan\n\nstatute and court order to “bring, defend or take part in any civil, criminal or administrative\n\naction or proceeding in the name of and on behalf of” Eurofed. IBC Act § 308(1)(b). Indeed,\n\nsince the powers of Eurofed’s directors and shareholders have ceased and “are vested in the\n\nliquidator,” id. § 305(1)(a), the only way that Eurofed can proceed through this or any other legal\n\n\n\n                                                   57\n\faction is through its Liquidators. Reflecting this state of affairs, Eurofed’s verified claim\n\nindicates that the bank is appearing “by and through” its liquidators. Euro. Cl. at 2. But the\n\nstatement clearly identifies “Eurofed” as the claimant, asserting that the bank is “the legal owner\n\nof the accounts and/or funds” in question, and that “[b]y virtue of [this] legal ownership . . .\n\nEurofed declares its right to defend this action.” Id. at 4.\n\n               Subsequent filings, it is true, have freely interchanged “Eurofed” with “the\n\nLiquidators of Eurofed” in identifying the claimant, beginning with the answer. But these filings\n\nmake clear that the Liquidators are acting in their roles as representatives of Eurofed, and the\n\nfilings reflect an implicit understanding that there is no difference between the bank and its\n\nliquidators as far as their participation in this action is concerned. See, e.g., Dkt. No. 223 at 1\n\n(identifying the claimant as “‘the Liquidators’ or ‘Eurofed’”); Lewczyk Decl., Ex. P, at 1\n\n(identifying the claimant as “‘the Liquidators’ or ‘the Bank’”). That the plaintiff itself has never\n\nbeen confused by this inconsistency, or believed that Eurofed and its Liquidators were separate\n\nclaimants, is clear from the special interrogatories that the plaintiff served on the Liquidators,\n\nwhich provide: “The term ‘you’ or ‘your’ means both Eurofed and the Liquidators of Eurofed.”\n\nLewczyk Decl., Ex. U, at 2.\n\n               Given all this, it cannot seriously be argued that “Eurofed Bank has not filed an\n\nAnswer in this action,” Mem. at 7, or that Eurofed’s claim should be stricken because the\n\nLiquidators chose to identify themselves as the “claimants” in their answer to the complaint. The\n\npurpose of an answer, in civil forfeiture actions, as elsewhere, “is to give reasonable notice of the\n\nallegations in the complaint sought to be placed in issue.” United States v. 1866.75 Board Feet\n\nand 11 Doors and Casings, No. 07-1100, 2008 WL 839792, at *2 (E.D. Va. Mar. 25, 2008)\n\n(citing 5 CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT & ARTHUR MILLER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE\n\n\n\n                                                  58\n\f§ 1261 (3d ed. 2004)). The answer filed by the Liquidators does just that, admitting some of the\n\ncomplaint’s allegations, denying others, and setting forth a host of affirmative defenses. See\n\nEuro. Ans. Thus, the inconsistency in identification of the “claimant” between the claim and the\n\nanswer has by no means left “the Government and the court guessing as to which allegations in\n\nthe complaint are admitted and which will require proof at trial.” Reply at 13.21\n\n               The plaintiff’s real gripe is with the Liquidators’ responses to the plaintiff’s\n\nspecial interrogatories. Such interrogatories play an important role in civil forfeiture actions,\n\nbecause they allow the government “to gather information that bears on the claimant’s standing,”\n\nSUPP. R. G(6)(a), Advisory Committee Notes, 2006 Adoption, and promptly move to dismiss\n\nfrom the proceedings claimants who lack such standing. See supra at 15. The plaintiff argues\n\nthat the Liquidators have responded to these special interrogatories only by addressing their own\n\nrelationship, as appointed liquidators, to the assets claimed by Eurofed, rather than responding on\n\nbehalf of Eurofed itself and explaining the nature of the bank’s legal interest in those assets. See\n\nMem. at 22-23.\n\n               The plaintiff has a point. For instance, in response to a question asking for “the\n\ndate on which you acquired . . . an interest” in certain assets, the Liquidators’ response cites only\n\nthe facts surrounding the commencement of the liquidation and their own appointment as\n\nliquidators, saying nothing about when Eurofed’s interest in the property arose. See Lewczyk\n\nDecl., Ex. P, at 4-6. In response to an inquiry about “the ownership or other nature of your\n\n       21\n                 The plaintiff spends considerable time belaboring portions of the Liquidators’\nanswer that disclaim knowledge about certain assertions made in the complaint — apparently to\nsuggest that the answer does not actually speak for Eurofed (because the bank presumably would\nhave knowledge of the matters in question). As the Liquidators have explained, however, much\nof the plaintiff’s discussion to this effect is misleading: the denials in question do not simply\ndeny awareness of undisputed facts that Eurofed itself must surely know, but rather dispute\nspecific characterizations about the defendant assets with which the Liquidators disagree.\nIdentifying such points of disagreement is one function of an answer.\n\n                                                 59\n\finterest and all facts and legal bases that support your claim,” the Liquidators’ brief response is\n\nconfined to the nature of their own relationship to the property, saying not a whit about the\n\nnature of Eurofed’s interest in the property or what facts or legal bases support that alleged\n\ninterest. Id. This pattern pervades the Liquidators’ interrogatory responses.\n\n               The solution to this deficiency, however, would have been to move to compel\n\nmore complete responses from Eurofed. Instead, as recounted earlier, the plaintiff took the more\n\naggressive step of moving to dismiss Eurofed’s claim entirely under Supplemental\n\nRule G(8)(c)(i)(A) — which permits dismissal for certain procedural noncompliance — based\n\nupon the inadequacy of these discovery responses. See supra at 16-17. Only in the alternative\n\ndid the plaintiff request that the Liquidators be compelled to supplement their responses. See\n\nDkt. No. 244. In arguing for dismissal under Supplemental Rule G(8)(c)(i)(A), however, the\n\nplaintiff mixed its discussion with direct attacks on the Liquidators’ standing — a challenge\n\nproperly brought through a motion to dismiss for lack of standing under Supplemental\n\nRule G(8)(c)(i)(B). After receiving a clear indication from the Court that it was not likely to\n\ndismiss Eurofed’s claim based on inadequate interrogatory responses, the plaintiff agreed to brief\n\nthe question of Eurofed’s standing on the existing record without further discovery, rather than\n\nhave the Court address its objections to the interrogatory responses. See supra at 17-18. But\n\nnow, having filed a motion challenging Eurofed’s standing as a substantive matter, the plaintiff is\n\nattempting to revive its procedural objections. It simply couches its argument in new terms —\n\nby suggesting that it is not objecting to the inadequacy of the interrogatory responses, as before,\n\nbut to “Eurofed Bank’s failure to respond at all” to the interrogatories. Mem. at 3.\n\n               Simply put, this will not fly. Whatever deficiency exists in the interrogatory\n\nresponses, insofar as they fail to adequately address questions about Eurofed’s interest in the\n\n\n\n                                                 60\n\fdefendant assets, the Court does not agree that Eurofed has “failed to respond at all” to those\n\ninterrogatories, and it will not strike Eurofed’s claim on this basis.\n\n\n                                      D. Prudential Standing\n\n               Finally, the plaintiff argues that Eurofed’s claim should be dismissed as a matter\n\nof “prudential standing,” because the bank’s asserted interest in the defendant assets purportedly\n\ndoes not satisfy the definition of an “owner” under 18 U.S.C. § 983(d)(6). That definition is part\n\nof the “innocent owner defense,” which allows claimants to defeat a civil forfeiture by proving\n\ntheir innocent ownership of the res by a preponderance of the evidence. Id. § 983(d)(1).\n\n               Eurofed need not prove at this juncture that it is an innocent owner under Section\n\n983(d)(6), and any suggestion to the contrary “conflates the requirements of standing with the\n\nultimate merits of the Liquidator[s’] affirmative defense to defeat forfeiture.” United States v.\n\n$7,599,358.09, --- F. Supp. 2d ----, 2013 WL 3086107, at *4. “The jurisprudence on civil\n\nforfeiture cases makes clear that the threshold requirement of a claimant’s standing is not\n\nrigorous and does not depend on proof of the underlying merits of the claim.” Id. (citing United\n\nStates v. One Lincoln Navigator, 328 F.3d at 1013); see United States v. 1100 Peeler Ave.,\n\nLakeland, Lanier Cnty., Georgia, 2007 WL 4289692, at *4 (“This Court has scoured the civil\n\nforfeiture statutes and relevant cases and has been unable to find anything that supports the\n\nnotion that a claimant can only pursue a claim to defendant property if [it] proves both standing\n\nand ownership.”).\n\n               Even the decisions cited by the plaintiff acknowledge that a claimant “need not\n\nprove that he is in fact an innocent owner of the property” in order to have standing, United\n\nStates v. $746,198 in U.S. Currency, More or Less, 299 F. Supp. 2d 923, 933 (S.D. Iowa 2004),\n\nand that the claimant’s satisfaction of Section 983(d)(6) is “an element of the innocent owner’s\n\n\n                                                  61\n\fclaim on the merits.” United States v. $165,580 in U.S. Currency, 502 F. Supp. 2d 114, 122 (D.\n\nMe. 2007) (quoting United States v. One Lincoln Navigator, 328 F.3d at 1014). Innocent\n\nownership “remains an affirmative defense,” which the claimant must prove only after the\n\ngovernment first meets its own burden of “proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the\n\nproperty is subject to forfeiture.” United States v. 2000 Toyota Celica, No. 04-3063, 2005 WL\n\n1502902, at *4 (E.D. Wash. June 23, 2005) (citing 18 U.S.C. § 983(c)(1)).\n\n               None of the decisions relied upon by the plaintiff in support of this argument\n\nactually discuss prudential standing. These decisions all hinge on a claimant’s lack of statutory\n\nstanding, where there is no possibility that the claimant can prove innocent ownership of the\n\ndefendant property — either because the facts pled by the claimant do not support any ownership\n\ninterest satisfying the criteria of Section 983(d)(6), or because the evidence unequivocally shows\n\nthat the claimant lacks such an ownership interest. See, e.g., United States v. 8 Gilcrease Lane,\n\n641 F. Supp. 2d 1, 5 (D.D.C. 2009); United States v. $165,580, 502 F. Supp. 2d at 123; United\n\nStates v. 74.05 Acres of Land, 428 F. Supp. 2d 57, 62-65 (D. Conn. 2006); United States v.\n\n$746,198, 299 F. Supp. 2d at 933; United States v. One 2004 Land Rover Range Rover, No.\n\n07-818S, 2009 WL 909669, at *5-6 (W.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2009). But that is not the case here.\n\nSection 983(d)(6)(A) defines an “owner” as “a person with an ownership interest in the specific\n\nproperty sought to be forfeited,” and Eurofed has made a colorable showing of such an interest.\n\nSee supra at 23-31. While Section 983(d)(6)(B) excludes unsecured creditors, bailees, and\n\nnominees from the definition of “owner,” none of these categories encompasses the ownership\n\ninterest that Eurofed has asserted and that it has supported with evidence. This final bid to\n\ndismiss Eurofed’s claim therefore fails as well.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   62\n\f                                        V. CONCLUSION\n\n               While the plaintiff’s myriad arguments have put Eurofed through its paces, not\n\none of these arguments carries the day. Eurofed, acting by and through its Liquidators, has\n\ndemonstrated that it has a colorable ownership interest in the defendant assets located in Antigua.\n\nIt therefore has standing to contest the forfeiture of those assets, and its claim to them will\n\nsurvive the plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment. That Eurofed has satisfied the criteria\n\nnecessary to establish standing at the summary judgment stage, however, does not mean that the\n\nCourt “may not revisit the issue at later stages in the litigation.” United States v. $148,840 in\n\nU.S. Currency, 521 F.3d at 1278.\n\n               An Order consistent with this Opinion will issue this same day.\n\n               SO ORDERED.\n\n\n                                               /s/__________________________\n                                               PAUL L.

A number of people, preferring that the\n\nUnited States government not get this money, have intervened to prevent its forfeiture. So far,\n\nplaintiff United States has managed to dismiss from this action seven of these intervening parties\n\nand has successfully defeated a motion to dismiss the complaint.\n\n               The plaintiff now moves to dismiss from the action, for lack of standing, one\n\nmore claimant: European Federal Credit Bank Limited (“Eurofed”), an Antiguan bank in\n\nliquidation. And here the plaintiff’s winning streak comes to an end, because the Court\n\nconcludes that Eurofed, acting by and through its appointed liquidators, has standing to contest\n\nthe forfeiture of the defendant assets that are located in Antigua and Barbuda. As for the\n\fremaining assets to which Eurofed lays claim, however — those located in Lithuania and\n\nSwitzerland — the Court agrees with the plaintiff that Eurofed has not demonstrated its standing\n\nto contest their forfeiture. The Court therefore will grant the plaintiff’s motion in part and deny\n\nit in part.1\n\n\n                                         I. BACKGROUND\n\n                                 A. Nature of the Forfeiture Action\n\n                The United States initiated this litigation in 2004, seeking the forfeiture of money\n\nthat is allegedly traceable to a series of acts of “criminal fraud, extortion, bribery,\n\nmisappropriation, and money laundering” carried out by, among others, Pavel Ivanovich\n\nLazarenko, a.k.a. Pavlo Lazarenko, a prominent Ukrainian politician who, with the aid of various\n\nassociates, was “able to acquire hundreds of millions of United States dollars through a variety of\n\nacts of fraud, extortion, bribery, misappropriation and/or embezzlement” committed during the\n\n1990s. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 1, 10. According to the United States, those illegal acts, and subsequent\n\nattempts to launder the resulting criminal proceeds, involved the transfer of large sums of U.S.\n\ndollars into and out of United States financial institutions. Id. ¶¶ 11-13.

Cir. 2012).\n\n                                                   2\n\fforfeiture to the United States government of funds traceable or otherwise related to criminal\n\nactivity that occurred at least in part in the United States. See id. ¶ 1.\n\n\n                                   B. Eurofed and its Liquidation\n\n                As permitted by the civil forfeiture statutes, several parties filed claims in this\n\naction asserting an interest in specific property sought by the plaintiff and contesting its\n\nforfeiture. At issue here is the claim submitted by an Antiguan bank, Eurofed, which is now in\n\nthe process of being liquidated under the laws of Antigua. The plaintiff alleges that, before its\n\nliquidation, Eurofed was used by Lazarenko to launder proceeds of his criminal activities. Over\n\n$100 million of the funds named as in rem defendants in the plaintiff’s complaint are alleged to\n\nhave been formerly held on deposit for Lazarenko’s benefit at Eurofed. See Am. Compl.\n\n¶ 5(d)-(h).\n\n                Eurofed, acting by and through its appointed liquidators (the “Liquidators”), has\n\nintervened in this action, asserting an interest in five of the specific properties being sought by\n\nthe plaintiff and named in paragraphs 5(d) through 5(h) of the amended complaint:\n\n                Approximately $85.5 million in United States dollars held at Bank\n                of Nova Scotia (Antigua) in the name of the Registrar of the High\n                Court of Antigua & Barbuda;\n\n                Approximately $1.6 million in United States dollars held at Bank\n                of Nova Scotia (Antigua) in the name of the Registrar of the High\n                Court of Antigua & Barbuda;\n\n                All assets held at Credit Suisse (Geneva), in account number 0251-\n                562927-6, in the name of European Federal Credit Bank Limited,\n                last valued at approximately $4.8 million in United States dollars;\n\n                All assets held at Banque SCS Alliance S.A. (Geneva) in account\n                number 5491, in the name of European Federal Credit Bank\n                Limited, last valued at approximately $483,629.69 in United States\n                dollars;\n\n\n\n                                                   3\n\f               All assets held at Vilniaus Bankas [Lithuania] held for the benefit\n               of European Federal Credit Bank Limited, formerly held at\n               accounts 073721 and 073420 at Bankas Hermis in the name of\n               European Federal Credit Bank Limited, last valued at\n               approximately $29,344,05.35 in United States dollars.\n\nEuro. Cl. at 3-4; see Am. Compl. ¶ 5(d)-(h). Eurofed has also asserted an interest in the\n\nplaintiff’s catch-all in rem defendant: “All assets traceable to the above-mentioned proceeds and\n\nproperty.” Am. Compl. ¶ 5(j); see Euro. Cl. at 4.2\n\n               Because many of the arguments raised in connection with Eurofed’s standing to\n\ncontest the forfeiture of these assets hinge on the precise details of Eurofed’s history and\n\nliquidation, a detailed account of both is necessary.\n\n               The plaintiff alleges that Lazarenko and an associate, Peter Kiritchenko, obtained\n\na controlling interest in Eurofed in 1997, becoming majority shareholders of the bank and\n\nplacing Lazarenko in control of its investment decisions. See Plaintiff’s Statement of Facts\n\n(“Pl.’s Stmnt.”) ¶¶ 1, 4. Lazarenko and his criminal associates were both the bank’s primary\n\nowners, the plaintiff alleges, and also its primary depositors. Id. ¶¶ 2-4. According to the\n\nplaintiff, the funds held by Eurofed on Lazarenko’s behalf were spread across a number of bank\n\naccounts — one in Lazarenko’s own name and six in the names of corporate entities that he\n\nallegedly controlled: Lady Lake Investments; Fairmont Group, Ltd.; Firststar Securities, Ltd.;\n\nGuardian Investment Group, Ltd.; Nemuro Industrial Group; and Orby International, Ltd. Id.\n\n¶ 5(d). Eurofed is alleged to have held security deposits for two of these companies as well. Id.\n\n               According to the plaintiff, by the end of 1997 over $100 million of Lazarenko’s\n\nmoney was held by Eurofed in these accounts. Pl.’s Stmnt. ¶ 4. In addition, the plaintiff alleges,\n\n\n\n       2\n                In addition to the Eurofed-related in rem defendants, the complaint also seeks\nforfeiture of over $150 million in funds located in Guernsey and Liechtenstein with no alleged\nconnection to Eurofed or Antigua. See Am. Compl. ¶ 5(a)-(c), (i).\n\n                                                 4\n\fapproximately $1.6 million was formerly held on deposit at Eurofed in the account of\n\nLazarenko’s associate Alexander Milchenko. Id. ¶ 5(e).\n\n               Eurofed’s Liquidators acknowledge that in 1997 Lazarenko obtained an\n\nownership interest in the bank, but they profess to lack enough information to confirm that he\n\nand his associates were the majority depositors. See Eurofed’s Statement of Facts (“Euro.\n\nStmnt.”) ¶ 3. The reason for this uncertainty, they say, is that in the course of their duties they\n\nhave not yet been able to determine whether the six companies allegedly affiliated with\n\nLazarenko truly were owned or controlled by him. Id. And the funds of those six companies\n\nmake up the bulk of the money at issue here: Lazarenko’s personal bank account appears to\n\nhave held only approximately $150,000 by 1999, while the combined value of the six\n\ncompanies’ accounts exceeded $93 million. Moreover, the Liquidators, while seemingly\n\nacknowledging that Lazarenko exerted some influence over Eurofed’s actions and was more than\n\na mere depositor, do not concede that he exerted total control over the bank or its investment\n\ndecisions. Id. ¶ 4. The Liquidators also emphasize that Eurofed held millions of dollars in\n\ndeposits from third parties who had no connection with Lazarenko. Id.; see Declaration of\n\nCharles William Augustine Walwyn ¶ 6 (estimating that innocent third parties had in excess of\n\n$25 million on deposit at Eurofed when it went into liquidation).\n\n               Eurofed apparently maintained few of its deposits in Antigua itself. Instead, it\n\nestablished “correspondent” bank accounts in its own name at various other financial institutions\n\naround the world, in which it stored the bulk of the money deposited by its customers. See\n\nDeclaration of Andrew Lewczyk, Ex. P, at 5. “These correspondent bank accounts were not held\n\nfor the benefit of any particular depositor,” according to the Liquidators. “As a result, a\n\ncustomer’s deposits were not located in any particular location or correspondent account.” Id.\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fat 8. In other words, if hypothetical Eurofed customers Sally, Sam, and Sue each deposited $40\n\nwith Eurofed in Antigua, the bank may well have divided that $120 among four of its own\n\ncorrespondent bank accounts in Switzerland, Lithuania, Liechtenstein, and the United States\n\n(placing, say, $30 into each account), making it impossible to trace Sally’s $40 deposit to any of\n\nEurofed’s four correspondent accounts.\n\n               In 1999, Antiguan government authorities with responsibility over financial\n\ncrimes began to investigate Eurofed. Walwyn Decl. ¶ 2. That fall, the nation’s Office of Drug\n\nand Money Laundering Control Policy (“ONDCP”) applied to the High Court of Justice of\n\nAntigua and Barbuda for an order freezing all Eurofed assets linked to Lazarenko. Id. The High\n\nCourt granted this request in an order dated October 29, 1999, prohibiting Lazarenko and several\n\nof his associates and affiliated companies from removing any of their funds from Antigua or in\n\nany way disposing of or diminishing those funds. Id., Ex. B, at 2. The apparent basis for this\n\nrestraining order was Lazarenko’s criminal prosecution in Switzerland on money laundering\n\ncharges, for which he was later convicted, and the alleged connection between those charges and\n\nthe funds held at Eurofed. See id., Ex. H.\n\n               On November 15, 1999, the Antiguan financial authorities placed Eurofed into\n\nreceivership, pursuant to the International Business Corporations Act of Antigua and Barbuda\n\n(the “IBC Act”). See Declaration of Nicolette M. Doherty, Exs. B, C. Charles Walwyn and\n\nDonald Ward, from the accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers Antigua, were appointed as\n\nreceiver-managers, and these appointments were confirmed on November 25, 1999 by the High\n\nCourt of Justice, which ordered the receivers to reorganize the bank. See id., Exs. C, D. Under\n\nthe IBC Act, the receivers were charged, among other things, with “taking into [their] custody\n\n\n\n\n                                                6\n\fand control the property of the Bank” and “opening and maintaining a bank account or accounts\n\nfor the moneys of the Bank coming under [their] control.” Id., Ex. C, at 1.\n\n               In fulfillment of their responsibilities, in late November 1999 the receivers\n\ntransferred approximately $76 million to Antigua that was being held in Eurofed correspondent\n\nbank accounts located within the United States. The Liquidators kept this money in a trust\n\naccount that they established for Eurofed funds. Pl.’s Stmnt. ¶¶ 6-7; Euro. Stmnt. ¶¶ 6-7.3\n\n               On December 3, 1999, the High Court of Justice rescinded its previous\n\nreceivership order and instead directed that Eurofed be liquidated and dissolved pursuant to the\n\nIBC Act. See Walwyn Decl., Ex. E. The court appointed Mr. Walwyn and Mr. Ward as\n\nliquidators, providing that they be remunerated at an hourly rate for their work from the funds of\n\nthe bank. Id., Ex. E, at 2.4\n\n               Under the IBC Act, a liquidator “must,” among other responsibilities, “take into\n\nhis custody and control the property of the corporation,” “open and maintain a trust account for\n\nthe moneys of the corporation received and paid out to him,” and, “after his final accounts are\n\napproved by the court, distribute any remaining property of the corporation among the\n\nshareholders according to their respective rights.” IBC Act § 307(c), (d), (f). The Act also\n\npermits a liquidator to “bring, defend or take part in any civil, criminal or administrative action\n\nor proceeding in the name of and on behalf of the corporation.” Id. § 308(1)(b).\n\n\n       3\n               By contrast, the Liquidators have not been able to secure the return of other\nEurofed funds that were held in overseas correspondent accounts back to Antigua. Specifically,\nEurofed deposits are still being maintained in accounts at Credit Suisse in Switzerland (last\nvalued at approximately $4.8 million), Banque SCS Alliance S.A. in Switzerland (last valued at\nnearly $500,000), and Vilniaus Bankas in Lithuania (last valued at approximately $29.3 million).\nThe Eurofed deposits located at these three institutions make up the in rem defendants named in\nparagraphs 5(f), 5(g), and 5(h) of the plaintiff’s complaint.\n       4\n             The High Court of Justice later appointed Robert Wilkinson to replace Mr. Ward.\nWalwyn Decl. ¶ 5.\n\n                                                  7\n\f               On July 7, 2000, granting an ex parte application by the ONDCP, the Antiguan\n\nHigh Court of Justice issued an order directing that “all funds of Pavel Lazarenko and all his\n\nassociated accounts frozen by Order of this Court” (in October of the previous year) be forfeited\n\nto the Antiguan government. Walwyn Decl., Ex. F, at 2. The Liquidators were ordered to pay\n\nthose funds — specified in the order as $114,919,356.82, “or such amount thereof as remains in\n\nthe Liquidators’ hands,” along with any accrued interest — into an Antiguan government bank\n\naccount at the Bank of Nova Scotia in St. John’s, Antigua. Id.\n\n               Both Lazarenko and the Liquidators promptly appealed this forfeiture order to the\n\nCourt of Appeal for Antigua and Barbuda of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court. See\n\nWalwyn Decl., Ex. H, at 1. Lazarenko also moved the appellate court for a stay of the forfeiture\n\norder pending his appeal. Id., Ex. G, at 1. The Court of Appeal granted Lazarenko’s motion for\n\na stay and ordered that, pending the appeal, the funds be placed into an interest-bearing account\n\nheld at the Bank of Nova Scotia in the name of the Registrar of the High Court of Justice. Id.\n\nThe preexisting freeze order from October 1999 remained in force. Id.\n\n               The Liquidators complied with the order and transferred the funds. This is how\n\nthe assets listed in paragraphs 5(d) and 5(e) of the plaintiff’s complaint in this action came to be\n\n“held at Bank of Nova Scotia (Antigua) in the name of the Registrar of the High Court of\n\nAntigua Barbuda.” Am. Compl. ¶ 5(d), (e).\n\n               The Liquidators’ appeal of the July 7, 2000 Antiguan forfeiture order was stayed\n\nby agreement of the parties, see Walwyn Decl., Ex. J, ¶ 4, while Lazarenko’s appeal of that order\n\ncontinued and ultimately succeeded. On April 27, 2001, the Court of Appeal ruled that the\n\nOctober 29, 1999 freeze order and the July 7, 2000 forfeiture order were not authorized by the\n\nAntiguan money laundering statute under the authority of which they ostensibly were issued.\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\fThe appellate court held that at the time of the orders no evidence had been presented to the High\n\nCourt linking the funds on deposit at Eurofed with the money laundering crime for which\n\nLazarenko was convicted in Switzerland. Because the Antiguan money laundering statute\n\nrequired such a showing to be made, both the freeze order and the forfeiture order were invalid.\n\nSee id., Ex. H, ¶ 1.5\n\n                A few days after the Court of Appeal ruled that the forfeiture and freeze orders\n\nwere invalid, the Antiguan money laundering authorities applied for a new freeze order from the\n\nHigh Court of Justice. That court issued another ex parte order on May 2, 2001, directing that\n\n“[a]ll the rights and interests” of Lazarenko, “whether in his name or otherwise,” be “frozen until\n\nfurther order.” Walwyn Decl., Ex. I, ¶¶ 1-2. This order applied to any interests of Lazarenko in\n\nmoney held “within the account maintained by the Registrar . . . at the St John’s Branch of the\n\nNova Scotia Bank” or “within any account maintained by the liquidators of Eurofed Bank Ltd.”\n\nId.\n\n                In light of this new freeze order, Eurofed’s Liquidators applied for their own order\n\nfrom the High Court of Justice later that month. The Liquidators explained to the court that the\n\nmoney held in the account of the Registrar of the High Court of Justice — where it had been\n        5\n                The Justice on the Court of Appeal who authored the judgment explained that the\nforfeiture order was “premature” because it “did not comply with the strict provisions” of\nSection 20(2a) of the Antiguan Money Laundering (Prevention) Act. Walwyn Decl., Ex. H,\n¶ 17. Under the money laundering statute, the court ruled, “the property to be frozen must be\nproved to have been derived from or connected with the offence committed in Switzerland. And\nunlike the learned Trial Judge . . . I am unable to see that the required connection has been\nestablished. I am of the view that there was no evidence that the large sum of money which the\nlearned Trial Judge ordered to be frozen was derived from or in connection with the offence with\nwhich [Lazarenko] was charged and convicted in Switzerland.” Id. ¶ 31. Therefore, “the learned\nTrial Judge had no power, authority, or jurisdiction to invoke section 20(2a) of the Act to make\nthe freezing order on October 29, 1999. It follows that the consequent forfeiture order made\nunder section 20(2a) must also be bad. Indeed, in his submission learned Counsel for the\nRespondent recognized that it was for the [Antiguan government] to show under section 20(2a)\nthat the property, proceeds or instrumentalities are at the time of the application derived from or\nconnected with the offence for which a person has been charged.” Id. ¶ 32.\n\n                                                 9\n\fordered deposited for safekeeping pending Lazarenko’s appeal of the now-vacated forfeiture\n\norder — made up the vast majority of the liquidation estate. Walwyn Decl., Ex. J, ¶¶ 3-6. The\n\nLiquidators further maintained that the innocent depositors and creditors of Eurofed who were\n\nnot alleged by the government to be affiliated with Lazarenko “have been prejudiced by the fact\n\nthat their funds have been removed from the liquidation together with the funds of [Lazarenko]\n\nand place[d] in the account of the Registrar.” Id. ¶ 10. Accordingly, the Liquidators proposed a\n\npro rata division of the funds being held in the Registrar’s account, under which the funds of\n\nLazarenko and the six companies he allegedly controlled would remain frozen in the Registrar’s\n\naccount, while the funds of the remaining third-party depositors of Eurofed would be released to\n\nthe Liquidators for use in the liquidation. Id. ¶ 7.\n\n               The Liquidators also described the basis for their conclusions about which funds\n\nshould be regarded as Lazarenko-related and remain frozen. As they explained, in view of the\n\nnew restraining order, which imposed restrictions only on Lazarenko’s interests in Eurofed’s\n\nfunds, it had become necessary to “quantify the funds held by the Liquidators for Pavlo\n\nLazarenko and his alleged companies.” Walwyn Decl., Ex. J, at 5. Although Lazarenko himself\n\nhad asserted ownership of the six companies alleged to be under his control, and had made\n\nclaims in the liquidation for over $100 million of Eurofed funds based on that purported\n\nownership, the Liquidators stated that they had “not been able to independently verify ownership\n\nof the companies.” Id. at 6. Taking a conservative approach, the Liquidators recommended\n\ntreating the combined sum of the money in Lazarenko’s personal bank account and the accounts\n\nof the six companies over which he claimed ownership as potentially Lazarenko-related for the\n\npurposes of the freeze order. Since Lazarenko “ha[d] not provided any evidence supporting a\n\nclaim any higher than this” amount, the Liquidators reasoned that the remainder of the funds\n\n\n\n                                                  10\n\fcould safely be regarded as non-Lazarenko-related and used to fund the liquidation claims of\n\nthird-party depositors and creditors. Id. at 6-7.6\n\n               The Liquidators proposed, in other words, that all funds potentially related to\n\nLazarenko would remain in the Registrar’s account, but that the remainder of the funds, which\n\nby all reports came from innocent third parties, be released to the Liquidators for use in funding\n\nthe liquidation.7 After pro rata calculations and reductions, the Liquidators’ proposal called for\n\nthe release of nearly $20 million to the Liquidators, while approximately $65 million in\n\npotentially Lazarenko-related funds would stay in the Registrar’s account. Id. at 10-11.\n\n               In an order dated November 6, 2003, the High Court of Justice granted the\n\nLiquidators’ motion, over the objections of Lazarenko’s counsel. See Walwyn Decl., Ex. K.\n\nThe court directed the Registrar to release the nearly $20 million from its account at the Bank of\n\nNova Scotia to the Liquidators “for the purpose of pro rata payment to third party depositors and\n       6\n                The Liquidators also noted, however, that “Mr. Lazarenko claims ownership [of\nthe six companies] and no other claims to ownership have been made.” Walwyn Decl., Ex. J,\nat 5; see Supplemental Declaration of Charles William Augustine Walwyn, Ex. B (copy of\nLazarenko’s claim in Eurofed liquidation, stating that “he is the beneficial owner” of all six\ncompanies). A clear link between Lazarenko and these companies is evident in certain financial\nagreements between the companies and Eurofed. For instance, a document executed by the\nFairmont Group Ltd., authorizing Eurofed to establish a bank account, provides: “Physical\npresence of Pavlo Lazarenko is required for all instructions or changes to this account.”\nDeclaration of John J. Truex, Ex. G, at 1. The Liquidators report to this Court in their motion\npapers that the true owners of the six companies still “have not been proven or identified.” Euro.\nStmnt. ¶ 2. The plaintiff spills a fair amount of ink arguing that Lazarenko is in fact the owner of\nthese companies and accusing the Liquidators of attempting to “obscure” the scope of his\ndeposits with Eurofed. See Pl.’s Reply Stmnt. at 2-4. While this matter may become important\nlater, nothing in this Opinion depends on whether or not Lazarenko is the owner of the six\ncompanies.\n       7\n               In the Liquidators’ words, “at the time we proposed the 2003 segregation of\nfunds, we conservatively attributed those funds to Lazarenko to avoid any potential argument\nthat these funds could be subject to forfeiture. We certainly were not disclaiming any right to\nuse those funds in the future for liquidation purposes should the forfeiture fail, or if Lazarenko\nwere unable to prove his ownership of those funds. We proposed the division simply to provide\na mechanism to allow partial payment of third party claims and to keep the Eurofed liquidation\napace.” Walwyn Decl. ¶ 14.\n\n                                                 11\n\fcreditors” and for expenses of the liquidation. Id. ¶ 2. “The funds designated to Pavlo\n\nLazarenko and associated companies,” however, totaling approximately $65 million, were to\n\n“remain frozen at the Bank of Nova Scotia, Antigua, in the account of the Registrar of the High\n\nCourt until further order.” Id. ¶ 5. It is unclear whether Eurofed funds allegedly held for the\n\nbenefit of Alexander Milchenko (approximately $1.6 million) were designated as being\n\npotentially Lazarenko-related in the Liquidators’ calculations, and thus whether a corresponding\n\namount of money (reduced pro rata) was released to the Liquidators as part of the approximately\n\n$20 million they received. See Lewczyk Decl., Ex. P, at 10-11.\n\n               Since the division of funds in 2003, the Liquidators report that they have worked\n\nto validate third-party claims and have used the $20 million released to them to make\n\ndistributions to validated depositors and creditors. As of March 2012, they state, they had\n\nvalidated approximately 74 claims submitted by claimants unrelated to Lazarenko and had\n\ndistributed over $14 million to those claimants. Because of the cap on the funds presently\n\navailable to them, however, and because there are 107 additional third-party depositors and\n\ncreditors whose claims have not yet been validated, the Liquidators have paid the validated third-\n\nparty depositors and claimants on a pro rata basis. They report that the balance still owed to\n\nthese 74 validated third-party claimants is $3,180,171. They also report that the total value of\n\nthe “potential claims” of the additional 107 third-party depositors and creditors whose claims\n\nhave not yet been validated is $6,966,692. “Thus . . . the total potential remaining amount due to\n\nthird party depositors and creditors unrelated to Lazarenko is $10,146,823,” while the “total\n\nunrestrained funds in the Liquidators’ possession . . . is $4,347,542, and therefore, there is a\n\ndeficit in the liquidation estate of at least $5,799,280.” Walwyn Decl. ¶¶ 16-17.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\f             C.

As\n\ngrounds for the forfeiture, the complaint alleges criminal conduct by Lazarenko that is similar to\n\nthe charges levied against him in his criminal prosecution. See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 120-155. This\n\nCourt’s jurisdiction rests on 28 U.S.C. § 1355(a), and venue is proper here because all of the\n\ndefendant properties are located in foreign bank accounts, and “[w]henever property subject to\n\nforfeiture under the laws of the United States is located in a foreign country . . . an action or\n\nproceeding for forfeiture may be brought . . . in the United States District Court for the District\n\nof Columbia.” All Assets I, 571 F.

Compl. ¶¶ 140-155. The plaintiff argues that all of the defendant properties are forfeitable\n\nunder either theory.\n\n               Civil forfeiture actions are governed by the procedures set forth in 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 983 and the Supplemental Rules for Admiralty or Maritime Claims and Asset Forfeiture\n\nActions (“Supplemental Rules”), a subset of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. When the\n\ngovernment files a complaint for forfeiture, “any person claiming an interest in the seized\n\nproperty may file a claim asserting such person’s interest in the property in the manner set forth\n\nin the Supplemental Rules[.]” 18 U.S.C. § 983(a)(4)(A); see SUPP. R. G(5)(a).\n\n               Nine individuals and three business entities filed claims contesting the forfeiture\n\nin this action. The individual claims were filed by Pavel Lazarenko, Alexander Lazarenko,\n\nAlexei Ditiatkovsky, and six people who maintained that they were innocent depositors of\n\nEurofed. The institutional claims were filed by Eurofed (acting through its Liquidators), OAO\n\nGazprom, and Universal Trading & Investment Company, Inc. The latter two companies\n\nclaimed an interest in the defendant funds stemming from a kickback scheme allegedly\n\norchestrated by Lazarenko that involved natural gas contracts in the Ukraine. See All Assets III,\n\n772 F. Supp. 2d at 196-205; All Assets IV, 772 F. Supp. 2d at 211-18.\n\n               The Court denied a motion by the Liquidators to transfer venue to the Northern\n\nDistrict of California, where Lazarenko was being prosecuted, see Order, United States v. All\n\nAssets Held at Bank Julius Baer & Co., Ltd. (D.D.C. July 5, 2006), and it later denied a motion\n\nby Pavel and Alexander Lazarenko to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter\n\n\n\n                                                14\n\fjurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. See All Assets I, 571 F. Supp. 2d at 6-17. Upon\n\nmotion by the plaintiff, the Court dismissed the claims of the six individual Eurofed depositors,\n\nbecause those individuals did not file answers to the plaintiff’s complaint as required by\n\nSupplemental Rule G(5)(b), a fatal procedural deficiency under the Supplemental Rules. See All\n\nAssets II, 664 F. Supp. 2d at 101-03. The Court also granted judgment on the pleadings against\n\nOAO Gazprom and Universal Trading & Investment Company, Inc., concluding that neither\n\ncompany had standing to participate in this action because each lacked a cognizable interest in\n\nthe property whose forfeiture they sought to contest. See All Assets III, 772 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n196-205; All Assets IV, 772 F. Supp. 2d at 211-18. Four claimants now remain: Pavel\n\nLazarenko, Alexander Lazarenko, Alexei Ditiatkovsky, and Eurofed.\n\n\n                             D. Background on the Pending Motion\n\n               Supplemental Rule G(6) permits the government to issue special interrogatories to\n\nclaimants early in the forfeiture proceedings, “limited to the claimant’s identity and relationship\n\nto the defendant property.” SUPP. R. G(6)(a). The purpose of such special interrogatories is to\n\nallow the government “to gather information that bears on the claimant’s standing,” id., Advisory\n\nCommittee Notes, 2006 Adoption, which facilitates the prompt elimination of claimants who\n\nhave no right to participate in the proceedings and frees the government from the burden of\n\nresponding to dispositive motions filed by such claimants. “The special interrogatories,”\n\ntherefore, “are limited to questions dealing solely with claimant’s ownership interests in the\n\nproperty.” John K. Rabiej, Supplemental Rule G Governing Pretrial Procedures in Forfeiture in\n\nRem Actions, PRAC. LITIG., May 2008, at 51.8\n\n       8\n               See Rabiej, Supplemental Rule G, at 51 (“The advisory committee . . . provid[ed]\nthe government with an early, but limited, right to scrutinize and challenge the claimant’s\nasserted property interest before the court was required to consider the claimant’s motion to\n\n                                                 15\n\f               The plaintiff propounded special interrogatories to Eurofed’s Liquidators in 2008,\n\nsee Declaration of Jason A. Levine, Ex. 18, and the Liquidators responded. After a stay in\n\ndiscovery that temporarily put things on hold, and after two subsequent requests by the plaintiff\n\nfor more complete responses after discovery resumed, the Liquidators provided their second set\n\nof supplemental responses and objections to the plaintiff’s special interrogatories in April 2010.\n\nSee Levine Decl., Ex. 20.\n\n               Approximately one year after receiving these special interrogatory responses, the\n\nplaintiff filed a “Motion to Strike Liquidators’ Claim or, in the Alternative, to Compel Complete\n\nResponses to Special Interrogatories.” See Dkt. No. 244. Rather than simply moving the Court\n\nto order the Liquidators to provide more comprehensive interrogatory responses, something the\n\nplaintiff had not yet attempted, the motion asked the Court to strike Eurofed’s claim entirely and\n\ndismiss the bank from the proceedings under Supplemental Rule G(8)(c)(i)(A), which permits\n\nstriking the claim of a forfeiture claimant who has failed to comply with Rule G(6).9\n\n               The plaintiff charged that the Liquidators had “repeatedly sought to avoid\n\nanswering the threshold question of the nature and extent of their interest in the property subject\n\nto forfeiture through evasive and non-responsive answers to Special Interrogatories,” Dkt. No.\n\ndismiss the government’s complaint. Under the rule, the government can issue special\ninterrogatories early in the litigation. The scope of these interrogatories is much more limited\nthan the scope of ordinary interrogatories issued under the Civil Rules.”).\n       9\n                Dismissal for failure to comply with Rule G(6) is authorized because a claimant’s\nfailure to respond to special interrogatories can frustrate the government’s efforts to determine\nwhether that claimant has standing to participate in the action. See Rabiej, Supplemental Rule G,\nat 54-55 (“Subdivisions (6) and (8) set up the framework for the government to review a\nclaimant’s bona fides before it must meet its burden of proof to show that the property is subject\nto forfeiture. At the start of many forfeiture actions, the government has little or no information\nabout the claimant’s interest in the seized property. Under subdivision (6), the government may\nfile limited, special interrogatories that bear on the ‘claimant’s identity and relationship to the\ndefendant property’ at any time during discovery. . . . The claimant’s response to the\ninterrogatories provides the government with the necessary information to review and, if\nappropriate, to contest the claimant’s standing.”).\n\n                                                16\n\f244-1 at 1-2, and that dismissal was an appropriate sanction for this noncompliance because the\n\nLiquidators had “provided conflicting evasive assertions of interest in their Claim, Answer and\n\nSpecial Interrogatory responses” and had “failed substantively to respond to Special\n\nInterrogatories despite multiple opportunities.” Id. at 2. As an alternative to dismissal, the\n\nplaintiff requested that the Liquidators be ordered to “fully respond” to certain special\n\ninterrogatories, “so that Plaintiff and the Court are apprised of Liquidators’ purported interest in\n\nthe Defendants In Rem.” Id.\n\n               The Court heard argument on the plaintiff’s motion in January 2012, combined\n\nwith argument on another motion that has since been resolved. During the hearing, the Court\n\nindicated that, in its view, it would be unusual to strike a claim under Supplemental Rule G(8)\n\nbased on inadequate responses to special interrogatories (as opposed to a complete failure to\n\nrespond) where the plaintiff had not even taken the preliminary step of moving to compel\n\nadditional responses. Cf. SUPP. R. G(8), Advisory Committee Note (“As with other pleadings,\n\nthe court should strike a claim or answer only if satisfied that an opportunity should not be\n\nafforded to cure the defects[.] Not every failure to respond to subdivision (6) interrogatories\n\nwarrants an order striking the claim.”). The Court observed that much of the plaintiff’s briefing\n\nwas devoted to attacking the Liquidators’ standing outright, rather than the adequacy of their\n\nspecial interrogatory responses, but that the plaintiff had not moved to dismiss the Liquidators\n\nfor lack of standing, as it was authorized to do by Supplemental Rule G(8)(c)(i)(B), instead\n\nbasing its motion exclusively on the Liquidators’ purported discovery noncompliance. Given\n\nthat the fight over the Liquidators’ interrogatory responses appeared to be serving as a proxy for\n\na more fundamental dispute about their standing to participate in this action, the Court asked the\n\nparties to confer about whether, in lieu of having the Court determine whether additional\n\n\n\n                                                 17\n\finterrogatory responses should be compelled, the parties would prefer to brief the question of the\n\nLiquidators’ standing head-on and without further discovery.\n\n                  Shortly thereafter, the parties advised the Court that they had agreed “to proceed\n\nwithout further supplementation of Liquidators’ responses to the Special Interrogatories and to\n\nrely on the existing record.” Dkt. No. 278 at 1. Under a jointly proposed scheduling order, the\n\nplaintiff agreed to file a motion to strike the Liquidators for lack of standing. Id. That motion,\n\nwhich the plaintiff has brought as a motion for summary judgment, is now before the Court.\n\n\n                                    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n                  In a forfeiture action brought in rem pursuant to a federal statute, at any time\n\nbefore trial the United States “may move to strike a claim or answer . . . because the claimant\n\nlacks standing.” SUPP. R. G(8)(c)(i)(B). Such a challenge to a party’s claim and answer “may be\n\npresented . . . as a motion to determine after a hearing or by summary judgment whether the\n\nclaimant can carry the burden of establishing standing by a preponderance of the evidence.” Id.\n\nG(8)(c)(ii)(B).\n\n                  Summary judgment may be granted if “the movant shows that there is no genuine\n\ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” FED.\n\nR.

DISCUSSION\n\n               As a civil forfeiture claimant, Eurofed must establish standing as to each of the\n\nfive in rem defendants named in the plaintiff’s complaint in which it asserts an interest. See\n\nSUPP. R. G(5)(a)(i)(A) (providing that forfeiture claimants must “identify the specific property\n\nclaimed”). These five properties fall into two fundamentally different categories. On one hand\n\nare the funds that are currently being held at the Bank of Nova Scotia, Antigua, in the name of\n\nthe Registrar of the High Court of Justice, which the plaintiff alleges were formerly maintained\n\non deposit at Eurofed for the benefit of Lazarenko and Alexander Milchenko. See Am. Compl.\n\n¶ 5(d), (e). On the other hand are the funds located in Lithuania and Switzerland that are still on\n\ndeposit at financial institutions where Eurofed formerly maintained correspondent bank\n\naccounts. See Am. Compl. ¶ 5(f), (g), (h). Because these two categories of in rem defendants\n\nare separated by significant differences regarding their legal relationship to Eurofed and its\n\nLiquidators, with consequences for Eurofed’s standing to contest their forfeiture, the Court will\n\naddress the two categories separately.\n\n\n              A. Defendant Funds Held at the Bank of Nova Scotia, Antigua, in the\n                     Account of the Registrar of the High Court of Justice\n\n                      1. Eurofed’s Property Interest in the Antiguan Assets\n\n                        a. Relationship Between a Bank and its Deposits\n\n               The parties agree that Antiguan law defines the nature of any interest that Eurofed\n\nand its Liquidators may have in the defendant funds that are located in Antigua and Barbuda.\n\nSee Mem. at 25-29; Opp. at 17, 20-21. They further agree that where Antiguan statutes and case\n\nlaw do not answer a particular legal question, English common law applies, supplementing\n\nAntiguan law. See Mem. at 19, 27-28; Opp. at 21; Declaration of Nicolette M. Doherty in\n\n\n\n                                                 23\n\fSupport of Liquidators ¶ 13 (stating that “to the extent that local law has not restated or overruled\n\nEnglish law, English statute and case law are deemed to form part of the law of Antigua and\n\nBarbuda”); Declaration of Felicity Rosalind Toube in Support of Plaintiff ¶ 6 (agreeing that\n\n“English common law applies unless Antiguan law has overruled or restated it”).11\n\n               Under longstanding principles of English law, applicable in Antigua, funds\n\ndeposited with a bank become the property of the bank, and the depositor becomes a creditor of\n\nthe bank: “Money, when paid into a bank, ceases altogether to be the money of the principal; it\n\nis then the money of the banker, who is bound to return an equivalent by paying a similar sum to\n\nthat deposited with him when he is asked for it.” Foley v. Hill, [1848] 2 H.L.C. 28, 36, 9 E.R.\n\n1002, 1005; see id., 2 H.L.C. at 36-37 (“The money placed in the custody of a banker is, to all\n\nintents and purposes, the money of the banker, to do with it as he pleases; he is guilty of no\n\nbreach, of trust in employing it; he is not answerable to the principal if he puts it into jeopardy, if\n\nhe engages in a hazardous speculation; he is not bound to keep it or deal with it as the property of\n\nhis principal, but he is of course answerable for the amount, because he has contracted, having\n\nreceived that money, to repay to the principal, when demanded, a sum equivalent to that paid\n\ninto his hands.”). The plaintiff and the Liquidators both acknowledge that, based on this\n\nprecedent, Antiguan banks as a general rule own the deposits made by their customers. See Opp.\n\nat 20-21; Reply at 10.\n\n\n       11\n                 See also Doherty Decl., Ex. F (Common Law Declaration and Application Act of\n1705), § 2 (stating that “the Common Law of England, as far as it stands unaltered by any written\nLaw of these Islands . . . is in force” and that it provides the rules whereby “Rights and\nProperties . . . are and ought to be determined”); Doherty Decl., Ex. G (Eastern Caribbean\nSupreme Court Act), Chap. 143, § 11 (stating that the jurisdiction vested in the High Court of\nJustice “shall be exercised in accordance with this Act and any other law in operation in Antigua\nand Barbuda and rules of court, and where no special provision is therein contained such\njurisdiction shall be exercised as nearly as may be in conformity with the law and practice\nadministered for the time being in the High Court of Justice in England”).\n\n\n                                                  24\n\f               Deposits made with Eurofed by its customers, therefore, became Eurofed’s assets.\n\nBut what, if anything, changed when the bank went into liquidation? The IBC Act, which\n\ngoverns the liquidation of international corporations registered in Antigua, does not explicitly\n\naddress whether a corporation retains title to its assets once it enters liquidation. By repeatedly\n\nreferring to “the property of the corporation,” IBC Act § 306(2), 307(c), 310(1)-(2), and “the\n\nmoneys of the corporation,” id. § 307(d), however, the Act strongly suggests that it does retain\n\ntitle. Indeed, it is difficult to see how an appointed liquidator could, as the IBC Act directs,\n\n“carry on the business of the corporation,” id. § 308(c), or “sell by public auction or private sale\n\nany property of the corporation,” id. § 308(d), if that corporation was not the owner of its assets.\n\n               Applicable English case law, moreover, confirms that a corporation in the process\n\nof being liquidated retains title to its assets. See Ayerst (Inspector of Taxes) v. C. & K.\n\n(Construction) Ltd., [1975] A.C. 167 (H.L.), 177 (stating that “a winding-up order does not of\n\nitself divest the company of the legal title to any of its assets”). Once in liquidation, however,\n\nthe corporation loses the “beneficial ownership” of those assets. Id. at 177-81. In this respect,\n\nthe corporation in liquidation is comparable to a trustee in bankruptcy, who is vested with legal\n\nownership of the bankrupt’s property, but who “cannot enjoy the fruits of it himself or dispose of\n\nit for his own benefit” and instead is “under a duty to deal with it as directed by the statute for\n\nthe benefit of all the creditors who come in to prove a valid claim.” Id. at 178. In other words:\n\n“The resolution or order for winding up divests the company of the beneficial interest in its\n\nassets,” and those assets “become a fund which the company thereafter holds in trust to discharge\n\nits liabilities.” Buchler and another v. Talbot and others, [2004] UKHL 9, ¶ 28 (opinion of Lord\n\nHoffman) (citing Ayerst).12\n\n       12\n                While the House of Lords in Ayerst construed the legal interests of corporations\nand their liquidators under a specific British statute, see Ayerst (Inspector of Taxes) v. C. & K.\n\n                                                  25\n\f               Consistent with these principles of English law, the IBC Act dictates that a\n\ncorporation in liquidation “shall cease to carry on business, except the business that is, in the\n\nopinion of the liquidator, required for an orderly liquidation,” IBC Act § 305(1)(a), the aims of\n\nwhich are to pay off all creditors and to distribute any remaining corporate property among the\n\nshareholders. Id. § 307(i).\n\n               In sum, an Antiguan bank in liquidation retains title to — though not beneficial\n\nownership of — its assets, and those assets include the deposits made by the bank’s former\n\ncustomers. Therefore, the initiation of Eurofed’s liquidation did not divest the bank of its\n\nownership of funds that its customers deposited with the bank, though it did alter the bank’s\n\nrelationship with those funds by circumscribing what the bank could do with them.\n\n\n              b. Relationship Between a Bank’s Liquidators and the Bank’s Assets\n\n               Under the IBC Act, when a corporation is ordered to be liquidated, “the powers of\n\nthe directors and shareholders cease and are vested in the liquidator.” IBC Act § 305(1)(a). A\n\nliquidator is required by the IBC Act to “take into his custody and control the property of the\n\ncorporation,” to discharge any obligations to “creditors and other persons having claims against\n\nthe corporation,” and, ultimately, to “distribute any remaining property of the corporation among\n\nthe shareholders according to their respective rights.” IBC Act § 307(c)-(i). A liquidator also\n\nmay, among other things, “carry on the business of the corporation as required for all orderly\n\nliquidation,” “do all acts and execute any documents in the name and on behalf of the\n\ncorporation,” and “bring, defend or take part in any civil, criminal or administrative action or\n\nproceeding in the name of and on behalf of the corporation.” Id. § 308(1)(b), (c), (e). In other\n\n(Construction) Ltd., A.C. at 176, the court’s interpretation of the terms of that statute drew upon\n“a consistent line of judicial authority,” arising in a variety of contexts and dating back to the\nnineteenth century, establishing “that upon going into liquidation a company ceases to be\n‘beneficial owner’ of its assets.” See id. at 179-81.\n\n                                                 26\n\fwords, upon the commencement of a liquidation proceeding, the company’s corporate structure\n\nceases to exist, and the liquidator — alone empowered to act on the company’s behalf — runs\n\nthe company’s affairs with the limited end of winding them down and appropriately distributing\n\nits assets. “The functions of the liquidator are thus similar to those of a trustee [in] bankruptcy or\n\nan executor in the administration of an estate of a deceased person.” Ayerst (Inspector of Taxes)\n\nv. C. & K. (Construction) Ltd., A.C. at 176-77.\n\n                A key distinction, however, is that under English law (applicable in Antigua) a\n\ntrustee in bankruptcy gains legal title to the bankrupt’s property, and an estate administrator\n\ngains legal title to the deceased’s property, but a liquidator does not gain title to the corporation’s\n\nproperty. That is because, as explained earlier, the corporation in liquidation never loses title to\n\nits assets — merely the “beneficial ownership” of those assets. Ayerst (Inspector of Taxes) v. C.\n\n& K. (Construction) Ltd., A.C. at 177. While a liquidator is often described as being similar to a\n\ntrustee, therefore, “he is not a trustee in the strict sense,” but rather “is more rightly described as\n\nthe agent of the company” who “has cast upon him by statute and otherwise special duties,”\n\nincluding “the duty of applying the company’s assets in paying creditors and distributing the\n\nsurplus among the shareholders.” Knowles v. Scott, [1891] 1 Ch 717, 723; see Janvey v.\n\nWastell, [2010] EWCA Civ 137, ¶ 121 (opinion of Lady Arden) (“As a matter of law, the\n\nliquidators have two capacities. First, they are the agents of SIB. Secondly they are trustees for\n\nthe unsecured creditors. . . . However, their only interest in the assets of SIB . . . is as\n\ntrustees[.]”); cf. Deloitte & Touche (Liquidator) v. Bennett, 81 O.R. 3d 389, 396 (May 18, 2006)\n\n(Can. Ont. Sup. Ct. J.) (“A liquidator is separate and distinct from the company being\n\nliquidated. . . . The liquidator acts as a quasi-trustee for creditors and stands in a different\n\nposition from the corporation.”).\n\n\n\n                                                   27\n\f               Under Antiguan law, in short, liquidators take possession of the corporation’s\n\nproperty and control over its affairs (not ownership of its assets) — but they do so only with the\n\nlimited end of winding down the corporation in accordance with the provisions of the IBC Act,\n\nin the process of which they exercise a quasi-fiduciary duty to the creditors of the corporation.\n\n\n    2. Implications of Eurofed’s Property Interest in the Antiguan Assets under Federal Law\n\n               Having elucidated the legal relationships under Antiguan law among a bank in\n\nliquidation, its assets (which include the deposits of its customers), and its appointed liquidators,\n\nthe Court must next determine whether a bank’s interest in those assets is sufficient under federal\n\nlaw to support its standing, acting through its liquidators, to contest their forfeiture. See United\n\nStates v. 5 S 351 Tuthill Rd., 233 F.3d at 1021; United States v. U.S. Currency, $81,000.00, 189\n\nF.3d at 33. With little difficulty, the Court concludes that Eurofed, acting through its\n\nLiquidators, has a colorable interest in the defendant assets located in Antigua and therefore may\n\nnot be barred from contesting their forfeiture at the summary judgment stage. See United States\n\nv. Real Property Located at 475 Martin Lane, 545 F.3d at 1140; United States v. One Lincoln\n\nNavigator, 328 F.3d at 1013; United States v. $148,840 in U.S. Currency, 521 F.3d at 1275;\n\nUnited States v. $557,933.89, More or Less, in U.S. Funds, 287 F.3d at 79.\n\n               A variety of property interests may serve as the basis for a claimant’s entitlement\n\nto contest a civil forfeiture, including not only ownership but also possessory and other lesser\n\nforms of interest. “The type of interest claimed dictates the type of evidence required to\n\nestablish standing.” United States v. $148,840.00 in U.S. Currency, 521 F.3d at 1274 (citing\n\nUnited States v. $191,910.00 in U.S. Currency, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"663161\"><a href=\"/opinion/663161/united-states-v-19191000-in-us-currency-bruce-r-morgan/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1051</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1058 (9th Cir. 1994)).\n\n               A claimant who asserts an “ownership interest” in the defendant property and who\n\npresents “some evidence of ownership” supporting that assertion has satisfied its burden of\n\n\n                                                 28\n\fdemonstrating standing at the summary judgment stage.

See Euro. Cl. at 4 (asserting that Eurofed “is the legal owner of the accounts and/or funds”\n\nin which the bank has claimed an interest); Lewczyk Decl., Ex.

The only question, then, is whether the\n\nbank has provided enough evidence supporting this assertion of ownership to satisfy the Court of\n\nits standing at this stage in the proceedings.\n\n               In assessing the sufficiency and probity of evidence that purports to demonstrate a\n\ncolorable ownership interest, courts generally look to “indicia of dominion and control such as\n\npossession, title, and financial stake.” United States v. $38,570 U.S. Currency, 950 F.2d at 1113;\n\nsee United States v. $148,840.00 in U.S. Currency, 521 F.3d at 1275; United States v. 1998\n\n\n\n\n                                                   29\n\fBMW “I” Convertible, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">397</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 399 (8th Cir. 2000)). Eurofed has demonstrated all of\n\nthese.\n\n               As explained in the foregoing discussion of Antiguan banking and corporate law,\n\nEurofed gained title to the deposits of its customers. See supra at 23-25. Those deposits are\n\namong the funds now being held in the Registrar’s account that the plaintiff seeks to forfeit. See\n\nAm. Compl. ¶ 5(d) (stating that the funds sought in the Registrar’s account include “assets\n\nderived from deposits” of Lazarenko and his associated companies); id. ¶ 5(e) (making same\n\nassertion regarding deposits of Alexander Milchenko).\n\n               Based on the principle that a bank owns the deposits of its customers, it may be\n\nthat Eurofed itself lost title to the funds when it deposited them in Eurofed’s own correspondent\n\nbank accounts with other financial institutions overseas: at that point, it would appear, the\n\nfinancial institutions with whom Eurofed did business became the owners of the money, and\n\nEurofed was put into the position of the customer, with nothing more than a claim for damages\n\nagainst the institutions if they did not return the money upon request. But once Eurofed’s\n\nreceivers secured the transfer of these funds back to Antigua and placed them in the receivers’\n\ntrust account, as ordered by the Antiguan courts, the funds once again became “the property of\n\nthe corporation.” IBC Act § 307(c); see id. § 307(d), (e) (referencing “the moneys of the\n\ncorporation received”); Doherty Decl., Ex. C, at 1. Eurofed thus has made a sufficient showing\n\nthat it owns the funds being held in the Registrar’s account in Antigua, as it claims, and this is\n\nsufficient to establish the bank’s standing at the summary judgment stage. See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. One Lincoln Navigator, 328 F.3d at 1013 (holding that where state law defines the\n\n“owner” of a vehicle as “a person who holds the legal title,” such legal title “establishes a prima\n\n\n\n\n                                                 30\n\ffacie case of ownership,” which, in the circumstances, conferred standing to contest the vehicle’s\n\nforfeiture).13\n\n                 In addition to demonstrating a colorable ownership interest in these funds,\n\nEurofed also has provided evidence that it has a possessory interest in the funds and a financial\n\nstake in their disposition. The funds were placed into Eurofed’s hands by its customers, were\n\nmaintained by the bank in its own overseas accounts, and were reclaimed from those foreign\n\naccounts by Eurofed’s receivers. That the funds are not presently within Eurofed’s control —\n\nbeing temporarily frozen, for the convoluted reasons explained earlier, in the account of the\n\nRegistrar of the High Court of Justice — hardly diminishes Eurofed’s clear possessory\n\nrelationship to those funds. Moreover, Eurofed undoubtedly has a financial stake in the funds, as\n\nthe bank’s Liquidators are under a legal obligation to take into their control the bank’s property,\n\ndischarge financial obligations to creditors, and distribute any surplus to its shareholders. See\n\nIBC Act § 307(b). If the forfeiture action in this Court fails on the merits, and if no other\n\nattempts to forfeit the funds (whether by the government of Antigua or some other government)\n\nare successful, the funds presumptively will be released to Eurofed for use in the liquidation.\n\n                 Having made a showing of ownership, possession, and financial stake with\n\nrespect to the in rem defendants being held in Antigua, Eurofed has satisfied the “undemanding”\n\nrequirements necessary to survive a summary judgment challenge to its standing, United States\n\nv. 5 S 351 Tuthill Rd., 233 F.3d at 1022, unless the plaintiff can demonstrate any countervailing\n\nlegal or factual considerations that undermine this conclusion.\n        13\n                The plaintiff suggests that Eurofed again lost title to the funds when it transferred\nthem to the account of the High Court Registrar at the Bank of Nova Scotia, in accordance with\nthat court’s orders. But the plaintiff has offered no reason to believe that the general principles\nregarding a banker-customer relationship outlined above are applicable to this type of court-\nordered deposit. As one of the plaintiff’s own experts explains, a bank can serve “in either the\nrole of an ordinary banker (a simple debtor creditor relationship) or also as an agent or trustee.”\nToube Decl. ¶ 14.\n\n                                                 31\n\f                              3. The Plaintiff’s Counter-Arguments\n\n               In an effort to rebut the foregoing determinations, the plaintiff summons a\n\nveritable blizzard of legal and factual counter-arguments. Some of these arguments address\n\nEurofed’s property interest in the Antiguan assets, while others seek to pry Eurofed’s interests\n\nand legal rights apart from those of its Liquidators. When the storm clears, however, it becomes\n\nevident that none of these arguments has merit.\n\n\n                              a. Fiduciary or Custodial Relationship\n\n               The plaintiff alleges that Lazarenko, his associates, and his affiliated companies\n\ndid not have a normal depositor-creditor relationship with Eurofed. According to the plaintiff,\n\nthe Lazarenko-related funds were not held “on deposit” at Eurofed at all. Instead, “Eurofed\n\nBank had a ‘fiduciary and investment’ relationship with Lazarenko regarding his personal\n\naccount, while the accounts of his corporate shells and the personal account of Milchenko were\n\nsubject to custodial agreements.” Pl.’s Stmnt. ¶ 28. Therefore, according to the plaintiff, even if\n\nAntiguan banks generally own the deposits of their customers, Eurofed’s Lazarenko-related\n\nfunds “did not become assets of the bank” because they were merely “held in a custodial or\n\nsafekeeping relationship.” Mem. at 37. And since these funds never belonged to Eurofed at all,\n\nthe bank would suffer no injury from their forfeiture. Id.\n\n               In support of these assertions, the plaintiff furnishes several types of documents.\n\nTwo are stray pages of unknown provenance: The first, as the Liquidators correctly characterize\n\nit, is “an unidentified, shorthand spreadsheet that does not even identify Lazarenko at all,” Euro.\n\nStmnt. ¶ 28, but merely is entitled “Fiduciary Account Balance and Investment Portfolio.”\n\nLewczyk Decl., Ex. S, at 1. Next is a similarly unidentified sheet of paper, apparently a copy of\n\n\n\n                                                  32\n\fa fax transmittal, containing a single paragraph that purports to be signed by Lazarenko and\n\ndirects that his “deposit account” is “to be invested by the direction of” either Lazarenko himself\n\nor his associate Peter Kiritchenko. Id. at 2. The plaintiff also supplies six identical “Custodian\n\nAgreements,” signed by representatives of each of Lazarenko’s affiliated companies, which\n\nauthorize Eurofed to open a “custodian account” for each company. See id., Exs. Q, R, T;\n\nDeclaration of John J. Truex, Exs. A-F. Finally, the plaintiff supplies additional documents\n\nexecuted by Lazarenko’s affiliated companies appointing Eurofed as their banker and setting\n\nforth certain terms of their accounts. See id., Exs. G-L. In addition to these documents, the\n\nplaintiff has submitted a declaration by an English lawyer which opines that, based on her review\n\nof the documents, “it appears to me from these records that the funds held in these accounts were\n\nassets held in a trust or fiduciary relationship for Lazarenko, and therefore did not become assets\n\nof Eurofed.” Toube Decl. ¶ 19.\n\n               The plaintiff’s evidence, while suggestive, is far too limited and ambiguous to\n\nsupport a judgment, without any further factual development, that Eurofed held the money of\n\nLazarenko and his affiliated companies in a custodial or fiduciary capacity, rather than as\n\ntraditional cash deposits. The Liquidators assert that, according to the records available to them,\n\nall of the Eurofed accounts at issue in this proceeding are indeed cash accounts, contrary to Ms.\n\nToube’s assessment. Suppl. Walwyn Decl. ¶ 4. In support, they provide accounting records of\n\nEurofed from 1999 that, they say, show these deposits to have been recorded as assets of the\n\nbank, “rather than off balance-sheet assets that would be consistent with a custodial or trust\n\nrelationship.” Id.; see id., Ex. A. They also note that even Lazarenko himself has never claimed\n\nthat his deposits or those of his companies were held in trust or were anything other than\n\nstandard cash deposits — a claim he presumably had strong incentive to make, as it may have\n\n\n\n                                                33\n\fgiven him priority over regular depositors of Eurofed in the liquidation proceedings. See id.,\n\nEx. B, at 1 (copy of Lazarenko’s claim in Eurofed liquidation, asserting that he and his six\n\ncompanies “are all depositors of Eurofed Bank” (emphasis added)).\n\n               As for the custodian agreements supplied by the plaintiff, those agreements by\n\ntheir terms refer only to “securities” that are “left with the Bank for safekeeping.” See, e.g.,\n\nLewczyk Decl., Ex. Q. The plaintiff suggests that, despite this proviso, these custodian\n\nagreements are “broad enough to cover monies in accounts Lazarenko held in his own name or\n\nthrough his shell companies” and that these agreements therefore might actually govern the cash\n\ndeposits made with Eurofed by Lazarenko’s six companies. Reply at 11. As the plaintiff points\n\nout, the definition of “securities” in these custodian agreements appears curiously broad,\n\nencompassing “all securities and property.” Lewczyk Decl., Ex. Q, at 1. Together with other\n\nterms of the custodian agreements and with some of the other account documentation provided\n\nby the plaintiff, this language may indeed indicate that these “custodian agreements” covered not\n\nonly bona fide securities but also the cash that Eurofed received from its customers, which it\n\n“safeguarded” by depositing in the bank’s overseas correspondent accounts. See Toube Decl.\n\n¶¶ 20-25.14\n\n               At the summary judgment stage, however, “may,” “might,” and “it appears” do\n\nnot cut it for the moving party. The evidence provided by the plaintiff is far from definitive and\n\nis woefully inadequate to support a ruling on this question as a matter of law. For one thing, the\n       14\n                For instance, the custodian agreements govern not only securities that are stored\nin the bank’s vault but also those kept “in the safekeeping of any agent or authorized depositary\n[sic] of the Bank.” Lewczyk Decl., Ex. Q, at 1. Eurofed was required to “register in its own\nname or in the name of a nominee” all of the “securities” covered by the agreements, which,\nagain, included “all securities and property.” Id. Moreover, other agreements between Eurofed\nand the six Lazarenko companies describe Eurofed securities as being “held at foreign\ncorrespondents” and deposited there “in the name of the Bank but held for the account of a\ncustomer” — i.e., similar to the manner in which Eurofed is known to have maintained the cash\ndeposited by its customers. Truex Decl., Ex. G, at 2.\n\n                                                 34\n\fcustodian agreements appear to be standard contracts drawn up by Eurofed without any obvious\n\ntailoring to Lazarenko’s companies; the Liquidators assert that “[o]ther, non-Lazarenko, Eurofed\n\ndepositors signed the same agreements as part of the account-opening process in the event they\n\ndecided to place securities with Eurofed.” Supp. Walwyn Decl. ¶ 7. What’s more, the\n\nagreements are largely devoted to provisions that make sense only with respect to the custody of\n\nactual securities, including terms governing dividends, voting rights, payments and distributions,\n\nmaturity and redemption, and contingencies in the event of a call, subscription, or conversion.\n\nSee Lewczyk Decl., Ex. Q, ¶¶ 5-6. Furthermore, it is known that Eurofed did in fact store bonds\n\nat the same overseas financial institutions where it maintained its correspondent cash accounts.\n\nSee Order at 1, United States v. $1,379,879.09, No. 05-0946 (N.D. Cal. July 8, 2008) (describing\n\nthe government’s seizure, in pursuit of civil forfeiture, of “three accounts held by Bank of\n\nAmerica in the name of Eurofed, containing approximately $1.7 million plus 923,000 Ukrainian\n\nbonds”); United States v.

At this juncture, however, all justifiable inferences must be\n\ndrawn in Eurofed’s favor, Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. at 255, and judgment may\n\nbe granted to the plaintiff only if “the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of\n\nfact to find for” Eurofed. Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. at 380. Rather than weighing the evidence,\n\nCzekalski v. Peters, 475 F.3d at 363, the Court’s only task is to determine whether the plaintiff\n\nhas shown that “there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact” and the plaintiff is entitled to\n\njudgment “as a matter of law.” FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a). Because the question of whether\n\n\n\n                                                  35\n\fEurofed’s arrangements with Lazarenko and his companies rendered those parties’ funds\n\nsomething other than general cash deposits — a question that has both factual and legal\n\ncomponents — could “reasonably be resolved in favor of either party,” Anderson v. Liberty\n\nLobby, Inc., 477 U.S. at 250, summary judgment cannot be granted to the plaintiff on this basis.\n\nSee United States v. $148,840 in U.S. Currency, 521 F.3d at 1277 (holding that district court\n\nerred by dismissing forfeiture claimant for lack of standing, because court was required to view\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to claimant, the non-moving party); United States v. 1998\n\nBMW “I” Convertible, 235 F.3d at 400 (holding that summary judgment was inappropriate\n\nwhere “district court was presented with contradictory evidence bearing directly on the question\n\nof whether appellants had an ownership interest”).15\n\n\n                                      b. Beneficial Ownership\n\n               As explained earlier, Eurofed has retained title to its assets during liquidation, but\n\nthe bank no longer is the “beneficial owner” of those assets. In light of this rule, the plaintiff\n\nargues that “upon issuance of the winding up order, Claimant Eurofed Bank became, at most, a\n       15\n                In a related argument, the plaintiff asserts that because Lazarenko allegedly\n“purchased a controlling interest” in Eurofed and “controlled the investment decisions regarding\nthe funds he held at Eurofed,” the bank “acted as a mere nominee and lacked control of the\nDefendant Assets.” Therefore, as the plaintiff sees it, “the bank did not have an ownership\ninterest in the Defendant Assets sufficient to confer standing.” Mem. at 36. The plaintiff has not\ncome close to demonstrating the factual predicates for this argument, however. Indeed, the\ndistrict judge who presided over Lazarenko’s criminal trial and subsequent ancillary proceedings\nexpressed skepticism about a similar assertion made by the United States during a hearing: that\nEurofed functioned as Lazarenko’s alter ego: “I’m going to tell you, I sat through about a 10 or\n12 week trial. I’m not sure I would be prepared to go as far as you have as to whether Eurofed is\ncompletely Mr. Lazarenko and they are coextensive. I’m not sure that my record reflects that.\nBut that’s for another day[.]” Levine Decl., Ex. 14, at 5. In a subsequent attorneys’ fee dispute,\nthe district judge who took over the case concluded that “[t]he government has not sufficiently\ndemonstrated that Eurofed may be held accountable for Lazarenko’s conviction as his alter ego”\nbecause “the trial record does not support the conclusion that Eurofed and Lazarenko are\ncoextensive.” Order at 6, United States v. $1,379,879.09, supra. The plaintiff certainly has not\npersuaded this Court of the absence of genuine issues of material fact on whether Eurofed acted\nas a mere nominee for Lazarenko.\n\n                                                  36\n\fmere title holder or nominee owner without rights of use or disposal of the property held at the\n\nBank.” Reply at 3. And because courts frequently deny standing to nominal owners who lack\n\nany “true” interest in the property that the government seeks to forfeit, the plaintiff argues,\n\nEurofed should be treated accordingly.\n\n                The plaintiff relies heavily on the truism that, rather than legal ownership per se,\n\n“it is injury that is at the heart of the standing question,” and that the inquiry into a claimant’s\n\nownership interests is often “a surrogate for an inquiry into whether there is injury direct enough\n\nand sufficient enough to sustain standing.” United States v.

A trustee in bankruptcy, who\n\nsimilarly assumes legal but not beneficial ownership of the bankrupt’s estate, likewise “cannot\n\n\n\n                                                   38\n\fenjoy the fruits of the estate himself,” but “is under a duty to deal with it as directed by the\n\nstatute for the benefit of all the creditors who come in to prove a valid claim.” Id. at 178. The\n\nsame is true of an Antiguan company in liquidation, which has no legal right to enjoy the benefit\n\nof its assets, and must instead dispose of them according to the dissolution scheme set forth in\n\nthe liquidation provisions of the IBC Act.\n\n               The plaintiff’s comparison of Eurofed to a nominee, based on the bank’s lack of\n\nbeneficial ownership of the defendant assets, thus is inapt. Although an Antiguan company in\n\nliquidation may no longer do with its assets whatever it wishes, that company is still an ongoing\n\nbusiness concern, duty-bound under Antiguan law and court order to carry on its affairs as\n\nnecessary while consolidating its assets and distributing them to its shareholders after paying off\n\nany debts. See IBC Act § 307. The Court therefore rejects the plaintiff’s suggestion that the\n\nmoment such a company enters liquidation, its assets are ripe for the plucking in a forfeiture\n\naction that the bank has no right to contest.\n\n\n                                  c. Antiguan Restraining Orders\n\n               Even if all of the foregoing is correct, says the plaintiff, the particular funds at\n\nissue here have never actually been part of the Eurofed liquidation estate, and therefore Eurofed\n\ncan claim no interest in them. The reason, according to the plaintiff, is the restraining order\n\nissued in 1999 by the High Court of Justice that froze all Lazarenko-related Eurofed funds. As\n\ndescribed earlier, the court issued this order in October 1999, prohibiting Lazarenko, his\n\nassociates, and his allegedly affiliated companies from removing any of their funds from Antigua\n\nor disposing of or diminishing those funds. Walwyn Decl., Ex. B, at 2. The restraining order\n\nwas already in place when Eurofed’s receivers, in late November 1999, transferred $76 million\n\nback to Antigua from the United States (where the money had been on deposit in correspondent\n\n\n                                                  39\n\fbank accounts) and placed it into their Eurofed trust account. The restraining order was still in\n\neffect when Eurofed was ordered liquidated shortly thereafter, and the funds have remained\n\nsubject to restraint ever since then. Therefore, according to the plaintiff, because the defendant\n\nfunds located in Antigua have at all times remained frozen and unavailable for use by the\n\nLiquidators, the funds “are not part of the liquidation estate of Eurofed Bank.” Mem. at 33.\n\n               This argument has two flaws. First, it gets the facts wrong. The October 1999\n\nrestraining order to which the plaintiff refers was invalidated as unlawful in April 2001. See\n\nsupra at 8-9; Walwyn Decl., Ex. H. Although the High Court of Justice issued a new restraining\n\norder the next month, see Walwyn Decl., Ex. I, that was nearly a year and a half after Eurofed\n\nwas ordered liquidated. Thus, the Antiguan restraining order that is presently in force did not\n\npredate the liquidation or Eurofed’s reacquisition of the funds — just the opposite.\n\n               More significantly, neither of the restraining orders had any effect on the legal\n\nownership of the funds. The restraining orders were merely that: precautionary measures to\n\nprevent parties from dissipating the money or moving it elsewhere, pending the resolution of the\n\nforfeiture action that was then being pursued by the Antiguan government. Orders of this sort\n\nhave no effect on ownership interests: “A restraint order alters no rights; it merely freezes the\n\nproperty to which it is applied.” Janvey v. Wastell, [2010] EWCA Civ 137, ¶ 179 (opinion of\n\nLord Hughes); see id. ¶ 121 (opinion of Lady Arden) (stating that “a restraint order is simply a\n\nfreezing order: it cannot of itself effect changes in the ownership of assets though it may prevent\n\ncertain new interests from arising”). As the High Court of Justice put it, addressing these very\n\nfunds: “Quite simply a restraining Order seeks to conserve the assets until it can be further dealt\n\nwith according to Law.” Lewczyk Decl., Ex. K, ¶ 37.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 40\n\f               Thus, neither the original restraining order of October 1999 nor its successor of\n\nMay 2001 in any way undermines Eurofed’s property interest in the defendant assets located in\n\nAntigua. The fact that those funds are presently frozen does not mean Eurofed or its Liquidators\n\nhave lost their legal interest in the funds. Only a successful forfeiture action can accomplish that.\n\n\n               d. Antiguan Court Orders Enforcing This Court’s Restraining Order\n\n               The plaintiff offers a second reason why the funds at issue here are not part of the\n\nliquidation estate and why Eurofed therefore has no interest in them: according to the plaintiff,\n\nthe Antiguan courts themselves have said so. Specifically, the plaintiff points to a 2010 order by\n\nthe High Court of Justice that, over the Liquidators’ objections, enforced a restraining order\n\nissued by this Court freezing the Eurofed assets located in Antigua, as well as a 2012 judgment\n\nfrom the Court of Appeal that, again over the Liquidators’ objections, affirmed the High Court.\n\nAs the plaintiff reads it, the Court of Appeal decision “held that, as a matter of law, the assets\n\nsubject to this Court’s Restraining Order are not considered part of the liquidation estate.” Mem.\n\nat 31. Because this is a mischaracterization of the Antiguan courts’ decisions, the Court rejects\n\nthe plaintiff’s argument.\n\n               In 2004, shortly after the plaintiff filed the original complaint in this action, this\n\nCourt granted the plaintiff’s ex parte motion for a restraining order covering all of the in rem\n\nassets named as defendants in the complaint. See Restraining Order (May 20, 2004). After the\n\nplaintiff filed an amended complaint in 2005, the Court issued an amended restraining order,\n\nwhich remains in force today. See Restraining Order (July 8, 2005). That order prohibits certain\n\nenumerated parties, including the Liquidators, from taking “any action that would affect the\n\navailability or value of the Defendants In Rem including, but not limited to, withdrawing,\n\ntransferring, assigning, pledging, distributing, encumbering, wasting, secreting or otherwise\n\n\n                                                  41\n\fdisposing of or diminishing the value of, by any means, all or any part of the Defendants In\n\nRem.” Id. at 7. The order further directs that any financial institutions holding any assets subject\n\nto the order must “maintain such assets so as to continue to preserve their value and, for such\n\npurposes, are authorized to invest them for purposes of capital appreciation and accrual of\n\ninterest in the normal course of business and in accordance with generally accepted practices for\n\nthe management of such assets.” Id.\n\n               At the time the Court issued this restraining order, the defendant assets located in\n\nAntigua were already being held in an interest-bearing account in the name of the Registrar of\n\nthe High Court of Antigua and Barbuda, pursuant to earlier orders of the Antiguan courts. See\n\nsupra at 8. The High Court, by this point, already had released nearly $20 million of non-\n\nLazarenko-related Eurofed funds from the Registrar’s account to the Liquidators for the purpose\n\nof pro rata payments to innocent third-party depositors and creditors. See supra at 9-12;\n\nWalwyn Decl., Ex. K. The approximately $65 million designated as potentially Lazarenko-\n\nrelated, however, remained in the Registrar’s account. Id.\n\n               In 2010, Antiguan law enforcement authorities moved the High Court of Justice\n\nfor an order that would enforce this Court’s 2005 Restraining Order within Antigua. The\n\nauthorities, it appears, were acting pursuant to treaty obligations requiring the governments of\n\nAntigua and the United States to provide mutual assistance with respect to certain criminal\n\nmatters, including forfeiture actions. See Lewczyk Decl., Ex. K, ¶¶ 1-5, 34. The Liquidators\n\nopposed the motion on several grounds, see id. ¶¶ 7-19, but in October 2010 the High Court\n\ngranted the motion and ordered this Court’s restraining order registered in the High Court of\n\nJustice and given full effect in Antigua. See id. ¶ 41; id. (Order of Oct. 18, 2010) ¶¶ 1-3.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 42\n\f               The Liquidators appealed this order to the Court of Appeal for Antigua and\n\nBarbuda of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court, focusing their appeal on a single issue: the use\n\nof interest that had accrued on the funds being held in the Registrar’s account. See Lewczyk\n\nDecl., Ex. L, ¶ 21. The problem, as the Liquidators saw it, was that the restraining order\n\nappeared to require that accrued interest be individually credited to the former bank accounts of\n\nLazarenko, Milchenko, and their six affiliated companies, which were the source of the funds in\n\nthe Registrar’s account.16 The Liquidators, however, wanted to use the interest that was accruing\n\nin the Registrar’s account to fund the payment of innocent third-party depositors — rather than\n\ncredit this interest to the Lazarenko-related accounts (which would mean leaving it frozen and\n\nuntouched pending the forfeiture proceedings). Lewczyk Decl., Ex. K, ¶ 21. This Court’s\n\nrestraining order, which prevented them from doing so, conflicted with Antiguan law, according\n\nto the Liquidators: When an Antiguan bank goes into liquidation, they maintained, interest\n\nimmediately stops accruing on individual accounts, and no depositor may recoup any interest\n\naccruing on such an account after the date of liquidation. The restraining order, by contrast,\n\nrequires interest to accrue on frozen liquidated accounts and mandates that the interest be\n\ncredited to those accounts. Id. ¶¶ 13-19.\n\n               The Court of Appeal agreed with the Liquidators that, as a general matter, “any\n\ninterest which may accrue in this case is for the benefit of and use in liquidation proceedings as a\n\nwhole and cannot be credited to a specific creditor or depositor.” Lewczyk Decl., Ex. L, ¶ 23.\n\nBut the court concluded that the importance of forfeiture proceedings trumped the general\n       16\n                    Those bank accounts are individually enumerated in this Court’s restraining order,\nas they are in the amended complaint, and the restraining order directs that financial institutions\nholding the frozen funds “shall continue to credit to the accounts in which the Defendants In\nRem may be found any . . . interest . . . or other credits in the normal course of business and such\n. . . interest . . . shall be subject to this Order.” Restraining Order at 7 (July 8, 2005). The order\nof the High Court of Justice that enforced this Court’s restraining order included identical\nlanguage. Lewczyk Decl., Ex. K (Order of Oct. 18, 2010), ¶ 3(b).\n\n                                                 43\n\fprinciples of liquidation law that otherwise would govern the status of this interest. As the court\n\nexplained, the potentially Lazarenko-related funds are alleged to be the proceeds of crime, and\n\n“not only the principal but the interest thereon as well could be the proceeds of crime.” Id. ¶ 39.\n\nTherefore, because “[t]he interest is as much a part of the alleged proceeds of crime as the\n\nprincipal sum,” the interest “cannot be alienated from the principal to make the interest a part of\n\nfunds available to liquidators,” and “such principal and interests thereon that are proved, at the\n\nenforcement stage, to be the proceeds of criminal activity, are subject to be forfeited.” Id. The\n\ncourt therefore rejected the Liquidators’ appeal and affirmed the High Court’s decision to\n\nenforce this Court’s restraining order: “In this case principal and interest will remain frozen,\n\nunless otherwise ordered, pending the outcome of forfeiture proceedings.” Id. This result, the\n\ncourt explained, was also justified on public policy grounds, because allowing third-party\n\ndepositors and creditors to reap the interest accrued on funds that might be the proceeds of crime\n\nwould entitle them “to share in the benefit of criminally tainted money.” Id. ¶ 40. In sum, the\n\ncourt held that “in effect, the restraint order takes precedence over the winding up order.” Id.\n\n¶ 33.\n\n               The Court of Appeal’s decision clearly addressed only the question of whether\n\ninterest on the funds in the Registrar’s account would remain frozen pending forfeiture\n\nproceedings. Yet the plaintiff insists that the decision is much broader. According to the\n\nplaintiff, the decision held that Eurofed’s Liquidators have no legal interest in any of the still-\n\nfrozen Eurofed funds in the Registrar’s account. The plaintiff emphasizes the court’s statement\n\nthat “the restraint order requires that the principal funds, which may be the proceeds of crime, is\n\n[sic] not to be considered a part of the liquidation corpus of assets. By extension, the interest\n\naccrued on the principal funds cannot be caught by the liquidation.” Lewczyk Decl., Ex. L, ¶ 33.\n\n\n\n                                                  44\n\fIn support of its interpretation that the Court of Appeal thereby repudiated any legal interest of\n\nEurofed in the frozen money, the plaintiff submits an expert declaration from a member of the\n\nAntiguan bar averring that the “ratio decidende” of the court’s decision “was that such funds\n\nfrozen or restrained do not form part of the corpus of assets subject to liquidation,” and therefore\n\n“if such funds are confiscated, the bank in liquidation suffers no injury.” Declaration of Stephen\n\nA. Singh ¶¶ 5-6.\n\n                With all due respect to the plaintiff’s expert, this interpretation represents a\n\nmisreading of the Court of Appeal’s opinion. The court’s discussion is focused on the narrow\n\nissue of whether accrued interest deriving from potentially Lazarenko-related Eurofed accounts\n\ncould be segregated from the principal amounts and immediately used to fund the liquidation\n\nclaims of other depositors. In determining that the money could not be used in this way, the\n\ncourt did not conclude that Eurofed has no legal interest in that interest or the principal funds.\n\nThe fact that the court stated that “the principal funds, which may be the proceeds of crime,” are\n\n“not to be considered a part of the liquidation corpus of assets,” Lewczyk Decl., Ex. L, ¶ 33, does\n\nnot change this. The plaintiff once again is confusing a restraining order — which merely “seeks\n\nto conserve the assets until it can be further dealt with according to Law,” according to the very\n\norder that the Court of Appeal affirmed, see Lewczyk Decl., Ex. K, ¶ 37 — with the ultimate\n\ndetermination of forfeitability. The latter has not occurred yet, which is why the Court of Appeal\n\nstated that “principal and interest will remain frozen, unless otherwise ordered, pending the\n\noutcome of forfeiture proceedings.” Lewczyk Decl., Ex. L, ¶ 39 (emphasis added); see id.,\n\nEx. K, ¶ 37 (“At the forfeiture proceedings all relevant issues can be ventilated including the\n\nissue of the legal status of the interest referred to by the respondent in this application.”).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  45\n\f               One only has to think for a moment about the plaintiff’s position to appreciate its\n\ncircularity: First, the plaintiff obtains a restraining order from this Court freezing the defendant\n\nassets, pending a determination of their forfeitability. Next, an Antiguan court enforces that\n\norder domestically, ruling that the assets cannot be used for the liquidation pending the forfeiture\n\nproceedings. Finally, the plaintiff uses the order of the Antiguan court to obtain an order from\n\nthis Court that the Liquidators have no right to challenge the forfeiture at all — because an\n\nAntiguan court has prevented them from using the assets in the liquidation. One can readily\n\nappreciate why this scenario, in which a simple freeze order is transformed into a weapon\n\ndisposing of all parties who claim ownership of the frozen assets, is appealing to the plaintiff.\n\nSuch alchemy, however, contradicts the decisions of the Antiguan courts, which acknowledge\n\nthat the purpose of this Court’s restraining order, and of their enforcement of that order, is\n\nmerely to preserve the defendant assets pending the determination of whether they are subject to\n\nforfeiture. See Lewczyk Decl., Ex. K, ¶ 37; id., Ex. L, ¶ 39.\n\n\n                                        e. Surplus of Funds\n\n               The plaintiff also argues that Eurofed would suffer no injury from the forfeiture of\n\nthe defendant funds because the Liquidators already have more than enough money available to\n\nfund the liquidation to its completion. See Mem. at 39-40.\n\n               As noted, the Liquidators report that they have validated approximately 74 claims\n\nsubmitted by Eurofed depositors and creditors unrelated to Lazarenko and have distributed over\n\n$14 million to these claimants. Because the funds presently available to the Liquidators are\n\nlimited, however, and because an additional 107 claims have not yet been validated, the\n\nLiquidators have paid the validated claimants on a pro rata basis. They report that the balance\n\nstill owed to these 74 validated claimants is $3,180,171. They also report that the “potential\n\n\n                                                 46\n\fclaims” of the unvalidated claimants add up to $6,966,692. “Thus . . . the total potential\n\nremaining amount due to third party depositors and creditors unrelated to Lazarenko is\n\n$10,146,823,” while the “total unrestrained funds in the Liquidators’ possession . . . is\n\n$4,347,542, and therefore, there is a deficit in the liquidation estate of at least $5,799,280.”\n\nWalwyn Decl. ¶¶ 16-17.\n\n               The Liquidators acknowledge, in other words, that they have enough money on\n\nhand to compensate in full all 74 validated claimants, who so far have received only partial\n\npayment on their claims. Paying the balance on those validated claims, however, would leave\n\nonly around $1 million remaining for the payment of any successful claims among the 107\n\nclaims that are still unvalidated, the total value of which could approach $7 million. And\n\naccording to the Liquidators, they “may not pay verified claims in full as long as there are\n\noutstanding potential claims that exceed the assets available for distribution.” Walwyn Decl.\n\n¶ 17; see IBC Act § 289(3) (“When the amount available to pay the claims of any class of\n\nclaimant . . . is not sufficient to provide payment in full to claimants in that class, the amount\n\navailable shall be distributed on a pro rata basis among the claimants in that class.”).\n\n               The plaintiff responds that “after twelve and a half years of liquidation\n\nproceedings, it strains credulity to believe that the Liquidators — long standing partners of\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers — still have not completed the validation process.” Mem. at 40. The\n\nCourt, however, does not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence on a motion for\n\nsummary judgment. Czekalski v. Peters, 475 F.3d at 363. For the plaintiff to obtain summary\n\njudgment against Eurofed on the basis of this argument, it must demonstrate the absence of any\n\ngenuine issue of material fact about the lack of any remaining bona fide Eurofed liquidation\n\nclaims that have not yet been validated. That showing is not made by expressing incredulity.\n\n\n\n                                                  47\n\fThis line of attack, therefore, does not support the plaintiff’s request for judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw on the existing record.17\n\n                The plaintiff also suggests that the Court should simply discount the significance\n\nof Eurofed’s unvalidated liquidation claims. As noted, the Liquidators’ estimates show that even\n\nif all potential claims were found to be valid and require payment from the liquidation estate, the\n\ndeficit facing the estate would be less than $7 million. The plaintiff argues that the\n\n“hypothetical, future validation” of claims that will not exceed this figure is “an insufficient basis\n\nfor the Court to find that the Claimant Liquidators have constitutional standing to contest the\n\nforfeiture of all of the assets held for the benefit of Lazarenko and Milchenko and involved in\n\ntheir crimes.” Mem. at 40. That is particularly so, according to the plaintiff, because the\n\nunvalidated claimants in question “have so far been unable or unwilling to do what is necessary\n\nto finalize their claims in the liquidation.” Id.\n\n                As far as the Court can tell, the plaintiff seems to be suggesting that the standing\n\ninquiry incorporate some amorphous type of proportionality analysis, under which claimants\n\nwith a relatively small stake in a forfeiture (“small” here meaning potentially seven million\n\n\n\n        17\n                Perhaps lending some justification to the plaintiff’s skepticism, in June 2010 the\nLiquidators reported to the High Court of Justice that, among the unvalidated claimants (who\nnumbered 111 at the time of the report), 70 claimants had not responded to any of the\nLiquidators’ attempts to contact them, 17 had submitted only a portion of the information\nrequired to validate their claims, and the remaining 24 all had their Eurofed deposits frozen by\nthe Antiguan money-laundering authorities. Lewczyk Decl., Ex. V, at 2. With respect to the 70\nclaimants who had not responded at all, the Liquidators proposed to the High Court that, after a\nfinal attempt to reach these claimants, the Liquidators would “allocate these funds on a pro rata\nbasis to the other claimants.” Id. In reporting to this Court about the 107 claimants allegedly\nstill awaiting validation, nothing in the Liquidators’ filings or statement of facts mentions these\n70 wayward claimants. The Court also notes that between the Liquidators’ completion of their\nmost recent special interrogatory responses and the filing of their memorandum opposing\nsummary judgment — two years later — the Liquidators, by their own reckoning, validated at\nmost a single claim. See id., Ex. P, at 26 (reporting that “approximately 73” claims were\nvalidated); Walwyn Decl. ¶ 16 (reporting that “approximately 74” claims were validated).\n\n                                                    48\n\fdollars) be denied the right to contest the outcome of the forfeiture on that basis. No analysis or\n\nauthority of any kind is offered in support of this proposition, however.\n\n               More fundamentally, the plaintiff’s argument rests on the false premise that\n\nEurofed’s legal interest in the defendant assets is limited to whatever amount of money is\n\nnecessary to compensate the non-Lazarenko-related depositors and creditors who have made\n\nclaims in the liquidation. As explained above, however, Eurofed has a colorable ownership\n\ninterest in all of the funds being held in Antigua, along with a possessory interest in those funds\n\nand a financial stake in their disposition. See supra at 23-31. Although Eurofed, thus far, has\n\nbeen permitted by the courts only to pay off the claims of depositors and creditors who\n\nundeniably have no relationship with Lazarenko, no court has yet determined that the $65\n\nmillion in the Registrar’s account is traceable to or proceeds of Lazarenko’s crimes. Until that\n\nhappens, Eurofed has an interest in the fate of that money.\n\n\n                        f. Distinction Between Eurofed and its Liquidators\n\n               Even if Eurofed has standing to contest the forfeiture of the defendant assets, the\n\nplaintiff argues, this does not necessarily mean that its Liquidators may participate in these\n\nproceedings on the bank’s behalf. Maintaining that “liquidators are not coextensive with the\n\ncompany that they are liquidating,” and that “the interests of a liquidator and a company in\n\nliquidation necessarily are different,” the plaintiff asserts that “Claimant Liquidators and\n\nClaimant Eurofed Bank are, simply put, two distinct entities each advancing its own distinct\n\npurported interests.” Moreover, by “conflating these two interests,” the Liquidators have\n\n“confuse[d] the litigation and hamper[ed] . . . the Court’s ability to adjudicate[] the legal basis\n\nfor their participation in this action.” Mem. at 19, 21-22.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  49\n\f                Part of the plaintiff’s argument here is that the Liquidators’ court filings and\n\ndiscovery responses have obscured whether they are acting exclusively as Eurofed’s agents,\n\npressing the bank’s interests on the bank’s behalf, or whether they are asserting their own,\n\ndistinct legal interests in the defendant assets. See Mem. at 19-25. This contention is essentially\n\na variant on the plaintiff’s procedural argument for the dismissal of Eurofed’s claim, discussed\n\nbelow. See infra at 56-61.\n\n                The other aspect of the plaintiff’s argument presents a substantive question:\n\nwhether the liquidator of an Antiguan corporation is entitled to appear on behalf of the\n\ncorporation to contest the forfeiture of its assets, or whether the liquidator’s distinct legal identity\n\nmeans that he or she can only pursue whatever separate right he or she has, as a liquidator, to the\n\ncorporation’s assets. Basically, the plaintiff is challenging the very notion that Eurofed may\n\ncontest this forfeiture “by and through” its Liquidators. Euro. Cl. at 3. To address the questions\n\nraised by the plaintiff, one must engage in a two-step inquiry because, as noted above, “[s]tate\n\nlaw defines and classifies property interests for purposes of the forfeiture statutes, while federal\n\nlaw determines the effect of the property interest on the claimant’s standing.” United States v. 5\n\nS 351 Tuthill Rd., 233 F.3d at 1021.\n\n                With respect to Antiguan property interests, the matter is fairly straightforward.\n\nAs explained earlier, title to Eurofed’s assets remains with the bank during liquidation and does\n\nnot transfer to its liquidators. See supra at 27. Nevertheless, the IBC Act commands a liquidator\n\nto “take into his custody and control the property of the corporation” and empowers him or her to\n\n“bring, defend or take part in any civil, criminal or administrative action or proceeding in the\n\nname of and on behalf of the corporation.” IBC Act §§ 307(c), (d), 308(1)(b). Thus, Antiguan\n\nlaw expressly provides that Eurofed’s Liquidators will take control of the bank’s assets and\n\n\n\n                                                  50\n\frepresent Eurofed’s interests in legal proceedings. Even the plaintiff acknowledges that a\n\nliquidator “has the ability to act on the entity’s behalf.” Toube Decl. ¶ 27. The mere fact that a\n\nliquidator is “an agent” of the corporation, and thus a separate legal personage with his own\n\ndistinct identity, as emphasized by the plaintiff, see Mem. at 19 (citing Knowles v. Scott, [1891]\n\n1 Ch 717, 723), does not diminish the liquidator’s entitlement to act on behalf of the company\n\nand assert its interests in court. See Ayerst (Inspector of Taxes) v. C. & K. (Construction) Ltd.,\n\nA.C. at 180 (explaining that during liquidation “the actual custody, control, realisation and\n\ndistribution of the proceeds of the property which is subject to the statutory scheme are taken out\n\nof the hands of the legal owner of the property, the company, and vested in a third party, the\n\nliquidator, over whom the company has no control”).\n\n                Turning to the second part of the inquiry — the effect of these state-defined\n\nproperty interests on the federal standing analysis — the Court disagrees that the Liquidators’\n\nseparate legal identity from Eurofed deprives them of the right to challenge the forfeiture of\n\nEurofed’s assets on the bank’s behalf. Mr. Walwyn and Mr. Wilkinson have not sought to\n\nappear in their personal capacities in this action, but only in their official roles as liquidators of\n\nEurofed. “Acts performed by the same person in two different capacities ‘are generally treated\n\nas the transactions of two different legal personages.’” Bender v.

Cir. 1995) (assessing standing of bank liquidators to contest forfeiture “in their capacities\n\nas branch liquidators”).\n\n               The plaintiff cites no cases holding that a liquidator — or any similarly appointed\n\nrepresentative such as a receiver, trustee, or estate administrator — lacks standing to contest a\n\nforfeiture because of the legal distinction between the appointed representative and the entity or\n\nestate he or she represents. Indeed, where our own court of appeals has denied liquidators\n\nstanding to challenge a forfeiture, the court did so precisely because the interests of the\n\nliquidators were indistinguishable from those of the banks on whose behalf they acted. While\n\nthese banks had already been found to lack standing, their liquidators “assert[ed] that, as legally\n\nauthorized liquidators, they ha[d] interests separate from the institutions they represent[d],” an\n\nassertion that the court rejected: “A bank liquidator, however, stands in the shoes of the bank it\n\nrepresents and enjoys precisely the same rights and interests.” United States v. BCCI Holdings\n\n(Luxembourg), S.A., 48 F.3d at 554.19\n\n\n       18\n                Although United States v. $7,599,358.09 involved a liquidator who held title to\nthe assets of his company under state law, nothing marks this factor as critical to the court’s\nanalysis. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3086107</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5.\n       19\n                As authority for the proposition that a bank liquidator “stands in the shoes of the\nbank it represents and enjoys precisely the same rights and interests,” the court of appeals in\nBCCI cited decisions that involved the rights of liquidators and receivers appointed pursuant to\nfederal statutes or under the laws of individual states. See United States v. BCCI Holdings\n(Luxembourg), S.A., 48 F.3d at 554. The property interests in this case, by contrast, are\ngoverned by Antiguan law, under which liquidators do not become the owners of their\n\n                                                  52\n\f               The Court therefore concludes that Eurofed’s Liquidators have every right to\n\nappear in their official capacity on behalf of the bank and challenge the forfeiture, presenting all\n\nof the claims and defenses that Eurofed may possess. Or, to put it another way, Eurofed may\n\nappear in this action “by and through” its Liquidators.20\n\n               It bears emphasis, however, that the Liquidators are entitled to participate here\n\nonly on behalf of Eurofed. Apparently unable to help themselves from adding one more\n\nargument to bolster their standing, even if it contradicts their otherwise consistent insistence that\n\nthey exclusively represent Eurofed’s interests, the Liquidators briefly argue that because they\n\n“owe the depositors and creditors of Eurofed certain statutory fiduciary duties,” they “are\n\nexposed to personal liability under Antiguan law if they fail to fulfill those duties.” Opp. at 34.\n\nBut the Court reiterates that any personal interests of Mr. Walwyn or Mr. Wilkinson, and any\n\ninjuries that they might suffer from the outcome of this action in their personal capacities, are\n\nirrelevant. Likewise, Eurofed may not vicariously represent the legal interests of its individual\n\ndepositors and creditors in this action, and its standing rests solely on its own institutional\n\ninterests in complying with the IBC Act and completing the liquidation. As the Liquidators\n\nthemselves make clear, they “are not asserting the rights of others,” but have “filed a claim on\n\nbehalf of Eurofed so that they would be able to fulfill their continuing statutory and fiduciary\n\n\n\ncorporation’s assets. The Court therefore emphasizes that it does not accept two arguments\nadvanced here by the Liquidators: that title to Eurofed’s assets passed to the Liquidators upon\ntheir appointment, see Opp. at 21, or that the Liquidators enjoy “all of the same rights and\ninterests” as Eurofed. Id. at 22 (emphasis added). The relevant point is that the distinction\nbetween Eurofed and its Liquidators is immaterial for purposes of standing to contest the\nforfeiture of Eurofed’s assets.\n       20\n                 The plaintiff’s contention that counsel for the Liquidators, in a status conference\nheld before Magistrate Judge Robinson in June 2011, admitted that the Liquidators “have no\ninterest in the Defendants In Rem,” Mem. at 29, is a mischaracterization of counsel’s comments.\nSee Levine Decl., Ex. 22, at 12-15; id., Ex. 23, at 17-18, 40-42; Opp. at 34-35.\n\n                                                  53\n\fduties.” Opp. at 44-45. The only claimant here is Eurofed, acting by and through its\n\nLiquidators. See Euro. Cl. at 3.\n\n\n              B. Defendant Funds Held on Deposit in Lithuania and Switzerland in\n                             Eurofed’s Correspondent Accounts\n\n                The foregoing discussion has addressed only two of the five in rem defendants in\n\nwhich Eurofed claims an interest: the assets located in Antigua and held at the Bank of Nova\n\nScotia in the account of the Registrar of the High Court of Justice. The remaining three in rem\n\ndefendants are all located in bank accounts that Eurofed formerly maintained in its own name\n\nwith financial institutions in Lithuania and Switzerland. Specifically, these three defendants\n\ncomprise funds held on Eurofed’s behalf at Vilniaus Bankas (Vilniaus, Lithuania), last valued at\n\napproximately $29.3 million; Credit Suisse (Geneva, Switzerland), last valued at approximately\n\n$4.8 million; and Banque SCS Alliance S.A. (Geneva, Switzerland), last valued at approximately\n\n$484,000. See Am. Compl. ¶ 5(f)-(h); Euro. Cl. at 3-4.\n\n                As a result of freeze orders issued in Lithuania and Switzerland, the Liquidators\n\nhave never been able to transfer these funds out of the countries and financial institutions where\n\nthey are located back to Antigua and into their own control. See Lewczyk Decl., Ex. I (first\n\nreport of the receivers), at 2-3; id. (supplemental affidavit), at 1; id., Ex. V, at 2; Declaration of\n\nMarlee Engel ¶ 5; Supplemental Declaration of Marlee Engel ¶ 6.\n\n                Although Eurofed bears the burden of establishing its standing to contest the\n\nforfeiture of these assets, it does not even attempt to show that the laws of Lithuania or\n\nSwitzerland give it a property interest in the funds located in those countries. As discussed\n\nearlier, Antiguan law provides that a customer’s financial deposits with a bank generally become\n\nassets of the bank; consequently, the customer is no longer the owner of the money. See supra\n\n\n\n                                                   54\n\fat 24. This principle endowed Eurofed with title to the funds that its customers deposited. But\n\nonce Eurofed itself, now acting as a customer, deposited some of these funds with financial\n\ninstitutions in Lithuania and Switzerland, application of the same rule would suggest that\n\nEurofed in turn lost title to those funds — unless, perhaps, the laws of Lithuania and Switzerland\n\nprovide differently for the property rights of bank depositors.\n\n               Eurofed has not argued that this is the case or presented any evidence supporting\n\nsuch an argument. The Court therefore has no basis from which to infer that Eurofed, as a\n\ndepositor of Vilniaus Bankas, Credit Suisse, and Banque SCS Alliance, is anything other than a\n\ngeneral, unsecured creditor of those banks. And the federal courts “have consistently held that\n\nunsecured creditors do not have standing to challenge the civil forfeiture of their debtors’\n\nproperty.” All Assets IV, 772 F. Supp. at 212 (quoting United States v. One-Sixth Share, 326\n\nF.3d at 41); see United States v. BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg), S.A., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"688686\"><a href=\"/opinion/688686/united-states-v-bcci-holdings-luxembourg-sa-bank-of-credit-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1185</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1191 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1995) (holding that “a general creditor can never have an interest in specific forfeited\n\nproperty”).\n\n               Nor has Eurofed shown any other way that it could have an ownership interest in\n\nthese particular in rem defendants. Since the date that Eurofed deposited these funds overseas,\n\nneither the bank nor its Liquidators have ever regained possession of the funds or exerted any\n\ndominion or control over them. That puts these defendant assets in a fundamentally different\n\nposition from those located in Antigua: the Liquidators secured the return of those assets from\n\nthe United States and held them for months in their own trust account before turning them over\n\nto the Registrar of the High Court of Justice. Not so for the assets in Lithuania and Switzerland.\n\nMoreover, Eurofed has not demonstrated that it has any financial stake in these particular funds.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 55\n\fRather, it appears that the bank, at most, has a damages claim against the three financial\n\ninstitutions holding those funds if they unlawfully refuse to return them.\n\n               Thus, Eurofed has not established a colorable ownership interest in the defendant\n\nassets named in paragraph 5(f), 5(g), and 5(h) of the amended complaint, and thus it has not\n\ncarried its burden of demonstrating its standing to contest their forfeiture. As a practical matter,\n\nthis determination may not have much effect on Eurofed’s pursuit of its interests here, because\n\nthe Lithuania and Switzerland assets are allegedly derived from the same funds as those in\n\nAntigua, the forfeitability of which Eurofed has the right to contest.\n\n\n                                     C. Procedural Objections\n\n               Apart from the question of whether Eurofed and its Liquidators have a sufficient\n\ninterest in the defendant assets to contest their forfeiture, the plaintiff argues that neither Eurofed\n\nnor the Liquidators have complied with the procedural requirements governing asset forfeiture\n\nclaims and that Eurofed’s claim should be dismissed on this basis. See Mem. at 18-25. This\n\nargument represents a procedural counterpoint to the plaintiff’s substantive effort to separate\n\nEurofed from its Liquidators on the basis of their ostensibly distinct legal interests. The Court\n\nfinds this variant equally unpersuasive.\n\n               “To contest the forfeiture of property that has been named as a defendant in a civil\n\nforfeiture action, a claimant must proceed ‘in the manner set forth in the Supplemental Rules for\n\nCertain Admiralty and Maritime Claims [and Asset Forfeiture Actions.]’” All Assets II, 664 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 101 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 983(a)(4)(A)). A would-be claimant “must file with the\n\ncourt presiding over the forfeiture action a claim that (1) ‘identif[ies] the specific property\n\nclaimed,’ (2) ‘identif[ies] the claimant and state[s] the claimant’s interest in the property,’ and\n\n(3) is ‘signed by the claimant under penalty of perjury.’” Id. (quoting SUPP. R.\n\n\n                                                  56\n\fG(5)(a)(i)(A)-(C)). “She or he must also file either a motion to dismiss the government’s\n\ncomplaint or an answer to that complaint[.]” Id. (citing SUPP. R. G(5)(b)).\n\n                Eurofed intervened in these proceedings by filing a timely claim asserting an\n\ninterest in the Eurofed-related defendant assets. See Euro. Cl. Eurofed’s verified statement\n\nidentifies the claimant as “Eurofed Bank Limited (in liquidation), by and through its Receivers,\n\nRobert J. Wilkinson and Charles Walwyn (collectively ‘Eurofed’).” Id. at 3 (emphasis added).\n\nLeaving no doubt of the claimant’s identity, the document is titled “Eurofed Bank Limited’s (In\n\nLiquidation) Rule C(6)(A) Verified Statement,” see id. at 1, and the counsel who signed it are\n\nidentified as “Attorneys for Claimant Eurofed Bank Limited, In Liquidation.” Id. at 5.\n\n                A timely answer to the complaint was later filed by the same counsel, but this\n\nanswer consistently identifies the “claimants” as the “Liquidators of European Federal Credit\n\nBank (In Liquidation),” Euro. Ans. at 1; see id. at 2 (same); id. at 27 (same), rather than Eurofed\n\nitself, acting “by and through” its liquidators.\n\n                As a result of the discrepancy between these two filings, the plaintiff argues that\n\n“two claimants are appearing in this action with respect to Eurofed Bank Limited” — the bank\n\nitself and the Liquidators. Mem. at 18. And because, as the plaintiff sees it, the Liquidators did\n\nnot file a claim, while Eurofed did not file an answer, both claimants should be dismissed. See\n\nid. at 18-22.\n\n                As the Court has explained, the Liquidators have been empowered by Antiguan\n\nstatute and court order to “bring, defend or take part in any civil, criminal or administrative\n\naction or proceeding in the name of and on behalf of” Eurofed. IBC Act § 308(1)(b). Indeed,\n\nsince the powers of Eurofed’s directors and shareholders have ceased and “are vested in the\n\nliquidator,” id. § 305(1)(a), the only way that Eurofed can proceed through this or any other legal\n\n\n\n                                                   57\n\faction is through its Liquidators. Reflecting this state of affairs, Eurofed’s verified claim\n\nindicates that the bank is appearing “by and through” its liquidators. Euro. Cl. at 2. But the\n\nstatement clearly identifies “Eurofed” as the claimant, asserting that the bank is “the legal owner\n\nof the accounts and/or funds” in question, and that “[b]y virtue of [this] legal ownership . . .\n\nEurofed declares its right to defend this action.” Id. at 4.\n\n               Subsequent filings, it is true, have freely interchanged “Eurofed” with “the\n\nLiquidators of Eurofed” in identifying the claimant, beginning with the answer. But these filings\n\nmake clear that the Liquidators are acting in their roles as representatives of Eurofed, and the\n\nfilings reflect an implicit understanding that there is no difference between the bank and its\n\nliquidators as far as their participation in this action is concerned. See, e.g., Dkt. No. 223 at 1\n\n(identifying the claimant as “‘the Liquidators’ or ‘Eurofed’”); Lewczyk Decl., Ex. P, at 1\n\n(identifying the claimant as “‘the Liquidators’ or ‘the Bank’”). That the plaintiff itself has never\n\nbeen confused by this inconsistency, or believed that Eurofed and its Liquidators were separate\n\nclaimants, is clear from the special interrogatories that the plaintiff served on the Liquidators,\n\nwhich provide: “The term ‘you’ or ‘your’ means both Eurofed and the Liquidators of Eurofed.”\n\nLewczyk Decl., Ex. U, at 2.\n\n               Given all this, it cannot seriously be argued that “Eurofed Bank has not filed an\n\nAnswer in this action,” Mem. at 7, or that Eurofed’s claim should be stricken because the\n\nLiquidators chose to identify themselves as the “claimants” in their answer to the complaint. The\n\npurpose of an answer, in civil forfeiture actions, as elsewhere, “is to give reasonable notice of the\n\nallegations in the complaint sought to be placed in issue.” United States v. 1866.75 Board Feet\n\nand 11 Doors and Casings, No. 07-1100, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">839792</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (E.D.

The answer filed by the Liquidators does just that, admitting some of the\n\ncomplaint’s allegations, denying others, and setting forth a host of affirmative defenses. See\n\nEuro. Ans. Thus, the inconsistency in identification of the “claimant” between the claim and the\n\nanswer has by no means left “the Government and the court guessing as to which allegations in\n\nthe complaint are admitted and which will require proof at trial.” Reply at 13.21\n\n               The plaintiff’s real gripe is with the Liquidators’ responses to the plaintiff’s\n\nspecial interrogatories. Such interrogatories play an important role in civil forfeiture actions,\n\nbecause they allow the government “to gather information that bears on the claimant’s standing,”\n\nSUPP. R. G(6)(a), Advisory Committee Notes, 2006 Adoption, and promptly move to dismiss\n\nfrom the proceedings claimants who lack such standing. See supra at 15. The plaintiff argues\n\nthat the Liquidators have responded to these special interrogatories only by addressing their own\n\nrelationship, as appointed liquidators, to the assets claimed by Eurofed, rather than responding on\n\nbehalf of Eurofed itself and explaining the nature of the bank’s legal interest in those assets. See\n\nMem. at 22-23.\n\n               The plaintiff has a point. For instance, in response to a question asking for “the\n\ndate on which you acquired . . . an interest” in certain assets, the Liquidators’ response cites only\n\nthe facts surrounding the commencement of the liquidation and their own appointment as\n\nliquidators, saying nothing about when Eurofed’s interest in the property arose. See Lewczyk\n\nDecl., Ex. P, at 4-6. In response to an inquiry about “the ownership or other nature of your\n\n       21\n                 The plaintiff spends considerable time belaboring portions of the Liquidators’\nanswer that disclaim knowledge about certain assertions made in the complaint — apparently to\nsuggest that the answer does not actually speak for Eurofed (because the bank presumably would\nhave knowledge of the matters in question). As the Liquidators have explained, however, much\nof the plaintiff’s discussion to this effect is misleading: the denials in question do not simply\ndeny awareness of undisputed facts that Eurofed itself must surely know, but rather dispute\nspecific characterizations about the defendant assets with which the Liquidators disagree.\nIdentifying such points of disagreement is one function of an answer.\n\n                                                 59\n\finterest and all facts and legal bases that support your claim,” the Liquidators’ brief response is\n\nconfined to the nature of their own relationship to the property, saying not a whit about the\n\nnature of Eurofed’s interest in the property or what facts or legal bases support that alleged\n\ninterest. Id. This pattern pervades the Liquidators’ interrogatory responses.\n\n               The solution to this deficiency, however, would have been to move to compel\n\nmore complete responses from Eurofed. Instead, as recounted earlier, the plaintiff took the more\n\naggressive step of moving to dismiss Eurofed’s claim entirely under Supplemental\n\nRule G(8)(c)(i)(A) — which permits dismissal for certain procedural noncompliance — based\n\nupon the inadequacy of these discovery responses. See supra at 16-17. Only in the alternative\n\ndid the plaintiff request that the Liquidators be compelled to supplement their responses. See\n\nDkt. No. 244. In arguing for dismissal under Supplemental Rule G(8)(c)(i)(A), however, the\n\nplaintiff mixed its discussion with direct attacks on the Liquidators’ standing — a challenge\n\nproperly brought through a motion to dismiss for lack of standing under Supplemental\n\nRule G(8)(c)(i)(B). After receiving a clear indication from the Court that it was not likely to\n\ndismiss Eurofed’s claim based on inadequate interrogatory responses, the plaintiff agreed to brief\n\nthe question of Eurofed’s standing on the existing record without further discovery, rather than\n\nhave the Court address its objections to the interrogatory responses. See supra at 17-18. But\n\nnow, having filed a motion challenging Eurofed’s standing as a substantive matter, the plaintiff is\n\nattempting to revive its procedural objections. It simply couches its argument in new terms —\n\nby suggesting that it is not objecting to the inadequacy of the interrogatory responses, as before,\n\nbut to “Eurofed Bank’s failure to respond at all” to the interrogatories. Mem. at 3.\n\n               Simply put, this will not fly. Whatever deficiency exists in the interrogatory\n\nresponses, insofar as they fail to adequately address questions about Eurofed’s interest in the\n\n\n\n                                                 60\n\fdefendant assets, the Court does not agree that Eurofed has “failed to respond at all” to those\n\ninterrogatories, and it will not strike Eurofed’s claim on this basis.\n\n\n                                      D. Prudential Standing\n\n               Finally, the plaintiff argues that Eurofed’s claim should be dismissed as a matter\n\nof “prudential standing,” because the bank’s asserted interest in the defendant assets purportedly\n\ndoes not satisfy the definition of an “owner” under 18 U.S.C. § 983(d)(6). That definition is part\n\nof the “innocent owner defense,” which allows claimants to defeat a civil forfeiture by proving\n\ntheir innocent ownership of the res by a preponderance of the evidence. Id. § 983(d)(1).\n\n               Eurofed need not prove at this juncture that it is an innocent owner under Section\n\n983(d)(6), and any suggestion to the contrary “conflates the requirements of standing with the\n\nultimate merits of the Liquidator[s’] affirmative defense to defeat forfeiture.” United States v.\n\n$7,599,358.09, --- F.

These decisions all hinge on a claimant’s lack of statutory\n\nstanding, where there is no possibility that the claimant can prove innocent ownership of the\n\ndefendant property — either because the facts pled by the claimant do not support any ownership\n\ninterest satisfying the criteria of Section 983(d)(6), or because the evidence unequivocally shows\n\nthat the claimant lacks such an ownership interest.

Mar. 31, 2009). But that is not the case here.\n\nSection 983(d)(6)(A) defines an “owner” as “a person with an ownership interest in the specific\n\nproperty sought to be forfeited,” and Eurofed has made a colorable showing of such an interest.\n\nSee supra at 23-31. While Section 983(d)(6)(B) excludes unsecured creditors, bailees, and\n\nnominees from the definition of “owner,” none of these categories encompasses the ownership\n\ninterest that Eurofed has asserted and that it has supported with evidence. This final bid to\n\ndismiss Eurofed’s claim therefore fails as well.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   62\n\f                                        V. CONCLUSION\n\n               While the plaintiff’s myriad arguments have put Eurofed through its paces, not\n\none of these arguments carries the day. Eurofed, acting by and through its Liquidators, has\n\ndemonstrated that it has a colorable ownership interest in the defendant assets located in Antigua.\n\nIt therefore has standing to contest the forfeiture of those assets, and its claim to them will\n\nsurvive the plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment. That Eurofed has satisfied the criteria\n\nnecessary to establish standing at the summary judgment stage, however, does not mean that the\n\nCourt “may not revisit the issue at later stages in the litigation.” United States v. $148,840 in\n\nU.S. Currency, 521 F.3d at 1278.\n\n               An Order consistent with this Opinion will issue this same day.\n\n               SO ORDERED.\n\n\n                                               /s/__________________________\n                                               PAUL L.
