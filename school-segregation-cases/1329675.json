Defendant-Appellant, Marck, supplied\nnine containers of mugs to Plaintiff-Appellee, Mugworld, under a 2005\nagreement. When issues over the mug quality arose, a series of e-mails were\nexchanged between the parties. After Mugworld returned the coffee mugs, a\ndispute over the credit due arose between the parties. When resolution of the\nproblem deteriorated, Mugworld filed suit in Cooke County, Texas, and Marck\nhad the case removed to the Eastern District of Texas predicated on diversity.\n\n       *\n         Pursuant to 5TH CIR . R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not\nbe published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR .\nR. 47.5.4.\n\f                                 No. 08-41156\n\nMugworld’s motion for summary judgment on Marck’s counterclaims under the\nLanham Act, unfair competition claims and related conspiracy claims was\ngranted by the district court. The district court denied Mugworld’s summary\njudgment motion on the construction of the new agreement between the parties\nand proceeded to a bench trial on the breach of contract claim and Texas\nBusiness and Commerce Code’s Deceptive Trade Practice Act (DTPA) claim.\n      At trial, the district court found that an original agreement existed\nbetween Marck and Mugworld for the sale of nine containers of mugs but that\nthe communications between Marck and Mugworld in the resolution of the\ndispute that subsequently arose acted as a novation.        The district court\ndetermined that under the new agreement, Marck offered to credit Mugworld for\nall mugs deemed not acceptable to Mugworld upon the return of the mugs to\nMarck. Because Mugworld returned the mugs, the district court found that\nMugworld accepted the new agreement. The district court stated that Marck’s\nOctober 6, 2005 e-mail to Mugworld informing Mugworld that Marck would no\nlonger issue a full credit for returned mugs was a breach the parties’ new\nagreement by Marck; thus, the district court awarded breach of contract\ndamages to Mugworld along with attorney’s fees. The district court also found\nthat Marck did not violate any sections of the DTPA but that Mugworld did not\nbring the claims in bad faith, and therefore, the court denied Marck’s\ncounterclaim under Section 17.50(c) of the DTPA for attorney’s fees and costs.\n      We have jurisdiction over this case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291 because\nthe district court entered final judgment on September 18, 2008. Marck insists\nthat its Lanham Act and other related claims involved material facts that should\nhave proceeded to trial.   Marck contends that the novation only permitted\nMugworld to return commercially unacceptable mugs, not all the coffee mugs,\nand asserts that the attorney’s fees awarded were unreasonable.\n\n\n\n                                       2\n\f                                  No. 08-41156\n\n      We affirm the district court’s judgment for the following reasons. As\nneither a Mugworld consumer or direct or indirect competitor, Marck lacked\nstanding to bring a Lanham Act and unfair competition claim. See Proctor &\nGamble Co. v. Amway Corp., 242 F.3d 539, 562-63 (5th Cir. 2001) (adopting a\nbalancing test for statutory standing under the Lanham Act and considering the\ndirectness or indirectness of the asserted injury as one of five factors that must\nbe weighed by the court); see also Little v. KPMG LLP, 575 F.3d 533, 541 (5th\nCir. 2009) (“The competitors’ claim of injury depends on several layers of\ndecisions by third parties–at minimum, KPMG’s Texas clients–and is too\nspeculative to confer Article III standing.”). Even if we assume standing exists,\nMarck failed to prove that it had been or was likely to be injured as a result of\na Lanham Act violation and failed to raise a fact issue with respect to several\nelements of its claims, including that it was injured by Mugworld’s conduct or\nthat any deception actually deceived or had a tendency to deceive consumers and\ncaused consumers to buy Mugworld’s mugs over a competitor’s. See Schlotzsky’s,\nLtd. v. Sterling Purchasing & Nat’l Distrib. Co., 520 F.3d 393, 401 (5th Cir.\n2008) (“[A]t least the likelihood of injury must be proven in this case even if only\ninjunctive relief is to be ordered.”). Marck did not offer non-speculative evidence\nto show even the likelihood of injury. The district court thus did not err in\ngranting Mugworld’s motion for summary judgment as to Marck’s counterclaims.\n      Marck next argues that while a novation existed, the new agreement did\nnot allow Mugworld to return all the coffee mugs for credit, only those deemed\ncommercially unacceptable. Because the new agreement between the parties\nappeared ambiguous, the meaning of the new agreement presented a question\nof fact. See Harris v. Rowe, 593 S.W.2d 303, 306 (Tex. 1979). The district court’s\nfactual findings as to the meaning of the agreement should therefore be reviewed\nunder the deferential clear error standard. See Houston Exploration Co. v.\nHalliburton Energy Servs., Inc., 359 F.3d 777, 779 (5th Cir. 2004) (reviewing the\n\n                                         3\n\f                                  No. 08-41156\n\ndistrict court’s factual findings in a bench trial under the clear error standard).\nA plausible finding of fact may not be reversed by a court of appeals, “even\nthough convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have\nweighed the evidence differently.” Anderson ex rel. Anderson v. Canton Mun.\nSeparate Sch. Dist., 232 F.3d 450, 453 (5th Cir. 2000) (citation omitted). After\nreviewing the entire record, the district court was within its discretion to find\nwhether an agreement to accept only commercially unacceptable mugs did or did\nnot exist based on the evidence presented. Although a reasonable argument can\ncertainly be made that some of the evidence indicates the parties contemplated\nthat only commercially unacceptable mugs could be returned to Marck, an\nalternative reasonable interpretation of the evidence is not sufficient to establish\nclear error. Instead, the district court found that Mugworld was entitled to\nreturn any mugs it deemed as unacceptable under the novation. Therefore, the\ndistrict court’s interpretation of the new agreement is not clearly erroneous.\n      Marck also contends that no attorney’s fees should be awarded because\nMugworld sought recovery based on the original contract instead of the novation\nagreement. This court reviews awards of attorney’s fees under an abuse of\ndiscretion standard. Adams v. Unione Mediterranea Di Sicurta, 364 F.3d 646,\n656 (5th Cir. 2004). Texas law requires a plaintiff to segregate the hours worked\namong claims when the plaintiff seeks to recover fees in a case involving\nmultiple claims, at least one of which supports a fee award and at least one of\nwhich does not. Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d. 299, 310-11\n(Tex. 2006). Mugworld did not assert separate and distinguishable claims for\nrecovery.   This dispute was simply a contract claim, on which Mugworld\nprevailed. The district court noted that Marck failed to cite any Texas cases\nmandating the sort of intra-claim segregation that it requests—and so do we.\nBecause the district court found that Marck breached the new agreement\n\n\n\n                                         4\n\f                                 No. 08-41156\n\nentitling Mugworld to an award of damages on the breach of contract claims, the\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in awarding fees to Mugworld.\n      For the above reasons, the district court’s judgment is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                       5\n\f",
