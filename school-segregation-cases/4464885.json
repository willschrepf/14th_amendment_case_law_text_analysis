Texas law\n\nprohibits this? Further, Ironshore has the burden of proving its objections and asserted\n\nprivileges. Ironshore cites no law, provides no facts, and attaches only self-serving, conclusory\n\naffidavits. 3 Its motions should be denied.\n\n         Additionally, and as fully articulated m Denbury's Motion to Compel, Ironshore's\n\n\n\n\n1 Ironshore filed two separate Motions for Protective Order. One for the Ironshore corporate notice and one for the\nFARA corporate notice. Denbury files this combined response for purposes of judicial efficiency. FARA is the\nthird-party claims administrator for lronshore and under lronshore's control for all purposes IDlder applicable Texas\nrules.\n2 See Tex. R. Civ. P. 192.3(a); see also Ford Motor Co. v. Castillo, 279 S.W.3d 656, 664 (Tex. 2009) (\"The phrase\n'relevant to the subject matter' is to be 'liberally construed to allow the litigants to obtain the fullest knowledge of\nthe facts and issues prior to trial.\"') (internal citations omitted).\n3 Denbury had requested Ironshore provided it with a Rille 193.3(b) compliant privilege log for its discovery\nresponses since, at least, August 5, 2015. Ironshore refused to do so for over 45 days. Now, in response to\nDenbury's motion to compel, lronshore has produced the third iteration of its privilege log, an \"Amended Privilege\nLog,\" dated September 25,2015, attached hereto as Exhibit T.\n\n                                                           1\n\fobjections and asserted privileges are unfounded. 4 This is an insurance coverage lawsuit between\n\nDenbury and its excess insurers. The crux of this coverage dispute is whether the parties intended\n\nto cover damages to third-party property that Denbury leases in its oil and gas operations.\n\nDenbury's position is that it does. The Umbrella policy's blended pollution endorsement was\n\nspecifically added to provide this coverage. 5 AGUe's $25 million payment suggests Denbury's\n\ninterpretation reflects the parties' actual intent when the policies issued. Ironshore's position is\n\nthat its follow-form policy excludes this coverage. 6\n\n           Relevant to this discovery dispute, Denbury seeks a declaratory judgment that the\n\nIronshore Policy provides coverage. Denbury requests damages for lronshore's breach of\n\ncontract, bad faith, and unfair trade practices. Denbury also alleges that certain terms and\n\nconditions of Denbury's policies are ambiguous and/or provide illusory coverage. Denbury's\n\ndeposition notices seek basic information relevant to these allegations. 7 While Denbury's notices\n\nare exhaustive, 8 the number of topics is driven entirely by Ironshore's refusal to provide\n\n\n\n4             .\n  See Tex. R. Civ. P. 192.6(a) and 215.1; see also Pace v. Jordan, 999 S.W.2d 615,622 (Tex. App.-Houston [1st\nDist.] 1999, pet. denied) (if a party moves for protective order, the party seeking the discovery should file a motion\nto compel).\n5   See Blended Pollution Endorsement, attached as Exhibit 5 to Denbmy's Second Supp. and Am. Pet.\n6   See Ironshore letter denying coverage, dated June 16,2015, attached to Denbury's Mot. to Compel, as Exhibit M.\n7 See 'l1:li.87-88 (declaratory judgment of coverage), 89-94 (breach of contract), 105-113 (bad faith), Denbmy's 2nd\nSupp. Am. Pet., filed of record June 9, 2015. Denbmy also alleges that lronshore's marketing of the policy to oil and\ngas operators (and then denial because portions of the damaged property are subject to mineral leases) constitutes an\nunfair trade practice. Id. at CJI'lJ.98-1 04. Texas courts have allowed discovery of extrinsic materials in the interpretation\nof a breach of contract claim. See, e.g., Ford Motor Co. v. Castillo, 279 S.W.3d at 663 (Tex. 2009) (internal citations\nomitted) (\"Like any other breach of contract claim, a claim for breach of settlement agreement is subject to\nestablished procedures ofpleading and proof. .. \"it cannot be determined without \"full resolution of the surrounding\nfacts and circumstances.\"); see also id. at 664 (\" ... a party is not required to demonstrate the viability of defenses\nbefore it is entitled to conduct discovery.\"). Here too, the allegations of Denbmy's well-pled claims are sufficient to\ntrigger the discoverability of materials and testimony responsive to Denbury's tailored requests.\n8 See Denbmy's Notice of Corporate Dep. to lronshore, attached hereto as Exhibit P; see also Denbmy's Notice of\nCorporate Dep. to FARA, attached hereto as Exhibit Q. Unless otherwise noted, Denbmy's reference or citation to\n\"Exhibits A-0\" herein refer to the exhibits attached to Denbmy' s Mot. to Compel, flled of record on September 22,\n2015. Denbury attaches an Appendix detailing all Exhibits to its Motion to Compel and this Response for the\nCourt's ease of reference. See attached Exhibit V.\n\n                                                              2\n\fmeaningful responses to discovery.9\n\n           Ironshore, as the party resisting discovery, bears the burden of proving Denbury's\n\nrequests seek irrelevant information. lO Ironshore must also present facts showing a particular,\n\nspecific, and demonstrable injury.l1 Ironshore cannot simply make conc1usory allegations. 12\n\nSome evidence must be produced in support of its requested protective order. l3 If this evidentiary\n\nburden is not satisfied, then the trial court abuses its discretion by entering the protective order to\n\nlimit otherwise proper discovery.14 Denbury asks the Court deny Ironshore's motions.\n\n\n\n\n9 See generally Denbury's Mot. to Compel; see also Tex. R. Civ. P. 193.2(e) (\"an objection ... that is obscured by\nnumerous unfounded objections, is waived unless the court excuses the waiver for good cause shown.\"); Garcia v.\nPeeples, 734 S.W.2d 343, 347 (Tex. 1987) (0 rig. proceeding) (\" ... th[e] goal of the discovery process is often\nfmstrated by the adversarial approach to discovery. The 'mles of the game' encourage parties to hinder opponents\nby forcing them to utilize repetitive and expensive methods to find out the facts. The truth about relevant matters is\noften kept submerged beneath the surface of glossy denials and formal challenges to requests until an opponent\nunknowingly utters some magic phrase to cause the facts to rise. Courts across the nation have commented on the\nlack of candor during discovery in complicated litigation .... \"). The cost-effective, reasonable sharing of\ndiscoverable information is all Denbury's notices and written requests seek.\n10 See In re Waste Management of Texas, Inc., 2011 WL 3855745 at *5, n. 5 (Tex. App.-Corpus Christi, 2011) (\"We\nnote that this Court and others have placed the burden of proof regarding relevance, or lack thereof, on the party\nseeking to avoid discovery.\"). And note Denbury fully addresses Ironshore's unsupported relevance objections in its\nseparately filed Mot. to Compel.\n11   See Garcia v. Peeples, 734 S.W.2d at 345.\n12 I d. (requiring affidavits in support of protective order to identify specific documents and information responsive to\n\nrequests, and specific facts supporting bases for shielding same from discovery together with specifics relative to\nlikely harm absent requested protection). Of note, while the Peeples court found the details of the subject affidavits\nsufficient, not only are Ironshore's affidavits lacking the factual specificity relied upon by the Court, but the solution\nreached there involved production of responsive documents subject to protective order. Denbury has not objection to\nsuch a remedy here and, indeed, has voluntarily offered to execute a confidentiality agreement on numerous\noccasions. See Exhibits A and B, Denbury's Mot. to Compel.\n13 Id. (\"In United States v. Garrett, 571 F.2d 1323 (5th Cir. 1978), the court noted that a movant must show \"a\nparticular and specific demonstration of fact as distinguished from stereotyped cOllclusory statements.

Denbury's Deposition Topics are Reasonably Tailored to Include Only\n                   Relevant Matters\n\n       The purpose of discovery is to allow the parties to obtain knowledge of the issues and the\n\nfacts prior to trial. Texas courts recognize \"the ultimate purpose of discovery is to seek the truth\n\n\n                                                                  5\n\fso that disputes may be decided by what the facts reveal, not by what is concealed.,,15 Rule\n\n192.3(a) entitles Denbury to seek discovery \"regarding any matter that is not privileged and is\n\nrelevant to the subject matter of the pending action, whether it relates to the claim or defense of\n\nthe party seeking discovery or the claim or defense of any other party.\" The information sought\n\nneed not be admissible in evidence so long as it \"appears reasonably calculated to lead to the\n\ndiscovery of admissible evidence.,,16 These rules regarding the scope of discovery apply\n\nregardless of the discovery method at issue.\n\n        Texas law requires discovery requests be reasonably tailored to avoid including tenuous\n\ninformation, while still obtaining the necessary, pertinent informationY Denbury satisfies this\n\nrequirement by seeking 3 basic categories of information:\n\n         1. IronshorelFARA's adjustment of Denbury's Claim; 18\n\n        2. Denbury's Policies, including the underwriting of the policies at issue;19 and\n\n        3. Ironshore/FARA's adjustment of on-lease pollution damages claimed by similarly-\n\n             situated oil and gas operators under identical policy forms.z°\n\n\n\n\n15 See Jampole v.

Denbury properly limits its requests to relevant time\n\nperiods and only Ironshore's handling of analogous claims?2, 23\n\n          Additionally, Ironshore publicly represents that it has \"designed a more efficient system\n\nto address and process claims.\" 24 lronshore's website states that \"Our claims and underwriting\n\ndepartments work as one unit under the same leadership team.

Of note, Ironshore has provided Denbury\nwith \"supplemental productions\" dated September 4, 2015, September 18, 2015, and September 25, 2015. These\nproductions are not \"supplemental,\" but a calculated piecemeal production of information and materials Denbmy is\nlawfully entitled to discovery under Texas law.

However, lronshore' s production of these materials excludes large\nranges of entire pages, and its privilege logs do not allow for an accurate assessment of date range, author, recipient,\nor any other identifying information necessary to determine application of privilege. Denbury has not included these\nrecords in this filing due to size, where nearly every page produced is a duplicate of pleadings, communications, and\ndiscovery exchanged between parties to this lawsuit.\n28 See Description of withheld documents bates labeled, FARA 4084-6608, Item No. 136, lronshore \"Amended\nPrivilege Log\" produced September 25,2015, attached hereto as Exhibit T.\n\n                                                           8\n\fproduce evidence concerning the applicability of a particular privilege.,,29 Ironshore's motions\n\nlist privileges and objections without any legal or evidentiary support.

Ironsh.ore Cannot Sh.ield Responsive Materials as Work Product\n\n          Ironshore asks this Court to prevent Denbury from eliciting testimony on the basis of\n\n\"work product\" privilege. 3o The disputed topics include the underwriting and interpretation of\n\nthe policies at issue, as well as IronshorelF ARA' s adjustment of Denbury' s claim?l In support,\n\nIronshore filed the conclusory, self-serving affidavit of its attorney Randell Treadaway on\n\nSeptember 25,2015. 32 This self-serving affidavit is insufficient under Texas law. 33\n\n           \"Work product\" is defined as: (1) \"materials prepared or mental impressions developed in\n\nanticipation of litigation or for trial by or for a party or a party's representative ... ;\" or (2) \"a\n\ncommunication made in anticipation of litigation or for trial between a party and the party's\n\nrepresentatives or among a party's representatives ... ,,34 Work product only protects materials\n\nprepared in anticipation of litigation or trial prepared by an attorney, a party, or a party's agent.\n\n\n\n29See Peeples v.

There is no litigation or\n\nanticipated litigation when an insurer drafts and places a policy?8 Rather, these materials directly\n\nevidence what Ironshore intended to cover when issuing Denbury's policy.39\n\n           Similarly, Texas law provides that the work product privilege does not attach to claims\n\nfile information until after a claim is denied. 4o To qualify as work product under Texas law,\n\nmaterial must have been prepared or mental impressions developed in anticipation of litigation or\n\n\n35   State v.

Then, the Court may determine the applicability of Ironshore's asserted\n\nprivilege and order Ironshore to produce properly discoverable documents and testimony\n\naccordingly.\n\n                                         1.

The Court disagrees. Not only is information in the\n         underwriting file relevant to Plaintiffs daims for denial of coverage but it is also\n         discoverable because it appears reasonable that the information contained in the\n         file may lead to the discovery of other admissible evidence.\n\n\nanticipation of litigation privileges.\n48 Denbury's claim file is also relevant for Denbury to refute Ironshore's contention that Denbury failed to timely\nnotify Ironshore of its settlement discussions with third parties, such as ANR and Loutre Land & Timber Company.\nSee e.g. FC Bruckner Associates, L.P. v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co., 114 A.D. 3d 542 (N.Y.A.D. 1 Dept., 2014)\n(insurer's claims files were material and necessary where excess insurer claimed it would have been more involved\nwith underlying action had it received earlier notice). Ironshore claims it did not timely receive information from\nDenbury. See e.g. lronshore's objections and responses to Request for Admission No.7, attached as part of Exhibit\nK.\n49Bayley Canst. v. Wausau Business Ins. Co., 2012 WL 6553790, *2 (W.D. Wash., 2012) (decided, in relevant part,\nunder Federal Rules of Civil Procedure); see also Garcia v.

Because Denbury alleges\n\nthe policies are ambiguous and/or illusory, Ironshore's underwriting guidelines and files are\n\nrelevant to determine the intent of the parties when entering into the insuring agreement. 50\n\nIronshore's underwriting materials and claims file are also the only means available to Denbury\n\nto discover lronshore's understanding of the ambiguous policy provisions at issue. 51\n\n           Only core work product is exempt from disclosure. 52 The doctrine protects against\n\ncompelled disclosure of information and materials prepared in anticipation of litigation or for\n\ntrial. 53 However, the doctrine permits discovery oiother work product when the party seeking\n\ndiscovery has substantial need for the materials and that party is unable, without undue hardship,\n\nto obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials by other means. 54 Denbury is unable to\n\nobtain the substantial equivalent of the materials located in the claims and underwriting files by\n\nany other means. Thus, even if the Court finds certain materials protected as work product,\n\nDenbury is entitled to all non-core work product documentation and testimony. For these\n\nreasons, and further in the alternative, Denbury asks the Court order Ironshore to produce a\n\nwitness to testify as to, and to produce, all non-core work product documents responsive to\n\nDenbury's noticed areas of inquiry.\n\n\n50See Beazer Homes Corp. v.

Ironshore Fails to Meet Its Burden of Proving Attorney-Client Privilege\n\n          Ironshore also asks this Court to prevent Denbury from eliciting testimony on the basis of\n\n\"attorney-client\" privilege. 55 The disputed topics again include Ironshore's underwriting and\n\ninterpretation of the policies at issue, as well as IronshorelFARA's adjustment of Denbury's\n\nclaim. And again, Ironshore fails to meet its burden of proof. 56 Because Ironshore cannot shield\n\nthese materials based on an unsubstantiated privilege, the Court should deny Ironshore's\n\nrequested relief without further inquiry.\n\n           Still, Tex. R. Ev. 503 only shields confidential communications between the attorney and\n\nclient when those communications are made for the purpose of rendering legal services. Not all\n\nstatements made between a client and an attorney are privileged. 57 Texas courts have specifically\n\nfound that communications with an attorney investigating an insurance claim are not\n\nprivileged. 58 Because the attorney-client privilege does not apply where the attorney acts in a\n\ncapacity other than that of an attorney, Ironshore's employment of counsel to investigate or\n\nadjust Denbury's claim does not \"cloak with privilege matters that would otherwise be\n\ndiscoverable.,,59 Instead, Ironshore most satisfy its burden of proving that specific documents\n\nwere properly withheld on the basis of attorney-client privilege by pleading specific facts to\n\ndemonstrate that the communications and materials at issue were prepared in Ironshore's\n\n\n\n55 See Ironshore Topic Nos. 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 77, 78, 95, 96, 97, and 98 attached as Exhibit P; see also PARA\nTopic Nos. 28, 29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,84, 100, 101, 102, 103, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135,\n136, and 137, attached as Exhibit Q.\n56   State v.

Lowry, 802 S.W.2d 669, 671 (Tex. 1991). See also Item 138 on Ironshore's \"Amended Privilege Log\"\n     (attached as Exhibit T) withholding documents bates labeled, JDA001-011, as the \"Joint Defense Agreement.\" No\n     date or recipient is provided for the withheld materials. As such, Denbury is unable to determine who is a party to\n     the agreement and when it was executed. Ironshore also withholds numerous documents on the basis of \"joint\nN    defense\" privilege from before both Denbmy's filing of the instant litigation on February 18, 2015 and Ironshore's\nN\n'-\n     June 16, 2015 denial of coverage. For joint defense privilege to attach, Ironshore must first substantiate a privilege\n o   of either work product or attorney-client. Denbury believes Ironshore has failed to satisfy either burden as detailed\n00\n     above; however, to the extent Ironshore's joint defense claims are related to alleged work product, Denbmy is\n     entitled to discover those materials exchanged before June 16,2015. And to the extent, Ironshore invokes attorney-\n     client privilege, Denbury is entitled to discovery all materials through the February 2015 filing of this litigation.\n     See, e.g., id. at Item Nos. 83, 88, 89, and 90.\n     73   See In re XL Specialty Ins. Co., 373 S.W.3d 46,54 (Tex. 2012) (emphasis in original).\n     74   !d. at 52-53\n     75 See id. at 52 (\"Thus, in jurisdictions like Texas, which have a pending action requirement, no commonality of\n     interest exists absent actual litigation.\" (emphasis added)).\n     76   See Category 4, p. 2, Ironshore's \"privilege log\" dated August 20,2015, attached as Exhibit H to Denbmy's Mot.\n     to   Comp; see also Item Nos. 83,87,88,89,90\n\n                                                                18\n\fdisclosed to third-parties.,,77 This means Ironshore \"must establish initially that the subject\n\ncommunications fall within the ambit of' another privilege.78 As detailed in the preceding\n\nsections, Ironshore has to support its claims of work product or attorney-client privileges. Thus,\n\nIronshore's attempts to circumvent Denbury's proper discovery under the \"joint defense\" rule\n\nmust also be denied.\n\n          Alternatively, Denbury asks for an order compelling Ironshore/FARA to produce for an\n\nin camera inspection, the documentation associated with the testimony upon which the joint\n\ndefense privilege is claimed. Then, the Court may determine the applicability of Ironshore's\n\nasserted privileges and order Ironshore to produce documents and testify accordingly.\n\n          n.       Ironshore's Unsubstantiated Procedural Obiections\n\n          In addition to the work product, attorney-client, and joint defense privilege assertions,\n\nIronshore also objects to 52 areas of inquiry in the Ironshore notice, and 83 in the FARA notice\n                            79\non procedural grounds.           Of those combined 135 topics, Ironshore replies that it \"will provide a\n\nwitness to testify as to this topic\" for 1 area. Ironshore also responds that \"no employee of F ARA\n\nis familiar with this topic\" for 3 areas,      80   and states \"Defendant will provide a witness to testify as\n\nto non-privileged information pertaining to this topic\" for 5 areas. 81 Denbury interprets\n\nIronshore's responses to mean lronshorelF ARA will refuse to answer any deposition questions\n\n\n77 See In re Seigel, 198 S.W.3d 21,27 (Tex. App.-E1 Paso 2006) citing In re Skiles, 102 S.W.3d 323, 326 n. 2 (Tex.\nApp.-Beaumont 2003); see also Robert W. Higgason, The Attorney-Client Privilege in Joint Defense and Common\nInterest Cases, 34 HOus. LAW. 20, 21 (1996) (\"The joint defense-common interest privilege must rest upon an\nunderlying privilege such as the attorney-client privilege or the attorney work product privilege.\").\n78 Id.\n\n\n79See generally Exhibits P and Q; respectively. Ironshore asserts seven different procedural objections: 1) overly\nbroad, 2) irrelevant, 3) insufficient particularity, 4) legal conclusion, 5) fishing expedition, 6) redundant/harassing,\nand 7) speculation. Denbury responds to these objections in its motion to compel, filed of record on September 22,\n2015 and its pre-motion correspondence with lronshore's counsel, attached to DenbUlY's Mot. to Compo as Exhibits\nAandB.\n80   See FARA Topic Nos. 52,53, and 134, Exhibit Q.\n81   See FARA Topic Nos. 84, and 100-103, Exhibit Q.\n\n                                                           19\n\fpertaining to the remaining 126 combined areas of inquiry for which IronshorelFARA did not\n\ninclude such a qualifying statement.\n\n        Denbury has provided comprehensive areas of inquiry. 82 It is not required to provide\n\nadvanced questions. All of Ironshore's procedural objections can be preserved by proper\n\nobjections at the depositions. Denbury urges the Court to deny Ironshore's motions, and compel\n\nIronshore's and F ARA' s corporate designees to provide testimony responsive to all noticed areas\n\nof inquiry .\n\n        HI.      Conclusion\n\n        Denbury has a limited amount of time to conduct these depositions. It does not intend to\n\nwaste resources on irrelevant or duplicative testimony. Denbury is entitled to question\n\nIronshore/FARA on the rationale of its denial, its understanding of Denbury' s policies, and the\n\napplication of those policies to the facts here. Denbury is also allowed to discover Ironshore's\n\ntreatment, and payment, of analogous claims for on-lease damages by similarly situated oil and\n\ngas policyholders conducting operations on leased property - policyholders to which Ironshore\n\nmarkets the policy at issue. Ironshore fails to prove any privilege sufficient to strike Denbury's\n\nareas of inquiry. Ironshore also fails to prove any procedural deficiencies that cannot be\n\ncorrected by objections during the deposition. Because Ironshore bears the burden of proof, its\n\nmotions fail.\n\n\n\n\n82 See James C. Winton and Farrel A.

Although I have attached a formal\nreport, below are just the highlights.\n\n\n\nBackground:\n\nDenbury Resources Inc. is an independent oil and natural gas company, whose\nprimary emphasis is on carbon dioxide (GC02u) enhanced oil recovery (GEORu) and\nthe redevelopment of older, depleted oil fields to recover stranded reserves of\noil that cannot otherwise be recovered by conventional methods. This is an\nextensive oil spill submitted by Denbury in which they claim cleanup costs nearly\n$40mm, (the figures have varied widely). It appears that a well policy may be\npaying as Denbury is not asking payment for the time being. As we previously\ndiscussed it may be that third party claims, if presented, may not be covered\nunder the Denbury well policy issued through Lloyds, but for now, no-one is\npressing a third party claim that we know of.\n\n\n\nPolicy general info:\n\nAs you may recall, Ironshore sits above 26mm in excess an underlying (issued by\nZurich-attached). Ironshore also follows form to the Zurich excess policy. I have\nreceived Zurich's coverage letter dated July 9, 2013, (attached) and I have spoken\nwith Carrie Von Hoff, the adjuster who penned the letter. As of today, 12/12/2013,\nZurich's coverage denial remains, largely based on the time element pollution\nendorsement. Zurich is taking the position that this loss was not sudden, but\nrather due to a failure in the GZaplocku system which leaked over a significant\nperiod of time. Zurich has retained Vertex Engineering to inspect the system\nonsite; however, they are not expecting the engineer's report until January, and\nwill advise if there is any change to their July 2013 declination.\n\n\n\nClarification as to claims:\n\nYou will notice in Zurich's coverage letter that there were three incidents in the\nDelhi Field, in Ascension Parish, Louisiana. It appears that Denbury may have\nagreed with Zurich's position on this and therefore since the July 2013\ndisclaimer, Denbury has withdrawn the first two claims as. The third is the\nlargest and the subject of this file.\n\n\n\n1.) Denbury discovered a leak at Delhi test site # 4 on March 20, 2013, which was\ncaused by the failure of a GZaplocku connection. Approximately 75 barrels of\nsaltwater and 2 barrels of oil were released into the right of way and adjoining\nproperty. Cleanup is under $200,000. (This claim has no been withdrawn).\n\n\n\n2.) On March 26, 2013, Denburyus foreman was notified of a leak at DFU 125-1. A\nlandowner reported an undetermined amount of saltwater on his property, caused by\na GZaplocku flow line failure. Expenses are approximately $1.5 million. (This\nclaim has been withdrawn).\n\n\n\n3.) On June 14, 2013, Denbury received a call that C02, saltwater and oil were\npresent on the TransCanada right of way, which is an indicator that there was a\nleak. Fluid containment and recovery continued at least until June 25, 2013.    (We\nhave been updated by Lockton, the new broker, who took the account over from\nMarsh, and they suggest that the cleanup costs total approximately $49 million,\nand source control efforts to stop the flow was $16 million. Denbury is\nevaluating other possible expenses as part of the claim and anticipate third party\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                      FARA004048\n\f       claims from TransCanada and possibly others, but to date we know of none.)\n\n\n\n       Recommendations:\n\n       Since Ironshore follows form to the Zurich excess policy, and a disclaimer has\n       been issued by Zurich, Ironshore may also follow the same terms as outlined by\n       Zurich. At this time no underlying carrier has tendered the matter, therefore\n       since Zurich has issued the denial, no response is currently pending from\n       Ironshore, unless you see some other reason to respond. We will follow with Carrie\n       Von Hoff of Zurich to see once their engineer constructs a report, if it may\n       change their coverage position. On June 18, 2013, Fara, on behalf of Ironshore,\n       acknowledged the claim to Denbury and expressly reserved all rights under the\n       Ironshore policy. Denbury had a response team in place and provided reports to all\n       carriers of their efforts and exposure. Initial discussions with Denbury Martha\n       Balogh- Risk Management Specialist Denbury Resources Inc., indicated that Denbury\n       will be responsible for this loss; however, we suggest that there remains much\n       investigation that is necessary before this matter can be fully evaluated, as such\n       we will be following with Denbury, Marsh and Zurich to determine the cause and see\n       if ZurichUs denial will be challenged.\n\n\n\n       Reserves:\n\n\n\n\n        MaryAnn Matthiessen\n       Senior Environmental Adjuster\n\n       609.618.4497 office\n       866.575.3192 toll free\n       985.624.8684 fax\n       MaryAnn.Matthiessen@Fara.com\n\n       FARA, A York Risk Services Company\n       1625 West Causeway Approach\n       Mandeville, LA 70471\n       </xmp>\n\n\n\n       Date     12/12/2813           Type: General\n       By       Mary Ann Matthiessen\n       Subject: TC with Carrie Von Hoff of Zurich\n\n       <xmp>Today I placed a call to Carrie Von Hoff who is the adjuster for Zurich.\n       Environmental Claims Specialist Carrie.von.hoff@zurichna.com\n       847-413-5465.\n\n\n       She is handling the claim on the primary layer and the initial excess for Zurich,\n       in which Ironshore's excess policy follows form.\n       I spoke with her in detail about her disclaimer, and she advised that at this time\n       Zurich's disclaimer of coverage remains) based on the time element pollution\n       endorsement that this event was not sudden nor accidental.\n       She has sent an engineering firm to the site and if they find anything different,\n       she will re-evaluate her coveage poisiton) but for now it remains.\n       I advised that I probably would check back with her in January 2814, as she did\n       not expect a report from her engineer prior to then.\n\n..-o   They are looking at a failure in the zaplock system which has caused multiple\n       leaks all along this same South Delhi field line.</xmp>\nr--\no\n       Date     12/12/2813           Type: General\n       By       Mary Ann Matthiessen\n       Subject: Reserves as of 12/12/13\n\n       <xmp>Reserves as of 12/12/21313\n\n\n\n\n       Claim Id:                               39271345\n\n       Claimant:                               South Delhi Field, LA Spill\n\n       Accident Date:                          06/14/2013\n\n       Description:                            Excess Claim Insured had a spill of C02,\n\n       Line Of Coverage:                       Commercial Excess Liability (Umbrella) I\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                            FARA004049\n\f      Sub Line:                                Liability - Property Damage\n\n                      111\n      Reserved: • • • •\n\n      Status:\n\n\n\n\n      </xmp>\n\n\n\n      Date     12/12/2013           Type: General\n      By       Mary Ann Matthiessen\n      Subject: EM from Jeff HIggins -Lockton- Zurich's disclaimer\n\n      <xmp>From: Higgins, Jeff [mailto:JHiggins@lockton.com]\n      Sent: Mon 11/25/2013 5:23 PM\n      To: Matthiessen, MaryAnn\n4-;\n      Cc: 'Martha Balogh'\no     Subject: Insured: Denbury Resources, Inc. - Matter: South Delhi Field, LA Spill -\n00    D/A: 6/14/13 Claim Number: FARA 3927045\no\n\n      Insured: Denbury Resources\n\n      Ironshore Specialty Insurance Company/FARA\n      Adjuster:                     Mary Ann Matthiessen\n      Claim Number:          FARA 3927045\n\n      Starr Surplus Lines Insurance Company/FARA\n      Claim Number:          FARA 3927048\n\n      MaryAnn,\n\n      Per your request, attached is the Zurich coverage letter pertaining to the Delhi\n      release~   We are working with Carrie now to resolve the reservations and coverage\n      questions she raised.

This\nis apparently going to be Zurich's position, as explained via telephone, that this\nwas no an instantaneous event as there have been slow leaks from this well over\nthe past several months that have gone unnoticed.\n\nMy intent is to submit all documents to Randy once we have the coverage position\nfrom Zurich, which should be shortly.\n\nLOSS FACTS: **MUCH IS STILL NOT KNOWN. WE ARE UNSURE OF THE CAUSE OF THE LOSS,\nTHE DETAILS OF HOW MUCH PRODUCT HAS BEEN LOST AND WHO THE PROPERTY OWNERS ARE AND\nTHE DETAILS OF THE WELL OPERATION.\n\nDenbury is an oil and gas company who leases and operates wells from private\nlandowners. At 3:10pm CT, Mr. Ryan Jacob, Denbury Onshore, LLC, received a call\nfrom US Environmental Services uUSESu confirming that C02, oil, and saltwater was\npresent on the TransCanada Right of Way. Large release of carbon-dioxide is a by\nproduct of the process at the source used to extract oil and bitumen (a sludgy\nform of petroleum) from the earth. Formal responsibilities for the South Delhi\nField, LA Incident were transferred from TransCanada Pipeline to Denbury Onshore,\nLLC.\n\nThe cause of the spill has not yet been determined.

We have acknowledged receipt of this loss ( June 16, 2013\nspill incident in SOUTH DELHI FIELD, LA) to Denbury Resources Inc.\n\nEffective for the term of April 1, 2013 to April 1, 2014, Ironshore provides\nDenbury Resources Inc., under policy number 000988602 , with excess liability\ncoverage in the amount of $25,000,000. This excess layer would apply only after\n$25,000,000 of primary and underlying insurance has been exhausted. As we\ndiscussed previously, the Zurich policy # AUC 9242673-01 is the controlling policy\nform to which the Ironshore policy follows form and we are awaiting Zurich's\ncoverage opinion.\n\nIt also appears that Denbury had an additional well policy issued by Lloyds, that\nmay have afforded coverage for the remediation of this loss, we are concerned\nbecause we see the costs projected near $80,000,000 for the remediation and want\nto be certain that Denbury understands the position of the underlying carrier.\nPlease advise if Denbury has pressed Zurich for reimbursement of remediation\ncosts.\n\nFinally, You had been waiting for approval to issue me a copy of Zurich's coverage\nopinion, at this time we again renew our request for Zurich's coverage opinion\nissued to Denbury.\n\n\n    Thank you,\nMaryAnn Matthiessen\nSenior Environmental Adjuster\n\n609.610.4497 office\n866.675.3192 toll free\n985.624.8684 fax\nMaryAnn.Matthiessen@Fara.com\n\nFARA, A York Risk Services Company\n1625 West Causeway Approach\nMandeville, LA 70471\n\n\n\nFrom: Carrie Von Hoff [mailto:carrie.von.hoff@zurichna.com]\nSent: Fri 10/11/2013 1:49 PM\nTo: Martha.Balogh@denbury.com\nCc: Matthiessen, MaryAnn; Richard Burgess; Higgins, Jeff\nSubject: Re: FW: South Delhi Field Incident - Cost Tracking Spreadsheet\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                     FARA004055\n\fHi Martha,\n\nNot at this point.

We don't know all the details surrounding the loss, nor do we know the\n      area that is being remediate, i.e.: is it Denbury controlled property or property\n      of neighboring parties. I will press Zurich for this information. I am waiting on\n      the name of their adjuster.\n\n      I think maybe we should wait to see Zurich's position and interpretation of the\n      policy. We can use their opinion as a starting point for Ironshore. I think this\n      would be prudent to avoid a potential conflict in position between the two\n      carriers.

Denbury has a\nresponse team in place and provides weekly reports to all carriers of their\nefforts and exposure.

This letter will acknowledge report of a June 16, 2013\n      spill incident in SOUTH DELHI FIELD, LA involving Denbury Resources Inc .. FARA\n      has set up a file for record purposesand given this a record locator number of\n      FARA-3927045.\n\n      Effective for the term of April 1, 2013 to April 1, 2014, Ironshore provides\n      Denbury Resources Inc., under policy number 000988602 , with excess liability\n      coverage in the amount of $25,000,000. This excess layer would apply only after\n      $25,000,000 of primary and underlying insurance has been exhausted.\n\n      Based on the exposure information supplied to date, it appears unlikely that the\n4-<\n      Ironshore policy will be implicated in this matter, and as such we are recording\no     this information for notice only. However, we understand that this matter recently\no     occurred and that claim development may be necessary to estimate the full value of\n\"1-   the potential losses; therefore, we would request that you notify us immediately\n.-<\n      if there are any adverse developments. We would also request that we be notified\n      if the insurance layer beneath the Ironshore layer values the claim in excess of\n      50% of their underlying limit. If this is an aggregate policy, we request that you\n      advise if the aggregate has a potential to breach the underlying limit.\n\n      Because it appears that the exposure will not reach the Ironshore layer at this\n      time, we have not evaluated coverage as it relates to these matters; therefore,\n      Ironshore expressly reserves all rights under the policy. Any failure to cite\n      policy conditions or exclusions at this time shall not preclude Ironshore from\n      citing other policy conditions or exclusions as may be applicable to this claim.\n        Should you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.\n\n\n      Sincerely)\n      MaryAnn Matthiessen\n      Sr. Environmental Adjuster\n      FARA, A York Risk Services Company\n      1625 West Causeway Approach\n      Mandeville, LA 70471\n      direct: 609-610-4497\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                           FARA004082\n\ffax: 985-624-8684\ntoll free:866-675-3192\nMaryAnn.Matthiessen@fara.com\n\n\n</xmp>\n\n\n\nDate     06/18/2013           Type: Initial Contact - Insured\nBy       Mary Ann Matthiessen\nSubject: Initial Contact With Insured\n\n<xmp>Claim was ack. to Denbury timely on 6/18/2013.\nFile to be closed\n</xmp>\n\n\n\nDate     06/18/2013           Type: Initial Contact - Claimant\nBy       Mary Ann Matthiessen\nSubject: Initial Contact With Claimant\n\n<xmp>High level excess coverage, not expected to breach carriers layer, contact\nwaived.</xmp>\n\n\n\nDate     06/18/2913           Type: Coverage\nBy       Mary Ann Matthiessen\nSubject: IRONSHORE SPECIALTY - 25mm xs of 25mm\n\n<xmp>Policy # 909988602\nIRONSHORE SPECIALTY INSURANCE CO\nEffective 04/01/2913 - 04/01/2014\n$25,090,000 xis $25,000,000\n\ncontrolling policy:\nGL09242578-01 ZURICH AMERICAN INS CO- $500k policy primary\n\nAUC 9242673-01 -AMERICAN GUAR & LIAB     94/01/2913 - 04/91/2914$25,099,000 xis of\nUnderlying\n\nIronshore is next $25mm excess of $25mm.</xmp>\n\n\n\nDate     06/18/2013           Type: General\nBy       Mary Ann Matthiessen\nSubject: Response to Supervisor\n\n<xmp>Ron.,\nAck. new loss for Denbury I will handle accordingly.</xmp>\n\n\n\nDate     06/18/2013            Type: Supervisory Claim Review\nBy       Ronnie Ronzello\nSubject: Supervisory Review\n\n<xmp>MaryAnn,\nNew loss.

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n       This is an insurance coverage dispute arising out of a well blowout that occurred in\n\nnortheastern Louisiana.    Plaintiffs Denbury Resources Inc. and Denbury Onshore, LLC\n\n(hereinafter collectively \"Plaintiffs\" or \"Denbury\") seek a declaratory judgment that Defendants\n\nmust indemnify Denbury for costs and expenses, not recoverable under the well control policy,\n\nand in excess of the underlying policies that Denbury incurred in responding to pollution\n\nresulting from the blowout. In the span of less than three months, with a flurry of discovery\n\nrequests, Plaintiffs have served Ironshore with over 207 discovery requests and submitted 264\n\fcorporate representative deposition topics of inquiry, of which most seek privileged, irrelevant\n\ninformation, in not merely an impermissible attempt to go on a fishing expedition, but rather, in\n\nan effort to dredge the lake in hopes of finding a fish. Despite Ironshore's timely responses, its\n\nproduction of over 3,000 pages of documents, its repeated supplementation of discovery\n\nresponses and production of a privilege log, supplemental privilege log and amended privilege\n\nlog, Plaintiffs continue to seek unfettered access to not only the claim file in this matter, and\n\nother unrelated matters as well, but apparently also seek to be allowed to generally peruse all\n\nevidence Ironshore may have regardless of privilege or relevancy. Plaintiffs seek irrelevant\n\ndiscovery beyond the policy language contained within the policies in an attempt to create\n\nambiguity, despite a recent United States Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals decision holding the\n\npolicy language at issue to be clear and unambiguous.       Further, Ironshore's liability on the\n\ncontract is undetermined; thus, Denbury's alleged requests to support its bad faith and claim\n\nmishandling claims are improper at this time.\n\n       Plaintiffs complain that Ironshore's production and responses are insufficient. To the\n\ncontrary, after participating in a discovery conference that lasted over three (3) hours to try to\n\nresolve the issues raised by Denbury, Ironshore has produced all of its relevant, responsive, non-\n\nprivileged documents as required by the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.            Consequently,\n\nPlaintiffs' Motion should be denied.\n\n                                   II. BACKGROUND FACTS\n\n       Denbury is an oil and gas operator who has mineral leases in the Delhi Field in north\n\nLouisiana and in other states, including Texas. In June 2013, under its mineral leases, Denbury\n\nwas performing enhanced oil recovery operations (\"EaR\") in the Delhi field, which is within\n\nDenbury's Holt-Bryant Unit, which involved injecting C02 through injection wells into the\n\n                                                 2\n\fformation under pressure and producing oil from production wells located in the field. As part of\n\nits operations, Denbury had numerous wells in the Delhi field and various surface installations to\n\nsupport its oil and gas operations.\n\n       On June 13,2013, during an inspection of the Delhi field, Denbury discovered reservoir\n\nfluids on the surface of the land in the vicinity of a pipeline right of way (\"ROW\") that runs\n\nthrough the Delhi field, where Denbury was performing its EOR operations. Upon investigation,\n\nDenbury discovered a plugged and abandoned well inside the Delhi Field, the Sun 220-2 well,\n\nhad blown out during its EOR operations in early June 2013 resulting in an uncontrolled release\n\nof reservoir fluids from the well. Denbury subsequently responded to the incident by drilling a\n\nwell to intercept and stop the flow of fluids from the Sun 220-2 well, after which Denbury began\n\ncleaning up the surface pollution in the Delhi field.\n\n        Although discovery has just begun in this matter, the evidence will show that on April 1,\n\n2013 when Denbury' s insurance came up for renewal, Denbury elected not to purchase insurance\n\ncoverage for well control or for pollution coverage for plugged and abandoned wells, or\n\ncommercial pollution liability insurance.       These insurance policies would have provided\n\ninsurance coverage for the costs Denbury incurred to regain control of the Sun 220-2 well, to\n\nclean up pollution in the Delhi field from the well, and for any damage to the land comprising\n\nthe Delhi field that resulted from the blowout. Now, as a result of Denbury' s failure to obtain\n\nthe proper insurance coverage to respond to this incident, Denbury seeks recovery of its clean-up\n\nand remediation expenses, and recovery for damage to the land comprising its Delhi field from\n\nits commercial general liability insurers, including Iron shore, whose policies clearly and\n\nunambiguously exclude coverage for damage to property Denbury owns, rents or occupies and\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\fwhich unambiguously exclude coverage for cleaning up pollution on land that Denbury owns,\n\nrents or occupies.\n\n       As with any major incident, Denbury put all of its insurance carriers on notice, including\n\nlayers not implicated by the event. Initially, the first excess layer, AGLIC, denied coverage for\n\nDenbury's claim under its policy. But on October 6, 2014, AGLIC tendered its $25 million\n\npolicy limit to Denbury, in payment of three claims, including a $9,900,000.00 settlement\n\nDenbury entered into without Ironshore's knowledge or consent with Loutre Land and Timber\n\nCompany (\"Loutre\") for damage to land that appears to be located within the Delhi field; an\n\n$8,755,139 settlement Denbury entered into without Ironshore's knowledge or consent with\n\nANR Pipeline Company for alleged damage to an ANR pipeline located in the ROW that runs\n\nthrough Denbury's Delhi field; and for $6,344,861 in cleanup and remediation costs on property\n\nthat Denbury characterized as being outside of its Delhi fieldlHolt-Bryant Unit, but which\n\nDenbury admits includes the ROW that runs through the Delhi field.\n\n        On September 22,2014, shortly before AGLIC tendered its policy limits to Denbury, the\n\nUnited States Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a decision in Pioneer Exploration, L.L.C. v.\n\nSteadfast Co., 767 FJd 503 (5th Cir. 2014), which considered the same property damage\n\nexclusion and Blended Pollution Endorsement exclusion that are contained in the excess liability\n\npolicies AGLIC and Ironshore issued to Denbury.        After considering the exclusions in the\n\ncontext of a well blowout that resulted in surface pollution, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals\n\nheld that under Texas law remediation and containment costs within the boundaries of a mineral\n\nlease are excluded from coverage under the \"owned, rented, or occupied\" exclusions contained\n\nin the \"Property Damage\" exclusion and \"Blended Pollution Endorsement\" attached to the\n\nSteadfast policy. Further, those policy exclusions and their limitations on coverage were held to\n\n                                                4\n\fbe clear and unambiguous, limiting the policy coverage to its clear meaning-coverage for third-\n\nparty damages to property or land that Denbury does not own, rent or occupy.\n\n          The dispute concerning the appropriate types of insurance Denbury should have\n\nprocured is also contained in Denbury's lawsuit, but those issues are strictly between Denbury\n\nand its broker, Marsh. Denbury's dispute with Ironshore is a coverage dispute based solely on\n\nthe interpretation of the unambiguous terms and conditions of Ironshore's policy to the facts and\n\nnothing more.\n\n          As stated      1ll   Denbury's brief, once AGLIe tendered its policy limits, Ironshore\n\nimmediately asked Denbury to provide information supporting its claim, including its settlement\n\nwith Loutre, its settlement with ANR, and how it allocated or identified the remediation expenses\n\nit incurred to clean up the land it leased and occupied from those expenses and/or damages\n\noutside of the land Denbury leased or occupied.                  Although Ironshore repeatedly requested\n\ninformation from Denbury about whether any timber outside of the Delhi field and/or the Holt-\n\nBryant Unit was damaged as a result of the blowout; the value of any such damaged timber, and\n\nan accounting of the clean-up expenses Denbury incurred cleaning up any pollution outside of\n\nthe Delhi fieldlH01t-Bryant Unit, Denbury has repeatedly refused to provide this critical\n\ninformation. 1 In fact, on November 11, 2014, Denbury responded to numerous requests for\n\ninformation from Ironshore by stating it was not \"making a distinction in its claim between 'on-\n\nlease' and 'off-lease' clean-up and related pollution costs,\" it could not identify the amount it\n\nspent cleaning up pollution outside of the Delhi field/Holt-Bryant Unit because it did not\n\nsegregate those expenses from what it spent cleaning up pollution within the field, and it was not\n\n\n\n\n1   See Exhibit M attached to PIs.' Mot. to Compel p. 1-2.\n                                                             5\n\fgomg to provide any further information about the Loutre settlement. 2                      Finally, although\n\nIronshore was made aware of a claim for loss of use of the ANR pipeline while the line was\n\nbeing repaired, in December 2014, without Ironshore's knowledge or consent and in direct\n\nviolation of the voluntary payment clause contained in the Ironshore policy, Denbury entered\n\ninto a $14,000,000.00 binding settlement agreement with ANR.\n\n        As a result of Denbury' s repeated failure to provide information supporting its claim, on\n\nJune 16,2015, Ironshore advised Denbury that while it would continue to investigate Denbury's\n\nclaim, based on the information provided by Denbury Ironshore must decline to accept, as being\n\ncovered property damage, AGLIC's payment of $9,900,000.00 to Loutre as that settlement\n\nappears to be payment for damage to property that Denbury leased and occupied, which is\n\nexcluded from coverage under Exclusion 8, Damage to Property, contained in the AGLIe and\n\nIronshore policies. 3 Ironshore also advised Denbury that based on Denbury's inability to identify\n\nthe amount it spent cleaning up pollution outside of the Delhi fieldlHolt-Bryant Unit, Ironshore\n\nmust decline Denbury's demand that Ironshore accept AGLIC's payment of $6,443,636.00 in\n\nwhat Denbury characterized as \"off unit\" clean up expenses.                      Finally, Ironshore advised\n\nDenbury that as a result of AGUC's payment of $16,244,861.00 in uncovered claims, the\n\nunderlying AGLIC policy has not been exhausted and Ironshore's policy has not been triggered.\n\n\n\n\n2 See Plaintiffs' November 11,2014 correspondence attached hereto as Exhibit 8. Further, it should be noted that\nPlaintiffs claim in their Memorandum in Support of their motion to compel that following Ironshore's October 23,\n2014 request for information that \"Denbmy replied in earnest to each and every RFI\" and filed suit thereafter on\nFebruary 19,2015 only after lronshore refused to accept or deny coverage. See PIs.' Memo. In Support of Mot. to\nCompel p. 3. However, Denbury actually filed its first lawsuit against Ironshore and the other defendants in this\nmatter much earlier on October 14,2014, the same day Denbury claims it made its formal claim under lronshore's\npolicy. See Exhibit 4 attached hereto, a copy of the docket sheet, Denbmy's Petition and civil process request for\nDenbury Resources Inc., et at. v. Ironshore Specialty Insurance Co., et at., Cause No. 2014-59947, in the 157th\nJudicial District Court of Harris County, Texas, for the Court's ease ofreference\n3 See Ex. M attached to PIs.' Mot. to Compel.\n\n\n\n                                                        6\n\f       There are three (3) policy limitations at the core of this insurance coverage dispute,\n\nincluding the Property Damage exclusion contained in the Ironshore policy; the Blended\n\nPollution Endorsement; and the voluntary payment clause, which clearly, unambiguously,\n\nand respectively exclude coverage for damage to property Denbury owns, rents or occupies;\n\ncoverage for remediation of pollution on land Denbury owns, rents or occupies; and which\n\nprohibit the settlement of any claims without first obtaining Ironshore's written consent. Despite\n\nthe fact Ironshore has produced thousands of documents that include all of its relevant,\n\nresponsive, non-privileged documents as required by the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure,\n\nPlaintiffs nonetheless seek recovery of information that is irrelevant and that will not lead to the\n\ndiscovery of admissible evidence, as well as information that is protected by the attorney-client\n\nand work-product privileges, which must be denied.\n\n                                   III. SCOPE OF DISCOVERY\n\n       While the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure allow Denbury a broad scope of discovery, a\n\ndiscovery request must nonetheless be reasonably tailored to include only matters that are\n\nrelevant to the case. In re Alford Chevrolet-Geo, 997 S.W.2d 173, 180-81 (Tex. 1999); In re\n\nAmerican Home Assurance Co., 88 S.W.3d 370,373 (Tex.App.-Texarkana 2002, no pet.). A\n\nlitigant may not use discovery as a weapon, or as a fishing expedition. Id. The court accordingly\n\nhas the authority to limit discovery when the requests are unreasonably cumulative or\n\nduplicative, or obtainable from a more convenient, less burdensome or less expensive source; or\n\nwhen the burden or expense of the discovery outweighs its likely benefit. TEX.R.OV.P. 192.4; In\n\nre Chevrolet-Geo, 997 S.W.2d at 181; In re American, 88 S.W.3d at 373. In general, a party\n\nmay obtain discovery regarding any subject matter that is not privileged, is relevant to the subject\n\nmatter of the pending action, whether it relates to the claim or defense of the party seeking\n\n                                                 7\n\fdiscovery or the claim or defense of any other party. TEX.R.CIv.PRO. 192.3. While the scope of\n\ndiscovery is quite broad, it is nevertheless confined by the subject matter of the case and\n\nreasonable expectations of obtaining information that will aid resolution of the dispute.\n\nTEX.R.CIv.PRO. 192.3, cmt. 1 (citing In re American Optical Corp., 988 S.W.2d 711 (Tex. 1998)\n\n(per curiam); K-Mart v. Sanderson, 937 S.W.2d 429 (Tex. 1996) (per curiam)).\n\n                                 IV. ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES\n\n        Plaintiffs assert in their motion to compel that they are entitled to responses to discovery\n\nrequests regarding Ironshore's underwriting, reserves, claims handling, reinsurance, claims\n\nadjustment, and other areas because \"the terms and conditions of Ironshore's policy are\n\nambiguous and/or illusory.,,4 Plaintiffs, however, have never asserted that any specific policy\n\nprovision, term, condition, exclusion or endorsement of Ironshore's policy is ambiguous.\n\nInstead, the only mention of ambiguity in Plaintiffs' live petition is the single sentence that\n\nclaims \"[e]xcess carriers and Marsh engaged in unconscionable conduct by selling insurance\n\npolicies with ambiguous and/or illusory coverage.\"s There is no assertion that any specific\n\npolicy language is ambiguous. To the contrary, Denbury asserts in its petition that \"[t]here are\n\nno applicable policy provisions, conditions or exclusions which preclude or limit the coverage\n\navailable to Denbury for these costs, or which mitigate the Excess carriers' obligations to\n\nindemnify Denbury under the Excess policies.,,6\n\n        The interpretation of a contract is governed first and foremost by the language contained\n\nwithin the contract. Under Texas law, a court must \"ascertain the true intent of the parties as\n\nexpressed in the instrument.\" Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. CBI Indus., Inc., 907 S.W.2d 517,520\n\n\n4 PIs.' Memo. In Support of Mot. to Compel at 6.\n5 PIs.' Second Supp. Am. Pet. at p. 22, <[104.\n6 PIs.' Second Supp. Am. Pet. at p. 21, <[93.\n\n                                                   8\n\f(Tex. 1995) (internal citation omitted). Extrinsic evidence is only admissible to interpret a\n\ncontract if the contract language at issue is ambiguous. Id. Importantly, extrinsic evidence is not\n\nadmissible for the purpose of creating an ambiguity. Id. Thus, before Denbury can colorably\n\nargue that the underwriting, reserves, claims handling, reinsurance, and claims adjustment\n\ninformation it seeks is reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, it\n\nmust show that the Policy language at issue is ambiguous. In that regard, Denbury has failed to\n\neven allege that a specific policy terms is ambiguous. Further, the Fifth Circuit has already held\n\nthe language at issue to be clear and unambiguous. Pioneer Exploration, L.L.c., 767 F.3d 503.\n\nExtrinsic evidence is admissible only to resolve an ambiguity, not to manufacture one. Courts\n\naccordingly have held that discovery of such extrinsic evidence is inappropriate until there has\n\nbeen finding that contraq language is ambiguous.         For example, in In re American Home\n\nAssurance Co., 88 S.W.3d at 377, the court held that a determination as to whether the disputed\n\npolicy language was ambiguous must precede efforts to discover extrinsic evidence \"because\n\nevidence would not be admissible that would conflict with the legal interpretation of that\n\nprovision.\" The court further noted that \"discovery undertaken with the purpose of finding an\n\nissue, rather than in support of an issue already raised by the pleadings, would constitute an\n\nimpermissible 'fishing expedition.'\" Id.\n\n           Importantly, Denbury has made no showing that the Policy is ambiguous. Instead, in one\n\nsentence, Denbury has vague! y asserted that \"[ e]xcess earri ers and Marsh engaged in\n\nunconscionable conduct by selling insurance policies with ambiguous andlor illusory coverage.\"7\n\nDenbury's bare assertion is plainly insufficient to show the Policy is ambiguous, as case law is\n\nclear that mere dissension over the meaning of contract language does not render a contract\n\n\n7   PIs.'

New Vlm Gas, Ltd., 940 S.W.2d 587,589\n\n(Tex. 1996) (an \"ambiguity does not arise simply because the parties advance conflicting\n\ninterpretations of the contract\").    Thus, the documents Denbury seeks are protected from\n\ndiscovery, and are irrelevant to this action. Accordingly, Denbury's motion to compel should be\n\ndenied.\n\n          By seeking to obtain evidence or testimony related to reasons why Ironshore issued the\n\npolicy or specific endorsements, Plaintiffs are attempting to use parole evidence to change the\n\nexpress and clear terms (and the coverages) of the policies at issue and create an ambiguity in the\n\npolicies where there is none. The meaning of the policy and the intent of the parties must be\n\ndetermined from the policy itself, not from extrinsic evidence. Carrabba v. Employers Cas. Co.,\n\n742 S.W.2d 709, 716 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1987, no writ) (holding disputed facts\n\nrelated to the circumstances surrounding the purchase of the policy and the intent of the parties in\n\nselecting the policy were not relevant and did not preclude summary judgment). \"The only\n\nrelevant evidence is the actual policy.\" [d.\n\n          Ironshore will now address the specific categories of requests Denbury has identified in\n\nits motion to compel in which it seeks the Court's intervention.\n\n    A. Denbury is Not Entitled to an Unredacted Complete Copy of the Claim File\n\n          Under Texas law, Denbury is not entitled to an unredacted and complete copy of the\n\nclaim file and claim notes maintained by Ironshore's Third-Party Administrator, FARA, as it\n\nwould include documentation and notes protected from disclosure by the attorney-client and\n\nwork product privileges. See TEX.R.CIV.P. 192.5(a) and (b). Further, the Texas Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure only provide for the disclosure of the existence and contents of any applicable\n\ninsurance agreement. See TEx.R.CIv.P. 192.3(f). In Loftin v. Martin, the Texas Supreme Court\n\n                                                 10\n\fheld a request for \"all notes, records, memoranda, documents and communications made that\n\n[plaintiff] contends support its allegations\" was so vague, ambiguous and overbroad as to amount\n\nto \"a request that [defendant] be allowed to generally peruse all evidence [plaintiff] might have.\"\n\n776 S.W.2d 145, 148 (Tex. 1989). Denbury goes further here and actually requests the claim file\n\nand notes not only for the present action but also claims handling information for other unrelated\n\nclaims.\n\n          Denbury requests this Court enter an order compelling Ironshore to produce a copy of\n\n\"Denbury's unredacted claim file and claim notes as well as all communications by Ironshore to\n\nthird-parties relative to Denbury's c1aim.\"g Under Texas law, however, an insurer's investigative\n\nfiles, such as the claim file and claim notes at issue, are not subject to discovery simply because\n\nthe plaintiff alleges bad faith and breach of contract claims in the same action. See Maryland Am.\n\nGen. Ins. Co. v. Blackmon, 639 S.W.2d 455, 458 (Tex. 1982). An insurer is entitled to assert a\n\nprivilege in response to actions for breach of contract and bad faith, so long as the insurer's\n\nliability on the contract is undetermined. Id. at 457-58.                 Ironshore's contractual liability to\n\nDenbury has not been determined. Therefore, Ironshore is entitled to assert the attorney-client\n\nand work product privileges in response to Denbury's claims. Accordingly, Denbury is not\n\nentitled to unredacted and complete claim file or claim notes.\n\n          Regardless, upon review of the Amended Privilege Log produced by Ironshore to\n\nDenbury, it demonstrates that only irrelevant documents or privileged documents and\n\ncommunications remain in the file. 9 Ironshore retained counsel regarding Denbury's claim on\n\n\n\n8PIs.'

During the course of that representation, Ironshore's counsel developed mental\n\nimpressions, prepared materials, and communicated with Ironshore regarding Denbury's claim.\n\nA review of the Amended Privilege Log reflects internal discussions regarding communication\n\nwith counsel, as well as direct communications with counsel, which are protected by the work\n\nproduct privilege. 1o Communications and correspondence with coverage counsel and defense\n\ncounsel in the instant lawsuit are protected from discovery by the attorney-client privilegeY\n\nCommunications among Ironshore's representatives are protected by the attorney-client privilege\n\nand are not discoverable as such communications are \"made for the purpose of facilitating the\n\nrendition of professional legal services to\" Ironshore and are not subject to a recognized\n\nexception or otherwise waived. TEx.R.EvID. 503(b)(1)(D).            There is no exception to the\n\nattorney-client privilege applicable to the communications among Ironshore personnel or with\n\nregard to communications pertaining to the instant lawsuit, nor has Ironshore waived the\n\nattorney-client privilege. The attorney-client privilege attaches to the complete communication\n\nbetween the attorney and the client. In re JDN Real Estate-MckInney L.P., 211 S.W.3d 907,922\n\n(Tex.App.-Dallas 2006, pet. denied). The subject matter of the information communicated is\n\nirrelevant when determining whether the privilege applies. Id. The privilege attaches to legal\n\nadvice and factual information included in the completed communications between the attorney\n\nand the client. Id.\n\n           Denbury seeks unfettered access to everything in the claim file and notes on this matter.\n\nTexas law has created privileges for work product and attorney-client communications which\n\nprevent Denbury' s overly broad requests. However, in certain circumstances, documents that do\n\nnot fall under privileges discussed above are placed in a claim file. For example, it is common\n\n10   See Am.

Denbury's Request for Ironshore's Entire Underwriting Files is Irrelevant and it\n         Seeks Information Protected by the Trade Secret Privilege\n\n           Courts must \"analyze disputes over insurance contracts under the well-established\n\nprinciples of contract construction, attempting to determine the parties' intent through the written\n\nlanguage of the policy.\" Mid-Continent Cas. Co. v. Global Enercom Mgmt., Inc., 323 S.W. 3d\n\n151, 154 (Tex. 2010). If the insurance policy is not ambiguous, the court must enforce it as\n\nwritten. Don 's Bldg. Supply, Inc. v. OneBeacon Ins. Co., 267 S.W. 3d 20, 23 (Tex. 2008). \"Parol\n\nevidence is not admissible for the purpose of creating an ambiguity.\" CBI Indus., Inc., 907\n\nS.W.2d at 520.\n\n           Under the live pleadings to this case, Ironshore's underwriting files are irrelevant and\n\nnon-discoverable because Denbury has not pointed out any policy terms that it contends are\n\nambiguous. Denbury is merely seeking parole evidence to create an ambiguity. Specifically,\n\nDenbury's single argument is that the \"Excess carriers and Marsh engaged in unconscionable\n\nconduct by selling insurance policies with ambiguous and/or illusory coverage.,,13 Denbury has\n\nfailed even to plead what terms it believes are ambiguous. Simply put, Denbury is seeking the\n\nunderwriting files as an impermissible fishing expedition for an ambiguity. As evidence, take\n\nDenbury's Second Request for Production No. 51, which requests \"[a]U documents related to or\n\n\n\n\n12   See lronshore's Am. Privilege Log attached as Ex. 1.\n13   PIs.' Second Supp. Am Pet. p. 22, 1104.\n                                                            15\n\fdiscussing how You Underwrite Energy Market insurance.\"14 This request is wholly unrelated to\n\nDenbury, the policy at issue, or this litigation.\n\n        Denbury offers no justification as to the relevance of the underwriting files, other than to\n\nmake a blanket statement, while citing an lllinois case, that \"[u]nderwriting files have long been\n\nheld to be relevant to prove the meaning of disputed policy terms and an insurer's understanding\n\nof those terms.\"15 This comes after failing to specify in its petitions any terms in Ironshore's\n\npolicy that Denbury contends are ambiguous and after Ironshore raised its discovery objections.\n\nDenbury's argument now is to allege that the underwriting file is relevant to prove the meaning\n\nof unspecified policy terms that are disputed. In the unlikely event this Court believes such\n\ngeneralizations suffice to allege ambiguity and make any portion of the underwriting file\n\ndiscoverable, this Court should exercise its discretion to narrowly tailor any production of the\n\nfile to those portions relevant as to specific policy provisions alleged to be ambiguous and for\n\nwhich courts have not already held are unambiguous. See In re American Home Assurance Co.,\n\n88 S.W. 3d 370.\n\n        However, notwithstanding the irrelevancy of these requests, Ironshore asserts that its\n\nunderwriting of the Energy Market; underwriting for any Ironshore policy, including the one at\n\nissue; and underwriting of any Ironshore policy provision are confidential and trade secrets. 16\n\nTexas Rule of Evidence 507 establishes a qualified privilege allowing a person to refuse to\n\ndisclose and to prevent others from disclosing trade secrets, provided the exercise of the\n\nprivilege will not tend to conceal fraud or otherwise work injustice. Trade secret issues are\n\n\n\n14 See Ironshore's Objections and Responses to Denbury's Second Request for Production No. 51 attached as Ex. K\n\nto PIs.' Mot. to Compel.\n15 See PIs.' Memo.

Quick Point Pencil Co., 940 U.S. 257, 265-66 (1979). A trade\n\nsecret is any fonnula, pattern, device or compilation of infonnation which is used in one's\n\nbusiness and presents an opportunity to obtain an advantage over competitors who do not know\n\nor use it. Computer Assocs. Int'l Inc. v. Altai, Inc., 918 S.W.2d 453, 455 (Tex. 1996). When a\n\nparty asserts trade secret privilege, the trial court must determine: (1) whether the information\n\nconstitutes a trade secret, and (2) if so, the court must require the party seeking production to\n\nshow reasonable necessity for the requested materials. In re Union Pacific R.R. Co., 294 S.W.3d\n\n589,591 (Tex. 2009).\n\n          Ironshore's \"business is underwriting and making insuring and indemnity decisions based\n\non that infonnation\", and thus, documents related to Ironshore's underwriting of policies are\n\ntrade secretP The infonnation is not public knowledge and is not known outside of Ironshore' s\n\nbusiness because \"Ironshore makes every effort to safeguard and protect its underwriting files\n\nand processes from persons outside of lronshore.,,18 Ironshore considers its underwriting to be\n\nconfidential and trade secret such that it would be \"irreparably harmed in the marketplace by\n\ndisclosing the information\" because \"[a]n insurance company's competitive advantage may be\n\npreserved by its trade secrets related to underwriting\" .19 Denbury must show a reasonable\n\nnecessity for Ironshore's underwriting files and documents in order to justify production. Which\n\nit has not done.         Denbury claims in its motion to compel that Ironshore's refusal to pay\n\nDenbury's claim after AGLIe paid its $25 million policy limit justifies production of all of\n\nIronshore's underwTiting infonnation and documentation. 20 However, as discussed in detail\n\nabove, there has not been any finding of ambiguity in any Ironshore policy provision and\n\n17ld.\n18ld.\n19ld.\n20   PIs.' Memo. In Support of Mot. to Compel at 13-14.\n                                                          17\n\fIronshore's contractual liability in this matter has not been determined. Instead, there is case law\n\non point interpreting the relevant terms of the policies at issue in this matter. Denbury only seeks\n\nIronshore's underwriting materials in an attempt to improperly use parol evidence to create\n\nambiguity. Ironshore has asserted and supported is claim of trade secret privilege regarding its\n\nunderwriting information and documentation, and therefore, Denbury's motion to compel in this\n\nregard should be denied.\n\n    C. lronshore's Reserve Information is not Discoverable or Admissible\n\n       As an initial matter, any discussion of the value of a potential legal claim likely is going\n\nto be privileged. Nevertheless, whether or not Ironshore altered its reserves is not relevant to\n\nwhether Ironshore has indemnity obligations under the policy. First, such reserve information\n\ncannot be considered to construe an unambiguous policy provision. Second, to the extent a\n\npolicy provision is ambiguous, reserve information does not shed any light to its interpretation.\n\nThird, reserve information is irrelevant to any bad faith claim. Rather, the relevant questions in a\n\nbad faith dispute are whether Ironshore knew it had indemnity obligations and whether Ironshore\n\nhad a bona fide dispute about its liability. See U.S. Fire Ins. Co. v. Williams, 955 S.W. 2d 267,\n\n268 (Tex. 1997) (\"Evidence that only shows a bona fide dispute about the insurer's liability on\n\nthe contract does not rise to the level of bad faith.\") The reserve information simply has no\n\nbeming on the outcome of whether the controlling policy had been exhausted by covered claims,\n\nwhether Denbury has demonstrated a loss within Ironshore's layer of coverage, or whether\n\nexclusions apply. See In re American Home Assurance Co., 88 S.W.3d at 377 (holding that a\n\ndiscovery order requiring documentation \"regarding the setting of reserves for third-party claims\n\nagainst the plaintiffs is improper because the information sought is not admissible and would not\n\nlead to the discovery of admissible evidence. \").\n\n                                                    18\n\f       In In re American Home Assurance Co., 88 S.W.3d 370, the court concluded discovery of\n\nreserve information was improper. Specifically, American Home involved a mandamus review\n\nof a discovery order compelling discovery of various information, including insurance reserves.\n\nld. at 371-72. In the underlying matter, the insured brought suit against its various insurers,\n\nclaiming those insurers refused to indemnify it for third-party claims made on its environmental\n\npolicies. ld. at 374. Thereafter, the insured sued its insurers under various theories of recovery,\n\nincluding, among others, breach of contract, fraud, declaratory judgment and violation of the\n\nTexas Insurance Code, and the trial court compelled the insurers to produce information\n\nincluding insurance reserves. ld.   Upon mandamus review, the Texarkana Court of Appeals\n\nsummarily concluded:\n\n       [R]equiring documentation ... regarding the setting of reserves for third-party\n       claims against the plaintiffs is improper because the information sought is not\n       admissible and would not lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\n\nId. at 377. The case instructs that discovery of such information is improper. Thus, the reserve\n\ninfonnation sought by Denbury is not discoverable under Texas law, and Denbury's motion to\n\ncompel in that regard should be denied.\n\n       Further, where Texas law requires setting of reserves, such reserves are not admissions of\n\nbad faith or unfair claims handling, and thus, are not discoverable.       Under Texas law, the\n\nquestion of whether an insurer engages in bad faith or unfair claims handling does not\n\nautomatically make relevant the insurer's setting of loss or claim reserves. Indeed, in Texas, an\n\ninsurer is required to maintain reserves. Tex. Ins. Code Ann. § 421.001 (Vernon 2007). The\n\npurpose of such statutes, enacted by Texas and other states, is to ensure that there is adequate\n\nmoney available for insurers to pay their claims, and do not constitute admissions by the insurer\n\nof any conduct, much less evaluation of liability in bad faith or unfair claims practice. See\n\n                                                 19\n\fHeights at Issaquah Ridge Owners Ass 'n v. Zurich American Ins. Co., No. C07-1045RSM, 2007\n\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 95213, at *6-7 (W.D. Wash. Dec. 13, 2007).             Texas law requiring the\n\nmaintenance and reporting of reserves creates obligations relevant to the financial condition and\n\nbusiness operations of the insurer. By complying, the insurer's establishment of loss reserves is\n\nnot an admission of any kind, is not a concession the insurer breached any duties owed to the\n\ninsured and does not constitute evidence the company has engaged in unfair claims practices.\n\nAccordingly, the establishment of a mandatory reserve has no bearing upon an insurer's liability\n\nin an action for bad faith or unfair claims practices.    Consequently, reserves information is\n\nsimply irrelevant to the issues here and Denbury's motion to compel should be denied in that\n\nregard. See In re American Home Assurance Co., 88 S.W.3d at 377. Texas insurers who are\n\nrequired to maintain loss or claim reserves as required by the Texas Department of Insurance\n\nmust not be penalized for compliance with that requirement. The use of loss or claims reserves\n\ninformation by insureds in litigation against the insurer is improper where the setting of reserves\n\nis in no way relevant and does not constitute an admission or concession of any kind, much less\n\nan admission of bad faith or unfair claims practices.\n\n       A common misconception exists that reserves are equivalent to an admission or valuation\n\nby the insurer. In a matter of first impression determining disclosure of reserve information was\n\nimproper where same was not reasonably calculated to lead to discovery of admissible evidence,\n\nthe Colorado Supreme Court explained that \"reserves should be not be equated with an\n\nadmission or valuation by the insurer\" and that reserve amounts are only partially within the\n\ninsurer's control. Silva v. Basin Western, Inc., 47 P.3d 1184, 1189 (Colo. 2002) (en banc). At\n\nleast one legal journal instructs that a presumption exists against disclosure of reserve\n\ninformation.

Although Denbury contends the amount of reserve set by\n\nIronshore in this case is discoverable, Denbury has not demonstrated in any fashion that the\n\nreserve information is relevant to the claims or defenses asserted in this matter. To the contrary,\n\nthe amount of reserves established by Ironshore is not relevant and is not reasonably calculated\n\nto lead to the discovery of admissible evidence on any claim or defense in this matter. As such,\n\nIronshore's objections to Denbury's Interrogatory No.9; First Set of Request for Production\n\nNos. 2 and 23; and Second Set of Request for Production Nos. 29, 30, and 31 should be\n\nsustained.\n\n    D. Denbury's Request to Compel Reinsurance Information Should be Denied\n\n        Denbury asserts that its bad faith allegations \"places additional facts at issue over and\n\nabove an ordinary insurance coverage action.\"21 Without citing Texas case law, it then broadly\n\nclaims that \"Ironshore's reinsurance information and communications are, therefore,\n\ndiscoverable to the extent 'the timing and content' of those documents can lead to the discovery\n\nof admissible evidence concerning Ironshore's evaluation of Denbury' s claim or the validity or\n\napplication of policy provisions to Denbury's claim throughout Ironshore' s adjustment.,,22\n\n        However, discovery of privileged material prepared by an insurer during its investigation\n\nand evaluation of a claim is improper where the insurer's liability for the claim has not been\n\ndetermined. See Blackmon, 639 S.W.2d at 458.                    Ironshore asserts that its risk management\n\nthrough reinsurance is information that it keeps confidential and is trade secret. 23             Further,\n\nDenbury's requests are moot because Ironshore has supplemented its discovery responses to\n\nprovide Denbury with a copy of the declarations page for its professional liability policy.\n\n\n21 See PIs.' Memo. In Support of Motion to Compel at 15.\n221d.\n23 See Lee Sheridan's Affidavit attached hereto as Exhibit 3.\n\n                                                         21\n\fAccordingly, Ironshore's objections to Denbury's Interrogatory No.1; First Set of Request for\n\nProduction Nos. 26 and 27; and Second Request for Production No. 16 should be sustained.\n\nIronshore has supplemented its response to Second Request for Production No. 69 seeking any\n\ninsurance policy that may defend or indemnify Ironshore in this litigation and produced a copy\n\nof the declarations page for professional liability insurance; therefore, this request is moot. 24\n\n     E. Denbury's Requests Regarding \"Similar Claims\" is an Overly Broad Fishing\n        Expedition in an Attempt to Harass Ironshore Before Ironshore's Contractual\n        Liability in This Matter is Determined\n\n        Denbury asserts that its discovery requests Interrogatory Nos. 10 and 12; First Request\n\nfor Production 4, 9, 10, 11, and 42; Second Request for Production 4-12 and 43-53; and Request\n\nfor Admission 52 seek information regarding similar claims. It should be kept in mind that.\n\n\" ... discovery is not only 'a tool for uncovering facts essential to accurate adjudication,' but also\n\n'a weapon capable of imposing large and unjustifiable costs on one's adversary.'\" In. re Alford\n\nChevrolet - Geo, 997 S.W.2d at 180.            As set forth by the Texas Supreme Court in Alford\n\nChevrolet - Geo, \" ... discovery may not be used as a fishing expedition or to impose\n\nunreasonable discovery expenses on the opposing party\". Id. at 181. Plaintiffs' requests seek\n\nirrelevant and likely inadmissible infonnation. Denbury's requests appear to be nothing more\n\nthan a fishing expedition and an attempt to impose large and unjustifiable costs on Ironshore. See\n\nIn. re American. Optical Corp., 988 S.W.2d 711; K-Mart Corp., 937 S.W.2d 429.\n\n        In these requests, Denbury seeks documents and infonnation such as \"[a]ll documents\n\nrelated to discussing how to perform Your obligations as an insurer\", \"[aJ11 documents by and\n\nbetween You and any other Person related to or discussing Your failure to comply with Texas\n\n\n24See Ex.

K Mart Corp., 937 S.W.2d at 431.             Although the scope of\n\ndiscovery is broad, requests must show a reasonable expectation of obtaining information that\n\nwill aid in the dispute's resolution. In re CSX Corp., 124 S.W.3d at 152. Because the trial court\n\nmay compel discovery only on matters that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending\n\naction, the burden to demonstrate that the requested information falls within the scope of\n\ndiscovery is on the party propounding the discovery. In re TIG Ins. Co., 172 S.W.3d 160, 167\n\n(Tex.App.-Beaumont 2005, no pet.).           Denbury has failed to meet its burden.       It appears\n\nDenbury is using its requests simply to explore. Discovery requests relating to other policies not\n\nat issue in Denbury' s petitions, other lawsuits filed by and against Iron shore , complaints received\n\nby Ironshore, and a complete list of Ironshore' s declaratory judgment lawsuits are overbroad and\n\nnot relevant to the subject litigation, and thus, are beyond the scope of discovery. Denbury's\n\nrequests would require a file-by-file search of the potentially responsive files.       Ironshore is\n\nrequesting this Court to sustain its objections to these requests because on their face they are\n\nimproper.\n\n    F. Denbury is Not Entitled to Ironshore's Investigation Materials\n\n        Only where a contract is first determined to be ambiguous may the courts consider the\n\nparties' interpretation, see Sun Oil Co. v. Madeley, 626 S.W.2d 726, 732 (Tex. 1981), and admit\n\nextraneous evidence to determine the true meaning of the instrument. See R & P Enterprises v.\n\nLaGuarta, Gavrel & Kirk, Inc., 596 S.W.2d 517, 518 (Tex. 1980). As with any contract, absent\n\n\n26ld.\n\n                                                  24\n\fa pleading of ambiguity, the courts will interpret the meaning and intent of an insurance policy\n\nfrom the four comers of the document without the aid of extrinsic evidence. Carrabba, 742\n\nS.W.2d at 716 (citing Houston Lighting & Power Co. v. Tenn-Tex Alloy & Chemical Corp., 400\n\nS.W.2d 296, 300 (Tex. 1966)). Unambiguous provisions cannot be varied by parol evidence of\n\nsurrounding circumstances or the parties' subjective intent. Id. The only relevant evidence is the\n\nactual policy. Id.\n\n        Denbury claims entitlement to an unredacted copy of the claim notes in this matter\n\nbecause it has asserted a bad faith claim against Ironshore in this lawsuit. Under Texas law, an\n\ninsurer's investigative files are not subject to discovery simply because an insured alleges bad\n\nfaith and breach of contract claims in the same action. See Maryland Am. Gen Ins. Co. v.\n\nBlackmon, 639 S.W.2d 455, 458 (Tex. 1982). There, as here, the plaintiff sued its insurer on\n\ntheories of breach of contract and bad faith (including violations of the Texas Insurance Code)\n\narising out of the insurer's denial of a third-party claim, and sought discovery of materials\n\nprepared by the insurance company in connection with its investigation and evaluation of the\n\nunderlying claim. See id. at 456. The insurer refused to produce the materials, citing Rule 186b\n\nof the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and the attorney-client privilege. 27 Id. The trial court\n\ngranted the plaintiffs motion to compel and ordered the insurer to produce all documents\n\nrequested by the plaintiff. Id. at 457. In a subsequent mandamus proceeding, the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt held the trial court abused its discretion by ordering the insurer to produce the materials in\n\nquestion. Id. The court determined the materials were privileged and reasoned that \"if a plaintiff\n\nattempting to prove the validity of a claim against an insurer could obtain the insurer's\n\ninvestigative files merely by alleging the insurer acted in bad faith, all insurance claims would\n\n27 Rule 193 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure embodies the subject matter of former 186b, which has been\n\nrepealed. See TEX.R.CIV.P. 186-189, comments.\n                                                    25\n\fcontain such allegations.\" [d. at 457-58. The court held an insurer is entitled to assert a privilege\n\nin response to actions for breach of contract and bad faith, so long as the insurer's liability on the\n\ncontract is undetermined. [d. at 458. Blackmon is on point because Ironshore's contractual\n\nliability has not been determined. Therefore, Ironshore is entitled to assert the attorney-client\n\nand work product privileges in response to Denbury's requests for information and documents\n\nregarding the investigation of Denbury' s claims. As such, Denbury is not entitled to unredacted\n\nclaim notes or claim files, and Denbury's motion in this regard should be denied.\n\n      G. Denbury is Not Entitled to Documents or Information Regarding Ironshore's\n         Handling of Other Claims or Other Policies\n\n           Denbury seeks a litany of documents unrelated to the facts of Denbury's claim or the\n\ncurrent litigation, and it relies on Aztec Life Ins. Co. of Texas v. Dellana, 667 S.W.2d 911\n\n(Tex.App.-Austin 1984, orig. proceeding) in support of its requests for discovery of other claim\n\nfiles from other claims; Denbury contends these would be germane to its bad faith claim. 28\n\nHowever, Aztec is easily distinguishable. There, the plaintiff's suit for breach of the insurance\n\ncontract was tried first and the district court rendered judgment for plaintiff upon a jury verdict.\n\nId. at 913. The district court specifically \"reserved the balance of [plaintift]'s [extra-contractual]\n\nclaims for separate trial at such time as discovery was complete.\" !d.          Accordingly, after a\n\ndetermination that plaintiff was entitled to insurance coverage, the court allowed discovery on\n\nplaintiff's bad faith, violation of the Texas Insurance Code, and punitive damages claims. Id. at\n\n913-14. Here, there has not been a determination of Ironshore's contractual liability to Denbury.\n\nThus, discovery of other claim files and other policies unrelated to Denbury is irrelevant and\n\nimproper at this time.\n\n\n\n28   Pis.' Memo. In Support of Mot. to Compel at p. 12.\n                                                          26\n\f          Also, Aztec involved a suit by a policyholder against an insurance company for an alleged\n\nbad faith denial of an insurance claim when the insurer had a duty of good faith and fair dealing.\n\nThe Third Court of Appeals ultimately allowed discovery of the defendant insurance company's\n\nfiles that related to claims that had been denied under the same pre-existing illness or condition\n\nunder which the plaintiff's claim had been denied specifically because the plaintiff pled that\n\nAztec's denial \"evidence[d] a common scheme and design on [Aztec's] part to avoid liability.\"\n\nld. at 913. The court's requirement of pleading the presence of a common scheme or design in a\n\nbad faith claim against an insurance company is directly stated in the court's holding: \"This\n\nCourt has concluded that Aztec should be ordered to produce those files ... in that those files may\n\nwell contain information relevant to [the plaintiff's] claim that Aztec was engaged in a course of\n\ndealing that was unfair or deceptive in the business of insurance.\" [d. at 915. \"[E]vidence ... that\n\nAztec had consistently denied claims upon the basis of the exclusion without reasonable\n\ninvestigation ... is generally admissible when the other acts are so closely connected with the act\n\ncharged so as to disclose a plan or scheme.\" [d. In contrast, Denbury has not pled that Ironshore\n\nwas involved in a bad faith common scheme or design that has caused Denbury injury. Instead,\n\nDenbury alleges that Ironshore failed to reasonably investigate Denbury' s claims for coverage. 29\n\n      H.

When a request is overly broad as a matter of law, the presentation of evidence is\n\nunnecessary to decide the matter. In re Am. Optical, 988 S.W.2d at 712. Requests must show a\n\nreasonable expectation of obtaining information that will aid in the dispute's resolution. In re\n\nCSX Corp., 124 S.W.3d at 152. Thus, discovery requests must be \"reasonably tailored\" to\n\ninclude only relevant matters. !d. As is self-evident, the requests are overly broad on their face;\n\nthey are not narrowly tailored to include only relevant matters. Because discovery is limited to\n\nmatters that are relevant to the case, requests for information that are not reasonably tailored as\n\nto time, place, or subject matter amount to impermissible \"fishing expeditions.\" See In re CSX\n\nCorp., 124 S.W.3d 149, 152 (Tex. 2003); Texaco, Inc. v. Sanderson, 898 S.W.2d 813, 815 (Tex.\n\n1995).\n\n         Further, as identified in the list of documents already produced above and as reflected in\n\nlronshore's amended privilege log, Ironshore has produced all relevant, non-privileged\n\ndocuments responsive to Denbury's requests. Accordingly, Denbury's motion to compel in this\n\nregard should be denied.\n\n    I. Ironshore's Claims Handling Procedures are Irrelevant to this Litigation and\n       Protected by Trade Secret Privilege\n\n         In Interrogatory Numbers 13 and 21; First Request for Production 4, 13, 14, 15, 19, 41,\n\n42 and 46; Second Request for Production 25-30, 43, 52, and 53; and Request for Admission 51\n\nDenbury seeks to obtain from Ironshore various documents and materials concerning the training\n\nof claim representatives and adjusters to handle claims and policy and procedure manuals for\n\nguidelines provided to claim representatives in insurance claims. Denbury has not satisfied its\n\nburden to show Ironshore's claim policies and procedures are relevant and reasonably necessary\n\nsuch that the Court should order production despite the trade secret status of the information\n\n\n                                                 29\n\fsought. 30 Moreover, Ironshore does not have guidelines which pertain ONLY to Denbury's\n\npolicy. Ironshore does have claim policies and guidelines which relate to all its policies, which\n\nfurther reinforces Ironshore's argument they should be protected.\n\n           Texas Rule of Evidence 507 establishes a qualified privilege allowing a person to refuse\n\nto disclose and to prevent others from disclosing trade secrets, provided the exercise of the\n\nprivilege will not tend to conceal fraud or otherwise work injustice. Trade secret issues are\n\ngoverned by state law. Aroson, 940 U.S. at 265-66. A trade secret is any formula, pattern, device\n\nor compilation of information which is used in one's business and presents an opportunity to\n\nobtain an advantage over competitors who do not know or use it. Computer Assocs. Int'l Inc.,\n\n918 S.W.2d at 455. When a party asserts trade secret privilege, the trial court must determine:\n\n(1) whether the information constitutes a trade secret, and (2) if so, the court must require the\n\nparty seeking production to show reasonable necessity for the requested materials. In re Union\n\nPacific R.R. Co., 294 S.W.3d at 591.\n\n           Ironshore's claim policies and procedures are trade secret. The information is not public\n\nknowledge and is not known outside of Iron shore , s business. 31 Ironshore considers the claim\n\npolicies and procedures to be confidential and proprietary.32 Courts routinely protect similar\n\ninformation. See e.g., Cohen v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., No. 00CV6112, 2003 WL 1563349\n\n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2003) (finding the \"Best Practices Manual\" and \"Claims Management\n\nGuidelines\" of the defendant insurance company were protected); Republic Services, Inc. v.\n\n\n\n30 See Lee Sheridan's Aff. attached hereto as Ex. 3, stating that lronshore's claim policies and procedures \"have\n\nbeen developed to provide Ironshore's clients with claims handling services\" and \"[i]f those materials were\ndisclosed in writing or by word of mouth to Ironshore's competitors, lronshore's competitive advantage over other\ninsurance companies, adjusting firms, and other third party administrators would be jeopardized.\"\n\n31   See Lee Sheridan's Aff. attached hereto as Ex. 3.\n32ld.\n\n                                                         30\n\fLiberty Mut. Ins. Companies, No. 03CV494, 2006 WL 1635655 (E.D. Ky. June 9, 2006)\n\n(protecting claims handling and training manuals); Adams v. Allstate Ins. Co., 189 F.R.D. 331\n\n(E.D. Pa. 1999) (company's claims manuals and training materials were to be kept confidential).\n\nDenbury must show a reasonable necessity for the claim policies and procedures in order to\n\njustify production. Denbury claims in its motion to compel that they may show how Ironshore\n\napplied the ambiguous policy provisions at issue and may provide guidance on how adjusters\n\nshould read the policy.33 However, as discussed in detail above, Denbury has not identified a\n\nsingly policy provision that it contends is ambiguous, nor has there been any finding of\n\nambiguity. Instead, Denbury has presented merely pretextual reasons for compelling production\n\nof Ironshore' s claims policies and procedures.\n\n           The Texas Supreme Court has repeatedly stated discovery requests must be reasonably\n\ntailored to include only matters relevant to the case. In re American Optical Corp., 988 S.W.2d\n\nat 713; see also Olinger v. Curry, 926 S.W.2d 832, 835 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth, orig.\n\nproceeding) (reiterating that discovery is limited to relevant matters).   Denbury asserts that\n\n\"Ironshore's claim manuals may provide guidance on how adjuster should read the Policy\" and\n\nthese \"resources may similarly contain infonnation resolving the Policy provisions Denbury\n\nalleges to be ambiguous such as lronshore's course of dealing related to the adjustment of claims\n\nunder similar policy forms or for similarly situated energy policyholders.,,34 However, again,\n\nIronshore's contractual liability has not been determined and Denbury has not asserted a single\n\nprovision to be ambiguous. Because Ironshore's claim policies and procedures are not relevant\n\nto the adjudication of the coverage issues in this lawsuit, and they are privileged, Ironshore\n\nshould not be compelled to produce its claim policies and procedures.\n\n33   PIs.'

Denbury's Other Requests\n\n        Denbury's First Request for Production 6 and Second Request for Production 56 are\n\nmoot because Ironshore has supplemented its responses and provided Denbury with an\n\norganizational chart of its property and casualty claims section. 35 Also, Interrogatory No.2 is\n\nmoot because Ironshore has supplemented its answer to provide the requested inforrnation. 36\n\nDenbury's requests for Iron shore , s advertisement and marketing materials for its Commercial\n\nExcess policies and policies for the Energy Market are wholly irrelevant to the subject litigation,\n\noverbroad, harassing, an impermissible fishing expedition, and not reasonably calculated to lead\n\nto the discovery of admissible evidence. 37 Denbury's Second Request for Production 36 seeks\n\n\"All documents related to or discussing Denbury's termination of Marsh.\"                           Despite being\n\nirrelevant, overly broad, failing to describe with reasonably particularity the item requested, and\n\nnot reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, Ironshore has indicated\n\nthat it has produced any relevant documents. 38\n\n     K. Ironshore's Discovery Objections are Valid and Are Not Obscured by Unfounded\n        Objections\n\n        Denbury complains that Ironshore's objections to various discovery requests should be\n\noverruled because its responses \"are obscured by Ironshore's unfettered reliance on unfounded\n\nobjections.\"39 On the contrary, the objections were specific and well..:founded in each case.

The following is a list of some of the objections at issue and\n\nsupport therefor:\n\n   (a) Not within scope of discovery - TEX.R.CIV.P. 192.3;\n\n   (b) Unduly burdensome, frivolous, oppressive and constitutes unnecessary harassment -\n       TEx.R.CIv.P. 192.4;\n\n   (c) Materialslinformation equally available/obtainable from some other source -\n       TEX.R.CIv.P. 192.4, Crown Central Petroleum Corp. v. Garcia, 904 S.W.2d 125 (Tex.\n       1995);\n\n    (d) Information is privileged and non-discoverable work product - TEx.R.CIv.P. 192.5;\n\n    (e) The discovery request constitutes nothing more than a \"fishing expedition\" - Loftin v.\n        Martin, 776 S.W.2d 145 (Tex. 1989);\n\n    (f) Said discovery request is overly broad - In re American Optical Corp., 988 S.W.2d 711\n       (Tex. 1998), see TEX.R.CIV.P. 192, cmt. 1;\n\n    (g) Request is vague, ambiguous and overbroad and fails to describe the item of which\n        discovery is requested with reasonable particularity - TEx.R.CIv.P. 196;\n\n    (h) Trade secret privilege - TEX.R.EvID. 507, In re Continental General Tire, Inc., 979\n        S.W.2d 609 (Tex. 1998).\n\n    (i) Attorney-client privilege - TEX.R.EvID. 503, In re XL Specialty Ins., 373 S.W.3d 46\n        (Tex. 2012); and\n\n    (j) Joint-defense privilege - TEX.R.EvID. 503(b).\n\nIronshore has properly complied with the applicable Rules of Civil Procedure and propounded\n\nproper and well-founded objections to the discovery requests. Thus, said objections should be\n\nconsidered by this Court.\n\n    L. Ironshore has Properly Asserted the Joint Defense Privilege (\"Allied Litigant\n       Privilege\") to the Joint Defense Agreement Between Defendants' Counsel\n\n        Denbury complains that Ironshore's privilege log and supplemental privilege log are\n\ninsufficient to establish that communications were made \"between a client, or the client's lawyer,\n\n\n                                                33\n\fto another party's lawyer, not the other party itself, and (2) the communication was made 'in the\n\ncontext of a pending action.\"'4o These complaints are now moot as on September 25, 2015,\n\nIronshore     served    Denbury      with    its   Amended       Privilege     Log     identifying privileged\n\ncorrespondence, including recipients and dates. 41 The privilege log identifies correspondence\n\nbetween defense counsel and their client, Ironshore, regarding the joint defense agreement\n\nbetween counsel for the other excess carriers.               Texas courts \"have generally applied Rule\n\n503(b)(1)(C) to joint defense situations where multiple defendants, represented by separate\n\ncounsel, work together in a common defense.\" In re XL Specialty Ins., 373 S.W.3d at 51; see\n\nalso In re Daleo, 186 S.W.3d 660, 666 (Tex.App.-Beaumont 2006, no pet.) (\"When applicable,\n\nthe joint defense privilege cloaks communications with confidentiality where a joint defense\n\neffort or strategy has been decided upon and undertaken by the parties and their respective\n\ncounseL\") .\n\n        Following AGLIC's reversal of its decision to deny coverage to Denbury, and while the\n\nvarious lawsuits against Denbury were pending, counsel for the excess carriers entered into a\n\nJoint Defense Agreement. This agreement and the correspondence related thereto are protected\n\nby the attorney-client and work product privileges. The allied-litigant privilege is an exception\n\nto the rule that disclosure of privileged information to third parties waives the privi1ege. 42 In re\n\nXL Specialty Ins., 373 S.W.3d at 50.\n\n        This Court should not limit the pending action requirement to this adversary proceeding.\n\nOtherwise counsel for allied counsel would be placed in the position of having to file a lawsuit\n\n\n40 PIs.' Memo. In Support of Mot. to Compel at 25.\n41 See Ironshore's Am. Privilege Log attached hereto as Exhibit 1.\n42 In In re XL Specialty, 373 S.W.3d at 50,52, the Texas Supreme Court stated that although the privilege defined in\nTEX.R.EvID. 503(b)(l)(C) has been called many things by the courts - the \"joint-client\" privilege, the \"joint-\ndefense\" privilege, and the \"common-interest\" privilege - it is most accurately described as the \"allied-litigant\nprivilege.\"\n                                                        34\n\fagainst Denbury first without having the privilege protection of communications with allied\n\ncounsel as to the underlying facts and potential strengths and weaknesses of any actions. Indeed,\n\nactions relative to this lawsuit were pending. On October 14, 2014, Denbury filed its first\n\nlawsuit against Ironshore and the other Excess Carriers in this matter in Denbury Resources Inc.,\n\net al. v. Ironshore Specialty Insurance Co., et ai., Cause No. 2014-59947, 157th Judicial District\n\nCourt of Harris County, Texas. 43\n\n     M. Denbury's Request for Sanctions is Unjustified and Improper\n\n        In its memorandum in support of its motion to compel, Denbury requests sanctions\n\nagainst Ironshore. 44 However, pursuant to Judge Randy Wilson's court procedures, \"[s]anctions\n\nshould not be requested unless the opponent has violated a previous order.\" No such order\n\npertaining the relevant discovery issues in this matter has been entered. Accordingly, a request\n\nfor sanctions is not appropriate. Further, as detailed above, Ironshore is substantially justified in\n\nraising its tailored objections and privileges to Denbury's overbroad, irrelevant discovery\n\nrequests that are not narrowly tailored to seek the discovery of non-privileged documents.\n\n     N. Ironshore's Objections to Certain Corporate Representative Deposition Topics\n        Listed in Denbury's Deposition Notices for Ironshore and FARA Should be\n        Sustained\n\n        Ironshore incorporates fully herein its objections stated in its Motion for Protective Order\n\nto Plaintiffs' Deposition of Sanford Oster as the Designated Corporate Representative of\n\nIronshore and in its Motion for Protective Order to Plaintiffs' Deposition of the Designated\n\nCorporate Representative of FARA, attached hereto as Exhibits 5 and 6, respectively. For the\n\n\n\n\n43 A copy of the docket sheet, Denbury's Petition and civil process request for Denbury Resources Inc., et al. v.\nIronshore Specialty Insurance Co., et at., Cause No. 2014-59947, in the 157th Iudicial District Court of Harris\nCounty, Texas is attached hereto as Exhibit 4, for the Court's ease of reference.\n44 PIs.'

Denbury's Interrogatory Nos. 10 - 21 Exceed the Number of Interrogatories,\n        Including Subparts, Allowed by the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure\n\n        Denbury's Interrogatory Nos. 10 - 21 violate Rule 190 and 197 of the Texas Rules of\n\nCivil Procedure in that the number of interrogatories, including subparts, exceeds twenty-five\n\n(25), and this objection was asserted in response to these Interrogatories. 45 Rule 190.3 allows for\n\ntwenty-five (25) interrogatories and then specifies \"[e]ach discreet subpart of an interrogatory is\n\nconsidered a separate interrogatory.\" TEX.R.CIV.P. 190.3(b)(3).                     Including the subparts of\n\nDenbury's Interrogatories, Denbury has served more than twenty-five Interrogatories.\n\nAccordingly, Ironshore's objections to these Interrogatories should be sustained.\n\n        WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Defendant Ironshore Specialty Insurance\n\nCompany requests that the Court sustain its objections, deny Plaintiffs' motion to compel, and\n\nprovide such other and further relief to which Ironshore Specialty Insurance Company may be\n\nentitled.\n\n\n\n\n                           [SIGNATURE BLOCK ON FOLLOWING PAGE]\n\n\n\n\n45See Ironshore's Objections and Answers to DenbUly's First Set of Interrogatories attached as Ex.

In their current live pleading, Plaintiffs\n\nDenbury Resources Inc. and Denbury Onshore, LLC (hereinafter \"Plaintiffs\" or \"Denbury\")\n\nassert they selected umbrella insurance policies, based on insurance broker Marsh USA, Inc. 's\n\n                                               EXHIBIT\n\n\n\n                                   (\n\frecommendations, to cover such losses as those Denbury experienced as a result of the well\n\nblowout in northeastern Louisiana, known as the Delhi Incident. Plaintiffs seek a declaratory\n\njudgment that Ironshore, Alterra Excess & Surplus Insurance Company, and AXIS Surplus\n\nInsurance Company must indemnify Denbury for costs and expenses, not recoverable under the\n\nwell control policy, and in excess of the underlying policies that Denbury incurred in responding\n\nto the pollution resulting from the Delhi Incident.

That being said, Denbury has provided you, and all the upper layer excess carriers, with\ndetailed documentation of its costs incuned and claimed under not only the Ironshore Policy, but\nthose policies which sit above Ironshore's Policy in Denbury's excess liability tower. On July 7,\n2014, Denbury provided Iro11shore, and its other extess carriers, with detailed spreadsheets\nsummarizing all oftlle costs Denbury claims for clean-up oftlle pollution event arising out of the\nblowout. Attached to those spreadsheets were all of the invoices and proof of payment for each\nvendor paid by Denbury during the course of the clean-up operations. Denbury believes no\nfurther itemization ofthe costs it incuned and is claiming under the lronshore Policy is needed to\nsubstantiate its policy limit claim.\n\n\n\n                                                      EXHIBIT\n                        ENERGY CENTRE· 110\n                                     TELEI'110N   I                   • NEW ORLEANS.

Rather, Denbury\n         is making claim against Iron shore for all of the costs Denbury incurred in cleaning up the\n         pollution from the 220-2 blowout, and for resolving the claims of third parties. That being said,\n         Denbury is aware of the recent ruling of the United States Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in the\n         Pioneer v. Steadfast matter. As we pointed out in our meeting with you and representatives of the\n         other excess caniers, Denbury believes that both the Fifth Circuit and District Court opinions are\n         incorrect Erie guesses of Texas law with regard to the issue of whether the Zurich umbrella\n         policy provides coverage to Denbury for pollution costs incurred on property it does 110t occupy\n         within its mineral leases. For example, the recent Fifth Circuit opinion fails to even acknowledge\n         the fact that it is interpreting an exclusion in the policy at issue. Under Texas law, exclusionary\n         language is to be strictly constmed, and in favor of coverage, The Fifth Circuit's holding that the\n         use of the word \"occupied\" in an exclusion precludes coverage for vast expanses of land over\n         which an insured only has a \"light to occupy\" flies in the face of Texas insurance jurisprudence\n          interpreting exclusionary language, Moreover, at least one of the calTiers which is cUlTently\n          providing oilfield operator pollution liability coverage under similar tenTIS and conditions to that\n          as were found in the Zurich policy has modified its policies to repudiate the Pioneer and Aspen\n          decisions, The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals did not have before it evidence of the intent of the\n          parties to these insuring agreements. Denbury believes that such evidence of intent will be very\n          persuasive to Texas courts deciding this issue.\n\n                 In a nutshell, to Denbury, the \"on lease\" versus \"off lease\" distinction of damages is\n         immaterial for the claim it is making against Ironshore. To the extent that distinction does\n         become material at some point in the future, Denbury expects Ironshore to follow the Jead of\n         Zmich in its detem1inution of \"off lease\" clean-up costs, In this regard, Denbury did not, during\n         the clean-up, develop separate AFEs or any other cost accounting basis for segregating clean-up\n         oflands on the lease or off the lease and on the right-of-way. That distinction was immaterial to\n         Denbury in its efforts to fulfill its obligations to deal with the pollution that. arose from the event.\n         Thus, there is no practical way for Denbury to provide you with the documents requested in\n         requests 9, 11, 12, 13 and 14.\n\n'1\"\nf')              We now address each of your fifty-two requests for documents individually:\nVI\n00\nVI\nN\n[--'\n\\0\n          L Attached as DRI-SD-3609-5007,\n ;...:\n Cl)\n..0\nE        2.

Texas law\n\nprohibits this? Further, Ironshore has the burden of proving its objections and asserted\n\nprivileges. Ironshore cites no law, provides no facts, and attaches only self-serving, conclusory\n\naffidavits. 3 Its motions should be denied.\n\n         Additionally, and as fully articulated m Denbury's Motion to Compel, Ironshore's\n\n\n\n\n1 Ironshore filed two separate Motions for Protective Order. One for the Ironshore corporate notice and one for the\nFARA corporate notice. Denbury files this combined response for purposes of judicial efficiency. FARA is the\nthird-party claims administrator for lronshore and under lronshore's control for all purposes IDlder applicable Texas\nrules.\n2 See Tex. R. Civ. P. 192.3(a); see also Ford Motor Co. v. Castillo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895102\"><a href=\"/opinion/895102/ford-motor-co-v-castillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">279</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">656</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 664 (Tex. 2009) (\"The phrase\n'relevant to the subject matter' is to be 'liberally construed to allow the litigants to obtain the fullest knowledge of\nthe facts and issues prior to trial.\"') (internal citations omitted).\n3 Denbury had requested Ironshore provided it with a Rille 193.3(b) compliant privilege log for its discovery\nresponses since, at least, August 5, 2015. Ironshore refused to do so for over 45 days. Now, in response to\nDenbury's motion to compel, lronshore has produced the third iteration of its privilege log, an \"Amended Privilege\nLog,\" dated September 25,2015, attached hereto as Exhibit T.\n\n                                                           1\n\fobjections and asserted privileges are unfounded. 4 This is an insurance coverage lawsuit between\n\nDenbury and its excess insurers. The crux of this coverage dispute is whether the parties intended\n\nto cover damages to third-party property that Denbury leases in its oil and gas operations.\n\nDenbury's position is that it does. The Umbrella policy's blended pollution endorsement was\n\nspecifically added to provide this coverage. 5 AGUe's $25 million payment suggests Denbury's\n\ninterpretation reflects the parties' actual intent when the policies issued. Ironshore's position is\n\nthat its follow-form policy excludes this coverage. 6\n\n           Relevant to this discovery dispute, Denbury seeks a declaratory judgment that the\n\nIronshore Policy provides coverage. Denbury requests damages for lronshore's breach of\n\ncontract, bad faith, and unfair trade practices. Denbury also alleges that certain terms and\n\nconditions of Denbury's policies are ambiguous and/or provide illusory coverage. Denbury's\n\ndeposition notices seek basic information relevant to these allegations. 7 While Denbury's notices\n\nare exhaustive, 8 the number of topics is driven entirely by Ironshore's refusal to provide\n\n\n\n4             .\n  See Tex.

Pet., filed of record June 9, 2015. Denbmy also alleges that lronshore's marketing of the policy to oil and\ngas operators (and then denial because portions of the damaged property are subject to mineral leases) constitutes an\nunfair trade practice. Id. at CJI'lJ.98-1 04. Texas courts have allowed discovery of extrinsic materials in the interpretation\nof a breach of contract claim. See, e.g., Ford Motor Co. v. Castillo, 279 S.W.3d at 663 (Tex. 2009) (internal citations\nomitted) (\"Like any other breach of contract claim, a claim for breach of settlement agreement is subject to\nestablished procedures ofpleading and proof. .. \"it cannot be determined without \"full resolution of the surrounding\nfacts and circumstances.\"); see also id. at 664 (\" ... a party is not required to demonstrate the viability of defenses\nbefore it is entitled to conduct discovery.\"). Here too, the allegations of Denbmy's well-pled claims are sufficient to\ntrigger the discoverability of materials and testimony responsive to Denbury's tailored requests.\n8 See Denbmy's Notice of Corporate Dep. to lronshore, attached hereto as Exhibit P; see also Denbmy's Notice of\nCorporate Dep. to FARA, attached hereto as Exhibit Q.

IronshorelFARA's adjustment of Denbury's Claim; 18\n\n        2. Denbury's Policies, including the underwriting of the policies at issue;19 and\n\n        3.

Conclusion\n\n        Denbury has a limited amount of time to conduct these depositions. It does not intend to\n\nwaste resources on irrelevant or duplicative testimony.

Denbury is also allowed to discover Ironshore's\n\ntreatment, and payment, of analogous claims for on-lease damages by similarly situated oil and\n\ngas policyholders conducting operations on leased property - policyholders to which Ironshore\n\nmarkets the policy at issue. Ironshore fails to prove any privilege sufficient to strike Denbury's\n\nareas of inquiry.

Large release of carbon-dioxide is a by\n         product of the process at the source used to extract oil and bitumen (a sludgy\n         form of petroleum) from the earth. Formal responsibilities for the South Delhi\n         Field, LA Incident were transferred from TransCanada Pipeline to Denbury Onshore,\n         LLC.\n\n         The cause of the spill has not yet been determined.

Although I have attached a formal\nreport, below are just the highlights.\n\n\n\nBackground:\n\nDenbury Resources Inc. is an independent oil and natural gas company, whose\nprimary emphasis is on carbon dioxide (GC02u) enhanced oil recovery (GEORu) and\nthe redevelopment of older, depleted oil fields to recover stranded reserves of\noil that cannot otherwise be recovered by conventional methods. This is an\nextensive oil spill submitted by Denbury in which they claim cleanup costs nearly\n$40mm, (the figures have varied widely). It appears that a well policy may be\npaying as Denbury is not asking payment for the time being. As we previously\ndiscussed it may be that third party claims, if presented, may not be covered\nunder the Denbury well policy issued through Lloyds, but for now, no-one is\npressing a third party claim that we know of.\n\n\n\nPolicy general info:\n\nAs you may recall, Ironshore sits above 26mm in excess an underlying (issued by\nZurich-attached). Ironshore also follows form to the Zurich excess policy. I have\nreceived Zurich's coverage letter dated July 9, 2013, (attached) and I have spoken\nwith Carrie Von Hoff, the adjuster who penned the letter. As of today, 12/12/2013,\nZurich's coverage denial remains, largely based on the time element pollution\nendorsement. Zurich is taking the position that this loss was not sudden, but\nrather due to a failure in the GZaplocku system which leaked over a significant\nperiod of time. Zurich has retained Vertex Engineering to inspect the system\nonsite; however, they are not expecting the engineer's report until January, and\nwill advise if there is any change to their July 2013 declination.\n\n\n\nClarification as to claims:\n\nYou will notice in Zurich's coverage letter that there were three incidents in the\nDelhi Field, in Ascension Parish, Louisiana. It appears that Denbury may have\nagreed with Zurich's position on this and therefore since the July 2013\ndisclaimer, Denbury has withdrawn the first two claims as. The third is the\nlargest and the subject of this file.\n\n\n\n1.) Denbury discovered a leak at Delhi test site # 4 on March 20, 2013, which was\ncaused by the failure of a GZaplocku connection. Approximately 75 barrels of\nsaltwater and 2 barrels of oil were released into the right of way and adjoining\nproperty. Cleanup is under $200,000. (This claim has no been withdrawn).\n\n\n\n2.) On March 26, 2013, Denburyus foreman was notified of a leak at DFU 125-1. A\nlandowner reported an undetermined amount of saltwater on his property, caused by\na GZaplocku flow line failure. Expenses are approximately $1.5 million. (This\nclaim has been withdrawn).\n\n\n\n3.) On June 14, 2013, Denbury received a call that C02, saltwater and oil were\npresent on the TransCanada right of way, which is an indicator that there was a\nleak. Fluid containment and recovery continued at least until June 25, 2013.    (We\nhave been updated by Lockton, the new broker, who took the account over from\nMarsh, and they suggest that the cleanup costs total approximately $49 million,\nand source control efforts to stop the flow was $16 million. Denbury is\nevaluating other possible expenses as part of the claim and anticipate third party\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                      FARA004048\n\f       claims from TransCanada and possibly others, but to date we know of none.)\n\n\n\n       Recommendations:\n\n       Since Ironshore follows form to the Zurich excess policy, and a disclaimer has\n       been issued by Zurich, Ironshore may also follow the same terms as outlined by\n       Zurich. At this time no underlying carrier has tendered the matter, therefore\n       since Zurich has issued the denial, no response is currently pending from\n       Ironshore, unless you see some other reason to respond. We will follow with Carrie\n       Von Hoff of Zurich to see once their engineer constructs a report, if it may\n       change their coverage position. On June 18, 2013, Fara, on behalf of Ironshore,\n       acknowledged the claim to Denbury and expressly reserved all rights under the\n       Ironshore policy. Denbury had a response team in place and provided reports to all\n       carriers of their efforts and exposure. Initial discussions with Denbury Martha\n       Balogh- Risk Management Specialist Denbury Resources Inc., indicated that Denbury\n       will be responsible for this loss; however, we suggest that there remains much\n       investigation that is necessary before this matter can be fully evaluated, as such\n       we will be following with Denbury, Marsh and Zurich to determine the cause and see\n       if ZurichUs denial will be challenged.\n\n\n\n       Reserves:\n\n\n\n\n        MaryAnn Matthiessen\n       Senior Environmental Adjuster\n\n       609.618.4497 office\n       866.575.3192 toll free\n       985.624.8684 fax\n       MaryAnn.Matthiessen@Fara.com\n\n       FARA, A York Risk Services Company\n       1625 West Causeway Approach\n       Mandeville, LA 70471\n       </xmp>\n\n\n\n       Date     12/12/2813           Type: General\n       By       Mary Ann Matthiessen\n       Subject: TC with Carrie Von Hoff of Zurich\n\n       <xmp>Today I placed a call to Carrie Von Hoff who is the adjuster for Zurich.\n       Environmental Claims Specialist Carrie.von.hoff@zurichna.com\n       847-413-5465.\n\n\n       She is handling the claim on the primary layer and the initial excess for Zurich,\n       in which Ironshore's excess policy follows form.\n       I spoke with her in detail about her disclaimer, and she advised that at this time\n       Zurich's disclaimer of coverage remains) based on the time element pollution\n       endorsement that this event was not sudden nor accidental.\n       She has sent an engineering firm to the site and if they find anything different,\n       she will re-evaluate her coveage poisiton) but for now it remains.\n       I advised that I probably would check back with her in January 2814, as she did\n       not expect a report from her engineer prior to then.\n\n..-o   They are looking at a failure in the zaplock system which has caused multiple\n       leaks all along this same South Delhi field line.</xmp>\nr--\no\n       Date     12/12/2813           Type: General\n       By       Mary Ann Matthiessen\n       Subject: Reserves as of 12/12/13\n\n       <xmp>Reserves as of 12/12/21313\n\n\n\n\n       Claim Id:                               39271345\n\n       Claimant:                               South Delhi Field, LA Spill\n\n       Accident Date:                          06/14/2013\n\n       Description:                            Excess Claim Insured had a spill of C02,\n\n       Line Of Coverage:                       Commercial Excess Liability (Umbrella) I\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                            FARA004049\n\f      Sub Line:                                Liability - Property Damage\n\n                      111\n      Reserved: • • • •\n\n      Status:\n\n\n\n\n      </xmp>\n\n\n\n      Date     12/12/2013           Type: General\n      By       Mary Ann Matthiessen\n      Subject: EM from Jeff HIggins -Lockton- Zurich's disclaimer\n\n      <xmp>From: Higgins, Jeff [mailto:JHiggins@lockton.com]\n      Sent: Mon 11/25/2013 5:23 PM\n      To: Matthiessen, MaryAnn\n4-;\n      Cc: 'Martha Balogh'\no     Subject: Insured: Denbury Resources, Inc. - Matter: South Delhi Field, LA Spill -\n00    D/A: 6/14/13 Claim Number: FARA 3927045\no\n\n      Insured: Denbury Resources\n\n      Ironshore Specialty Insurance Company/FARA\n      Adjuster:                     Mary Ann Matthiessen\n      Claim Number:          FARA 3927045\n\n      Starr Surplus Lines Insurance Company/FARA\n      Claim Number:          FARA 3927048\n\n      MaryAnn,\n\n      Per your request, attached is the Zurich coverage letter pertaining to the Delhi\n      release~   We are working with Carrie now to resolve the reservations and coverage\n      questions she raised.

This excess layer would apply only after\n$25,000,000 of primary and underlying insurance has been exhausted. As we\ndiscussed previously, the Zurich policy # AUC 9242673-01 is the controlling policy\nform to which the Ironshore policy follows form and we are awaiting Zurich's\ncoverage opinion.\n\nIt also appears that Denbury had an additional well policy issued by Lloyds, that\nmay have afforded coverage for the remediation of this loss, we are concerned\nbecause we see the costs projected near $80,000,000 for the remediation and want\nto be certain that Denbury understands the position of the underlying carrier.\nPlease advise if Denbury has pressed Zurich for reimbursement of remediation\ncosts.\n\nFinally, You had been waiting for approval to issue me a copy of Zurich's coverage\nopinion, at this time we again renew our request for Zurich's coverage opinion\nissued to Denbury.\n\n\n    Thank you,\nMaryAnn Matthiessen\nSenior Environmental Adjuster\n\n609.610.4497 office\n866.675.3192 toll free\n985.624.8684 fax\nMaryAnn.Matthiessen@Fara.com\n\nFARA, A York Risk Services Company\n1625 West Causeway Approach\nMandeville, LA 70471\n\n\n\nFrom: Carrie Von Hoff [mailto:carrie.von.hoff@zurichna.com]\nSent: Fri 10/11/2013 1:49 PM\nTo: Martha.Balogh@denbury.com\nCc: Matthiessen, MaryAnn; Richard Burgess; Higgins, Jeff\nSubject: Re: FW: South Delhi Field Incident - Cost Tracking Spreadsheet\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                     FARA004055\n\fHi Martha,\n\nNot at this point.

Formal responsibilities for the South Delhi\nField, LA Incident were transferred from TransCanada Pipeline to Denbury Onshore,\nLLC.\n\nThe cause of the spill has not yet been determined. At this time there does not\nappear to be any other parties involved aside from Denbury, who is the operator of\na oil well located in northeast Louisiana. The property is leased from private\nowners and is private property.\n\nMs. Dawn Williams Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality briefed personnel\nthat 17 residences had been evacuated on 6/13/21313, '(indicates prior to the June\n14, date of loss as reported), which included 34 residents, (17 residences remain\nevacuated). Richland and Franklin Parish off-duty Sherriffus deputies secured the\nscene, and road closures were active on Antley Road and Highway 132 in the region.\n\nAn initial air monitoring team was sent to Test Site 1 and all well location\nadjacent to the release   and determined that the site was safe to access\n\nENVIRONMENTAL\nUSES personnel are monitoring chloride levels in Swamp Slough.\n\nRECOVERY & CONTAINMENT\nUSES and Hancock personnel recovered~ and will continue to recover, fluids from\nthe Swamp Slough at Burke Road Bridge using vacuum trucks.\nAll recovered liquids are being placed in See-barrel frac tanks for temporary\nstorage.\n\n\n\nKey contacts:\nOn 7/8/21313 at 11:15am I contacted Ms. Martha Balogh- Risk Management Specialist\nDenbury Resources Inc.\n53213 Legacy Drive\nPlano, Texas 751324\nOffice: 972-673-21376 (number called)\nCell: 469-693-1132\nEmail: martha.balogh@denbury.com\n</xmp>\n\n\n\nDate     138/136/21313        Type: General\nBy       Mary Ann Matthiessen\nSubject: TC with Sandy Oster\n\n<xmp>Updated Sandy Oster of Ironshore on the status of this claim, it appears that\nthe well carrier- Lloyds will pick up the remediation of the spill, while Zurich\nhas disclaimed as the primary underlying.\nI am awaiting a copy of Zurich's coverage evaluation, Sandy advised that if\nZurich's disclaimer is straighforward then we might be able to send a simple \"me\ntoo\" coverage letter to Denbury.\nAwaiting a copy of Zurich's letter.</xmp>\n\n\n\nDate     138/136/21313        Type: General\nBy       Mary Ann Matthiessen\nSubject: EM to Carrie Von Hoff of Zurich underlying\n\n<xmp>From: Matthiessen, MaryAnn\nSent: Tue 8/6/21313 11:133 AM\nTo: Carrie Von Hoff\nSubject: RE: Denbury Resources, Inc. - Matter: South Delhi Field, LA Spill - D/A:\n6/14/13 - FARA 39271345\n\n\nHi Carrie,\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                     FARA004059\n\f         Any word on getting Ironshore a copy of your coverage evaluation?\n\n         MaryAnn Matthiessen\n         Senior Environmental Adjuster\n\n         609.610.4497 office\n         866.675.3192 toll free\n         985.624.8684 fax\n         MaryAnn.Matthiessen@Fara.com\n\n         FARA, A York Risk Services Company\n         1625 West Causeway Approach\n         Mandeville, LA 70471\n\n\n\n         From: Matthiessen, MaryAnn\n         Sent: Mon 7/22/2e13 1e:22 AM\n         To: Carrie Von Hoff\n         Subject: RE: Denbury Resources, Inc. - Matter: South Delhi Field, LA Spill - D/A:\n         6/14/13 - FARA 3927e45\n\n\n         Thank you Carrie.\n\n         MaryAnn Matthiessen\n         Senior Environmental Adjuster\n\n         6e9.61e.4497 office\n         866.675.3192 toll free\n         985.624.8684 fax\n         MaryAnn.Matthiessen@Fara.com\n\n         FARA, A York Risk Services Company\n         1625 West Causeway Approach\n         Mandeville, LA 7e471\n\n\n\n         From: Carrie Von Hoff [mailto:carrie.von.hoff@zurichna.com]\n         Sent: Mon 7/22/2e13 9:57 AM\n         To: Matthiessen, MaryAnn\n         Subject: Re: Denbury Resources, Inc. - Matter: South Delhi Field, LA Spill - D/A:\n         6/14/13 - FARA 3927045\n\n\n         Good morning J   MaryAnn~\n\n\n         Just wanted to let you know I am still waiting for Denbury's approval.

I will press Zurich for this information. I am waiting on\n      the name of their adjuster.\n\n      I think maybe we should wait to see Zurich's position and interpretation of the\n      policy.

Denbury has a\nresponse team in place and provides weekly reports to all carriers of their\nefforts and exposure.

This letter will acknowledge report of a June 16, 2013\n      spill incident in SOUTH DELHI FIELD, LA involving Denbury Resources Inc .. FARA\n      has set up a file for record purposesand given this a record locator number of\n      FARA-3927045.\n\n      Effective for the term of April 1, 2013 to April 1, 2014, Ironshore provides\n      Denbury Resources Inc., under policy number 000988602 , with excess liability\n      coverage in the amount of $25,000,000. This excess layer would apply only after\n      $25,000,000 of primary and underlying insurance has been exhausted.\n\n      Based on the exposure information supplied to date, it appears unlikely that the\n4-<\n      Ironshore policy will be implicated in this matter, and as such we are recording\no     this information for notice only. However, we understand that this matter recently\no     occurred and that claim development may be necessary to estimate the full value of\n\"1-   the potential losses; therefore, we would request that you notify us immediately\n.-<\n      if there are any adverse developments. We would also request that we be notified\n      if the insurance layer beneath the Ironshore layer values the claim in excess of\n      50% of their underlying limit. If this is an aggregate policy, we request that you\n      advise if the aggregate has a potential to breach the underlying limit.\n\n      Because it appears that the exposure will not reach the Ironshore layer at this\n      time, we have not evaluated coverage as it relates to these matters; therefore,\n      Ironshore expressly reserves all rights under the policy. Any failure to cite\n      policy conditions or exclusions at this time shall not preclude Ironshore from\n      citing other policy conditions or exclusions as may be applicable to this claim.\n        Should you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.\n\n\n      Sincerely)\n      MaryAnn Matthiessen\n      Sr. Environmental Adjuster\n      FARA, A York Risk Services Company\n      1625 West Causeway Approach\n      Mandeville, LA 70471\n      direct: 609-610-4497\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                           FARA004082\n\ffax: 985-624-8684\ntoll free:866-675-3192\nMaryAnn.Matthiessen@fara.com\n\n\n</xmp>\n\n\n\nDate     06/18/2013           Type: Initial Contact - Insured\nBy       Mary Ann Matthiessen\nSubject: Initial Contact With Insured\n\n<xmp>Claim was ack. to Denbury timely on 6/18/2013.\nFile to be closed\n</xmp>\n\n\n\nDate     06/18/2013           Type: Initial Contact - Claimant\nBy       Mary Ann Matthiessen\nSubject: Initial Contact With Claimant\n\n<xmp>High level excess coverage, not expected to breach carriers layer, contact\nwaived.</xmp>\n\n\n\nDate     06/18/2913           Type: Coverage\nBy       Mary Ann Matthiessen\nSubject: IRONSHORE SPECIALTY - 25mm xs of 25mm\n\n<xmp>Policy # 909988602\nIRONSHORE SPECIALTY INSURANCE CO\nEffective 04/01/2913 - 04/01/2014\n$25,090,000 xis $25,000,000\n\ncontrolling policy:\nGL09242578-01 ZURICH AMERICAN INS CO- $500k policy primary\n\nAUC 9242673-01 -AMERICAN GUAR & LIAB     94/01/2913 - 04/91/2914$25,099,000 xis of\nUnderlying\n\nIronshore is next $25mm excess of $25mm.</xmp>\n\n\n\nDate     06/18/2013           Type: General\nBy       Mary Ann Matthiessen\nSubject: Response to Supervisor\n\n<xmp>Ron.,\nAck. new loss for Denbury I will handle accordingly.</xmp>\n\n\n\nDate     06/18/2013            Type: Supervisory Claim Review\nBy       Ronnie Ronzello\nSubject: Supervisory Review\n\n<xmp>MaryAnn,\nNew loss.

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n       This is an insurance coverage dispute arising out of a well blowout that occurred in\n\nnortheastern Louisiana.    Plaintiffs Denbury Resources Inc. and Denbury Onshore, LLC\n\n(hereinafter collectively \"Plaintiffs\" or \"Denbury\") seek a declaratory judgment that Defendants\n\nmust indemnify Denbury for costs and expenses, not recoverable under the well control policy,\n\nand in excess of the underlying policies that Denbury incurred in responding to pollution\n\nresulting from the blowout. In the span of less than three months, with a flurry of discovery\n\nrequests, Plaintiffs have served Ironshore with over 207 discovery requests and submitted 264\n\fcorporate representative deposition topics of inquiry, of which most seek privileged, irrelevant\n\ninformation, in not merely an impermissible attempt to go on a fishing expedition, but rather, in\n\nan effort to dredge the lake in hopes of finding a fish. Despite Ironshore's timely responses, its\n\nproduction of over 3,000 pages of documents, its repeated supplementation of discovery\n\nresponses and production of a privilege log, supplemental privilege log and amended privilege\n\nlog, Plaintiffs continue to seek unfettered access to not only the claim file in this matter, and\n\nother unrelated matters as well, but apparently also seek to be allowed to generally peruse all\n\nevidence Ironshore may have regardless of privilege or relevancy. Plaintiffs seek irrelevant\n\ndiscovery beyond the policy language contained within the policies in an attempt to create\n\nambiguity, despite a recent United States Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals decision holding the\n\npolicy language at issue to be clear and unambiguous.       Further, Ironshore's liability on the\n\ncontract is undetermined; thus, Denbury's alleged requests to support its bad faith and claim\n\nmishandling claims are improper at this time.\n\n       Plaintiffs complain that Ironshore's production and responses are insufficient. To the\n\ncontrary, after participating in a discovery conference that lasted over three (3) hours to try to\n\nresolve the issues raised by Denbury, Ironshore has produced all of its relevant, responsive, non-\n\nprivileged documents as required by the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.            Consequently,\n\nPlaintiffs' Motion should be denied.\n\n                                   II. BACKGROUND FACTS\n\n       Denbury is an oil and gas operator who has mineral leases in the Delhi Field in north\n\nLouisiana and in other states, including Texas. In June 2013, under its mineral leases, Denbury\n\nwas performing enhanced oil recovery operations (\"EaR\") in the Delhi field, which is within\n\nDenbury's Holt-Bryant Unit, which involved injecting C02 through injection wells into the\n\n                                                 2\n\fformation under pressure and producing oil from production wells located in the field. As part of\n\nits operations, Denbury had numerous wells in the Delhi field and various surface installations to\n\nsupport its oil and gas operations.\n\n       On June 13,2013, during an inspection of the Delhi field, Denbury discovered reservoir\n\nfluids on the surface of the land in the vicinity of a pipeline right of way (\"ROW\") that runs\n\nthrough the Delhi field, where Denbury was performing its EOR operations. Upon investigation,\n\nDenbury discovered a plugged and abandoned well inside the Delhi Field, the Sun 220-2 well,\n\nhad blown out during its EOR operations in early June 2013 resulting in an uncontrolled release\n\nof reservoir fluids from the well. Denbury subsequently responded to the incident by drilling a\n\nwell to intercept and stop the flow of fluids from the Sun 220-2 well, after which Denbury began\n\ncleaning up the surface pollution in the Delhi field.\n\n        Although discovery has just begun in this matter, the evidence will show that on April 1,\n\n2013 when Denbury' s insurance came up for renewal, Denbury elected not to purchase insurance\n\ncoverage for well control or for pollution coverage for plugged and abandoned wells, or\n\ncommercial pollution liability insurance.       These insurance policies would have provided\n\ninsurance coverage for the costs Denbury incurred to regain control of the Sun 220-2 well, to\n\nclean up pollution in the Delhi field from the well, and for any damage to the land comprising\n\nthe Delhi field that resulted from the blowout. Now, as a result of Denbury' s failure to obtain\n\nthe proper insurance coverage to respond to this incident, Denbury seeks recovery of its clean-up\n\nand remediation expenses, and recovery for damage to the land comprising its Delhi field from\n\nits commercial general liability insurers, including Iron shore, whose policies clearly and\n\nunambiguously exclude coverage for damage to property Denbury owns, rents or occupies and\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\fwhich unambiguously exclude coverage for cleaning up pollution on land that Denbury owns,\n\nrents or occupies.\n\n       As with any major incident, Denbury put all of its insurance carriers on notice, including\n\nlayers not implicated by the event. Initially, the first excess layer, AGLIC, denied coverage for\n\nDenbury's claim under its policy. But on October 6, 2014, AGLIC tendered its $25 million\n\npolicy limit to Denbury, in payment of three claims, including a $9,900,000.00 settlement\n\nDenbury entered into without Ironshore's knowledge or consent with Loutre Land and Timber\n\nCompany (\"Loutre\") for damage to land that appears to be located within the Delhi field; an\n\n$8,755,139 settlement Denbury entered into without Ironshore's knowledge or consent with\n\nANR Pipeline Company for alleged damage to an ANR pipeline located in the ROW that runs\n\nthrough Denbury's Delhi field; and for $6,344,861 in cleanup and remediation costs on property\n\nthat Denbury characterized as being outside of its Delhi fieldlHolt-Bryant Unit, but which\n\nDenbury admits includes the ROW that runs through the Delhi field.\n\n        On September 22,2014, shortly before AGLIC tendered its policy limits to Denbury, the\n\nUnited States Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a decision in Pioneer Exploration, L.L.C. v.\n\nSteadfast Co., 767 FJd 503 (5th Cir. 2014), which considered the same property damage\n\nexclusion and Blended Pollution Endorsement exclusion that are contained in the excess liability\n\npolicies AGLIC and Ironshore issued to Denbury.        After considering the exclusions in the\n\ncontext of a well blowout that resulted in surface pollution, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals\n\nheld that under Texas law remediation and containment costs within the boundaries of a mineral\n\nlease are excluded from coverage under the \"owned, rented, or occupied\" exclusions contained\n\nin the \"Property Damage\" exclusion and \"Blended Pollution Endorsement\" attached to the\n\nSteadfast policy. Further, those policy exclusions and their limitations on coverage were held to\n\n                                                4\n\fbe clear and unambiguous, limiting the policy coverage to its clear meaning-coverage for third-\n\nparty damages to property or land that Denbury does not own, rent or occupy.\n\n          The dispute concerning the appropriate types of insurance Denbury should have\n\nprocured is also contained in Denbury's lawsuit, but those issues are strictly between Denbury\n\nand its broker, Marsh. Denbury's dispute with Ironshore is a coverage dispute based solely on\n\nthe interpretation of the unambiguous terms and conditions of Ironshore's policy to the facts and\n\nnothing more.\n\n          As stated      1ll   Denbury's brief, once AGLIe tendered its policy limits, Ironshore\n\nimmediately asked Denbury to provide information supporting its claim, including its settlement\n\nwith Loutre, its settlement with ANR, and how it allocated or identified the remediation expenses\n\nit incurred to clean up the land it leased and occupied from those expenses and/or damages\n\noutside of the land Denbury leased or occupied.                  Although Ironshore repeatedly requested\n\ninformation from Denbury about whether any timber outside of the Delhi field and/or the Holt-\n\nBryant Unit was damaged as a result of the blowout; the value of any such damaged timber, and\n\nan accounting of the clean-up expenses Denbury incurred cleaning up any pollution outside of\n\nthe Delhi fieldlH01t-Bryant Unit, Denbury has repeatedly refused to provide this critical\n\ninformation. 1 In fact, on November 11, 2014, Denbury responded to numerous requests for\n\ninformation from Ironshore by stating it was not \"making a distinction in its claim between 'on-\n\nlease' and 'off-lease' clean-up and related pollution costs,\" it could not identify the amount it\n\nspent cleaning up pollution outside of the Delhi field/Holt-Bryant Unit because it did not\n\nsegregate those expenses from what it spent cleaning up pollution within the field, and it was not\n\n\n\n\n1   See Exhibit M attached to PIs.' Mot. to Compel p. 1-2.\n                                                             5\n\fgomg to provide any further information about the Loutre settlement. 2                      Finally, although\n\nIronshore was made aware of a claim for loss of use of the ANR pipeline while the line was\n\nbeing repaired, in December 2014, without Ironshore's knowledge or consent and in direct\n\nviolation of the voluntary payment clause contained in the Ironshore policy, Denbury entered\n\ninto a $14,000,000.00 binding settlement agreement with ANR.\n\n        As a result of Denbury' s repeated failure to provide information supporting its claim, on\n\nJune 16,2015, Ironshore advised Denbury that while it would continue to investigate Denbury's\n\nclaim, based on the information provided by Denbury Ironshore must decline to accept, as being\n\ncovered property damage, AGLIC's payment of $9,900,000.00 to Loutre as that settlement\n\nappears to be payment for damage to property that Denbury leased and occupied, which is\n\nexcluded from coverage under Exclusion 8, Damage to Property, contained in the AGLIe and\n\nIronshore policies. 3 Ironshore also advised Denbury that based on Denbury's inability to identify\n\nthe amount it spent cleaning up pollution outside of the Delhi fieldlHolt-Bryant Unit, Ironshore\n\nmust decline Denbury's demand that Ironshore accept AGLIC's payment of $6,443,636.00 in\n\nwhat Denbury characterized as \"off unit\" clean up expenses.                      Finally, Ironshore advised\n\nDenbury that as a result of AGUC's payment of $16,244,861.00 in uncovered claims, the\n\nunderlying AGLIC policy has not been exhausted and Ironshore's policy has not been triggered.\n\n\n\n\n2 See Plaintiffs' November 11,2014 correspondence attached hereto as Exhibit 8. Further, it should be noted that\nPlaintiffs claim in their Memorandum in Support of their motion to compel that following Ironshore's October 23,\n2014 request for information that \"Denbmy replied in earnest to each and every RFI\" and filed suit thereafter on\nFebruary 19,2015 only after lronshore refused to accept or deny coverage. See PIs.' Memo. In Support of Mot. to\nCompel p. 3. However, Denbury actually filed its first lawsuit against Ironshore and the other defendants in this\nmatter much earlier on October 14,2014, the same day Denbury claims it made its formal claim under lronshore's\npolicy. See Exhibit 4 attached hereto, a copy of the docket sheet, Denbmy's Petition and civil process request for\nDenbury Resources Inc., et at. v. Ironshore Specialty Insurance Co., et at., Cause No. 2014-59947, in the 157th\nJudicial District Court of Harris County, Texas, for the Court's ease ofreference\n3 See Ex. M attached to PIs.' Mot. to Compel.\n\n\n\n                                                        6\n\f       There are three (3) policy limitations at the core of this insurance coverage dispute,\n\nincluding the Property Damage exclusion contained in the Ironshore policy; the Blended\n\nPollution Endorsement; and the voluntary payment clause, which clearly, unambiguously,\n\nand respectively exclude coverage for damage to property Denbury owns, rents or occupies;\n\ncoverage for remediation of pollution on land Denbury owns, rents or occupies; and which\n\nprohibit the settlement of any claims without first obtaining Ironshore's written consent.

ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES\n\n        Plaintiffs assert in their motion to compel that they are entitled to responses to discovery\n\nrequests regarding Ironshore's underwriting, reserves, claims handling, reinsurance, claims\n\nadjustment, and other areas because \"the terms and conditions of Ironshore's policy are\n\nambiguous and/or illusory.,,4 Plaintiffs, however, have never asserted that any specific policy\n\nprovision, term, condition, exclusion or endorsement of Ironshore's policy is ambiguous.\n\nInstead, the only mention of ambiguity in Plaintiffs' live petition is the single sentence that\n\nclaims \"[e]xcess carriers and Marsh engaged in unconscionable conduct by selling insurance\n\npolicies with ambiguous and/or illusory coverage.\"s There is no assertion that any specific\n\npolicy language is ambiguous. To the contrary, Denbury asserts in its petition that \"[t]here are\n\nno applicable policy provisions, conditions or exclusions which preclude or limit the coverage\n\navailable to Denbury for these costs, or which mitigate the Excess carriers' obligations to\n\nindemnify Denbury under the Excess policies.,,6\n\n        The interpretation of a contract is governed first and foremost by the language contained\n\nwithin the contract. Under Texas law, a court must \"ascertain the true intent of the parties as\n\nexpressed in the instrument.\" Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. CBI Indus., Inc., 907 S.W.2d 517,520\n\n\n4 PIs.' Memo.

Extrinsic evidence is only admissible to interpret a\n\ncontract if the contract language at issue is ambiguous. Id. Importantly, extrinsic evidence is not\n\nadmissible for the purpose of creating an ambiguity. Id. Thus, before Denbury can colorably\n\nargue that the underwriting, reserves, claims handling, reinsurance, and claims adjustment\n\ninformation it seeks is reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, it\n\nmust show that the Policy language at issue is ambiguous. In that regard, Denbury has failed to\n\neven allege that a specific policy terms is ambiguous. Further, the Fifth Circuit has already held\n\nthe language at issue to be clear and unambiguous. Pioneer Exploration, L.L.c., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">767</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">503</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\nExtrinsic evidence is admissible only to resolve an ambiguity, not to manufacture one. Courts\n\naccordingly have held that discovery of such extrinsic evidence is inappropriate until there has\n\nbeen finding that contraq language is ambiguous.         For example, in In re American Home\n\nAssurance Co., 88 S.W.3d at 377, the court held that a determination as to whether the disputed\n\npolicy language was ambiguous must precede efforts to discover extrinsic evidence \"because\n\nevidence would not be admissible that would conflict with the legal interpretation of that\n\nprovision.\" The court further noted that \"discovery undertaken with the purpose of finding an\n\nissue, rather than in support of an issue already raised by the pleadings, would constitute an\n\nimpermissible 'fishing expedition.'\" Id.\n\n           Importantly, Denbury has made no showing that the Policy is ambiguous. Instead, in one\n\nsentence, Denbury has vague! y asserted that \"[ e]xcess earri ers and Marsh engaged in\n\nunconscionable conduct by selling insurance policies with ambiguous andlor illusory coverage.\"7\n\nDenbury's bare assertion is plainly insufficient to show the Policy is ambiguous, as case law is\n\nclear that mere dissension over the meaning of contract language does not render a contract\n\n\n7   PIs.' Second Supp. Am. Pet. at p. 22, 'J[104.\n                                                    9\n\fambiguous. See Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. v. New Vlm Gas, Ltd., 940 S.W.2d 587,589\n\n(Tex. 1996) (an \"ambiguity does not arise simply because the parties advance conflicting\n\ninterpretations of the contract\").    Thus, the documents Denbury seeks are protected from\n\ndiscovery, and are irrelevant to this action. Accordingly, Denbury's motion to compel should be\n\ndenied.\n\n          By seeking to obtain evidence or testimony related to reasons why Ironshore issued the\n\npolicy or specific endorsements, Plaintiffs are attempting to use parole evidence to change the\n\nexpress and clear terms (and the coverages) of the policies at issue and create an ambiguity in the\n\npolicies where there is none. The meaning of the policy and the intent of the parties must be\n\ndetermined from the policy itself, not from extrinsic evidence. Carrabba v. Employers Cas.

See TEX.R.CIV.P. 192.5(a) and (b). Further, the Texas Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure only provide for the disclosure of the existence and contents of any applicable\n\ninsurance agreement. See TEx.R.CIv.P. 192.3(f). In Loftin v.

Denbury goes further here and actually requests the claim file\n\nand notes not only for the present action but also claims handling information for other unrelated\n\nclaims.\n\n          Denbury requests this Court enter an order compelling Ironshore to produce a copy of\n\n\"Denbury's unredacted claim file and claim notes as well as all communications by Ironshore to\n\nthird-parties relative to Denbury's c1aim.\"g Under Texas law, however, an insurer's investigative\n\nfiles, such as the claim file and claim notes at issue, are not subject to discovery simply because\n\nthe plaintiff alleges bad faith and breach of contract claims in the same action. See Maryland Am.\n\nGen. Ins. Co. v.

An insurer is entitled to assert a\n\nprivilege in response to actions for breach of contract and bad faith, so long as the insurer's\n\nliability on the contract is undetermined. Id. at 457-58.                 Ironshore's contractual liability to\n\nDenbury has not been determined. Therefore, Ironshore is entitled to assert the attorney-client\n\nand work product privileges in response to Denbury's claims. Accordingly, Denbury is not\n\nentitled to unredacted and complete claim file or claim notes.\n\n          Regardless, upon review of the Amended Privilege Log produced by Ironshore to\n\nDenbury, it demonstrates that only irrelevant documents or privileged documents and\n\ncommunications remain in the file. 9 Ironshore retained counsel regarding Denbury's claim on\n\n\n\n8PIs.'

During the course of that representation, Ironshore's counsel developed mental\n\nimpressions, prepared materials, and communicated with Ironshore regarding Denbury's claim.\n\nA review of the Amended Privilege Log reflects internal discussions regarding communication\n\nwith counsel, as well as direct communications with counsel, which are protected by the work\n\nproduct privilege. 1o Communications and correspondence with coverage counsel and defense\n\ncounsel in the instant lawsuit are protected from discovery by the attorney-client privilegeY\n\nCommunications among Ironshore's representatives are protected by the attorney-client privilege\n\nand are not discoverable as such communications are \"made for the purpose of facilitating the\n\nrendition of professional legal services to\" Ironshore and are not subject to a recognized\n\nexception or otherwise waived. TEx.R.EvID. 503(b)(1)(D).            There is no exception to the\n\nattorney-client privilege applicable to the communications among Ironshore personnel or with\n\nregard to communications pertaining to the instant lawsuit, nor has Ironshore waived the\n\nattorney-client privilege. The attorney-client privilege attaches to the complete communication\n\nbetween the attorney and the client. In re JDN Real Estate-MckInney L.P., 211 S.W.3d 907,922\n\n(Tex.App.-Dallas 2006, pet. denied). The subject matter of the information communicated is\n\nirrelevant when determining whether the privilege applies. Id. The privilege attaches to legal\n\nadvice and factual information included in the completed communications between the attorney\n\nand the client. Id.\n\n           Denbury seeks unfettered access to everything in the claim file and notes on this matter.\n\nTexas law has created privileges for work product and attorney-client communications which\n\nprevent Denbury' s overly broad requests. However, in certain circumstances, documents that do\n\nnot fall under privileges discussed above are placed in a claim file. For example, it is common\n\n10   See Am.

In the unlikely event this Court believes such\n\ngeneralizations suffice to allege ambiguity and make any portion of the underwriting file\n\ndiscoverable, this Court should exercise its discretion to narrowly tailor any production of the\n\nfile to those portions relevant as to specific policy provisions alleged to be ambiguous and for\n\nwhich courts have not already held are unambiguous.

Instead, there is case law\n\non point interpreting the relevant terms of the policies at issue in this matter. Denbury only seeks\n\nIronshore's underwriting materials in an attempt to improperly use parol evidence to create\n\nambiguity. Ironshore has asserted and supported is claim of trade secret privilege regarding its\n\nunderwriting information and documentation, and therefore, Denbury's motion to compel in this\n\nregard should be denied.\n\n    C. lronshore's Reserve Information is not Discoverable or Admissible\n\n       As an initial matter, any discussion of the value of a potential legal claim likely is going\n\nto be privileged. Nevertheless, whether or not Ironshore altered its reserves is not relevant to\n\nwhether Ironshore has indemnity obligations under the policy. First, such reserve information\n\ncannot be considered to construe an unambiguous policy provision. Second, to the extent a\n\npolicy provision is ambiguous, reserve information does not shed any light to its interpretation.\n\nThird, reserve information is irrelevant to any bad faith claim. Rather, the relevant questions in a\n\nbad faith dispute are whether Ironshore knew it had indemnity obligations and whether Ironshore\n\nhad a bona fide dispute about its liability.

Specifically, American Home involved a mandamus review\n\nof a discovery order compelling discovery of various information, including insurance reserves.\n\nld. at 371-72. In the underlying matter, the insured brought suit against its various insurers,\n\nclaiming those insurers refused to indemnify it for third-party claims made on its environmental\n\npolicies. ld. at 374. Thereafter, the insured sued its insurers under various theories of recovery,\n\nincluding, among others, breach of contract, fraud, declaratory judgment and violation of the\n\nTexas Insurance Code, and the trial court compelled the insurers to produce information\n\nincluding insurance reserves. ld.   Upon mandamus review, the Texarkana Court of Appeals\n\nsummarily concluded:\n\n       [R]equiring documentation ... regarding the setting of reserves for third-party\n       claims against the plaintiffs is improper because the information sought is not\n       admissible and would not lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\n\nId. at 377. The case instructs that discovery of such information is improper. Thus, the reserve\n\ninfonnation sought by Denbury is not discoverable under Texas law, and Denbury's motion to\n\ncompel in that regard should be denied.\n\n       Further, where Texas law requires setting of reserves, such reserves are not admissions of\n\nbad faith or unfair claims handling, and thus, are not discoverable.       Under Texas law, the\n\nquestion of whether an insurer engages in bad faith or unfair claims handling does not\n\nautomatically make relevant the insurer's setting of loss or claim reserves. Indeed, in Texas, an\n\ninsurer is required to maintain reserves. Tex. Ins. Code Ann. § 421.001 (Vernon 2007). The\n\npurpose of such statutes, enacted by Texas and other states, is to ensure that there is adequate\n\nmoney available for insurers to pay their claims, and do not constitute admissions by the insurer\n\nof any conduct, much less evaluation of liability in bad faith or unfair claims practice. See\n\n                                                 19\n\fHeights at Issaquah Ridge Owners Ass 'n v. Zurich American Ins.

LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">95213</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *6-7 (W.D. Wash. Dec. 13, 2007).             Texas law requiring the\n\nmaintenance and reporting of reserves creates obligations relevant to the financial condition and\n\nbusiness operations of the insurer. By complying, the insurer's establishment of loss reserves is\n\nnot an admission of any kind, is not a concession the insurer breached any duties owed to the\n\ninsured and does not constitute evidence the company has engaged in unfair claims practices.\n\nAccordingly, the establishment of a mandatory reserve has no bearing upon an insurer's liability\n\nin an action for bad faith or unfair claims practices.    Consequently, reserves information is\n\nsimply irrelevant to the issues here and Denbury's motion to compel should be denied in that\n\nregard. See In re American Home Assurance Co., 88 S.W.3d at 377. Texas insurers who are\n\nrequired to maintain loss or claim reserves as required by the Texas Department of Insurance\n\nmust not be penalized for compliance with that requirement. The use of loss or claims reserves\n\ninformation by insureds in litigation against the insurer is improper where the setting of reserves\n\nis in no way relevant and does not constitute an admission or concession of any kind, much less\n\nan admission of bad faith or unfair claims practices.\n\n       A common misconception exists that reserves are equivalent to an admission or valuation\n\nby the insurer. In a matter of first impression determining disclosure of reserve information was\n\nimproper where same was not reasonably calculated to lead to discovery of admissible evidence,\n\nthe Colorado Supreme Court explained that \"reserves should be not be equated with an\n\nadmission or valuation by the insurer\" and that reserve amounts are only partially within the\n\ninsurer's control. Silva v. Basin Western, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2521146\"><a href=\"/opinion/2521146/silva-v-basin-western-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1184</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1189 (Colo. 2002) (en banc). At\n\nleast one legal journal instructs that a presumption exists against disclosure of reserve\n\ninformation. See Sukel & Mike F. Pipkin, Discovery and Admissibility of Reserves, 34 TORT &\n\n                                                20\n\fINS. L. J. 191, 220 (Fall 1998). Although Denbury contends the amount of reserve set by\n\nIronshore in this case is discoverable, Denbury has not demonstrated in any fashion that the\n\nreserve information is relevant to the claims or defenses asserted in this matter. To the contrary,\n\nthe amount of reserves established by Ironshore is not relevant and is not reasonably calculated\n\nto lead to the discovery of admissible evidence on any claim or defense in this matter. As such,\n\nIronshore's objections to Denbury's Interrogatory No.9; First Set of Request for Production\n\nNos. 2 and 23; and Second Set of Request for Production Nos. 29, 30, and 31 should be\n\nsustained.\n\n    D. Denbury's Request to Compel Reinsurance Information Should be Denied\n\n        Denbury asserts that its bad faith allegations \"places additional facts at issue over and\n\nabove an ordinary insurance coverage action.\"21 Without citing Texas case law, it then broadly\n\nclaims that \"Ironshore's reinsurance information and communications are, therefore,\n\ndiscoverable to the extent 'the timing and content' of those documents can lead to the discovery\n\nof admissible evidence concerning Ironshore's evaluation of Denbury' s claim or the validity or\n\napplication of policy provisions to Denbury's claim throughout Ironshore' s adjustment.,,22\n\n        However, discovery of privileged material prepared by an insurer during its investigation\n\nand evaluation of a claim is improper where the insurer's liability for the claim has not been\n\ndetermined. See Blackmon, 639 S.W.2d at 458.                    Ironshore asserts that its risk management\n\nthrough reinsurance is information that it keeps confidential and is trade secret. 23             Further,\n\nDenbury's requests are moot because Ironshore has supplemented its discovery responses to\n\nprovide Denbury with a copy of the declarations page for its professional liability policy.\n\n\n21 See PIs.' Memo. In Support of Motion to Compel at 15.\n221d.\n23 See Lee Sheridan's Affidavit attached hereto as Exhibit 3.\n\n                                                         21\n\fAccordingly, Ironshore's objections to Denbury's Interrogatory No.1; First Set of Request for\n\nProduction Nos. 26 and 27; and Second Request for Production No. 16 should be sustained.\n\nIronshore has supplemented its response to Second Request for Production No. 69 seeking any\n\ninsurance policy that may defend or indemnify Ironshore in this litigation and produced a copy\n\nof the declarations page for professional liability insurance; therefore, this request is moot. 24\n\n     E. Denbury's Requests Regarding \"Similar Claims\" is an Overly Broad Fishing\n        Expedition in an Attempt to Harass Ironshore Before Ironshore's Contractual\n        Liability in This Matter is Determined\n\n        Denbury asserts that its discovery requests Interrogatory Nos. 10 and 12; First Request\n\nfor Production 4, 9, 10, 11, and 42; Second Request for Production 4-12 and 43-53; and Request\n\nfor Admission 52 seek information regarding similar claims. It should be kept in mind that.\n\n\" ... discovery is not only 'a tool for uncovering facts essential to accurate adjudication,' but also\n\n'a weapon capable of imposing large and unjustifiable costs on one's adversary.'\" In. re Alford\n\nChevrolet - Geo, 997 S.W.2d at 180.            As set forth by the Texas Supreme Court in Alford\n\nChevrolet - Geo, \" ... discovery may not be used as a fishing expedition or to impose\n\nunreasonable discovery expenses on the opposing party\". Id. at 181. Plaintiffs' requests seek\n\nirrelevant and likely inadmissible infonnation.

Therefore, Ironshore is entitled to assert the attorney-client\n\nand work product privileges in response to Denbury's requests for information and documents\n\nregarding the investigation of Denbury' s claims.

Accordingly, Denbury's motion to compel in this\n\nregard should be denied.\n\n    I. Ironshore's Claims Handling Procedures are Irrelevant to this Litigation and\n       Protected by Trade Secret Privilege\n\n         In Interrogatory Numbers 13 and 21; First Request for Production 4, 13, 14, 15, 19, 41,\n\n42 and 46; Second Request for Production 25-30, 43, 52, and 53; and Request for Admission 51\n\nDenbury seeks to obtain from Ironshore various documents and materials concerning the training\n\nof claim representatives and adjusters to handle claims and policy and procedure manuals for\n\nguidelines provided to claim representatives in insurance claims. Denbury has not satisfied its\n\nburden to show Ironshore's claim policies and procedures are relevant and reasonably necessary\n\nsuch that the Court should order production despite the trade secret status of the information\n\n\n                                                 29\n\fsought. 30 Moreover, Ironshore does not have guidelines which pertain ONLY to Denbury's\n\npolicy. Ironshore does have claim policies and guidelines which relate to all its policies, which\n\nfurther reinforces Ironshore's argument they should be protected.\n\n           Texas Rule of Evidence 507 establishes a qualified privilege allowing a person to refuse\n\nto disclose and to prevent others from disclosing trade secrets, provided the exercise of the\n\nprivilege will not tend to conceal fraud or otherwise work injustice. Trade secret issues are\n\ngoverned by state law. Aroson, 940 U.S. at 265-66. A trade secret is any formula, pattern, device\n\nor compilation of information which is used in one's business and presents an opportunity to\n\nobtain an advantage over competitors who do not know or use it. Computer Assocs. Int'l Inc.,\n\n918 S.W.2d at 455. When a party asserts trade secret privilege, the trial court must determine:\n\n(1) whether the information constitutes a trade secret, and (2) if so, the court must require the\n\nparty seeking production to show reasonable necessity for the requested materials. In re Union\n\nPacific R.R. Co., 294 S.W.3d at 591.\n\n           Ironshore's claim policies and procedures are trade secret.

Instead, Denbury has presented merely pretextual reasons for compelling production\n\nof Ironshore' s claims policies and procedures.\n\n           The Texas Supreme Court has repeatedly stated discovery requests must be reasonably\n\ntailored to include only matters relevant to the case.

In their current live pleading, Plaintiffs\n\nDenbury Resources Inc. and Denbury Onshore, LLC (hereinafter \"Plaintiffs\" or \"Denbury\")\n\nassert they selected umbrella insurance policies, based on insurance broker Marsh USA, Inc. 's\n\n                                               EXHIBIT\n\n\n\n                                   (\n\frecommendations, to cover such losses as those Denbury experienced as a result of the well\n\nblowout in northeastern Louisiana, known as the Delhi Incident. Plaintiffs seek a declaratory\n\njudgment that Ironshore, Alterra Excess & Surplus Insurance Company, and AXIS Surplus\n\nInsurance Company must indemnify Denbury for costs and expenses, not recoverable under the\n\nwell control policy, and in excess of the underlying policies that Denbury incurred in responding\n\nto the pollution resulting from the Delhi Incident.

In their current live pleading, Plaintiffs Denbury\n\nResources Inc. and Denbury Onshore, LLC (hereinafter \"Plaintiffs\" or \"Denbury\") assert they\n\nselected umbrella insurance policies, based on insurance broker Marsh USA, Inc.'s\n\n                                                 1\n\n                                            EXHIBIT\n\frecommendations, to cover such losses as those Denbury experienced as a result of the well\n\nblowout in northeastern Louisiana, known as the Delhi Incident.

That being said, Denbury has provided you, and all the upper layer excess carriers, with\ndetailed documentation of its costs incuned and claimed under not only the Ironshore Policy, but\nthose policies which sit above Ironshore's Policy in Denbury's excess liability tower. On July 7,\n2014, Denbury provided Iro11shore, and its other extess carriers, with detailed spreadsheets\nsummarizing all oftlle costs Denbury claims for clean-up oftlle pollution event arising out of the\nblowout. Attached to those spreadsheets were all of the invoices and proof of payment for each\nvendor paid by Denbury during the course of the clean-up operations. Denbury believes no\nfurther itemization ofthe costs it incuned and is claiming under the lronshore Policy is needed to\nsubstantiate its policy limit claim.\n\n\n\n                                                      EXHIBIT\n                        ENERGY CENTRE· 110\n                                     TELEI'110N   I                   • NEW ORLEANS.

Rather, Denbury\n         is making claim against Iron shore for all of the costs Denbury incurred in cleaning up the\n         pollution from the 220-2 blowout, and for resolving the claims of third parties. That being said,\n         Denbury is aware of the recent ruling of the United States Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in the\n         Pioneer v. Steadfast matter. As we pointed out in our meeting with you and representatives of the\n         other excess caniers, Denbury believes that both the Fifth Circuit and District Court opinions are\n         incorrect Erie guesses of Texas law with regard to the issue of whether the Zurich umbrella\n         policy provides coverage to Denbury for pollution costs incurred on property it does 110t occupy\n         within its mineral leases. For example, the recent Fifth Circuit opinion fails to even acknowledge\n         the fact that it is interpreting an exclusion in the policy at issue. Under Texas law, exclusionary\n         language is to be strictly constmed, and in favor of coverage, The Fifth Circuit's holding that the\n         use of the word \"occupied\" in an exclusion precludes coverage for vast expanses of land over\n         which an insured only has a \"light to occupy\" flies in the face of Texas insurance jurisprudence\n          interpreting exclusionary language, Moreover, at least one of the calTiers which is cUlTently\n          providing oilfield operator pollution liability coverage under similar tenTIS and conditions to that\n          as were found in the Zurich policy has modified its policies to repudiate the Pioneer and Aspen\n          decisions, The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals did not have before it evidence of the intent of the\n          parties to these insuring agreements. Denbury believes that such evidence of intent will be very\n          persuasive to Texas courts deciding this issue.\n\n                 In a nutshell, to Denbury, the \"on lease\" versus \"off lease\" distinction of damages is\n         immaterial for the claim it is making against Ironshore. To the extent that distinction does\n         become material at some point in the future, Denbury expects Ironshore to follow the Jead of\n         Zmich in its detem1inution of \"off lease\" clean-up costs, In this regard, Denbury did not, during\n         the clean-up, develop separate AFEs or any other cost accounting basis for segregating clean-up\n         oflands on the lease or off the lease and on the right-of-way. That distinction was immaterial to\n         Denbury in its efforts to fulfill its obligations to deal with the pollution that. arose from the event.\n         Thus, there is no practical way for Denbury to provide you with the documents requested in\n         requests 9, 11, 12, 13 and 14.\n\n'1\"\nf')              We now address each of your fifty-two requests for documents individually:\nVI\n00\nVI\nN\n[--'\n\\0\n          L Attached as DRI-SD-3609-5007,\n ;...:\n Cl)\n..0\nE        2.

Denbury has the capability, and regularly does, create new maps of its active fields, such as\n   the Delhi Field. However, it has previously produced a map depicting the Holt-Bryant Unit\n   in the Delhi Field. It is impracticable to produce \"any and all Unit maps, field maps, site\n   maps or other maps\" since there are likely hundreds currently in Denbury's possession with\n   new maps created regularly.\n\n4.
