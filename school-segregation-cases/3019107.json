He alleges that RJ Reynolds\n\nTobacco Company discriminated against him on the basis of age when it rejected\n\nhis application for employment. This appeal raises two important questions. The\n\nfirst is a question of first impression in this Circuit: whether § 4(a)(2) of the\n\nADEA, 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(2), authorizes disparate impact claims by applicants for\n\nemployment. We hold that it does, though not because the language of the statute\n\nplainly requires this reading. In fact, the statute is unclear on this question.\n\nHowever, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency\n\ncharged with enforcing the ADEA, has reasonably and consistently interpreted the\n\nstatute to cover claims like Mr. Villarreal’s. We must defer to that reading rather\n\nthan venture our own guess about what the statute means. The second question is\n\nwhether Mr. Villarreal is entitled to equitable tolling of the ADEA’s limitations\n\nperiod. We conclude that he is, and reverse the judgment of the District Court for\n\nboth of these reasons.\n\n\n\n\n       *\n          Honorable C. Roger Vinson, United States District Judge for the Northern District of\nFlorida, sitting by designation.\n\n                                                2\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015   Page: 3 of 60\n\n\n                                         I.\n\n      RJ Reynolds employs regional sales representatives known as Territory\n\nManagers. With the assistance of recruiting services, the company used a set of\n\n“resume review guidelines” in screening applicants for these positions. These\n\nguidelines list a number of characteristics RJ Reynolds wanted in its new hires,\n\nsome of which relate to age. For example, the guidelines tell hiring managers to\n\ntarget candidates who are “2–3 years out of college” but to “stay away from”\n\ncandidates with “8–10 years” of prior sales experience. As it turns out, RJ\n\nReynolds’s hiring statistics suggest a pattern of hiring younger applicants. Of the\n\n1,024 people hired as Territory Managers from September 2007 to July 2010, only\n\n19 were over the age of 40.\n\n      Mr. Villarreal first applied for a Territory Manager position in November\n\n2007 by submitting an online application. He was 49 years old at the time. RJ\n\nReynolds never responded to his application. Over two years later, on May 17,\n\n2010, Mr. Villarreal filed a charge of unlawful discrimination with the Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), alleging that RJ Reynolds had\n\ndiscriminated against him on the basis of his age. The timing of this charge is\n\nrelevant to Mr. Villarreal’s federal lawsuit because the ADEA requires a person to\n\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\f                Case: 15-10602       Date Filed: 11/30/2015        Page: 4 of 60\n\n\nfile a charge of discrimination within 180 days of the discriminatory act. 1 29\n\nU.S.C. § 626(d)(1)(A). Compliance with this 180-day limitations period is a\n\n“prerequisite” to bringing a federal suit. McClinton v. Ala. By-Prods. Corp., 743\n\nF.2d 1483, 1485 (11th Cir. 1984).\n\n       While his charge of discrimination was pending before the EEOC, Mr.\n\nVillarreal applied for a Territory Manager position five more times, and was\n\nrejected each time. He amended his charge of discrimination to add these\n\napplications and rejections. Finally, on April 2, 2012, the EEOC declined to take\n\nfurther action against RJ Reynolds, and issued Mr. Villarreal a right-to-sue notice.\n\n       Mr. Villarreal next filed this lawsuit, raising both disparate treatment\n\n(discriminatory intent) and disparate impact (discriminatory result) claims under\n\nthe ADEA on behalf of himself and all other similarly situated applicants. The\n\ncomplaint acknowledged that Mr. Villarreal’s charge of discrimination had been\n\nfiled more than 180 days after his initial November 2007 application. However,\n\nMr. Villarreal says the limitations period should be equitably tolled until April\n\n2010 because “[t]he facts necessary to support [his] charge of discrimination were\n\nnot apparent to him, and could not have been apparent to him, until less than a\n\nmonth before he filed his May 17, 2010 EEOC charge.”\n\n       1\n         The limitations period is extended to 300 days if there exists a state agency equivalent\nto the EEOC. Jones v. Dillard’s, Inc., 331 F.3d 1259, 1263 (11th Cir. 2003) (citing 29 U.S.C.\n§§ 626(d), 633). Georgia does not have such an agency, so the 180-day period applies here.\n\n                                                 4\n\f                Case: 15-10602       Date Filed: 11/30/2015       Page: 5 of 60\n\n\n       The District Court granted RJ Reynolds’s partial motion to dismiss. First, it\n\ndismissed Mr. Villarreal’s disparate impact claim entirely, finding that the ADEA\n\nonly allows suits for disparate impact claims brought by current employees, as\n\nopposed to applicants for employment like Mr. Villarreal. Second, it dismissed all\n\nclaims related to hiring decisions before November 19, 2009, as untimely. 2 The\n\nDistrict Court found that Mr. Villarreal was not entitled to equitable tolling for his\n\nNovember 2007 allegations because “[t]he Complaint does not specify which facts\n\nPlaintiff came to know in 2010, or how Plaintiff came to know them.”\n\n       Following the District Court’s ruling, Mr. Villarreal moved to amend his\n\ncomplaint to add facts in support of his equitable tolling argument. Mr.\n\nVillarreal’s proposed amended complaint alleged that he had not known about RJ\n\nReynolds’s process for reviewing applications or its use of the resume review\n\nguidelines until he spoke with lawyers from Altshuler Berzon in April 2010.\n\nIndeed, RJ Reynolds never responded one way or the other to Mr. Villarreal’s 2007\n\napplication, so “[h]e did not even know whether his application had been reviewed\n\nat all, much less whether it had been rejected or screened out.”\n\n       The District Court found that the amendment would be futile and denied Mr.\n\nVillarreal leave to amend his complaint. It explained that Mr. Villarreal’s\n       2\n         November 19, 2009, is 180 days before Mr. Villarreal filed his charge of discrimination\nwith the EEOC. The District Court’s timeliness ruling applied to all plaintiffs in the collective\naction. See Hipp v. Liberty Nat’l Life Ins. Co., 252 F.3d 1208, 1214 (11th Cir. 2001) (per\ncuriam).\n\n                                                5\n\f              Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015    Page: 6 of 60\n\n\namended complaint had not stated a claim for equitable tolling for two reasons.\n\nFirst, Mr. Villarreal did not diligently pursue his rights because he did not contact\n\nRJ Reynolds to find out why his application had been rejected. And second, he\n\nfailed to allege any misrepresentation or concealment by RJ Reynolds.\n\n      Mr. Villarreal voluntarily dismissed his remaining claim and filed this\n\nappeal, challenging the District Court’s rulings on both his disparate impact claim\n\nand equitable tolling. We consider each argument in turn.\n\n                                          II.\n\n      We first address whether § 4(a) of the ADEA authorizes disparate impact\n\nclaims by people applying for jobs. Unlawful discrimination takes two forms:\n\ndisparate treatment and disparate impact. In the employment context, disparate\n\ntreatment happens when an employer treats some people less favorably because of\n\na protected characteristic, such as race, religion, sex, or in our case, age. To prove\n\nthis type of claim, a plaintiff must establish that the employer had the intent to\n\ndiscriminate. Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 335 n.15, 97\n\nS. Ct. 1843, 1854 n.15 (1977). In contrast, disparate impact happens when an\n\nemployer uses “practices that are facially neutral in their treatment of different\n\ngroups but that in fact fall more harshly on one group than another.” Id. No proof\n\nof discriminatory intent is required for disparate impact claims. Id.\n\n      In Smith v. City of Jackson, Miss., 544 U.S. 228, 125 S. Ct. 1536 (2005), the\n\n\n                                           6\n\f              Case: 15-10602    Date Filed: 11/30/2015   Page: 7 of 60\n\n\nSupreme Court held for the first time that the ADEA authorizes disparate impact\n\nclaims. Smith was a case in which older employees had received smaller salary\n\nincreases than their younger colleagues. Id. at 230, 125 S. Ct. at 1539. Because\n\nSmith involved only claims of current employees, it did not answer the question\n\nwe face here: whether job applicants may bring disparate impact claims as well.\n\n                                              A.\n\n      As always, statutory interpretation begins with the language of the statute. If\n\nthe statutory language is clear, then our inquiry ends. King v. Burwell, __ U.S. __,\n\n__, 135 S. Ct. 2480, 2489 (2015). If the language is unclear, we see if the agency\n\nthat enforces the statute has interpreted the ambiguity. If the agency has\n\ninterpreted the ambiguity reasonably, then we defer to its view. See id.\n\n      Section 4(a) of the ADEA makes it unlawful for an employer:\n\n      (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise\n      discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,\n      terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such\n      individual’s age; [or]\n\n      (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any way which\n      would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment\n      opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee,\n      because of such individual’s age\n\n29 U.S.C. § 623(a). Smith noted “key textual differences” between these two\n\nprovisions. Smith, 544 U.S. at 236 n.6, 125 S. Ct. at 1542 n.6 (plurality opinion).\n\nFirst, the two provisions treat motive differently. Subsection (a)(1) makes it\n\n\n                                          7\n\f              Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015   Page: 8 of 60\n\n\nunlawful to “discriminate against any individual . . . because of such individual’s\n\nage.” This provision focuses on the employer’s (discriminatory) motives, and is\n\nthe part of § 4(a) that authorizes disparate treatment claims. See Smith, 544 U.S. at\n\n236, 125 S. Ct. at 1542. Subsection (a)(2) targets employer conduct that “would\n\ndeprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise\n\nadversely affect his status as an employee.” This provision “focuses on the effects\n\nof the action on the employee rather than the motivation for the action of the\n\nemployer,” so it is the part of § 4(a) that authorizes disparate impact claims. Id.\n\nSmith identified only this difference between the two sections of the statute. See\n\nid. at 236 & n.6, 125 S. Ct. at 1542 & n.6.\n\n      However another possible difference is the description of who can sue under\n\neach section. Both subsections use the term “any individual.” But they use it in\n\ndifferent contexts. Subsection (4)(a)(1) makes it unlawful “to fail or refuse to hire\n\nor to discharge any individual.” The verb “hire” makes clear that “any individual”\n\nincludes job applicants. But § 4(a)(1) does not authorize disparate impact claims,\n\nso Mr. Villarreal’s argument is based on § 4(a)(2). Subsection 4(a)(2) also refers\n\nto “any individual.” Again, this section makes it unlawful for an employer “to\n\nlimit, segregate, or classify his employees in any way which would deprive or tend\n\nto deprive any individual of employment opportunities.” This section targets\n\nexactly three categories of conduct: an employer’s actions that “limit, segregate, or\n\n\n                                          8\n\f              Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015   Page: 9 of 60\n\n\nclassify his employees.” Within those three categories, the liability sweeps wide:\n\nany action that “would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment\n\nopportunities.” This is the very phrase that authorizes disparate impact liability,\n\nand the object of these verbs is the expansive term “any individual.”\n\n      This language has provoked the disagreement before us. Mr. Villarreal\n\nreads § 4(a)(2) to plainly cover his allegations. He notes that § 4(a)(2) makes it\n\nunlawful for an employer “to limit . . . his employees in any way which would\n\ndeprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities . . . because\n\nof such individual’s age.” 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(2). He says RJ Reynolds “limited”\n\nits “employees” in a “way which would deprive or tend to deprive” an “individual”\n\nlike him “of employment opportunities” because of his age. RJ Reynolds, in turn,\n\ndirects us to the earlier term “his employees.” It says the later reference to “any\n\nindividual” only includes these employees. RJ Reynolds reads § 4(a)(2) to cover\n\nonly things a company does to “limit, segregate, or classify” its employees in a\n\nway that would deprive those employees of employment opportunities.\n\n       Both of these readings seem reasonable. That being the case, the plain\n\nlanguage of the statute does not make clear whether job applicants like Mr.\n\nVillarreal may bring disparate impact claims. But before analyzing whether we\n\ncan defer to the agency’s reading, we take stock of a few other arguments for each\n\ninterpretation. These arguments underscore that § 4(a)(2) can reasonably be read\n\n\n                                          9\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015    Page: 10 of 60\n\n\nin more than one way.\n\n                                          1.\n\n      In support of his reading, Mr. Villarreal points to the landmark decision\n\nGriggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 91 S. Ct. 849 (1971). In Griggs the\n\nSupreme Court unanimously held that the plain text of § 703(a)(2) of Title VII of\n\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964 authorized disparate impact liability. The language\n\ninterpreted in Griggs was identical to the language of § 4(a)(2) except that it\n\naddressed discrimination based on “an individual’s race, color, age, religion, sex,\n\nor nationality” rather than “an individual’s age.”\n\n      When the Supreme Court held in Smith that the plain text of § 4(a)(2) of the\n\nADEA also authorized disparate impact liability, its analysis started with Griggs.\n\nThe Court framed the question before it as “whether the ‘disparate-impact’ theory\n\nof recovery announced in Griggs . . . is cognizable under the ADEA.” 544 U.S. at\n\n230, 125 S. Ct. at 1539. And the Court’s answer to this question “beg[a]n with the\n\npremise that when Congress uses the same language in two statutes having similar\n\npurposes, particularly when one is enacted shortly after the other, it is appropriate\n\nto presume that Congress intended that text to have the same meaning in both\n\nstatutes.” Id. at 233, 125 S. Ct. at 1541 (plurality opinion).\n\n      As we noted, Smith involved disparate impact claims brought only by\n\ncurrent employees. In Griggs, it is not as clear who won relief. Griggs began as a\n\n\n                                          10\n\f               Case: 15-10602        Date Filed: 11/30/2015        Page: 11 of 60\n\n\nclass action brought by current employees of a power plant on behalf of\n\n“employees who subsequently may be employed at the [plant] . . . and all [African\n\nAmericans] who may hereafter seek employment.” Griggs v. Duke Power Co.,\n\n420 F.2d 1225, 1227 (4th Cir. 1970). Though the Supreme Court noted that the\n\ncase was a class action, the Court also called the petitioners “a group of incumbent\n\n[African American] employees” and stated that “[a]ll the petitioners are employed\n\nat the Company’s Dan River Steam Station.” 401 U.S. at 426, 91 S. Ct. at 851.\n\nBut the Court also considered whether the parallel Title VII language prohibited\n\nrequirements that are imposed “as a condition of employment in or transfer to\n\njobs” and “operate to disqualify [African Americans] at a substantially higher rate\n\nthan white applicants.” Id. (emphasis added). We also know that the Supreme\n\nCourt has continued to characterize Griggs as protecting “applicants for hire.” See\n\nDothard v. Rawlinson, 433 U.S. 321, 328–29, 97 S. Ct. 2720, 2726–27 (1977).\n\nJust this summer, the Court said Griggs applied disparate impact liability to “hiring\n\ncriteria.” See Tex. Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs v. Inclusive Cmtys Project,\n\nInc., __ U.S. __, __, 135 S. Ct. 2507, 2517 (2015). 3\n\n\n       3\n          Our Court has also characterized Griggs in this way. See EEOC v. Joe’s Stone Crab,\nInc., 220 F.3d 1263, 1279 n.16 (11th Cir. 2000) (“In Griggs . . . the plaintiffs showed that the\nobjective and facially neutral requirements . . . in order to be hired or transferred . . . had a\ndisproportionate effect on white and black applicants.”); id. at 1282 n.18 (reading Griggs to\napply to “neutral hiring and promotion practices”); Johnson v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.,\nSynthetic Rubber Plant, 491 F.2d 1364, 1371–72 & n.17, 1373 & n.25 (5th Cir. 1974)\n(interpreting and applying Griggs as permitting disparate impact hiring claims brought by\n\n                                                11\n\f               Case: 15-10602        Date Filed: 11/30/2015        Page: 12 of 60\n\n\n       Mr. Villarreal argues that Griggs requires us to adopt his reading of\n\n§ 4(a)(2). RJ Reynolds responds that all the references in Griggs to “applicants”\n\nand “hiring” concerned current employees seeking promotions or transfers, not job\n\napplicants. Either way, Griggs did not directly tell us whether the identical Title\n\nVII language covers job applicants. Neither has the Court had a chance to address\n\nthis question since. That is because the year after the Griggs decision, Congress\n\nchanged the relevant language of Title VII from “his employees” to “his\n\nemployees or applicants for employment.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(2). We know\n\nthat Griggs did not decide whether Title VII applies to job applicants, so it does not\n\nrequire us to adopt Mr. Villarreal’s reading of § 4(a)(2). That said, the Supreme\n\nCourt’s repeated references to job applicants and its continued characterization of\n\nGriggs as covering job applicants tells us at least that this reading is reasonable.\n\n                                                 2.\n\n       Title VII relates to the question before us in another way: in 1972, Congress\n\namended that statute to add the words “or applicants for employment” to the\n\nlanguage that parallels § 4(a)(2) of the ADEA. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(2).\n\nCongress has not amended § 4(a)(2) of the ADEA in the same way. Because\n\n\n“potential . . . employees” and “potential . . . hirees”); United States v. Ga. Power Co., 474 F.2d\n906, 911 (5th Cir. 1973) (“In Griggs . . . the Supreme Court held that the proviso of this section\nmeans that no test used for hiring or promotion is valid if it ‘operates to exclude [African\nAmericans] [and] cannot be shown to be related to job performance.’” (second alteration in\noriginal)) (applying Griggs to disparate impact hiring, recruitment, and promotion claims).\n\n                                                 12\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015   Page: 13 of 60\n\n\nCongress chose to change Title VII this way but did not make the same change to\n\nthe ADEA, the District Court found that § 4(a)(2) cannot cover job applicants.\n\nThe court quoted language from Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc., 557 U.S.\n\n167, 174, 129 S. Ct. 2343, 2349 (2009) saying that the Supreme Court could not\n\n“ignore Congress’s decision to amend Title VII’s relevant provisions but not make\n\nsimilar changes to the ADEA.”\n\n      Gross involved a 1991 amendment to Title VII as opposed to the 1972\n\namendment to Title VII. Specifically, the Gross opinion derived two things from\n\nthe fact that Congress did not amend the ADEA when it enacted the 1991 Title VII\n\namendments. First, the Court noted that in 1991 Congress had\n\n“contemporaneously amended the ADEA in several ways.” Id. It explained that\n\n“negative implications raised by disparate provisions are strongest when the\n\nprovisions were considered simultaneously when the language raising the\n\nimplication was inserted.” Id. at 175, 129 S. Ct. at 2349 (quotation omitted). But\n\nthis lesson only goes so far, because we know that Congress did not amend the\n\nADEA in 1972 when it amended Title VII to include “applicants for employment.”\n\n      Second, the 1991 amendment to Title VII was enacted to override the\n\nSupreme Court’s interpretation of statutory language. See id. Since Congress was\n\nrejecting the Court’s interpretation of Title VII, it made sense to assume that\n\nCongress knew the Court’s interpretation would apply to the ADEA language it\n\n\n                                          13\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015   Page: 14 of 60\n\n\nleft untouched. But the 1972 amendment was not enacted to reject the Supreme\n\nCourt’s interpretation of the language at issue here. To the contrary, the Senate\n\nCommittee on Labor and Public Welfare explained that the change to “[t]his\n\nsubsection would merely be declaratory of present law.” S. Rep. No. 92-415, at 43\n\n(1971). And the parallel House Report explained the change by quoting\n\nextensively from Griggs and declaring that “[t]he provisions of the bill are fully in\n\naccord with the decision” in Griggs. H.R. Rep. No. 92-238, at 21–22 (1971).\n\n      Congress has all kinds of reasons for passing laws, and presumably all kinds\n\nof reasons for not passing laws as well. The 1972 change to Title VII was part of a\n\nbroad revamp of the statute aimed at expanding the jurisdiction and power of the\n\nEEOC. See George P. Sape & Thomas J. Hart, Title VII Reconsidered: The Equal\n\nOpportunity Act of 1972, 40 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 824 (1972). When Congress\n\nundertook these changes the ADEA was administered by the Secretary of Labor,\n\nnot the EEOC. See 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000e-4 (1978). We will not assume that\n\nCongress chose not to pass legislation modifying the ADEA simply because it did\n\nmake this one change in a broader restructuring of Title VII.\n\n                                          3.\n\n      RJ Reynolds asks us to treat Smith in much the same way Mr. Villarreal asks\n\nus to treat Griggs. But as we’ve said, Smith did not involve disparate impact\n\nclaims by job applicants. Neither did the Smith plaintiffs (like the Griggs\n\n\n                                          14\n\f               Case: 15-10602        Date Filed: 11/30/2015       Page: 15 of 60\n\n\nplaintiffs) challenge policies that harmed both job applicants and current\n\nemployees. While we recognize that the two concurring opinions in Smith\n\nreferenced the fact that § 4(a)(2) does not expressly mention job applicants,4 it is\n\nalso true that the issue of whether applicants can bring disparate impact claims was\n\nneither argued by the parties nor relevant to the case. At most, the dicta in Smith’s\n\nconcurrences, like that in Griggs, tells us that RJ Reynolds offers one reasonable\n\n\n\n\n       4\n         Justice O’Connor noted that “[s]ection 4(a)(2), of course, does not apply to ‘applicants\nfor employment’ at all—it is only § 4(a)(1) that protects this group.” 544 U.S. at 266, 125 S. Ct.\nat 1559 (O’Connor, J., concurring). Justice Scalia responded by noting that “perhaps the\nagency’s attempt to sweep employment applications into the disparate-impact prohibition is\nmistaken.” Id. at 246 n.3, 125 S. Ct. at 1548 n.3 (Scalia, J., concurring).\n\n        The dissent suggests that other Justices in Smith endorsed Justice O’Connor’s dicta\nbecause “nobody disagreed with her.” The dissent then quotes our observation that “there is\ndicta, and then there is Supreme Court dicta.” Schwab v. Crosby, 451 F.3d 1308, 1325 (11th Cir.\n2006). Along the same lines: there is dicta in a binding opinion and there is dicta in a\nnonbinding concurrence. It’s one thing to abide by dicta that is “three long, citation-laden\nparagraphs” of “well thought out, thoroughly reasoned, and carefully articulated analysis” in a\nmajority opinion, as Schwab did. Id. It’s another to do the same for a single sentence in a\nminority opinion, via the assumption that other Justices implicitly approved of this sentence.\n\n        As for the Smith plurality, the dissent points to a footnote in this opinion comparing\n§ 4(a)(1)’s focus on an employer’s motives to § 4(a)(2)’s focus on the effects of an employer’s\nactions. The dissent quotes a passage from this footnote that explains how § 4(a)(2) operates for\nclaims brought by current employees. But this passage doesn’t exclude § 4(a)(2) from applying\nto other kinds of claims. The Court was simply explaining how the statute works for claims like\nthe ones then before them. And the plurality even cited cases brought by job applicants to\ndeclare that “for over two decades after our decision in Griggs, the Courts of Appeals uniformly\ninterpreted the ADEA as authorizing recovery on a ‘disparate-impact’ theory in appropriate\ncases.” 544 U.S. at 236–37 & n.8, 125 S. Ct. at 1542–43 & n.8 (citing Wooden v. Bd. of Educ.\nof Jefferson Cty., 931 F.2d 376 (6th Cir. 1991), and Faulkner v. Super Valu Stores, Inc., 3 F.3d\n1419 (10th Cir. 1993)).\n\n\n\n                                                15\n\f               Case: 15-10602       Date Filed: 11/30/2015       Page: 16 of 60\n\n\nreading of § 4(a)(2).5 Notably, none of the opinions in Smith analyzed whether the\n\nEEOC deserves deference for its view on this particular question, as we must in the\n\ncase before us.\n\n                                               4.\n\n       RJ Reynolds also presses the argument that the meaning of § 4(a)(2) can be\n\nclearly derived from the way other parts of the ADEA distinguish between\n\nemployees and applicants for employment. For example, section 4(c)(2) makes it\n\nunlawful for a labor organization to “limit, segregate, or classify its membership”\n\nin any way that “adversely affect[s] [an individual’s] status as an employee or as\n\nan applicant for employment.” 29 U.S.C. § 623(c)(2). Section 4(d) extends the\n\nADEA’s retaliation protections to “applicants for employment” and “applicant[s]\n\nfor membership” in a labor organization. Id. § 631(d). And section 12(b)\n\ndescribes age limits for “any personnel action affecting employees or applicants for\n\nemployment.” Id. § 631(b). Finally, section 15 describes protections for\n\n“employees or applicants for employment,” “employees and applicants for\n\nemployment,” and “an employee or applicant for employment.” Id. §§ 633(a)–(b).\n\n\n       5\n         As for the dicta from other circuits that the dissent cites, the first of these cases\ndistinguished the ADEA from Title VII by explaining that “the basis for the Supreme Court’s\nholding in Griggs” was Title VII’s reference to “employees or applicants.” E.E.O.C. v. Francis\nW. Parker Sch., 41 F.3d 1073, 1077 (7th Cir. 1994). As discussed above, this language was\nadded to Title VII after Griggs. The two other cases cited by the dissent both relied on Francis\nW. Parker. This is the problem with dicta: when an issue is superfluous, even obvious errors\nescape notice.\n\n                                               16\n\f               Case: 15-10602       Date Filed: 11/30/2015       Page: 17 of 60\n\n\nRJ Reynolds tells us these provisions show that Congress knew how to reference\n\njob applicants and intentionally chose not to in § 4(a)(2).\n\n       But in contrast to § (4)(a)(1) and these other provisions referenced by RJ\n\nReynolds, § 4(a)(2) does not reference applicants for employment, and uses the\n\ngeneral term “any individual.” 6 We know that “‘any’ is a powerful and broad\n\nword. It does not mean some or all but a few, but instead means all.” United\n\nStates v. Fleet, 498 F.3d 1225, 1229 (11th Cir. 2007). Still, we cannot ignore that\n\nCongress expressly protected applicants for employment in other provisions of the\n\nADEA but declined to do so in § 4(a)(2). After all, “Congress generally acts\n\nintentionally when it uses particular language in one section of a statute but omits\n\nit in another.” Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. MacLean, __ U.S. __, __, 135 S. Ct.\n\n913, 919 (2015). And this “interpretive canon . . . applies with particular force”\n\nwhen Congress uses an omitted phrase elsewhere in “close proximity.” Id.\n\n       That said, this interpretive canon does little to reveal whether Congress used\n\n       6\n          At least some of the specific references to job applicants or hiring in other provisions\nmay be explainable. For example, Mr. Villarreal argues that the prohibition on labor union\npractices that harm an individual’s “status as an employee or as an applicant for employment” is\nmeant to address the unique way that certain unions influence someone’s “status” as a job\napplicant specifically by referring employers to applicants through union hiring halls. True or\nnot, this point underscores the danger of trying to guess why Congress chose broad or ambiguous\nterms based on guesses about why it chose specific terms on other occasions. For this reason,\nthe “presumption” of uniform usage “is not rigid and readily yields whenever there is such\nvariation in the connection in which the words are used as reasonably to warrant the conclusion\nthat they were employed in different parts of the act with different intent.” Gen. Dynamics Land\nSys., Inc. v. Cline, 540 U.S. 581, 595, 124 S. Ct. 1236, 1245 (2004) (holding that the word “age”\nhas different meanings in different parts of the ADEA).\n\n\n                                               17\n\f               Case: 15-10602        Date Filed: 11/30/2015        Page: 18 of 60\n\n\nthe term “any individual” to exclude job applicants or to include them. 7 Even if\n\nCongress knew how to distinguish employees and applicants, the statute still\n\nprohibits an employer’s policies that “limit . . . his employees in any way which\n\nwould deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities.”\n\nIndeed, perhaps these other provisions show that Congress knew how to use the\n\nmore specific term “employees” (and used that term in close proximity, earlier in\n\nthe same sentence) but chose the broader term “any individual.” Congress could\n\nhave made it unlawful for an employer “to limit, segregate, or classify his\n\nemployees in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any employee of\n\nemployment opportunities.” Instead it said “any individual.”\n\n                                                 5.\n\n       Finally, Mr. Villarreal and amici urge us to construe § 4(a)(2) to permit\n\ndisparate impact claims from job applicants because this would fit the ADEA’s\n\ngeneral purpose of protecting older job applicants. Congress’s concern for older\n\njob applicants was evident in a report written by the Department of Labor that led\n\nCongress to enact the ADEA. See U.S. Dep’t of Labor, The Older American\n\nWorker: Age Discrimination in Employment (1965). This report specifically\n\n\n       7\n          In addition, the next subsection of the statute uses the term “any individual” to refer\nsolely to job applicants. See 29 U.S.C. § 623(b). This section makes it “unlawful for an\nemployment agency to fail or refuse to refer for employment, or otherwise to discriminate\nagainst, any individual.” Id. (emphasis added). The ADEA’s definition section later explains\nthat employment agencies solely work with applicants for employments. See id. § 630(c).\n\n                                                 18\n\f              Case: 15-10602      Date Filed: 11/30/2015   Page: 19 of 60\n\n\ndescribed how seemingly neutral employment practices – including practices like\n\nthe screening guidelines challenged by Mr. Villarreal – can impose a disparate\n\nburden on older job applicants. See id. at 3 (“Any formal employment standard\n\nwhich requires, for example, a high school diploma will obviously work against\n\nthe employment of many older workers.”); see also id. at 12 (“Even for many plant\n\nproduction jobs in the major industries, employers for a variety of reasons seek\n\nyoung workers with high school educations or equivalent vocational training.”). In\n\nthis way the report seemed to predict the disparate impact idea that Griggs made\n\nlaw seven years later. The report further analyzed the discriminatory effects of\n\n“institutional arrangements that indirectly restrict the employment of older\n\nworkers,” id. at 15, as well as “employment practices which quite unintentionally\n\nlead to age limits in hiring,” id. at 22.\n\n       The report proposed legislation which was ultimately enacted as the ADEA.\n\nThe ADEA clearly states that one of its purposes is to “promote [the] employment\n\nof older persons based on their ability rather than age.” 29 U.S.C. § 621(b). It also\n\ndeclares that “older workers find themselves disadvantaged in their efforts . . .\n\nespecially to regain employment when displaced from jobs” and that “the\n\nincidence of unemployment, especially long-term unemployment . . . is, relative to\n\nthe younger ages, high among older workers; their numbers are great and growing;\n\nand their employment problems grave.” 29 U.S.C. § 621(a).\n\n\n                                            19\n\f               Case: 15-10602       Date Filed: 11/30/2015       Page: 20 of 60\n\n\n       Mr. Villarreal relies on these statements to argue that Congress intended for\n\n§ 4(a)(2) to protect both current employees and prospective job applicants.8 We\n\nagree that these statements show that Congress enacted the ADEA to address\n\ndiscriminatory hiring. But neither these statements of purpose nor the statute’s\n\nlegislative history tell us what type of claim (disparate treatment, disparate impact,\n\nor both) an applicant for employment can bring. We decline to answer this\n\nquestion through inferences about the ADEA’s general purpose.\n\n                                        *        *     *\n\n       Because the text of § 4(a)(2) does not clearly resolve the issue in this case,\n\nwe ask the question we must when faced with a vague statute: has the agency\n\ntasked with enforcing the statute given a reasonable reading?\n\n                                            B.\n\n       Subsection § 4(a)(2) of the ADEA clearly authorizes disparate impact\n\nclaims. What is less clear is whether its reference to “any individual” includes job\n\napplicants, or whether the separate term “his employees” limits the entire provision\n\n\n       8\n          Meanwhile, RJ Reynolds points to other legislative history suggesting that Congress did\nnot intend § 4(a)(2) to cover job applicants. For example, one legislative document explained\nthat § 4(a)(2) would make it unlawful “[t]o limit, segregate, or classify employees so as to\ndeprive them of employment opportunities or adversely affect their status.” 113 Cong. Rec.\n31,250 (1967) (emphases added). RJ Reynolds argues that this document proves that Congress\ndid not want § 4(a)(2) to cover job applicants. But then again, maybe this document proves the\ncontrary: maybe it shows that at least one person in or around Congress knew how to\nunambiguously limit § 4(a)(2) to current employees but Congress itself enacted broader\nlanguage.\n\n                                               20\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015    Page: 21 of 60\n\n\nto current employees. When a statute is ambiguous, policy choices belong to the\n\nagency that enforces the statute. See Nat’l Cable & Telecomms. Ass’n v. Brand X\n\nInternet Servs., 545 U.S. 967, 980, 125 S. Ct. 2688, 2699 (2005) (“In Chevron, this\n\nCourt held that ambiguities in statutes within an agency’s jurisdiction to administer\n\nare delegations of authority to the agency to fill the statutory gap in reasonable\n\nfashion. Filling these gaps, the Court explained, involves difficult policy choices\n\nthat agencies are better equipped to make than courts.”).\n\n      The EEOC enforces the ADEA. We therefore defer to its views on the\n\nADEA’s interpretation and application unless those views are unreasonable. See\n\nFed. Express Corp. v. Holowecki, 552 U.S. 389, 403, 128 S. Ct. 1147, 1158 (2008)\n\n(“Where ambiguities in statutory analysis and application are presented, the agency\n\nmay choose among reasonable alternatives.”); see also EEOC v. Commercial\n\nOffice Prods. Co., 486 U.S. 107, 115, 108 S. Ct. 1666, 1677 (1988) (“[I]t is\n\naxiomatic that the EEOC’s interpretation of Title VII, for which it has primary\n\nenforcement responsibility, need not be the best one by grammatical or any other\n\nstandards. Rather, the EEOC’s interpretation of ambiguous language need only be\n\nreasonable to be entitled to deference.”).\n\n      The EEOC’s current ADEA disparate impact regulation, issued under its\n\nstatutory rulemaking authority, 29 U.S.C. § 628, does not distinguish between\n\nprospective and existing employees. Instead, it states that, “[a]ny employment\n\n\n                                             21\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015    Page: 22 of 60\n\n\npractice that adversely affects individuals within the protected age group on the\n\nbasis of older age is discriminatory unless the practice is justified by a ‘reasonable\n\nfactor other than age.’” 29 C.F.R. § 1625.7(c). The regulation extends disparate\n\nimpact liability to all “individuals within the protected age group.” The EEOC\n\nargues that the regulation therefore established the agency’s view that § 4(a)(2)\n\nprotects any individual an employer discriminates against, regardless of whether\n\nthat individual is an employee or job applicant. Chevron requires us to defer to\n\nthis regulation’s reasonable interpretation of the ADEA’s “standards for a\n\ndisparate-impact claim.” Smith, 544 U.S. at 240, 125 S. Ct. at 1544 (plurality\n\nopinion). See Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S.\n\n837, 844, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 2782 (1984).\n\n      RJ Reynolds responds with two arguments for why the EEOC’s construction\n\nis not entitled to deference. First, the company claims 29 C.F.R. § 1625.7 is not\n\nrelevant to this case because it interprets a separate provision of the ADEA.\n\nSecond, it argues that the regulation does not clearly address the question in this\n\ncase. We address each of these arguments in turn. In doing so, we are mindful\n\nthat even if we assume that 29 C.F.R. § 1625.7 is ambiguous by virtue of an\n\ninferred limitation on its broad phrase “individuals within the protected age\n\ngroup,” we still owe deference to the EEOC’s view because the agency has\n\nreasonably and consistently insisted on this view for decades.\n\n\n                                          22\n\f             Case: 15-10602      Date Filed: 11/30/2015    Page: 23 of 60\n\n\n                                           1.\n\n      RJ Reynolds argues that 29 C.F.R. § 1625.7 is not entitled to deference on\n\nthe question of whether § 4(a)(2) permits disparate impact liability for applicants\n\nbecause this regulation concerns a separate provision of the ADEA. The company\n\nargues that 29 C.F.R. §1625.7 merely applies the “reasonable factor other than\n\nage” (RFOA) defense from Section 4(f)(1) to ADEA liability, rather than\n\nproviding a basis for disparate impact liability, which comes from § 4(a)(2).\n\n      But we read Smith to foreclose this argument. Because the Smith plurality\n\nfound that the text of § 4(a)(2) plainly authorizes disparate impact liability, it was\n\nnot necessary for a majority of Justices to analyze whether and how courts must\n\ndefer to the EEOC’s disparate impact regulation. The plurality did reference this\n\nregulation to explain why the RFOA provision cannot be understood separate from\n\nthe statutory scheme as a whole. See 544 U.S. at 239–40, 125 S. Ct. at 1544\n\n(plurality opinion). The plurality also explained that EEOC has “consistently\n\ninterpreted the ADEA to authorize relief on a disparate-impact theory” and that 29\n\nC.F.R. § 1625.7 “set[s] forth the standards for a disparate-impact claim.” Id.\n\n      Justice Scalia joined the Court’s holding that the ADEA permits disparate\n\nimpact liability, but he reached his view by way of deference to 29 CFR § 1625.7.\n\nHe first explained why 29 CFR § 1625.7 deserves deference as an interpretation of\n\n§ 4(a)(2):\n\n\n                                          23\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015    Page: 24 of 60\n\n\n      As [the] text [of § 4(f)(1)] makes clear, the RFOA defense is relevant only as\n      a response to employer actions “otherwise prohibited” by the ADEA.\n      Hence, the unavoidable meaning of the regulation at issue is that the ADEA\n      prohibits employer actions that have an “adverse impact on individuals\n      within the protected age group.” 29 CFR § 1625.7(d) (2004). And, of\n      course, the only provision of the ADEA that could conceivably be\n      interpreted to effect such a prohibition is § 4(a)(2).\n\nId. at 246, 125 S. Ct. at 1548 (Scalia, J., concurring). Justice Scalia then specified\n\nwhy the regulation’s interpretation of “otherwise prohibited” deserved deference,\n\neven though the regulation was focused on interpreting the term “reasonable\n\nfactors other than age.” In doing so, he responded to Justice O’Connor’s view:\n\n      Justice O’Connor . . . argues that the EEOC’s interpretation of what is\n      “otherwise prohibited” by the ADEA is not entitled to deference because the\n      Court concludes that the same regulation’s interpretation of another term . . .\n      is unreasonable. Her logic seems to be that, because the two interpretations\n      appear in the same paragraph, they should stand or fall together. She cites\n      no case for this proposition, and it makes little sense. If the two\n      simultaneously adopted interpretations were contained in distinct\n      paragraphs, the invalidation of one would not, of course, render the other\n      infirm. . . . I can conceive no basis for a different rule simply because the\n      two simultaneously adopted interpretations appear in the same paragraph.\n\nId.\n\n      Although Smith addressed a slightly different question than we have here,\n\nour study of it causes us to reject RJ Reynolds’s argument “that the RFOA clause\n\noperates independently of the remainder of the ADEA.” Id. at 245, 125 S. Ct. at\n\n1548. Although 29 CFR § 1625.7 is primarily analyzing “reasonable factor other\n\nthan age” not “any individual,” we “can conceive no basis” to ignore the\n\nregulation’s broad and unambiguous interpretation of this latter term “simply\n                                          24\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015    Page: 25 of 60\n\n\nbecause the two simultaneously adopted interpretations appear in the same\n\nparagraph.” Id. at 247, 125 S. Ct. at 1549. Smith establishes that 29 CFR § 1625.7\n\n“set[s] forth the standards for a disparate-impact claim.” Id. at 240, 125 S. Ct. at\n\n1544 (plurality opinion). We owe deference to these standards to the extent they\n\nare reasonable, and they are.\n\n                                          2.\n\n      RJ Reynolds also argues that 29 C.F.R. § 1625.7 is not entitled to deference\n\non the question of whether § 4(a)(2) permits disparate impact liability for\n\napplicants because the regulation does not address this question clearly. As we’ve\n\nsaid, this regulation describes the standard for challenging an “employment\n\npractice that adversely affects individuals within the protected age group.” 29\n\nC.F.R. § 1625.7(c). RJ Reynolds claims the expansive term “individuals” is\n\nambiguous as to the question in this case.\n\n      However, the preamble to the final regulations makes clear that the term\n\n“individuals” covers both employees and applicants. The preamble gives a number\n\nof examples of cases involving job applicants. See 77 Fed. Reg. 19080, 19084\n\n(2012) (describing a test for “candidates for jobs”); id. at 19086 (describing a test\n\nfor “applicants for security guard positions”); id. at 19087 (describing how “an\n\nemployer seeking to hire individuals with technological skills could instruct\n\ndecision makers” in a way that can “help to overcome age-based stereotypes”).\n\n\n                                          25\n\f               Case: 15-10602       Date Filed: 11/30/2015       Page: 26 of 60\n\n\nThe preamble’s list of “benefits of the rule” then declares that the regulation will\n\naddress “neutral practices that act as barriers to the employment of older workers”:\n\n       Data show that older individuals who become unemployed have more\n       difficulty finding a new position and tend to stay unemployed longer than\n       younger individuals. To the extent that the difficulty in finding new work is\n       attributable to neutral practices that act as barriers to the employment of\n       older workers, the regulation should help to reduce the rate of their\n       unemployment and, thus, help to reduce these unique burdens on society.\n\nId. at 19092 (footnote omitted). The EEOC’s interpretation is “a reasonable\n\nextrapolation of its regulations” and we defer to it “in light of its experience and\n\nexpertise in protecting those covered by the Act.” Holowecki, 552 U.S. at 398,\n\n128 S. Ct. at 1158; see also Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452, 461, 117 S. Ct. 905,\n\n911 (1997) (finding agency’s interpretation of its own regulations is controlling\n\n“unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation” (quotation\n\nomitted)). 9\n\n\n       9\n         RJ Reynolds argues we should not defer to the EEOC’s view that § 4(a)(2) covers job\napplicants because the EEOC’s disparate impact regulation “parrots” an ambiguous statutory\nterm. See Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U.S. 243, 257, 126 S. Ct. 904, 916 (2006) (“An agency does\nnot acquire special authority to interpret its own words when . . . it has elected merely to\nparaphrase the statutory language.”).\n\n        We reject this argument for two reasons. First, the regulation in Holowecki also used the\nsame “term Congress used in the underlying statute.” Holowecki, 552 U.S at 398, 128 S. Ct. at\n1156. But the Court distinguished Gonzales by noting that the EEOC had consistently and\nreasonably advanced the same view for years. See id. at 399, 128 S. Ct. at 1156. As we discuss\nin section II.B.3, the EEOC has done the same here, so its view is “entitled to a ‘measure of\nrespect’ under the less deferential Skidmore standard.” Id.\n\n        Second, the Gonzales regulation parroted the statutory terms “course of professional\npractice” and “legitimate medical purpose.” Gonzales, 546 U.S. at 257, 126 S. Ct. at 916. These\n\n                                               26\n\f               Case: 15-10602        Date Filed: 11/30/2015       Page: 27 of 60\n\n\n                                                3.\n\n       Finally, there is another reason to defer to the EEOC’s view on the scope of\n\ndisparate impact liability under the ADEA. Days after the ADEA went into effect,\n\nthe Department of Labor, which initially enforced the statute, clarified that neutral\n\n“pre-employment” tests must be “reasonably necessary for the specific work to be\n\nperformed” and “equally applied to all applicants.” 33 Fed. Reg. 9173 (1968).10\n\nAnd, in 1981, once the EEOC took over enforcing the statute, it made its view on\n\nthe scope of disparate impact liability clear in a regulation issued though notice-\n\nand-comment rulemaking:\n\n       When an employment practice, including a test, is claimed as a basis for\n       different treatment of employees or applicants for employment on the\n       grounds that it is a “factor other than” age, and such a practice has an\n       adverse impact on individuals within the protected age group, it can only be\n\n\ntwo terms did not clearly answer the question in the case. In contrast, RJ Reynolds does not\nclaim here that the statutory term “any individual” is by itself unclear. Instead, the company\nargues this term should be limited by the separate term “his employees.” The regulation imposes\nno such limitation. It simply prohibits “[a]ny employment practice that adversely affects\nindividuals within the protected age group on the basis of older age.” For this reason, the text of\nthe regulation lacks the ambiguity in the statute. So, even if we were to assume that the\nregulation was somehow still ambiguous, Auer requires us to defer to the EEOC’s clarification\nof this ambiguity. See Holowecki, 552 U.S at 398–99, 128 S. Ct. at 1156.\n       10\n          Indeed, the EEOC first advanced this construction before the ADEA was even passed\ninto law, as an interpretation of the identical Title VII language: in 1966, the agency issued\nGuidelines on Employment Testing Procedures which required that employment testing “fairly\nmeasures the knowledge or skills required by the particular job or class of jobs which the\napplicant seeks, or which fairly affords the employer a chance to measure the applicant's ability.”\nGriggs, 401 U.S. at 433 n.9, 91 S. Ct. at 855 n.9 (quoting EEOC guidelines) (emphasis added).\nBecause these guidelines form part of “the background against which Congress enacted” the\nADEA, they are a clue into Congress’s intent in using the same language in the ADEA. FDA v.\nBrown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 147, 120 S. Ct. 1291, 1308 (2000).\n\n                                                27\n\f               Case: 15-10602       Date Filed: 11/30/2015       Page: 28 of 60\n\n\n       justified as a business necessity.\n\n29 C.F.R. § 1625.7(d) (1981). This 1981 “regulation affirmed . . . the longstanding\n\nposition of the Department of Labor, the agency that previously administered the\n\nADEA.” Smith, 544 U.S. at 244, 125 S. Ct. at 1547 (Scalia, J., concurring)\n\n(referencing both the text of 29 C.F.R. § 1625.7 and the “statement of the EEOC\n\nwhich accompanied publication of the agency’s final interpretation”); see also id.\n\nat 239–40, 125 S. Ct. at 1544 (plurality opinion) (defending its interpretation of the\n\nADEA with the fact that “both the Department of Labor, which initially drafted the\n\nlegislation, and the EEOC, which is the agency charged by Congress with\n\nresponsibility for implementing the statute, have consistently” pushed the same\n\ninterpretation (citation omitted)).\n\n       The EEOC also stated this view in litigation as early as a 1995 brief before\n\nthe Supreme Court. 11 And the EEOC now advances this same interpretation in the\n\n\n       11\n           See Petition for a Writ of Certiorari at 12–13, EEOC v.

That reasoning is\nseriously flawed. By its express terms, Section 4(a)(2) is not limited to protecting incumbent\nemployees. Although Section 4(a)(2) makes it unlawful for an employer ‘to limit, segregate, or\nclassify his employees,’ the employer may not engage in such conduct ‘in any way which would\ndeprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities.’ . . . The use of the term\n‘individual’ rather than ‘employee’ indicates that Section 4(a)(2) protects applicants for\nemployment.”); see also Brief of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as Appellee at\nn.2, EEOC v.

Robbins, we defer to an agency’s\n\ninterpretation of its own regulation, advanced in a legal brief, unless that\n\ninterpretation is ‘plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.’” Chase\n\nBank USA, N.A. v. McCoy, 562 U.S. 195, 208, 131 S. Ct. 871, 880 (2011)\n\n(citation omitted). Here “there is no reason to suspect that the position the [EEOC]\n\ntakes in its amicus brief reflects anything g other than the agency’s fair and\n\nconsidered judgment as to what the regulation required at the time this dispute\n\narose.” Id. at 210, 131 S. Ct. at 881. The EEOC insisted on this view since at least\n\n1981 and gave the Supreme Court the exact legal reasoning for this view in 1995.\n\nFurther, the EEOC’s “brief is thoroughly reasoned and demonstrates a high level of\n\nconsideration given to the issue; the brief thoroughly and rationally analyzes the\n\nstatute, the legislative history, and the policy implications of the statutory\n\ninterpretation.” Pugliese v. Pukka Dev., Inc., 550 F.3d 1299, 1305 (11th Cir.\n\n\n“[e]ven if applicants are not covered by subsection 4(a)(2), disparate impact theory applies to\nthem by virtue of subsection 4(a)(1).” EEOC Reply Brief at 4, EEOC v. Francis W. Parker Sch.,\n41 F.3d 1073 (7th Cir. 1994) (No. 93-3395), 1994 WL 16045193. This alternative basis was\nlater foreclosed by Smith’s holding that § 4(a)(2) permits disparate impact but § 4(a)(1) does not.\nWhen the EEOC petitioned for certiorari in Francis Parker School, the agency made the exact\nsame argument about § 4(a)(2) it makes in this case.\n\n        RJ Reynolds argues that the two Francis W. Parker School briefs show that the agency\nwas “waffling” in its position on § 4(a)(2). But the EEOC’s Seventh Circuit brief never said that\n§ 4(a)(2) did not apply; it simply said that § 4(a)(1) would apply “even if” § 4(a)(2) did not. The\nEEOC offered this alternative argument after noting that the Seventh Circuit “has already\ninterpreted the language of subsection 4(a)(1) to authorize the use of disparate impact in Title\nVII.” Id. And when the EEOC sought review of the Seventh Circuit’s ruling in the Supreme\nCourt, the agency made the exact argument it now makes before us.\n\n                                                29\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015    Page: 30 of 60\n\n\n2008). Because “the opinion set forth in the brief is consistent with the position\n\n[the EEOC] has always held,” we must defer to it. Id. We therefore construe\n\n§4(a)(2) of the ADEA to apply to disappointed job applicants like Mr. Villarreal.\n\n                                         III.\n\n      We turn next to Mr. Villarreal’s equitable tolling argument. At this early\n\nstage, Mr. Villarreal is simply required to “plead the applicability of the doctrine.”\n\nOshiver v. Levin, Fishbein, Sedran & Berman, 38 F.3d 1380, 1391 (3d Cir. 1994).\n\nWe accept the complaint’s allegations as true and construe them in the light most\n\nfavorable to Mr. Villarreal. Harris v. United Auto. Ins. Grp., Inc., 579 F.3d 1227,\n\n1230 (11th Cir. 2009) (per curiam).\n\n      Mr. Villarreal’s charge of discrimination was filed with the EEOC\n\napproximately two-and-a-half years after he first applied for a position with RJ\n\nReynolds. This is well outside the 180-day limitations period. 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 626(d)(1)(a). However, Mr. Villarreal has alleged that he was entitled to\n\nequitable tolling because he did not know—nor could he have known—that he had\n\nbeen discriminated against until April 2010, when he was informed about the\n\nresume review guidelines and RJ Reynolds’s hiring practices.\n\n      The District Court rejected this argument. It found that Mr. Villarreal was\n\nnot entitled to equitable tolling because he did not allege either that RJ Reynolds\n\nhad misrepresented relevant facts or that he had diligently pursued his rights by\n\n\n                                          30\n\f               Case: 15-10602       Date Filed: 11/30/2015      Page: 31 of 60\n\n\nasking the company why he had not been hired. On appeal, Mr. Villarreal\n\ncontends that the District Court applied the wrong legal standard, and under the\n\nspecific facts of his case, those allegations are not required. We agree.\n\n       Forty years ago, our predecessor Circuit first considered this issue in Reeb v.\n\nEconomic Opportunity Atlanta, Inc., 516 F.2d 924 (5th Cir. 1975). 12 Reeb\n\nobserved that courts must take special care when considering the timeliness of\n\nemployment discrimination claims because an employee may not always have\n\nenough information to file suit within the limitations period. Id. at 929–31.\n\nIndeed, as it explained, “[s]ecret preferences in hiring and even more subtle means\n\nof illegal discrimination, because of their very nature, are unlikely to be readily\n\napparent to the individual discriminated against.” Id. at 931. Thus, the court held\n\nthat in employment discrimination cases, the limitations period is equitably tolled\n\n“until the facts which would support a cause of action are apparent or should be\n\napparent to a person with a reasonably prudent regard for his rights.” Id. at 930.\n\n       Since Reeb was decided, we have regularly reaffirmed the “reasonably\n\nprudent” person standard in our ADEA cases. See, e.g., Jones v. Dillard’s, Inc.,\n\n331 F.3d 1259, 1267 (11th Cir. 2003) (“The applicable limitations period did not\n\nbegin to run until the facts supporting a cause of action became apparent or should\n\n12\n  In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), this Court adopted as\nbinding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to the close of\nbusiness on September 30, 1981. Id. at 1207.\n\n\n                                               31\n\f               Case: 15-10602       Date Filed: 11/30/2015      Page: 32 of 60\n\n\nhave became apparent to a reasonably prudent person with concern for his or her\n\nrights.”); Sturniolo v. Sheaffer, Eaton, Inc., 15 F.3d 1023, 1025 (11th Cir. 1994)\n\n(“Under equitable modification, a limitations period does not start to run until the\n\nfacts which would support a charge of discrimination are apparent or should be\n\napparent to a person with a reasonably prudent regard for his rights.”); Cocke v.\n\nMerrill Lynch & Co., 817 F.2d 1559, 1561 (11th Cir. 1987) (per curiam) (“Rather,\n\nequitable tolling focuses on the employee with a reasonably prudent regard for his\n\nrights.”).13\n\n       Three additional aspects of our ADEA equitable tolling standard are\n\nimportant here. First—and contrary to what the District Court found—we do not\n\nrequire misrepresentation by the employer. In fact, we have expressly held to the\n\n\n       13\n          Although the dissent argues that our precedent requires “a showing of extraordinary\ncircumstances” to warrant equitable tolling, it cites a Social Security Act decision for this\nproposition. Jackson v. Astrue, 506 F.3d 1349, 1351 (11th Cir. 2007). In Jackson, we refused to\napply equitable tolling to excuse a Social Security claimant’s untimely appeal of an\nadministrative decision denying her benefits because she had not shown “extraordinary\ncircumstances.” See id. at 1353–54 (“We think the law clearly requires that a finding of\nextraordinary circumstances is necessary before a court may equitably toll the SSA’s statutory\nperiod, and this determination is reserved for extraordinary facts.” (quotation omitted)).\n         However, we are unaware of any ADEA case that imposes such a requirement. See, e.g.,\nJones, 331 F.3d at 1263–67 (applying equitable tolling without requiring “extraordinary\ncircumstances”); Hargett v. Valley Fed. Sav. Bank, 60 F.3d 754, 764–65 (11th Cir. 1995)\n(same); Sturniolo, 15 F.3d at 1024–26 (same); Cocke, 817 F.2d at 1561–62 (same). Applying a\nless stringent standard in this context makes good sense because discriminatory hiring practices\nare “unlikely to be readily apparent to the individual discriminated against.” Reeb, 516 F.2d at\n931. Thus, unlike a Social Security claimant who has all the information necessary to appeal at\nthe time her application for benefits is denied, an employee or applicant for employment may not\nknow any relevant facts at the time of the discriminatory act. See Jones, 331 F.3d at 1264.\n\n\n                                              32\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015   Page: 33 of 60\n\n\ncontrary. See, e.g., Browning v. AT&T Paradyne, 120 F.3d 222, 226 (11th Cir.\n\n1997) (“[E]quitable tolling does not require any misconduct on the part of the\n\ndefendant.”); Cocke, 817 F.2d at 1561 (“[E]quitable tolling does not require\n\nemployer misconduct.”). Rather, we inquire into whether “the facts supporting a\n\ncause of action became apparent or should have became apparent to a reasonably\n\nprudent person with concern for his or her rights.” Jones, 331 F.3d at 1267. And\n\nbased on this inquiry, this Court has allowed equitable tolling in cases where\n\nemployers concealed or misrepresented facts. See id. at 1264, 1267; Sturniolo, 15\n\nF.3d at 1025–26. After all, when evidence of discrimination is deliberately hidden,\n\neven a reasonably prudent person would have little opportunity to uncover it. But\n\nthere are circumstances other than concealment and misrepresentation which place\n\nrelevant facts beyond the reach of a reasonably prudent victim of discrimination.\n\nIn these cases the ultimate question is not whether an employer deliberately hid\n\nfacts. Rather, we ask whether reasonable prudence would have resulted in the\n\nplaintiff uncovering hidden facts earlier.\n\n      Second, a person’s “mere suspicion of age discrimination, unsupported by\n\npersonal knowledge,” does not trigger the limitations period. Sturniolo, 15 F.3d at\n\n1026. Instead, the clock does not begin to run until she has enough information to\n\nsupport her cause of action. Id. at 1025–26.\n\n      Finally, because “[s]ecret preferences in hiring” are “unlikely to be readily\n\n\n                                             33\n\f               Case: 15-10602       Date Filed: 11/30/2015       Page: 34 of 60\n\n\napparent to the individual discriminated against,” Reeb, 516 F.2d at 931, our\n\nprecedent makes clear that a plaintiff need not undertake an entirely futile\n\ninvestigation into hidden discriminatory practices in the name of “due diligence.”\n\nThus, while Mr. Villarreal’s diligence may be relevant to the ultimate inquiry—at\n\nwhat point the facts necessary to support his lawsuit “should [have been] apparent\n\nto a person with a reasonably prudent regard for his rights,” id. at 930—his failure\n\nto ask RJ Reynolds why he had not been hired is not fatal to his claim. 14\n\n       Our decision in Jones illustrates this point. In Jones, plaintiff Gerda Byrd\n\nworked as an “assistant area sales manager” at a department store. 331 F.3d at\n\n1261. In May 1999, Ms. Byrd learned that the store intended to eliminate her\n\nposition as part of its restructuring. Id. It allowed her to choose between taking\n\nanother position or accepting severance pay, and she chose the latter. Id. In June\n\n1999, however, Ms. Byrd learned that the store planned to hire two new assistant\n\narea sales managers. Id. She immediately suspected that she had been the victim\n\nof age discrimination, and recorded her suspicions in typed notes. Id.\n\n       Several months later, in October 1999, the store filled Ms. Byrd’s former\n\n       14\n           Along the same lines, the dissent correctly observes that “it might have been\nsomewhat difficult” for Mr. Villarreal to gather facts necessary to establish his discrimination\nclaim since RJ Reynolds used third-party services to screen applicants. But the use of third-party\nservices is not the only difficulty spurned applicants will face. A disappointed applicant\ninquiring of an employer about the age and identity of whoever was hired in his stead will likely\nnot be well received. Indeed, employers have every incentive to hold this type of information\nclose.\n\n\n                                               34\n\f              Case: 15-10602    Date Filed: 11/30/2015   Page: 35 of 60\n\n\nposition with a younger applicant. Id. at 1261–62. Ms. Byrd learned about the hire\n\nin November 1999 and filed her charge of discrimination with the EEOC in\n\nFebruary 2000. Id. at 1262–63. The district court found that Ms. Byrd’s federal\n\nlawsuit was untimely because her charge of discrimination had been filed more\n\nthan 180 days after any allegedly discriminatory act. See id. at 1262.\n\n        On appeal, our Court considered whether to apply equitable tolling to save\n\nMs. Byrd’s claim. We observed that the ADEAs limitations period could have\n\nbeen triggered on three possible dates: (1) April or May 1999, when Ms. Byrd was\n\nfirst told that her position would be eliminated; (2) June 1999, when she\n\ndiscovered that the store planned to hire two new assistant area sales managers and\n\nrecorded her suspicion of age discrimination; or (3) November 1999, when she\n\nlearned that her former position had been filled by a younger applicant. Id. at\n\n1263.\n\n        Without addressing whether Ms. Byrd had investigated the circumstances of\n\nher replacement, we explained that the third option was the “only one consistent\n\nwith our precedent and the facts of [the] case.” Id. at 1268. Thus, we held that the\n\nADEA’s limitations period had been equitably tolled until November 1999: it was\n\nonly then that Ms. Byrd had “sufficient evidence to support her age discrimination\n\nclaim.” Id. at 1266. We emphasized that even Ms. Byrd’s June 1999 discovery\n\nthat the store planned to hire two new assistant area sales managers was\n\n\n                                          35\n\f               Case: 15-10602         Date Filed: 11/30/2015       Page: 36 of 60\n\n\ninsufficient to trigger the limitations period because Ms. Byrd could not have been\n\nexpected to act on “mere suspicion.” Id. at 1267.\n\n       Jones controls here. If anything, Mr. Villarreal’s case presents an even\n\nstronger argument for equitable tolling because unlike Ms. Byrd, Mr. Villarreal\n\nalleges that he could not have even suspected age discrimination until shortly\n\nbefore he filed his charge of discrimination. Specifically, although Mr. Villarreal\n\napplied for a Territory Manager position in November 2007, he alleges that neither\n\nthe application itself nor any other information available to him described RJ\n\nReynolds’s hiring process, the resume review guidelines, or the statistical\n\ndisparities in the ages of successful applicants. Indeed, because RJ Reynolds never\n\ncontacted Mr. Villarreal about his application, all he could have known until April\n\n2010 was that he applied for a Territory Manager position but was never offered\n\nthe job.15 These facts were simply insufficient to support his cause of action and\n\ntrigger the limitations period.\n\n       Accepting Mr. Villarreal’s allegations as true and drawing all inferences in\n\n\n       15\n            The dissent overlooks this point entirely. The question here is not what a reasonably\nprudent person would have done, but whether the relevant facts would have “[become] apparent\nto a reasonably prudent person” any earlier than April 2010. Jones, 331 F.3d at 1267. Mr.\nVillarreal alleges that a reasonably prudent person could not have discovered RJ Reynolds’s\nallegedly discriminatory practices until that time. This is a facially plausible claim, which is all\nthat is required at this early stage. Chaparro v. Carnival Corp., 693 F.3d 1333, 1337 (11th Cir.\n2012) (per curiam) (stating that, to survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must “state a claim\nto relief that is plausible on its face” (quotation omitted)).\n\n\n\n                                                 36\n\f               Case: 15-10602       Date Filed: 11/30/2015       Page: 37 of 60\n\n\nhis favor—as we must, at this stage—we hold that Mr. Villarreal has stated a claim\n\nfor equitable tolling. We offer no view on whether he will ultimately be able to\n\nbenefit from the doctrine. The factual question remains whether a person such as\n\nMr. Villarreal, with a reasonably prudent regard for his rights, could have learned\n\nthe facts necessary to support his lawsuit earlier than April 2010. See Reeb, 516\n\nF.2d at 931. We reverse the District Court’s dismissal of Mr. Villarreal’s pre-\n\nNovember 2009 disparate treatment claims as time-barred and remand for further\n\nproceedings.16\n\n       REVERSED AND REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.\n\n\n\n\n       16\n          Mr. Villarreal also argues that, in the alternative, his charge of discrimination was\ntimely under the “continuing violation doctrine.” See Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan,\n536 U.S. 101, 110, 122 S. Ct. 2061, 2071 (2002). Because we agree that he has stated a claim\nfor equitable tolling, we need not reach this issue.\n\n                                               37\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015    Page: 38 of 60\n\n\nVINSON, District Judge, dissenting:\n\n      Although every case is important to the litigants involved, not every case is\n\nindependently significant. But this one is, and it has the potential to create bad law\n\nin two important areas. The majority first holds—and it is the only court ever to do\n\nso—that Section 4(a)(2) of the ADEA authorizes disparate impact claims brought\n\nby job applicants. It gets there by finding that Section 4(a)(2) is ambiguous and\n\nthat Mr. Villarreal’s reading of the statute is reasonable, thereby warranting\n\ndeference to the EEOC’s longstanding position that it protects applicants for hire.\n\nThe majority further holds—contrary to well established law—that such plaintiffs\n\nmay be entitled to the “extraordinary remedy” of equitable tolling, notwithstanding\n\nthe total absence of any plausible claim (let alone any evidence) of “extraordinary\n\ncircumstances” to justify it. I strongly disagree on both points and must\n\nrespectfully dissent.\n\n                                          I.\n\n      Section 4(a) of the ADEA makes it unlawful for an employer:\n\n      (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise\n      discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,\n      terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such\n      individual’s age; [or]\n\n      (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any way which\n      would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment\n      opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee,\n      because of such individual’s age[.]\n\f               Case: 15-10602       Date Filed: 11/30/2015       Page: 39 of 60\n\n\n\n\n29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1)-(2). Based on its plain language, the statute clearly protects\n\nboth employees and job applicants from disparate treatment in Section 4(a)(1), but\n\nit only protects employees in Section 4(a)(2).\n\n      In Smith v. City of Jackson, Miss., 544 U.S. 228, 125 S. Ct. 1536 (2005), the\n\nSupreme Court noted this important distinction and held that the ADEA authorizes\n\ndisparate impact claims pursuant to Section 4(a)(2). Significantly, the entire Court\n\nrecognized that disparate impact claims are not available under Section 4(a)(1)\n\nsince that section is limited to disparate treatment, so disparate impact liability\n\nexists only under Section 4(a)(2). See id. at 236 n.6, 125 S. Ct. at 1542 n.6\n\n(plurality); accord id. at 243, 125 S. Ct. at 1546 (agreeing with the plurality)\n\n(Scalia, J., concurring).\n\n      The plaintiffs in Smith were existing employees. The question presented in\n\nthis case is whether job applicants can pursue disparate impact claims under\n\nSection 4(a)(2). The majority holds that they can, but this is contrary to the plain\n\nlanguage of Section 4(a)(2) (which, as indicated above, clearly only protects\n\nemployees); and, as will be seen infra, it is contrary to every other court that has\n\nconsidered this issue, including the opinions of eight Supreme Court Justices in\n\nSmith.1\n\n      1\n          Chief Justice Rehnquist took no part in the Smith decision.\n\n\n                                               39\n\f             Case: 15-10602      Date Filed: 11/30/2015    Page: 40 of 60\n\n\n      Two “key textual differences” between Section 4(a)(1) and (a)(2) make clear\n\nthat the majority is wrong. Cf. id. at 236 n.6, 125 S. Ct. at 1542 n.6 (noting that the\n\ndifferences between the two paragraphs are important in determining the\n\navailability of disparate impact claims). First of all, while Section 4(a)(1) broadly\n\nprohibits discrimination against “any individual,” Section 4(a)(2) is much more\n\nlimited. It only prohibits the employer from “limit[ing], segregat[ing], or\n\nclassify[ing] his employees” in any manner that adversely affects them based on\n\nage. (Emphasis added.) The phrase “his employees,” including the use of the\n\npossessive “his,” is critically important as it limits the scope of Section 4(a)(2) to\n\nthose actions that an employer takes against employees. This limiting phrase is\n\nclear and unambiguous. A job applicant is, by definition, not an employee. 2\n\n      Second, unlike Section 4(a)(1), which prohibits an employer from “fail[ing]\n\nor refus[ing] to hire” a person based on age, Section 4(a)(2) makes no reference to\n\nhiring decisions at all. In other words, Congress expressly included job applicants\n\nwithin the protections of the first paragraph of Section 4(a) (the disparate treatment\n\nprovision), but it then omitted them in the very next paragraph (the disparate\n\nimpact provision). As the Supreme Court has frequently said (and as the majority\n\nitself has recognized): “Congress generally acts intentionally when it uses\n\n      2\n         The ADEA defines employee as “an individual employed by any employer[.]” See 29\nU.S.C. § 630(f).\n\n\n\n                                           40\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015    Page: 41 of 60\n\n\nparticular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another.” Department\n\nof Homeland Sec. v. MacLean, __ U.S. __, __, 135 S. Ct. 913, 919 (2015); see also\n\nNational Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, __ U.S. __, __, 132 S.\n\nCt. 2566, 2583 (2012) (“Where Congress uses certain language in one part of a\n\nstatute and different language in another, it is generally presumed that Congress\n\nacts intentionally.”). This is particularly so where, as here, the two statutory\n\nprovisions are right next to each other. See, e.g., MacLean, 135 S. Ct. at 919 (“The\n\ninterpretative canon that Congress acts intentionally when it omits language\n\nincluded elsewhere applies with particular force . . . [where the omitted phrase is\n\nused] in close proximity.”); see also Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23,\n\n104 S. Ct. 296, 300 (1983) (stating that if Congress intended a particular statutory\n\nresult, “it presumably would have done so expressly as it did in the immediately\n\n[preceding] subsection . . . . We refrain from concluding that the differing language\n\nin the two subsections has the same [reach]”).\n\n      In arguing that Section 4(a)(2) protects job applicants, Mr. Villarreal points\n\nto the language in the paragraph that, he claims, prevents employers from\n\n“depriv[ing] any individual of employment opportunities[.]” (Emphasis added.)\n\nThe majority, favoring only one portion of the sentence and disregarding the rest of\n\nthat sentence, believes this argument is reasonable because “any” is a broad and\n\npowerful word, and “individual” is not limited to employees. I suppose that\n\n\n                                          41\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015    Page: 42 of 60\n\n\nclause, if read out of context, could “reasonably” support Mr. Villarreal’s position\n\nbecause an applicant who was not hired is an “individual” who has been\n\n“deprive[d] . . . of employment opportunities.” But, as this court has said in\n\nstatutory construction cases, “context means a lot.” Friends of the Everglades v.\n\nSouth Florida Water Mgmt. District, 570 F.3d 1210, 1221 (11th Cir. 2009). Here,\n\ncontext simply means that a single clause means what it says. Section 4(a)(2) does\n\nnot use the word “individual” in isolation, but, instead, it clearly protects only\n\n“individual[s]” whose “status as an employee” was adversely affected by an\n\nemployer’s “limit[ing], segregat[ing], or classify[ing] his employees.” (Emphasis\n\nadded.) Thus, in the context of Section 4(a)(2), the “individuals” authorized to file\n\nsuit are limited to actual “employees,” rather than people who have no employment\n\nrelationship with the employer at all.\n\n      The majority devotes most of its opinion to several additional extra-statutory\n\narguments that Mr. Villarreal and RJ Reynolds have raised, ultimately concluding\n\nthat the arguments cut both ways, which renders the statute ambiguous and justifies\n\ndeference to the EEOC’s longstanding view on this issue. That is all unnecessary.\n\nBecause the language of Section 4(a)(2) is plain and clear on its face—particularly\n\nwhen contrasted with the language of Section 4(a)(1)—that should end the inquiry.\n\nSee King v. Burwell, __ U.S. __, __, 135 S. Ct. 2480, 2489 (2015). And that\n\nmeans we should not (and cannot) defer to the EEOC’s interpretation of Section\n\n\n                                          42\n\f              Case: 15-10602      Date Filed: 11/30/2015      Page: 43 of 60\n\n\n4(a)(2), no matter how long it has held that position. See Public Employee\n\nRetirement System of Ohio v. Betts, 492 U.S. 158, 171, 109 S. Ct. 2854, 2863\n\n(1989) (“[O]f course, no deference is due to agency interpretations at odds with the\n\nplain language of the statute itself. Even contemporaneous and longstanding\n\nagency interpretations must fall to the extent they conflict with statutory\n\nlanguage.”).3 Deference to an agency’s interpretation of a statute is proper “only\n\nwhen the devices of judicial construction have been tried and found to yield no\n\nclear sense of congressional intent.” See, e.g., General Dynamics Land Systems v.\n\nCline, 540 U.S. 581, 600, 124 S. Ct. 1236, 1248 (2004). Stated another way, when\n\n“regular interpretive method leaves no serious question” about how a statute\n\nshould be read, looking to an agency’s interpretation is inappropriate. See id.\n\nHere, “regular interpretive method”—indeed, just reading both paragraphs of\n\nSection 4(a)—“leaves no serious question” that Section 4(a)(2) does not apply to\n\njob applicants.\n\n       I am not alone in holding this view, as three of our sister circuits have stated\n\n       3\n          The EEOC has been wrong many times before. Betts is one of several cases that RJ\nReynolds has cited where courts have rejected the agency’s flawed reading of the ADEA. See,\ne.g., Kentucky Retirement Systems v. EEOC, 554 U.S. 135, 149-50, 128 S. Ct. 2361, 2371\n(2008) (refusing to defer to EEOC’s unpersuasive interpretation of the ADEA); General\nDynamics Land Systems v. Cline, 540 U.S. 581, 600, 124 S. Ct. 1236, 1248 (2004) (deference to\nEEOC’s reading of the ADEA unwarranted “because the Commission is clearly wrong”); Shikles\nv. Sprint/United Mgmt. Co., 426 F.3d 1304, 1316 (10th Cir. 2005) (rejecting EEOC’s position\nbecause it was “not particularly persuasive” and “directly contrary” to numerous other\nauthorities).\n\n\n                                             43\n\f              Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015     Page: 44 of 60\n\n\nthat Section 4(a)(2) is limited to employees. Smith v. City of Des Moines, 99 F.3d\n\n1466, 1470 n.2 (8th Cir. 1996) (recognizing that Section 4(a)(2) “governs\n\nemployer conduct with respect to ‘employees’ only”); Ellis v. United Airlines, Inc.,\n\n73 F.3d 999, 1007 n.12 (10th Cir. 1996) (“We do not dwell on [Section 4(a)(2)]\n\nbecause it does not appear to address refusals to hire at all . . . .”), overruled on\n\nother grounds by Smith, 544 U.S. at 228, 125 S. Ct. at 1536; EEOC v. Francis W.\n\nParker School, 41 F.3d 1073, 1077-78 (7th Cir. 1994) (the conclusion that Section\n\n4(a)(2) does not apply to “‘applicants for employment’ . . . is a result dictated by\n\nthe statute itself”), overruled on other grounds by Smith, 544 U.S. at 228, 125 S.\n\nCt. at 1536. Villarreal concedes these “contrary circuit decisions,” but he asserts\n\nthat they were addressing Section 4(a)(2) “only in dicta.” That may be true.\n\nNevertheless, these opinions indicate that three Courts of Appeal read Section\n\n4(a)(2) to exclude job applicants, which is “a result dictated by the statute itself.”\n\nSee Francis W. Parker School, 41 F.3d at 1078. And, that’s not all.\n\n      In her concurring opinion in Smith, Justice O’Connor (who was joined by\n\nJustice Kennedy and Justice Thomas) could not have been any clearer on this\n\nissue: “Section 4(a)(2), of course, does not apply to ‘applicants for employment’ at\n\nall—it is only § 4(a)(1) that protects this group.” See Smith, 544 U.S. at 266, 125\n\n\n\n\n                                           44\n\f               Case: 15-10602        Date Filed: 11/30/2015       Page: 45 of 60\n\n\nS. Ct. at 1559 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (emphasis added).4 While Justice\n\nO’Connor was only writing for three Justices, it is notable that nobody disagreed\n\nwith her.5 In fact, rather than dispute her confident declaration that “of course”\n\nSection 4(a)(2) does not protect job applicants, Justice Scalia wrote that the\n\nEEOC’s “attempt to sweep employment applications into the disparate-impact\n\nprohibition [may be] mistaken,” id. at 246 n.3, 125 S. Ct. at 1548 n.3 (Scalia, J.,\n\nconcurring), while the four-Justice plurality stated (and Justice Scalia “agree[d]”)\n\nthat Section 4(a)(2) “focuses on the effects . . . on the employee,” and courts must\n\nrecognize “key” differences between Section 4(a)(1) and (a)(2):\n\n               Paragraph (a)(1) makes it unlawful for an employer “to\n               fail or refuse to hire . . . any individual . . . because of\n               such individual’s age.” (Emphasis added.) The focus of\n               the paragraph is on the employer’s actions with respect to\n               the targeted individual. Paragraph (a)(2), however,\n               makes it unlawful for an employer “to limit . . . his\n               employees in any way which would deprive or tend to\n               deprive any individual of employment opportunities or\n\n       4\n            The only source that Justice O’Connor cited for this pronouncement was Section 4(a)\nitself, strengthening the conclusion that it is compelled by a plain reading of the statute.\n       5\n           If, for example, Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 91 S. Ct. 849 (1971) must be\nread the way that Mr. Villarreal reads it (which the majority says is reasonable), it seems likely\nthat someone would have at least mentioned it in response to Justice O’Connor’s statement.\nAfter all, the Justices repeatedly voiced their disagreements with multiple other parts of her\nopinion. See Smith, 544 U.S. at 236 ns.6-7, 238-239, 125 S. Ct. at 1542 ns.6-7, 1543-44 (e.g.,\nJustice O’Connor “ignores” parts of the statute; “her textual reasoning is not persuasive;” and she\nis “quite wrong”) (plurality); accord id. at 245-47 & ns.2-3, 125 S. Ct. at 1547-49 & ns. 2-3 (e.g.,\nJustice O’Connor’s various arguments are “misguided,” unsupported by authority, “cannot be\nsquared,” “make[ ] little sense,” and “cannot possibly be [right]”) (Scalia, J., concurring).\n\n\n                                                45\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015    Page: 46 of 60\n\n\n             otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee,\n             because of such individual’s age.” (Emphasis added.)\n             Unlike in paragraph (a)(1), there is thus an incongruity\n             between the employer’s actions—which are focused on\n             his employees generally—and the individual employee\n             who adversely suffers because of those actions. Thus, an\n             employer who classifies his employees without respect to\n             age may still be liable under the terms of this paragraph\n             [Section 4(a)(2)] if such classification adversely affects\n             the employee because of that employee’s age—the very\n             definition of disparate impact.\n\nId. at 236 & n.6, 125 S. Ct. at 1542 & n.6 (some emphasis altered). In other words,\n\nthe four-Justice plurality, Justice Scalia, and Justice O’Connor (along with Justices\n\nKennedy and Thomas, who concurred with her) treated Section 4(a)(2) as limited\n\nto employees —which is exactly what the statute says—and Justice Scalia\n\nseparately recognized that it might be a “mistake[ ]” to conclude otherwise.\n\n      The majority does not persuasively dispute this reading of Smith. Rather,\n\nbecause Smith involved current employees, it dismisses the language as dicta, just\n\nas Mr. Villarreal has sought to avoid inconvenient language directly on point from\n\nthe Seventh, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits. But together, that’s a lot of dictum to\n\nignore. Furthermore, “there is dicta and then there is dicta, and then there is\n\nSupreme Court dicta.” Schwab v. Crosby, 451 F.3d 1308, 1325 (11th Cir. 2006).\n\nThis circuit has warned that “dicta from the Supreme Court is not something to be\n\nlightly cast aside,” especially if it is “‘expressed so unequivocally’” and there is no\n\n\n                                          46\n\f                Case: 15-10602        Date Filed: 11/30/2015         Page: 47 of 60\n\n\n“‘clear’” case law to the contrary. See id. at 1325-26 (citing multiple cases). Not\n\nonly is there no clear case law to the contrary—by any court, anywhere—but at\n\nleast two District Courts have read Smith’s “dicta” to be unequivocal and preclude\n\ndisparate impact claims by job applicants. See Mays v. BNSF Railway Co., 974 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 1166, 1175-77 (N.D. Ill. 2013) (observing that because “both the plurality\n\nand Justice O’Connor’s concurrence described [Section 4(a)(2)] as protecting the\n\nemployer’s employees, period . . . the best and likely only possible way to read the\n\nprovision” is that it must be limited to “an ‘employee’ of the employer”); see also\n\nEEOC v. Allstate Ins. Co., 458 F. Supp. 2d 980, 989 (E.D. Mo. 2008) (“a disparate\n\nimpact hiring case . . . is no longer cognizable after [Smith]”), aff’d 528 F.3d 1042\n\n(8th Cir. 2008), reh’g en banc granted and opinion vacated and appeal dismissed\n\nfor lack of jurisdiction (Sept. 8, 2008)).6\n\n       In sum, the statute is plain and unambiguous. Consistent with two District\n\nCourts, three Courts of Appeal, and eight Supreme Court Justices (the full Court\n\nthat considered the Smith case): “Section 4(a)(2), of course, does not apply to\n\n‘applicants for employment’ at all—it is only § 4(a)(1) that protects this group.”\n\nSmith, 544 U.S. at 266, 125 S. Ct. at 1559 (O’Connor, J., concurring). The\n\n       6\n          Moreover, to the extent that all the cases I have cited on this issue may involve dicta,\nthat only helps prove the point. If the issue was not expressly raised and argued in these cases\n(or in any other case), perhaps that is because, until this case, no plaintiff had ever tried to argue\nthat Section 4(a)(2) applies to job applicants. And, until today, no court had ever suggested the\nstatute could be read that way.\n\n\n                                                  47\n\f               Case: 15-10602        Date Filed: 11/30/2015       Page: 48 of 60\n\n\nmajority is wrong to hold otherwise. 7\n\n                                                II.\n\n       Now to the second issue raised on appeal: equitable tolling. I will start by\n\ndiscussing the high standard that a plaintiff must satisfy before tolling is allowed.\n\n       The general federal rule is that a statute of limitations begins to run when the\n\nfacts that would support a cause of action are apparent “‘or should be apparent to a\n\nperson with a reasonably prudent regard for his rights.’” Rozar v. Mullis, 85 F.3d\n\n556, 561-62 (11th Cir. 1996) (citations omitted). For employment discrimination\n\nclaims, “a cause of action accrues whenever an individual is directly and adversely\n\naffected by the discriminatory practices of the defendant.” United States v.\n\nGeorgia Power Co., 474 F.2d 906, 924 (5th Cir. 1973).8 Triggering “events”\n\n\n       7\n           The majority ignores the two District Courts and dismisses the three Courts of Appeal.\nIt also discounts the significance of the plurality opinion and Justice Scalia’s concurrence in\nSmith. Although the opinions of the eight Supreme Court Justices with respect to Section 4(a)(2)\nand job applicants versus employees may be dicta, it is equally possible that it was integral to the\nCourt’s analysis. At the very least, three Justices (O’Connor, Kennedy, and Thomas)\nunequivocally and emphatically stated that Section 4(a)(2) does not apply to job applicants, and\nthe other five Justices impliedly agreed. This “dicta” might not be compelling if there was\npersuasive case law to the contrary, but no court has ever suggested otherwise in the almost fifty\nyears since the ADEA was enacted. While the majority points out that this undisputed and\ndirectly-on-point dicta is not part of “three long, citation-laden paragraphs” of “well thought out,\nthoroughly reasoned, and carefully articulated analysis,” that is not surprising. Indeed, because\nthe three Justices (and arguably the whole Court) believed Section 4(a)(2) to be so clear and\nunambiguous that “of course” it does not apply to job applicants, a lengthy and detailed analysis\nwas unnecessary.\n       8\n         In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), this circuit\nadopted as binding precedent all Fifth Circuit decisions that were rendered before October 1,\n1981.\n\n\n                                                48\n\f              Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015     Page: 49 of 60\n\n\ninclude “the refusal to hire the discriminatee[.]” Id.; accord, e.g., Hulsey v. Kmart,\n\n43 F.3d 555, 558-59 (10th Cir. 1994) (“[N]otice or knowledge of discriminatory\n\nmotivation is not a prerequisite for a cause of action to accrue under the ADEA.\n\nOn the contrary, it is knowledge of the adverse employment decision itself that\n\ntriggers the running of the statute of limitations.”). Consequently, the statute of\n\nlimitations began running for Mr. Villarreal’s claim when he was not hired in\n\nNovember 2007. That means his EEOC charge in May 2010 was untimely—\n\nunless he is entitled to equitable tolling.\n\n      A limitations period can be equitably tolled if the party seeking it establishes\n\nthat he was prevented from filing sooner because of events “that are both beyond\n\nhis control and unavoidable even with diligence,” as numerous panels of this court\n\nhave expressed it. See Motta ex rel. A.M. v. United States, 717 F.3d 840, 846\n\n(11th Cir. 2013); Brotherhood of Locomotive Eng’rs & Trainmen Gen. Comm. of\n\nAdjustment CSX Transp. N. Lines v. CSX Transp., Inc., 522 F.3d 1190, 1197\n\n(11th Cir. 2008); Arce v. Garcia, 434 F.3d 1254, 1261 (11th Cir. 2006); accord\n\nDrew v. Department of Corrections, 297 F.3d 1278, 1286 & 1290 n.5 (11th Cir.\n\n2002) (noting same while tracing the origins of equitable tolling from its roots in\n\nEnglish courts of chancery, and describing the “longstanding, firmly rooted\n\nprinciple that a court cannot grant equitable tolling unless it is satisfied that the\n\nparty seeking such relief has acted with diligence”). In employment cases, courts\n\n\n                                              49\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015    Page: 50 of 60\n\n\nhave said that the diligence requirement “imposes an affirmative duty on the\n\npotential plaintiff to proceed with a reasonable investigation in response to an\n\nadverse event.” See Pacheco v. Rice, 966 F.2d 904, 907 (5th Cir. 1992); cf.\n\nHulsey v. Kmart, 43 F.3d at 558 (refusing to toll statute of limitations period\n\nbecause plaintiff had a “duty to determine whether there was, in fact, a\n\ndiscriminatory motivation” for the adverse job action). Notably, “[i]t bears\n\nemphasizing . . . that due diligence on the part of the plaintiff, though necessary, is\n\nnot sufficient to prevail on the issue of equitable tolling. The Supreme Court has\n\nmade clear that tolling is an extraordinary remedy which should be extended only\n\nsparingly.” Justice v. United States, 6 F.3d 1474, 1479 (11th Cir. 1993) (citing\n\nIrwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 96, 111 S. Ct. 453, 457-58\n\n(1990)). This court has stated the same in the ADEA context: “Equitable tolling is\n\ninappropriate when a plaintiff did not file an action promptly or failed to act with\n\ndue diligence. Equitable tolling ‘is an extraordinary remedy which should be\n\nextended only sparingly.’” See Bost v. Federal Express Corp., 372 F.3d 1233,\n\n1242 (11th Cir. 2004) (citation omitted). A party seeking it must demonstrate\n\n“extraordinary circumstances.” See Jackson v. Astrue, 506 F.3d 1349, 1353-55\n\n(11th Cir. 2007) (citing, inter alia, Ross v. Buckeye Cellulose Corp., 980 F.2d 648\n\n(11th Cir. 1993) (Title VII case)).\n\n      The majority says that extraordinary circumstances are not required in\n\n\n                                          50\n\f               Case: 15-10602         Date Filed: 11/30/2015        Page: 51 of 60\n\n\nADEA cases. 9 According to the majority, a less stringent standard applies in\n\nemployment discrimination cases since discriminatory hiring practices are\n\n“unlikely to be readily apparent to the individual discriminated against.” Reeb v.\n\nEconomic Opportunity Atlanta, Inc., 516 F.2d 924, 931 (5th Cir. 1975). In\n\nadvancing this argument, the majority notes that Jackson, supra, is a Social\n\nSecurity Act case, and it is “unaware of any ADEA case that imposes [the\n\n‘extraordinary circumstances’] requirement.” Jackson is indeed a Social Security\n\nAct case. But, as indicated above, it expressly relies on Ross, which is a Title VII\n\ncase that required a showing of “extraordinary circumstances.” See Jackson, 506\n\nF.3d at 1353-55 (concluding that “a finding of extraordinary circumstances is\n\nnecessary before a court may equitably toll the SSA’s statutory period,” which, the\n\npanel went on to observe, “is fully consistent with [this circuit’s] approach to\n\nequitable tolling in” employment discrimination cases such as Ross).\n\nConsequently, to be entitled to equitable tolling—even in the employment\n\ndiscrimination context—it appears to be well established that this court does, in\n\n\n\n\n       9\n          Even if one assumes that “extraordinary circumstances” are not required in ADEA\ncases (and, as will be seen in a moment, that is simply not correct), the precedent I just cited in\nthe text makes it clear that equitable tolling—even in ADEA cases—is at the very least “‘an\nextraordinary remedy which should be extended only sparingly.’” See Bost, 372 F.3d at 1242\n(ADEA case).\n\n\n                                                 51\n\f               Case: 15-10602        Date Filed: 11/30/2015        Page: 52 of 60\n\n\nfact, require plaintiffs to show “extraordinary circumstances.”10\n\n       If evaluated under the proper standard, it is clear that equitable tolling is not\n\njustified in this case. As previously noted, equitable tolling is only appropriate if a\n\nplaintiff untimely files due to extraordinary circumstances that are both beyond his\n\ncontrol and unavoidable with due diligence. Mr. Villarreal does not even claim\n\nthat there are any extraordinary circumstances in this case (like fraud,\n\nmisinformation, or deliberate concealment by RJ Reynolds) that should warrant\n\nthis extraordinary and sparingly-used remedy. 11\n\n       Mr. Villarreal was given an opportunity by the District Court to set out his\n\nequitable grounds for tolling. According to his proposed amended complaint, after\n       10\n           In addition to the published authority cited above, this circuit has repeatedly required\n“extraordinary circumstances” in Title VII and ADEA cases in unpublished decisions. See, e.g.,\nMesidor v. Waste Mgmt., Inc. of Florida, 606 F. App’x 934, 936 (11th Cir. 2015) (stating in\nTitle VII case: “To show they are entitled to equitable tolling, the Appellants must show\nextraordinary circumstances such as fraud, misinformation, or deliberate concealment.”); Bourne\nv. School Bd. of Broward County, 508 F. App’x 907, 909-10 (11th Cir. 2013) (same in Title VII\ncase); Brown v. John Deere Product, Inc., 460 F. App’x 908, 909-10 (11th Cir. 2012) (same in\nTitle VII case); Arrington v. United Parcel Service, 384 F. App’x. 851, 852 (11th Cir. 2010)\n(same in ADEA case); Wakefield v. Cordis Corp., 211 F. App’x 834, 836 (11th Cir. 2006) (same\nin Title VII case). This acknowledgment of the “extraordinary circumstances” requirement in so\nmany unpublished cases is an implicit agreement that it is the settled law of this circuit.\n       11\n            To be clear, I have cited employer fraud, misinformation, and deliberate concealment\nfor illustrative purposes; I am not suggesting they are required. In fact, I agree with the majority\nthat they are not. However, as will be seen shortly, this circuit has long been reluctant to—and\nusually does not—allow equitable tolling in the absence of such evidence. See, e.g., Cabello v.\nFernandez-Larios, 402 F.3d 1148, 1554-55 (11th Cir. 2005) (observing that equitable tolling “‘is\nreserved for extraordinary facts,’” and, before it can be authorized, “‘courts usually require some\naffirmative misconduct, such as deliberate concealment’”) (citation omitted); see also Cocke v.\nMerrill Lynch & Co. Inc., 817 F.2d 1559, 1561 (11th Cir. 1987) (recognizing that “‘courts\nevince a reluctance to toll the filing period absent misconduct or bad faith attributable to the\ndefendant’”) (citation omitted).\n\n\n                                                 52\n\f             Case: 15-10602      Date Filed: 11/30/2015    Page: 53 of 60\n\n\nhe was denied employment with RJ Reynolds in November 2007, he did nothing\n\nfor more than two years. In fact, he did not even call the company to confirm that\n\nhis application had been reviewed, let alone find out why it was rejected. He made\n\nno attempt to discover the identity or age of the person who was hired, nor did he\n\ntry to learn about the company’s hiring practices or its allegedly discriminatory\n\n“resume review guidelines.” To be sure, it might have been somewhat difficult for\n\nhim to have gotten such information since RJ Reynolds used third-party services to\n\nscreen its applicants, but the fact is that he made no attempt to try. He did not\n\nexercise any diligence at all, and a reasonably prudent person with concern for his\n\nrights would have done so.\n\n      The majority believes that such efforts should not be required of plaintiffs in\n\nfailure-to-hire cases because any investigation into why they were not hired would\n\nbe “an entirely futile” gesture insofar as “[a] disappointed applicant inquiring of an\n\nemployer about the age and identity of whoever was hired in his stead will likely\n\nnot be well received. Indeed, employers have every incentive to hold this type of\n\ninformation close.” But, the same could be said of almost every case. Potential\n\ndefendants in virtually every litigation have an incentive to withhold information\n\nthat might subject them to liability. Yet, we always require plaintiffs to exercise\n\ndiligence before they are entitled to equitable tolling; and as previously noted, the\n\nremedy is so rare that it could still be denied even if the plaintiff did exercise due\n\n\n                                           53\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015    Page: 54 of 60\n\n\ndiligence. Justice, 6 F.3d at 1479.\n\n      Whatever specific form “due diligence” could have taken on the facts of this\n\ncase (whether personal investigation or something else), if the diligence\n\nrequirement means anything at all, Mr. Villarreal must have at least done\n\nsomething. See id.; Pacheco, 966 F.2d at 907; cf. Drew, 297 F.3d at 1290 n.5\n\n(recognizing that equitable tolling is a remedy “that has always been reserved only\n\nfor parties who have pursued their rights diligently and whose untimeliness is due\n\nto factors entirely beyond their control;” consequently, a party seeking relief\n\ncannot have “‘slept on his rights’” and done “‘nothing for several years’”)\n\n(emphasis in original) (collecting cases). The record here is unchallenged that Mr.\n\nVillarreal did nothing until about two and a half years after his application was\n\nrejected, when he was first contacted by the attorneys investigating a possible class\n\naction suit against RJ Reynolds. As far as I can tell, neither this circuit nor any\n\nother court has ever tolled a statute of limitations in order to accommodate lawyers\n\nputting together a cause of action, and allowing tolling in such a situation\n\neffectively eviscerates the statute of limitations. Villarreal has not shown (or even\n\nalleged) that there was anything “extraordinary” which prevented him from\n\ninvestigating his claim (with or without an attorney) and then pursuing his rights\n\nwithin the limitations period. To follow the necessary logic of his argument, any\n\nplaintiff (in any type of lawsuit) who claims to have required the assistance of an\n\n\n                                          54\n\f               Case: 15-10602        Date Filed: 11/30/2015       Page: 55 of 60\n\n\nattorney to discover the existence of a claim—even those plaintiffs, like Villarreal,\n\nwho conduct absolutely no diligence at all—may be entitled to equitable tolling for\n\nan indefinite period of time. 12\n\n       It is telling that every case the majority has relied upon (save one) involved\n\nmisrepresentations and/or concealment by employer defendants. 13 Although I have\n\nagreed that equitable tolling does not necessarily require active misrepresentation\n\nor concealment by the employer [supra note 11], each of the cases cited by the\n\nmajority precisely involved misrepresentation or concealment. See, e.g., Jones v.\n\nDillard’s, Inc., 331 F.3d 1259 (11th Cir. 2003) (employer fired plaintiff after\n\nclaiming that her position was being eliminated, but she discovered more than 180\n\ndays later that the job had been filled with a younger person); Sturniolo v.\n\n\n       12\n           The majority tries to cabin its ruling to employment discrimination claims (particularly\nfailure-to-hire claims). It maintains that the law it announces today makes “good sense” because\njob applicants “may not know any relevant facts at the time of the discriminatory act.” However,\neven if that is true “at the time,” that does not excuse them from acting with diligence (as\nrequired by circuit precedent) and making an effort to learn the “relevant facts” thereafter. To\nthe extent the majority believes, as previously noted, that it would be “futile” for a plaintiff to\nconduct such an inquiry because a defendant would have “every incentive” to withhold evidence\nrelating to his misdeeds, the logic of that view would not only apply to discrimination statutes,\nbut could apply to virtually any civil action.\n       13\n           And, the one case that did not involve any misconduct by the employer, Browning v.\nAT&T Paradyne, 120 F.3d 222 (11th Cir. 1997), does not help Mr. Villarreal. While that case\ndid not have employer misconduct, it did involve the EEOC advising the plaintiff that his claim\nwas governed by an incorrect statute of limitations, after which he filed a claim that was\nuntimely by 18 days. This circuit concluded: “On this unique, specific set of facts, we hold, and\nour holding is a very narrow one, that the statute of limitations was tolled for the 18 days that\nHanna’s complaint was untimely.” Id. at 227 (emphasis added). By contrast, there are no\nallegations of misconduct or misinformation in this case (by either the company or the EEOC)\nthat prevented Mr. Villarreal from filing timely.\n\n                                                55\n\f               Case: 15-10602   Date Filed: 11/30/2015   Page: 56 of 60\n\n\nSheaffer, Eaton, Inc., 15 F.3d 1023 (11th Cir. 1994) (same); Cocke v. Merrill\n\nLynch & Co., Inc., 817 F.2d 1559 (11th Cir. 1987) (employer told plaintiff that he\n\nwas going to be terminated on a date certain, but that the company would continue\n\nto look for a position for him in the meantime; holding that tolling was appropriate\n\nas “[i]t is too much for the law to expect an employee to sue his employer for age\n\ndiscrimination at the same time he is led to believe the employer is trying to place\n\nhim in another job”). Importantly, all of these cases are rooted in Reeb, supra,\n\nwhere a female employee was falsely told that her job was not being renewed due\n\nto limited funds, after which she discovered (once the time to file with the EEOC\n\nhad passed) that her position had actually been filled by a less qualified male. The\n\ndefendant company, in other words, “actively sought to mislead” her. Reeb, 516\n\nF.2d at 930.\n\n      The common denominator in every one of these cases is that the employers\n\nmisrepresented or concealed information, and the plaintiffs were put in a situation\n\nwhere they confronted “two equally unattractive options”: file a claim when there\n\nwas at most “a mere suspicion,” in which case the litigation would be considered\n\npremature and would probably fail; or wait for “the surfacing of telltale evidence,”\n\ni.e., the hiring of a younger individual, in which case “the cunning employer will\n\nescape liability by postponing the hiring of a replacement for at least six months.”\n\nSee Jones, 331 F.3d at 1264. As this court has noted, the point of Reeb was simply\n\n\n                                         56\n\f             Case: 15-10602      Date Filed: 11/30/2015    Page: 57 of 60\n\n\nto “close the loophole” that was being used by such “malicious employers” to\n\navoid liability. Jones, 331 F.3d at 1264-65. Or, as the former Fifth Circuit\n\ndescribed it: “The rationale underlying [Reeb] is that it is unfair to allow a\n\ndefendant to conceal facts that support the plaintiff’s cause of action and then to\n\nrely on the statute of limitations to bar the suit when a duly diligent plaintiff was\n\nunable to discover those facts.” Chappell v. Emco Mach. Works, 601 F.2d 1295,\n\n1303 (5th Cir. 1979). The majority’s reliance on Reeb and its progeny is\n\nmisplaced on the facts presented here.\n\n      It makes sense to apply equitable tolling in the sort of cases described above\n\nsince it would be inequitable to allow an employer to take advantage of a statute of\n\nlimitations by misrepresenting or fraudulently concealing information that could\n\nhave put the employee on notice that his rights might have been violated. As the\n\nReeb court stated, “a party responsible for such wrongful concealment [should be]\n\nestopped from asserting the statute of limitations as a defense . . . [as] ‘no man may\n\ntake advantage of his own wrong.’” See Reeb, 516 F.2d at 930 (citation omitted).\n\nHowever, it makes absolutely no sense to apply tolling in a situation like the one\n\nhere, where there was no misconduct by RJ Reynolds that in any way contributed\n\nto Mr. Villarreal’s late filing. Unlike every one of the cases cited by the majority,\n\nthe company did not conceal facts, erect any barriers, or take advantage of a\n\n“loophole” to keep him from filing timely. Nor was he misled about the applicable\n\n\n                                           57\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015    Page: 58 of 60\n\n\nstatute of limitations. See supra note 13. Mr. Villarreal just did nothing—not even\n\nmake a phone call to see that his resume had been reviewed—for approximately\n\ntwo and a half years. To the extent the majority believes that equitable tolling is\n\navailable in cases like this one simply because people who are discriminated\n\nagainst in hiring do not have sufficient information to know they were victims of\n\ndiscrimination, that is hardly an unusual or extraordinary circumstance. As RJ\n\nReynolds has pointed out:\n\n             Accepting Villarreal’s argument would mean that the\n             limitations period in most every hiring case could be\n             tolled indefinitely, or at least until the plaintiff was\n             contacted by an attorney looking for clients to build a\n             class action. Equitable tolling would no longer be an\n             “extraordinary remedy”—it would become the norm.\n             That is not and should not be the law.\n\nThere are obvious reasons why today’s ruling “should not be the law,” including\n\nsome identified by the Seventh Circuit:\n\n             Statutes of limitations are not arbitrary obstacles to the\n             vindication of just claims, and therefore they should not\n             be given a grudging application. They protect important\n             social interests in certainty, accuracy, and repose. The\n             statute of limitations is short in age discrimination cases\n             as in most employment cases because delay in the\n             bringing of suit runs up the employer’s potential liability;\n             every day is one more day of backpay entitlements. We\n             should not trivialize the statute of limitations by\n             promiscuous application of tolling doctrines.\n\n\n                                          58\n\f              Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015     Page: 59 of 60\n\n\nCada v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 920 F.2d 446, 452-53 (7th Cir. 1990) (Posner,\n\nJ.).\n\n       I recognize that the majority is not necessarily saying that Mr. Villarreal will\n\nbe entitled to equitable tolling. Rather, it is saying that, at the motion to dismiss\n\nstage, he has adequately pled the applicability of the doctrine. He has not. Under\n\nBell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 127 S. Ct. 1955 (2007), and\n\nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S. Ct. 1937 (2009), Mr. Villarreal must allege\n\nsufficient facts, taken as true, that state a “plausible” claim for equitable tolling.\n\nAlthough he makes a boilerplate allegation in his amended complaint that a\n\nreasonably prudent person in his position would not have suspected the company’s\n\ndiscriminatory hiring practices until he was contacted by the lawyers, that is not\n\nenough. See, e.g., Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (“A pleading that offers ‘labels and\n\nconclusions’ or ‘a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not\n\ndo.’ Nor does a complaint suffice if it tenders ‘naked assertion[s]’ devoid of\n\n‘further factual enhancement.’”) (quoting Twombly). Villarreal alleges no facts\n\nsuggesting that there was anything “extraordinary” here. There is nothing about\n\nthis case that is particularly unique or different than any other failure-to-hire case.\n\nThe District Court gave Villarreal an opportunity to meet the Twombly and Iqbal\n\nstandard, but he was not able to do so. In fact, rather than setting forth a plausible\n\nclaim for equitable tolling, the amended complaint conclusively establishes that\n\n\n                                           59\n\f               Case: 15-10602        Date Filed: 11/30/2015       Page: 60 of 60\n\n\ntolling is not appropriate. It bears repeating once more that the amended complaint\n\nmakes clear that Villarreal not only failed to conduct any inquiry into why he was\n\nnot hired, but it expressly states that he did not even contact RJ Reynolds to see\n\n“whether his application had been reviewed at all.” It is, quite frankly, hard to\n\nimagine a plaintiff acting with less diligence and prudent regard for his rights. 14\n\n                                               III.\n\n       For the reasons stated above, I believe the District Court should be affirmed.\n\nI must respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n       14\n           Because the majority accepted Mr. Villarreal’s equitable tolling argument, it found it\nunnecessary to reach his alternative argument pursuant to the “continuing violation doctrine.” I\nwill not do so either.\n\n\n                                                60\n\f",

He alleges that RJ Reynolds\n\nTobacco Company discriminated against him on the basis of age when it rejected\n\nhis application for employment. This appeal raises two important questions. The\n\nfirst is a question of first impression in this Circuit: whether § 4(a)(2) of the\n\nADEA, 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(2), authorizes disparate impact claims by applicants for\n\nemployment. We hold that it does, though not because the language of the statute\n\nplainly requires this reading. In fact, the statute is unclear on this question.\n\nHowever, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency\n\ncharged with enforcing the ADEA, has reasonably and consistently interpreted the\n\nstatute to cover claims like Mr. Villarreal’s. We must defer to that reading rather\n\nthan venture our own guess about what the statute means. The second question is\n\nwhether Mr. Villarreal is entitled to equitable tolling of the ADEA’s limitations\n\nperiod. We conclude that he is, and reverse the judgment of the District Court for\n\nboth of these reasons.\n\n\n\n\n       *\n          Honorable C. Roger Vinson, United States District Judge for the Northern District of\nFlorida, sitting by designation.\n\n                                                2\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015   Page: 3 of 60\n\n\n                                         I.\n\n      RJ Reynolds employs regional sales representatives known as Territory\n\nManagers. With the assistance of recruiting services, the company used a set of\n\n“resume review guidelines” in screening applicants for these positions. These\n\nguidelines list a number of characteristics RJ Reynolds wanted in its new hires,\n\nsome of which relate to age. For example, the guidelines tell hiring managers to\n\ntarget candidates who are “2–3 years out of college” but to “stay away from”\n\ncandidates with “8–10 years” of prior sales experience. As it turns out, RJ\n\nReynolds’s hiring statistics suggest a pattern of hiring younger applicants. Of the\n\n1,024 people hired as Territory Managers from September 2007 to July 2010, only\n\n19 were over the age of 40.\n\n      Mr. Villarreal first applied for a Territory Manager position in November\n\n2007 by submitting an online application. He was 49 years old at the time. RJ\n\nReynolds never responded to his application. Over two years later, on May 17,\n\n2010, Mr. Villarreal filed a charge of unlawful discrimination with the Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), alleging that RJ Reynolds had\n\ndiscriminated against him on the basis of his age. The timing of this charge is\n\nrelevant to Mr. Villarreal’s federal lawsuit because the ADEA requires a person to\n\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\f                Case: 15-10602       Date Filed: 11/30/2015        Page: 4 of 60\n\n\nfile a charge of discrimination within 180 days of the discriminatory act. 1 29\n\nU.S.C. § 626(d)(1)(A). Compliance with this 180-day limitations period is a\n\n“prerequisite” to bringing a federal suit. McClinton v. Ala. By-Prods.

He amended his charge of discrimination to add these\n\napplications and rejections. Finally, on April 2, 2012, the EEOC declined to take\n\nfurther action against RJ Reynolds, and issued Mr. Villarreal a right-to-sue notice.\n\n       Mr. Villarreal next filed this lawsuit, raising both disparate treatment\n\n(discriminatory intent) and disparate impact (discriminatory result) claims under\n\nthe ADEA on behalf of himself and all other similarly situated applicants. The\n\ncomplaint acknowledged that Mr. Villarreal’s charge of discrimination had been\n\nfiled more than 180 days after his initial November 2007 application. However,\n\nMr. Villarreal says the limitations period should be equitably tolled until April\n\n2010 because “[t]he facts necessary to support [his] charge of discrimination were\n\nnot apparent to him, and could not have been apparent to him, until less than a\n\nmonth before he filed his May 17, 2010 EEOC charge.”\n\n       1\n         The limitations period is extended to 300 days if there exists a state agency equivalent\nto the EEOC.

First, it\n\ndismissed Mr. Villarreal’s disparate impact claim entirely, finding that the ADEA\n\nonly allows suits for disparate impact claims brought by current employees, as\n\nopposed to applicants for employment like Mr. Villarreal. Second, it dismissed all\n\nclaims related to hiring decisions before November 19, 2009, as untimely. 2 The\n\nDistrict Court found that Mr. Villarreal was not entitled to equitable tolling for his\n\nNovember 2007 allegations because “[t]he Complaint does not specify which facts\n\nPlaintiff came to know in 2010, or how Plaintiff came to know them.”\n\n       Following the District Court’s ruling, Mr. Villarreal moved to amend his\n\ncomplaint to add facts in support of his equitable tolling argument. Mr.\n\nVillarreal’s proposed amended complaint alleged that he had not known about RJ\n\nReynolds’s process for reviewing applications or its use of the resume review\n\nguidelines until he spoke with lawyers from Altshuler Berzon in April 2010.\n\nIndeed, RJ Reynolds never responded one way or the other to Mr. Villarreal’s 2007\n\napplication, so “[h]e did not even know whether his application had been reviewed\n\nat all, much less whether it had been rejected or screened out.”\n\n       The District Court found that the amendment would be futile and denied Mr.\n\nVillarreal leave to amend his complaint. It explained that Mr. Villarreal’s\n       2\n         November 19, 2009, is 180 days before Mr. Villarreal filed his charge of discrimination\nwith the EEOC. The District Court’s timeliness ruling applied to all plaintiffs in the collective\naction. See Hipp v. Liberty Nat’l Life Ins.

And second, he\n\nfailed to allege any misrepresentation or concealment by RJ Reynolds.\n\n      Mr. Villarreal voluntarily dismissed his remaining claim and filed this\n\nappeal, challenging the District Court’s rulings on both his disparate impact claim\n\nand equitable tolling. We consider each argument in turn.\n\n                                          II.\n\n      We first address whether § 4(a) of the ADEA authorizes disparate impact\n\nclaims by people applying for jobs. Unlawful discrimination takes two forms:\n\ndisparate treatment and disparate impact. In the employment context, disparate\n\ntreatment happens when an employer treats some people less favorably because of\n\na protected characteristic, such as race, religion, sex, or in our case, age. To prove\n\nthis type of claim, a plaintiff must establish that the employer had the intent to\n\ndiscriminate. Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109665\"><a href=\"/opinion/109665/teamsters-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">324</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 335 n.15, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109665\"><a href=\"/opinion/109665/teamsters-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.

In contrast, disparate impact happens when an\n\nemployer uses “practices that are facially neutral in their treatment of different\n\ngroups but that in fact fall more harshly on one group than another.” Id. No proof\n\nof discriminatory intent is required for disparate impact claims. Id.\n\n      In Smith v.

Smith was a case in which older employees had received smaller salary\n\nincreases than their younger colleagues. Id. at 230, 125 S. Ct. at 1539. Because\n\nSmith involved only claims of current employees, it did not answer the question\n\nwe face here: whether job applicants may bring disparate impact claims as well.\n\n                                              A.\n\n      As always, statutory interpretation begins with the language of the statute. If\n\nthe statutory language is clear, then our inquiry ends. King v. Burwell, __ U.S. __,\n\n__, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2811845\"><a href=\"/opinion/2811845/king-v-burwell/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

If the agency has\n\ninterpreted the ambiguity reasonably, then we defer to its view. See id.\n\n      Section 4(a) of the ADEA makes it unlawful for an employer:\n\n      (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise\n      discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,\n      terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such\n      individual’s age; [or]\n\n      (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any way which\n      would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment\n      opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee,\n      because of such individual’s age\n\n29 U.S.C. § 623(a). Smith noted “key textual differences” between these two\n\nprovisions. Smith, 544 U.S. at 236 n.6, 125 S. Ct. at 1542 n.6 (plurality opinion).\n\nFirst, the two provisions treat motive differently. Subsection (a)(1) makes it\n\n\n                                          7\n\f              Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015   Page: 8 of 60\n\n\nunlawful to “discriminate against any individual . . . because of such individual’s\n\nage.” This provision focuses on the employer’s (discriminatory) motives, and is\n\nthe part of § 4(a) that authorizes disparate treatment claims. See Smith, 544 U.S. at\n\n236, 125 S. Ct. at 1542. Subsection (a)(2) targets employer conduct that “would\n\ndeprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise\n\nadversely affect his status as an employee.” This provision “focuses on the effects\n\nof the action on the employee rather than the motivation for the action of the\n\nemployer,” so it is the part of § 4(a) that authorizes disparate impact claims. Id.\n\nSmith identified only this difference between the two sections of the statute. See\n\nid. at 236 & n.6, 125 S. Ct. at 1542 & n.6.\n\n      However another possible difference is the description of who can sue under\n\neach section. Both subsections use the term “any individual.” But they use it in\n\ndifferent contexts. Subsection (4)(a)(1) makes it unlawful “to fail or refuse to hire\n\nor to discharge any individual.” The verb “hire” makes clear that “any individual”\n\nincludes job applicants. But § 4(a)(1) does not authorize disparate impact claims,\n\nso Mr. Villarreal’s argument is based on § 4(a)(2). Subsection 4(a)(2) also refers\n\nto “any individual.” Again, this section makes it unlawful for an employer “to\n\nlimit, segregate, or classify his employees in any way which would deprive or tend\n\nto deprive any individual of employment opportunities.” This section targets\n\nexactly three categories of conduct: an employer’s actions that “limit, segregate, or\n\n\n                                          8\n\f              Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015   Page: 9 of 60\n\n\nclassify his employees.” Within those three categories, the liability sweeps wide:\n\nany action that “would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment\n\nopportunities.” This is the very phrase that authorizes disparate impact liability,\n\nand the object of these verbs is the expansive term “any individual.”\n\n      This language has provoked the disagreement before us. Mr. Villarreal\n\nreads § 4(a)(2) to plainly cover his allegations. He notes that § 4(a)(2) makes it\n\nunlawful for an employer “to limit . . . his employees in any way which would\n\ndeprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities . . . because\n\nof such individual’s age.” 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(2). He says RJ Reynolds “limited”\n\nits “employees” in a “way which would deprive or tend to deprive” an “individual”\n\nlike him “of employment opportunities” because of his age. RJ Reynolds, in turn,\n\ndirects us to the earlier term “his employees.” It says the later reference to “any\n\nindividual” only includes these employees. RJ Reynolds reads § 4(a)(2) to cover\n\nonly things a company does to “limit, segregate, or classify” its employees in a\n\nway that would deprive those employees of employment opportunities.\n\n       Both of these readings seem reasonable. That being the case, the plain\n\nlanguage of the statute does not make clear whether job applicants like Mr.\n\nVillarreal may bring disparate impact claims. But before analyzing whether we\n\ncan defer to the agency’s reading, we take stock of a few other arguments for each\n\ninterpretation. These arguments underscore that § 4(a)(2) can reasonably be read\n\n\n                                          9\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015    Page: 10 of 60\n\n\nin more than one way.\n\n                                          1.\n\n      In support of his reading, Mr. Villarreal points to the landmark decision\n\nGriggs v.

In Griggs the\n\nSupreme Court unanimously held that the plain text of § 703(a)(2) of Title VII of\n\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964 authorized disparate impact liability. The language\n\ninterpreted in Griggs was identical to the language of § 4(a)(2) except that it\n\naddressed discrimination based on “an individual’s race, color, age, religion, sex,\n\nor nationality” rather than “an individual’s age.”\n\n      When the Supreme Court held in Smith that the plain text of § 4(a)(2) of the\n\nADEA also authorized disparate impact liability, its analysis started with Griggs.\n\nThe Court framed the question before it as “whether the ‘disparate-impact’ theory\n\nof recovery announced in Griggs . . . is cognizable under the ADEA.” 544 U.S. at\n\n230, 125 S. Ct. at 1539. And the Court’s answer to this question “beg[a]n with the\n\npremise that when Congress uses the same language in two statutes having similar\n\npurposes, particularly when one is enacted shortly after the other, it is appropriate\n\nto presume that Congress intended that text to have the same meaning in both\n\nstatutes.” Id. at 233, 125 S. Ct. at 1541 (plurality opinion).\n\n      As we noted, Smith involved disparate impact claims brought only by\n\ncurrent employees. In Griggs, it is not as clear who won relief.

RJ Reynolds responds that all the references in Griggs to “applicants”\n\nand “hiring” concerned current employees seeking promotions or transfers, not job\n\napplicants. Either way, Griggs did not directly tell us whether the identical Title\n\nVII language covers job applicants. Neither has the Court had a chance to address\n\nthis question since. That is because the year after the Griggs decision, Congress\n\nchanged the relevant language of Title VII from “his employees” to “his\n\nemployees or applicants for employment.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(2). We know\n\nthat Griggs did not decide whether Title VII applies to job applicants, so it does not\n\nrequire us to adopt Mr. Villarreal’s reading of § 4(a)(2). That said, the Supreme\n\nCourt’s repeated references to job applicants and its continued characterization of\n\nGriggs as covering job applicants tells us at least that this reading is reasonable.\n\n                                                 2.\n\n       Title VII relates to the question before us in another way: in 1972, Congress\n\namended that statute to add the words “or applicants for employment” to the\n\nlanguage that parallels § 4(a)(2) of the ADEA. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(2).\n\nCongress has not amended § 4(a)(2) of the ADEA in the same way. Because\n\n\n“potential . . . employees” and “potential . . . hirees”); United States v. Ga.

Specifically, the Gross opinion derived two things from\n\nthe fact that Congress did not amend the ADEA when it enacted the 1991 Title VII\n\namendments. First, the Court noted that in 1991 Congress had\n\n“contemporaneously amended the ADEA in several ways.” Id. It explained that\n\n“negative implications raised by disparate provisions are strongest when the\n\nprovisions were considered simultaneously when the language raising the\n\nimplication was inserted.” Id. at 175, 129 S. Ct. at 2349 (quotation omitted). But\n\nthis lesson only goes so far, because we know that Congress did not amend the\n\nADEA in 1972 when it amended Title VII to include “applicants for employment.”\n\n      Second, the 1991 amendment to Title VII was enacted to override the\n\nSupreme Court’s interpretation of statutory language. See id. Since Congress was\n\nrejecting the Court’s interpretation of Title VII, it made sense to assume that\n\nCongress knew the Court’s interpretation would apply to the ADEA language it\n\n\n                                          13\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015   Page: 14 of 60\n\n\nleft untouched. But the 1972 amendment was not enacted to reject the Supreme\n\nCourt’s interpretation of the language at issue here. To the contrary, the Senate\n\nCommittee on Labor and Public Welfare explained that the change to “[t]his\n\nsubsection would merely be declaratory of present law.” S. Rep. No. 92-415, at 43\n\n(1971). And the parallel House Report explained the change by quoting\n\nextensively from Griggs and declaring that “[t]he provisions of the bill are fully in\n\naccord with the decision” in Griggs. H.R. Rep. No. 92-238, at 21–22 (1971).\n\n      Congress has all kinds of reasons for passing laws, and presumably all kinds\n\nof reasons for not passing laws as well. The 1972 change to Title VII was part of a\n\nbroad revamp of the statute aimed at expanding the jurisdiction and power of the\n\nEEOC. See George P. Sape & Thomas J. Hart, Title VII Reconsidered: The Equal\n\nOpportunity Act of 1972, 40 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 824 (1972). When Congress\n\nundertook these changes the ADEA was administered by the Secretary of Labor,\n\nnot the EEOC. See 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000e-4 (1978). We will not assume that\n\nCongress chose not to pass legislation modifying the ADEA simply because it did\n\nmake this one change in a broader restructuring of Title VII.\n\n                                          3.\n\n      RJ Reynolds asks us to treat Smith in much the same way Mr. Villarreal asks\n\nus to treat Griggs. But as we’ve said, Smith did not involve disparate impact\n\nclaims by job applicants. Neither did the Smith plaintiffs (like the Griggs\n\n\n                                          14\n\f               Case: 15-10602        Date Filed: 11/30/2015       Page: 15 of 60\n\n\nplaintiffs) challenge policies that harmed both job applicants and current\n\nemployees. While we recognize that the two concurring opinions in Smith\n\nreferenced the fact that § 4(a)(2) does not expressly mention job applicants,4 it is\n\nalso true that the issue of whether applicants can bring disparate impact claims was\n\nneither argued by the parties nor relevant to the case. At most, the dicta in Smith’s\n\nconcurrences, like that in Griggs, tells us that RJ Reynolds offers one reasonable\n\n\n\n\n       4\n         Justice O’Connor noted that “[s]ection 4(a)(2), of course, does not apply to ‘applicants\nfor employment’ at all—it is only § 4(a)(1) that protects this group.” 544 U.S. at 266, 125 S. Ct.\nat 1559 (O’Connor, J., concurring). Justice Scalia responded by noting that “perhaps the\nagency’s attempt to sweep employment applications into the disparate-impact prohibition is\nmistaken.” Id. at 246 n.3, 125 S. Ct. at 1548 n.3 (Scalia, J., concurring).\n\n        The dissent suggests that other Justices in Smith endorsed Justice O’Connor’s dicta\nbecause “nobody disagreed with her.” The dissent then quotes our observation that “there is\ndicta, and then there is Supreme Court dicta.” Schwab v. Crosby, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77360\"><a href=\"/opinion/77360/mark-dean-schwab-v-james-v-crosby-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1308</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1325 (11th Cir.\n2006). Along the same lines: there is dicta in a binding opinion and there is dicta in a\nnonbinding concurrence. It’s one thing to abide by dicta that is “three long, citation-laden\nparagraphs” of “well thought out, thoroughly reasoned, and carefully articulated analysis” in a\nmajority opinion, as Schwab did. Id. It’s another to do the same for a single sentence in a\nminority opinion, via the assumption that other Justices implicitly approved of this sentence.\n\n        As for the Smith plurality, the dissent points to a footnote in this opinion comparing\n§ 4(a)(1)’s focus on an employer’s motives to § 4(a)(2)’s focus on the effects of an employer’s\nactions. The dissent quotes a passage from this footnote that explains how § 4(a)(2) operates for\nclaims brought by current employees. But this passage doesn’t exclude § 4(a)(2) from applying\nto other kinds of claims. The Court was simply explaining how the statute works for claims like\nthe ones then before them. And the plurality even cited cases brought by job applicants to\ndeclare that “for over two decades after our decision in Griggs, the Courts of Appeals uniformly\ninterpreted the ADEA as authorizing recovery on a ‘disparate-impact’ theory in appropriate\ncases.” 544 U.S. at 236–37 & n.8, 125 S.

For example, section 4(c)(2) makes it\n\nunlawful for a labor organization to “limit, segregate, or classify its membership”\n\nin any way that “adversely affect[s] [an individual’s] status as an employee or as\n\nan applicant for employment.” 29 U.S.C. § 623(c)(2). Section 4(d) extends the\n\nADEA’s retaliation protections to “applicants for employment” and “applicant[s]\n\nfor membership” in a labor organization. Id. § 631(d). And section 12(b)\n\ndescribes age limits for “any personnel action affecting employees or applicants for\n\nemployment.” Id. § 631(b). Finally, section 15 describes protections for\n\n“employees or applicants for employment,” “employees and applicants for\n\nemployment,” and “an employee or applicant for employment.” Id. §§ 633(a)–(b).\n\n\n       5\n         As for the dicta from other circuits that the dissent cites, the first of these cases\ndistinguished the ADEA from Title VII by explaining that “the basis for the Supreme Court’s\nholding in Griggs” was Title VII’s reference to “employees or applicants.” E.E.O.C. v. Francis\nW. Parker Sch., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"683544\"><a href=\"/opinion/683544/equal-employment-opportunity-commission-v-francis-w-parker-school/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1073</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1077 (7th Cir. 1994). As discussed above, this language was\nadded to Title VII after Griggs. The two other cases cited by the dissent both relied on Francis\nW. Parker. This is the problem with dicta: when an issue is superfluous, even obvious errors\nescape notice.\n\n                                               16\n\f               Case: 15-10602       Date Filed: 11/30/2015       Page: 17 of 60\n\n\nRJ Reynolds tells us these provisions show that Congress knew how to reference\n\njob applicants and intentionally chose not to in § 4(a)(2).\n\n       But in contrast to § (4)(a)(1) and these other provisions referenced by RJ\n\nReynolds, § 4(a)(2) does not reference applicants for employment, and uses the\n\ngeneral term “any individual.” 6 We know that “‘any’ is a powerful and broad\n\nword. It does not mean some or all but a few, but instead means all.” United\n\nStates v. Fleet, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77821\"><a href=\"/opinion/77821/united-states-v-fleet/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1225</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1229 (11th Cir. 2007). Still, we cannot ignore that\n\nCongress expressly protected applicants for employment in other provisions of the\n\nADEA but declined to do so in § 4(a)(2). After all, “Congress generally acts\n\nintentionally when it uses particular language in one section of a statute but omits\n\nit in another.” Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. MacLean, __ U.S. __, __, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2771753\"><a href=\"/opinion/2771753/department-of-homeland-security-v-maclean/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

And this “interpretive canon . . . applies with particular force”\n\nwhen Congress uses an omitted phrase elsewhere in “close proximity.” Id.\n\n       That said, this interpretive canon does little to reveal whether Congress used\n\n       6\n          At least some of the specific references to job applicants or hiring in other provisions\nmay be explainable. For example, Mr. Villarreal argues that the prohibition on labor union\npractices that harm an individual’s “status as an employee or as an applicant for employment” is\nmeant to address the unique way that certain unions influence someone’s “status” as a job\napplicant specifically by referring employers to applicants through union hiring halls. True or\nnot, this point underscores the danger of trying to guess why Congress chose broad or ambiguous\nterms based on guesses about why it chose specific terms on other occasions. For this reason,\nthe “presumption” of uniform usage “is not rigid and readily yields whenever there is such\nvariation in the connection in which the words are used as reasonably to warrant the conclusion\nthat they were employed in different parts of the act with different intent.” Gen.

Congress’s concern for older\n\njob applicants was evident in a report written by the Department of Labor that led\n\nCongress to enact the ADEA. See U.S. Dep’t of Labor, The Older American\n\nWorker: Age Discrimination in Employment (1965). This report specifically\n\n\n       7\n          In addition, the next subsection of the statute uses the term “any individual” to refer\nsolely to job applicants. See 29 U.S.C. § 623(b). This section makes it “unlawful for an\nemployment agency to fail or refuse to refer for employment, or otherwise to discriminate\nagainst, any individual.” Id. (emphasis added). The ADEA’s definition section later explains\nthat employment agencies solely work with applicants for employments. See id. § 630(c).\n\n                                                 18\n\f              Case: 15-10602      Date Filed: 11/30/2015   Page: 19 of 60\n\n\ndescribed how seemingly neutral employment practices – including practices like\n\nthe screening guidelines challenged by Mr. Villarreal – can impose a disparate\n\nburden on older job applicants. See id. at 3 (“Any formal employment standard\n\nwhich requires, for example, a high school diploma will obviously work against\n\nthe employment of many older workers.”); see also id. at 12 (“Even for many plant\n\nproduction jobs in the major industries, employers for a variety of reasons seek\n\nyoung workers with high school educations or equivalent vocational training.”). In\n\nthis way the report seemed to predict the disparate impact idea that Griggs made\n\nlaw seven years later. The report further analyzed the discriminatory effects of\n\n“institutional arrangements that indirectly restrict the employment of older\n\nworkers,” id. at 15, as well as “employment practices which quite unintentionally\n\nlead to age limits in hiring,” id. at 22.\n\n       The report proposed legislation which was ultimately enacted as the ADEA.\n\nThe ADEA clearly states that one of its purposes is to “promote [the] employment\n\nof older persons based on their ability rather than age.” 29 U.S.C. § 621(b). It also\n\ndeclares that “older workers find themselves disadvantaged in their efforts . . .\n\nespecially to regain employment when displaced from jobs” and that “the\n\nincidence of unemployment, especially long-term unemployment . . . is, relative to\n\nthe younger ages, high among older workers; their numbers are great and growing;\n\nand their employment problems grave.” 29 U.S.C. § 621(a).\n\n\n                                            19\n\f               Case: 15-10602       Date Filed: 11/30/2015       Page: 20 of 60\n\n\n       Mr. Villarreal relies on these statements to argue that Congress intended for\n\n§ 4(a)(2) to protect both current employees and prospective job applicants.8 We\n\nagree that these statements show that Congress enacted the ADEA to address\n\ndiscriminatory hiring. But neither these statements of purpose nor the statute’s\n\nlegislative history tell us what type of claim (disparate treatment, disparate impact,\n\nor both) an applicant for employment can bring. We decline to answer this\n\nquestion through inferences about the ADEA’s general purpose.\n\n                                        *        *     *\n\n       Because the text of § 4(a)(2) does not clearly resolve the issue in this case,\n\nwe ask the question we must when faced with a vague statute: has the agency\n\ntasked with enforcing the statute given a reasonable reading?\n\n                                            B.\n\n       Subsection § 4(a)(2) of the ADEA clearly authorizes disparate impact\n\nclaims. What is less clear is whether its reference to “any individual” includes job\n\napplicants, or whether the separate term “his employees” limits the entire provision\n\n\n       8\n          Meanwhile, RJ Reynolds points to other legislative history suggesting that Congress did\nnot intend § 4(a)(2) to cover job applicants. For example, one legislative document explained\nthat § 4(a)(2) would make it unlawful “[t]o limit, segregate, or classify employees so as to\ndeprive them of employment opportunities or adversely affect their status.” 113 Cong. Rec.\n31,250 (1967) (emphases added). RJ Reynolds argues that this document proves that Congress\ndid not want § 4(a)(2) to cover job applicants. But then again, maybe this document proves the\ncontrary: maybe it shows that at least one person in or around Congress knew how to\nunambiguously limit § 4(a)(2) to current employees but Congress itself enacted broader\nlanguage.\n\n                                               20\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015    Page: 21 of 60\n\n\nto current employees.

Instead, it states that, “[a]ny employment\n\n\n                                             21\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015    Page: 22 of 60\n\n\npractice that adversely affects individuals within the protected age group on the\n\nbasis of older age is discriminatory unless the practice is justified by a ‘reasonable\n\nfactor other than age.’” 29 C.F.R. § 1625.7(c).

First, the company claims 29 C.F.R. § 1625.7 is not\n\nrelevant to this case because it interprets a separate provision of the ADEA.\n\nSecond, it argues that the regulation does not clearly address the question in this\n\ncase. We address each of these arguments in turn. In doing so, we are mindful\n\nthat even if we assume that 29 C.F.R. § 1625.7 is ambiguous by virtue of an\n\ninferred limitation on its broad phrase “individuals within the protected age\n\ngroup,” we still owe deference to the EEOC’s view because the agency has\n\nreasonably and consistently insisted on this view for decades.\n\n\n                                          22\n\f             Case: 15-10602      Date Filed: 11/30/2015    Page: 23 of 60\n\n\n                                           1.\n\n      RJ Reynolds argues that 29 C.F.R. § 1625.7 is not entitled to deference on\n\nthe question of whether § 4(a)(2) permits disparate impact liability for applicants\n\nbecause this regulation concerns a separate provision of the ADEA. The company\n\nargues that 29 C.F.R. §1625.7 merely applies the “reasonable factor other than\n\nage” (RFOA) defense from Section 4(f)(1) to ADEA liability, rather than\n\nproviding a basis for disparate impact liability, which comes from § 4(a)(2).\n\n      But we read Smith to foreclose this argument. Because the Smith plurality\n\nfound that the text of § 4(a)(2) plainly authorizes disparate impact liability, it was\n\nnot necessary for a majority of Justices to analyze whether and how courts must\n\ndefer to the EEOC’s disparate impact regulation. The plurality did reference this\n\nregulation to explain why the RFOA provision cannot be understood separate from\n\nthe statutory scheme as a whole. See 544 U.S. at 239–40, 125 S. Ct. at 1544\n\n(plurality opinion). The plurality also explained that EEOC has “consistently\n\ninterpreted the ADEA to authorize relief on a disparate-impact theory” and that 29\n\nC.F.R. § 1625.7 “set[s] forth the standards for a disparate-impact claim.” Id.\n\n      Justice Scalia joined the Court’s holding that the ADEA permits disparate\n\nimpact liability, but he reached his view by way of deference to 29 CFR § 1625.7.\n\nHe first explained why 29 CFR § 1625.7 deserves deference as an interpretation of\n\n§ 4(a)(2):\n\n\n                                          23\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015    Page: 24 of 60\n\n\n      As [the] text [of § 4(f)(1)] makes clear, the RFOA defense is relevant only as\n      a response to employer actions “otherwise prohibited” by the ADEA.\n      Hence, the unavoidable meaning of the regulation at issue is that the ADEA\n      prohibits employer actions that have an “adverse impact on individuals\n      within the protected age group.” 29 CFR § 1625.7(d) (2004). And, of\n      course, the only provision of the ADEA that could conceivably be\n      interpreted to effect such a prohibition is § 4(a)(2).\n\nId. at 246, 125 S. Ct. at 1548 (Scalia, J., concurring). Justice Scalia then specified\n\nwhy the regulation’s interpretation of “otherwise prohibited” deserved deference,\n\neven though the regulation was focused on interpreting the term “reasonable\n\nfactors other than age.” In doing so, he responded to Justice O’Connor’s view:\n\n      Justice O’Connor . . . argues that the EEOC’s interpretation of what is\n      “otherwise prohibited” by the ADEA is not entitled to deference because the\n      Court concludes that the same regulation’s interpretation of another term . . .\n      is unreasonable. Her logic seems to be that, because the two interpretations\n      appear in the same paragraph, they should stand or fall together. She cites\n      no case for this proposition, and it makes little sense. If the two\n      simultaneously adopted interpretations were contained in distinct\n      paragraphs, the invalidation of one would not, of course, render the other\n      infirm. . . . I can conceive no basis for a different rule simply because the\n      two simultaneously adopted interpretations appear in the same paragraph.\n\nId.\n\n      Although Smith addressed a slightly different question than we have here,\n\nour study of it causes us to reject RJ Reynolds’s argument “that the RFOA clause\n\noperates independently of the remainder of the ADEA.” Id. at 245, 125 S. Ct. at\n\n1548. Although 29 CFR § 1625.7 is primarily analyzing “reasonable factor other\n\nthan age” not “any individual,” we “can conceive no basis” to ignore the\n\nregulation’s broad and unambiguous interpretation of this latter term “simply\n                                          24\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015    Page: 25 of 60\n\n\nbecause the two simultaneously adopted interpretations appear in the same\n\nparagraph.” Id. at 247, 125 S. Ct. at 1549. Smith establishes that 29 CFR § 1625.7\n\n“set[s] forth the standards for a disparate-impact claim.” Id. at 240, 125 S. Ct. at\n\n1544 (plurality opinion). We owe deference to these standards to the extent they\n\nare reasonable, and they are.\n\n                                          2.\n\n      RJ Reynolds also argues that 29 C.F.R. § 1625.7 is not entitled to deference\n\non the question of whether § 4(a)(2) permits disparate impact liability for\n\napplicants because the regulation does not address this question clearly. As we’ve\n\nsaid, this regulation describes the standard for challenging an “employment\n\npractice that adversely affects individuals within the protected age group.” 29\n\nC.F.R. § 1625.7(c). RJ Reynolds claims the expansive term “individuals” is\n\nambiguous as to the question in this case.\n\n      However, the preamble to the final regulations makes clear that the term\n\n“individuals” covers both employees and applicants. The preamble gives a number\n\nof examples of cases involving job applicants. See 77 Fed. Reg. 19080, 19084\n\n(2012) (describing a test for “candidates for jobs”); id. at 19086 (describing a test\n\nfor “applicants for security guard positions”); id. at 19087 (describing how “an\n\nemployer seeking to hire individuals with technological skills could instruct\n\ndecision makers” in a way that can “help to overcome age-based stereotypes”).\n\n\n                                          25\n\f               Case: 15-10602       Date Filed: 11/30/2015       Page: 26 of 60\n\n\nThe preamble’s list of “benefits of the rule” then declares that the regulation will\n\naddress “neutral practices that act as barriers to the employment of older workers”:\n\n       Data show that older individuals who become unemployed have more\n       difficulty finding a new position and tend to stay unemployed longer than\n       younger individuals. To the extent that the difficulty in finding new work is\n       attributable to neutral practices that act as barriers to the employment of\n       older workers, the regulation should help to reduce the rate of their\n       unemployment and, thus, help to reduce these unique burdens on society.\n\nId. at 19092 (footnote omitted). The EEOC’s interpretation is “a reasonable\n\nextrapolation of its regulations” and we defer to it “in light of its experience and\n\nexpertise in protecting those covered by the Act.” Holowecki, 552 U.S. at 398,\n\n128 S.

First, the regulation in Holowecki also used the\nsame “term Congress used in the underlying statute.” Holowecki, 552 U.S at 398, 128 S. Ct. at\n1156. But the Court distinguished Gonzales by noting that the EEOC had consistently and\nreasonably advanced the same view for years. See id. at 399, 128 S. Ct. at 1156. As we discuss\nin section II.B.3, the EEOC has done the same here, so its view is “entitled to a ‘measure of\nrespect’ under the less deferential Skidmore standard.” Id.\n\n        Second, the Gonzales regulation parroted the statutory terms “course of professional\npractice” and “legitimate medical purpose.” Gonzales, 546 U.S. at 257, 126 S. Ct. at 916. These\n\n                                               26\n\f               Case: 15-10602        Date Filed: 11/30/2015       Page: 27 of 60\n\n\n                                                3.\n\n       Finally, there is another reason to defer to the EEOC’s view on the scope of\n\ndisparate impact liability under the ADEA. Days after the ADEA went into effect,\n\nthe Department of Labor, which initially enforced the statute, clarified that neutral\n\n“pre-employment” tests must be “reasonably necessary for the specific work to be\n\nperformed” and “equally applied to all applicants.” 33 Fed. Reg. 9173 (1968).10\n\nAnd, in 1981, once the EEOC took over enforcing the statute, it made its view on\n\nthe scope of disparate impact liability clear in a regulation issued though notice-\n\nand-comment rulemaking:\n\n       When an employment practice, including a test, is claimed as a basis for\n       different treatment of employees or applicants for employment on the\n       grounds that it is a “factor other than” age, and such a practice has an\n       adverse impact on individuals within the protected age group, it can only be\n\n\ntwo terms did not clearly answer the question in the case. In contrast, RJ Reynolds does not\nclaim here that the statutory term “any individual” is by itself unclear. Instead, the company\nargues this term should be limited by the separate term “his employees.” The regulation imposes\nno such limitation. It simply prohibits “[a]ny employment practice that adversely affects\nindividuals within the protected age group on the basis of older age.” For this reason, the text of\nthe regulation lacks the ambiguity in the statute. So, even if we were to assume that the\nregulation was somehow still ambiguous, Auer requires us to defer to the EEOC’s clarification\nof this ambiguity. See Holowecki, 552 U.S at 398–99, 128 S.

The\nEEOC offered this alternative argument after noting that the Seventh Circuit “has already\ninterpreted the language of subsection 4(a)(1) to authorize the use of disparate impact in Title\nVII.” Id.

This is well outside the 180-day limitations period. 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 626(d)(1)(a). However, Mr. Villarreal has alleged that he was entitled to\n\nequitable tolling because he did not know—nor could he have known—that he had\n\nbeen discriminated against until April 2010, when he was informed about the\n\nresume review guidelines and RJ Reynolds’s hiring practices.\n\n      The District Court rejected this argument. It found that Mr. Villarreal was\n\nnot entitled to equitable tolling because he did not allege either that RJ Reynolds\n\nhad misrepresented relevant facts or that he had diligently pursued his rights by\n\n\n                                          30\n\f               Case: 15-10602       Date Filed: 11/30/2015      Page: 31 of 60\n\n\nasking the company why he had not been hired.

In Jackson, we refused to\napply equitable tolling to excuse a Social Security claimant’s untimely appeal of an\nadministrative decision denying her benefits because she had not shown “extraordinary\ncircumstances.” See id. at 1353–54 (“We think the law clearly requires that a finding of\nextraordinary circumstances is necessary before a court may equitably toll the SSA’s statutory\nperiod, and this determination is reserved for extraordinary facts.” (quotation omitted)).\n         However, we are unaware of any ADEA case that imposes such a requirement. See, e.g.,\nJones, 331 F.3d at 1263–67 (applying equitable tolling without requiring “extraordinary\ncircumstances”); Hargett v. Valley Fed. Sav. Bank, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"70399\"><a href=\"/opinion/70399/hargett-v-valley-federal-savings/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 764–65 (11th Cir. 1995)\n(same); Sturniolo, 15 F.3d at 1024–26 (same); Cocke, 817 F.2d at 1561–62 (same). Applying a\nless stringent standard in this context makes good sense because discriminatory hiring practices\nare “unlikely to be readily apparent to the individual discriminated against.” Reeb, 516 F.2d at\n931. Thus, unlike a Social Security claimant who has all the information necessary to appeal at\nthe time her application for benefits is denied, an employee or applicant for employment may not\nknow any relevant facts at the time of the discriminatory act. See Jones, 331 F.3d at 1264.\n\n\n                                              32\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015   Page: 33 of 60\n\n\ncontrary. See, e.g., Browning v.

Rather, we inquire into whether “the facts supporting a\n\ncause of action became apparent or should have became apparent to a reasonably\n\nprudent person with concern for his or her rights.” Jones, 331 F.3d at 1267. And\n\nbased on this inquiry, this Court has allowed equitable tolling in cases where\n\nemployers concealed or misrepresented facts. See id. at 1264, 1267; Sturniolo, 15\n\nF.3d at 1025–26. After all, when evidence of discrimination is deliberately hidden,\n\neven a reasonably prudent person would have little opportunity to uncover it. But\n\nthere are circumstances other than concealment and misrepresentation which place\n\nrelevant facts beyond the reach of a reasonably prudent victim of discrimination.\n\nIn these cases the ultimate question is not whether an employer deliberately hid\n\nfacts. Rather, we ask whether reasonable prudence would have resulted in the\n\nplaintiff uncovering hidden facts earlier.\n\n      Second, a person’s “mere suspicion of age discrimination, unsupported by\n\npersonal knowledge,” does not trigger the limitations period. Sturniolo, 15 F.3d at\n\n1026. Instead, the clock does not begin to run until she has enough information to\n\nsupport her cause of action. Id. at 1025–26.\n\n      Finally, because “[s]ecret preferences in hiring” are “unlikely to be readily\n\n\n                                             33\n\f               Case: 15-10602       Date Filed: 11/30/2015       Page: 34 of 60\n\n\napparent to the individual discriminated against,” Reeb, 516 F.2d at 931, our\n\nprecedent makes clear that a plaintiff need not undertake an entirely futile\n\ninvestigation into hidden discriminatory practices in the name of “due diligence.”\n\nThus, while Mr. Villarreal’s diligence may be relevant to the ultimate inquiry—at\n\nwhat point the facts necessary to support his lawsuit “should [have been] apparent\n\nto a person with a reasonably prudent regard for his rights,” id. at 930—his failure\n\nto ask RJ Reynolds why he had not been hired is not fatal to his claim. 14\n\n       Our decision in Jones illustrates this point. In Jones, plaintiff Gerda Byrd\n\nworked as an “assistant area sales manager” at a department store. 331 F.3d at\n\n1261. In May 1999, Ms. Byrd learned that the store intended to eliminate her\n\nposition as part of its restructuring. Id. It allowed her to choose between taking\n\nanother position or accepting severance pay, and she chose the latter. Id. In June\n\n1999, however, Ms. Byrd learned that the store planned to hire two new assistant\n\narea sales managers. Id. She immediately suspected that she had been the victim\n\nof age discrimination, and recorded her suspicions in typed notes. Id.\n\n       Several months later, in October 1999, the store filled Ms. Byrd’s former\n\n       14\n           Along the same lines, the dissent correctly observes that “it might have been\nsomewhat difficult” for Mr. Villarreal to gather facts necessary to establish his discrimination\nclaim since RJ Reynolds used third-party services to screen applicants. But the use of third-party\nservices is not the only difficulty spurned applicants will face. A disappointed applicant\ninquiring of an employer about the age and identity of whoever was hired in his stead will likely\nnot be well received. Indeed, employers have every incentive to hold this type of information\nclose.\n\n\n                                               34\n\f              Case: 15-10602    Date Filed: 11/30/2015   Page: 35 of 60\n\n\nposition with a younger applicant. Id. at 1261–62. Ms. Byrd learned about the hire\n\nin November 1999 and filed her charge of discrimination with the EEOC in\n\nFebruary 2000. Id. at 1262–63. The district court found that Ms. Byrd’s federal\n\nlawsuit was untimely because her charge of discrimination had been filed more\n\nthan 180 days after any allegedly discriminatory act. See id. at 1262.\n\n        On appeal, our Court considered whether to apply equitable tolling to save\n\nMs. Byrd’s claim. We observed that the ADEAs limitations period could have\n\nbeen triggered on three possible dates: (1) April or May 1999, when Ms. Byrd was\n\nfirst told that her position would be eliminated; (2) June 1999, when she\n\ndiscovered that the store planned to hire two new assistant area sales managers and\n\nrecorded her suspicion of age discrimination; or (3) November 1999, when she\n\nlearned that her former position had been filled by a younger applicant. Id. at\n\n1263.\n\n        Without addressing whether Ms. Byrd had investigated the circumstances of\n\nher replacement, we explained that the third option was the “only one consistent\n\nwith our precedent and the facts of [the] case.” Id. at 1268. Thus, we held that the\n\nADEA’s limitations period had been equitably tolled until November 1999: it was\n\nonly then that Ms. Byrd had “sufficient evidence to support her age discrimination\n\nclaim.” Id. at 1266. We emphasized that even Ms. Byrd’s June 1999 discovery\n\nthat the store planned to hire two new assistant area sales managers was\n\n\n                                          35\n\f               Case: 15-10602         Date Filed: 11/30/2015       Page: 36 of 60\n\n\ninsufficient to trigger the limitations period because Ms. Byrd could not have been\n\nexpected to act on “mere suspicion.” Id. at 1267.\n\n       Jones controls here. If anything, Mr. Villarreal’s case presents an even\n\nstronger argument for equitable tolling because unlike Ms. Byrd, Mr. Villarreal\n\nalleges that he could not have even suspected age discrimination until shortly\n\nbefore he filed his charge of discrimination. Specifically, although Mr. Villarreal\n\napplied for a Territory Manager position in November 2007, he alleges that neither\n\nthe application itself nor any other information available to him described RJ\n\nReynolds’s hiring process, the resume review guidelines, or the statistical\n\ndisparities in the ages of successful applicants. Indeed, because RJ Reynolds never\n\ncontacted Mr. Villarreal about his application, all he could have known until April\n\n2010 was that he applied for a Territory Manager position but was never offered\n\nthe job.15 These facts were simply insufficient to support his cause of action and\n\ntrigger the limitations period.\n\n       Accepting Mr. Villarreal’s allegations as true and drawing all inferences in\n\n\n       15\n            The dissent overlooks this point entirely. The question here is not what a reasonably\nprudent person would have done, but whether the relevant facts would have “[become] apparent\nto a reasonably prudent person” any earlier than April 2010. Jones, 331 F.3d at 1267. Mr.\nVillarreal alleges that a reasonably prudent person could not have discovered RJ Reynolds’s\nallegedly discriminatory practices until that time.

But this one is, and it has the potential to create bad law\n\nin two important areas. The majority first holds—and it is the only court ever to do\n\nso—that Section 4(a)(2) of the ADEA authorizes disparate impact claims brought\n\nby job applicants. It gets there by finding that Section 4(a)(2) is ambiguous and\n\nthat Mr. Villarreal’s reading of the statute is reasonable, thereby warranting\n\ndeference to the EEOC’s longstanding position that it protects applicants for hire.\n\nThe majority further holds—contrary to well established law—that such plaintiffs\n\nmay be entitled to the “extraordinary remedy” of equitable tolling, notwithstanding\n\nthe total absence of any plausible claim (let alone any evidence) of “extraordinary\n\ncircumstances” to justify it. I strongly disagree on both points and must\n\nrespectfully dissent.\n\n                                          I.\n\n      Section 4(a) of the ADEA makes it unlawful for an employer:\n\n      (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise\n      discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,\n      terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such\n      individual’s age; [or]\n\n      (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any way which\n      would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment\n      opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee,\n      because of such individual’s age[.]\n\f               Case: 15-10602       Date Filed: 11/30/2015       Page: 39 of 60\n\n\n\n\n29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1)-(2). Based on its plain language, the statute clearly protects\n\nboth employees and job applicants from disparate treatment in Section 4(a)(1), but\n\nit only protects employees in Section 4(a)(2).\n\n      In Smith v. City of Jackson, Miss., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142883\"><a href=\"/opinion/142883/smith-v-city-of-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142883\"><a href=\"/opinion/142883/smith-v-city-of-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Significantly, the entire Court\n\nrecognized that disparate impact claims are not available under Section 4(a)(1)\n\nsince that section is limited to disparate treatment, so disparate impact liability\n\nexists only under Section 4(a)(2). See id. at 236 n.6, 125 S. Ct. at 1542 n.6\n\n(plurality); accord id. at 243, 125 S. Ct. at 1546 (agreeing with the plurality)\n\n(Scalia, J., concurring).\n\n      The plaintiffs in Smith were existing employees. The question presented in\n\nthis case is whether job applicants can pursue disparate impact claims under\n\nSection 4(a)(2). The majority holds that they can, but this is contrary to the plain\n\nlanguage of Section 4(a)(2) (which, as indicated above, clearly only protects\n\nemployees); and, as will be seen infra, it is contrary to every other court that has\n\nconsidered this issue, including the opinions of eight Supreme Court Justices in\n\nSmith.1\n\n      1\n          Chief Justice Rehnquist took no part in the Smith decision.\n\n\n                                               39\n\f             Case: 15-10602      Date Filed: 11/30/2015    Page: 40 of 60\n\n\n      Two “key textual differences” between Section 4(a)(1) and (a)(2) make clear\n\nthat the majority is wrong. Cf. id. at 236 n.6, 125 S. Ct. at 1542 n.6 (noting that the\n\ndifferences between the two paragraphs are important in determining the\n\navailability of disparate impact claims). First of all, while Section 4(a)(1) broadly\n\nprohibits discrimination against “any individual,” Section 4(a)(2) is much more\n\nlimited. It only prohibits the employer from “limit[ing], segregat[ing], or\n\nclassify[ing] his employees” in any manner that adversely affects them based on\n\nage. (Emphasis added.) The phrase “his employees,” including the use of the\n\npossessive “his,” is critically important as it limits the scope of Section 4(a)(2) to\n\nthose actions that an employer takes against employees. This limiting phrase is\n\nclear and unambiguous. A job applicant is, by definition, not an employee. 2\n\n      Second, unlike Section 4(a)(1), which prohibits an employer from “fail[ing]\n\nor refus[ing] to hire” a person based on age, Section 4(a)(2) makes no reference to\n\nhiring decisions at all. In other words, Congress expressly included job applicants\n\nwithin the protections of the first paragraph of Section 4(a) (the disparate treatment\n\nprovision), but it then omitted them in the very next paragraph (the disparate\n\nimpact provision). As the Supreme Court has frequently said (and as the majority\n\nitself has recognized): “Congress generally acts intentionally when it uses\n\n      2\n         The ADEA defines employee as “an individual employed by any employer[.]” See 29\nU.S.C. § 630(f).\n\n\n\n                                           40\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015    Page: 41 of 60\n\n\nparticular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another.” Department\n\nof Homeland Sec. v.

We refrain from concluding that the differing language\n\nin the two subsections has the same [reach]”).\n\n      In arguing that Section 4(a)(2) protects job applicants, Mr. Villarreal points\n\nto the language in the paragraph that, he claims, prevents employers from\n\n“depriv[ing] any individual of employment opportunities[.]” (Emphasis added.)\n\nThe majority, favoring only one portion of the sentence and disregarding the rest of\n\nthat sentence, believes this argument is reasonable because “any” is a broad and\n\npowerful word, and “individual” is not limited to employees.

Here,\n\ncontext simply means that a single clause means what it says. Section 4(a)(2) does\n\nnot use the word “individual” in isolation, but, instead, it clearly protects only\n\n“individual[s]” whose “status as an employee” was adversely affected by an\n\nemployer’s “limit[ing], segregat[ing], or classify[ing] his employees.” (Emphasis\n\nadded.) Thus, in the context of Section 4(a)(2), the “individuals” authorized to file\n\nsuit are limited to actual “employees,” rather than people who have no employment\n\nrelationship with the employer at all.\n\n      The majority devotes most of its opinion to several additional extra-statutory\n\narguments that Mr. Villarreal and RJ Reynolds have raised, ultimately concluding\n\nthat the arguments cut both ways, which renders the statute ambiguous and justifies\n\ndeference to the EEOC’s longstanding view on this issue. That is all unnecessary.\n\nBecause the language of Section 4(a)(2) is plain and clear on its face—particularly\n\nwhen contrasted with the language of Section 4(a)(1)—that should end the inquiry.\n\nSee King v.

Although the opinions of the eight Supreme Court Justices with respect to Section 4(a)(2)\nand job applicants versus employees may be dicta, it is equally possible that it was integral to the\nCourt’s analysis. At the very least, three Justices (O’Connor, Kennedy, and Thomas)\nunequivocally and emphatically stated that Section 4(a)(2) does not apply to job applicants, and\nthe other five Justices impliedly agreed. This “dicta” might not be compelling if there was\npersuasive case law to the contrary, but no court has ever suggested otherwise in the almost fifty\nyears since the ADEA was enacted. While the majority points out that this undisputed and\ndirectly-on-point dicta is not part of “three long, citation-laden paragraphs” of “well thought out,\nthoroughly reasoned, and carefully articulated analysis,” that is not surprising. Indeed, because\nthe three Justices (and arguably the whole Court) believed Section 4(a)(2) to be so clear and\nunambiguous that “of course” it does not apply to job applicants, a lengthy and detailed analysis\nwas unnecessary.\n       8\n         In Bonner v.

In\n\nadvancing this argument, the majority notes that Jackson, supra, is a Social\n\nSecurity Act case, and it is “unaware of any ADEA case that imposes [the\n\n‘extraordinary circumstances’] requirement.” Jackson is indeed a Social Security\n\nAct case. But, as indicated above, it expressly relies on Ross, which is a Title VII\n\ncase that required a showing of “extraordinary circumstances.” See Jackson, 506\n\nF.3d at 1353-55 (concluding that “a finding of extraordinary circumstances is\n\nnecessary before a court may equitably toll the SSA’s statutory period,” which, the\n\npanel went on to observe, “is fully consistent with [this circuit’s] approach to\n\nequitable tolling in” employment discrimination cases such as Ross).\n\nConsequently, to be entitled to equitable tolling—even in the employment\n\ndiscrimination context—it appears to be well established that this court does, in\n\n\n\n\n       9\n          Even if one assumes that “extraordinary circumstances” are not required in ADEA\ncases (and, as will be seen in a moment, that is simply not correct), the precedent I just cited in\nthe text makes it clear that equitable tolling—even in ADEA cases—is at the very least “‘an\nextraordinary remedy which should be extended only sparingly.’” See Bost, 372 F.3d at 1242\n(ADEA case).\n\n\n                                                 51\n\f               Case: 15-10602        Date Filed: 11/30/2015        Page: 52 of 60\n\n\nfact, require plaintiffs to show “extraordinary circumstances.”10\n\n       If evaluated under the proper standard, it is clear that equitable tolling is not\n\njustified in this case. As previously noted, equitable tolling is only appropriate if a\n\nplaintiff untimely files due to extraordinary circumstances that are both beyond his\n\ncontrol and unavoidable with due diligence. Mr. Villarreal does not even claim\n\nthat there are any extraordinary circumstances in this case (like fraud,\n\nmisinformation, or deliberate concealment by RJ Reynolds) that should warrant\n\nthis extraordinary and sparingly-used remedy. 11\n\n       Mr. Villarreal was given an opportunity by the District Court to set out his\n\nequitable grounds for tolling. According to his proposed amended complaint, after\n       10\n           In addition to the published authority cited above, this circuit has repeatedly required\n“extraordinary circumstances” in Title VII and ADEA cases in unpublished decisions. See, e.g.,\nMesidor v. Waste Mgmt., Inc. of Florida, 606 F. App’x 934, 936 (11th Cir. 2015) (stating in\nTitle VII case: “To show they are entitled to equitable tolling, the Appellants must show\nextraordinary circumstances such as fraud, misinformation, or deliberate concealment.”); Bourne\nv. School Bd. of Broward County, 508 F. App’x 907, 909-10 (11th Cir. 2013) (same in Title VII\ncase); Brown v. John Deere Product, Inc., 460 F.

App’x 834, 836 (11th Cir. 2006) (same\nin Title VII case). This acknowledgment of the “extraordinary circumstances” requirement in so\nmany unpublished cases is an implicit agreement that it is the settled law of this circuit.\n       11\n            To be clear, I have cited employer fraud, misinformation, and deliberate concealment\nfor illustrative purposes; I am not suggesting they are required. In fact, I agree with the majority\nthat they are not. However, as will be seen shortly, this circuit has long been reluctant to—and\nusually does not—allow equitable tolling in the absence of such evidence.

In fact, he did not even call the company to confirm that\n\nhis application had been reviewed, let alone find out why it was rejected. He made\n\nno attempt to discover the identity or age of the person who was hired, nor did he\n\ntry to learn about the company’s hiring practices or its allegedly discriminatory\n\n“resume review guidelines.” To be sure, it might have been somewhat difficult for\n\nhim to have gotten such information since RJ Reynolds used third-party services to\n\nscreen its applicants, but the fact is that he made no attempt to try. He did not\n\nexercise any diligence at all, and a reasonably prudent person with concern for his\n\nrights would have done so.\n\n      The majority believes that such efforts should not be required of plaintiffs in\n\nfailure-to-hire cases because any investigation into why they were not hired would\n\nbe “an entirely futile” gesture insofar as “[a] disappointed applicant inquiring of an\n\nemployer about the age and identity of whoever was hired in his stead will likely\n\nnot be well received. Indeed, employers have every incentive to hold this type of\n\ninformation close.” But, the same could be said of almost every case. Potential\n\ndefendants in virtually every litigation have an incentive to withhold information\n\nthat might subject them to liability. Yet, we always require plaintiffs to exercise\n\ndiligence before they are entitled to equitable tolling; and as previously noted, the\n\nremedy is so rare that it could still be denied even if the plaintiff did exercise due\n\n\n                                           53\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015    Page: 54 of 60\n\n\ndiligence. Justice, 6 F.3d at 1479.\n\n      Whatever specific form “due diligence” could have taken on the facts of this\n\ncase (whether personal investigation or something else), if the diligence\n\nrequirement means anything at all, Mr. Villarreal must have at least done\n\nsomething. See id.; Pacheco, 966 F.2d at 907; cf. Drew, 297 F.3d at 1290 n.5\n\n(recognizing that equitable tolling is a remedy “that has always been reserved only\n\nfor parties who have pursued their rights diligently and whose untimeliness is due\n\nto factors entirely beyond their control;” consequently, a party seeking relief\n\ncannot have “‘slept on his rights’” and done “‘nothing for several years’”)\n\n(emphasis in original) (collecting cases). The record here is unchallenged that Mr.\n\nVillarreal did nothing until about two and a half years after his application was\n\nrejected, when he was first contacted by the attorneys investigating a possible class\n\naction suit against RJ Reynolds. As far as I can tell, neither this circuit nor any\n\nother court has ever tolled a statute of limitations in order to accommodate lawyers\n\nputting together a cause of action, and allowing tolling in such a situation\n\neffectively eviscerates the statute of limitations. Villarreal has not shown (or even\n\nalleged) that there was anything “extraordinary” which prevented him from\n\ninvestigating his claim (with or without an attorney) and then pursuing his rights\n\nwithin the limitations period. To follow the necessary logic of his argument, any\n\nplaintiff (in any type of lawsuit) who claims to have required the assistance of an\n\n\n                                          54\n\f               Case: 15-10602        Date Filed: 11/30/2015       Page: 55 of 60\n\n\nattorney to discover the existence of a claim—even those plaintiffs, like Villarreal,\n\nwho conduct absolutely no diligence at all—may be entitled to equitable tolling for\n\nan indefinite period of time. 12\n\n       It is telling that every case the majority has relied upon (save one) involved\n\nmisrepresentations and/or concealment by employer defendants. 13 Although I have\n\nagreed that equitable tolling does not necessarily require active misrepresentation\n\nor concealment by the employer [supra note 11], each of the cases cited by the\n\nmajority precisely involved misrepresentation or concealment. See, e.g., Jones v.\n\nDillard’s, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">331</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1259</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir. 2003) (employer fired plaintiff after\n\nclaiming that her position was being eliminated, but she discovered more than 180\n\ndays later that the job had been filled with a younger person); Sturniolo v.\n\n\n       12\n           The majority tries to cabin its ruling to employment discrimination claims (particularly\nfailure-to-hire claims). It maintains that the law it announces today makes “good sense” because\njob applicants “may not know any relevant facts at the time of the discriminatory act.” However,\neven if that is true “at the time,” that does not excuse them from acting with diligence (as\nrequired by circuit precedent) and making an effort to learn the “relevant facts” thereafter. To\nthe extent the majority believes, as previously noted, that it would be “futile” for a plaintiff to\nconduct such an inquiry because a defendant would have “every incentive” to withhold evidence\nrelating to his misdeeds, the logic of that view would not only apply to discrimination statutes,\nbut could apply to virtually any civil action.\n       13\n           And, the one case that did not involve any misconduct by the employer, Browning v.\nAT&T Paradyne, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744250\"><a href=\"/opinion/744250/74-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1227-71-empl-prac-dec-p-44930-11-fla-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir. 1997), does not help Mr. Villarreal. While that case\ndid not have employer misconduct, it did involve the EEOC advising the plaintiff that his claim\nwas governed by an incorrect statute of limitations, after which he filed a claim that was\nuntimely by 18 days. This circuit concluded: “On this unique, specific set of facts, we hold, and\nour holding is a very narrow one, that the statute of limitations was tolled for the 18 days that\nHanna’s complaint was untimely.” Id. at 227 (emphasis added). By contrast, there are no\nallegations of misconduct or misinformation in this case (by either the company or the EEOC)\nthat prevented Mr. Villarreal from filing timely.\n\n                                                55\n\f               Case: 15-10602   Date Filed: 11/30/2015   Page: 56 of 60\n\n\nSheaffer, Eaton, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"661824\"><a href=\"/opinion/661824/64-fair-emplpraccas-bna-246-63-empl-prac-dec-p-42887-joseph-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1023</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir. 1994) (same); Cocke v.

Importantly, all of these cases are rooted in Reeb, supra,\n\nwhere a female employee was falsely told that her job was not being renewed due\n\nto limited funds, after which she discovered (once the time to file with the EEOC\n\nhad passed) that her position had actually been filled by a less qualified male. The\n\ndefendant company, in other words, “actively sought to mislead” her. Reeb, 516\n\nF.2d at 930.\n\n      The common denominator in every one of these cases is that the employers\n\nmisrepresented or concealed information, and the plaintiffs were put in a situation\n\nwhere they confronted “two equally unattractive options”: file a claim when there\n\nwas at most “a mere suspicion,” in which case the litigation would be considered\n\npremature and would probably fail; or wait for “the surfacing of telltale evidence,”\n\ni.e., the hiring of a younger individual, in which case “the cunning employer will\n\nescape liability by postponing the hiring of a replacement for at least six months.”\n\nSee Jones, 331 F.3d at 1264. As this court has noted, the point of Reeb was simply\n\n\n                                         56\n\f             Case: 15-10602      Date Filed: 11/30/2015    Page: 57 of 60\n\n\nto “close the loophole” that was being used by such “malicious employers” to\n\navoid liability. Jones, 331 F.3d at 1264-65. Or, as the former Fifth Circuit\n\ndescribed it: “The rationale underlying [Reeb] is that it is unfair to allow a\n\ndefendant to conceal facts that support the plaintiff’s cause of action and then to\n\nrely on the statute of limitations to bar the suit when a duly diligent plaintiff was\n\nunable to discover those facts.” Chappell v. Emco Mach. Works, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"368194\"><a href=\"/opinion/368194/cleda-jean-chappell-v-emco-machine-works-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">601</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1295</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1303 (5th Cir. 1979). The majority’s reliance on Reeb and its progeny is\n\nmisplaced on the facts presented here.\n\n      It makes sense to apply equitable tolling in the sort of cases described above\n\nsince it would be inequitable to allow an employer to take advantage of a statute of\n\nlimitations by misrepresenting or fraudulently concealing information that could\n\nhave put the employee on notice that his rights might have been violated. As the\n\nReeb court stated, “a party responsible for such wrongful concealment [should be]\n\nestopped from asserting the statute of limitations as a defense . . . [as] ‘no man may\n\ntake advantage of his own wrong.’” See Reeb, 516 F.2d at 930 (citation omitted).\n\nHowever, it makes absolutely no sense to apply tolling in a situation like the one\n\nhere, where there was no misconduct by RJ Reynolds that in any way contributed\n\nto Mr. Villarreal’s late filing. Unlike every one of the cases cited by the majority,\n\nthe company did not conceal facts, erect any barriers, or take advantage of a\n\n“loophole” to keep him from filing timely. Nor was he misled about the applicable\n\n\n                                           57\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015    Page: 58 of 60\n\n\nstatute of limitations. See supra note 13. Mr. Villarreal just did nothing—not even\n\nmake a phone call to see that his resume had been reviewed—for approximately\n\ntwo and a half years. To the extent the majority believes that equitable tolling is\n\navailable in cases like this one simply because people who are discriminated\n\nagainst in hiring do not have sufficient information to know they were victims of\n\ndiscrimination, that is hardly an unusual or extraordinary circumstance. As RJ\n\nReynolds has pointed out:\n\n             Accepting Villarreal’s argument would mean that the\n             limitations period in most every hiring case could be\n             tolled indefinitely, or at least until the plaintiff was\n             contacted by an attorney looking for clients to build a\n             class action. Equitable tolling would no longer be an\n             “extraordinary remedy”—it would become the norm.\n             That is not and should not be the law.\n\nThere are obvious reasons why today’s ruling “should not be the law,” including\n\nsome identified by the Seventh Circuit:\n\n             Statutes of limitations are not arbitrary obstacles to the\n             vindication of just claims, and therefore they should not\n             be given a grudging application. They protect important\n             social interests in certainty, accuracy, and repose. The\n             statute of limitations is short in age discrimination cases\n             as in most employment cases because delay in the\n             bringing of suit runs up the employer’s potential liability;\n             every day is one more day of backpay entitlements. We\n             should not trivialize the statute of limitations by\n             promiscuous application of tolling doctrines.\n\n\n                                          58\n\f              Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 11/30/2015     Page: 59 of 60\n\n\nCada v.

See, e.g., Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (“A pleading that offers ‘labels and\n\nconclusions’ or ‘a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not\n\ndo.’ Nor does a complaint suffice if it tenders ‘naked assertion[s]’ devoid of\n\n‘further factual enhancement.’”) (quoting Twombly). Villarreal alleges no facts\n\nsuggesting that there was anything “extraordinary” here. There is nothing about\n\nthis case that is particularly unique or different than any other failure-to-hire case.\n\nThe District Court gave Villarreal an opportunity to meet the Twombly and Iqbal\n\nstandard, but he was not able to do so. In fact, rather than setting forth a plausible\n\nclaim for equitable tolling, the amended complaint conclusively establishes that\n\n\n                                           59\n\f               Case: 15-10602        Date Filed: 11/30/2015       Page: 60 of 60\n\n\ntolling is not appropriate. It bears repeating once more that the amended complaint\n\nmakes clear that Villarreal not only failed to conduct any inquiry into why he was\n\nnot hired, but it expressly states that he did not even contact RJ Reynolds to see\n\n“whether his application had been reviewed at all.” It is, quite frankly, hard to\n\nimagine a plaintiff acting with less diligence and prudent regard for his rights. 14\n\n                                               III.\n\n       For the reasons stated above, I believe the District Court should be affirmed.\n\nI must respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n       14\n           Because the majority accepted Mr. Villarreal’s equitable tolling argument, it found it\nunnecessary to reach his alternative argument pursuant to the “continuing violation doctrine.” I\nwill not do so either.\n\n\n                                                60\n\f</pre>",
