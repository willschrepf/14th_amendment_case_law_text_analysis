We affirm.\n\n       The district court properly dismissed Guillen’s retaliation claim because\n\nGuillen’s allegations were conclusory and Guillen failed to allege facts showing\n\nthat defendants transferred him to a supermax prison because of his protected\n\nconduct. See Rhodes v. Robinson, 408 F.3d 559, 567-68 (9th Cir. 2005) (setting\n\nforth the elements of a retaliation claim in the prison context).\n\n       The district court properly granted summary judgment on Guillen’s claim\n\nthat his confinement in administrative segregation on false charges violated his due\n\nprocess rights because Guillen failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact as\n\nto whether the segregated confinement created a liberty interest. See Sandin v.\n\nConner, 515 U.S. 472, 486 (1995) (concluding that “discipline in segregated\n\nconfinement did not present the type of atypical, significant deprivation” required\n\nto create a liberty interest).\n\n       The district court properly granted summary judgment on Guillen’s claim\n\nthat his indeterminate detention in administrative segregation violated his due\n\n\n                                           2                                   12-16298\n\fprocess rights because Guillen failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact as\n\nto whether prison officials afforded him all of the process he was due under the\n\nFourteenth Amendment. See Toussaint v. McCarthy, 801 F.2d 1080, 1100-01,\n\n1104 (9th Cir. 1986) (explaining that due process requires certain minimal\n\nprocedures, and noting that some sort of periodic review of an inmate’s continued\n\nsegregated confinement is necessary), abrogated in part on other grounds by\n\nSandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472 (1995); see also Bruce, 351 F.3d at 1287. To the\n\nextent that defendants may have failed to conduct timely periodic reviews, the\n\ndistrict court properly granted summary judgment on the basis of qualified\n\nimmunity under the unique facts of this case. See Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S.\n\n223, 232 (2009).\n\n      The district court properly granted summary judgment on Guillen’s Eighth\n\nAmendment conditions of confinement claims because Guillen failed to raise a\n\ngenuine dispute of material fact as to whether he was placed in substantial risk of\n\nserious harm by his temporary placement in a cell that was too warm or by his\n\nconfinement in indefinite administrative segregation. See Farmer v. Brennan, 511\n\nU.S. 825, 837 (1994) (“[A] prison official cannot be found liable under the Eighth\n\nAmendment for denying an inmate humane conditions of confinement unless the\n\nofficial knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety. . . .”).\n\n\n                                           3                                     12-16298\n\f      The district court did not abuse its discretion by granting summary judgment\n\nwithout ordering further discovery because Guillen did not establish how\n\nadditional discovery would have affected the disposition of his case. See Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 56(d); Barona Grp. of the Capitan Grande Band of Mission Indians v. Am.\n\nMgmt. & Amusement, Inc., 840 F.2d 1394, 1399-1400 (9th Cir. 1987) (setting forth\n\nstandard of review and noting that in making a motion for further discovery a\n\nmovant must show specific facts he hopes to discover and how those facts would\n\npreclude summary judgment).\n\n      The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Guillen’s motion for\n\nrelief from judgment because Guillen failed to establish grounds for such relief.\n\nSee Sch. Dist. No. 1J, Multnomah Cnty., Or. v.
