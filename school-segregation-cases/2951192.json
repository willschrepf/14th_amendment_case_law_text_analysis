See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. §§ 19.02, 71.02\n\n(West 2011). Mejia was sentenced to life imprisonment.1 By five issues, in his pro se\n\nbrief, Mejia contends that: (1) the evidence is legally and factually insufficient; (2) the\n\n\n       1\n        The jury found that appellant was a repeat felony offender. See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. § 12.42\n(West Supp. 2011).\n\fState engaged in prosecutorial misconduct for a variety of reasons; (3) the trial court\n\nabused its discretion by “not allowing [him] to object to trial counsel and forcing [him] to\n\ntrial with an attorney with whom he ha[d] become embroiled in irreconcilable conflict”;\n\n(4) the trial court improperly admitted certain evidence at trial; and (5) defense counsel\n\nwas ineffective.2 We affirm.\n\n                                        I.     THE EVIDENCE\n\n       The State presented the testimony from, among others, Rosie Ann Arce, Janet\n\nSertuche (“Janet”), Kelly Flood, Harminda Narula, M.D., Holly Jedlicka, Chris Garcia,\n\nWalter Henson, Charles Ray Goble, Mistie De Los Santos (“Mistie”), John McNeill,\n\nM.D., Paul Garcia, Calvin S. Story Jr., Justin De Los Santos (“Justin”), Amanda\n\nClemons, and Pedro Reyes Jr. The trial court also admitted numerous State’s exhibits\n\nat trial, including, among other things, an audio recording of Sertuche’s call to 911, and\n\na video recording of the crime scene.            Mejia testified on his own behalf.   He also\n\npresented the testimony of Detective Clemons among others.\n\nA.     Arce\n\n       Arce testified that on Tuesday, October 30, 2007, her son Derrick Quintanilla\n\ndied as a result of a gunshot wound to the head. At the time of his death, Quintanilla\n\nhad been dating Mistie for approximately four months. Quintanilla’s body was found at\n\nMistie’s residence in Victoria, Texas.\n\nB.     Janet Sertuche\n\n       Janet testified that Mistie is her daughter and Justin is her son. On October 30,\n\n2007, Janet lived on Guadalupe Street in Victoria. Quintanilla occasionally spent the\n\n\n       2\n           We have renumbered and reorganized Mejia’s six issues.\n\n\n                                                   2\n\fnight at Janet’s home. Justin and Quintanilla’s relationship was frayed when Quintanilla\n\nbegan dating Mistie; however, the conflict had been resolved before Quintanilla’s death.\n\nAccording to Janet, Quintanilla and Mistie had been dating for almost two years. Mistie\n\nwas fifteen at the time of Quintanilla’s death and Quintanilla was seventeen.\n\n       Mejia was dating Janet’s sister, Natalie Sertuche.              On October 28, 2007,\n\nQuintanilla and Mistie babysat Natalie’s children at her apartment. Janet assumed that\n\nMejia also resided at the apartment because “[h]e was there.” On that day, Janet had to\n\ngo to Natalie’s apartment to check on Natalie’s son and her other sister Paula’s two\n\nsons because there was an automobile accident. The accident involved Paula, Natalie,\n\nand Mejia. Paula and Natalie went to the hospital. Mejia was injured; however, he did\n\nnot go to the hospital.\n\n       When Janet arrived at Natalie’s apartment, she saw Mejia and Quintanilla arrive\n\nalso. This occurred in the morning hours of October 28. When the police arrived at the\n\napartment complex, Mejia told Janet he did not want to be there, so she took him to her\n\nresidence. When Janet later took Mejia back to Natalie’s apartment, Mejia complained\n\nthat his wallet and money were missing. Mejia believed that he had forgotten his wallet\n\nin his brother, Paul’s car. The wallet was found in Natalie’s apartment on the kitchen\n\ntable the next morning.\n\n       Janet stated that subsequently, she called Natalie3 and that Mejia took the phone\n\naway from Natalie and said, “‘That was fucked up, what they did, screwing me over like\n\nthat, when I was all messed up. But they’re going to pay. There’s nothing you can do\n\nto protect them. I’ve already called my boys and they are coming down [and they’re on\n\n\n       3\n           It is unclear from Janet’s testimony when she called her.\n\n\n                                                      3\n\ftheir way] and they don’t play.’” According to Janet, Mejia stated that Quintanilla, Mistie,\n\nand Justin should be concerned about his threat.\n\n         Quintanilla spent the night at Janet’s residence on October 29, 2007. Janet had\n\nthe overnight shift at work and returned home at “around” 7:45 a.m. Mistie needed to\n\ngo to school, and Quintanilla had an appointment at the attorney general’s office. Janet\n\ntook Mistie to school some time after 8:00 a.m. Justin and Quintanilla remained at\n\nhome. When Janet left, Justin was asleep and Quintanilla was attempting to go back to\n\nsleep.\n\n         After dropping Mistie off at school, Janet went to her other daughter’s residence.\n\nWhile there, Janet received a phone call from an unknown person. The caller told Janet\n\nthat “there would be police officers up in [her] house. They wanted to know if [her] son\n\nwas at home and, if not, he has a key—There was going to be a lot of law at [her]\n\nhouse.” Janet immediately returned home and discovered that the screen door was\n\ntorn and the “plexiglass on [her] front door was pushed in.” Janet then went to her\n\nbedroom and discovered Quintanilla’s lifeless body.\n\n         Janet stated that Justin and Quintanilla both had friends that were in different\n\ngangs. Janet did not know whether Justin was associated with any gangs. According\n\nto Janet, Justin and Quintanilla had been involved in altercations with members of\n\ngangs. Janet once witnessed Justin and Quintanilla fighting with some boys at Natalie’s\n\napartment complex.\n\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\fC.   Flood\n\n        Officer Flood, a Victoria Police Department Officer, responded to Janet’s call to\n\n911. While at Janet’s residence, Janet told Officer Flood that she knew who had killed\n\nQuintanilla but would not reveal the person’s identity out of fear. Officer Flood said:\n\n              She began talking about a car accident that [Quintanilla] and her\n        daughter had called her about. There was another guy with them at the\n        time and she was supposed to go—[t]hey were supposed to—[s]omebody\n        was supposed to go pick this guy up, along with [Quintanilla].\n\n                ....\n\n                And she believed that that was the guy who had killed him.\n\n        A nine-millimeter casing was found at the crime scene. Quintanilla had been\n\nshot in the face and was bleeding from his nose. Flood found that Quintanilla had a\n\n“very faint and very weak” pulse.4\n\n        On re-direct examination, Flood testified that Janet told her that “her daughter\n\nand [Quintanilla] had received a phone call from the guy they had given a ride to and he\n\nbelieved that Mistie and [Quintanilla] had taken his wallet and he wanted the money\n\nback or he was going to come back after them.” Janet was “concerned for herself and\n\nher family. After that, her main concern was getting in touch with her daughter, who\n\nwas at school, and making sure no one would harm her daughter.”\n\nD.      Dr. Narula\n\n        Dr. Narula is a forensic pathologist who works for the Nueces County Medical\n\nExaminer’s Office as a contract medical examiner. The autopsy showed that Quintanilla\n\nhad been shot in the right cheek. There was “tiny gunpowder stippling” around the\n\n\n        4\n          Another responding officer, Zachary Thomas McDaniel testified that he could not recall whether\nQuintanilla had a pulse.\n\n\n                                                   5\n\fwound. There was also “very few scattered, tiny splitting marks on the upper eyelid and\n\non the side of the nose.” Dr. Narula opined that the wound was caused by a handgun at\n\n“close-range” held “anywhere from two to four inches” away from Quintanilla’s head.\n\nThe bullet was located “inside the skull [in the] tissue on the left side of the back of the\n\nhead.” The gunshot wound was the sole cause of Quintanilla’s death. The manner of\n\ndeath was classified as a homicide. A bullet that was recovered from Quintanilla’s body\n\nwas released to Jedlicka on October 31, 2007.\n\nE.     Jedlicka\n\n       Jedlicka is a crime scene supervisor with the Victoria Police Department. One of\n\nJedlicka’s job duties is to “develop latent prints” and she has been trained to “do\n\nidentifications, through fingerprint analysis.”     Among other things, Jedlicka took\n\nphotographs of the crime scene at Janet’s residence, processed evidence, and kept the\n\nchain of custody of the evidence. Jedlicka collected a spent shell casing from the\n\nbedroom floor at the crime scene. Jedlicka also collected a portion of the plexiglass\n\nfrom Janet’s front door. Crystal Lara lifted a palm print from the plexiglass. On cross-\n\nexamination, Jedlicka clarified that the print was located “at the very bottom [of the\n\nplexiglass], where it was pushed in.”\n\nF.     Officer Garcia\n\n       Officer Garcia, a police officer with the Victoria County Sheriff’s Office, is a “gang\n\nexpert.” According to Officer Garcia, the Texas Syndicate is a prison gang that has\n\nidentifying marks including, among other things, the Texas Longhorns logo.\n\n“Sometimes they’ll have an ‘S,’ with a five point star in the middle. It’s not for sure.\n\nAlso, they’re called ‘Los [Cuernos],’ . . . which means—which basically, means horns, in\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\fSpanish—or, longhorns is a better description.”                Officer Garcia stated that some\n\nmembers have “TS” or “1920 Specialty” instead of “TS” because S is the nineteenth\n\nletter of the alphabet and T is the twentieth.\n\n        Officer Garcia explained that persons confirmed to be members of groups such\n\nas the Texas Syndicate in prison are “placed in administrative segregation, which is\n\nbasically, locked up for hours.” Therefore, many of the members “try to disguise their\n\nmembership, so it’s not readily available or recognizable to security guards or correction\n\nofficers. . . .” Officer Garcia testified that the Texas Syndicate is also considered a\n\nstreet gang. Officer Garcia stated that to acquire money, the organization engages in\n\n“[e]xtortion, narcotics, assaults, contract hits—[t]hat kind of thing.” According to Officer\n\nGarcia, the organization is comprised of three or more members who participate in the\n\ncommission of criminal activity. Officer Garcia stated that specifically in 2007 there\n\nwere at least ten members of the Texas Syndicate in Victoria.\n\n        Officer Garcia testified that he believed that Mejia is “associated with the Texas\n\nSyndicate.”      Officer Garcia described Mejia as “an up-and-coming member” of the\n\nTexas Syndicate. Officer Garcia believed that Mejia’s numerous tattoos showed his\n\naffiliation with the group and that he had attempted to camouflage that affiliation. During\n\nhis testimony, Officer Garcia referred to pictures of Mejia’s tattoos that had been\n\n“highlighted” in order to show the camouflaged images. The pictures were admitted for\n\ndemonstrative purposes over Mejia’s objection that they “were altered and the\n\nalterations weren’t by [Officer Garcia] and it [had not] been established who did the\n\nalterations.”5\n\n        5\n          During a proceeding outside the jury’s presence, District Attorney Steven Tyler stated that he\nhad altered the exhibits.\n\n                                                   7\n\f       When the State published the pictures of Mejia’s tattoos to the jury on an\n\noverhead projector, Officer Garcia “trace[d] over” one tattoo, stating there is the shape\n\nof a “T” and another image “could be considered to be an ‘S.’” 6 The picture Officer\n\nGarcia “trace[d] over” had not been “highlighted.” Officer Garcia repeated his tracing\n\nover the shapes depicted in several other pictures of Mejia’s numerous tattoos. Officer\n\nGarcia also stated that many of Mejia’s tattoos also had the “cuernos” or horns which in\n\nhis opinion were indicative of membership in the Texas Syndicate.\n\n       According to Officer Garcia, a high ranking member of a gang cannot tolerate\n\n“disrespect from gang members with less rank, . . . other gangs or from known gang\n\nmembers” because that is a sign of weakness. Members of the gang who have been\n\ndisrespectful would be disciplined, such as being “beat down, hurt very, very seriously,\n\nsomeone could be killed. It depends on how serious the disrespect was and that it\n\nwasn’t handled.”         Officer Garcia explained that if a senior gang member failed to\n\ndiscipline a member who was disrespectful, that senior member could also be in trouble\n\nwith the “higher ups.”\n\n       Officer Garcia agreed that “maintaining the prestige of the Texas Syndicate is\n\npart of the Texas Syndicate business.” According to Officer Garcia, a member of the\n\nTexas Syndicate in a leadership position could be demoted or “removed completely” if\n\nhe failed to “uphold the prestige” of the organization, or “his individual prestige and\n\nrespect.” To be “removed completely” means that the person is killed.\n\n       The State asked, “Now a hypothetical—[i]f a person was a member of the Texas\n\nSyndicate and he allowed a non-member, or a person affiliated with a street gang, to\n\n\n       6\n           It is apparent from the record that Officer Garcia used a laser pointer to “trace over” the images.\n\n\n                                                       8\n\frob him personally or ‘jack’ him personally, would he have a responsibility, as a Texas\n\nSyndicate member, to take action?” Officer Garcia responded:\n\n             Yes. He would [have] responsibility to correct what was done about\n      the reputation of the Syndicate . . . . [And] [t]hat would be [gang\n      business]. It would be looked at by the higher ups, to make sure it’s being\n      taken care of properly. . . . [If the person who committed the jacking was\n      being recruited by the Texas Syndicate i]t would make it more imperative\n      for him [the leader] to [discipline the recruit]. They are coming up with the\n      prospect of ‘esquina,’ which is the corner before it hits ‘prospecto.’ And\n      once they are ‘prospecto,’ they have to do things correctly. And when\n      they fail to do that, they have to suffer the consequences, to get on the\n      correct track. And it’s the responsibility of the leadership to correct that or\n      have somebody to enact it for them.\n\n      Officer Garcia did not know whether Quintanilla was a member of the Texas\n\nSyndicate. Officer Garcia indicated that he did not know anything about Quintanilla.\n\nOfficer Garcia testified that Mejia’s father and brother were both confirmed members of\n\nthe Texas Syndicate and that, individuals often become members of the organization by\n\nway of a legacy membership. Officer Garcia explained a legacy means that someone in\n\nthe family is already a member of the organization.        On cross-examination, Officer\n\nGarcia agreed that it was suspected that Mejia was a leader of the organization.\n\nG.    Hanson\n\n      Hanson is a latent print examiner with the crime lab of the Texas Department of\n\nPublic Safety (“DPS”). He stated that no two people have the same fingerprints. When\n\nidentifying an unknown print, Hanson compares it to an exemplar of a known person’s\n\nprints. The State asked Hanson to explain the process in comparing an unknown print\n\nto an exemplar. Hanson replied:\n\n             The skin on your hand is different than the other areas of your\n      body. It’s rough and it’s textured. It’s raised. There are corrugations or\n      ridges and furrows. These ridges, while flowing in a pattern, tend to end\n      abruptly or they tend to fork into two or more ridges or they have short\n\n                                            9\n\f       ridges or islands or dots. And we take those characteristics and we make\n       sure that they share the spatial relation in the tow prints and that they’re\n       the same in both prints, to make on identification—\n\nHanson agreed that when comparing the prints, he is “looking for . . . the same fork on\n\nthe same pattern.” Hanson explained:\n\n              There are several other things, in addition to the characteristics or\n       points that come in as a factor in an identification.\n\n             Are the two pattern types the same? Are they both loops? Are\n       they both arches?\n\n               Again, they have to have the same characteristics in the same\n       space and share the same space and be the same, for there to be an\n       identification.\n\n       Before DPS will confirm the prints belong to a certain person, Hanson “usually\n\nlike[s] to have anywhere from 8 to 12 points” or identifiers. Hanson identified State’s\n\nexhibit 131 as a copy of a lift card of an unknown print submitted to him. 7 Hanson\n\nidentified State’s exhibit 132 as a copy of a palm print card belonging to Mejia sent to\n\nhim. Hanson compared the unknown print in State’s exhibit 131 with Mejia’s print in\n\nState’s exhibit 132. Hanson determined that the unknown print in State’s exhibit 131\n\nmatched the print in State’s exhibit 132. There were a little over sixteen points of\n\nidentification. Hanson stated that he was sure that the prints matched and that his work\n\nwas reviewed by another latent print examiner who came to the same conclusion.\n\nAccording to Hanson, the unknown print was “recovered from the bottom left of the\n\nplexiglass window” lifted by “C. Lara.”\n\n\n\n\n       7\n           The original was kept by the DPS for further reference.\n\n\n                                                     10\n\fH.     Sergeant Goble\n\n       Sergeant Goble is a supervisor for the dive recovery team with the DPS.\n\nSergeant Goble was asked to assist the Victoria Police Department with a dive to\n\nrecover a nine-millimeter handgun used in a homicide from a small canal in Calhoun\n\nCounty in Port Lavaca.\n\n       Before the dive began, a man had indicated where to find the gun, which was\n\nlocated under a bridge.8 The man, later identified as Paul Garcia, threw a rock and\n\nstated that the gun had landed in the same vicinity of the rock’s location. Based on this\n\ninformation, Sergeant Goble searched the area and found a semi-automatic black\n\nhandgun in water approximately six feet deep.\n\nI.     Mistie\n\n       Mistie’s mother is Janet, and she has two brothers, Justin and Adam Juntunen.\n\nHer aunts are Paula and Natalie.         Quintanilla was Mistie’s boyfriend, and they had\n\ndated for approximately two years.\n\n       On Saturday, October 27, 2007, Mistie and Quintanilla went to Natalie’s\n\napartment. Mejia, Quintanilla’s son, Paula’s children, and Natalie’s children were at the\n\napartment. Mistie and Quintanilla were there to babysit the children because Mejia,\n\nNatalie, and Paula planned to go to a club that evening. Mistie testified that sometime\n\nthat evening, Mejia called Quintanilla asking for a ride because he had been involved in\n\na car accident. Sometime later that evening, Quintanilla went to pick up Mejia and gave\n\nhim a ride to Mejia’s brother’s house. Quintanilla returned alone to Natalie’s apartment.\n\n\n\n       8\n         Sergeant Goble could not recall the man’s name. However, on cross-examination, Sergeant\nGoble agreed that the name “Paul Garcia” did “ring a bell.”\n\n\n                                              11\n\fLater, Mejia called again, and Quintanilla picked him up, and they both returned to\n\nNatalie’s apartment.\n\n          Mistie called Janet and informed her about the accident and asked her to come\n\nand pick up Mejia at Natalie’s apartment.                Janet arrived at the same time that\n\nQuintanilla and Mejia arrived. Mistie went outside to greet them. The police drove by\n\nthe apartment complex, and everyone went inside Natalie’s apartment. Mistie testified\n\nthat Mejia stated that he needed to leave the apartment complex before the police came\n\nback because he had been involved in a car accident.\n\n          Janet gave Mejia a ride in Quintanilla’s truck. According to Mistie, Quintanilla\n\nwas not supposed to be at the apartment complex because he had been in an\n\naltercation with a street gang called “COPS.”               Janet and Mejia later went back to\n\nNatalie’s residence. Mejia told Mistie that his chest hurt because the steering wheel hit\n\nhis chest.9 Mejia stated that he lost his wallet. Although Mistie helped search for the\n\nwallet, it was not found.\n\n          Quintanilla and Mistie spent the night at Natalie’s apartment. The next morning,\n\nJanet, Justin, and Mejia arrived at the apartment, and they again searched for Mejia’s\n\nwallet.\n\n          On Monday morning, October 29, there was no school. Mistie was talking on the\n\nphone with Quintanilla when he asked her to hold because he had a call from Mejia.\n\nQuintanilla returned to the line with Mistie and told her that Mejia accused him of taking\n\nhis wallet. According to Mistie, Mejia claimed that Justin told him it was Quintanilla who\n\n          9\n          Dr. McNeil testified that on Sunday, October 28, 2007, he treated Mejia in the emergency room\nfor pain to the chest due to an injury sustained from striking the steering wheel. Dr. McNeil also noted\nthat Mejia had a seatbelt injury. According to Dr. McNeil, Mejia’s alcohol level was .34 units “over four\ntimes the legal limit.”\n\n\n                                                   12\n\fstole his wallet. Mistie testified that Mejia said that Quintanilla “better give him his stuff\n\nback or there was going to be problems,” “‘You don’t know where I come from. Don’t\n\nplay with me. I don’t play games,’” and that “‘he had other people coming down.’”\n\nMistie believed that Quintanilla “kind of took it as a threat.”\n\n       Justin then told Mistie that Mejia had called him and accused him of stealing his\n\nwallet. According to Justin, Mejia stated that Quintanilla told him that Justin had taken\n\nthe wallet. Mejia made similar threats to Justin and also stated that “he had already\n\nmade a phone call.” Justin did not clarify whom Mejia had allegedly called.\n\n       On Tuesday, October 30, 2007, Mistie went to school at approximately 8:00 a.m.\n\nWhile at school, a tube of lip gloss leaked in Mistie’s pocket, so she called Quintanilla to\n\nbring her a fresh pair of pants. Mistie called Quintanilla a second time at approximately\n\n9:15 a.m. to find out how long it would take for him to bring her the pants. Quintanilla\n\ntold her he would be there in about five minutes and instructed her to wait outside.\n\nDuring the second conversation, Quintanilla mentioned to Mistie that Justin had just left\n\nfor work.\n\n       Mistie testified that when she left for school that morning, the front door was not\n\nin the condition it was in when Janet discovered Quintanilla’s body. According to Mistie,\n\nthe residents of Janet’s home never actually locked the door. Instead, when someone\n\nwas home, they barred the door from the inside with a piece of wood across the frame\n\napproximately three inches below the doorknob.           Mistie stated that someone could\n\nreach in and remove the bar if the person pushed on the plexiglass.\n\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\fJ.     Sergeant Story\n\n       Sergeant Story is a firearms examiner with the DPS Safety Crime Lab in Austin,\n\nTexas. Sergeant Story examined the cartridge case found on the floor in the bedroom\n\nwhere Quintanilla was shot, the bullet recovered from Quintanilla’s head, and the gun\n\nSergeant Goble found in the canal. Sergeant Story “found that the cartridge case was\n\nfired in a firearm, of a 9 x 18 Makarov caliber.” Sergeant Story stated in his report that\n\nthe bullet “was fired from a firearm capable of chambering and firing a “9x18” Makarov\n\ncaliber cartridge.” He also generated a list of possible firearm brands that could have\n\nfired the bullet, including, “but not limited to, Makarov IJ70, Russian PM, Norinco, IMEZ,\n\nBaikal, and FEG.”\n\n       In a report admitted as State’s exhibit 128, Sergeant Story stated that the bullet\n\nfound in Quintanilla’s head was fired from the “9x18 Mark” gun Sergeant Goble found in\n\nthe canal. Sergeant Story also testified that, based on his analysis, it is his opinion that\n\nthe bullet was fired from the gun Sergeant Goble found in the canal. The State asked\n\nwhether he was certain that the bullet came from that weapon; Sergeant Story replied, “I\n\nam certain. I am here staking my reputation and my 35 years experience on the fact\n\nthat that bullet was fired through this firearm. If there was any doubt, there would have\n\nbeen—we would have issued a report, stating that we were unable to determine.”\n\nAccording to Sergeant Story, a “fellow examiner,” Tim Counce, confirmed his findings.\n\nK.     Reyes\n\n       Reyes was an inmate at the Victoria County Jail and incarcerated for criminal\n\nmischief at the time of Mejia’s trial. Reyes stated that he knows Mejia as “Ghost” and\n\nthat Mejia was in jail cell 1015. Reyes was in cell 1012. Reyes testified that he was in\n\n\n\n                                            14\n\fthe “criminal street gang” HPL and is an “’X’d’ out member.” Reyes stated that Mejia\n\ntold him that he is a member of the Texas Syndicate. According to Reyes, Mejia asked\n\nhim to get Garcia’s address; however, Reyes was unable to get the address.\n\n       According to Reyes, after discovering that Garcia was going to be a witness in\n\nMejia’s case, he told Mejia that it was “very disrespectful for [Mejia] to come to [Reyes]\n\nfor the address . . . .”   Reyes claimed that while in jail, Mejia had trouble sleeping\n\nbecause [Mejia] “kept seeing that little kid had a hole in his face.” Reyes testified that\n\nMejia had threatened Reyes personally twice and Reyes’s family once for providing\n\ninformation concerning Garcia to the State. Reyes stated that he had not made a deal\n\nwith the State for his testimony, and he did not have any pending criminal cases.\n\nL.     Garcia\n\n       Garcia testified that he is known as “Polito” and that his father, “Polito Garcia—\n\nPaul,” was a member of the Mexican Mafia from the age of eighteen until his death at\n\nthe age of fifty-two in a motorcycle accident. Garcia met Mejia at a friend’s house in\n\nPort Lavaca sometime before 2007.\n\n       Garcia testified that he is not in a gang, but that Mejia is a member of the Texas\n\nSyndicate.    Garcia stated that he knew that Mejia was a member of the Texas\n\nSyndicate because “[h]e bragged about it” and he “even has a tattoo for it.”\n\n       Garcia testified that Mejia told him that he believed that Quintanilla had stolen\n\n$100 to $150 from him while he was passed out. Garcia thought that perhaps the next\n\nday, Mejia asked him to pick him up from Natalie’s apartment complex. Mejia allegedly\n\nasked Garcia to bring a gun. Garcia said that he took a nine-millimeter gun with him.\n\nMejia took the gun out of the center console and “stuck it in his pants.”\n\n\n\n                                            15\n\f        According to Garcia, while they drove to Justin’s house, Mejia stated that he was\n\nmad and told him he knew that Quintanilla was at Justin’s house. Garcia stated that he\n\ndid not think that Mejia would kill Quintanilla; he believed that Mejia “was going to go\n\npush his weight and reputation around and get his money back.” Garcia assumed that\n\nMejia would use the gun to scare Quintanilla.\n\n        Garcia dropped Mejia off by Janet’s house, and while driving by an HEB, he\n\nreceived a call from Mejia to pick him up again. Garcia turned around and picked up\n\nMejia. Garcia drove Mejia back home. The next day, Garcia heard on the news that\n\nQuintanilla had been killed. Garcia stated that he “got scared” and disposed of the gun\n\nby throwing it in a “little creek that runs out to the bay” in Port Lavaca. Subsequently,\n\nMejia called Garcia asking Garcia to dispose of the gun. Garcia assisted the dive team\n\nin retrieving the gun from the water.\n\nM.      Justin\n\n        Justin stated that on the Sunday after Mejia lost his wallet, he received a phone\n\ncall from Mejia.10 Justin testified that Mejia said “that [Quintanilla] had said he seen me\n\nwith the wallet and we better take that money back, because we don’t know who he is\n\nand shit like that don’t happen to him.” According to Justin, Mejia also stated, “some\n\nhome boys were going to be coming down to take care of that issue.” Justin believed\n\nthat Mejia was threatening him and that the “home boys” were “friends that are in his\n\ngang . . . [the] Texas Syndicate.” Justin learned that Mejia had made a similar phone\n\ncall to Quintanilla.\n\n\n        10\n           The State asked Justin to review Mejia’s phone records. Justin identified a call from Mejia’s\nphone to Quintanilla’s phone that occurred on October 28, 2007 at 9:42 p.m. Justin stated that at 9:40\np.m. there was another call from Mejia’s phone to Justin’s phone.\n\n\n                                                  16\n\f        On October 30, 2007, Justin received a call from Mejia at about 7:30 a.m.11\n\nMejia allegedly said, “Fuck you. All my boys are coming down. We’re going to take\n\ncare of you.” Justin’s employer picked him up for work at approximately 8:00 a.m. or\n\n8:15 a.m.12 Justin testified that at about 9:00 a.m., Mejia called him and stated, “The\n\nlaws are fixing to home up dirty—[w]ell, approach me dirty.” According to Justin, Mejia\n\n“was telling—trying to get [him] to meet him at [Garcia’s] house.” Justin had already\n\nlearned of Quintanilla’s death when he received this call from Mejia.\n\n        The State asked Justin if the screen door was torn and if the plexiglass had been\n\npushed in when he left for work. Justin said “No.” Justin agreed that if someone\n\nwanted to get into the house, they could have removed the barricade on the front door\n\nby pushing in the plexiglass.\n\nN.      Detective Clemons\n\n        Detective Clemons of the Victoria Police Department interviewed Garcia who did\n\nnot tell her that he provided the gun for Mejia to use. On cross-examination by the\n\nState, Detective Clemons stated that Garcia appeared fearful, but she believed that he\n\nwas being truthful. Detective Clemons testified that Garcia told her that as a member of\n\nthe Texas Syndicate, Mejia was capable of killing him.\n\n        Detective Clemons reviewed the phone records that had been subpoenaed for\n\nthe trial.      According to Detective Clemons, those phone records corroborated the\n\nwitnesses’ claims that Mejia had called them to intimidate them. Detective Clemons\n\n\n        11\n           The phone records showed that on October 30, 2007, there was a call from Mejia’s phone to\nJustin’s phone at 6:35 a.m. There was another call from Mejia’s phone to Justin’s phone at 6:53 a.m. on\nthat same day. Justin did not recall these phone calls. Finally, the phone records reflect that there was\nanother call from Mejia’s phone to Justin’s phone at 7:32 a.m.\n        12\n             Justin lived with Janet at her residence.\n\n\n                                                         17\n\ftestified that the phone records she reviewed also corroborated Garcia’s claims that he\n\ndrove Mejia to the crime scene and picked him up after Quintanilla was killed.\n\n      Detective Clemons agreed that Mejia was found in Sinton, Texas and knew that\n\nhe was “wanted in this jurisdiction.” The State asked Detective Clemons if she believed\n\nMejia was fleeing, and she replied, “Yes.” Detective Clemons also agreed that her\n\ninvestigation focused on Mejia based on the following: his fingerprints were found at the\n\ncrime scene; he threatened witnesses; Garcia gave him a ride to the crime scene; and\n\nthe bullet recovered from the victim matched the gun recovered by the dive team.\n\nDetective Clemons suspected that Mejia is a member of the Texas Syndicate.\n\nM.    Mejia\n\n      Mejia denied being a member of the Texas Syndicate. He denied threatening\n\nand killing Quintanilla, threatening Justin, and asking Garcia for a gun. Mejia denied\n\nthat his tattoos were related to the Texas Syndicate and explained that all his tattoos\n\n“came out of a ‘Flash’ magazine.”\n\n                          II.    SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n      By his first issue, Mejia contends that the evidence is legally and factually\n\ninsufficient to support the judgment. Mejia argues that there is no evidence he was in a\n\ngang and there is no non-accomplice evidence linking him to the crime.\n\nA.    Standard of Review and Applicable Law\n\n      The court of criminal appeals has held that there is “no meaningful distinction\n\nbetween the Jackson v. Virginia legal sufficiency standard and the Clewis factual-\n\nsufficiency standard” and that the Jackson standard “is the only standard that a\n\nreviewing court should apply in determining whether the evidence is sufficient to support\n\n\n\n                                           18\n\feach element of a criminal offense that the State is required to prove beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.” Brooks v. State, 323 S.W.3d 893, 902–03, 912 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2010) (plurality op.). Accordingly, we will review Mejia’s claims of evidentiary sufficiency\n\nunder “a rigorous and proper application” of the Jackson standard of review. Id. at 906-\n\n07, 912. Moreover, we will not refer separately to legal or factual sufficiency and will\n\nonly analyze Mejia’s issues under the Jackson standard. See id. at 985 (concluding\n\nthat there is no meaningful distinction between a legal and factual sufficiency analysis).\n\nUnder the Jackson standard, “the relevant question is whether, after viewing the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could\n\nhave found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” Jackson v.\n\nVirginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979); see Brooks, 323 S.W.3d at 898–99 (explaining that\n\nin the Jackson standard we consider “all of the evidence in the light most favorable to\n\nthe verdict,” and determine whether the jury was rationally justified in finding guilt\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt).\n\n       “[T]he fact[-]finder’s role as weigher of the evidence is preserved through a legal\n\nconclusion that upon judicial review all of the evidence is to be considered in the light\n\nmost favorable to the prosecution.” Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319 (emphasis in original).\n\n“The jury, in all cases is the exclusive judge of facts proved and the weight to be given\n\nto the testimony . . . .” TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 38.04 (West 1979). “The jury is\n\nthe exclusive judge of the credibility of witnesses and of the weight to be given\n\ntestimony, and it is also the exclusive province of the jury to reconcile conflicts in the\n\nevidence.” Wesbrook v. State, 29 S.W.3d 103, 111 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000).\n\n\n\n\n                                            19\n\f       We measure the legal sufficiency of the evidence by the elements of the offense\n\nas defined by a hypothetically correct jury charge. Coleman v. State, 131 S.W.3d 303,\n\n314 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2004, pet. ref’d) (citing Malik v. State, 953 S.W.2d 234,\n\n240 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997)). A person commits the offense of engaging in organized\n\ncriminal activity if “with the intent to establish, maintain, or participate in a combination\n\nor in the profits of a combination or as a member of a criminal street gang, the person\n\ncommits or conspires to commit” murder. See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. §§ 19.02, 71.02.\n\n“‘Criminal street gang’ means three or more persons having a common identifying sign\n\nor symbol or an identifiable leadership who continuously or regularly associate in the\n\ncommission of criminal activities.” See id. § 71.01(d) (West 2011).\n\nB.     Discussion\n\n       Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdict, we find that\n\nthe evidence showed the following: (1) Mejia’s “home boys,” meaning other members\n\nof the Texas Syndicate, were going to retaliate against Justin and Quintanilla for\n\nstealing his wallet; (2) Mejia is a member of the Texas Syndicate; and (3) the Texas\n\nSyndicate has three or more persons having several common identifying signs and\n\nsymbols and the organization has identifiable leadership who regularly associate in the\n\ncommission of criminal activities. See id.\n\n       We conclude that a reasonable fact-finder could have found that Mejia was a\n\nmember of a gang. See Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319; Brooks, 323 S.W.3d at 898–99.\n\nThus, the evidence is sufficient in that respect.\n\n       Next, Mejia argues there was no non-accomplice evidence linking him to the\n\ncrime. We disagree.\n\n\n\n                                             20\n\f      A person cannot be convicted based upon the testimony of an accomplice unless\n\nthat testimony is “corroborated by other evidence tending to connect the defendant with\n\nthe offense committed. TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 38.14 (West 2005). It is not\n\nnecessary for the corroborating evidence to be sufficient in itself to establish guilt\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. Gill v. State, 873 S.W.2d 45, 48 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994)\n\n(en banc). The non-accomplice evidence does not have to link the accused directly to\n\nthe commission of the offense. Id. However, there must be some non-accomplice\n\nevidence that tends to connect the accused to the commission of the offense. Id. Both\n\ndirect and circumstantial evidence may furnish the necessary corroboration. Reed v.\n\nState, 744 S.W.2d 112, 126 (Tex. Crim. App. 1988) (en banc).                “Insignificant\n\ncircumstances sometimes afford most satisfactory evidence of guilt and corroboration of\n\naccomplice witness testimony.” Id.\n\n      Appellant acknowledges that his palm print was discovered by police on the\n\nplexiglass door of the crime scene. Mistie testified that in order to get into the home,\n\none could push the plexiglass in and remove the wooden barrier. Justin and Mistie\n\nstated that the plexiglass had not been pushed in when they left the home the morning\n\nQuintanilla was killed. Therefore, the palm print is non-accomplice evidence tending to\n\nconnect Mejia to the commission of Quintanilla’s murder. In addition, Justin, Mistie, and\n\nJanet testified that Mejia threatened to harm Quintanilla because Mejia claimed that\n\nQuintanilla stole his money. See Bush v. State, 628 S.W.2d 441, 444 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1982) (en banc) (providing that motive is relevant as a circumstance tending to prove\n\nthe commission of an offense); see Reed, 744 S.W.2d at 127 (stating that, although\n\nevidence of motive alone is insufficient as corroboration, it may “be considered in\n\n\n\n                                           21\n\fconnection with other evidence tending to connect the accused with the crime”).\n\nDetective Clemons testified that phone records corroborated Garcia’s testimony that he\n\nwas with Mejia at the time that the murder occurred. See Reed, 744 S.W.2d at 127\n\n(providing that evidence that the accused was at or near the scene of the crime at or\n\nabout the time of its commission, coupled with other suspicious circumstances, may\n\ntend to connect the accused to the crime so as to furnish sufficient corroboration to\n\nsupport a conviction). Finally, Detective Clemons agreed with the State that Mejia had\n\nfled to Sinton after Quintanilla had been murdered. See Gosch v. State, 829 S.W.2d\n\n775, 782 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991) (finding that the appellant’s attempted flight was a\n\nfactor that tended to connect him to the murder). We conclude that the above non-\n\naccomplice evidence was sufficient to connect Mejia to the commission of Quintanilla’s\n\nmurder. To the extent that Mejia complains that Garcia’s testimony was contradictory,\n\nhowever, we conclude that it was within the exclusive province of the jury to reconcile\n\nthose conflicts in the evidence See Wesbrook, 29 S.W.3d at 111. We overrule Mejia’s\n\nfirst issue.\n\n                 III.   INCONSISTENCIES IN THE WITNESSES TESTIMONY\n\n       By a sub-issue, Mejia argues that the witnesses committed perjury. However,\n\nMejia merely points to inconsistencies in the witnesses’ testimonies. These conflicts in\n\nthe evidence were within the exclusive province of the jury to reconcile.            Id.\n\nAccordingly, we overrule Mejia’s sub-issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\f                                 III.    PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT\n\n        By his second issue, Mejia asserts that the State engaged in prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct by:           “(a) soliciting testimony the prosecutor knew to be false[13]; (b)\n\nsubmitting false information to the trial court to secure a favorable ruling[14];\n\n(c) withholding evidence favorable to the defense; (d) continuously disregarding ruling\n\n[sic] against soliciting improper testimony; and (e) making improper comments on\n\nclosing.”\n\n        In this multifarious issue, Mejia does not present a clear argument supporting his\n\nbald assertions that the State engaged in prosecutorial misconduct. See TEX. R. APP. P.\n\n38.1(i); Stults v. State, 23 S.W.3d 198, 208 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2000, pet.\n\nref’d). As such, we may refuse to review Mejia’s multifarious issue or we may elect to\n\nconsider the issues if we are able to determine, with reasonable certainty, the alleged\n\nerror about which the complaint is made. Stults, 23 S.W.3d at 205; Shull v. United\n\nParcel Serv., 4 S.W.3d 46, 51 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1999, pet. denied). We will only\n\naddress the alleged errors that we are able to determine with reasonable certainty. See\n\nStults, 23 S.W.3d at 205; Shull, 4 S.W.3d at 51. Those issues we do not address are\n\ninadequately briefed. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i).\n\n        Mejia complains that the State failed to disclose the latent palm print found on the\n\nplexiglass before it used it at his trial, in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87\n\n(1963). Brady concerns material which is exculpatory. See id. However, the palm print\n\n\n        13\n          Mejia does not cite where in the record the State allegedly solicited false testimony. See TEX.\nR. APP. P. 38.1(i). Moreover, in his brief Mejia, without any evidentiary support, accuses all of the\nwitnesses and the prosecutor of lying at his trial. Accordingly, we conclude that this assertion is not\nadequately briefed. See id.\n        14\n             We cannot discern Mejia’s argument concerning this claim. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i).\n\n\n                                                     23\n\fin this case actually links Mejia to the commission of the murder. Therefore, Brady is\n\nnot applicable in this case. Nonetheless, as Mejia acknowledges, his trial counsel did\n\nnot object at trial on the basis of Brady. Therefore, this argument is not preserved. See\n\nKeeter v. State, 175 S.W.3d 756, 761 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005) (establishing that by not\n\nraising a separate claim related to Brady, “the appellant did not preserve for appellate\n\nreview his complaint that the trial court erred in failing to grant his motion for new trial on\n\nthe basis of a Brady violation”).\n\n       Mejia does not cite any location in the record where the prosecutor made any\n\nimproper comments during closing arguments. Furthermore, the trial court sustained\n\nthe only objection made by Mejia’s trial counsel to the State’s closing argument.\n\nTherefore, to the extent that Mejia complains of any other alleged improper comments\n\nmade by the State, we conclude that those complaints have not been preserved\n\nbecause he did not object to any other comments made by the State. See Threadgill v.\n\nState, 146 S.W.3d 654, 670 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004) (providing that the appellant must\n\nobject to improper closing argument); see Adams v. State, No. 13-09-334-CR, 2010\n\nTex. App. LEXIS 5588, at *41 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi July 15, 2010, pet. ref’d)\n\n(mem. op., not designated for publication) (“[F]ailure to object to jury argument forfeits\n\nthe right to raise the issue on appeal.”).\n\n       Accordingly, we overrule Mejia’s second issue.\n\n                IV.    DENIAL OF MEJIA’S MOTION TO SUBSTITUTE COUNSEL\n\n       By his third issue, Mejia complains that the trial court abused its discretion by not\n\nallowing him to substitute his trial counsel. Without citation to the record, Mejia makes\n\nthe bald assertion that the trial court did not read his letter motion requesting a\n\n\n\n                                              24\n\fsubstitution of counsel. Mejia then states that the trial court “went so far as to order”\n\nMejia’s “silence” during a “pretrial hearing.” Mejia does not cite to the record of this\n\npretrial hearing but claims he was denied access to the courts. We find that Mejia’s\n\nclaim that he was denied access to the courts is without merit. Moreover, we have\n\nreviewed transcripts of pretrial hearings held on May 14, 2008, May 28, 2008, August\n\n19, 2008, September 19, 2008, December 17, 2008, January 21, 2009, March 26, 2009,\n\nApril 15, 2009, April 17, 2009, April 20, 2009, April 20, 2009, and June 10, 2009. The\n\ntrial court did not order silence from Mejia at any of these hearings.\n\n       At the April 20, 2009 hearing, Mejia stated that he objected to the “way [his] case\n\nha[d] been handled” because he had not “received hardly any statements or police\n\nreports” and did not “know anything about the case.” The trial court explained that\n\n“[u]nder the open file discovery . . . the attorneys are able to get information they would\n\nnot otherwise be able to get on discovery, but they’re not able to give [the defendant]\n\ncopies of those documents . . . .” Mejia stated that he understood the open discovery\n\npolicy and did not want copies but wanted twenty minutes of the attorney’s time. Mejia’s\n\nlead trial counsel, Luis Martinez, was apparently ill and was not present at this hearing.\n\nThe trial court stated that it would determine whether second trial counsel, Alex Luna,\n\nwould take over for Martinez at the next hearing.\n\n       At the next hearing held on April 24, 2009, the trial court stated it would be\n\ndeciding whether Luna would be taking over for Martinez. Luna told the trial court that\n\nMejia was informing him that it was possible that “an attorney out of Corpus [would] be\n\nrepresenting him, also.” The trial court then reset the trial for June 10, 2009. Mejia then\n\nstated, “That will give me time to talk to the attorney.” Mejia then complained that the\n\n\n\n                                            25\n\fankle restraints he was required to wear while in jail were causing sores. The trial court\n\nthen asked if he preferred to set a pre-trial hearing instead. Luna stated he would. So,\n\nthe trial court stated, “All right.          Then, June 10, at 9:00 a.m., for jury\n\nannouncements. . . . Right now Mr. Martinez is still in the case. If he’s able to assist\n\nfine, but, if it’s determined that you need someone else to assist you, you know, for the\n\ntrial, then I will appoint another attorney to assist you.”\n\n       Mejia does not cite to any point in the record wherein the trial court denied his\n\nrequest to substitute counsel. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i). In fact, it appears from the\n\nrecord that the trial court was willing to work with Mejia concerning appointment of new\n\ntrial counsel.   We are not required to review this voluminous record in order to\n\ndetermine whether the trial court abused its discretion. See Russeau v. State, 291\n\nS.W.3d 426, 437 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009) (refusing to search a voluminous record to\n\ndetermine whether the appellant preserved complaint for appellate review); Segundo v.\n\nState, 270 S.W.3d 79, 106 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008) (“It is not the appellate court's\n\nresponsibility to wade through voluminous records in search of material that is missing\n\nfrom its referenced location.”). Thus, we need not investigate Mejia’s claim further.\n\nAccordingly, we overrule his third issue.\n\n                    V.     ADMISSION OF PICTURES OF MEJIA’S TATTOOS\n\n       By his fourth issues, Mejia complains that the trial court improperly admitted\n\npictures of his tattoos.\n\n       We review a trial court’s decision to admit or exclude evidence under an abuse of\n\ndiscretion standard. Martinez v. State, 327 S.W.3d 727, 736 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011);\n\nGreen v. State, 934 S.W.2d 92, 101–02 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996); Montgomery v. State,\n\n\n\n                                              26\n\f810 S.W.2d 372, 379-80 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990) (en banc). We may not reverse the\n\njudgment if the trial court’s decision is within the zone of reasonable disagreement.\n\nMartinez, 327 S.W.3d at 736; State v. Dixon, 206 S.W.3d 587, 590 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2006); Green, 934 S.W.2d at 102; Montgomery, 810 S.W.2d at 391.\n\n       On appeal, Mejia complains that the pictures were admitted in violation of rules of\n\nevidence 402 and 403. See TEX. R. EVID. 402, 403. However, at trial, Mejia’s trial\n\ncounsel did not object to the pictures on the basis of rules 402 and 403. Therefore,\n\nMejia’s complaint on appeal has not been preserved.        See TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a)\n\n(providing that error must be preserved by a timely objection); Keeter v. State, 175\n\nS.W.3d 756, 759–60 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005) (explaining that we cannot find that the trial\n\ncourt erred when the appellant failed to make the complaint to it); see also Gallo v.\n\nState, 239 S.W.3d 757, 768 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007) (providing that appellate arguments\n\nmust comport with objections at trial); Swain v. State, 181 S.W.3d 359, 367 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2005) (setting out that appellant did not preserve issue for appellate review\n\nbecause his argument at trial did not comport with his argument on appeal).           We\n\noverrule Mejia’s fourth issue.\n\n       By a sub-issue, Mejia complains that the trial court violated rule of evidence 614\n\nby allowing Garcia to testify. Mejia has not provided a clear and concise argument for\n\nhis sub-issue. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i). Accordingly, we overrule it. See id.\n\n                       VI.       INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL\n\n       By his fifth issue, Mejia contends that his trial counsel rendered ineffective\n\nassistance for a variety of reasons. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687\n\n(1984). Again, Mejia has provided a multifarious issue. As such, we may refuse to\n\n\n\n                                             27\n\freview Mejia’s multifarious issue or we may elect to consider the issues if we are able to\n\ndetermine, with reasonable certainty, the alleged error about which the complaint is\n\nmade. Stults, 23 S.W.3d at 205; Shull, 4 S.W.3d at 51. We will only address the\n\nalleged errors that we are able to determine with reasonable certainty. See Stults, 23\n\nS.W.3d at 205; Shull, 4 S.W.3d at 51.            Those issues we do not address are\n\ninadequately briefed. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i).\n\n       First, Mejia contends that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by\n\nfailing to object to Reyes’s entire testimony.    Mejia neither states under what rules\n\nReyes’s entire testimony was inadmissible nor establishes that there is a reasonable\n\nprobability that but for Reyes’s testimony he would not have been convicted.          See\n\nJackson v. State, 877 S.W.2d 768, 771 (Tex. Crim App. 1994) (explaining that to\n\nestablish an ineffective assistance claim, the appellant must affirmatively show that trial\n\ncounsel’s performance was deficient and that the deficiency was prejudicial).\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that trial counsel should have objected to his entire\n\ntestimony.\n\n       Mejia next argues that trial counsel was ineffective for not objecting to the\n\nprosecutor’s closing comments. Mejia does not specify which comments he is referring\n\nto; however, he refers to a section in his brief, section “‘2(e).’” In that section, Mejia\n\nclaimed that the State improperly read the law to the jury. However, Mejia did not cite to\n\nthe record or provide a clear and concise argument to support his contention. See TEX.\n\nR. APP. P. 38.1(i). Therefore, we are unable to address this issue. See id.\n\n       Next, Mejia complains that defense counsel was ineffective by failing to\n\ninvestigate the “true origins” of his tattoos. He states, “defense counsel was unable to\n\n\n\n                                            28\n\frebut the State’s claims that such were of gang origin leaving Appellant’s contention of\n\nsuch unsubstantiated and the defense inadvanced against that which was pivotal to the\n\nState’s case in proving the engaging factor of the charge of the indictment.” This is the\n\nextent of Mejia’s argument.     However, defense counsel did ask Mejia whether his\n\ntattoos were gang related, and Mejia testified that his tattoos were not gang related.\n\nMejia testified that he copied his tattoos from a tattoo magazine. Therefore, defense\n\ncounsel did attempt to rebut the State’s claim that Mejia’s tattoos were gang related.\n\n      We overrule Mejia’s fifth issue.\n\n                                   VII.   CONCLUSION\n\n      We affirm the trial court’s judgment.\n\n                                                       __________________\n                                                       ROGELIO VALDEZ\n                                                       Chief Justice\nDo not Publish.\nTEX.

See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. §§ 19.02, 71.02\n\n(West 2011). Mejia was sentenced to life imprisonment.1 By five issues, in his pro se\n\nbrief, Mejia contends that: (1) the evidence is legally and factually insufficient; (2) the\n\n\n       1\n        The jury found that appellant was a repeat felony offender. See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. § 12.42\n(West Supp. 2011).\n\fState engaged in prosecutorial misconduct for a variety of reasons; (3) the trial court\n\nabused its discretion by “not allowing [him] to object to trial counsel and forcing [him] to\n\ntrial with an attorney with whom he ha[d] become embroiled in irreconcilable conflict”;\n\n(4) the trial court improperly admitted certain evidence at trial; and (5) defense counsel\n\nwas ineffective.2 We affirm.\n\n                                        I.     THE EVIDENCE\n\n       The State presented the testimony from, among others, Rosie Ann Arce, Janet\n\nSertuche (“Janet”), Kelly Flood, Harminda Narula, M.D., Holly Jedlicka, Chris Garcia,\n\nWalter Henson, Charles Ray Goble, Mistie De Los Santos (“Mistie”), John McNeill,\n\nM.D., Paul Garcia, Calvin S. Story Jr., Justin De Los Santos (“Justin”), Amanda\n\nClemons, and Pedro Reyes Jr. The trial court also admitted numerous State’s exhibits\n\nat trial, including, among other things, an audio recording of Sertuche’s call to 911, and\n\na video recording of the crime scene.            Mejia testified on his own behalf.   He also\n\npresented the testimony of Detective Clemons among others.\n\nA.     Arce\n\n       Arce testified that on Tuesday, October 30, 2007, her son Derrick Quintanilla\n\ndied as a result of a gunshot wound to the head. At the time of his death, Quintanilla\n\nhad been dating Mistie for approximately four months. Quintanilla’s body was found at\n\nMistie’s residence in Victoria, Texas.\n\nB.     Janet Sertuche\n\n       Janet testified that Mistie is her daughter and Justin is her son. On October 30,\n\n2007, Janet lived on Guadalupe Street in Victoria. Quintanilla occasionally spent the\n\n\n       2\n           We have renumbered and reorganized Mejia’s six issues.\n\n\n                                                   2\n\fnight at Janet’s home. Justin and Quintanilla’s relationship was frayed when Quintanilla\n\nbegan dating Mistie; however, the conflict had been resolved before Quintanilla’s death.\n\nAccording to Janet, Quintanilla and Mistie had been dating for almost two years. Mistie\n\nwas fifteen at the time of Quintanilla’s death and Quintanilla was seventeen.\n\n       Mejia was dating Janet’s sister, Natalie Sertuche.              On October 28, 2007,\n\nQuintanilla and Mistie babysat Natalie’s children at her apartment. Janet assumed that\n\nMejia also resided at the apartment because “[h]e was there.” On that day, Janet had to\n\ngo to Natalie’s apartment to check on Natalie’s son and her other sister Paula’s two\n\nsons because there was an automobile accident. The accident involved Paula, Natalie,\n\nand Mejia. Paula and Natalie went to the hospital. Mejia was injured; however, he did\n\nnot go to the hospital.\n\n       When Janet arrived at Natalie’s apartment, she saw Mejia and Quintanilla arrive\n\nalso. This occurred in the morning hours of October 28. When the police arrived at the\n\napartment complex, Mejia told Janet he did not want to be there, so she took him to her\n\nresidence. When Janet later took Mejia back to Natalie’s apartment, Mejia complained\n\nthat his wallet and money were missing. Mejia believed that he had forgotten his wallet\n\nin his brother, Paul’s car. The wallet was found in Natalie’s apartment on the kitchen\n\ntable the next morning.\n\n       Janet stated that subsequently, she called Natalie3 and that Mejia took the phone\n\naway from Natalie and said, “‘That was fucked up, what they did, screwing me over like\n\nthat, when I was all messed up. But they’re going to pay. There’s nothing you can do\n\nto protect them. I’ve already called my boys and they are coming down [and they’re on\n\n\n       3\n           It is unclear from Janet’s testimony when she called her.\n\n\n                                                      3\n\ftheir way] and they don’t play.’” According to Janet, Mejia stated that Quintanilla, Mistie,\n\nand Justin should be concerned about his threat.\n\n         Quintanilla spent the night at Janet’s residence on October 29, 2007. Janet had\n\nthe overnight shift at work and returned home at “around” 7:45 a.m. Mistie needed to\n\ngo to school, and Quintanilla had an appointment at the attorney general’s office. Janet\n\ntook Mistie to school some time after 8:00 a.m. Justin and Quintanilla remained at\n\nhome. When Janet left, Justin was asleep and Quintanilla was attempting to go back to\n\nsleep.\n\n         After dropping Mistie off at school, Janet went to her other daughter’s residence.\n\nWhile there, Janet received a phone call from an unknown person. The caller told Janet\n\nthat “there would be police officers up in [her] house. They wanted to know if [her] son\n\nwas at home and, if not, he has a key—There was going to be a lot of law at [her]\n\nhouse.” Janet immediately returned home and discovered that the screen door was\n\ntorn and the “plexiglass on [her] front door was pushed in.” Janet then went to her\n\nbedroom and discovered Quintanilla’s lifeless body.\n\n         Janet stated that Justin and Quintanilla both had friends that were in different\n\ngangs. Janet did not know whether Justin was associated with any gangs. According\n\nto Janet, Justin and Quintanilla had been involved in altercations with members of\n\ngangs. Janet once witnessed Justin and Quintanilla fighting with some boys at Natalie’s\n\napartment complex.\n\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\fC.   Flood\n\n        Officer Flood, a Victoria Police Department Officer, responded to Janet’s call to\n\n911. While at Janet’s residence, Janet told Officer Flood that she knew who had killed\n\nQuintanilla but would not reveal the person’s identity out of fear. Officer Flood said:\n\n              She began talking about a car accident that [Quintanilla] and her\n        daughter had called her about. There was another guy with them at the\n        time and she was supposed to go—[t]hey were supposed to—[s]omebody\n        was supposed to go pick this guy up, along with [Quintanilla].\n\n                ....\n\n                And she believed that that was the guy who had killed him.\n\n        A nine-millimeter casing was found at the crime scene. Quintanilla had been\n\nshot in the face and was bleeding from his nose. Flood found that Quintanilla had a\n\n“very faint and very weak” pulse.4\n\n        On re-direct examination, Flood testified that Janet told her that “her daughter\n\nand [Quintanilla] had received a phone call from the guy they had given a ride to and he\n\nbelieved that Mistie and [Quintanilla] had taken his wallet and he wanted the money\n\nback or he was going to come back after them.” Janet was “concerned for herself and\n\nher family. After that, her main concern was getting in touch with her daughter, who\n\nwas at school, and making sure no one would harm her daughter.”\n\nD.      Dr. Narula\n\n        Dr. Narula is a forensic pathologist who works for the Nueces County Medical\n\nExaminer’s Office as a contract medical examiner. The autopsy showed that Quintanilla\n\nhad been shot in the right cheek. There was “tiny gunpowder stippling” around the\n\n\n        4\n          Another responding officer, Zachary Thomas McDaniel testified that he could not recall whether\nQuintanilla had a pulse.\n\n\n                                                   5\n\fwound. There was also “very few scattered, tiny splitting marks on the upper eyelid and\n\non the side of the nose.” Dr. Narula opined that the wound was caused by a handgun at\n\n“close-range” held “anywhere from two to four inches” away from Quintanilla’s head.\n\nThe bullet was located “inside the skull [in the] tissue on the left side of the back of the\n\nhead.” The gunshot wound was the sole cause of Quintanilla’s death. The manner of\n\ndeath was classified as a homicide. A bullet that was recovered from Quintanilla’s body\n\nwas released to Jedlicka on October 31, 2007.\n\nE.     Jedlicka\n\n       Jedlicka is a crime scene supervisor with the Victoria Police Department. One of\n\nJedlicka’s job duties is to “develop latent prints” and she has been trained to “do\n\nidentifications, through fingerprint analysis.”     Among other things, Jedlicka took\n\nphotographs of the crime scene at Janet’s residence, processed evidence, and kept the\n\nchain of custody of the evidence. Jedlicka collected a spent shell casing from the\n\nbedroom floor at the crime scene. Jedlicka also collected a portion of the plexiglass\n\nfrom Janet’s front door. Crystal Lara lifted a palm print from the plexiglass. On cross-\n\nexamination, Jedlicka clarified that the print was located “at the very bottom [of the\n\nplexiglass], where it was pushed in.”\n\nF.     Officer Garcia\n\n       Officer Garcia, a police officer with the Victoria County Sheriff’s Office, is a “gang\n\nexpert.” According to Officer Garcia, the Texas Syndicate is a prison gang that has\n\nidentifying marks including, among other things, the Texas Longhorns logo.\n\n“Sometimes they’ll have an ‘S,’ with a five point star in the middle. It’s not for sure.\n\nAlso, they’re called ‘Los [Cuernos],’ . . . which means—which basically, means horns, in\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\fSpanish—or, longhorns is a better description.”                Officer Garcia stated that some\n\nmembers have “TS” or “1920 Specialty” instead of “TS” because S is the nineteenth\n\nletter of the alphabet and T is the twentieth.\n\n        Officer Garcia explained that persons confirmed to be members of groups such\n\nas the Texas Syndicate in prison are “placed in administrative segregation, which is\n\nbasically, locked up for hours.” Therefore, many of the members “try to disguise their\n\nmembership, so it’s not readily available or recognizable to security guards or correction\n\nofficers. . . .” Officer Garcia testified that the Texas Syndicate is also considered a\n\nstreet gang. Officer Garcia stated that to acquire money, the organization engages in\n\n“[e]xtortion, narcotics, assaults, contract hits—[t]hat kind of thing.” According to Officer\n\nGarcia, the organization is comprised of three or more members who participate in the\n\ncommission of criminal activity. Officer Garcia stated that specifically in 2007 there\n\nwere at least ten members of the Texas Syndicate in Victoria.\n\n        Officer Garcia testified that he believed that Mejia is “associated with the Texas\n\nSyndicate.”      Officer Garcia described Mejia as “an up-and-coming member” of the\n\nTexas Syndicate. Officer Garcia believed that Mejia’s numerous tattoos showed his\n\naffiliation with the group and that he had attempted to camouflage that affiliation. During\n\nhis testimony, Officer Garcia referred to pictures of Mejia’s tattoos that had been\n\n“highlighted” in order to show the camouflaged images. The pictures were admitted for\n\ndemonstrative purposes over Mejia’s objection that they “were altered and the\n\nalterations weren’t by [Officer Garcia] and it [had not] been established who did the\n\nalterations.”5\n\n        5\n          During a proceeding outside the jury’s presence, District Attorney Steven Tyler stated that he\nhad altered the exhibits.\n\n                                                   7\n\f       When the State published the pictures of Mejia’s tattoos to the jury on an\n\noverhead projector, Officer Garcia “trace[d] over” one tattoo, stating there is the shape\n\nof a “T” and another image “could be considered to be an ‘S.’” 6 The picture Officer\n\nGarcia “trace[d] over” had not been “highlighted.” Officer Garcia repeated his tracing\n\nover the shapes depicted in several other pictures of Mejia’s numerous tattoos. Officer\n\nGarcia also stated that many of Mejia’s tattoos also had the “cuernos” or horns which in\n\nhis opinion were indicative of membership in the Texas Syndicate.\n\n       According to Officer Garcia, a high ranking member of a gang cannot tolerate\n\n“disrespect from gang members with less rank, . . . other gangs or from known gang\n\nmembers” because that is a sign of weakness. Members of the gang who have been\n\ndisrespectful would be disciplined, such as being “beat down, hurt very, very seriously,\n\nsomeone could be killed. It depends on how serious the disrespect was and that it\n\nwasn’t handled.”         Officer Garcia explained that if a senior gang member failed to\n\ndiscipline a member who was disrespectful, that senior member could also be in trouble\n\nwith the “higher ups.”\n\n       Officer Garcia agreed that “maintaining the prestige of the Texas Syndicate is\n\npart of the Texas Syndicate business.” According to Officer Garcia, a member of the\n\nTexas Syndicate in a leadership position could be demoted or “removed completely” if\n\nhe failed to “uphold the prestige” of the organization, or “his individual prestige and\n\nrespect.” To be “removed completely” means that the person is killed.\n\n       The State asked, “Now a hypothetical—[i]f a person was a member of the Texas\n\nSyndicate and he allowed a non-member, or a person affiliated with a street gang, to\n\n\n       6\n           It is apparent from the record that Officer Garcia used a laser pointer to “trace over” the images.\n\n\n                                                       8\n\frob him personally or ‘jack’ him personally, would he have a responsibility, as a Texas\n\nSyndicate member, to take action?” Officer Garcia responded:\n\n             Yes. He would [have] responsibility to correct what was done about\n      the reputation of the Syndicate . . . . [And] [t]hat would be [gang\n      business]. It would be looked at by the higher ups, to make sure it’s being\n      taken care of properly. . . . [If the person who committed the jacking was\n      being recruited by the Texas Syndicate i]t would make it more imperative\n      for him [the leader] to [discipline the recruit]. They are coming up with the\n      prospect of ‘esquina,’ which is the corner before it hits ‘prospecto.’ And\n      once they are ‘prospecto,’ they have to do things correctly. And when\n      they fail to do that, they have to suffer the consequences, to get on the\n      correct track. And it’s the responsibility of the leadership to correct that or\n      have somebody to enact it for them.\n\n      Officer Garcia did not know whether Quintanilla was a member of the Texas\n\nSyndicate. Officer Garcia indicated that he did not know anything about Quintanilla.\n\nOfficer Garcia testified that Mejia’s father and brother were both confirmed members of\n\nthe Texas Syndicate and that, individuals often become members of the organization by\n\nway of a legacy membership. Officer Garcia explained a legacy means that someone in\n\nthe family is already a member of the organization.        On cross-examination, Officer\n\nGarcia agreed that it was suspected that Mejia was a leader of the organization.\n\nG.    Hanson\n\n      Hanson is a latent print examiner with the crime lab of the Texas Department of\n\nPublic Safety (“DPS”). He stated that no two people have the same fingerprints. When\n\nidentifying an unknown print, Hanson compares it to an exemplar of a known person’s\n\nprints. The State asked Hanson to explain the process in comparing an unknown print\n\nto an exemplar. Hanson replied:\n\n             The skin on your hand is different than the other areas of your\n      body. It’s rough and it’s textured. It’s raised. There are corrugations or\n      ridges and furrows. These ridges, while flowing in a pattern, tend to end\n      abruptly or they tend to fork into two or more ridges or they have short\n\n                                            9\n\f       ridges or islands or dots. And we take those characteristics and we make\n       sure that they share the spatial relation in the tow prints and that they’re\n       the same in both prints, to make on identification—\n\nHanson agreed that when comparing the prints, he is “looking for . . . the same fork on\n\nthe same pattern.” Hanson explained:\n\n              There are several other things, in addition to the characteristics or\n       points that come in as a factor in an identification.\n\n             Are the two pattern types the same? Are they both loops? Are\n       they both arches?\n\n               Again, they have to have the same characteristics in the same\n       space and share the same space and be the same, for there to be an\n       identification.\n\n       Before DPS will confirm the prints belong to a certain person, Hanson “usually\n\nlike[s] to have anywhere from 8 to 12 points” or identifiers. Hanson identified State’s\n\nexhibit 131 as a copy of a lift card of an unknown print submitted to him. 7 Hanson\n\nidentified State’s exhibit 132 as a copy of a palm print card belonging to Mejia sent to\n\nhim. Hanson compared the unknown print in State’s exhibit 131 with Mejia’s print in\n\nState’s exhibit 132. Hanson determined that the unknown print in State’s exhibit 131\n\nmatched the print in State’s exhibit 132. There were a little over sixteen points of\n\nidentification. Hanson stated that he was sure that the prints matched and that his work\n\nwas reviewed by another latent print examiner who came to the same conclusion.\n\nAccording to Hanson, the unknown print was “recovered from the bottom left of the\n\nplexiglass window” lifted by “C. Lara.”\n\n\n\n\n       7\n           The original was kept by the DPS for further reference.\n\n\n                                                     10\n\fH.     Sergeant Goble\n\n       Sergeant Goble is a supervisor for the dive recovery team with the DPS.\n\nSergeant Goble was asked to assist the Victoria Police Department with a dive to\n\nrecover a nine-millimeter handgun used in a homicide from a small canal in Calhoun\n\nCounty in Port Lavaca.\n\n       Before the dive began, a man had indicated where to find the gun, which was\n\nlocated under a bridge.8 The man, later identified as Paul Garcia, threw a rock and\n\nstated that the gun had landed in the same vicinity of the rock’s location. Based on this\n\ninformation, Sergeant Goble searched the area and found a semi-automatic black\n\nhandgun in water approximately six feet deep.\n\nI.     Mistie\n\n       Mistie’s mother is Janet, and she has two brothers, Justin and Adam Juntunen.\n\nHer aunts are Paula and Natalie.         Quintanilla was Mistie’s boyfriend, and they had\n\ndated for approximately two years.\n\n       On Saturday, October 27, 2007, Mistie and Quintanilla went to Natalie’s\n\napartment. Mejia, Quintanilla’s son, Paula’s children, and Natalie’s children were at the\n\napartment. Mistie and Quintanilla were there to babysit the children because Mejia,\n\nNatalie, and Paula planned to go to a club that evening. Mistie testified that sometime\n\nthat evening, Mejia called Quintanilla asking for a ride because he had been involved in\n\na car accident. Sometime later that evening, Quintanilla went to pick up Mejia and gave\n\nhim a ride to Mejia’s brother’s house. Quintanilla returned alone to Natalie’s apartment.\n\n\n\n       8\n         Sergeant Goble could not recall the man’s name. However, on cross-examination, Sergeant\nGoble agreed that the name “Paul Garcia” did “ring a bell.”\n\n\n                                              11\n\fLater, Mejia called again, and Quintanilla picked him up, and they both returned to\n\nNatalie’s apartment.\n\n          Mistie called Janet and informed her about the accident and asked her to come\n\nand pick up Mejia at Natalie’s apartment.                Janet arrived at the same time that\n\nQuintanilla and Mejia arrived. Mistie went outside to greet them. The police drove by\n\nthe apartment complex, and everyone went inside Natalie’s apartment. Mistie testified\n\nthat Mejia stated that he needed to leave the apartment complex before the police came\n\nback because he had been involved in a car accident.\n\n          Janet gave Mejia a ride in Quintanilla’s truck. According to Mistie, Quintanilla\n\nwas not supposed to be at the apartment complex because he had been in an\n\naltercation with a street gang called “COPS.”               Janet and Mejia later went back to\n\nNatalie’s residence. Mejia told Mistie that his chest hurt because the steering wheel hit\n\nhis chest.9 Mejia stated that he lost his wallet. Although Mistie helped search for the\n\nwallet, it was not found.\n\n          Quintanilla and Mistie spent the night at Natalie’s apartment. The next morning,\n\nJanet, Justin, and Mejia arrived at the apartment, and they again searched for Mejia’s\n\nwallet.\n\n          On Monday morning, October 29, there was no school. Mistie was talking on the\n\nphone with Quintanilla when he asked her to hold because he had a call from Mejia.\n\nQuintanilla returned to the line with Mistie and told her that Mejia accused him of taking\n\nhis wallet. According to Mistie, Mejia claimed that Justin told him it was Quintanilla who\n\n          9\n          Dr. McNeil testified that on Sunday, October 28, 2007, he treated Mejia in the emergency room\nfor pain to the chest due to an injury sustained from striking the steering wheel. Dr. McNeil also noted\nthat Mejia had a seatbelt injury. According to Dr. McNeil, Mejia’s alcohol level was .34 units “over four\ntimes the legal limit.”\n\n\n                                                   12\n\fstole his wallet. Mistie testified that Mejia said that Quintanilla “better give him his stuff\n\nback or there was going to be problems,” “‘You don’t know where I come from. Don’t\n\nplay with me. I don’t play games,’” and that “‘he had other people coming down.’”\n\nMistie believed that Quintanilla “kind of took it as a threat.”\n\n       Justin then told Mistie that Mejia had called him and accused him of stealing his\n\nwallet. According to Justin, Mejia stated that Quintanilla told him that Justin had taken\n\nthe wallet. Mejia made similar threats to Justin and also stated that “he had already\n\nmade a phone call.” Justin did not clarify whom Mejia had allegedly called.\n\n       On Tuesday, October 30, 2007, Mistie went to school at approximately 8:00 a.m.\n\nWhile at school, a tube of lip gloss leaked in Mistie’s pocket, so she called Quintanilla to\n\nbring her a fresh pair of pants. Mistie called Quintanilla a second time at approximately\n\n9:15 a.m. to find out how long it would take for him to bring her the pants. Quintanilla\n\ntold her he would be there in about five minutes and instructed her to wait outside.\n\nDuring the second conversation, Quintanilla mentioned to Mistie that Justin had just left\n\nfor work.\n\n       Mistie testified that when she left for school that morning, the front door was not\n\nin the condition it was in when Janet discovered Quintanilla’s body. According to Mistie,\n\nthe residents of Janet’s home never actually locked the door. Instead, when someone\n\nwas home, they barred the door from the inside with a piece of wood across the frame\n\napproximately three inches below the doorknob.           Mistie stated that someone could\n\nreach in and remove the bar if the person pushed on the plexiglass.\n\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\fJ.     Sergeant Story\n\n       Sergeant Story is a firearms examiner with the DPS Safety Crime Lab in Austin,\n\nTexas. Sergeant Story examined the cartridge case found on the floor in the bedroom\n\nwhere Quintanilla was shot, the bullet recovered from Quintanilla’s head, and the gun\n\nSergeant Goble found in the canal. Sergeant Story “found that the cartridge case was\n\nfired in a firearm, of a 9 x 18 Makarov caliber.” Sergeant Story stated in his report that\n\nthe bullet “was fired from a firearm capable of chambering and firing a “9x18” Makarov\n\ncaliber cartridge.” He also generated a list of possible firearm brands that could have\n\nfired the bullet, including, “but not limited to, Makarov IJ70, Russian PM, Norinco, IMEZ,\n\nBaikal, and FEG.”\n\n       In a report admitted as State’s exhibit 128, Sergeant Story stated that the bullet\n\nfound in Quintanilla’s head was fired from the “9x18 Mark” gun Sergeant Goble found in\n\nthe canal. Sergeant Story also testified that, based on his analysis, it is his opinion that\n\nthe bullet was fired from the gun Sergeant Goble found in the canal. The State asked\n\nwhether he was certain that the bullet came from that weapon; Sergeant Story replied, “I\n\nam certain. I am here staking my reputation and my 35 years experience on the fact\n\nthat that bullet was fired through this firearm. If there was any doubt, there would have\n\nbeen—we would have issued a report, stating that we were unable to determine.”\n\nAccording to Sergeant Story, a “fellow examiner,” Tim Counce, confirmed his findings.\n\nK.     Reyes\n\n       Reyes was an inmate at the Victoria County Jail and incarcerated for criminal\n\nmischief at the time of Mejia’s trial. Reyes stated that he knows Mejia as “Ghost” and\n\nthat Mejia was in jail cell 1015. Reyes was in cell 1012. Reyes testified that he was in\n\n\n\n                                            14\n\fthe “criminal street gang” HPL and is an “’X’d’ out member.” Reyes stated that Mejia\n\ntold him that he is a member of the Texas Syndicate. According to Reyes, Mejia asked\n\nhim to get Garcia’s address; however, Reyes was unable to get the address.\n\n       According to Reyes, after discovering that Garcia was going to be a witness in\n\nMejia’s case, he told Mejia that it was “very disrespectful for [Mejia] to come to [Reyes]\n\nfor the address . . . .”   Reyes claimed that while in jail, Mejia had trouble sleeping\n\nbecause [Mejia] “kept seeing that little kid had a hole in his face.” Reyes testified that\n\nMejia had threatened Reyes personally twice and Reyes’s family once for providing\n\ninformation concerning Garcia to the State. Reyes stated that he had not made a deal\n\nwith the State for his testimony, and he did not have any pending criminal cases.\n\nL.     Garcia\n\n       Garcia testified that he is known as “Polito” and that his father, “Polito Garcia—\n\nPaul,” was a member of the Mexican Mafia from the age of eighteen until his death at\n\nthe age of fifty-two in a motorcycle accident. Garcia met Mejia at a friend’s house in\n\nPort Lavaca sometime before 2007.\n\n       Garcia testified that he is not in a gang, but that Mejia is a member of the Texas\n\nSyndicate.    Garcia stated that he knew that Mejia was a member of the Texas\n\nSyndicate because “[h]e bragged about it” and he “even has a tattoo for it.”\n\n       Garcia testified that Mejia told him that he believed that Quintanilla had stolen\n\n$100 to $150 from him while he was passed out. Garcia thought that perhaps the next\n\nday, Mejia asked him to pick him up from Natalie’s apartment complex. Mejia allegedly\n\nasked Garcia to bring a gun. Garcia said that he took a nine-millimeter gun with him.\n\nMejia took the gun out of the center console and “stuck it in his pants.”\n\n\n\n                                            15\n\f        According to Garcia, while they drove to Justin’s house, Mejia stated that he was\n\nmad and told him he knew that Quintanilla was at Justin’s house. Garcia stated that he\n\ndid not think that Mejia would kill Quintanilla; he believed that Mejia “was going to go\n\npush his weight and reputation around and get his money back.” Garcia assumed that\n\nMejia would use the gun to scare Quintanilla.\n\n        Garcia dropped Mejia off by Janet’s house, and while driving by an HEB, he\n\nreceived a call from Mejia to pick him up again. Garcia turned around and picked up\n\nMejia. Garcia drove Mejia back home. The next day, Garcia heard on the news that\n\nQuintanilla had been killed. Garcia stated that he “got scared” and disposed of the gun\n\nby throwing it in a “little creek that runs out to the bay” in Port Lavaca. Subsequently,\n\nMejia called Garcia asking Garcia to dispose of the gun. Garcia assisted the dive team\n\nin retrieving the gun from the water.\n\nM.      Justin\n\n        Justin stated that on the Sunday after Mejia lost his wallet, he received a phone\n\ncall from Mejia.10 Justin testified that Mejia said “that [Quintanilla] had said he seen me\n\nwith the wallet and we better take that money back, because we don’t know who he is\n\nand shit like that don’t happen to him.” According to Justin, Mejia also stated, “some\n\nhome boys were going to be coming down to take care of that issue.” Justin believed\n\nthat Mejia was threatening him and that the “home boys” were “friends that are in his\n\ngang . . . [the] Texas Syndicate.” Justin learned that Mejia had made a similar phone\n\ncall to Quintanilla.\n\n\n        10\n           The State asked Justin to review Mejia’s phone records. Justin identified a call from Mejia’s\nphone to Quintanilla’s phone that occurred on October 28, 2007 at 9:42 p.m. Justin stated that at 9:40\np.m. there was another call from Mejia’s phone to Justin’s phone.\n\n\n                                                  16\n\f        On October 30, 2007, Justin received a call from Mejia at about 7:30 a.m.11\n\nMejia allegedly said, “Fuck you. All my boys are coming down. We’re going to take\n\ncare of you.” Justin’s employer picked him up for work at approximately 8:00 a.m. or\n\n8:15 a.m.12 Justin testified that at about 9:00 a.m., Mejia called him and stated, “The\n\nlaws are fixing to home up dirty—[w]ell, approach me dirty.” According to Justin, Mejia\n\n“was telling—trying to get [him] to meet him at [Garcia’s] house.” Justin had already\n\nlearned of Quintanilla’s death when he received this call from Mejia.\n\n        The State asked Justin if the screen door was torn and if the plexiglass had been\n\npushed in when he left for work. Justin said “No.” Justin agreed that if someone\n\nwanted to get into the house, they could have removed the barricade on the front door\n\nby pushing in the plexiglass.\n\nN.      Detective Clemons\n\n        Detective Clemons of the Victoria Police Department interviewed Garcia who did\n\nnot tell her that he provided the gun for Mejia to use. On cross-examination by the\n\nState, Detective Clemons stated that Garcia appeared fearful, but she believed that he\n\nwas being truthful. Detective Clemons testified that Garcia told her that as a member of\n\nthe Texas Syndicate, Mejia was capable of killing him.\n\n        Detective Clemons reviewed the phone records that had been subpoenaed for\n\nthe trial.      According to Detective Clemons, those phone records corroborated the\n\nwitnesses’ claims that Mejia had called them to intimidate them. Detective Clemons\n\n\n        11\n           The phone records showed that on October 30, 2007, there was a call from Mejia’s phone to\nJustin’s phone at 6:35 a.m. There was another call from Mejia’s phone to Justin’s phone at 6:53 a.m. on\nthat same day. Justin did not recall these phone calls. Finally, the phone records reflect that there was\nanother call from Mejia’s phone to Justin’s phone at 7:32 a.m.\n        12\n             Justin lived with Janet at her residence.\n\n\n                                                         17\n\ftestified that the phone records she reviewed also corroborated Garcia’s claims that he\n\ndrove Mejia to the crime scene and picked him up after Quintanilla was killed.\n\n      Detective Clemons agreed that Mejia was found in Sinton, Texas and knew that\n\nhe was “wanted in this jurisdiction.” The State asked Detective Clemons if she believed\n\nMejia was fleeing, and she replied, “Yes.” Detective Clemons also agreed that her\n\ninvestigation focused on Mejia based on the following: his fingerprints were found at the\n\ncrime scene; he threatened witnesses; Garcia gave him a ride to the crime scene; and\n\nthe bullet recovered from the victim matched the gun recovered by the dive team.\n\nDetective Clemons suspected that Mejia is a member of the Texas Syndicate.\n\nM.    Mejia\n\n      Mejia denied being a member of the Texas Syndicate. He denied threatening\n\nand killing Quintanilla, threatening Justin, and asking Garcia for a gun. Mejia denied\n\nthat his tattoos were related to the Texas Syndicate and explained that all his tattoos\n\n“came out of a ‘Flash’ magazine.”\n\n                          II.    SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n      By his first issue, Mejia contends that the evidence is legally and factually\n\ninsufficient to support the judgment. Mejia argues that there is no evidence he was in a\n\ngang and there is no non-accomplice evidence linking him to the crime.\n\nA.    Standard of Review and Applicable Law\n\n      The court of criminal appeals has held that there is “no meaningful distinction\n\nbetween the Jackson v. Virginia legal sufficiency standard and the Clewis factual-\n\nsufficiency standard” and that the Jackson standard “is the only standard that a\n\nreviewing court should apply in determining whether the evidence is sufficient to support\n\n\n\n                                           18\n\feach element of a criminal offense that the State is required to prove beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.” Brooks v.

Discussion\n\n       Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdict, we find that\n\nthe evidence showed the following: (1) Mejia’s “home boys,” meaning other members\n\nof the Texas Syndicate, were going to retaliate against Justin and Quintanilla for\n\nstealing his wallet; (2) Mejia is a member of the Texas Syndicate; and (3) the Texas\n\nSyndicate has three or more persons having several common identifying signs and\n\nsymbols and the organization has identifiable leadership who regularly associate in the\n\ncommission of criminal activities. See id.\n\n       We conclude that a reasonable fact-finder could have found that Mejia was a\n\nmember of a gang. See Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319; Brooks, 323 S.W.3d at 898–99.\n\nThus, the evidence is sufficient in that respect.\n\n       Next, Mejia argues there was no non-accomplice evidence linking him to the\n\ncrime. We disagree.\n\n\n\n                                             20\n\f      A person cannot be convicted based upon the testimony of an accomplice unless\n\nthat testimony is “corroborated by other evidence tending to connect the defendant with\n\nthe offense committed. TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 38.14 (West 2005). It is not\n\nnecessary for the corroborating evidence to be sufficient in itself to establish guilt\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. Gill v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2433114\"><a href=\"/opinion/2433114/gill-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 48 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994)\n\n(en banc). The non-accomplice evidence does not have to link the accused directly to\n\nthe commission of the offense. Id. However, there must be some non-accomplice\n\nevidence that tends to connect the accused to the commission of the offense. Id. Both\n\ndirect and circumstantial evidence may furnish the necessary corroboration. Reed v.\n\nState, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1529745\"><a href=\"/opinion/1529745/reed-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">744</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 126 (Tex.

Mistie testified that in order to get into the home,\n\none could push the plexiglass in and remove the wooden barrier. Justin and Mistie\n\nstated that the plexiglass had not been pushed in when they left the home the morning\n\nQuintanilla was killed. Therefore, the palm print is non-accomplice evidence tending to\n\nconnect Mejia to the commission of Quintanilla’s murder. In addition, Justin, Mistie, and\n\nJanet testified that Mejia threatened to harm Quintanilla because Mejia claimed that\n\nQuintanilla stole his money. See Bush v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2367823\"><a href=\"/opinion/2367823/bush-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">628</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">441</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 444 (Tex.

See Reed, 744 S.W.2d at 127\n\n(providing that evidence that the accused was at or near the scene of the crime at or\n\nabout the time of its commission, coupled with other suspicious circumstances, may\n\ntend to connect the accused to the crime so as to furnish sufficient corroboration to\n\nsupport a conviction).

We conclude that the above non-\n\naccomplice evidence was sufficient to connect Mejia to the commission of Quintanilla’s\n\nmurder. To the extent that Mejia complains that Garcia’s testimony was contradictory,\n\nhowever, we conclude that it was within the exclusive province of the jury to reconcile\n\nthose conflicts in the evidence See Wesbrook, 29 S.W.3d at 111. We overrule Mejia’s\n\nfirst issue.\n\n                 III.   INCONSISTENCIES IN THE WITNESSES TESTIMONY\n\n       By a sub-issue, Mejia argues that the witnesses committed perjury. However,\n\nMejia merely points to inconsistencies in the witnesses’ testimonies. These conflicts in\n\nthe evidence were within the exclusive province of the jury to reconcile.            Id.\n\nAccordingly, we overrule Mejia’s sub-issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\f                                 III.    PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT\n\n        By his second issue, Mejia asserts that the State engaged in prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct by:           “(a) soliciting testimony the prosecutor knew to be false[13]; (b)\n\nsubmitting false information to the trial court to secure a favorable ruling[14];\n\n(c) withholding evidence favorable to the defense; (d) continuously disregarding ruling\n\n[sic] against soliciting improper testimony; and (e) making improper comments on\n\nclosing.”\n\n        In this multifarious issue, Mejia does not present a clear argument supporting his\n\nbald assertions that the State engaged in prosecutorial misconduct. See TEX. R. APP. P.\n\n38.1(i); Stults v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1991932\"><a href=\"/opinion/1991932/stults-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">198</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 208 (Tex.

As such, we may refuse to review Mejia’s multifarious issue or we may elect to\n\nconsider the issues if we are able to determine, with reasonable certainty, the alleged\n\nerror about which the complaint is made. Stults, 23 S.W.3d at 205; Shull v. United\n\nParcel Serv., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2278773\"><a href=\"/opinion/2278773/shull-v-united-parcel-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 51 (Tex.

Those issues we do not address are\n\ninadequately briefed. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i).\n\n        Mejia complains that the State failed to disclose the latent palm print found on the\n\nplexiglass before it used it at his trial, in violation of Brady v. Maryland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 87\n\n(1963). Brady concerns material which is exculpatory. See id. However, the palm print\n\n\n        13\n          Mejia does not cite where in the record the State allegedly solicited false testimony. See TEX.\nR. APP. P. 38.1(i). Moreover, in his brief Mejia, without any evidentiary support, accuses all of the\nwitnesses and the prosecutor of lying at his trial. Accordingly, we conclude that this assertion is not\nadequately briefed. See id.\n        14\n             We cannot discern Mejia’s argument concerning this claim. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i).\n\n\n                                                     23\n\fin this case actually links Mejia to the commission of the murder. Therefore, Brady is\n\nnot applicable in this case. Nonetheless, as Mejia acknowledges, his trial counsel did\n\nnot object at trial on the basis of Brady. Therefore, this argument is not preserved. See\n\nKeeter v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1369397\"><a href=\"/opinion/1369397/keeter-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">756</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 761 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005) (establishing that by not\n\nraising a separate claim related to Brady, “the appellant did not preserve for appellate\n\nreview his complaint that the trial court erred in failing to grant his motion for new trial on\n\nthe basis of a Brady violation”).\n\n       Mejia does not cite any location in the record where the prosecutor made any\n\nimproper comments during closing arguments. Furthermore, the trial court sustained\n\nthe only objection made by Mejia’s trial counsel to the State’s closing argument.\n\nTherefore, to the extent that Mejia complains of any other alleged improper comments\n\nmade by the State, we conclude that those complaints have not been preserved\n\nbecause he did not object to any other comments made by the State. See Threadgill v.\n\nState, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2175651\"><a href=\"/opinion/2175651/threadgill-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">654</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 670 (Tex.

App.—Corpus Christi July 15, 2010, pet. ref’d)\n\n(mem. op., not designated for publication) (“[F]ailure to object to jury argument forfeits\n\nthe right to raise the issue on appeal.”).\n\n       Accordingly, we overrule Mejia’s second issue.\n\n                IV.    DENIAL OF MEJIA’S MOTION TO SUBSTITUTE COUNSEL\n\n       By his third issue, Mejia complains that the trial court abused its discretion by not\n\nallowing him to substitute his trial counsel. Without citation to the record, Mejia makes\n\nthe bald assertion that the trial court did not read his letter motion requesting a\n\n\n\n                                              24\n\fsubstitution of counsel. Mejia then states that the trial court “went so far as to order”\n\nMejia’s “silence” during a “pretrial hearing.” Mejia does not cite to the record of this\n\npretrial hearing but claims he was denied access to the courts. We find that Mejia’s\n\nclaim that he was denied access to the courts is without merit. Moreover, we have\n\nreviewed transcripts of pretrial hearings held on May 14, 2008, May 28, 2008, August\n\n19, 2008, September 19, 2008, December 17, 2008, January 21, 2009, March 26, 2009,\n\nApril 15, 2009, April 17, 2009, April 20, 2009, April 20, 2009, and June 10, 2009. The\n\ntrial court did not order silence from Mejia at any of these hearings.\n\n       At the April 20, 2009 hearing, Mejia stated that he objected to the “way [his] case\n\nha[d] been handled” because he had not “received hardly any statements or police\n\nreports” and did not “know anything about the case.” The trial court explained that\n\n“[u]nder the open file discovery . . . the attorneys are able to get information they would\n\nnot otherwise be able to get on discovery, but they’re not able to give [the defendant]\n\ncopies of those documents . . . .” Mejia stated that he understood the open discovery\n\npolicy and did not want copies but wanted twenty minutes of the attorney’s time. Mejia’s\n\nlead trial counsel, Luis Martinez, was apparently ill and was not present at this hearing.\n\nThe trial court stated that it would determine whether second trial counsel, Alex Luna,\n\nwould take over for Martinez at the next hearing.\n\n       At the next hearing held on April 24, 2009, the trial court stated it would be\n\ndeciding whether Luna would be taking over for Martinez. Luna told the trial court that\n\nMejia was informing him that it was possible that “an attorney out of Corpus [would] be\n\nrepresenting him, also.” The trial court then reset the trial for June 10, 2009. Mejia then\n\nstated, “That will give me time to talk to the attorney.” Mejia then complained that the\n\n\n\n                                            25\n\fankle restraints he was required to wear while in jail were causing sores. The trial court\n\nthen asked if he preferred to set a pre-trial hearing instead. Luna stated he would. So,\n\nthe trial court stated, “All right.          Then, June 10, at 9:00 a.m., for jury\n\nannouncements. . . . Right now Mr. Martinez is still in the case. If he’s able to assist\n\nfine, but, if it’s determined that you need someone else to assist you, you know, for the\n\ntrial, then I will appoint another attorney to assist you.”\n\n       Mejia does not cite to any point in the record wherein the trial court denied his\n\nrequest to substitute counsel. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i). In fact, it appears from the\n\nrecord that the trial court was willing to work with Mejia concerning appointment of new\n\ntrial counsel.   We are not required to review this voluminous record in order to\n\ndetermine whether the trial court abused its discretion. See Russeau v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1652450\"><a href=\"/opinion/1652450/russeau-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">291</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">426</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 437 (Tex.

Thus, we need not investigate Mejia’s claim further.\n\nAccordingly, we overrule his third issue.\n\n                    V.     ADMISSION OF PICTURES OF MEJIA’S TATTOOS\n\n       By his fourth issues, Mejia complains that the trial court improperly admitted\n\npictures of his tattoos.\n\n       We review a trial court’s decision to admit or exclude evidence under an abuse of\n\ndiscretion standard.

See TEX. R. EVID. 402, 403. However, at trial, Mejia’s trial\n\ncounsel did not object to the pictures on the basis of rules 402 and 403.

Mejia has not provided a clear and concise argument for\n\nhis sub-issue. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i). Accordingly, we overrule it. See id.\n\n                       VI.       INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL\n\n       By his fifth issue, Mejia contends that his trial counsel rendered ineffective\n\nassistance for a variety of reasons. See Strickland v.

Again, Mejia has provided a multifarious issue. As such, we may refuse to\n\n\n\n                                             27\n\freview Mejia’s multifarious issue or we may elect to consider the issues if we are able to\n\ndetermine, with reasonable certainty, the alleged error about which the complaint is\n\nmade. Stults, 23 S.W.3d at 205; Shull, 4 S.W.3d at 51. We will only address the\n\nalleged errors that we are able to determine with reasonable certainty. See Stults, 23\n\nS.W.3d at 205; Shull, 4 S.W.3d at 51.            Those issues we do not address are\n\ninadequately briefed. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i).\n\n       First, Mejia contends that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by\n\nfailing to object to Reyes’s entire testimony.    Mejia neither states under what rules\n\nReyes’s entire testimony was inadmissible nor establishes that there is a reasonable\n\nprobability that but for Reyes’s testimony he would not have been convicted.          See\n\nJackson v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2384922\"><a href=\"/opinion/2384922/jackson-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">877</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">768</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 771 (Tex. Crim App. 1994) (explaining that to\n\nestablish an ineffective assistance claim, the appellant must affirmatively show that trial\n\ncounsel’s performance was deficient and that the deficiency was prejudicial).\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that trial counsel should have objected to his entire\n\ntestimony.\n\n       Mejia next argues that trial counsel was ineffective for not objecting to the\n\nprosecutor’s closing comments. Mejia does not specify which comments he is referring\n\nto; however, he refers to a section in his brief, section “‘2(e).’” In that section, Mejia\n\nclaimed that the State improperly read the law to the jury. However, Mejia did not cite to\n\nthe record or provide a clear and concise argument to support his contention. See TEX.\n\nR. APP. P. 38.1(i). Therefore, we are unable to address this issue. See id.\n\n       Next, Mejia complains that defense counsel was ineffective by failing to\n\ninvestigate the “true origins” of his tattoos. He states, “defense counsel was unable to\n\n\n\n                                            28\n\frebut the State’s claims that such were of gang origin leaving Appellant’s contention of\n\nsuch unsubstantiated and the defense inadvanced against that which was pivotal to the\n\nState’s case in proving the engaging factor of the charge of the indictment.” This is the\n\nextent of Mejia’s argument.     However, defense counsel did ask Mejia whether his\n\ntattoos were gang related, and Mejia testified that his tattoos were not gang related.\n\nMejia testified that he copied his tattoos from a tattoo magazine. Therefore, defense\n\ncounsel did attempt to rebut the State’s claim that Mejia’s tattoos were gang related.\n\n      We overrule Mejia’s fifth issue.\n\n                                   VII.
