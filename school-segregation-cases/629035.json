MILLER, individually,\n                                               No. 68594-5-1\n                     Respondent/\n                     Cross-Appellant,          DIVISION ONE\n\n\n\n\nPATRICK J. KENNY, individually,\n\n                     Defendant,\n                                               PUBLISHED OPINION\n             and\n                                               FILED: April 28, 2014\nSAFECO INSURANCE COMPANY,\n\n                     Appellant/\n                     Cross-Respondent.\n\n\n\n      Becker, J. — In an insurance bad faith case, the amount of a reasonable\n\ncovenant judgment sets a floor, not a ceiling, on the damages a jury may award.\n\nWe affirm a jury verdict awarding $13 million in damages to the assignee of the\n\nbad faith causes of action where the total net amount of the covenant judgment\n\nwas $4.15 million.\n\n      This appeal arose out of an automobile accident on August 23, 2000.\n\nPatrick Kenny, the driver at fault, was driving a 1994 Volkswagen Passat in\n\nAlberta, Canada, when he rear-ended a cement truck. The accident injured his\n\nthree passengers: Ryan Miller, Ashley Bethards, and Cassandra Peterson. The\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/2\n\n\n\n\nfour teenagers were close friends who had attended Anacortes High School and\n\nwere taking a road trip before starting college at the University of Washington.\n\n       The Passat belonged to Cassandra Peterson. Kenny had permission to\n\ndrive it and was covered for liability under the car insurance policy issued to\n\nPeterson's parents by appellant Safeco Insurance Company. Within days of the\n\naccident, Safeco had information that the injuries were severe. Safeco defended\n\nKenny without a reservation of rights.\n\n       Miller, who had experienced a head injury and was unable to start college\n\nas planned, eventually retained counsel. As a preliminary to initiating settlement\n\ndiscussions, Miller contacted Safeco in October 2001 to inquire about the policy\n\nlimits. Safeco did not divulge the policy limits, claiming that the Petersons had\n\nnot given their permission—a point that would later be disputed at trial. Miller\n\nforced the issue by filing suit against Kenny on December 20, 2001. This made\n\nthe policy limits discoverable.\n\n       In January 2002, Safeco disclosed that the Petersons had liability policy\n\nlimits of $500,000 per person and per accident, and umbrella policy limits of $1\n\nmillion. The policy also had underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage that was\n\npotentially available to the injured passengers. Safeco represented that the limits\n\nof the UIM coverage were only $100,000 due to an alleged prior rejection by\n\nPeterson's mother of UIM limits of $500,000.\n\n       On July 1, 2002, Miller sent Safeco a letter demanding a policy limits\n\nsettlement. The letter called attention to the \"substantial\" risk of an excess\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/3\n\n\n\n\njudgment.1 Peterson had already sent Safeco a settlement demand for\n\n$350,000. Shortly thereafter, Safeco received a demand of $1.25 million from\n\nBethards, who had suffered a head injury.\n\n           On August 29, 2002, Kenny's appointed defense counsel Vickie Norris\n\nwrote to the Safeco adjuster, pointing out that the cumulative settlement\n\ndemands exceeded the policy limits. On behalf of Kenny, Norris demanded that\n\nSafeco tender the policy limits into the registry of the court in exchange for a\n\nrelease and hold harmless from the claimants.2\n\n           Safeco's adjuster responded by letter saying that with the information\n\nreceived so far, \"we do not see the combined value of the injuries in excess of\n\nthe policy limits.\"3 The adjuster tendered to Norris only the $500,000 in liability\n\nlimits.\n\n\n           On November 8, 2002, Norris wrote to the three claimants on behalf of\n\nKenny, tendering to them the $500,000 she had received from Safeco pending\n\nagreement by the claimants on how to divide it. She offered that Kenny would\n\nassign \"any bad faith claims that he may have against Safeco\" in exchange for\n\nthe claimants' agreement not to execute or enforce above all available policy\n\nlimits.4\n\n           The trial date for Miller's suit against Kenny was set for June 2003. In\n\nMarch 2003, Safeco authorized Norris to tender the umbrella policy limits of $1\n\n\n\n           1 Exhibit 125.\n           2 Exhibit 143; Clerk's Papers at 675.\n           3 Clerk's Papers at 676.\n           4 Exhibit 155.\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/4\n\n\n\n\nmillion, to be added to the $500,000 in liability limits, in exchange for a release of\n\nall claims against their insureds.5 This offer came too late. Kenny was facing the\n\nlikelihood of an excess judgment at the upcoming trial. Kenny acted upon advice\n\nfrom Norris and retained attorney Jan Peterson to attempt to negotiate a global\n\nsettlement with the three passengers.\n\n       The settlement agreement was achieved in May 2003.6 Kenny had $1.8\n\nmillion of insurance proceeds available ($300,000 from his parents' State Farm\n\npolicy in addition to the $1.5 million from the Petersons' Safeco policy). Kenny\n\nagreed to pay the $1.8 million to Miller, Bethards, and Peterson, through the\n\nmechanism of a partial judgment if necessary, and to assign to Miller his rights to\n\nsue Safeco for bad faith and related claims or actions. In return, the three\n\nclaimants granted Kenny a covenant not to execute on or enforce any excess\n\njudgment. It was agreed that the full amount of damages for the covenant\n\njudgment would be determined by stipulation or arbitration, contingent upon a\n\nreasonableness finding by the court.\n\n       Safeco intervened after being notified of the settlement agreement. A\n\nreasonableness hearing became unnecessary when Safeco, in May 2005,\n\nstipulated to an order finding that $4.15 million was the reasonable total net\n\namount for the stipulated covenant judgments.7 This was the amount of\n\ndamages that remained unpaid after the three passengers received the $1.8\n\nmillion in insurance proceeds. All parties to the stipulated order agreed to treat\n\n\n       5 Clerk's Papers at 5896.\n       6 Exhibit 1; Clerk's Papers at 5828-5838.\n       7 Exhibit 15.\n                                               4\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/5\n\n\n\n\nthe remaining $4.15 million as ifjudgment in that amount had been entered\n\nagainst Kenny. The order allocated the damages as follows:\n\n       Claimant               Gross Amount                  Net Amount\n       Miller                 $3,450,000                    $2,575,000\n       Bethards               $2,100,000                    $1,425,000\n       Peterson               $ 400,000                     $ 150,000™\n\n       Safeco's stipulation reserved its defenses in future litigation. Thus, the\n\nstage was set for bad faith litigation. Miller dropped his claims against Kenny.\n\nAs Kenny's assignee, he amended his complaint to allege bad faith against\n\nSafeco, as well as negligence, consumer protection violations, breach of\n\ncontract, and other theories. Miller alleged that Safeco had damaged Kenny by\n\nrefusing to disclose the liability policy limits, thereby forcing the initiation of\n\nMiller's lawsuit against Kenny, and by its subsequent actions in handling the\n\ncase. Miller also sued as the assignee of Cassandra Peterson's claim that\n\nSafeco committed bad faith when it represented that her parents' policy provided\n\nonly $100,000 in UIM coverage for the Passat instead of $500,000.\n\n       Years of litigation followed. Miller's major theme was that Safeco could have\n\nprotected Kenny from exposure to an excess judgment by promoting a policy limits\n\nsettlement much earlier. Safeco's principal defense was that it never had a genuine\n\nopportunity to settle the case because there were three claimants, and Miller\n\nunreasonably and intransigently demanded all the policy limits for himself. This dispute\n\nabout who was to blame for the lack of settlement continued to the last witness on the\n\nlast day of trial, a Safeco adjuster whose deposition was presented in Miller's rebuttal\n\n\n        Exhibit 15; Clerk's Papers at 5898.\n\n                                                5\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/6\n\n\n\n\ncase. The adjuster admitted that Safeco's failure to offer $1.5 million in August 2002\n\nwas not due to the position taken by the lawyers, but rather was due to Safeco's\n\nassessment at the time that the three claims did not approach $1.5 million in value.\n\n      Safeco erected a secondary line of defense upon the terms of the settlement\n\nagreement. Safeco argued that Kenny had failed to make a valid assignment of his\n\nright to sue Safeco for bad faith. In the 2003 agreement with his passengers, Kenny\n\nassigned to Miller \"all rights, privileges, claims and causes of action that he may have\"\n\nagainst Safeco. At the same time, Kenny reserved to himself certain \"claims for\n\ndamages.\"\n\n       c.      Reservation: Defendant Kenny hereby reserves to himself\n               claims for damages for his personal emotional distress,\n               personal attorneys' fees, personal damages to his credit or\n               reputation and other non-economic damages which arise\n               from the assigned causes of action.'9]\n\nSafeco argued that because of Kenny's reservation of his \"claims\" for personal\n\ndamages, Miller as Kenny's assignee could not prove harm, an essential element\n\nin a bad faith case. On December 22, 2008, Safeco moved for dismissal on\n\nsummary judgment on this basis.\n\n       The trial court denied the motion for summary judgment. This court took\n\ndiscretionary review and decided that summary judgment was properly denied\n\nbecause what Miller and Kenny intended by the assignment and reservation\n\nprovisions of the agreement depended on the resolution of disputed extrinsic\n\nevidence. Miller v. Kenny, noted at 158 Wn. App. 1049, 2010 WL 4923873, at\n\n*7.\n\n\n       9 Exhibit 1.\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/7\n\n\n\n\n       When the case returned to superior court, Safeco moved to bifurcate the\n\ntrial. The trial court granted the motion. The jury would proceed to decide\n\nSafeco's liability for bad faith only ifthe jury determined in the first phase that the\n\nMay 2003 settlement agreement was intended to permit Miller to recover Kenny's\n\ndamages caused by Safeco's alleged bad faith.\n\n       The first phase of trial began November 30, 2011. It was concerned solely\n\nwith contract interpretation. Safeco's factual position was that the agreement\n\nreserved to Kenny the right to pursue damages. Safeco's legal theory was that if\n\nthe jury found Kenny retained that right for himself, then the assignment was\n\ninvalid because it was incomplete. Miller's position was that the agreement\n\nretained for Kenny only an interest in any damages Miller recovered and that\n\nMiller alone had the right to pursue Kenny's damages in a lawsuit against\n\nSafeco.\n\n       The question posed to the jury was \"Who gets to pursue Kenny's claims\n\nfor personal emotional distress, attorneys' fees, personal damage to credit and\n\nreputation, and other non-economic damage?\" The verdict form gave the jury\n\nthree possible ways to answer the question: Kenny, Miller, or both. The jury\n\nchecked \"Miller\" in their verdict on December 2, 2011.10 This verdict cleared the\n\nway for the second phase of the trial, Safeco's alleged liability for dealing with\n\nKenny in bad faith.\n\n       The second phase of the trial began on December 5, 2011, before the\n\n\n\n\n       10 Clerk's Papers at 5702 (verdict); Report of Proceedings (Dec. 2, 2011) at 110-11.\n                                               7\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/8\n\n\n\n\nsame jury. The trial court gave the jury 31 instructions.11 Instruction 8 explained\n\nthe significance of the verdict in the first phase of trial:\n\n               As a consequence of the first trial, Plaintiff Ryan Miller is the\n       assignee of the rights, claims and causes of action of Patrick Kenny\n       and Cassandra Peterson against Safeco.\n               An assignee steps into the shoes of the assignor and has all\n       of the rights of the assignors. The assignee's cause of action is\n       direct, not derivative. The assignee may sue in his or her own\n       name, and may speak in the place of the assignors.\n               As a result, Ryan Miller is the real party in interest and has\n       the exclusive right to recover all damages related to the assigned\n       causes of action. Who he has agreed to share those damages\n       with, and in what amounts, is not material to his right to recovery.1121\n\nThe jury was instructed on bad faith, negligence, breach of contract, and\n\nconsumer protection. Instruction 25 set forth standards pertinent to the central\n\nclaim of bad faith:\n\n               The duty of good faith requires an insurer to:\n               (1) Perform a reasonable investigation and evaluation of a\n       claim against its insured;\n               (2) If its investigation discloses a reasonable likelihood that\n       its insured may be liable, make a good faith effort to settle the\n       claim. This includes an obligation at least to conduct good faith\n       settlement negotiations sufficient to ascertain the most favorable\n       terms available and make an informed evaluation of the settlement\n       demand;\n               (3) Evaluate settlement offers as though it bore the entire\n       risk, including the risk of any judgment in excess of the policy limits;\n               (4) Timely communicate its investigations and evaluations,\n       and any settlement offers, to its insured; and\n               (5) If the settlement demand exceeds the insurer's policy\n       limits, communicate the offer to its insured, ascertain whether the\n       insured is willing to make the necessary contribution to the\n       settlement amount, and exercise good faith in deciding whether to\n       pay its own limits.\n              An insurer who fails to fulfill any of these duties falls to act in\n       good faith.\n\n\n       11 Clerk's Papers at 5373-5409.\n       12 Clerk's Papers at 5383.\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/9\n\n\n\n\n        On December 16, the jury returned a plaintiff's verdict of $13 million.13 Of\n\nthis award, $11.9 million was on the assignment from Kenny and $1.1 million was\n\non the assignment from Peterson.14\n\n        The judgments ultimately entered by the court against Safeco added\n\nprejudgment interest of more than $7 million, postjudgment interest at 12\n\npercent, $1.7 million in attorney fees and costs, and treble damages under the\n\nConsumer Protection Act, chapter 19.86 RCW. The total was $21,837,286.73.\n\n                 INTERPRETATION OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT\n\n        In the first phase of the trial, the jury's verdict determined that the 2003\n\nsettlement agreement authorized Miller, and only Miller, to carry on the litigation against\n\nSafeco for Kenny's damages personal to himself. Safeco contends the trial court\n\ncommitted reversible error by allowing the jury to hear evidence of the subjective intent\n\nof the parties to the agreement.\n\n        Safeco's argument implicates the context rule of contract interpretation. Berg v.\n\nHudesman. 115 Wn.2d 657, 801 P.2d 222 (1990); Hollis v. Garwall, Inc., 137 Wn.2d\n\n683, 695, 974 P.2d 836 (1999). To determine the intention of the parties to a contract,\n\nthe finder of fact may consider extrinsic evidence regarding the situation of the parties\n\nand the circumstances under which the contract was executed. Berg, 115 Wn.2d at\n\n\n\n        13 Clerk's Papers at 5410-5413.\n        14 The components were $9.65 million for Kenny's claim for bad faith; $750,000\nfor each of Kenny's assigned consumer protection, negligence, and contract claims\n($9.65M + ($750,000 x 3 = $2.25 million) = $11.9 million); $350,000 for Cassandra\nPeterson's assigned bad faith claim; and $250,000 for each of her assigned consumer\nprotection, negligence, and contract claims ($350,000 + ($250,000 x 3 = $750,000) =\n$1.1 million).\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/10\n\n\n\n\n669. Admissible extrinsic evidence does not include \"evidence of a party's unilateral or\n\nsubjective intent as to the meaning of a contract word or term.\" Hollis, 137 Wn.2d at\n\n695; Ross v. Bennett, 148 Wn. App. 40, 46, 203 P.3d 383 (2008), review denied. 166\n\nWn.2d 1012 (2009). The subjective intent of a party is generally irrelevant to the\n\ninterpretation of a contract if the intent of the instrument can be determined from the\n\nactual words used. Hearst Commc'ns, Inc. v. Seattle Times Co.. 154 Wn.2d 493, 504,\n\n115 P.3d 262 (2005).\n\n       The phase one trial lasted two days. It began with opening statements on the\n\nafternoon of November 30, 2011. Most of the evidence came in through Miller's first\n\nwitness, attorney Jan Peterson, who represented Kenny in the negotiations that\n\nproduced the settlement agreement. Peterson was the drafter of the agreement.\n\n       On direct examination, Peterson described Kenny's situation in the spring of\n\n2003 as the trial of Miller's personal injury suit drew near. Peterson testified that\n\nbecause of Safeco's failure to seek out an early settlement, Kenny faced the likelihood\n\nof an excess judgment at the upcoming trial. He also testified that one of Safeco's\n\nattorneys had threatened to withdraw Kenny's coverage if Kenny assigned his bad faith\n\nclaims to Miller.\n\n       Peterson was asked what he intended in drafting certain parts of the settlement\n\nagreement, including the assignment and reservation provisions. Safeco objected that\n\n\"personal intentions are irrelevant.\" The trial court ruled that \"Mr. Peterson can testify\n\nas to what he did and why he did it.\" Peterson answered that the purpose of the\n\nagreement was to protect Kenny from excess judgments and to preserve to Kenny \"the\n\noptions of recovering damages, personal to him.\" He testified without objection that the\n                                             10\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/11\n\n\n\n\nstructure of the agreement reflected the intent that Miller—not Kenny—would go forward\n\nwith the assigned causes of action against Safeco.\n\n       Peterson was asked what he \"meant for this document to speak\" when he drafted\n\nthe assignment and reservation provisions. This time, Safeco objected that Peterson's\n\npersonal intentions were irrelevant unless they were communicated to Safeco. The trial\n\ncourt properly overruled the objection. As the testimony showed, Safeco was not a\n\nparty to the agreement and had not been involved in negotiating it. The admissibility of\n\na drafter's testimony does not depend upon communication with an entity not a party to\n\nthe negotiations. Peterson answered that the assignment meant Miller had the right to\n\nbring the bad faith action, and Kenny did not have an obligation to bring a separate bad\n\nfaith action.\n\n       On cross-examination, Safeco tried to elicit Peterson's agreement that the\n\nreservation clause meant Kenny had reserved the right to pursue his causes of action\n\nagainst Safeco. Peterson's answers distinguished between the causes of action, which\n\nhe said Kenny had assigned, and the claims for damages, which he said Kenny had\n\nreserved. This distinction went to the ultimate issue the jury was being asked to decide.\n\nOn redirect, Peterson repeated it without objection.\n\n       At the end of redirect, Peterson was asked to state his purpose in drafting the\n\nagreement. Was his purpose to allow Miller and Kenny to pursue the bad faith action\n\ntogether and share the recovery, or was it to allow each of them to pursue the bad faith\n\nclaim independently at double the expense? Safeco objected: \"The witness can't\n\ntestify to his subjective purpose or intent. The document speaks for itself.\" The court\n\nruled that Peterson \"may testify as to what his intent was when he drafted the\n                                            11\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/12\n\n\n\n\ndocument.\" Peterson answered that having Miller and Kenny each pursuing a bad faith\n\naction independently was \"not what we wanted for Mr. Kenny.\"\n\n       After Peterson, Miller and Kenny testified briefly. The trial court sustained\n\nSafeco's objection when Kenny was asked about his intent. However, over objection,\n\nthe court permitted Kenny to answer a question about \"what [he] expected to occur with\n\nthe settlement agreement.\" Kenny answered, \"My expectation was that Iwas assigning\n\na cause of action to Ryan Miller. After assigning that cause of action, if it was found that\n\nSafeco had acted in bad faith towards me, I would still be entitled to claim a portion of\n\nthose damages.\" A similar question was asked soon after, and again the court\n\noverruled Safeco's objection:\n\n             Q. Has there ever been any question in your mind as to the fact\n      that, with the assignment that you provided, that Ryan Miller was entitled\n      to have the right to sue Safeco in your behalf and recover all the damages\n      and share those with you ifthere is a recovery?\n             [Kenny:] No doubt.\n                [Safeco]: Objection.\n                 THE COURT: Overruled.\n\n      The closing arguments reiterated the themes that emerged from Peterson's\n\ntestimony. Miller emphasized the assignment language. He argued that the agreement\n\nmade sense only if it was he, not Kenny, who had the right to pursue for both of them\n\nthe personal damages that arose from the assigned causes of action. Safeco\n\nemphasized the reservation clause: Did Kenny assign everything or did he reserve\n\ncertain damages unto himself? \"If he reserved unto himself certain damages, it cannot\n\nbe proved that Patrick Kenny assigned all.\"\n\n      The jury's verdict sided with Miller. The jury determined that Miller, and only\n\nMiller, was entitled to pursue Kenny's claims for personal damage.\n                                            12\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/13\n\n\n\n\n       On appeal, Safeco contends that Peterson and Kenny both provided evidence of\n\nsubjective intent that should have been excluded under Hollis.\n\n       The line between permissible evidence of context and impermissible evidence of\n\nsubjective intent is not bright. Under Hollis, evidence of a party's unilateral or subjective\n\nintent as to the meaning of a contract word or term is inadmissible. Hollis, 137 Wn.2d at\n\n695. We have held that extrinsic evidence is admissible to show the intent of a drafter\n\nso long as it is not used to change the terms of an agreement. Saunders v. Meyers,\n\n175 Wn. App. 427, 440, 306 P.3d 978 (2013). In another case, we have applied the\n\nHollis prohibition to exclude evidence of the subjective intent of the drafter of a\n\nrestrictive covenant. Ross, 148 Wn. App. at 47-48.\n\n       Although Peterson drafted the agreement and was not himself a party, some of\n\nSafeco's objections to questions asked of Peterson arguably could have been sustained\n\nunder Ross. Yet Safeco allowed similar questions to go by without objection, and\n\nSafeco itself asked Peterson questions about what the agreement meant. We therefore\n\ndecline to go through each ruling the trial court made and decide which ones, if any,\n\nwere in error. \"Admission of testimony that is otherwise excludable is not prejudicial\n\nerror where similar testimony was admitted earlier without objection.\" Ashley v. Hall,\n\n138 Wn.2d 151,159, 978 P.2d 1055 (1999).\n\n      The trial court actively policed the questioning of the witnesses with the Hollis\n\nrule in mind (\"[l]f the contract says blue, a person can't say but what I meant was not\n\nblue, I meant red.\")15 Even if some of the testimony went beyond supplying context for\nthe agreement, the court did not permit the witnesses to read language into the\n\n      15 Report of Proceedings (Dec. 1, 2011) at 130.\n                                             13\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/14\n\n\n\n\nagreement that was not there. That is the essential concern of Hollis—to exclude\n\nextrinsic evidence that \"would show an intention independent of the instrument\" or\n\n\"would vary, contradict or modify the written word.\" Hollis, 137 Wn.2d at 695.\n\n       Miller and Safeco offered competing interpretations of the agreement based on\n\nthe ambiguity created by the assignment and reservation provisions. Their competing\n\ninterpretations were both rooted in the written words of the agreement. Both parties\n\nproperly focused on the key words of the agreement—\"assignment,\" \"reservation,\"\n\n\"claim,\" and \"cause of action.\" Miller did not ask the jury to interpret the agreement as\n\nincluding words not found in it. Cf. Seaborn Pile Driving Co., Inc. v. Glew. 132 Wn. App.\n\n261, 270-71, 131 P.3d 910 (2006) (\"although Seaborn may have intended the offer to\n\ninclude attorney fees, that intention was not expressed in the contract as written\"),\n\nreview denied. 158Wn.2d 1027(2007).\n\n       Safeco does contend that Kenny's testimony directly contradicted the written\n\nwords of the reservation provision, in violation of Hollis. This argument fails because it\n\nassumes the result. This court's previous decision on discretionary review determined\n\nthat the agreement had an ambiguity because Kenny assigned his causes of action and\n\nat the same time reserved claims for damages to himself. Thus, the reservation\n\nprovision did not have an unambiguous meaning that Kenny's testimony could\n\ncontradict. The point of the phase one trial was to find out what the reservation\n\nprovision meant.\n\n       To the extent that testimony about intention and purpose was improperly\n\nadmitted, we reject Safeco's argument that the error was prejudicial. An erroneous\n\nevidentiary decision is reversible error only if \"it is reasonable to conclude that the trial\n                                              14\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/15\n\n\n\n\noutcome would have been materially affected had the error not occurred.\" Lutz Tile,\n\nInc. v. Krech, 136 Wn. App. 899, 905, 151 P.3d 219 (2007), review denied. 162Wn.2d\n\n1009(2008).\n\n       Peterson was an important witness. His testimony was a tutorial on the\n\npressures faced by an insured defendant when he has caused damage exceeding his\n\npolicy limits and his insurer refuses to tender policy limits. Peterson's answers were\n\ntypically more circumspect than the sometimes leading questions posed to him on direct\n\nand cross. Virtually everything he said was clearly admissible and highly relevant\n\nextrinsic evidence about the circumstances leading up to the agreement, the context in\n\nwhich the parties signed it, and their subsequent acts and conduct.\n\n       The interpretation proposed by Safeco was strained: that despite the assignment\n\nlanguage, Kenny had reserved the right to bring his own bad faith suit against Safeco.\n\nThe difficulty with Safeco's position was noted by this court on discretionary review:\n\n\"Safeco's reading fails to harmonize the assignment and reservation provisions. It is\n\nneither logical nor reasonable that the parties would intend to assign 'all rights,\n\nprivileges, claims and causes of action,' including the bad faith claim, and then defeat\n\nthe assignment's purpose by retaining an essential element of the bad faith cause of\n\naction in the reservation provision.\" Miller, 2010 WL 4923873 at 6.\n\n       The reservation by Kenny of his \"claims for damages .. . which arise from the\n\nassigned causes of action\" was an unusual feature of the agreement, one we have not\n\nseen in similar cases. It is not surprising that Safeco challenged it. But it is also not\n\nsurprising that the jury gave the agreement a realistic interpretation that would serve the\n\ninterests of both Miller and Kenny given the situation they were in. Peterson educated\n                                             15\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/16\n\n\n\n\nthe jury about the legal and practical realities of the situation: assignment of a bad faith\n\nclaim permits a settling defendant like Kenny to escape from the burdens of litigation\n\nand liability while giving an injured plaintiff like Miller the opportunity to secure adequate\n\ncompensation not otherwise available from the settling defendant. Given the solidity of\n\nPeterson's testimony and the scarcity of countervailing evidence, we do not see a\n\nreasonable possibility that the outcome of the trial's first phase would have been\n\ndifferent ifthe specific excerpts challenged by Safeco had been excluded.\n\n       Safeco raises a related claim of instructional error in phase one. The trial court\n\ngave instruction 5, a pattern instruction on contract interpretation. See WPI 301.05.\n\nDrawn from Berg, the pattern instruction is appropriate for use \"when the jury must\n\ndecide the intended meaning of contract language.\" 6A Washington Practice:\n\nWashington Pattern Jury Instructions: Civil 301.05 note on use at 204 (6th ed.\n\n2012) (WPI). Instruction 5 told jurors to\n\n       determine the intent of the contracting parties by viewing the contract as a\n       whole, considering the subject matter and apparent purpose of the\n       contract, all the facts and circumstances leading up to and surrounding the\n       making of the contract, the subsequent acts and conduct of the parties to\n       the contract, and the reasonableness of the respective interpretations\n       offered by the parties.\n\n       Safeco assigns error to the trial court's refusal to give, in addition, an instruction\n\nbased on WPI 301.06. As modified and proposed by Safeco, it read as follows:\n\n\n\n\n                                              16\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/17\n\n\n\n\n              If you find that all of the provisions of an agreement between Ryan\n      Miller and Patrick Kenny are contained in the Settlement Agreement and\n      Assignment of Rights, Judgment and Covenant (\"the Settlement\n      Agreement\"), and that the Settlement Agreement was intended by all\n      parties as their final agreement on the subjects addressed in it, then you\n      may not consider evidence outside the written document to add to,\n      subtract from, vary, or contradict that written document unless you also\n      find that terms were included in the document as a result of fraud or\n       mutual mistake.\n              However, if you find that such written document was not intended to\n       be a complete expression of all of the terms agreed upon by those parties,\n       that is, that the document does not contain all of the terms of their\n       agreement, then you may also consider evidence of the circumstances\n       surrounding the making of the agreement to supply additional terms of the\n       agreement between the parties, but only if they are not inconsistent with\n       the provisions of the written document.\n\n       An appellate court reviews de novo alleged errors in a trial court's instructions to\n\nthe jury.

Barrett, 152 Wn.2d at 267.\n\n       WPI 301.06 is for use \"when there is a written contract and a factual issue exists\n\nas to whether the contract is integrated.\" WPI 301.06 note on use at 207. The trial\n\ncourt declined to give Safeco's proposed instruction because it required the jury to first\n\ndecide whether the settlement agreement was or was not integrated.16 Integration was\n\n\n\n\n       16 Report of Proceedings (Dec. 2, 2011) at 61.\n                                              17\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/18\n\n\n\n\nnot an issue; neither party contended that the settlement agreement was not integrated.\n\nThe court rightly determined the instruction would be confusing.\n\n       Safeco contends that the instruction, even if imperfect, would at least have told\n\njurors that extrinsic evidence cannot be used to contradict the terms of a written\n\nagreement. But as discussed above, extrinsic evidence was not admitted to contradict\n\nthe terms of the settlement agreement. Safeco has not shown that it was prejudiced by\n\nthe court's failure to give the proposed instruction. Instruction 5 adequately permitted\n\nSafeco to argue its theory that Miller's assignment to Kenny did not include Kenny's\n\nown damages and therefore only Kenny had the right to pursue them.\n\n             DAMAGES EXCEEDING THE COVENANT JUDGMENT\n\n       Miller moved for partial summary judgment to establish that the order\n\nstipulating $4.15 million as the reasonable net amount of the covenant\n\n\"judgment\" was not a ceiling on damages but merely a floor—\"the minimal\n\namount of harm if Safeco is liable.\"17 The trial court granted the motion, and the\n\nruling was carried out during phase two of the trial in the instruction on the\n\nmeasure of damages. The jury was instructed that if it found Safeco acted in bad\n\nfaith as to Kenny, it must include the $4.15 million set by the stipulated order and\n\nshould consider other damages:\n\n                If your verdict is for the plaintiff on Patrick Kenny's claim that\n       Safeco failed to act in good faith, then you must determine the\n       amount of money that will reasonably and fairly compensate the\n       plaintiff for such damages as you find were proximately caused by\n       Safeco's failure to act in good faith.\n\n\n\n       17 Clerk's Papers at 3468.\n                                               18\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/19\n\n\n\n\n               Ifyou find for the plaintiff on Patrick Kenny's claim for failure\n       to act in good faith your verdict must include the following\n       undisputed items:\n              The net amount of the Stipulated Order Re: Reasonableness\n       of Settlements for $4,150,000.\n              In addition, you should consider the following past and future\n       elements of damages:\n            1. Lost or diminished assets or property, including value of\n                 money;\n             2. Lost control of the case or settlement;\n             3. Reasonable value of expert or other costs or reasonable\n                attorney fees incurred for the private counsel retained by\n                Patrick Kenny;\n             4. Damage to credit or credit worthiness;\n             5. Effects on driving or business insurance or insurability;\n             6. Emotional distress or anxiety.\n             The burden of proving Patrick Kenny did not suffer damages\n       rests upon Safeco. It is for you to determine, based upon the\n       evidence, whether any particular element has been proved by a\n       preponderance of the evidence.\n\nInstruction 30. The elements of damage enumerated in items 1 through 6\n\nultimately accounted for $7.75 million of the damage award, on top of the\n\nobligatory $4.15 million.\n\n       Safeco contends the jury should not have been permitted to award\n\ndamages exceeding the net amount set by the stipulated order.\n\n       \"An action for bad faith handling of an insurance claim sounds in tort.\"\n\nSafeco Ins. Co. of Am. v. Butler. 118 Wn.2d 383, 389, 823 P.2d 499 (1992).\n\nHarm \"is an essential element of an action for bad faith.\" Butler, 118 Wn.2d at\n\n389. In previous cases, insurers have argued that when an insured obtains from\n\nthe injured party a covenant not to execute on a stipulated judgment, the insured\n\nhas suffered no harm and consequently has no bad faith claim to assign. See,\n\ne.g.. Butler. 118 Wn.2d at 396; Besel v. Viking Ins. Co. of Wise. 146Wn.2d730,\n                                              19\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/20\n\n\n\n\n736, 49 P.3d 887 (2002). The Supreme Court has steadfastly rejected this\n\nargument. Butler. 118 Wn.2d at 396-400. In the context of a third party's claim\n\nagainst an insured, once the insured meets the burden of establishing bad faith,\n\na rebuttable presumption of harm arises. Butler. 118 Wn.2d at 390. Safeco\n\nexpressly states that the issue of presumed harm \"is not before the Court here.\n\nRather, this case involves what damages are encompassed by a covenant\n\njudgment settlement.\"18\n\n       If an insurer acts in bad faith, an insured can recover from the insurer the\n\namount of a judgment rendered against the insured, even if the judgment\n\nexceeds contractual policy limits. Besel, 146 Wn.2d at 735; Mut. of Enumclaw\n\nIns. Co. v. Dan Paulson Constr.. Inc., 161 Wn.2d 903, 920, 169 P.3d 1 (2007).\n\nAs Besel recognizes, the \"judgment rule\" is the majority rule in the United States.\n\nBesel, 146Wn.2dat735.\n\n       What occurred in this case is what occurred in Butler and Besel—a\n\ncovenant not to execute coupled with an assignment and settlement agreement.\n\nThis arrangement did not release Kenny from liability; it was simply \"an\n\nagreement to seek recovery only from a specific asset—the proceeds of the\n\ninsurance policy and the rights owed by the insurer to the insured.\" Butler. 118\n\nWn.2d at 399, quoted in Besel. 146 Wn.2d at 737.\n\n       Safeco argues that Besel limits recovery to the amount of a reasonable\n\ncovenant judgment—which in this case was the $4.15 million established by the\n\n\n\n       18 Brief of Appellant at 64.\n\n                                            20\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/21\n\n\n\n\norder to which Safeco stipulated in May 2005. In Besel, the policy limits were\n\n$25,000. Like in this case, a passenger (Besel) who had been injured in a car\n\naccident settled with the insured driver by means of a stipulated covenant\n\njudgment (for $175,000) and then, as assignee of the driver's claims against the\n\ninsurer, sued the insurer (Viking) for failure to settle. The trial court limited\n\nBesel's potential recovery for the driver's bad faith damages to the contractual\n\npolicy limit of $25,000, which by that time Viking had already paid. Besel\n\nappealed. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that under Butler, harm was\n\npresumed and the insured's bad faith damages could exceed the policy limits.\n\nBesel v. Viking Ins. Co. of Wise, 105 Wn. App. 463, 480, 21 P.3d 293 (2001),\n\nreversed. 146 Wn.2d 730, 49 P.3d 887 (2002). The Court of Appeals, however,\n\ndisagreed with Besel's argument that satisfaction of his stipulated judgment for\n\n$175,000 was the appropriate remedy and instead remanded the case for the\n\nextent of his damages to be determined at trial. Besel, 146 Wn.2d at 482. The\n\nSupreme Court granted Besel's petition for review and reversed and remanded\n\nfor entry of judgment reflecting the stipulated judgment amount of $175,000. The\n\ncourt held that the amount of a covenant judgment, when found to be\n\nreasonable, is the \"presumptive measure of the insured's harm\":\n\n              We hold the amount of a covenant judgment is the\n       presumptive measure of an insured's harm caused by an insurer's\n       tortious bad faith if the covenant judgment is reasonable under the\n       Chaussee criteria. [Chaussee v. Maryland Cas. Co., 60 Wn. App.\n       504, 803P.2d 1339. 812 P.2d 487, review denied. 117Wn.2d 1018\n       (1991).] This approach promotes reasonable settlements and\n       discourages fraud and collusion. Furthermore, using the amount of\n       a covenant judgment to measure tort damages in this context\n       makes sense in light of our long-standing requirement that such\n                                              21\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/22\n\n\n\n\n      settlements be reasonable. If a reasonable and good faith\n      settlement amount of a covenant judgment does not measure an\n      insured's harm, our requirements that such settlements be\n      reasonable is meaningless. Finally, the Chaussee criteria protect\n      insurers from excessive judgments especially where, as here, the\n      insurer has notice of the reasonableness hearing and has an\n      opportunity to argue against the settlement's reasonableness.\n\nBesel, 146 Wn.2d at 738-39.\n\n      According to Safeco, where Besel says the amount of a covenant\n\njudgment is \"the presumptive measure of an insured's harm,\" it means that the\n\ninsured's damages for the tort of bad faith are limited to the amount of damages\n\nthe insured caused to the third party, as measured by the covenant judgment.\n\nAs we read Besel, however, the reference to the \"presumptive\" measure of harm\n\nis not a limitation. It does not appear that Besel claimed Viking's bad faith\n\nconduct caused the driver any damages other than liability for the judgment, so\n\nthere was no reason for the court to announce a rule barring Besel, as the\n\ndriver's assignee, from recovering additional damages personal to the driver.\n\nWhen Besel is read in context with the Court of Appeals decision that it reversed,\n\nthe proper interpretation of the above-quoted paragraph is that harm to the\n\ninsured is presumptively worth at least the amount of the covenant judgment—\n\nnot less. The Supreme Court implicitly confirmed this interpretation by explaining\n\nin a recent case that \"in the insurance setting, the presumptive amount is added\n\nto any other damages found by the jury.\" Bird v. Best Plumbing Group. LLC. 175\n\nWn.2d 756, 770, 287 P.3d 551 (2012) (emphasis added). The holding of Bird is\n\nthat a reasonableness hearing is an equitable procedure. The court stated,\n\n\"Here, there is no factual determination to be made on damages in the later bad\n                                            22\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/23\n\n\n\n\nfaith claim, at least not with respect to the covenant judgment.\" Bird, 175 Wn.2d\n\nat 772 (emphasis added). This sentence indicates the way is open for a jury to\n\nmake a factual determination of an insured's bad faith damages other than and in\n\naddition to the covenant judgment.\n\n       Safeco proposes that \"an insured should be put to an election. It must\n\neither prove all of its damages or it may choose to confine any bad faith recovery\n\nto the covenant judgment settlement amount. As a matter of law, it should not be\n\nable to recover both.\"19 As authority, Safeco cites only former Justice James\n\nDolliver's dissent in Butler. Justice Dolliver's concerns did not persuade the\n\nmajority in Butler, nor did they prevail when considered again in Mutual of\n\nEnumclaw Insurance Company, 161 Wn.2d at 921.\n\n       Where the insured has caused damages clearly exceeding policy limits,\n\nan insurer's failure to offer policy limits exposes the insured to the risk of an\n\nexcess judgment. Once it is determined that the insurer acted in bad faith by\n\nfailing to settle, typically the chief component of the insured's damage caused by\n\nthat failure will be the insured's liability to the third party. This component is\n\nmeasured by the amount of the third party's covenant judgment against the\n\ninsured. However, the insured's damages may include as an additional\n\ncomponent the damages caused to him by the insurer's bad faith. Examples\n\ninclude the potential effect on the insured's credit rating, damage to reputation,\n\nloss of business opportunities, and loss of control of the case. Butler, 118 Wn.2d\n\nat 399, 392. Other examples are loss of interest, attorney fees and costs,\n\n       19 Brief of Appellant at 61.\n                                              23\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/24\n\n\n\n\nfinancial penalties for delayed payments, and emotional distress, anxiety, and\n\nfear.

Butler. 118 Wn.2d at\n\n399. Because Kenny had the right to sue Safeco for damages other than and in\n\naddition to the amount of the covenant judgment, Miller acquired that right.\n\n       Safeco has not presented a coherent rationale based on policy or\n\nprecedent for limiting damages to the amount of the covenant judgment. A\n\ncovenant judgment, when found reasonable in a proceeding in equity, is the\n\npresumed measure of damage only for the insured's liability to third parties. The\n\ndamages personal to the insured are determined by a finder of fact. The trial\n\ncourt properly allowed the jury to consider various elements of damage sustained\n\nby Kenny in addition to his liability to the passengers for the stipulated amount of\n\n$4.15 million.\n\n       We conclude the trial court did not err in allowing the jury to find damages\n\nin excess of the stipulated settlement.\n\n\n\n\n                                            24\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/25\n\n\n\n\n                                      UIM LIMITS\n\n\n       Early in the bad faith litigation, a dispute arose over the limits of\n\nPeterson's underinsured motorist coverage. The court ruled that the UIM limits\n\nwere $500,000, not $100,000 as Safeco had represented. Whether Safeco\n\nacted in bad faith in making that representation was left to the jury to decide.\n\nMiller argued to the jury that Safeco misrepresented the UIM limits in bad faith\n\nand, as a result, kept back proceeds that could have been used to settle\n\nPeterson's claim and help protect Kenny.20\n\n       Safeco assigns error to the ruling that the limits were $500,000.\n\n       Washington law requires insurers to offer UIM coverage \"in the same\n\namount as the insured's third party liability coverage unless the insured rejects all\n\nor part of the coverage.\" RCW 48.22.030(3). \"The Legislature, by the wording of\n\nthe UIM rejection clause, intended that a named insured decline UIM coverage\n\nby an affirmative and conscious act and that such a rejection be in writing.\"\n\nClements v. Travelers Indem. Co.. 121 Wn.2d 243, 254, 850 P.2d 1298 (1993);\n\nRCW 48.22.030(4). Once the insured has signed such a rejection, it remains\n\nvalid upon subsequent renewals of the policy. RCW 48.22.030(4). But if the\n\ninsurer issues a new policy, it must again offer UIM coverage limits equal to the\n\nliability limits. Johnson v. Farmers Ins. Co. of Wash.. 117 Wn.2d 558, 570, 817\n\nP.2d841 (1991).\n\n\n\n\n       20 See, e.g., Report of Proceedings (Dec. 5, 2011) at 37-38 (Miller's opening statement);\nReport of Proceedings (Dec. 15-16, 2011) at 103, 123-25, 128-29 (closing argument).\n\n                                              25\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/26\n\n\n\n\n        From 1997 to 1999, the Petersons had an American States Insurance\n\npolicy with liability limits of $500,000 per person and per accident. In January\n\n1997, Cassandra Peterson's mother signed a written partial waiver, selecting\n\nUIM limits of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident. In April 1997, she\n\nagain signed the waiver selecting the lower limits.\n\n       In November 1999, the Petersons added Cassandra's Volkswagen Passat\n\nto their American States policy. The UIM limits for the Passat alone were set at\n\n$500,000, equal to the liability limits. The declarations page notes that \"this\n\nendorsement reflects the addition of the 1994 Volkswagen Passat eff. 11/3/99.\"\n\nSafeco charged $42.00 for the UIM coverage on the Passat and $24.80 apiece\n\nfor two other vehicles. The Petersons paid the premium.\n\n       Safeco acquired American States in 1997. In early 2000, Safeco issued\n\nthe Petersons the policy that was in effect in August 2000 when the Passat,\n\ndriven by Kenny, rear-ended the cement truck. The policy listed the UIM limits\n\nfor all three vehicles as $100,000/$300,000 effective April 20, 2000. A page\n\nentitled \"Changes To Your Policy\" advised the Petersons that the UIM limits\n\nreflected their previous choice to have UIM coverage in an amount less than\n\nliability coverage.\n\n       The amount of coverage you previously selected for protection\n       against uninsured and/or underinsured motorists was less than the\n       bodily injury liability coverage you selected, or you rejected the\n       coverage altogether. The choice you made has been reflected on\n       this replacement policy. Other limits and prices are available.\n\nSafeco did not include a written waiver for the Petersons to sign. The Petersons\n\nrequested no changes. They paid the lower premium for the Passat's reduced\n                                            26\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/27\n\n\n\n\nUIM coverage—$37.70, as compared to the previous premium of $42.00 for UIM\n\nlimits of $500,000.\n\n      The issue on appeal is whether the Safeco policy issued in early 2000 with\n\nUIM limits of only $100,000 was a new policy requiring a written waiver or a\n\nrenewal policy not requiring a written waiver. Johnson adopted a materiality\n\nstandard to distinguish a new policy from a renewal policy. Torgerson v. State\n\nFarm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 91 Wn. App. 952, 958, 957 P.2d 1283 (1998). Adding\n\nan automobile to a policy is not by itself a material change creating a new policy.\n\nJohnson, 117 Wn.2d at 574. But changes in UIM coverage levels are material.\n\nTorgerson. 91 Wn. App. at 960-61.\n\n       For the 1997 American States policy, Cassandra Peterson's mother\n\nagreed in writing to UIM limits of $100,000. Safeco contends the 2000 policy\n\nwas a renewal of the 1997 policy because it maintained UIM coverage at the\n\nsame level. According to Safeco, the declarations page setting the Passat's UIM\n\nlimits at $500,000 when the Passat was added to the policy in 1999 was a\n\nscrivener's error that should be disregarded.\n\n       Safeco cites American Commerce Insurance Company v. Ensley, 153 Wn.\n\nApp. 31. 220 P.3d 215 (2009), review denied. 169Wn.2d 1010(2010). In order\n\nto keep her premiums low, Donna Ensley signed a waiver to lower her UIM\n\ncoverage from $500,000 to $50,000. Later, she cancelled the collision coverage\n\non one of her vehicles. The insurer mistakenly cancelled all coverage on that\n\nvehicle. Ensley pointed out the mistake, and the insurer corrected it by\n\nreinstating coverage on that vehicle other than collision. The insurer also\n                                            27\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/28\n\n\n\n\ngranted Ensley's request for a higher deductible. When Ensley's son was\n\nseriously injured while riding as a passenger in another of Ensley's vehicles,\n\nEnsley claimed that the changes made to the policy after her first waiver were\n\nmaterial and the reduction of UIM coverage to $50,000 was ineffective because\n\nthe insurer did not obtain a second written waiver. This court held that these\n\nchanges did not result in a new policy because the UIM coverage level did not\n\nchange after the first written waiver. Ensley, 153 Wn. App. at 41-42.\n\n       Safeco suggests that the policy issued to the Petersons in 2000 was\n\nsimply the correction of an earlier mistake, and like the correction of the mistake\n\nin Ensley. it did not create a new policy. This argument fails. The insurer's\n\nmistake in Ensley was not material and did not create a new policy, most\n\nimportantly because it did not affect the level of Ensley's UIM coverage. Ensley,\n\n153 Wn. App. at 42. Therefore, Ensley's written waiver remained effective.\n\n       Here, the Petersons paid an extra premium for UIM coverage of $500,000\n\non their daughter's Passat in 1999. Whether this happened because they\n\nrequested it or because of a scrivener's error is immaterial; the essential fact is\n\nthat the Petersons paid to have limits of $500,000. The Safeco policy issued in\n\n2000 reduced the UIM coverage on the Passat from $500,000 to $100,000.\n\nUnder Johnson and Torgerson, that reduction was a material change that\n\ncreated a new policy.\n\n      The insurer has the burden of obtaining a knowing written rejection in\n\norder to avoid the statutory requirement for UIM coverage. Clements, 121 Wn.2d\n\nat 255. Safeco did not obtain a knowing written rejection when it issued the\n                                             28\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/29\n\n\n\n\npolicy in 2000 with limits reduced back down from $500,000 to $100,000. The\n\ntrial court correctly determined that because Safeco did not obtain a written\n\nwaiver, the UIM limits were equal to the liability limits of $500,000.\n\n       The trial court did not decide that Safeco's investigation and disclosure of\n\nthe UIM limits was bad faith as a matter of law. The court ruled that material\n\nissues of fact remained as to whether Safeco reasonably believed the reduced\n\nUIM limits in the 2000 policy simply corrected a scrivener's error. The phase two\n\nverdict specifically determined that Safeco failed to act in good faith with respect\n\nto Peterson's UIM claim and thereby caused damage to her of $350,000. We\n\nfind no error in the court's decision to permit this issue to go to the jury.\n\n                  ATTEMPT TO DEPOSE MILLER'S ATTORNEY\n\n       The introduction to Safeco's brief on appeal accuses Miller's attorney,\n\nRalph Brindley, of frustrating Safeco's reasonable efforts at settlement in a\n\ndeliberate attempt to set up a bad faith claim:\n\n                This case demonstrates how an insurer can be \"set up\" for a\n       bad faith claim. Too often, attorneys for claimants are not\n       interested in actually settling their clients' claims when they believe\n       that the applicable liability insurance limits are low compared to the\n       severity of the injuries at issue. Instead, they readily frustrate\n       settlement efforts, looking to trap the insurer in the handling of the\n       claim by manipulating events to set up the insurer for a bad faith\n       action by the insured, an action their clients receive by assignment\n       in the course of negotiating an inflated covenant judgment\n       settlement. That is precisely what happened here.\n                The insurer, in this case, Safeco Insurance Company of\n       Illinois (\"Safeco\"), was blamed for the lack of a settlement in the\n       underlying case between driver/insured Patrick Kenny and his\n       passengers, Ryan Miller, Ashley Bethards, and Cassandra\n       Peterson. Safeco made a concerted effort to eliminate Kenny's\n       exposure. But Safeco was faced with paying all liability insurance\n       to one of three injured claimants thereby leaving its insured with no\n                                              29\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/30\n\n\n\n\n       coverage for the remaining two claims, or declining to pay the full\n       limit to one of the three. It opted for the latter and was sued in bad\n      faith for the failure to settle.\n               Settlement was frustrated at every turn by Ralph Brindley,\n       Miller's lawyer. The trial court, however, refused to allow any\n       discovery regarding Brindley's role in frustrating Safeco's\n       settlement efforts on Miller's behalf and setting up Safeco for a bad\n      faith action.1211\n\nSafeco claims that Brindley made unreasonable settlement demands, rebuffed\n\nSafeco's attempts to facilitate mediation, and manipulated the other claimants\n\nand their attorneys into signing the settlement agreement, all in order to put Miller\n\nin the driver's seat for what turned out to be a lucrative bad faith claim. The issue\n\non appeal is whether the trial court unfairly prevented Safeco from questioning\n\nBrindley about his strategy.\n\n       In February 2007, Safeco sent Brindley a notice of deposition and a\n\nsubpoena duces tecum for his correspondence, memorializations of\n\nconversations, and other documents in the underlying Miller v. Kenny litigation.\n\nAs the defendant in the bad faith action, Safeco wanted to question Brindley\n\nabout the rationale behind his negotiation tactics, his understanding of the\n\nprovision of the settlement in which Kenny reserved his claims for personal\n\ndamages, and his motive for bringing Miller's suit against Kenny. On April 23,\n\n2007, Miller moved to quash on the basis of attorney-client privilege and asked\n\nthe court to enter a protective order precluding further deposition and discovery\n\nrequests.\n\n       The trial court considered Safeco's request to depose Brindley under the\n\n\n\n       21 Brief of Appellant Safeco at 1-2.\n                                              30\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/31\n\n\n\n\nthree-part test outlined in Shelton v. American Motors Corporation. 805 F.2d\n\n1323, 1327 (8th Cir. 1986):\n\n       We recognize that circumstances may arise in which the court\n       should order the taking of opposing counsel's deposition. But those\n       circumstances should be limited to where the party seeking to take\n       the deposition has shown that (1) no other means exist to obtain\n       the information than to depose opposing counsel, see, e.g..\n       Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. v. Superior Court. 140 Cal.Rptr. 677,\n       679, 72 Cal.App.3d 786 (1977); (2) the information sought is\n       relevant and nonprivileged; and (3) the information is crucial to the\n       preparation of the case.\n\nFocusing on prong two, the trial court responded initially that even if Brindley's\n\nstrategy in the Miller v. Kenny action was relevant to the bad faith action against\nSafeco, Safeco had not shown the information it was seeking was unprivileged.\n\nSafeco then argued that if Brindley could not be deposed, the court should not\n\npermit Miller to call him as a witness at trial.\n\n       The trial court granted Miller's motion to quash in March 2008. Later, the\n\ncourt ruled that Miller would not be able to call Brindley as a witness at trial\n\nwithout giving at least 60 days' notice, and if that occurred, Safeco would be\n\npermitted to renew its request for a deposition.\n\n       As the trial was about to begin in November 2011, Miller added Brindley to\n\nhis witness list. Safeco objected, and the court granted Safeco's motion to\n\nexclude Brindley. Brindley did not testify.\n\n       Safeco contends the order granting Miller's motion to quash was\n\nprejudicial error warranting a new trial. A discovery order is reviewed for abuse\n\nof discretion. T.S. v. Bov Scouts of Am.. 157 Wn.2d 416, 423, 138P.3d 1053\n\n(2006).\n                                               31\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/32\n\n\n\n\n       Under authorities cited by Safeco, information possessed by plaintiff's\n\ncounsel in the underlying case may well be relevant in a bad faith case, and a\n\ndeposition may be the most efficient way to obtain the information. If so, a\n\nblanket assertion of attorney-client privilege is not a sufficient basis to resist a\n\nnotice of deposition. See, e.g., Meritplan Ins. Co. v. Superior Court. 124 Cal.\n\nApp. 3d 237, 177 Cal. Rptr. 236, 237 (1981). However, Meritplan and similar\n\ncases have not established a per se rule that a deposition of plaintiff's counsel in\n\nthe underlying case must always be allowed in a bad faith case.\n\n       The trial court in this case did not accept a blanket assertion of attorney-\n\nclient privilege. Relying on Shelton. the court required Safeco to demonstrate\n\nthat the specific information sought by Safeco was nonprivileged. Although\n\nShelton has not been formally adopted in Washington, it is a leading case, and it\n\nis not inconsistent with Meritplan. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by\n\nlooking to Shelton for guidance.\n\n       Applying the Shelton test, the trial court concluded that Safeco had failed\n\nto establish that the information it would be seeking from Brindley was\n\nnonprivileged. The record supports this conclusion. What Meritplan refers to as\n\nrelevant information that may be most efficiently obtained through deposition is\n\n\"the circumstances and content of the various negotiations and communications\n\nbetween the involved individuals.\" Meritplan. 124 Cal. App. 3d at 241. This is\n\nnot the type of information Safeco wanted from Brindley. Safeco wanted to ask\n\nBrindley about matters that are covered by the attorney-client privilege and the\n\nwork product privilege, including Brindley's strategy in refusing mediation and\n                                              32\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/33\n\n\n\n\nwhy he demanded the entire policy limits for Miller. For example, counsel for\n\nSafeco told the trial court, \"I want to know whether he was posturing in making a\n\nsettlement demand or not.\"22\n\n      And Safeco does not persuasively show that being deprived of the\n\nopportunity to depose Brindley was prejudicial. Safeco did take the depositions\n\nof John Barlow and Monte Wolff, the attorneys who, respectively, represented\n\nBethards and Peterson during the time period leading up to the settlement\n\nagreement. Safeco did not use their depositions at trial. Presumably, this was\n\nbecause their testimony, while mildly critical of Brindley's aggressiveness, was\n\nmore pointedly critical of Safeco for waiting so long to tender policy limits. The\n\nsame type of testimony coming from Brindley would not have been helpful to\n\nSafeco.\n\n       Safeco's rhetorical complaint that the bad faith litigation was a setup\n\nengineered by Brindley was not successful with the jury, and as a legal argument\n\nit is equally unsuccessful. Pressing for a policy limits settlement for a badly\n\ninjured client is a professional responsibility, not a sinister plot. Keeping bad faith\n\nlitigation in mind as plan B ifthe insurer balks is a fair practice. Safeco could\n\nhave protected itself by putting the limits on the table for all three passengers.\n\n       Safeco refers to the covenant judgment of $4.15 million as \"inflated.\" But\n\nSafeco itself stipulated to that amount as a reasonable measure of the damages\n\nincurred by Kenny's three passengers over and above the $1.8 million in policy\n\n\n\n       22 Report of Proceedings (July 20, 2007) at 6.\n\n                                               33\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/34\n\n\n\n\nproceeds already tendered. The legal requirement of a reasonableness hearing\n\nis there to protect insurers from inflated covenant judgments resulting from\n\ncollusion and fraud. See, e.g.. Water's Edge Homeowners Ass'n v. Water's\n\nEdge Assocs.. 152 Wn. App. 572, 216 P.3d 1110 (2009). review denied. 168\n\nWn.2d 1019 (2010). There was no evidence of collusion or fraud around the\n\nsettlement in this case. The claimants had serious injuries and were not at fault.\n\nSafeco, after resisting early demands for settlement on the basis that the three\n\nclaims together did not approach the policy limits of $1.5 million, eventually\n\nstipulated that the total injuries exceeded policy limits by $4.15 million. It is hard\n\nto see how deposing Brindley could have helped Safeco put its delay in\n\ndisclosing and offering policy limits into a more favorable light.\n\n       Under these circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by\n\nputting Brindley's deposition off limits unless Miller waived the privilege by calling\n\nBrindley as a witness at trial.\n\n       We conclude the order quashing the subpoena for Ralph Brindley did not\n\nconstitute prejudicial error justifying a new trial.\n\n                         EVIDENCE OF LOSS RESERVES\n\n       Soon after the accident, Safeco was aware that Kenny, its insured, was\n\nmost likely 100 percent at fault for his passengers' serious injuries. Safeco set its\n\nreserve for liability at $1.5 million, a figure that included the umbrella policy limits\n\nas well as the liability limits in the regular policy. The UIM reserve was $100,000.\n\nAs part of its ongoing responsibility to stay informed about Kenny's exposure,\n\nSafeco reviewed its reserves approximately 20 times over the next 30 months.\n                                               34\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/35\n\n\n\n\nEach time, Safeco concluded that Kenny was exposed to liability substantially in\n\nexcess of policy limits.\n\n       Safeco moved in limine to exclude this evidence as irrelevant or more\n\nprejudicial than probative. The trial court denied the motion. Safeco assigns\n\nerrorto this evidentiary ruling. We review for abuse of discretion. Goehle v. Fred\n\nHutchinson Cancer Research Ctr.. 100 Wn. App. 609, 617, 1 P.3d 579, review\n\ndenied. 142Wn.2d 1010(2000).\n\n       Reserves are estimates of the amount insurers will need in the future for\n\nunpaid claims and adjustment expenses. Reserves are used in determining an\n\ninsurer's financial condition. RCW 48.12.030(2), .090. Because a reserve is an\n\nestimate that includes attorney fees and other adjustment expenses, it cannot be\n\nequated with settlement authority. Accordingly, in a personal injury suit,\n\nevidence of reserves may not be admitted as an acknowledgement of liability,\n\nand reserves are generally viewed as irrelevant to show how much an injury is\n\nworth. Silvav. Basin W.. Inc., 47 P.3d 1184, 1191 (Colo. 2002).\n\n       However, reserves may be relevant and admissible in a case where the\n\nissue is whether the insurance company fulfilled its duty to adjust the insured's\n\nclaim in good faith. See Silva. 47 P.3d at 1191-92. Here, for many months,\n\nSafeco refused to make the full amount of policy limits available to settle a case\n\nin which, as shown by the reserves, it had known almost from day one that its\n\ninsured was exposed to much greater liability. The evidence was relevant and\n\nnot unduly prejudicial. Safeco was free to explain through an expert witness or\n\nemployee \"the reason the reserve was established, the reasonableness of the\n                                            35\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/36\n\n\n\n\namount of the reserve, the allocation between indemnity and loss adjustment\n\nexpenses and any other evidence relevant to the issue from the insurer's\n\nstandpoint.\" Lipton v. Superior Court. 48 Cal. App. 4th 1599, 1615 n.17, 56 Cal.\n\nRptr. 2d 341 (1996).\n\n       As a general policy, it is preferable that loss reserves not be admitted into\n\nevidence, because when an insurer sets loss reserves it should be solely\n\nconcerned with the purpose of ensuring the company's financial stability and\n\nshould not be tempted to \"manipulate its reserves\" to be consistent with the\n\ninsurer's settlement position. Stephen S. Ashley, Bad Faith Actions: Liability\n\nand Damages § 10:31 (1997). In this case, however, the discrepancy between\n\nSafeco's loss reserves and its settlement posture was enduring and sizable. We\n\nconclude the relevance was high enough to overcome the policy concern. The\n\ndecision to admit the evidence was within the trial court's discretion.\n\n                        DEPOSITION OF MARYLE TRACY\n\n       Safeco contends the trial court committed reversible error by allowing the\n\njury to view the videotaped deposition of Maryle Tracy, a Safeco claims analyst.\n\nTracy was briefly involved in the case during the time Kenny was considering\n\nassigning his rights and stipulating to judgment. In the deposition, Tracy was\n\nquestioned by Miller about incentive programs for Safeco's employees that linked\n\nbonuses to cost control. Tracy's answers were evasive, and the trial judge later\n\nremarked that Tracy \"was not a good witness for Safeco.\"23\n\n       Miller confronted Tracy with interrogatory answers she had provided on\n\n\n       23 Report of Proceedings (Apr. 16, 2012) at 42.\n                                              36\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/37\n\n\n\n\nbehalf of Safeco in 2004 in a case in South Dakota. Tracy had initially denied\n\nthat Safeco had programs rewarding its employees for keeping costs down, but\n\nshe later amended her answers to admit that such programs did exist.24\n\n       Safeco contends the deposition should have been excluded because it\n\nwas irrelevant, unduly prejudicial, and involved impeachment on a collateral\n\nmatter.\n\n\n       Safeco's bonus and incentive programs were admissible to show that\n\nSafeco, at relevant times, was rewarding its adjusters financially for clamping\n\ndown on coverage and defense costs. The existence of these programs and the\n\naction by a claims analyst to conceal them supplied evidence of Safeco's motive\n\nto avoid settling for policy limits. The deposition thus was relevant to the bad\n\nfaith claim and not unduly prejudicial.\n\n          Safeco did not object below on the basis that evidence of Tracy amending\n\nher answers in the South Dakota case was impeachment on a collateral matter.\n\nThat objection is not preserved, and we decline to address it.\n\n          We find no abuse of discretion in the decision to admit Tracy's deposition.\n\n                               ATTORNEY MISCONDUCT\n\nLeading Questions\n\n          David Beninger, Brindley's partner, represented Miller at trial. Beninger\n\nrepeatedly asked leading questions of his own witnesses, drawing numerous\n\nobjections. Safeco contends the questions were often testimonial in nature and\n\n\n\n          24 Report of Proceedings (Dec. 8, 2012) at 153-82.\n\n                                                 37\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/38\n\n\n\n\nthat the cumulative effect tainted the trial irreparably.\n\n       A new trial may be granted based on prejudicial misconduct of counsel if\n\nthe moving party establishes that the conduct complained of constitutes\n\nmisconduct, as distinct from mere aggressive advocacy, and that the misconduct\n\nis prejudicial in the context of the entire record. Aluminum Co. of Am. v. Aetna\n\nCas.& Surety Co.. 140 Wn.2d 517, 539, 998 P.2d 856 (2000).\n\n       One type of misconduct that may justify a new trial is unfairly and\n\nimproperly exposing the jury to inadmissible evidence. Teter v. Deck, 174 Wn.2d\n\n207, 223-25, 274 P.3d 336 (2012). \"While the asking of leading questions is not\n\nprejudicial error in most instances, the persistent pursuit of such a course of\n\naction is a factor to be added in the balance.\" State v. Torres. 16 Wn. App. 254,\n\n258, 554P.2d 1069(1976).\n\n       In denying Safeco's motion for a new trial, the trial court commented,\n\n\"there's no doubt Mr. Beninger is the king of leading questions.\"25 The court\n\nobserved, however, that there had been an unusually large number of objections\n\nfrom both sides, that almost all of Safeco's objections to leading questions were\n\nsustained, and that Safeco had made no request for a curative instruction. \"So I\n\ndid not believe the number and nature of those questions were so obnoxious and\n\ntainted the jury to a degree that a new trial would be warranted.\"26\n\n       The trial court is in the best position to most effectively determine if\n\ncounsel's misconduct prejudiced a party's right to a fair trial. Teter, 174 Wn.2d at\n\n\n\n       25 Report of Proceedings (Apr. 16, 2012) at 44.\n       26 Report of Proceedings (Apr. 16, 2012) at 44.\n                                              38\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/39\n\n\n\n\n223. The particular instances of improper questioning cited by Safeco are not so\n\nprejudicial in the context of the record as a whole as to compel us to disagree\n\nwith the trial court's assessment.\n\n\nClosing Argument\n\n       Safeco contends Beninger's closing argument resulted in a verdict that\n\nwas the product of passion and prejudice, and that the trial court should have\n\ngranted a new trial on this basis.\n\n       Safeco moved in limine to preclude counsel from making a \"golden rule\"\n\nargument or a \"send-a-message\" argument. A golden rule argument urges jurors\n\nto imagine themselves in the position of a party and to grant that party the relief\n\nthey would wish to have for themselves. A golden rule argument is improper.\n\nAdkins v. Aluminum Co. of Am., 110 Wn.2d 128, 139, 750 P.2d 1257, 756 P.2d\n\n142 (1988). At the hearing on Safeco's motion, Beninger agreed to refrain from\n\nmaking a golden rule argument, but he argued that in a bad faith case, \"the\n\nwhole purpose being deterrence,\" it would be inappropriate to ban a \"send-a-\n\nmessage\" argument.27 The trial court granted Safeco's motion in limine only as it\n\npertained to golden rule arguments.\n\n       Beninger began closing argument by explaining that a trial takes place in\n\nthe locale where key events happened because the local jury reflects the\n\n\"conscience of the community\" and serves as a protector and guardian for the\n\ncommunity.28 This speech was not a golden rule argument. Appeals for a jury to\n\n\n\n       27 Report of Proceedings (Nov. 22, 2011) at 86.\n       28 Report of Proceedings (Dec. 15, 2011) at 63.\n                                              39\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/40\n\n\n\n\nact as a conscience of the community are not impermissible, unless specifically\n\ndesigned to inflame the jury. State v. Finch. 137 Wn.2d 792, 842, 975 P.2d 967,\n\ncert, denied. 528 U.S. 922 (1999). Miller's argument was not inflammatory, and it\n\nwas not an appeal to parochial pride or prejudice. Cf. Pederson v. Dumouchel.\n\n72 Wn.2d 73, 83, 431 P.2d 973 (1967) (defense counsel, who lost no opportunity\n\nto point out that plaintiff and his lawyers and witnesses did not live in Aberdeen,\n\n\"attempted to turn the jury into a hometown rooting section.\")\n\n         Beninger asked the jury to consider whether Safeco's conduct reflected\n\n\"how we, as a community, want to be treated\":\n\n         did they do things the right way to reflect how we, as a community,\n         want to be treated? And if so, side with Safeco. Side with Safeco.\n         And then hope you don't have an accident with someone from\n         Safeco. Or the other insurance companies, who will all be seeing\n         this, as we've heard, from the experts, they will all be publicizing\n         this, and they will all be a race to the bottom then. But that's your\n         decision. That's your values. That's what you get to decide, how\n         we all are going to be treated equally, what that means.[29]\n\n         Although Safeco did not object to this speech or any other portion of\n\nplaintiff's closing argument, Safeco contends that the motion in limine preserved\n\nerror.\n\n\n         The court's ruling on the motion in limine precluded golden rule arguments\n\nbut not send-a-message arguments. The argument about \"how we, as a\n\ncommunity, want to be treated\" is close to the line separating the two. Under\n\nthese circumstances, the ruling in limine did not excuse Safeco from making a\n\nmore contemporaneous objection. The vice of a golden rule argument is that it\n\n\n\n         29 Report of Proceedings (Dec. 15, 2011) at 72.\n                                                40\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/41\n\n\n\n\nencourages the jury to \"'depart from neutrality and to decide the case on the\n\nbasis of personal interest and bias rather than on the evidence.'\" Adkins. 110\n\nWn.2d at 139 (emphasis added), quoting Roias v. Richardson, 703 F.2d 186, 191\n\n(5th Cir. 1983). Beninger did not appeal to juror self-interest; rather, he appealed\n\nto the jurors' interest as members of the public to \"protect the public interest\" and\n\nto enforce the public \"compact\" that insurance companies have under the law to\n\ncomplywith their duties of reasonable care, good faith, and fair dealing.30 This is\n\nnot improper argument in a bad faith case.\n\n       The effect of a golden rule argument on a jury is \"difficult to ascertain,\"\n\nand in most cases, any prejudicial effect can be removed, if there is a timely\n\nobjection, by the trial court instructing the jury to disregard the argument. Adkins.\n\n110 Wn.2d at 142. Safeco did not make a timely objection. And the challenged\n\nremarks when read in the overall context of the trial are more properly\n\ncharacterized as aggressive advocacy than as misconduct. We therefore\n\nconclude the argument of counsel did not furnish a basis for ordering a new trial.\n\n                                     INTEREST\n\n\nPrejudgment Interest\n\n       On March 8, 2012, the trial court entered an order awarding Miller\n\nprejudgment interest of $7.115 million. This figure was determined by taking the\n\nsettlement of $4.15 million reached by Kenny and the three claimants in May\n\n2003 and compounding it annually at 12 percent. The rate of 12 percent was\n\nspecified in the settlement agreement:\n\n\n       30 Report of Proceedings (Dec. 15, 2011) at 83.\n                                              41\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/42\n\n\n\n\n       Interest: The parties acknowledge that a delay in the determination\n       or entry of judgments may be of benefit to Mr. Kenny, but\n       detrimental to the Plaintiffs. Therefore, the parties agree that 12%\n       statutory rate of interest shall accrue and compound annually on\n       the unpaid damages from the date of this agreement.\n\n       Safeco assigns error to the order awarding prejudgment interest, but\n\nSafeco's brief does not explain how it was erroneous. Below, Safeco argued that\n\nprejudgment interest was already encompassed by instruction 30, which allowed\n\nthe jury to award, as damages, \"Lost or diminished assets or property, including\n\nvalue of money.\" Safeco also argued below that if the court did award\n\nprejudgment interest, it should not begin to run until the date of the\n\nreasonableness stipulation in 2005. Safeco does not present these arguments\n\non appeal. The failure of an appellant to provide argument and citation of\n\nauthority in support of an assignment of error precludes appellate consideration\n\nof an alleged error. RAP 10.3; Avellaneda v. State. 167 Wn. App. 474, 482 n.5,\n\n273 P.3d 477 (2012). Therefore, the award of $7,115 million in prejudgment\n\ninterest will not be disturbed.\n\nPostiudgment Interest\n\n       On June 14, 2012, the trial court entered an order awarding postjudgment\n\ninterest at the rate of 12 percent. The trial court accepted Miller's argument that\n\nthe 12 percent rate of contract interest specified in the May 2003 agreement was\n\nthe applicable rate not only for prejudgment interest but also for the final\n\njudgment. This was error because the final judgment against Safeco was\n\nfounded on tortious conduct. See RCW 4.56.110(3)(b).\n\n\n\n                                             42\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/43\n\n\n\n\n       Miller relies on the principle that interest on a judgment will run at a\n\nspecified interest rate for which the parties have contracted, even where the\n\ncontract is a settlement agreement that settles a tort suit. \"Once parties have\n\nagreed to settle a tort claim, the foundation for the judgment is their written\n\ncontract, not the underlying allegations of tortious conduct.\" Jackson v. Fenix\n\nUnderground. Inc.. 142 Wn. App. 141, 146, 173 P.3d 977 (2007), applying RCW\n\n4.56.110(1).\n\n       In Jackson, the judgment at issue was a covenant judgment entered in the\n\nunderlying action between the claimants and the insured defendant after a\n\nreasonableness hearing in which the insurer participated. Our statement in\n\nJackson quoted above \"referred to the allegations of tort liability that were\n\nresolved by the settlement in the underlying suit.\" Unigard Ins. Co. v. Mut. of\n\nEnumclaw Ins. Co.. 160 Wn. App. 912, 926, 250 P.3d 121 (2011). In Jackson,\n\nthere was no secondary bad faith action against the insurer. Here, the judgment\n\naccumulating interest is not the claimants' settlement with Kenny in May 2003. It\n\nis the judgment on the verdict of $13 million in the secondary bad faith action\n\nagainst Safeco entered on March 8, 2012. Irrespective of the 2003 agreement\n\nby which the passengers in the Passat settled their personal injury claims against\n\nKenny, Miller's judgment against Safeco exists only because Miller prevailed\n\nagainst Safeco on the assigned bad faith claims. There was no settlement\n\nagreement between Miller and Safeco. See Unigard. 160 Wn. App. at 926.\n\n       As a further basis for arguing that contract interest was properly awarded\n\non the judgment against Safeco, Miller points out that the jury found that Safeco\n                                              43\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/44\n\n\n\n\nbreached its obligations under the insurance contract. The insurance contract\n\nhas no bearing on the question as it does not specify a rate of interest.\n\n       The primary foundation for Miller's judgment against Safeco was Safeco's\n\ntortious bad faith conduct. See Unigard. 160 Wn. App. at 927-28; Woo v.\n\nFireman's Fund Ins. Co.. 150 Wn. App. 158, 165, 208 P.3d 557. review denied.\n\n167 Wn.2d 1008 (2009). The trial court should have set postjudgment interest at\n\nthe tort judgment rate of RCW 4.56.110(3)(b). The judgment must be remanded\n\nto make that correction.\n\n\n                                ATTORNEY FEES\n\n       On March 8, 2012, the court also entered a judgment awarding Miller\n\nattorney fees and costs. The basis for the award was the Consumer Protection\n\nAct, RCW 19.86.090.\n\n       The court accepted Miller's lodestar calculation of attorney fees of\n\n$1,071,470, based on a total of 3,229.8 hours. The hourly rate the court\n\naccepted as reasonable was $400 to $450 for attorney David Beninger, $325 for\n\nattorneys Deborah Martin and Patricia Anderson, $300 to $450 for appellate\n\ncounsel Howard Goodfriend, and $75 to $125 for paralegal services by three\n\nindividuals. The court granted a multiplier of 1.5 for a total attorney fee award of\n\n$1,563,803.75. This was the precise amount requested by Miller. Safeco\n\ncontends the amount is unreasonable and the trial court failed to give Miller's fee\n\nrequest appropriate scrutiny.\n\n      This court reviews a trial court's award of attorney fees for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Mahler v. Szucs. 135 Wn.2d 398, 435, 957 P.2d 632, 966 P.2d 305\n\n                                            44\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/45\n\n\n\n\n(1998). To reverse an attorney fee award, we must find the trial court exercised\n\nits discretion on untenable grounds or for untenable reasons. Chuong Van Pham\n\nv. City of Seattle. 159 Wn.2d 527, 538, 151 P.3d 976 (2007).\n\n       A determination of reasonable attorney fees begins with a calculation of\n\nthe \"lodestar,\" which is the number of hours reasonably expended on the\n\nlitigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate. Mahler. 135 Wn.2d at 433-34.\n\n       Safeco challenges the determination of the reasonable hourly rates. The\n\nfee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services is one of the\n\nfactors to be used in determining the proper rate. Mahler, 135 Wn.2d at 433\n\nn.20. Safeco contends the trial court failed to give appropriate consideration to\n\nevidence that the hourly rates claimed by counsel for Miller were higher than\n\nthose customarily charged by attorneys in Skagit County.\n\n       The trial court found that the difficulty of the case made it appropriate for\n\nMiller to be represented by counsel with a high level of specialization:\n\n       It is not appropriate to restrict the hourly rate to the locality of Skagit\n       Valley, as this Court enjoys and benefits from a rich exchange of\n       lawyers from the entire Puget Sound region, and while certain\n       events or cases may be handled largely within a market of this\n       county, this kind of suit and litigation is not so geographically limited\n       but instead requires a much broader degree of talent and\n       specialization. This case required a high level of skill in the\n       specialized area of insurance bad faith, assignments, contract and\n       CPA, as well as a high level of skill in trial preparation and\n       presentation. Few law firms in the Puget Sound region are\n       equipped to take these kinds of cases on behalf of a client.[31]\n\n       Local rates are just one factor in determining the reasonableness of fees\n\nand not always a dispositive factor. Crest Inc. v. Costco Wholesale Corp.. 128\n\n       31 Finding of Fact/Conclusion of Law 11, Clerk's Papers at 5712.\n                                               45\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/46\n\n\n\n\nWn. App. 760, 774, 115 P.3d 349 (2005). The trial court's rationale for approving\n\nhourly rates higher than those customarily charged in Skagit County was\n\ngrounded in the difficulty and novelty of the issues and the specialized skills\n\nrequired, factors mentioned in RPC 1.5(a). In addition, as noted by the trial\n\ncourt, the fees and costs claimed by the opposing party challenging the request\n\nare also appropriate to consider for comparative purposes. See Absher Const.\n\nCo.v. Kent Sen. Dist. No. 415. 79 Wn. App. 841, 847, 917 P.2d 1086 (1995).\n\n\"The Court here was not informed of Safeco's attorney fee bill.\"32\n\n         We find no abuse of discretion in the determination of reasonable hourly\n\nrates.\n\n\n         Safeco contends that the court's determination of the number of hours\n\n\nreasonably expended cannot stand because it is not based on contemporaneous\n\nbilling records. Beninger arrived at 3,229.8 hours by going through the\n\ncorrespondence file and the extensive trial docket after the trial was over and\n\nestimating the time related to each item for each timekeeper.\n\n         To assist the court in determining the hours reasonably expended,\n\nattorneys \"must provide reasonable documentation of the work performed. This\n\ndocumentation need not be exhaustive or in minute detail, but must inform the\n\ncourt, in addition to the number of hours worked, of the type of work performed\n\nand the category of attorney who performed the work (i.e., senior partner,\n\nassociate, etc.).\" Bowers v. Transamerica Title Ins. Co.. 100 Wn.2d 581, 597,\n\n675 P.2d 193 (1983). In Mahler, the court stated that counsel \"must provide\n\n\n         32 Clerk's Papers at 5721.\n                                             46\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/47\n\n\n\n\ncontemporaneous records documenting the hours worked.\" Mahler. 135 Wn.2d\n\nat 434. Safeco contends the lack of contemporaneous time or billing records\n\nmeans that Miller's fee request should have been denied altogether or at least\n\nreduced by a sizable percentage.\n\n       As stated by one of the cases Safeco cites, the \"better practice is to\n\nprepare detailed summaries based on contemporaneous time records.\" Nat'I\n\nAss'n of Concerned Veterans v. Sec'v of Def., 675 F.2d 1319, 1327 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1982). But there is no per se rule, even in the federal courts, that permitting an\n\nattorney to rely upon reconstructed time records is an abuse of discretion. Carter\n\nv.Sedgwick County. Kan.. 929 F.2d 1501, 1506 (10th Cir. 1991).\n\n       The same judge presided over almost every pretrial event as well as the\n\ntrial and posttrial proceedings. Characterizing the presentation of attorney time\n\nas \"conservative,\" the court found that the plaintiff \"omitted billing time spent on\n\ncertain routine, reasonable and necessary matters such as phone calls,\n\ninteroffice communications, developing theories and strategies, and more, and\n\nhas taken reasonable steps to avoid and reduce claims for fees that might\n\ninvolve duplicative, non-productive or wasteful matters.\"33 Our review of the\n\nrecord confirms that the time claimed for particular events during the litigation\n\nwas not inflated. We conclude the reconstruction of hours from the court docket\n\nand the correspondence file was an adequate basis for the determination.\n\n       The total hours an attorney has recorded for work in a case is to be\n\ndiscounted for hours spent on \"unsuccessful claims, duplicated effort, or\n\n\n       33 Clerk's Papers at 5682.\n                                             47\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/48\n\n\n\n\notherwise unproductive time.\" Bowers, 100 Wn.2d at 597. A trial court does not\n\nneed to deduct hours here and there just to prove to the appellate court that it\n\nhas taken an active role in assessing the reasonableness of a fee request.\n\nBerrvman v. Metcalf. 177 Wn. App. 644, 312 P.3d 745 (2013). review denied.\n\n    Wn.2d       (2014). But the court's findings must show how the court\n\nresolved disputed issues of fact and the conclusions must explain the court's\n\nanalysis. Berrvman. 312 P.2d at       .\n\n       Safeco contends the trial court should have segregated the time\n\nassociated with the consumer protection claim, on which fees were recoverable,\n\nfrom the tort claims for bad faith and negligence, on which fees were not\n\nrecoverable. Safeco did not make this argument in its trial brief opposing the\n\nrequest for an attorney fee award. The order awarding attorney fees found that\n\nMiller's several causes of action were interrelated. They all \"involved a common\n\ncore of facts and circumstances, in which the time devoted to discovery, pretrial\n\nmotions and preparation and trial of this intertwined action cannot be reasonably\n\nsegregated (which is one reason this Court previously denied Safeco's motion to\n\nbifurcate the causes of action).\"34 The trial record supports the court's\n\ncharacterization of the interrelatedness of the causes of action. Especially\n\nbecause Safeco made no proposal as to how the time could have been\n\nsegregated, we cannot find that the trial court was obliged to make a\n\nsegregation.\n\n\n\n\n      34 Clerk's Papers at 5712.\n                                            48\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/49\n\n\n\n\n       As a discovery sanction ordered by the trial court on February 15, 2008,\n\nSafeco paid Miller's attorney fees of $43,487.37 incurred in connection with the\n\nuninsured motorist coverage issue.35 Because Miller's request for attorney fees\n\nat the end of the case included 45 hours for work related to UIM coverage,\n\nSafeco contends the same work was billed twice. In response to this contention\n\nbelow, Beninger provided a supplemental declaration in which he explained that\n\nthe payment received from Safeco in 2008 was only for fees incurred in\n\nestablishing, by order of partial summary judgment, that the policy provided UIM\n\ncoverage of $500,000. Whether Safeco committed bad faith when it represented\n\nthat the policy limits were $100,000 was an issue left for trial. Safeco does not\n\nrebut Miller's explanation that these were two separate issues, and we therefore\n\nconclude the claim of double billing is unfounded.\n\n       Safeco contends the court erred by awarding fees for counsel's\n\nunsuccessful efforts. Safeco specifically refers to time spent on a motion\n\nconcerning legal duties that did not result in a jury instruction, researching a\n\ncause of action that was never brought, advocating motions in limine that the\n\ncourt denied, and opposing Safeco's motions in limine that the court granted.\n\nSafeco contends the time spent on these efforts should have been excluded\n\nunder Chuong Van Pham. 159 Wn.2d at 539-40. In Chuong Van Pham. the\n\nSupreme Court affirmed the trial court's decision to reduce the lodestar for time\n\nspent on unsuccessful claims. The case holds that appellate courts will ordinarily\n\ndefer to the trial court's discretion, especially in complex cases. \"The issue\n\n\n       35 Clerk's Papers at 5461-62.\n                                             49\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/50\n\n\n\n\nbefore us is not whether we would have awarded a different amount, but whether\n\nthe trial court abused its discretion.\" Chuong Van Pham. 159 Wn.2d at 540.\n\nHere, unlike in Chuong Van Pham, the trial court made no finding that the efforts\n\nof counsel identified by Safeco were unnecessarily expended, unproductive, or\n\ninsufficiently related to the overall success of the litigation.\n\n       The trial judge is in the best position to determine the proper lodestar\n\namount. Fiore v. PPG Indus.. Inc.. 169 Wn. App. 325, 351, 279 P.3d 972;\n\nMorgan v. Kingen. 141 Wn. App. 143, 163, 169 P.3d 487 (2007). review denied.\n\n175Wn.2d 1027(2012). The trial judge in this case was mindful of his duty\n\nunder Bowers and Mahler to consider the fee request thoughtfully, and he was\n\nwell versed in the legal standards applicable to fee requests. We find no abuse\n\nof discretion in the calculation of the lodestar amount.\n\n       Finally, Safeco challenges the multiplier of 1.5.\n\n       Adjustments to the lodestar product are reserved for \"rare\" occasions.\n\nSanders v. State. 169 Wn.2d 827, 869, 240 P.3d 120 (2010). The lodestar fee is\n\npresumed to adequately compensate an attorney. Fiore. 169 Wn. App. at 355;\n\nChuong Van Pham, 159 Wn.2d at 542. Typically, the quality of work performed\n\nwill not justify an enhancement because \"in virtually every case the quality of the\n\nwork will be reflected in the reasonable hourly rate.\" Bowers, 100 Wn.2d at 599.\n\nSafeco contends that the risk assumed by Miller's attorneys was already\n\naccounted for by the hourly rates approved as part of the lodestar.\n\n       The trial court aptly summarized the risk assumed by Miller's attorneys:\n\n\n\n                                               50\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/51\n\n\n\n\n       This Court is intimately familiar with the details and duration of this\n       marathon case. This case has been ongoing since 2002 and is one\n       of the most complex and difficult civil cases ever undertaken in\n       Skagit County. The case took nearly eight years of litigation, a 14\n       day bifurcated jury trial, two previous trips to the Court of Appeals,\n       70,000 pages of documents, 95 motions, a $25,000 discovery\n       sanction imposed, and 669 entries in the trial court docket. This\n       case was toughJ361\n\n       Since Bowers, a recurring question \"has been whether the business risk\n\ninherent in taking a contingent fee case justifies enhancing the lodestar.\"\n\nBerrvman. 312 P.3d at 758. Here, it did. The trial court appropriately decided\n\nthat this is one of the rare cases in which risk justified a multiplier. The risk was\n\nall or nothing. Eight years was an unusually long time to go without payment,\n\nespecially considering the amount of work the litigation required throughout those\n\neight years. Furthermore, private prosecution of Consumer Protection Act\n\nviolations is backed by public policy. Protecting consumers against the bad faith\n\nof insurance companies fulfills the purpose of the statute that authorizes the fee\n\naward. The litigation vindicated the right of every consumer who pays for liability\n\ninsurance—often a very significant portion of the household budget—to be\n\nprotected from a financial catastrophe. When litigation under the Consumer\n\nProtection Act \"produces protection for everyone who might in the future be\n\ninjured by a specific violation, then it follows that the reasonableness of the\n\nattorney's fee should be governed by substantially more than the import of the\n\ncase to the plaintiff alone.\" Berrvman. 312 P.3d at 762, citing Connelly v. Puget\n\nSound Collections. Inc.. 16 Wn. App. 62, 65, 553 P.2d 1354 (1976).\n\n\n\n       36 Clerk's Papers at 5720.\n                                             51\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/52\n\n\n\n\n       The trial court took the quality of the representation into consideration but\n\nultimately the decision to award a multiplier was based on the significance of the\n\nrisk: \"A lodestar multiplier of 1.5 is appropriate given the contingent\n\nrepresentation and risks this matter presented at the inception and throughout\n\nthe 8 years of non-payment, and the exceptional quality of representation\n\nprovided to the plaintiff by his counsel. Although the verdict was substantial, at\n\nthe time of accepting the case it was of a significant risk and given the quality of\n\nthe representation an upward adjustment is appropriate.\"37\n\n       We find no abuse of discretion in the use of the multiplier to enhance the\n\nfee award.\n\n                                       COSTS\n\n       The trial court granted every litigation expense Miller claimed, for a total\n\naward of $138,433.94 in costs. Safeco contends Miller was not entitled to\n\nrecover expenses beyond statutory costs identified in RCW 4.84.010. We agree.\n\n       Relatively minimal statutory costs are provided for in RCW 4.84.010 (e.g.,\n\nfiling and service fees, witness fees, and expenses of obtaining records that are\n\nadmitted into evidence). The trial court concluded that in a bad faith case, an\n\naward of costs is not limited by RCW 4.84.010 but rather may be expanded to\n\ninclude such items as out-of-pocket expenses for transportation, lodging, and\n\nservices. The court found the costs it awarded were \"reasonable and necessarily\n\n\n\n\n       37 Clerk's Papers at 5713 (Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law).\n                                              52\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/53\n\n\n\n\nincurred for the successful resolution of the bad faith, contract and other\n\nintertwined causes of action.\"38\n\n      The Consumer Protection Act does not authorize an award of costs\n\nbeyond those permitted by RCW 4.84.010. Nordstrom. Inc. v. Tampourlos. 107\n\nWn.2d 735, 743, 733 P.3d 208 (1987). In arguing a bad faith verdict justifies\n\nexpanded costs, Miller relies on Panorama Village Condominium Owners\n\nAssociation Board of Directors v. Allstate Insurance Company. 144Wn.2d 130,\n\n144, 26 P.3d 910 (2001). But in that case, the court allowed broad recovery of\n\ncosts only because the plaintiff had successfully contested a coverage issue, and\n\nthe court found authority for expanded costs in Olympic Steamship Company v.\n\nCentennial Insurance Company, 117Wn.2d37,               811 P.2d 673 (1991).\n\nPanorama Village. 144 Wn.2d at 133 (identifying issue as \"When a plaintiff is\n\nentitled to an award of reasonable attorney fees pursuant to Olympic\n\nSteamship, are costs limited to those expenses enumerated in the cost recovery\n\nstatute?\" (footnote omitted)). The only part of Miller's case that involved Olympic\n\nSteamship was the dispute about whether Peterson's UIM coverage was\n\n$500,000 or $100,000. That issue was resolved early, and Miller has not shown\n\nthat the expenses included in the challenged cost award were attributable to the\n\nresolution of that coverage dispute.\n\n       Miller also cites Griffin v. Allstate Insurance Company. 108 Wn. App. 133,\n\n148, 29 P.3d 777, 36 P.3d 552 (2001). review denied. 146 Wn.2d 1005 (2002).\n\nIn that case, the plaintiffs were sued for damaging their neighbors' property.\n\n\n       38 Clerk's Papers at 5713 (Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law).\n                                              53\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/54\n\n\n\n\nWhen their insurer denied coverage, they had to pay their own defense costs and\n\nan expert on claims handling. In their bad faith case, they claimed these costs as\n\ndamages resulting from breach of the duty to defend—not as attorney fees.\n\nGriffin. 108 Wn. App. at 147. Miller had his opportunity to obtain costs as\n\ndamages pursuant to instruction 30, which identified the types of damages that\n\ncan be awarded for bad faith. Griffin does not authorize deviating from the\n\nstatutory definition for an award of costs included in an award of attorney fees.\n\n       Miller fails to show that any of the expenses included in the cost award of\n\n$138,433.94 are within the definition of costs awardable under RCW 4.84.010.\n\nAccordingly, we conclude it was error to make an award of costs.\n\n                         ATTORNEY FEES ON APPEAL\n\n       We grant Miller's request for attorney fees on appeal under RCW\n\n19.86.090 and, where applicable, under Olympic Steamship.\n\n                        SAFECO'S MOTION TO STRIKE\n\n       Miller's reply brief argued that Safeco did not have \"standing to challenge\n\nthe terms of the validity of the assignment between Kenny and Miler.\" Safeco\n\nhas moved to strike that argument. We deny the motion. The standing argument\n\nis not new, and in any event, we have not had to address it.\n\n                                CONCLUSION\n\n       The order denying a new trial is affirmed.

The accident injured his\n\nthree passengers: Ryan Miller, Ashley Bethards, and Cassandra Peterson. The\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/2\n\n\n\n\nfour teenagers were close friends who had attended Anacortes High School and\n\nwere taking a road trip before starting college at the University of Washington.\n\n       The Passat belonged to Cassandra Peterson. Kenny had permission to\n\ndrive it and was covered for liability under the car insurance policy issued to\n\nPeterson's parents by appellant Safeco Insurance Company. Within days of the\n\naccident, Safeco had information that the injuries were severe. Safeco defended\n\nKenny without a reservation of rights.\n\n       Miller, who had experienced a head injury and was unable to start college\n\nas planned, eventually retained counsel. As a preliminary to initiating settlement\n\ndiscussions, Miller contacted Safeco in October 2001 to inquire about the policy\n\nlimits. Safeco did not divulge the policy limits, claiming that the Petersons had\n\nnot given their permission—a point that would later be disputed at trial. Miller\n\nforced the issue by filing suit against Kenny on December 20, 2001. This made\n\nthe policy limits discoverable.\n\n       In January 2002, Safeco disclosed that the Petersons had liability policy\n\nlimits of $500,000 per person and per accident, and umbrella policy limits of $1\n\nmillion. The policy also had underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage that was\n\npotentially available to the injured passengers. Safeco represented that the limits\n\nof the UIM coverage were only $100,000 due to an alleged prior rejection by\n\nPeterson's mother of UIM limits of $500,000.\n\n       On July 1, 2002, Miller sent Safeco a letter demanding a policy limits\n\nsettlement. The letter called attention to the \"substantial\" risk of an excess\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/3\n\n\n\n\njudgment.1 Peterson had already sent Safeco a settlement demand for\n\n$350,000. Shortly thereafter, Safeco received a demand of $1.25 million from\n\nBethards, who had suffered a head injury.\n\n           On August 29, 2002, Kenny's appointed defense counsel Vickie Norris\n\nwrote to the Safeco adjuster, pointing out that the cumulative settlement\n\ndemands exceeded the policy limits. On behalf of Kenny, Norris demanded that\n\nSafeco tender the policy limits into the registry of the court in exchange for a\n\nrelease and hold harmless from the claimants.2\n\n           Safeco's adjuster responded by letter saying that with the information\n\nreceived so far, \"we do not see the combined value of the injuries in excess of\n\nthe policy limits.\"3 The adjuster tendered to Norris only the $500,000 in liability\n\nlimits.\n\n\n           On November 8, 2002, Norris wrote to the three claimants on behalf of\n\nKenny, tendering to them the $500,000 she had received from Safeco pending\n\nagreement by the claimants on how to divide it. She offered that Kenny would\n\nassign \"any bad faith claims that he may have against Safeco\" in exchange for\n\nthe claimants' agreement not to execute or enforce above all available policy\n\nlimits.4\n\n           The trial date for Miller's suit against Kenny was set for June 2003. In\n\nMarch 2003, Safeco authorized Norris to tender the umbrella policy limits of $1\n\n\n\n           1 Exhibit 125.\n           2 Exhibit 143; Clerk's Papers at 675.\n           3 Clerk's Papers at 676.\n           4 Exhibit 155.\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/4\n\n\n\n\nmillion, to be added to the $500,000 in liability limits, in exchange for a release of\n\nall claims against their insureds.5 This offer came too late. Kenny was facing the\n\nlikelihood of an excess judgment at the upcoming trial. Kenny acted upon advice\n\nfrom Norris and retained attorney Jan Peterson to attempt to negotiate a global\n\nsettlement with the three passengers.\n\n       The settlement agreement was achieved in May 2003.6 Kenny had $1.8\n\nmillion of insurance proceeds available ($300,000 from his parents' State Farm\n\npolicy in addition to the $1.5 million from the Petersons' Safeco policy). Kenny\n\nagreed to pay the $1.8 million to Miller, Bethards, and Peterson, through the\n\nmechanism of a partial judgment if necessary, and to assign to Miller his rights to\n\nsue Safeco for bad faith and related claims or actions. In return, the three\n\nclaimants granted Kenny a covenant not to execute on or enforce any excess\n\njudgment. It was agreed that the full amount of damages for the covenant\n\njudgment would be determined by stipulation or arbitration, contingent upon a\n\nreasonableness finding by the court.\n\n       Safeco intervened after being notified of the settlement agreement. A\n\nreasonableness hearing became unnecessary when Safeco, in May 2005,\n\nstipulated to an order finding that $4.15 million was the reasonable total net\n\namount for the stipulated covenant judgments.7 This was the amount of\n\ndamages that remained unpaid after the three passengers received the $1.8\n\nmillion in insurance proceeds. All parties to the stipulated order agreed to treat\n\n\n       5 Clerk's Papers at 5896.\n       6 Exhibit 1; Clerk's Papers at 5828-5838.\n       7 Exhibit 15.\n                                               4\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/5\n\n\n\n\nthe remaining $4.15 million as ifjudgment in that amount had been entered\n\nagainst Kenny. The order allocated the damages as follows:\n\n       Claimant               Gross Amount                  Net Amount\n       Miller                 $3,450,000                    $2,575,000\n       Bethards               $2,100,000                    $1,425,000\n       Peterson               $ 400,000                     $ 150,000™\n\n       Safeco's stipulation reserved its defenses in future litigation. Thus, the\n\nstage was set for bad faith litigation. Miller dropped his claims against Kenny.\n\nAs Kenny's assignee, he amended his complaint to allege bad faith against\n\nSafeco, as well as negligence, consumer protection violations, breach of\n\ncontract, and other theories. Miller alleged that Safeco had damaged Kenny by\n\nrefusing to disclose the liability policy limits, thereby forcing the initiation of\n\nMiller's lawsuit against Kenny, and by its subsequent actions in handling the\n\ncase. Miller also sued as the assignee of Cassandra Peterson's claim that\n\nSafeco committed bad faith when it represented that her parents' policy provided\n\nonly $100,000 in UIM coverage for the Passat instead of $500,000.\n\n       Years of litigation followed. Miller's major theme was that Safeco could have\n\nprotected Kenny from exposure to an excess judgment by promoting a policy limits\n\nsettlement much earlier. Safeco's principal defense was that it never had a genuine\n\nopportunity to settle the case because there were three claimants, and Miller\n\nunreasonably and intransigently demanded all the policy limits for himself. This dispute\n\nabout who was to blame for the lack of settlement continued to the last witness on the\n\nlast day of trial, a Safeco adjuster whose deposition was presented in Miller's rebuttal\n\n\n        Exhibit 15; Clerk's Papers at 5898.\n\n                                                5\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/6\n\n\n\n\ncase. The adjuster admitted that Safeco's failure to offer $1.5 million in August 2002\n\nwas not due to the position taken by the lawyers, but rather was due to Safeco's\n\nassessment at the time that the three claims did not approach $1.5 million in value.\n\n      Safeco erected a secondary line of defense upon the terms of the settlement\n\nagreement. Safeco argued that Kenny had failed to make a valid assignment of his\n\nright to sue Safeco for bad faith. In the 2003 agreement with his passengers, Kenny\n\nassigned to Miller \"all rights, privileges, claims and causes of action that he may have\"\n\nagainst Safeco. At the same time, Kenny reserved to himself certain \"claims for\n\ndamages.\"\n\n       c.      Reservation: Defendant Kenny hereby reserves to himself\n               claims for damages for his personal emotional distress,\n               personal attorneys' fees, personal damages to his credit or\n               reputation and other non-economic damages which arise\n               from the assigned causes of action.'9]\n\nSafeco argued that because of Kenny's reservation of his \"claims\" for personal\n\ndamages, Miller as Kenny's assignee could not prove harm, an essential element\n\nin a bad faith case. On December 22, 2008, Safeco moved for dismissal on\n\nsummary judgment on this basis.\n\n       The trial court denied the motion for summary judgment. This court took\n\ndiscretionary review and decided that summary judgment was properly denied\n\nbecause what Miller and Kenny intended by the assignment and reservation\n\nprovisions of the agreement depended on the resolution of disputed extrinsic\n\nevidence.

The trial court granted the motion. The jury would proceed to decide\n\nSafeco's liability for bad faith only ifthe jury determined in the first phase that the\n\nMay 2003 settlement agreement was intended to permit Miller to recover Kenny's\n\ndamages caused by Safeco's alleged bad faith.\n\n       The first phase of trial began November 30, 2011. It was concerned solely\n\nwith contract interpretation. Safeco's factual position was that the agreement\n\nreserved to Kenny the right to pursue damages. Safeco's legal theory was that if\n\nthe jury found Kenny retained that right for himself, then the assignment was\n\ninvalid because it was incomplete. Miller's position was that the agreement\n\nretained for Kenny only an interest in any damages Miller recovered and that\n\nMiller alone had the right to pursue Kenny's damages in a lawsuit against\n\nSafeco.\n\n       The question posed to the jury was \"Who gets to pursue Kenny's claims\n\nfor personal emotional distress, attorneys' fees, personal damage to credit and\n\nreputation, and other non-economic damage?\" The verdict form gave the jury\n\nthree possible ways to answer the question: Kenny, Miller, or both. The jury\n\nchecked \"Miller\" in their verdict on December 2, 2011.10 This verdict cleared the\n\nway for the second phase of the trial, Safeco's alleged liability for dealing with\n\nKenny in bad faith.\n\n       The second phase of the trial began on December 5, 2011, before the\n\n\n\n\n       10 Clerk's Papers at 5702 (verdict); Report of Proceedings (Dec. 2, 2011) at 110-11.\n                                               7\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/8\n\n\n\n\nsame jury. The trial court gave the jury 31 instructions.11 Instruction 8 explained\n\nthe significance of the verdict in the first phase of trial:\n\n               As a consequence of the first trial, Plaintiff Ryan Miller is the\n       assignee of the rights, claims and causes of action of Patrick Kenny\n       and Cassandra Peterson against Safeco.\n               An assignee steps into the shoes of the assignor and has all\n       of the rights of the assignors. The assignee's cause of action is\n       direct, not derivative. The assignee may sue in his or her own\n       name, and may speak in the place of the assignors.\n               As a result, Ryan Miller is the real party in interest and has\n       the exclusive right to recover all damages related to the assigned\n       causes of action. Who he has agreed to share those damages\n       with, and in what amounts, is not material to his right to recovery.1121\n\nThe jury was instructed on bad faith, negligence, breach of contract, and\n\nconsumer protection. Instruction 25 set forth standards pertinent to the central\n\nclaim of bad faith:\n\n               The duty of good faith requires an insurer to:\n               (1) Perform a reasonable investigation and evaluation of a\n       claim against its insured;\n               (2) If its investigation discloses a reasonable likelihood that\n       its insured may be liable, make a good faith effort to settle the\n       claim. This includes an obligation at least to conduct good faith\n       settlement negotiations sufficient to ascertain the most favorable\n       terms available and make an informed evaluation of the settlement\n       demand;\n               (3) Evaluate settlement offers as though it bore the entire\n       risk, including the risk of any judgment in excess of the policy limits;\n               (4) Timely communicate its investigations and evaluations,\n       and any settlement offers, to its insured; and\n               (5) If the settlement demand exceeds the insurer's policy\n       limits, communicate the offer to its insured, ascertain whether the\n       insured is willing to make the necessary contribution to the\n       settlement amount, and exercise good faith in deciding whether to\n       pay its own limits.\n              An insurer who fails to fulfill any of these duties falls to act in\n       good faith.\n\n\n       11 Clerk's Papers at 5373-5409.\n       12 Clerk's Papers at 5383.\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/9\n\n\n\n\n        On December 16, the jury returned a plaintiff's verdict of $13 million.13 Of\n\nthis award, $11.9 million was on the assignment from Kenny and $1.1 million was\n\non the assignment from Peterson.14\n\n        The judgments ultimately entered by the court against Safeco added\n\nprejudgment interest of more than $7 million, postjudgment interest at 12\n\npercent, $1.7 million in attorney fees and costs, and treble damages under the\n\nConsumer Protection Act, chapter 19.86 RCW. The total was $21,837,286.73.\n\n                 INTERPRETATION OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT\n\n        In the first phase of the trial, the jury's verdict determined that the 2003\n\nsettlement agreement authorized Miller, and only Miller, to carry on the litigation against\n\nSafeco for Kenny's damages personal to himself. Safeco contends the trial court\n\ncommitted reversible error by allowing the jury to hear evidence of the subjective intent\n\nof the parties to the agreement.\n\n        Safeco's argument implicates the context rule of contract interpretation.

It began with opening statements on the\n\nafternoon of November 30, 2011. Most of the evidence came in through Miller's first\n\nwitness, attorney Jan Peterson, who represented Kenny in the negotiations that\n\nproduced the settlement agreement. Peterson was the drafter of the agreement.\n\n       On direct examination, Peterson described Kenny's situation in the spring of\n\n2003 as the trial of Miller's personal injury suit drew near. Peterson testified that\n\nbecause of Safeco's failure to seek out an early settlement, Kenny faced the likelihood\n\nof an excess judgment at the upcoming trial. He also testified that one of Safeco's\n\nattorneys had threatened to withdraw Kenny's coverage if Kenny assigned his bad faith\n\nclaims to Miller.\n\n       Peterson was asked what he intended in drafting certain parts of the settlement\n\nagreement, including the assignment and reservation provisions. Safeco objected that\n\n\"personal intentions are irrelevant.\" The trial court ruled that \"Mr. Peterson can testify\n\nas to what he did and why he did it.\" Peterson answered that the purpose of the\n\nagreement was to protect Kenny from excess judgments and to preserve to Kenny \"the\n\noptions of recovering damages, personal to him.\" He testified without objection that the\n                                             10\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/11\n\n\n\n\nstructure of the agreement reflected the intent that Miller—not Kenny—would go forward\n\nwith the assigned causes of action against Safeco.\n\n       Peterson was asked what he \"meant for this document to speak\" when he drafted\n\nthe assignment and reservation provisions. This time, Safeco objected that Peterson's\n\npersonal intentions were irrelevant unless they were communicated to Safeco. The trial\n\ncourt properly overruled the objection. As the testimony showed, Safeco was not a\n\nparty to the agreement and had not been involved in negotiating it. The admissibility of\n\na drafter's testimony does not depend upon communication with an entity not a party to\n\nthe negotiations. Peterson answered that the assignment meant Miller had the right to\n\nbring the bad faith action, and Kenny did not have an obligation to bring a separate bad\n\nfaith action.\n\n       On cross-examination, Safeco tried to elicit Peterson's agreement that the\n\nreservation clause meant Kenny had reserved the right to pursue his causes of action\n\nagainst Safeco. Peterson's answers distinguished between the causes of action, which\n\nhe said Kenny had assigned, and the claims for damages, which he said Kenny had\n\nreserved. This distinction went to the ultimate issue the jury was being asked to decide.\n\nOn redirect, Peterson repeated it without objection.\n\n       At the end of redirect, Peterson was asked to state his purpose in drafting the\n\nagreement. Was his purpose to allow Miller and Kenny to pursue the bad faith action\n\ntogether and share the recovery, or was it to allow each of them to pursue the bad faith\n\nclaim independently at double the expense? Safeco objected: \"The witness can't\n\ntestify to his subjective purpose or intent. The document speaks for itself.\" The court\n\nruled that Peterson \"may testify as to what his intent was when he drafted the\n                                            11\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/12\n\n\n\n\ndocument.\" Peterson answered that having Miller and Kenny each pursuing a bad faith\n\naction independently was \"not what we wanted for Mr. Kenny.\"\n\n       After Peterson, Miller and Kenny testified briefly. The trial court sustained\n\nSafeco's objection when Kenny was asked about his intent. However, over objection,\n\nthe court permitted Kenny to answer a question about \"what [he] expected to occur with\n\nthe settlement agreement.\" Kenny answered, \"My expectation was that Iwas assigning\n\na cause of action to Ryan Miller. After assigning that cause of action, if it was found that\n\nSafeco had acted in bad faith towards me, I would still be entitled to claim a portion of\n\nthose damages.\" A similar question was asked soon after, and again the court\n\noverruled Safeco's objection:\n\n             Q. Has there ever been any question in your mind as to the fact\n      that, with the assignment that you provided, that Ryan Miller was entitled\n      to have the right to sue Safeco in your behalf and recover all the damages\n      and share those with you ifthere is a recovery?\n             [Kenny:] No doubt.\n                [Safeco]: Objection.\n                 THE COURT: Overruled.\n\n      The closing arguments reiterated the themes that emerged from Peterson's\n\ntestimony. Miller emphasized the assignment language. He argued that the agreement\n\nmade sense only if it was he, not Kenny, who had the right to pursue for both of them\n\nthe personal damages that arose from the assigned causes of action. Safeco\n\nemphasized the reservation clause: Did Kenny assign everything or did he reserve\n\ncertain damages unto himself? \"If he reserved unto himself certain damages, it cannot\n\nbe proved that Patrick Kenny assigned all.\"\n\n      The jury's verdict sided with Miller. The jury determined that Miller, and only\n\nMiller, was entitled to pursue Kenny's claims for personal damage.\n                                            12\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/13\n\n\n\n\n       On appeal, Safeco contends that Peterson and Kenny both provided evidence of\n\nsubjective intent that should have been excluded under Hollis.\n\n       The line between permissible evidence of context and impermissible evidence of\n\nsubjective intent is not bright. Under Hollis, evidence of a party's unilateral or subjective\n\nintent as to the meaning of a contract word or term is inadmissible. Hollis, 137 Wn.2d at\n\n695. We have held that extrinsic evidence is admissible to show the intent of a drafter\n\nso long as it is not used to change the terms of an agreement. Saunders v.

App. at 47-48.\n\n       Although Peterson drafted the agreement and was not himself a party, some of\n\nSafeco's objections to questions asked of Peterson arguably could have been sustained\n\nunder Ross. Yet Safeco allowed similar questions to go by without objection, and\n\nSafeco itself asked Peterson questions about what the agreement meant. We therefore\n\ndecline to go through each ruling the trial court made and decide which ones, if any,\n\nwere in error. \"Admission of testimony that is otherwise excludable is not prejudicial\n\nerror where similar testimony was admitted earlier without objection.\" Ashley v.

Their competing\n\ninterpretations were both rooted in the written words of the agreement. Both parties\n\nproperly focused on the key words of the agreement—\"assignment,\" \"reservation,\"\n\n\"claim,\" and \"cause of action.\" Miller did not ask the jury to interpret the agreement as\n\nincluding words not found in it.

This argument fails because it\n\nassumes the result. This court's previous decision on discretionary review determined\n\nthat the agreement had an ambiguity because Kenny assigned his causes of action and\n\nat the same time reserved claims for damages to himself. Thus, the reservation\n\nprovision did not have an unambiguous meaning that Kenny's testimony could\n\ncontradict. The point of the phase one trial was to find out what the reservation\n\nprovision meant.\n\n       To the extent that testimony about intention and purpose was improperly\n\nadmitted, we reject Safeco's argument that the error was prejudicial.

His testimony was a tutorial on the\n\npressures faced by an insured defendant when he has caused damage exceeding his\n\npolicy limits and his insurer refuses to tender policy limits. Peterson's answers were\n\ntypically more circumspect than the sometimes leading questions posed to him on direct\n\nand cross. Virtually everything he said was clearly admissible and highly relevant\n\nextrinsic evidence about the circumstances leading up to the agreement, the context in\n\nwhich the parties signed it, and their subsequent acts and conduct.\n\n       The interpretation proposed by Safeco was strained: that despite the assignment\n\nlanguage, Kenny had reserved the right to bring his own bad faith suit against Safeco.\n\nThe difficulty with Safeco's position was noted by this court on discretionary review:\n\n\"Safeco's reading fails to harmonize the assignment and reservation provisions. It is\n\nneither logical nor reasonable that the parties would intend to assign 'all rights,\n\nprivileges, claims and causes of action,' including the bad faith claim, and then defeat\n\nthe assignment's purpose by retaining an essential element of the bad faith cause of\n\naction in the reservation provision.\" Miller, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4923873</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 6.\n\n       The reservation by Kenny of his \"claims for damages .. . which arise from the\n\nassigned causes of action\" was an unusual feature of the agreement, one we have not\n\nseen in similar cases. It is not surprising that Safeco challenged it. But it is also not\n\nsurprising that the jury gave the agreement a realistic interpretation that would serve the\n\ninterests of both Miller and Kenny given the situation they were in.

Given the solidity of\n\nPeterson's testimony and the scarcity of countervailing evidence, we do not see a\n\nreasonable possibility that the outcome of the trial's first phase would have been\n\ndifferent ifthe specific excerpts challenged by Safeco had been excluded.\n\n       Safeco raises a related claim of instructional error in phase one. The trial court\n\ngave instruction 5, a pattern instruction on contract interpretation.

As modified and proposed by Safeco, it read as follows:\n\n\n\n\n                                              16\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/17\n\n\n\n\n              If you find that all of the provisions of an agreement between Ryan\n      Miller and Patrick Kenny are contained in the Settlement Agreement and\n      Assignment of Rights, Judgment and Covenant (\"the Settlement\n      Agreement\"), and that the Settlement Agreement was intended by all\n      parties as their final agreement on the subjects addressed in it, then you\n      may not consider evidence outside the written document to add to,\n      subtract from, vary, or contradict that written document unless you also\n      find that terms were included in the document as a result of fraud or\n       mutual mistake.\n              However, if you find that such written document was not intended to\n       be a complete expression of all of the terms agreed upon by those parties,\n       that is, that the document does not contain all of the terms of their\n       agreement, then you may also consider evidence of the circumstances\n       surrounding the making of the agreement to supply additional terms of the\n       agreement between the parties, but only if they are not inconsistent with\n       the provisions of the written document.\n\n       An appellate court reviews de novo alleged errors in a trial court's instructions to\n\nthe jury.

But as discussed above, extrinsic evidence was not admitted to contradict\n\nthe terms of the settlement agreement. Safeco has not shown that it was prejudiced by\n\nthe court's failure to give the proposed instruction.

Besel, 146 Wn.2d at 482. The\n\nSupreme Court granted Besel's petition for review and reversed and remanded\n\nfor entry of judgment reflecting the stipulated judgment amount of $175,000. The\n\ncourt held that the amount of a covenant judgment, when found to be\n\nreasonable, is the \"presumptive measure of the insured's harm\":\n\n              We hold the amount of a covenant judgment is the\n       presumptive measure of an insured's harm caused by an insurer's\n       tortious bad faith if the covenant judgment is reasonable under the\n       Chaussee criteria.

Furthermore, using the amount of\n       a covenant judgment to measure tort damages in this context\n       makes sense in light of our long-standing requirement that such\n                                              21\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/22\n\n\n\n\n      settlements be reasonable. If a reasonable and good faith\n      settlement amount of a covenant judgment does not measure an\n      insured's harm, our requirements that such settlements be\n      reasonable is meaningless. Finally, the Chaussee criteria protect\n      insurers from excessive judgments especially where, as here, the\n      insurer has notice of the reasonableness hearing and has an\n      opportunity to argue against the settlement's reasonableness.\n\nBesel, 146 Wn.2d at 738-39.\n\n      According to Safeco, where Besel says the amount of a covenant\n\njudgment is \"the presumptive measure of an insured's harm,\" it means that the\n\ninsured's damages for the tort of bad faith are limited to the amount of damages\n\nthe insured caused to the third party, as measured by the covenant judgment.\n\nAs we read Besel, however, the reference to the \"presumptive\" measure of harm\n\nis not a limitation. It does not appear that Besel claimed Viking's bad faith\n\nconduct caused the driver any damages other than liability for the judgment, so\n\nthere was no reason for the court to announce a rule barring Besel, as the\n\ndriver's assignee, from recovering additional damages personal to the driver.\n\nWhen Besel is read in context with the Court of Appeals decision that it reversed,\n\nthe proper interpretation of the above-quoted paragraph is that harm to the\n\ninsured is presumptively worth at least the amount of the covenant judgment—\n\nnot less. The Supreme Court implicitly confirmed this interpretation by explaining\n\nin a recent case that \"in the insurance setting, the presumptive amount is added\n\nto any other damages found by the jury.\" Bird v.

The holding of Bird is\n\nthat a reasonableness hearing is an equitable procedure. The court stated,\n\n\"Here, there is no factual determination to be made on damages in the later bad\n                                            22\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/23\n\n\n\n\nfaith claim, at least not with respect to the covenant judgment.\" Bird, 175 Wn.2d\n\nat 772 (emphasis added). This sentence indicates the way is open for a jury to\n\nmake a factual determination of an insured's bad faith damages other than and in\n\naddition to the covenant judgment.\n\n       Safeco proposes that \"an insured should be put to an election. It must\n\neither prove all of its damages or it may choose to confine any bad faith recovery\n\nto the covenant judgment settlement amount. As a matter of law, it should not be\n\nable to recover both.\"19 As authority, Safeco cites only former Justice James\n\nDolliver's dissent in Butler. Justice Dolliver's concerns did not persuade the\n\nmajority in Butler, nor did they prevail when considered again in Mutual of\n\nEnumclaw Insurance Company, 161 Wn.2d at 921.\n\n       Where the insured has caused damages clearly exceeding policy limits,\n\nan insurer's failure to offer policy limits exposes the insured to the risk of an\n\nexcess judgment. Once it is determined that the insurer acted in bad faith by\n\nfailing to settle, typically the chief component of the insured's damage caused by\n\nthat failure will be the insured's liability to the third party. This component is\n\nmeasured by the amount of the third party's covenant judgment against the\n\ninsured. However, the insured's damages may include as an additional\n\ncomponent the damages caused to him by the insurer's bad faith. Examples\n\ninclude the potential effect on the insured's credit rating, damage to reputation,\n\nloss of business opportunities, and loss of control of the case. Butler, 118 Wn.2d\n\nat 399, 392.

In January\n\n1997, Cassandra Peterson's mother signed a written partial waiver, selecting\n\nUIM limits of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident. In April 1997, she\n\nagain signed the waiver selecting the lower limits.\n\n       In November 1999, the Petersons added Cassandra's Volkswagen Passat\n\nto their American States policy. The UIM limits for the Passat alone were set at\n\n$500,000, equal to the liability limits. The declarations page notes that \"this\n\nendorsement reflects the addition of the 1994 Volkswagen Passat eff. 11/3/99.\"\n\nSafeco charged $42.00 for the UIM coverage on the Passat and $24.80 apiece\n\nfor two other vehicles.

In early 2000, Safeco issued\n\nthe Petersons the policy that was in effect in August 2000 when the Passat,\n\ndriven by Kenny, rear-ended the cement truck. The policy listed the UIM limits\n\nfor all three vehicles as $100,000/$300,000 effective April 20, 2000.

The choice you made has been reflected on\n       this replacement policy. Other limits and prices are available.\n\nSafeco did not include a written waiver for the Petersons to sign.

In order\n\nto keep her premiums low, Donna Ensley signed a waiver to lower her UIM\n\ncoverage from $500,000 to $50,000. Later, she cancelled the collision coverage\n\non one of her vehicles. The insurer mistakenly cancelled all coverage on that\n\nvehicle. Ensley pointed out the mistake, and the insurer corrected it by\n\nreinstating coverage on that vehicle other than collision. The insurer also\n                                            27\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/28\n\n\n\n\ngranted Ensley's request for a higher deductible. When Ensley's son was\n\nseriously injured while riding as a passenger in another of Ensley's vehicles,\n\nEnsley claimed that the changes made to the policy after her first waiver were\n\nmaterial and the reduction of UIM coverage to $50,000 was ineffective because\n\nthe insurer did not obtain a second written waiver. This court held that these\n\nchanges did not result in a new policy because the UIM coverage level did not\n\nchange after the first written waiver. Ensley, 153 Wn. App. at 41-42.\n\n       Safeco suggests that the policy issued to the Petersons in 2000 was\n\nsimply the correction of an earlier mistake, and like the correction of the mistake\n\nin Ensley. it did not create a new policy. This argument fails. The insurer's\n\nmistake in Ensley was not material and did not create a new policy, most\n\nimportantly because it did not affect the level of Ensley's UIM coverage. Ensley,\n\n153 Wn. App. at 42. Therefore, Ensley's written waiver remained effective.\n\n       Here, the Petersons paid an extra premium for UIM coverage of $500,000\n\non their daughter's Passat in 1999. Whether this happened because they\n\nrequested it or because of a scrivener's error is immaterial; the essential fact is\n\nthat the Petersons paid to have limits of $500,000. The Safeco policy issued in\n\n2000 reduced the UIM coverage on the Passat from $500,000 to $100,000.\n\nUnder Johnson and Torgerson, that reduction was a material change that\n\ncreated a new policy.\n\n      The insurer has the burden of obtaining a knowing written rejection in\n\norder to avoid the statutory requirement for UIM coverage. Clements, 121 Wn.2d\n\nat 255. Safeco did not obtain a knowing written rejection when it issued the\n                                             28\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/29\n\n\n\n\npolicy in 2000 with limits reduced back down from $500,000 to $100,000. The\n\ntrial court correctly determined that because Safeco did not obtain a written\n\nwaiver, the UIM limits were equal to the liability limits of $500,000.\n\n       The trial court did not decide that Safeco's investigation and disclosure of\n\nthe UIM limits was bad faith as a matter of law. The court ruled that material\n\nissues of fact remained as to whether Safeco reasonably believed the reduced\n\nUIM limits in the 2000 policy simply corrected a scrivener's error. The phase two\n\nverdict specifically determined that Safeco failed to act in good faith with respect\n\nto Peterson's UIM claim and thereby caused damage to her of $350,000. We\n\nfind no error in the court's decision to permit this issue to go to the jury.\n\n                  ATTEMPT TO DEPOSE MILLER'S ATTORNEY\n\n       The introduction to Safeco's brief on appeal accuses Miller's attorney,\n\nRalph Brindley, of frustrating Safeco's reasonable efforts at settlement in a\n\ndeliberate attempt to set up a bad faith claim:\n\n                This case demonstrates how an insurer can be \"set up\" for a\n       bad faith claim. Too often, attorneys for claimants are not\n       interested in actually settling their clients' claims when they believe\n       that the applicable liability insurance limits are low compared to the\n       severity of the injuries at issue. Instead, they readily frustrate\n       settlement efforts, looking to trap the insurer in the handling of the\n       claim by manipulating events to set up the insurer for a bad faith\n       action by the insured, an action their clients receive by assignment\n       in the course of negotiating an inflated covenant judgment\n       settlement. That is precisely what happened here.\n                The insurer, in this case, Safeco Insurance Company of\n       Illinois (\"Safeco\"), was blamed for the lack of a settlement in the\n       underlying case between driver/insured Patrick Kenny and his\n       passengers, Ryan Miller, Ashley Bethards, and Cassandra\n       Peterson. Safeco made a concerted effort to eliminate Kenny's\n       exposure. But Safeco was faced with paying all liability insurance\n       to one of three injured claimants thereby leaving its insured with no\n                                              29\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/30\n\n\n\n\n       coverage for the remaining two claims, or declining to pay the full\n       limit to one of the three. It opted for the latter and was sued in bad\n      faith for the failure to settle.\n               Settlement was frustrated at every turn by Ralph Brindley,\n       Miller's lawyer. The trial court, however, refused to allow any\n       discovery regarding Brindley's role in frustrating Safeco's\n       settlement efforts on Miller's behalf and setting up Safeco for a bad\n      faith action.1211\n\nSafeco claims that Brindley made unreasonable settlement demands, rebuffed\n\nSafeco's attempts to facilitate mediation, and manipulated the other claimants\n\nand their attorneys into signing the settlement agreement, all in order to put Miller\n\nin the driver's seat for what turned out to be a lucrative bad faith claim. The issue\n\non appeal is whether the trial court unfairly prevented Safeco from questioning\n\nBrindley about his strategy.\n\n       In February 2007, Safeco sent Brindley a notice of deposition and a\n\nsubpoena duces tecum for his correspondence, memorializations of\n\nconversations, and other documents in the underlying Miller v. Kenny litigation.\n\nAs the defendant in the bad faith action, Safeco wanted to question Brindley\n\nabout the rationale behind his negotiation tactics, his understanding of the\n\nprovision of the settlement in which Kenny reserved his claims for personal\n\ndamages, and his motive for bringing Miller's suit against Kenny. On April 23,\n\n2007, Miller moved to quash on the basis of attorney-client privilege and asked\n\nthe court to enter a protective order precluding further deposition and discovery\n\nrequests.\n\n       The trial court considered Safeco's request to depose Brindley under the\n\n\n\n       21 Brief of Appellant Safeco at 1-2.\n                                              30\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/31\n\n\n\n\nthree-part test outlined in Shelton v.

Kenny action was relevant to the bad faith action against\nSafeco, Safeco had not shown the information it was seeking was unprivileged.\n\nSafeco then argued that if Brindley could not be deposed, the court should not\n\npermit Miller to call him as a witness at trial.\n\n       The trial court granted Miller's motion to quash in March 2008. Later, the\n\ncourt ruled that Miller would not be able to call Brindley as a witness at trial\n\nwithout giving at least 60 days' notice, and if that occurred, Safeco would be\n\npermitted to renew its request for a deposition.\n\n       As the trial was about to begin in November 2011, Miller added Brindley to\n\nhis witness list. Safeco objected, and the court granted Safeco's motion to\n\nexclude Brindley. Brindley did not testify.\n\n       Safeco contends the order granting Miller's motion to quash was\n\nprejudicial error warranting a new trial.

If so, a\n\nblanket assertion of attorney-client privilege is not a sufficient basis to resist a\n\nnotice of deposition. See, e.g., Meritplan Ins. Co. v. Superior Court. 124 Cal.\n\nApp. 3d 237, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">236</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 237 (1981). However, Meritplan and similar\n\ncases have not established a per se rule that a deposition of plaintiff's counsel in\n\nthe underlying case must always be allowed in a bad faith case.\n\n       The trial court in this case did not accept a blanket assertion of attorney-\n\nclient privilege. Relying on Shelton. the court required Safeco to demonstrate\n\nthat the specific information sought by Safeco was nonprivileged. Although\n\nShelton has not been formally adopted in Washington, it is a leading case, and it\n\nis not inconsistent with Meritplan. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by\n\nlooking to Shelton for guidance.\n\n       Applying the Shelton test, the trial court concluded that Safeco had failed\n\nto establish that the information it would be seeking from Brindley was\n\nnonprivileged. The record supports this conclusion. What Meritplan refers to as\n\nrelevant information that may be most efficiently obtained through deposition is\n\n\"the circumstances and content of the various negotiations and communications\n\nbetween the involved individuals.\" Meritplan. 124 Cal. App. 3d at 241. This is\n\nnot the type of information Safeco wanted from Brindley. Safeco wanted to ask\n\nBrindley about matters that are covered by the attorney-client privilege and the\n\nwork product privilege, including Brindley's strategy in refusing mediation and\n                                              32\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/33\n\n\n\n\nwhy he demanded the entire policy limits for Miller. For example, counsel for\n\nSafeco told the trial court, \"I want to know whether he was posturing in making a\n\nsettlement demand or not.\"22\n\n      And Safeco does not persuasively show that being deprived of the\n\nopportunity to depose Brindley was prejudicial. Safeco did take the depositions\n\nof John Barlow and Monte Wolff, the attorneys who, respectively, represented\n\nBethards and Peterson during the time period leading up to the settlement\n\nagreement. Safeco did not use their depositions at trial. Presumably, this was\n\nbecause their testimony, while mildly critical of Brindley's aggressiveness, was\n\nmore pointedly critical of Safeco for waiting so long to tender policy limits. The\n\nsame type of testimony coming from Brindley would not have been helpful to\n\nSafeco.\n\n       Safeco's rhetorical complaint that the bad faith litigation was a setup\n\nengineered by Brindley was not successful with the jury, and as a legal argument\n\nit is equally unsuccessful. Pressing for a policy limits settlement for a badly\n\ninjured client is a professional responsibility, not a sinister plot. Keeping bad faith\n\nlitigation in mind as plan B ifthe insurer balks is a fair practice. Safeco could\n\nhave protected itself by putting the limits on the table for all three passengers.\n\n       Safeco refers to the covenant judgment of $4.15 million as \"inflated.\" But\n\nSafeco itself stipulated to that amount as a reasonable measure of the damages\n\nincurred by Kenny's three passengers over and above the $1.8 million in policy\n\n\n\n       22 Report of Proceedings (July 20, 2007) at 6.\n\n                                               33\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/34\n\n\n\n\nproceeds already tendered. The legal requirement of a reasonableness hearing\n\nis there to protect insurers from inflated covenant judgments resulting from\n\ncollusion and fraud. See, e.g.. Water's Edge Homeowners Ass'n v.

There was no evidence of collusion or fraud around the\n\nsettlement in this case. The claimants had serious injuries and were not at fault.\n\nSafeco, after resisting early demands for settlement on the basis that the three\n\nclaims together did not approach the policy limits of $1.5 million, eventually\n\nstipulated that the total injuries exceeded policy limits by $4.15 million. It is hard\n\nto see how deposing Brindley could have helped Safeco put its delay in\n\ndisclosing and offering policy limits into a more favorable light.\n\n       Under these circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by\n\nputting Brindley's deposition off limits unless Miller waived the privilege by calling\n\nBrindley as a witness at trial.\n\n       We conclude the order quashing the subpoena for Ralph Brindley did not\n\nconstitute prejudicial error justifying a new trial.\n\n                         EVIDENCE OF LOSS RESERVES\n\n       Soon after the accident, Safeco was aware that Kenny, its insured, was\n\nmost likely 100 percent at fault for his passengers' serious injuries. Safeco set its\n\nreserve for liability at $1.5 million, a figure that included the umbrella policy limits\n\nas well as the liability limits in the regular policy. The UIM reserve was $100,000.\n\nAs part of its ongoing responsibility to stay informed about Kenny's exposure,\n\nSafeco reviewed its reserves approximately 20 times over the next 30 months.\n                                               34\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/35\n\n\n\n\nEach time, Safeco concluded that Kenny was exposed to liability substantially in\n\nexcess of policy limits.\n\n       Safeco moved in limine to exclude this evidence as irrelevant or more\n\nprejudicial than probative.

Stephen S. Ashley, Bad Faith Actions: Liability\n\nand Damages § 10:31 (1997). In this case, however, the discrepancy between\n\nSafeco's loss reserves and its settlement posture was enduring and sizable. We\n\nconclude the relevance was high enough to overcome the policy concern. The\n\ndecision to admit the evidence was within the trial court's discretion.\n\n                        DEPOSITION OF MARYLE TRACY\n\n       Safeco contends the trial court committed reversible error by allowing the\n\njury to view the videotaped deposition of Maryle Tracy, a Safeco claims analyst.\n\nTracy was briefly involved in the case during the time Kenny was considering\n\nassigning his rights and stipulating to judgment. In the deposition, Tracy was\n\nquestioned by Miller about incentive programs for Safeco's employees that linked\n\nbonuses to cost control. Tracy's answers were evasive, and the trial judge later\n\nremarked that Tracy \"was not a good witness for Safeco.\"23\n\n       Miller confronted Tracy with interrogatory answers she had provided on\n\n\n       23 Report of Proceedings (Apr. 16, 2012) at 42.\n                                              36\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/37\n\n\n\n\nbehalf of Safeco in 2004 in a case in South Dakota. Tracy had initially denied\n\nthat Safeco had programs rewarding its employees for keeping costs down, but\n\nshe later amended her answers to admit that such programs did exist.24\n\n       Safeco contends the deposition should have been excluded because it\n\nwas irrelevant, unduly prejudicial, and involved impeachment on a collateral\n\nmatter.\n\n\n       Safeco's bonus and incentive programs were admissible to show that\n\nSafeco, at relevant times, was rewarding its adjusters financially for clamping\n\ndown on coverage and defense costs. The existence of these programs and the\n\naction by a claims analyst to conceal them supplied evidence of Safeco's motive\n\nto avoid settling for policy limits. The deposition thus was relevant to the bad\n\nfaith claim and not unduly prejudicial.\n\n          Safeco did not object below on the basis that evidence of Tracy amending\n\nher answers in the South Dakota case was impeachment on a collateral matter.\n\nThat objection is not preserved, and we decline to address it.\n\n          We find no abuse of discretion in the decision to admit Tracy's deposition.\n\n                               ATTORNEY MISCONDUCT\n\nLeading Questions\n\n          David Beninger, Brindley's partner, represented Miller at trial.

Below, Safeco argued that\n\nprejudgment interest was already encompassed by instruction 30, which allowed\n\nthe jury to award, as damages, \"Lost or diminished assets or property, including\n\nvalue of money.\" Safeco also argued below that if the court did award\n\nprejudgment interest, it should not begin to run until the date of the\n\nreasonableness stipulation in 2005.

Characterizing the presentation of attorney time\n\nas \"conservative,\" the court found that the plaintiff \"omitted billing time spent on\n\ncertain routine, reasonable and necessary matters such as phone calls,\n\ninteroffice communications, developing theories and strategies, and more, and\n\nhas taken reasonable steps to avoid and reduce claims for fees that might\n\ninvolve duplicative, non-productive or wasteful matters.\"33 Our review of the\n\nrecord confirms that the time claimed for particular events during the litigation\n\nwas not inflated. We conclude the reconstruction of hours from the court docket\n\nand the correspondence file was an adequate basis for the determination.\n\n       The total hours an attorney has recorded for work in a case is to be\n\ndiscounted for hours spent on \"unsuccessful claims, duplicated effort, or\n\n\n       33 Clerk's Papers at 5682.\n                                             47\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/48\n\n\n\n\notherwise unproductive time.\" Bowers, 100 Wn.2d at 597.

But the court's findings must show how the court\n\nresolved disputed issues of fact and the conclusions must explain the court's\n\nanalysis. Berrvman. 312 P.2d at       .\n\n       Safeco contends the trial court should have segregated the time\n\nassociated with the consumer protection claim, on which fees were recoverable,\n\nfrom the tort claims for bad faith and negligence, on which fees were not\n\nrecoverable. Safeco did not make this argument in its trial brief opposing the\n\nrequest for an attorney fee award. The order awarding attorney fees found that\n\nMiller's several causes of action were interrelated. They all \"involved a common\n\ncore of facts and circumstances, in which the time devoted to discovery, pretrial\n\nmotions and preparation and trial of this intertwined action cannot be reasonably\n\nsegregated (which is one reason this Court previously denied Safeco's motion to\n\nbifurcate the causes of action).\"34 The trial record supports the court's\n\ncharacterization of the interrelatedness of the causes of action. Especially\n\nbecause Safeco made no proposal as to how the time could have been\n\nsegregated, we cannot find that the trial court was obliged to make a\n\nsegregation.\n\n\n\n\n      34 Clerk's Papers at 5712.\n                                            48\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/49\n\n\n\n\n       As a discovery sanction ordered by the trial court on February 15, 2008,\n\nSafeco paid Miller's attorney fees of $43,487.37 incurred in connection with the\n\nuninsured motorist coverage issue.35 Because Miller's request for attorney fees\n\nat the end of the case included 45 hours for work related to UIM coverage,\n\nSafeco contends the same work was billed twice. In response to this contention\n\nbelow, Beninger provided a supplemental declaration in which he explained that\n\nthe payment received from Safeco in 2008 was only for fees incurred in\n\nestablishing, by order of partial summary judgment, that the policy provided UIM\n\ncoverage of $500,000. Whether Safeco committed bad faith when it represented\n\nthat the policy limits were $100,000 was an issue left for trial. Safeco does not\n\nrebut Miller's explanation that these were two separate issues, and we therefore\n\nconclude the claim of double billing is unfounded.\n\n       Safeco contends the court erred by awarding fees for counsel's\n\nunsuccessful efforts. Safeco specifically refers to time spent on a motion\n\nconcerning legal duties that did not result in a jury instruction, researching a\n\ncause of action that was never brought, advocating motions in limine that the\n\ncourt denied, and opposing Safeco's motions in limine that the court granted.\n\nSafeco contends the time spent on these efforts should have been excluded\n\nunder Chuong Van Pham. 159 Wn.2d at 539-40. In Chuong Van Pham. the\n\nSupreme Court affirmed the trial court's decision to reduce the lodestar for time\n\nspent on unsuccessful claims. The case holds that appellate courts will ordinarily\n\ndefer to the trial court's discretion, especially in complex cases. \"The issue\n\n\n       35 Clerk's Papers at 5461-62.\n                                             49\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/50\n\n\n\n\nbefore us is not whether we would have awarded a different amount, but whether\n\nthe trial court abused its discretion.\" Chuong Van Pham. 159 Wn.2d at 540.\n\nHere, unlike in Chuong Van Pham, the trial court made no finding that the efforts\n\nof counsel identified by Safeco were unnecessarily expended, unproductive, or\n\ninsufficiently related to the overall success of the litigation.\n\n       The trial judge is in the best position to determine the proper lodestar\n\namount.

Typically, the quality of work performed\n\nwill not justify an enhancement because \"in virtually every case the quality of the\n\nwork will be reflected in the reasonable hourly rate.\" Bowers, 100 Wn.2d at 599.\n\nSafeco contends that the risk assumed by Miller's attorneys was already\n\naccounted for by the hourly rates approved as part of the lodestar.\n\n       The trial court aptly summarized the risk assumed by Miller's attorneys:\n\n\n\n                                               50\n\fNo. 68594-5-1/51\n\n\n\n\n       This Court is intimately familiar with the details and duration of this\n       marathon case. This case has been ongoing since 2002 and is one\n       of the most complex and difficult civil cases ever undertaken in\n       Skagit County. The case took nearly eight years of litigation, a 14\n       day bifurcated jury trial, two previous trips to the Court of Appeals,\n       70,000 pages of documents, 95 motions, a $25,000 discovery\n       sanction imposed, and 669 entries in the trial court docket. This\n       case was toughJ361\n\n       Since Bowers, a recurring question \"has been whether the business risk\n\ninherent in taking a contingent fee case justifies enhancing the lodestar.\"\n\nBerrvman. 312 P.3d at 758. Here, it did. The trial court appropriately decided\n\nthat this is one of the rare cases in which risk justified a multiplier. The risk was\n\nall or nothing. Eight years was an unusually long time to go without payment,\n\nespecially considering the amount of work the litigation required throughout those\n\neight years. Furthermore, private prosecution of Consumer Protection Act\n\nviolations is backed by public policy. Protecting consumers against the bad faith\n\nof insurance companies fulfills the purpose of the statute that authorizes the fee\n\naward. The litigation vindicated the right of every consumer who pays for liability\n\ninsurance—often a very significant portion of the household budget—to be\n\nprotected from a financial catastrophe. When litigation under the Consumer\n\nProtection Act \"produces protection for everyone who might in the future be\n\ninjured by a specific violation, then it follows that the reasonableness of the\n\nattorney's fee should be governed by substantially more than the import of the\n\ncase to the plaintiff alone.\" Berrvman. 312 P.3d at 762, citing Connelly v.
