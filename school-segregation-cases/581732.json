DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 12–123.      Argued March 20, 2013—Decided June 10, 2013\nThe Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 (AMAA), which was\n  enacted to stabilize prices for agricultural commodities, regulates\n  only “handlers,” i.e., “processors, associations of producers, and others\n  engaged in the handling” of covered agricultural commodities, 7\n  U. S. C. §608c(1). Any handler that violates the Secretary of Agricul-\n  ture’s marketing orders may be subject to civil and criminal penal-\n  ties. §§608a(5), 608a(6), and 608c(14). One such order, the Califor-\n  nia Raisin Marketing Order (Marketing Order or Order), established\n  a Raisin Administrative Committee (RAC), which recommends set-\n  ting up annual reserve pools of raisins that are not to be sold on the\n  open domestic market, and which recommends what portion of a par-\n  ticular year’s production should be included in the pool. The Order\n  also requires handlers to pay assessments to help cover the RAC’s\n  administrative costs.\n     Petitioners, California raisin growers, started a business that pro-\n  cessed more than 3 million pounds of raisins from their farm and 60\n  other farms during the two crop years. When they refused to surren-\n  der the requisite portions of raisins to the reserve, the United States\n  Department of Agriculture (USDA) began administrative proceed-\n  ings, alleging that petitioners were handlers who were required to re-\n  tain raisins in reserve and pay assessments. Petitioners countered\n  that as producers, they were not subject to the Order. They also\n  raised an affirmative defense that the Order violated the Fifth\n  Amendment’s prohibition against taking property without just com-\n  pensation. An Administrative Law Judge found that petitioners were\n  handlers, found that they had violated the AMAA and the Marketing\n  Order, and rejected their takings defense. On appeal, a judicial of-\n  ficer agreed that petitioners were handlers who had violated the\n\f2            HORNE v. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    Marketing Order, imposed fines and civil penalties, and declined to\n    address the takings claim. Petitioners sought review in the Federal\n    District Court. Granting summary judgment to the USDA, it found\n    that substantial evidence supported the agency’s determination that\n    petitioners were handlers rather than producers, and it rejected peti-\n    tioners’ takings claim. The Ninth Circuit affirmed. It agreed that\n    petitioners were handlers subject to the Marketing Order, but con-\n    cluded that it lacked jurisdiction to resolve the takings claim, which\n    they should have raised in the Court of Federal Claims. It recognized\n    that when a handler raises a takings defense, Court of Federal\n    Claims Tucker Act jurisdiction gives way to the AMAA’s comprehen-\n    sive remedial scheme, see 7 U. S. C. §608c(15), but found that peti-\n    tioners had brought the takings claim in their capacity as producers.\nHeld: The Ninth Circuit has jurisdiction to decide petitioners’ takings\n claim. Pp. 9–15.\n    (a) That court incorrectly determined that petitioners brought their\n takings claim as producers rather than handlers. Petitioners argued\n that they were producers—and thus not subject to the AMAA or the\n Marketing Order—but both the USDA and the District Court con-\n cluded that they were handlers. And the fines and civil penalties for\n failure to reserve raisins were levied on them in that capacity. Be-\n cause the Marketing Order imposes duties on petitioners only in\n their capacity as handlers, their takings claim raised as a defense\n against those duties is necessarily raised in that same capacity. In\n finding otherwise, the Ninth Circuit confused petitioners’ statutory\n argument that they were producers with their constitutional argu-\n ment that, assuming they were handlers, their fine violated the Fifth\n Amendment. The relevant question is whether a federal court has\n jurisdiction to adjudicate a takings defense raised by a handler seek-\n ing review of a final agency order. Pp. 9–10.\n    (b) The Government’s claim that petitioners’ takings-based defense\n was rightly dismissed on ripeness grounds is unpersuasive, and its\n reliance on Williamson County Regional Planning Comm’n v. Hamil-\n ton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U. S. 172, is misplaced. There, a\n plaintiff ’s claim that a zoning decision effected a taking without just\n compensation was not ripe. But the claim failed because the plaintiff\n could not show that it had been injured by the Government’s action\n when there had been no final decision. Here, petitioners were subject\n to a final agency order imposing concrete fines and penalties. The\n takings claim in Williamson County was also not yet ripe because the\n plaintiff had not sought “compensation through the procedures [pro-\n vided by] the State.” Id., at 194. The Government argues that peti-\n tioners’ takings claim is premature because the Tucker Act affords a\n remedy, but, in fact, the AMAA provides a comprehensive remedial\n\f                     Cite as: 569 U.

As a result, there is no alternative remedy. Pp. 10–14.\n     (c) A takings-based defense may be raised by a handler in the con-\n  text of an enforcement proceeding initiated by the USDA under\n  §608c(14). The provision’s text does not bar handlers from raising\n  constitutional defenses to the USDA’s enforcement action. Allowing\n  handlers to do so would not diminish the incentive to file direct chal-\n  lenges to marketing orders under §608c(15)(A), for a handler who re-\n  fuses to comply with a marketing order and waits for an enforcement\n  action will be liable for significant monetary penalties if the constitu-\n  tional challenge fails. It would also make little sense to force a party\n  to pay an assessed fine in one proceeding and then turn around and\n  sue for recovery of that same money in another proceeding.

HORNE, ET AL., PETITIONERS v. \n\n         DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 10, 2013] \n\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of\n1937 (AMAA) and the California Raisin Marketing Order\n(Marketing Order or Order) promulgated by the Secretary\nof Agriculture, raisin growers are frequently required to\nturn over a percentage of their crop to the Federal Gov-\nernment. The AMAA and the Marketing Order were\nadopted to stabilize prices by limiting the supply of raisins\non the market. Petitioners are California raisin growers\nwho believe that this regulatory scheme violates the Fifth\nAmendment. After petitioners refused to surrender the\nrequisite portion of their raisins, the United States De-\npartment of Agriculture (USDA) began administrative pro-\nceedings against petitioners that led to the imposition\nof more than $650,000 in fines and civil penalties. Peti-\ntioners sought judicial review, claiming that the monetary\nsanctions were an unconstitutional taking of private prop-\nerty without just compensation. The Ninth Circuit held\nthat petitioners were required to bring their takings claim\nin the Court of Federal Claims and that it therefore lacked\njurisdiction to review petitioners’ claim. We disagree.\n\f2        HORNE v. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nPetitioners’ takings claim, raised as an affirmative defense\nto the agency’s enforcement action, was properly before\nthe court because the AMAA provides a comprehensive\nremedial scheme that withdraws Tucker Act jurisdiction\nover takings claims brought by raisin handlers. Accord-\ningly, we reverse and remand to the Ninth Circuit.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  Congress enacted the AMAA during the Great Depres-\nsion in an effort to insulate farmers from competitive\nmarket forces that it believed caused “unreasonable fluc-\ntuations in supplies and prices.” Ch. 296, 50 Stat. 246,\nas amended, 7 U. S. C. §602(4). To achieve this goal,\nCongress declared a national policy of stabilizing prices for\nagricultural commodities. Ibid. The AMAA authorizes\nthe Secretary of Agriculture to promulgate marketing or-\nders that regulate the sale and delivery of agricultural\ngoods. §608c(1); see also Block v. Community Nutrition\nInstitute, 467 U. S. 340, 346 (1984) (“The Act contemplates\na cooperative venture among the Secretary, handlers, and\nproducers the principal purposes of which are to raise the\nprice of agricultural products and to establish an orderly\nsystem for marketing them”). The Secretary may delegate\nto industry committees the authority to administer mar-\nketing orders. §608c(7)(C).\n  The AMAA does not directly regulate the “producer[s]”\nwho grow agricultural commodities, §608c(13)(B); it only\nregulates “handlers,” which the AMAA defines as “proces-\nsors, associations of producers, and others engaged in the\nhandling” of covered agricultural commodities. §608c(1).\nHandlers who violate the Secretary’s marketing orders\nmay be subject to civil and criminal penalties. §§608a(5),\n608a(6), and 608c(14).\n  The Secretary promulgated a marketing order for Cali-\n\f                      Cite as: 569 U.

In particular,\n“[t]he Raisin Marketing Order, like other fruit and vegeta-\nble orders adopted under the AMAA, [sought] to stabilize\nproducer returns by limiting the quantity of raisins sold\nby handlers in the domestic competitive market.” Lion\nRaisins, Inc. v. United States, 416 F. 3d 1356, 1359 (CA\nFed. 2005). The Marketing Order defines a raisin “han-\ndler” as “(a) [a]ny processor or packer; (b) [a]ny person\nwho places . . . raisins in the current of commerce from\nwithin [California] to any point outside thereof; (c) [a]ny\nperson who delivers off-grade raisins . . . into any eligible\nnon-normal outlet; or (d) [a]ny person who blends raisins\n[subject to certain exceptions].” 7 CFR §989.15.\n   The Marketing Order also established the Raisin Ad-\nministrative Committee (RAC), which consists of 47 mem-\nbers, with 35 representing producers, ten representing\nhandlers, one representing the cooperative bargaining\nassociations, and one member of the public. See §989.26.\nThe Marketing Order authorizes the RAC to recommend\nsetting up annual reserve pools of raisins that are not\nto be sold on the open domestic market. See 7 U. S. C.\n§608c(6)(E); 7 CFR §§989.54(d) and 989.65. Each year, the\nRAC reviews crop yield, inventories, and shipments and\nmakes recommendations to the Secretary whether or not\nthere should be a reserve pool. §989.54. If the RAC rec-\nommends a reserve pool, it also recommends what portion\nof that year’s production should be included in the pool\n(“reserve-tonnage”). The rest of that year’s production\nremains available for sale on the open market (“free-\ntonnage”). §§989.54(d), (a). The Secretary approves the\n——————\n  1 The AMAA also applies to a vast array of other agricultural prod-\n\nucts, including “[m]ilk, fruits (including filberts, almonds, pecans and\nwalnuts . . . , pears, olives, grapefruit, cherries, caneberries (including\nraspberries, blackberries, and loganberries), cranberries, . . . tobacco,\nvegetables, . . . hops, [and] honeybees.” §608c(2).\n\f4          HORNE v. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nrecommendation if he determines that the recommen-\ndation would “effectuate the declared policy of the Act.”\n§989.55. The reserve-tonnage, calculated as a percentage\nof a producer’s crop, varies from year to year.2\n   Under the Marketing Order’s reserve requirements, a\nproducer is only paid for the free-tonnage raisins. §989.65.\nThe reserve-tonnage raisins, on the other hand, must be\nheld by the handler in segregated bins “for the account” of\nthe RAC. §989.66(f ). The RAC may then sell the reserve-\ntonnage raisins to handlers for resale in overseas markets,\nor may alternatively direct that they be sold or given at no\ncost to secondary, noncompetitive domestic markets, such\nas school lunch programs. §989.67(b). The reserve pool\nsales proceeds are used to finance the RAC’s administra-\ntive costs. §989.53(a). In the event that there are any\nremaining funds, the producers receive a pro rata share. 7\nU. S. C. §608c(6)(E); 7 CFR §989.66(h). As a result, even\nthough producers do not receive payment for reserve-\ntonnage raisins at the time of delivery to a handler, they\nretain a limited interest in the net proceeds of the RAC’s\ndisposition of the reserve pool.\n   Handlers have other duties beyond managing the RAC’s\nreserve pool. The Marketing Order requires them to file\ncertain reports with the RAC, such as reports concerning\nthe quantity of raisins that they hold or acquire. §989.73.\nThey are also required to allow the RAC access to their\npremises, raisins, and business records to verify the ac-\ncuracy of the handlers’ reports, §989.77, to obtain inspec-\ntions of raisins acquired, §989.58(d), and to pay certain\nassessments, §989.80, which help cover the RAC’s admin-\nistrative costs.

The Hornes do business as Raisin Valley\nFarms, a general partnership. For more than 30 years,\nthe Hornes operated only as raisin producers. But, af-\nter becoming disillusioned with the AMAA regulatory\nscheme,3 they began looking for ways to avoid the manda-\ntory reserve program. Since the AMAA applies only to\nhandlers, the Hornes devised a plan to bring their raisins\nto market without going through a traditional handler. To\nthis end, the Hornes entered into a partnership with Mrs.\nHorne’s parents called Lassen Vineyards. In addition to\nits grape-growing activities, Lassen Vineyards purchased\nequipment to clean, stem, sort, and package the raisins\nfrom Raisin Valley Farms and Lassen Vineyards. It also\ncontracted with more than 60 other raisin growers to\nclean, stem, sort, and, in some cases, box and stack their\nraisins for a fee. The Hornes’ facilities processed more\n——————\n  3 The Hornes wrote the Secretary and to the RAC in 2002 setting out\n\ntheir grievances: “[W]e are growers that will pack and market our\nraisins. We reserve our rights under the Constitution of the United\nStates . . . [T]he Marketing Order Regulating Raisins has become a tool\nfor grower bankruptcy, poverty, and involuntary servitude. The Mar-\nketing Order Regulating Raisins is a complete failure for growers,\nhandlers, and the USDA . . . [W]e will not relinquish ownership of our\ncrop. We put forth the money and effort to grow it, not the Raisin\nAdministrative Committee. This is America, not a communist state.”\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 60a.\n\f6        HORNE v.

During these two crop\nyears, the Hornes produced 27.4% and 12.3% of the raisins\nthey processed, respectively.\n  Although the USDA informed the Hornes in 2001 that\ntheir proposed operations made them “handlers” under the\nAMAA, the Hornes paid no assessments to the RAC dur-\ning the 2002–2003 and 2003–2004 crop years. Nor did\nthey set aside reserve-tonnage raisins from those produced\nand owned by the more than 60 other farmers who con-\ntracted with Lassen Vineyards for packing services. They\nalso declined to arrange for RAC inspection of the rai-\nsins they received for processing, denied the RAC access\nto their records, and held none of their own raisins in\nreserve.\n  On April 1, 2004, the Administrator of the Agriculture\nMarketing Service (Administrator) initiated an enforce-\nment action against the Hornes, Raisin Valley Farms, and\nLassen Vineyards (petitioners). The complaint alleged\nthat petitioners were “handlers” of California raisins\nduring the 2002–2003 and 2003–2004 crop years. It also\nalleged that petitioners violated the AMAA and the Mar-\nketing Order by submitting inaccurate forms to the RAC\nand failing to hold inspections of incoming raisins, retain\nraisins in reserve, pay assessments, and allow access to\ntheir records. Petitioners denied the allegations, counter-\ning that they were not “handlers” and asserting that they\ndid not acquire physical possession of the other producers’\nraisins within the meaning of the regulations. Petition-\ners also raised several affirmative defenses, including a\nclaim that the Marketing Order violated the Fifth Amend-\nment’s prohibition against taking property without just\ncompensation.\n  An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) concluded in 2006\nthat petitioners were handlers of raisins and thus subject\nto the Marketing Order. The ALJ also concluded that\n\f                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npetitioners violated the AMAA and the Marketing Order\nand rejected petitioners’ takings defense based on its view\nthat “handlers no longer have a property right that per-\nmits them to market their crop free of regulatory control.”\nApp. 39 (citing Cal-Almond, Inc. v. United States, 30 Fed.\nCl. 244, 246–247 (1994)).\n   Petitioners appealed to a judicial officer who, like the\nALJ, also found that petitioners were handlers and that\nthey had violated the Marketing Order. The judicial of-\nficer imposed $202,600 in civil penalties under 7 U. S. C.\n§608c(14)(B); $8,783.39 in assessments for the two crop\nyears under 7 CFR §989.80(a); and $483,843.53 for the\nvalue of the California raisins that petitioners failed to\nhold in reserve for the two crop years under §989.166(c).\nThe judicial officer believed that he lacked “authority to\njudge the constitutionality of the various statutes admin-\nistered by the [USDA],” App. 73, and declined to adjudi-\ncate petitioners’ takings claim.\n   Petitioners filed a complaint in Federal District Court\nseeking judicial review of the USDA’s decision. See 7\nU. S. C. §608c(14)(B). The District Court granted sum-\nmary judgment to the USDA. The court held that sub-\nstantial evidence supported the agency’s determination\nthat petitioners were “handlers” subject to the Marketing\nOrder, and rejected petitioners’ argument that they were\nexempt from the Marketing Order due to their status as\n“producers” under §608c(13)(B). No. CV–F–08–1549 LJO\nSMS, 2009 WL 4895362, *15 (ED Cal., Dec. 11, 2009).\nPetitioners renewed their Fifth Amendment argument,\nasserting that the reserve-tonnage requirement consti-\ntuted a physical taking. Though the District Court found\nthat the RAC takes title to a significant portion of a Cali-\nfornia raisin producer’s crop through the reserve require-\nment, the court held that the transfer of title to the RAC\ndid not constitute a physical taking. See id., at *26 (“ ‘[I]n\nessence, [petitioners] are paying an admissions fee or\n\f8        HORNE v. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntoll—admittedly a steep one—for marketing raisins. The\nGovernment does not force plaintiffs to grow raisins or\nto market the raisins; rather, it directs that if they grow\nand market raisins, then passing title to their “reserve\ntonnage” raisins to the RAC is the admissions ticket’” (quot-\ning Evans v. United States, 74 Fed. Cl. 554, 563–564\n(2006))).\n   The Ninth Circuit affirmed. The court agreed that\npetitioners were “handlers” subject to the Marketing Or-\nder’s provisions, and rejected petitioners’ argument that\nthey were producers, and, thus exempt from regulation.\n673 F. 3d 1071, 1078 (2012). The court did not resolve\npetitioners’ takings claim, however, because it concluded\nthat that it lacked jurisdiction to do so. The court ex-\nplained that “a takings claim against the federal govern-\nment must be brought [in the Court of Federal Claims] in\nthe first instance, ‘unless Congress has withdrawn the\nTucker Act grant of jurisdiction in the relevant statute.’ ”\nId., at 1079 (quoting Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, 524\nU. S. 498, 520 (1998) (plurality opinion)). The court rec-\nognized that 7 U. S. C. §608c(15) provides an administra-\ntive remedy to handlers wishing to challenge marketing\norders under the AMAA, and it agreed that “when a han-\ndler, or a producer-handler in its capacity as a handler,\nchallenges a marketing order on takings grounds, Court of\nFederal Claims Tucker Act jurisdiction gives way to sec-\ntion [60]8c(15)’s comprehensive procedural scheme and\nadministrative exhaustion requirements.” 673 F. 3d, at\n1079. But, the Ninth Circuit determined, petitioners\nbrought the takings claim in their capacity as producers,\nnot handlers. Id., at 1080. Consequently, the court was\nof the view that “[n]othing in the AMAA precludes the\nHornes from alleging in the Court of Federal Claims that\nthe reserve program injures them in their capacity as\nproducers by subjecting them to a taking requiring com-\npensation.” Ibid.

Ibid.\n  We granted certiorari to determine whether the Ninth\nCircuit has jurisdiction to review petitioners’ takings\nclaim. 568 U. S. ___ (2012).\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\n   The Ninth Circuit’s jurisdictional ruling flowed from its\ndetermination that petitioners brought their takings claim\nas producers rather than handlers. This determination is\nnot correct. Although petitioners argued that they were\nproducers—and thus not subject to the AMAA or Market-\ning Order at all—both the USDA and the District Court\nconcluded that petitioners were “handlers.” Accordingly,\nthe civil penalty, assessment, and reimbursement for fail-\nure to reserve raisins were all levied on petitioners in\ntheir capacity as “handlers.” If petitioners’ argument that\nthey were producers had prevailed, they would not have\nbeen subject to any of the monetary sanctions imposed on\nthem. See 7 U. S. C. §608c(13)(B) (“No order issued under\nthis chapter shall be applicable to any producer in his\ncapacity as a producer”).\n   It is undisputed that the Marketing Order imposes\nduties on petitioners only in their capacity as handlers.\nAs a result, any defense raised against those duties is\nnecessarily raised in that same capacity. Petitioners ar-\ngue that it would be unconstitutional for the Government\nto come on their land and confiscate raisins, or to con-\nfiscate the proceeds of raisin sales, without paying just com-\npensation; and, that it is therefore unconstitutional to fine\npetitioners for not complying with the unconstitutional\nrequirement.4 See Brief for Petitioners 54. Given that\n——————\n  4 The Ninth Circuit construed the takings argument quite differently,\n\nstating that petitioners believe the regulatory scheme “takes reserve-\ntonnage raisins belonging to producers.” 673 F. 3d 1071, 1080 (2012).\n\f10         HORNE v. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nfines can only be levied on handlers, petitioners’ takings\nclaim makes sense only as a defense to penalties imposed\nupon them in their capacity as handlers. The Ninth Cir-\ncuit confused petitioners’ statutory argument (i.e., “we are\nproducers, not handlers”) with their constitutional argu-\nment (i.e., “assuming we are handlers, fining us for refus-\ning to turn over reserve-tonnage raisins violates the Fifth\nAmendment”).5\n   The relevant question, then, is whether a federal court\nhas jurisdiction to adjudicate a takings defense raised by a\nhandler seeking review of a final agency order.\n                             B\n  The Government argues that petitioners’ takings-based\ndefense was rightly dismissed on ripeness grounds. Brief\nfor Respondent 21–22. According to the Government, be-\ncause a takings claim can be pursued later in the Court\nof Federal Claims, the Ninth Circuit correctly refused to\nadjudicate petitioners’ takings defense. In support of its\nposition, the Government relies largely on Williamson\nCounty Regional Planning Comm’n v. Hamilton Bank of\n——————\nWhen the agency brought its enforcement action against petitioners,\nhowever, it did not seek to recover reserve-tonnage raisins from the\n2002–2003 and 2003–2004 crop years. Rather, it sought monetary\npenalties and reimbursement. Petitioners could not argue in the face of\nsuch agency action that the Secretary was attempting to take raisins\nthat had already been harvested and sold. Instead, petitioners argued\nthat they could not be compelled to pay fines for refusing to accede to\nan unconstitutional taking.\n   5 The Government notes that petitioners did not own most of the rai-\n\nsins that they failed to reserve and argues that petitioners would have\nno takings claim based on those raisins. See Brief for Respondent 19.\nWe take no position on the merits of petitioners’ takings claim. We\nsimply recognize that insofar as the petitioners challenged the imposi-\ntion of monetary sanctions under the Marketing Order, they raised\ntheir takings-based defense in their capacity as handlers. On remand,\nthe Ninth Circuit can decide in the first instance whether petitioners\nmay raise the takings defense with respect to raisins they never owned.\n\f                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nJohnson City, 473 U. S. 172 (1985). Brief for Respondent\n21–22 (“Just compensation need not ‘be paid in advance\nof, or contemporaneously with, the taking; all that is re-\nquired is that a ‘reasonable, certain and adequate provision\nfor obtaining compensation’ exist at the time of the taking’ ”\n(quoting Williamson County, 473 U. S., at 194)). In that\ncase, the plaintiff filed suit against the Regional Planning\nCommission, claiming that a zoning decision by the Com-\nmission effected a taking of property without just compen-\nsation. Id., at 182. We found that the plaintiff ’s claim\nwas not “ripe” for two reasons, neither of which supports\nthe Government’s position.\n   First, we explained that the plaintiff ’s takings claim in\nWilliamson County failed because the plaintiff could not\nshow that it had been injured by the Government’s action.\nSpecifically, the plaintiff “ha[d] not yet obtained a final\ndecision regarding the application of the zoning ordinance\nand subdivision regulations to its property.” Id., at 186.\nHere, by contrast, petitioners were subject to a final agency\norder imposing concrete fines and penalties at the time\nthey sought judicial review under §608c(14)(B). This was\nclearly sufficient “injury” for federal jurisdiction.\n   Second, the Williamson County plaintiff ’s takings claim\nwas not yet ripe because the plaintiff had not sought\n“compensation through the procedures the State ha[d]\nprovided for doing so.” Id., at 194. We explained that\n“[i]f the government has provided an adequate process\nfor obtaining compensation, and if resort to that process\nyields just compensation, then the property owner has no\nclaim against the Government for a taking.” Id., at 194–\n195 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).\nStated differently, a Fifth Amendment claim is premature\nuntil it is clear that the Government has both taken prop-\nerty and denied just compensation. Although we often\nrefer to this consideration as “prudential ‘ripeness,’ ” Lucas\nv. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U. S. 1003, 1013\n\f12          HORNE v. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n(1992), we have recognized that it is not, strictly speaking,\njurisdictional.6 See Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc. v.\nFlorida Dept. of Environmental Protection, 560 U. S. ___,\n___, and n. 10 (2010) (slip op., at 24, and n. 10).\n  Here, the Government argues that petitioners’ takings\nclaim is premature because the Tucker Act affords “the\nrequisite reasonable, certain, and adequate provision for\nobtaining just compensation that a property owner must\npursue.” Brief for Respondent 22. In the Government’s\nview, “[p]etitioners should have complied with the order,\nand, after a portion of their raisins were placed in reserve\nto be disposed of as directed by the RAC, . . . sought com-\npensation as producers in the Court of Federal Claims\nfor the alleged taking.” Id., at 24–25. We disagree with\nthe Government’s argument, however, because the AMAA\nprovides a comprehensive remedial scheme that with-\ndraws Tucker Act jurisdiction over a handler’s takings\nclaim. As a result, there is no alternative “reasonable,\ncertain, and adequate” remedial scheme through which\npetitioners (as handlers) must proceed before obtaining\nreview of their claim under the AMAA.7\n  The Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction over Tucker\nAct claims “founded either upon the Constitution, or any\nAct of Congress or any regulation of an executive de-\npartment.” 28 U. S. C. §1491(a)(1). “[A] claim for just\ncompensation under the Takings Clause must be brought\nto the Court of Federal Claims in the first instance, unless\n——————\n  6 A “Case” or “Controversy” exists once the government has taken\n\nprivate property without paying for it. Accordingly, whether an alter-\nnative remedy exists does not affect the jurisdiction of the federal court.\n  7 That is not to say that a producer who turns over her reserve-\n\ntonnage raisins could not bring suit for just compensation in the Court\nof Claims. Whether a producer could bring such a claim, and what\nimpact the availability of such a claim would have on petitioners’\ntakings-based defense, are questions going to the merits of petitioners’\ndefense, not to a court’s jurisdiction to entertain it. We therefore do not\naddress those issues here.\n\f                     Cite as: 569 U.

S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 5) (where “a\nstatute contains its own self-executing remedial scheme,”\na court “look[s] only to that statute”). To determine\nwhether a statutory scheme displaces Tucker Act jurisdic-\ntion, a court must “examin[e] the purpose of the [statute],\nthe entirety of its text, and the structure of review that it\nestablishes.” United States v. Fausto, 484 U. S. 439, 444\n(1988).\n    Under the AMAA’s comprehensive remedial scheme,\nhandlers may challenge the content, applicability, and en-\nforcement of marketing orders. Pursuant to §§608c(15)\n(A)–(B), a handler may file with the Secretary a direct\nchallenge to a marketing order and its applicability to\nhim. We have held that “any handler” subject to a mar-\nketing order must raise any challenges to the order,\nincluding constitutional challenges, in administrative\nproceedings. See United States v. Ruzicka, 329 U. S. 287,\n294 (1946). Once the Secretary issues a ruling, the federal\ndistrict court where the “handler is an inhabitant, or has\nhis principal place of business” is “vested with jurisdiction\n. . . to review [the] ruling.”8 §608c(15)(B). These statutory\nprovisions afford handlers a ready avenue to bring takings\nclaim against the USDA. We thus conclude that the\nAMAA withdraws Tucker Act jurisdiction over petitioners’\n\n——————\n  8 Petitioners filed an administrative petition before the Secretary in\n\nMarch 2007 pursuant to §608c(15)(A) challenging the Marketing Order\nand its application to them. The USDA argued that they had no\nstanding to file the petition because they had not admitted that they\nwere handlers. The judicial officer granted the USDA’s motion to\ndismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction. Petitioners filed a com-\nplaint in District Court, but the court dismissed it as untimely. The\nNinth Circuit affirmed. See Horne v. Dept. of Agriculture, 395 Fed.\nAppx. 486 (2010).\n\f14       HORNE v. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntakings claim. Petitioners (as handlers) have no alterna-\ntive remedy, and their takings claim was not “premature”\nwhen presented to the Ninth Circuit.\n                             C\n   Although petitioners’ claim was not “premature” for\nTucker Act purposes, the question remains whether a\ntakings-based defense may be raised by a handler in the\ncontext of an enforcement proceeding initiated by the\nUSDA under §608c(14). We hold that it may. The\nAMAA provides that the handler may not be subjected\nto an adverse order until he has been given “notice and\nan opportunity for an agency hearing on the record.”\n§608c(14)(B). The text of §608c(14)(B) does not bar han-\ndlers from raising constitutional defenses to the USDA’s\nenforcement action. Allowing handlers to raise constitu-\ntional challenges in the course of enforcement proceedings\nwould not diminish the incentive to file direct challenges\nto marketing orders under §608c(15)(A) because a handler\nwho refuses to comply with a marketing order and waits\nfor an enforcement action will be liable for significant\nmonetary penalties if his constitutional challenge fails.\n   In the case of an administrative enforcement proceed-\ning, when a party raises a constitutional defense to an\nassessed fine, it would make little sense to require the\nparty to pay the fine in one proceeding and then turn\naround and sue for recovery of that same money in another\nproceeding. See Eastern Enterprises, supra, at 520. We\nsee no indication that Congress intended this result for\nhandlers subject to enforcement proceedings under the\nAMAA. Petitioners were therefore free to raise their\ntakings-based defense before the USDA. And, because\n§608c(14)(B) allows a handler to seek judicial review of an\nadverse order, the district court and Ninth Circuit were\nnot precluded from reviewing petitioners’ constitutional\nchallenge. The grant of jurisdiction necessarily includes\n\f                 Cite as: 569 U.

Any handler that violates the Secretary of Agricul-\n  ture’s marketing orders may be subject to civil and criminal penal-\n  ties. §§608a(5), 608a(6), and 608c(14). One such order, the Califor-\n  nia Raisin Marketing Order (Marketing Order or Order), established\n  a Raisin Administrative Committee (RAC), which recommends set-\n  ting up annual reserve pools of raisins that are not to be sold on the\n  open domestic market, and which recommends what portion of a par-\n  ticular year’s production should be included in the pool. The Order\n  also requires handlers to pay assessments to help cover the RAC’s\n  administrative costs.\n     Petitioners, California raisin growers, started a business that pro-\n  cessed more than 3 million pounds of raisins from their farm and 60\n  other farms during the two crop years. When they refused to surren-\n  der the requisite portions of raisins to the reserve, the United States\n  Department of Agriculture (USDA) began administrative proceed-\n  ings, alleging that petitioners were handlers who were required to re-\n  tain raisins in reserve and pay assessments. Petitioners countered\n  that as producers, they were not subject to the Order. They also\n  raised an affirmative defense that the Order violated the Fifth\n  Amendment’s prohibition against taking property without just com-\n  pensation. An Administrative Law Judge found that petitioners were\n  handlers, found that they had violated the AMAA and the Marketing\n  Order, and rejected their takings defense. On appeal, a judicial of-\n  ficer agreed that petitioners were handlers who had violated the\n\f2            HORNE v. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    Marketing Order, imposed fines and civil penalties, and declined to\n    address the takings claim. Petitioners sought review in the Federal\n    District Court. Granting summary judgment to the USDA, it found\n    that substantial evidence supported the agency’s determination that\n    petitioners were handlers rather than producers, and it rejected peti-\n    tioners’ takings claim. The Ninth Circuit affirmed. It agreed that\n    petitioners were handlers subject to the Marketing Order, but con-\n    cluded that it lacked jurisdiction to resolve the takings claim, which\n    they should have raised in the Court of Federal Claims. It recognized\n    that when a handler raises a takings defense, Court of Federal\n    Claims Tucker Act jurisdiction gives way to the AMAA’s comprehen-\n    sive remedial scheme, see </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. §608c(15), but found that peti-\n    tioners had brought the takings claim in their capacity as producers.\nHeld: The Ninth Circuit has jurisdiction to decide petitioners’ takings\n claim. Pp. 9–15.\n    (a) That court incorrectly determined that petitioners brought their\n takings claim as producers rather than handlers. Petitioners argued\n that they were producers—and thus not subject to the AMAA or the\n Marketing Order—but both the USDA and the District Court con-\n cluded that they were handlers. And the fines and civil penalties for\n failure to reserve raisins were levied on them in that capacity. Be-\n cause the Marketing Order imposes duties on petitioners only in\n their capacity as handlers, their takings claim raised as a defense\n against those duties is necessarily raised in that same capacity. In\n finding otherwise, the Ninth Circuit confused petitioners’ statutory\n argument that they were producers with their constitutional argu-\n ment that, assuming they were handlers, their fine violated the Fifth\n Amendment. The relevant question is whether a federal court has\n jurisdiction to adjudicate a takings defense raised by a handler seek-\n ing review of a final agency order. Pp. 9–10.\n    (b) The Government’s claim that petitioners’ takings-based defense\n was rightly dismissed on ripeness grounds is unpersuasive, and its\n reliance on Williamson County Regional Planning Comm’n v.

Allowing\n  handlers to do so would not diminish the incentive to file direct chal-\n  lenges to marketing orders under §608c(15)(A), for a handler who re-\n  fuses to comply with a marketing order and waits for an enforcement\n  action will be liable for significant monetary penalties if the constitu-\n  tional challenge fails.

The AMAA and the Marketing Order were\nadopted to stabilize prices by limiting the supply of raisins\non the market. Petitioners are California raisin growers\nwho believe that this regulatory scheme violates the Fifth\nAmendment. After petitioners refused to surrender the\nrequisite portion of their raisins, the United States De-\npartment of Agriculture (USDA) began administrative pro-\nceedings against petitioners that led to the imposition\nof more than $650,000 in fines and civil penalties. Peti-\ntioners sought judicial review, claiming that the monetary\nsanctions were an unconstitutional taking of private prop-\nerty without just compensation. The Ninth Circuit held\nthat petitioners were required to bring their takings claim\nin the Court of Federal Claims and that it therefore lacked\njurisdiction to review petitioners’ claim.

But, af-\nter becoming disillusioned with the AMAA regulatory\nscheme,3 they began looking for ways to avoid the manda-\ntory reserve program. Since the AMAA applies only to\nhandlers, the Hornes devised a plan to bring their raisins\nto market without going through a traditional handler. To\nthis end, the Hornes entered into a partnership with Mrs.\nHorne’s parents called Lassen Vineyards. In addition to\nits grape-growing activities, Lassen Vineyards purchased\nequipment to clean, stem, sort, and package the raisins\nfrom Raisin Valley Farms and Lassen Vineyards.

During these two crop\nyears, the Hornes produced 27.4% and 12.3% of the raisins\nthey processed, respectively.\n  Although the USDA informed the Hornes in 2001 that\ntheir proposed operations made them “handlers” under the\nAMAA, the Hornes paid no assessments to the RAC dur-\ning the 2002–2003 and 2003–2004 crop years. Nor did\nthey set aside reserve-tonnage raisins from those produced\nand owned by the more than 60 other farmers who con-\ntracted with Lassen Vineyards for packing services. They\nalso declined to arrange for RAC inspection of the rai-\nsins they received for processing, denied the RAC access\nto their records, and held none of their own raisins in\nreserve.\n  On April 1, 2004, the Administrator of the Agriculture\nMarketing Service (Administrator) initiated an enforce-\nment action against the Hornes, Raisin Valley Farms, and\nLassen Vineyards (petitioners). The complaint alleged\nthat petitioners were “handlers” of California raisins\nduring the 2002–2003 and 2003–2004 crop years. It also\nalleged that petitioners violated the AMAA and the Mar-\nketing Order by submitting inaccurate forms to the RAC\nand failing to hold inspections of incoming raisins, retain\nraisins in reserve, pay assessments, and allow access to\ntheir records. Petitioners denied the allegations, counter-\ning that they were not “handlers” and asserting that they\ndid not acquire physical possession of the other producers’\nraisins within the meaning of the regulations. Petition-\ners also raised several affirmative defenses, including a\nclaim that the Marketing Order violated the Fifth Amend-\nment’s prohibition against taking property without just\ncompensation.\n  An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) concluded in 2006\nthat petitioners were handlers of raisins and thus subject\nto the Marketing Order.

The District Court granted sum-\nmary judgment to the USDA. The court held that sub-\nstantial evidence supported the agency’s determination\nthat petitioners were “handlers” subject to the Marketing\nOrder, and rejected petitioners’ argument that they were\nexempt from the Marketing Order due to their status as\n“producers” under §608c(13)(B).

This determination is\nnot correct. Although petitioners argued that they were\nproducers—and thus not subject to the AMAA or Market-\ning Order at all—both the USDA and the District Court\nconcluded that petitioners were “handlers.” Accordingly,\nthe civil penalty, assessment, and reimbursement for fail-\nure to reserve raisins were all levied on petitioners in\ntheir capacity as “handlers.” If petitioners’ argument that\nthey were producers had prevailed, they would not have\nbeen subject to any of the monetary sanctions imposed on\nthem.

Petitioners ar-\ngue that it would be unconstitutional for the Government\nto come on their land and confiscate raisins, or to con-\nfiscate the proceeds of raisin sales, without paying just com-\npensation; and, that it is therefore unconstitutional to fine\npetitioners for not complying with the unconstitutional\nrequirement.4 See Brief for Petitioners 54.

The Ninth Cir-\ncuit confused petitioners’ statutory argument (i.e., “we are\nproducers, not handlers”) with their constitutional argu-\nment (i.e., “assuming we are handlers, fining us for refus-\ning to turn over reserve-tonnage raisins violates the Fifth\nAmendment”).5\n   The relevant question, then, is whether a federal court\nhas jurisdiction to adjudicate a takings defense raised by a\nhandler seeking review of a final agency order.\n                             B\n  The Government argues that petitioners’ takings-based\ndefense was rightly dismissed on ripeness grounds.

According to the Government, be-\ncause a takings claim can be pursued later in the Court\nof Federal Claims, the Ninth Circuit correctly refused to\nadjudicate petitioners’ takings defense.

Rather, it sought monetary\npenalties and reimbursement. Petitioners could not argue in the face of\nsuch agency action that the Secretary was attempting to take raisins\nthat had already been harvested and sold. Instead, petitioners argued\nthat they could not be compelled to pay fines for refusing to accede to\nan unconstitutional taking.\n   5 The Government notes that petitioners did not own most of the rai-\n\nsins that they failed to reserve and argues that petitioners would have\nno takings claim based on those raisins. See Brief for Respondent 19.\nWe take no position on the merits of petitioners’ takings claim. We\nsimply recognize that insofar as the petitioners challenged the imposi-\ntion of monetary sanctions under the Marketing Order, they raised\ntheir takings-based defense in their capacity as handlers.

Fausto, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111987\"><a href=\"/opinion/111987/united-states-v-fausto/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 444\n(1988).\n    Under the AMAA’s comprehensive remedial scheme,\nhandlers may challenge the content, applicability, and en-\nforcement of marketing orders. Pursuant to §§608c(15)\n(A)–(B), a handler may file with the Secretary a direct\nchallenge to a marketing order and its applicability to\nhim. We have held that “any handler” subject to a mar-\nketing order must raise any challenges to the order,\nincluding constitutional challenges, in administrative\nproceedings. See United States v. Ruzicka, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104340\"><a href=\"/opinion/104340/united-states-v-ruzicka/\"><span class=\"volume\">329</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">287</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n294 (1946). Once the Secretary issues a ruling, the federal\ndistrict court where the “handler is an inhabitant, or has\nhis principal place of business” is “vested with jurisdiction\n. . . to review [the] ruling.”8 §608c(15)(B). These statutory\nprovisions afford handlers a ready avenue to bring takings\nclaim against the USDA. We thus conclude that the\nAMAA withdraws Tucker Act jurisdiction over petitioners’\n\n——————\n  8 Petitioners filed an administrative petition before the Secretary in\n\nMarch 2007 pursuant to §608c(15)(A) challenging the Marketing Order\nand its application to them. The USDA argued that they had no\nstanding to file the petition because they had not admitted that they\nwere handlers. The judicial officer granted the USDA’s motion to\ndismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction. Petitioners filed a com-\nplaint in District Court, but the court dismissed it as untimely. The\nNinth Circuit affirmed. See Horne v. Dept. of Agriculture, 395 Fed.\nAppx. 486 (2010).\n\f14       HORNE v. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntakings claim. Petitioners (as handlers) have no alterna-\ntive remedy, and their takings claim was not “premature”\nwhen presented to the Ninth Circuit.\n                             C\n   Although petitioners’ claim was not “premature” for\nTucker Act purposes, the question remains whether a\ntakings-based defense may be raised by a handler in the\ncontext of an enforcement proceeding initiated by the\nUSDA under §608c(14). We hold that it may. The\nAMAA provides that the handler may not be subjected\nto an adverse order until he has been given “notice and\nan opportunity for an agency hearing on the record.”\n§608c(14)(B). The text of §608c(14)(B) does not bar han-\ndlers from raising constitutional defenses to the USDA’s\nenforcement action. Allowing handlers to raise constitu-\ntional challenges in the course of enforcement proceedings\nwould not diminish the incentive to file direct challenges\nto marketing orders under §608c(15)(A) because a handler\nwho refuses to comply with a marketing order and waits\nfor an enforcement action will be liable for significant\nmonetary penalties if his constitutional challenge fails.\n   In the case of an administrative enforcement proceed-\ning, when a party raises a constitutional defense to an\nassessed fine, it would make little sense to require the\nparty to pay the fine in one proceeding and then turn\naround and sue for recovery of that same money in another\nproceeding. See Eastern Enterprises, supra, at 520. We\nsee no indication that Congress intended this result for\nhandlers subject to enforcement proceedings under the\nAMAA. Petitioners were therefore free to raise their\ntakings-based defense before the USDA. And, because\n§608c(14)(B) allows a handler to seek judicial review of an\nadverse order, the district court and Ninth Circuit were\nnot precluded from reviewing petitioners’ constitutional\nchallenge. The grant of jurisdiction necessarily includes\n\f                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                 15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe power to review any constitutional challenges properly\npresented to and rejected by the agency. We are therefore\nsatisfied that the petitioners raised a cognizable takings\ndefense and that the Ninth Circuit erred in declining to\nadjudicate it.\n                             III\n  The Ninth Circuit has jurisdiction to decide whether the\nUSDA’s imposition of fines and civil penalties on petition-\ners, in their capacity as handlers, violated the Fifth\nAmendment. The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is re-\nversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n\f</pre>",
