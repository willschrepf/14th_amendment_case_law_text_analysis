Before the court at this time is Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment [dkt. #11] (“Mot. for SJ”). Plaintiffs allege that they are entitled to additional fees\n\nfrom the District of Columbia Public Schools (hereinafter “DCPS”) in the amount of $49,709.22.\n\nMot. for SJ at 2. Having read the parties’ pleadings, and for the reasons stated herein, plaintiffs’\n\nmotion will be granted in part.\n\nI.       BACKGROUND\n\n         A.       Findings of Fact2\n\n         Plaintiff A.S., now thirteen years old, is a child residing in the District of Columbia who\n\n\n\n1\n  W hile defendant disputes whether plaintiff prevailed on “certain claims,” defendant’s reimbursement of $12,776.85\nof plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees and costs indicates that defendant does not dispute that plaintiffs were prevailing parties\nto an extent sufficient to qualify to recover attorneys’ fees under the statute. Defendant’s Opposition to Plaintiffs’\nMotion for Summary Judgment [dkt. #12] (hereinafter “Def.’s Opp.”). at 1\n\n2\n Unless otherwise noted, the facts set forth herein are drawn from the parties’ statements of undisputed material facts\nsubmitted pursuant to Local Rule 7(h) and from the Hearing Officer’s Determination.\n\fwas found eligible in 2008 for special education and related services as a child with a disability\n\nunder the IDEA. Hearing Officer’s Determination [dkt. #11-3] (hereinafter “H.O. Det.”) at 4, ¶¶\n\n1, 4. A.S. was been diagnosed at that time with a “Specific Learning Disability” and “Other\n\nHealth Impairment.” Id., ¶ 2.\n\n       A.S. struggled academically and experienced behavioral difficulties at his charter school\n\nduring the 2008-2009 school year. In light of A.S.’s continued difficulties at the charter school,\n\nin early 2009, his parents applied for and secured placement for A.S. at Kingsbury Day School, a\n\nprivate school. Id. at 5, ¶¶ 6, 8; Plaintiffs’ Statement of Undisputed Material Facts [dkt. #11-1]\n\n(“Pltfs’ SOF”) ¶ 5.\n\n       On February 10, 2009, A.S.’s multi-disciplinary team (hereinafter “MDT”) convened a\n\nmeeting at the charter school to conduct an annual review of A.S.’s individualized education\n\nprogram (hereinafter “IEP”).” At that meeting, A.S.’s parents reported that his pediatrician had\n\nrecently diagnosed him with ADHD. While the MDT added the particular disability\n\nclassification to A.S.’s IEP in light of the diagnosis, “goals and objectives to address weaknesses\n\nin attention, organization, and/or other areas affected by his ADHD were not developed at [that]\n\ntime.” Under the IEP, A.S. remained at the charter school. H.O. Det. at 6, , ¶¶ 10-11. Following\n\nthe February IEP meeting, A.S.’s parents sent a letter through counsel formally rejecting the IEP\n\nand proposed placement, and requesting public funding for A.S.’s attendance at Kingsbury. A.S.\n\ncompleted the 2008-2009 school year at the charter school, but “his behavioral difficulties\n\ncontinued to impact his ability to make academic progress.” Id. at 7, ¶¶ 14, 16.\n\n       In June 2009, plaintiffs’ counsel wrote to the charter school and DCPS expressing\n\nconcerns about A.S.’s educational program at the charter school, and requesting another\n\nMDT/IEP team meeting. Id., ¶ 17. In early July 2009, the charter school sent A.S.’s parents\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fletters of invitation for an MDT/IEP team meeting on July 14, 2009. The meeting was canceled\n\nwhen A.S.’s parents provided the school with a lengthy independent evaluation report on July 13,\n\n2009. Id. at 8, ¶ 19.\n\n        On July 20, 2009, A.S.’s parents filed a due process complaint against DCPS, and a\n\nresolution meeting was held on July 27, 2009. DCPS agreed to conduct additional assessments\n\nbefore discussing any changes in programming and placement. DCPS sent an invitation to\n\nconvene an MDT/IEP team meeting on or about July 22, 2009, but A.S.’s parents declined the\n\nmeeting. On or about August 10, 2009, A.S.’s parents wrote to the charter school and DCPS\n\ninforming them that A.S. would attend Kingsbury during the 2009-2010 school year, and\n\nnotifying DCPS of their intent to seek public funding for this placement. A.S.’s parents\n\nresponded to subsequent invitations to convene an MDT/IEP team meeting by informing the\n\ncharter school and DCPS that they wished to wait for the completion of all evaluations before\n\nreturning to such a meeting. Id., ¶¶ 20-22.\n\n        On or about September 2, 2009, A.S. began attending Kingsbury. Id. at 9, ¶ 25. The team\n\nreconvened on or about November 16, 2009 to discuss A.S.’s speech and language evaluation;\n\nthe IEP team ultimately decided that A.S. did not require speech and language services. A.S.’s\n\nparents did not agree with the outcome of that meeting. Id. at 9-10, ¶ 29.\n\n        On December 9, 2009, the team reconvened to finalize the IEP. As a result of that\n\nmeeting, the team developed a revised IEP; however, the team did not discuss school placement\n\noptions or propose a specific school placement for A.S.’s parents to consider. Instead, a DCPS\n\nrepresentative informed A.S.’s parents that A.S.’s IEP would be sent to a DCPS “cluster\n\nsupervisor” for a determination of placement. A.S.’s parents’ request to participate in the\n\nplacement discussion was rejected. In fact, the individuals who met to discuss A.S.’s school\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fplacement subsequent to the December IEP meeting, including the Compliance Case Manager\n\nand a DCPS “cluster supervisor,” had no personal knowledge of A.S., and had never observed\n\nhim. A.S.’s parents were unable to participate in the decisions concerning A.S.’s placement, and\n\nthey did not receive a finalized copy of the IEP for several weeks following the December 2009\n\nmeeting. Id. at 10-11, ¶¶ 30-36.\n\n       In March 2010, A.S.’s parents, after visiting the school placement that had been proposed\n\nby DCPS, concluded that the program was not appropriate. A.S. would have been the only fifth-\n\ngrade student in a classroom of older students, and he would have received only fifteen hours per\n\nweek of specialized instruction, whereas A.S.’s IEP recommended nineteen hours. Id. at 12-13,\n\n¶¶ 37-39.\n\n       On April 29, 2010, A.S.’s parents filed an administrative appeal on his behalf. Pltfs’ SOF\n\n¶ 2. On May 11, 2010, the parties engaged in an unsuccessful dispute resolution meeting. A Due\n\nProcess Hearing was held before Hearing Officer Bruce Ryan. The hearing took place in four\n\nsessions: June 17, 18, and 30, and July 2, 2010. There was testimony from three witnesses for\n\npetitioner and seven witnesses for DCPS. H.O. Det. at 2.\n\n       At the hearing, plaintiffs claimed DCPS denied a Free and Appropriate Public Education\n\n(hereinafter “FAPE”) to A.S. by failing to evaluate him, by failing to provide an appropriate IEP\n\nin February 2009, by failing to propose an appropriate placement in February 2009, by failing to\n\nfind him eligible for speech and language services, by proposing an “inappropriate level of\n\nservice” and an inappropriate placement proposal following the December 2009 IEP meeting,\n\nand by committing various procedural violations. As relief for the alleged denials of FAPE,\n\nplaintiffs sought reimbursement for the costs of attending Kingsbury for the 2009-10 school year\n\nand prospective placement at Kingsbury. Id. at 3-4. On July 19, 2010, Hearing Officer Ryan\n\n\n                                                4\n\fissued his written determination.\n\n       The Hearing Officer determined that plaintiffs failed to show a denial of FAPE on the\n\nbasis of a failure to evaluate A.S., a failure to propose an appropriate placement in February\n\n2009, or a denial of speech and language services. The hearing officer found that plaintiffs did\n\nshow a denial of FAPE in part based on the lack of appropriateness of the February 2009 IEP, as\n\nwell as for certain procedural violations and based on the inappropriate December 2009 IEP and\n\ninappropriate placement proposal. Id. at 14. As to the relief requested, Hearing Officer Ryan\n\ngranted retroactive reimbursement for the latter half of the 2009-10 school year at Kingsbury, but\n\ndenied it for the first half. He determined that, prior to the 2009-10 school year, A.S.’s parents\n\nhad specifically requested that the parties wait for completion of all further evaluations before\n\nreturning to an IEP meeting; in the meantime, however, A.S. was already enrolled at Kingsbury.\n\nFurthermore, Hearing Officer Ryan found that evidence suggested that A.S.’s parents may have\n\npredetermined [A.S.’s] placement at Kingsbury as early as February 2009, long before the\n\nevaluations were completed. The Hearing Officer agreed with DCPS that “such predetermined\n\ncourse of action” was “unreasonable under the circumstances and acted to deprive DCPS of a fair\n\nopportunity to evaluate” A.S. Id. at 26-27.\n\n       As for prospective placement, the Hearing Officer concluded that plaintiffs had not\n\ndemonstrated in the hearing “that a full-time, out of general education placement at the Private\n\nSchool, going forward, is necessary and appropriately tailored to meet the specific needs of the\n\nStudent.” He also determined that “relative equities” suggested that DCPS should have a further\n\nopportunity to convene an IEP team meeting, including A.S.’s parents, to discuss an appropriate\n\nplacement for the 2010-11 school year. However, in the event that DCPS did not complete the\n\nprocess prior to the beginning of the next school year, DCPS would be obligated to fund A.S.’s\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fattendance at Kingsbury until his educational placement changed. Id. at 27-28.3\n\n         On July 27, 2010, plaintiffs sent a letter and supporting documentation to DCPS\n\nrequesting $62,486.07 for attorneys’ fees and costs sustained during the administrative action.\n\nPltfs’ SOF at ¶ 7. DCPS responded on August 24, 2010 by authorizing a check for\n\nreimbursement for attorneys’ fees and costs in the amount of $12,776.85. Id. at ¶ 8.\n\n         B.       Procedural History\n\n         On September 30, 2010, plaintiffs filed their Complaint [dkt. #1], which alleged that\n\nDCPS had not reimbursed any of the attorneys’ fees and costs to which plaintiffs were entitled.\n\nComplaint ¶ 11. On October 7, 2010, plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint [dkt. #3], which\n\nsupplemented the claims with the information that DCPS had issued a check for reimbursement\n\non September 30, 2010, in the amount of $12,776.85; however, plaintiffs claimed, a balance of\n\n$49,709.22 remained. Amended Complaint ¶ 11.4 On July 13, 2011, plaintiffs filed their motion\n\nfor summary judgment.5\n\nII.      LEGAL STANDARD\n\n         Under Section 1415(i)(3)(B) of the IDEA, federal district courts have the authority to\n\n“award reasonable attorneys’ fees as part of the costs to a prevailing party who is the parent of a\n\nchild with a disability.” 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(3)(B)(I). The court must initially determine whether\n\n\n\n3\n An IEP meeting was convened prior to the 2010-11 school year; A.S. was formally placed at Kingsbury as a result\nof the meeting. Mot. for SJ at 8 n.3. That determination has no bearing on this court’s decision.\n\n4\n  On November 16, 2010, then-defendant Adrian Fenty filed a Motion to Dismiss [dkt. #4]. Judge W alton granted\nthe motion, to which plaintiffs filed no opposition, on April 27, 2011. Order [dkt. #7].\n\n5\n  On September 7, 2011, the same day plaintiffs filed their reply brief [dkt. #15] (hereinafter “Reply”), defendant\nfiled a Notice of Supplemental Authority [dkt. #16], drawing the court’s attention to two recent cases. As plaintiffs\nnote in their reply to the Notice [dkt. #17], the document appears to be more a supplemental memorandum of law\nthan a “notice.” Id. at 1-2. Defendant did not request permission to file a surreply, which is what this document\nappears to be. W hile the court may address the cases noted by defendant, it will not consider the parties’ arguments\nin the Notice and reply in its decision.\n\n                                                          6\n\fthe party seeking attorney’s fees is the prevailing party. Jackson v. District of Columbia, 696 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 97, 101 (D.D.C. 2010).6 If a party has prevailed to some degree, it is eligible for\n\nattorneys’ fees; however, the court may determine that a reduction in fees is appropriate if a party\n\nis only partially successful. See Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 434 (1983).\n\n         Once the court has made its determination as to whether a party has prevailed and the\n\nextent to which it has prevailed, it must determine whether the attorneys’ fees being sought are\n\nreasonable. Jackson, 696 F. Supp. at 101. “The most useful starting point for determining the\n\namount of a reasonable fee is the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation\n\nmultiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.” Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433.\n\n         A plaintiff bears the burden of showing that both the number of hours expended on\n\nparticular tasks and the hourly rate are reasonable. Bucher v. District of Columbia, 777 F. Supp.\n\n2d 69, 73 (D.D.C. 2011). In demonstrating the reasonableness of the hours spent on particular\n\ntasks, the plaintiff may satisfy its burden “by submitting an invoice that is sufficiently detailed to\n\npermit the District Court to make an independent determination whether or not the hours claimed\n\nare justified.” Bucher, 777 F. Supp. 2d at 73 (quoting Holbrook v. District of Columbia, 305 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 41, 45 (D.D.C. 2004) (internal citations omitted)). In establishing that the hourly rate is\n\nreasonable, plaintiffs must submit evidence concerning the attorneys’ skill, experience, and\n\nreputation; the attorneys’ billing rates in similar cases; and the prevailing market rates in the\n\nrelevant community. Jackson, 696 F. Supp. 2d at 101; see also Covington v. District of\n\nColumbia, 57 F.3d 1101, 1107 (D.C. Cir. 1995)).\n\n\n\n\n6\n As set forth supra at footnote 1, there is no issue as to whether plaintiffs prevailed at all, rendering them eligible for\nattorneys’ fees. The issue in this case is the degree to which plaintiffs were successful.\n\n                                                             7\n\fIII.   ANALYSIS\n\n       A.      Extent of plaintiffs’ success\n\n       While defendant does not dispute that plaintiff prevailed in part, defendant argues that\n\nplaintiffs’ full fee request is not reasonable based on the limited number of issues on which\n\nplaintiff prevailed. Def.’s Opp. at 1. Defendants allege that the administrative litigation\n\nconcerned six “claims,” of which plaintiffs prevailed on fewer than half. Id. at 6-7. Plaintiffs\n\nargue that they achieved “substantial success” with their lawsuit, to the extent that they are\n\nentitled to full payment of attorneys’ fees. Mot. for SJ at 6. As to those issues for which the\n\nHearing Officer did not find for the plaintiffs, plaintiffs allege that the fees should be awarded in\n\nfull because the issues presented at the hearing are interconnected such that hours worked on\n\ndifferent issues cannot be segregated from one another. Id. at 8.\n\n       The court rejects plaintiffs’ argument that, because the issues in this case are\n\ninterconnected, that entitles them to an attorneys’ fee award for all of the hours reasonably spent\n\non the litigation as a whole.\n\n       The case governing awards of attorneys’ fees to partially successful plaintiffs is Hensley\n\nv. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424 (1983). The Supreme Court acknowledged in Hensley that, if a\n\nplaintiff has achieved only partial success, “the product of hours reasonably expended on the\n\nlitigation as a whole times a reasonable hourly rate may be an excessive amount.” Id. at 436.\n\n“There is no precise rule or formula for making these determinations.” Id. A court “may attempt\n\nto identify specific hours that should be eliminated, or it may simply reduce the award to account\n\nfor the limited success.” Id. at 436-37. That is, if a plaintiff prevails on interconnected claims,\n\n“did the plaintiff achieve a level of success that makes the hours reasonably expended a\n\nsatisfactory basis for making a fee award?” Id. at 434. The court “should focus on the\n\n\n                                                  8\n\fsignificance of the overall relief obtained by the plaintiff in relation to the hours reasonably\n\nexpended on litigation.” Id. Therefore, it is the degree of the plaintiff’s success that is the critical\n\nfactor to the determination of the size of a reasonable fee. Texas State Teachers Assoc. v.\n\nGarland Indep. Sch. Dist., 489 U.S. 782, 876 (1989).\n\n        The court finds that plaintiffs were not “substantially successful” to an extent that would\n\njustify attorneys’ fees equal to the “product of hours reasonably expended on the litigation as a\n\nwhole times a reasonable hourly rate.” Hensley, 461 U.S. at 436. The relief plaintiffs requested\n\nwas for retroactive payment of the tuition at Kingsbury for the 2009-10 school year, and\n\nprospective payment of tuition at Kingsbury for the forthcoming school year; plaintiffs succeeded\n\nonly in obtaining tuition for the latter half of the 2009-10 school year. Thus, it appears to the\n\ncourt that plaintiffs attained only half of the relief they sought. Therefore, this court will impose\n\na reduction of 50 percent on the final award of attorneys’ fees.\n\n        B.      Hours expended\n\n        Defendant objects to plaintiffs’ claims for fees that it argues are “too remote in time or\n\nunrelated to the proceeding.” Def.’s Opp. at 15. Plaintiffs filed their due process complaint on\n\nApril 29, 2010, but billing records date back as far as January 29, 2009. Mot. for SJ, Exh. B. at 2.\n\nDefendant argues that actions dating back that far are not directly related to the administrative\n\nproceeding, and the charges should be denied. Def.’s Opp. at 16.\n\n        Having reviewed plaintiffs’ claimed charges, the court finds that there are two issues that\n\nneed to be considered: whether certain charges are available under the statute, and whether the\n\nremaining charges are too remote from the hearing.\n\n                1.      Charges related to IEP meetings\n\n        While attorneys’ fees are available under Section 1415(i)(3)(B) of the IDEA, Section\n\n\n                                                   9\n\f1415(i)(3)(D) places prohibitions on recovery of attorneys’ fees and costs for certain services. 20\n\nU.S.C. § 1415(i)(3)(D). Relevant to this case is Section 1415(i)(3)(D)(ii), which disallows fees\n\n“relating to any meeting of the IEP Team unless such meeting is convened as a result of an\n\nadministrative proceeding or judicial action.” 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(3)(D)(ii).\n\n       Plaintiffs’ billing includes charges which are clearly related to IEP meetings that took\n\nplace in 2009. One charge is for the work of Corey Craun on October 14, 2009, for thirty\n\nminutes. Mot. for SJ, Exh. B at 1. A charge by Paula Rosenstock on July 27, 2009, charges one\n\nhour to “Pre-hearing conference, follow up scheduling, draft letter to school system re:\n\nupcoming IEP meeting.” Id., Exh. B at 6. On November 16, 2009, Ms. Rosenstock charged six\n\nhours for “IEP meeting, travel;” on December 9, 2009, she charged five hours to “Attend IEP\n\nmeeting, travel.” Id., Exh. B at 8. All of these charges will be disallowed.\n\n       After adding together the total charges related to IEP meetings, the court has determined\n\nthat a reduction of one-half hour of Mr. Craun’s time and 12 hours of Ms. Rosenstock’s time is\n\nappropriate in light of the statutory prohibition.\n\n               2.      Whether certain charges are too remote in time\n\n       Where it is alleged that services were performed too remote in time to be eligible for\n\nreimbursement, plaintiffs’ counsel must provide sufficient explanation to tie the charges to the\n\neventual administrative hearing. Czarniewy v. District of Columbia, Case No. 02-CV-1496, U.S.\n\nDist. LEXIS 5161, at *12 (D.D.C. Mar. 25, 2005).\n\n       Having reviewed plaintiffs’ billing records, minus the charges related to IEP meetings\n\ndiscussed above, the court is satisfied that the charges are related to the resulting due process\n\nhearing. As noted in Lax, given sufficient documentation a year or more is “an entirely\n\nreasonable window of time to be engaging in productive work that will result in a favorable\n\n\n                                                     10\n\fadministrative decision.” Lax v. District of Columbia, Case No. 04-CV-1940, 2006 U.S. Dist.\n\nLEXIS 46888, at *17 (D.D.C. July 12, 2006) (citation omitted). The plaintiffs have submitted an\n\ninvoice that is sufficiently detailed to permit this court to determine that the hours claimed were\n\nrelated to the administrative hearing. It is clear that plaintiffs’ counsel were building their case\n\nconcerning A.S. for some time prior to the due process hearing, particularly considering\n\nplaintiffs’ early dissatisfaction with the decisions made by DCPS with regard to A.S. The court\n\nwill not disallow any charges on the basis of their being “remote in time.”\n\n         C.       Hourly rates\n\n                  1.       The Laffey Matrix is appropriate\n\n         Plaintiffs seek fees for counsel Michael Eig at an hourly rate of $425; they seek fees for\n\ncounsel Paula Rosenstock at an hourly rate of $325. Mot. for SJ, Exh. B [dkt. #11-4] at 3-11.\n\nPlaintiffs rely on the fact that these rates are consistent with (and, in some cases, below) the rates\n\nin the Laffey Matrix, as updated and maintained by the Civil Division of the United States\n\nAttorney’s Office for the District of Columbia. Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, 746 F.2d 4, 12-14\n\n(D.D.C. 1994).7 The Matrix “sets out compensable billing rates for attorneys in the District of\n\nColumbia and has been adopted by the judges of this District in many cases.” Bucher, 777 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 74.\n\n         Defendant objects that Laffey is inappropriate in IDEA cases, because the Laffey Matrix\n\nrepresents prevailing attorneys’ hourly rates for complex federal litigation. Defendant argues that\n\nplaintiffs must offer greater justification for claiming the Laffey rates, noting that, “when IDEA\n\nhearings are uncomplicated, courts have held the Matrix inapplicable.” Def.’s Opp. at 13 (citing\n\nAgapito v. District of Columbia, 525 F. Supp. 2d 150, 152 (D.D.C. 2007)). Instead, defendant\n\n7\n The current Laffey Matrix may be viewed at http://www.justice.gov/usao/dc/divisions/civil.html (last visited Jan.\n30, 2012).\n\n                                                         11\n\fclaims, the appropriate measure for Plaintiffs’ counsel’s hourly rate for IDEA litigation is the rate\n\nestablished by DCPS Attorney Fee Guidelines.\n\n       The cases have been mixed on this issue. This court finds that the determination must be\n\nmade in a case by case analysis. The cases that apply DCPS rates tend to involve uncomplicated\n\nproceedings. In McClam v. District of Columbia, Case. No. 11-CV-381, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS\n\n99518 (D.D.C. Sept. 6, 2011), the court determined that “the type of straightforward preparation\n\nordinarily required for an IDEA due process hearing” did not merit reimbursement at the Laffey\n\nlevel. Id., at *9. However, not all IDEA administrative hearings are uncomplicated. In Bucher v.\n\nDistrict of Columbia, Judge Kessler applied the Laffey Matrix and distinguished Agapito from\n\nthe case before her, where the hearing “lasted twenty-seven hours over four days,” and where the\n\n“Hearing Officer considered forty-two proposed exhibits.” Bucher, 777 F. Supp. 2d at 74.\n\n       The case before this court was not “uncomplicated.” Like Bucher, the hearing took place\n\nover four days, involved 105 proposed exhibits, and the testimony of ten witnesses (seven of\n\nwhom were offered by DCPS). H.O. Det. at 2. The Hearing Officer’s Determination itself is\n\ntwenty-eight pages long. This was not a “straightforward” due process hearing, but clearly\n\ninvolved complex issues concerning A.S.’s disability and placement. Therefore, the court finds\n\nthat using the Laffey Matrix is appropriate.\n\n               2.      Inadequately supported billing rates\n\n       In their Opposition, defendant points out that plaintiffs failed to provide any supporting\n\ndocumentation for four of the individuals who appear in their billing records: Corey Craun,\n\nJanene Jackson, Anjali Prakash, and Megan Gorzynski. Defendant argues that the court “cannot\n\nproperly conclude that any rate is proper for these individuals.” Def.’s Opp. at 8-9 (emphasis in\n\noriginal). Plaintiffs fail to respond to the argument concerning these individuals in their reply.\n\n\n                                                 12\n\f           As defendant notes, case law demonstrates that, in cases where plaintiffs fail to provide\n\nany information regarding the level of experience or education of paralegals, the court reduces\n\nthe rate by twenty-five percent. Role Models Am., Inc. v. Brownlee, 353 F.3d 962, 970 (D.C.Cir.\n\n2004). Furthermore, where plaintiffs fail to provide any information regarding the level of\n\nexperience, reputation, or education of an attorney, this court has reduced that rate to the lowest\n\nlevel—that of a paralegal or law clerk—and then further reduced the rate by twenty-five percent.\n\nJackson, 696 F. Supp. 2d at 105.\n\n           Plaintiffs’ billing statements show that the billing rate for Craun, Gorzynski, and Jackson\n\nwas $180 per hour. Mot. for SJ, Exh. B at 1-3. As for Prakash, her billing rate was $325 per\n\nhour, and her name appeared on the letterhead, so she was undoubtedly an attorney. Given the\n\ncomplete lack of supporting documentation for her background, it is appropriate to assign the\n\nlowest billing rate to her work.\n\n           Turning to the Laffey Matrix, the rate for paralegals and law clerks was $130 per hour\n\nfrom June 1, 2008 to May 31, 2010,8 and $135 per hour from June 1, 2010 to May 31, 2011.\n\nLaffey Matrix, 2003-2012, http://www.justice.gov/usao/dc/divisions/civil.html (last visited Jan.\n\n30, 2012). A twenty-five percent reduction in these rates results in a rate of $97.50 per hour\n\nduring the earlier period, and $101.25 per hour during the later period. While this reduction may\n\nseem drastic, the court reminds plaintiffs that they had the burden of substantiating all charges,\n\nand they failed to meet that burden. The court will adjust the fees accordingly.\n\n           D.      Costs\n\n           Defendant argues that a reduction in the costs requested by plaintiffs is appropriate. First,\n\ndefendant claims that charges remote in time from the filing of the due process claim should be\n\n\n8\n    The rates did not change from the 2008-2009 matrix to the 2009-2010 Matrix.\n\n                                                         13\n\fdisallowed. Def.’s Opp. at 17. In addition, defendant argues that charges for faxing and\n\novernighting services should be disallowed, “pursuant to DCPS’ guidelines.” Id. Finally,\n\ndefendant reduced plaintiffs’ photocopying costs from $0.35 to $0.15 per page, without further\n\nexplanation. Id.\n\n       This court has rejected defendant’s arguments as to the remoteness in time of certain\n\ncharges as to attorneys’s fees, and it will reject them on the basis of costs. Likewise, the court\n\nwill reject defendant’s use of DCPS’ guidelines, as this court has declined to adopt those\n\nguidelines. As defendant offers no explanation for the reduction in photocopying costs, the court\n\nwill not consider the reduction. However, the court will reduce costs by 50 percent, in line with\n\nthe reduction made to attorneys’ fees based on plaintiffs’ level of success.\n\nIV.    CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, it is, hereby,\n\n       ORDERED that Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED in part.\n\n       The court will discount plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees for the following: (1) unsupported fees\n\nfor Corey Craun, Janene Jackson, Anjali Prakash, and Megan Gorzynski; and (2) fees charged in\n\nconnection with preparing for or attending IEP meetings. The court will also make an overall\n\npercentage reduction to fees and costs based on the degree to which plaintiffs were not successful\n\nin their claims for relief.

Before the court at this time is Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment [dkt. #11] (“Mot. for SJ”). Plaintiffs allege that they are entitled to additional fees\n\nfrom the District of Columbia Public Schools (hereinafter “DCPS”) in the amount of $49,709.22.\n\nMot. for SJ at 2.

Findings of Fact2\n\n         Plaintiff A.S., now thirteen years old, is a child residing in the District of Columbia who\n\n\n\n1\n  W hile defendant disputes whether plaintiff prevailed on “certain claims,” defendant’s reimbursement of $12,776.85\nof plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees and costs indicates that defendant does not dispute that plaintiffs were prevailing parties\nto an extent sufficient to qualify to recover attorneys’ fees under the statute. Defendant’s Opposition to Plaintiffs’\nMotion for Summary Judgment [dkt. #12] (hereinafter “Def.’s Opp.”). at 1\n\n2\n Unless otherwise noted, the facts set forth herein are drawn from the parties’ statements of undisputed material facts\nsubmitted pursuant to Local Rule 7(h) and from the Hearing Officer’s Determination.\n\fwas found eligible in 2008 for special education and related services as a child with a disability\n\nunder the IDEA. Hearing Officer’s Determination [dkt. #11-3] (hereinafter “H.O. Det.”) at 4, ¶¶\n\n1, 4. A.S. was been diagnosed at that time with a “Specific Learning Disability” and “Other\n\nHealth Impairment.” Id., ¶ 2.\n\n       A.S. struggled academically and experienced behavioral difficulties at his charter school\n\nduring the 2008-2009 school year. In light of A.S.’s continued difficulties at the charter school,\n\nin early 2009, his parents applied for and secured placement for A.S. at Kingsbury Day School, a\n\nprivate school. Id. at 5, ¶¶ 6, 8; Plaintiffs’ Statement of Undisputed Material Facts [dkt. #11-1]\n\n(“Pltfs’ SOF”) ¶ 5.\n\n       On February 10, 2009, A.S.’s multi-disciplinary team (hereinafter “MDT”) convened a\n\nmeeting at the charter school to conduct an annual review of A.S.’s individualized education\n\nprogram (hereinafter “IEP”).” At that meeting, A.S.’s parents reported that his pediatrician had\n\nrecently diagnosed him with ADHD. While the MDT added the particular disability\n\nclassification to A.S.’s IEP in light of the diagnosis, “goals and objectives to address weaknesses\n\nin attention, organization, and/or other areas affected by his ADHD were not developed at [that]\n\ntime.” Under the IEP, A.S. remained at the charter school. H.O. Det. at 6, , ¶¶ 10-11. Following\n\nthe February IEP meeting, A.S.’s parents sent a letter through counsel formally rejecting the IEP\n\nand proposed placement, and requesting public funding for A.S.’s attendance at Kingsbury. A.S.\n\ncompleted the 2008-2009 school year at the charter school, but “his behavioral difficulties\n\ncontinued to impact his ability to make academic progress.” Id. at 7, ¶¶ 14, 16.\n\n       In June 2009, plaintiffs’ counsel wrote to the charter school and DCPS expressing\n\nconcerns about A.S.’s educational program at the charter school, and requesting another\n\nMDT/IEP team meeting. Id., ¶ 17. In early July 2009, the charter school sent A.S.’s parents\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fletters of invitation for an MDT/IEP team meeting on July 14, 2009. The meeting was canceled\n\nwhen A.S.’s parents provided the school with a lengthy independent evaluation report on July 13,\n\n2009. Id. at 8, ¶ 19.\n\n        On July 20, 2009, A.S.’s parents filed a due process complaint against DCPS, and a\n\nresolution meeting was held on July 27, 2009. DCPS agreed to conduct additional assessments\n\nbefore discussing any changes in programming and placement. DCPS sent an invitation to\n\nconvene an MDT/IEP team meeting on or about July 22, 2009, but A.S.’s parents declined the\n\nmeeting. On or about August 10, 2009, A.S.’s parents wrote to the charter school and DCPS\n\ninforming them that A.S. would attend Kingsbury during the 2009-2010 school year, and\n\nnotifying DCPS of their intent to seek public funding for this placement. A.S.’s parents\n\nresponded to subsequent invitations to convene an MDT/IEP team meeting by informing the\n\ncharter school and DCPS that they wished to wait for the completion of all evaluations before\n\nreturning to such a meeting. Id., ¶¶ 20-22.\n\n        On or about September 2, 2009, A.S. began attending Kingsbury. Id. at 9, ¶ 25. The team\n\nreconvened on or about November 16, 2009 to discuss A.S.’s speech and language evaluation;\n\nthe IEP team ultimately decided that A.S. did not require speech and language services. A.S.’s\n\nparents did not agree with the outcome of that meeting. Id. at 9-10, ¶ 29.\n\n        On December 9, 2009, the team reconvened to finalize the IEP. As a result of that\n\nmeeting, the team developed a revised IEP; however, the team did not discuss school placement\n\noptions or propose a specific school placement for A.S.’s parents to consider. Instead, a DCPS\n\nrepresentative informed A.S.’s parents that A.S.’s IEP would be sent to a DCPS “cluster\n\nsupervisor” for a determination of placement. A.S.’s parents’ request to participate in the\n\nplacement discussion was rejected. In fact, the individuals who met to discuss A.S.’s school\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fplacement subsequent to the December IEP meeting, including the Compliance Case Manager\n\nand a DCPS “cluster supervisor,” had no personal knowledge of A.S., and had never observed\n\nhim. A.S.’s parents were unable to participate in the decisions concerning A.S.’s placement, and\n\nthey did not receive a finalized copy of the IEP for several weeks following the December 2009\n\nmeeting. Id. at 10-11, ¶¶ 30-36.\n\n       In March 2010, A.S.’s parents, after visiting the school placement that had been proposed\n\nby DCPS, concluded that the program was not appropriate. A.S. would have been the only fifth-\n\ngrade student in a classroom of older students, and he would have received only fifteen hours per\n\nweek of specialized instruction, whereas A.S.’s IEP recommended nineteen hours. Id. at 12-13,\n\n¶¶ 37-39.\n\n       On April 29, 2010, A.S.’s parents filed an administrative appeal on his behalf. Pltfs’ SOF\n\n¶ 2. On May 11, 2010, the parties engaged in an unsuccessful dispute resolution meeting. A Due\n\nProcess Hearing was held before Hearing Officer Bruce Ryan. The hearing took place in four\n\nsessions: June 17, 18, and 30, and July 2, 2010. There was testimony from three witnesses for\n\npetitioner and seven witnesses for DCPS. H.O. Det. at 2.\n\n       At the hearing, plaintiffs claimed DCPS denied a Free and Appropriate Public Education\n\n(hereinafter “FAPE”) to A.S. by failing to evaluate him, by failing to provide an appropriate IEP\n\nin February 2009, by failing to propose an appropriate placement in February 2009, by failing to\n\nfind him eligible for speech and language services, by proposing an “inappropriate level of\n\nservice” and an inappropriate placement proposal following the December 2009 IEP meeting,\n\nand by committing various procedural violations. As relief for the alleged denials of FAPE,\n\nplaintiffs sought reimbursement for the costs of attending Kingsbury for the 2009-10 school year\n\nand prospective placement at Kingsbury. Id. at 3-4. On July 19, 2010, Hearing Officer Ryan\n\n\n                                                4\n\fissued his written determination.\n\n       The Hearing Officer determined that plaintiffs failed to show a denial of FAPE on the\n\nbasis of a failure to evaluate A.S., a failure to propose an appropriate placement in February\n\n2009, or a denial of speech and language services. The hearing officer found that plaintiffs did\n\nshow a denial of FAPE in part based on the lack of appropriateness of the February 2009 IEP, as\n\nwell as for certain procedural violations and based on the inappropriate December 2009 IEP and\n\ninappropriate placement proposal. Id. at 14. As to the relief requested, Hearing Officer Ryan\n\ngranted retroactive reimbursement for the latter half of the 2009-10 school year at Kingsbury, but\n\ndenied it for the first half. He determined that, prior to the 2009-10 school year, A.S.’s parents\n\nhad specifically requested that the parties wait for completion of all further evaluations before\n\nreturning to an IEP meeting; in the meantime, however, A.S. was already enrolled at Kingsbury.\n\nFurthermore, Hearing Officer Ryan found that evidence suggested that A.S.’s parents may have\n\npredetermined [A.S.’s] placement at Kingsbury as early as February 2009, long before the\n\nevaluations were completed. The Hearing Officer agreed with DCPS that “such predetermined\n\ncourse of action” was “unreasonable under the circumstances and acted to deprive DCPS of a fair\n\nopportunity to evaluate” A.S. Id. at 26-27.\n\n       As for prospective placement, the Hearing Officer concluded that plaintiffs had not\n\ndemonstrated in the hearing “that a full-time, out of general education placement at the Private\n\nSchool, going forward, is necessary and appropriately tailored to meet the specific needs of the\n\nStudent.” He also determined that “relative equities” suggested that DCPS should have a further\n\nopportunity to convene an IEP team meeting, including A.S.’s parents, to discuss an appropriate\n\nplacement for the 2010-11 school year. However, in the event that DCPS did not complete the\n\nprocess prior to the beginning of the next school year, DCPS would be obligated to fund A.S.’s\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fattendance at Kingsbury until his educational placement changed. Id. at 27-28.3\n\n         On July 27, 2010, plaintiffs sent a letter and supporting documentation to DCPS\n\nrequesting $62,486.07 for attorneys’ fees and costs sustained during the administrative action.\n\nPltfs’ SOF at ¶ 7. DCPS responded on August 24, 2010 by authorizing a check for\n\nreimbursement for attorneys’ fees and costs in the amount of $12,776.85. Id. at ¶ 8.\n\n         B.       Procedural History\n\n         On September 30, 2010, plaintiffs filed their Complaint [dkt. #1], which alleged that\n\nDCPS had not reimbursed any of the attorneys’ fees and costs to which plaintiffs were entitled.\n\nComplaint ¶ 11. On October 7, 2010, plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint [dkt. #3], which\n\nsupplemented the claims with the information that DCPS had issued a check for reimbursement\n\non September 30, 2010, in the amount of $12,776.85; however, plaintiffs claimed, a balance of\n\n$49,709.22 remained. Amended Complaint ¶ 11.4 On July 13, 2011, plaintiffs filed their motion\n\nfor summary judgment.5\n\nII.      LEGAL STANDARD\n\n         Under Section 1415(i)(3)(B) of the IDEA, federal district courts have the authority to\n\n“award reasonable attorneys’ fees as part of the costs to a prevailing party who is the parent of a\n\nchild with a disability.” 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(3)(B)(I). The court must initially determine whether\n\n\n\n3\n An IEP meeting was convened prior to the 2010-11 school year; A.S. was formally placed at Kingsbury as a result\nof the meeting. Mot. for SJ at 8 n.3. That determination has no bearing on this court’s decision.\n\n4\n  On November 16, 2010, then-defendant Adrian Fenty filed a Motion to Dismiss [dkt. #4]. Judge W alton granted\nthe motion, to which plaintiffs filed no opposition, on April 27, 2011. Order [dkt. #7].\n\n5\n  On September 7, 2011, the same day plaintiffs filed their reply brief [dkt. #15] (hereinafter “Reply”), defendant\nfiled a Notice of Supplemental Authority [dkt. #16], drawing the court’s attention to two recent cases. As plaintiffs\nnote in their reply to the Notice [dkt. #17], the document appears to be more a supplemental memorandum of law\nthan a “notice.” Id. at 1-2. Defendant did not request permission to file a surreply, which is what this document\nappears to be. W hile the court may address the cases noted by defendant, it will not consider the parties’ arguments\nin the Notice and reply in its decision.\n\n                                                          6\n\fthe party seeking attorney’s fees is the prevailing party. Jackson v. District of Columbia, 696 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 97, 101 (D.D.C. 2010).6 If a party has prevailed to some degree, it is eligible for\n\nattorneys’ fees; however, the court may determine that a reduction in fees is appropriate if a party\n\nis only partially successful. See Hensley v. Eckerhart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110929\"><a href=\"/opinion/110929/hensley-v-eckerhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 434 (1983).\n\n         Once the court has made its determination as to whether a party has prevailed and the\n\nextent to which it has prevailed, it must determine whether the attorneys’ fees being sought are\n\nreasonable. Jackson, 696 F. Supp. at 101. “The most useful starting point for determining the\n\namount of a reasonable fee is the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation\n\nmultiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.” Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433.\n\n         A plaintiff bears the burden of showing that both the number of hours expended on\n\nparticular tasks and the hourly rate are reasonable.

Cir. 1995)).\n\n\n\n\n6\n As set forth supra at footnote 1, there is no issue as to whether plaintiffs prevailed at all, rendering them eligible for\nattorneys’ fees. The issue in this case is the degree to which plaintiffs were successful.\n\n                                                             7\n\fIII.   ANALYSIS\n\n       A.      Extent of plaintiffs’ success\n\n       While defendant does not dispute that plaintiff prevailed in part, defendant argues that\n\nplaintiffs’ full fee request is not reasonable based on the limited number of issues on which\n\nplaintiff prevailed. Def.’s Opp. at 1. Defendants allege that the administrative litigation\n\nconcerned six “claims,” of which plaintiffs prevailed on fewer than half. Id. at 6-7. Plaintiffs\n\nargue that they achieved “substantial success” with their lawsuit, to the extent that they are\n\nentitled to full payment of attorneys’ fees. Mot. for SJ at 6. As to those issues for which the\n\nHearing Officer did not find for the plaintiffs, plaintiffs allege that the fees should be awarded in\n\nfull because the issues presented at the hearing are interconnected such that hours worked on\n\ndifferent issues cannot be segregated from one another. Id. at 8.\n\n       The court rejects plaintiffs’ argument that, because the issues in this case are\n\ninterconnected, that entitles them to an attorneys’ fee award for all of the hours reasonably spent\n\non the litigation as a whole.\n\n       The case governing awards of attorneys’ fees to partially successful plaintiffs is Hensley\n\nv. Eckerhart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110929\"><a href=\"/opinion/110929/hensley-v-eckerhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1983). The Supreme Court acknowledged in Hensley that, if a\n\nplaintiff has achieved only partial success, “the product of hours reasonably expended on the\n\nlitigation as a whole times a reasonable hourly rate may be an excessive amount.” Id. at 436.\n\n“There is no precise rule or formula for making these determinations.” Id. A court “may attempt\n\nto identify specific hours that should be eliminated, or it may simply reduce the award to account\n\nfor the limited success.” Id. at 436-37. That is, if a plaintiff prevails on interconnected claims,\n\n“did the plaintiff achieve a level of success that makes the hours reasonably expended a\n\nsatisfactory basis for making a fee award?” Id. at 434. The court “should focus on the\n\n\n                                                  8\n\fsignificance of the overall relief obtained by the plaintiff in relation to the hours reasonably\n\nexpended on litigation.” Id. Therefore, it is the degree of the plaintiff’s success that is the critical\n\nfactor to the determination of the size of a reasonable fee. Texas State Teachers Assoc. v.\n\nGarland Indep. Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112225\"><a href=\"/opinion/112225/texas-teachers-assn-v-garland-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">782</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 876 (1989).\n\n        The court finds that plaintiffs were not “substantially successful” to an extent that would\n\njustify attorneys’ fees equal to the “product of hours reasonably expended on the litigation as a\n\nwhole times a reasonable hourly rate.” Hensley, 461 U.S. at 436. The relief plaintiffs requested\n\nwas for retroactive payment of the tuition at Kingsbury for the 2009-10 school year, and\n\nprospective payment of tuition at Kingsbury for the forthcoming school year; plaintiffs succeeded\n\nonly in obtaining tuition for the latter half of the 2009-10 school year. Thus, it appears to the\n\ncourt that plaintiffs attained only half of the relief they sought. Therefore, this court will impose\n\na reduction of 50 percent on the final award of attorneys’ fees.\n\n        B.      Hours expended\n\n        Defendant objects to plaintiffs’ claims for fees that it argues are “too remote in time or\n\nunrelated to the proceeding.” Def.’s Opp. at 15. Plaintiffs filed their due process complaint on\n\nApril 29, 2010, but billing records date back as far as January 29, 2009. Mot. for SJ, Exh. B. at 2.\n\nDefendant argues that actions dating back that far are not directly related to the administrative\n\nproceeding, and the charges should be denied. Def.’s Opp. at 16.\n\n        Having reviewed plaintiffs’ claimed charges, the court finds that there are two issues that\n\nneed to be considered: whether certain charges are available under the statute, and whether the\n\nremaining charges are too remote from the hearing.\n\n                1.      Charges related to IEP meetings\n\n        While attorneys’ fees are available under Section 1415(i)(3)(B) of the IDEA, Section\n\n\n                                                   9\n\f1415(i)(3)(D) places prohibitions on recovery of attorneys’ fees and costs for certain services. 20\n\nU.S.C. § 1415(i)(3)(D). Relevant to this case is Section 1415(i)(3)(D)(ii), which disallows fees\n\n“relating to any meeting of the IEP Team unless such meeting is convened as a result of an\n\nadministrative proceeding or judicial action.” 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(3)(D)(ii).\n\n       Plaintiffs’ billing includes charges which are clearly related to IEP meetings that took\n\nplace in 2009. One charge is for the work of Corey Craun on October 14, 2009, for thirty\n\nminutes. Mot. for SJ, Exh. B at 1. A charge by Paula Rosenstock on July 27, 2009, charges one\n\nhour to “Pre-hearing conference, follow up scheduling, draft letter to school system re:\n\nupcoming IEP meeting.” Id., Exh. B at 6. On November 16, 2009, Ms. Rosenstock charged six\n\nhours for “IEP meeting, travel;” on December 9, 2009, she charged five hours to “Attend IEP\n\nmeeting, travel.” Id., Exh. B at 8. All of these charges will be disallowed.\n\n       After adding together the total charges related to IEP meetings, the court has determined\n\nthat a reduction of one-half hour of Mr. Craun’s time and 12 hours of Ms. Rosenstock’s time is\n\nappropriate in light of the statutory prohibition.\n\n               2.      Whether certain charges are too remote in time\n\n       Where it is alleged that services were performed too remote in time to be eligible for\n\nreimbursement, plaintiffs’ counsel must provide sufficient explanation to tie the charges to the\n\neventual administrative hearing. Czarniewy v. District of Columbia, Case No. 02-CV-1496, U.S.\n\nDist. LEXIS 5161, at *12 (D.D.C. Mar. 25, 2005).\n\n       Having reviewed plaintiffs’ billing records, minus the charges related to IEP meetings\n\ndiscussed above, the court is satisfied that the charges are related to the resulting due process\n\nhearing. As noted in Lax, given sufficient documentation a year or more is “an entirely\n\nreasonable window of time to be engaging in productive work that will result in a favorable\n\n\n                                                     10\n\fadministrative decision.” Lax v. District of Columbia, Case No. 04-CV-1940, 2006 U.S. Dist.\n\nLEXIS 46888, at *17 (D.D.C. July 12, 2006) (citation omitted). The plaintiffs have submitted an\n\ninvoice that is sufficiently detailed to permit this court to determine that the hours claimed were\n\nrelated to the administrative hearing. It is clear that plaintiffs’ counsel were building their case\n\nconcerning A.S. for some time prior to the due process hearing, particularly considering\n\nplaintiffs’ early dissatisfaction with the decisions made by DCPS with regard to A.S. The court\n\nwill not disallow any charges on the basis of their being “remote in time.”\n\n         C.       Hourly rates\n\n                  1.       The Laffey Matrix is appropriate\n\n         Plaintiffs seek fees for counsel Michael Eig at an hourly rate of $425; they seek fees for\n\ncounsel Paula Rosenstock at an hourly rate of $325. Mot. for SJ, Exh. B [dkt. #11-4] at 3-11.\n\nPlaintiffs rely on the fact that these rates are consistent with (and, in some cases, below) the rates\n\nin the Laffey Matrix, as updated and maintained by the Civil Division of the United States\n\nAttorney’s Office for the District of Columbia. Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">746</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 12-14\n\n(D.D.C. 1994).7 The Matrix “sets out compensable billing rates for attorneys in the District of\n\nColumbia and has been adopted by the judges of this District in many cases.” Bucher, 777 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 74.\n\n         Defendant objects that Laffey is inappropriate in IDEA cases, because the Laffey Matrix\n\nrepresents prevailing attorneys’ hourly rates for complex federal litigation. Defendant argues that\n\nplaintiffs must offer greater justification for claiming the Laffey rates, noting that, “when IDEA\n\nhearings are uncomplicated, courts have held the Matrix inapplicable.” Def.’s Opp. at 13 (citing\n\nAgapito v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1691794\"><a href=\"/opinion/1691794/agapito-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">150</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 152 (D.D.C. 2007)). Instead, defendant\n\n7\n The current Laffey Matrix may be viewed at http://www.justice.gov/usao/dc/divisions/civil.html (last visited Jan.\n30, 2012).\n\n                                                         11\n\fclaims, the appropriate measure for Plaintiffs’ counsel’s hourly rate for IDEA litigation is the rate\n\nestablished by DCPS Attorney Fee Guidelines.\n\n       The cases have been mixed on this issue. This court finds that the determination must be\n\nmade in a case by case analysis. The cases that apply DCPS rates tend to involve uncomplicated\n\nproceedings. In McClam v. District of Columbia, Case. No. 11-CV-381, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist. LEXIS</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">99518</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.D.C. Sept. 6, 2011), the court determined that “the type of straightforward preparation\n\nordinarily required for an IDEA due process hearing” did not merit reimbursement at the Laffey\n\nlevel. Id., at *9. However, not all IDEA administrative hearings are uncomplicated. In Bucher v.\n\nDistrict of Columbia, Judge Kessler applied the Laffey Matrix and distinguished Agapito from\n\nthe case before her, where the hearing “lasted twenty-seven hours over four days,” and where the\n\n“Hearing Officer considered forty-two proposed exhibits.” Bucher, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2477637\"><a href=\"/opinion/2477637/bucher-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">777</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 74.\n\n       The case before this court was not “uncomplicated.” Like Bucher, the hearing took place\n\nover four days, involved 105 proposed exhibits, and the testimony of ten witnesses (seven of\n\nwhom were offered by DCPS). H.O. Det. at 2. The Hearing Officer’s Determination itself is\n\ntwenty-eight pages long. This was not a “straightforward” due process hearing, but clearly\n\ninvolved complex issues concerning A.S.’s disability and placement. Therefore, the court finds\n\nthat using the Laffey Matrix is appropriate.\n\n               2.      Inadequately supported billing rates\n\n       In their Opposition, defendant points out that plaintiffs failed to provide any supporting\n\ndocumentation for four of the individuals who appear in their billing records: Corey Craun,\n\nJanene Jackson, Anjali Prakash, and Megan Gorzynski. Defendant argues that the court “cannot\n\nproperly conclude that any rate is proper for these individuals.” Def.’s Opp. at 8-9 (emphasis in\n\noriginal). Plaintiffs fail to respond to the argument concerning these individuals in their reply.\n\n\n                                                 12\n\f           As defendant notes, case law demonstrates that, in cases where plaintiffs fail to provide\n\nany information regarding the level of experience or education of paralegals, the court reduces\n\nthe rate by twenty-five percent. Role Models Am., Inc. v. Brownlee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186116\"><a href=\"/opinion/186116/role-models-amer-inc-v-white-thomas/\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">962</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 970 (D.C.Cir.\n\n2004). Furthermore, where plaintiffs fail to provide any information regarding the level of\n\nexperience, reputation, or education of an attorney, this court has reduced that rate to the lowest\n\nlevel—that of a paralegal or law clerk—and then further reduced the rate by twenty-five percent.\n\nJackson, 696 F. Supp. 2d at 105.\n\n           Plaintiffs’ billing statements show that the billing rate for Craun, Gorzynski, and Jackson\n\nwas $180 per hour. Mot. for SJ, Exh. B at 1-3. As for Prakash, her billing rate was $325 per\n\nhour, and her name appeared on the letterhead, so she was undoubtedly an attorney. Given the\n\ncomplete lack of supporting documentation for her background, it is appropriate to assign the\n\nlowest billing rate to her work.\n\n           Turning to the Laffey Matrix, the rate for paralegals and law clerks was $130 per hour\n\nfrom June 1, 2008 to May 31, 2010,8 and $135 per hour from June 1, 2010 to May 31, 2011.\n\nLaffey Matrix, 2003-2012, http://www.justice.gov/usao/dc/divisions/civil.html (last visited Jan.\n\n30, 2012). A twenty-five percent reduction in these rates results in a rate of $97.50 per hour\n\nduring the earlier period, and $101.25 per hour during the later period. While this reduction may\n\nseem drastic, the court reminds plaintiffs that they had the burden of substantiating all charges,\n\nand they failed to meet that burden. The court will adjust the fees accordingly.\n\n           D.      Costs\n\n           Defendant argues that a reduction in the costs requested by plaintiffs is appropriate. First,\n\ndefendant claims that charges remote in time from the filing of the due process claim should be\n\n\n8\n    The rates did not change from the 2008-2009 matrix to the 2009-2010 Matrix.\n\n                                                         13\n\fdisallowed. Def.’s Opp. at 17. In addition, defendant argues that charges for faxing and\n\novernighting services should be disallowed, “pursuant to DCPS’ guidelines.” Id. Finally,\n\ndefendant reduced plaintiffs’ photocopying costs from $0.35 to $0.15 per page, without further\n\nexplanation. Id.\n\n       This court has rejected defendant’s arguments as to the remoteness in time of certain\n\ncharges as to attorneys’s fees, and it will reject them on the basis of costs. Likewise, the court\n\nwill reject defendant’s use of DCPS’ guidelines, as this court has declined to adopt those\n\nguidelines. As defendant offers no explanation for the reduction in photocopying costs, the court\n\nwill not consider the reduction. However, the court will reduce costs by 50 percent, in line with\n\nthe reduction made to attorneys’ fees based on plaintiffs’ level of success.\n\nIV.    CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, it is, hereby,\n\n       ORDERED that Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED in part.\n\n       The court will discount plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees for the following: (1) unsupported fees\n\nfor Corey Craun, Janene Jackson, Anjali Prakash, and Megan Gorzynski; and (2) fees charged in\n\nconnection with preparing for or attending IEP meetings. The court will also make an overall\n\npercentage reduction to fees and costs based on the degree to which plaintiffs were not successful\n\nin their claims for relief.
