March 10, 2016. - October 21, 2016.\n\n Present:     Gants, C.J., Spina, Cordy, Botsford, Duffly, Lenk, &\n                              Hines, JJ.2\n\n\nCivil Rights, Attorney's fees.    Practice, Civil, Attorney's\n     fees.\n\n\n\n     Civil action commenced in the Superior Court Department on\nJune 20, 2006.\n\n     Following review by this court, 463 Mass. 767 (2012), a\nmotion for attorney's fees was heard by Robert A. Cornetta, J.,\nand a motion for reconsideration was considered by him.\n\n     The Supreme Judicial Court on its own initiative\ntransferred the case from the Appeals Court.\n\n\n     William D. Saltzman for the defendants.\n     James R. Pingeon for the plaintiff.\n\n     1\n       Additional defendants, sued in their individual or\nofficial capacities, or both, include the superintendent, the\ndeputy superintendent for classification, and the former\nassistant director of classification at Souza-Baranowski\nCorrectional Center (SBCC).\n     2\n       Justices Spina, Cordy, and Duffly participated in the\ndeliberation on this case prior to their retirements.\n\f                                                                    2\n\n\n\n    GANTS, C.J.    This appeal concerns an award of attorney's\n\nfees under the Federal Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Award Act of\n\n1976, 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b), in a civil rights action brought by a\n\nMassachusetts prison inmate, Edmund LaChance.    LaChance claimed\n\nthat the defendants violated his constitutional due process\n\nrights by holding him in essentially solitary confinement in a\n\nspecial management unit (SMU) for ten months, without a hearing,\n\nwhile waiting to transfer or reclassify him.    That litigation\n\neventually resulted in our decision in LaChance v. Commissioner\n\nof Correction, 463 Mass. 767 (2012) (LaChance I), where we\n\nannounced \"for the first time that segregated confinement on\n\nawaiting action status for longer than ninety days gives rise to\n\na liberty interest entitling an inmate to notice and a hearing,\"\n\nand a written posthearing decision.   Id. at 778.   See id. at\n\n776-777.   On remand, a Superior Court judge entered declaratory\n\njudgment in favor of LaChance and awarded him $28,578.69 in\n\nattorney's fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b).    The\n\ndefendants are challenging that award in this appeal.\n\n    The principal issue before us is whether LaChance qualified\n\nfor an award of fees as a \"prevailing party\" under § 1988(b),\n\neven though he had already been discharged in 2006 from the SMU\n\ndetention that was the subject of his suit, long before he won\n\nany relief in his favor.   The defendants argue that, in these\n\f                                                                       3\n\n\ncircumstances, LaChance was not a prevailing party because the\n\ndeclaratory judgment he ultimately won was moot, and did not\n\ndirectly benefit him or materially alter his relationship with\n\nthe defendants, at the time it was entered.     We conclude,\n\nhowever, that LaChance does qualify as a prevailing party in the\n\ncircumstances of this case, where the record demonstrates that\n\n(1) the declaratory judgment he obtained was not moot when\n\nentered, because it concerned a deprivation of civil rights of\n\nshort duration that was capable of repetition against LaChance;\n\nand (2) LaChance directly benefited from that judgment at the\n\ntime it was entered.     We also reject the defendants' contention\n\nthat the judge's award of fees to LaChance was unreasonable.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the judge's award of attorney's fees and\n\ncosts to LaChance.\n\n    Background.      We briefly summarize the facts that gave rise\n\nto this litigation, which are detailed in LaChance I, 463 Mass.\n\nat 769-773.   LaChance has been in the custody of the Department\n\nof Correction (DOC) from the inception of this litigation\n\nthrough at least the submission of his brief on appeal.       During\n\nmost of this time, he was an inmate at Souza-Baranowski\n\nCorrectional Center (SBCC), a maximum security prison in\n\nShirley.   In December, 2005, he was assigned to SBCC's SMU for\n\nfourteen days as a sanction for throwing a cup of pudding at\n\nanother inmate and later threatening to harm him.     After\n\f                                                                    4\n\n\ncompleting this disciplinary detention, however, he continued to\n\nbe held in the SMU for another ten months, from January to\n\nNovember, 2006, on \"awaiting action\" status pending his\n\nreclassification or transfer to another facility.3   LaChance did\n\nnot leave the SMU and return to his previous placement until the\n\nother inmate involved in the altercation had been moved out of\n\nit.   During his ten-month detention in the SMU, LaChance was in\n\nsolitary confinement for all but a few hours per week.    He was\n\nshackled whenever he left his cell; allowed only one hour of\n\nrecreation per day, five days per week, in an unsheltered,\n\noutdoor cage; barred from educational, religious, vocational,\n\nand rehabilitative programming available to other inmates; and\n\npermitted only very limited visitation and library privileges.\n\nAlthough a prison official informally reviewed LaChance's status\n\non a weekly basis and gave him written reports of the reviews,\n\nhe was not given a hearing.\n\n      In an amended complaint filed in Superior Court in May,\n\n2008, LaChance asserted claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and G. L.\n\nc. 12, § 11I, alleging that the conditions of his SMU detention\n\n\n      3\n       In LaChance v. Commissioner of Correction, 463 Mass. 767,\n769 n.5 (2012) (LaChance I), we noted that, although \"awaiting\naction\" was not defined in Department of Correction (DOC)\nregulations pertaining to detention in a special management unit\n(SMU), the phrase was used in other contexts, generally\nreferring to confinement pending investigation or a final\nplacement or transfer decision. See 103 Code Mass. Regs.\n§ 421.06 (1994); 103 Code Mass. Regs. § 430.21(1) (2006).\n\f                                                                  5\n\n\nwere at least as harsh as those in a departmental segregation\n\nunit (DSU), but he was denied the right to a hearing guaranteed\n\nin DOC regulations governing DSU confinement.   See 103 Code\n\nMass. Regs. §§ 421.00 (1994).   He requested compensatory and\n\npunitive damages, a declaration that the defendants' actions\n\nwere unlawful, and an award of costs including reasonable\n\nattorney's fees.\n\n    On April 6, 2010, a judge granted LaChance's motion for\n\npartial summary judgment on his claims for declaratory relief.\n\nCiting our decision in Haverty v. Commissioner of Correction,\n\n437 Mass. 737 (2002), the judge concluded that LaChance's\n\nconfinement in the SMU was substantially similar to confinement\n\nin a DSU, and that the defendants violated his constitutional\n\ndue process rights by failing to provide him with the same\n\nprocedural protections afforded by the DSU regulations.\n\n    In the same order, the judge allowed in part and denied in\n\npart the defendants' cross motion for summary judgment.     The\n\njudge granted summary judgment in favor of all defendants on\n\nLaChance's claim under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, G. L.\n\nc. 12, §§ 11H and 11I, on the ground that LaChance had offered\n\nno evidence that the defendants had employed threats,\n\nintimidation, or coercion, a necessary element of that claim.\n\nSee Layne v. Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Inst., Cedar\n\nJunction, 406 Mass. 156, 158 (1989).   The judge also granted\n\f                                                                   6\n\n\nsummary judgment in favor of two defendants on LaChance's claims\n\nfor money damages against them in their official capacities\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983, because money damages against State\n\nofficials are available only if they are sued in their\n\nindividual capacities.   See Will v. Michigan Dep't of State\n\nPolice, 491 U.S. 58, 71 (1989); O'Malley v. Sheriff of Worcester\n\nCounty, 415 Mass. 132, 140-141 (1993).   The judge denied the\n\ndefendants' summary judgment motion, however, insofar as they\n\nargued that they could not be sued in their individual\n\ncapacities because they enjoyed qualified immunity as government\n\nofficials.   He reasoned that after this court's decision in\n\nHaverty, supra, it should have been clear to the defendants that\n\nthe conditions of LaChance's SMU confinement were substantially\n\nsimilar to those in a DSU and that LaChance was therefore\n\nentitled to the same procedural protections.   The judge\n\nconcluded that the defense of qualified immunity would therefore\n\nbe unavailable to the defendants if they directly participated\n\nin this violation of LaChance's clearly established rights.     See\n\nO'Malley, 415 Mass. at 142 (plaintiffs can overcome government\n\nofficials' qualified immunity defense by showing that defendants\n\ndirectly participated in violating plaintiffs' clearly\n\nestablished rights).\n\n    The defendants sought interlocutory appeal under the\n\ndoctrine of present execution from the judge's ruling on\n\f                                                                   7\n\n\nqualified immunity,4 and we transferred the case on our own\n\nmotion.   We held that the defendants were entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity and directed the Superior Court to enter summary\n\njudgment in their favor as to the damages claims against the\n\nindividual defendants under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.   We noted,\n\n\"[g]overnment officials performing discretionary functions . . .\n\ngenerally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar\n\nas their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory\n\nor constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have\n\nknown.\"   LaChance I, 463 Mass. at 777, quoting Rodriques v.\n\nFurtado, 410 Mass. 878, 882 (1991).   We concluded that it would\n\nnot have been clear to reasonable officers that their behavior\n\nviolated LaChance's due process rights, because \"neither State\n\nnor Federal law ha[d] clearly articulated the outer limit of\n\nwhat constitutes 'reasonable' segregated confinement on awaiting\n\naction status without the safeguards of procedural due process.\"\n\nLaChance I, supra at 778.\n\n\n\n     4\n       \"The doctrine of present execution is a limited exception\nto the finality rule. It permits the immediate appeal from an\ninterlocutory order if the order will interfere with rights in a\nway that cannot be remedied on appeal from a final judgment.\"\nKent v. Commonwealth, 437 Mass. 312, 315 n.6 (2002). Where a\npublic official asserts immunity from suit as a defense, a\nruling allowing the suit to proceed may be appropriate for\nappeal under the doctrine of present execution because otherwise\nthe benefits of immunity would be irrevocably lost. See Breault\nv. Chairman of the Bd. of Fire Comm'rs of Springfield, 401 Mass.\n26, 31 (1987), cert. denied, 485 Mass. 906 (1988).\n\f                                                                   8\n\n\n     We then clearly articulated the outer limit of what Federal\n\ndue process requires for reasonable segregated confinement on\n\nawaiting action status.5   We declared that, given the\n\nrestrictions imposed on LaChance in the SMU, his ten-month\n\ndetention on awaiting action status was not reasonable and gave\n\nrise to a liberty interest that was entitled to the protection\n\nof due process.   LaChance I, 463 Mass. at 775-776.   We further\n\nheld that the procedures followed by the DOC were insufficient\n\nto safeguard that interest.   We concluded that \"an inmate\n\nconfined to administrative segregation on awaiting action\n\nstatus, whether such confinement occurs in an area designated as\n\nan SMU, a DSU, or otherwise, is entitled, as a matter of due\n\nprocess, to notice of the basis on which he is so detained; a\n\nhearing at which he may contest the asserted rationale for his\n\nconfinement; and a posthearing written notice explaining the\n\nreviewing authority's classification decision.\"   Id. at 776-777.\n\nWe left it to the DOC to promulgate appropriate regulations,\n\nbalancing the inmate's interest in challenging potentially\n\narbitrary detention with prison officials' interest in securing\n\nreclassification or transfer of inmates.   But we concluded that\n\n\n     5\n       In considering the defendants' appeal in LaChance I, \"it\nwas necessary to focus on LaChance's Federal due process claims\nbecause LaChance would be entitled to damages under his § 1983\nclaims only if the defendants knowingly violated LaChance's\nrights under the United States Constitution.\" Cantell v.\nCommissioner of Correction, 475 Mass.    ,     (2016).\n\f                                                                   9\n\n\n\"in no circumstances may an inmate be held in segregated\n\nconfinement on awaiting action status for longer than ninety\n\ndays without a hearing.\"   Id. at 777.\n\n     Upon remand, a different judge6 issued an order for entry of\n\na final judgment in favor of LaChance, declaring that the\n\ndefendants had violated LaChance's constitutional due process\n\nrights by failing to provide him with the procedural protections\n\nthat we announced in LaChance I.   The judge allowed the\n\ndefendants' motion for summary judgment as to all of LaChance's\n\nremaining claims.   Final judgment was entered in accord with\n\nthis order on August 21, 2013.\n\n     LaChance subsequently requested an award of $56,504.59 in\n\nattorney's fees and $392.69 in costs under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and\n\nMass. R. Civ. P. 54, as amended, 382 Mass. 829 (1981).     The\n\njudge who had entered judgment in favor of LaChance concluded\n\nthat LaChance was a \"prevailing party\" and therefore entitled to\n\nreasonable attorney's fees under § 1988, even though he had not\n\nprevailed on his claims for money damages and no injunction had\n\nentered.   The judge held that LaChance \"clearly prevailed in\n\nproving his constitutional claim\" and \"won a significant victory\n\nfor himself as well as any other inmate that could possibly be\n\nheld in segregated confinement\" because, as a result of his\n\n\n     6\n       The judge who had decided the summary judgment motions had\nretired.\n\f                                                                  10\n\n\nlitigation, \"the DOC is not permitted to hold an inmate in\n\nsegregated confinement for longer than ninety days without\n\nproviding procedural protections.\"   The judge also concluded\n\nthat the significance of this victory was not affected by the\n\nissuance of a declaratory judgment rather than an injunction\n\nbecause \"the courts rely on public officials to comply with the\n\nlaw as judicially defined and thus, injunctive orders are\n\nredundant.\"   In determining the amount of the award, the judge\n\nfirst calculated the total amount of attorney's fees under the\n\ntraditional \"lodestar\" formula,7 and then reduced this amount\n\n($56,372) by fifty per cent to $28,186 \"due to the discrepancy\n\nbetween the claims brought and the claims won.\"   With the\n\naddition of $392.69 in costs, the judge ordered a total award of\n\n$28,578.69.\n\n     The defendants asked the judge to reconsider this award in\n\nlight of a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for\n\nthe First Circuit, Ford v. Bender, 768 F.3d 15 (1st Cir. 2014),\n\nthat issued five days after the award was entered.   In Ford, the\n\ncourt held that, where a pretrial detainee in a civil rights\n\naction obtained declaratory relief regarding his pretrial\n\ndisciplinary segregated confinement that was moot when judgment\n\nentered because the plaintiff was no longer a pretrial detainee,\n\n     7\n       The \"lodestar\" figure is derived by multiplying hours\nreasonably spent by a reasonable hourly rate. See Stratos v.\nDepartment of Pub. Welfare, 387 Mass. 312, 322 (1982).\n\f                                                                   11\n\n\nthe plaintiff was not a prevailing party, and therefore not\n\nentitled to attorney's fees and costs under § 1988.     Id. at 31.\n\nThe defendants argued that LaChance was similarly not a\n\nprevailing party because he had been discharged from the SMU\n\nbefore the declaratory relief was entered, so his declaratory\n\njudgment was moot.\n\n     The judge denied the defendants' motion for reconsideration\n\non the ground that mootness was not a new issue and could have\n\nbeen raised earlier by the defendants.    The judge further held\n\nthat, even assuming that the Ford decision changed the governing\n\nlaw, that change was not a sufficiently extraordinary\n\ncircumstance to justify reopening a final judgment under Mass.\n\nR. Civ. P. 60 (b), 365 Mass. 828 (1974).8    The defendants\n\nappealed the award of attorney's fees, and we transferred the\n\ncase on our own motion.\n\n     Discussion.     Title 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b) provides that in an\n\naction to enforce certain Federal civil rights statutes,\n\nincluding 42 U.S.C. § 1983, \"the court, in its discretion, may\n\nallow the prevailing party . . . a reasonable attorney's fee as\n\npart of the costs.\"    Section 1988 thus creates an exception to\n\nthe \"American Rule\" that litigants must ordinarily bear their\n\n\n     8\n       The court reviewed the defendants' motion for\nreconsideration under Mass. R. Civ. P. 60 (b), rather than Mass.\nR. Civ. P. 59 (e), 365 Mass. 827 (1974), because it was filed\nmore than ten days after entry of the award of fees.\n\f                                                                   12\n\n\nown attorney's fees and expenses.   By authorizing awards of fees\n\nto prevailing plaintiffs in civil rights actions, the statute\n\nserves \"to encourage suits that are not likely to pay for\n\nthemselves, but are nevertheless desirable because they\n\nvindicate important rights.\"   Stratos v. Department of Pub.\n\nWelfare, 387 Mass. 312, 323 (1982).   It \"promote[s] civil rights\n\nenforcement and . . . deter[s] civil rights violators, by\n\nencouraging private lawsuits aimed against civil rights abuses.\"\n\nKadlick v. Department of Mental Health, 431 Mass. 850, 852\n\n(2000).\n\n    \"Congress enacted § 1988 specifically because it found that\n\nthe private market for legal services failed to provide many\n\nvictims of civil rights violations with effective access to the\n\njudicial process. . . .   These victims ordinarily cannot afford\n\nto purchase legal services at the rates set by the private\n\nmarket.\"   Riverside v. Rivera, 477 U.S. 561, 576 (1986)\n\n(plurality opinion), citing H.R. Rep. No. 94-1558, at 1, 3; S.\n\nRep. No. 94-1011, at 2.   \"[Fee] awards have proved an essential\n\nremedy if private citizens are to have a meaningful opportunity\n\nto vindicate the important Congressional policies which these\n\nlaws contain. . . .   If private citizens are to be able to\n\nassert their civil rights, and if those who violate the Nation's\n\nfundamental laws are not to proceed with impunity, then citizens\n\nmust have the opportunity to recover what it costs them to\n\f                                                                      13\n\n\nvindicate these rights in court.\"    Riverside, supra at 577-578,\n\nquoting S. Rep. No. 94-1011, at 2.\n\n    Congress also recognized that a successful civil rights\n\nplaintiff acts \"not for himself alone but also as a 'private\n\nattorney general,' vindicating a policy that Congress considered\n\nof the highest importance.\"     Riverside, supra at 575, quoting\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 94-1558, at 2.    Thus, in enacting § 1988, Congress\n\nalso \"meant to promote\" a \"'private attorney general' role\" for\n\nplaintiffs in enforcing the civil rights laws.     Texas State\n\nTeachers Ass'n v. Garland Indep. Sch. Dist., 489 U.S. 782, 793\n\n(1989).\n\n    In this appeal, the defendants have challenged the judge's\n\naward of fees on two grounds.    First, they assert that the judge\n\nerred in concluding that LaChance is a prevailing party.\n\nSecond, they contend that the award of fees is excessive.        We\n\naddress each issue in turn.\n\n    1.    Prevailing party.   Whether LaChance is a \"prevailing\n\nparty\" is an issue of law that we consider de novo.     See Newell\n\nv. Department of Mental Retardation, 446 Mass. 286, 298, cert.\n\ndenied, 549 U.S. 823 (2006).    In general, under § 1988,\n\n\"plaintiffs may be considered 'prevailing parties' for\n\nattorney's fees purposes if they succeed on any significant\n\nissue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the\n\nparties sought in bringing suit.\"    Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S.\n\f                                                                   14\n\n\n103, 109 (1992), quoting Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433\n\n(1983).   Following Farrar, we have held that to qualify for an\n\naward of fees as a \"prevailing party\" under § 1988, first, a\n\ncivil rights plaintiff \"must obtain at least some relief on the\n\nmerits of his claim\"; second, the \"plaintiff must obtain an\n\nenforceable judgment against the defendant from whom fees are\n\nsought\"; and third, \"[w]hatever relief the plaintiff secures\n\nmust directly benefit him at the time of the judgment or\n\nsettlement.\"   Mendoza v. Licensing Bd. of Fall River, 444 Mass.\n\n188, 210 (2005), quoting Farrar, supra at 111.   We have further\n\nsaid that \"for a party to be considered a 'prevailing party'\n\nunder Federal fee-shifting statutes there must be a 'material\n\nalteration of the legal relationship of the parties,' . . . and\n\nthere must be a 'judicial imprimatur on the change.'\"   Newell,\n\nsupra at 297-298, quoting Buckhannon Bd. & Care Home, Inc. v.\n\nWest Virginia Dep't of Health & Human Resources, 532 U.S. 598,\n\n604, 605 (2001).   See T & D Video, Inc. v. Revere, 450 Mass.\n\n107, 108 (2007), quoting Buckhannon, supra at 605 (defining\n\n\"prevailing party\" as \"one who obtains a 'judicially sanctioned\n\nchange in the legal relationship of the parties'\").\n\n    Here, the defendants acknowledge that a declaratory\n\njudgment in favor of a plaintiff, like that won by LaChance,\n\nwill usually suffice to establish that the plaintiff is a\n\n\"prevailing party\" under § 1988. See Lefemine v. Wideman, 133 S.\n\f                                                                  15\n\n\nCt. 9, 11 (2012).   They also acknowledge that, where the\n\ndeclaratory judgment is directed to public officials, an\n\ninjunctive order is not necessary to create an enforceable\n\njudgment and confer prevailing party status on a plaintiff,\n\nbecause Massachusetts courts \"assume that public officials will\n\ncomply with the law declared by a court and that consequently\n\ninjunctive orders are generally unnecessary.\"   Massachusetts\n\nCoalition for the Homeless v. Secretary of Human Servs., 400\n\nMass. 806, 825 (1987).\n\n     The defendants contend, however, that LaChance did not\n\nqualify as a \"prevailing party\" because he was discharged from\n\nthe SMU in November, 2006, so the declaratory judgment he won\n\n(1) was moot when entered,9 and (2) did not directly benefit\n\nLaChance or materially alter his legal relationship with the\n\ndefendants.   We conclude that the declaratory judgment was not\n\nmoot when entered, and that it both directly benefited   LaChance\n\nand materially altered his legal relationship with the\n\n\n\n     9\n       As noted above, the Superior Court judge declined to\naddress the defendants' mootness argument on the merits when he\ndenied their motion for reconsideration because, in his view,\nthe defendants should have raised the issue previously but\nfailed to do so. In fact, however, the defendants presented the\nmootness argument in their opposition to LaChance's motion for\nattorney's fees. Moreover, as LaChance concedes, the defendants\nraised mootness in moving to dismiss his complaint and in\nopposing his motion for partial summary judgment. We address\nthe issue in light of those facts and because the question of\nmootness implicates the justiciability of the underlying case.\n\f                                                                   16\n\n\ndefendants, and therefore LaChance was correctly determined to\n\nbe a \"prevailing party\" under § 1988.\n\n    The concept of mootness, as applied in the Federal courts,\n\nderives from the case or controversy requirement of art. III,\n\n§ 2, cl. 1, of the United States Constitution.    Under art. III,\n\nthe subject matter jurisdiction of the Federal courts is limited\n\nto \"cases\" and \"controversies.\"   See Campbell-Ewald Co. v.\n\nGomez, 136 S. Ct. 663, 669 (2016).   To meet this jurisdictional\n\nrequirement, there must be an \"actual controversy\" between the\n\nparties at all stages of the case.   See id.; Hollingsworth v.\n\nPerry, 133 S. Ct. 2652, 2661 (2013) (\"Article III demands that\n\nan 'actual controversy' persist throughout all stages of\n\nlitigation\").   An actual controversy exists only when the\n\nparties have a \"personal stake\" in the outcome.   See Genesis\n\nHealthcare Corp. v. Symczyk, 133 S. Ct. 1523, 1528 (2013);\n\nCamreta v. Greene, 563 U.S. 692, 702 (2011) (\"So long as the\n\nlitigants possess [a] personal stake . . . , an appeal presents\n\na case or controversy . . .\").    This personal stake \"requirement\n\nensures that the Federal Judiciary confines itself to its\n\nconstitutionally limited role of adjudicating actual and\n\nconcrete disputes, the resolutions of which have direct\n\nconsequences on the parties involved.\"    Genesis Healthcare\n\nCorp., supra at 1528.   If a plaintiff's circumstances change\n\nsuch that he or she no longer has a personal stake in the\n\f                                                                  17\n\n\noutcome of the case, the case becomes moot; there is no longer\n\nan actual controversy as required for Federal court\n\njurisdiction, and the case must be dismissed.   See id. (\"If an\n\nintervening circumstance deprives the plaintiff of a 'personal\n\nstake in the outcome of the lawsuit,' at any point during\n\nlitigation, the action can no longer proceed and must be\n\ndismissed as moot\" [citation omitted]); Already, LLC v. Nike,\n\nInc., 133 S. Ct. 721, 726-727 (2013), quoting Murphy v. Hunt,\n\n455 U.S. 478, 481 (1982) (\"A case becomes moot -- and therefore\n\nno longer a 'Case' or 'Controversy' for purposes of Article III\n\n-- 'when the issues presented are no longer \"live\" or the\n\nparties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome'\").\n\n    Plaintiffs cannot ordinarily \"prevail\" under § 1988 where\n\nthe court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to enter relief in\n\ntheir favor because the case has become moot.   In Rhodes v.\n\nStewart, 488 U.S. 1 (1988), one of the principal cases cited by\n\nthe defendants, the United States Supreme Court held that two\n\nplaintiff inmates were not entitled to attorney's fees as\n\nprevailing parties under 42 U.S.C. § 1988, even though they had\n\nwon a favorable judgment, because their claims had become moot\n\nlong before the judgment entered.   The plaintiffs claimed that\n\ntheir constitutional rights had been violated by correctional\n\nofficials who had refused them permission to subscribe to a\n\nmagazine.   A Federal District Court ruled that the officials had\n\f                                                                   18\n\n\nnot applied the proper standards in denying the inmates'\n\nrequest, ordered compliance with those standards, and\n\nsubsequently awarded attorney's fees to the plaintiffs.      See id.\n\nat 2.   It later came to light, however, that one of the\n\nplaintiffs had died, and the other had been paroled and given a\n\nfinal release, long before the District Court entered its order.\n\nSee id. at 3.   Based on those facts, the Supreme Court\n\noverturned the judgment and award of attorney's fees, reasoning\n\nthat \"[a] modification of prison policies on magazine\n\nsubscriptions could not in any way have benefited either\n\nplaintiff,\" and consequently \"[t]he case was moot before\n\njudgment issued, and the judgment therefore afforded the\n\nplaintiffs no relief whatsoever.\"    Id. at 4.\n\n      Similarly, in Ford, 768 F.3d at 31, as earlier noted, the\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that\n\nthe plaintiff inmate was not entitled to an award of attorney's\n\nfees as a prevailing party under § 1988 for declaratory relief\n\nhe won in a Federal District Court arising from his pretrial\n\ndetainment because the defendant was no longer a pretrial\n\ndetainee when judgment entered.   The court reasoned that the\n\ncase was moot as to that issue when the relief was granted, so\n\nthere was no case or controversy and therefore no Federal court\n\njurisdiction to grant that relief.   See id.     See also id. at 29-\n\n30.\n\f                                                                  19\n\n\n     A case is not moot under Federal law, however, where \"it\n\nfalls within a special category of disputes that are 'capable of\n\nrepetition' while 'evading review.'\"     Turner v. Rogers, 564 U.S.\n\n431, 439 (2011), quoting Southern Pac. Terminal Co. v.\n\nInterstate Commerce Comm'n, 219 U.S. 498, 515 (1911).     \"A\n\ndispute falls into that category, and a case based on that\n\ndispute remains live, if '(1) the challenged action [is] in its\n\nduration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation\n\nor expiration, and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that\n\nthe same complaining party [will] be subjected to the same\n\naction again.'\"   Turner, supra at 439-440, quoting Weinstein v.\n\nBradford, 423 U.S. 147, 149 (1975).    The Federal requirement\n\nthat a case must be capable of repetition as to the same\n\nplaintiff ensures that the plaintiff still has an ongoing\n\npersonal stake in the matter sufficient to meet the case or\n\ncontroversy requirement of art. III.10    See United States Parole\n\n\n     10\n       The Federal courts have not always applied this\nrequirement with strict consistency. See, e.g., Honig v. Doe,\n484 U.S. 305, 335-336 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\"Roe, at\nleast one other abortion case, . . . and some of our election\nlaw decisions, . . . differ from the body of our mootness\njurisprudence . . . in dispensing with the same-party\nrequirement entirely, focusing instead upon the great likelihood\nthat the issue will recur between the defendant and the other\nmembers of the public at large\" [citations omitted]); 13C C.A.\nWright, A.R. Miller, & E.H. Cooper, Federal Practice and\nProcedure § 3533.9, at 488 (3d ed. 2008) (\"Although it has not\nbeen abandoned, the requirement that the individual plaintiff is\nlikely to be affected by a future recurrence of a mooted dispute\nhas been diluted in some cases\"; citing cases).\n\f                                                                    20\n\n\nComm'n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 398 (1980) (\"Since the\n\nlitigant faces some likelihood of becoming involved in the same\n\ncontroversy in the future, vigorous advocacy can be expected to\n\ncontinue\").   The plaintiff need only show that \"the controversy\n\nwas capable of repetition\"; the plaintiff need not show \"that a\n\nrecurrence of the dispute was more probable than not\" (emphasis\n\nin original).   Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 318 n.6 (1988).\n\n    In Turner, 564 U.S. at 440, the Supreme Court held that a\n\nfather's due process challenge to his incarceration for civil\n\ncontempt based on his failure to make child support payments was\n\nnot moot even though he had completed his twelve-month sentence,\n\nbecause his imprisonment was too short to be litigated fully\n\nbefore its expiration and there was a reasonable likelihood that\n\nhe would again be subjected to the same action.    In so holding,\n\nthe Court cited evidence that the father had been the subject of\n\nseveral civil contempt proceedings for which he had been\n\nimprisoned on several occasions, including another six-month\n\nterm imposed shortly after his release from the imprisonment at\n\nissue in his action.   See id. at 436-437, 440.   Other Federal\n\ndecisions involving plaintiff inmates have also held that their\n\ncases were not moot because the alleged wrongs were likely to\n\f                                                                 21\n\n\nrecur in the future, based on evidence that the plaintiffs had\n\nbeen repeatedly subjected to similar conditions.11\n\n     LaChance's circumstances in this case are similar to those\n\nin Turner and the other cases just cited.   LaChance has remained\n\nin DOC custody throughout the course of this litigation, and he\n\nhas demonstrated through an unrebutted affidavit that there was\n\na reasonable expectation when judgment entered that he would\n\nagain be subjected to segregated detention, because he has been\n\nrepeatedly confined in segregation units during his\n\n\n     11\n       See Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 218-219 (1990)\n(Court could properly decide case concerning administration of\nantipsychotic drugs to prisoner against his will, even though\nState had stopped doing so, because situation was likely to\nrecur; prisoner was still in custody, was still mentally ill,\nhad been twice transferred to center for treatment of felons\nwith serious mental illness, and remained subject to transfer);\nDemery v. Arpaio, 378 F.3d 1020, 1026-1027 (9th Cir. 2004),\ncert. denied, 545 U.S. 1139 (2005) (detainees' suit challenging\nsheriff's policy of placing photographs of detainees on Internet\nwhile they were held in jail awaiting trial was not moot, even\nthough they had been released from jail, because there was\nevidence that they would likely again be detained there; one\nplaintiff had been detained there twenty times, and eleven\nothers had been detained there on more than one occasion);\nLeMaire v. Maass, 12 F.3d 1444, 1462 n.5 (9th Cir. 1993)\n(prisoner's constitutional challenge to conditions in\ndisciplinary segregation unit was not moot, even though he was\nno longer being held there, because he remained under control of\nprison system, and practices and sanctions of which he\ncomplained were capable of repetition); Ferreira v. Duval, 887\nF. Supp. 374, 382 (D. Mass. 1995) (prisoner's suit alleging\nconstitutional violations during his departmental disciplinary\nunit confinement was not rendered moot by his discharge from\nunit because alleged violations were capable of repetition, yet\nevading review, where plaintiff had poor disciplinary record and\nfive years left on his prison sentence and therefore had\nreasonable expectation of again being confined in unit).\n\f                                                                 22\n\n\nincarceration.12    LaChance's affidavit also supports the\n\nconclusion that SMU detentions are too short for prisoners to\n\nobtain judicial relief before they are discharged, so that the\n\npractice would evade review if LaChance's case and others like\n\nit were dismissed on mootness grounds.\n\n     These facts distinguish LaChance's case from the cases\n\ncited by the defendants where prisoners' civil rights claims\n\nwere held to be moot, such as Rhodes v. Stewart, supra, and Ford\n\nv. Bender, supra.    The plaintiffs in those cases were either\n\ndead or released from the custody at issue when declaratory\n\njudgment entered, and therefore there was no reasonable\n\npossibility that they would again be subjected to the same\n\n     12\n        LaChance submitted the affidavit in response to the\ndefendants' motion for reconsideration of the award of\nattorney's fees. He stated that he had been placed in\nsegregation units many times during his incarceration, including\nplacement in the SMU at SBCC as a pretrial detainee for\napproximately fourteen months in 2000-2001; placement in a\nsegregation unit at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution\nat Concord as a sentenced prisoner for about three months from\nlate 2001 to early 2002; subsequent placements in the SMU at\nSBCC from September 29, 2002, to February 10, 2003, and from\nDecember 21, 2005, to November 15, 2006 (the placement\nchallenged in this action), plus \"at least a few other occasions\nin 2007-2009\" for which he did not recall the dates; placements\nin the segregation unit at the North Central Correctional\nInstitution at Gardner \"on at least three occasions,\" for which\nhe did not recall the dates; and a placement in the segregation\nunit at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Cedar\nJunction from June 5 to July 22, 2014. Although the motion\njudge did not make any findings based on LaChance's affidavit,\nthe defendants did not dispute the assertions therein, and we\nare in as good a position to assess it as the judge below. See\nGulf Oil Corp. v. Fall River Hous. Auth., 364 Mass. 492, 493\n(1974).\n\f                                                                  23\n\n\nwrongs.   Here, by contrast, LaChance was still in custody when\n\njudgment entered and, based on his prior history of segregated\n\nconfinement, there was a reasonable expectation that he would\n\nagain be returned to such confinement.13   Therefore, applying\n\nFederal principles of justiciability, the denial of due process\n\nat the SMU that was the basis of LaChance's civil rights claim\n\nwas capable of repetition as to him, so his claim was not moot\n\nwhen judgment entered.\n\n     The declaratory judgment won by LaChance also benefited him\n\nand materially altered his legal relationship with the\n\ndefendants because that judgment required the defendants to\n\nprovide him with additional procedural protections that he had\n\nnot previously received if he were again placed in segregated\n\ndetention on awaiting action status.   See Lefemine, 133 S. Ct.\n\nat 11 (where Federal District Court ruled that defendants had\n\nviolated plaintiff abortion protester's rights and enjoined them\n\n     13\n       We are mindful of the United States Supreme Court's\nobservation that, \"for purposes of assessing the likelihood that\nstate authorities will reinflict a given injury,\" it has\n\"generally . . . been unwilling to assume that the party seeking\nrelief will repeat the type of misconduct that would once again\nplace him or her at risk of that injury.\" Honig, 484 U.S. at\n320. But we note that the DOC's SMU regulations provide that an\ninmate may be placed in administrative segregation for\nnondisciplinary reasons such as pending transfer or\nclassification, pending an investigation or hearing, or for the\ninmate's own safety. 103 Code Mass. Regs. § 423.08(1) (1995).\nThus, we need not presume repeated misconduct by LaChance to\nconclude that there was a reasonable expectation when judgment\nentered that he would again be subjected to segregated\nconfinement.\n\f                                                                   24\n\n\nfrom engaging in similar conduct in future, that ruling\n\nmaterially altered parties' relationship and therefore justified\n\naward of fees because police had intended to stop plaintiff from\n\nprotesting with his signs but, as result of ruling, could not\n\nprevent him from demonstrating in that manner).   Although\n\nLaChance could only take advantage of this benefit in the\n\nfuture, it was nevertheless a tangible present benefit to him.\n\nSee Mendoza, 444 Mass. at 210-211 (judgments that invalidated\n\nadult entertainment ordinances challenged by plaintiff bar owner\n\nmaterially altered his relationship with defendants, even though\n\nhe was still barred from presenting nude dancing by limitations\n\nin zoning variance, because plaintiff was \"eligible to apply for\n\na zoning variance that would permit nude dancing\").\n\n    In short, because LaChance has adequately shown that there\n\nwas a reasonable expectation when judgment entered that he would\n\nagain be held in segregated detention on awaiting action status,\n\nhe had a sufficient ongoing interest in his suit for it not to\n\nbe moot, even if he was no longer held in the SMU when\n\ndeclaratory relief was entered in his favor.   And because he had\n\nan ongoing interest in the outcome of his suit, the favorable\n\nrulings he obtained benefited him.   We therefore conclude that,\n\neven if this case had been brought in Federal court under the\n\f                                                                25\n\n\nconstraints of Federal subject matter jurisdiction, LaChance\n\nwould qualify for an award of fees as a \"prevailing party.\"14\n\n\n     14\n       We note that, because Federal limitations on\njusticiability are grounded in the case or controversy\nlimitation in art. III of the United States Constitution, and\nbecause art. III does not apply to State courts, State courts\nremain free to define their own jurisdictional limits even when\nadjudicating Federal claims. See ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 490\nU.S. 605, 617 (1989) (\"We have recognized often that the\nconstraints of Article III do not apply to state courts, and\naccordingly the state courts are not bound by the limitations of\na case or controversy or other federal rules of justiciability\neven when they address issues of federal law, as when they are\ncalled upon to interpret the Constitution or . . . a federal\nstatute\"). In Massachusetts, \"we have on occasion answered\nquestions in moot cases where the issue was one of public\nimportance, where it was fully argued on both sides, where the\nquestion was certain, or at least very likely, to arise again in\nsimilar factual circumstances, and especially where appellate\nreview could not be obtained before the recurring question would\nagain be moot.\" Commonwealth v. Humberto H., 466 Mass. 562, 574\n(2013), quoting Lockhart v. Attorney Gen., 390 Mass. 780, 783\n(1984). Notably, under our principles of justiciability -- in\ncontrast with Federal jurisprudence -- it is not \"indispensable\nthat the case be capable of repetition in respect only to the\nparticular claimant,\" because the \"doctrine is designed to\nassist in the clarification of the law generally, and not simply\nto assist the situation of a particular party.\" Mendonza v.\nCommonwealth, 423 Mass. 771, 777 (1996).\n\n     We recognize that there is an unanswered question whether a\nplaintiff may be a \"prevailing party\" under § 1988 in a\nMassachusetts court where the plaintiff obtains a declaratory\njudgment or injunctive relief after the case became moot, even\nthough the plaintiff could not be a \"prevailing party\" had the\ncase been brought in Federal court, where mootness would have\nresulted in dismissal of the plaintiff's claims. It arguably\nwould thwart the congressional purpose in enacting § 1988 if a\nMassachusetts court were to exercise its broader subject matter\njurisdiction to allow a moot civil rights case brought under 42\nU.S.C. § 1983 to proceed to judgment where the challenged\nconduct is likely to recur against others, and then, when the\nplaintiff succeeds in obtaining a declaratory judgment or\ninjunctive relief, conclude that the plaintiff's attorneys are\n\f                                                                     26\n\n\n     2.   Reasonableness of the award of fees.   Having concluded\n\nthat LaChance was a prevailing party, we now address whether the\n\njudge abused his discretion in his award of attorney's fees.\n\nThe defendants contend that the judge abused his discretion in\n\nconcluding that $28,186 was a reasonable award of attorney's\n\nfees, because LaChance's success in relation to his goals was\n\nminimal and his attorneys devoted considerably more effort to\n\nclaims on which they failed than to those on which they\n\nsucceeded.15   We do not agree.\n\n     Section 1988(b) permits a prevailing party to recover \"a\n\nreasonable attorney's fee\" (emphasis added).     The determination\n\nof the amount of reasonable attorney's fees rests in the sound\n\ndiscretion of the judge, to be exercised in accord with certain\n\ngoverning principles.   See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 436-437;\n\nStratos, 387 Mass. at 321.   This determination should ordinarily\n\nbegin with the lodestar calculation, based on the number of\n\nhours that are reasonably expended and adequately documented,\n\nmultiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.   The judge may then\n\nadjust the lodestar calculation upward or downward in light of\n\n\n\nnot entitled to an award of attorney's fees because the\nplaintiff himself or herself did not \"prevail.\" Because the\nplaintiff here would be a \"prevailing party\" even if his case\nhad been brought in Federal court, we need not reach that\nunanswered question in this case.\n     15\n       The defendants do not challenge the $392.69 in costs\nawarded by the Superior Court.\n\f                                                                     27\n\n\nthe results obtained.    See Hensley, supra at 433-434.   Where the\n\nplaintiff has obtained only partial success, it may be feasible\n\nto exclude time devoted to claims on which the plaintiff did not\n\nsucceed.   In many civil rights cases, however, it may be\n\ndifficult to divide the hours expended on a claim-by-claim\n\nbasis, because \"the plaintiff's claims for relief will involve a\n\ncommon core of facts or will be based on related legal\n\ntheories,\" and \"[m]uch of counsel's time will be devoted\n\ngenerally to the litigation as a whole.\"    Id. at 435.   In those\n\ncases, the \"court should focus on the significance of the\n\noverall relief obtained by the plaintiff in relation to the\n\nhours reasonably expended on the litigation,\" and \"it may simply\n\nreduce the award to account for the limited success.\"      Id. at\n\n435, 436-437.   \"There is no precise rule or formula for making\n\nthese determinations.\"    Id. at 436.\n\n     Bearing in mind the deference due the judge's \"superior\n\nability to calibrate such awards to the nuances of the case,\"\n\nDiffenderfer v. Gomez-Colon, 587 F.3d 445, 452 (1st Cir. 2009),\n\nwe conclude that the judge did not abuse his discretion.      In our\n\nview, the judge carefully and thoughtfully applied these\n\ngoverning principles in determining an appropriate award of\n\nfees.   He scrutinized the number of hours worked by the\n\nplaintiff's counsel, noting that hours devoted to certain\n\nclaims, motions, and issues were properly excluded where they\n\f                                                                     28\n\n\nwere unsuccessful, not related to the principal case, or not a\n\nproper basis for an award of fees.    He also reduced the rates\n\nproposed by the plaintiff's counsel based on the limitations in\n\nthe Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(d)(3).      He\n\nmultiplied these rates by the number of hours reasonably\n\nexpended to obtain a lodestar calculation of $56,372, which he\n\nthen assessed in light of \"the degree of success obtained,\"\n\nFarrar, 506 U.S. at 114, quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 436,\n\nincluding \"the extent of relief, the significance of the legal\n\nissue on which the plaintiff prevailed, and the public purpose\n\nserved\" by the litigation, Farrar, supra at 122 (O'Connor, J.,\n\nconcurring).   The judge noted that LaChance did not succeed on\n\nall of his claims.   Nevertheless, the judge concluded that our\n\nruling in LaChance I constituted a significant victory that\n\nserved a public purpose by establishing the due process rights\n\nof inmates held in administrative segregation.    Taking into\n\naccount these factors and the common core of facts and related\n\nlegal issues involved, the judge reduced the lodestar\n\ncalculation by fifty percent \"due to the discrepancy between the\n\nclaims brought and the claims won.\"\n\n    In challenging this award, the defendants emphasize the\n\npoint that LaChance did not succeed on all his claims.     But our\n\nholding in LaChance I was nevertheless a substantial victory for\n\nLaChance on his most fundamental claim:    that his confinement in\n\f                                                                     29\n\n\nadministrative segregation without a hearing violated his\n\nFederal constitutional right to due process.    It also led to a\n\nsignificant new statement of law, since we announced \"for the\n\nfirst time that segregated confinement on awaiting action status\n\nfor longer than ninety days gives rise to a liberty interest\n\nentitling an inmate to notice and a hearing\" and a written\n\nposthearing decision.     LaChance I, 463 Mass. at 778.   See id. at\n\n776-777.    This was much more than a de minimis success, even\n\nwhen considered in the context of the other goals of LaChance's\n\nsuit.\n\n     The defendants also argue that LaChance's award should have\n\nbeen reduced further because his counsel devoted substantially\n\nmore effort to his unsuccessful claims than to his successful\n\nclaims.     In making this argument, the defendants primarily rely\n\non counting the relative number of claims in the pleadings and\n\nthe relative number of pages in briefs concerning LaChance's\n\nsuccessful and unsuccessful theories.     But such a mathematical\n\n\"ratio provides little aid in determining what is a reasonable\n\nfee in light of all the relevant factors.\"     Hensley, 461 U.S. at\n\n435 n.11.\n\n     In sum, given that the Superior Court judge already reduced\n\nthe award of fees to half of the amount requested in light of\n\nthe discrepancy between the claims brought and the claims won by\n\nLaChance, and considering that \"[t]here is no precise rule or\n\f                                                                   30\n\n\nformula\" for determining an appropriate fee reduction where, as\n\nhere, a civil rights plaintiff has achieved only partial\n\nsuccess, id. at 436, we conclude that the judge did not abuse\n\nhis discretion in calculating the award of attorney's fees.\n\n    3.    Fees awarded on appeal.   Both LaChance and the\n\ndefendants have requested their attorney's fees and costs for\n\nthis appeal.   In light of our rulings above, we conclude that\n\nLaChance is also entitled under § 1988 to recover his reasonable\n\nattorney's fees and costs incurred in connection with this\n\nappeal.   See Mendoza, 444 Mass. at 212 n.28, citing Ustrak v.\n\nFairman, 851 F.2d 983, 990 (7th Cir. 1988) (prevailing party\n\nentitled to reimbursement of fees incurred in defending trial\n\ncourt's award of fees).    We therefore invite LaChance to file\n\nwith the clerk of this court the appropriate documents detailing\n\nand supporting his request for such fees and costs within\n\nfourteen days of the issuance of the rescript in this case, in\n\naccord with the procedure established in Fabre v. Walton, 441\n\nMass. 9, 10-11 (2004).    The defendants' fee request is denied.\n\n    Conclusion.   For the reasons stated above, we affirm the\n\naward of attorney's fees and costs entered by the judge in favor\n\nof LaChance and conclude that LaChance is also entitled under\n\n§ 1988 to recover his reasonable attorney's fees and costs\n\nincurred in connection with this appeal.\n\n                                     So ordered.\n\f",

This appeal concerns an award of attorney's\n\nfees under the Federal Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Award Act of\n\n1976, 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b), in a civil rights action brought by a\n\nMassachusetts prison inmate, Edmund LaChance.    LaChance claimed\n\nthat the defendants violated his constitutional due process\n\nrights by holding him in essentially solitary confinement in a\n\nspecial management unit (SMU) for ten months, without a hearing,\n\nwhile waiting to transfer or reclassify him.    That litigation\n\neventually resulted in our decision in LaChance v. Commissioner\n\nof Correction, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">767</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2012) (LaChance I), where we\n\nannounced \"for the first time that segregated confinement on\n\nawaiting action status for longer than ninety days gives rise to\n\na liberty interest entitling an inmate to notice and a hearing,\"\n\nand a written posthearing decision.   Id. at 778.   See id. at\n\n776-777.   On remand, a Superior Court judge entered declaratory\n\njudgment in favor of LaChance and awarded him $28,578.69 in\n\nattorney's fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b).    The\n\ndefendants are challenging that award in this appeal.\n\n    The principal issue before us is whether LaChance qualified\n\nfor an award of fees as a \"prevailing party\" under § 1988(b),\n\neven though he had already been discharged in 2006 from the SMU\n\ndetention that was the subject of his suit, long before he won\n\nany relief in his favor.   The defendants argue that, in these\n\f                                                                       3\n\n\ncircumstances, LaChance was not a prevailing party because the\n\ndeclaratory judgment he ultimately won was moot, and did not\n\ndirectly benefit him or materially alter his relationship with\n\nthe defendants, at the time it was entered.     We conclude,\n\nhowever, that LaChance does qualify as a prevailing party in the\n\ncircumstances of this case, where the record demonstrates that\n\n(1) the declaratory judgment he obtained was not moot when\n\nentered, because it concerned a deprivation of civil rights of\n\nshort duration that was capable of repetition against LaChance;\n\nand (2) LaChance directly benefited from that judgment at the\n\ntime it was entered.     We also reject the defendants' contention\n\nthat the judge's award of fees to LaChance was unreasonable.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the judge's award of attorney's fees and\n\ncosts to LaChance.\n\n    Background.      We briefly summarize the facts that gave rise\n\nto this litigation, which are detailed in LaChance I, 463 Mass.\n\nat 769-773.   LaChance has been in the custody of the Department\n\nof Correction (DOC) from the inception of this litigation\n\nthrough at least the submission of his brief on appeal.       During\n\nmost of this time, he was an inmate at Souza-Baranowski\n\nCorrectional Center (SBCC), a maximum security prison in\n\nShirley.   In December, 2005, he was assigned to SBCC's SMU for\n\nfourteen days as a sanction for throwing a cup of pudding at\n\nanother inmate and later threatening to harm him.     After\n\f                                                                    4\n\n\ncompleting this disciplinary detention, however, he continued to\n\nbe held in the SMU for another ten months, from January to\n\nNovember, 2006, on \"awaiting action\" status pending his\n\nreclassification or transfer to another facility.3   LaChance did\n\nnot leave the SMU and return to his previous placement until the\n\nother inmate involved in the altercation had been moved out of\n\nit.   During his ten-month detention in the SMU, LaChance was in\n\nsolitary confinement for all but a few hours per week.    He was\n\nshackled whenever he left his cell; allowed only one hour of\n\nrecreation per day, five days per week, in an unsheltered,\n\noutdoor cage; barred from educational, religious, vocational,\n\nand rehabilitative programming available to other inmates; and\n\npermitted only very limited visitation and library privileges.\n\nAlthough a prison official informally reviewed LaChance's status\n\non a weekly basis and gave him written reports of the reviews,\n\nhe was not given a hearing.\n\n      In an amended complaint filed in Superior Court in May,\n\n2008, LaChance asserted claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and G. L.\n\nc. 12, § 11I, alleging that the conditions of his SMU detention\n\n\n      3\n       In LaChance v. Commissioner of Correction, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">767</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n769 n.5 (2012) (LaChance I), we noted that, although \"awaiting\naction\" was not defined in Department of Correction (DOC)\nregulations pertaining to detention in a special management unit\n(SMU), the phrase was used in other contexts, generally\nreferring to confinement pending investigation or a final\nplacement or transfer decision. See 103 Code Mass. Regs.\n§ 421.06 (1994); 103 Code Mass. Regs. § 430.21(1) (2006).\n\f                                                                  5\n\n\nwere at least as harsh as those in a departmental segregation\n\nunit (DSU), but he was denied the right to a hearing guaranteed\n\nin DOC regulations governing DSU confinement.   See 103 Code\n\nMass. Regs. §§ 421.00 (1994).   He requested compensatory and\n\npunitive damages, a declaration that the defendants' actions\n\nwere unlawful, and an award of costs including reasonable\n\nattorney's fees.\n\n    On April 6, 2010, a judge granted LaChance's motion for\n\npartial summary judgment on his claims for declaratory relief.\n\nCiting our decision in Haverty v. Commissioner of Correction,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">737</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002), the judge concluded that LaChance's\n\nconfinement in the SMU was substantially similar to confinement\n\nin a DSU, and that the defendants violated his constitutional\n\ndue process rights by failing to provide him with the same\n\nprocedural protections afforded by the DSU regulations.\n\n    In the same order, the judge allowed in part and denied in\n\npart the defendants' cross motion for summary judgment.     The\n\njudge granted summary judgment in favor of all defendants on\n\nLaChance's claim under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, G. L.\n\nc. 12, §§ 11H and 11I, on the ground that LaChance had offered\n\nno evidence that the defendants had employed threats,\n\nintimidation, or coercion, a necessary element of that claim.\n\nSee Layne v. Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Inst., Cedar\n\nJunction, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2240082\"><a href=\"/opinion/2240082/layne-v-supt-mass-correctional-inst-cedar-junction/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 158 (1989).   The judge also granted\n\f                                                                   6\n\n\nsummary judgment in favor of two defendants on LaChance's claims\n\nfor money damages against them in their official capacities\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983, because money damages against State\n\nofficials are available only if they are sued in their\n\nindividual capacities.   See Will v. Michigan Dep't of State\n\nPolice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112293\"><a href=\"/opinion/112293/will-v-michigan-dept-of-state-police/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 71 (1989); O'Malley v.

The judge denied the\n\ndefendants' summary judgment motion, however, insofar as they\n\nargued that they could not be sued in their individual\n\ncapacities because they enjoyed qualified immunity as government\n\nofficials.   He reasoned that after this court's decision in\n\nHaverty, supra, it should have been clear to the defendants that\n\nthe conditions of LaChance's SMU confinement were substantially\n\nsimilar to those in a DSU and that LaChance was therefore\n\nentitled to the same procedural protections.   The judge\n\nconcluded that the defense of qualified immunity would therefore\n\nbe unavailable to the defendants if they directly participated\n\nin this violation of LaChance's clearly established rights.     See\n\nO'Malley, 415 Mass. at 142 (plaintiffs can overcome government\n\nofficials' qualified immunity defense by showing that defendants\n\ndirectly participated in violating plaintiffs' clearly\n\nestablished rights).\n\n    The defendants sought interlocutory appeal under the\n\ndoctrine of present execution from the judge's ruling on\n\f                                                                   7\n\n\nqualified immunity,4 and we transferred the case on our own\n\nmotion.   We held that the defendants were entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity and directed the Superior Court to enter summary\n\njudgment in their favor as to the damages claims against the\n\nindividual defendants under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.   We noted,\n\n\"[g]overnment officials performing discretionary functions . . .\n\ngenerally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar\n\nas their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory\n\nor constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have\n\nknown.\"   LaChance I, 463 Mass. at 777, quoting Rodriques v.\n\nFurtado, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2101534\"><a href=\"/opinion/2101534/rodriques-v-furtado/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">878</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 882 (1991).   We concluded that it would\n\nnot have been clear to reasonable officers that their behavior\n\nviolated LaChance's due process rights, because \"neither State\n\nnor Federal law ha[d] clearly articulated the outer limit of\n\nwhat constitutes 'reasonable' segregated confinement on awaiting\n\naction status without the safeguards of procedural due process.\"\n\nLaChance I, supra at 778.\n\n\n\n     4\n       \"The doctrine of present execution is a limited exception\nto the finality rule.

LaChance I, 463 Mass. at 775-776.   We further\n\nheld that the procedures followed by the DOC were insufficient\n\nto safeguard that interest.   We concluded that \"an inmate\n\nconfined to administrative segregation on awaiting action\n\nstatus, whether such confinement occurs in an area designated as\n\nan SMU, a DSU, or otherwise, is entitled, as a matter of due\n\nprocess, to notice of the basis on which he is so detained; a\n\nhearing at which he may contest the asserted rationale for his\n\nconfinement; and a posthearing written notice explaining the\n\nreviewing authority's classification decision.\"   Id. at 776-777.\n\nWe left it to the DOC to promulgate appropriate regulations,\n\nbalancing the inmate's interest in challenging potentially\n\narbitrary detention with prison officials' interest in securing\n\nreclassification or transfer of inmates.   But we concluded that\n\n\n     5\n       In considering the defendants' appeal in LaChance I, \"it\nwas necessary to focus on LaChance's Federal due process claims\nbecause LaChance would be entitled to damages under his § 1983\nclaims only if the defendants knowingly violated LaChance's\nrights under the United States Constitution.\" Cantell v.\nCommissioner of Correction, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span>    <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,     (2016).\n\f                                                                   9\n\n\n\"in no circumstances may an inmate be held in segregated\n\nconfinement on awaiting action status for longer than ninety\n\ndays without a hearing.\"   Id. at 777.\n\n     Upon remand, a different judge6 issued an order for entry of\n\na final judgment in favor of LaChance, declaring that the\n\ndefendants had violated LaChance's constitutional due process\n\nrights by failing to provide him with the procedural protections\n\nthat we announced in LaChance I.   The judge allowed the\n\ndefendants' motion for summary judgment as to all of LaChance's\n\nremaining claims.   Final judgment was entered in accord with\n\nthis order on August 21, 2013.\n\n     LaChance subsequently requested an award of $56,504.59 in\n\nattorney's fees and $392.69 in costs under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and\n\nMass.

The\n\njudge who had entered judgment in favor of LaChance concluded\n\nthat LaChance was a \"prevailing party\" and therefore entitled to\n\nreasonable attorney's fees under § 1988, even though he had not\n\nprevailed on his claims for money damages and no injunction had\n\nentered.

In fact, however, the defendants presented the\nmootness argument in their opposition to LaChance's motion for\nattorney's fees. Moreover, as LaChance concedes, the defendants\nraised mootness in moving to dismiss his complaint and in\nopposing his motion for partial summary judgment. We address\nthe issue in light of those facts and because the question of\nmootness implicates the justiciability of the underlying case.\n\f                                                                   16\n\n\ndefendants, and therefore LaChance was correctly determined to\n\nbe a \"prevailing party\" under § 1988.\n\n    The concept of mootness, as applied in the Federal courts,\n\nderives from the case or controversy requirement of art.

In so holding,\n\nthe Court cited evidence that the father had been the subject of\n\nseveral civil contempt proceedings for which he had been\n\nimprisoned on several occasions, including another six-month\n\nterm imposed shortly after his release from the imprisonment at\n\nissue in his action.

Stewart, supra, and Ford\n\nv. Bender, supra.    The plaintiffs in those cases were either\n\ndead or released from the custody at issue when declaratory\n\njudgment entered, and therefore there was no reasonable\n\npossibility that they would again be subjected to the same\n\n     12\n        LaChance submitted the affidavit in response to the\ndefendants' motion for reconsideration of the award of\nattorney's fees. He stated that he had been placed in\nsegregation units many times during his incarceration, including\nplacement in the SMU at SBCC as a pretrial detainee for\napproximately fourteen months in 2000-2001; placement in a\nsegregation unit at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution\nat Concord as a sentenced prisoner for about three months from\nlate 2001 to early 2002; subsequent placements in the SMU at\nSBCC from September 29, 2002, to February 10, 2003, and from\nDecember 21, 2005, to November 15, 2006 (the placement\nchallenged in this action), plus \"at least a few other occasions\nin 2007-2009\" for which he did not recall the dates; placements\nin the segregation unit at the North Central Correctional\nInstitution at Gardner \"on at least three occasions,\" for which\nhe did not recall the dates; and a placement in the segregation\nunit at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Cedar\nJunction from June 5 to July 22, 2014. Although the motion\njudge did not make any findings based on LaChance's affidavit,\nthe defendants did not dispute the assertions therein, and we\nare in as good a position to assess it as the judge below.

Here, by contrast, LaChance was still in custody when\n\njudgment entered and, based on his prior history of segregated\n\nconfinement, there was a reasonable expectation that he would\n\nagain be returned to such confinement.13   Therefore, applying\n\nFederal principles of justiciability, the denial of due process\n\nat the SMU that was the basis of LaChance's civil rights claim\n\nwas capable of repetition as to him, so his claim was not moot\n\nwhen judgment entered.\n\n     The declaratory judgment won by LaChance also benefited him\n\nand materially altered his legal relationship with the\n\ndefendants because that judgment required the defendants to\n\nprovide him with additional procedural protections that he had\n\nnot previously received if he were again placed in segregated\n\ndetention on awaiting action status.   See Lefemine, 133 S. Ct.\n\nat 11 (where Federal District Court ruled that defendants had\n\nviolated plaintiff abortion protester's rights and enjoined them\n\n     13\n       We are mindful of the United States Supreme Court's\nobservation that, \"for purposes of assessing the likelihood that\nstate authorities will reinflict a given injury,\" it has\n\"generally . . . been unwilling to assume that the party seeking\nrelief will repeat the type of misconduct that would once again\nplace him or her at risk of that injury.\" Honig, 484 U.S. at\n320. But we note that the DOC's SMU regulations provide that an\ninmate may be placed in administrative segregation for\nnondisciplinary reasons such as pending transfer or\nclassification, pending an investigation or hearing, or for the\ninmate's own safety. 103 Code Mass. Regs. § 423.08(1) (1995).\nThus, we need not presume repeated misconduct by LaChance to\nconclude that there was a reasonable expectation when judgment\nentered that he would again be subjected to segregated\nconfinement.\n\f                                                                   24\n\n\nfrom engaging in similar conduct in future, that ruling\n\nmaterially altered parties' relationship and therefore justified\n\naward of fees because police had intended to stop plaintiff from\n\nprotesting with his signs but, as result of ruling, could not\n\nprevent him from demonstrating in that manner).   Although\n\nLaChance could only take advantage of this benefit in the\n\nfuture, it was nevertheless a tangible present benefit to him.\n\nSee Mendoza, 444 Mass. at 210-211 (judgments that invalidated\n\nadult entertainment ordinances challenged by plaintiff bar owner\n\nmaterially altered his relationship with defendants, even though\n\nhe was still barred from presenting nude dancing by limitations\n\nin zoning variance, because plaintiff was \"eligible to apply for\n\na zoning variance that would permit nude dancing\").\n\n    In short, because LaChance has adequately shown that there\n\nwas a reasonable expectation when judgment entered that he would\n\nagain be held in segregated detention on awaiting action status,\n\nhe had a sufficient ongoing interest in his suit for it not to\n\nbe moot, even if he was no longer held in the SMU when\n\ndeclaratory relief was entered in his favor.   And because he had\n\nan ongoing interest in the outcome of his suit, the favorable\n\nrulings he obtained benefited him.   We therefore conclude that,\n\neven if this case had been brought in Federal court under the\n\f                                                                25\n\n\nconstraints of Federal subject matter jurisdiction, LaChance\n\nwould qualify for an award of fees as a \"prevailing party.\"14\n\n\n     14\n       We note that, because Federal limitations on\njusticiability are grounded in the case or controversy\nlimitation in art. III of the United States Constitution, and\nbecause art. III does not apply to State courts, State courts\nremain free to define their own jurisdictional limits even when\nadjudicating Federal claims. See ASARCO Inc. v.

In Massachusetts, \"we have on occasion answered\nquestions in moot cases where the issue was one of public\nimportance, where it was fully argued on both sides, where the\nquestion was certain, or at least very likely, to arise again in\nsimilar factual circumstances, and especially where appellate\nreview could not be obtained before the recurring question would\nagain be moot.\" Commonwealth v.

Notably, under our principles of justiciability -- in\ncontrast with Federal jurisprudence -- it is not \"indispensable\nthat the case be capable of repetition in respect only to the\nparticular claimant,\" because the \"doctrine is designed to\nassist in the clarification of the law generally, and not simply\nto assist the situation of a particular party.\" Mendonza v.\nCommonwealth, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">771</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 777 (1996).\n\n     We recognize that there is an unanswered question whether a\nplaintiff may be a \"prevailing party\" under § 1988 in a\nMassachusetts court where the plaintiff obtains a declaratory\njudgment or injunctive relief after the case became moot, even\nthough the plaintiff could not be a \"prevailing party\" had the\ncase been brought in Federal court, where mootness would have\nresulted in dismissal of the plaintiff's claims. It arguably\nwould thwart the congressional purpose in enacting § 1988 if a\nMassachusetts court were to exercise its broader subject matter\njurisdiction to allow a moot civil rights case brought under 42\nU.S.C. § 1983 to proceed to judgment where the challenged\nconduct is likely to recur against others, and then, when the\nplaintiff succeeds in obtaining a declaratory judgment or\ninjunctive relief, conclude that the plaintiff's attorneys are\n\f                                                                     26\n\n\n     2.   Reasonableness of the award of fees.   Having concluded\n\nthat LaChance was a prevailing party, we now address whether the\n\njudge abused his discretion in his award of attorney's fees.\n\nThe defendants contend that the judge abused his discretion in\n\nconcluding that $28,186 was a reasonable award of attorney's\n\nfees, because LaChance's success in relation to his goals was\n\nminimal and his attorneys devoted considerably more effort to\n\nclaims on which they failed than to those on which they\n\nsucceeded.15   We do not agree.\n\n     Section 1988(b) permits a prevailing party to recover \"a\n\nreasonable attorney's fee\" (emphasis added).     The determination\n\nof the amount of reasonable attorney's fees rests in the sound\n\ndiscretion of the judge, to be exercised in accord with certain\n\ngoverning principles.   See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 436-437;\n\nStratos, 387 Mass. at 321.   This determination should ordinarily\n\nbegin with the lodestar calculation, based on the number of\n\nhours that are reasonably expended and adequately documented,\n\nmultiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.   The judge may then\n\nadjust the lodestar calculation upward or downward in light of\n\n\n\nnot entitled to an award of attorney's fees because the\nplaintiff himself or herself did not \"prevail.\" Because the\nplaintiff here would be a \"prevailing party\" even if his case\nhad been brought in Federal court, we need not reach that\nunanswered question in this case.\n     15\n       The defendants do not challenge the $392.69 in costs\nawarded by the Superior Court.\n\f                                                                     27\n\n\nthe results obtained.    See Hensley, supra at 433-434.   Where the\n\nplaintiff has obtained only partial success, it may be feasible\n\nto exclude time devoted to claims on which the plaintiff did not\n\nsucceed.   In many civil rights cases, however, it may be\n\ndifficult to divide the hours expended on a claim-by-claim\n\nbasis, because \"the plaintiff's claims for relief will involve a\n\ncommon core of facts or will be based on related legal\n\ntheories,\" and \"[m]uch of counsel's time will be devoted\n\ngenerally to the litigation as a whole.\"    Id. at 435.   In those\n\ncases, the \"court should focus on the significance of the\n\noverall relief obtained by the plaintiff in relation to the\n\nhours reasonably expended on the litigation,\" and \"it may simply\n\nreduce the award to account for the limited success.\"      Id. at\n\n435, 436-437.   \"There is no precise rule or formula for making\n\nthese determinations.\"    Id. at 436.\n\n     Bearing in mind the deference due the judge's \"superior\n\nability to calibrate such awards to the nuances of the case,\"\n\nDiffenderfer v. Gomez-Colon, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">587</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 452 (1st Cir. 2009),\n\nwe conclude that the judge did not abuse his discretion.      In our\n\nview, the judge carefully and thoughtfully applied these\n\ngoverning principles in determining an appropriate award of\n\nfees.   He scrutinized the number of hours worked by the\n\nplaintiff's counsel, noting that hours devoted to certain\n\nclaims, motions, and issues were properly excluded where they\n\f                                                                     28\n\n\nwere unsuccessful, not related to the principal case, or not a\n\nproper basis for an award of fees.    He also reduced the rates\n\nproposed by the plaintiff's counsel based on the limitations in\n\nthe Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(d)(3).      He\n\nmultiplied these rates by the number of hours reasonably\n\nexpended to obtain a lodestar calculation of $56,372, which he\n\nthen assessed in light of \"the degree of success obtained,\"\n\nFarrar, 506 U.S. at 114, quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 436,\n\nincluding \"the extent of relief, the significance of the legal\n\nissue on which the plaintiff prevailed, and the public purpose\n\nserved\" by the litigation, Farrar, supra at 122 (O'Connor, J.,\n\nconcurring).   The judge noted that LaChance did not succeed on\n\nall of his claims.   Nevertheless, the judge concluded that our\n\nruling in LaChance I constituted a significant victory that\n\nserved a public purpose by establishing the due process rights\n\nof inmates held in administrative segregation.    Taking into\n\naccount these factors and the common core of facts and related\n\nlegal issues involved, the judge reduced the lodestar\n\ncalculation by fifty percent \"due to the discrepancy between the\n\nclaims brought and the claims won.\"\n\n    In challenging this award, the defendants emphasize the\n\npoint that LaChance did not succeed on all his claims.     But our\n\nholding in LaChance I was nevertheless a substantial victory for\n\nLaChance on his most fundamental claim:    that his confinement in\n\f                                                                     29\n\n\nadministrative segregation without a hearing violated his\n\nFederal constitutional right to due process.    It also led to a\n\nsignificant new statement of law, since we announced \"for the\n\nfirst time that segregated confinement on awaiting action status\n\nfor longer than ninety days gives rise to a liberty interest\n\nentitling an inmate to notice and a hearing\" and a written\n\nposthearing decision.     LaChance I, 463 Mass. at 778.   See id. at\n\n776-777.    This was much more than a de minimis success, even\n\nwhen considered in the context of the other goals of LaChance's\n\nsuit.\n\n     The defendants also argue that LaChance's award should have\n\nbeen reduced further because his counsel devoted substantially\n\nmore effort to his unsuccessful claims than to his successful\n\nclaims.     In making this argument, the defendants primarily rely\n\non counting the relative number of claims in the pleadings and\n\nthe relative number of pages in briefs concerning LaChance's\n\nsuccessful and unsuccessful theories.     But such a mathematical\n\n\"ratio provides little aid in determining what is a reasonable\n\nfee in light of all the relevant factors.\"     Hensley, 461 U.S. at\n\n435 n.11.\n\n     In sum, given that the Superior Court judge already reduced\n\nthe award of fees to half of the amount requested in light of\n\nthe discrepancy between the claims brought and the claims won by\n\nLaChance, and considering that \"[t]here is no precise rule or\n\f                                                                   30\n\n\nformula\" for determining an appropriate fee reduction where, as\n\nhere, a civil rights plaintiff has achieved only partial\n\nsuccess, id. at 436, we conclude that the judge did not abuse\n\nhis discretion in calculating the award of attorney's fees.\n\n    3.    Fees awarded on appeal.   Both LaChance and the\n\ndefendants have requested their attorney's fees and costs for\n\nthis appeal.   In light of our rulings above, we conclude that\n\nLaChance is also entitled under § 1988 to recover his reasonable\n\nattorney's fees and costs incurred in connection with this\n\nappeal.   See Mendoza, 444 Mass. at 212 n.28, citing Ustrak v.\n\nFairman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"508788\"><a href=\"/opinion/508788/stephen-ustrak-v-james-w-fairman/\"><span class=\"volume\">851</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">983</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 990 (7th Cir. 1988) (prevailing party\n\nentitled to reimbursement of fees incurred in defending trial\n\ncourt's award of fees).

The defendants' fee request is denied.\n\n    Conclusion.   For the reasons stated above, we affirm the\n\naward of attorney's fees and costs entered by the judge in favor\n\nof LaChance and conclude that LaChance is also entitled under\n\n§ 1988 to recover his reasonable attorney's fees and costs\n\nincurred in connection with this appeal.\n\n                                     So ordered.\n\f</pre>",
