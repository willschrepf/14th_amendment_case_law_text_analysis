The trial court sentenced him accordingly, ordering the\n\nsentences to be served concurrently. Appellant brings five issues on appeal,\n\nchallenging the sufficiency of the evidence to show the aggravating element for\n\nthe six convictions of aggravated sexual assault of a child (counts one through\n\nfour, eight, and nine) and contending that the State misrepresented the law during\n\nvoir dire and that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding evidence of the\n\ncomplainant’s prior rape accusation against a neighbor and the testimony of two\n\nother witnesses. Because the evidence is sufficient to support the jury’s verdict\n\nand because the trial court committed no reversible error, we affirm the trial\n\ncourt’s judgments.\n\nBrief Facts\n\n      Appellant and Complainant’s mother (Mother) had been a couple, had\n\nshared a home with Complainant and her brother, and were the parents of twin\n\nboys, Complainant’s younger half-brothers. Appellant and Mother parted ways\n\nand went through a custody battle over the twins. On July, 4, 2012, Complainant,\n\nwho was fourteen years old at the time, was at Appellant’s home with her twin\n\nbrothers.   Complainant and Mother were not getting along around this time.\n\nAppellant told Complainant that he wanted to put Mother in a hole and hire some\n\nMexican assassins to hurt her. In the same conversation, Appellant suggested\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\fthat Complainant have sex with him to make Mother mad, but Complainant\n\nrefused his offer.\n\n        Later that same month, Complainant, along with her twin brothers, visited\n\nAppellant’s parents in El Paso. During this trip, Complainant received messages\n\nfrom someone who identified himself as “Jayylo” through Kik, an application on\n\nher cell phone. Jayylo sent pictures of his penis to her. She responded by\n\n“sen[ding] inappropriate pictures of [her] boobs.”   She never gave Jayylo her\n\nhome address or her real name.       Jayylo continued to send more pictures of\n\nhimself to her. When Complainant threatened to stop sending Jayylo pictures, he\n\nthreatened to send the photos she had sent him to her school and to the\n\nmailboxes of Mother and her neighbors.           Complainant noticed that the\n\nbackground of one of the photos he sent her resembled a portion of Appellant’s\n\nhouse. Complainant was then suspicious that Appellant was Jayylo.\n\n        She confronted Appellant, but he denied having a Kik account. About an\n\nhour later, Appellant called Complainant back and asked her why he had pictures\n\nof her boobs in his mailbox. Complainant started crying and told him what had\n\nhappened with Jayylo and that he had threatened her. Complainant also told\n\nAppellant’s mother why she was crying, and Appellant got mad at Complainant\n\nfor telling his mother. Complainant turned fifteen years old while she was in El\n\nPaso.\n\n        When Complainant returned home from El Paso, she began receiving text\n\nmessages from Jayylo sent directly to her cell phone number.        Complainant\n\n\n                                        3\n\fnoticed that the first six digits of Jayylo’s phone number were the same as\n\nAppellant’s cell phone number. Jayylo told her that he got her phone number\n\nfrom one of her friends, which Complainant knew not to be true.           Whenever\n\nComplainant asked Jayylo who he really was, he would change his story of how\n\nComplainant was supposed to know him and how old he was. Jayylo texted\n\nComplainant almost every day at different times of the day. But she could never\n\nget a response when she called him.\n\n      Jayylo continued threatening Complainant and demanded that she send\n\nhim more photos, have sex with Appellant, videotape it, and send the video to\n\nJayylo. Complainant refused. Jayylo put one of the photos Complainant had sent\n\nhim on a Facebook page he had created and threatened to add all of her friends\n\nto that page. Appellant told Complainant that Jayylo was also contacting him, but\n\nshe never saw any of the messages that Appellant claimed to have received.\n\n      Appellant and Complainant spoke about the situation and decided to\n\nacquiesce to Jayylo’s demands.          Complainant and Appellant had sexual\n\nintercourse in Appellant’s house while Complainant’s twin brothers were asleep.\n\nFollowing Jayylo’s demands, Appellant and Complainant continued their sexual\n\nrelationship. They had sexual intercourse “eight to eleven times[,] [m]aybe more,”\n\nfrom August 2012 to November 2012. These sexual encounters would occur at\n\neither Appellant’s or Complainant’s home.\n\n      Complainant testified that she texted Jayylo that it was getting harder for\n\nher to keep these incidents a secret, and shortly after she sent this text, Appellant\n\n\n                                         4\n\fcalled her and told her that they did not “have to do it anymore.” Appellant then\n\ntold Complainant a story about\n\n      a girl who was babysitting this guy’s kids, and he ended up raping\n      her. And then she went to court, and then he pretended to be\n      somebody that he wasn’t and hit her up on Facebook and that they\n      met up thinking it was somebody else, and he killed her.\n\nThis story scared Complainant. At trial, she testified that Appellant knew people\n\nfrom Mexico who were in the Mexican Mafia. Although Complainant testified that\n\nAppellant never specifically threatened her, she also testified that he made it\n\nclear that if he could hurt Mother, he could hurt Complainant too. In December\n\n2012, Complainant made an outcry to Mother’s friend. Shortly afterward, the\n\ndecision to call the police was made. Appellant pled not guilty to all counts of an\n\neighteen-count indictment alleging that he had committed sexual assault and\n\naggravated sexual assault on various dates against Complainant.\n\n      Outside the presence of the jury, in an in-camera hearing, Appellant\n\npresented evidence from Ricky May. May lived in Complainant’s neighborhood\n\naround 2008 to 2009.      He testified that when he was eighteen years old,\n\nComplainant would contact him “through phone [and] text messaging, trying to get\n\n[him] to have sexual intercourse with her” because she was “horny.” May refused\n\nComplainant’s offer, but he heard that Complainant had told people in their\n\nneighborhood that he had raped her, which he denied. May was never charged\n\nwith or arrested for rape. The State objected to May’s testimony on hearsay\n\ngrounds.\n\n\n\n                                        5\n\f       THE COURT:               Response?\n\n       [PROSECUTOR]: Once again, Your Honor, this is an opinion based\n                     upon hearsay. There’s no proof that she ever\n                     said these things.        And this is the type of\n                     reputation and opinion evidence that is, I believe,\n                     prohibited under 412 as is relating to sexual\n                     conduct and it’s not fitting in one of the categories\n                     that allows for past behavior to be admissible.\n\nThe trial court sustained the State’s objection, and May was not permitted to\n\ntestify in front of the jury.\n\n       Appellant also offered testimony from Jeannie Redmon outside the\n\npresence of the jury.       Redmon testified that she had known Complainant for\n\n“[a]pproximately seven to eight years.” Redmon testified that Complainant was\n\n“untruthful” because (1) she took items that belonged to Redmon’s daughter, told\n\nRedmon that Redmon’s daughter had given her the items when in fact, Redmon’s\n\ndaughter had not, and instructed Redmon’s daughter to similarly lie; (2) she\n\nwould tell Redmon and her daughter that she was dating people whom she was\n\nnot dating; (3) she had said that a boy across the street had raped her; and\n\n(4) she lied about giving out her phone number to boys at a waterpark when\n\nRedmon asked her if she had done so. Redmon also testified that she thought\n\nher daughter and Complainant had gone to pornographic websites on Redmon’s\n\nhome computer.         Appellant offered Redmon’s testimony as her opinion on\n\nComplainant’s truthfulness. The State objected to Redmon’s testimony:\n\n       We’ll object under rule 608 and 609, also 404. I think if this witness\n       knew [Complainant] presently, we would be legally okay with her\n       opinion that she’s untruthful, but I think four years ago is a little bit too\n\n\n                                            6\n\f       remote. And certainly, even if that was allowed, the rules, specifically\n       608(b)[,] disallow specific instances of conduct. So we would object\n       to any specific instances.\n\n              Additionally, it sounds like almost all of this is hearsay and,\n       except for perhaps the opinion as to truthfulness. But the porn use, I\n       don’t think we can say that this witness knows with her own personal\n       knowledge that it was definitely [Complainant]. I think perhaps she’s\n       basing that off of what her daughter has told her. And the same with\n       the false claim of rape, she’s admitted on cross she really does not\n       know what happened.\n\nThe trial court sustained the State’s objections, and Redmon was not permitted to\n\ntestify in front of the jury.\n\n       Appellant also presented evidence from Denise Brown outside the\n\npresence of the jury.       Brown testified that Complainant was friends with her\n\ndaughter and that she knew Complainant in 2009 and 2010. Brown testified that\n\nComplainant was untruthful because Complainant (1) spread rumors that Brown’s\n\ndaughter was pregnant and (2) took some fingernail polish belonging to Brown’s\n\ndaughter without permission.            Brown also testified that Complainant was\n\nflirtatious   with   boys       and   opined   that   Complainant   was   promiscuous.\n\nComplainant’s friendship with Brown’s daughter ended when Brown’s daughter\n\nbegan dating a boy whom Complainant had previously dated, and Complainant\n\nbegan calling Brown’s daughter a “slut.”              The State objected to Brown’s\n\ntestimony:\n\n       The State would object as to . . . this witness . . . having no personal\n       knowledge of the things that she has referenced as far as her basis\n       for determining this—[Complainant’s] credibility. She’s basing it upon\n       hearsay. So we would object under 608.\n\n\n\n                                               7\n\f           Also, as far as going into specific instances of conduct, she\n      doesn’t—she did not personally observe them or have personal\n      knowledge as to them.\n\n            Also, we’d object under 404, 403 as to her general\n      characterization     of  [Complainant’s   being]     boy    crazy,\n      promiscuous. . . . [S]he has clearly demonstrated her own bias\n      towards [Complainant] where she does not apply the standard to her\n      own daughter as she does for [Complainant], even though they’re\n      engaged in the same conduct.\n\nThe trial court sustained the State’s rule 608 objection.\n\nSufficiency of the Evidence\n\n      In his first issue, Appellant argues that the evidence is insufficient to\n\nsupport the jury’s determination that, during the alleged aggravated sexual\n\nassaults, he, “by acts or words placed [Complainant] in fear that death or serious\n\nbodily injury would be imminently inflicted on [her] or [her mother],” as alleged in\n\ncounts one through four, eight, and nine.\n\n      In our due-process review of the sufficiency of the evidence to support a\n\nconviction, we view all the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict to\n\ndetermine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential\n\nelements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.1 This standard gives full play\n\nto the responsibility of the trier of fact to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 2789 (1979);\nDobbs v. State, 434 S.W.3d 166, 170 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014).\n\n\n\n                                          8\n\fweigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to\n\nultimate facts. 2\n\n       The trier of fact is the sole judge of the weight and credibility of the\n\nevidence.3 Thus, when performing an evidentiary sufficiency review, we may not\n\nre-evaluate the weight and credibility of the evidence and substitute our judgment\n\nfor that of the factfinder.4    Instead, we determine whether the necessary\n\ninferences are reasonable based upon the cumulative force of the evidence when\n\nviewed in the light most favorable to the verdict.5 We must presume that the\n\nfactfinder resolved any conflicting inferences in favor of the verdict and defer to\n\nthat resolution.6\n\n       The standard of review is the same for direct and circumstantial evidence\n\ncases; circumstantial evidence is as probative as direct evidence in establishing\n\nthe guilt of an actor.7\n\n\n       2\n        Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.

App. 2013).\n       6\n        Jackson, 443 U.S. at 326, 99 S. Ct. at 2793; Dobbs, 434 S.W.3d at 170.\n       7\n      Dobbs, 434 S.W.3d at 170; Hooper v. State, 214 S.W.3d 9, 13 (Tex. Crim.\nApp. 2007).\n\n\n\n                                        9\n\f      Complainant testified that Appellant had told her (1) that he knew people in\n\nMexico associated with the Mexican mafia and that they would kill her and her\n\nmother without the killings being traced back to him and (2) a story about a man\n\nwho raped his babysitter and killed her after she told someone about the rape.\n\nThe outcry witness testified that Complainant had reported the Mexican mafia\n\nthreat to her and that Complainant had also told her that Appellant had\n\nthreatened to slit Complainant’s throat and leave her in a ditch somewhere.\n\n      Appellant relies on Blount v. State 8 and its progeny to argue that the threats\n\nwere not imminent because they were conditional.           The Blount court found\n\ninsufficient the attackers’ telling the victim that if she told, they would come back\n\nand kill her because the threat was conditional. 9 As the State points out, Blount\n\nrelied on a former version of the statute that required not only that the threat was\n\nmade but that it “compelled submission to the rape.” 10         That language was\n\nremoved from the statute when it was later amended, and consequently, as the\n\nState argues, it does not apply to this offense. 11\n\n\n      8\n       542 S.W.2d 164 (Tex. Crim. App. 1976).\n      9\n       Id. at 165–66.\n      10\n          Id. at 165 (quotation marks omitted).\n      11\n       See Tex. Penal Code Ann. § 22.021 (West Supp. 2014) (providing\nelements of aggravated sexual assault); Nichols v. State, 692 S.W.2d 178, 180\n(Tex. App.—Waco 1985, pet. ref’d) (discussing the 1981 statutory amendment\nremoving the requirement of compelled submission).\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\f      Further, a child cannot consent to sexual contact or intercourse. 12 There is\n\nno element of compulsion required to be proved in the aggravated sexual assault\n\nor sexual assault of a child. 13    Because Complainant was a child and not\n\ncompetent to consent to sexual conduct, the threat went only to the aggravating\n\nelement that elevated the offense to a higher grade of felony and therefore a\n\nhigher range of punishment. 14\n\n      The unique facts of this case require us to look at the threats as continuing\n\nduring the commission of the assaults over an extended period of time.\n\nComplainant said in her outcry and repeated at trial that Appellant—who for most\n\nof the period of the offenses was a person lurking in the background of her life—\n\nmade various death threats to keep her participating silently in the sexual\n\nrelationship. She understood these threats to be continuing threats of imminent\n\nharm at any time. 15 The record supports that interpretation under the unique\n\nfacts of this case. We therefore overrule Appellant’s first issue.\n\n\n      12\n        In re B.W., 313 S.W.3d 818, 823–24 (Tex. 2010).\n      13\n       See id.; see also Tex. Penal Code Ann. § 22.011(a)(2) (West 2011),\n§ 22.021(a)(1)(B), (2).\n      14\n        Compare Tex. Penal Code Ann. § 22.011(f) (West 2011) (providing that\nsexual assault is a second-degree felony), and id. § 12.33 (providing range of\npunishment for second-degree felonies), with id. § 22.021(a)(2)(A)(ii), (e)\n(providing that aggravated assault as alleged in this case is a first-degree felony),\nand id. § 12.32 (providing range of punishment for first-degree felonies).\n      15\n        See, e.g., Curry v. State, 30 S.W.3d 394, 406 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000)\n(discussing the continuing nature of an abduction and holding that because a\n\n\n                                         11\n\fAlleged Misstatement of the Law in Voir Dire\n\n      In his second issue, Appellant argues that the State misstated the law\n\nduring voir dire and that this misstatement violated his rights under the Sixth and\n\nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and sections ten and\n\nnineteen of article I of the Texas Constitution. To preserve a complaint for our\n\nreview, a party must have presented to the trial court a timely request, objection,\n\nor motion that states the specific grounds for the desired ruling if they are not\n\napparent from the context of the request, objection, or motion. 16 Further, the trial\n\ncourt must have ruled on the request, objection, or motion, either expressly or\n\nimplicitly, or the complaining party must have objected to the trial court’s refusal\n\nto rule. 17 We have carefully examined those portions of the record to which\n\nAppellant directs us concerning what he describes as misrepresentations of the\n\nlaw to the jury panel during voir dire. At no point did Appellant object or otherwise\n\ncall his complaint to the attention of the trial court. Consequently, he did not\n\npreserve this issue for appellate review.

Judge Cochran has explained,\n\n             Trials involving sexual assault may raise particular evidentiary\n      and constitutional concerns because the credibility of both the\n      complainant and defendant is a central, often dispositive, issue.\n      Sexual assault cases are frequently “he said, she said” trials in\n      which the jury must reach a unanimous verdict based solely upon\n      two diametrically different versions of an event, unaided by any\n      physical, scientific, or other corroborative evidence. Thus, the Rules\n      of Evidence, especially Rule 403, should be used sparingly to\n      exclude relevant, otherwise admissible evidence that might bear\n      upon the credibility of either the defendant or complainant in such\n      “he said, she said” cases. And Texas law, as well as the federal\n      constitution, requires great latitude when the evidence deals with a\n      witness’s specific bias, motive, or interest to testify in a particular\n      fashion.\n\n              But, as the Supreme Court noted in Davis v. Alaska, there is\n      an important distinction between an attack on the general credibility\n      of a witness and a more particular attack on credibility that reveals\n      “possible biases, prejudices, or ulterior motives of the witness as\n      they may relate directly to issues or personalities in the case at\n      hand.” Thus, under Davis, “the exposure of a witness’ motivation in\n      testifying is a proper and important function of the constitutionally\n      protected right of cross-examination.” However, as Justice Stewart\n      noted in concurrence, the Court neither held nor suggested that the\n      Constitution confers a right to impeach the general credibility of a\n      witness through otherwise prohibited modes of cross-examination.\n      Thus, the Davis Court did not hold that a defendant has an absolute\n      constitutional right to impeach the general credibility of a witness in\n      any fashion that he chooses. But the constitution is offended if the\n      state evidentiary rule would prohibit him from cross-examining a\n\n\n\n\n                                        13\n\f      witness concerning possible motives, bias, and prejudice to such an\n      extent that he could not present a vital defensive theory. 18\n\n      A witness’s credibility may be attacked in three ways: opinion or reputation\n\nfor general truthfulness or untruthfulness and cross-examination on specific\n\ninstances of conduct that establish bias, self-interest, or motive for testifying as\n\nhe or she did. 19 Opinion evidence is not the same as reputation evidence. 20 As\n\nthis court has explained,\n\n      Reputation witnesses’ testimony must be based on discussion with\n      others about the subject, or on hearing others discuss the person’s\n      reputation, and not just on personal knowledge. Rule 405 requires\n      only “substantial familiarity” with the reputation of the accused. 21\n\n      Reputation evidence, then, must necessarily be grounded in hearsay. 22\n\nAn objection that the testimony of reputation evidence is hearsay and not based\n\non personal knowledge thus will not lie. 23 Opinion testimony is governed by rule\n\nof evidence 701 and must be based on personal observation. 24\n\n\n      18\n        Hammer v.

Evid. 701.\n\n\n\n                                        14\n\f      Within this general framework, Judge Cochran, speaking for the\n\nunanimous Hammer court, has explained why Texas, unlike many other states,\n\ndoes not allow a defendant in a sexual assault case to impeach the complainant\n\nwith evidence of prior false accusations:\n\n             The theory for admitting prior false accusations of rape in a\n      sex-offense prosecution is frequently analogized to Aesop’s story of\n      “The Boy Who Cried Wolf.” A past false accusation makes it more\n      likely that the witness lacks credibility and thus should not be\n      believed concerning this accusation. But in Aesop’s fable, there\n      really was a wolf, and it killed the sheep. The moral of that story was\n      “Nobody believes a liar . . . even when he is telling the truth.” A\n      criminal trial, however, is designed to find the truth about a specific\n      incident, not to decide whether someone has lied in the past about\n      the presence of wolves or about being raped. Prior false allegations\n      of rape do not tend to prove or disprove any of the elements of the\n      charged sexual offense.\n\n            Therefore, Texas, unlike some jurisdictions, has not created a\n      per se exception to Rule 608(b)’s general prohibition against\n      impeachment with specific instances of conduct to admit evidence of\n      the complainant’s prior false allegations of abuse or molestation.\n      The inferential chain of logic that is barred by Rule 608(b) is this:\n\n            The witness lied to his employer (or did some specific act of\n            dishonesty)\n\n            That specific conduct proves dishonest character;\n\n            Therefore, the witness is generally dishonest and should not\n            be believed in this case.\n\n      Applied to prior false accusations, the barred evidentiary chain is\n      this:\n\n            Complainant made a prior false accusation;\n\n            That specific conduct proves dishonest character;\n\n            Therefore, the complainant is generally dishonest and should\n            not be believed in this case.\n\n\n                                        15\n\f       This is precisely the prohibited propensity chain of logic—\n“Once a thief, always a thief,” “Once a liar, always a liar”—that\nunderlies both Rules 404(b) and 608(b).           A sexual assault\ncomplainant is not a volunteer for an exercise in character\nassassination. Several federal courts have held that exclusion of\nthis evidence, offered to attack the victim’s general credibility, does\nnot violate the Confrontation Clause.\n\n       If, however, the cross-examiner offers evidence of a prior false\naccusation of sexual activity for some purpose other than a\npropensity attack upon the witness’s general character for\ntruthfulness, it may well be admissible under our state evidentiary\nrules.\n\n      For example, in Billodeau v. State, we held that the trial court\nshould have admitted evidence that the child complainant in that\naggravated sexual assault prosecution had made threats to falsely\naccuse two neighbors of sexual molestation. We held that such\nevidence supported the defensive theory that the complainant’s\nmotive in accusing the defendant of sexual molestation was “rage\nand anger” when he was thwarted. Evidence of threats to accuse\nothers of sexual molestation when he displayed “rage and anger” at\nbeing thwarted is some evidence of a common motive for accusing\nthe defendant of sexual molestation. The chain of logic is as follows:\n\n      The victim makes false accusations in certain circumstances\nand for certain reasons;\n\n      Those circumstances and reasons are present in this case;\n\n      Therefore, the victim made a false accusation in this case.\n\n       One might even call this modus operandi evidence admissible\nunder Rule 404(b). Evidence of other acts or wrongs may be\nadmissible under Rule 404(b) to prove such matters as motive,\nintent, scheme, or any other relevant purpose except conduct in\nconformity with bad character. Even “the doctrine of chances” has\nbeen invoked as a possible basis for admitting evidence of a victim’s\nprior false accusation of rape. Similarly, evidence of a victim’s prior\nsexual activity may be admissible under Rule 412, the Texas Rape\nShield Law, when offered to establish the victim’s motive or bias\nagainst the defendant.\n\n\n\n\n                                  16\n\f              In sum, several different state evidentiary rules permit the use\n      of prior false accusations when offered to show the witness’s bias or\n      motive or for some other relevant, noncharacter purpose. The\n      Confrontation Clause mandate of Davis v. Alaska is not inconsistent\n      with Texas evidence law. Thus, compliance with a rule of evidence\n      will, in most instances, avoid a constitutional question concerning the\n      admissibility of such evidence. 25\n\nWe now examine the case at bar.\n\n      Prior Rape\n\n      Appellant argues that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding\n\nMay’s testimony that he had heard a rumor that Complainant was telling people\n\nthat he had sexually assaulted her and Redmon’s testimony pertaining to the\n\nalleged incident.   Appellant offered May’s testimony under rule of evidence\n\n404(b). 26 While Appellant now argues that the trial court’s ruling abridged certain\n\nof his constitutional rights, at trial he spoke only of credibility and Rule 404(b).\n\nAppellant’s complaints at trial do not conform to his constitutional complaints on\n\nappeal; we therefore do not address his constitutional complaints. 27\n\n      Additionally, May’s testimony dealt with rumors on the street; it did not\n\nconstitute testimony of Complainant’s reputation for truthfulness, nor were his\n\nclaims that he had heard that she was spreading rumors in any way\n\n\n      25\n        Hammer, 296 S.W.3d at 564–66 (footnotes omitted).\n      26\n        Tex. R. Evid. 404(b).\n      27\n        See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a)(1); Lovill v. State, 319 S.W.3d 687, 691–92\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2009).\n\n\n\n                                        17\n\fsubstantiated to provide a basis for an opinion that she was not worthy of belief\n\nunder oath. And to the extent that his testimony was intended to be evidence of\n\nprior false accusations of sexual assault, such testimony is not admissible for the\n\npurpose of showing her character conformity or propensity to lie. 28\n\n      Although Appellant also argues that the evidence was admissible to show\n\nmotive and modus operandi, May candidly admitted that Complainant never\n\naccused him to his face of raping her. His belief that she had accused him was\n\nbased on rumors that he had heard. The record does not establish confirmation\n\nof May’s belief that she falsely accused him of rape. Nor do the rumors he heard\n\nsuggest a motive for falsely accusing Appellant or a modus operandi. May said\n\nthat Complainant would ask him to have sex with her, and he refused. But we\n\ncannot discern how the rumors he heard that she was accusing him of rape were\n\never verified.   The record before this court therefore does not establish the\n\nadmissibility of this evidence of purported false accusations of rape under rule\n\n404(b).\n\n      At trial, Appellant explained in seeking admission of the false accusation\n\ntestimony, “the false claim of rape is going to credibility.”    We hold that the\n\nrumors of false rape accusations were not admissible, and based on the record\n\nbefore us, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellant’s\n\n\n\n      28\n          See Hammer, 296 S.W.3d at 564.\n\n\n\n                                        18\n\frequest to present this evidence before the jury. We overrule Appellant’s third\n\nissue.\n\nRedmon’s and Brown’s Opinion Testimony\n\n         In his fourth and fifth issues, Appellant complains of the exclusion of the\n\ntestimony of Redmon and Brown concerning their opinions of Complainant’s\n\ncredibility.   As we understand the record, Appellant appears to have offered\n\nthese opinions by having the women explain specific acts that they suspected\n\nhad occurred and speculate on others. He did not offer their testimony on any\n\nconstitutional basis. We therefore do not address the constitutional arguments\n\nhe raises on appeal. 29\n\n         Redmon’s testimony was based on her belief that Complainant had lied\n\nand had told Redmon’s daughter to lie about having given Complainant things\n\nthat Complainant had stolen from Redmon’s daughter. Redmon also believed\n\nthat Complainant had lied to her and to her daughter about dating, smoking\n\nmarijuana, and being raped. Appellant explained to the trial court that he was\n\noffering Redmon’s testimony as “possible opinion testimony on truthfulness.”\n\n         Brown believed that Complainant had spread untruthful rumors about her\n\ndaughter and that she had stolen her daughter’s nail polish. We are not clear on\n\nthe legal basis for which Appellant offered this evidence, other than as an opinion\n\n\n\n         29\n          See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a)(1); Lovill, 319 S.W.3d at 691–92.\n\n\n\n                                          19\n\fof Complainant’s truthfulness. Judge Keasler has explained for the Texas Court\n\nof Criminal Appeals,\n\n      [A] less common notion of error preservation comes into play in this\n      case, although certainly not a novel one. Professors Goode,\n      Wellborn and Sharlot refer to it as “party responsibility.” They\n      explain it this way:\n\n                   To the question, which party has the responsibility\n            regarding any particular matter, it is infallibly accurate to\n            answer with another question:              which party is\n            complaining now on appeal? This is because in a real\n            sense both parties are always responsible for the\n            application of any evidence rule to any evidence.\n            Whichever party complains on appeal about the trial\n            judge’s action must, at the earliest opportunity, have\n            done everything necessary to bring to the judge’s\n            attention the evidence rule in question and its precise\n            and proper application to the evidence in question.\n\n      The basis for party responsibility is, among other things, Appellate\n      Rule 33.1. It provides that as a prerequisite to presenting a\n      complaint for appellate review, the record must show that the party\n      “stated the grounds for the ruling that (he) sought from the trial court\n      with sufficient specificity to make the trial court aware of the\n      complaint.” So it is not enough to tell the judge that evidence is\n      admissible. The proponent, if he is the losing party on appeal, must\n      have told the judge why the evidence was admissible.\n\n             We recently discussed this notion in Martinez v. State. There,\n      the defendant moved to suppress oral statements due to the State’s\n      failure to comply with Art. 20.17. The State argued for the first time\n      on appeal that Art. 20.17 did not apply. We concluded that the State\n      forfeited this argument by failing to bring it to the trial judge’s\n      attention.    We explained that “both Texas Rule of Appellate\n      Procedure 33.1 and Texas Rule of Evidence 103 are ‘judge-\n      protecting’ rules of error preservation. The basic principle of both\n      rules is that of ‘party responsibility.’” We recognized that “the party\n      complaining on appeal (whether it be the State or the defendant)\n      about a trial court’s admission, exclusion, or suppression of evidence\n      must, at the earliest opportunity, have done everything necessary to\n      bring to the judge’s attention the evidence rule or statute in question\n\n\n                                         20\n\fand its precise and proper application to the evidence in question.”\nThe issue, we said, “is not whether the appealing party is the State\nor the defendant or whether the trial court’s ruling is legally ‘correct’\nin every sense, but whether the complaining party on appeal brought\nto the trial court’s attention the very complaint that party is now\nmaking on appeal.”\n\n      Similarly, in Willover v. State, the defendant sought to admit\ntwo videotaped interviews of the victim. At trial,\n\n      it (was) clear that, although (the defendant) did not\n      actually recite the specific rule of evidence he was\n      relying upon, (he) sought to admit the videotapes for\n      impeachment purposes. (He) did not argue, nor was\n      there any discussion at trial, that the tapes were not\n      hearsay or that the videotapes were admissible under\n      any exception to the hearsay rule other than Article\n      38.071 or for impeachment purposes.\n\n      On appeal, the defendant argued for the first time that the\nvideotapes were not hearsay. We relied on the notion of “party\nresponsibility” to reject this argument because “(i)n order to have\nevidence admitted under a hearsay exception, the proponent of the\nevidence must specify which exception he is relying upon.” It was\nup to the defendant, we said, and “not the trial court, to specify\nwhich exception to the hearsay rule he was relying upon or to\nspecify how the evidence was not hearsay.”\n\n       In some cases, we have applied the “party responsibility”\ntheory without using those precise words. In Clark v. State, the\nState presented the testimony of Dr. James Grigson that the\ndefendant would be a future danger. The defendant sought at trial\nto introduce a letter and accompanying report which listed eleven\nindividuals convicted of capital murder whose sentences had later\nbeen commuted or reduced. In several of those cases, Dr. Grigson\nhad predicted that the individual would be a future danger. The trial\ncourt refused to admit the evidence.\n\n       On appeal, the defendant argued that the excluded evidence\nwas admissible to impeach Dr. Grigson and show that his prior\nfuture dangerousness predictions had turned out to be incorrect.\nBut the defendant had not articulated this basis for admission at trial.\nAt trial, he had argued the evidence was admissible to impeach\n\n\n                                   21\n\fstatements that Dr. Grigson had made in Lubbock County. The\nState had objected that the impeachment went to a collateral matter,\nand the trial judge had agreed.\n\n      We rejected the defendant’s argument on appeal because he\n“did not clearly articulate” that he wanted to admit the evidence to\ndemonstrate Grigson’s past mistakes in predicting future\ndangerousness. We said that the trial judge “never had the\nopportunity to rule upon (the defendant’s) appellate rationale.” Since\nthe defendant “did not sufficiently clearly expressly offer the\nevidence for the purpose which he now claims on appeal,” that\nargument could not be raised on appeal.\n\n        Finally, in Jones v. State, the defendant sought at trial to admit\nthe grand jury testimony of a witness who asserted her Fifth\nAmendment privilege against self-incrimination and refused to\ntestify. The State objected, claiming hearsay. We concluded that\nthe defendant failed to preserve error because he never specified\nwhich portions of the witness’s testimony he wanted to admit into\nevidence. We said:\n\n             The trial court need never sort through challenged\n      evidence in order to segregate the admissible from the\n      excludable, nor is the trial court required to admit only\n      the former part or exclude only the latter part. If\n      evidence is offered and challenged which contains\n      some of each, the trial court may safely admit it all or\n      exclude it all, and the losing party, no matter who he is,\n      will be made to suffer on appeal the consequences of\n      his insufficiently specific offer or objection. In this case,\n      because the trial court chose to exclude the evidence,\n      appellant is the party adversely affected by his own\n      default. Because appellant failed to specify which\n      portion of the transcript he intended to introduce into\n      evidence, the court was presented with a proffer\n      containing both admissible and inadmissible evidence.\n      When evidence which is partially admissible and\n      partially inadmissible is excluded, a party may not\n      complain upon appeal unless the admissible evidence\n      was specifically offered.\n\n\n\n\n                                   22\n\f                              Application\n\n        In this case, Reyna argued to the trial judge that the evidence\nshould be admitted for “credibility.” He said that he was “not offering\nit to prove the truth of the matter asserted” and “not offering it to go\ninto her sexuality.”       Instead, he argued, “I’m offering it to\ndemonstrate that as to prior sexual activities, that she made\nallegations that there were prior sexual allegations, and recanted.”\n\n       Reyna did not cite to any rules of evidence, cases, or\nconstitutional provisions. Reyna’s references to “the truth of the\nmatter asserted” reflect that he was arguing that the evidence was\nnot hearsay under Evidence Rule 801(d). His claim that he was not\noffering it “to go into her sexuality” reflects his argument that the\nevidence should not be excluded under Evidence Rule 412(b).\nThese arguments are both based on the Rules of Evidence.\nReyna’s reference to “credibility” could be a reference to either the\nRules of Evidence or the Confrontation Clause.\n\n      Reyna told the trial judge that the purpose of admitting the\nevidence was to attack the victim’s credibility, but he did not provide\nthe basis for admitting the evidence. He could have been relying on\nthe Rules of Evidence or the Confrontation Clause. It was up to the\njudge to discern some basis for admitting the evidence.\n\n       We have said that “(t)he purpose of requiring (an) objection is\nto give to the trial court or the opposing party the opportunity to\ncorrect the error or remove the basis for the objection.” When a\ndefendant’s objection encompasses complaints under both the\nTexas Rules of Evidence and the Confrontation Clause, the\nobjection is not sufficiently specific to preserve error. An objection\non hearsay does not preserve error on Confrontation Clause\ngrounds.\n\n       Although this case involves a proffer of evidence rather than\nan objection, the same rationale applies. Reyna did not argue that\nthe Confrontation Clause demanded admission of the evidence.\nReyna’s arguments for admitting the evidence could refer to either\nthe Rules of Evidence or the Confrontation Clause. His arguments\nabout hearsay did not put the trial judge on notice that he was\nmaking a Confrontation Clause argument. Because Reyna “did not\nclearly articulate” that the Confrontation Clause demanded\nadmission of the evidence, the trial judge “never had the opportunity\n\n\n                                  23\n\f      to rule upon” this rationale. As the losing party, Reyna must “suffer\n      on appeal the consequences of his insufficiently specific offer.”\n      Reyna did not do “everything necessary to bring to the judge’s\n      attention the evidence rule or statute in question and its precise and\n      proper application to the evidence in question.” 30\n\n      In the case now before this court, Appellant offered the evidence on the\n\nvague basis of “possible” opinion testimony. He did not sustain his burden of\n\nexplaining to the trial court on the record, and by extension to us, why Redmon’s\n\nand Brown’s testimony was admissible—whether under an evidentiary rule or\n\nstatute, as an exception to an evidentiary rule or statute, or under a constitutional\n\nprovision. We therefore overrule Appellant’s fourth and fifth issues.\n\nConclusion\n\n      Having overruled Appellant’s five issues on appeal, we affirm the trial\n\ncourt’s judgments.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    /s/ Lee Ann Dauphinot\n                                                    LEE ANN DAUPHINOT\n                                                    JUSTICE\n\nPANEL: DAUPHINOT, GARDNER, and WALKER, JJ.\n\nPUBLISH\n\nDELIVERED: August 6, 2015\n\n\n\n      30\n         Reyna v.

The trial court sentenced him accordingly, ordering the\n\nsentences to be served concurrently. Appellant brings five issues on appeal,\n\nchallenging the sufficiency of the evidence to show the aggravating element for\n\nthe six convictions of aggravated sexual assault of a child (counts one through\n\nfour, eight, and nine) and contending that the State misrepresented the law during\n\nvoir dire and that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding evidence of the\n\ncomplainant’s prior rape accusation against a neighbor and the testimony of two\n\nother witnesses. Because the evidence is sufficient to support the jury’s verdict\n\nand because the trial court committed no reversible error, we affirm the trial\n\ncourt’s judgments.\n\nBrief Facts\n\n      Appellant and Complainant’s mother (Mother) had been a couple, had\n\nshared a home with Complainant and her brother, and were the parents of twin\n\nboys, Complainant’s younger half-brothers. Appellant and Mother parted ways\n\nand went through a custody battle over the twins. On July, 4, 2012, Complainant,\n\nwho was fourteen years old at the time, was at Appellant’s home with her twin\n\nbrothers.   Complainant and Mother were not getting along around this time.\n\nAppellant told Complainant that he wanted to put Mother in a hole and hire some\n\nMexican assassins to hurt her. In the same conversation, Appellant suggested\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\fthat Complainant have sex with him to make Mother mad, but Complainant\n\nrefused his offer.\n\n        Later that same month, Complainant, along with her twin brothers, visited\n\nAppellant’s parents in El Paso. During this trip, Complainant received messages\n\nfrom someone who identified himself as “Jayylo” through Kik, an application on\n\nher cell phone. Jayylo sent pictures of his penis to her. She responded by\n\n“sen[ding] inappropriate pictures of [her] boobs.”   She never gave Jayylo her\n\nhome address or her real name.       Jayylo continued to send more pictures of\n\nhimself to her. When Complainant threatened to stop sending Jayylo pictures, he\n\nthreatened to send the photos she had sent him to her school and to the\n\nmailboxes of Mother and her neighbors.           Complainant noticed that the\n\nbackground of one of the photos he sent her resembled a portion of Appellant’s\n\nhouse. Complainant was then suspicious that Appellant was Jayylo.\n\n        She confronted Appellant, but he denied having a Kik account. About an\n\nhour later, Appellant called Complainant back and asked her why he had pictures\n\nof her boobs in his mailbox. Complainant started crying and told him what had\n\nhappened with Jayylo and that he had threatened her. Complainant also told\n\nAppellant’s mother why she was crying, and Appellant got mad at Complainant\n\nfor telling his mother. Complainant turned fifteen years old while she was in El\n\nPaso.\n\n        When Complainant returned home from El Paso, she began receiving text\n\nmessages from Jayylo sent directly to her cell phone number.        Complainant\n\n\n                                        3\n\fnoticed that the first six digits of Jayylo’s phone number were the same as\n\nAppellant’s cell phone number. Jayylo told her that he got her phone number\n\nfrom one of her friends, which Complainant knew not to be true.           Whenever\n\nComplainant asked Jayylo who he really was, he would change his story of how\n\nComplainant was supposed to know him and how old he was. Jayylo texted\n\nComplainant almost every day at different times of the day. But she could never\n\nget a response when she called him.\n\n      Jayylo continued threatening Complainant and demanded that she send\n\nhim more photos, have sex with Appellant, videotape it, and send the video to\n\nJayylo. Complainant refused. Jayylo put one of the photos Complainant had sent\n\nhim on a Facebook page he had created and threatened to add all of her friends\n\nto that page. Appellant told Complainant that Jayylo was also contacting him, but\n\nshe never saw any of the messages that Appellant claimed to have received.\n\n      Appellant and Complainant spoke about the situation and decided to\n\nacquiesce to Jayylo’s demands.          Complainant and Appellant had sexual\n\nintercourse in Appellant’s house while Complainant’s twin brothers were asleep.\n\nFollowing Jayylo’s demands, Appellant and Complainant continued their sexual\n\nrelationship. They had sexual intercourse “eight to eleven times[,] [m]aybe more,”\n\nfrom August 2012 to November 2012. These sexual encounters would occur at\n\neither Appellant’s or Complainant’s home.\n\n      Complainant testified that she texted Jayylo that it was getting harder for\n\nher to keep these incidents a secret, and shortly after she sent this text, Appellant\n\n\n                                         4\n\fcalled her and told her that they did not “have to do it anymore.” Appellant then\n\ntold Complainant a story about\n\n      a girl who was babysitting this guy’s kids, and he ended up raping\n      her. And then she went to court, and then he pretended to be\n      somebody that he wasn’t and hit her up on Facebook and that they\n      met up thinking it was somebody else, and he killed her.\n\nThis story scared Complainant. At trial, she testified that Appellant knew people\n\nfrom Mexico who were in the Mexican Mafia. Although Complainant testified that\n\nAppellant never specifically threatened her, she also testified that he made it\n\nclear that if he could hurt Mother, he could hurt Complainant too. In December\n\n2012, Complainant made an outcry to Mother’s friend. Shortly afterward, the\n\ndecision to call the police was made. Appellant pled not guilty to all counts of an\n\neighteen-count indictment alleging that he had committed sexual assault and\n\naggravated sexual assault on various dates against Complainant.\n\n      Outside the presence of the jury, in an in-camera hearing, Appellant\n\npresented evidence from Ricky May. May lived in Complainant’s neighborhood\n\naround 2008 to 2009.      He testified that when he was eighteen years old,\n\nComplainant would contact him “through phone [and] text messaging, trying to get\n\n[him] to have sexual intercourse with her” because she was “horny.” May refused\n\nComplainant’s offer, but he heard that Complainant had told people in their\n\nneighborhood that he had raped her, which he denied. May was never charged\n\nwith or arrested for rape. The State objected to May’s testimony on hearsay\n\ngrounds.\n\n\n\n                                        5\n\f       THE COURT:               Response?\n\n       [PROSECUTOR]: Once again, Your Honor, this is an opinion based\n                     upon hearsay. There’s no proof that she ever\n                     said these things.        And this is the type of\n                     reputation and opinion evidence that is, I believe,\n                     prohibited under 412 as is relating to sexual\n                     conduct and it’s not fitting in one of the categories\n                     that allows for past behavior to be admissible.\n\nThe trial court sustained the State’s objection, and May was not permitted to\n\ntestify in front of the jury.\n\n       Appellant also offered testimony from Jeannie Redmon outside the\n\npresence of the jury.       Redmon testified that she had known Complainant for\n\n“[a]pproximately seven to eight years.” Redmon testified that Complainant was\n\n“untruthful” because (1) she took items that belonged to Redmon’s daughter, told\n\nRedmon that Redmon’s daughter had given her the items when in fact, Redmon’s\n\ndaughter had not, and instructed Redmon’s daughter to similarly lie; (2) she\n\nwould tell Redmon and her daughter that she was dating people whom she was\n\nnot dating; (3) she had said that a boy across the street had raped her; and\n\n(4) she lied about giving out her phone number to boys at a waterpark when\n\nRedmon asked her if she had done so. Redmon also testified that she thought\n\nher daughter and Complainant had gone to pornographic websites on Redmon’s\n\nhome computer.         Appellant offered Redmon’s testimony as her opinion on\n\nComplainant’s truthfulness. The State objected to Redmon’s testimony:\n\n       We’ll object under rule 608 and 609, also 404. I think if this witness\n       knew [Complainant] presently, we would be legally okay with her\n       opinion that she’s untruthful, but I think four years ago is a little bit too\n\n\n                                            6\n\f       remote. And certainly, even if that was allowed, the rules, specifically\n       608(b)[,] disallow specific instances of conduct. So we would object\n       to any specific instances.\n\n              Additionally, it sounds like almost all of this is hearsay and,\n       except for perhaps the opinion as to truthfulness. But the porn use, I\n       don’t think we can say that this witness knows with her own personal\n       knowledge that it was definitely [Complainant]. I think perhaps she’s\n       basing that off of what her daughter has told her. And the same with\n       the false claim of rape, she’s admitted on cross she really does not\n       know what happened.\n\nThe trial court sustained the State’s objections, and Redmon was not permitted to\n\ntestify in front of the jury.\n\n       Appellant also presented evidence from Denise Brown outside the\n\npresence of the jury.       Brown testified that Complainant was friends with her\n\ndaughter and that she knew Complainant in 2009 and 2010. Brown testified that\n\nComplainant was untruthful because Complainant (1) spread rumors that Brown’s\n\ndaughter was pregnant and (2) took some fingernail polish belonging to Brown’s\n\ndaughter without permission.            Brown also testified that Complainant was\n\nflirtatious   with   boys       and   opined   that   Complainant   was   promiscuous.\n\nComplainant’s friendship with Brown’s daughter ended when Brown’s daughter\n\nbegan dating a boy whom Complainant had previously dated, and Complainant\n\nbegan calling Brown’s daughter a “slut.”              The State objected to Brown’s\n\ntestimony:\n\n       The State would object as to . . . this witness . . . having no personal\n       knowledge of the things that she has referenced as far as her basis\n       for determining this—[Complainant’s] credibility. She’s basing it upon\n       hearsay. So we would object under 608.\n\n\n\n                                               7\n\f           Also, as far as going into specific instances of conduct, she\n      doesn’t—she did not personally observe them or have personal\n      knowledge as to them.\n\n            Also, we’d object under 404, 403 as to her general\n      characterization     of  [Complainant’s   being]     boy    crazy,\n      promiscuous. . . . [S]he has clearly demonstrated her own bias\n      towards [Complainant] where she does not apply the standard to her\n      own daughter as she does for [Complainant], even though they’re\n      engaged in the same conduct.\n\nThe trial court sustained the State’s rule 608 objection.\n\nSufficiency of the Evidence\n\n      In his first issue, Appellant argues that the evidence is insufficient to\n\nsupport the jury’s determination that, during the alleged aggravated sexual\n\nassaults, he, “by acts or words placed [Complainant] in fear that death or serious\n\nbodily injury would be imminently inflicted on [her] or [her mother],” as alleged in\n\ncounts one through four, eight, and nine.\n\n      In our due-process review of the sufficiency of the evidence to support a\n\nconviction, we view all the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict to\n\ndetermine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential\n\nelements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.1 This standard gives full play\n\nto the responsibility of the trier of fact to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      Jackson v.

State 8 and its progeny to argue that the threats\n\nwere not imminent because they were conditional.           The Blount court found\n\ninsufficient the attackers’ telling the victim that if she told, they would come back\n\nand kill her because the threat was conditional. 9 As the State points out, Blount\n\nrelied on a former version of the statute that required not only that the threat was\n\nmade but that it “compelled submission to the rape.” 10         That language was\n\nremoved from the statute when it was later amended, and consequently, as the\n\nState argues, it does not apply to this offense. 11\n\n\n      8\n       </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1761440\"><a href=\"/opinion/1761440/blount-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">164</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.

App. P. 33.1(a)(2); Everitt, 407 S.W.3d at 263.\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\fExcluded Evidence About Complainant\n\n      In his third, fourth, and fifth issues, Appellant argues that the trial court\n\nreversibly erred by refusing to allow him to present the testimony of May,\n\nRedmon, and Brown that Complainant had made a prior false rape allegation\n\nagainst a neighbor and that she was untruthful. Judge Cochran has explained,\n\n             Trials involving sexual assault may raise particular evidentiary\n      and constitutional concerns because the credibility of both the\n      complainant and defendant is a central, often dispositive, issue.\n      Sexual assault cases are frequently “he said, she said” trials in\n      which the jury must reach a unanimous verdict based solely upon\n      two diametrically different versions of an event, unaided by any\n      physical, scientific, or other corroborative evidence. Thus, the Rules\n      of Evidence, especially Rule 403, should be used sparingly to\n      exclude relevant, otherwise admissible evidence that might bear\n      upon the credibility of either the defendant or complainant in such\n      “he said, she said” cases. And Texas law, as well as the federal\n      constitution, requires great latitude when the evidence deals with a\n      witness’s specific bias, motive, or interest to testify in a particular\n      fashion.\n\n              But, as the Supreme Court noted in Davis v. Alaska, there is\n      an important distinction between an attack on the general credibility\n      of a witness and a more particular attack on credibility that reveals\n      “possible biases, prejudices, or ulterior motives of the witness as\n      they may relate directly to issues or personalities in the case at\n      hand.” Thus, under Davis, “the exposure of a witness’ motivation in\n      testifying is a proper and important function of the constitutionally\n      protected right of cross-examination.” However, as Justice Stewart\n      noted in concurrence, the Court neither held nor suggested that the\n      Constitution confers a right to impeach the general credibility of a\n      witness through otherwise prohibited modes of cross-examination.\n      Thus, the Davis Court did not hold that a defendant has an absolute\n      constitutional right to impeach the general credibility of a witness in\n      any fashion that he chooses. But the constitution is offended if the\n      state evidentiary rule would prohibit him from cross-examining a\n\n\n\n\n                                        13\n\f      witness concerning possible motives, bias, and prejudice to such an\n      extent that he could not present a vital defensive theory. 18\n\n      A witness’s credibility may be attacked in three ways: opinion or reputation\n\nfor general truthfulness or untruthfulness and cross-examination on specific\n\ninstances of conduct that establish bias, self-interest, or motive for testifying as\n\nhe or she did. 19 Opinion evidence is not the same as reputation evidence. 20 As\n\nthis court has explained,\n\n      Reputation witnesses’ testimony must be based on discussion with\n      others about the subject, or on hearing others discuss the person’s\n      reputation, and not just on personal knowledge. Rule 405 requires\n      only “substantial familiarity” with the reputation of the accused. 21\n\n      Reputation evidence, then, must necessarily be grounded in hearsay. 22\n\nAn objection that the testimony of reputation evidence is hearsay and not based\n\non personal knowledge thus will not lie. 23 Opinion testimony is governed by rule\n\nof evidence 701 and must be based on personal observation. 24\n\n\n      18\n        Hammer v.

Evid. 701.\n\n\n\n                                        14\n\f      Within this general framework, Judge Cochran, speaking for the\n\nunanimous Hammer court, has explained why Texas, unlike many other states,\n\ndoes not allow a defendant in a sexual assault case to impeach the complainant\n\nwith evidence of prior false accusations:\n\n             The theory for admitting prior false accusations of rape in a\n      sex-offense prosecution is frequently analogized to Aesop’s story of\n      “The Boy Who Cried Wolf.” A past false accusation makes it more\n      likely that the witness lacks credibility and thus should not be\n      believed concerning this accusation. But in Aesop’s fable, there\n      really was a wolf, and it killed the sheep. The moral of that story was\n      “Nobody believes a liar . . . even when he is telling the truth.” A\n      criminal trial, however, is designed to find the truth about a specific\n      incident, not to decide whether someone has lied in the past about\n      the presence of wolves or about being raped. Prior false allegations\n      of rape do not tend to prove or disprove any of the elements of the\n      charged sexual offense.\n\n            Therefore, Texas, unlike some jurisdictions, has not created a\n      per se exception to Rule 608(b)’s general prohibition against\n      impeachment with specific instances of conduct to admit evidence of\n      the complainant’s prior false allegations of abuse or molestation.\n      The inferential chain of logic that is barred by Rule 608(b) is this:\n\n            The witness lied to his employer (or did some specific act of\n            dishonesty)\n\n            That specific conduct proves dishonest character;\n\n            Therefore, the witness is generally dishonest and should not\n            be believed in this case.\n\n      Applied to prior false accusations, the barred evidentiary chain is\n      this:\n\n            Complainant made a prior false accusation;\n\n            That specific conduct proves dishonest character;\n\n            Therefore, the complainant is generally dishonest and should\n            not be believed in this case.\n\n\n                                        15\n\f       This is precisely the prohibited propensity chain of logic—\n“Once a thief, always a thief,” “Once a liar, always a liar”—that\nunderlies both Rules 404(b) and 608(b).           A sexual assault\ncomplainant is not a volunteer for an exercise in character\nassassination. Several federal courts have held that exclusion of\nthis evidence, offered to attack the victim’s general credibility, does\nnot violate the Confrontation Clause.\n\n       If, however, the cross-examiner offers evidence of a prior false\naccusation of sexual activity for some purpose other than a\npropensity attack upon the witness’s general character for\ntruthfulness, it may well be admissible under our state evidentiary\nrules.\n\n      For example, in Billodeau v. State, we held that the trial court\nshould have admitted evidence that the child complainant in that\naggravated sexual assault prosecution had made threats to falsely\naccuse two neighbors of sexual molestation. We held that such\nevidence supported the defensive theory that the complainant’s\nmotive in accusing the defendant of sexual molestation was “rage\nand anger” when he was thwarted. Evidence of threats to accuse\nothers of sexual molestation when he displayed “rage and anger” at\nbeing thwarted is some evidence of a common motive for accusing\nthe defendant of sexual molestation. The chain of logic is as follows:\n\n      The victim makes false accusations in certain circumstances\nand for certain reasons;\n\n      Those circumstances and reasons are present in this case;\n\n      Therefore, the victim made a false accusation in this case.\n\n       One might even call this modus operandi evidence admissible\nunder Rule 404(b). Evidence of other acts or wrongs may be\nadmissible under Rule 404(b) to prove such matters as motive,\nintent, scheme, or any other relevant purpose except conduct in\nconformity with bad character. Even “the doctrine of chances” has\nbeen invoked as a possible basis for admitting evidence of a victim’s\nprior false accusation of rape. Similarly, evidence of a victim’s prior\nsexual activity may be admissible under Rule 412, the Texas Rape\nShield Law, when offered to establish the victim’s motive or bias\nagainst the defendant.\n\n\n\n\n                                  16\n\f              In sum, several different state evidentiary rules permit the use\n      of prior false accusations when offered to show the witness’s bias or\n      motive or for some other relevant, noncharacter purpose. The\n      Confrontation Clause mandate of Davis v. Alaska is not inconsistent\n      with Texas evidence law. Thus, compliance with a rule of evidence\n      will, in most instances, avoid a constitutional question concerning the\n      admissibility of such evidence. 25\n\nWe now examine the case at bar.\n\n      Prior Rape\n\n      Appellant argues that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding\n\nMay’s testimony that he had heard a rumor that Complainant was telling people\n\nthat he had sexually assaulted her and Redmon’s testimony pertaining to the\n\nalleged incident.   Appellant offered May’s testimony under rule of evidence\n\n404(b). 26 While Appellant now argues that the trial court’s ruling abridged certain\n\nof his constitutional rights, at trial he spoke only of credibility and Rule 404(b).\n\nAppellant’s complaints at trial do not conform to his constitutional complaints on\n\nappeal; we therefore do not address his constitutional complaints. 27\n\n      Additionally, May’s testimony dealt with rumors on the street; it did not\n\nconstitute testimony of Complainant’s reputation for truthfulness, nor were his\n\nclaims that he had heard that she was spreading rumors in any way\n\n\n      25\n        Hammer, 296 S.W.3d at 564–66 (footnotes omitted).\n      26\n        Tex.

State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2280148\"><a href=\"/opinion/2280148/lovill-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">687</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 691–92\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2009).\n\n\n\n                                        17\n\fsubstantiated to provide a basis for an opinion that she was not worthy of belief\n\nunder oath. And to the extent that his testimony was intended to be evidence of\n\nprior false accusations of sexual assault, such testimony is not admissible for the\n\npurpose of showing her character conformity or propensity to lie. 28\n\n      Although Appellant also argues that the evidence was admissible to show\n\nmotive and modus operandi, May candidly admitted that Complainant never\n\naccused him to his face of raping her. His belief that she had accused him was\n\nbased on rumors that he had heard. The record does not establish confirmation\n\nof May’s belief that she falsely accused him of rape. Nor do the rumors he heard\n\nsuggest a motive for falsely accusing Appellant or a modus operandi. May said\n\nthat Complainant would ask him to have sex with her, and he refused. But we\n\ncannot discern how the rumors he heard that she was accusing him of rape were\n\never verified.   The record before this court therefore does not establish the\n\nadmissibility of this evidence of purported false accusations of rape under rule\n\n404(b).\n\n      At trial, Appellant explained in seeking admission of the false accusation\n\ntestimony, “the false claim of rape is going to credibility.”    We hold that the\n\nrumors of false rape accusations were not admissible, and based on the record\n\nbefore us, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellant’s\n\n\n\n      28\n          See Hammer, 296 S.W.3d at 564.\n\n\n\n                                        18\n\frequest to present this evidence before the jury. We overrule Appellant’s third\n\nissue.\n\nRedmon’s and Brown’s Opinion Testimony\n\n         In his fourth and fifth issues, Appellant complains of the exclusion of the\n\ntestimony of Redmon and Brown concerning their opinions of Complainant’s\n\ncredibility.   As we understand the record, Appellant appears to have offered\n\nthese opinions by having the women explain specific acts that they suspected\n\nhad occurred and speculate on others. He did not offer their testimony on any\n\nconstitutional basis. We therefore do not address the constitutional arguments\n\nhe raises on appeal. 29\n\n         Redmon’s testimony was based on her belief that Complainant had lied\n\nand had told Redmon’s daughter to lie about having given Complainant things\n\nthat Complainant had stolen from Redmon’s daughter. Redmon also believed\n\nthat Complainant had lied to her and to her daughter about dating, smoking\n\nmarijuana, and being raped. Appellant explained to the trial court that he was\n\noffering Redmon’s testimony as “possible opinion testimony on truthfulness.”\n\n         Brown believed that Complainant had spread untruthful rumors about her\n\ndaughter and that she had stolen her daughter’s nail polish. We are not clear on\n\nthe legal basis for which Appellant offered this evidence, other than as an opinion\n\n\n\n         29\n          See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a)(1); Lovill, 319 S.W.3d at 691–92.\n\n\n\n                                          19\n\fof Complainant’s truthfulness. Judge Keasler has explained for the Texas Court\n\nof Criminal Appeals,\n\n      [A] less common notion of error preservation comes into play in this\n      case, although certainly not a novel one. Professors Goode,\n      Wellborn and Sharlot refer to it as “party responsibility.” They\n      explain it this way:\n\n                   To the question, which party has the responsibility\n            regarding any particular matter, it is infallibly accurate to\n            answer with another question:              which party is\n            complaining now on appeal? This is because in a real\n            sense both parties are always responsible for the\n            application of any evidence rule to any evidence.\n            Whichever party complains on appeal about the trial\n            judge’s action must, at the earliest opportunity, have\n            done everything necessary to bring to the judge’s\n            attention the evidence rule in question and its precise\n            and proper application to the evidence in question.\n\n      The basis for party responsibility is, among other things, Appellate\n      Rule 33.1. It provides that as a prerequisite to presenting a\n      complaint for appellate review, the record must show that the party\n      “stated the grounds for the ruling that (he) sought from the trial court\n      with sufficient specificity to make the trial court aware of the\n      complaint.” So it is not enough to tell the judge that evidence is\n      admissible. The proponent, if he is the losing party on appeal, must\n      have told the judge why the evidence was admissible.\n\n             We recently discussed this notion in Martinez v. State. There,\n      the defendant moved to suppress oral statements due to the State’s\n      failure to comply with Art. 20.17. The State argued for the first time\n      on appeal that Art. 20.17 did not apply. We concluded that the State\n      forfeited this argument by failing to bring it to the trial judge’s\n      attention.    We explained that “both Texas Rule of Appellate\n      Procedure 33.1 and Texas Rule of Evidence 103 are ‘judge-\n      protecting’ rules of error preservation. The basic principle of both\n      rules is that of ‘party responsibility.’” We recognized that “the party\n      complaining on appeal (whether it be the State or the defendant)\n      about a trial court’s admission, exclusion, or suppression of evidence\n      must, at the earliest opportunity, have done everything necessary to\n      bring to the judge’s attention the evidence rule or statute in question\n\n\n                                         20\n\fand its precise and proper application to the evidence in question.”\nThe issue, we said, “is not whether the appealing party is the State\nor the defendant or whether the trial court’s ruling is legally ‘correct’\nin every sense, but whether the complaining party on appeal brought\nto the trial court’s attention the very complaint that party is now\nmaking on appeal.”\n\n      Similarly, in Willover v. State, the defendant sought to admit\ntwo videotaped interviews of the victim. At trial,\n\n      it (was) clear that, although (the defendant) did not\n      actually recite the specific rule of evidence he was\n      relying upon, (he) sought to admit the videotapes for\n      impeachment purposes. (He) did not argue, nor was\n      there any discussion at trial, that the tapes were not\n      hearsay or that the videotapes were admissible under\n      any exception to the hearsay rule other than Article\n      38.071 or for impeachment purposes.\n\n      On appeal, the defendant argued for the first time that the\nvideotapes were not hearsay. We relied on the notion of “party\nresponsibility” to reject this argument because “(i)n order to have\nevidence admitted under a hearsay exception, the proponent of the\nevidence must specify which exception he is relying upon.” It was\nup to the defendant, we said, and “not the trial court, to specify\nwhich exception to the hearsay rule he was relying upon or to\nspecify how the evidence was not hearsay.”\n\n       In some cases, we have applied the “party responsibility”\ntheory without using those precise words. In Clark v. State, the\nState presented the testimony of Dr. James Grigson that the\ndefendant would be a future danger. The defendant sought at trial\nto introduce a letter and accompanying report which listed eleven\nindividuals convicted of capital murder whose sentences had later\nbeen commuted or reduced. In several of those cases, Dr. Grigson\nhad predicted that the individual would be a future danger. The trial\ncourt refused to admit the evidence.\n\n       On appeal, the defendant argued that the excluded evidence\nwas admissible to impeach Dr. Grigson and show that his prior\nfuture dangerousness predictions had turned out to be incorrect.\nBut the defendant had not articulated this basis for admission at trial.\nAt trial, he had argued the evidence was admissible to impeach\n\n\n                                   21\n\fstatements that Dr. Grigson had made in Lubbock County. The\nState had objected that the impeachment went to a collateral matter,\nand the trial judge had agreed.\n\n      We rejected the defendant’s argument on appeal because he\n“did not clearly articulate” that he wanted to admit the evidence to\ndemonstrate Grigson’s past mistakes in predicting future\ndangerousness. We said that the trial judge “never had the\nopportunity to rule upon (the defendant’s) appellate rationale.” Since\nthe defendant “did not sufficiently clearly expressly offer the\nevidence for the purpose which he now claims on appeal,” that\nargument could not be raised on appeal.\n\n        Finally, in Jones v. State, the defendant sought at trial to admit\nthe grand jury testimony of a witness who asserted her Fifth\nAmendment privilege against self-incrimination and refused to\ntestify. The State objected, claiming hearsay. We concluded that\nthe defendant failed to preserve error because he never specified\nwhich portions of the witness’s testimony he wanted to admit into\nevidence. We said:\n\n             The trial court need never sort through challenged\n      evidence in order to segregate the admissible from the\n      excludable, nor is the trial court required to admit only\n      the former part or exclude only the latter part. If\n      evidence is offered and challenged which contains\n      some of each, the trial court may safely admit it all or\n      exclude it all, and the losing party, no matter who he is,\n      will be made to suffer on appeal the consequences of\n      his insufficiently specific offer or objection. In this case,\n      because the trial court chose to exclude the evidence,\n      appellant is the party adversely affected by his own\n      default. Because appellant failed to specify which\n      portion of the transcript he intended to introduce into\n      evidence, the court was presented with a proffer\n      containing both admissible and inadmissible evidence.\n      When evidence which is partially admissible and\n      partially inadmissible is excluded, a party may not\n      complain upon appeal unless the admissible evidence\n      was specifically offered.\n\n\n\n\n                                   22\n\f                              Application\n\n        In this case, Reyna argued to the trial judge that the evidence\nshould be admitted for “credibility.” He said that he was “not offering\nit to prove the truth of the matter asserted” and “not offering it to go\ninto her sexuality.”       Instead, he argued, “I’m offering it to\ndemonstrate that as to prior sexual activities, that she made\nallegations that there were prior sexual allegations, and recanted.”\n\n       Reyna did not cite to any rules of evidence, cases, or\nconstitutional provisions. Reyna’s references to “the truth of the\nmatter asserted” reflect that he was arguing that the evidence was\nnot hearsay under Evidence Rule 801(d). His claim that he was not\noffering it “to go into her sexuality” reflects his argument that the\nevidence should not be excluded under Evidence Rule 412(b).\nThese arguments are both based on the Rules of Evidence.\nReyna’s reference to “credibility” could be a reference to either the\nRules of Evidence or the Confrontation Clause.\n\n      Reyna told the trial judge that the purpose of admitting the\nevidence was to attack the victim’s credibility, but he did not provide\nthe basis for admitting the evidence. He could have been relying on\nthe Rules of Evidence or the Confrontation Clause. It was up to the\njudge to discern some basis for admitting the evidence.\n\n       We have said that “(t)he purpose of requiring (an) objection is\nto give to the trial court or the opposing party the opportunity to\ncorrect the error or remove the basis for the objection.” When a\ndefendant’s objection encompasses complaints under both the\nTexas Rules of Evidence and the Confrontation Clause, the\nobjection is not sufficiently specific to preserve error. An objection\non hearsay does not preserve error on Confrontation Clause\ngrounds.\n\n       Although this case involves a proffer of evidence rather than\nan objection, the same rationale applies. Reyna did not argue that\nthe Confrontation Clause demanded admission of the evidence.\nReyna’s arguments for admitting the evidence could refer to either\nthe Rules of Evidence or the Confrontation Clause. His arguments\nabout hearsay did not put the trial judge on notice that he was\nmaking a Confrontation Clause argument. Because Reyna “did not\nclearly articulate” that the Confrontation Clause demanded\nadmission of the evidence, the trial judge “never had the opportunity\n\n\n                                  23\n\f      to rule upon” this rationale. As the losing party, Reyna must “suffer\n      on appeal the consequences of his insufficiently specific offer.”\n      Reyna did not do “everything necessary to bring to the judge’s\n      attention the evidence rule or statute in question and its precise and\n      proper application to the evidence in question.” 30\n\n      In the case now before this court, Appellant offered the evidence on the\n\nvague basis of “possible” opinion testimony. He did not sustain his burden of\n\nexplaining to the trial court on the record, and by extension to us, why Redmon’s\n\nand Brown’s testimony was admissible—whether under an evidentiary rule or\n\nstatute, as an exception to an evidentiary rule or statute, or under a constitutional\n\nprovision. We therefore overrule Appellant’s fourth and fifth issues.\n\nConclusion\n\n      Having overruled Appellant’s five issues on appeal, we affirm the trial\n\ncourt’s judgments.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    /s/ Lee Ann Dauphinot\n                                                    LEE ANN DAUPHINOT\n                                                    JUSTICE\n\nPANEL: DAUPHINOT, GARDNER, and WALKER, JJ.\n\nPUBLISH\n\nDELIVERED: August 6, 2015\n\n\n\n      30\n         Reyna v.
