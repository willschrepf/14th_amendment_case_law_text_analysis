(“CCS”) challenges the Army and\nAir Force Exchange Service’s (“AAFES”) award of a contract for internet and\ntelecommunications services to Resolute Partners, LLC (“Resolute”).               AAFES, a\nnonappropriated fund instrumentality of the United States Government (“NAFI”), provides\nmerchandise and services to active duty and reserve military members and their families.\nAAFES’ earnings support the Army’s Family Morale Welfare and Recreation Command\n(“FMWRC”) programs. CCS brings this bid protest invoking this Court’s general contract\njurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a), claiming that Defendant breached its implied duty to fairly\nconsider CCS’ proposal. This matter comes before this Court on CCS’ motion for summary\njudgment and Defendant’s and Intervenor’s motions for judgment on the Administrative Record\n(“AR”). CCS seeks its proposal preparation costs and an order remanding the procurement to\nAAFES.\n\n        CCS presents five grounds of protest. First, CCS claims that the Army Recreation\nMachine Program (“ARMP”), a subsidiary of FMWRC, acted as subcontractor to the awardee,\nResolute, in violation of 10 U.S.C. § 2492a. This statute prohibits Department of Defense\n(“DoD”) entities from offering or providing telecommunications services to consumers for a fee\nand from competing for contracts to provide such services. Second, CCS claims that FMWRC’s\nrole in the procurement created an organizational conflict of interest (“OCI”) because FMWRC\nshaped the solicitation and participated in the source selection process, and because FMWRC’s\nsubsidiary, ARMP, competed in the procurement as a subcontractor to the awardee. Third, CCS\nargues that the technical and price evaluations conducted by AAFES were unreasonable and\ncontrary to the terms of the solicitation. Fourth, CCS contends that AAFES improperly\ndetermined that Resolute was a responsible contractor. Lastly, CCS claims that an appearance of\nimpropriety tainted the competition because Resolute was indebted to AAFES and AAFES\nconsidered this debt in making the award decision.\n\n       The Court denies the protest. CCS waived its statutory violation and OCI claims because\nit knew the grounds for those claims prior to award but failed to timely raise them. The\nevaluation of proposals and responsibility determination were reasonable, and CCS failed to\ndemonstrate that either an OCI or an appearance of impropriety tainted the competitive process.\n\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f                                       Findings of Fact 2\n\nInformation Services Provided on Air Force and Army Installations\n\n        There are two kinds of information services provided on Air Force and Army\ninstallations, Personal Information Services and FMWRC Information Services. See AR 4, 119,\n366. Personal Information Services include “for-fee” internet, telephone, and television services\npaid for by civilian or military personnel for personal use -- for “unofficial services” -- in\nbarracks, housing, and internet cafes. AR 334, 362, 427-28, 1776. Prior to December 2009, both\nAAFES and FMWRC provided “for-fee” internet services on Army and Air Force installations.\nAR 119, 366. AAFES provided the services through contracts with internet service providers\n(“ISP”), while FMWRC utilized a government-owned infrastructure operated by ARMP to\nprovide the services. AR 2, 119, 366. This protest arose after FMWRC and AAFES executed an\nagreement to transfer management, sale, and operation of the for-fee internet services to AAFES.\nAR 4-7.\n\n        The FMWRC Information Services supported “official” business functions where users\ndo not pay a fee, and ARMP provided these free services using the FMWRC Information\nServices network, a telecommunications system of government-owned utilities and infrastructure\n-- the same infrastructure ARMP used to provide Personal Information Services. AR 1, 2, 334,\n427; see AR 119, 366, 8768, 8808, 8822, 8836.\n\nLegislative and Regulatory Changes Regarding the Provision of Personal Information\nServices\n\n        On February 23, 2009, AAFES and FMWRC entered into a Memorandum of\nUnderstanding (“MOU”) to “establish a non-competitive partnership between AAFES and\nFMWRC to provide common levels of personal information services based on best business\npractices and cost benefit analysis that minimizes the cost of services to individual users.” AR\n9158; see AR 9158-62. The MOU stated that the partnership would be “executed” in accordance\nwith implementing instructions that would “describe the detailed responsibilities” of each\npartner. AR 9159.\n\n        On May 11, 2009, Army, AAFES, and DoD officials met with the House Armed Services\nCommittee (“House Committee”) concerning the proposed plan to transfer all Personal\nInformation Services operations and related contracts to AAFES. See AR 10537. In a letter\ndated May 22, 2009, the House Committee approved this plan and provided the following\ndirection:\n\n       The Committee views military resale and nonappropriated fund business activities\n       as government entities that must not compete directly with private sector\n\n\n       2\n         These findings are derived from the AR as supplemented. As explained below, the\nCourt issues findings of fact because it resolves the protest on motions for judgment on the AR,\nnot motions for summary judgment. Findings of fact related to the evaluation and the alleged\norganization conflict of interest are included in the discussion.\n\n\n                                               3\n\f       enterprises capable of providing the desired services. In this regard, the\n       Committee directs that within the Department of Defense, no DoD entity may\n       either provide personal information services using DoD resources, personnel or\n       equipment, or compete for contracts to provide such services when the intent is to\n       charge users to recover cost or to earn profits. This prohibition does not prevent\n       or preclude the use of DoD personnel, resources or equipment to administer and\n       oversee personal information services contracts, nor does it preclude [AAFES]\n       from carrying out the plan to provide personal information services through\n       contractors as approved by the Committee.\n\nAR 10531.\n\n       The final version of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010\nincorporated the House Committee’s directive. See Pub. L. 111-84, § 651, 123 Stat. 2368. Now\ncodified at 10 U.S.C. § 2492a, this legislation became effective on October 28, 2009, and\nprovides:\n\n       (a) Limitation.—(1) Notwithstanding section 2492 of this title, the Secretary of\n       Defense may not authorize a Department of Defense entity to offer or provide\n       personal information services directly to users using Department resources,\n       personnel, or equipment, or compete for contracts to provide such personal\n       information services directly to users, if users will be charged a fee for the\n       personal information services to recover the cost incurred to provide the services\n       or to earn a profit.\n\n       (2) The limitation in paragraph (1) shall not be construed to prohibit or preclude\n       the use of Department resources, personnel, or equipment to administer or\n       facilitate personal information services contracts with private contractors.\n\n                                             ***\n\n       (c) Personal Information Services Defined.—In this section, the term “personal\n       information services” means the provision of Internet, telephone, or television\n       services to consumers.\n\n10 U.S.C. § 2492a (Supp. III 2009).\n\n     On December 24, 2009, FMWRC and AAFES finalized a Memorandum of Agreement\n(“MOA”) implementing the requirements of § 2492a. AR 4-7. The December MOA provided:\n\n       AAFES will be responsible for provisioning for-fee Internet services on Military\n       Installations through a commercial Internet Service Provider (ISP).\n\n       FMWRC will transfer for-fee internet service programs currently operated by\n       ARMP to AAFES on a mutually agreed upon schedule that minimizes disruption\n       to the customer. All transfers must be completed by 31 December 2010.\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f                                              ***\n\n       To the extent that AAFES’ commercial ISP[s] can provide their own\n       infrastructure to maintain connectivity at existing locations they may do so.\n       Otherwise, AAFES’ ISP[s] will have the option of using ARMP provided\n       resources.\n\n                                              ***\n\n       The level of ARMP Internet Services provided to the AAFES ISP will meet or\n       exceed current service levels.\n\n       [FMWRC will] [o]ffer to sell or lease existing Internet assets dedicated to\n       Personal Information Services . . . directly to AAFES’ ISPs at a negotiated value\n       where AAFES’ ISPs intend to use existing assets and/or infrastructure to deliver\n       the Internet services to a location.\n\nAR 5-6. To implement this “transfer of function,” AAFES was to “competitively award and/or\nmodify existing contracts for for-fee Internet services transferred from FMWRC to AAFES.”\nAR 6. The December MOA further stated: “There will be no transfer of Internet assets from\nFMWRC to AAFES as a component of this agreement. FMWRC through [its] ARMP program\nwill offer Internet network services as an option to AAFES’ ISP[s] for a fee.” AR 7.\n\nCCS’ and Resolute’s Bridge Contracts\n\n       As part of the transfer of Personal Information Services from FMWRC to AAFES,\nARMP awarded CCS a bridge contract on May 4, 2010, to use ARMP’s network infrastructure\nand equipment to provide Personal Information Services for consumers at 318 building locations\non military installations. AR 1867-92. CCS’ bridge contract was set to terminate on November\n30, 2011. AR 1868, 1875. The bridge contract provided that ARMP planned to use its network\nto provide bandwidth for personal information services, as it had before the bridge contract. AR\n1869-70.\n\n        On July 10, 2010, ARMP entered into a similar bridge contract with Intervenor Resolute,\nthat covered 243 buildings. See AR 2025-45.\n\nThe Instructions for Personal Information Services Implementation on FMWRC’s Website\n\n        “Implementation Instructions” were issued to “provide a centralized reference document”\nin support of the MOU governing the AAFES/FMWRC “non-competitive partnership” to\nprovide Personal Information Services. AR 330-63. This document, or a substantially similar\nversion, was available on FMWRC’s webpage as early as February 4, 2010, but it was not\nreferenced in the solicitation or directly disseminated to offerors in the procurement process. See\nid.; Def.’s Notice of Compliance ¶¶ 1-2, Nov. 21, 2011; Evard Decl. (“Third Evard Decl.”)\n¶ 5(1), Nov. 18, 2011 (Ex. A to Plaintiff’s Resp. to Nov. 15, 2011 Order); Guertin Decl. ¶ 4,\n\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\fNov. 21, 2011 (Ex. A to Intervenor’s Resp. to Nov. 15, 2011 Order). Nonetheless, Defendant\nincluded these Instructions, some 34 pages, in the AR. AR 330-63.\n\n        The purpose of the Implementing Instructions was to outline the procedures to\nsuccessfully deploy the AAFES/FMWRC partnership and identify the role, oversight, and\nmanagement responsibilities of AAFES to deliver Personal Information Services to service\nmembers. AR 331. Under a heading titled “Staff Planning,” the Implementing Instructions\nstated, “FMWRC will appoint a FMWRC Telecommunications Operations Manager as the\nprimary FMWRC Coordinator of the [Personal Information Services] partnership . . . .” AR 337.\nThe Instructions also stated, “FMWRC will assign one . . . Contracting Officer and one . . .\nBusiness Manager, under operational control of the [AAFES Vice President] . . . .” Id. The\nImplementing Instructions further specified that the business manager would be a voting member\nof the Source Selection Committee panels, participate in the development of new business\nrequirements, and have a role in developing contracting methodology. AR 351-52.\n\n        The Implementing Instructions also defined the role of the contracting officer, who was\nto develop and assist with Personal Information Services contract implementation and execution,\nand lead in the development and fulfillment of acquisition plans, contract requirements,\nsolicitation development, contract negotiations, and award. AR 353-54.\n\nThe Request for Information\n\n        On February 11, 2010, AAFES issued a Request for Information (“RFI”) to prospective\ncontractors to provide for-fee consumer telecommunication services at various military\ninstallations. AR 8. The RFI notified vendors that “ARMP [would be] able to provide AAFES\nselected suppliers” network support, but that “[a]ny agreements with ARMP [would] be\nindependent of contracts with AAFES.” AR 29. The RFI stated that after a solicitation was\nissued, ARMP would host an industry information day where attendees would gain an\nunderstanding of “ARMP provided services” and participate in an open forum to exchange\ninformation. Id.\n\nThe Draft Solicitation\n\n       On April 12, 2010, AAFES issued a draft solicitation for the for-fee ISP procurement.\nAR 118. The draft solicitation offered ARMP as a ‘“turnkey network’ and maintenance provider\nfor those locations where ARMP [had] installed infrastructure” and stated that “[i]f providers\nchoose to use ARMP, then ARMP shall assume the role of a sub-contractor to the prospective\nISP.” AR 119-20. The draft solicitation listed advantages of using the ARMP network solution\nthat were substantially reiterated in the final solicitation. AR 120-21, 367. The draft solicitation\nalso announced Industry Day, characterizing it as a “Site Survey” and an important event for\nprospective offerors. AR 118; see AR 126.\n\nIndustry Day\n\n      On April 28, 2010, AAFES and ARMP held Industry Day at Fort Carson, Colorado. AR\n277. Representatives from CCS including Mr. Tim Evard, CCS’ Executive Vice President,\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fattended Industry Day. AR 328-29, 2108. The Industry Day presentation, also referred to as a\npre-proposal conference, included an introduction to the “Key Procurement/Operations Team,”\nand an overview of ARMP’s services. AR 275-76, 279, 281-82; see AR 290. The record\ncontains the 68 slides used in the Industry Day presentation. AR 256-323.\n\n       As part of the Industry Day presentation, AAFES’ Chief for New Business and another\nAAFES employee showed attendees a slide identifying the “Key Procurement/Operations Team”\nas Cynthia Williams (Contracting Officer, AAFES), Nathanial Wills (Army Contracting\nSpecialist, FMWRC), Mike Kaucher (Chief for New Business, AAFES,) John Temple (Army\nBusiness Manager, FMWRC), David LaPradd (Telecommunications Operations Manager,\nFMWRC), and William Hart (General Manager, ARMP). AR 126, 279.\n\n        Industry Day attendees were informed that ARMP was an “operational element of\n[FMWRC]” that was “[c]reated to develop revenue to fund Morale, Welfare & Recreation\nprograms Army wide.” AR 274. A slide listing frequently asked questions stated that bidders\ncould partner with ARMP, and that ARMP would provide “installation site review coordination\nand service deployment.” AR 321. Another slide informed offerors that ARMP could provide a\nvariety of services: “Internet Gateway & LAN Services; Internet Access Device leasing,\nmanagement, and support; Service Leasing; Hardware Support; Security Services and Support;\nSystems Maintenance, Troubleshooting, and Support; Onsite Technical Service; Recreational\nMachine leasing, and Support; [and] Remote Technical Support.” AR 275. An additional slide\nindicated that ARMP “operated” in the Continental United States at “[m]ost major garrisons”\nwith “[p]lans to reach all garrisons in coming years.” AR 276.\n\n       A slide titled “Key Telecommunications Agreements/Policies” identified the February\n2009 Memorandum of Understanding, the December 2009 Memorandum of Agreement and an\nApril 2010 Army policy letter that provided guidance regarding the transition of the Army’s for-\nfee Personal Information Services to AAFES. AR 282; see AR 362-63. These three documents\nwere available on FMWRC’s website. Def.’s Notice of Compliance ¶ 2. The Industry Day slide\npresentation did not reference the Implementing Instructions. See AR 256-323. 3\n\nThe Solicitation\n\n        On May 12, 2010, AAFES issued solicitation number RFP ATI-09-010-10-014. AR 364-\n    4\n463. The purpose of the solicitation was to obtain “pre-paid,” “for-fee” internet services, with\nan option for voice, video, and “post-paid” internet, at 79 Army and Air Force installations in\nfive geographic locations in the United States. AR 376, 410-417. The solicitation contemplated\na five-year base period, with five one-year option periods. AR 376. Provision of services at\nother military bases within a geographic group was optional. Id. The solicitation further notified\n\n\n\n        3\n         On April 30, 2010, the contracting officer emailed Industry Day attendees a copy of the\n“presentations briefed at Industry Day.” AR 10468-69.\n        4\n       The solicitation was largely the same as the draft solicitation issued the prior month.\nCompare AR 119-231 with AR 366-463.\n\n\n                                                7\n\fofferors that service requirements could be expanded to military bases not listed in the\nsolicitation. AR 376, 378.\n\n       The solicitation expressly addressed ARMP’s role as a potential subcontractor. The\nExecutive Summary stated:\n\n      e. ARMP as a Potential Internet Sub-Contractor\n\n      1) ARMP has offered a “turnkey” network and maintenance provider agreement\n      for those Installations where ARMP infrastructure exists or is planned. At those\n      Installations, commercial ISPs will have an option of leasing the ARMP network\n      and equipment at a negotiated price, or [of providing] the necessary network and\n      equipment separately. If providers choose to utilize the ARMP network, then\n      ARMP shall assume the role of sub-contractor to the prospective ISP. The ISP’s\n      agreement with ARMP will be a separate contract from the contract with AAFES.\n\nAR 366-67 (emphasis omitted). Under the same paragraph, the solicitation listed “[s]ome\nadvantages of using the ARMP network and equipment:”\n\n      i.     The existing bandwidth, infrastructure and network components are\n             already in place which may prevent any break in current service and will\n             facilitate faster speed to market.\n\n      ii.    Turnkey operation for the new provider.\n\n      iii.   Maintenance, support, and installation of new equipment and upgrades as\n             necessary . . . .\n\n      iv.    Ability to continue to support customers without a break in service during\n             the transition period from ARMP to the competitively selected AAFES\n             ISP.\n\n      v.     Efficiency and economy which ARMP currently utilizes with [its]\n             installed infrastructure to support FMWRC mission related services.\n\n                                                 ***\n\n      vi.    ARMP has the capability to coordinate between the Installation\n             Management Command (INCOM) proponent activities on Army\n             Garrisons and the AAFES ISP to ensure proper implementation and has\n             the flexibility to adjust network configurations to accommodate growth\n             and mission changes.\n\n      vii.   ARMP provides Internet network access to a commercial carrier and\n             bandwidth provisioned to selected Installations through access points\n\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\f\f        After each voting member of the Source Selection Committee scored the proposals, the\nCommittee would meet for discussion, with the goal of coming to a consensus on the evaluations\nand preparing a written report to summarize the results and rank the proposals. AR 7935, 7942-\n43. The report was to discuss the basis for the Source Selection Committee’s ranking in\nsufficient detail to support the Committee’s recommendation. AR 7935, 7943. Exchange\nOperating Procedure 65-13 provided that the Source Selection Committee report would\n“summarize[] the strengths, weaknesses, and risks of each proposal.” AR 7935. All original\nindividual scoring sheets were required to be attached to the report. AR 7943.\n\n        In addition to a technical evaluation, the solicitation stated that AAFES would review the\nofferors’ fee proposals for the projected financial benefit to AAFES, and explained that “[a]s the\ntechnical rankings [became] closer, the Fees to AAFES [would] become more important.” AR\n453, 455. Under the solicitation, the fees for internet, voice, and video services were to be\nweighted as follows:\n\n           a. Initial Contract Ordering Period Fees          - will be multiplied by 2\n           b. Contract Option Periods 1-5 Fees               - will be multiplied by 1\n\nAR 455. For purposes of evaluation, the voice and video services fees would not be combined\nwith internet service fees. Id. The purpose behind these weights was “to ensure that AAFES . . .\nreceived a balanced proposal and obtained a reasonable fee proposal for ‘firm’ periods (years 1-\n5) versus the uncertain Contract Option Periods.” AR 1512 (emphasis in original). Each offeror\nwas to submit a single fee percentage for each military installation and each service being\nproposed within a geographic group, accounting for every installation within the geographic\nlocation being proposed. AR 458. As part of these fee proposals, offerors were required to\nprovide pro forma Operating Statements, containing projections for internet service in each\ngeographic group being proposed. Id.\n\n        Offerors were also required to submit past performance references. AR 456, 458. The\nsolicitation required each offeror to “provide descriptions of three (3) to five (5) operations in\nuse during the past five (5) years of similar type and size of the project, as described within this\nsolicitation.” AR 458.\n\n         On June 14, 2010, AAFES amended the solicitation by, inter alia, adding an internet\nservices pro forma Operating Statement form and delineating the type of information to be\nincluded in that Statement. AR 882, 908 (Tab 12). Offerors were required to provide financial\ninformation in eight categories: investment outlays, sales, gross operating income, operating\nexpenses, total operating expenses, operating earnings before interest and taxes, pre-tax income,\nand net income. AR 908 (Tab 12). The pro forma Operating Statements were to cover only the\nfirst five-year contract period, even though offerors were required to provide fee data for a 10-\nyear period, and were to be evaluated based on a 10-year period. Id.; see AR 407. The\nAmendment also extended the due date for the submission of proposals until June 23, 2010. AR\n882 (Tab 12).\n\n\n\n\n                                                10\n\fCCS’ Pre-Proposal Communications with AAFES\n\n         In March 2010, CCS emailed AAFES objecting to build-out activities at Fort Bliss, a\nlocation where CCS was providing services under its bridge contract, claiming ARMP’s\nactivities violated 10 U.S.C. § 2492a. AR 2515-16; see AR 279, 1887. This statute prohibited\nDoD entities from offering or providing Personal Information Services to consumers using DoD\nresources, personnel, or equipment or competing to provide Personal Information Services for a\nfee. CCS stated:\n\n       [W]e are becoming increasingly concerned that ARMP has every intention of not\n       only staying in the WIFI business, but monopolizing it per their previous effort, in\n       what appears to be blatant disregard of [C]ongress’ wishes.\n\n       We had previously informed you that we would take Fort Bliss and give\n       consideration to the ARMP “services” where [it] had deployed infrastructure. We\n       presumed, based on our conversations, that [ARMP] would not continue to invest\n       tax dollars in adding infrastructure since we are willing to provide the internet\n       services[.]\n\n       However, [ARMP] continue[s] to add or attempt to add to [its] network . . .\n       despite our stated willingness and ability to provide service.\n\nId.\n\n       AAFES replied:\n\n       We are not privy to all of [ARMP’s] plans and negotiations between you as it\n       relates to the optional infrastructure use. However, we are aware and do\n       understand ARMP has a command commitment to complete build-out work at\n       Bliss--and other locations--and that you both were in discussions on how that\n       could be accomplished at Bliss.\n\n       The legislative guidance is clear on how [Personal Information] services will be\n       provided and FMWRC has made a commitment to that.\n\nAR 2515. In a response sent to both AAFES and FMWRC, CCS stated: “All due respect to\nARMP and [its] ‘commitments.’ The Congress and the Law is clear. What part of this is not\nunderstandable? Congress . . . has said stop doing this and it is continuing.” AR 2514; see AR\n107, 279, 8150.\n\n       In May 2010, CCS submitted questions to the contracting officer regarding ARMP’s\nplanned role in the procurement. AR 2943. CCS stated:\n\n       [ARMP’s] role is a little confusing and the scope of [its] support is not clear. Will\n       [it] only be able to provide support services where [it has] deployed [Personal\n       Information Services] already? Will [it] be able to provide those services where [it\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\f       deploys FMWRC Information Services] going forward (over [its FMWRC\n       Information Services] network)? Is there any certainty around where and on what\n       time schedule [it] will be able to provide services going forward? If [ARMP’s]\n       business model is to receive a percentage of revenue, in exchange for providing\n       infrastructure and capital investment, [is ARMP] in a position to deploy “risk”\n       capital for the winning bidder(s)?\n\nId. The contracting officer responded:\n\n       a) ARMP is not limited to deploy [Personal Information Services] to provide\n       support. The deployment of ARMP’s official service support network [FMWRC\n       Information Services] is independent from the for fee services that AAFES will\n       offer.\n\n       b) ARMP would need to confirm [its] capability outside the Army sphere and\n       [FMWRC Information Systems] network. As the [FMWRC Information\n       Services] network expands, the capability to support providers will also expand;\n       although, separate agreements and [service-level agreements] are required with\n       ARMP to consider future expansion.\n\n       c) This will be handled on a case by case basis directly with ARMP and included\n       in the [service-level agreement]. It is [AAFES’] understanding that ARMP will\n       work collaboratively with the vendors.\n\n       d) This will be handled on a case by case basis directly negotiated with ARMP.\n       Under the ARMP proposal, [its] risk is the same as the vendor[’s], since the\n       reimbursement to ARMP is based upon revenue and there is a fixed cost for\n       ARMP to install and maintain the network.\n\nId.\n\nOfferors’ Knowledge of the Implementing Instructions\n\n        On February 4, 2010, Resolute’s Vice President of Marketing, Paul Guertin, found the\nPersonal Information Services Implementing Instructions “during [a] web-based search,” and\nforwarded them to other Resolute executives. Guertin Decl. ¶¶ 3, 4. The Implementing\nInstructions focused on the newly formed partnership between AAFES and FMWRC and its\neffort to create an integrated strategy to manage Personal Information Services. Id. at Ex. B\n(Version 3.6, Jan. 21, 2010 Implementing Instructions); see also AR 333-34 (Version 3.9, May\n10, 2010 Implementing Instructions). The annexes to the Jan. 21, 2010 Implementing\nInstructions Mr. Guertin located online included: (1) the 2009 February MOU between AAFES\nand FMWRC on Personal Information Services, (2) an explanation of the roles and\nresponsibilities of FMWRC-appointed telecommunications operations manager and FMWRC-\nassigned business manager and contracting officer, and (3) a sample statement of work for\nPersonal Information Services. Guertin Decl. 21-32. The annexes to the May 10, 2010 version\nof the Implementing Instructions also included the 2009 December MOA between FMWRC and\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\fAAFES and the April 6, 2010 memorandum from the Army’s Assistant Chief of Staff for\nInstallation Management to all Army bases regarding Personal Information Services. AR 358-\n63. On March 3, 2010, Mr. Guertin again accessed the Implementing Instructions and forwarded\nthem to two Resolute executives. Guertin Decl. ¶ 5.\n\n       Mr. Evard, Executive Vice President of CCS, testified in a declaration that CCS did not\nobtain the Implementing Instructions prior to June 18, 2010, and that he personally became\naware of the Implementing Instructions on October 14, 2010, after proposals were submitted,\n“while performing research on a matter unrelated to this litigation.” Third Evard Decl. ¶¶ 5(1),\n(3). Mr. Evard “did not review the document in detail, and did not review the Annexes at all,\nuntil mid-December when [CCS was] preparing the Complaint in this action.” Id.\n\nThe Proposals\n\n        AAFES received six proposals. AR 1501. 5 CCS proposed to use ARMP for some of its\nexisting infrastructure needs, stating it had “plans and the necessary partnerships, including\nARMP, in place to roll services out to all locations by June 30, 2011.” AR 713 (Tab 13)\n(emphasis omitted). The proposal indicated that CCS would self-deploy many of the networks\nand infrastructure but that ARMP would be a “deployment partner” at 18 mandatory bases. AR\n830-834 (Tab 13). In its proposal, CCS stated it chose to limit ARMP’s role because of concerns\nover the availability of ARMP’s infrastructure. AR 804 (Tab 13).\n\n       CCS proposed a [ * * * ] AAFES commission for internet services at four of the five\ngeographic locations -- except for the Alaska region. AR 843-49 (Tab 13). According to CCS’\npro forma Operating Statements, CCS projected [ * * * * * ] in combined internet sales from the\nWestern, Hawaii, Central, and Eastern regions, giving AAFES an estimated commission of [ * *\n* * * * ] for the five-year period. AR 857 (Tab 13); see AR 858-63 (Tab 13). CCS’ pro forma\nOperating Statements did not provide its estimated penetration rate, i.e., the estimated percentage\nof the base population that would pay for hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly internet service\nplans. AR 857 (Tab 13); see AR 858-63 (Tab 13).\n\n        Resolute also submitted a timely proposal for all geographic regions. See AR 464-709\n(Tab 14). Resolute divided the mandatory military bases into three groups: Group A -- locations\nwith an existing and operational ARMP network without a service provider, Group B -- locations\nwith an existing but nonoperational ARMP infrastructure without a service provider, and Group\nC -- locations with an existing provider with contracts expiring in 2011. AR 535-42 (Tab 14).\nFor Group A locations, Resolute proposed partnering with ARMP to transition existing services\nto Resolute. AR 535 (Tab 14). At Group B locations, Resolute planned to partner with ARMP\nto make services operational on ARMP’s existing infrastructure. AR 538 (Tab 14). For Group C\nlocations, Resolute would partner with ARMP when available. AR 540-42 (Tab 14). Resolute\ndid not expressly reference a “subcontract” with ARMP, but called its relationship with ARMP a\n\n\n\n\n       5\n         The record only contains the proposals of Resolute, CCS, and NetNearU. AR 464-881\n(Tabs 13-14), 909-1010 (Tab 15).\n\n\n                                                13\n\fpartnership and referred to ARMP as its “preferred vendor.” AR 466-67, 535, 538, 540, 619,\n662, 664 (Tab 14).\n\n        Regarding fees, Resolute assumed an average monthly penetration rate of [ * * * * ] in\n2011 on fully built-out mandatory bases, but applied a [ * ] discount to its estimated penetration\nrates to account for competition from existing franchises (in locations with provider contracts\nexpiring in 2011). AR 686-87 (Tab 14); see AR 540-42 (Tab 14). Resolute’s pro forma\nOperating Statements reflected [ * * * * * ] commission [ * * * * ] for AAFES, an [ * * * * * * *\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ]. AR 687 (Tab 14). Resolute projected\ninternet sales of [ * * * * * * ] for all geographic regions [ * * * * * * * * * * * ]. AR 688 (Tab\n14). This translated into commissions [ * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ]. AR 688-89 (Tab 14); see AR 687 (Tab 14).\n\nThe Technical Evaluation\n\n        The Source Selection Committee was comprised of five voting individuals, and each\nmember used individual score sheets when conducting the technical evaluations. AR 1248-1499,\n1519; see 7935, 7141. While all voting members of the Committee provided comments\njustifying their scores, not all used the prescribed comment codes -- significant strength, strength,\nsignificant weakness, weakness, clarification, and risk. AR 1248-1499. For example, when\nscoring CCS for past performance, one evaluator wrote: “10+ years in internet business, worked\n[with] [ * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ], has\nexperience working on a military base.” AR 1271. Individual evaluation scores were then\nmodified based on the Source Selection Committee’s consensus discussion. AR 1248-1499.\nThese modifications were made either directly on score sheets, or were reflected as differences\nbetween the numerical scores listed on individual score sheets and the final Source Selection\nCommittee Spreadsheet reflecting the consensus numbers. See, e.g., AR 1270-73 (an evaluation\nteam member’s score sheets for CCS, noting changes in factor scores made after the discussion);\nAR 1328-33 (an evaluation team member’s score sheets for CCS highlighting several large point\nincreases from the original scores).\n\n        Below is a summary of the changes between the initial individual scores and the Source\nSelection Committee consensus scores for CCS’ and Resolute’s proposals for internet services:\n\n                     Individual Source Selection Committee Member Scores for CCS\n\n                          Individual Scores Pre

AR 687, 709.1 (Tab 14).\n\n       The contracting officer, with assistance from AAFES financial technical expert, Otis\nWright, prepared the Fee Evaluation Report. AR 1512; see 107, 1500. The projected benefit\nfrom CCS’ and Resolute’s price proposals was calculated using the following equation:\n\n       Base Population x Price x Fee x Penetration Rate = Projected Income to AAFES\n\nAR 1512. While this equation was not shared with offerors, the solicitation included the base\npopulation for each mandatory military base. AR 410-16; see First Jackson Decl. ¶ 97. The total\nbase population for all groups except Alaska was 365,822. AR 410-16. Including Alaska, the\ntotal base population was 390,274. Id.\n\n        The penetration rate represented the estimated percentage of the base population that\nwould pay for hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly internet service plans. AR 5876, 5879.\nAAFES’ independent consultant, Deloitte LLP, calculated standard penetration rates for these\nservices based on FMWRC’s historical usage rates in the Continental United States. Id. The\nrates used were 1.8% for pre-paid hourly service, 1.1% for pre-paid daily service, 0.8% for pre-\npaid weekly service, and 2.9% for pre-paid monthly service. AR 5879. AAFES’ stated purpose\nin using these penetration rates was to create a “level playing field,” as these rates were\nuniformly applied to all proposals. AR 5880.\n\n       For contract years one through five, CCS and Resolute were evaluated as follows:\n\n                Resolute:     [ * * * * * * * ] estimated total income to AAFES\n                              (or [ * * * * * * * * ] per year)\n\n                CCS:          [ * * * * * * * ] estimated total income to AAFES\n                              (or [ * * * * * * * * ] per year)\n\nAR 1517. With Alaska factored out to create an even comparison, Resolute would have\nprovided to AAFES an estimated [ * * * * * * * * ] for contract years one through five, or\n[ * * * * * * ] annually. Id.\n\n        Overall, the contracting officer found that Resolute offered the “[m]ost attractive Internet\nfee proposal for all regions.” AR 1514. Resolute provided the highest fee percentage per region\nfor all contract years, as well as the highest projected income to AAFES per region for the full\n10-year period. Id. CCS’ fee proposal was ranked [ * * * * * * * * * ] for all regions excluding\nAlaska. Id. Assuming performance for the entire 10-year period and weighting the first five\nyears twice as heavily as the last five, the contracting officer determined that CCS would provide\n[ * * * * * * * ] in fees to AAFES, whereas Resolute would provide [ * * * * * * ] in fees to\nAAFES factoring out Alaska.

AR 1550-55. The Source\nSelection Authority determined that Resolute offered the “best overall value for AAFES across\nall regions . . . .” AR 1555. The award determination was contingent upon the contracting\nofficer’s pending responsibility determination. AR 1555. The Source Selection Authority\nacknowledged a concern over Resolute’s indebtedness to AAFES, but noted that Resolute was\nmaking monthly payments to cure deficiencies. AR 1552. As of February 17, 2010, Resolute\nowed AAFES [ * * * * * * ] in outstanding fee payments and late charges for sales from October\nto December 2009. AR 10529.

In fact, their performance\n       will only be enhanced with the awarding of this RFP.\n\nAR 8540 (emphasis omitted).\n\n       Mr. Wright recommended that AAFES proceed with an award to Resolute based on\nseveral factors. AR 1220. First, he found Resolute would see an increase in sales due to the\n\n\n\n                                                 22\n\faward of the contract. Id. He noted that in 2009, Resolute had [ * * * * * ] in sales, considering\nthe sales from Resolute’s current locations and projected sales from locations in Resolute’s offer.\nAR 1220, 1223. He estimated sales for each year of the initial five-year contract period as\n[ * * * * * * ] for 2011, [ * * * * * * ] for 2012, [ * * * * * * ] for 2013, [ * * * * * * ] for 2014,\nand [ * * * * * * ] for 2015. AR 1223. Mr. Wright’s forecast indicated that once Resolute began\nfull operation under the contract, its net income would increase by [ * * * ] between 2011 and\n2012, and estimated that Resolute could be debt free by 2014. AR 1220.\n\n       Second, Mr. Wright remarked that AAFES’ fee commission payments could be booked\nas “Cost of Sales,” such that the payment would be paid against revenue before other operating\nexpenses were paid. Id.\n\n        Third, Mr. Wright considered Resolute’s “Book Value,” and calculated that an award to\nResolute would improve its net present value from [ * * * * * * ] in 2010, to [ * * * * * * ]\nthrough 2015, because of its ability to generate sales and net income. AR 1221. Mr. Wright\nfound that the rate of return from Resolute’s operation under the contract would exceed its cost\nof capital, thereby increasing its net present value, and that Resolute’s strengthened financial\nposition would attract additional capital. Id.\n\n       Fourth, Mr. Wright considered that Resolute would “need [ * * * * * * * ] over the first\ntwo years of the contract period for continuing operations and contract execution,” and that it\nwas likely that [ * * * * * * ] would “provide as much funding as needed to execute the contract\nrequirements,” given the bank’s vested interest in Resolute’s continued success. AR 1221-22.\nMr. Wright noted that Resolute had previously raised [ * * * * * * ] and estimated that by 2014,\nfunds internally generated would be [ * * * * * ], exceeding the projected funding needs. AR\n1222.\n\nThe Responsibility Determination\n\n        On November 8, 2010, the contracting officer completed her Determination of\nResponsibility. AR 1753-59. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”) does not apply to\nAAFES. AR 381. According to governing AAFES policy, Exchange Service Purchasing\nPolicies (ESR Policy) 65-1, a responsible prospective contractor must meet seven minimum\nstandards. AR 8020 (ESR Policy 65-1 ¶ 4-46(c)). At issue in this case are two standards -- that\na prospective contractor must (1) have adequate financial resources, or the ability to obtain such\nresources, as required during performance, and (2) have a record of satisfactory performance “or\nbe able to document beyond reasonable doubt that any prior problems that created a marginal or\nunsatisfactory situation have been eliminated.” Id. 9\n\n\n\n\n       9\n          These AAFES standards are similar to FAR requirements. The first standard parallels\nFAR 9.104-1(a) (requiring that the offeror “[h]ave adequate financial resources to perform the\ncontract, or the ability to obtain them”) and the second is similar to 9.104-1(c) (requiring that the\nofferor “[h]ave a satisfactory performance record”).\n\n\n                                                  23\n\fFinancial Resources\n\n       In analyzing the adequacy of Resolute’s financial resources, “or [the] ability to obtain\nsuch resources, as required during performance of the contract,” the contracting officer noted in\nher Determination of Responsibility:\n\n       1.      A clear history;\n       2.      Secured financing;\n       3.      No serious red flags of financial risk of non-payment; and\n       4.      [Dun & Bradstreet] payment performance history:\n               a. 12-Month [Dun & Bradstreet] PAYDEX Score averages 70 which\n                  mean payment to suppliers average 15 days beyond terms;\n               b. [3-Month Dun & Bradstreet] PAYDEX Score averages 76 which mean\n                  payments to suppliers average 6 days beyond terms; and\n               c. A credit appraisal rating of [“3=Fair.”] These ratings indicate timely\n                  payments that average 15 days beyond terms.\n\nAR 1754-55.\n\n        With respect to bank references, the contracting officer found that Resolute’s overall\nbank and credit rating were considered satisfactory. AR 1755. [ * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n****************************************************\n****************************************************\n****************************************************\n****************************************************\n****************************************************\n****************************************************\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ]. Id.\n\n        With respect to Resolute’s financial projections, the contracting officer, relying on Mr.\nWright’s analysis, determined that Resolute had suffered declining revenues in 2010, but that the\naward of this contract would significantly improve Resolute’s financial outlook. AR 1754-56.\nThe contracting officer accepted Mr. Wright’s Book Value analysis and his finding that the\nintegration of revenue from the contract award would allow Resolute to achieve a net present\nvalue of [ * * * * * * ] based on projections through the 2015 calendar year. AR 1756.\n\nPast Performance\n\n        As part of Resolute’s responsibility determination, the contracting officer identified two\npast performance issues with Resolute’s 2005 contract with AAFES to provide internet café and\nother internet access at various locations in Kuwait, Germany, and the Continental United States.\nAR 1757. The first was a warning letter from AAFES for a service disruption dated October 16,\n2009, at a European military base. AR 1757, 8497-98. The contracting officer stated: “The\nissue was resolved in a timely manner by the contractor and service was restored the same day.”\nAR 1757. The second issue was “a cure demand,” issued by AAFES on January 13, 2010, for\nthe nonpayment of $199,740 in fees under the 2005 contract. AR 1757-58. The contracting\n\n\n\n                                               24\n\fofficer found that Resolute was taking corrective action to cure this debt. AR 1758. AAFES and\nResolute entered into a debt repayment plan for 12 monthly payments of [ * * * ] effective June\n1, 2010, so that by the time of the responsibility determination on November 8, 2010, the\noutstanding debt had been reduced from $[ * * * ] to $[ * * * ]. Id. In spite of this debt to\nAAFES, Resolute’s 2005 contract had been extended for an additional year for all Continental\nUnited States locations, and for three years for all locations outside the Continental United\nStates. Id. The contracting officer stated, “To date, [Resolute] continues to provide satisfactory\nperformance and submit payments by the required due date.” Id. Ultimately, on November 8,\n2010, the contracting officer determined that Resolute was responsible and the Source Selection\nAuthority concurred with this determination. AR 1759.\n\nThe Notice of Award and Debriefing\n\n         On November 9, 2010, AAFES notified CCS of the award to Resolute, and conducted\nCCS’ oral debriefing on December 1, 2010. AR 1760; see AR 1762. During the debriefing,\nAAFES indicated that FMWRC had been represented on the Source Selection Committee and\nthat its “personnel [had] participated with AAFES in developing the requirements for this Best-\nValue effort,” and that while ARMP was not represented on the Source Selection Committee,\n“ARMP personnel [had] participated with AAFES in developing the requirements for this Best-\nValue effort.” AR 1774. AAFES also notified CCS that the pro forma Operating Statements\nwere used as part of the financial analysis to assist in the technical and fee evaluations. AR\n1775.\n\n                                             Discussion\n\nJurisdiction and Standing\n\n        This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1491(a) which empowers the Court “to render judgment upon any claim against the United\nStates founded . . . upon any express or implied contract with the United States. . . .” The Act\ncontinues: “For the purposes of this paragraph, an express or implied contract with the Army\nand Air Force Exchange Service . . . shall be considered an express or implied contract with the\nUnited States.” 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a) (2006). “This jurisdictional grant extends to suits brought\nby disappointed bidders . . . challenging the proposed award of contracts based on alleged\nimproprieties in the procurement process.” Cent. Ark. Maint., Inc. v. United States, 68 F.3d\n1338, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (citing CACI, Inc.-Fed. v. United States, 719 F.2d 1567, 1572-73\n(Fed. Cir. 1983)). “Jurisdiction in these cases arises from an alleged breach of ‘an implied\ncontract to have the involved bids fairly and honestly considered.’” Id. (quoting United States v.\nJohn C. Grimberg, Co., 702 F.2d 1362, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (en banc)). The government\nbreaches this implied contract if its consideration of offers is found to be arbitrary, capricious, or\notherwise not in accordance with law. Id.\n\n       In 1996, Congress enacted the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act (“ADRA”), which\nprovides for judicial resolution of all bid protests in a single court, the Court of Federal Claims,\nunder the standard of review enunciated in the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”). Pub. L.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 25\n\fNo. 104-320, 110 Stat. 3870 (codified as amended at 28 U.S.C. § 1491(b) (2000)). Under these\nAPA standards, the Court shall:\n\n       (2) hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to\n       be—\n               (A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in\n               accordance with law;\n               (B) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity;\n               (C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of\n               statutory right;\n               (D) without observance of procedure required by law;\n\n                                                   ***\n\n       In making the foregoing determinations, the court shall review the whole record\n       or those parts of it cited by a party, and due account shall be taken of the rule of\n       prejudicial error.\n\n5 U.S.C. § 706 (2006).\n\n        ADRA grants this Court exclusive jurisdiction over any “action by an interested party\nobjecting to a solicitation by a Federal agency for bids or proposals for a proposed contract or to\na proposed award or the award of a contract or any alleged violation of statute or regulation in\nconnection with a procurement or a proposed procurement.” 28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(1) (2006)\n(emphasis added). Because AAFES, the entity that conducted this procurement, is not a federal\nagency, jurisdiction is not granted under § 1491(b). However, the Tucker Act bestows\njurisdiction over any claim founded upon any implied-in-fact contract with AAFES; ADRA did\nnot diminish the jurisdictional grant in § 1491(a). Res. Conservation Grp., LLC v. United States,\n597 F.3d 1238, 1245-46 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (holding that implied-in-fact contract jurisdiction under\n28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1) remains viable for protests where 28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(1) does not\nprovide a remedy); see also L-3 Commc’ns Integrated Sys., L.P. v. United States, 94 Fed. Cl.\n394, 396-97 (2010); FAS Support Servs., LLC v. United States, 93 Fed. Cl. 687, 694 (2010).\n\n       CCS has standing as a disappointed bidder because it submitted a proposal.\n\nIs a Protest Under § 1491(1)(a) Properly Resolved Under Motions for Judgment on the AR\nor Motions for Summary Judgment?\n\n       As a threshold matter, the parties disagree on the procedural mechanism for resolving this\n§ 1491(a) protest. Plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment, while Defendant and\nIntervenor filed motions for Judgment on the Administrative Record. 10 CCS points out that no\n\n\n\n       10\n          Defendant and Intervenor also filed motions to dismiss claiming that CCS lacked the\nfinancial ability to perform the contract and thus lacked standing as an interested party. The\nrecord indicates that CCS has standing. See AR 1521 (Source Selection Committee Report\n\n\n                                                 26\n\frule requires that all bid protests, including those brought under 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a), be resolved\non motions for judgment on the AR. Pl.’s Supplemental Br. 3. Defendant and Resolute contend\nthat the case is appropriately resolved via motions for judgment on the administrative record\nbecause bid protests brought under Section 1491(a) -- while predicated on breach of the implied\nduty of fair dealing -- are not a different species of protest than those brought under § 1491(b)\nand therefore should not require a different process. The Federal Circuit has not yet addressed\nthis procedural issue. See Creation Upgrades, Inc. v. United States, 417 F. App’x 957, 959 (Fed.\nCir. 2011) (“Since our decision in Resource Conservation, we have not decided whether bid\nprotest cases brought under § 1491(a)(1) of the Tucker Act are to be decided on the\nadministrative record, and we see no need to decide that question in this case.”).\n\n       Plaintiff’s chosen procedure, summary judgment, is a “short cut” to resolving a case by\neliminating the need for fact-finding and trial. In ruling on summary judgment motions, the\nCourt does not make findings of fact. Rather, the Court assesses whether any material facts are\ngenuinely in dispute and, if they are not, resolves solely questions of law. If there are genuine\nissues of material fact, the Court must deny motions for summary judgment, and the parties\nproceed to trial.\n\n       In contrast, under the regime of motions for judgment on the AR, governed by Rule 52.1,\nthe Court makes findings of fact based upon the administrative record. As the Federal Circuit\nexplained in Bannum, Inc. v. United States, the trial court must make factual findings “from the\nrecord evidence as if it were conducting a trial on the record.” 404 F.3d 1355, 1357 (Fed. Cir.\n2005). Then, the Court must determine if the agency’s conduct violated the law. Id. In adding\nRule 52.1 in 2006, this Court expressly acknowledged that “[s]ummary judgment standards are\nnot pertinent to judicial review upon an administrative record.” RCFC 52.1, Rules Committee\nNotes, 2006 Adoption (citing Bannum, 404 F.3d at 1355-57).\n\n        Despite the different procedural mechanisms, the standard of review for resolving bid\nprotests is substantially the same whether the protest is brought under § 1491(a) as a breach of an\nimplied contract or as a traditional bid protest under § 1491(b). In § 1491(a) protests, the Court\nreviews whether the agency’s conduct was arbitrary and capricious. See Keco Indus., Inc. v.\nUnited States, 192 Ct. Cl. 773, 783-84 (1970) (“[A]rbitrary and capricious action on the part of\nthe Government . . . clearly is a violation of the rule laid down in [Heyer Products Co. v. United\nStates, 135 Ct. Cl. 63 (1956)] that bids should be fairly and honestly considered.”); Wetsel-\nOviatt Lumber Co. v. United States, 40 Fed. Cl. 557, 565 (1998) (“An invitation for bids . . .\ncarries an implied contractual obligation to fairly and honestly consider all responsive bids. The\ngovernment breaches this implied contract if its consideration of the bids is found to be arbitrary,\n\n\n\nfinding CCS’ proposal “to be a very viable solution” and identifying CCS as financially strong,\nwith a strong product offering, substantial experience, and aggressive monitoring of the\nnetwork); Ala. Aircraft Indust., Inc.-Birmingham v. United States, 83 Fed. Cl. 666, 685 (2008)\n(stating that “DCAA’s audit report, combined with payments of Alabama Aircraft expects to\nearn on the KC–135 PDM contract, strongly support the conclusion that if awarded the contract,\nAlabama Aircraft would have sufficient financial resources . . . .”), rev’d on other grounds, 586\nF.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2009).\n\n\n                                                27\n\fcapricious, without rational basis, or an abuse of discretion.” (citations omitted)); see also\nPrineville Sawmill Co. v. United States, 859 F.2d 905, 909 (Fed. Cir. 1988); Southfork Sys., Inc.\nv. United States, 141 F.3d 1124, 1132 (Fed. Cir. 1988); Keco Indus., Inc. v. United States, 203\nCt. Cl. 566, 574 (1974)); L-3 Commc’ns, 94 Fed. Cl. at 397 n.3; FAS Support Servs., 93 Fed. Cl.\nat 694. Under 28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(4), the Court employs the standards set forth in the APA, 5\nU.S.C. § 706, which requires the Court to set aside agency action found to be “arbitrary,\ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”\n\n        In the instant case, a determination of whether the agency’s conduct was arbitrary and\ncapricious can be readily made utilizing the AR. Defendant has filed an ample administrative\nrecord, and Plaintiff has invoked that record, seeking to add declarations from its executive vice\npresident and consultant. In short, all parties rely on facts in the AR in support of their requests\nfor judgment with very limited supplementation. As such, the Court treats Plaintiff’s motion for\nsummary judgment as a motion for judgment on the AR.\n\nThe Scope of the Record and Defendant’s Motion to Strike\n\n       CCS seeks to support its protest with five declarations, three from Timothy Evard,\nExecutive Vice President of CCS, and two from Jimmy J. Jackson, a consultant, and the\nGovernment moves to strike all these declarations. In resolving cross-motions for judgment on\nthe AR, the Court must assess whether CCS has justified its request to supplement the AR.\nAxiom Res. Mgmt., Inc. v. United States, 564 F.3d. 1374, 1378-80 (Fed. Cir. 2009).\n\n       Mr. Evard’s Declarations\n\n        Mr. Evard’s first declaration, filed with CCS’ complaint, addresses: (1) CCS’ past\nperformance in providing information services, (2) the content of the RFP, (3) the content of\nCCS’ proposal, and (4) the substance of meetings not otherwise described in the record. Evard\nDecl. 1-8, Dec. 22, 2010. CCS filed the second Evard Declaration in response to the\nGovernment’s argument that CCS waived its claims that AAFES violated 10 U.S.C. § 2492(a)\nand that ARMP’s and FMWRC’s involvement in this procurement created improper conflicts of\ninterest. In this second declaration, Mr. Evard described CCS’ understanding of ARMP’s role\nand network build-out plans at the time it submitted its proposal. Evard Decl. 1-8, Aug. 22, 2011\n(“Second Evard Decl.”).\n\n       Mr. Evard filed a third declaration in response to a Court order asking the parties whether\nthe Implementing Instructions were available to offerors prior to June 18, 2010, where that\ninformation was made available, and whether CCS had knowledge of this information. 11 Mr.\nEvard answered that this information was not available before June 18, 2010, that he was not\naware when or where it was made available, and that CCS did not have knowledge of this\ninformation before June 18, 2010.\n\n\n\n       11\n           In its response, Defendant stated that the Implementing Instructions were available to\nofferors prior to June 18, 2010, the information was made available online at a FMWRC web\naddress, and that CCS either knew or should have known the information.\n\n\n                                                28\n\f       To resolve the waiver issue, the Court must consider what CCS knew regarding ARMP’s\nrole and when CCS learned it -- matters not in the AR. As such, the Court supplements the\nrecord with the third Evard declaration. Further, the Court supplements the record with\ninformation on CCS’ knowledge of ARMP’s role in the procurement as reflected in Paragraphs\n12 and 13 of Mr. Evard’s first declaration (discussing CCS’ bridge contract and communications\nwith ARMP and AAFES concerning ARMP’s future role) and Paragraphs 1 through 11 of Mr.\nEvard’s second declaration (discussing CCS’ interpretation of the RFP, information presented at\nIndustry Day, and communications with ARMP and AAFES concerning ARMP’s future role).\nThe remainder of these two declarations either restates information in the solicitation and in\nResolute’s and CCS’ proposals or contains Mr. Evard’s personal opinion of Resolute’s proposal.\nMr. Evard’s opinion of Resolute’s proposal is not relevant, and his restatement of material in the\nrecord is unnecessary and duplicative. See Arcow Corp. of Am. v. United States, 96 Fed. Cl.\n270, 280 (2010) (excluding portions of a declaration because it merely detailed information\nalready contained in the record); cf. East West, Inc. v. United States, 100 Fed. Cl. 53, 57 (2011)\n(excluding declaration that provided “information concerning the reaction of plaintiff to certain\nagency communications”).\n\n       Mr. Jackson’s Declarations\n\n        Mr. Jackson is a consultant CCS retained to review AAFES’ responsibility\ndetermination. 12 In his first declaration, filed with CCS’ motion for summary judgment, Mr.\nJackson addresses the finance-related aspects of Mr. Wright’s reviews and the contracting\nofficer’s and the Source Selection Committee’s decisions. His second declaration, filed in\nsupport of CCS’ response to the Government’s motion for judgment on the AR, addresses\nResolute’s financial responsibility and AAFES’ calculation of the technical scores.\n\n       Mr. Jackson opines that:\n\n            •   Resolute did not have adequate financial resources and that “the contracting\n                officer should have concluded that Resolute was not financially responsible.”\n                Jackson Decl. ¶¶ 9, 10, July 18, 2011 (“First Jackson Decl.”); Jackson Decl. ¶¶ 9-\n                11, Aug. 22, 2011 (“Second Jackson Decl.”);\n\n            •   the assumptions in Mr. Wright’s financial models overstated Resolute’s ability to\n                obtain financing, omitted interest-related expenses, inflated Resolute’s sales and\n                revenues, and understated expenses, leading to an erroneous conclusion about\n                Resolute’s financial outlook. First Jackson Decl. ¶¶ 41-67; and\n\n\n\n\n       12\n           Mr. Jackson has evaluated financial and cost analyses in more than 185 bid protests\nand has been accepted as an expert by the Court of Federal Claims and Federal District Courts.\nFirst Jackson Decl. ¶¶ 4(d), 4(g). He has two masters degrees, one in Business Administration\nfrom Southern Illinois University and one in Science in Management from the Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management. Id. at ¶ 3(b)-(c).\n\n\n                                                29\n\f           •   the revenue comparison that the Source Selection Committee relied upon\n               improperly used a normalized penetration rate not disclosed to offerors instead of\n               evaluating the projected financial benefits associated with each offer. Id. at ¶¶ 90-\n               99.\n\n        Mr. Jackson also analyzes the scoring of the technical evaluation and conducts his own\ncomparative analysis of portions of CCS’ and Resolute’s proposals, assigning different subfactor\nscores. Second Jackson Decl. ¶¶ 3-4. In addition, Mr. Jackson questions the comparison of\nResolute’s and CCS’ proposals claiming AAFES failed to consider that CCS did not include\nAlaska in its proposal, and performs his own analysis acknowledging this circumstance. Id. at\n¶¶ 9-11. Finally, Mr. Jackson critiques the contracting officer’s past performance evaluation\nbecause the agency only used a three-point scale -- Strong, Modest, and Weak -- “without\nhaving a fourth possible score for Unacceptable,” a technique that in his view “masked the high\nrisk of Resolute’s financial performance.” First Jackson Decl. ¶¶ 85, 86.\n\n        As the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit recognized in Axiom\nResource Management, Inc. v. United States, the parties’ ability to supplement the AR in a bid\nprotest is limited, and the “focus of judicial review of agency action remains the administrative\nrecord, which should be supplemented only if the existing record is insufficient to permit\nmeaningful review . . . .” 564 F.3d at 1379-81. It is appropriate to supplement the AR when\n“technical aspects of the procurement process [would] remain unexplained” without\nsupplementation or “when necessary for the Court to understand technical or complex\ninformation involved in the challenged procurement.” Guzar Mirbachakot Transp. v. United\nStates, 104 Fed. Cl. 53, 63-64 (2012) (citations omitted) (supplementing the record with expert\ntestimony regarding electronic file compression and transmission utilities); Global Computer\nEnters., Inc. v. United States, 88 Fed. Cl. 52, 67 (2010) (finding declarations necessary to\nilluminate the difference between audit-supporting financial management system services and\nmission and administrative support IT services); see also Mike Hooks, Inc. v. United States, 39\nFed. Cl. 147, 158 (1997) (permitting supplementation to enable the Court to understand technical\nsolicitation language regarding minimum production rates for shoal dredging).\n\n        Consistent with these decisions, an expert in this case could have properly explained\ncomplex financial principles and offered an opinion on their impact and application. There is a\nfine line though between an expert offering technical analysis -- an acceptable addition to the\nrecord -- and an expert substituting his subjective judgment for that of the Government in areas\nnot dependent upon complex technical matters. In the instant case, Mr. Jackson crossed that line.\n\n        Mr. Jackson proffers his opinion on Resolute’s responsibility predicated on his subjective\nevaluation of the record, not on any inscrutable technical matters. See First Jackson Decl. ¶ 12\n(stating it was “irrational” for the contracting officer to find Resolute financially responsible\nwhen it was “cleared for less than[ * * ] percent of the contract amount”); ¶ 17 (claiming the\ncontracting officer should have found Resolute’s Dun & Bradstreet Report to have been based on\noutdated information); ¶ 25 (opining that Resolute’s financial statements support only an\nunfavorable financial responsibility determination); ¶¶ 26-40 (questioning the contracting\nofficer’s interpretation of letters and communications from [ * * * * * ], and speculating that\nResolute was in “default” on its loan); ¶ 72 (stating that Mr. Wright’s financial model provides\n\n\n\n                                                30\n\fno “rational basis” for a favorable responsibility determination). Mr. Jackson’s opinion does not\nprovide technical clarification necessary for effective judicial review. Cf. Allied Tech. Grp., Inc.\nv. United States, 92 Fed. Cl. 226, 231 (2010) (refusing to consider proffered declarations because\nthe AR was not too complex for the Court to review).\n\n        Similarly, Mr. Jackson’s critique of AAFES’ evaluations are inappropriate\nsupplementation. See First Jackson Decl. ¶ 85 (stating that AAFES’ evaluation criteria for risk\nscoring should have included an “unacceptable” score); see also Second Jackson Decl. ¶¶ 9-12\n(presenting how Mr. Jackson would have calculated the AAFES fee percentages). Expert\nopinions that purport to assess an agency’s procurement decisions are not proper\nsupplementation of the AR. In PlanetSpace Inc. v. United States, the Court rejected declarations\nproffered by the plaintiff because they essentially “attack[ed] the merits of [the agency’s] award\ndecision.” 90 Fed. Cl. 1, 6 (2009). Although the PlanetSpace plaintiff claimed that the\ndeclarations there were a technical aid to explain the pricing differences among proposals, the\nCourt found that the declarations re-argued the merits of the parties’ financing plans and\namounted to a “comparative assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposals . . . .”\nId. at 8. So too, Mr. Jackson questions the correctness of the contracting officer’s and Source\nSelection Committee’s conclusions. Whether or not the contracting officer and Source Selection\nCommittee and Source Selection Authority made “reasonable” decisions on these procurement\nmatters is a determination for this Court and is not a proper subject for expert opinion. Id.\n\n         In Al Ghanim Combined Group Company General Trading & Contracting W.L.L. v.\nUnited States, the Court excluded two declarations by Mr. Jackson in a bid protest. 56 Fed. Cl.\n502, 504 (2003). In challenging the pricing evaluation, Mr. Jackson opined that the agency had\nfailed to perform a “price realism analysis” that would have revealed that the awardee’s pricing\nwas unrealistic. Id. at 511. The Court excluded Mr. Jackson’s declarations because they did not\n“fill a gap in the record” or provide necessary clarification, stating:\n\n       Even if characterized as expert testimony, Mr. Jackson’s opinions do not aid the\n       court in its analysis of plaintiff’s arguments. Admissible expert testimony, as\n       governed by [FRE] 702, must assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or\n       to determine a fact in issue. Plaintiff’s arguments are devoid of complexities that\n       might require expert assistance, and plaintiff’s counsel is able to explain its\n       arguments fully without the need of expert testimony.\n\nId. at 512 (citations and quotation marks omitted). Here, as in Al Ghanim, because Mr. Jackson\nre-argues the merits of the Government’s award decision, his declarations are unnecessary for a\nfull and complete understanding of the issues in the protest.\n\nWaiver Under Blue & Gold in § 1491(a)(1) Protests\n\n        Defendant and Intervenor, relying on Blue & Gold Fleet, L.P. v. United States, 492 F.3d\n1308, 1315 (Fed. Cir. 2007), seek dismissal of Counts I and II on the ground that CCS knew the\nbasis for these claims prior to the conclusion of the bidding process, but did not raise them until\nafter award. In Count I, CCS claims that Defendant violated 10 U.S.C. § 2492a by allowing\nARMP to either (i) compete for a contract to provide Personal Information Services directly to\n\n\n\n                                                31\n\ffee-paying users, or (ii) itself provide Personal Information Services directly to fee-paying users.\nIn Count II, CCS claims that ARMP’s role as a subcontractor and FMWRC’s participation on the\nSource Selection Committee and its involvement, along with ARMP’s, in shaping the\nsolicitation, constituted organizational conflicts of interest.\n\n       Is the Blue & Gold Waiver Doctrine Limited to § 1491(b) Protests?\n\n        In Blue & Gold, the Federal Circuit held “that a party who has the opportunity to object\nto the terms of a government solicitation containing a patent error and fails to do so prior to the\nclose of the bidding process waives its ability to raise the same objection subsequently in a bid\nprotest action in the Court of Federal Claims.” Id. at 1313. CCS argues that as a matter of law,\nthe Blue & Gold waiver doctrine only applies to bid protests brought under 28 U.S.C. § 1491(b),\nnot to protests invoking § 1491(a) jurisdiction, emphasizing the following language in Blue &\nGold:\n\n       [A] party who has the opportunity to object to the terms of a government\n       solicitation containing a patent error and fails to do so prior to the close of the\n       bidding process waives its ability to raise the same objection afterwards in a\n       § 1491(b) action in the Court of Federal Claims.\n\n                                               ***\n\n       Having recognized a waiver rule in § 1491(b) bid protest actions, we must decide\n       whether the Court of Federal Claims erred in applying it to this case.\n\nId. at 1315 (emphasis added).\n\n        While Blue & Gold itself concerned a § 1491(b) bid protest, there is nothing in the\ndecision that limits the waiver rule to bid protests predicated on § 1491(b) jurisdiction. What\ndrives the waiver rule is the pragmatic recognition that a bidder must object to the terms of a\npatently erroneous solicitation while the Government can still remedy the situation. Id. at 1314-\n15. The patent ambiguity doctrine as articulated in Blue & Gold is equally applicable in any bid\nprotest whether brought under § 1491(a) or (b). As the Federal Circuit explained:\n\n       [The patent ambiguity] doctrine “was established to prevent contractors from\n       taking advantage of the government, protect other bidders by assuring that all\n       bidders bid on the same specifications, and materially aid the administration of\n       government contracts by requiring that ambiguities be raised before the contract is\n       bid, thus avoiding costly litigation after the fact.” These reasons . . . apply with\n       equal force in the bid protest context. In the absence of a waiver rule, a contractor\n       with knowledge of a solicitation defect could choose to stay silent when\n       submitting its first proposal. If its first proposal loses to another bidder, the\n       contractor could then come forward with the defect to restart the bidding process,\n       perhaps with increased knowledge of its competitors.\n\n\n\n\n                                                32\n\fId. at 1313-1314 (quoting Cmty. Heating & Plumbing Co. v. Kelso, 987 F.2d 1575, 1580 (Fed.\nCir. 1993)).\n\n        There is no reason to disavow the Blue & Gold waiver rule merely because jurisdiction is\npredicated on this Court’s general breach-of-contract jurisdiction instead of its more specific bid\nprotest jurisdiction. To hold otherwise would permit bidders in § 1491(a) protests to do exactly\nwhat the Blue & Gold Court prohibited -- to roll the dice and wait to protest if they do not win.\nAs the Federal Circuit explained:\n\n       It would be inefficient and costly to authorize this remedy after offerors and the\n       agency had expended considerable time and effort submitting or evaluating\n       proposals in response to a defective solicitation. Vendors cannot sit on their\n       rights to challenge what they believe is an unfair solicitation, roll the dice and see\n       if they receive award [sic] and then, if unsuccessful, claim the solicitation was\n       infirm.\n\nId. at 1314 (alteration in original) (quoting Argencord Mach. & Equip., Inc. v. United States, 68\nFed. Cl. 167, 175 n.14 (2005)).\n\n        The Federal Circuit recently reemphasized that the Blue & Gold waiver rule should be\nbroadly applied in bid protests in COMINT Systems Corporation v. United States, 700 F.3d 1377\n(Fed. Cir. 2012). There, the Court held that the plaintiff waived its right to challenge an\namendment to the solicitation by not protesting before contract award, even though the\namendment was issued after the close of the bidding process. The Federal Circuit expanded Blue\n& Gold by applying its reasoning “to all situations in which the protesting party had the\nopportunity to challenge a solicitation before the award and failed to do so.” COMINT, 700 F.3d\nat 1382. As such, the Federal Circuit extended the time a protestor may file a pre-award protest\nfrom the “close of the bidding process” as articulated in Blue & Gold to any time before award is\nmade. See also Bannum, Inc. v. United States, 115 Fed. Cl. 257, 274 (2014). The Federal\nCircuit recognized that “[t]he same policy underlying Blue & Gold supports it extension to all\npre-award situations.” COMINT, 700 F.3d at 1382.\n\n        CCS contends that the Blue & Gold waiver rule should not apply in § 1491(a) protests\nbecause the implied-in-fact contract giving rise to jurisdiction is not formed unless an offeror\nsubmits a proposal, the very act which causes the waiver under Blue & Gold. Thus, CCS posits\nthat a plaintiff challenging a solicitation under § 1491(a) would have the Hobson’s choice of\neither filing a protest prior to submitting a proposal, thus bypassing the requirement for\nestablishing § 1491(a) jurisdiction, or waiving its ability to protest by submitting a proposal.\nSuch a narrow and draconian view of the § 1491(a) bid protest process is unwarranted.\n\n        CCS’ perceived dilemma was apparently spawned by an overly broad reading of\nMotorola, Inc. v. United States, 988 F.2d 113 (Fed. Cir. 1993). CCS misconstrues Motorola to\nestablish a general principle that submission of a proposal is always required to establish the\nimplied-in-fact contract necessary for § 1491(a) pre-award protest jurisdiction. While the trial\ncourt in Motorola did articulate that principle, the Federal Circuit, using limiting language in its\naffirmance, did not adopt the trial court’s reasoning wholesale. The plaintiff in Motorola filed\n\n\n\n                                                33\n\fsuit challenging a solicitation as being unduly restrictive and precluding it from submitting a bid.\nThe Motorola plaintiff based its assertion of implied contract jurisdiction on the Government’s\nrequests for, and Motorola’s submission of, information to assist the Government in developing\nthe solicitation. Id. at 114-15. In dismissing Motorola’s complaint for failure to state a claim,\nthe trial court concluded that “[s]ince there was no bid here, there was no promise; hence, no\nbasis for finding the existence of a pre-award contract upon which a claim for injunctive relief\ncan be based.” Id. at 116. 13\n\n        In affirming Motorola, while agreeing that no implied contract arose because plaintiff had\nnot submitted a bid, the Federal Circuit added important qualifiers, stating that Motorola had\n“not otherwise met its burden to show that an implied in fact contract existed,” and that\n“[o]rdinarily a bid is required to establish that a pre-award implied in fact contract exists.” Id. at\n114 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). This language underscores the appellate court’s\nrecognition that the submission of a bid is not the sine qua non for establishing an implied-in-fact\ncontract and acknowledges alternatives for “otherwise” establishing the implied-in-fact contract\nnecessary for pre-award protest jurisdiction. Further, the Federal Circuit expressly limited its\nendorsement of the Motorola trial court’s opinion “to the extent consistent with the above”\nreasoning. Id.\n\n        The Federal Circuit’s refusal in Motorola to restrict the manner in which an implied-in-\nfact contract can be formed in the pre-award procurement process setting is consistent with\nfundamental principles of contract formation. As the Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 24\nteaches, “[a]n offer is the manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain, so made as to\njustify another person in understanding that his assent to that bargain is invited and will conclude\nit.” The Government’s manifestation of a willingness to enter a bargain and a vendor’s assent to\nthat bargain need not be exclusively expressed via a formal bid or proposal in the pre-award\ncontext.\n\n        But even if CCS were correct that it had to submit a proposal in order to form an implied-\nin-fact contract giving rise to this Court’s jurisdiction, it could still have preserved its rights.\nCCS could have protested the terms of the solicitation and in the alternative, timely submitted a\nproposal that purported to respond to the allegedly flawed solicitation. In sum, CCS’ effort to\ninsulate § 1491(a) protests from the Blue & Gold waiver rule fails.\n\n\n\n\n       13\n            In so holding, the Motorola trial court departed from the holdings in Standard\nManufacturing Company v. United States, 7 Cl. Ct. 54 (1984) and Magnavox Electronics\nSystems Company v. United States, 26 Cl. Ct. 1373 (1992). In Standard Manufacturing, the\ncourt held that a contractor’s response to government requests for information created an implied\ncontract that all responses would be fairly and honestly considered, satisfying the jurisdictional\nprerequisite for a pre-award bid protest under Section 1491(a). 7 Cl. Ct. at 58-60. Similarly, in\nMagnovox, notices of intent to conduct a sole-source procurement published in the Commerce\nBusiness Daily coupled with a contractor’s response that it could perform the work, resulted in\nan implied contract to give the contractor’s response honest and fair consideration. 26 Cl. Ct. at\n1377-78.\n\n\n                                                 34\n\fCCS Knew Its Grounds of Protest Prior to Award\n\n         As explained above, parties who have the opportunity to object to the terms of a\nsolicitation containing patent errors or ambiguities and fail to do in a timely fashion waive their\nability to subsequently raise the same objections. COMINT, 700 F.3d at 1382; Blue & Gold, 492\nF.3d at 1316; Bannum, 115 Fed. Cl. at 273-74.\n\n       CCS Waived Its Claim of a Statutory Violation\n\n       In Count I, CCS claims that the Government violated 10 U.S.C. § 2492a, which provides:\n       (a) Limitation.—(1) Notwithstanding section 2492 of this title, the Secretary of\n       Defense may not authorize a Department of Defense entity to offer or provide\n       personal information services directly to users using Department resources,\n       personnel, or equipment, or compete for contracts to provide such personal\n       information services directly to users, if users will be charged a fee for the\n       personal information services to recover the cost incurred to provide the services\n       or to earn a profit.\n\n       (2) The limitation in paragraph (1) shall not be construed to prohibit or preclude\n       the use of Department resources, personnel, or equipment to administer or\n       facilitate personal information services contracts with private contractors.\n\n10 U.S.C. § 2492a.\n\n        CCS alleges that ARMP was either competing for a contract to provide Personal\nInformation Services or providing these services directly to fee-paying users in violation of\n§ 2492a, by acting as a subcontractor and continuing to build out its own network. However, by\nwaiting to file its protest until after award, CCS waived this ground of protest. The solicitation\nclearly informed offerors that ARMP could be a subcontractor and lease its infrastructure to\nofferors reiterating identical communications conveyed to offerors in the draft solicitation and\nthe Industry Day presentation. In CCS’ case, there was also a pre-solicitation exchange with\nAAFES clarifying ARMP’s role.\n\n        The draft solicitation expressly informed prospective offerors that ARMP could be\nutilized as a subcontractor for “locations where ARMP [had] installed infrastructure,” and that\nofferors would have the “option of leasing the ARMP network and equipment . . . .” AR 119-20.\nFurther, the draft solicitation listed several advantages of utilizing ARMP’s network.\n\n      A few weeks later, the Industry Day briefing made clear that an offeror had the option to\nuse ARMP’s infrastructure in certain locations and to designate ARMP as its subcontractor. See\nAR 275-76. Industry Day attendees, including CCS representatives, were informed that ARMP\nwould provide a variety of services, including “Internet Gateway & LAN Services” and “Internet\nAccess Device leasing.” AR 275. Industry Day attendees also learned that ARMP would\n\n\n\n\n                                                35\n\fprovide these services in the Continental United States at “[m]ost major garrisons” with “[p]lans\nto reach all garrisons in coming years.” AR 276. 14\n\n       Just a few days after Industry Day, on May 3, 2010, CCS sent AAFES an email\nrequesting clarification of ARMP’s role, stating:\n\n       Subject: RFP comments\n       The ARMP role is a little confusing and the scope of [its] support is not clear.\n       Will [it] only be able to provide support services where [it has] deployed\n       [Personal Information Services] already? Will [it] be able to provide those\n       services where [it deploys FMWRC Information Services] going forward (over\n       [its FMWRC Information Services] network)? Is there any certainty around\n       where and on what time schedule [it] will be able to provide services going\n       forward?\n\nAR 2943. The contracting officer responded, stating:\n\n       a) ARMP is not limited to deploy [Personal Information Services] to provide\n       support. The deployment of ARMP’s official service support network [FMWRC\n       network] is independent from the for fee services that AAFES will offer.\n\n       b) ARMP would need to confirm [its] capability outside the Army sphere and\n       [FMWRC] network. As the [FMWRC] network expands, the capability to\n       support providers will also expand; although, separate agreements and [Service-\n       Level Agreements] are required with ARMP to consider future expansion.\n\nId.\n\n        CCS claims that this exchange did not advise it that ARMP could be used for future\nbuild-outs, and that the contracting officer’s answer was “vague” and “border[ed] on evasive.”\nPl.’s Reply & Opp’n 36-37, Aug. 22, 2011. According to CCS, it was not clear that ARMP’s\nsupport included providing infrastructure. Id. at 37. CCS’ interpretation is untenable. CCS\nasked: “Will [ARMP] only be able to provide support services where [it has] deployed [Personal\nInformation Services] already?” AR 2943 (emphasis added). The contracting officer said no,\nstating “ARMP is not limited to deploy [Personal Information Services] to provide support,” and\nadded that ARMP’s expanding FMWRC Information Services network could be utilized via\nseparate agreements. Id.\n\n        A few weeks after this clarification, the Government issued the solicitation, listing the\nbenefits of using ARMP as a subcontractor, and reiterating ARMP’s role and clarifying that the\n\n\n\n       14\n           Mr. Evard, CCS’ Executive Vice President, saw the slide “showing that ARMP had an\naggressive build-out plan,” but assumed that the information on the slide was out of date and\nreflected ARMP’s plans before the December MOA. Second Evard Decl. ¶ 10. CCS’ erroneous\nassumption does not change the fact that ARMP’s role was disclosed during Industry Day.\n\n\n                                               36\n\fARMP network would continue to expand. AR 366-67. In a paragraph titled “ARMP as a\nPotential Internet Sub-Contractor,” the solicitation stated that ARMP could provide both existing\nand “planned” infrastructure. AR 366-67. CCS claims that “planned” referred only to projects\nfor which construction was already under way, but there is no basis in the record for CCS’ gloss.\n\n        In sum, given the language in the draft and final solicitations, the Industry Day\npresentation, and CCS’ exchange with AAFES, CCS knew that ARMP had been providing and\nwould continue to provide network infrastructure and other support services as a subcontractor to\nthe successful offeror -- the predicate for its claim that the Government violated 10 U.S.C.\n§ 2492a. Even though it was aware of this alleged defect in the solicitation, CCS did not protest\nuntil after it failed to receive the award. As such, CCS waived its ability to protest this statutory\nviolation under Blue & Gold.\n\nThe Court Declines to Invoke a Statutory Violation Exception to the Waiver Doctrine\n\n        CCS argues that even if it waived its statutory claim, the Court should not apply Blue &\nGold because a significant statutory violation is at issue. Pl.’s Reply & Opp’n 43. CCS posits\nthat the Blue & Gold waiver rule originated in part from the Government Accountability Office’s\n(“GAO”) timeliness rule. This rule permits GAO to consider an untimely protest “for good\ncause shown, or where it determines that a protest raises issues significant to the procurement\nsystem . . . .” Id. at 44 (quoting 4 C.F.R. § 21.2(c)). As CCS recognizes, GAO’s exception to\nthe timeliness rule applies “only where the untimely issue directly concerns the interpretation or\napplication of the procurement statutes or regulations on a matter of widespread interest to the\nprocurement community.” Id. (citing 4 C.F.R. § 21.2(c) and quoting DePaul Hosp. & The\nCatholic Health Ass’n of the United States, B-227160, 87-2 CPD ¶ 173, 1987 WL 102790, at *4\n(Comp. Gen. Aug. 18, 1987) (citations omitted)).\n\n        CCS contends that this Court should adopt a similar exception because AAFES violated\nthe statute and contravened the legislative intent of prohibiting Government competition in the\ncommercial marketplace. Id. at 45. Even assuming arguendo that CCS is correct that AAFES\nviolated 10 U.S.C. § 2492a in this procurement, applying a statutory violation exception to the\nBlue & Gold waiver rule would not be appropriate. The Blue & Gold waiver rule as extended by\nCOMINT is simple: if there is a patent ambiguity or error in the solicitation, a plaintiff must\nseek redress in court prior to award. In fashioning and reaffirming this judicial waiver rule, the\nFederal Circuit did not adopt GAO’s rule or practice, it applied a judicial doctrine, the patent\nambiguity doctrine, and recognized that it was unfair and inefficient to allow protestors to game\nthe system by waiting to raise problems with a solicitation until after they failed to receive the\naward. As such, this Court declines CCS’ invitation to carve out an exception to the Blue &\nGold waiver rule.\n\n       Even if the Court were to invoke GAO’s rule, GAO’s exception to waiver would not\napply here. As GAO has noted, “In order to prevent the timeliness rules from becoming\nmeaningless, the significant issue exception is strictly construed and seldom used,” and the\nburden is on the untimely protestor to show that its protest is of “widespread interest to the\nprocurement community.” DePaul Hosp., 1987 WL 102790, at *4. Statutory violations of\nwidespread interest typically implicate broad procurement statutes.

It only applies to a very limited category of procurements\nwithin DoD -- NAFI contracts for “Personal Information Services” offered to users for a fee.\nCCS has not persuaded the Court that an alleged violation of this narrow statute would have\nsufficient widespread interest in the procurement community to vitiate a well-entrenched waiver\nrule.

Paragraph 1-21 of this policy states:\n\n       Selection of contractors and award of contracts must be made free of any conflict\n       of interest. A conflict of interest exists when the person selecting items for\n       purchase, selecting a contractor, placing an order or awarding a contract has a\n       financial interest in the business of the firm receiving an order or contract, or is in\n       a position to benefit because of a family interest. Contracting officers, their\n       representatives, ordering agents and other AAFES personnel who are authorized\n       to determine requirements, select items, or sign, approve, disapprove or\n       administer contracts (including inspection), are required to disqualify themselves\n       from contract transactions involving an actual or potential conflict of interest.\n\nAR 7980.\n\n      CCS posits that two FMWRC employees, David LaPradd and John Temple, who were on\nthe Source Selection Committee, and a third FMWRC employee, Nate Wills, an Army\n\n\n\n       15\n          Additionally, CCS claims violations of the FAR and Army Regulation 215-4, but these\nregulations do not apply to NAFIs.\n\n\n                                                 38\n\fcontracting specialist on the contracting team, had a financial interest in an award to Resolute,\nbecause Resolute proposed using ARMP as its primary subcontractor and ARMP is an affiliate\nof FMWRC. Specifically, CCS contends:\n\n       ARMP, Resolute’s primary subcontractor, is an affiliate (i.e., a subsidiary\n       organization) of their employer, FMWRC. Thus, at a minimum, these individuals\n       had a “direct or indirect financial interest” or “other beneficial interest” in a\n       “proposed subcontractor” of one of the firms submitting a proposal. Because they\n       were involved in “selecting items for purchase, selecting a contractor, placing an\n       order or awarding a contract” and, through their employer, had a “financial\n       interest in the business of the firm receiving” award, these individuals had an\n       impermissible conflict of interest.\n\nPl.’s Mem. in Support of Mot. Summ. J. (“Pl.’s Mem.”) 17, July 21, 2011 (internal citation\nomitted).\n\n        The Government argues that CCS waived this OCI claim because FMWRC’s\ninvolvement was known to CCS prior to the deadline for submission of proposals, pointing to\nslides from the Industry Day presentation. Resolute likewise argues that CCS waived this claim\nbecause FMWRC/ARMP personnel attended the conference and identified themselves as\nemployees of FMWRC and ARMP, and attendees, including at least four CCS employees, saw a\nslide entitled “Key Procurement/Operations Team” identifying three individuals from FMWRC\nand one from ARMP as team members. Intervenor’s Mem. in Support of Cross Mot. J. 15; see\nAR 279-80, 328-29. 16\n\n        CCS contends that the Industry Day materials did not provide it with sufficient notice of\nARMP’s and FMWRC’s role because the slide did not indicate whether Messrs. LaPradd,\nTemple, and Wills would be on the procurement or operations side. Pl.’s Reply & Opp’n 38.\nCCS’ post-hoc interpretation of this slide is not persuasive. Even if the slide did not detail the\nprecise involvement of the FMWRC employees in the procurement, it put CCS on notice that\nthey would be “key” players, triggering a duty to inquire. As Intervenor argues, “[t]o the extent\n[ARMP’s and FMWRC’s role] was unclear, CCS was obligated to seek clarification of the issue\nand protest if there was any ambiguity.” Intervenor’s Reply 6. On several occasions, CCS\nsought clarification or voiced complaints about other aspects of the procurement, and AAFES\nregularly responded to these inquiries. Even though it was on notice of these individuals’ “key”\nroles in the procurement, CCS did not raise its OCI complaint until after it was denied the award.\nTherefore, CCS waived its ability to protest on these grounds under Blue & Gold.\n\nCCS’ Organizational Conflict of Interest Claim Fails\n\n       Even if CCS had not waived its OCI claim, this claim is unfounded. CCS’ OCI claim is\npredicated on AAFES’ procurement policy, which provides: “A conflict of interest exists when\n\n\n\n       16\n          Neither Defendant nor Intervenor argue that CCS had notice of these employees’ roles\nin the procurement by virtue of the Implementing Instructions.\n\n\n                                               39\n\fthe person selecting items for purchase, selecting a contractor, placing an order or awarding a\ncontract has a financial interest in the business of the firm receiving an order or contract . . .”\nAR 7980. AAFES enforced this aspect of its procurement policy by requiring the Source\nSelection Committee members to complete and submit a Conflict of Interest Statement. AR\n8139. The form stated:\n\n       To the best of my knowledge and belief, no conflict of interest exists that may\n       diminish my capacity to perform an impartial and objective review of the\n       offeror’s proposal, or may otherwise result in a biased opinion or an unfair\n       advantage. . . . In determining whether any potential conflict of interest exists, I\n       agree to review whether my or my employer’s relationships with other persons or\n       entities, including but not limited to, ownership of stocks, bonds, other\n       outstanding financial interests or commitments, employment arrangements (past,\n       present, or under consideration) . . . may place me in a position of conflict, real or\n       apparent, with the evaluation proceedings.\n\nAR 8142. Each member was required to complete the form and return it to the contracting\nofficer. AR 8139.\n\n        However, Messrs. LaPradd, Temple, and Wills submitted a different form, entitled\nCertificate for Personnel Participating in Source Selection Concerning Nondisclosure, Conflicts\nof Interest, and Rules of Conduct. AR 8152 (Mr. LaPradd), 8154 (Mr. Temple), 8157 (Mr.\nWills). That form contained the following statement regarding conflicts of interest:\n\n       To the best of my knowledge, I certify that neither I nor my spouse . . . have any\n       direct or indirect financial interest in any of the firms submitting proposals, or\n       their proposed subcontractors or have any other beneficial interest in such firm\n       except as fully disclosed on an attachment to this certification.\n\nId. (¶ 2). None of these three employees disclosed a beneficial interest on an attachment. Id.\n\n       Plaintiff claims that “[t]he representations made by Messrs. LaPradd, Temple, and Wills\nin such forms are demonstrably and unassailably inaccurate,” based solely on the fact of their\nemployment at FMWRC, their roles on either the Source Selection Committee or the contracting\nteam, ARMP’s status as a potential subcontractor, and FMWRC’s relationship with ARMP.\nPl.’s Mem. 17-18.\n\n        The mere circumstances of these employees’ positions and ARMP’s role do not establish\nthat the FMWRC personnel in question had a financial interest in Resolute. CCS’ OCI claim is\npredicated solely on the fact that ARMP is an affiliate of FMWRC, Messrs. LaPradd, Temple,\nand Wills’ employer. CCS asserts a broad-based speculative contention that these three\nemployees necessarily had a financial interest in ARMP based on this affiliation. In essence,\nCCS would divine a prohibited financial interest on the part of these FMWRC employees “in the\nbusiness of” ARMP and attribute that interest to Resolute. Nothing in the record suggests that\nARMP’s performance under Resolute’s contract could have impacted the compensation of\nMessrs. LaPradd, Temple, and Wills. CCS also ignores the fact that in its own proposal, it\n\n\n\n                                                40\n\fplanned to use ARMP, thus creating the same conflict of interest it alleges. Specifically, CCS’\nproposal stated: “CCS has plans and the necessary partnerships, including ARMP, in place to\nroll services out to all locations . . . .” AR 713 (Tab 13). Of the 74 mandatory bases CCS\nproposed to service with internet, CCS proposed using ARMP as its “deployment partner” at 18\nlocations, and using ARMP infrastructure where available. AR 804, 830-34 (Tab 13).\n\n        In this procurement, contractors were offering to provide Personal Information Services\ndirectly to service members. AAFES was to obtain a commission, but there was no showing that\nsuch commission would inure to the benefit of FMWRC personnel. To demonstrate an\norganizational conflict of interest, a protestor must identify “hard facts” -- a mere inference or\nsuspicion of a conflict is not enough. PAI Corp. v. United States, 614 F.3d 1347, 1352-54 (Fed.\nCir. 2010) (finding that no organizational conflict of interest existed because the plaintiff failed\nto identify “hard facts”); see also JWK Int’l Corp. v. United States, 52 Fed. Cl. 650, 659 (2002),\naff’d, 56 F. App’x 474 (Fed. Cir. 2003); L-3 Servs., Inc., B-400134.11, 2009 CPD ¶ 171, 2009\nWL 2883179, at *11 (Comp. Gen. Sept. 3, 2009) (finding no impaired objectivity when the\nrelationship between the firms was attenuated and the possibility of financial benefit was too\nremote); Am. Mgmt. Sys., Inc., B-285645, 2000 CPD ¶ 163, 2000 WL 1507307, at *4-5 (Comp.\nGen.

Gen. Aug. 24, 1998) (finding alleged conflict of interest too speculative based on\nconsultant evaluator receiving royalty payments if a certain design were selected).\n\n        Nor has CCS demonstrated the requisite prejudice to establish an OCI claim. As the\nCourt stated in JWK International Corporation v. United States, “[i]n short, even assuming the\nexistence of a conflict, plaintiff has not shown that ‘had it not been for the alleged error in the\nprocurement process, there was a reasonable likelihood that [it] would have been awarded the\ncontract.’” 52 Fed. Cl. at 658 (second alteration in original) (quoting Data Gen. Corp. v.\nJohnson, 78 F.3d 1556, 1562 (Fed. Cir. 1996)); see also Galen Med. Assocs., Inc. v. United\nStates, 369 F.3d 1324, 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (stating that to “prevail in a protest the protester\nmust show not only a significant error in the procurement process, but also that the error\nprejudiced it.” (citation and quotation marks omitted)). Similarly, CCS has not shown that there\nwas a reasonable likelihood it would have received the award if Messrs. LaPradd and Temple\nwere not part of the evaluation team and Mr. Wills was not part of the contracting team. CCS\nhas not claimed that the two FMWRC personnel on the Source Selection Committee evaluated\nCCS or Resolute differently than the other three voting Committee members. In fact, Resolute’s\nscore would have been higher than CCS’ score even if the evaluations of Messrs. LaPradd and\nTemple were removed from the mix. As such, CCS’ claim that an organizational conflict of\ninterest existed in this procurement under AAFES’ procurement policies fails.\n\nAAFES’ Evaluation of Proposals\n\n       CCS claims that AAFES incorrectly evaluated the proposals by failing to use the\nproposal scoring template and by normalizing the penetration rates.\n\n\n\n\n                                                41\n\f       Scoring\n\n        CCS claims that AAFES’ numeric scoring of the offerors’ proposals did not reflect the\nactual strengths and weaknesses assigned by the Source Selection Committee. Specifically, CCS\nargues that the majority of the individual evaluators failed to use the “proposal scoring template”\nwhich provided the following comment codes: SS = significant strength, S = strength, SW =\nsignificant weakness, W = weakness, C = clarification, and R = risk. E.g., AR 1253, 10508.\nOnly one evaluator used the recommended comment codes, while the other evaluators either\nused a plus, minus, and neutral system, or simply provided comments. E.g., AR 1308-13, 1369-\n74, 1486-91 (using the required codes); AR 1248-1253, 1349-1354 (using mix of plus/minus and\nwritten comments).\n        CCS argues that the evaluators’ plus/minus system did not distinguish between strengths\nand significant strengths or weaknesses and significant weaknesses, or identify risks. Given the\nsubjective assessments required, CCS fails to appreciate the discretion afforded technical\nevaluators in scoring the technical elements in this procurement and overemphasizes the role of\nthe proposal scoring template. Neither the solicitation nor AAFES’ Exchange Operating\nProcedure 65-13 required the use of comment codes for Significant Strengths, Strengths,\nWeaknesses, Significant Weaknesses, and Risks. According to the solicitation, evaluators were\nto numerically score proposals for each of the 11 evaluation factors, and justify the final ratings\n“by drawing upon the strengths, weaknesses, and risks identified.” AR 453-54. The individual\nevaluation sheets reflect that the evaluators complied with this requirement. Each team member\nwrote notes articulating what aspects of each proposal warranted a given score. See, e.g., AR\n1271 (noting that CCS has 10 years in the internet business and experience working on a military\nbase, as justification for a past performance score of [ * * * ] out of 100); AR 1389 (noting that\nResolute allows WiFi subscribers to print to Resolute printers and that gaming devices may be\nassociated with user accounts, as justification for a products score of [ * * * ] out of 100). The\nfailure to regurgitate the comment codes listed on the individual evaluator worksheets is a matter\nof form, not substance, and does not warrant invalidating the technical evaluation. As the\nFederal Circuit has recognized, challenges to the technical scoring involve the “minutiae of the\nprocurement process,” “discretionary determinations of procurement officials that a court will\nnot second guess.” COMINT, 700 F.3d at 1384 (quotation marks omitted) (quoting E.W. Bliss\nCo. v. United States, 77 F.3d 445, 449 (Fed.

While CCS presented a\nfull critical path graph for each installation, Resolute chose to group the installations into\ncategories, then provide a critical path for each category. Compare AR 804-26 (Tab 14) with AR\n535-41 (Tab 13).\n\n\n                                                 43\n\f        CCS argues that the strengths and weaknesses identified in the Source Selection\nCommittee Report are “completely at odds” with the numeric scores. AR 1520. In so arguing,\nCCS disregards the results of the Committee’s consensus evaluation of each proposal, which\nassigned Resolute more strengths and fewer weaknesses overall than CCS. Compare AR 7825-\n26, 7828-30 (Resolute’s strength/weakness determinations) with 7835-7839 (CCS’\nstrength/weakness determinations). For example, under the Technical Design factor, one of the\ntwo most important evaluation factors, CCS received [ * * * ] weaknesses and [ * * * ] strengths\nas compared to Resolute’s [ * * * ] weakness and [ * * * ] strengths, a finding that reasonably\nsupports to the higher score Resolute received. AR 7825, 7838. The same is true for the other\n“disconnects” CCS alleged, with the difference in scores reflecting the strength/weakness\ndeterminations:\n\n           •   Scalability: Resolute had [ * * ] strengths and [ * ] weaknesses compared to CCS’\n               [ * * ] strengths and [ * * ] weakness. AR 7828, 7836;\n\n           •   Standards: Resolute had [ * * ] strengths and [ * ] weaknesses compared to CCS’\n               [ * * ] strengths and [ * * ] weaknesses. AR 7828, 7836;\n\n           •   Portability: Resolute had [ * * ] strengths and [ * ] weaknesses compared to CCS’\n               [ * * ] strengths and [ * * ] weaknesses. AR 7826, 7835;\n\n           •   Past Performance: Resolute had [ * * ] strengths and [ * * ] weaknesses compared\n               to CCS’ [ * * ] strengths and [ * * ] weaknesses. AR 7829, 7837; and\n\n           •   Speed to Market: Resolute had [ * * ] strengths and [ * * ] weakness compared to\n               CCS’ [ * * ] strengths. AR 7826, 7835.\n        This was a best value procurement, and the technical evaluators were charged with\nassessing which proposal’s overall features, including technical design, products, portability,\nspeed to market, customer service, and business understanding, best met the Government’s\nneeds. As the Federal Circuit has recognized, “agencies ‘are entrusted with a good deal of\ndiscretion in determining which bid is the most advantageous to the Government.’” Lockheed\nMissiles & Space Co., Inc. v. Bentsen, 4 F.3d 955, 958 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (quoting Tidewater\nMgmt. Servs., Inc. v. United States, 216 Ct. Cl. 69, 83 (1978)); Glenn Def. Marine (ASIA), PTE\nLtd. v. United States, 720 F.3d 901, 911 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (citing E.W. Bliss, 77 F.3d at 449\n(citations omitted)) (holding that a court will not second guess the discretionary determinations\nof procurement officials regarding the minutiae of the procurement process including technical\nratings); COMINT, 700 F.3d at 1384 (same); Galen, 369 F.3d at 1330 (citing E.W. Bliss, 77 F.3d\nat 449) (stating that the contracting officer has even greater discretion when a contract is to be\nawarded on “best value” than on the basis of cost alone).\n\n        CCS further alleges that the Source Selection Committee violated AAFES procurement\npolicies by using flawed ratings and failing to justify the numeric scores given to CCS and\nResolute. The record does not support this allegation. Rather, the record reflects that each\nvoting member of the Source Selection Committee independently evaluated and scored each\nevaluation factor for each proposal and wrote comments explaining or justifying the member’s\nindependent determination. AR 1248-1499. For example, for the Products evaluation factor,\n\n\n                                               44\n\fone member gave CCS a score of [ * ], with comments that CCS could “rollout by June 2011 as\nrequested,” had “multiple ‘architectures’ of systems used to serve different bases/environments,”\nand could provide internet in public hotspots. AR 1248. A different Committee member gave\nCCS a score of [ * ] for the Products evaluation factor, noting that CCS “complies with all\nrequirements,” that it was “[c]urrently providing internet service through DSL equipment,” that it\nhad “[g]ood experience in [the] military environment, but seems to offer only one method, either\nDSL or Cable modem,” and that it had “[l]imited offerings dependent on partnership.” AR 1328.\nWhile the individualized ratings spanned a wide range, this does not mean they were flawed or\nerroneous. Instead, this circumstance highlights the subjectivity of the evaluation process and\nthe reality that different aspects of CCS’ offer were valued by the individual raters. “This Court\ndoes not sit as a super source selection authority to second guess and re-score offerors’\nproposals.” AshBritt, Inc. v. United States, 87 Fed. Cl. 344, 367, opinion clarified by, 87 Fed.\nCl. 654 (2009); Ne. Military Sales, Inc. v. United States, 100 Fed. Cl. 103, 110 (2011) (“[T]he\nevaluation of proposals for their technical excellence or quality is a process that often requires\nthe special expertise of procurement officials, and thus reviewing courts give the greatest\ndeference possible to these determinations.” (citation and quotation marks omitted)). CCS has\nnot demonstrated that the ratings were flawed, or the numeric scores unwarranted. See\nCOMINT, 700 F.3d at 1384.\n\n        CCS also contends that the Source Selection Committee’s consensus scores were\ninadequately justified. Once the individual evaluations were completed, Source Selection\nCommittee members met to determine their consensus scores and modified their individual\nscores as a result of the discussion. See AR 7492 (EOP 65-13 ¶ 4-23). The modifications were\neither made directly on score sheets or were reflected as differences between the numerical\nscores on individual score sheets and the final Source Selection Committee Proposal Scoring\nSpreadsheet, which reflected the consensus numbers. E.g., AR 1270-73 (noting changes in\nspecific factor scores “after discussion”); AR 1328-33 (highlighting several large point increases\nfor CCS from its original score).\n\n        Below is a summary of the changes between the initial individual scores and the Source\nSelection Committee’s Proposal Scoring Spreadsheet for Resolute’s and CCS’ proposals for\ninternet services:\n\n                Individual Source Selection Committee Member Scores for CCS 18\n\n                    Individual Scores Pre Consensus Meeting   Individual Scores Post Consensus Meeting\nEvaluation Factor   JT      DL      AM      MK       MV       JT      DL       AM      MK       MV\n                    [***]   [***]   [***]   [***]    [***]    [***]   [***]    [***]   [***]    [***]\nProducts\n                    [***]   [***]   [***]   [***]    [***]    [***]   [***]    [***]   [***]    [***]\nPortability\n                    [***]   [***]   [***]   [***]    [***]    [***]   [***]    [***]   [***]    [***]\nMarketing\n                    [***]   [***]   [***]   [***]    [***]    [***]   [***]    [***]   [***]    [***]\nTechnical Design\n                    [***]   [***]   [***]   [***]    [***]    [***]   [***]    [***]   [***]    [***]\nScalability\n\n\n        18\n          This comparison is derived from scores on individual score sheets in AR 1248-1432\nand on the Source Selection Committee’s Proposal Scoring spreadsheet in AR 1228 and 1230.\n\n\n                                                    45\n\f                    [***]       [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]      [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]\nStandards\n                    [***]       [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]      [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]\nSpeed to Market\nCustomer Account\nService             [***]       [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]      [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]\n\nCustomer Care and\nCustomer\n                    [***]       [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]      [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]\nSatisfaction\n                    [***]       [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]      [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]\nPast Performance\nBusiness\nUnderstanding and\n                    [***]       [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]      [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]\nReporting\n\nAR 1228, 1248-53, 1268-73, 1290-95, 1308-13, 1328-33.\n\n               Individual Source Selection Committee Member Scores for Resolute\n\n                        Individual Scores Pre Consensus Meeting            Individual Scores Post Consensus Meeting\nEvaluation Factor\n                        JT        DL        AM        MK         MV        JT        DL        AM        MK        MV\n                        [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]      [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]\nProducts\n                        [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]      [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]\nPortability\n                        [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]      [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]\nMarketing\n                        [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]      [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]\nTechnical Design\n                        [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]      [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]\nScalability\n                        [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]      [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]\nStandards\n                        [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]      [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]\nSpeed to Market\nCustomer      Account\nService                 [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]      [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]\n\n\nCustomer Care and\nCustomer Satisfaction   [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]      [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]\n\n                        [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]      [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]\nPast Performance\nBusiness\n                        [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]      [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]\nUnderstanding\n\nAR 1230, 1349-54, 1369-74, 1389-94, 1407-12, 1427-32.\n\n       These tables show that as a result of Source Selection Committee discussions, individual\nCommittee members reconsidered and at times altered their original scores. The modified\nindividual scores were then converted into weighted scores for each factor by each individual\nevaluator. AR 1228, 1230.

However, the evaluators’ comments indicate that they weighed the merits of each\n\n\n                                                            46\n\fproposal and considered all aspects of the proposals in arriving at their scores and rankings.\nThere is no reason for this Court to second guess the scoring here. “[I]t is well established that\nthe Court should not substitute its judgment to assess the relative merits of competing proposals\nin a government procurement.” AshBritt, 87 Fed.

AR 1520,\n7840. The Source Selection Committee Report states that “[r]eferences for each offeror were\ncontacted and used in evaluations. The reference calls were incorporated into the past\nperformance factor and scored accordingly. No information was received from the reference\ncalls that resulted in any scoring impact.” AR 1520. The record reflects that each voting\nmember of the Source Selection Committee made reference calls and documented the\ninformation from each call. See AR 1266-67, 1286-87, 1326-27, 1346-47 (reflecting eight\nreference calls about CCS and noting customers’ feedback, e.g., customer was “very pleased\nwith [CCS’] performance,” CCS had “great customer support” and was “on target [with]\neverything”); 1367-68, 1387-88, 1425-26, 1445-46 (reflecting eight reference calls about\nResolute and noting customers’ feedback, e.g., customers were “very pleased with [Resolute’s]\nperformance” and “happy [with Resolute] on service and response to problems,” and Resolute\nhad a “well dedicated model” and was “very responsive to all customer needs”).\n\n        Lastly, CCS claims that the Source Selection Authority adopted the “flawed ratings”\nwithout discussing the significance of the technical differences in terms of contract performance\nor governmental needs. According to CCS, the Source Selection Decision highlighted the same\nscores, strengths, and weaknesses identified by the Source Selection Committee without\n“digging deeper and analyzing the significance of the scores.” Pl.’s Mem. 45. However, CCS\nhas not shown that the underlying technical evaluations were incorrect, irrational, or\ninadequately documented, or that the findings here warranted “digging deeper.” Indeed, CCS\nignores the fact that the Source Selection Committee found Resolute to be the hands down\nchoice in the technical and past performance factors. The Committee’s Report stated:\n\n       With the exception of the corporate financial position, this is clearly the best\n       proposal.\n\n       . . . Resolute has strong, flexible product options with ample bandwidth and value\n       enhancements to offer customers. Network design and options for providing\n       service are robust, leveraging [its] extensive experience with AAFES. Resolute\n       consistently presented superior solutions to all factors requested within the RFP.\n\nAR 1520-21.\n\nAAFES’ Fee Evaluations\n\n       CCS claims that AAFES’ evaluation of price proposals was arbitrary and capricious\nbecause AAFES improperly “normalized” the offerors’ price proposals in two respects: (1) it\nused a “normalized penetration rate” -- the estimated percentage of the base population that\nwould pay for internet service -- based solely on ARMP’s subscription information, and (2) it\n\n\n                                               47\n\fused a “normalized base revenue figure.” CCS contends that the normalized penetration rate was\nimproper because the solicitation allowed offerors to choose their technical approaches and did\nnot force them to use ARMP. CCS claims the agency’s use of a normalized base revenue figure\nwas unnecessary because offerors submitted pro forma Operating Statements and cost\nprojections as required by the RFP. CCS further contends that because these normalized\nprotocols were not disclosed in the solicitation CCS was prejudiced.\n\n        The purpose of normalization is to measure offers against the same “baseline.” As this\nCourt has recognized, it is appropriate to use normalization techniques in procurements when\nthere is no logical basis for differences in approach or when there is insufficient information\navailable to accurately evaluate proposals. Computer Scis. Corp. v. United States, 51 Fed. Cl.\n297, 316 (2002) (citation omitted). Normalization allows the agency to establish a common\n“should have bid” estimate. Id. (citation omitted). It segregates “cost factors which are\n‘company unique’ . . . from those which are generally applicable to all offerors . . . .” Univ.\nResearch Co., LLC v. United States, 65 Fed. Cl. 500, 510 (2005) (quotation marks omitted)\n(quoting Computer Scis., 51 Fed. Cl. at 316 (citation omitted)). In order to overturn an agency’s\nnormalization decision, the protestor must demonstrate that the choice made by the agency was\nirrational. Marquette Med. Sys., Inc., B-277827.5, B-277827.7, 99-1 CPD ¶ 90, 1999 WL\n311686, at *5 (Comp. Gen. Apr. 29, 1999).\n\n       To calculate the projected financial benefit of offers, AAFES used the following formula:\n\n       Projected Income = Base Population x Price x Fee Percentage x Penetration Rate\n\nAAFES’ independent consultant, Deloitte, calculated standard penetration rates for these services\nbased on FMWRC’s historical usage rates in the Continental United States. AR 5876, 5879.\nThe rates used were 1.8% for pre-paid hourly service, 1.1% for pre-paid daily service, 0.8% for\npre-paid weekly service, and 2.9% for pre-paid monthly service. AR 5879.\n\n        In their pro forma Operating Statements, offerors assumed different penetration rates,\nwhich translated into different potential revenues. CCS proposed a flat fee of [ * * * ] based on a\n[ * * * * * * ] penetration rate, while Resolute proposed fees from [ * * * * * ] based on a\npenetration rate of [ * * * * ]. Neither offeror allowed for different penetration rates depending\non whether a customer chose hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly service options, yet AAFES’\nhistorical data showed that there were different rates for these services. Because the dollar\namount that AAFES would receive in fees was pegged to usage and dependent upon accurate\npenetration rates, AAFES needed to compensate for either overstatements or understatements of\npotential usage in order to accurately measure revenues. Normalizing the penetration rate\nallowed AAFES to accurately measure how CCS’ and Resolute’s different fee percentages\nwould translate into dollars received by AAFES. Thus, CCS has not shown that AAFES’\ndecision to normalize the penetration rate was unreasonable or prejudicial.\n\nAAFES’ Responsibility Determination of Resolute\n\n       According to AAFES policy, a responsible prospective contractor must meet seven\nminimum standards. See AR 8020 (ESR Policy 65-1 ¶ 4-46). At issue in this case are two\nstandards -- that a prospective contractor must (1) have adequate financial resources, or the\n\n\n                                                48\n\fability to obtain such resources as required during performance, and (2) have a record of\nsatisfactory performance “or be able to document beyond reasonable doubt that any prior\nproblems that created a marginal or unsatisfactory situation have been eliminated.” Id. CCS\nargues that the responsibility determination was arbitrary and capricious because the contracting\nofficer unreasonably concluded that Resolute had adequate financial resources and that its prior\nperformance difficulties had been resolved.\n\n       The Financial Responsibility Determination\n\n        CCS claims there is inadequate factual support to conclude that Resolute had sufficient\nfinancial resources to perform the contract and that AAFES placed too much emphasis on how\nthe contract award would improve Resolute’s financial outlook. “Contracting officers are\n‘generally given wide discretion’ in making responsibility determinations and in determining the\namount of information that is required to make a responsibility determination.” Impresa\nConstruzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United States, 238 F.3d 1324, 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2001)\n(citing Grimberg, 702 F.2d at 1367); NCL Logistics Co. v. United States, 109 Fed. Cl. 596, 610\n(2013); Afghan Am. Army Servs. Corp. v. United States, 106 Fed. Cl. 714, 722 (2012); Tech\nSys., Inc. v. United States, 98 Fed. Cl. 228, 266 (2011). The Court “cannot substitute [its]\njudgment for that of the contracting officer in making responsibility determinations.” Bender\nShipbuilding & Repair Co. v. United States, 297 F.3d 1358, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (upholding a\nfinancial responsibility determination because even though the awardee had financial problems,\nthe contracting officer examined the financial data before him and articulated a rational\nexplanation for his decision).\n\n        Under AAFES’ procurement policy, in order to be financially responsible, a prospective\ncontractor must have “adequate financial resources, or the ability to obtain such resources, as\nrequired during the performance of the contract.” AR 8020. The contracting officer here\nconsidered Resolute’s past financial difficulties, but placed more weight on the likelihood of\nResolute’s improved financial future, which was permissible under AAFES’ policy -- requiring\nthat a contractor have the “ability to obtain” adequate financial resources. This is not arbitrary\nand capricious or irrational action.\n\n        A paramount element of CCS’ challenge to Resolute’s responsibility determination\nconcerns Resolute’s [ * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ]. CCS claims that Resolute was in “default”\non this loan, but nothing in the record supports a conclusion that Resolute had defaulted or\nmissed payments on its [ * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ]. The contracting officer was aware of the\nloan. AAFES contacted the bank, and the bank provided documentation showing that Resolute\nwas repaying the loan. AR 1755, 8539, 8540-41. Further, the bank [ * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n* * * * * * * * ]. Instead of finding Resolute in default, [ * * * * * * ] unequivocally stated that\nResolute was a stable business, “performing per its agreed loan terms with [ * * * * * ],” that the\nbank would continue to support Resolute and was comfortable with Resolute’s ability to meet its\nobligations. AR 8540.\n\n       A responsibility determination is a business judgment, and contracting officials enjoy\nwide discretion in determining whether proceeding to award a contract to a particular entity\nposes undue risk. NCL Logistics, 109 Fed. Cl. at 623 (citations omitted). Here, the agency\nmade this award fully aware of Resolute’s financial challenges and determined Resolute to be\n\n\n                                                49\n\fresponsible. See Ettefaq-Meliat-Hai-Afghan Consulting, Inc. v. United States, 106 Fed. Cl. 429,\n436 (2012) (citations omitted) (“[T]his type of assessment is a quintessential business judgment,\nand this Court will not second guess the contracting officer’s judgment where there is supporting\nevidence.”). In Bender Shipbuilding, the Federal Circuit affirmed a financial responsibility\ndetermination where the Army awarded a contract to a bidder that had recently filed for\nbankruptcy under Chapter 11. 297 F.3d at 1362-63. The contracting officer in Bender\nShipbuilding acknowledged the seriousness of the company’s financial situation but awarded it\nthe contract, based in part on a guarantee of performance by the offeror’s parent company and\nthe availability of progress payments under the contract. Id. at 1360. In upholding the decision,\nthe Federal Circuit noted the “wide discretion” that contracting officers have in making\nresponsibility determinations and acknowledged that the awardee and its parent had financial\nproblems, but did not disturb the contracting officer’s determination that the awardee was\nfinancially responsible. Id. at 1362. The awardee in Bender Shipbuilding was in a more\nprecarious position than Resolute here. There is no indication that Resolute was approaching\nbankruptcy, and Resolute demonstrated that it had support from [ * * * * * * ]. CCS has not\nshown that the contracting officer abused her discretion in finding Resolute responsible.\n\n        Citing the Vendor Financial Clearance data, CCS argues that since Resolute was not\ncleared for the full contract amount, or even for [ * ] of the contract amount, it should not have\nbeen found financially responsible. A financial clearance is “an independent source of\ninformation for the contracting officer” indicating a “firm’s financial capability.” AR 8033.\nFinancial clearance under AAFES’ policy is only required for “merchandise, supplies, and\nequipment purchases.” Id. The purpose of AAFES’ financial clearance policy is to “make sure\nthe supplier will ship ordered merchandise timely and will reimburse AAFES for returns (QA\nrejections, recalls, aged merchandise, and so forth).” Id. This contract was not for the purchase\nof “merchandise, supplies, or equipment,” but rather involved provision of telecommunication\nservices to users for a fee with a portion of that fee going back to the NAFI. As such, the\nfinancial arrangement here did not pose the type of risk AAFES’ financial clearance was\nintended to address. In any event, AAFES policy states that the financial clearance process does\nnot, by itself, dictate responsibility. Id. The policy allows a contracting officer to find an\nawardee financially responsible even if it does not receive financial clearance in an amount\nequivalent to the proposed purchase. Id.\n\n       CCS further challenges AAFES’ use of financial statements. CCS correctly observes that\nthe contracting officer erroneously claimed that Resolute’s financial analysis was based on\n“audited financial statements for 2007, 2008, and 2009.” AR 1755 (emphasis added). In fact,\nResolute submitted audited statements for 2007 and 2008, and unaudited statements for 2009.\nWhile CCS claims the absence of audited statements for 2009 should have “set off alarm bells,”\nits own actions belie this claim. CCS itself did not submit audited financial statements. AR\n1011.\n\n        The remainder of CCS’ challenges to the financial responsibility determination rest solely\non matters the Court may not address -- declarations that are not in the record containing Mr.\nJackson’s opinions as to Mr. Wright’s financial analysis and the contracting officer’s decision.\nThe record provides no basis for this Court to overturn the contracting officer’s responsibility\ndetermination. AAFES and the contracting officer were fully aware of Resolute’s financial\ndifficulties. AAFES’ expert, Mr. Wright, acknowledged that Resolute faced severe financial\n\n\n                                               50\n\fchallenges, but projected that if Resolute received the award of the AAFES contract, Resolute’s\nfinancial outlook would greatly improve. AR 1755, 8484. The contracting officer reasonably\nrelied on Mr. Wright’s analysis, noting not only that award would improve Resolute’s financial\noutlook, but that Resolute would be able to “meet commission payment requirements during the\ncontract period of performance.” AR 1756. As Bender Shipbuilding established, it is\npermissible for a contracting officer to consider income that a contractor would receive if the\ncontract at issue were awarded. 297 F.3d at 1362-63.\n\n       Consideration of Past Performance in the Responsibility Determination\n\n        CCS attempts to find fault with the contracting officer’s consideration of Resolute’s past\nperformance, arguing that the contracting officer ignored critical information. The contracting\nofficer identified two main past performance issues for Resolute. The first was a warning letter\ndated October 16, 2009, for a service disruption. AR 1757. The contracting officer noted that\nthe issue had been resolved in a timely manner and that service had been restored the same day.\nThe second issue was a demand for the nonpayment of fees issued on January 13, 2010, and CCS\nclaims that the contracting officer ignored a cure notice from February 2010, but this allegation\nis not supported by the record. The February 2010 letter discussed the same debt referenced in\nthe January 13, 2010 letter, provided Resolute with an additional 30 days to provide a “more\ndefinitive action plan” and was part of the corrective action process referenced in the\nresponsibility determination. AR 10529; see AR 1757-58. The contracting officer found that\nResolute took sufficient corrective action, including a renegotiation of debt owed to AAFES.\nAR 1757-58. While the contracting officer did not cite the February 2010 letter, this is not a\nbasis to overturn her responsibility determination. As the contracting officer noted, Resolute\nbegan making payments on all debts in July 2010, and had consistently made payments since\nthen. AR 1758.\n\n       The Alleged Appearance of Impropriety\n\n        CCS alleges that the debt Resolute owed AAFES from a prior contract created an\nappearance of impropriety. CCS claims that FMWRC’s and ARMP’s involvement in the\nprocurement, coupled with their and AAFES’ interest in Resolute, created an “aura of\ninevitability” in the outcome of the competition, and skewed the competition in favor of\nResolute. However, CCS has not cited any case where a procurement was overturned on the\nground that a debt of an awardee to a government procuring entity created an appearance of\nimpropriety.\n\n        CCS contends that there was an appearance of impropriety for several reasons. First,\nCCS claims that Resolute’s debt gave AAFES an interest in the financial success of Resolute and\na reason to favor Resolute in the competition. However, as the Government points out, Resolute\nand AAFES had agreed upon a new payment schedule prior to award, and Resolute was current\nunder that schedule. Further, the record contains no evidence that the debt affected any member\nof the Source Selection Committee, their scores, or the evaluations of any offerors.\n\n       Second, CCS argues that due to AAFES’ partnership with FMWRC, AAFES had a\nvested interest in the outcome of the procurement, FMWRC as ARMP’s parent organization\n\n\n\n                                               51\n\fwould benefit from the fees Resolute would pay to ARMP for use of ARMP’s network, and an\naward to Resolute would significantly expand ARMP’s market share. However, there is no\nproof that the relationships of ARMP, AAFES, and FMWRC with Resolute were any different\nthan their relationships with CCS. Both CCS and Resolute had prior working relationships with\nARMP, and like Resolute, CCS planned to use ARMP at bases covered under the contract -- as\nthe solicitation permitted. AR 830-34.\n\n        Third, CCS points to an email from Resolute to an ARMP employee requesting that the\nemployee inform AAFES how well Resolute and ARMP worked together as a team on an earlier\nproject. The email states:\n\n       AAFES will be evaluating bidders on their technical abilities and speed to market\n       as extremely important criteria. The fact that ARMP and Resolute working\n       together completed our [transfer of function] responsibilities within 35 days of\n       our actually being told we could proceed. I believe this shows we make a\n       formidable rapid response team. Any way you can get this information to them in\n       writing [which] can only help our mutual case[?] Bill Hart/ARMP was listed as a\n       reference in our reference binder that was submitted 3 weeks ago so there may be\n       a couple ways you could get this scorecard to the right folks. Indirectly, I hope\n       John Temple and Nate Wills are also aware of our mutual accomplishments.\n\nAR 2195. According to CCS, this email shows both that Resolute was attempting to use its\nrelationship with ARMP to its advantage in the evaluation and that ARMP had an interest in the\nprocurement. The Government notes that no employee of ARMP, FMWRC, or AAFES ever\nresponded to the email or agreed to reach out on Resolute’s behalf. Nor is there any evidence\nthat any member of the Source Selection Committee was contacted as a result of this email. As\nsuch, this email does not create an appearance of impropriety.\n\n        The Government argues that CCS’ appearance of impropriety argument is actually an\nallegation of bias in favor of Resolute on the part of government officials, and that CCS cannot\nmeet the evidentiary standard to show bias which requires overcoming the presumption of good\nfaith. In Space Age Engineering, Inc. v. United States, the Court applied the bias standard to an\nappearance of impropriety claim. 4 Cl. Ct. 739, 743-45 (1984) (finding that inferences and\nallegations failed to constitute the “clear and convincing proof” required to show impropriety on\nthe part of the government).\n\n        CCS disputes that it alleged bad faith or bias, and thus argues it should not be required to\nmeet the standard of “well-nigh irrefragable proof.” Whether one characterizes CCS’ claim as\nbias or an appearance of impropriety, CCS must demonstrate hard facts to prevail. Turner\nConstr. Co. v. United States, 645 F.3d 1377, 1387 (Fed. Cir. 2011); see also CACI, 719 F.2d at\n1583 (overturning trial court’s decision to enjoin contract award based on an appearance of\nimpropriety when the decision was based on “suspicion and innuendo” rather than hard facts);\nFour Points By Sheraton v. United States, 66 Fed. Cl. 776, 787 (2005) (rejecting plaintiff’s\nallegation of bias based upon alleged inconsistent or erroneous evaluations as vague and without\nevidentiary support); Jacobs Tech. Inc. v. United States, 100 Fed. Cl. 198, 218 (2011) (finding\nthat alleged access to offices, participation in meetings, and roles in development of databases\n\n\n\n                                                52\n\fwere not “hard facts” showing that a contractor obtained specific non-public source selection\ninformation about a pricing evaluation). In Dynalectron Corporation v. United States, the Claims\nCourt declined to find an appearance of impropriety because the allegation was based on\nsuspicion and innuendo, stating, “Plaintiff wants relief because of how [the procurement] looked,\nnot because of how it was.” 4 Cl. Ct. 424, 430 (1984).\n\n        The only evidence proffered by CCS in support of this appearance-of-impropriety claim\nis the email from Resolute to ARMP requesting that ARMP put in a good word for Resolute due\nto the good quality and speedy implementation of Resolute’s prior work for ARMP. This email\nis similar to the situation addressed in Galen where the awardee listed a technical evaluator as a\npast performance reference, and the Federal Circuit held that the evaluator’s name on a list of\nreferences was insufficient to show that the procurement was tainted. 369 F.3d at 1335-37.\nSimilarly, the fact that Resolute requested an ARMP employee to provide what was essentially a\npast performance reference does not taint the competition here. As noted above, no employee of\nARMP, FMWRC, or AAFES ever responded to the email, and there is no evidence in the record\nthat ARMP contacted any member of the Source Selection Committee as a result of Resolute’s\nemail. CCS has failed to present sufficient evidence of an appearance of impropriety that tainted\nthe award.\n\n                                          Conclusion\n\n        1.     The Court GRANTS IN PART Defendant’s motion to strike the declarations of\nTimothy Evard and Jimmy J. Jackson. The Court supplements the record with Paragraphs 12\nand 13 of Mr. Evard’s first declaration, 1 through 11 of Mr. Evard’s second declaration, and the\nentirety of Mr. Evard’s third declaration, and strikes the remainder of Mr. Evard’s declarations.\nThe Court strikes Mr. Jackson’s declarations.\n\n        2.    The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment (treated as a motion\nfor judgment on the administrative record).\n\n      3.

(“CCS”) challenges the Army and\nAir Force Exchange Service’s (“AAFES”) award of a contract for internet and\ntelecommunications services to Resolute Partners, LLC (“Resolute”).               AAFES, a\nnonappropriated fund instrumentality of the United States Government (“NAFI”), provides\nmerchandise and services to active duty and reserve military members and their families.\nAAFES’ earnings support the Army’s Family Morale Welfare and Recreation Command\n(“FMWRC”) programs. CCS brings this bid protest invoking this Court’s general contract\njurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a), claiming that Defendant breached its implied duty to fairly\nconsider CCS’ proposal. This matter comes before this Court on CCS’ motion for summary\njudgment and Defendant’s and Intervenor’s motions for judgment on the Administrative Record\n(“AR”). CCS seeks its proposal preparation costs and an order remanding the procurement to\nAAFES.\n\n        CCS presents five grounds of protest. First, CCS claims that the Army Recreation\nMachine Program (“ARMP”), a subsidiary of FMWRC, acted as subcontractor to the awardee,\nResolute, in violation of 10 U.S.C. § 2492a. This statute prohibits Department of Defense\n(“DoD”) entities from offering or providing telecommunications services to consumers for a fee\nand from competing for contracts to provide such services. Second, CCS claims that FMWRC’s\nrole in the procurement created an organizational conflict of interest (“OCI”) because FMWRC\nshaped the solicitation and participated in the source selection process, and because FMWRC’s\nsubsidiary, ARMP, competed in the procurement as a subcontractor to the awardee. Third, CCS\nargues that the technical and price evaluations conducted by AAFES were unreasonable and\ncontrary to the terms of the solicitation. Fourth, CCS contends that AAFES improperly\ndetermined that Resolute was a responsible contractor. Lastly, CCS claims that an appearance of\nimpropriety tainted the competition because Resolute was indebted to AAFES and AAFES\nconsidered this debt in making the award decision.\n\n       The Court denies the protest. CCS waived its statutory violation and OCI claims because\nit knew the grounds for those claims prior to award but failed to timely raise them. The\nevaluation of proposals and responsibility determination were reasonable, and CCS failed to\ndemonstrate that either an OCI or an appearance of impropriety tainted the competitive process.\n\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f                                       Findings of Fact 2\n\nInformation Services Provided on Air Force and Army Installations\n\n        There are two kinds of information services provided on Air Force and Army\ninstallations, Personal Information Services and FMWRC Information Services. See AR 4, 119,\n366. Personal Information Services include “for-fee” internet, telephone, and television services\npaid for by civilian or military personnel for personal use -- for “unofficial services” -- in\nbarracks, housing, and internet cafes. AR 334, 362, 427-28, 1776. Prior to December 2009, both\nAAFES and FMWRC provided “for-fee” internet services on Army and Air Force installations.\nAR 119, 366. AAFES provided the services through contracts with internet service providers\n(“ISP”), while FMWRC utilized a government-owned infrastructure operated by ARMP to\nprovide the services. AR 2, 119, 366. This protest arose after FMWRC and AAFES executed an\nagreement to transfer management, sale, and operation of the for-fee internet services to AAFES.\nAR 4-7.\n\n        The FMWRC Information Services supported “official” business functions where users\ndo not pay a fee, and ARMP provided these free services using the FMWRC Information\nServices network, a telecommunications system of government-owned utilities and infrastructure\n-- the same infrastructure ARMP used to provide Personal Information Services. AR 1, 2, 334,\n427; see AR 119, 366, 8768, 8808, 8822, 8836.\n\nLegislative and Regulatory Changes Regarding the Provision of Personal Information\nServices\n\n        On February 23, 2009, AAFES and FMWRC entered into a Memorandum of\nUnderstanding (“MOU”) to “establish a non-competitive partnership between AAFES and\nFMWRC to provide common levels of personal information services based on best business\npractices and cost benefit analysis that minimizes the cost of services to individual users.” AR\n9158; see AR 9158-62. The MOU stated that the partnership would be “executed” in accordance\nwith implementing instructions that would “describe the detailed responsibilities” of each\npartner. AR 9159.\n\n        On May 11, 2009, Army, AAFES, and DoD officials met with the House Armed Services\nCommittee (“House Committee”) concerning the proposed plan to transfer all Personal\nInformation Services operations and related contracts to AAFES. See AR 10537. In a letter\ndated May 22, 2009, the House Committee approved this plan and provided the following\ndirection:\n\n       The Committee views military resale and nonappropriated fund business activities\n       as government entities that must not compete directly with private sector\n\n\n       2\n         These findings are derived from the AR as supplemented. As explained below, the\nCourt issues findings of fact because it resolves the protest on motions for judgment on the AR,\nnot motions for summary judgment. Findings of fact related to the evaluation and the alleged\norganization conflict of interest are included in the discussion.\n\n\n                                               3\n\f       enterprises capable of providing the desired services. In this regard, the\n       Committee directs that within the Department of Defense, no DoD entity may\n       either provide personal information services using DoD resources, personnel or\n       equipment, or compete for contracts to provide such services when the intent is to\n       charge users to recover cost or to earn profits. This prohibition does not prevent\n       or preclude the use of DoD personnel, resources or equipment to administer and\n       oversee personal information services contracts, nor does it preclude [AAFES]\n       from carrying out the plan to provide personal information services through\n       contractors as approved by the Committee.\n\nAR 10531.\n\n       The final version of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010\nincorporated the House Committee’s directive. See Pub. L. 111-84, § 651, 123 Stat. 2368. Now\ncodified at 10 U.S.C. § 2492a, this legislation became effective on October 28, 2009, and\nprovides:\n\n       (a) Limitation.—(1) Notwithstanding section 2492 of this title, the Secretary of\n       Defense may not authorize a Department of Defense entity to offer or provide\n       personal information services directly to users using Department resources,\n       personnel, or equipment, or compete for contracts to provide such personal\n       information services directly to users, if users will be charged a fee for the\n       personal information services to recover the cost incurred to provide the services\n       or to earn a profit.\n\n       (2) The limitation in paragraph (1) shall not be construed to prohibit or preclude\n       the use of Department resources, personnel, or equipment to administer or\n       facilitate personal information services contracts with private contractors.\n\n                                             ***\n\n       (c) Personal Information Services Defined.—In this section, the term “personal\n       information services” means the provision of Internet, telephone, or television\n       services to consumers.\n\n10 U.S.C. § 2492a (Supp. III 2009).\n\n     On December 24, 2009, FMWRC and AAFES finalized a Memorandum of Agreement\n(“MOA”) implementing the requirements of § 2492a. AR 4-7. The December MOA provided:\n\n       AAFES will be responsible for provisioning for-fee Internet services on Military\n       Installations through a commercial Internet Service Provider (ISP).\n\n       FMWRC will transfer for-fee internet service programs currently operated by\n       ARMP to AAFES on a mutually agreed upon schedule that minimizes disruption\n       to the customer. All transfers must be completed by 31 December 2010.\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f                                              ***\n\n       To the extent that AAFES’ commercial ISP[s] can provide their own\n       infrastructure to maintain connectivity at existing locations they may do so.\n       Otherwise, AAFES’ ISP[s] will have the option of using ARMP provided\n       resources.\n\n                                              ***\n\n       The level of ARMP Internet Services provided to the AAFES ISP will meet or\n       exceed current service levels.\n\n       [FMWRC will] [o]ffer to sell or lease existing Internet assets dedicated to\n       Personal Information Services . . . directly to AAFES’ ISPs at a negotiated value\n       where AAFES’ ISPs intend to use existing assets and/or infrastructure to deliver\n       the Internet services to a location.\n\nAR 5-6. To implement this “transfer of function,” AAFES was to “competitively award and/or\nmodify existing contracts for for-fee Internet services transferred from FMWRC to AAFES.”\nAR 6. The December MOA further stated: “There will be no transfer of Internet assets from\nFMWRC to AAFES as a component of this agreement. FMWRC through [its] ARMP program\nwill offer Internet network services as an option to AAFES’ ISP[s] for a fee.” AR 7.\n\nCCS’ and Resolute’s Bridge Contracts\n\n       As part of the transfer of Personal Information Services from FMWRC to AAFES,\nARMP awarded CCS a bridge contract on May 4, 2010, to use ARMP’s network infrastructure\nand equipment to provide Personal Information Services for consumers at 318 building locations\non military installations. AR 1867-92. CCS’ bridge contract was set to terminate on November\n30, 2011. AR 1868, 1875. The bridge contract provided that ARMP planned to use its network\nto provide bandwidth for personal information services, as it had before the bridge contract. AR\n1869-70.\n\n        On July 10, 2010, ARMP entered into a similar bridge contract with Intervenor Resolute,\nthat covered 243 buildings. See AR 2025-45.\n\nThe Instructions for Personal Information Services Implementation on FMWRC’s Website\n\n        “Implementation Instructions” were issued to “provide a centralized reference document”\nin support of the MOU governing the AAFES/FMWRC “non-competitive partnership” to\nprovide Personal Information Services. AR 330-63. This document, or a substantially similar\nversion, was available on FMWRC’s webpage as early as February 4, 2010, but it was not\nreferenced in the solicitation or directly disseminated to offerors in the procurement process. See\nid.; Def.’s Notice of Compliance ¶¶ 1-2, Nov. 21, 2011; Evard Decl. (“Third Evard Decl.”)\n¶ 5(1), Nov. 18, 2011 (Ex. A to Plaintiff’s Resp. to Nov. 15, 2011 Order); Guertin Decl. ¶ 4,\n\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\fNov. 21, 2011 (Ex. A to Intervenor’s Resp. to Nov. 15, 2011 Order). Nonetheless, Defendant\nincluded these Instructions, some 34 pages, in the AR. AR 330-63.\n\n        The purpose of the Implementing Instructions was to outline the procedures to\nsuccessfully deploy the AAFES/FMWRC partnership and identify the role, oversight, and\nmanagement responsibilities of AAFES to deliver Personal Information Services to service\nmembers. AR 331. Under a heading titled “Staff Planning,” the Implementing Instructions\nstated, “FMWRC will appoint a FMWRC Telecommunications Operations Manager as the\nprimary FMWRC Coordinator of the [Personal Information Services] partnership . . . .” AR 337.\nThe Instructions also stated, “FMWRC will assign one . . . Contracting Officer and one . . .\nBusiness Manager, under operational control of the [AAFES Vice President] . . . .” Id. The\nImplementing Instructions further specified that the business manager would be a voting member\nof the Source Selection Committee panels, participate in the development of new business\nrequirements, and have a role in developing contracting methodology. AR 351-52.\n\n        The Implementing Instructions also defined the role of the contracting officer, who was\nto develop and assist with Personal Information Services contract implementation and execution,\nand lead in the development and fulfillment of acquisition plans, contract requirements,\nsolicitation development, contract negotiations, and award. AR 353-54.\n\nThe Request for Information\n\n        On February 11, 2010, AAFES issued a Request for Information (“RFI”) to prospective\ncontractors to provide for-fee consumer telecommunication services at various military\ninstallations. AR 8. The RFI notified vendors that “ARMP [would be] able to provide AAFES\nselected suppliers” network support, but that “[a]ny agreements with ARMP [would] be\nindependent of contracts with AAFES.” AR 29. The RFI stated that after a solicitation was\nissued, ARMP would host an industry information day where attendees would gain an\nunderstanding of “ARMP provided services” and participate in an open forum to exchange\ninformation. Id.\n\nThe Draft Solicitation\n\n       On April 12, 2010, AAFES issued a draft solicitation for the for-fee ISP procurement.\nAR 118. The draft solicitation offered ARMP as a ‘“turnkey network’ and maintenance provider\nfor those locations where ARMP [had] installed infrastructure” and stated that “[i]f providers\nchoose to use ARMP, then ARMP shall assume the role of a sub-contractor to the prospective\nISP.” AR 119-20. The draft solicitation listed advantages of using the ARMP network solution\nthat were substantially reiterated in the final solicitation. AR 120-21, 367. The draft solicitation\nalso announced Industry Day, characterizing it as a “Site Survey” and an important event for\nprospective offerors. AR 118; see AR 126.\n\nIndustry Day\n\n      On April 28, 2010, AAFES and ARMP held Industry Day at Fort Carson, Colorado. AR\n277. Representatives from CCS including Mr. Tim Evard, CCS’ Executive Vice President,\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fattended Industry Day. AR 328-29, 2108. The Industry Day presentation, also referred to as a\npre-proposal conference, included an introduction to the “Key Procurement/Operations Team,”\nand an overview of ARMP’s services. AR 275-76, 279, 281-82; see AR 290. The record\ncontains the 68 slides used in the Industry Day presentation. AR 256-323.\n\n       As part of the Industry Day presentation, AAFES’ Chief for New Business and another\nAAFES employee showed attendees a slide identifying the “Key Procurement/Operations Team”\nas Cynthia Williams (Contracting Officer, AAFES), Nathanial Wills (Army Contracting\nSpecialist, FMWRC), Mike Kaucher (Chief for New Business, AAFES,) John Temple (Army\nBusiness Manager, FMWRC), David LaPradd (Telecommunications Operations Manager,\nFMWRC), and William Hart (General Manager, ARMP). AR 126, 279.\n\n        Industry Day attendees were informed that ARMP was an “operational element of\n[FMWRC]” that was “[c]reated to develop revenue to fund Morale, Welfare & Recreation\nprograms Army wide.” AR 274. A slide listing frequently asked questions stated that bidders\ncould partner with ARMP, and that ARMP would provide “installation site review coordination\nand service deployment.” AR 321. Another slide informed offerors that ARMP could provide a\nvariety of services: “Internet Gateway & LAN Services; Internet Access Device leasing,\nmanagement, and support; Service Leasing; Hardware Support; Security Services and Support;\nSystems Maintenance, Troubleshooting, and Support; Onsite Technical Service; Recreational\nMachine leasing, and Support; [and] Remote Technical Support.” AR 275. An additional slide\nindicated that ARMP “operated” in the Continental United States at “[m]ost major garrisons”\nwith “[p]lans to reach all garrisons in coming years.” AR 276.\n\n       A slide titled “Key Telecommunications Agreements/Policies” identified the February\n2009 Memorandum of Understanding, the December 2009 Memorandum of Agreement and an\nApril 2010 Army policy letter that provided guidance regarding the transition of the Army’s for-\nfee Personal Information Services to AAFES. AR 282; see AR 362-63. These three documents\nwere available on FMWRC’s website. Def.’s Notice of Compliance ¶ 2. The Industry Day slide\npresentation did not reference the Implementing Instructions. See AR 256-323. 3\n\nThe Solicitation\n\n        On May 12, 2010, AAFES issued solicitation number RFP ATI-09-010-10-014. AR 364-\n    4\n463. The purpose of the solicitation was to obtain “pre-paid,” “for-fee” internet services, with\nan option for voice, video, and “post-paid” internet, at 79 Army and Air Force installations in\nfive geographic locations in the United States. AR 376, 410-417. The solicitation contemplated\na five-year base period, with five one-year option periods. AR 376. Provision of services at\nother military bases within a geographic group was optional. Id. The solicitation further notified\n\n\n\n        3\n         On April 30, 2010, the contracting officer emailed Industry Day attendees a copy of the\n“presentations briefed at Industry Day.” AR 10468-69.\n        4\n       The solicitation was largely the same as the draft solicitation issued the prior month.\nCompare AR 119-231 with AR 366-463.\n\n\n                                                7\n\fofferors that service requirements could be expanded to military bases not listed in the\nsolicitation. AR 376, 378.\n\n       The solicitation expressly addressed ARMP’s role as a potential subcontractor. The\nExecutive Summary stated:\n\n      e. ARMP as a Potential Internet Sub-Contractor\n\n      1) ARMP has offered a “turnkey” network and maintenance provider agreement\n      for those Installations where ARMP infrastructure exists or is planned. At those\n      Installations, commercial ISPs will have an option of leasing the ARMP network\n      and equipment at a negotiated price, or [of providing] the necessary network and\n      equipment separately. If providers choose to utilize the ARMP network, then\n      ARMP shall assume the role of sub-contractor to the prospective ISP. The ISP’s\n      agreement with ARMP will be a separate contract from the contract with AAFES.\n\nAR 366-67 (emphasis omitted). Under the same paragraph, the solicitation listed “[s]ome\nadvantages of using the ARMP network and equipment:”\n\n      i.     The existing bandwidth, infrastructure and network components are\n             already in place which may prevent any break in current service and will\n             facilitate faster speed to market.\n\n      ii.    Turnkey operation for the new provider.\n\n      iii.   Maintenance, support, and installation of new equipment and upgrades as\n             necessary . . . .\n\n      iv.    Ability to continue to support customers without a break in service during\n             the transition period from ARMP to the competitively selected AAFES\n             ISP.\n\n      v.     Efficiency and economy which ARMP currently utilizes with [its]\n             installed infrastructure to support FMWRC mission related services.\n\n                                                 ***\n\n      vi.    ARMP has the capability to coordinate between the Installation\n             Management Command (INCOM) proponent activities on Army\n             Garrisons and the AAFES ISP to ensure proper implementation and has\n             the flexibility to adjust network configurations to accommodate growth\n             and mission changes.\n\n      vii.   ARMP provides Internet network access to a commercial carrier and\n             bandwidth provisioned to selected Installations through access points\n\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\f\f        After each voting member of the Source Selection Committee scored the proposals, the\nCommittee would meet for discussion, with the goal of coming to a consensus on the evaluations\nand preparing a written report to summarize the results and rank the proposals. AR 7935, 7942-\n43. The report was to discuss the basis for the Source Selection Committee’s ranking in\nsufficient detail to support the Committee’s recommendation. AR 7935, 7943. Exchange\nOperating Procedure 65-13 provided that the Source Selection Committee report would\n“summarize[] the strengths, weaknesses, and risks of each proposal.” AR 7935. All original\nindividual scoring sheets were required to be attached to the report. AR 7943.\n\n        In addition to a technical evaluation, the solicitation stated that AAFES would review the\nofferors’ fee proposals for the projected financial benefit to AAFES, and explained that “[a]s the\ntechnical rankings [became] closer, the Fees to AAFES [would] become more important.” AR\n453, 455. Under the solicitation, the fees for internet, voice, and video services were to be\nweighted as follows:\n\n           a. Initial Contract Ordering Period Fees          - will be multiplied by 2\n           b. Contract Option Periods 1-5 Fees               - will be multiplied by 1\n\nAR 455. For purposes of evaluation, the voice and video services fees would not be combined\nwith internet service fees. Id. The purpose behind these weights was “to ensure that AAFES . . .\nreceived a balanced proposal and obtained a reasonable fee proposal for ‘firm’ periods (years 1-\n5) versus the uncertain Contract Option Periods.” AR 1512 (emphasis in original). Each offeror\nwas to submit a single fee percentage for each military installation and each service being\nproposed within a geographic group, accounting for every installation within the geographic\nlocation being proposed. AR 458. As part of these fee proposals, offerors were required to\nprovide pro forma Operating Statements, containing projections for internet service in each\ngeographic group being proposed. Id.\n\n        Offerors were also required to submit past performance references. AR 456, 458. The\nsolicitation required each offeror to “provide descriptions of three (3) to five (5) operations in\nuse during the past five (5) years of similar type and size of the project, as described within this\nsolicitation.” AR 458.\n\n         On June 14, 2010, AAFES amended the solicitation by, inter alia, adding an internet\nservices pro forma Operating Statement form and delineating the type of information to be\nincluded in that Statement. AR 882, 908 (Tab 12). Offerors were required to provide financial\ninformation in eight categories: investment outlays, sales, gross operating income, operating\nexpenses, total operating expenses, operating earnings before interest and taxes, pre-tax income,\nand net income. AR 908 (Tab 12). The pro forma Operating Statements were to cover only the\nfirst five-year contract period, even though offerors were required to provide fee data for a 10-\nyear period, and were to be evaluated based on a 10-year period. Id.; see AR 407. The\nAmendment also extended the due date for the submission of proposals until June 23, 2010. AR\n882 (Tab 12).\n\n\n\n\n                                                10\n\fCCS’ Pre-Proposal Communications with AAFES\n\n         In March 2010, CCS emailed AAFES objecting to build-out activities at Fort Bliss, a\nlocation where CCS was providing services under its bridge contract, claiming ARMP’s\nactivities violated 10 U.S.C. § 2492a. AR 2515-16; see AR 279, 1887. This statute prohibited\nDoD entities from offering or providing Personal Information Services to consumers using DoD\nresources, personnel, or equipment or competing to provide Personal Information Services for a\nfee. CCS stated:\n\n       [W]e are becoming increasingly concerned that ARMP has every intention of not\n       only staying in the WIFI business, but monopolizing it per their previous effort, in\n       what appears to be blatant disregard of [C]ongress’ wishes.\n\n       We had previously informed you that we would take Fort Bliss and give\n       consideration to the ARMP “services” where [it] had deployed infrastructure. We\n       presumed, based on our conversations, that [ARMP] would not continue to invest\n       tax dollars in adding infrastructure since we are willing to provide the internet\n       services[.]\n\n       However, [ARMP] continue[s] to add or attempt to add to [its] network . . .\n       despite our stated willingness and ability to provide service.\n\nId.\n\n       AAFES replied:\n\n       We are not privy to all of [ARMP’s] plans and negotiations between you as it\n       relates to the optional infrastructure use. However, we are aware and do\n       understand ARMP has a command commitment to complete build-out work at\n       Bliss--and other locations--and that you both were in discussions on how that\n       could be accomplished at Bliss.\n\n       The legislative guidance is clear on how [Personal Information] services will be\n       provided and FMWRC has made a commitment to that.\n\nAR 2515. In a response sent to both AAFES and FMWRC, CCS stated: “All due respect to\nARMP and [its] ‘commitments.’ The Congress and the Law is clear. What part of this is not\nunderstandable? Congress . . . has said stop doing this and it is continuing.” AR 2514; see AR\n107, 279, 8150.\n\n       In May 2010, CCS submitted questions to the contracting officer regarding ARMP’s\nplanned role in the procurement. AR 2943. CCS stated:\n\n       [ARMP’s] role is a little confusing and the scope of [its] support is not clear. Will\n       [it] only be able to provide support services where [it has] deployed [Personal\n       Information Services] already? Will [it] be able to provide those services where [it\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\f       deploys FMWRC Information Services] going forward (over [its FMWRC\n       Information Services] network)? Is there any certainty around where and on what\n       time schedule [it] will be able to provide services going forward? If [ARMP’s]\n       business model is to receive a percentage of revenue, in exchange for providing\n       infrastructure and capital investment, [is ARMP] in a position to deploy “risk”\n       capital for the winning bidder(s)?\n\nId. The contracting officer responded:\n\n       a) ARMP is not limited to deploy [Personal Information Services] to provide\n       support. The deployment of ARMP’s official service support network [FMWRC\n       Information Services] is independent from the for fee services that AAFES will\n       offer.\n\n       b) ARMP would need to confirm [its] capability outside the Army sphere and\n       [FMWRC Information Systems] network. As the [FMWRC Information\n       Services] network expands, the capability to support providers will also expand;\n       although, separate agreements and [service-level agreements] are required with\n       ARMP to consider future expansion.\n\n       c) This will be handled on a case by case basis directly with ARMP and included\n       in the [service-level agreement]. It is [AAFES’] understanding that ARMP will\n       work collaboratively with the vendors.\n\n       d) This will be handled on a case by case basis directly negotiated with ARMP.\n       Under the ARMP proposal, [its] risk is the same as the vendor[’s], since the\n       reimbursement to ARMP is based upon revenue and there is a fixed cost for\n       ARMP to install and maintain the network.\n\nId.\n\nOfferors’ Knowledge of the Implementing Instructions\n\n        On February 4, 2010, Resolute’s Vice President of Marketing, Paul Guertin, found the\nPersonal Information Services Implementing Instructions “during [a] web-based search,” and\nforwarded them to other Resolute executives. Guertin Decl. ¶¶ 3, 4. The Implementing\nInstructions focused on the newly formed partnership between AAFES and FMWRC and its\neffort to create an integrated strategy to manage Personal Information Services. Id. at Ex. B\n(Version 3.6, Jan. 21, 2010 Implementing Instructions); see also AR 333-34 (Version 3.9, May\n10, 2010 Implementing Instructions). The annexes to the Jan. 21, 2010 Implementing\nInstructions Mr. Guertin located online included: (1) the 2009 February MOU between AAFES\nand FMWRC on Personal Information Services, (2) an explanation of the roles and\nresponsibilities of FMWRC-appointed telecommunications operations manager and FMWRC-\nassigned business manager and contracting officer, and (3) a sample statement of work for\nPersonal Information Services. Guertin Decl. 21-32. The annexes to the May 10, 2010 version\nof the Implementing Instructions also included the 2009 December MOA between FMWRC and\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\fAAFES and the April 6, 2010 memorandum from the Army’s Assistant Chief of Staff for\nInstallation Management to all Army bases regarding Personal Information Services. AR 358-\n63. On March 3, 2010, Mr. Guertin again accessed the Implementing Instructions and forwarded\nthem to two Resolute executives. Guertin Decl. ¶ 5.\n\n       Mr. Evard, Executive Vice President of CCS, testified in a declaration that CCS did not\nobtain the Implementing Instructions prior to June 18, 2010, and that he personally became\naware of the Implementing Instructions on October 14, 2010, after proposals were submitted,\n“while performing research on a matter unrelated to this litigation.” Third Evard Decl. ¶¶ 5(1),\n(3). Mr. Evard “did not review the document in detail, and did not review the Annexes at all,\nuntil mid-December when [CCS was] preparing the Complaint in this action.” Id.\n\nThe Proposals\n\n        AAFES received six proposals. AR 1501. 5 CCS proposed to use ARMP for some of its\nexisting infrastructure needs, stating it had “plans and the necessary partnerships, including\nARMP, in place to roll services out to all locations by June 30, 2011.” AR 713 (Tab 13)\n(emphasis omitted). The proposal indicated that CCS would self-deploy many of the networks\nand infrastructure but that ARMP would be a “deployment partner” at 18 mandatory bases. AR\n830-834 (Tab 13). In its proposal, CCS stated it chose to limit ARMP’s role because of concerns\nover the availability of ARMP’s infrastructure. AR 804 (Tab 13).\n\n       CCS proposed a [ * * * ] AAFES commission for internet services at four of the five\ngeographic locations -- except for the Alaska region. AR 843-49 (Tab 13). According to CCS’\npro forma Operating Statements, CCS projected [ * * * * * ] in combined internet sales from the\nWestern, Hawaii, Central, and Eastern regions, giving AAFES an estimated commission of [ * *\n* * * * ] for the five-year period. AR 857 (Tab 13); see AR 858-63 (Tab 13). CCS’ pro forma\nOperating Statements did not provide its estimated penetration rate, i.e., the estimated percentage\nof the base population that would pay for hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly internet service\nplans. AR 857 (Tab 13); see AR 858-63 (Tab 13).\n\n        Resolute also submitted a timely proposal for all geographic regions. See AR 464-709\n(Tab 14). Resolute divided the mandatory military bases into three groups: Group A -- locations\nwith an existing and operational ARMP network without a service provider, Group B -- locations\nwith an existing but nonoperational ARMP infrastructure without a service provider, and Group\nC -- locations with an existing provider with contracts expiring in 2011. AR 535-42 (Tab 14).\nFor Group A locations, Resolute proposed partnering with ARMP to transition existing services\nto Resolute. AR 535 (Tab 14). At Group B locations, Resolute planned to partner with ARMP\nto make services operational on ARMP’s existing infrastructure. AR 538 (Tab 14). For Group C\nlocations, Resolute would partner with ARMP when available. AR 540-42 (Tab 14). Resolute\ndid not expressly reference a “subcontract” with ARMP, but called its relationship with ARMP a\n\n\n\n\n       5\n         The record only contains the proposals of Resolute, CCS, and NetNearU. AR 464-881\n(Tabs 13-14), 909-1010 (Tab 15).\n\n\n                                                13\n\fpartnership and referred to ARMP as its “preferred vendor.” AR 466-67, 535, 538, 540, 619,\n662, 664 (Tab 14).\n\n        Regarding fees, Resolute assumed an average monthly penetration rate of [ * * * * ] in\n2011 on fully built-out mandatory bases, but applied a [ * ] discount to its estimated penetration\nrates to account for competition from existing franchises (in locations with provider contracts\nexpiring in 2011). AR 686-87 (Tab 14); see AR 540-42 (Tab 14). Resolute’s pro forma\nOperating Statements reflected [ * * * * * ] commission [ * * * * ] for AAFES, an [ * * * * * * *\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ]. AR 687 (Tab 14). Resolute projected\ninternet sales of [ * * * * * * ] for all geographic regions [ * * * * * * * * * * * ]. AR 688 (Tab\n14). This translated into commissions [ * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ]. AR 688-89 (Tab 14); see AR 687 (Tab 14).\n\nThe Technical Evaluation\n\n        The Source Selection Committee was comprised of five voting individuals, and each\nmember used individual score sheets when conducting the technical evaluations. AR 1248-1499,\n1519; see 7935, 7141. While all voting members of the Committee provided comments\njustifying their scores, not all used the prescribed comment codes -- significant strength, strength,\nsignificant weakness, weakness, clarification, and risk. AR 1248-1499. For example, when\nscoring CCS for past performance, one evaluator wrote: “10+ years in internet business, worked\n[with] [ * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ], has\nexperience working on a military base.” AR 1271. Individual evaluation scores were then\nmodified based on the Source Selection Committee’s consensus discussion. AR 1248-1499.\nThese modifications were made either directly on score sheets, or were reflected as differences\nbetween the numerical scores listed on individual score sheets and the final Source Selection\nCommittee Spreadsheet reflecting the consensus numbers. See, e.g., AR 1270-73 (an evaluation\nteam member’s score sheets for CCS, noting changes in factor scores made after the discussion);\nAR 1328-33 (an evaluation team member’s score sheets for CCS highlighting several large point\nincreases from the original scores).\n\n        Below is a summary of the changes between the initial individual scores and the Source\nSelection Committee consensus

AR 687, 709.1 (Tab 14).\n\n       The contracting officer, with assistance from AAFES financial technical expert, Otis\nWright, prepared the Fee Evaluation Report. AR 1512; see 107, 1500. The projected benefit\nfrom CCS’ and Resolute’s price proposals was calculated using the following equation:\n\n       Base Population x Price x Fee x Penetration Rate = Projected Income to AAFES\n\nAR 1512. While this equation was not shared with offerors, the solicitation included the base\npopulation for each mandatory military base. AR 410-16; see First Jackson Decl. ¶ 97. The total\nbase population for all groups except Alaska was 365,822. AR 410-16. Including Alaska, the\ntotal base population was 390,274.

AR 5876, 5879.\nAAFES’ independent consultant, Deloitte LLP, calculated standard penetration rates for these\nservices based on FMWRC’s historical usage rates in the Continental United States. Id. The\nrates used were 1.8% for pre-paid hourly service, 1.1% for pre-paid daily service, 0.8% for pre-\npaid weekly service, and 2.9% for pre-paid monthly service. AR 5879. AAFES’ stated purpose\nin using these penetration rates was to create a “level playing field,” as these rates were\nuniformly applied to all proposals. AR 5880.\n\n       For contract years one through five, CCS and Resolute were evaluated as follows:\n\n                Resolute:     [ * * * * * * * ] estimated total income to AAFES\n                              (or [ * * * * * * * * ] per year)\n\n                CCS:          [ * * * * * * * ] estimated total income to AAFES\n                              (or [ * * * * * * * * ] per year)\n\nAR 1517. With Alaska factored out to create an even comparison, Resolute would have\nprovided to AAFES an estimated [ * * * * * * * * ] for contract years one through five, or\n[ * * * * * * ] annually. Id.\n\n        Overall, the contracting officer found that Resolute offered the “[m]ost attractive Internet\nfee proposal for all regions.” AR 1514. Resolute provided the highest fee percentage per region\nfor all contract years, as well as the highest projected income to AAFES per region for the full\n10-year period. Id. CCS’ fee proposal was ranked [ * * * * * * * * * ] for all regions excluding\nAlaska. Id. Assuming performance for the entire 10-year period and weighting the first five\nyears twice as heavily as the last five, the contracting officer determined that CCS would provide\n[ * * * * * * * ] in fees to AAFES, whereas Resolute would provide [ * * * * * * ] in fees to\nAAFES factoring out Alaska.

AR 1550-55. The Source\nSelection Authority determined that Resolute offered the “best overall value for AAFES across\nall regions . . . .” AR 1555. The award determination was contingent upon the contracting\nofficer’s pending responsibility determination. AR 1555. The Source Selection Authority\nacknowledged a concern over Resolute’s indebtedness to AAFES, but noted that Resolute was\nmaking monthly payments to cure deficiencies. AR 1552. As of February 17, 2010, Resolute\nowed AAFES [ * * * * * * ] in outstanding fee payments and late charges for sales from October\nto December 2009. AR 10529.

AR 8540-41. The bank responded:\n\n       Resolute is already stable and is performing per its agreed loan terms with [ * * *\n       * * * ]. A long-term structure will be finalized in a maximum of 60 days, subject\n       to the final details received on its various existing contracts and several other\n       outstanding RFP awards that are anticipated very soon. Resolute’s loan balances\n       are in [ * * * * * * * * * * * ] . . . .\n\n                                                ***\n\n       [ * * * * * ] will continue to support Resolute and feels very comfortable with\n       Resolute’s ability to perform on their various contracts. In fact, their performance\n       will only be enhanced with the awarding of this RFP.\n\nAR 8540 (emphasis omitted).\n\n       Mr. Wright recommended that AAFES proceed with an award to Resolute based on\nseveral factors. AR 1220. First, he found Resolute would see an increase in sales due to the\n\n\n\n                                                 22\n\faward of the contract. Id. He noted that in 2009, Resolute had [ * * * * * ] in sales, considering\nthe sales from Resolute’s current locations and projected sales from locations in Resolute’s offer.\nAR 1220, 1223. He estimated sales for each year of the initial five-year contract period as\n[ * * * * * * ] for 2011, [ * * * * * * ] for 2012, [ * * * * * * ] for 2013, [ * * * * * * ] for 2014,\nand [ * * * * * * ] for 2015. AR 1223. Mr. Wright’s forecast indicated that once Resolute began\nfull operation under the contract, its net income would increase by [ * * * ] between 2011 and\n2012, and estimated that Resolute could be debt free by 2014. AR 1220.\n\n       Second, Mr. Wright remarked that AAFES’ fee commission payments could be booked\nas “Cost of Sales,” such that the payment would be paid against revenue before other operating\nexpenses were paid. Id.\n\n        Third, Mr. Wright considered Resolute’s “Book Value,” and calculated that an award to\nResolute would improve its net present value from [ * * * * * * ] in 2010, to [ * * * * * * ]\nthrough 2015, because of its ability to generate sales and net income. AR 1221. Mr. Wright\nfound that the rate of return from Resolute’s operation under the contract would exceed its cost\nof capital, thereby increasing its net present value, and that Resolute’s strengthened financial\nposition would attract additional capital. Id.\n\n       Fourth, Mr. Wright considered that Resolute would “need [ * * * * * * * ] over the first\ntwo years of the contract period for continuing operations and contract execution,” and that it\nwas likely that [ * * * * * * ] would “provide as much funding as needed to execute the contract\nrequirements,” given the bank’s vested interest in Resolute’s continued success. AR 1221-22.\nMr. Wright noted that Resolute had previously raised [ * * * * * * ] and estimated that by 2014,\nfunds internally generated would be [ * * * * * ], exceeding the projected funding needs. AR\n1222.\n\nThe Responsibility Determination\n\n        On November 8, 2010, the contracting officer completed her Determination of\nResponsibility. AR 1753-59. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”) does not apply to\nAAFES. AR 381. According to governing AAFES policy, Exchange Service Purchasing\nPolicies (ESR Policy) 65-1, a responsible prospective contractor must meet seven minimum\nstandards. AR 8020 (ESR Policy 65-1 ¶ 4-46(c)). At issue in this case are two standards -- that\na prospective contractor must (1) have adequate financial resources, or the ability to obtain such\nresources, as required during performance, and (2) have a record of satisfactory performance “or\nbe able to document beyond reasonable doubt that any prior problems that created a marginal or\nunsatisfactory situation have been eliminated.” Id. 9\n\n\n\n\n       9\n          These AAFES standards are similar to FAR requirements. The first standard parallels\nFAR 9.104-1(a) (requiring that the offeror “[h]ave adequate financial resources to perform the\ncontract, or the ability to obtain them”) and the second is similar to 9.104-1(c) (requiring that the\nofferor “[h]ave a satisfactory performance record”).\n\n\n                                                  23\n\fFinancial Resources\n\n       In analyzing the adequacy of Resolute’s financial resources, “or [the] ability to obtain\nsuch resources, as required during performance of the contract,” the contracting officer noted in\nher Determination of Responsibility:\n\n       1.      A clear history;\n       2.      Secured financing;\n       3.      No serious red flags of financial risk of non-payment; and\n       4.      [Dun & Bradstreet] payment performance history:\n               a. 12-Month [Dun & Bradstreet] PAYDEX Score averages 70 which\n                  mean payment to suppliers average 15 days beyond terms;\n               b. [3-Month Dun & Bradstreet] PAYDEX Score averages 76 which mean\n                  payments to suppliers average 6 days beyond terms; and\n               c. A credit appraisal rating of [“3=Fair.”] These ratings indicate timely\n                  payments that average 15 days beyond terms.\n\nAR 1754-55.\n\n        With respect to bank references, the contracting officer found that Resolute’s overall\nbank and credit rating were considered satisfactory. AR 1755.

Id.\n\n        With respect to Resolute’s financial projections, the contracting officer, relying on Mr.\nWright’s analysis, determined that Resolute had suffered declining revenues in 2010, but that the\naward of this contract would significantly improve Resolute’s financial outlook. AR 1754-56.\nThe contracting officer accepted Mr. Wright’s Book Value analysis and his finding that the\nintegration of revenue from the contract award would allow Resolute to achieve a net present\nvalue of [ * * * * * * ] based on projections through the 2015 calendar year. AR 1756.\n\nPast Performance\n\n        As part of Resolute’s responsibility determination, the contracting officer identified two\npast performance issues with Resolute’s 2005 contract with AAFES to provide internet café and\nother internet access at various locations in Kuwait, Germany, and the Continental United States.\nAR 1757. The first was a warning letter from AAFES for a service disruption dated October 16,\n2009, at a European military base. AR 1757, 8497-98. The contracting officer stated: “The\nissue was resolved in a timely manner by the contractor and service was restored the same day.”\nAR 1757. The second issue was “a cure demand,” issued by AAFES on January 13, 2010, for\nthe nonpayment of $199,740 in fees under the 2005 contract. AR 1757-58. The contracting\n\n\n\n                                               24\n\fofficer found that Resolute was taking corrective action to cure this debt. AR 1758. AAFES and\nResolute entered into a debt repayment plan for 12 monthly payments of [ * * * ] effective June\n1, 2010, so that by the time of the responsibility determination on November 8, 2010, the\noutstanding debt had been reduced from $[ * * * ] to $[ * * * ]. Id. In spite of this debt to\nAAFES, Resolute’s 2005 contract had been extended for an additional year for all Continental\nUnited States locations, and for three years for all locations outside the Continental United\nStates. Id. The contracting officer stated, “To date, [Resolute] continues to provide satisfactory\nperformance and submit payments by the required due date.” Id. Ultimately, on November 8,\n2010, the contracting officer determined that Resolute was responsible and the Source Selection\nAuthority concurred with this determination. AR 1759.\n\nThe Notice of Award and Debriefing\n\n         On November 9, 2010, AAFES notified CCS of the award to Resolute, and conducted\nCCS’ oral debriefing on December 1, 2010. AR 1760; see AR 1762. During the debriefing,\nAAFES indicated that FMWRC had been represented on the Source Selection Committee and\nthat its “personnel [had] participated with AAFES in developing the requirements for this Best-\nValue effort,” and that while ARMP was not represented on the Source Selection Committee,\n“ARMP personnel [had] participated with AAFES in developing the requirements for this Best-\nValue effort.” AR 1774. AAFES also notified CCS that the pro forma Operating Statements\nwere used as part of the financial analysis to assist in the technical and fee evaluations.

Plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment, while Defendant and\nIntervenor filed motions for Judgment on the Administrative Record. 10 CCS points out that no\n\n\n\n       10\n          Defendant and Intervenor also filed motions to dismiss claiming that CCS lacked the\nfinancial ability to perform the contract and thus lacked standing as an interested party. The\nrecord indicates that CCS has standing. See AR 1521 (Source Selection Committee Report\n\n\n                                                 26\n\frule requires that all bid protests, including those brought under 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a), be resolved\non motions for judgment on the AR. Pl.’s Supplemental Br. 3. Defendant and Resolute contend\nthat the case is appropriately resolved via motions for judgment on the administrative record\nbecause bid protests brought under Section 1491(a) -- while predicated on breach of the implied\nduty of fair dealing -- are not a different species of protest than those brought under § 1491(b)\nand therefore should not require a different process. The Federal Circuit has not yet addressed\nthis procedural issue. See Creation Upgrades, Inc. v. United States, 417 F. App’x 957, 959 (Fed.\nCir. 2011) (“Since our decision in Resource Conservation, we have not decided whether bid\nprotest cases brought under § 1491(a)(1) of the Tucker Act are to be decided on the\nadministrative record, and we see no need to decide that question in this case.”).\n\n       Plaintiff’s chosen procedure, summary judgment, is a “short cut” to resolving a case by\neliminating the need for fact-finding and trial. In ruling on summary judgment motions, the\nCourt does not make findings of fact. Rather, the Court assesses whether any material facts are\ngenuinely in dispute and, if they are not, resolves solely questions of law. If there are genuine\nissues of material fact, the Court must deny motions for summary judgment, and the parties\nproceed to trial.\n\n       In contrast, under the regime of motions for judgment on the AR, governed by Rule 52.1,\nthe Court makes findings of fact based upon the administrative record. As the Federal Circuit\nexplained in Bannum, Inc. v. United States, the trial court must make factual findings “from the\nrecord evidence as if it were conducting a trial on the record.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1355</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1357 (Fed.

In § 1491(a) protests, the Court\nreviews whether the agency’s conduct was arbitrary and capricious.

Under 28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(4), the Court employs the standards set forth in the APA, 5\nU.S.C. § 706, which requires the Court to set aside agency action found to be “arbitrary,\ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”\n\n        In the instant case, a determination of whether the agency’s conduct was arbitrary and\ncapricious can be readily made utilizing the AR. Defendant has filed an ample administrative\nrecord, and Plaintiff has invoked that record, seeking to add declarations from its executive vice\npresident and consultant. In short, all parties rely on facts in the AR in support of their requests\nfor judgment with very limited supplementation. As such, the Court treats Plaintiff’s motion for\nsummary judgment as a motion for judgment on the AR.\n\nThe Scope of the Record and Defendant’s Motion to Strike\n\n       CCS seeks to support its protest with five declarations, three from Timothy Evard,\nExecutive Vice President of CCS, and two from Jimmy J. Jackson, a consultant, and the\nGovernment moves to strike all these declarations. In resolving cross-motions for judgment on\nthe AR, the Court must assess whether CCS has justified its request to supplement the AR.\nAxiom Res. Mgmt., Inc. v. United States, 564 F.3d. 1374, 1378-80 (Fed. Cir. 2009).\n\n       Mr. Evard’s Declarations\n\n        Mr. Evard’s first declaration, filed with CCS’ complaint, addresses: (1) CCS’ past\nperformance in providing information services, (2) the content of the RFP, (3) the content of\nCCS’ proposal, and (4) the substance of meetings not otherwise described in the record. Evard\nDecl. 1-8, Dec. 22, 2010. CCS filed the second Evard Declaration in response to the\nGovernment’s argument that CCS waived its claims that AAFES violated 10 U.S.C. § 2492(a)\nand that ARMP’s and FMWRC’s involvement in this procurement created improper conflicts of\ninterest. In this second declaration, Mr. Evard described CCS’ understanding of ARMP’s role\nand network build-out plans at the time it submitted its proposal. Evard Decl. 1-8, Aug. 22, 2011\n(“Second Evard Decl.”).\n\n       Mr. Evard filed a third declaration in response to a Court order asking the parties whether\nthe Implementing Instructions were available to offerors prior to June 18, 2010, where that\ninformation was made available, and whether CCS had knowledge of this information. 11 Mr.\nEvard answered that this information was not available before June 18, 2010, that he was not\naware when or where it was made available, and that CCS did not have knowledge of this\ninformation before June 18, 2010.\n\n\n\n       11\n           In its response, Defendant stated that the Implementing Instructions were available to\nofferors prior to June 18, 2010, the information was made available online at a FMWRC web\naddress, and that CCS either knew or should have known the information.\n\n\n                                                28\n\f       To resolve the waiver issue, the Court must consider what CCS knew regarding ARMP’s\nrole and when CCS learned it -- matters not in the AR. As such, the Court supplements the\nrecord with the third Evard declaration. Further, the Court supplements the record with\ninformation on CCS’ knowledge of ARMP’s role in the procurement as reflected in Paragraphs\n12 and 13 of Mr. Evard’s first declaration (discussing CCS’ bridge contract and communications\nwith ARMP and AAFES concerning ARMP’s future role) and Paragraphs 1 through 11 of Mr.\nEvard’s second declaration (discussing CCS’ interpretation of the RFP, information presented at\nIndustry Day, and communications with ARMP and AAFES concerning ARMP’s future role).\nThe remainder of these two declarations either restates information in the solicitation and in\nResolute’s and CCS’ proposals or contains Mr. Evard’s personal opinion of Resolute’s proposal.\nMr. Evard’s opinion of Resolute’s proposal is not relevant, and his restatement of material in the\nrecord is unnecessary and duplicative.

His second declaration, filed in\nsupport of CCS’ response to the Government’s motion for judgment on the AR, addresses\nResolute’s financial responsibility and AAFES’ calculation of the technical scores.\n\n       Mr. Jackson opines that:\n\n            •   Resolute did not have adequate financial resources and that “the contracting\n                officer should have concluded that Resolute was not financially responsible.”\n                Jackson Decl. ¶¶ 9, 10, July 18, 2011 (“First Jackson Decl.”); Jackson Decl. ¶¶ 9-\n                11, Aug. 22, 2011 (“Second Jackson Decl.”);\n\n            •   the assumptions in Mr. Wright’s financial models overstated Resolute’s ability to\n                obtain financing, omitted interest-related expenses, inflated Resolute’s sales and\n                revenues, and understated expenses, leading to an erroneous conclusion about\n                Resolute’s financial outlook. First Jackson Decl. ¶¶ 41-67; and\n\n\n\n\n       12\n           Mr. Jackson has evaluated financial and cost analyses in more than 185 bid protests\nand has been accepted as an expert by the Court of Federal Claims and Federal District Courts.\nFirst Jackson Decl. ¶¶ 4(d), 4(g). He has two masters degrees, one in Business Administration\nfrom Southern Illinois University and one in Science in Management from the Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management.

Id. at ¶¶ 90-\n               99.\n\n        Mr. Jackson also analyzes the scoring of the technical evaluation and conducts his own\ncomparative analysis of portions of CCS’ and Resolute’s proposals, assigning different subfactor\nscores. Second Jackson Decl. ¶¶ 3-4. In addition, Mr. Jackson questions the comparison of\nResolute’s and CCS’ proposals claiming AAFES failed to consider that CCS did not include\nAlaska in its proposal, and performs his own analysis acknowledging this circumstance. Id. at\n¶¶ 9-11. Finally, Mr. Jackson critiques the contracting officer’s past performance evaluation\nbecause the agency only used a three-point scale -- Strong, Modest, and Weak -- “without\nhaving a fourth possible score for Unacceptable,” a technique that in his view “masked the high\nrisk of Resolute’s financial performance.” First Jackson Decl. ¶¶ 85, 86.\n\n        As the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit recognized in Axiom\nResource Management, Inc. v. United States, the parties’ ability to supplement the AR in a bid\nprotest is limited, and the “focus of judicial review of agency action remains the administrative\nrecord, which should be supplemented only if the existing record is insufficient to permit\nmeaningful review . . . .” 564 F.3d at 1379-81. It is appropriate to supplement the AR when\n“technical aspects of the procurement process [would] remain unexplained” without\nsupplementation or “when necessary for the Court to understand technical or complex\ninformation involved in the challenged procurement.” Guzar Mirbachakot Transp. v.

There is a\nfine line though between an expert offering technical analysis -- an acceptable addition to the\nrecord -- and an expert substituting his subjective judgment for that of the Government in areas\nnot dependent upon complex technical matters. In the instant case, Mr. Jackson crossed that line.\n\n        Mr. Jackson proffers his opinion on Resolute’s responsibility predicated on his subjective\nevaluation of the record, not on any inscrutable technical matters. See First Jackson Decl. ¶ 12\n(stating it was “irrational” for the contracting officer to find Resolute financially responsible\nwhen it was “cleared for less than[ * * ] percent of the contract amount”); ¶ 17 (claiming the\ncontracting officer should have found Resolute’s Dun & Bradstreet Report to have been based on\noutdated information); ¶ 25 (opining that Resolute’s financial statements support only an\nunfavorable financial responsibility determination); ¶¶ 26-40 (questioning the contracting\nofficer’s interpretation of letters and communications from [ * * * * * ], and speculating that\nResolute was in “default” on its loan); ¶ 72 (stating that Mr. Wright’s financial model provides\n\n\n\n                                                30\n\fno “rational basis” for a favorable responsibility determination).

See First Jackson Decl. ¶ 85 (stating that AAFES’ evaluation criteria for risk\nscoring should have included an “unacceptable” score); see also Second Jackson Decl. ¶¶ 9-12\n(presenting how Mr. Jackson would have calculated the AAFES fee percentages). Expert\nopinions that purport to assess an agency’s procurement decisions are not proper\nsupplementation of the AR. In PlanetSpace Inc. v. United States, the Court rejected declarations\nproffered by the plaintiff because they essentially “attack[ed] the merits of [the agency’s] award\ndecision.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fed. Cl.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 6 (2009). Although the PlanetSpace plaintiff claimed that the\ndeclarations there were a technical aid to explain the pricing differences among proposals, the\nCourt found that the declarations re-argued the merits of the parties’ financing plans and\namounted to a “comparative assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposals . . . .”\nId. at 8. So too, Mr. Jackson questions the correctness of the contracting officer’s and Source\nSelection Committee’s conclusions. Whether or not the contracting officer and Source Selection\nCommittee and Source Selection Authority made “reasonable” decisions on these procurement\nmatters is a determination for this Court and is not a proper subject for expert opinion. Id.\n\n         In Al Ghanim Combined Group Company General Trading & Contracting W.L.L. v.\nUnited States, the Court excluded two declarations by Mr. Jackson in a bid protest. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fed.

In challenging the pricing evaluation, Mr. Jackson opined that the agency had\nfailed to perform a “price realism analysis” that would have revealed that the awardee’s pricing\nwas unrealistic. Id. at 511. The Court excluded Mr. Jackson’s declarations because they did not\n“fill a gap in the record” or provide necessary clarification, stating:\n\n       Even if characterized as expert testimony, Mr. Jackson’s opinions do not aid the\n       court in its analysis of plaintiff’s arguments. Admissible expert testimony, as\n       governed by [FRE] 702, must assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or\n       to determine a fact in issue. Plaintiff’s arguments are devoid of complexities that\n       might require expert assistance, and plaintiff’s counsel is able to explain its\n       arguments fully without the need of expert testimony.\n\nId. at 512 (citations and quotation marks omitted). Here, as in Al Ghanim, because Mr. Jackson\nre-argues the merits of the Government’s award decision, his declarations are unnecessary for a\nfull and complete understanding of the issues in the protest.\n\nWaiver Under Blue & Gold in § 1491(a)(1) Protests\n\n        Defendant and Intervenor, relying on Blue & Gold Fleet, L.P. v.

Cir. 2007), seek dismissal of Counts I and II on the ground that CCS knew the\nbasis for these claims prior to the conclusion of the bidding process, but did not raise them until\nafter award. In Count I, CCS claims that Defendant violated 10 U.S.C. § 2492a by allowing\nARMP to either (i) compete for a contract to provide Personal Information Services directly to\n\n\n\n                                                31\n\ffee-paying users, or (ii) itself provide Personal Information Services directly to fee-paying users.\nIn Count II, CCS claims that ARMP’s role as a subcontractor and FMWRC’s participation on the\nSource Selection Committee and its involvement, along with ARMP’s, in shaping the\nsolicitation, constituted organizational conflicts of interest.\n\n       Is the Blue & Gold Waiver Doctrine Limited to § 1491(b) Protests?\n\n        In Blue & Gold, the Federal Circuit held “that a party who has the opportunity to object\nto the terms of a government solicitation containing a patent error and fails to do so prior to the\nclose of the bidding process waives its ability to raise the same objection subsequently in a bid\nprotest action in the Court of Federal Claims.” Id. at 1313. CCS argues that as a matter of law,\nthe Blue & Gold waiver doctrine only applies to bid protests brought under 28 U.S.C. § 1491(b),\nnot to protests invoking § 1491(a) jurisdiction, emphasizing the following language in Blue &\nGold:\n\n       [A] party who has the opportunity to object to the terms of a government\n       solicitation containing a patent error and fails to do so prior to the close of the\n       bidding process waives its ability to raise the same objection afterwards in a\n       § 1491(b) action in the Court of Federal Claims.\n\n                                               ***\n\n       Having recognized a waiver rule in § 1491(b) bid protest actions, we must decide\n       whether the Court of Federal Claims erred in applying it to this case.\n\nId. at 1315 (emphasis added).\n\n        While Blue & Gold itself concerned a § 1491(b) bid protest, there is nothing in the\ndecision that limits the waiver rule to bid protests predicated on § 1491(b) jurisdiction. What\ndrives the waiver rule is the pragmatic recognition that a bidder must object to the terms of a\npatently erroneous solicitation while the Government can still remedy the situation. Id. at 1314-\n15. The patent ambiguity doctrine as articulated in Blue & Gold is equally applicable in any bid\nprotest whether brought under § 1491(a) or (b). As the Federal Circuit explained:\n\n       [The patent ambiguity] doctrine “was established to prevent contractors from\n       taking advantage of the government, protect other bidders by assuring that all\n       bidders bid on the same specifications, and materially aid the administration of\n       government contracts by requiring that ambiguities be raised before the contract is\n       bid, thus avoiding costly litigation after the fact.” These reasons . . . apply with\n       equal force in the bid protest context. In the absence of a waiver rule, a contractor\n       with knowledge of a solicitation defect could choose to stay silent when\n       submitting its first proposal. If its first proposal loses to another bidder, the\n       contractor could then come forward with the defect to restart the bidding process,\n       perhaps with increased knowledge of its competitors.\n\n\n\n\n                                                32\n\fId. at 1313-1314 (quoting Cmty.

To hold otherwise would permit bidders in § 1491(a) protests to do exactly\nwhat the Blue & Gold Court prohibited -- to roll the dice and wait to protest if they do not win.\nAs the Federal Circuit explained:\n\n       It would be inefficient and costly to authorize this remedy after offerors and the\n       agency had expended considerable time and effort submitting or evaluating\n       proposals in response to a defective solicitation. Vendors cannot sit on their\n       rights to challenge what they believe is an unfair solicitation, roll the dice and see\n       if they receive award [sic] and then, if unsuccessful, claim the solicitation was\n       infirm.\n\nId. at 1314 (alteration in original) (quoting Argencord Mach. & Equip., Inc. v.

Cir. 2012). There, the Court held that the plaintiff waived its right to challenge an\namendment to the solicitation by not protesting before contract award, even though the\namendment was issued after the close of the bidding process. The Federal Circuit expanded Blue\n& Gold by applying its reasoning “to all situations in which the protesting party had the\nopportunity to challenge a solicitation before the award and failed to do so.” COMINT, 700 F.3d\nat 1382. As such, the Federal Circuit extended the time a protestor may file a pre-award protest\nfrom the “close of the bidding process” as articulated in Blue & Gold to any time before award is\nmade. See also Bannum, Inc. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fed. Cl.</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 274 (2014). The Federal\nCircuit recognized that “[t]he same policy underlying Blue & Gold supports it extension to all\npre-award situations.” COMINT, 700 F.3d at 1382.\n\n        CCS contends that the Blue & Gold waiver rule should not apply in § 1491(a) protests\nbecause the implied-in-fact contract giving rise to jurisdiction is not formed unless an offeror\nsubmits a proposal, the very act which causes the waiver under Blue & Gold. Thus, CCS posits\nthat a plaintiff challenging a solicitation under § 1491(a) would have the Hobson’s choice of\neither filing a protest prior to submitting a proposal, thus bypassing the requirement for\nestablishing § 1491(a) jurisdiction, or waiving its ability to protest by submitting a proposal.\nSuch a narrow and draconian view of the § 1491(a) bid protest process is unwarranted.\n\n        CCS’ perceived dilemma was apparently spawned by an overly broad reading of\nMotorola, Inc. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601924\"><a href=\"/opinion/601924/motorola-inc-v-the-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">113</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fed. Cir. 1993). CCS misconstrues Motorola to\nestablish a general principle that submission of a proposal is always required to establish the\nimplied-in-fact contract necessary for § 1491(a) pre-award protest jurisdiction. While the trial\ncourt in Motorola did articulate that principle, the Federal Circuit, using limiting language in its\naffirmance, did not adopt the trial court’s reasoning wholesale. The plaintiff in Motorola filed\n\n\n\n                                                33\n\fsuit challenging a solicitation as being unduly restrictive and precluding it from submitting a bid.\nThe Motorola plaintiff based its assertion of implied contract jurisdiction on the Government’s\nrequests for, and Motorola’s submission of, information to assist the Government in developing\nthe solicitation. Id. at 114-15. In dismissing Motorola’s complaint for failure to state a claim,\nthe trial court concluded that “[s]ince there was no bid here, there was no promise; hence, no\nbasis for finding the existence of a pre-award contract upon which a claim for injunctive relief\ncan be based.” Id. at 116. 13\n\n        In affirming Motorola, while agreeing that no implied contract arose because plaintiff had\nnot submitted a bid, the Federal Circuit added important qualifiers, stating that Motorola had\n“not otherwise met its burden to show that an implied in fact contract existed,” and that\n“[o]rdinarily a bid is required to establish that a pre-award implied in fact contract exists.” Id. at\n114 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). This language underscores the appellate court’s\nrecognition that the submission of a bid is not the sine qua non for establishing an implied-in-fact\ncontract and acknowledges alternatives for “otherwise” establishing the implied-in-fact contract\nnecessary for pre-award protest jurisdiction. Further, the Federal Circuit expressly limited its\nendorsement of the Motorola trial court’s opinion “to the extent consistent with the above”\nreasoning. Id.\n\n        The Federal Circuit’s refusal in Motorola to restrict the manner in which an implied-in-\nfact contract can be formed in the pre-award procurement process setting is consistent with\nfundamental principles of contract formation. As the Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 24\nteaches, “[a]n offer is the manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain, so made as to\njustify another person in understanding that his assent to that bargain is invited and will conclude\nit.” The Government’s manifestation of a willingness to enter a bargain and a vendor’s assent to\nthat bargain need not be exclusively expressed via a formal bid or proposal in the pre-award\ncontext.\n\n        But even if CCS were correct that it had to submit a proposal in order to form an implied-\nin-fact contract giving rise to this Court’s jurisdiction, it could still have preserved its rights.\nCCS could have protested the terms of the solicitation and in the alternative, timely submitted a\nproposal that purported to respond to the allegedly flawed solicitation. In sum, CCS’ effort to\ninsulate § 1491(a) protests from the Blue & Gold waiver rule fails.\n\n\n\n\n       13\n            In so holding, the Motorola trial court departed from the holdings in Standard\nManufacturing Company v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cl.

In Standard Manufacturing, the\ncourt held that a contractor’s response to government requests for information created an implied\ncontract that all responses would be fairly and honestly considered, satisfying the jurisdictional\nprerequisite for a pre-award bid protest under Section 1491(a). 7 Cl. Ct. at 58-60. Similarly, in\nMagnovox, notices of intent to conduct a sole-source procurement published in the Commerce\nBusiness Daily coupled with a contractor’s response that it could perform the work, resulted in\nan implied contract to give the contractor’s response honest and fair consideration. 26 Cl.

Cl. at 273-74.\n\n       CCS Waived Its Claim of a Statutory Violation\n\n       In Count I, CCS claims that the Government violated 10 U.S.C. § 2492a, which provides:\n       (a) Limitation.—(1) Notwithstanding section 2492 of this title, the Secretary of\n       Defense may not authorize a Department of Defense entity to offer or provide\n       personal information services directly to users using Department resources,\n       personnel, or equipment, or compete for contracts to provide such personal\n       information services directly to users, if users will be charged a fee for the\n       personal information services to recover the cost incurred to provide the services\n       or to earn a profit.\n\n       (2) The limitation in paragraph (1) shall not be construed to prohibit or preclude\n       the use of Department resources, personnel, or equipment to administer or\n       facilitate personal information services contracts with private contractors.\n\n10 U.S.C. § 2492a.\n\n        CCS alleges that ARMP was either competing for a contract to provide Personal\nInformation Services or providing these services directly to fee-paying users in violation of\n§ 2492a, by acting as a subcontractor and continuing to build out its own network. However, by\nwaiting to file its protest until after award, CCS waived this ground of protest. The solicitation\nclearly informed offerors that ARMP could be a subcontractor and lease its infrastructure to\nofferors reiterating identical communications conveyed to offerors in the draft solicitation and\nthe Industry Day presentation. In CCS’ case, there was also a pre-solicitation exchange with\nAAFES clarifying ARMP’s role.\n\n        The draft solicitation expressly informed prospective offerors that ARMP could be\nutilized as a subcontractor for “locations where ARMP [had] installed infrastructure,” and that\nofferors would have the “option of leasing the ARMP network and equipment . . . .” AR 119-20.\nFurther, the draft solicitation listed several advantages of utilizing ARMP’s network.\n\n      A few weeks later, the Industry Day briefing made clear that an offeror had the option to\nuse ARMP’s infrastructure in certain locations and to designate ARMP as its subcontractor. See\nAR 275-76. Industry Day attendees, including CCS representatives, were informed that ARMP\nwould provide a variety of services, including “Internet Gateway & LAN Services” and “Internet\nAccess Device leasing.” AR 275. Industry Day attendees also learned that ARMP would\n\n\n\n\n                                                35\n\fprovide these services in the Continental United States at “[m]ost major garrisons” with “[p]lans\nto reach all garrisons in coming years.” AR 276. 14\n\n       Just a few days after Industry Day, on May 3, 2010, CCS sent AAFES an email\nrequesting clarification of ARMP’s role, stating:\n\n       Subject: RFP comments\n       The ARMP role is a little confusing and the scope of [its] support is not clear.\n       Will [it] only be able to provide support services where [it has] deployed\n       [Personal Information Services] already? Will [it] be able to provide those\n       services where [it deploys FMWRC Information Services] going forward (over\n       [its FMWRC Information Services] network)? Is there any certainty around\n       where and on what time schedule [it] will be able to provide services going\n       forward?\n\nAR 2943. The contracting officer responded, stating:\n\n       a) ARMP is not limited to deploy [Personal Information Services] to provide\n       support. The deployment of ARMP’s official service support network [FMWRC\n       network] is independent from the for fee services that AAFES will offer.\n\n       b) ARMP would need to confirm [its] capability outside the Army sphere and\n       [FMWRC] network. As the [FMWRC] network expands, the capability to\n       support providers will also expand; although, separate agreements and [Service-\n       Level Agreements] are required with ARMP to consider future expansion.\n\nId.\n\n        CCS claims that this exchange did not advise it that ARMP could be used for future\nbuild-outs, and that the contracting officer’s answer was “vague” and “border[ed] on evasive.”\nPl.’s Reply & Opp’n 36-37, Aug. 22, 2011. According to CCS, it was not clear that ARMP’s\nsupport included providing infrastructure. Id. at 37. CCS’ interpretation is untenable. CCS\nasked: “Will [ARMP] only be able to provide support services where [it has] deployed [Personal\nInformation Services] already?” AR 2943 (emphasis added). The contracting officer said no,\nstating “ARMP is not limited to deploy [Personal Information Services] to provide support,” and\nadded that ARMP’s expanding FMWRC Information Services network could be utilized via\nseparate agreements. Id.\n\n        A few weeks after this clarification, the Government issued the solicitation, listing the\nbenefits of using ARMP as a subcontractor, and reiterating ARMP’s role and clarifying that the\n\n\n\n       14\n           Mr. Evard, CCS’ Executive Vice President, saw the slide “showing that ARMP had an\naggressive build-out plan,” but assumed that the information on the slide was out of date and\nreflected ARMP’s plans before the December MOA. Second Evard Decl. ¶ 10. CCS’ erroneous\nassumption does not change the fact that ARMP’s role was disclosed during Industry Day.\n\n\n                                               36\n\fARMP network would continue to expand. AR 366-67. In a paragraph titled “ARMP as a\nPotential Internet Sub-Contractor,” the solicitation stated that ARMP could provide both existing\nand “planned” infrastructure. AR 366-67. CCS claims that “planned” referred only to projects\nfor which construction was already under way, but there is no basis in the record for CCS’ gloss.\n\n        In sum, given the language in the draft and final solicitations, the Industry Day\npresentation, and CCS’ exchange with AAFES, CCS knew that ARMP had been providing and\nwould continue to provide network infrastructure and other support services as a subcontractor to\nthe successful offeror -- the predicate for its claim that the Government violated 10 U.S.C.\n§ 2492a. Even though it was aware of this alleged defect in the solicitation, CCS did not protest\nuntil after it failed to receive the award. As such, CCS waived its ability to protest this statutory\nviolation under Blue & Gold.\n\nThe Court Declines to Invoke a Statutory Violation Exception to the Waiver Doctrine\n\n        CCS argues that even if it waived its statutory claim, the Court should not apply Blue &\nGold because a significant statutory violation is at issue. Pl.’s Reply & Opp’n 43. CCS posits\nthat the Blue & Gold waiver rule originated in part from the Government Accountability Office’s\n(“GAO”) timeliness rule. This rule permits GAO to consider an untimely protest “for good\ncause shown, or where it determines that a protest raises issues significant to the procurement\nsystem . . . .” Id. at 44 (quoting 4 C.F.R. § 21.2(c)). As CCS recognizes, GAO’s exception to\nthe timeliness rule applies “only where the untimely issue directly concerns the interpretation or\napplication of the procurement statutes or regulations on a matter of widespread interest to the\nprocurement community.” Id. (citing 4 C.F.R. § 21.2(c) and quoting DePaul Hosp. & The\nCatholic Health Ass’n of the United States, B-227160, 87-2 CPD ¶ 173, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">102790</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4\n(Comp. Gen.

Id. at 45. Even assuming arguendo that CCS is correct that AAFES\nviolated 10 U.S.C. § 2492a in this procurement, applying a statutory violation exception to the\nBlue & Gold waiver rule would not be appropriate. The Blue & Gold waiver rule as extended by\nCOMINT is simple: if there is a patent ambiguity or error in the solicitation, a plaintiff must\nseek redress in court prior to award. In fashioning and reaffirming this judicial waiver rule, the\nFederal Circuit did not adopt GAO’s rule or practice, it applied a judicial doctrine, the patent\nambiguity doctrine, and recognized that it was unfair and inefficient to allow protestors to game\nthe system by waiting to raise problems with a solicitation until after they failed to receive the\naward. As such, this Court declines CCS’ invitation to carve out an exception to the Blue &\nGold waiver rule.\n\n       Even if the Court were to invoke GAO’s rule, GAO’s exception to waiver would not\napply here. As GAO has noted, “In order to prevent the timeliness rules from becoming\nmeaningless, the significant issue exception is strictly construed and seldom used,” and the\nburden is on the untimely protestor to show that its protest is of “widespread interest to the\nprocurement community.” DePaul Hosp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">102790</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4.

Paragraph 1-21 of this policy states:\n\n       Selection of contractors and award of contracts must be made free of any conflict\n       of interest. A conflict of interest exists when the person selecting items for\n       purchase, selecting a contractor, placing an order or awarding a contract has a\n       financial interest in the business of the firm receiving an order or contract, or is in\n       a position to benefit because of a family interest. Contracting officers, their\n       representatives, ordering agents and other AAFES personnel who are authorized\n       to determine requirements, select items, or sign, approve, disapprove or\n       administer contracts (including inspection), are required to disqualify themselves\n       from contract transactions involving an actual or potential conflict of interest.\n\nAR 7980.\n\n      CCS posits that two FMWRC employees, David LaPradd and John Temple, who were on\nthe Source Selection Committee, and a third FMWRC employee, Nate Wills, an Army\n\n\n\n       15\n          Additionally, CCS claims violations of the FAR and Army Regulation 215-4, but these\nregulations do not apply to NAFIs.\n\n\n                                                 38\n\fcontracting specialist on the contracting team, had a financial interest in an award to Resolute,\nbecause Resolute proposed using ARMP as its primary subcontractor and ARMP is an affiliate\nof FMWRC. Specifically, CCS contends:\n\n       ARMP, Resolute’s primary subcontractor, is an affiliate (i.e., a subsidiary\n       organization) of their employer, FMWRC. Thus, at a minimum, these individuals\n       had a “direct or indirect financial interest” or “other beneficial interest” in a\n       “proposed subcontractor” of one of the firms submitting a proposal. Because they\n       were involved in “selecting items for purchase, selecting a contractor, placing an\n       order or awarding a contract” and, through their employer, had a “financial\n       interest in the business of the firm receiving” award, these individuals had an\n       impermissible conflict of interest.\n\nPl.’s Mem. in Support of Mot. Summ. J. (“Pl.’s Mem.”) 17, July 21, 2011 (internal citation\nomitted).\n\n        The Government argues that CCS waived this OCI claim because FMWRC’s\ninvolvement was known to CCS prior to the deadline for submission of proposals, pointing to\nslides from the Industry Day presentation. Resolute likewise argues that CCS waived this claim\nbecause FMWRC/ARMP personnel attended the conference and identified themselves as\nemployees of FMWRC and ARMP, and attendees, including at least four CCS employees, saw a\nslide entitled “Key Procurement/Operations Team” identifying three individuals from FMWRC\nand one from ARMP as team members. Intervenor’s Mem. in Support of Cross Mot. J. 15; see\nAR 279-80, 328-29. 16\n\n        CCS contends that the Industry Day materials did not provide it with sufficient notice of\nARMP’s and FMWRC’s role because the slide did not indicate whether Messrs. LaPradd,\nTemple, and Wills would be on the procurement or operations side. Pl.’s Reply & Opp’n 38.\nCCS’ post-hoc interpretation of this slide is not persuasive. Even if the slide did not detail the\nprecise involvement of the FMWRC employees in the procurement, it put CCS on notice that\nthey would be “key” players, triggering a duty to inquire. As Intervenor argues, “[t]o the extent\n[ARMP’s and FMWRC’s role] was unclear, CCS was obligated to seek clarification of the issue\nand protest if there was any ambiguity.” Intervenor’s Reply 6. On several occasions, CCS\nsought clarification or voiced complaints about other aspects of the procurement, and AAFES\nregularly responded to these inquiries. Even though it was on notice of these individuals’ “key”\nroles in the procurement, CCS did not raise its OCI complaint until after it was denied the award.\nTherefore, CCS waived its ability to protest on these grounds under Blue & Gold.\n\nCCS’ Organizational Conflict of Interest Claim Fails\n\n       Even if CCS had not waived its OCI claim, this claim is unfounded. CCS’ OCI claim is\npredicated on AAFES’ procurement policy, which provides: “A conflict of interest exists when\n\n\n\n       16\n          Neither Defendant nor Intervenor argue that CCS had notice of these employees’ roles\nin the procurement by virtue of the Implementing Instructions.\n\n\n                                               39\n\fthe person selecting items for purchase, selecting a contractor, placing an order or awarding a\ncontract has a financial interest in the business of the firm receiving an order or contract . . .”\nAR 7980. AAFES enforced this aspect of its procurement policy by requiring the Source\nSelection Committee members to complete and submit a Conflict of Interest Statement. AR\n8139. The form stated:\n\n       To the best of my knowledge and belief, no conflict of interest exists that may\n       diminish my capacity to perform an impartial and objective review of the\n       offeror’s proposal, or may otherwise result in a biased opinion or an unfair\n       advantage. . . . In determining whether any potential conflict of interest exists, I\n       agree to review whether my or my employer’s relationships with other persons or\n       entities, including but not limited to, ownership of stocks, bonds, other\n       outstanding financial interests or commitments, employment arrangements (past,\n       present, or under consideration) . . . may place me in a position of conflict, real or\n       apparent, with the evaluation proceedings.\n\nAR 8142. Each member was required to complete the form and return it to the contracting\nofficer. AR 8139.\n\n        However, Messrs. LaPradd, Temple, and Wills submitted a different form, entitled\nCertificate for Personnel Participating in Source Selection Concerning Nondisclosure, Conflicts\nof Interest, and Rules of Conduct. AR 8152 (Mr. LaPradd), 8154 (Mr. Temple), 8157 (Mr.\nWills). That form contained the following statement regarding conflicts of interest:\n\n       To the best of my knowledge, I certify that neither I nor my spouse . . . have any\n       direct or indirect financial interest in any of the firms submitting proposals, or\n       their proposed subcontractors or have any other beneficial interest in such firm\n       except as fully disclosed on an attachment to this certification.\n\nId. (¶ 2). None of these three employees disclosed a beneficial interest on an attachment. Id.\n\n       Plaintiff claims that “[t]he representations made by Messrs. LaPradd, Temple, and Wills\nin such forms are demonstrably and unassailably inaccurate,” based solely on the fact of their\nemployment at FMWRC, their roles on either the Source Selection Committee or the contracting\nteam, ARMP’s status as a potential subcontractor, and FMWRC’s relationship with ARMP.\nPl.’s Mem. 17-18.\n\n        The mere circumstances of these employees’ positions and ARMP’s role do not establish\nthat the FMWRC personnel in question had a financial interest in Resolute. CCS’ OCI claim is\npredicated solely on the fact that ARMP is an affiliate of FMWRC, Messrs. LaPradd, Temple,\nand Wills’ employer. CCS asserts a broad-based speculative contention that these three\nemployees necessarily had a financial interest in ARMP based on this affiliation. In essence,\nCCS would divine a prohibited financial interest on the part of these FMWRC employees “in the\nbusiness of” ARMP and attribute that interest to Resolute. Nothing in the record suggests that\nARMP’s performance under Resolute’s contract could have impacted the compensation of\nMessrs. LaPradd, Temple, and Wills. CCS also ignores the fact that in its own proposal, it\n\n\n\n                                                40\n\fplanned to use ARMP, thus creating the same conflict of interest it alleges. Specifically, CCS’\nproposal stated: “CCS has plans and the necessary partnerships, including ARMP, in place to\nroll services out to all locations . . . .” AR 713 (Tab 13). Of the 74 mandatory bases CCS\nproposed to service with internet, CCS proposed using ARMP as its “deployment partner” at 18\nlocations, and using ARMP infrastructure where available. AR 804, 830-34 (Tab 13).\n\n        In this procurement, contractors were offering to provide Personal Information Services\ndirectly to service members. AAFES was to obtain a commission, but there was no showing that\nsuch commission would inure to the benefit of FMWRC personnel. To demonstrate an\norganizational conflict of interest, a protestor must identify “hard facts” -- a mere inference or\nsuspicion of a conflict is not enough. PAI Corp. v.

Similarly, CCS has not shown that there\nwas a reasonable likelihood it would have received the award if Messrs. LaPradd and Temple\nwere not part of the evaluation team and Mr. Wills was not part of the contracting team. CCS\nhas not claimed that the two FMWRC personnel on the Source Selection Committee evaluated\nCCS or Resolute differently than the other three voting Committee members. In fact, Resolute’s\nscore would have been higher than CCS’ score even if the evaluations of Messrs. LaPradd and\nTemple were removed from the mix. As such, CCS’ claim that an organizational conflict of\ninterest existed in this procurement under AAFES’ procurement policies fails.\n\nAAFES’ Evaluation of Proposals\n\n       CCS claims that AAFES incorrectly evaluated the proposals by failing to use the\nproposal scoring template and by normalizing the penetration rates.\n\n\n\n\n                                                41\n\f       Scoring\n\n        CCS claims that AAFES’ numeric scoring of the offerors’ proposals did not reflect the\nactual strengths and weaknesses assigned by the Source Selection Committee. Specifically, CCS\nargues that the majority of the individual evaluators failed to use the “proposal scoring template”\nwhich provided the following comment codes: SS = significant strength, S = strength, SW =\nsignificant weakness, W = weakness, C = clarification, and R = risk. E.g., AR 1253, 10508.\nOnly one evaluator used the recommended comment codes, while the other evaluators either\nused a plus, minus, and neutral system, or simply provided comments. E.g., AR 1308-13, 1369-\n74, 1486-91 (using the required codes); AR 1248-1253, 1349-1354 (using mix of plus/minus and\nwritten comments).\n        CCS argues that the evaluators’ plus/minus system did not distinguish between strengths\nand significant strengths or weaknesses and significant weaknesses, or identify risks. Given the\nsubjective assessments required, CCS fails to appreciate the discretion afforded technical\nevaluators in scoring the technical elements in this procurement and overemphasizes the role of\nthe proposal scoring template. Neither the solicitation nor AAFES’ Exchange Operating\nProcedure 65-13 required the use of comment codes for Significant Strengths, Strengths,\nWeaknesses, Significant Weaknesses, and Risks. According to the solicitation, evaluators were\nto numerically score proposals for each of the 11 evaluation factors, and justify the final ratings\n“by drawing upon the strengths, weaknesses, and risks identified.” AR 453-54. The individual\nevaluation sheets reflect that the evaluators complied with this requirement. Each team member\nwrote notes articulating what aspects of each proposal warranted a given score. See, e.g., AR\n1271 (noting that CCS has 10 years in the internet business and experience working on a military\nbase, as justification for a past performance score of [ * * * ] out of 100); AR 1389 (noting that\nResolute allows WiFi subscribers to print to Resolute printers and that gaming devices may be\nassociated with user accounts, as justification for a products score of [ * * * ] out of 100). The\nfailure to regurgitate the comment codes listed on the individual evaluator worksheets is a matter\nof form, not substance, and does not warrant invalidating the technical evaluation. As the\nFederal Circuit has recognized, challenges to the technical scoring involve the “minutiae of the\nprocurement process,” “discretionary determinations of procurement officials that a court will\nnot second guess.” COMINT, 700 F.3d at 1384 (quotation marks omitted) (quoting E.W. Bliss\nCo. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"713114\"><a href=\"/opinion/713114/ew-bliss-company-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 449 (Fed.

CCS submits that the ratings in the Report\nwere not justified by “‘drawing upon the strengths, weaknesses, and risk[s] identified’” as\nrequired by the solicitation. See Pl.’s Mem. 40-43.

While CCS presented a\nfull critical path graph for each installation, Resolute chose to group the installations into\ncategories, then provide a critical path for each category. Compare AR 804-26 (Tab 14) with AR\n535-41 (Tab 13).\n\n\n                                                 43\n\f        CCS argues that the strengths and weaknesses identified in the Source Selection\nCommittee Report are “completely at odds” with the numeric scores. AR 1520. In so arguing,\nCCS disregards the results of the Committee’s consensus evaluation of each proposal, which\nassigned Resolute more strengths and fewer weaknesses overall than CCS. Compare AR 7825-\n26, 7828-30 (Resolute’s strength/weakness determinations) with 7835-7839 (CCS’\nstrength/weakness determinations). For example, under the Technical Design factor, one of the\ntwo most important evaluation factors, CCS received [ * * * ] weaknesses and [ * * * ] strengths\nas compared to Resolute’s [ * * * ] weakness and [ * * * ] strengths, a finding that reasonably\nsupports to the higher score Resolute received. AR 7825, 7838. The same is true for the other\n“disconnects” CCS alleged, with the difference in scores reflecting the strength/weakness\ndeterminations:\n\n           •   Scalability: Resolute had [ * * ] strengths and [ * ] weaknesses compared to CCS’\n               [ * * ] strengths and [ * * ] weakness. AR 7828, 7836;\n\n           •   Standards: Resolute had [ * * ] strengths and [ * ] weaknesses compared to CCS’\n               [ * * ] strengths and [ * * ] weaknesses. AR 7828, 7836;\n\n           •   Portability: Resolute had [ * * ] strengths and [ * ] weaknesses compared to CCS’\n               [ * * ] strengths and [ * * ] weaknesses. AR 7826, 7835;\n\n           •   Past Performance: Resolute had [ * * ] strengths and [ * * ] weaknesses compared\n               to CCS’ [ * * ] strengths and [ * * ] weaknesses. AR 7829, 7837; and\n\n           •   Speed to Market: Resolute had [ * * ] strengths and [ * * ] weakness compared to\n               CCS’ [ * * ] strengths. AR 7826, 7835.\n        This was a best value procurement, and the technical evaluators were charged with\nassessing which proposal’s overall features, including technical design, products, portability,\nspeed to market, customer service, and business understanding, best met the Government’s\nneeds.

The record does not support this allegation. Rather, the record reflects that each\nvoting member of the Source Selection Committee independently evaluated and scored each\nevaluation factor for each proposal and wrote comments explaining or justifying the member’s\nindependent determination. AR 1248-1499. For example, for the Products evaluation factor,\n\n\n                                               44\n\fone member gave CCS a score of [ * ], with comments that CCS could “rollout by June 2011 as\nrequested,” had “multiple ‘architectures’ of systems used to serve different bases/environments,”\nand could provide internet in public hotspots. AR 1248. A different Committee member gave\nCCS a score of [ * ] for the Products evaluation factor, noting that CCS “complies with all\nrequirements,” that it was “[c]urrently providing internet service through DSL equipment,” that it\nhad “[g]ood experience in [the] military environment, but seems to offer only one method, either\nDSL or Cable modem,” and that it had “[l]imited offerings dependent on partnership.” AR 1328.\nWhile the individualized ratings spanned a wide range, this does not mean they were flawed or\nerroneous. Instead, this circumstance highlights the subjectivity of the evaluation process and\nthe reality that different aspects of CCS’ offer were valued by the individual raters. “This Court\ndoes not sit as a super source selection authority to second guess and re-score offerors’\nproposals.” AshBritt, Inc. v.

CCS has\nnot demonstrated that the ratings were flawed, or the numeric scores unwarranted. See\nCOMINT, 700 F.3d at 1384.\n\n        CCS also contends that the Source Selection Committee’s consensus scores were\ninadequately justified. Once the individual evaluations were completed, Source Selection\nCommittee members met to determine their consensus scores and modified their individual\nscores as a result of the discussion. See AR 7492 (EOP 65-13 ¶ 4-23). The modifications were\neither made directly on score sheets or were reflected as differences between the numerical\nscores on individual score sheets and the final Source Selection Committee Proposal Scoring\nSpreadsheet, which reflected the consensus numbers. E.g., AR 1270-73 (noting changes in\nspecific factor scores “after discussion”); AR 1328-33 (highlighting several large point increases\nfor CCS from its original score).\n\n        Below is a summary of the changes between the initial individual scores and the Source\nSelection Committee’s Proposal Scoring Spreadsheet for Resolute’s and CCS’ proposals for\ninternet services:\n\n                Individual Source Selection Committee Member Scores for CCS 18\n\n                    Individual Scores Pre Consensus Meeting   Individual Scores Post Consensus Meeting\nEvaluation Factor   JT      DL      AM      MK       MV       JT      DL       AM      MK       MV\n                    [***]   [***]   [***]   [***]    [***]    [***]   [***]    [***]   [***]    [***]\nProducts\n                    [***]   [***]   [***]   [***]    [***]    [***]   [***]    [***]   [***]    [***]\nPortability\n                    [***]   [***]   [***]   [***]    [***]    [***]   [***]    [***]   [***]    [***]\nMarketing\n                    [***]   [***]   [***]   [***]    [***]    [***]   [***]    [***]   [***]    [***]\nTechnical Design\n                    [***]   [***]   [***]   [***]    [***]    [***]   [***]    [***]   [***]    [***]\nScalability\n\n\n        18\n          This comparison is derived from scores on individual score sheets in AR 1248-1432\nand on the Source Selection Committee’s Proposal Scoring spreadsheet in AR 1228 and 1230.\n\n\n                                                    45\n\f                    [***]       [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]      [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]\nStandards\n                    [***]       [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]      [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]\nSpeed to Market\nCustomer Account\nService             [***]       [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]      [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]\n\nCustomer Care and\nCustomer\n                    [***]       [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]      [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]\nSatisfaction\n                    [***]       [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]      [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]\nPast Performance\nBusiness\nUnderstanding and\n                    [***]       [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]      [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]\nReporting\n\nAR 1228, 1248-53, 1268-73, 1290-95, 1308-13, 1328-33.\n\n               Individual Source Selection Committee Member Scores for Resolute\n\n                        Individual Scores Pre Consensus Meeting            Individual Scores Post Consensus Meeting\nEvaluation Factor\n                        JT        DL        AM        MK         MV        JT        DL        AM        MK        MV\n                        [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]      [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]\nProducts\n                        [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]      [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]\nPortability\n                        [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]      [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]\nMarketing\n                        [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]      [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]\nTechnical Design\n                        [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]      [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]\nScalability\n                        [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]      [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]\nStandards\n                        [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]      [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]\nSpeed to Market\nCustomer      Account\nService                 [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]      [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]\n\n\nCustomer Care and\nCustomer Satisfaction   [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]      [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]\n\n                        [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]      [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]\nPast Performance\nBusiness\n                        [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]      [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]     [***]\nUnderstanding\n\nAR 1230, 1349-54, 1369-74, 1389-94, 1407-12, 1427-32.\n\n       These tables show that as a result of Source Selection Committee discussions, individual\nCommittee members reconsidered and at times altered their original scores. The modified\nindividual scores were then converted into weighted scores for each factor by each individual\nevaluator. AR 1228, 1230.

Rather, CCS contends that, because not every comment or explanation of a strength\nand weakness was quoted in the Source Selection Committee Report, the scores were somehow\nflawed. However, the evaluators’ comments indicate that they weighed the merits of each\n\n\n                                                            46\n\fproposal and considered all aspects of the proposals in arriving at their scores and rankings.\nThere is no reason for this Court to second guess the scoring here. “[I]t is well established that\nthe Court should not substitute its judgment to assess the relative merits of competing proposals\nin a government procurement.” AshBritt, 87 Fed. Cl. at 367 (citing R & W Flammann GmbH v.\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783150\"><a href=\"/opinion/783150/r-w-flammann-gmbh-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">339</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1320</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1322 (Fed. Cir. 2003)).\n\n        CCS also claims that the record does not support AAFES’ representation that it called\neach offeror’s past performance reference, but this allegation is belied by the AR. AR 1520,\n7840. The Source Selection Committee Report states that “[r]eferences for each offeror were\ncontacted and used in evaluations. The reference calls were incorporated into the past\nperformance factor and scored accordingly. No information was received from the reference\ncalls that resulted in any scoring impact.” AR 1520. The record reflects that each voting\nmember of the Source Selection Committee made reference calls and documented the\ninformation from each call. See AR 1266-67, 1286-87, 1326-27, 1346-47 (reflecting eight\nreference calls about CCS and noting customers’ feedback, e.g., customer was “very pleased\nwith [CCS’] performance,” CCS had “great customer support” and was “on target [with]\neverything”); 1367-68, 1387-88, 1425-26, 1445-46 (reflecting eight reference calls about\nResolute and noting customers’ feedback, e.g., customers were “very pleased with [Resolute’s]\nperformance” and “happy [with Resolute] on service and response to problems,” and Resolute\nhad a “well dedicated model” and was “very responsive to all customer needs”).\n\n        Lastly, CCS claims that the Source Selection Authority adopted the “flawed ratings”\nwithout discussing the significance of the technical differences in terms of contract performance\nor governmental needs. According to CCS, the Source Selection Decision highlighted the same\nscores, strengths, and weaknesses identified by the Source Selection Committee without\n“digging deeper and analyzing the significance of the scores.” Pl.’s Mem. 45. However, CCS\nhas not shown that the underlying technical evaluations were incorrect, irrational, or\ninadequately documented, or that the findings here warranted “digging deeper.” Indeed, CCS\nignores the fact that the Source Selection Committee found Resolute to be the hands down\nchoice in the technical and past performance factors. The Committee’s Report stated:\n\n       With the exception of the corporate financial position, this is clearly the best\n       proposal.\n\n       . . . Resolute has strong, flexible product options with ample bandwidth and value\n       enhancements to offer customers. Network design and options for providing\n       service are robust, leveraging [its] extensive experience with AAFES. Resolute\n       consistently presented superior solutions to all factors requested within the RFP.\n\nAR 1520-21.\n\nAAFES’ Fee Evaluations\n\n       CCS claims that AAFES’ evaluation of price proposals was arbitrary and capricious\nbecause AAFES improperly “normalized” the offerors’ price proposals in two respects: (1) it\nused a “normalized penetration rate” -- the estimated percentage of the base population that\nwould pay for internet service -- based solely on ARMP’s subscription information, and (2) it\n\n\n                                               47\n\fused a “normalized base revenue figure.” CCS contends that the normalized penetration rate was\nimproper because the solicitation allowed offerors to choose their technical approaches and did\nnot force them to use ARMP. CCS claims the agency’s use of a normalized base revenue figure\nwas unnecessary because offerors submitted pro forma Operating Statements and cost\nprojections as required by the RFP. CCS further contends that because these normalized\nprotocols were not disclosed in the solicitation CCS was prejudiced.\n\n        The purpose of normalization is to measure offers against the same “baseline.” As this\nCourt has recognized, it is appropriate to use normalization techniques in procurements when\nthere is no logical basis for differences in approach or when there is insufficient information\navailable to accurately evaluate proposals.

Gen. Apr. 29, 1999).\n\n       To calculate the projected financial benefit of offers, AAFES used the following formula:\n\n       Projected Income = Base Population x Price x Fee Percentage x Penetration Rate\n\nAAFES’ independent consultant, Deloitte, calculated standard penetration rates for these services\nbased on FMWRC’s historical usage rates in the Continental United States. AR 5876, 5879.\nThe rates used were 1.8% for pre-paid hourly service, 1.1% for pre-paid daily service, 0.8% for\npre-paid weekly service, and 2.9% for pre-paid monthly service. AR 5879.\n\n        In their pro forma Operating Statements, offerors assumed different penetration rates,\nwhich translated into different potential revenues. CCS proposed a flat fee of [ * * * ] based on a\n[ * * * * * * ] penetration rate, while Resolute proposed fees from [ * * * * * ] based on a\npenetration rate of [ * * * * ]. Neither offeror allowed for different penetration rates depending\non whether a customer chose hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly service options, yet AAFES’\nhistorical data showed that there were different rates for these services. Because the dollar\namount that AAFES would receive in fees was pegged to usage and dependent upon accurate\npenetration rates, AAFES needed to compensate for either overstatements or understatements of\npotential usage in order to accurately measure revenues. Normalizing the penetration rate\nallowed AAFES to accurately measure how CCS’ and Resolute’s different fee percentages\nwould translate into dollars received by AAFES. Thus, CCS has not shown that AAFES’\ndecision to normalize the penetration rate was unreasonable or prejudicial.\n\nAAFES’ Responsibility Determination of Resolute\n\n       According to AAFES policy, a responsible prospective contractor must meet seven\nminimum standards. See AR 8020 (ESR Policy 65-1 ¶ 4-46). At issue in this case are two\nstandards -- that a prospective contractor must (1) have adequate financial resources, or the\n\n\n                                                48\n\fability to obtain such resources as required during performance, and (2) have a record of\nsatisfactory performance “or be able to document beyond reasonable doubt that any prior\nproblems that created a marginal or unsatisfactory situation have been eliminated.” Id. CCS\nargues that the responsibility determination was arbitrary and capricious because the contracting\nofficer unreasonably concluded that Resolute had adequate financial resources and that its prior\nperformance difficulties had been resolved.\n\n       The Financial Responsibility Determination\n\n        CCS claims there is inadequate factual support to conclude that Resolute had sufficient\nfinancial resources to perform the contract and that AAFES placed too much emphasis on how\nthe contract award would improve Resolute’s financial outlook. “Contracting officers are\n‘generally given wide discretion’ in making responsibility determinations and in determining the\namount of information that is required to make a responsibility determination.” Impresa\nConstruzioni Geom.

The contracting officer here\nconsidered Resolute’s past financial difficulties, but placed more weight on the likelihood of\nResolute’s improved financial future, which was permissible under AAFES’ policy -- requiring\nthat a contractor have the “ability to obtain” adequate financial resources. This is not arbitrary\nand capricious or irrational action.\n\n        A paramount element of CCS’ challenge to Resolute’s responsibility determination\nconcerns Resolute’s [ * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ]. CCS claims that Resolute was in “default”\non this loan, but nothing in the record supports a conclusion that Resolute had defaulted or\nmissed payments on its [ * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ]. The contracting officer was aware of the\nloan. AAFES contacted the bank, and the bank provided documentation showing that Resolute\nwas repaying the loan. AR 1755, 8539, 8540-41. Further, the bank [ * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n* * * * * * * * ]. Instead of finding Resolute in default, [ * * * * * * ] unequivocally stated that\nResolute was a stable business, “performing per its agreed loan terms with [ * * * * * ],” that the\nbank would continue to support Resolute and was comfortable with Resolute’s ability to meet its\nobligations.

In Bender Shipbuilding, the Federal Circuit affirmed a financial responsibility\ndetermination where the Army awarded a contract to a bidder that had recently filed for\nbankruptcy under Chapter 11. 297 F.3d at 1362-63. The contracting officer in Bender\nShipbuilding acknowledged the seriousness of the company’s financial situation but awarded it\nthe contract, based in part on a guarantee of performance by the offeror’s parent company and\nthe availability of progress payments under the contract. Id. at 1360. In upholding the decision,\nthe Federal Circuit noted the “wide discretion” that contracting officers have in making\nresponsibility determinations and acknowledged that the awardee and its parent had financial\nproblems, but did not disturb the contracting officer’s determination that the awardee was\nfinancially responsible. Id. at 1362. The awardee in Bender Shipbuilding was in a more\nprecarious position than Resolute here. There is no indication that Resolute was approaching\nbankruptcy, and Resolute demonstrated that it had support from [ * * * * * * ]. CCS has not\nshown that the contracting officer abused her discretion in finding Resolute responsible.\n\n        Citing the Vendor Financial Clearance data, CCS argues that since Resolute was not\ncleared for the full contract amount, or even for [ * ] of the contract amount, it should not have\nbeen found financially responsible. A financial clearance is “an independent source of\ninformation for the contracting officer” indicating a “firm’s financial capability.” AR 8033.\nFinancial clearance under AAFES’ policy is only required for “merchandise, supplies, and\nequipment purchases.” Id. The purpose of AAFES’ financial clearance policy is to “make sure\nthe supplier will ship ordered merchandise timely and will reimburse AAFES for returns (QA\nrejections, recalls, aged merchandise, and so forth).” Id. This contract was not for the purchase\nof “merchandise, supplies, or equipment,” but rather involved provision of telecommunication\nservices to users for a fee with a portion of that fee going back to the NAFI. As such, the\nfinancial arrangement here did not pose the type of risk AAFES’ financial clearance was\nintended to address. In any event, AAFES policy states that the financial clearance process does\nnot, by itself, dictate responsibility. Id. The policy allows a contracting officer to find an\nawardee financially responsible even if it does not receive financial clearance in an amount\nequivalent to the proposed purchase. Id.\n\n       CCS further challenges AAFES’ use of financial statements. CCS correctly observes that\nthe contracting officer erroneously claimed that Resolute’s financial analysis was based on\n“audited financial statements for 2007, 2008, and 2009.” AR 1755 (emphasis added). In fact,\nResolute submitted audited statements for 2007 and 2008, and unaudited statements for 2009.\nWhile CCS claims the absence of audited statements for 2009 should have “set off alarm bells,”\nits own actions belie this claim. CCS itself did not submit audited financial statements. AR\n1011.\n\n        The remainder of CCS’ challenges to the financial responsibility determination rest solely\non matters the Court may not address -- declarations that are not in the record containing Mr.\nJackson’s opinions as to Mr. Wright’s financial analysis and the contracting officer’s decision.\nThe record provides no basis for this Court to overturn the contracting officer’s responsibility\ndetermination. AAFES and the contracting officer were fully aware of Resolute’s financial\ndifficulties. AAFES’ expert, Mr. Wright, acknowledged that Resolute faced severe financial\n\n\n                                               50\n\fchallenges, but projected that if Resolute received the award of the AAFES contract, Resolute’s\nfinancial outlook would greatly improve. AR 1755, 8484. The contracting officer reasonably\nrelied on Mr. Wright’s analysis, noting not only that award would improve Resolute’s financial\noutlook, but that Resolute would be able to “meet commission payment requirements during the\ncontract period of performance.” AR 1756. As Bender Shipbuilding established, it is\npermissible for a contracting officer to consider income that a contractor would receive if the\ncontract at issue were awarded. 297 F.3d at 1362-63.\n\n       Consideration of Past Performance in the Responsibility Determination\n\n        CCS attempts to find fault with the contracting officer’s consideration of Resolute’s past\nperformance, arguing that the contracting officer ignored critical information. The contracting\nofficer identified two main past performance issues for Resolute. The first was a warning letter\ndated October 16, 2009, for a service disruption. AR 1757. The contracting officer noted that\nthe issue had been resolved in a timely manner and that service had been restored the same day.\nThe second issue was a demand for the nonpayment of fees issued on January 13, 2010, and CCS\nclaims that the contracting officer ignored a cure notice from February 2010, but this allegation\nis not supported by the record. The February 2010 letter discussed the same debt referenced in\nthe January 13, 2010 letter, provided Resolute with an additional 30 days to provide a “more\ndefinitive action plan” and was part of the corrective action process referenced in the\nresponsibility determination. AR 10529; see AR 1757-58. The contracting officer found that\nResolute took sufficient corrective action, including a renegotiation of debt owed to AAFES.\nAR 1757-58. While the contracting officer did not cite the February 2010 letter, this is not a\nbasis to overturn her responsibility determination. As the contracting officer noted, Resolute\nbegan making payments on all debts in July 2010, and had consistently made payments since\nthen. AR 1758.\n\n       The Alleged Appearance of Impropriety\n\n        CCS alleges that the debt Resolute owed AAFES from a prior contract created an\nappearance of impropriety. CCS claims that FMWRC’s and ARMP’s involvement in the\nprocurement, coupled with their and AAFES’ interest in Resolute, created an “aura of\ninevitability” in the outcome of the competition, and skewed the competition in favor of\nResolute. However, CCS has not cited any case where a procurement was overturned on the\nground that a debt of an awardee to a government procuring entity created an appearance of\nimpropriety.\n\n        CCS contends that there was an appearance of impropriety for several reasons. First,\nCCS claims that Resolute’s debt gave AAFES an interest in the financial success of Resolute and\na reason to favor Resolute in the competition. However, as the Government points out, Resolute\nand AAFES had agreed upon a new payment schedule prior to award, and Resolute was current\nunder that schedule. Further, the record contains no evidence that the debt affected any member\nof the Source Selection Committee, their scores, or the evaluations of any offerors.\n\n       Second, CCS argues that due to AAFES’ partnership with FMWRC, AAFES had a\nvested interest in the outcome of the procurement, FMWRC as ARMP’s parent organization\n\n\n\n                                               51\n\fwould benefit from the fees Resolute would pay to ARMP for use of ARMP’s network, and an\naward to Resolute would significantly expand ARMP’s market share. However, there is no\nproof that the relationships of ARMP, AAFES, and FMWRC with Resolute were any different\nthan their relationships with CCS. Both CCS and Resolute had prior working relationships with\nARMP, and like Resolute, CCS planned to use ARMP at bases covered under the contract -- as\nthe solicitation permitted. AR 830-34.\n\n        Third, CCS points to an email from Resolute to an ARMP employee requesting that the\nemployee inform AAFES how well Resolute and ARMP worked together as a team on an earlier\nproject. The email states:\n\n       AAFES will be evaluating bidders on their technical abilities and speed to market\n       as extremely important criteria. The fact that ARMP and Resolute working\n       together completed our [transfer of function] responsibilities within 35 days of\n       our actually being told we could proceed. I believe this shows we make a\n       formidable rapid response team. Any way you can get this information to them in\n       writing [which] can only help our mutual case[?] Bill Hart/ARMP was listed as a\n       reference in our reference binder that was submitted 3 weeks ago so there may be\n       a couple ways you could get this scorecard to the right folks. Indirectly, I hope\n       John Temple and Nate Wills are also aware of our mutual accomplishments.\n\nAR 2195. According to CCS, this email shows both that Resolute was attempting to use its\nrelationship with ARMP to its advantage in the evaluation and that ARMP had an interest in the\nprocurement. The Government notes that no employee of ARMP, FMWRC, or AAFES ever\nresponded to the email or agreed to reach out on Resolute’s behalf. Nor is there any evidence\nthat any member of the Source Selection Committee was contacted as a result of this email. As\nsuch, this email does not create an appearance of impropriety.\n\n        The Government argues that CCS’ appearance of impropriety argument is actually an\nallegation of bias in favor of Resolute on the part of government officials, and that CCS cannot\nmeet the evidentiary standard to show bias which requires overcoming the presumption of good\nfaith. In Space Age Engineering, Inc. v. United States, the Court applied the bias standard to an\nappearance of impropriety claim. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cl.

This email\nis similar to the situation addressed in Galen where the awardee listed a technical evaluator as a\npast performance reference, and the Federal Circuit held that the evaluator’s name on a list of\nreferences was insufficient to show that the procurement was tainted. 369 F.3d at 1335-37.\nSimilarly, the fact that Resolute requested an ARMP employee to provide what was essentially a\npast performance reference does not taint the competition here. As noted above, no employee of\nARMP, FMWRC, or AAFES ever responded to the email, and there is no evidence in the record\nthat ARMP contacted any member of the Source Selection Committee as a result of Resolute’s\nemail. CCS has failed to present sufficient evidence of an appearance of impropriety that tainted\nthe award.\n\n                                          Conclusion\n\n        1.
