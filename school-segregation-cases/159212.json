CREW sought documents from\n\nDoEd and, dissatisfied with the responses, now sues under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nCREW’s allegations sound in conspiracy, but there is nothing conspiratorial about DoEd’s\n\nhandling of its FOIA request. Summary judgment will be granted to DoEd on its motion for\n\nsummary judgment concerning the scope of its searches and denied to CREW on its motion for\n\npartial summary judgment concerning FOIA Exemption 5.\n\n                                        I.      FACTS\n\n              In the face of news articles 1 that suggested undue influence in the development of\n\nDoEd’s regulations for the for-profit education sector, CREW filed a request with DoEd on July\n\n23, 2010, pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. § 552. See FOIA\n\n\n1\n  Two of the articles CREW cited are Chris Frates, Short Sellers Flag School Stocks, Politico,\nJune 30, 2010; and Jennifer Epstein, ‘Bad Apples’ or Something More?, Inside Higher Ed, June\n24, 2010. See Def. MSJ [Dkt. 17], Exs. to II Cook Decl. [Dkt. 17-2], Ex. A (FOIA Request) at 3.\n                                                1\n\fRequest at 3.     CREW sought communications from April 20, 2009, to the present from or\n\nbetween DoEd officials and 11 specified individuals or entities:\n\n                Mr. Steven Eisman; Any or all individuals identified as officers,\n                directors, or employees of FrontPoint Partners, LLC; Any or all\n                individuals identified as officers, directors, or employees of\n                Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Inc.; Deputy\n                Undersecretary of Education Robert Shireman; Ms. Pauline\n                Abernathy; Any or all individuals identified as officers, directors,\n                or employees of the Institute for College Access and Success; Mr.\n                Barmak Nassirian; Any or all individuals identified as officers,\n                directors, or employees of the American Association of Collegiate\n                Registrars and Admissions Officers; Mr. Manual P. Asen[s]io;\n                Any or all individuals identified as officers, directors, or\n                employees of The Alliance for Economic Stability; Ms. Johnette\n                McConnell Early.\n\nId. 2\n\n                On October 21, 2010, DoEd contacted CREW about its request, which CREW\n\nnarrowed somewhat, clarifying that it sought “only internal communications regarding any\n\nDepartment communications with the outside entities listed in” the FOIA Request. See Def.\n\nMSJ, II Cook Decl. [Dkt. 17-1] ¶ 10 (quoting II Cook Decl., Ex. B (Oct. 25, 2010, Email from\n\nAnne Weisman) (internal quotation marks omitted)). The FOIA Service Center at DoEd initially\n\nassigned CREW’s FOIA request on August 18, 2010 to four offices likely to have responsive\n\ndocuments: the Office of Communication and Outreach; the Office of Legislative and\n\nCongressional Affairs; the Office of Postsecondary Education; and the Office of the\n\nUndersecretary. Id. ¶ 14. The Office of the Undersecretary sent the request to the Office of\n\nPlanning, Evaluation and Policy on November 3, 2010. Def. MSJ, I Cook Decl. [Dkt. 17–6] ¶ 6.\n\nIn the course of this litigation, the FOIA Service Center further assigned the request to the Office\n\nof the General Counsel; the Office of the Secretary; the Office of Federal Student Aid; and the\n\n\n2\n  After an initial denial, DoEd, without explanation, granted CREW’s request for a waiver of\nfees.\n                                                 2\n\fOffice of the Deputy Secretary. II Cook Decl. ¶ 15. DoEd identified no other likely sources for\n\nresponsive documents. Id.\n\n              DoEd provided responses to CREW in multiple segments.\n\n          •   On November 23, 2010, DoEd sent 42 pages of records from the Office of\n              Planning, Evaluation and Policy and 8 pages of records from the Office of\n              Communication and Outreach, in full, and notified CREW that the Office of\n              Legislative and Congressional Affairs had no responsive records. I Cook Decl.\n              ¶ 8.\n\n          •   On December 3, 2010, DoEd sent a “final” response of 1,354 pages from the\n              Office of Postsecondary Education and 506 pages from the Office of the\n              Undersecretary. Id. ¶ 9. The Office of Postsecondary Education redacted\n              information on only four pages, Def. MSJ, Smith Decl. [Dkt. 17-8] ¶ 10–12, and\n              the Office of the Undersecretary released all 506 pages in full.\n\n          •   On December 22, 2010, DoEd provided in full a single document responsive to\n              CREW’s request that was discovered inadvertently in a different FOIA search. I\n              Cook Decl. ¶ 10.\n\n          •   On April 15, 2011, DoED produced an Interim Response to CREW containing 80\n              pages located in a further search. II Cook Decl. ¶ 28.\n\n          •   On April 22, 2011, a further Interim Response produced 252 pages of records. Id.\n              ¶ 29.\n\n          •   On April 28, 2011, DoEd produced a further 18 pages of responsive records. Id.\n              ¶ 30.\n\n          •   On May 10, 2011, the Department in its final response produced 97 pages to\n              CREW, which were mostly reprocessed versions of documents it had already\n              sent. Id. ¶ 31.\n\n          •   With its brief filed on June 1, 2011, DoEd attached 106 pages of records, which\n              were reprocessed versions of documents previously sent to CREW. Id. ¶ 32; see\n              also Def. MSJ, Ex. K [Dkt. 17-4] (additional reprocessed records).\n\n              Prior to February 2011, DoEd allowed current agency employees to search only\n\ntheir own email accounts. Def. MSJ, I Bashford Decl. [Dkt. 17-5] ¶ 10. Therefore, when the\n\nFOIA request was first received, DoEd searched only the emails of the Department employees\n\nnamed by CREW, on an account-by-account basis. See Def. MSJ at 8 (listing declarations of\n\n\n                                              3\n\femployees who searched in each of five DoEd offices). Beginning in February 2011, select\n\nDoEd employees with “Folder Admin” permission in the information technology (IT) system\n\nwere authorized to conduct agency-wide email searches. I Bashford Decl. ¶ 10. Thereafter,\n\nTerry Bashford, an IT Specialist in the OGC who had the “Folder Admin” access required to\n\nconduct an agency-wide search, searched all Department email since April 2009 for records\n\nresponsive to CREW’s request. Id. ¶ 11.\n\n              Mr. Bashford conducted two searches. The first, on March 28, 2011, produced\n\nover 200,000 responses, many of them obviously unrelated to CREW’s request. Id. ¶ 13. Mr.\n\nBashford modified the search terms slightly and ran a second search on March 31, 2011, that\n\nproduced approximately 14,000 results. Id. ¶ 14. Many of the documents were, again, obviously\n\nunrelated to the FOIA request; Mr. Bashford removed 1,710 documents that he immediately\n\ndetermined to be nonresponsive (i.e., automated administrative emails) and submitted the rest to\n\nindividual DoEd offices for manual processing. Id. ¶¶ 14–15. 3 Apart from the email searches\n\nconducted by Mr. Bashford, DoEd also twice searched the electronic system that tracks\n\ncorrespondence sent to and from DoEd and the Secretary.          II Cook Decl. ¶ 19.      Once\n\nnonresponsive documents were removed, DoEd produced the results of the email and electronic\n\ncorrespondence searches to CREW as part of the interim or final responses listed above. Id.\n\n¶ 20. DoEd also searched “[a]ll of the personal paper, hard-copy files” of the individuals whose\n\nemails or electronic communications were identified as responsive. Id. ¶ 22. The documents\n\nlocated in the paper format were duplicative of those produced in the email and electronic\n\ncorrespondence searches. Id.\n\n\n\n3\n Mr. Bashford performed two additional searches for documents pertaining to Ms. Johnette\nEarly, using special search strings because “early” is a common word. Def. Reply, II Bashford\nDecl. [Dkt. 20-2] ¶¶ 5–7.\n                                               4\n\f                                   II.     LEGAL STANDARD\n\n               Under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment must\n\nbe granted when “the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and\n\nthe movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Anderson v. Liberty\n\nLobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247 (1986). Moreover, summary judgment is properly granted\n\nagainst a party who “after adequate time for discovery and upon motion . . . fails to make a\n\nshowing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case, and on\n\nwhich that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.” Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317,\n\n322 (1986). In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the court must draw all justifiable\n\ninferences in the nonmoving party’s favor and accept the nonmoving party’s evidence as true.\n\nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 255. A nonmoving party, however, must establish more than “the mere\n\nexistence of a scintilla of evidence” in support of its position. Id. at 252.\n\n               FOIA cases are typically and appropriately decided on motions for summary\n\njudgment. Miscavige v. IRS, 2 F.3d 366, 368 (11th Cir. 1993); Rushford v. Civiletti, 485 F.\n\nSupp. 477, 481 n.13 (D.D.C. 1980). In a FOIA case, the Court may award summary judgment\n\nsolely on the basis of information provided by the department or agency in affidavits or\n\ndeclarations when the affidavits or declarations describe “the documents and the justifications for\n\nnondisclosure with reasonably specific detail, demonstrate that the information withheld\n\nlogically falls within the claimed exemption, and are not controverted by either contrary\n\nevidence in the record nor by evidence of agency bad faith.” Military Audit Project v. Casey,\n\n656 F.2d 724, 738 (D.C. Cir. 1981); see also Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820, 826–28 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1973). An agency must demonstrate that “each document that falls within the class requested\n\neither has been produced, is unidentifiable, or is wholly [or partially] exempt from the Act’s\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\finspection requirements.” Goland v. CIA, 607 F.2d 339, 352 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (internal citation\n\nand quotation omitted).\n\n                                       III.    ANALYSIS\n\n                CREW urges the Court to review DoEd’s excuses for its segmented production\n\n“with great care,” Pl. Opp., Dkt. 18, at 2, because there are legitimate concerns about outside\n\ninfluence on DoEd’s rulemaking. It notes that DoEd has repeatedly said that its production was\n\n“final,” only to produce more records: on December 3, 2010 the search was theoretically\n\ncomplete, but DoEd sent another document on December 22, 2010; when DoEd filed its first\n\nmotion for summary judgment on February 16, 2011, it identified an additional 198 pages sent to\n\nthe FOIA Service Center by the Office of the Undersecretary on that very date; after CREW filed\n\nits opposition to the government’s first motion for summary judgment, Dkt. 7, DoEd withdrew\n\nits motion, Dkt. 13, and processed an additional 10,000 emails not previously identified; after the\n\nrelease of a mere 500 emails in four segments in the spring of 2011, DoEd declared that it had\n\nconcluded its document search but then attached 106 documents to its motion for summary\n\njudgment filed on June 1, 2011, which it said were reprocessed versions of records already\n\nproduced. 4 Over all, DoEd has declared at various times that it began its search on August 18,\n\n2010 and ended it only on May 31, 2011, with multiple “final” record productions along the way.\n\n                The Court reviews DoEd’s affidavits, Vaughn indices, and briefs very carefully,\n\nas it does in every case. Despite CREW’s allegations of improprieties, the Court can find no\n\nimpropriety in DoEd’s handling of CREW’s FOIA request. 5\n\n\n4\n    CREW agrees with this description. Pl. Opp. at 8, 20.\n5\n  CREW does not contest the segregability of any redactions or the application of any FOIA\nexemption except Exemption 5 for predecisional records, which is addressed separately below.\nThe Court finds that DoEd conducted a proper analysis of information to be segregated and\nredacted, see 5 U.S.C. § 552(b), Morley v. CIA, 508 F.3d 1108, 1123 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (requiring\n                                                 6\n\f               A.      Adequacy of DoEd’s Search\n\n               The Court first addresses CREW’s argument that DoEd’s search for responsive\n\nrecords was inadequate. FOIA requires agencies of the federal government to release records to\n\nthe public upon request, unless one of nine statutory exemptions applies. See NLRB v. Sears,\n\nRoebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 136 (1975); 5 U.S.C. § 552(b). To prevail in a FOIA case, the\n\nplaintiff must show that an agency has (1) improperly (2) withheld (3) agency records. Dep’t of\n\nJustice v. Tax Analysts, 492 U.S. 136, 142 (1989).\n\n               The adequacy of a search is measured by a standard of reasonableness and\n\ndepends on the individual circumstances of each case. Truitt v. Dep’t of State, 897 F.2d 540, 542\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1990). The question is not whether other responsive documents may exist, but\n\nwhether the search itself was adequate. Steinberg v. Dep’t of Justice, 23 F.3d 548, 551 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1994). Before it can obtain summary judgment in a FOIA case, “an agency must show,\n\nviewing the facts in the light most favorable to the requester, that . . . [it] has conducted a search\n\nreasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.” Id. There is no requirement that an\n\nagency search every record system, but the agency must conduct a good faith, reasonable search\n\nof those systems of records likely to possess the requested information. Oglesby v. Dep’t of\n\nArmy, 920 F.2d 57, 68 (D.C. Cir. 1990). Once an agency has provided adequate affidavits, the\n\nburden shifts back to the plaintiff to demonstrate a lack of a good faith search. Maynard v. CIA,\n\n986 F.2d 547, 560 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n               An agency may prove the reasonableness of its search via the declaration of\n\nresponsible agency officials, so long as the declaration is reasonably detailed and not\n\ndistrict courts to make “‘an express finding on segregability’” (quoting PHE, Inc. v. Dep’t of\nJustice, 983 F.2d 248, 252 (D.C. Cir. 1993))), and that, in any event, CREW has waived any\nargument concerning segregation or redaction except as to FOIA Exemption 5. CREW contests\nonly the scope of the search and the applicability of Exemption 5. FOIA Exemption 6, invasion\nof personal privacy, on which DoEd also relied for some redactions, is not at issue.\n                                                  7\n\fcontroverted by contrary evidence or evidence of bad faith. Military Audit Project, 656 F.2d at\n\n738. An agency’s declarations are accorded “a presumption of good faith, which cannot be\n\nrebutted by purely speculative claims about the existence and discoverability of other\n\ndocuments.” SafeCard Servs. v. SEC, 926 F.2d 1197, 1200 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (internal citation\n\nand quotation omitted). Further, an agency is not required to undertake a search that is so broad\n\nas to be unduly burdensome. Nation Magazine v. U.S. Customs Serv., 71 F.3d 885, 890 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2003). “[I]t is the requester’s responsibility to frame requests with sufficient particularity to\n\nensure that searches are not unreasonably burdensome . . . [because] FOIA was not intended to\n\nreduce government agencies to full-time investigators on behalf of requesters.” Judicial Watch,\n\nInc. v. Export-Import Bank, 108 F. Supp. 2d 19, 27 (D.D.C. 2000) (quotation and citation\n\nomitted). Moreover, an agency is “not obliged to look beyond the four corners of the request for\n\nleads to the location of responsive documents.” Kowalczyk v. Dep’t of Justice, 73 F.3d 386, 389\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1996).\n\n               DoEd’s FOIA Service Center initially assigned CREW’s request to five offices:\n\nOffice of Legislative Affairs, Office of Communications and Outreach, Office of Postsecondary\n\nEducation, Office of the Undersecretary, and Office of Planning, Evaluation and Policy. CREW\n\ndoes not contest these assignments. Subsequently, after CREW’s opposition to DoEd’s first\n\nmotion for summary judgment, the FOIA Service Center identified four additional offices that\n\nmight have responsive records: Office of the General Counsel, Office of the Secretary, Office of\n\nFederal Student Aid, and Office of the Deputy Secretary. CREW, again, does not contest any of\n\nthese assignments.\n\n               The FOIA Service Center identified the listed Offices as likely to maintain\n\nresponsive records because of their responsibility for, or involvement in, its subject matter:\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\fcommunications with Steven Eisman, FrontPoint Partners, Morgan Stanley Investment\n\nManagement, Pauline Abernathy, the Institute for College Access and Success, Barmak\n\nNassirian, The American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admission Officers, Manuel\n\nAsensio, the Alliance for Economic Stability, Johnette McConnell Early, and Bob Shireman\n\nregarding for-profit information. II Cook Decl. ¶ 16. With the exception of Mr. Shireman, a\n\nformer DoEd employee who has since left the government, all of these persons are outside\n\nDoEd.\n\n                  DoEd first searched the email accounts of the 17 individuals identified by CREW:\n\neight in the Office of Communication & Outreach, one in the Office of Legislative and\n\nCongressional Affairs, five in the Office of Postsecondary Education, one in the Office of\n\nPlanning, Evaluation, and Policy, and two from the Office of the Undersecretary. Subsequently,\n\nafter the first round of briefing was withdrawn, DoEd searched the email accounts of two more\n\nemployees in the Office of the General Counsel, two more employees in the Office of the\n\nUndersecretary, one more employee in the Office of Federal Student Aid, two more employees\n\nin the Office of Legislative and Congressional Affairs, two more employees in the Office of the\n\nSecretary, one employee from the Office of Communication & Outreach, and five employees\n\nfrom the Office of the Deputy Secretary. II Cook Decl. ¶ 21. CREW does not contest any of\n\nthese searches.\n\n                  However, CREW opposes summary judgment because “[s]till missing” are\n\nrecords from DoEd officials Michael Dannenberg and Hal Plotkin, as well as Secretary Arne\n\nDuncan and his assistant Phil Martin. Pl. Opp. at 12. CREW argues that DoEd “refuse[d] to\n\nsearch the records” of these four individuals in a “concerted effort to protect these policy-level\n\nofficials from public scrutiny.” Id. at 13. According to CREW, DoEd’s search was deficient\n\n\n\n                                                  9\n\fboth because it failed to recover emails and failed to expand its search for responsive paper\n\nrecords. Id. at 11–14.\n\n               CREW’s objection is without merit. See Steinberg, 23 F.3d at 551 (holding that\n\nFOIA requires a “search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents” (internal\n\ncitations and quotations omitted)). As Terry Bashford explains, he had authorized access to the\n\ndatabase that contains all emails received and sent since April 20, 2009, by all DoEd employees,\n\nincluding Messrs. Dannenberg and Plotkin and Secretary Duncan, and he searched that database\n\nusing search terms to which CREW has no substantive objection. 6 See I Bashford Decl. ¶¶ 11,\n\n13–15. Moreover, the electronic correspondence of all DoEd personnel, including the four\n\npersons specifically identified by CREW, was subject to two separate searches. See II Cook\n\nDecl. ¶ 19. DoEd also searched the “paper, hard-copy files” maintained by each of the four\n\nindividuals about which CREW complains, in addition to thirty-two other individuals. II Cook\n\nDecl. ¶ 21; Def. Reply, III Cook Decl. [Dkt. 20-3] ¶¶ 7–8. All responsive records have been\n\nproduced except for those retained under Exemption 5.\n\n               CREW further complains that it cannot determine the scope of a search for\n\n“personal paper, hard-copy files,” because the term has an “uncertain meaning.” Pl. Opp. at 13.\n\nThe Court disagrees; the term speaks for itself. Moreover, DoEd has explained further: “None of\n\n[the DoEd offices in question] maintain centralized repositories of records that would have been\n\nresponsive to the FOIA Request. Rather, individuals in these offices maintain their own paper\n\nfiles, i.e., personal hard-copy paper files. . . . Each of the paper, hard-copy files maintained by\n\nthese individuals, whether in their offices or elsewhere, were searched manually for any\n\ncorrespondence [related to the FOIA Request].” III Cook Decl. ¶¶ 6–7. DoEd has more than\n\n6\n CREW does challenge the adequacy of the search terms on two limited grounds, discussed\nbelow.\n                                                10\n\fmet its burden of showing that its search was adequate under FOIA. See Oglesby, 920 F.2d at 68\n\n(requiring “[a] reasonably detailed affidavit, setting forth the search terms and the type of search\n\nperformed, and averring that all files likely to contain responsive materials (if such records exist)\n\nwere searched”).\n\n               B.      Clarity of Search Terms and Search Dates\n\n               CREW argues that the Court should deny DoEd’s motion for summary judgment\n\nbecause DoEd has provided conflicting information about the dates of its searches and the terms\n\nused in those searches. This argument is unpersuasive.\n\n               First, according to CREW, DoEd’s search was deficient because the affidavits of\n\nElise Cook and Terry Bashford contain conflicting dates for searches. Pl. Opp. 14–15. It is\n\npuzzling, CREW claims, that both Ms. Cook and Mr. Bashford describe a first search on either\n\nMarch 28 or 29, 2011, but Ms. Cook mentions a second search on May 31, 2011, while Mr.\n\nBashford refers to the second search as occurring on March 31, 2011. Id. But there is nothing\n\nsinister in this inconsistency because Ms. Cook and Mr. Bashford each described two separate\n\nsearches of two separate systems. Compare I Bashford Decl. ¶¶ 13–15 (describing searches of\n\nemail system on March 28, 2011, and March 31, 2011) with II Cook Decl. ¶ 19 (describing\n\nsearches of electronic correspondence system, one occurring prior to February 2011, the other\n\noccurring on May 31, 2011).\n\n               Second, CREW points to what it claims are two conflicts between the search\n\ndescriptions provided by Elise Cook and Terry Bashford. It challenges the search for documents\n\nregarding Morgan Stanley.      See Pl. Opp. 15 (“According to Ms. Cook, Education’s March 29\n\nsearch included only the term ‘Stanley Investment,’ while the May 31, 2011 search used both\n\n‘Morgan Stanley’ and ‘Stanley Investment.’ Mr. Bashford describes both his March 29 and his\n\nMarch 31 searches as using the terms ‘Stanley’ and ‘Stanley//Investment.’” (citations omitted)).\n                                                 11\n\fCREW also challenges the search for documents regarding Ms. Johnette Early. See id. at 16\n\n(“Ms. Cook describes the March 29, 2011 search as using the term ‘Johnette,’ while the May 31,\n\n2011 search used the term ‘Early.’ . . . Mr. Bashford’s searches used only the term ‘Johnette.’”\n\n(citations omitted)). As discussed above, contrary to CREW’s understanding, Ms. Cook and Mr.\n\nBashford were describing different searches of different systems. More importantly, CREW has\n\nadvanced no argument—and the Court can see none—as to why the searches DoEd ran would\n\nnot have returned all responsive records dealing with Morgan Stanley or Ms. Early. DoEd has\n\nfurther explained that Mr. Bashford originally used only “Johnette” because “early” is a common\n\nword, but he later conducted two extra searches specifically seeking documents regarding Ms.\n\nEarly that had not already been retrieved.     See II Bashford Decl. ¶ 6 (describing searches\n\ninvolving, inter alia, Ms. Early’s private Yahoo address). These extra searches did not yield any\n\nnew documents. Id.\n\n               The Court thus rejects CREW’s argument that DoEd’s search was inadequate\n\nbased on any alleged inconsistency between search dates or search terms.\n\n               C.     Omission of Critical Information from Emails\n\n               CREW objects to DoEd’s release of emails because the paper versions lack what\n\nCREW argues is “critical information, including complete email addresses for the senders and\n\nrecipients” and BCC recipient information, as well as metadata. Pl. Opp. at 17–19. This\n\nobjection is unavailing. FOIA only requires production of responsive records “in any form or\n\nformat requested by the person if the record is readily reproducible by the agency in that form or\n\nformat.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3)(B). CREW loses on two accounts. Notwithstanding that it\n\nrequested that DoEd search for records “regardless of format, medium, or physical characters,\n\nand including electronic records and information,” CREW did not request that DoEd produce its\n\nrecords in electronic format, much less electronic format with metadata. See FOIA Request at 1–\n                                               12\n\f2. DoEd thus had no obligation to produce the documents in any particular format. Moreover,\n\nas the Bashford Declaration establishes, see I Bashford Decl. ¶¶ 7, 16, DoEd’s email records are\n\nnot “readily reproducible” in electronic format, and the DoEd email retention system “will not\n\ndisplay or print” the BCC field “for any retrieved email.” See Sample v. Bureau of Prisons, 466\n\nF.3d 1086, 1088 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (holding that an agency’s “determination as to reproducibility\n\nmust be accorded ‘substantial weight’ by the reviewing court”); accord 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B).\n\n              Notwithstanding CREW’s failure to request a specific format and DoEd’s\n\ninability to produce the requested data electronically, CREW invites the Court to find that a\n\ngovernment agency must produce electronic copies and/or metadata to comply with FOIA. The\n\nCourt declines because it does not see here in CREW’s argument any basis to impose an\n\nelectronic copy obligation on a federal agency. The copying charge which FOIA imposes, see 5\n\nU.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A), indicates that Congress anticipated that agencies would produce hard\n\npaper copies of all records requested, particularly when not otherwise requested and readily\n\nreproducible. CREW’s argument that it is entitled to metadata and blind copy addresses of all\n\nemails, when that information cannot be readily produced by DoEd, fails as a matter of law. The\n\nargument would require the creation of documentation rather than the production of what exists.\n\nIn addition, there is no legitimate basis to suspect the scope or good faith basis of DoEd’s\n\nresponses here. See SafeCard Servs., 926 F.2d at 1200 (holding that a FOIA requester cannot\n\nrebut an agency’s affidavits with “purely speculative claims about the existence and\n\ndiscoverability of other documents” (quoting Ground Saucer Watch, Inc. v. CIA, 692 F.2d 770,\n\n771 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (internal quotation marks omitted))).\n\n              D.      Department-wide Email Search Only in March 2011\n\n              CREW finds it suspicious that DoEd only searched a Department-wide database\n\nfor emails in March 2011 when that database existed as early as April 2009, albeit offsite and\n                                               13\n\fcontrolled by a vendor.     Pl. Opp. at 21–23.       DoEd has explained that Department policy\n\nprevented a general search of employee email by Departmental employees prior to February\n\n2011 and that it conducted such a search soon after it was authorized. See I Bashford Decl.\n\n¶¶ 10–11.\n\n               The Court need not pause to consider when an agency’s reliance on a vendor to\n\nhouse and maintain agency email provides a reason not to search email to answer a FOIA\n\nrequest. What is clear is that DoEd has, in fact, searched all email from April 2009 going\n\nforward, covering all email received and sent by anyone in the Department.             See id. ¶ 11\n\n(referring to “agency-wide electronic searches for email responsive to [CREW’s FOIA\n\nRequest]”). The production of such email to CREW moots the question. See Nw. Univ. v. Dep’t\n\nof Agric., 403 F. Supp. 2d 83, 85 (D.D.C. 2005) (“Generally, in FOIA cases, ‘[o]nce the records\n\nare produced, the substance of the controversy disappears and becomes moot since the disclosure\n\nwhich the suit seeks has already been made.’ (quoting Crooker v. State Dep’t, 628 F.2d 9, 10\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1980))). 7\n\n                E.      Exemption 5: Deliberative Process Privilege\n\n                CREW both opposes DoEd’s motion for summary judgment, Pl. Opp at 23, and\n\nfiles its own motion for partial summary judgment, Dkt. 19, on the basis that FOIA Exemption 5\n\nno longer applies to the documents DoEd has segregated. Exemption 5 provides that FOIA does\n\nnot apply to “inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available\n\nby law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency[.]” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5).\n\n\n7\n  Although there is an exception to this rule in which courts retain jurisdiction to determine, for\nexample, “whether the search for records was adequate under the standards for adequate records\nsearches required under the FOIA by the relevant case law,” Looney v. Walters-Tucker, 98 F.\nSupp. 2d 1, 2 (D.D.C. 2000), aff’d sub nom. Looney v. F.D.I.C., 2 F. App’x 8 (D.C. Cir. 2001),\nthis argument about the timing of electronic searches of email is moot because the Court also\nconcludes that DoEd’s search was adequate, as discussed above.\n                                                14\n\fExemption 5 encompasses materials which would be protected under the attorney-client\n\nprivilege, the attorney work-product privilege, or the executive deliberative process privilege.\n\nFormaldehyde Inst. v. Dep’t Health & Human Servs., 889 F.2d 1118, 1121 (D.C. Cir. 1989),\n\noverruled on other grounds by Nat’l Inst. of Military Justice, 512 F.3d 677 (D.C. Cir. 2008); see\n\nalso NLRB, 421 U.S. at 149 (Exemption 5 includes all documents “normally privileged in the\n\ncivil discovery context.”).\n\n               The deliberative process privilege exempts from disclosure documents “reflecting\n\nadvisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which\n\ngovernmental decisions and policies are formulated.”        NLRB, 421 U.S. at 150.       Further,\n\nExemption 5 “covers recommendations, draft documents, proposals, suggestions, and other\n\nsubjective documents which reflect the personal opinions of the writer rather than the policy of\n\nthe agency.” Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Dep’t of Energy, 617 F.2d 854, 866 (D.C. Cir. 1980).\n\nSuch documents are protected in order to promote “the quality of agency decisions by protecting\n\nopen and frank discussion among those who make them within the Government.” Dep’t of the\n\nInterior v. Klamath Water Users Protective Ass’n, 532 U.S. 1, 9 (2001); accord Tax Analysts v.\n\nIRS, 117 F.3d 607, 617 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (the quality of decision-making would be seriously\n\nundermined if agencies were forced to operate in a “fish bowl” since open and frank discussion\n\nregarding legal or policy matters would be impossible).\n\n               To qualify for withholding, material must be both predecisional and deliberative.\n\nJudicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Energy, 412 F.3d 125, 129 (D.C. Cir. 2005).\n\n               A document is predecisional if it was prepared in order to assist an\n               agency decisionmaker in arriving at his decision, rather than to\n               support a decision already made. Material is deliberative if it\n               reflects the give-and-take of the consultative process. [The D.C.\n               Circuit’s] recent decisions on the deliberativeness inquiry have\n\n\n\n                                               15\n\f               focused on whether disclosure of the requested material would\n               tend to discourage candid discussion within an agency.\n\nPetroleum Info. Corp. v. Dep’t of Interior, 976 F.2d 1429, 1434 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (citations and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted).\n\n               CREW’s only argument is that DoEd “no longer needs the confidentiality\n\nafforded by Exemption 5” because it has issued its final regulations regarding gainful\n\nemployment, the subject about which CREW filed its FOIA Request. Pl. MSJ at 11. The\n\nargument has no merit.\n\n               The first flaw in CREW’s argument is that the records withheld by DoEd pursuant\n\nto Exemption 5 were dated in 2010, well before the regulations were made final in June 2011.\n\nSee Def. MSJ, Ex. J [Dkt. 17-3] (Vaughn Index). The records were thus predecisional in the\n\nplainest sense of the word. See N.L.R.B., 421 U.S. at 151–52 (“[C]ourts have uniformly drawn a\n\ndistinction between predecisional communications, which are privileged, and communications\n\nmade after the decision and designed to explain it, which are not.” (internal citations omitted)).\n\nMoreover, the Vaughn Index submitted by DoEd demonstrates that the documents fit\n\ncomfortably within Exemption 5 due to their role in DoEd’s deliberative process. See, e.g.,\n\nVaughn Index at 24 (describing “an inter-agency communication between senior Department\n\nofficials regarding developing an approach to managing external communications related to for-\n\nprofit education during the development of the proposed Gainful Employment rule”).\n\n               CREW does not assert that any of the documents postdated the issuance of the\n\nregulations, relying solely on the argument that the documents have now lost their\n\n“predecisional” character. Pl. MSJ at 11. But the later issuance of a regulation does nothing to\n\nchange the nature of the documents themselves. As long as records are “part of the deliberative\n\nprocess by which a decision is made,” they are exempt from disclosure.

Cir. 1977)). Although predecisional documents may lose their protection if\n\n“adopted, formally or informally, as the agency position on an issue or is used by the agency in\n\nits dealings with the public,” id. (quoting Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 866), CREW has not made\n\nthat argument in this case and it has no record support, as the Vaughn Index shows. The Court\n\nconcludes that DoEd properly withheld certain documents pursuant to Exemption 5 and that the\n\nJune 2011 issuance of final regulations did not affect the applicability of that exemption.\n\n                                     IV.     CONCLUSION\n\n               CREW attempts to question the good faith of DoEd’s response to its FOIA\n\nrequest because of outside news articles and the segmented nature of DoEd’s production. The\n\nonly substantive challenge advanced by CREW concerned Exemption 5 and is clearly without\n\nmerit.   At the point of summary judgment, DoEd has explained its search, the reasons it\n\ncontinued to produce responsive documents, and its results in fully adequate fashion. The\n\nDepartment’s motion for summary judgment, Dkt. 17, will be granted and CREW’s cross motion\n\nfor partial summary judgment, Dkt. 19, will be denied.

FACTS\n\n              In the face of news articles 1 that suggested undue influence in the development of\n\nDoEd’s regulations for the for-profit education sector, CREW filed a request with DoEd on July\n\n23, 2010, pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. § 552. See FOIA\n\n\n1\n  Two of the articles CREW cited are Chris Frates, Short Sellers Flag School Stocks, Politico,\nJune 30, 2010; and Jennifer Epstein, ‘Bad Apples’ or Something More?, Inside Higher Ed, June\n24, 2010.

See Def.\n\nMSJ, II Cook Decl. [Dkt. 17-1] ¶ 10 (quoting II Cook Decl., Ex. B (Oct. 25, 2010, Email from\n\nAnne Weisman) (internal quotation marks omitted)). The FOIA Service Center at DoEd initially\n\nassigned CREW’s FOIA request on August 18, 2010 to four offices likely to have responsive\n\ndocuments: the Office of Communication and Outreach; the Office of Legislative and\n\nCongressional Affairs; the Office of Postsecondary Education; and the Office of the\n\nUndersecretary.

[Dkt. 17-5] ¶ 10. Therefore, when the\n\nFOIA request was first received, DoEd searched only the emails of the Department employees\n\nnamed by CREW, on an account-by-account basis. See Def. MSJ at 8 (listing declarations of\n\n\n                                              3\n\femployees who searched in each of five DoEd offices). Beginning in February 2011, select\n\nDoEd employees with “Folder Admin” permission in the information technology (IT) system\n\nwere authorized to conduct agency-wide email searches. I Bashford Decl. ¶ 10. Thereafter,\n\nTerry Bashford, an IT Specialist in the OGC who had the “Folder Admin” access required to\n\nconduct an agency-wide search, searched all Department email since April 2009 for records\n\nresponsive to CREW’s request. Id. ¶ 11.\n\n              Mr. Bashford conducted two searches. The first, on March 28, 2011, produced\n\nover 200,000 responses, many of them obviously unrelated to CREW’s request. Id. ¶ 13. Mr.\n\nBashford modified the search terms slightly and ran a second search on March 31, 2011, that\n\nproduced approximately 14,000 results. Id. ¶ 14. Many of the documents were, again, obviously\n\nunrelated to the FOIA request; Mr. Bashford removed 1,710 documents that he immediately\n\ndetermined to be nonresponsive (i.e., automated administrative emails) and submitted the rest to\n\nindividual DoEd offices for manual processing. Id. ¶¶ 14–15. 3 Apart from the email searches\n\nconducted by Mr. Bashford, DoEd also twice searched the electronic system that tracks\n\ncorrespondence sent to and from DoEd and the Secretary.          II Cook Decl. ¶ 19.      Once\n\nnonresponsive documents were removed, DoEd produced the results of the email and electronic\n\ncorrespondence searches to CREW as part of the interim or final responses listed above. Id.\n\n¶ 20. DoEd also searched “[a]ll of the personal paper, hard-copy files” of the individuals whose\n\nemails or electronic communications were identified as responsive. Id. ¶ 22. The documents\n\nlocated in the paper format were duplicative of those produced in the email and electronic\n\ncorrespondence searches.

ANALYSIS\n\n                CREW urges the Court to review DoEd’s excuses for its segmented production\n\n“with great care,” Pl. Opp., Dkt. 18, at 2, because there are legitimate concerns about outside\n\ninfluence on DoEd’s rulemaking. It notes that DoEd has repeatedly said that its production was\n\n“final,” only to produce more records: on December 3, 2010 the search was theoretically\n\ncomplete, but DoEd sent another document on December 22, 2010; when DoEd filed its first\n\nmotion for summary judgment on February 16, 2011, it identified an additional 198 pages sent to\n\nthe FOIA Service Center by the Office of the Undersecretary on that very date; after CREW filed\n\nits opposition to the government’s first motion for summary judgment, Dkt. 7, DoEd withdrew\n\nits motion, Dkt. 13, and processed an additional 10,000 emails not previously identified; after the\n\nrelease of a mere 500 emails in four segments in the spring of 2011, DoEd declared that it had\n\nconcluded its document search but then attached 106 documents to its motion for summary\n\njudgment filed on June 1, 2011, which it said were reprocessed versions of records already\n\nproduced. 4 Over all, DoEd has declared at various times that it began its search on August 18,\n\n2010 and ended it only on May 31, 2011, with multiple “final” record productions along the way.\n\n                The Court reviews DoEd’s affidavits, Vaughn indices, and briefs very carefully,\n\nas it does in every case. Despite CREW’s allegations of improprieties, the Court can find no\n\nimpropriety in DoEd’s handling of CREW’s FOIA request. 5\n\n\n4\n    CREW agrees with this description. Pl. Opp. at 8, 20.\n5\n  CREW does not contest the segregability of any redactions or the application of any FOIA\nexemption except Exemption 5 for predecisional records, which is addressed separately below.\nThe Court finds that DoEd conducted a proper analysis of information to be segregated and\nredacted, see 5 U.S.C. § 552(b), Morley v.

Adequacy of DoEd’s Search\n\n               The Court first addresses CREW’s argument that DoEd’s search for responsive\n\nrecords was inadequate. FOIA requires agencies of the federal government to release records to\n\nthe public upon request, unless one of nine statutory exemptions applies. See NLRB v. Sears,\n\nRoebuck & Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109241\"><a href=\"/opinion/109241/nlrb-v-sears-roebuck-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">132</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 136 (1975); 5 U.S.C. § 552(b).

Before it can obtain summary judgment in a FOIA case, “an agency must show,\n\nviewing the facts in the light most favorable to the requester, that . . . [it] has conducted a search\n\nreasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.” Id. There is no requirement that an\n\nagency search every record system, but the agency must conduct a good faith, reasonable search\n\nof those systems of records likely to possess the requested information.

CREW\n\ndoes not contest these assignments. Subsequently, after CREW’s opposition to DoEd’s first\n\nmotion for summary judgment, the FOIA Service Center identified four additional offices that\n\nmight have responsive records: Office of the General Counsel, Office of the Secretary, Office of\n\nFederal Student Aid, and Office of the Deputy Secretary. CREW, again, does not contest any of\n\nthese assignments.\n\n               The FOIA Service Center identified the listed Offices as likely to maintain\n\nresponsive records because of their responsibility for, or involvement in, its subject matter:\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\fcommunications with Steven Eisman, FrontPoint Partners, Morgan Stanley Investment\n\nManagement, Pauline Abernathy, the Institute for College Access and Success, Barmak\n\nNassirian, The American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admission Officers, Manuel\n\nAsensio, the Alliance for Economic Stability, Johnette McConnell Early, and Bob Shireman\n\nregarding for-profit information. II Cook Decl. ¶ 16. With the exception of Mr. Shireman, a\n\nformer DoEd employee who has since left the government, all of these persons are outside\n\nDoEd.\n\n                  DoEd first searched the email accounts of the 17 individuals identified by CREW:\n\neight in the Office of Communication & Outreach, one in the Office of Legislative and\n\nCongressional Affairs, five in the Office of Postsecondary Education, one in the Office of\n\nPlanning, Evaluation, and Policy, and two from the Office of the Undersecretary. Subsequently,\n\nafter the first round of briefing was withdrawn, DoEd searched the email accounts of two more\n\nemployees in the Office of the General Counsel, two more employees in the Office of the\n\nUndersecretary, one more employee in the Office of Federal Student Aid, two more employees\n\nin the Office of Legislative and Congressional Affairs, two more employees in the Office of the\n\nSecretary, one employee from the Office of Communication & Outreach, and five employees\n\nfrom the Office of the Deputy Secretary. II Cook Decl. ¶ 21. CREW does not contest any of\n\nthese searches.\n\n                  However, CREW opposes summary judgment because “[s]till missing” are\n\nrecords from DoEd officials Michael Dannenberg and Hal Plotkin, as well as Secretary Arne\n\nDuncan and his assistant Phil Martin. Pl. Opp. at 12. CREW argues that DoEd “refuse[d] to\n\nsearch the records” of these four individuals in a “concerted effort to protect these policy-level\n\nofficials from public scrutiny.” Id. at 13. According to CREW, DoEd’s search was deficient\n\n\n\n                                                  9\n\fboth because it failed to recover emails and failed to expand its search for responsive paper\n\nrecords. Id. at 11–14.\n\n               CREW’s objection is without merit. See Steinberg, 23 F.3d at 551 (holding that\n\nFOIA requires a “search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents” (internal\n\ncitations and quotations omitted)). As Terry Bashford explains, he had authorized access to the\n\ndatabase that contains all emails received and sent since April 20, 2009, by all DoEd employees,\n\nincluding Messrs. Dannenberg and Plotkin and Secretary Duncan, and he searched that database\n\nusing search terms to which CREW has no substantive objection. 6 See I Bashford Decl. ¶¶ 11,\n\n13–15. Moreover, the electronic correspondence of all DoEd personnel, including the four\n\npersons specifically identified by CREW, was subject to two separate searches. See II Cook\n\nDecl. ¶ 19. DoEd also searched the “paper, hard-copy files” maintained by each of the four\n\nindividuals about which CREW complains, in addition to thirty-two other individuals. II Cook\n\nDecl. ¶ 21; Def. Reply, III Cook Decl. [Dkt. 20-3] ¶¶ 7–8. All responsive records have been\n\nproduced except for those retained under Exemption 5.\n\n               CREW further complains that it cannot determine the scope of a search for\n\n“personal paper, hard-copy files,” because the term has an “uncertain meaning.” Pl. Opp. at 13.\n\nThe Court disagrees; the term speaks for itself. Moreover, DoEd has explained further: “None of\n\n[the DoEd offices in question] maintain centralized repositories of records that would have been\n\nresponsive to the FOIA Request. Rather, individuals in these offices maintain their own paper\n\nfiles, i.e., personal hard-copy paper files. . . . Each of the paper, hard-copy files maintained by\n\nthese individuals, whether in their offices or elsewhere, were searched manually for any\n\ncorrespondence [related to the FOIA Request].” III Cook Decl. ¶¶ 6–7. DoEd has more than\n\n6\n CREW does challenge the adequacy of the search terms on two limited grounds, discussed\nbelow.\n                                                10\n\fmet its burden of showing that its search was adequate under FOIA. See Oglesby, 920 F.2d at 68\n\n(requiring “[a] reasonably detailed affidavit, setting forth the search terms and the type of search\n\nperformed, and averring that all files likely to contain responsive materials (if such records exist)\n\nwere searched”).\n\n               B.      Clarity of Search Terms and Search Dates\n\n               CREW argues that the Court should deny DoEd’s motion for summary judgment\n\nbecause DoEd has provided conflicting information about the dates of its searches and the terms\n\nused in those searches. This argument is unpersuasive.\n\n               First, according to CREW, DoEd’s search was deficient because the affidavits of\n\nElise Cook and Terry Bashford contain conflicting dates for searches. Pl. Opp. 14–15. It is\n\npuzzling, CREW claims, that both Ms. Cook and Mr. Bashford describe a first search on either\n\nMarch 28 or 29, 2011, but Ms. Cook mentions a second search on May 31, 2011, while Mr.\n\nBashford refers to the second search as occurring on March 31, 2011. Id. But there is nothing\n\nsinister in this inconsistency because Ms. Cook and Mr. Bashford each described two separate\n\nsearches of two separate systems. Compare I Bashford Decl. ¶¶ 13–15 (describing searches of\n\nemail system on March 28, 2011, and March 31, 2011) with II Cook Decl. ¶ 19 (describing\n\nsearches of electronic correspondence system, one occurring prior to February 2011, the other\n\noccurring on May 31, 2011).\n\n               Second, CREW points to what it claims are two conflicts between the search\n\ndescriptions provided by Elise Cook and Terry Bashford. It challenges the search for documents\n\nregarding Morgan Stanley.      See Pl. Opp. 15 (“According to Ms. Cook, Education’s March 29\n\nsearch included only the term ‘Stanley Investment,’ while the May 31, 2011 search used both\n\n‘Morgan Stanley’ and ‘Stanley Investment.’ Mr. Bashford describes both his March 29 and his\n\nMarch 31 searches as using the terms ‘Stanley’ and ‘Stanley//Investment.’” (citations omitted)).\n                                                 11\n\fCREW also challenges the search for documents regarding Ms. Johnette Early. See id. at 16\n\n(“Ms. Cook describes the March 29, 2011 search as using the term ‘Johnette,’ while the May 31,\n\n2011 search used the term ‘Early.’ . . . Mr. Bashford’s searches used only the term ‘Johnette.’”\n\n(citations omitted)). As discussed above, contrary to CREW’s understanding, Ms. Cook and Mr.\n\nBashford were describing different searches of different systems. More importantly, CREW has\n\nadvanced no argument—and the Court can see none—as to why the searches DoEd ran would\n\nnot have returned all responsive records dealing with Morgan Stanley or Ms. Early. DoEd has\n\nfurther explained that Mr. Bashford originally used only “Johnette” because “early” is a common\n\nword, but he later conducted two extra searches specifically seeking documents regarding Ms.\n\nEarly that had not already been retrieved.     See II Bashford Decl. ¶ 6 (describing searches\n\ninvolving, inter alia, Ms. Early’s private Yahoo address). These extra searches did not yield any\n\nnew documents. Id.\n\n               The Court thus rejects CREW’s argument that DoEd’s search was inadequate\n\nbased on any alleged inconsistency between search dates or search terms.\n\n               C.     Omission of Critical Information from Emails\n\n               CREW objects to DoEd’s release of emails because the paper versions lack what\n\nCREW argues is “critical information, including complete email addresses for the senders and\n\nrecipients” and BCC recipient information, as well as metadata. Pl. Opp. at 17–19. This\n\nobjection is unavailing. FOIA only requires production of responsive records “in any form or\n\nformat requested by the person if the record is readily reproducible by the agency in that form or\n\nformat.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3)(B). CREW loses on two accounts. Notwithstanding that it\n\nrequested that DoEd search for records “regardless of format, medium, or physical characters,\n\nand including electronic records and information,” CREW did not request that DoEd produce its\n\nrecords in electronic format, much less electronic format with metadata. See FOIA Request at 1–\n                                               12\n\f2. DoEd thus had no obligation to produce the documents in any particular format. Moreover,\n\nas the Bashford Declaration establishes, see I Bashford Decl. ¶¶ 7, 16, DoEd’s email records are\n\nnot “readily reproducible” in electronic format, and the DoEd email retention system “will not\n\ndisplay or print” the BCC field “for any retrieved email.” See Sample v. Bureau of Prisons, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1086</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1088 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (holding that an agency’s “determination as to reproducibility\n\nmust be accorded ‘substantial weight’ by the reviewing court”); accord 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B).\n\n              Notwithstanding CREW’s failure to request a specific format and DoEd’s\n\ninability to produce the requested data electronically, CREW invites the Court to find that a\n\ngovernment agency must produce electronic copies and/or metadata to comply with FOIA. The\n\nCourt declines because it does not see here in CREW’s argument any basis to impose an\n\nelectronic copy obligation on a federal agency. The copying charge which FOIA imposes, see 5\n\nU.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A), indicates that Congress anticipated that agencies would produce hard\n\npaper copies of all records requested, particularly when not otherwise requested and readily\n\nreproducible. CREW’s argument that it is entitled to metadata and blind copy addresses of all\n\nemails, when that information cannot be readily produced by DoEd, fails as a matter of law. The\n\nargument would require the creation of documentation rather than the production of what exists.\n\nIn addition, there is no legitimate basis to suspect the scope or good faith basis of DoEd’s\n\nresponses here. See SafeCard Servs., 926 F.2d at 1200 (holding that a FOIA requester cannot\n\nrebut an agency’s affidavits with “purely speculative claims about the existence and\n\ndiscoverability of other documents” (quoting Ground Saucer Watch, Inc. v.

Department-wide Email Search Only in March 2011\n\n              CREW finds it suspicious that DoEd only searched a Department-wide database\n\nfor emails in March 2011 when that database existed as early as April 2009, albeit offsite and\n                                               13\n\fcontrolled by a vendor.     Pl. Opp. at 21–23.       DoEd has explained that Department policy\n\nprevented a general search of employee email by Departmental employees prior to February\n\n2011 and that it conducted such a search soon after it was authorized. See I Bashford Decl.\n\n¶¶ 10–11.\n\n               The Court need not pause to consider when an agency’s reliance on a vendor to\n\nhouse and maintain agency email provides a reason not to search email to answer a FOIA\n\nrequest. What is clear is that DoEd has, in fact, searched all email from April 2009 going\n\nforward, covering all email received and sent by anyone in the Department.             See id. ¶ 11\n\n(referring to “agency-wide electronic searches for email responsive to [CREW’s FOIA\n\nRequest]”). The production of such email to CREW moots the question. See Nw. Univ. v.

Cir. 1992) (citations and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted).\n\n               CREW’s only argument is that DoEd “no longer needs the confidentiality\n\nafforded by Exemption 5” because it has issued its final regulations regarding gainful\n\nemployment, the subject about which CREW filed its FOIA Request. Pl. MSJ at 11. The\n\nargument has no merit.\n\n               The first flaw in CREW’s argument is that the records withheld by DoEd pursuant\n\nto Exemption 5 were dated in 2010, well before the regulations were made final in June 2011.\n\nSee Def. MSJ, Ex. J [Dkt. 17-3] (Vaughn Index). The records were thus predecisional in the\n\nplainest sense of the word. See N.L.R.B., 421 U.S. at 151–52 (“[C]ourts have uniformly drawn a\n\ndistinction between predecisional communications, which are privileged, and communications\n\nmade after the decision and designed to explain it, which are not.” (internal citations omitted)).\n\nMoreover, the Vaughn Index submitted by DoEd demonstrates that the documents fit\n\ncomfortably within Exemption 5 due to their role in DoEd’s deliberative process. See, e.g.,\n\nVaughn Index at 24 (describing “an inter-agency communication between senior Department\n\nofficials regarding developing an approach to managing external communications related to for-\n\nprofit education during the development of the proposed Gainful Employment rule”).\n\n               CREW does not assert that any of the documents postdated the issuance of the\n\nregulations, relying solely on the argument that the documents have now lost their\n\n“predecisional” character. Pl. MSJ at 11. But the later issuance of a regulation does nothing to\n\nchange the nature of the documents themselves. As long as records are “part of the deliberative\n\nprocess by which a decision is made,” they are exempt from disclosure.

Although predecisional documents may lose their protection if\n\n“adopted, formally or informally, as the agency position on an issue or is used by the agency in\n\nits dealings with the public,” id. (quoting Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 866), CREW has not made\n\nthat argument in this case and it has no record support, as the Vaughn Index shows. The Court\n\nconcludes that DoEd properly withheld certain documents pursuant to Exemption 5 and that the\n\nJune 2011 issuance of final regulations did not affect the applicability of that exemption.\n\n                                     IV.     CONCLUSION\n\n               CREW attempts to question the good faith of DoEd’s response to its FOIA\n\nrequest because of outside news articles and the segmented nature of DoEd’s production. The\n\nonly substantive challenge advanced by CREW concerned Exemption 5 and is clearly without\n\nmerit.   At the point of summary judgment, DoEd has explained its search, the reasons it\n\ncontinued to produce responsive documents, and its results in fully adequate fashion. The\n\nDepartment’s motion for summary judgment, Dkt. 17, will be granted and CREW’s cross motion\n\nfor partial summary judgment, Dkt. 19, will be denied.
