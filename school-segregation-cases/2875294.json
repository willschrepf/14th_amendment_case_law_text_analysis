GIBSON, Circuit Judges.\n\n                                  ___________\n\nJOHN R. GIBSON, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n        The State of Missouri appeals from orders of the district court1\nestablishing a remedy plan and budget for the 1996-97 school year in the\nongoing Kansas City, Missouri School District desegregation case.         The\nState also appeals from the district court's order phasing out the Missouri\nCity voluntary interdistrict transfer program.       The Jenkins Class cross-\nappeals from the order phasing out the Missouri City program and from the\norder\n\n\n\n\n        1\n      The Honorable Russell G. Clark, Senior Judge, United States\nDistrict Court for the Western District of Missouri.\n\n                                     -7-\n\fprohibiting use of desegregation funds for marketing and recruitment\nefforts directed solely at nonminority students living within the KCMSD who\nattend private and parochial schools.         We affirm the district court's order\nwith respect to the budget for the 1996-97 school year, remand the Missouri\nCity Program issue for further consideration, and reverse and remand the\norder relating to recruiting resident nonminorities who attend private\nschools.2\n\n\n        In Missouri v. Jenkins, 115 S. Ct. 2038 (1995) (Jenkins III), the\nCourt reversed an order funding salary increases for KCMSD personnel, which\nthe     district    court   had   imposed    to   increase   KCMSD's   desegregative\nattractiveness.       Id. at 2055.    The Court also reversed an order funding\nquality education programs because the order was based on findings that the\nstudent achievement levels were at or below national norms based on test\nscores.       The Supreme Court remanded for reconsideration of the quality\neducation order under the three-part test of Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S.\n467, 491 (1992).       It further instructed that the district court \"bear in\nmind that its end purpose is not only `to remedy the violation' to the\nextent practicable, but also `to restore state and local authorities to the\ncontrol of a school system that is operating in compliance with the\nConstitution.'\"       Id. at 2056 (quoting Freeman, 503 U.S. at 489).\n\n\n        After the Supreme Court's remand, the State moved for an order\ndeclaring the KCMSD unitary and relinquishing jurisdiction over the entire\ncase.       Moreover, on May 21, 1996, the State and the KCMSD entered into an\nagreement that the State would continue to make\n\n\n\n\n        2\n     The orders on appeal are the July 15, 1996 order with respect\nto the 1996-97 budget; the order of August 30, 1996, denying stay\npending appeal; and the March 7, 1996 order, disapproving the use\nof funds for the purpose of recruiting resident nonminorities and\nestablishing a phaseout plan for the Missouri City Voluntary\nInterdistrict Transfer Plan. The Jenkins Class moved to alter or\namend this order, and the district court denied the motion on May\n31, 1996.\n\n                                            -8-\n\fpayments over the next three years, with its liability to end at that time,\nsubject to court approval.          The Jenkins class was not a party to the\nagreement.     In light of the magnitude of the issues raised by the\nunitariness motion and the settlement agreement, the district court set\nboth matters for a hearing to commence on January 13, 1997.\n\n\n     In the interim a budget for the upcoming 1996-97 school year was\nestablished.   The parties were able for the most part to agree on a budget\nas an interim measure.      The parties agreed to a 1996-97 remedy plan and\nbudget that reduced the KCMSD budget to $35 million below the preceding\nyear, subject to a list of items on which the Jenkins Class disagreed with\nthe other parties regarding the necessity of expenditures.                That list\nincluded three of the budget items at issue in this appeal: the fourth-\nround budget cuts, the extended day program, and the permanent substitutes.\nThe parties agreed that although there would have to be a hearing to\nresolve the disputed budget issues, the weighty issues raised by the\nSupreme   Court   opinion   would    be   reserved   for   later   resolution.   In\nparticular, the parties agreed:\n\n           Certain parties contend that the State and the KCMSD have\n     a continuing obligation to eliminate the remaining effects of\n     de jure segregation to the extent practicable.        The State\n     denies that there are such remaining effects.       All parties\n     agree that they will not present any evidence at the June 1996\n     hearing on this issue, that no findings will be requested on\n     this issue, that the Court need not enter any findings on this\n     issue for the purpose of resolving the disputes among the\n     parties or ordering implementation of any desegregation\n     remedies proposed by any of the parties for the 1996-97 school\n     year, and that no party will challenge any remedy component\n     currently requested by any party and ordered by the Court for\n     the 1996-97 school year on that basis.\n\n     The district court generally approved this stipulation, but the\n court disapproved the agreement to reserve consideration of the Missouri\n City transfer program and the expenditure of funds for advertising aimed\n at nonminority private and parochial school\n\n\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fstudents within the KCMSD.         The court found that it was in the best\ninterests of all the parties to resolve those two issues sooner, rather\nthan later.      Order of March 7, 1996, slip op. at 2.             Therefore, the\ncourt     did   not   consider   those   two    issues   to   be   subject   to   the\nStipulation.\n\n\n     In considering the Missouri City transfer program, the district\ncourt concluded that the program was a type of interdistrict relief not\npermitted by the Supreme Court's reasoning in Jenkins III.             Slip op. at\n3.   However, the district court found it necessary and equitable to take\ninto account the interests of the students who had volunteered to be a\npart of the transfer program and whose educations would be disrupted by\nan abrupt termination of the program.           Id. at 4-5.    The court held:\n\n\n     Balancing the interests of the participants with those of the\n     State, the Court finds that equity requires that the present\n     participants in the program be allowed to remain with present\n     State funding per pupil until they graduate the eighth grade\n     or voluntarily leave the program. The Court believes this\n     process of winding down the Missouri City program resolves the\n     difficulties of this situation in a reasonable equitable\n     manner.\n\n\nId. at 5.\n\n\n     The court next considered the permissibility of using desegregation\nfunds for advertising aimed at attracting nonminority students who\nreside in the KCMSD but attend private or parochial schools.             The court\nheld:     \"The State is correct that Jenkins III forecloses the use of\ndesegregation funds for recruitment efforts where the sole purpose of\nthe particular recruitment project is aimed at encouraging resident\nnonminorities currently in private or parochial schools to enroll in the\nKCMSD.\"     Id. at 5.    The court held, however, that the recruitment and\nmarketing department of the KCMSD still had a legitimate function in\nencouraging voluntary transfer of students\n\n\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fwithin the KCMSD itself to magnet schools.    Id. at 6-7.    To the extent\nthat this sort of advertising reaches nonminority private and parochial\nstudents incidentally, it is of no legal import.    Id. at 7.    The court\ntherefore approved the proposed budget item for the recruiting and\nmarketing department, but ordered that the department should not direct\nany efforts solely at recruiting nonminority students who reside in the\nKCMSD but attend private schools.    Id. at 7-8.   The court also stated\nthat it considered the State to have waived any objection to this item\nfor the 1996-97 school year by the terms of the Stipulation.    Id. at 7.\n\n\n     In a later order, the district court reached the items that had\nbeen reserved for its consideration by the terms of the Stipulation.\nThe court considered the Jenkins Class's proposal to restore funding for\nthe extended day program, less $1 million the Jenkins Class estimated\nthe KCMSD could collect by charging fees for enrollment in the program\nfor children who do not qualify for free or reduced price lunch.     Order\nof July 15, 1996, slip op. at 8.   The court ruled that the extended day\nprogram should be preserved.   The court explicitly based its holding on\nthe state of the record before it, stating:\n\n\n    Plaintiffs presented substantial evidence in support of the\n    current Extended Day Program. The KCMSD does not dispute the\n    sincerity or accuracy of the testimony elicited by plaintiffs.\n    . . . The Court was presented no evidence that the Extended\n    Day Program as a whole has become ineffective or is an\n    improper component of a desegregation remedy.\n\n\nId. at 9.   The court rejected the idea of charging fees for the program\nbased on financial need; since the program was intended to remedy\nconstitutional violations suffered on account of race, not on account of\nfinancial status, the Jenkins Class's proposal would result in charging\nsome victims for a remedy to which they were entitled.      Id. at 9-10.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\f     Next, the court considered the Jenkins Class's objections to the\n fourth-round budget cuts.       KCMSD had proposed budget cuts in layers,\n with the first three rounds of cuts being the responsibility of the\n administration at the affected schools.      The final, or fourth, round of\n budget cuts was imposed by the KCMSD administration, in some cases over\n the protest of the school principals.          Again, the court based its\n decision on the testimony before it.     Principals of some of the affected\n          3\n schools testified that the fourth-round cuts would damage the integrity\n of their schools' magnet themes.         Id. at 11.    Therefore, the court\n ordered the fourth-round budget cuts to be reinstated at those seven\n schools.     Id.   Not all principals were called to testify.   Consequently,\n the court was unable to make determinations about the advisability of\n the fourth-round budget cuts at the schools whose principals did not\n testify, and directed the Desegregation Monitoring Committee to evaluate\n whether the cuts should be made at those schools.       Id. at 11-12.\n     The Jenkins Class also proposed that the KCMSD be required to\n maintain permanent substitutes at each of the district's schools.         The\n court found that permanent substitutes were not generally necessary\n except in the foreign language magnets.           These schools depend on\n immersion in the foreign language, which entails teaching substantive\n courses in the foreign language.       Because of the difficulty in finding\n substitutes qualified to conduct classes in the various languages, the\n court found it appropriate that permanent substitutes be retained at the\n language magnets.      Id. at 13.\n\n\n\n\n      3\n       The schools were Trailwoods Elementary, Knotts Elementary,\nNorth Rock Creek/Korte, J.A. Rogers Middle School, Kansas City\nMiddle School for the Performing Arts, the Foreign Language Middle\nSchool, and East High School.\n\n                                      -12-\n\f                                    I.\n\n\n                                    A.\n\n\n    The State attacks the district court's reinstatement of the extended\nday program, the fourth-round budget cuts in the seven schools, and the\npermanent substitutes in the foreign language magnets.          The State\ncontends that these expenditures violate the command of Jenkins III to\nconsider the interest in local autonomy and to limit the aim of remedial\nprograms to restoring the victims of de jure segregation to the position\nthey would have occupied absent the constitutional violation.        These\narguments depend on antecedent assumptions or findings about what\nvestiges of injury remain in the KCMSD.     The State stipulated away its\nright to make this sort of argument at this stage of the litigation in\nits agreement limiting the issues to be decided in connection with the\n1996-97 budget:\n\n\n         Certain parties contend that the State and the KCMSD have\n    a continuing obligation to eliminate the remaining effects of\n    de jure segregation to the extent practicable.       The State\n    denies that there are such remaining effects. All parties\n    agree that they will not present any evidence at the June 1996\n    hearing on this issue, that no findings will be requested on\n    this issue, that the Court need not enter any findings on this\n    issue for the purpose of resolving the disputes among the\n    parties or ordering implementation of any desegregation\n    remedies proposed by any of the parties for the 1996-97 school\n    year . . . .\n\n\n    The effect of the Stipulation was before us on the motion to stay.\nWe there held the issue raised by the State to be foreclosed by the\nStipulation.   Order of October 23, 1996.   We have given further detailed\nstudy to the terms of the Stipulation and reach the same conclusion as\nwe did before.\n\n\n    By arguing that Jenkins III requires the district court to take\naction without regard to the existence and extent of\n\n\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fvestiges of segregation, the State shows an imperfect understanding of\nthe Jenkins III holding.         The reasoning in Jenkins III depends on a\nframework of three factors that must be balanced against each other in\ncrafting a desegregation remedy under Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267,\n280-81 (1977) (Milliken II): (1) the nature of the remedy must be\ndetermined by the nature and scope of the constitutional violation; (2)\nthe decree must remedy the unconstitutional condition by restoring the\nvictims as nearly as possible to the position they would have occupied\nhad the violation never taken place; and (3) the decree must take into\naccount the importance of state and local autonomy.           115 S. Ct. at 2049.\nThe Supreme Court emphasized that        remedial orders should not be crafted\ntaking the first factor into consideration without adequate regard for\nthe second two.       Id.    This certainly does not lead to the conclusion\nthat such orders can be crafted only by reference to the third factor,\nwithout consideration of the first two factors.              Yet, the State would\nhave us assess the propriety of the three disputed programs in light of\nJenkins III when the State has stipulated that the court shall make no\nfindings with regard to the second factor, whether there exists vestiges\nof   the   unconstitutional     condition.      The   Supreme     Court    ordered   a\nbalancing process; the State asks us to carry out that process with only\none side of the scale.       This is impossible, and would be erroneous under\nJenkins III.\n\n\n     Despite its Stipulation, the State argues that the court erred in\nordering    relief    that    benefits    students    who   are     not   victims    of\nsegregation.    This assumes the very fact that the State stipulated would\nnot be resolved--whether there exist to this day vestiges or after-\neffects    of   the   unconstitutional     system    that   still    affect   student\nachievement levels in the KCMSD.             The Supreme Court mentioned that\nstudents in kindergarten through grade 7 have always attended AAA\nschools, and that the older students have received remedial education\nprograms for up to seven years.            Jenkins III,      115 S. Ct. at 2056.\nHowever, the\n\n\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\fSupreme Court did not say that there were no remaining victims of the\nafter-effects of segregation.         Rather, the Court remanded for further\nproceedings.   \"But these are questions that the Court rightly leaves to\nbe answered on remand.\"     Id. at 2061.      (O'Connor, J., concurring).    The\nState's inference that the Supreme Court considered the State's work\ndone and the KCMSD unitary is grossly premature, as well as inconsistent\nwith the Stipulation, which acknowledged this to be a disputed question.\nUntil we know the answer to that question, we certainly cannot say which\nstudents are affected by vestiges of segregation and in what way.\nConsequently, the State's contention that the district court's orders\nbenefited non-victims begs the question by assuming that we know who the\nremaining victims are.\n\n\n    In light of the Stipulation which the State entered and the district\ncourt approved, we can only view the 1996-97 budget as an interim\nmeasure.   Clearly, the matter had to be resolved before the school year\nand yet, a full adjudication of the constitutional questions inherent in\nthe matter would require hearings and findings which could not be\nachieved before the school year began.        In response to this dilemma, the\nparties    entered   into   the   Stipulation   reserving   the   constitutional\nquestions for a later day.        With this compromise before it, the district\ncourt acted properly in judging the propriety of the disputed programs\nby criteria that remained available after the Stipulation.           In the case\nof the fourth-round budget cuts and the permanent substitutes, the court\ndecided that doing away with the particular programs would undermine the\nmagnet themes.       In the case of the extended day program, it decided\nsimply that the program was beneficial to the students.             The Supreme\nCourt certainly did not disapprove either of the idea of magnet schools,\nsee Jenkins III, 115 S. Ct. at 2051 (\"We previously have approved of\nintradistrict desegregation remedies involving magnet schools\"), or of\nimproving the quality of education offered in the district, see id. at\n2050 (\"Thus, the proper response by the\n\n\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fDistrict Court should have been to eliminate to the extent practicable\nthe vestiges of prior de jure segregation within the KCMSD: a system-\nwide reduction in student achievement and the existence of 25 racially\nidentifiable schools. . . .\").          The Supreme Court only held that the\nappropriateness of orders pursuing those goals must be ascertained by\nbalancing all three Milliken II factors, and the State stipulated that\nthe   district    court   would   not   determine   one   of   those   factors   in\nadjudicating the propriety of the three programs in question.\n\n\n      In sum, the State's arguments attacking the approval of the three\ndisputed programs for the 1996-97 year depend on a reasoning process\nthat the district court could not complete because of the parties'\nStipulation.     The district court appropriately considered the propriety\nof those programs as an interim measure, as was contemplated by the\nparties' agreement.       We therefore affirm the district court's order\nregarding the extended day program, permanent substitutes in the foreign\nlanguage magnets, and the restoration of the fourth-round budget cuts in\nthe seven schools.\n\n\n                                         B.\n\n\n      The State argues that the record evidence showed the extended day\nprogram is \"just babysitting,\" and that therefore its only possible\npurpose is to attract suburban students.       While the extended day program\nundeniably serves a child care function, there was a great deal of\ntestimony before the court that the program also serves an educational\npurpose.    We have reviewed the testimony the State cites, and it\ncertainly does not compel the conclusion that the extended day program\nonly exists to attract suburban students.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\f                                             C.\n\n\n       The State also argues that the district court's order of July 15,\n1996 contravenes Jenkins III, and that the district court's authority is\nsimply to execute the mandate of Jenkins III.                          It argues that by\nordering the three disputed programs the district court has refused to\nfollow the Supreme Court's mandate that the process of returning KCMSD\nto local control begin in earnest.\n       The State argues that Jenkins III requires restoration of local\ncontrol at the earliest practical date.                  The argument is based on the\nState's reading of Jenkins III that \"the District Court must bear in\nmind    that   its   end     purpose   is   .   .   .    to    restore   state    and   local\nauthorities to . . . control,\" 115 S. Ct. at 2056 (quotation omitted).\nThe State argues that the Supreme Court emphasized the vital national\ntradition of local autonomy of school districts and ordered that no\nadditional programs be imposed that unwarrantably postpone the day when\nKCMSD will be able to operate on its own.                    Id. at 2056.\n\n\n       The shortcoming of the State's argument is that it edits the\nlanguage of the Supreme Court in a manner that presents less than a full\nand fair reading of the Court's holding.                      The Court in Jenkins III\ncertainly      refers   to    the   restoration         of    local   control    on   several\noccasions, see, e.g., id. at 2054, 2056, and the Court emphasizes the\ngoal of returning the school district to local control, but the other\npart of the equation is that the district court must consider whether\nthe previously segregated district has achieved partial unitary status.\nJenkins III points out that the State had not sought a declaration of\npartial unitary status with respect to quality education programs.                       Id.\nat 2055.       In rejecting arguments relating to whether national norms\ncould be considered in evaluating the success of educational programs\nthe Supreme Court stated:\n\n\n\n\n                                            -17-\n\f            But this clearly is not the appropriate test to be\n      applied in deciding whether a previously segregated district\n      has achieved partially unitary status. See Freeman, 503 U.S.\n      at 491; Dowell, 498 U.S. at 249-50. The basic task of the\n      District Court is to decide whether the reduction in\n      achievement by minority students attributable to prior de jure\n      segregation has been remedied to the extent practicable. . . .\n\n            In reconsidering this order, the District Court should\n      apply our three-part test from Freeman v. Pitts, supra, 503 U.\n      S., at 491, 112 S. Ct., at 1445-1446.\n\n\nId.   The three-part test for partial unitariness was stated in Freeman\nv. Pitts, 503 U.S. at 491:\n\n            A court's discretion to order the incremental withdrawal\n      of its supervision in a school desegregation case must be\n      exercised in a manner consistent with the purposes and\n      objectives of its equitable power. Among the factors which\n      must inform the sound discretion of the court in ordering\n      partial withdrawal are the following: whether there has been\n      full and satisfactory compliance with the decree in those\n      aspects of the system where supervision is to be withdrawn;\n      whether retention of judicial control is necessary or\n      practicable to achieve compliance with the decree in other\n      facets of the school system; and whether the school district\n      has demonstrated, to the public and to the parents and\n      students of the once disfavored race, its good-faith\n      commitment to the whole of the court's decree and to those\n      provisions of the law and the Constitution that were the\n      predicate for judicial intervention in the first instance.\n\n\n      Jenkins III concludes:\n\n\n            On remand, the District Court must bear in mind that its\n      end purpose is not only \"to remedy the violation\" to the\n      extent practicable, but also \"to restore state and local\n      authorities to the control of a school system that is\n      operating in compliance with the Constitution.\" Freeman, 503\n      U.S. at 489.\n\n\n115 S. Ct. at 2056.\n\n\n      The last passage above demonstrates that the State, in\n\n\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fstressing the return to local control, has completely ignored the\nCourt's direction to engage in the inquiry required by Freeman v. Pitts,\nto ascertain whether unitary status has been achieved, whether the\nresults of segregation have been remedied to the extent practicable, and\nwhether a school system operating in compliance with the Constitution\nmay be restored to state and local control.\n\n\n     We thus reject the argument the State makes that Jenkins III has\nmandated determination of the issues now before us.            The Supreme Court\nhas made clear in Jenkins III that the State did not seek a declaration\nof   partial   unitary   status   with    respect   to   the   quality   education\nprograms, 115 S. Ct. at 2055, but rather that the case now must be\nreturned to the district court to make that inquiry.\n\n\n     In view of the parties' stipulation and the Supreme Court's remand\nto the district court to consider the question of unitary status under\nFreeman, it is not necessary that we reach the merits of the arguments\nadvanced by the State.\n\n\n                                         II.\n\n\n     The Jenkins Class cross-appeals, arguing that the district court\nerred in prohibiting the use of desegregation funds for marketing and\nrecruitment efforts directed solely at drawing private school students\nliving within the KCMSD boundaries.            In its orders of March 7, 1996,\nslip op. at 5-7, and May 31, 1996, slip op. at 2-3, the district court\nruled that the desegregative attractiveness discussion in Jenkins III\nforbade use of desegregation funding to recruit nonminority private\nschool students living within the KCMSD, as well as to recruit suburban\nnonminorities.   The district court reasoned that \"private and parochial\nschools are essentially districts within themselves,\" slip op. at 6, and\nthat therefore spending desegregation money to\n\n\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\frecruit     students     from    those        schools    was   based     upon   the    same\nimpermissible interdistrict goals as recruiting students from suburban\npublic school districts.         Id.\n\n\n    The Jenkins Class argues that the district court drew incorrect\ninferences    from     Jenkins   III     in    considering     private    schools     to    be\nequivalent to other public school districts.                The Class argues that the\nreason the Supreme Court disapproved of interdistrict relief was to\navoid     \"burdening    other     public       school    districts     which    were       not\nconstitutional       violators,     not        [to   protect]    independent        private\nentities.\"     The Class also points out that the district court ruled\nbefore these issues had been thoroughly briefed.\n\n\n    We first must concede that the record with respect to this issue may\nhave been most generally developed with respect to the differences\nbetween private and parochial schools and public schools, and we have\nquestions with respect to whether they are \"essentially districts within\nthemselves\" as found by the district court.                 We believe, however, that\nthis issue can be addressed again with a more complete record on remand.\n\n\n    We conclude that the legal underpinning in the district court's\nanalysis runs contrary to Jenkins III.                  Jenkins III discussed at some\nlength the difference between intradistrict violations and interdistrict\nviolations, and the remedies that may be appropriate for each.                        115 S.\nCt. at 2049-54.      It concluded that the interdistrict goal of attracting\nstudents from surrounding districts was an interdistrict remedy for an\nintradistrict violation.         Id. at 2052.\n\n\n    The following passages from Jenkins III demonstrate the basis for\nthe Court's ruling:\n\n\n\n\n                                              -20-\n\f           What we meant in Milliken I [Milliken v. Bradley, 418\n     U.S. 717 (1974)] by an interdistrict violation was a violation\n     that caused segregation between adjoining districts.\n\n\n 115 S. Ct. at 2052.   In Jenkins III, the Supreme Court said that nothing\n in Milliken I suggested that the district court could have required the\n State of Michigan to implement a magnet program designed to achieve the\n same interdistrict transfer of students that Milliken I had held to be\n beyond its remedial authority.      115 S. Ct. at 2052.      Jenkins III\n continued:\n\n\n     Here, the District Court has done just that: created a magnet\n     district of the KCMSD in order to serve the interdistrict goal\n     of attracting nonminority students from the surrounding SSD's\n     and redistributing them within the KCMSD.        The District\n     Court's pursuit of \"desegregative attractiveness\" is beyond\n     the scope of its broad remedial authority.4\n\n\n     4\n      Jenkins III also made the following statements:\n\n          The purpose of desegregative attractiveness has been\n     not only to remedy the system-wide reduction in student\n     achievement, but also to attract nonminority students not\n     presently enrolled in the KCMSD. . . .\n\n                                   . . .\n\n          The District Court's remedial plan in this case,\n     however, is not designed solely to redistribute the\n     students within the KCMSD in order to eliminate racially\n     identifiable schools within the KCMSD.      Instead, its\n     purpose is to attract nonminority students from outside\n     the KCMSD schools. But this interdistrict goal is beyond\n     the scope of the intradistrict violation identified by\n     the District Court. In effect, the District Court has\n     devised a remedy to accomplish indirectly what it\n     admittedly lacks the remedial authority to mandate\n     directly: the interdistrict transfer of students. 639\n     F. Supp. at 38    (\"`[B]ecause of restrictions on this\n     Court's remedial powers in restructuring the operations\n     of local and state government entities,' any mandatory\n     plan which would go beyond the boundary lines of KCMSD\n     goes far beyond the nature and extent of the\n     constitutional violation [that] this Court found\nexisted\").\n\n\n                                   -21-\n\fId. at 2052 (second emphasis added).       The Supreme Court then discussed\n the issue of white flight and concluded:\n\n\n     The record here does not support the District Court's reliance\n     on \"white flight\" as a justification for a permissible\n     expansion of its intradistrict remedial authority through its\n     pursuit of desegregative attractiveness.\n\n\n 115 S. Ct. at 2053.\n\n\n     This language from Jenkins III indicates that the remedy cannot be\n designed to recruit students from adjoining districts to the Kansas City\n schools in an effort to remedy intradistrict violations.   We do not read\n Jenkins III as restricting the KCMSD's efforts to attract back to its\n schools those residents of the district who now attend private and\n parochial schools.    As the Jenkins Class points out, the funding for the\n schools under the state procedures is based upon enrollment, and an\n increase in enrollment is in the best interest of KCMSD.           As the\n district court discussed, efforts directed at KCMSD students may have an\n impact on KCMSD resident students in parochial and private schools.\n Slip op. at 7.   As pointed out by Justice O'Connor, such effects are of\n no consequence.      See Jenkins III, 115 S. Ct. at 2060 (O'Connor, J.,\nconcurring).\n\n\n     Thus, we conclude that the district court's analysis rested on a\nquestionable reading of Jenkins III, and we remand this\n\n\n\n\n          In Milliken I we determined that a desegregation\n     remedy that would require mandatory interdistrict\n     reassignment   of  students   throughout  the   Detroit\n     metropolitan area was an impermissible interdistrict\n     response to the intradistrict violation identified.\n\n115 S. Ct. at 2051 (emphasis in last paragraph added).\n\n                                    -22-\n\fissue for further consideration.\n\n\n                                        III.\n\n\n      The State argues that the district court abused its discretion in\nordering continued funding of the Missouri City Interdistrict Transfer\nProgram for eight additional years, because it is an impermissible\ninterdistrict remedy in this intradistrict case.              The Jenkins Class\nargues that the district court erred in ordering the phaseout of the\nprogram.   Only thirteen students participate in this program.             No other\nsuburban schools have accepted minority students from KCMSD.\n\n\n      The district court's order of March 7, 1996, recognizes that the\nMissouri   City    Program    is   an   interdistrict   program   based     upon   a\nstipulation, and that this stipulation can be modified by changing\ncircumstances, such as those provided by the Supreme Court opinion in\nJenkins III.      Slip op. at 4 (citing Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County\nJail, 502 U.S. 367, 390 (1992)).        The district court, however, looked to\nthe limits of this responsibility to determine whether the proposed\nmodification is suitably tailored to the changing circumstances.              Slip\nop. at 4-5.       In doing so, it rejected the State's argument that the\nprogram should be discontinued after one year, but looked to the public\ninterest in seeing the State honor its agreements made on the public's\nbehalf.     The    district   court     therefore   ordered   that   the   present\nparticipants in the program be allowed to remain with present state\nfunding until they graduate eighth grade or voluntarily leave the\nprogram.\n\n\n      The State's argument that the court lacks authority to order such\na program is somewhat weakened by its admission in oral argument that\nthe   district court should discontinue the program with reasonable\npromptness, at most the completion of the school year in question.             The\nState's position at least approaches a\n\n\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\fconcession that the district court may determine what is reasonable\npromptness, and the proper length of the phaseout.\n\n\n    The State makes a robust argument that Jenkins III bars such\ninterdistrict remedies.    On the other hand, the legal underpinning in\nthe past has been that voluntary plans can be a part of an intradistrict\nremedy and that the burden can be placed on the constitutional violator,\nin this instance, the State of Missouri.\n\n\n    The Missouri City order was entered on March 7, 1996, one of the\nfirst orders entered by the court following Jenkins III, and it was not\nthoroughly briefed.   While the State had filed a motion for declaration\nof unitary status by March 7, the State had not made an effort to call\nfor a hearing on this issue.   After the March 1996 order, the State and\nKCMSD entered a proposed agreement for a three-year phaseout of the\ndesegregation remedy, subject to court approval.     Both the unitariness\nand settlement matters were set for hearing.\n\n\n    Under these circumstances, we deem it unnecessary to discuss the\narguments in further detail.     In view of the State's concession that\nsome reasonable phaseout is authorized, we think it appropriate to\nremand this issue to the district court for further consideration after\nthe hearing concerning unitary status and the proposed settlement.\n\n\n                                  . . .\n\n\n    The opinion of the Supreme Court in Jenkins III gave specific\ndirections to the district court to reconsider the order on quality\neducation programs under the three-part test from Freeman v. Pitts.   The\nCourt makes clear the necessity for detailed and specific findings by\nthe district court and that it identify the incremental effect that\nsegregation has had on minority student\n\n\n\n\n                                  -24-\n\fachievement, and the specific goals of the quality education programs.\n115 S. Ct. at 2055.     It further instructed that the district court\nshould \"sharply limit, if not dispense with, its reliance\" on improved\nachievement on test scores.        Id.    It cautioned that the quality\neducation programs should be tailored to remedy the injuries suffered by\nthe victims of prior de jure segregation.     Id. at 2056.\n\n\n    We think it also appropriate to observe the comment of Justice\nO'Connor, who joined in the opinion of the Court, but in her concurring\nopinion noted that the Court refrained from addressing the propriety of\nall the remedies the district court has ordered, revised, and extended\nin the eighteen-year-old history of the case.     While these remedies may\nbe improper to the extent that they serve the goals of desegregative\nattractiveness   and   suburban   comparability   that   were   held   to   be\nimpermissible, \"conversely, the District Court may be able to justify\nsome remedies without reliance on these goals.     But these are questions\nthat the Court rightly leaves to be answered on remand.\"        115 S. Ct. at\n2061 (O'Connor, J., concurring).\n\n\n    We therefore affirm the district court's disposition of the 1996-97\nbudget issues, and reverse and remand on the private school recruiting\nissue and the Missouri City transfer program issue.\n\n\n     A true copy.\n\n\n           Attest:\n\n\n                 CLERK, U. S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -25-\n\f",

GIBSON, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n        The State of Missouri appeals from orders of the district court1\nestablishing a remedy plan and budget for the 1996-97 school year in the\nongoing Kansas City, Missouri School District desegregation case.         The\nState also appeals from the district court's order phasing out the Missouri\nCity voluntary interdistrict transfer program.       The Jenkins Class cross-\nappeals from the order phasing out the Missouri City program and from the\norder\n\n\n\n\n        1\n      The Honorable Russell G. Clark, Senior Judge, United States\nDistrict Court for the Western District of Missouri.\n\n                                     -7-\n\fprohibiting use of desegregation funds for marketing and recruitment\nefforts directed solely at nonminority students living within the KCMSD who\nattend private and parochial schools.         We affirm the district court's order\nwith respect to the budget for the 1996-97 school year, remand the Missouri\nCity Program issue for further consideration, and reverse and remand the\norder relating to recruiting resident nonminorities who attend private\nschools.2\n\n\n        In Missouri v. Jenkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117944\"><a href=\"/opinion/117944/missouri-v-jenkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Id. at 2055.    The Court also reversed an order funding\nquality education programs because the order was based on findings that the\nstudent achievement levels were at or below national norms based on test\nscores.       The Supreme Court remanded for reconsideration of the quality\neducation order under the three-part test of Freeman v. Pitts, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112718\"><a href=\"/opinion/112718/freeman-v-pitts/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 491 (1992).       It further instructed that the district court \"bear in\nmind that its end purpose is not only `to remedy the violation' to the\nextent practicable, but also `to restore state and local authorities to the\ncontrol of a school system that is operating in compliance with the\nConstitution.'\"       Id. at 2056 (quoting Freeman, 503 U.S. at 489).\n\n\n        After the Supreme Court's remand, the State moved for an order\ndeclaring the KCMSD unitary and relinquishing jurisdiction over the entire\ncase.       Moreover, on May 21, 1996, the State and the KCMSD entered into an\nagreement that the State would continue to make\n\n\n\n\n        2\n     The orders on appeal are the July 15, 1996 order with respect\nto the 1996-97 budget; the order of August 30, 1996, denying stay\npending appeal; and the March 7, 1996 order, disapproving the use\nof funds for the purpose of recruiting resident nonminorities and\nestablishing a phaseout plan for the Missouri City Voluntary\nInterdistrict Transfer Plan. The Jenkins Class moved to alter or\namend this order, and the district court denied the motion on May\n31, 1996.\n\n                                            -8-\n\fpayments over the next three years, with its liability to end at that time,\nsubject to court approval.          The Jenkins class was not a party to the\nagreement.     In light of the magnitude of the issues raised by the\nunitariness motion and the settlement agreement, the district court set\nboth matters for a hearing to commence on January 13, 1997.\n\n\n     In the interim a budget for the upcoming 1996-97 school year was\nestablished.   The parties were able for the most part to agree on a budget\nas an interim measure.      The parties agreed to a 1996-97 remedy plan and\nbudget that reduced the KCMSD budget to $35 million below the preceding\nyear, subject to a list of items on which the Jenkins Class disagreed with\nthe other parties regarding the necessity of expenditures.                That list\nincluded three of the budget items at issue in this appeal: the fourth-\nround budget cuts, the extended day program, and the permanent substitutes.\nThe parties agreed that although there would have to be a hearing to\nresolve the disputed budget issues, the weighty issues raised by the\nSupreme   Court   opinion   would    be   reserved   for   later   resolution.   In\nparticular, the parties agreed:\n\n           Certain parties contend that the State and the KCMSD have\n     a continuing obligation to eliminate the remaining effects of\n     de jure segregation to the extent practicable.        The State\n     denies that there are such remaining effects.       All parties\n     agree that they will not present any evidence at the June 1996\n     hearing on this issue, that no findings will be requested on\n     this issue, that the Court need not enter any findings on this\n     issue for the purpose of resolving the disputes among the\n     parties or ordering implementation of any desegregation\n     remedies proposed by any of the parties for the 1996-97 school\n     year, and that no party will challenge any remedy component\n     currently requested by any party and ordered by the Court for\n     the 1996-97 school year on that basis.\n\n     The district court generally approved this stipulation, but the\n court disapproved the agreement to reserve consideration of the Missouri\n City transfer program and the expenditure of funds for advertising aimed\n at nonminority private and parochial school\n\n\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fstudents within the KCMSD.         The court found that it was in the best\ninterests of all the parties to resolve those two issues sooner, rather\nthan later.      Order of March 7, 1996, slip op. at 2.             Therefore, the\ncourt     did   not   consider   those   two    issues   to   be   subject   to   the\nStipulation.\n\n\n     In considering the Missouri City transfer program, the district\ncourt concluded that the program was a type of interdistrict relief not\npermitted by the Supreme Court's reasoning in Jenkins III.             Slip op. at\n3.   However, the district court found it necessary and equitable to take\ninto account the interests of the students who had volunteered to be a\npart of the transfer program and whose educations would be disrupted by\nan abrupt termination of the program.           Id. at 4-5.    The court held:\n\n\n     Balancing the interests of the participants with those of the\n     State, the Court finds that equity requires that the present\n     participants in the program be allowed to remain with present\n     State funding per pupil until they graduate the eighth grade\n     or voluntarily leave the program. The Court believes this\n     process of winding down the Missouri City program resolves the\n     difficulties of this situation in a reasonable equitable\n     manner.\n\n\nId. at 5.\n\n\n     The court next considered the permissibility of using desegregation\nfunds for advertising aimed at attracting nonminority students who\nreside in the KCMSD but attend private or parochial schools.             The court\nheld:     \"The State is correct that Jenkins III forecloses the use of\ndesegregation funds for recruitment efforts where the sole purpose of\nthe particular recruitment project is aimed at encouraging resident\nnonminorities currently in private or parochial schools to enroll in the\nKCMSD.\"     Id. at 5.    The court held, however, that the recruitment and\nmarketing department of the KCMSD still had a legitimate function in\nencouraging voluntary transfer of students\n\n\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fwithin the KCMSD itself to magnet schools.    Id. at 6-7.    To the extent\nthat this sort of advertising reaches nonminority private and parochial\nstudents incidentally, it is of no legal import.    Id. at 7.    The court\ntherefore approved the proposed budget item for the recruiting and\nmarketing department, but ordered that the department should not direct\nany efforts solely at recruiting nonminority students who reside in the\nKCMSD but attend private schools.    Id. at 7-8.   The court also stated\nthat it considered the State to have waived any objection to this item\nfor the 1996-97 school year by the terms of the Stipulation.    Id. at 7.\n\n\n     In a later order, the district court reached the items that had\nbeen reserved for its consideration by the terms of the Stipulation.\nThe court considered the Jenkins Class's proposal to restore funding for\nthe extended day program, less $1 million the Jenkins Class estimated\nthe KCMSD could collect by charging fees for enrollment in the program\nfor children who do not qualify for free or reduced price lunch.     Order\nof July 15, 1996, slip op. at 8.   The court ruled that the extended day\nprogram should be preserved.   The court explicitly based its holding on\nthe state of the record before it, stating:\n\n\n    Plaintiffs presented substantial evidence in support of the\n    current Extended Day Program. The KCMSD does not dispute the\n    sincerity or accuracy of the testimony elicited by plaintiffs.\n    . . . The Court was presented no evidence that the Extended\n    Day Program as a whole has become ineffective or is an\n    improper component of a desegregation remedy.\n\n\nId. at 9.   The court rejected the idea of charging fees for the program\nbased on financial need; since the program was intended to remedy\nconstitutional violations suffered on account of race, not on account of\nfinancial status, the Jenkins Class's proposal would result in charging\nsome victims for a remedy to which they were entitled.      Id. at 9-10.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\f     Next, the court considered the Jenkins Class's objections to the\n fourth-round budget cuts.       KCMSD had proposed budget cuts in layers,\n with the first three rounds of cuts being the responsibility of the\n administration at the affected schools.      The final, or fourth, round of\n budget cuts was imposed by the KCMSD administration, in some cases over\n the protest of the school principals.          Again, the court based its\n decision on the testimony before it.     Principals of some of the affected\n          3\n schools testified that the fourth-round cuts would damage the integrity\n of their schools' magnet themes.         Id. at 11.    Therefore, the court\n ordered the fourth-round budget cuts to be reinstated at those seven\n schools.     Id.   Not all principals were called to testify.   Consequently,\n the court was unable to make determinations about the advisability of\n the fourth-round budget cuts at the schools whose principals did not\n testify, and directed the Desegregation Monitoring Committee to evaluate\n whether the cuts should be made at those schools.       Id. at 11-12.\n     The Jenkins Class also proposed that the KCMSD be required to\n maintain permanent substitutes at each of the district's schools.         The\n court found that permanent substitutes were not generally necessary\n except in the foreign language magnets.           These schools depend on\n immersion in the foreign language, which entails teaching substantive\n courses in the foreign language.       Because of the difficulty in finding\n substitutes qualified to conduct classes in the various languages, the\n court found it appropriate that permanent substitutes be retained at the\n language magnets.      Id. at 13.\n\n\n\n\n      3\n       The schools were Trailwoods Elementary, Knotts Elementary,\nNorth Rock Creek/Korte, J.A. Rogers Middle School, Kansas City\nMiddle School for the Performing Arts, the Foreign Language Middle\nSchool, and East High School.\n\n                                      -12-\n\f                                    I.\n\n\n                                    A.\n\n\n    The State attacks the district court's reinstatement of the extended\nday program, the fourth-round budget cuts in the seven schools, and the\npermanent substitutes in the foreign language magnets.          The State\ncontends that these expenditures violate the command of Jenkins III to\nconsider the interest in local autonomy and to limit the aim of remedial\nprograms to restoring the victims of de jure segregation to the position\nthey would have occupied absent the constitutional violation.        These\narguments depend on antecedent assumptions or findings about what\nvestiges of injury remain in the KCMSD.     The State stipulated away its\nright to make this sort of argument at this stage of the litigation in\nits agreement limiting the issues to be decided in connection with the\n1996-97 budget:\n\n\n         Certain parties contend that the State and the KCMSD have\n    a continuing obligation to eliminate the remaining effects of\n    de jure segregation to the extent practicable.       The State\n    denies that there are such remaining effects. All parties\n    agree that they will not present any evidence at the June 1996\n    hearing on this issue, that no findings will be requested on\n    this issue, that the Court need not enter any findings on this\n    issue for the purpose of resolving the disputes among the\n    parties or ordering implementation of any desegregation\n    remedies proposed by any of the parties for the 1996-97 school\n    year . . . .\n\n\n    The effect of the Stipulation was before us on the motion to stay.\nWe there held the issue raised by the State to be foreclosed by the\nStipulation.   Order of October 23, 1996.   We have given further detailed\nstudy to the terms of the Stipulation and reach the same conclusion as\nwe did before.\n\n\n    By arguing that Jenkins III requires the district court to take\naction without regard to the existence and extent of\n\n\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fvestiges of segregation, the State shows an imperfect understanding of\nthe Jenkins III holding.         The reasoning in Jenkins III depends on a\nframework of three factors that must be balanced against each other in\ncrafting a desegregation remedy under Milliken v. Bradley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109723\"><a href=\"/opinion/109723/milliken-v-bradley/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n280-81 (1977) (Milliken II): (1) the nature of the remedy must be\ndetermined by the nature and scope of the constitutional violation; (2)\nthe decree must remedy the unconstitutional condition by restoring the\nvictims as nearly as possible to the position they would have occupied\nhad the violation never taken place; and (3) the decree must take into\naccount the importance of state and local autonomy.           115 S. Ct. at 2049.\nThe Supreme Court emphasized that        remedial orders should not be crafted\ntaking the first factor into consideration without adequate regard for\nthe second two.       Id.    This certainly does not lead to the conclusion\nthat such orders can be crafted only by reference to the third factor,\nwithout consideration of the first two factors.              Yet, the State would\nhave us assess the propriety of the three disputed programs in light of\nJenkins III when the State has stipulated that the court shall make no\nfindings with regard to the second factor, whether there exists vestiges\nof   the   unconstitutional     condition.      The   Supreme     Court    ordered   a\nbalancing process; the State asks us to carry out that process with only\none side of the scale.       This is impossible, and would be erroneous under\nJenkins III.\n\n\n     Despite its Stipulation, the State argues that the court erred in\nordering    relief    that    benefits    students    who   are     not   victims    of\nsegregation.    This assumes the very fact that the State stipulated would\nnot be resolved--whether there exist to this day vestiges or after-\neffects    of   the   unconstitutional     system    that   still    affect   student\nachievement levels in the KCMSD.             The Supreme Court mentioned that\nstudents in kindergarten through grade 7 have always attended AAA\nschools, and that the older students have received remedial education\nprograms for up to seven years.            Jenkins III,      115 S. Ct. at 2056.\nHowever, the\n\n\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\fSupreme Court did not say that there were no remaining victims of the\nafter-effects of segregation.         Rather, the Court remanded for further\nproceedings.   \"But these are questions that the Court rightly leaves to\nbe answered on remand.\"     Id. at 2061.      (O'Connor, J., concurring).    The\nState's inference that the Supreme Court considered the State's work\ndone and the KCMSD unitary is grossly premature, as well as inconsistent\nwith the Stipulation, which acknowledged this to be a disputed question.\nUntil we know the answer to that question, we certainly cannot say which\nstudents are affected by vestiges of segregation and in what way.\nConsequently, the State's contention that the district court's orders\nbenefited non-victims begs the question by assuming that we know who the\nremaining victims are.\n\n\n    In light of the Stipulation which the State entered and the district\ncourt approved, we can only view the 1996-97 budget as an interim\nmeasure.   Clearly, the matter had to be resolved before the school year\nand yet, a full adjudication of the constitutional questions inherent in\nthe matter would require hearings and findings which could not be\nachieved before the school year began.        In response to this dilemma, the\nparties    entered   into   the   Stipulation   reserving   the   constitutional\nquestions for a later day.        With this compromise before it, the district\ncourt acted properly in judging the propriety of the disputed programs\nby criteria that remained available after the Stipulation.           In the case\nof the fourth-round budget cuts and the permanent substitutes, the court\ndecided that doing away with the particular programs would undermine the\nmagnet themes.       In the case of the extended day program, it decided\nsimply that the program was beneficial to the students.             The Supreme\nCourt certainly did not disapprove either of the idea of magnet schools,\nsee Jenkins III, 115 S. Ct. at 2051 (\"We previously have approved of\nintradistrict desegregation remedies involving magnet schools\"), or of\nimproving the quality of education offered in the district, see id. at\n2050 (\"Thus, the proper response by the\n\n\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fDistrict Court should have been to eliminate to the extent practicable\nthe vestiges of prior de jure segregation within the KCMSD: a system-\nwide reduction in student achievement and the existence of 25 racially\nidentifiable schools. . . .\").          The Supreme Court only held that the\nappropriateness of orders pursuing those goals must be ascertained by\nbalancing all three Milliken II factors, and the State stipulated that\nthe   district    court   would   not   determine   one   of   those   factors   in\nadjudicating the propriety of the three programs in question.\n\n\n      In sum, the State's arguments attacking the approval of the three\ndisputed programs for the 1996-97 year depend on a reasoning process\nthat the district court could not complete because of the parties'\nStipulation.     The district court appropriately considered the propriety\nof those programs as an interim measure, as was contemplated by the\nparties' agreement.       We therefore affirm the district court's order\nregarding the extended day program, permanent substitutes in the foreign\nlanguage magnets, and the restoration of the fourth-round budget cuts in\nthe seven schools.\n\n\n                                         B.\n\n\n      The State argues that the record evidence showed the extended day\nprogram is \"just babysitting,\" and that therefore its only possible\npurpose is to attract suburban students.       While the extended day program\nundeniably serves a child care function, there was a great deal of\ntestimony before the court that the program also serves an educational\npurpose.    We have reviewed the testimony the State cites, and it\ncertainly does not compel the conclusion that the extended day program\nonly exists to attract suburban students.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\f                                             C.\n\n\n       The State also argues that the district court's order of July 15,\n1996 contravenes Jenkins III, and that the district court's authority is\nsimply to execute the mandate of Jenkins III.                          It argues that by\nordering the three disputed programs the district court has refused to\nfollow the Supreme Court's mandate that the process of returning KCMSD\nto local control begin in earnest.\n       The State argues that Jenkins III requires restoration of local\ncontrol at the earliest practical date.                  The argument is based on the\nState's reading of Jenkins III that \"the District Court must bear in\nmind    that   its   end     purpose   is   .   .   .    to    restore   state    and   local\nauthorities to . . . control,\" 115 S. Ct. at 2056 (quotation omitted).\nThe State argues that the Supreme Court emphasized the vital national\ntradition of local autonomy of school districts and ordered that no\nadditional programs be imposed that unwarrantably postpone the day when\nKCMSD will be able to operate on its own.                    Id. at 2056.\n\n\n       The shortcoming of the State's argument is that it edits the\nlanguage of the Supreme Court in a manner that presents less than a full\nand fair reading of the Court's holding.                      The Court in Jenkins III\ncertainly      refers   to    the   restoration         of    local   control    on   several\noccasions, see, e.g., id. at 2054, 2056, and the Court emphasizes the\ngoal of returning the school district to local control, but the other\npart of the equation is that the district court must consider whether\nthe previously segregated district has achieved partial unitary status.\nJenkins III points out that the State had not sought a declaration of\npartial unitary status with respect to quality education programs.                       Id.\nat 2055.       In rejecting arguments relating to whether national norms\ncould be considered in evaluating the success of educational programs\nthe Supreme Court stated:\n\n\n\n\n                                            -17-\n\f            But this clearly is not the appropriate test to be\n      applied in deciding whether a previously segregated district\n      has achieved partially unitary status. See Freeman, 503 U.S.\n      at 491; Dowell, 498 U.S. at 249-50. The basic task of the\n      District Court is to decide whether the reduction in\n      achievement by minority students attributable to prior de jure\n      segregation has been remedied to the extent practicable. . . .\n\n            In reconsidering this order, the District Court should\n      apply our three-part test from Freeman v. Pitts, supra, 503 U.\n      S., at 491, 112 S. Ct., at 1445-1446.\n\n\nId.   The three-part test for partial unitariness was stated in Freeman\nv. Pitts, 503 U.S. at 491:\n\n            A court's discretion to order the incremental withdrawal\n      of its supervision in a school desegregation case must be\n      exercised in a manner consistent with the purposes and\n      objectives of its equitable power. Among the factors which\n      must inform the sound discretion of the court in ordering\n      partial withdrawal are the following: whether there has been\n      full and satisfactory compliance with the decree in those\n      aspects of the system where supervision is to be withdrawn;\n      whether retention of judicial control is necessary or\n      practicable to achieve compliance with the decree in other\n      facets of the school system; and whether the school district\n      has demonstrated, to the public and to the parents and\n      students of the once disfavored race, its good-faith\n      commitment to the whole of the court's decree and to those\n      provisions of the law and the Constitution that were the\n      predicate for judicial intervention in the first instance.\n\n\n      Jenkins III concludes:\n\n\n            On remand, the District Court must bear in mind that its\n      end purpose is not only \"to remedy the violation\" to the\n      extent practicable, but also \"to restore state and local\n      authorities to the control of a school system that is\n      operating in compliance with the Constitution.\" Freeman, 503\n      U.S. at 489.\n\n\n115 S. Ct. at 2056.\n\n\n      The last passage above demonstrates that the State, in\n\n\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fstressing the return to local control, has completely ignored the\nCourt's direction to engage in the inquiry required by Freeman v. Pitts,\nto ascertain whether unitary status has been achieved, whether the\nresults of segregation have been remedied to the extent practicable, and\nwhether a school system operating in compliance with the Constitution\nmay be restored to state and local control.\n\n\n     We thus reject the argument the State makes that Jenkins III has\nmandated determination of the issues now before us.            The Supreme Court\nhas made clear in Jenkins III that the State did not seek a declaration\nof   partial   unitary   status   with    respect   to   the   quality   education\nprograms, 115 S. Ct. at 2055, but rather that the case now must be\nreturned to the district court to make that inquiry.\n\n\n     In view of the parties' stipulation and the Supreme Court's remand\nto the district court to consider the question of unitary status under\nFreeman, it is not necessary that we reach the merits of the arguments\nadvanced by the State.\n\n\n                                         II.\n\n\n     The Jenkins Class cross-appeals, arguing that the district court\nerred in prohibiting the use of desegregation funds for marketing and\nrecruitment efforts directed solely at drawing private school students\nliving within the KCMSD boundaries.            In its orders of March 7, 1996,\nslip op. at 5-7, and May 31, 1996, slip op. at 2-3, the district court\nruled that the desegregative attractiveness discussion in Jenkins III\nforbade use of desegregation funding to recruit nonminority private\nschool students living within the KCMSD, as well as to recruit suburban\nnonminorities.   The district court reasoned that \"private and parochial\nschools are essentially districts within themselves,\" slip op. at 6, and\nthat therefore spending desegregation money to\n\n\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\frecruit     students     from    those        schools    was   based     upon   the    same\nimpermissible interdistrict goals as recruiting students from suburban\npublic school districts.         Id.\n\n\n    The Jenkins Class argues that the district court drew incorrect\ninferences    from     Jenkins   III     in    considering     private    schools     to    be\nequivalent to other public school districts.                The Class argues that the\nreason the Supreme Court disapproved of interdistrict relief was to\navoid     \"burdening    other     public       school    districts     which    were       not\nconstitutional       violators,     not        [to   protect]    independent        private\nentities.\"     The Class also points out that the district court ruled\nbefore these issues had been thoroughly briefed.\n\n\n    We first must concede that the record with respect to this issue may\nhave been most generally developed with respect to the differences\nbetween private and parochial schools and public schools, and we have\nquestions with respect to whether they are \"essentially districts within\nthemselves\" as found by the district court.                 We believe, however, that\nthis issue can be addressed again with a more complete record on remand.\n\n\n    We conclude that the legal underpinning in the district court's\nanalysis runs contrary to Jenkins III.                  Jenkins III discussed at some\nlength the difference between intradistrict violations and interdistrict\nviolations, and the remedies that may be appropriate for each.                        115 S.\nCt. at 2049-54.      It concluded that the interdistrict goal of attracting\nstudents from surrounding districts was an interdistrict remedy for an\nintradistrict violation.         Id. at 2052.\n\n\n    The following passages from Jenkins III demonstrate the basis for\nthe Court's ruling:\n\n\n\n\n                                              -20-\n\f           What we meant in Milliken I [Milliken v. Bradley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109102\"><a href=\"/opinion/109102/milliken-v-bradley/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span>\n     <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">717</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1974)] by an interdistrict violation was a violation\n     that caused segregation between adjoining districts.\n\n\n 115 S. Ct. at 2052.   In Jenkins III, the Supreme Court said that nothing\n in Milliken I suggested that the district court could have required the\n State of Michigan to implement a magnet program designed to achieve the\n same interdistrict transfer of students that Milliken I had held to be\n beyond its remedial authority.      115 S. Ct. at 2052.      Jenkins III\n continued:\n\n\n     Here, the District Court has done just that: created a magnet\n     district of the KCMSD in order to serve the interdistrict goal\n     of attracting nonminority students from the surrounding SSD's\n     and redistributing them within the KCMSD.        The District\n     Court's pursuit of \"desegregative attractiveness\" is beyond\n     the scope of its broad remedial authority.4\n\n\n     4\n      Jenkins III also made the following statements:\n\n          The purpose of desegregative attractiveness has been\n     not only to remedy the system-wide reduction in student\n     achievement, but also to attract nonminority students not\n     presently enrolled in the KCMSD. . . .\n\n                                   . . .\n\n          The District Court's remedial plan in this case,\n     however, is not designed solely to redistribute the\n     students within the KCMSD in order to eliminate racially\n     identifiable schools within the KCMSD.      Instead, its\n     purpose is to attract nonminority students from outside\n     the KCMSD schools. But this interdistrict goal is beyond\n     the scope of the intradistrict violation identified by\n     the District Court. In effect, the District Court has\n     devised a remedy to accomplish indirectly what it\n     admittedly lacks the remedial authority to mandate\n     directly: the interdistrict transfer of students. 639\n     F. Supp. at 38    (\"`[B]ecause of restrictions on this\n     Court's remedial powers in restructuring the operations\n     of local and state government entities,' any mandatory\n     plan which would go beyond the boundary lines of KCMSD\n     goes far beyond the nature and extent of the\n     constitutional violation [that] this Court found\nexisted\").\n\n\n                                   -21-\n\fId. at 2052 (second emphasis added).       The Supreme Court then discussed\n the issue of white flight and concluded:\n\n\n     The record here does not support the District Court's reliance\n     on \"white flight\" as a justification for a permissible\n     expansion of its intradistrict remedial authority through its\n     pursuit of desegregative attractiveness.\n\n\n 115 S. Ct. at 2053.\n\n\n     This language from Jenkins III indicates that the remedy cannot be\n designed to recruit students from adjoining districts to the Kansas City\n schools in an effort to remedy intradistrict violations.   We do not read\n Jenkins III as restricting the KCMSD's efforts to attract back to its\n schools those residents of the district who now attend private and\n parochial schools.    As the Jenkins Class points out, the funding for the\n schools under the state procedures is based upon enrollment, and an\n increase in enrollment is in the best interest of KCMSD.           As the\n district court discussed, efforts directed at KCMSD students may have an\n impact on KCMSD resident students in parochial and private schools.\n Slip op. at 7.   As pointed out by Justice O'Connor, such effects are of\n no consequence.      See Jenkins III, 115 S. Ct. at 2060 (O'Connor, J.,\nconcurring).\n\n\n     Thus, we conclude that the district court's analysis rested on a\nquestionable reading of Jenkins III, and we remand this\n\n\n\n\n          In Milliken I we determined that a desegregation\n     remedy that would require mandatory interdistrict\n     reassignment   of  students   throughout  the   Detroit\n     metropolitan area was an impermissible interdistrict\n     response to the intradistrict violation identified.\n\n115 S. Ct. at 2051 (emphasis in last paragraph added).\n\n                                    -22-\n\fissue for further consideration.\n\n\n                                        III.\n\n\n      The State argues that the district court abused its discretion in\nordering continued funding of the Missouri City Interdistrict Transfer\nProgram for eight additional years, because it is an impermissible\ninterdistrict remedy in this intradistrict case.              The Jenkins Class\nargues that the district court erred in ordering the phaseout of the\nprogram.   Only thirteen students participate in this program.             No other\nsuburban schools have accepted minority students from KCMSD.\n\n\n      The district court's order of March 7, 1996, recognizes that the\nMissouri   City    Program    is   an   interdistrict   program   based     upon   a\nstipulation, and that this stipulation can be modified by changing\ncircumstances, such as those provided by the Supreme Court opinion in\nJenkins III.      Slip op. at 4 (citing Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County\nJail, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112679\"><a href=\"/opinion/112679/rufo-v-inmates-of-suffolk-county-jail/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 390 (1992)).        The district court, however, looked to\nthe limits of this responsibility to determine whether the proposed\nmodification is suitably tailored to the changing circumstances.              Slip\nop. at 4-5.       In doing so, it rejected the State's argument that the\nprogram should be discontinued after one year, but looked to the public\ninterest in seeing the State honor its agreements made on the public's\nbehalf.     The    district   court     therefore   ordered   that   the   present\nparticipants in the program be allowed to remain with present state\nfunding until they graduate eighth grade or voluntarily leave the\nprogram.\n\n\n      The State's argument that the court lacks authority to order such\na program is somewhat weakened by its admission in oral argument that\nthe   district court should discontinue the program with reasonable\npromptness, at most the completion of the school year in question.             The\nState's position at least approaches a\n\n\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\fconcession that the district court may determine what is reasonable\npromptness, and the proper length of the phaseout.\n\n\n    The State makes a robust argument that Jenkins III bars such\ninterdistrict remedies.    On the other hand, the legal underpinning in\nthe past has been that voluntary plans can be a part of an intradistrict\nremedy and that the burden can be placed on the constitutional violator,\nin this instance, the State of Missouri.\n\n\n    The Missouri City order was entered on March 7, 1996, one of the\nfirst orders entered by the court following Jenkins III, and it was not\nthoroughly briefed.   While the State had filed a motion for declaration\nof unitary status by March 7, the State had not made an effort to call\nfor a hearing on this issue.   After the March 1996 order, the State and\nKCMSD entered a proposed agreement for a three-year phaseout of the\ndesegregation remedy, subject to court approval.     Both the unitariness\nand settlement matters were set for hearing.\n\n\n    Under these circumstances, we deem it unnecessary to discuss the\narguments in further detail.     In view of the State's concession that\nsome reasonable phaseout is authorized, we think it appropriate to\nremand this issue to the district court for further consideration after\nthe hearing concerning unitary status and the proposed settlement.\n\n\n                                  . . .\n\n\n    The opinion of the Supreme Court in Jenkins III gave specific\ndirections to the district court to reconsider the order on quality\neducation programs under the three-part test from Freeman v. Pitts.   The\nCourt makes clear the necessity for detailed and specific findings by\nthe district court and that it identify the incremental effect that\nsegregation has had on minority student\n\n\n\n\n                                  -24-\n\fachievement, and the specific goals of the quality education programs.\n115 S. Ct. at 2055.     It further instructed that the district court\nshould \"sharply limit, if not dispense with, its reliance\" on improved\nachievement on test scores.        Id.    It cautioned that the quality\neducation programs should be tailored to remedy the injuries suffered by\nthe victims of prior de jure segregation.     Id. at 2056.\n\n\n    We think it also appropriate to observe the comment of Justice\nO'Connor, who joined in the opinion of the Court, but in her concurring\nopinion noted that the Court refrained from addressing the propriety of\nall the remedies the district court has ordered, revised, and extended\nin the eighteen-year-old history of the case.     While these remedies may\nbe improper to the extent that they serve the goals of desegregative\nattractiveness   and   suburban   comparability   that   were   held   to   be\nimpermissible, \"conversely, the District Court may be able to justify\nsome remedies without reliance on these goals.     But these are questions\nthat the Court rightly leaves to be answered on remand.\"        115 S. Ct. at\n2061 (O'Connor, J., concurring).\n\n\n    We therefore affirm the district court's disposition of the 1996-97\nbudget issues, and reverse and remand on the private school recruiting\nissue and the Missouri City transfer program issue.\n\n\n     A true copy.\n\n\n           Attest:\n\n\n                 CLERK, U.
