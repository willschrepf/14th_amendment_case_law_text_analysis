The litigation arises out of\nDefendants’ refusal to provide services at a hotel event to the individual Plaintiffs\nbecause they were Jewish. Plaintiff Platinum, an event promoting company, also sued\nDefendants for contract and tort causes of action related to the event. Defendants assert\nmany grounds on appeal regarding sufficiency of the evidence, improper evidentiary\nrulings, standing, inconsistent verdicts, duplicative recovery, jury instruction errors, and\nimproper apportionment of attorney fees awards. We affirm the jury’s verdict awarding\nactual damages and statutory penalties under Unruh as it is supported by substantial\nevidence and any evidentiary concerns raised by Defendants were harmless error. We\nreverse the duplicative award of punitive damages stemming from intentional infliction\nof emotion distress. We reverse and remand the court’s award of attorney fees to the\nextent that it abused its discretion in unreasonably apportioning attorney fees associated\nwith Plaintiff Platinum’s causes of action.\n                   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND1\n       Defendant Adaya is an owner and operator of Defendant Shangri-La Hotel in\nSanta Monica, California. Plaintiff Platinum, an event promoter, had previously worked\nwith Shangri-La to orchestrate events and parties at the hotel. In June 2010, Platinum\nbegan arranging Sunday pool parties at Shangri-La. Platinum set up the July 2010 pool\nparty at issue in this case for the Young Leadership Group of the Friends of the Israeli\nDefense Forces (FIDF) to fundraise for children of fallen Israeli soldiers to attend camp\nin the United States.\n\n\n1\n       Consistent with the substantial evidence standard of review, we recite the relevant\nfacts established by the record in the light most favorable to the judgment, giving\nPlaintiffs the benefit of every reasonable inference and resolving any conflict in the\nevidence in support of the judgment. (Los Angeles Unified School Dist. v. Casasola\n(2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 189, 194, fn. 1.)\n\n\n                                              2\n\f       Plaintiff Scott Paletz, who is the managing member of Platinum, and FIDF event\norganizers toured the Shangri-La facilities with the Shangri-La events manager The\nevents manager agreed that Shangri-La would provide FIDF with a private area marked\nby stanchions, pool access, towels, and drink specials, all at no charge. Paletz met with\nShangri-La’s general manager and its food and beverage director, Nathan Codrey, to\nfinalize arrangements for the pool party several times thereafter.\n       On the morning of the pool party, Shangri-La provided to FIDF a check-in table\nand towels, and cordoned off an area of the pool with stanchions and ropes for FIDF’s\npool party guests. FIDF placed brochures, literature, and t-shirts on the tables, and\ndisplayed two 6-foot banners. FIDF checked guests in, giving them blue bracelets and\nFIDF t-shirts.\n       During the beginning of the pool party, Adaya was watching the World Cup in her\npoolside cabana. When she exited her cabana, she saw FIDF’s guests in and around the\npool, the banners and tables with literature, and the FIDF t-shirts on display. She\nsummoned one of her security personnel to obtain a pamphlet for her review. The\nsecurity guard walked over to the table, requested a pamphlet, and told the FIDF member\nat the check-in table that Shangri-La’s owner wanted to know what the group was about.\nThe pamphlet described FIDF and the program for which the pool party was fundraising.\nThe security guard brought it to Adaya, who then became noticeably agitated and passed\nthe pamphlet to others sitting with her.\n       Adaya then contacted Codrey, the food and beverage director who had worked\nwith Platinum to set up the pool party. When Codrey arrived at the hotel, Adaya told him\n“I don’t want any [f---ing] Jews in the pool.” Although Adaya did not make this\nstatement directly to Plaintiffs, Codrey told Paletz and possibly others that Adaya made\nthis statement. Codrey conveyed to some of the Plaintiffs that Adaya wanted the event\nshut down because they were Jewish. Adaya further told Codrey that “[i]f my parents\nfind out that there is a Jewish event here, they’re going to pull money from me\nimmediately.”\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\f       Per Adaya’s instruction, Shangri-La staff systematically shut down FIDF’s pool\nparty. Hotel staff singled out FIDF guests, identifiable by their blue wristbands, and\nremoved them from the pool, while other hotel guests and non-guests were allowed to\nstay in the pool. Shangri-La staff required FIDF members to remove their banners. The\nstaff locked the entrance gate to the pool to prevent FIDF attendees from entering or\nreentering the pool area. Pool staff removed the towels provided for FIDF’s event and\nhad FIDF remove the t-shirts from the tables. Shangri-La security removed the ropes and\nstanchions that delineated FIDF’s private area at the pool. Staff also ordered all event\nattendees to remove their FIDF event t-shirts. Those FIDF event attendees who remained\nat the pool after the event was dismantled, were permitted to stay in the pool area.\nDuring this series of events, Adaya and her husband sat in a cabana next to the pool area\nand stared down the FIDF members for at least an hour to an hour and a half, generating\na lot of tension between the parties.\n       The Plaintiffs became aware of Adaya’s discriminatory intent either by hearing\nher statements from Codrey or other attendees, witnessing her behavior, or directly\nhearing Adaya make comments regarding FIDF’s removal from the pool. For instance,\none Plaintiff saw Adaya become very agitated and heard her raise her voice, instructing\nthe security guard to “get them out, get them out, get them out.” While in the restroom, a\ndifferent Plaintiff overheard Adaya ask a non-Jewish woman, “[d]o you want me to get\nthese people off the lounge chairs?” Codrey, a hotel employee, repeatedly apologized for\nAdaya’s actions, once calling it “blatant anti-Semitism.”\n       Plaintiffs Paletz, Stephen C. Fowler (an independent contractor of Platinum), and\nsixteen individuals, who were FIDF guests at the pool party, sued Defendants Adaya and\nShangri-La for (1) discrimination under Unruh Civil Rights Act, Civil Code section2 51,\n(2) intentional infliction of emotional distress, (3) negligent infliction of emotional\ndistress, and (4) negligence. Plaintiff Platinum sued Shangri-La for breach of contract\n\n\n2\n      All subsequent statutory references are to the Civil Code, unless indicated\notherwise.\n\n\n                                              4\n\fand related causes of action. At trial, the court admitted Codrey’s deposition testimony\nregarding Adaya’s statements made to him at the pool. Plaintiffs also testified at trial to\nthe statements Codrey made to them at the pool, conveying the derogatory remarks made\nby Adaya. Some Plaintiffs testified to hearing Adaya’s derogatory statements third or\nfourth hand from other FIDF guests at the pool. Over Defendants’ objections, the court\nadditionally admitted expert testimony from a Rabbi, which characterized Adaya’s\nbehavior as anti-Semitic and discussed the Plaintiffs’ reaction to the events that occurred\nat Shangri-La. The court permitted evidence that Adaya was Pakistani and Muslim,\nagain over Defendants’ objections. After a 10-day trial followed by six days of jury\ndeliberation, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Plaintiffs.\n       The jury found that Defendants had discriminated against each individual Plaintiff\nin violation of Unruh. The jury found that Defendants had been negligent and committed\nnegligent infliction of emotional distress toward various Plaintiffs. The jury also found\nthat Defendants had intentionally inflicted emotional distress on 11 Plaintiffs. Each\nindividual Plaintiff was awarded compensatory damages and Unruh statutory penalties\nagainst Defendants; these combined awards ranged from $26,000 to $180,000 for each\nPlaintiff. In a separate, second phase of the trial, the jury also awarded $405,000 in\npunitive damages to the 11 individual Plaintiffs that it determined to be victims of\nintentional infliction of emotional distress. The punitive damage awards ranged from\n$25,000 to $80,000 for each of the 11 individuals. Adaya and Shangri-La were each 50\npercent responsible for damages.\n       The jury further determined that Shangri-La had breached its oral agreement with\nPlatinum, breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, made negligent\nmisrepresentations, and negligently and intentionally interfered with a prospective\neconomic advantage. The jury awarded Platinum $11,250 in damages and $40,000 in\npunitive damages for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.\n\n\n\n\n                                               5\n\f       Collectively, Plaintiffs were awarded $1,654,250. The court additionally awarded\nthe individual Plaintiffs $2,099,785.50 in attorney fees on Unruh Act claims, along with\ncosts amounting to $40,911.47. Notably, the same law firm represented all Plaintiffs.\nDefendants filed motions for a new trial and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict;\nboth were denied.\n                                       DISCUSSION\n       Defendants raise many issues on appeal, arguing that: (1) there is insufficient\nevidence to support a finding of unlawful intent for the intentional infliction of emotional\ndistress and Unruh Act claims; (2) the court abused its discretion on evidentiary rulings\nrelated to hearsay, expert testimony, and character evidence, warranting reversal; (3) one\nPlaintiff lacked standing to assert an Unruh claim; (4) Defendants owed no duty to\nPlaintiffs sufficient to support a claim for negligence or negligent infliction of emotional\ndistress; (5) the jury provided inconsistent and irreconcilable verdicts by rendering\nverdicts in favor of eleven Plaintiffs for both negligent and intentional infliction of\nemotional distress; (6) the punitive damages award was improper; (7) there was an\ninstructional error in calculating statutory penalties that requires a new trial; and (8) the\nattorney fees award was improperly apportioned and calculated.\n       1.     Substantial Evidence Supports Unlawful Intent for Unruh Claim\n       Defendants assert that Plaintiffs’ Unruh claims must fail because they did not\nestablish the requisite intent for Unruh. “When findings of fact are challenged in a civil\nappeal, we are bound by the familiar principle that ‘the power of the appellate court\nbegins and ends with a determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence,\ncontradicted or uncontradicted,’ to support the findings below.” (Oregel v. American\nIsuzu Motors, Inc. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1100.) “We must therefore view the\nevidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, giving it the benefit of every\nreasonable inference and resolving all conflicts in its favor in accordance with the\nstandard of review so long adhered to by this court.” (Jessup Farms v. Baldwin (1983)\n33 Cal.3d 639, 660.)\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\f       In Harris v. Capital Growth Investors XIV (1991) 52 Cal.3d 1142, 1175 (Harris),\nsuperseded on other grounds by Civil Code section 51(f), the Supreme Court held that “a\nplaintiff seeking to establish a case under the Unruh Act must plead and prove intentional\ndiscrimination in public accommodations in violation of the terms of the Act.” This\nmeans “willful, affirmative misconduct on the part of those who violate the Act.”\n(Harris, at p. 1172.) Substantial evidence supports the jury’s finding here that\nDefendants intentionally discriminated against Defendants. Multiple people testified to\nAdaya’s negative reaction to finding out that Shangri-La was hosting a Jewish event and\nthat she shortly thereafter shut down FIDF’s pool party. Testimony also establishes that\nAdaya made anti-Semitic remarks about the FIDF members in her pool, indicating to\nstaff that she wanted them removed because they were Jewish.\n       For instance, Plaintiff Nicholas Morrison testified to Adaya’s negative reaction to\nthe pamphlet, which preceded her systematic shutdown of the pool party. At the time of\nthe pool party, Morrison was the vice president of programming on the executive board\nof FIDF, who helped plan the event at Shangri-La’s pool. Morrison testified that he was\nworking at the check-in table during the FIDF event, where he distributed wristbands and\nFIDF t-shirts to attendees. Morrison stated that a hotel security guard approached him at\nthe check-in table and asked him for one of the FIDF pamphlets. The security guard\nidentified himself as a hotel employee and told Morrison, “[t]he owner is interested in\nwho you are and . . . what your organization is.” Morrison watched the security guard\nwalk over to Adaya and give her the pamphlet. Morrison testified that Adaya’s reaction\nto reading the pamphlet was “not positive.” Describing her reaction, Morrison testified:\n“[i]t was very agitated. Arms flailing and handing it to the people that she was sitting\nwith. And you could see her gesturing towards it as they were reading it. It wasn’t a\n‘how wonderful, this is fantastic.’ There was a distinct reaction that was negative.”\nShortly thereafter, Adaya shut down FIDF’s event.\n\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\f       Shangri-La’s former employee Nathan Codrey’s deposition testimony was also\nadmitted at trial, and directly established that Adaya made anti-Semitic remarks, which\nillustrated her discriminatory motivation for shutting down their event. Codrey testified\nthat Adaya told him, “I don’t want any [f---ing] Jews in the pool.” Codrey further stated\nthat Adaya said, “[i]f my parents find out that there is a Jewish event here, they’re going\nto pull money from me immediately.” Codrey described Adaya as visibly upset and\ntestified that Adaya said that she wanted the group out immediately. Codrey stated that\nAdaya yelled at him: “I can’t have this [f---ing] event. This is ridiculous. I can’t believe\nthat this was approved. Who approved this? Who knew about this? My family or my\nparents will pull money from me.”\n       Codrey also testified that Adaya’s husband soon thereafter showed up, visibly\nupset. Codrey stated that “[h]e made matters a lot worse because [both Adaya and her\nhusband] sat in the front -- in the far corner cabana located next to the jacuzzi and started\nto -- and stared at the [FIDF guests]. Just stared them down. . . . You could cut the\ntension with a knife there. It was very chaotic and -- and then at times very, very quiet.”\nHe testified that the staring lasted for at least an hour to an hour and a half.\n       Codrey additionally explained how Adaya systematically shut down FIDF’s pool\nparty. Codrey testified that, Adaya first stated that no literature was to be passed out.\nShe then told Codrey to tell FIDF to take their shirts off, which said FIDF. Third, she\nmandated that they were not allowed in the pool. His testimony clearly established that\nDefendants’ conduct in depriving Plaintiffs of services was intentional and motivated by\ndiscrimination.\n       To the extent that Defendants assert that their denial of hotel services to Plaintiffs\nwas based on Shangri-La’s “valid policies and practices” and not discrimination, we\nreiterate that we view the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the prevailing\nparty. Moreover, Defendants’ assertion that Plaintiffs were denied services because they\nviolated hotel policies mischaracterizes the evidence. There was evidence that a previous\npool party at Shangri-La, which occurred only a month prior to the FIDF event, was not\nconstrained by these “policies.” Furthermore, the policies at issue never existed in\n\n\n                                               8\n\fwriting, and appeared to be applied at the whims of Adaya, who testified that pool access\nwas determined on a “day-to-day basis” by “whoever is managing that particular day.”\n       We conclude that the testimony quoted and summarized above describing Adaya’s\npoolside conduct and speech clearly establishes that Defendants intentionally deprived\nPlaintiffs of the hotel services because they were Jewish. Substantial evidence supports\nthe jury finding of intentional discrimination. We therefore affirm the jury’s intent\nfindings as to Unruh.\n       2.     Evidentiary Issues Raised by Defendants Do Not Warrant Reversal\n       We review the trial court’s rulings admitting evidence for abuse of discretion.\n(Nevarrez v. San Marino Skilled Nursing &Wellness Centre (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 102,\n117.) The trial court has broad authority “with respect to rulings that turn on the\nrelevance of the proffered evidence.” (Shaw v. County of Santa Cruz (2008)\n170 Cal.App.4th 229, 281.) The court abuses its discretion when it makes “arbitrary,\ncapricious, or patently absurd” decisions. (Hernandez v. Amcord, Inc. (2013)\n215 Cal.App.4th 659, 678.) “In addition, evidentiary rulings which are based on a\nmisunderstanding of the law are an abuse of discretion.” (Ibid.) To the extent the court\ndid not provide a rationale for its evidentiary decisions, “[a] ruling on the admissibility of\nevidence implies whatever finding of fact is prerequisite thereto.” (Evid. Code § 402,\nsubd. (c).)\n       a.     The Court Did Not Err in Admitting Out of Court Statements Made by\nAdaya to Codrey\n       Defendants assert that the court abused its discretion in allowing each of the\nPlaintiffs to provide hearsay testimony regarding statements made by Adaya to Codrey.\nDefendants identify two kinds of hearsay testimony: (1) Plaintiffs’ testimony about\nAdaya’s statements to Codrey that they heard directly from Codrey and (2) Plaintiffs’\ntestimony about Adaya’s statements to Codrey that they heard third or fourth hand from\nother members of FIDF.\n\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\f       i.     Defendants Waived Hearsay Objections to Plaintiffs’ Testimony Regarding\nHearing Adaya’s Statements From Other FIDF Members\n       We begin by addressing Plaintiffs’ arguments that Defendants waived their\nhearsay arguments in failing to object to hearsay at trial. Although it appears that\nDefendants properly objected to the first type of testimony regarding statements heard\ndirectly from Codrey, Defendants failed to object to the latter type of testimony, where\nPlaintiffs stated they heard Adaya’s statement third or fourth hand from other FIDF\nguests. Prior to trial, Defendants brought a motion in limine requesting the court to\nexclude potential hearsay statements regarding profane and anti-Semitic statements made\nby Adaya. In their motion, Defendants asserted that: “[t]he individual Plaintiffs have\nclaimed damages from what Defendant [Adaya] is alleged to have said, yet none of the\nPlaintiffs actually heard Ms. Adaya say anything profane or anti-Semitic at the event. All\nof the claims in that regard are rooted in inadmissible hearsay, and there are no\nexceptions to the Hearsay Rule that would allow introduction of the alleged comments\nadmittedly not heard by any of the Plaintiffs in this case.” The court denied the motion\nwithout prejudice, explaining that the motion “raise[d] evidentiary issues that can only be\naddressed at trial.”\n       To preserve an objection for appeal via a motion in limine, the objection must be\n“specific, . . . directed to an identifiable body of evidence, and . . . advanced at a time\nwhen the trial judge could give fair consideration to the admissibility of the evidence in\nits context.” (People v. Morris (1991) 53 Cal.3d 152, 189 disapproved on other grounds\nin People v. Stansbury (1995) 9 Cal.4th 824, 830, fn. 1). In Defendants’ hearsay motion\nin limine, Defendants failed to identify Adaya’s specific statements that were at issue, nor\ndid they identify the testimony they expected each Plaintiff to provide at trial that they\nsought to exclude. Not only was the objection too general, but it was advanced too early,\nat an interval where the court could not assess the evidence in the appropriate context.\nThe court made it clear that the hearsay objections could only be assessed at trial when\nthe particular out of court statements at issue were evident. Thus, the motion in limine\ndid not preserve any of Defendants’ hearsay objections.\n\n\n                                              10\n\f       At trial, Defendants made a single hearsay objection when Plaintiffs’ counsel\nelicited testimony about statements Plaintiff Ari Ryan heard directly from Codrey. When\nPlaintiffs’ counsel asked Ryan what Codrey told him about Adaya’s statements, defense\ncounsel objected on hearsay grounds. The court overruled the objection and Ryan\ntestified to what Codrey had told him. This objection suffices to preserve Defendants’\nadmissibility arguments regarding the first kind of hearsay identified by Defendant:\nPlaintiffs testifying to what Codrey directly told them Adaya said. (See People v. Antick\n(1975) 15 Cal.3d 79, 95 [a party need not make a continuing objection to a particular line\nof evidence once the party’s initial objection to that line of evidence has been overruled],\ndisapproved on other grounds by People v. McCoy (2001) 25 Cal.4th 1111, 1123.)\n       Yet, Defendants never objected at trial to the second kind of hearsay regarding\nthird-or-fourth-hand accounts of Adaya’s remarks, nor did their motion in limine even\nalert the court to this type of triple or quadruple hearsay. “To obtain reversal based on\nthe erroneous admission of evidence, the record must show a timely objection making\nclear that specific ground. ([Evid. Code,] § 353; In re C.B. (2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 102,\n132 [117 Cal.Rptr.3d 846] [hearsay objections ‘waived by the failure to object below’].)\nLack of such objection deprives the proponent of the evidence an opportunity to establish\na better record or some alternative basis for admission.” (Duronslet v. Kamps (2012) 203\nCal.App.4th 717, 726.)\n       Here, Defendants failed to object to Plaintiffs’ testimony providing third-or-\nfourth-hand accounts of Adaya’s statements. Importantly, the trial court would have\nengaged in a different analysis to address this hearsay objection, as additional layers of\nout-of-court statements were at issue. Defendants never presented Plaintiffs with an\nopportunity to provide a valid basis for its admission and never gave the court an\nopportunity to contemplate and rule on the issue. Because Defendants did not object,\nthey forfeited their claim that the court erred by admitting this second type of hearsay\nevidence. We thus only address the admissibility of Plaintiffs’ testimony regarding out of\ncourt statements heard directly from Codrey.\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\f       ii.     Plaintiffs’ Testimony About Adaya’s Statement As Heard Directly from\nCodrey Was Not Hearsay\n       Defendants contend that the court abused its discretion by admitting Plaintiffs’\ntestimony about how they heard from Codrey that Adaya did not want them in the pool\nbecause they were Jewish. Adaya’s underlying statement at issue is: “I don’t want any\n[f---ing] Jews in the pool.” Defendants concede that the communication from Adaya to\nCodrey was not inadmissible hearsay. Defendants assert that “[t]he abuse of discretion\narose once the testimony got beyond this alleged direct communication between Mr.\nCodrey and Ms. Adaya, and went to Plaintiffs, who were allowed to testify . . . that\n. . . [they] heard Ms. Adaya’s comments second-hand from Mr. Codrey.” Defendants\nargue that “[n]o exceptions applied to these final layers of hearsay from Mr. Codrey to\nPlaintiffs.”\n       Hearsay is an out-of-court statement that is offered for the truth of the matter\nasserted, and is generally inadmissible. (Evid. Code, § 1200, subd. (a).) Conversely, an\nout-of-court statement is not hearsay when it is offered for other purposes. For example,\n“[a]n out-of-court statement is not hearsay if offered to show the effect on the hearer,\nreader or viewer rather than to prove the truth of the content of the statement—e.g., that a\nparty had prior notice or knowledge; that a party was given a warning; or to prove a\nparty’s motive, good faith, fear, etc. (where such notice, knowledge, motive, fear, etc. is\nrelevant to an issue in the case).” (Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Trials and Evidence (The\nRutter Group 2013) ¶ 8:1049, italic omitted.) An extrajudicial statement is not hearsay if\nused “ ‘to prove . . . the . . . hearer . . . obtained certain information by hearing . . . the\nstatement and, believing such information to be true, acted in conformity with such\nbelief.’ [Citation.] . . . ‘The statement is not hearsay, since it is the hearer’s reaction to\nthe statement that is the relevant fact sought to be proved–not the truth of the matter\nasserted in the statement.’ ” (Holland v. Union Pacific Railroad Co. (2007)\n154 Cal.App.4th 940, 947, quoting 1 Jefferson, Cal. Evidence Benchbook (2d ed. 1982)\nHearsay & Nonhearsay, § 1.4, p. 57, italics omitted.) “However, ‘[a] hearsay objection to\nan out-of-court statement may not be overruled simply by identifying a nonhearsay\n\n\n                                                12\n\fpurpose for admitting the statement. The trial court must also find that the nonhearsay\npurpose is relevant to an issue in dispute.’ [Citation.]” (People v. Jablonski (2006)\n37 Cal.4th 774.)\n       Here, the specific statement at issue is Codrey telling Plaintiffs that Adaya said she\ndid not want Jewish people in her pool. The truth of the matter asserted in the statement\nis that Adaya made the anti-Semitic statement. We reason, and Defendants appear to\nagree, that Plaintiffs’ testimony was not being offered to prove that Adaya actually made\nthe statement. In their appellate brief, Defendants assert that “the comments were being\noffered to prove that Mr. Codrey in fact related these statements to others, which caused\nthem distress.” We agree. The purpose of Plaintiffs testifying to what they heard from\nCodrey was to show the effect of Codrey’s statement on the listener: to show that\nPlaintiffs understood that they were being removed from the pool due to their religion,\nwhich gave them cause for emotional distress. This nonhearsay purpose for admitting the\ntestimony is highly relevant to proving general damages for emotional distress and\nmental anguish in Plaintiffs’ tort and Unruh causes of action.\n       It is well established in California that out-of-court statements, when offered to\nshow the effect on the hearer, are admissible nonhearsay, as long as they are relevant.\n(See Cantrell v. Zolin (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 128, 132–133 [The police officer’s\nstatement that motorist was weaving was admissible, not to prove weaving, but to show\nthat the police officer had reasonable cause to stop motorist.]; People v. Dehnel (1979)\n99 Cal.App.3d 404, 408–409, [In a conspiracy to commit murder case, triple level out-of-\ncourt statement testimony, stating that Defendant had killed people before, was\nadmissible on behalf of the codefendant as circumstantial evidence of his state of mind];\nWiz Technology, Inc. v. Coopers & Lybrand (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 1, 13 [A declaration\nby defendant auditor that he had learned of the plaintiff’s breach of certain contract terms\nfrom other persons was not inadmissible hearsay because it was offered to prove the\nauditor’s good faith in refusing to perform the audit.]; People v. Jablonski, supra,\n37 Cal.4th at p. 820 [A victim’s statement that she was afraid of the defendant was\nadmissible to show, not that she was actually afraid, but rather to show the statement’s\n\n\n                                             13\n\feffect on the defendant and his premeditation of the crime.]; Estate of Nidever (1960)\n181 Cal.App.2d 367, 380 [Affidavits with multiple layers of out of court statements were\nadmissible over hearsay objections, when offered to show their effect on a person’s\nmental state as to her belief in the validity of her marriage].) Consistent with these cases,\nPlaintiffs’ testimony regarding Codrey’s statements were offered to show their effect on\nPlaintiffs and support damages for emotional distress.\n       Furthermore, even if admission of this evidence could be construed as error, it was\nharmless. (Grail Semiconductor, Inc. v. Mitsubishi Electric & Electronics USA, Inc.\n(2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 786, 799 [To obtain reversal, “[t]he appellant bears the burden of\nestablishing that the error was prejudicial.”].) At trial, Codrey’s deposition testimony\nwas read into the record. Among the many excerpts read to the jury, counsel read\nCodrey’s testimony stating that Adaya told him, “I don’t want any [f---ing] Jews in the\npool.” They also read the testimony where Codrey stated that he told Plaintiff Scott\nPaletz that Adaya made this statement and possibly others overheard him tell Paletz.\nTherefore, Plaintiffs’ additional testimony regarding what they heard from Codrey, or\neven what they heard from others third or fourth hand, is cumulative. It is not reasonably\nprobable that a result more favorable to Defendants would have been reached if\nPlaintiffs’ testimony regarding statements from Codrey was excluded, as the jury was\nalready well aware of Adaya’s discriminatory comments. (See Huffman v. Interstate\nBrands Corp. (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 679, 692, (Huffman) [“In civil cases, a miscarriage\nof justice should be declared only when the reviewing court, after an examination of the\nentire cause, including the evidence, is of the opinion that it is reasonably probable that a\nresult more favorable to the appealing party would have been reached in the absence of\nthe error.”].)\n\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\f       b.      Admission of Expert Testimony and Evidence of Adaya’s Religion and\nNationality Was Not Prejudicial Error\n       Defendants assert that the court’s admission of expert testimony from Rabbi\nWolpe and evidence of Adaya’s Pakistani Muslim background was prejudicial error.\nRabbi Wolpe testified that “several [Plaintiffs] were traumatized by what happened,” and\nthat “the conduct of . . . those . . . ultimately responsible at the hotel could fairly be\ncharacterized as anti-Semitic.” Defendants argued that this testimony should have been\nexcluded because it was the subject of common knowledge and such testimony usurped\nthe jury’s role as fact finder. As to the character evidence, Defendants assert that\nevidence of Adaya’s religion and nationality were inflammatory, evoked an emotional\nreaction with the jury, and lacked any probative value. In addition to other references\nregarding Adaya’s religion and nationality, the portion of Codrey’s deposition provided\nto the jury also stated that during the pool party conflict, Adaya “kept repeating that . . .\nthis was embarrassing to her; that she is a Muslim, her parents or family are Muslims, and\nthis is just absolutely wrong.”\n       Assuming without deciding that the admission of Rabbi Wolpe’s expert testimony\nand testimony regarding Adaya’s Pakistani Muslim background was error, we conclude\nthat it was not prejudicial and does not require reversal. “A judgment will not be set\naside based on the erroneous admission of evidence unless ‘the reviewing court is\nconvinced after an examination of the entire case, including the evidence, that it is\nreasonably probable a result more favorable to the appellant would have been reached\nabsent the error. [Citations.] Prejudice from error is never presumed but must be\naffirmatively demonstrated by the appellant. [Citations.]’ [Citation.]” (Hernandez v.\nCounty of Los Angeles (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1616; Cal. Const., art. VI, § 13;\nCode Civil Proc., § 475.)\n\n\n\n\n                                               15\n\f       Where an abundance of evidence supports the verdict, the erroneous admission of\nother evidence is harmless error, as it is not reasonably probable that the jury would have\nreached a verdict more favorable to the opposing party. (Bender v. County of Los\nAngeles (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 968, 984 [The trial court’s admission of evidence of\narrestee’s acquittal was harmless in arrestee’s action against deputy and county alleging\nthat he was arrested without probable cause, beaten, and pepper sprayed in violation of\nthe Bane Act, where the record showed an abundance of evidence from disinterested\nwitnesses that deputy arrested him without any reason to do so, and pepper-sprayed and\nbeat him while he was handcuffed and unresisting.]; Bisno v. Herzberg (1946)\n75 Cal.App.2d 235 [The admission of inadmissible evidence was harmless where “the\nproof was abundant without it.”]; Bailey v. Market St. Ry. Co. (1935) 3 Cal.App.2d 525,\n532 [“[A]s to each fact erroneously admitted there was an abundance of other evidence\non the same subject which was properly admitted and therefore the defendant suffered no\nprejudice.”]; Margolis v. Teplin (1958) 163 Cal.App.2d 526, 532–533 [“[T]he error in the\nadmission of some hearsay evidence (in an action tried by the court without a jury) is not\nprejudicial error, where there is otherwise enough competent evidence in the record to\nsupport the findings”].)\n       Here, an abundance of evidence supported Plaintiffs’ theory that Defendants\ndiscriminated against them because they were Jewish and that Defendants’ actions were\nanti-Semitic. Testimony from the 18 individual Plaintiffs all described Adaya’s behavior\nand how they were systematically denied hotel services based on their religion. As\nprovided in the first section of the Discussion, testimony from Plaintiff Nicholas\nMorrison established that Adaya had a very negative reaction when she learned that\nShangri-La was hosting a pool party for a Jewish organization. Quickly thereafter,\nAdaya dismantled the event. Furthermore, the court admitted Codrey’s testimony that\nAdaya stated: “I don’t want any [f---ing] Jews in the pool.” Codrey’s testimony also\nstated that Adaya said, “[i]f my parents find out that there is a Jewish event here, they’re\ngoing to pull money from me immediately.” This evidence alone was highly probative of\nPlaintiffs’ causes of action such that it was not reasonably probable a result more\n\n\n                                             16\n\ffavorable to the appellant would have been reached had the court excluded expert\ntestimony from Rabbi Wolpe and evidence of Adaya’s Pakistani Muslim background.\n       In light of the extensive evidence and particularly probative testimony regarding\nAdaya’s anti-Semitic statements and actions presented by Plaintiffs, we conclude that any\nerror with regard to these evidentiary rulings was harmless.\n       3.     Plaintiff Nussdorf Had Standing to Bring an Unruh Act Claim\n       Defendants assert that Plaintiff Adrianna Nussdorf lacked standing to bring claims\nunder the Unruh Act because she does not qualify as a “person aggrieved” under the\nstatute. (See § 52, subd. (c) [“any person aggrieved by the conduct [of persons violating\nUnruh] may bring a civil action in the appropriate court by filing with it a complaint”].)\nDefendants base their argument on Nussdorf’s testimony that her initial reaction to the\nevents at the pool party was that she thought it was ridiculous to speculate that FIDF\nmembers were being discriminated against and that the group was blaming the hotel for a\npoorly organized event.\n       This argument mischaracterizes Nussdorf’s testimony. Nussdorf testified that she\ndid not fully understand what was happening when the pool party was being shut down\nbecause she was stunned that the Appellants’ conduct would be motivated by\ndiscrimination. Nussdorf further testified that after she understood what happened, the\nevents made her feel terrible and had such an impact on her that she visited two doctors\nand began taking medication for sleeplessness and anxiety We conclude that this is\nsufficient evidence to show that she was a “person aggrieved” under Unruh.\n       4.     Punitive Damages Must be Reversed as Plaintiffs Received Statutory\nPenalties Under Section 52, Subdivision (a) that Were Punitive in Nature\n       Defendants assert that the “trial court erroneously permitted 11 Plaintiffs to collect\ndouble punishment for the same alleged conduct—first in the form of statutory Unruh\nAct ‘penalties’ and second in the form of ‘punitive damages’ in connection with their\n[intentional infliction of emotional distress] claims.” The court here awarded statutory\npenalties under section 52, which provides that, “[w]hoever denies, aids or incites a\ndenial, or makes any discrimination or distinction contrary to Section 51 . . . is liable for\n\n\n                                              17\n\feach and every offense for the actual damages, and any amount that may be determined\nby a jury, or a court sitting without a jury, up to a maximum of three times the amount of\nactual damage but in no case less than four thousand dollars ($4,000) . . . .” (Emphasis\nadded.) Defendants contend that statutory damages under Unruh, which allow a jury to\naward up to three times the amount of actual damage, are punitive, not compensatory.\nDefendants assert that because the statutory damages are punitive, Plaintiffs may not\nseparately collect punitive damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress to\npunish Defendants for essentially the same conduct. We review this question of law and\nissue of statutory interpretation de novo. (Babalola v. Superior Court (2011)\n192 Cal.App.4th 948, 956.)\n       It is well established that a plaintiff may not recover duplicative punitive damages\nfor the same conduct. “California courts have held that if a defendant is liable for a\nstatutory penalty or multiple damages under a statute, the award is punitive in nature, and\nthe award penalizes essentially the same conduct as an award of punitive damages. The\nplaintiff cannot recover punitive damages in addition to that recovery but must elect its\nremedy. [Citations.] To impose both a statutory penalty or multiple damages award and\npunitive damages in those circumstances would be duplicative. [Citations.] We presume\nthat the Legislature did not intend to allow such a double recovery absent a specific\nindication to the contrary. [Citations.]” (Fassberg Construction Co. v. Housing\nAuthority of City of Los Angeles (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 720, 759-760 (Fassberg).)\n       We conclude that the statutory damages under section 52(a) are punitive in nature.\n“[T]he purpose of punitive damages ‘is a purely public one. The public’s goal is to punish\nwrongdoing and thereby to protect itself from future misconduct, either by the same\ndefendant or other potential wrongdoers.’ ” (Power Standards Lab, Inc. v. Federal\nExpress Corp. (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1039, 1047, citing Adams v. Murakami (1991)\n54 Cal.3d 105, 110 [284 Cal.Rptr. 318, 813 P.2d 1348].) In Harris, supra, 52 Cal.3d at\np. 1172, the Supreme Court explained that section 52, subdivision (a)’s “damages\nprovision allowing for an exemplary award of up to treble the actual damages suffered\nwith a stated minimum amount reveals a desire to punish intentional and morally\n\n\n                                             18\n\foffensive conduct.” The Court expressly called the treble damages provision “a punitive\naward.” (Id. at p. 1152, fn. 5; Botosan v. Fitzhugh (S.D.Cal. 1998) 13 F.Supp.2d 1047,\n1052 [“The phrase ‘any amount as may be determined by a jury’ refers to punitive\ndamages.”].) As Unruh’s statutory damages are punitive, we must determine whether (a)\nthe legislature intended for a double recovery of punitive damages under Unruh, and (b)\nif not, whether the punitive damages at issue were based on the same conduct.\n       (a) The Legislature Did Not Intend to Allow Double Recovery\n       We begin with the presumption that absent a specific indication otherwise, the\nlegislature did not intend to allow for double recovery of punitive damages under section\n52, which sets forth the damages that can be recovered for Unruh violations. (See\nFassberg, supra, 152 Cal.App.4th at p. 760.) To rebut this presumption, Plaintiffs argued\nat oral argument that the language of section 52, subdivision (e) indicated that Unruh’s\ndamages were cumulative in nature. Section 52, subdivision (e) states that “[a]ctions\nbrought pursuant to this section are independent of any other actions, remedies, or\nprocedures that may be available to an aggrieved party pursuant to any other law.”\n       In interpreting the meaning of subdivision (e), we apply the canons of statutory\nconstruction. “Under settled canons of statutory construction, in construing a statute we\nascertain the Legislature’s intent in order to effectuate the law’s purpose.” (Imperial\nMerchant Services, Inc. v. Hunt (2009) 47 Cal.4th 381, 387.) We do this by first looking\nto the plain meaning of the statute’s language; the usual and ordinary meaning of the\nwords is controlling unless the words are ambiguous. (Id. at p. 387-388.) We also “give\neffect, whenever possible, to the statute as a whole, and to every word and clause thereof,\nleaving no part of the provision useless or deprived of meaning.” (Eisenhower Medical\nCenter v. Superior Court (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 430, 435.) In doing so, we do not “add\nor subtract words to or from the statute.” (Scottsdale Indemnity Co. v. National\nContinental Ins. Co. (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1166, 1172.) “ ‘If the statutory language\npermits more than one reasonable interpretation, courts may consider other aids, such as\nthe statute’s purpose, legislative history, and public policy.’ [Citation.]” (Imperial\nMerchant Services, Inc. v. Hunt, supra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 388.)\n\n\n                                             19\n\f       Here, subdivision (e) states that “[a]ctions” are independent of “other actions,\nremedies, or procedures” that a plaintiff can pursue. Applying the usual and ordinary\nmeaning of these words, it is clear that subdivision (e) permits a plaintiff to bring an\nUnruh cause of action while bringing other causes of action or seeking other remedies.\nNotably, subdivision (e) does not state that remedies under Unruh are independent of\nother remedies a plaintiff may seek. Plaintiffs’ proposed construction requires us to read\nadditional words into subdivision (e) in order to reach the conclusion that Unruh’s\nremedies are independent of other remedies. As stated above, the canons of statutory\nconstruction prohibit us from adding words to the statutory language in interpreting the\nstatute. Our interpretation of subdivision (e) is also supported by legislative history,\nwhich indicates that subdivision (e) was added to in order to create a private right of\naction for aggrieved persons, in addition to their preexisting, previously exclusive remedy\nof filing a complaint with the Fair Employment Practices Commission. (Assem. Com. on\nLabor Relations, Analysis of Assem. Bill 2986 (1975-1976 Reg. Sess.) Apr. 20, 1976\nReport; Assem. Com. On Ways & Means, Staff Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 2986 (1975-\n1976 Reg. Sess.) as amended April 26, 1976.)\n       We therefore conclude that section 52 does not permit duplicative recovery of\npunitive damages for the same conduct. Had the legislature intended for plaintiffs to be\nable to have an Unruh remedy independent of other remedies, it would have explicitly\nsaid so. (See Troensegaard v. Silvercrest Industries, Inc. (1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 218,\n228 [“We are of the opinion that had the Legislature, by Civil Code sections 3294\n(permitting punitive damages ) and 1794 (permitting a civil penalty), intended a double\nrecovery of punitive and penal damages for the same willful, oppressive, malicious, and\noppressive acts, it would in some appropriate manner have said so.”].) Thus, the\nremaining issue is whether the statutory Unruh damages and the intentional infliction of\nemotional distress damages were based on the same conduct.\n\n\n\n\n                                             20\n\f       (b) Defendants Have Violated a Single Primary Right, Giving Rise to a Single\nCause of Action for Punitive Damages\n       The Supreme Court has explained that “a ‘cause of action’ is comprised of a\n‘primary right’ of the plaintiff, a corresponding ‘primary duty’ of the defendant, and a\nwrongful act by the defendant constituting a breach of that duty. [Citation.] The most\nsalient characteristic of a primary right is that it is indivisible: the violation of a single\nprimary right gives rise to but a single cause of action. [Citation.]” (Crowley v.\nKatleman (1994) 8 Cal.4th 666, 681.) “Although ‘the phrase “causes of action” is often\nused indiscriminately . . . to mean counts which state differently the same cause of action’\n[citation], its more precise meaning ‘is the right to obtain redress for a harm suffered’\n[citation]. ‘ “Even where there are multiple legal theories upon which recovery might be\npredicated, one injury gives rise to only one claim for relief.” ’ [Citations.]” (Hayes v.\nCounty of San Diego (2013) 57 Cal.4th 622, 631.) Meaning, where one primary right has\nbeen violated, i.e. one injury incurred, a plaintiff can only be awarded punitive damages\nonce. (See Plotnik v. Meihaus (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 1590, 1611-1612 [Where the\nplaintiff suffers a single injury, the jury’s special verdict awarding emotional distress\ndamages on several separate theories of negligence, trespass, negligent infliction of\nemotional distress, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, was impermissible\ndouble recovery.].)\n       The record shows that the individual Plaintiffs each suffered one injury:\nDefendants discriminated against them by refusing to provide them services at the hotel\npool because they were Jewish. This is supported by Plaintiffs’ testimony, which\nidentifies a course of conduct systematically depriving Plaintiffs of hotel amenities and\nservices that was motivated by discrimination. For instance, Plaintiff Laura Lugash\nsummarizes the events at the pool that led her to believe the conduct was antisemitic as,\n“being stopped before entering the pool, being told to get out of the pool, and watching\n[Adaya] gesturing and being angry.” Her summary describes the heart of this lawsuit:\ndeprivation of pool amenities due to discrimination. Although each Plaintiff had a\ndifferent experience at the pool and different reactions to Defendants’ behavior, all\n\n\n                                               21\n\fsuffered the same primary right violation of being deprived of pool amenities due to\nDefendants’ anti-Semitism. Plaintiffs’ intentional infliction of emotional distress and\nUnruh causes of action are simply two different legal theories for recovering punitive\ndamages for that same injury.\n       Plaintiffs argue that they did not receive “an award of statutory penalties and\npunitive damages based on the same conduct,” asserting that “the jury based its findings\non separate acts of misconduct.” Plaintiffs support this argument by citing the trial\ncourt’s decision denying Defendants’ motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on\nthis issue. There, the court stated that the jury’s “careful distinctions are apparent in the\ndamages awards in [that] the jury’s verdict as to each of the plaintiffs strongly suggests\nthat the jury was making such distinctions on different acts and impacts suffered by each\nplaintiff.”\n       Based on our review of the record, we conclude that it is unreasonable to assume\nthat the jury’s findings were based on separate acts of misconduct because Defendants’\nconduct was not easily divisible. Although Plaintiffs generally state that there was a wide\narray of different acts carried out over many hours, Plaintiffs fail to indentify for this\nCourt the different acts that were specifically attributable to the Unruh violation and the\nintentional infliction of emotional distress for each of the nine Plaintiffs who received\nstatutory and punitive damages. Nor do Plaintiffs identify multiple primary rights that\nhave been violated. As explained above, based on our review of the record, Plaintiffs\nsuffered injury from the violation of a single primary right as Defendants’ conduct\nconsisted of depriving Plaintiffs of Shangri-La’s pool amenities based on a\ndiscriminatory motive. Additionally, the distinctions in the damages awards are most\nnoticeable when comparing awards received by different Plaintiffs, and appear to be the\nproduct of each Plaintiff’s testimony regarding the varying impacts Defendants’ conduct\nhad on them individually.\n\n\n\n\n                                              22\n\f       Plaintiffs also argue that any ambiguity that exists in the jury verdicts was invited\nby Defendants and as such, it is not a basis for reversal of the punitive damages award.\n“Under the doctrine of ‘invited error’ a party cannot successfully take advantage of error\ncommitted by the court at his request. Thus, on appeal a litigant cannot object to the\nadmission of incompetent evidence offered by him. [Citation.] He cannot complain of\nerror in instructions requested by him. [Citations.] Nor can he challenge a finding of the\ntrial court made at his instance. [Citations.]” (Jentick v. Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. (1941)\n18 Cal.2d 117, 121.) “The doctrine of invited error bars an appellant from attacking a\nverdict that resulted from a jury instruction given at the appellant’s request.” (Stevens v.\nOwens–Corning Fiberglas Corp. (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1645, 1653.)\n       Here, Defendants never requested the court to issue an incorrect instruction, nor\ndid they object to an instruction that would have remedied this issue. Rather, Plaintiffs\nproposed an instruction (a modified version of Judicial Council of California Civil Jury\nInstructions No. 3934) that stated:\n       “The following additional items of damages are recoverable only once per\n       Plaintiff suing for Discrimination, Intentional Infliction of Emotional\n       Distress, Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress, Intentional\n       Interference with Contractual Relations, and Intentional Interference with\n       Prospective Economic Advantage:\n       1. Exemplary and/or punitive damages.\n       The following additional items of damages are recoverable only once per\n       Plaintiff suing for Discrimination:\n       1. Statutory damages in the minimum amount of $4,000.”\nContrary to Plaintiffs’ assertion that this instruction “was designed to avoid juror\nconfusion” and “would have informed the jury it could not award duplicative damages\nfor the same act,” (emphasis in original) this proposed instruction did not address the\nissue of duplicative damages in the context of awarding punitive damages and punitive\nstatutory penalties for the same conduct. Defendants appropriately objected to this\ninstruction at trial to the extent that it appeared to allow for duplicative recovery of\n\n\n                                              23\n\fpunitive damages. Thus, in having the court dispose of this instruction, Defendants took\nno affirmative steps to invite error.\n       To the extent that Plaintiffs assert that the doctrine of invited error applies because\nDefendants did not propose an alternative instruction and did not propose special\ninterrogatories that would “elicit information about [on] what conduct the jury based its\nawards,” we disagree. Defendants “are deemed to have excepted to every instruction\ngiven and are therefore not barred by their failure to offer an alternative instruction from\nasserting error in the instruction as given.

That is the equivalent of a specific objection to all his\nadversaries’ instructions.” Hensley v. Harris (1957) 151 Cal.App.2d 821, 826; Rivera v.\nParma (1960) 54 Cal.2d 313, 316 [stating the same].) Here, Defendants had no duty to\nsubmit an instruction that furthered Plaintiff’s theory of the case that the Unruh and\nintentional infliction of emotional distress causes of action were based on different\nconduct. Defendants are thus not estopped from raising this error simply because they\ndid not propose alternative instructions or interrogatories on this topic at trial.\n       Moreover, because the Unruh violation and the intentional infliction of emotional\ndistress claim are based on the same conduct, a different jury instruction or the use of\nspecial interrogatories were not the solution to preventing duplicative recovery of\npunitive damages. Plaintiffs were entitled to pursue both legal theories (which were both\npremised on Defendants’ violation of the same primary right) until the jury rendered its\nverdict. (North American Chemical Co. v. Superior Court (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 764,\n774 [Where there are multiple legal theories for a violation of a single right, “the plaintiff\n\n\n                                              24\n\fis entitled to pursue both legal theories until an occasion for an election of remedies\narises.”].) At that point in time, Plaintiffs were to have elected their remedies.\n(Fassberg, supra, 152 Cal.App.4th at pp. 759-760 [“California courts have held that if a\ndefendant is liable for a statutory penalty or multiple damages under a statute, the award\nis punitive in nature, and the award penalizes essentially the same conduct as an award of\npunitive damages. The plaintiff cannot recover punitive damages in addition to that\nrecovery but must elect its remedy.”].) Therefore, Plaintiffs cannot receive both awards\nand must elect their remedy.\n       As the award from the Unruh statutory penalties received by each individual\nPlaintiff is greater than that awarded for their individual emotional distress punitive\ndamages, we conclude that emotional distress punitive damages awarded in phase two of\nthe trial must be reversed. Notably, this ruling does not affect Plaintiff Platinum’s award\nof punitive damages, which does not overlap with any other punitive relief.\n       5.     Instructions Related to Statutory Penalties Did Not Result in Error\n       Defendants assert that the “trial court issued two sets of improper jury instructions\nregarding the calculation of Unruh Act statutory penalties.” Defendants contend that the\n“court ultimately erred by instructing the jury to award three times the actual damages in\nstatutory penalties, which removed the jury’s discretion in determining the amount of\npenalties.” To the extent that Plaintiffs argue that Defendants failed to object to the\ninstruction and thus waived this issue on appeal, “in a civil case, a party is deemed to\nhave objected to an erroneous jury instruction; there is no waiver for failure to object.\n(Huffman[, supra,] 121 Cal.App.4th [at p.] 705, 17 Cal.Rptr.3d 397.)” (Maureen K. v.\nTuschka (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 519, 530.) We therefore address the instructional issues\nraised by Defendants.\n\n\n\n\n                                             25\n\f       “The court’s duty to instruct the jury is discharged if its instructions embrace all\npoints of law necessary to a decision. [Citation] A party is not entitled to have the jury\ninstructed in any particular fashion or phraseology, and may not complain if the court\ncorrectly gives the substance of the applicable law. [Citation]” (Thompson Pacific\nConstruction, Inc. v. City of Sunnyvale (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 525, 553.) “We review\nchallenges to the propriety of jury instructions in correctly stating the relevant law under\nthe de novo standard of review. [Citation.]) “Not all instructional errors require reversal\nand a new trial. To obtain a reversal, an appellant must establish that the error was\nprejudicial.” (Adams v. MHC Colony Park L.P. (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 601, 613.) This\nmeans that it must appear reasonably probable that without the instructional error, the\njury’s verdict would have been more favorable to Defendants. (Scott v. Rayhrer (2010)\n185 Cal.App.4th 1535, 1540.) “ ‘Here the question is, how would a reasonable juror\nunderstand the instruction. [Citation.] In addressing this question, we consider the\nspecific language under challenge and, if necessary, the charge in its entirety. [Citation.]\nFinally, we determine whether the instruction, so understood, states the applicable law\ncorrectly.’ [Citation.]” (People v. Woodward (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 821, 834.)\n       The instruction at issue addressed damages that the jury could award Plaintiffs for\nviolation of Unruh, under section 52, subdivision (a). Section 52 provides that a plaintiff\ncan recover “actual damages, and any amount that may be determined by a jury . . . up to\na maximum of three times the amount of actual damage but in no case less than four\nthousand dollars ($4,000).” (§ 52, subd. (a).) Here, the court provided two instructions\non this issue, one instruction read to and provided in writing to the jury with the other\njury instructions and one subsequent, correctional instruction regarding the jury’s initially\ninsufficient verdict. (See Code Civil Proc., § 619 [“When the verdict is announced, if it\nis informal or insufficient, in not covering the issue submitted, it may be corrected by the\njury under the advice of the court, or the jury may be again sent out.”]; Crowe v. Sacks\n(1955) 44 Cal.2d 590, 596-597 [“A verdict which goes beyond the issues of the case as\nstated in the instructions on the law given by the court to the jury, is not in conformity\nwith the instructions and is therefore ‘insufficient.’ Instances of this are: where the jury\n\n\n                                             26\n\freturned a verdict for $14,200 although it had been instructed by the court that the\nstatutory maximum liability was $4,140”]; Mizel v. City of Santa Monica (2001)\n93 Cal.App.4th 1059, 1072, [If a jury renders inconsistent verdicts, it is “prudent,\neconomical, and judicious” for the trial court to provide further instruction for the jury to\ncorrect the inconsistencies.].)\n       The initial jury instruction stated: “If you decide that Plaintiffs have proved their\nclaim against Defendants, you also must decide how much money will reasonably\ncompensate them for the harm. This compensation is called ‘damages.’ [¶] Plaintiffs\nmust prove the amount of their damages. However, Plaintiffs do not have to prove the\nexact amount of the harm or the exact amount of damages that will provide reasonable\ncompensation for the harm. You must not speculate or guess in awarding damages. [¶]\nThe following are specific items of damages claimed by Plaintiffs: [¶] Statutory\ndamages in the minimum amount of $4,000 per Plaintiff, as well as compensatory\ndamages for each Plaintiff’s pain, suffering, inconvenience, emotional distress, medical\nexpenses to-date, and future medical expenses. [¶] In addition, you may award Plaintiffs\nup to three times the amount of their actual damages as a penalty against Defendants.”\nBased on these instructions, the jury initially awarded Unruh statutory penalties to nine\nPlaintiffs greater than three times the amount of the actual damages awarded.\n       The court sent the jury back to fix the damages award with a clarifying instruction.\nThe court stated: “The Court has reviewed the verdict forms. . . . [W]ith respect to a\nnumber of these, . . . it appears to the court that the calculation of statutory damages\nawarded for the Unruh Act claims does not comply with the instructions. . . . [S]tatutory\ndamages cannot exceed three times the amount of the actual damages, and, for example,\nin the case of Mr. Scott Paletz, you have awarded actual damages of [$]2500, but\nstatutory damages of [$]30,000, which far exceeds three times [$]2500. . . . A similar\nerror occurs in the verdict form as to Mr. Fowler, Mr. Ryan, Mr. Rubin, Mr. Newburger,\nMr. Morrison, Laura Morrison, Mr. Shuman, and Mr. Gold.” The court advised the jury:\n“I’m going to send you back in, I’m going to ask you to recalculate these. . . . I’m going\nto leave it up to you. You can decide whether you want to reassess the actual damages or\n\n\n                                             27\n\fyou simply want to go back and recalculate statutory damages as three times the amount\nyou’ve already found, not to exceed three times the amount of actual damages you found.\nAnd if you want to do it that way, it’s a simple mathematical clarification. . . . I’ll ask the\njurors to please go back into the jury room and make the appropriate adjustments as you\nsee fit.” The jury then returned verdicts that comported with Unruh’s maximum damages\nrequirements, awarding the nine Plaintiffs three times the amount of their actual damages\nfor the statutory damages.\n       Defendants assert that the second instruction “failed to account for the fact that the\njury’s lump-sum actual-damages award for all claims may not have included\ncompensation for the Unruh Act claim (or, at the very least, it is likely that not 100% of\nthe compensatory award was for the Unruh Act claim).” We disagree. A reasonable\njuror would understand the court’s subsequent corrective instruction to indicate that the\nstatutory penalties were not to exceed three times the actual damages incurred by\nDefendants’ Unruh violation, and were not to be based on any of the tort causes of action.\nFurthermore, the actual damages awarded under Unruh encompass the damages a\nplaintiff would receive under the emotional distress or negligence claims. Pursuant to\nsection 52, subdivision (h), the actual damages that can be recovered under Unruh are\nboth “special and general damages.” Actual damages are “compensatory damages [that]\ninclude nonquantifiable general damages for emotional distress and pecuniarily\nmeasurable special damages for out-of-pocket losses.” (Walnut Creek Manor v. Fair\nEmployment & Housing Com. (1991) 54 Cal.3d 245, 255 [analyzing the term “actual\ndamages” within housing anti-discrimination statute].) “[G]eneral damages are those\nlosses which naturally flow from the injury and which are not quantifiable by reference to\nbills or receipts. Thus, damages for pain, suffering and emotional distress are\nparadigmatic examples of general damages.” (Beeman v. Burling (1990) 216 Cal.App.3d\n1586, 1600.) Actual damages defined by Unruh are the same damages that would be\nrecovered under the tort causes of action for intentional and negligent infliction of\nemotional distress and negligence, e.g. pain, suffering, and emotional distress.\n\n\n\n                                              28\n\f       In addition, Defendants argue that the “instructions also directed the jury to award\ntreble damages, even though the Unruh Act leaves the amount of any penalty in the jury’s\ndiscretion (as long as it is greater than $4,000 and less than treble the actual damages).”\nDefendants state that it is possible that the “jury may have issued a lower statutory\ndamages award had the trial court properly stated the law.”\n       We conclude that a reasonable juror would not construe the court’s corrective\ninstruction to mandate an award of treble damages. The court clearly stated that the\nmaximum statutory penalty was treble damages, not that it was the mandated penalty.\nThe court repeatedly stated it was in the jury’s discretion to determine what amount to\naward, stating “I’m going to leave it up to you. You can decide . . . I’ll ask the jurors to\nplease go back into the jury room and make the appropriate adjustments as you see fit.”\nThese instructions did not misguide the jury in their deliberations. Furthermore,\nDefendants’ theory is not supported by the jury verdicts actually rendered. There are\neight Plaintiffs who received less than three times the amount of their actual damage\naward on the jury’s first attempt at calculating damages If the jury had understood the\ncourt’s instruction to mandate treble damages under Unruh, the jury would have altered\nthese statutory penalties accordingly. Yet, after receiving the second instruction from the\ncourt, the jury did not subsequently change these eight awards to be equal to three times\nthe actual damages. It is apparent from the record that the jury properly understood the\ninstruction to require them to award a maximum of treble actual damages in statutory\npenalties.\n       We thus conclude that the court properly discharged its duty to instruct the jury\nwith regard to Unruh statutory damages when it issued the corrective instruction. We\naffirm statutory award of damages on this ground.\n\n\n\n\n                                             29\n\f       6.     We Remand the Attorney Fee Award for the Court to Recalculate Fees\nAttributable to Platinum’s Causes of Action\n       Here, the court awarded $2,099,785.50 in attorney fees to the individual Plaintiffs.\nThe basis for this award was Civil Code section 52, subdivision (a), which expressly\nallows for recovery of attorney fees for Unruh causes of action. In their motion for\nattorney fees related to the Unruh cause of action, Plaintiffs presented the court with an\naffidavit from the supervising attorney describing the work performed and reasonableness\nof each attorney’s hourly rates, and a 140-page exhibit documenting more than two years\nworth of block billing entries.3 In their motion, Plaintiffs did not delineate between fees\nassociated with Unruh and fees associated with the other causes of action, which had no\nstatutory basis for compensation of attorney fees. Rather, Plaintiffs asserted that the\ncauses of action were inextricably intertwined and that it would be impracticable to\nattempt to apportion the fees related to Unruh and those related to the other claims for\nrelief. Defendants opposed the motion, arguing in pertinent part, that Plaintiffs’\ncounsel’s block billing made it impossible to apportion fees and that the fee award should\nbe reduced by the fees associated with Platinum’s causes of action and by discovery\nsanctions that they previously paid.\n       In awarding attorney fees, the court allocated to Plaintiffs fees for almost all of\ntheir counsel’s work on the case. The court reduced Plaintiffs’ total claim for fees by the\nbilling the court discerned to be associated with (1) the intentional infliction of emotional\ndistress punitive damages phase of trial, (2) Plaintiff Platinum’s claims, and (3) a\ndiscovery dispute, for which Defendants already paid sanctions. In explaining how it\nassessed these amounts, the court described its computations for each deduction.\n\n\n\n\n3\n      Block billing refers to “billing for multiple tasks in a single entry.” (Charnay v.\nCobert (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 170, 177, fn. 8.)\n\n\n                                             30\n\f       First, the court stated that it “deducted $41,893 from the total claim for fees\nassociated with the punitive damages phase of the trial because such fees are not\nrecoverable.” (Boldface omitted.) Notably, this punitive damages phase of trial was\nsolely attributable to Plaintiffs’ punitive damages recovery for intentional infliction of\nemotional distress, and had nothing to do with recovery under Unruh. The $41,893\nfigure was derived by adding up all of Plaintiffs’ counsel’s billing entries associated with\nthe second phase of trial.\n       Second, the court also explained that it “deducted $70,468 from the total claim\nbased on its calculation of the portion of fees reasonably attributable to Platinum’s claims\nwhich are also not recoverable.” (Boldface omitted.) In determining the fees attributable\nto Platinum’s claims, the court reasoned that “since Platinum’s total recovery was\napproximately 3.2% of the total recovery of all the plaintiffs, it is reasonable to attribute\nthat percentage of the time spent to work relating to Platinum’s claims.” The court\ncalculated that $70,468 was 3.2% of the attorney fees claimed by Plaintiffs.\n       Lastly, the court stated that it “deducted $10,000 for the fees associated with a\ndiscovery dispute that were previously paid by Defendants as sanctions.” (Boldface\nomitted.) The total deductions amounted to $122,371.\n       The court chose not to apportion fees associated with the individual Plaintiffs’ tort\ncauses of action from fees associated with their cause of action for Unruh. The court\nstated that it “carefully considered the complexity of the litigation, the fact that the\nplaintiffs’ claims, as tried, were substantially interrelated and the defendants have not\npointed out any rational way to segregate the fees attributable to non-Unruh Act claims as\nto the individual plaintiffs.” The court awarded a total of $2,099,785.50 in attorney fees\nto Plaintiffs for their successful Unruh claims.\n       On appeal, Defendants assert that we should reverse the attorney fee award,\ncontending that (1) the trial court failed to apportion out fees unrelated to the Unruh\nclaims; (2) the trial court used an unreasonable method for deducting fees related to\nPlaintiff Platinum’s claims; and (3) the trial court erred in not applying the lodestar\nmethod for calculating fees. We review the court’s attorney fee award for an abuse of\n\n\n                                              31\n\fdiscretion. (Visher v. City of Malibu (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 364.) “ ‘[T]he appropriate\ntest for abuse of discretion is whether the trial court exceeded the bounds of reason.’ ”\n(Dove Audio, Inc. v. Rosenfeld, Meyer & Susman (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 777, 785,\nquoting Shamblin v. Brattain (1988) 44 Cal.3d 474, 478 [243 Cal.Rptr.902, 749 P.2d\n339].) “ ‘The burden is on the party complaining to establish that discretion was clearly\nabused and a miscarriage of justice resulted.’ [Citations.]” (Maxim Crane Works, L.P. v.\nTilbury Constructors (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 286, 297-298.)\n       When assessing attorney fees, the trial court “begins with a touchstone or lodestar\nfigure, based on the ‘careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable hourly\ncompensation of each attorney . . . involved in the presentation of the case.’ ” (Ketchum\nv. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1131-1132 (Ketchum) citing Serrano v. Priest (1977)\n20 Cal.3d 25, 48.) The Supreme Court has explained that “the lodestar is the basic fee for\ncomparable legal services in the community; it may be adjusted by the court based on\nfactors including, as relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions\ninvolved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of\nthe litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of\nthe fee award. [Citation.] The purpose of such adjustment is to fix a fee at the fair\nmarket value for the particular action.” (Ketchum, at p. 1132.)\n       As the lodestar method for calculating attorney fees guides our analysis, we\ncharacterize Defendants’ arguments regarding the attorney fees into two categories:\nchallenges to the attorneys’ reasonable hourly rates and challenges to the amount of time\nfor which Plaintiffs’ attorneys seek compensation. We address each set of arguments in\nturn, expending the bulk of our analysis on the court’s calculation of compensable hours,\nwhich Defendants have focused on at trial and on appeal.\n       a.     Plaintiffs’ Hourly Fees Were Reasonable\n       Defendants contend that the court erred in its attorney fees analysis because “[t]he\norder awarding fees contains no findings as to the reasonableness of the rates or the hours\nexpended, nor does it indicate whether the court actually reviewed the individual time\nentries.” Yet, the “trial court is not required ‘to issue a statement of decision with regard\n\n\n                                             32\n\fto the fee award,’ or to provide detailed reasons for overruling objections to a fee request.\n[Citation.] . . . ‘No specific findings reflecting the court’s calculations [are] required.\n[Citation.] “The record need only show that the attorney fees were awarded according to\nthe ‘lodestar’ or ‘touchstone’ approach.” [Citation.] On appeal we infer all findings in\nfavor of the prevailing parties.’ [Citation.]” (Lockaway Storage v. County of Alameda\n(2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 161, 192-193.) In other words, “[i]n reviewing a challenged\naward of attorney fees and costs, we presume that the trial court considered all\nappropriate factors in selecting a multiplier and applying it to the lodestar figure.\n[Citation.]” (Ramos v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 615, 621.)\n       Here, Mr. James H. Turken, a partner at the firm representing Plaintiffs and the\nsupervising attorney of the litigation at issue in this case, provided a declaration in\nsupport of the motion for attorney fees. In the declaration, he explained each attorney’s\nrole in the litigation, their level of experience, and their corresponding hourly rate. The\nrates varied from $200 per hour for the most junior associate to $675 per hour for the\nmost senior attorney who had more than 30 years of experience. Mr. Turken attested that\n“[t]he hourly fees charged by [Plaintiffs’ counsel’s firm] are lower than or comparable to\nthose by similar firms.” He asserted that to the best of his knowledge, the fees Plaintiffs\nrequested were “correct and were necessarily incurred in preparing for the trial in this\naction.” Attached to and identified within Mr. Turken’s declaration were over 140 pages\nof block billing entries, which set forth the work performed by Plaintiffs’ attorneys prior\nto and during trial. The court relied on Mr. Turken’s declaration and the billing records\nto make its determinations regarding time spent on Unruh aspects of the litigation and\nreasonable hourly rates. Defendants failed to submit credible evidence to contest the\nbilling entries. Rather, they submitted handwritten notes on billing entries from an\nassociate without providing her qualifications to perform such an analysis of billing\nentries.\n\n\n\n\n                                              33\n\f       With the standard of review in mind, we presume the court found Mr. Turken’s\nexplanation of the hourly rates credible and relied on Plaintiffs’ evidence to determine the\nreasonable amount of attorney fees. This appears particularly true as the hourly rates\nwere unaltered by the court and Defendant did not provide any evidence that such rates\nwere unreasonable. Below, Defendants only argued that multiple attorneys billing for the\nsame task made the fees unreasonable, that the tasks were not legal in nature, or that\nblock billing made it difficult to discern what work was attributable to Unruh. As the\nreasonableness of the hourly rates went unchallenged below, we lack any evidence to\nsupport a conclusion that the court abused its discretion when it implicitly found that such\nfees were reasonable. (See In re S.B. (2004) 32 Cal.4th 1287, 1293 [“a reviewing court\nordinarily will not consider a challenge to a ruling if an objection could have been but\nwas not made in the trial court”], superseded on other grounds by Welf. & Inst. Code\n§ 366.26, subd. (c)(4)(C).)\n       We thus affirm the court’s analysis with regard to the reasonableness of Plaintiffs’\ncounsel’s hourly rates.\n       b.     The Court’s Determination that the Individual Plaintiffs’ Causes of Action\nWere Inextricably Intertwined And Thus Not Practicable for Apportionment Was Proper\n       Defendants state that, “Plaintiffs were not entitled to collect fees for the large\nportion of their counsel’s work that was necessarily unrelated to the Unruh Act.”\nDefendants argue that the court’s failure to apportion fees between the individual\nPlaintiffs’ tort causes of action was an abuse of discretion because “it is not true that all\nof the attorneys’ time was spent on issues that are ‘inextricably intertwined’ with the\nUnruh Act.” Defendants take issue with Plaintiffs’ counsel using block billing, arguing\nthat the court “declined to make a good faith attempt to apportion fees,” instead awarding\nPlaintiffs substantially all of their requested fees.\n\n\n\n\n                                               34\n\f       It is well established that apportionment of attorney fees “is within the trial court’s\ndiscretion.” (El Escorial Owners’ Assn. v. DLC Plastering, Inc. (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th\n1337, 1365.) “Attorneys fees need not be apportioned between distinct causes of action\nwhere [a] plaintiff’s various claims involve a common core of facts or are based on\nrelated legal theories.” (Drouin v. Fleetwood Enterprises (1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 486,\n493.) “Such fees need not be apportioned when incurred for representation on an issue\ncommon to both causes of action in which fees are proper and those in which they are\nnot. [Citation.] Apportionment is not required when the claims for relief are so\nintertwined that it would be impracticable, if not impossible, to separate the attorney’s\ntime into compensable and noncompensable units. [Citations.]” (Bell v. Vista Unified\nSchool Dist. (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 672, 687 (Bell).)\n       Contrary to Defendants’ contentions, the trial court made a good faith attempt to\napportion damages between the Unruh and tort claims, and did not abuse its discretion.\nThe four causes of action asserted by the individual Plaintiffs are intertwined: all involve\nproof of the same core set of facts and development of the same set of evidence. Each\ncause of action is based on the theory that Defendants denied Plaintiffs access to hotel\nservices because they were Jewish. Issues common to all causes of action were pervasive\nthroughout the litigation, such that apportionment of fees was impracticable. Therefore\nthe court’s decision not to apportion damages with regard to the individual Plaintiffs’\ncauses of action did not result in an abuse of discretion.\n       Defendants argue that they should not have to pay “extra fees because Plaintiffs’\ncounsel chose to block bill.” It is well established that “block billing is not objectionable\n‘per se,’ ” though it may “increase the risk that the trial court, in a reasonable exercise of\nits discretion, will discount a fee request.” (Jaramillo v. County of Orange (2011)\n200 Cal.App.4th 811, 830; see Downey Cares v. Downey Community Development Com.\n(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 983, 997 [“Where a lawsuit consists of related claims, and the\nplaintiff has won substantial relief, a trial court has discretion to award all or substantially\nall of the plaintiff's fees even if the court did not adopt each contention raised.”].) As\nexplained above, the causes of action were so intertwined that it would be impracticable,\n\n\n                                              35\n\fif not impossible, to separate the attorney’s time into compensable and noncompensable\nunits for the causes of action asserted by the individual Plaintiffs. Even if the billing\nentries were further broken down, the work would likely be attributable to Unruh causes\nof action based on the nature of Plaintiffs’ claims and how they were presented at trial.\n“The ‘experienced trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional services\nrendered in his court, and . . . his judgment . . . will not be disturbed unless the appellate\ncourt is convinced that it is clearly wrong.’ [Citations.]” (Serrano v. Priest, supra,\n20 Cal.3d at p. 49.) We conclude that the trial court properly exercised its discretion and\njudgment in relying on the block billing entries under the facts of this case.\n       Defendants also assert that the court impermissibly shifted the burden to\nDefendants to apportion fees related to Unruh and those related to the other causes of\naction. Yet, as the court pointed out, “Plaintiffs’ fee claim is supported by detailed\nbilling records covering the two plus years of time from the plaintiffs’ first meeting with\ntheir law firm in August, 2010 up to and including post trial work on the fee application\nand costs bill in December, 2012. The Plaintiffs also submitted a declaration by the lead\ntrial attorney, Mr. James Turken, supporting the billing rates utilized and the time spent\nin litigating this complex case.” Based on the court’s reliance on this evidence in\nrendering the fee award, it can be deduced that the court implicitly found that Plaintiffs\nmet their burden to establish the fees that were permissible for them to recover based on\ncredible evidence. The court noted that in opposition, Defendants “submitted an analysis\nof the billing made by an associate in their firm identifying . . . ‘objectionable’ fee\nentries. However, the Defendants presented no evidence of the competence of that\nindividual to assess the appropriateness of the entries.” Consistent with the court’s\nfindings, the record reveals that Defendants submitted an associate’s declaration which\nfailed to set forth her qualifications to establish that she was competent to assess the\nbilling. This declaration was accompanied by copies of Plaintiffs’ billing records\ncovered in the associate’s hand-written notes next to entries, stating “nonfee,” “non-\nbillable, non-legal, admin,” “duplicative,” “superfluous,” and other words. Defendants\nfailed to produce any competent evidence in support of their opposition. Defendants also\n\n\n                                              36\n\fdid not propose an alternative method for calculating the fees or present calculations\nregarding how to reduce the fees. The Court stated that Defendants simply argued that\n“the mere identification of the entries as ‘objectionable block-billing entries,’ requires the\nCourt to reject them in toto.” We conclude that the court did not impermissibly shift the\nburden to Defendants to apportion attorney fees. Rather, Plaintiffs met their burden in\nproving their fees and Defendants failed to produce any creditable evidence to the\ncontrary.\n       Defendants’ evidentiary shortcomings also impact Defendants’ contention that the\n“trial court erred in awarding fees to Plaintiffs for noncompensable activities,4 such as\nmarketing and press work, and various inefficiencies and duplicative efforts.” As\nexplained in the preceding paragraph, Defendants’ argument regarding allegedly\nimproper billing entries is unsupported by competent evidence. When challenging\nattorney fees, “it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific items\nchallenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence. General arguments\nthat fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.” (Premier\nMedical Management Systems, Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2008)\n163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.) “ ‘It is the burden of the party challenging the fee award on\nappeal to provide an adequate record to assess error.’ ” (Ketchum v. Moses, supra,\n24 Cal.4th at pp. 1140–1141.) We will not engage in a factual analysis of these\nundeveloped issues on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n4\n       We note that these alleged “noncompensable activities” can at times, warrant\ncompensation. (See Davis v. City and County of San Francisco (9th Cir. 1992) 976 F.2d\n1536, 1545 [public relations efforts that contribute “directly and substantially, to the\nattainment of [the plaintiffs’] litigation goals” may be compensable], rehg. denied, judg.\nvacated in part and cause remanded (9th Cir. 1993) 984 F.2d 345.)\n\n\n                                              37\n\f       Citing Bell, supra, 82 Cal.App.4th at p. 689, Defendants assert that when\npresented with block billing in a fee request, the court must assign “a reasonable\npercentage to entries or simply cast them aside.” Defendants take this quotation out of\ncontext. In Bell, the Court held that where the plaintiff’s counsel admitted that the\nmajority of his block billing entries were spent on issues unrelated to that for which he\ncould recover attorney fees, the court should have exercised its discretion to assign a\nreasonable percentage to the entries appropriate for recovery, or not award fees for those\nentries. (Ibid.) That is not the case here, where there is no evidence that any of the\nentries for the individual Plaintiffs’ causes of action were attributable mostly or divisibly\nto issues unassociated with Unruh claims.\n       For the reasons stated above, we affirm the trial court’s decision not to apportion\nfees for the individual Plaintiffs’ causes of action and the court’s exercise of discretion to\nrely on Plaintiffs’ block billing evidence. To this extent, the court did not err in\ndetermining the attorney fee award.\n       c.     The Court Abused Its Discretion by Applying an Unreasonable\nMethodology for Deducting Fees Associated with Platinum’s Claims\n       Defendants assert that the “percentage of total recovery” proxy for assessing\nattorney fees was “an unreasonable and arbitrary method for deducting fees for work\nrelating to Platinum.” We agree that the court abused its discretion in utilizing the\npercentage of total recovery as a proxy for the amount of attorney fees to be apportioned\nfor Platinum’s claims. The court’s reliance on the percentage of recovery attributable to\nPlatinum’s claims is particularly arbitrary, as under this theory, a defense attorney could\neffectively cause their client to pay more in attorneys’ fees by successfully defeating\ncauses of action that are separate and not intertwined with Unruh causes of action. This\nmethod of apportionment could effectively penalize Defendants for their successes in\nlitigating Platinum’s causes of action. The unreasonableness of the court’s\napportionment methodology becomes even more evident on appeal, when the percentage\nof recovery is subject to alteration: Plaintiffs’ attorney fees award could fluctuate based\non Defendants’ success on appeal in obtaining reversal of damages awards. To prevent\n\n\n                                              38\n\fduplicative recovery, we reversed the intentional infliction of emotional distress punitive\ndamages award in this opinion. This ruling reduces Plaintiffs’ total recovery by 24.5%.\nIf we were to affirm this methodology, the trial court would have to recalculate\napportionment of fees associated with Platinum based on the new total damages figure.\nThis would effectively reduce Plaintiffs’ attorney fees for entirely arbitrary reasons, as\nthe evidence supporting the fees award has not changed. There has been no new showing\nthat Plaintiffs’ counsel worked any less on Unruh claims or any more on Platinum’s\ncontract based causes of action.\n       We thus conclude that this method of apportionment for Platinum’s claims\nresulted in a miscarriage of justice.5 We remand for the court to reapportion fees\nassociated with Platinum’s claims. On remand, the court must determine whether billing\nentries can be attributed solely to Platinum’s claim. The time stated in such billing\nentries attributable solely or mostly to Platinum’s claims must reduce the total time used\nto calculate the lodestar amount. In addition, the court “must examine the nature and\n‘course of conduct’ upon which the claims are based.” (Harman v. City and County of\n\n5\n        To the extent that Defendants assert that the “percentage of total recovery” method\nof assessing fees should be applied to measure the fees incurred in pursuing punitive\ndamages, this is no longer a viable argument. We have reversed the award of punitive\ndamages to the individual Plaintiffs for intentional infliction of emotional distress, and\nthose damages no longer compose any part of the total recovery. In addition, the\n“percentage of total recovery” method of assessing fees is unreasonable for the reasons\nstated above. Furthermore, Defendants misconstrue the principles of apportionment by\nattempting to apply that method in this context. Prior to trial and during the first phase of\ntrial, which dealt with actual damages resulting from the discrimination, the emotional\ndistress claims and the Unruh claims were inextricably intertwined. Under both claims,\nPlaintiffs sought to prove that Defendants discriminated against them by refusing to\nprovide them services at the hotel because they were Jewish. The attorneys’ work\n(occurring pretrial and during the first phase of trial) that went into proving the actual\ndamages associated with the Unruh violation was also attributable to proving actual\ndamages for emotional distress. Only in the second phase of trial, which dealt entirely\nwith punitive damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress, could the court\nextricate the attorney fees associated with intentional infliction of emotional distress from\nthose associated with Unruh claims. The court’s apportionment was thus proper, as this\nphase of trial was unassociated with Unruh.\n\n\n                                             39\n\fSan Francisco (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 407, 423.) The court is to determine whether\nPlatinum’s causes of action are inextricably intertwined with the Unruh cause of action\nby reasoning whether claims involve a common core of facts or are based on related legal\ntheories. (Taylor v. Nabors Drilling USA, LP (2014) 222 Cal.App.4th 1228, 1251.) If\nthe issues in Platinum’s claims and the Unruh claims are so inextricably intertwined that\nit would be impractical or impossible to separate the hours billed into compensable and\nnoncompensable units, then the court need not attempt to apportion the hours and may\naward fees for all of the hours. (See Ibid.) If the claims are not inextricably intertwined,\nthe court must exercise its discretion to assign a reasonable percentage of the block\nbilling to fees associated with Platinum’s claims by relying on the billing evidence\nprovided by Plaintiffs and the court’s own assessment of the work expended by\nPlaintiffs’ counsel on the different claims based on its pretrial and trial experience\nworking with the parties.\n       In conclusion, we remand the attorney fees award to the trial court to determine\nthe appropriate amount of attorney fees by applying a reasonable method to apportion\nfees associated with Platinum’s claims. We affirm the court with regard to all other\nissues raised by Defendants as to attorney fees award.\n       7.     Defendants’ Remaining Issues on Appeal Are Moot\n       The remaining issues raised by Defendants are related to the causes of action for\nintentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, and negligence. Specifically,\nDefendants argue that: Plaintiffs failed to prove unlawful intent to support a claim for\nintentional infliction of emotional distress, Defendants owed no duty to Plaintiffs\nsufficient to support a claim for negligence or negligent infliction of emotional distress,\nand the jury provided inconsistent and irreconcilable verdicts by rendering verdicts in\nfavor of eleven Plaintiffs for both negligent and intentional infliction of emotional\ndistress.\n\n\n\n\n                                             40\n\f       We decline to address these arguments because “ ‘[w]here the verdict of the jury\nand the judgment based thereon may be sustained on any reasonable theory, it will not be\ndisturbed by an appellate court.’ [Citation.].” (Nelson v. Painless Parker (1930)\n104 Cal.App. 770, 774; see Cahill v. San Diego Gas & Electric Co. (2011) 194\nCal.App.4th 939, 956 [“[I]f a judgment is correct on any theory, the appellate court will\naffirm it regardless of the trial court’s reasoning. [Citations.] All intendments and\npresumptions are made to support the judgment on matters as to which the record is\nsilent.”].) Here, the verdict for actual damages and statutory penalties is affirmable under\nthe Unruh cause of action, which the jury decided in favor of each of the individual\nPlaintiffs. Because we reverse the award of punitive damages, we need not address the\nintentional infliction of emotional distress claim.\n       In sum, to the extent we affirm the jury’s verdict, we do so by relying on\nPlaintiffs’ Unruh violation theory of recovery. We decline to address Plaintiffs’\narguments regarding negligence, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and\nintentional infliction of emotional distress claims as they are not decisive to any aspect of\nour holding.\n\n\n\n\n                                             41\n\f                                     DISPOSITION\n       The punitive damages award is reversed. The attorneys fees award is reversed\nwith respect to the amount of fees awarded, and remanded for determination of fees\nconsistent with this opinion. The judgment is affirmed in all other respects.

The litigation arises out of\nDefendants’ refusal to provide services at a hotel event to the individual Plaintiffs\nbecause they were Jewish. Plaintiff Platinum, an event promoting company, also sued\nDefendants for contract and tort causes of action related to the event. Defendants assert\nmany grounds on appeal regarding sufficiency of the evidence, improper evidentiary\nrulings, standing, inconsistent verdicts, duplicative recovery, jury instruction errors, and\nimproper apportionment of attorney fees awards. We affirm the jury’s verdict awarding\nactual damages and statutory penalties under Unruh as it is supported by substantial\nevidence and any evidentiary concerns raised by Defendants were harmless error. We\nreverse the duplicative award of punitive damages stemming from intentional infliction\nof emotion distress. We reverse and remand the court’s award of attorney fees to the\nextent that it abused its discretion in unreasonably apportioning attorney fees associated\nwith Plaintiff Platinum’s causes of action.\n                   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND1\n       Defendant Adaya is an owner and operator of Defendant Shangri-La Hotel in\nSanta Monica, California. Plaintiff Platinum, an event promoter, had previously worked\nwith Shangri-La to orchestrate events and parties at the hotel. In June 2010, Platinum\nbegan arranging Sunday pool parties at Shangri-La. Platinum set up the July 2010 pool\nparty at issue in this case for the Young Leadership Group of the Friends of the Israeli\nDefense Forces (FIDF) to fundraise for children of fallen Israeli soldiers to attend camp\nin the United States.\n\n\n1\n       Consistent with the substantial evidence standard of review, we recite the relevant\nfacts established by the record in the light most favorable to the judgment, giving\nPlaintiffs the benefit of every reasonable inference and resolving any conflict in the\nevidence in support of the judgment.

Paletz met with\nShangri-La’s general manager and its food and beverage director, Nathan Codrey, to\nfinalize arrangements for the pool party several times thereafter.\n       On the morning of the pool party, Shangri-La provided to FIDF a check-in table\nand towels, and cordoned off an area of the pool with stanchions and ropes for FIDF’s\npool party guests. FIDF placed brochures, literature, and t-shirts on the tables, and\ndisplayed two 6-foot banners. FIDF checked guests in, giving them blue bracelets and\nFIDF t-shirts.\n       During the beginning of the pool party, Adaya was watching the World Cup in her\npoolside cabana. When she exited her cabana, she saw FIDF’s guests in and around the\npool, the banners and tables with literature, and the FIDF t-shirts on display. She\nsummoned one of her security personnel to obtain a pamphlet for her review. The\nsecurity guard walked over to the table, requested a pamphlet, and told the FIDF member\nat the check-in table that Shangri-La’s owner wanted to know what the group was about.\nThe pamphlet described FIDF and the program for which the pool party was fundraising.\nThe security guard brought it to Adaya, who then became noticeably agitated and passed\nthe pamphlet to others sitting with her.\n       Adaya then contacted Codrey, the food and beverage director who had worked\nwith Platinum to set up the pool party. When Codrey arrived at the hotel, Adaya told him\n“I don’t want any [f---ing] Jews in the pool.” Although Adaya did not make this\nstatement directly to Plaintiffs, Codrey told Paletz and possibly others that Adaya made\nthis statement. Codrey conveyed to some of the Plaintiffs that Adaya wanted the event\nshut down because they were Jewish. Adaya further told Codrey that “[i]f my parents\nfind out that there is a Jewish event here, they’re going to pull money from me\nimmediately.”\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\f       Per Adaya’s instruction, Shangri-La staff systematically shut down FIDF’s pool\nparty. Hotel staff singled out FIDF guests, identifiable by their blue wristbands, and\nremoved them from the pool, while other hotel guests and non-guests were allowed to\nstay in the pool. Shangri-La staff required FIDF members to remove their banners. The\nstaff locked the entrance gate to the pool to prevent FIDF attendees from entering or\nreentering the pool area. Pool staff removed the towels provided for FIDF’s event and\nhad FIDF remove the t-shirts from the tables. Shangri-La security removed the ropes and\nstanchions that delineated FIDF’s private area at the pool. Staff also ordered all event\nattendees to remove their FIDF event t-shirts. Those FIDF event attendees who remained\nat the pool after the event was dismantled, were permitted to stay in the pool area.\nDuring this series of events, Adaya and her husband sat in a cabana next to the pool area\nand stared down the FIDF members for at least an hour to an hour and a half, generating\na lot of tension between the parties.\n       The Plaintiffs became aware of Adaya’s discriminatory intent either by hearing\nher statements from Codrey or other attendees, witnessing her behavior, or directly\nhearing Adaya make comments regarding FIDF’s removal from the pool. For instance,\none Plaintiff saw Adaya become very agitated and heard her raise her voice, instructing\nthe security guard to “get them out, get them out, get them out.” While in the restroom, a\ndifferent Plaintiff overheard Adaya ask a non-Jewish woman, “[d]o you want me to get\nthese people off the lounge chairs?” Codrey, a hotel employee, repeatedly apologized for\nAdaya’s actions, once calling it “blatant anti-Semitism.”\n       Plaintiffs Paletz, Stephen C. Fowler (an independent contractor of Platinum), and\nsixteen individuals, who were FIDF guests at the pool party, sued Defendants Adaya and\nShangri-La for (1) discrimination under Unruh Civil Rights Act, Civil Code section2 51,\n(2) intentional infliction of emotional distress, (3) negligent infliction of emotional\ndistress, and (4) negligence. Plaintiff Platinum sued Shangri-La for breach of contract\n\n\n2\n      All subsequent statutory references are to the Civil Code, unless indicated\notherwise.\n\n\n                                              4\n\fand related causes of action. At trial, the court admitted Codrey’s deposition testimony\nregarding Adaya’s statements made to him at the pool. Plaintiffs also testified at trial to\nthe statements Codrey made to them at the pool, conveying the derogatory remarks made\nby Adaya. Some Plaintiffs testified to hearing Adaya’s derogatory statements third or\nfourth hand from other FIDF guests at the pool. Over Defendants’ objections, the court\nadditionally admitted expert testimony from a Rabbi, which characterized Adaya’s\nbehavior as anti-Semitic and discussed the Plaintiffs’ reaction to the events that occurred\nat Shangri-La. The court permitted evidence that Adaya was Pakistani and Muslim,\nagain over Defendants’ objections. After a 10-day trial followed by six days of jury\ndeliberation, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Plaintiffs.\n       The jury found that Defendants had discriminated against each individual Plaintiff\nin violation of Unruh. The jury found that Defendants had been negligent and committed\nnegligent infliction of emotional distress toward various Plaintiffs. The jury also found\nthat Defendants had intentionally inflicted emotional distress on 11 Plaintiffs. Each\nindividual Plaintiff was awarded compensatory damages and Unruh statutory penalties\nagainst Defendants; these combined awards ranged from $26,000 to $180,000 for each\nPlaintiff. In a separate, second phase of the trial, the jury also awarded $405,000 in\npunitive damages to the 11 individual Plaintiffs that it determined to be victims of\nintentional infliction of emotional distress. The punitive damage awards ranged from\n$25,000 to $80,000 for each of the 11 individuals. Adaya and Shangri-La were each 50\npercent responsible for damages.\n       The jury further determined that Shangri-La had breached its oral agreement with\nPlatinum, breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, made negligent\nmisrepresentations, and negligently and intentionally interfered with a prospective\neconomic advantage. The jury awarded Platinum $11,250 in damages and $40,000 in\npunitive damages for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.\n\n\n\n\n                                               5\n\f       Collectively, Plaintiffs were awarded $1,654,250. The court additionally awarded\nthe individual Plaintiffs $2,099,785.50 in attorney fees on Unruh Act claims, along with\ncosts amounting to $40,911.47. Notably, the same law firm represented all Plaintiffs.\nDefendants filed motions for a new trial and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict;\nboth were denied.\n                                       DISCUSSION\n       Defendants raise many issues on appeal, arguing that: (1) there is insufficient\nevidence to support a finding of unlawful intent for the intentional infliction of emotional\ndistress and Unruh Act claims; (2) the court abused its discretion on evidentiary rulings\nrelated to hearsay, expert testimony, and character evidence, warranting reversal; (3) one\nPlaintiff lacked standing to assert an Unruh claim; (4) Defendants owed no duty to\nPlaintiffs sufficient to support a claim for negligence or negligent infliction of emotional\ndistress; (5) the jury provided inconsistent and irreconcilable verdicts by rendering\nverdicts in favor of eleven Plaintiffs for both negligent and intentional infliction of\nemotional distress; (6) the punitive damages award was improper; (7) there was an\ninstructional error in calculating statutory penalties that requires a new trial; and (8) the\nattorney fees award was improperly apportioned and calculated.\n       1.     Substantial Evidence Supports Unlawful Intent for Unruh Claim\n       Defendants assert that Plaintiffs’ Unruh claims must fail because they did not\nestablish the requisite intent for Unruh. “When findings of fact are challenged in a civil\nappeal, we are bound by the familiar principle that ‘the power of the appellate court\nbegins and ends with a determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence,\ncontradicted or uncontradicted,’ to support the findings below.” (Oregel v.

Substantial evidence supports the jury’s finding here that\nDefendants intentionally discriminated against Defendants. Multiple people testified to\nAdaya’s negative reaction to finding out that Shangri-La was hosting a Jewish event and\nthat she shortly thereafter shut down FIDF’s pool party. Testimony also establishes that\nAdaya made anti-Semitic remarks about the FIDF members in her pool, indicating to\nstaff that she wanted them removed because they were Jewish.\n       For instance, Plaintiff Nicholas Morrison testified to Adaya’s negative reaction to\nthe pamphlet, which preceded her systematic shutdown of the pool party. At the time of\nthe pool party, Morrison was the vice president of programming on the executive board\nof FIDF, who helped plan the event at Shangri-La’s pool. Morrison testified that he was\nworking at the check-in table during the FIDF event, where he distributed wristbands and\nFIDF t-shirts to attendees. Morrison stated that a hotel security guard approached him at\nthe check-in table and asked him for one of the FIDF pamphlets. The security guard\nidentified himself as a hotel employee and told Morrison, “[t]he owner is interested in\nwho you are and . . . what your organization is.” Morrison watched the security guard\nwalk over to Adaya and give her the pamphlet. Morrison testified that Adaya’s reaction\nto reading the pamphlet was “not positive.” Describing her reaction, Morrison testified:\n“[i]t was very agitated. Arms flailing and handing it to the people that she was sitting\nwith. And you could see her gesturing towards it as they were reading it. It wasn’t a\n‘how wonderful, this is fantastic.’ There was a distinct reaction that was negative.”\nShortly thereafter, Adaya shut down FIDF’s event.\n\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\f       Shangri-La’s former employee Nathan Codrey’s deposition testimony was also\nadmitted at trial, and directly established that Adaya made anti-Semitic remarks, which\nillustrated her discriminatory motivation for shutting down their event. Codrey testified\nthat Adaya told him, “I don’t want any [f---ing] Jews in the pool.” Codrey further stated\nthat Adaya said, “[i]f my parents find out that there is a Jewish event here, they’re going\nto pull money from me immediately.” Codrey described Adaya as visibly upset and\ntestified that Adaya said that she wanted the group out immediately. Codrey stated that\nAdaya yelled at him: “I can’t have this [f---ing] event. This is ridiculous. I can’t believe\nthat this was approved. Who approved this? Who knew about this? My family or my\nparents will pull money from me.”\n       Codrey also testified that Adaya’s husband soon thereafter showed up, visibly\nupset. Codrey stated that “[h]e made matters a lot worse because [both Adaya and her\nhusband] sat in the front -- in the far corner cabana located next to the jacuzzi and started\nto -- and stared at the [FIDF guests]. Just stared them down. . . . You could cut the\ntension with a knife there. It was very chaotic and -- and then at times very, very quiet.”\nHe testified that the staring lasted for at least an hour to an hour and a half.\n       Codrey additionally explained how Adaya systematically shut down FIDF’s pool\nparty. Codrey testified that, Adaya first stated that no literature was to be passed out.\nShe then told Codrey to tell FIDF to take their shirts off, which said FIDF. Third, she\nmandated that they were not allowed in the pool. His testimony clearly established that\nDefendants’ conduct in depriving Plaintiffs of services was intentional and motivated by\ndiscrimination.\n       To the extent that Defendants assert that their denial of hotel services to Plaintiffs\nwas based on Shangri-La’s “valid policies and practices” and not discrimination, we\nreiterate that we view the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the prevailing\nparty. Moreover, Defendants’ assertion that Plaintiffs were denied services because they\nviolated hotel policies mischaracterizes the evidence. There was evidence that a previous\npool party at Shangri-La, which occurred only a month prior to the FIDF event, was not\nconstrained by these “policies.” Furthermore, the policies at issue never existed in\n\n\n                                               8\n\fwriting, and appeared to be applied at the whims of Adaya, who testified that pool access\nwas determined on a “day-to-day basis” by “whoever is managing that particular day.”\n       We conclude that the testimony quoted and summarized above describing Adaya’s\npoolside conduct and speech clearly establishes that Defendants intentionally deprived\nPlaintiffs of the hotel services because they were Jewish. Substantial evidence supports\nthe jury finding of intentional discrimination. We therefore affirm the jury’s intent\nfindings as to Unruh.\n       2.     Evidentiary Issues Raised by Defendants Do Not Warrant Reversal\n       We review the trial court’s rulings admitting evidence for abuse of discretion.\n(Nevarrez v. San Marino Skilled Nursing &Wellness Centre (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Amcord, Inc. (2013)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">659</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 678.) “In addition, evidentiary rulings which are based on a\nmisunderstanding of the law are an abuse of discretion.” (Ibid.) To the extent the court\ndid not provide a rationale for its evidentiary decisions, “[a] ruling on the admissibility of\nevidence implies whatever finding of fact is prerequisite thereto.” (Evid. Code § 402,\nsubd. (c).)\n       a.     The Court Did Not Err in Admitting Out of Court Statements Made by\nAdaya to Codrey\n       Defendants assert that the court abused its discretion in allowing each of the\nPlaintiffs to provide hearsay testimony regarding statements made by Adaya to Codrey.\nDefendants identify two kinds of hearsay testimony: (1) Plaintiffs’ testimony about\nAdaya’s statements to Codrey that they heard directly from Codrey and (2) Plaintiffs’\ntestimony about Adaya’s statements to Codrey that they heard third or fourth hand from\nother members of FIDF.\n\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\f       i.     Defendants Waived Hearsay Objections to Plaintiffs’ Testimony Regarding\nHearing Adaya’s Statements From Other FIDF Members\n       We begin by addressing Plaintiffs’ arguments that Defendants waived their\nhearsay arguments in failing to object to hearsay at trial. Although it appears that\nDefendants properly objected to the first type of testimony regarding statements heard\ndirectly from Codrey, Defendants failed to object to the latter type of testimony, where\nPlaintiffs stated they heard Adaya’s statement third or fourth hand from other FIDF\nguests. Prior to trial, Defendants brought a motion in limine requesting the court to\nexclude potential hearsay statements regarding profane and anti-Semitic statements made\nby Adaya. In their motion, Defendants asserted that: “[t]he individual Plaintiffs have\nclaimed damages from what Defendant [Adaya] is alleged to have said, yet none of the\nPlaintiffs actually heard Ms. Adaya say anything profane or anti-Semitic at the event. All\nof the claims in that regard are rooted in inadmissible hearsay, and there are no\nexceptions to the Hearsay Rule that would allow introduction of the alleged comments\nadmittedly not heard by any of the Plaintiffs in this case.” The court denied the motion\nwithout prejudice, explaining that the motion “raise[d] evidentiary issues that can only be\naddressed at trial.”\n       To preserve an objection for appeal via a motion in limine, the objection must be\n“specific, . . . directed to an identifiable body of evidence, and . . . advanced at a time\nwhen the trial judge could give fair consideration to the admissibility of the evidence in\nits context.” (People v. Morris (1991) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">152</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 189 disapproved on other grounds\nin People v.

In Defendants’ hearsay motion\nin limine, Defendants failed to identify Adaya’s specific statements that were at issue, nor\ndid they identify the testimony they expected each Plaintiff to provide at trial that they\nsought to exclude. Not only was the objection too general, but it was advanced too early,\nat an interval where the court could not assess the evidence in the appropriate context.\nThe court made it clear that the hearsay objections could only be assessed at trial when\nthe particular out of court statements at issue were evident. Thus, the motion in limine\ndid not preserve any of Defendants’ hearsay objections.\n\n\n                                              10\n\f       At trial, Defendants made a single hearsay objection when Plaintiffs’ counsel\nelicited testimony about statements Plaintiff Ari Ryan heard directly from Codrey. When\nPlaintiffs’ counsel asked Ryan what Codrey told him about Adaya’s statements, defense\ncounsel objected on hearsay grounds. The court overruled the objection and Ryan\ntestified to what Codrey had told him. This objection suffices to preserve Defendants’\nadmissibility arguments regarding the first kind of hearsay identified by Defendant:\nPlaintiffs testifying to what Codrey directly told them Adaya said. (See People v. Antick\n(1975) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1142967\"><a href=\"/opinion/1142967/people-v-antick/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 95 [a party need not make a continuing objection to a particular line\nof evidence once the party’s initial objection to that line of evidence has been overruled],\ndisapproved on other grounds by People v.

([Evid. Code,] § 353; In re C.B. (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">190</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">717</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 726.)\n       Here, Defendants failed to object to Plaintiffs’ testimony providing third-or-\nfourth-hand accounts of Adaya’s statements. Importantly, the trial court would have\nengaged in a different analysis to address this hearsay objection, as additional layers of\nout-of-court statements were at issue. Defendants never presented Plaintiffs with an\nopportunity to provide a valid basis for its admission and never gave the court an\nopportunity to contemplate and rule on the issue. Because Defendants did not object,\nthey forfeited their claim that the court erred by admitting this second type of hearsay\nevidence. We thus only address the admissibility of Plaintiffs’ testimony regarding out of\ncourt statements heard directly from Codrey.\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\f       ii.     Plaintiffs’ Testimony About Adaya’s Statement As Heard Directly from\nCodrey Was Not Hearsay\n       Defendants contend that the court abused its discretion by admitting Plaintiffs’\ntestimony about how they heard from Codrey that Adaya did not want them in the pool\nbecause they were Jewish. Adaya’s underlying statement at issue is: “I don’t want any\n[f---ing] Jews in the pool.” Defendants concede that the communication from Adaya to\nCodrey was not inadmissible hearsay. Defendants assert that “[t]he abuse of discretion\narose once the testimony got beyond this alleged direct communication between Mr.\nCodrey and Ms. Adaya, and went to Plaintiffs, who were allowed to testify . . . that\n. . . [they] heard Ms. Adaya’s comments second-hand from Mr. Codrey.” Defendants\nargue that “[n]o exceptions applied to these final layers of hearsay from Mr. Codrey to\nPlaintiffs.”\n       Hearsay is an out-of-court statement that is offered for the truth of the matter\nasserted, and is generally inadmissible. (Evid. Code, § 1200, subd. (a).) Conversely, an\nout-of-court statement is not hearsay when it is offered for other purposes. For example,\n“[a]n out-of-court statement is not hearsay if offered to show the effect on the hearer,\nreader or viewer rather than to prove the truth of the content of the statement—e.g., that a\nparty had prior notice or knowledge; that a party was given a warning; or to prove a\nparty’s motive, good faith, fear, etc. (where such notice, knowledge, motive, fear, etc. is\nrelevant to an issue in the case).” (Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Trials and Evidence (The\nRutter Group 2013) ¶ 8:1049, italic omitted.) An extrajudicial statement is not hearsay if\nused “ ‘to prove . . . the . . . hearer . . . obtained certain information by hearing . . . the\nstatement and, believing such information to be true, acted in conformity with such\nbelief.’ [Citation.] . . . ‘The statement is not hearsay, since it is the hearer’s reaction to\nthe statement that is the relevant fact sought to be proved–not the truth of the matter\nasserted in the statement.’ ” (Holland v. Union Pacific Railroad Co. (2007)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">154</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Evidence Benchbook (2d ed. 1982)\nHearsay & Nonhearsay, § 1.4, p. 57, italics omitted.) “However, ‘[a] hearsay objection to\nan out-of-court statement may not be overruled simply by identifying a nonhearsay\n\n\n                                                12\n\fpurpose for admitting the statement. The trial court must also find that the nonhearsay\npurpose is relevant to an issue in dispute.’ [Citation.]” (People v. Jablonski (2006)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2594806\"><a href=\"/opinion/2594806/people-v-jablonski/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">774</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.)\n       Here, the specific statement at issue is Codrey telling Plaintiffs that Adaya said she\ndid not want Jewish people in her pool. The truth of the matter asserted in the statement\nis that Adaya made the anti-Semitic statement. We reason, and Defendants appear to\nagree, that Plaintiffs’ testimony was not being offered to prove that Adaya actually made\nthe statement. In their appellate brief, Defendants assert that “the comments were being\noffered to prove that Mr. Codrey in fact related these statements to others, which caused\nthem distress.” We agree. The purpose of Plaintiffs testifying to what they heard from\nCodrey was to show the effect of Codrey’s statement on the listener: to show that\nPlaintiffs understood that they were being removed from the pool due to their religion,\nwhich gave them cause for emotional distress. This nonhearsay purpose for admitting the\ntestimony is highly relevant to proving general damages for emotional distress and\nmental anguish in Plaintiffs’ tort and Unruh causes of action.\n       It is well established in California that out-of-court statements, when offered to\nshow the effect on the hearer, are admissible nonhearsay, as long as they are relevant.\n(See Cantrell v.

Consistent with these cases,\nPlaintiffs’ testimony regarding Codrey’s statements were offered to show their effect on\nPlaintiffs and support damages for emotional distress.\n       Furthermore, even if admission of this evidence could be construed as error, it was\nharmless.

It is not reasonably\nprobable that a result more favorable to Defendants would have been reached if\nPlaintiffs’ testimony regarding statements from Codrey was excluded, as the jury was\nalready well aware of Adaya’s discriminatory comments.

As to the character evidence, Defendants assert that\nevidence of Adaya’s religion and nationality were inflammatory, evoked an emotional\nreaction with the jury, and lacked any probative value. In addition to other references\nregarding Adaya’s religion and nationality, the portion of Codrey’s deposition provided\nto the jury also stated that during the pool party conflict, Adaya “kept repeating that . . .\nthis was embarrassing to her; that she is a Muslim, her parents or family are Muslims, and\nthis is just absolutely wrong.”\n       Assuming without deciding that the admission of Rabbi Wolpe’s expert testimony\nand testimony regarding Adaya’s Pakistani Muslim background was error, we conclude\nthat it was not prejudicial and does not require reversal. “A judgment will not be set\naside based on the erroneous admission of evidence unless ‘the reviewing court is\nconvinced after an examination of the entire case, including the evidence, that it is\nreasonably probable a result more favorable to the appellant would have been reached\nabsent the error.

Testimony from the 18 individual Plaintiffs all described Adaya’s behavior\nand how they were systematically denied hotel services based on their religion. As\nprovided in the first section of the Discussion, testimony from Plaintiff Nicholas\nMorrison established that Adaya had a very negative reaction when she learned that\nShangri-La was hosting a pool party for a Jewish organization. Quickly thereafter,\nAdaya dismantled the event. Furthermore, the court admitted Codrey’s testimony that\nAdaya stated: “I don’t want any [f---ing] Jews in the pool.” Codrey’s testimony also\nstated that Adaya said, “[i]f my parents find out that there is a Jewish event here, they’re\ngoing to pull money from me immediately.” This evidence alone was highly probative of\nPlaintiffs’ causes of action such that it was not reasonably probable a result more\n\n\n                                             16\n\ffavorable to the appellant would have been reached had the court excluded expert\ntestimony from Rabbi Wolpe and evidence of Adaya’s Pakistani Muslim background.\n       In light of the extensive evidence and particularly probative testimony regarding\nAdaya’s anti-Semitic statements and actions presented by Plaintiffs, we conclude that any\nerror with regard to these evidentiary rulings was harmless.\n       3.     Plaintiff Nussdorf Had Standing to Bring an Unruh Act Claim\n       Defendants assert that Plaintiff Adrianna Nussdorf lacked standing to bring claims\nunder the Unruh Act because she does not qualify as a “person aggrieved” under the\nstatute. (See § 52, subd. (c) [“any person aggrieved by the conduct [of persons violating\nUnruh] may bring a civil action in the appropriate court by filing with it a complaint”].)\nDefendants base their argument on Nussdorf’s testimony that her initial reaction to the\nevents at the pool party was that she thought it was ridiculous to speculate that FIDF\nmembers were being discriminated against and that the group was blaming the hotel for a\npoorly organized event.\n       This argument mischaracterizes Nussdorf’s testimony.

Nussdorf further testified that after she understood what happened, the\nevents made her feel terrible and had such an impact on her that she visited two doctors\nand began taking medication for sleeplessness and anxiety We conclude that this is\nsufficient evidence to show that she was a “person aggrieved” under Unruh.\n       4.     Punitive Damages Must be Reversed as Plaintiffs Received Statutory\nPenalties Under Section 52, Subdivision (a) that Were Punitive in Nature\n       Defendants assert that the “trial court erroneously permitted 11 Plaintiffs to collect\ndouble punishment for the same alleged conduct—first in the form of statutory Unruh\nAct ‘penalties’ and second in the form of ‘punitive damages’ in connection with their\n[intentional infliction of emotional distress] claims.” The court here awarded statutory\npenalties under section 52, which provides that, “[w]hoever denies, aids or incites a\ndenial, or makes any discrimination or distinction contrary to Section 51 . . . is liable for\n\n\n                                              17\n\feach and every offense for the actual damages, and any amount that may be determined\nby a jury, or a court sitting without a jury, up to a maximum of three times the amount of\nactual damage but in no case less than four thousand dollars ($4,000) . . . .” (Emphasis\nadded.) Defendants contend that statutory damages under Unruh, which allow a jury to\naward up to three times the amount of actual damage, are punitive, not compensatory.\nDefendants assert that because the statutory damages are punitive, Plaintiffs may not\nseparately collect punitive damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress to\npunish Defendants for essentially the same conduct. We review this question of law and\nissue of statutory interpretation de novo. (Babalola v.

In Harris, supra, 52 Cal.3d at\np. 1172, the Supreme Court explained that section 52, subdivision (a)’s “damages\nprovision allowing for an exemplary award of up to treble the actual damages suffered\nwith a stated minimum amount reveals a desire to punish intentional and morally\n\n\n                                             18\n\foffensive conduct.” The Court expressly called the treble damages provision “a punitive\naward.” (Id. at p. 1152, fn. 5; Botosan v.

As Unruh’s statutory damages are punitive, we must determine whether (a)\nthe legislature intended for a double recovery of punitive damages under Unruh, and (b)\nif not, whether the punitive damages at issue were based on the same conduct.\n       (a) The Legislature Did Not Intend to Allow Double Recovery\n       We begin with the presumption that absent a specific indication otherwise, the\nlegislature did not intend to allow for double recovery of punitive damages under section\n52, which sets forth the damages that can be recovered for Unruh violations. (See\nFassberg, supra, 152 Cal.App.4th at p. 760.) To rebut this presumption, Plaintiffs argued\nat oral argument that the language of section 52, subdivision (e) indicated that Unruh’s\ndamages were cumulative in nature. Section 52, subdivision (e) states that “[a]ctions\nbrought pursuant to this section are independent of any other actions, remedies, or\nprocedures that may be available to an aggrieved party pursuant to any other law.”\n       In interpreting the meaning of subdivision (e), we apply the canons of statutory\nconstruction. “Under settled canons of statutory construction, in construing a statute we\nascertain the Legislature’s intent in order to effectuate the law’s purpose.” (Imperial\nMerchant Services, Inc. v. Hunt (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">381</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 387.) We do this by first looking\nto the plain meaning of the statute’s language; the usual and ordinary meaning of the\nwords is controlling unless the words are ambiguous. (Id. at p. 387-388.) We also “give\neffect, whenever possible, to the statute as a whole, and to every word and clause thereof,\nleaving no part of the provision useless or deprived of meaning.” (Eisenhower Medical\nCenter v. Superior Court (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 435.) In doing so, we do not “add\nor subtract words to or from the statute.” (Scottsdale Indemnity Co. v. National\nContinental Ins. Co. (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1166</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1172.) “ ‘If the statutory language\npermits more than one reasonable interpretation, courts may consider other aids, such as\nthe statute’s purpose, legislative history, and public policy.’ [Citation.]” (Imperial\nMerchant Services, Inc. v. Hunt, supra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 388.)\n\n\n                                             19\n\f       Here, subdivision (e) states that “[a]ctions” are independent of “other actions,\nremedies, or procedures” that a plaintiff can pursue. Applying the usual and ordinary\nmeaning of these words, it is clear that subdivision (e) permits a plaintiff to bring an\nUnruh cause of action while bringing other causes of action or seeking other remedies.\nNotably, subdivision (e) does not state that remedies under Unruh are independent of\nother remedies a plaintiff may seek. Plaintiffs’ proposed construction requires us to read\nadditional words into subdivision (e) in order to reach the conclusion that Unruh’s\nremedies are independent of other remedies. As stated above, the canons of statutory\nconstruction prohibit us from adding words to the statutory language in interpreting the\nstatute. Our interpretation of subdivision (e) is also supported by legislative history,\nwhich indicates that subdivision (e) was added to in order to create a private right of\naction for aggrieved persons, in addition to their preexisting, previously exclusive remedy\nof filing a complaint with the Fair Employment Practices Commission. (Assem. Com. on\nLabor Relations, Analysis of Assem. Bill 2986 (1975-1976 Reg. Sess.) Apr. 20, 1976\nReport; Assem. Com. On Ways & Means, Staff Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 2986 (1975-\n1976 Reg. Sess.) as amended April 26, 1976.)\n       We therefore conclude that section 52 does not permit duplicative recovery of\npunitive damages for the same conduct. Had the legislature intended for plaintiffs to be\nable to have an Unruh remedy independent of other remedies, it would have explicitly\nsaid so. (See Troensegaard v. Silvercrest Industries, Inc.

Thus, the\nremaining issue is whether the statutory Unruh damages and the intentional infliction of\nemotional distress damages were based on the same conduct.\n\n\n\n\n                                             20\n\f       (b) Defendants Have Violated a Single Primary Right, Giving Rise to a Single\nCause of Action for Punitive Damages\n       The Supreme Court has explained that “a ‘cause of action’ is comprised of a\n‘primary right’ of the plaintiff, a corresponding ‘primary duty’ of the defendant, and a\nwrongful act by the defendant constituting a breach of that duty.

This is supported by Plaintiffs’ testimony, which\nidentifies a course of conduct systematically depriving Plaintiffs of hotel amenities and\nservices that was motivated by discrimination. For instance, Plaintiff Laura Lugash\nsummarizes the events at the pool that led her to believe the conduct was antisemitic as,\n“being stopped before entering the pool, being told to get out of the pool, and watching\n[Adaya] gesturing and being angry.” Her summary describes the heart of this lawsuit:\ndeprivation of pool amenities due to discrimination. Although each Plaintiff had a\ndifferent experience at the pool and different reactions to Defendants’ behavior, all\n\n\n                                               21\n\fsuffered the same primary right violation of being deprived of pool amenities due to\nDefendants’ anti-Semitism. Plaintiffs’ intentional infliction of emotional distress and\nUnruh causes of action are simply two different legal theories for recovering punitive\ndamages for that same injury.\n       Plaintiffs argue that they did not receive “an award of statutory penalties and\npunitive damages based on the same conduct,” asserting that “the jury based its findings\non separate acts of misconduct.” Plaintiffs support this argument by citing the trial\ncourt’s decision denying Defendants’ motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on\nthis issue. There, the court stated that the jury’s “careful distinctions are apparent in the\ndamages awards in [that] the jury’s verdict as to each of the plaintiffs strongly suggests\nthat the jury was making such distinctions on different acts and impacts suffered by each\nplaintiff.”\n       Based on our review of the record, we conclude that it is unreasonable to assume\nthat the jury’s findings were based on separate acts of misconduct because Defendants’\nconduct was not easily divisible. Although Plaintiffs generally state that there was a wide\narray of different acts carried out over many hours, Plaintiffs fail to indentify for this\nCourt the different acts that were specifically attributable to the Unruh violation and the\nintentional infliction of emotional distress for each of the nine Plaintiffs who received\nstatutory and punitive damages. Nor do Plaintiffs identify multiple primary rights that\nhave been violated. As explained above, based on our review of the record, Plaintiffs\nsuffered injury from the violation of a single primary right as Defendants’ conduct\nconsisted of depriving Plaintiffs of Shangri-La’s pool amenities based on a\ndiscriminatory motive. Additionally, the distinctions in the damages awards are most\nnoticeable when comparing awards received by different Plaintiffs, and appear to be the\nproduct of each Plaintiff’s testimony regarding the varying impacts Defendants’ conduct\nhad on them individually.\n\n\n\n\n                                              22\n\f       Plaintiffs also argue that any ambiguity that exists in the jury verdicts was invited\nby Defendants and as such, it is not a basis for reversal of the punitive damages award.\n“Under the doctrine of ‘invited error’ a party cannot successfully take advantage of error\ncommitted by the court at his request. Thus, on appeal a litigant cannot object to the\nadmission of incompetent evidence offered by him. [Citation.] He cannot complain of\nerror in instructions requested by him.

Defendants appropriately objected to this\ninstruction at trial to the extent that it appeared to allow for duplicative recovery of\n\n\n                                              23\n\fpunitive damages. Thus, in having the court dispose of this instruction, Defendants took\nno affirmative steps to invite error.\n       To the extent that Plaintiffs assert that the doctrine of invited error applies because\nDefendants did not propose an alternative instruction and did not propose special\ninterrogatories that would “elicit information about [on] what conduct the jury based its\nawards,” we disagree.

This compensation is called ‘damages.’ [¶] Plaintiffs\nmust prove the amount of their damages. However, Plaintiffs do not have to prove the\nexact amount of the harm or the exact amount of damages that will provide reasonable\ncompensation for the harm. You must not speculate or guess in awarding damages. [¶]\nThe following are specific items of damages claimed by Plaintiffs: [¶] Statutory\ndamages in the minimum amount of $4,000 per Plaintiff, as well as compensatory\ndamages for each Plaintiff’s pain, suffering, inconvenience, emotional distress, medical\nexpenses to-date, and future medical expenses. [¶] In addition, you may award Plaintiffs\nup to three times the amount of their actual damages as a penalty against Defendants.”\nBased on these instructions, the jury initially awarded Unruh statutory penalties to nine\nPlaintiffs greater than three times the amount of the actual damages awarded.\n       The court sent the jury back to fix the damages award with a clarifying instruction.\nThe court stated: “The Court has reviewed the verdict forms. . . . [W]ith respect to a\nnumber of these, . . . it appears to the court that the calculation of statutory damages\nawarded for the Unruh Act claims does not comply with the instructions. . . . [S]tatutory\ndamages cannot exceed three times the amount of the actual damages, and, for example,\nin the case of Mr. Scott Paletz, you have awarded actual damages of [$]2500, but\nstatutory damages of [$]30,000, which far exceeds three times [$]2500. . . . A similar\nerror occurs in the verdict form as to Mr. Fowler, Mr. Ryan, Mr. Rubin, Mr. Newburger,\nMr. Morrison, Laura Morrison, Mr. Shuman, and Mr. Gold.” The court advised the jury:\n“I’m going to send you back in, I’m going to ask you to recalculate these. . . . I’m going\nto leave it up to you. You can decide whether you want to reassess the actual damages or\n\n\n                                             27\n\fyou simply want to go back and recalculate statutory damages as three times the amount\nyou’ve already found, not to exceed three times the amount of actual damages you found.\nAnd if you want to do it that way, it’s a simple mathematical clarification. . . . I’ll ask the\njurors to please go back into the jury room and make the appropriate adjustments as you\nsee fit.” The jury then returned verdicts that comported with Unruh’s maximum damages\nrequirements, awarding the nine Plaintiffs three times the amount of their actual damages\nfor the statutory damages.\n       Defendants assert that the second instruction “failed to account for the fact that the\njury’s lump-sum actual-damages award for all claims may not have included\ncompensation for the Unruh Act claim (or, at the very least, it is likely that not 100% of\nthe compensatory award was for the Unruh Act claim).” We disagree. A reasonable\njuror would understand the court’s subsequent corrective instruction to indicate that the\nstatutory penalties were not to exceed three times the actual damages incurred by\nDefendants’ Unruh violation, and were not to be based on any of the tort causes of action.\nFurthermore, the actual damages awarded under Unruh encompass the damages a\nplaintiff would receive under the emotional distress or negligence claims. Pursuant to\nsection 52, subdivision (h), the actual damages that can be recovered under Unruh are\nboth “special and general damages.” Actual damages are “compensatory damages [that]\ninclude nonquantifiable general damages for emotional distress and pecuniarily\nmeasurable special damages for out-of-pocket losses.” (Walnut Creek Manor v. Fair\nEmployment & Housing Com.

Actual damages defined by Unruh are the same damages that would be\nrecovered under the tort causes of action for intentional and negligent infliction of\nemotional distress and negligence, e.g. pain, suffering, and emotional distress.\n\n\n\n                                              28\n\f       In addition, Defendants argue that the “instructions also directed the jury to award\ntreble damages, even though the Unruh Act leaves the amount of any penalty in the jury’s\ndiscretion (as long as it is greater than $4,000 and less than treble the actual damages).”\nDefendants state that it is possible that the “jury may have issued a lower statutory\ndamages award had the trial court properly stated the law.”\n       We conclude that a reasonable juror would not construe the court’s corrective\ninstruction to mandate an award of treble damages. The court clearly stated that the\nmaximum statutory penalty was treble damages, not that it was the mandated penalty.\nThe court repeatedly stated it was in the jury’s discretion to determine what amount to\naward, stating “I’m going to leave it up to you. You can decide . . . I’ll ask the jurors to\nplease go back into the jury room and make the appropriate adjustments as you see fit.”\nThese instructions did not misguide the jury in their deliberations. Furthermore,\nDefendants’ theory is not supported by the jury verdicts actually rendered. There are\neight Plaintiffs who received less than three times the amount of their actual damage\naward on the jury’s first attempt at calculating damages If the jury had understood the\ncourt’s instruction to mandate treble damages under Unruh, the jury would have altered\nthese statutory penalties accordingly. Yet, after receiving the second instruction from the\ncourt, the jury did not subsequently change these eight awards to be equal to three times\nthe actual damages. It is apparent from the record that the jury properly understood the\ninstruction to require them to award a maximum of treble actual damages in statutory\npenalties.\n       We thus conclude that the court properly discharged its duty to instruct the jury\nwith regard to Unruh statutory damages when it issued the corrective instruction. We\naffirm statutory award of damages on this ground.\n\n\n\n\n                                             29\n\f       6.     We Remand the Attorney Fee Award for the Court to Recalculate Fees\nAttributable to Platinum’s Causes of Action\n       Here, the court awarded $2,099,785.50 in attorney fees to the individual Plaintiffs.\nThe basis for this award was Civil Code section 52, subdivision (a), which expressly\nallows for recovery of attorney fees for Unruh causes of action. In their motion for\nattorney fees related to the Unruh cause of action, Plaintiffs presented the court with an\naffidavit from the supervising attorney describing the work performed and reasonableness\nof each attorney’s hourly rates, and a 140-page exhibit documenting more than two years\nworth of block billing entries.3 In their motion, Plaintiffs did not delineate between fees\nassociated with Unruh and fees associated with the other causes of action, which had no\nstatutory basis for compensation of attorney fees. Rather, Plaintiffs asserted that the\ncauses of action were inextricably intertwined and that it would be impracticable to\nattempt to apportion the fees related to Unruh and those related to the other claims for\nrelief. Defendants opposed the motion, arguing in pertinent part, that Plaintiffs’\ncounsel’s block billing made it impossible to apportion fees and that the fee award should\nbe reduced by the fees associated with Platinum’s causes of action and by discovery\nsanctions that they previously paid.\n       In awarding attorney fees, the court allocated to Plaintiffs fees for almost all of\ntheir counsel’s work on the case. The court reduced Plaintiffs’ total claim for fees by the\nbilling the court discerned to be associated with (1) the intentional infliction of emotional\ndistress punitive damages phase of trial, (2) Plaintiff Platinum’s claims, and (3) a\ndiscovery dispute, for which Defendants already paid sanctions. In explaining how it\nassessed these amounts, the court described its computations for each deduction.\n\n\n\n\n3\n      Block billing refers to “billing for multiple tasks in a single entry.” (Charnay v.\nCobert (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">170</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 177, fn. 8.)\n\n\n                                             30\n\f       First, the court stated that it “deducted $41,893 from the total claim for fees\nassociated with the punitive damages phase of the trial because such fees are not\nrecoverable.” (Boldface omitted.) Notably, this punitive damages phase of trial was\nsolely attributable to Plaintiffs’ punitive damages recovery for intentional infliction of\nemotional distress, and had nothing to do with recovery under Unruh. The $41,893\nfigure was derived by adding up all of Plaintiffs’ counsel’s billing entries associated with\nthe second phase of trial.\n       Second, the court also explained that it “deducted $70,468 from the total claim\nbased on its calculation of the portion of fees reasonably attributable to Platinum’s claims\nwhich are also not recoverable.” (Boldface omitted.) In determining the fees attributable\nto Platinum’s claims, the court reasoned that “since Platinum’s total recovery was\napproximately 3.2% of the total recovery of all the plaintiffs, it is reasonable to attribute\nthat percentage of the time spent to work relating to Platinum’s claims.” The court\ncalculated that $70,468 was 3.2% of the attorney fees claimed by Plaintiffs.\n       Lastly, the court stated that it “deducted $10,000 for the fees associated with a\ndiscovery dispute that were previously paid by Defendants as sanctions.” (Boldface\nomitted.) The total deductions amounted to $122,371.\n       The court chose not to apportion fees associated with the individual Plaintiffs’ tort\ncauses of action from fees associated with their cause of action for Unruh. The court\nstated that it “carefully considered the complexity of the litigation, the fact that the\nplaintiffs’ claims, as tried, were substantially interrelated and the defendants have not\npointed out any rational way to segregate the fees attributable to non-Unruh Act claims as\nto the individual plaintiffs.” The court awarded a total of $2,099,785.50 in attorney fees\nto Plaintiffs for their successful Unruh claims.\n       On appeal, Defendants assert that we should reverse the attorney fee award,\ncontending that (1) the trial court failed to apportion out fees unrelated to the Unruh\nclaims; (2) the trial court used an unreasonable method for deducting fees related to\nPlaintiff Platinum’s claims; and (3) the trial court erred in not applying the lodestar\nmethod for calculating fees. We review the court’s attorney fee award for an abuse of\n\n\n                                              31\n\fdiscretion. (Visher v.

The Supreme Court has explained that “the lodestar is the basic fee for\ncomparable legal services in the community; it may be adjusted by the court based on\nfactors including, as relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions\ninvolved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of\nthe litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of\nthe fee award. [Citation.] The purpose of such adjustment is to fix a fee at the fair\nmarket value for the particular action.” (Ketchum, at p. 1132.)\n       As the lodestar method for calculating attorney fees guides our analysis, we\ncharacterize Defendants’ arguments regarding the attorney fees into two categories:\nchallenges to the attorneys’ reasonable hourly rates and challenges to the amount of time\nfor which Plaintiffs’ attorneys seek compensation. We address each set of arguments in\nturn, expending the bulk of our analysis on the court’s calculation of compensable hours,\nwhich Defendants have focused on at trial and on appeal.\n       a.     Plaintiffs’ Hourly Fees Were Reasonable\n       Defendants contend that the court erred in its attorney fees analysis because “[t]he\norder awarding fees contains no findings as to the reasonableness of the rates or the hours\nexpended, nor does it indicate whether the court actually reviewed the individual time\nentries.” Yet, the “trial court is not required ‘to issue a statement of decision with regard\n\n\n                                             32\n\fto the fee award,’ or to provide detailed reasons for overruling objections to a fee request.\n[Citation.] . . . ‘No specific findings reflecting the court’s calculations [are] required.\n[Citation.] “The record need only show that the attorney fees were awarded according to\nthe ‘lodestar’ or ‘touchstone’ approach.” [Citation.] On appeal we infer all findings in\nfavor of the prevailing parties.’ [Citation.]” (Lockaway Storage v.

Turken, a partner at the firm representing Plaintiffs and the\nsupervising attorney of the litigation at issue in this case, provided a declaration in\nsupport of the motion for attorney fees. In the declaration, he explained each attorney’s\nrole in the litigation, their level of experience, and their corresponding hourly rate. The\nrates varied from $200 per hour for the most junior associate to $675 per hour for the\nmost senior attorney who had more than 30 years of experience. Mr. Turken attested that\n“[t]he hourly fees charged by [Plaintiffs’ counsel’s firm] are lower than or comparable to\nthose by similar firms.” He asserted that to the best of his knowledge, the fees Plaintiffs\nrequested were “correct and were necessarily incurred in preparing for the trial in this\naction.” Attached to and identified within Mr. Turken’s declaration were over 140 pages\nof block billing entries, which set forth the work performed by Plaintiffs’ attorneys prior\nto and during trial. The court relied on Mr. Turken’s declaration and the billing records\nto make its determinations regarding time spent on Unruh aspects of the litigation and\nreasonable hourly rates. Defendants failed to submit credible evidence to contest the\nbilling entries. Rather, they submitted handwritten notes on billing entries from an\nassociate without providing her qualifications to perform such an analysis of billing\nentries.\n\n\n\n\n                                              33\n\f       With the standard of review in mind, we presume the court found Mr. Turken’s\nexplanation of the hourly rates credible and relied on Plaintiffs’ evidence to determine the\nreasonable amount of attorney fees. This appears particularly true as the hourly rates\nwere unaltered by the court and Defendant did not provide any evidence that such rates\nwere unreasonable. Below, Defendants only argued that multiple attorneys billing for the\nsame task made the fees unreasonable, that the tasks were not legal in nature, or that\nblock billing made it difficult to discern what work was attributable to Unruh. As the\nreasonableness of the hourly rates went unchallenged below, we lack any evidence to\nsupport a conclusion that the court abused its discretion when it implicitly found that such\nfees were reasonable.

Each\ncause of action is based on the theory that Defendants denied Plaintiffs access to hotel\nservices because they were Jewish. Issues common to all causes of action were pervasive\nthroughout the litigation, such that apportionment of fees was impracticable. Therefore\nthe court’s decision not to apportion damages with regard to the individual Plaintiffs’\ncauses of action did not result in an abuse of discretion.\n       Defendants argue that they should not have to pay “extra fees because Plaintiffs’\ncounsel chose to block bill.” It is well established that “block billing is not objectionable\n‘per se,’ ” though it may “increase the risk that the trial court, in a reasonable exercise of\nits discretion, will discount a fee request.” (Jaramillo v.

Even if the billing\nentries were further broken down, the work would likely be attributable to Unruh causes\nof action based on the nature of Plaintiffs’ claims and how they were presented at trial.\n“The ‘experienced trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional services\nrendered in his court, and . . . his judgment . . . will not be disturbed unless the appellate\ncourt is convinced that it is clearly wrong.’ [Citations.]” (Serrano v. Priest, supra,\n20 Cal.3d at p. 49.) We conclude that the trial court properly exercised its discretion and\njudgment in relying on the block billing entries under the facts of this case.\n       Defendants also assert that the court impermissibly shifted the burden to\nDefendants to apportion fees related to Unruh and those related to the other causes of\naction. Yet, as the court pointed out, “Plaintiffs’ fee claim is supported by detailed\nbilling records covering the two plus years of time from the plaintiffs’ first meeting with\ntheir law firm in August, 2010 up to and including post trial work on the fee application\nand costs bill in December, 2012. The Plaintiffs also submitted a declaration by the lead\ntrial attorney, Mr. James Turken, supporting the billing rates utilized and the time spent\nin litigating this complex case.” Based on the court’s reliance on this evidence in\nrendering the fee award, it can be deduced that the court implicitly found that Plaintiffs\nmet their burden to establish the fees that were permissible for them to recover based on\ncredible evidence. The court noted that in opposition, Defendants “submitted an analysis\nof the billing made by an associate in their firm identifying . . . ‘objectionable’ fee\nentries. However, the Defendants presented no evidence of the competence of that\nindividual to assess the appropriateness of the entries.” Consistent with the court’s\nfindings, the record reveals that Defendants submitted an associate’s declaration which\nfailed to set forth her qualifications to establish that she was competent to assess the\nbilling. This declaration was accompanied by copies of Plaintiffs’ billing records\ncovered in the associate’s hand-written notes next to entries, stating “nonfee,” “non-\nbillable, non-legal, admin,” “duplicative,” “superfluous,” and other words. Defendants\nfailed to produce any competent evidence in support of their opposition. Defendants also\n\n\n                                              36\n\fdid not propose an alternative method for calculating the fees or present calculations\nregarding how to reduce the fees. The Court stated that Defendants simply argued that\n“the mere identification of the entries as ‘objectionable block-billing entries,’ requires the\nCourt to reject them in toto.” We conclude that the court did not impermissibly shift the\nburden to Defendants to apportion attorney fees. Rather, Plaintiffs met their burden in\nproving their fees and Defendants failed to produce any creditable evidence to the\ncontrary.\n       Defendants’ evidentiary shortcomings also impact Defendants’ contention that the\n“trial court erred in awarding fees to Plaintiffs for noncompensable activities,4 such as\nmarketing and press work, and various inefficiencies and duplicative efforts.” As\nexplained in the preceding paragraph, Defendants’ argument regarding allegedly\nimproper billing entries is unsupported by competent evidence. When challenging\nattorney fees, “it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific items\nchallenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence. General arguments\nthat fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.” (Premier\nMedical Management Systems, Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn.

We will not engage in a factual analysis of these\nundeveloped issues on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n4\n       We note that these alleged “noncompensable activities” can at times, warrant\ncompensation.

In Bell, the Court held that where the plaintiff’s counsel admitted that the\nmajority of his block billing entries were spent on issues unrelated to that for which he\ncould recover attorney fees, the court should have exercised its discretion to assign a\nreasonable percentage to the entries appropriate for recovery, or not award fees for those\nentries. (Ibid.) That is not the case here, where there is no evidence that any of the\nentries for the individual Plaintiffs’ causes of action were attributable mostly or divisibly\nto issues unassociated with Unruh claims.\n       For the reasons stated above, we affirm the trial court’s decision not to apportion\nfees for the individual Plaintiffs’ causes of action and the court’s exercise of discretion to\nrely on Plaintiffs’ block billing evidence. To this extent, the court did not err in\ndetermining the attorney fee award.\n       c.     The Court Abused Its Discretion by Applying an Unreasonable\nMethodology for Deducting Fees Associated with Platinum’s Claims\n       Defendants assert that the “percentage of total recovery” proxy for assessing\nattorney fees was “an unreasonable and arbitrary method for deducting fees for work\nrelating to Platinum.” We agree that the court abused its discretion in utilizing the\npercentage of total recovery as a proxy for the amount of attorney fees to be apportioned\nfor Platinum’s claims. The court’s reliance on the percentage of recovery attributable to\nPlatinum’s claims is particularly arbitrary, as under this theory, a defense attorney could\neffectively cause their client to pay more in attorneys’ fees by successfully defeating\ncauses of action that are separate and not intertwined with Unruh causes of action. This\nmethod of apportionment could effectively penalize Defendants for their successes in\nlitigating Platinum’s causes of action. The unreasonableness of the court’s\napportionment methodology becomes even more evident on appeal, when the percentage\nof recovery is subject to alteration: Plaintiffs’ attorney fees award could fluctuate based\non Defendants’ success on appeal in obtaining reversal of damages awards. To prevent\n\n\n                                              38\n\fduplicative recovery, we reversed the intentional infliction of emotional distress punitive\ndamages award in this opinion. This ruling reduces Plaintiffs’ total recovery by 24.5%.\nIf we were to affirm this methodology, the trial court would have to recalculate\napportionment of fees associated with Platinum based on the new total damages figure.\nThis would effectively reduce Plaintiffs’ attorney fees for entirely arbitrary reasons, as\nthe evidence supporting the fees award has not changed. There has been no new showing\nthat Plaintiffs’ counsel worked any less on Unruh claims or any more on Platinum’s\ncontract based causes of action.\n       We thus conclude that this method of apportionment for Platinum’s claims\nresulted in a miscarriage of justice.5 We remand for the court to reapportion fees\nassociated with Platinum’s claims. On remand, the court must determine whether billing\nentries can be attributed solely to Platinum’s claim. The time stated in such billing\nentries attributable solely or mostly to Platinum’s claims must reduce the total time used\nto calculate the lodestar amount. In addition, the court “must examine the nature and\n‘course of conduct’ upon which the claims are based.” (Harman v. City and County of\n\n5\n        To the extent that Defendants assert that the “percentage of total recovery” method\nof assessing fees should be applied to measure the fees incurred in pursuing punitive\ndamages, this is no longer a viable argument. We have reversed the award of punitive\ndamages to the individual Plaintiffs for intentional infliction of emotional distress, and\nthose damages no longer compose any part of the total recovery. In addition, the\n“percentage of total recovery” method of assessing fees is unreasonable for the reasons\nstated above. Furthermore, Defendants misconstrue the principles of apportionment by\nattempting to apply that method in this context. Prior to trial and during the first phase of\ntrial, which dealt with actual damages resulting from the discrimination, the emotional\ndistress claims and the Unruh claims were inextricably intertwined. Under both claims,\nPlaintiffs sought to prove that Defendants discriminated against them by refusing to\nprovide them services at the hotel because they were Jewish. The attorneys’ work\n(occurring pretrial and during the first phase of trial) that went into proving the actual\ndamages associated with the Unruh violation was also attributable to proving actual\ndamages for emotional distress. Only in the second phase of trial, which dealt entirely\nwith punitive damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress, could the court\nextricate the attorney fees associated with intentional infliction of emotional distress from\nthose associated with Unruh claims. The court’s apportionment was thus proper, as this\nphase of trial was unassociated with Unruh.\n\n\n                                             39\n\fSan Francisco (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2244847\"><a href=\"/opinion/2244847/harman-v-city-and-county-of-san-francisco/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">407</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 423.) The court is to determine whether\nPlatinum’s causes of action are inextricably intertwined with the Unruh cause of action\nby reasoning whether claims involve a common core of facts or are based on related legal\ntheories. (Taylor v. Nabors Drilling USA, LP (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">222</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1228</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1251.) If\nthe issues in Platinum’s claims and the Unruh claims are so inextricably intertwined that\nit would be impractical or impossible to separate the hours billed into compensable and\nnoncompensable units, then the court need not attempt to apportion the hours and may\naward fees for all of the hours. (See Ibid.) If the claims are not inextricably intertwined,\nthe court must exercise its discretion to assign a reasonable percentage of the block\nbilling to fees associated with Platinum’s claims by relying on the billing evidence\nprovided by Plaintiffs and the court’s own assessment of the work expended by\nPlaintiffs’ counsel on the different claims based on its pretrial and trial experience\nworking with the parties.\n       In conclusion, we remand the attorney fees award to the trial court to determine\nthe appropriate amount of attorney fees by applying a reasonable method to apportion\nfees associated with Platinum’s claims. We affirm the court with regard to all other\nissues raised by Defendants as to attorney fees award.\n       7.     Defendants’ Remaining Issues on Appeal Are Moot\n       The remaining issues raised by Defendants are related to the causes of action for\nintentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, and negligence. Specifically,\nDefendants argue that: Plaintiffs failed to prove unlawful intent to support a claim for\nintentional infliction of emotional distress, Defendants owed no duty to Plaintiffs\nsufficient to support a claim for negligence or negligent infliction of emotional distress,\nand the jury provided inconsistent and irreconcilable verdicts by rendering verdicts in\nfavor of eleven Plaintiffs for both negligent and intentional infliction of emotional\ndistress.\n\n\n\n\n                                             40\n\f       We decline to address these arguments because “ ‘[w]here the verdict of the jury\nand the judgment based thereon may be sustained on any reasonable theory, it will not be\ndisturbed by an appellate court.’ [Citation.].” (Nelson v. Painless Parker (1930)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

[Citations.] All intendments and\npresumptions are made to support the judgment on matters as to which the record is\nsilent.”].) Here, the verdict for actual damages and statutory penalties is affirmable under\nthe Unruh cause of action, which the jury decided in favor of each of the individual\nPlaintiffs. Because we reverse the award of punitive damages, we need not address the\nintentional infliction of emotional distress claim.\n       In sum, to the extent we affirm the jury’s verdict, we do so by relying on\nPlaintiffs’ Unruh violation theory of recovery. We decline to address Plaintiffs’\narguments regarding negligence, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and\nintentional infliction of emotional distress claims as they are not decisive to any aspect of\nour holding.\n\n\n\n\n                                             41\n\f                                     DISPOSITION\n       The punitive damages award is reversed.
