We will affirm.\n\n       Castillo, an inmate incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution at McKean\n\nin Bradford, Pennsylvania (“FCI-McKean”), filed a complaint against the United States\n\nwith respect to prison staff. Castillo alleged that prison staff members acted negligently\n\nwhen they compelled him and several other Mexican inmates to meet with recently-\n\ntransferred inmates who were members of a rival gang, the Aztecas. Specifically, on\n\nJanuary 20, 2004, FCI-McKean staff assembled the affected inmates in the gymnasium\n\nfor a meeting with the Aztecas. Despite Castillo’s and others’ voiced concerns, the\n\nAztecas were escorted into the gymnasium. During the meeting, a fist fight occurred,\n\nduring which Castillo states that the Aztecas assaulted him and the others. A prison\n\nSWAT team arrived and separated the two groups, forcing the inmates to the ground.\n\nCastillo was handcuffed, shackled, and lifted to his feet by his arms, at which time he\n\nheard his back and shoulder “pop.” He was placed in the segregated housing unit\n\n(“SHU”). A medical staff member visited Castillo, Castillo stated that he was okay, and\n\nhe was released into the general population. However, on January 22, 2004, Castillo\n\nsought medical assistance for back and shoulder pain arising from the January 20, 2004\n\nincident. After examining him, a medical staff member advised Castillo to do exercises\n\nand prescribed 800 milligrams of ibuprofen. Castillo states that he was denied proper\n\nmedical treatment for his injury between February 9-17, 2004, and was placed in the SHU\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\fon those same dates for retaliatory reasons.\n\n       After unsuccessfully pursuing an administrative claim under the Federal Tort\n\nClaims Act (“FTCA”), Castillo filed his FTCA complaint and sought $2 million\n\ncompensatory damages for his personal injury negligently caused by prison staff by\n\nforcing him to meet with the Aztecas on January 20, 2004. The United States filed a\n\nmotion to dismiss, or in the alternative, for summary judgment. Castillo filed a response.\n\nThe Magistrate Judge issued a report and recommendation that the motion be granted.\n\nCastillo filed objections, and the United States filed a response. The District Court\n\nadopted the report and recommendation and granted the motion.\n\n       Castillo appeals and has filed a motion for the appointment of counsel. The United\n\nStates has filed a motion for summary affirmance of the District Court’s order. We have\n\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n       Under the FTCA, the United States waives sovereign immunity for personal injury\n\ncaused by the negligence or the wrongful act or omission of a government employee\n\nwhile acting within the scope of his employment, as is alleged in Castillo’s case.\n\nHowever, the FTCA is subject to exceptions, such as the discretionary function exception.\n\nIn relevant part, the discretionary function exception provides that no liability shall lie for\n\nclaims “based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a\n\ndiscretionary function or duty . . . whether or not the discretion involved be abused.”\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2680(a). As discussed by the District Court, whether the discretionary\n\n\n\n                                               3\n\ffunction exception bars suit against the United States depends on the application of a two-\n\npart test. First, the court must determine whether the challenged conduct “involved an\n\nelement of judgment or choice.” United States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 322 (1991).\n\nSecond, if the conduct involved judgment, the court must determine “whether that\n\njudgment is of the kind that the discretionary function exception was designed to shield,”\n\nfocusing on whether the conduct was based on public policy considerations. Id. at 322-\n\n23. Stated another way, the discretionary function exception bars government liability if\n\nthe challenged action “involves the permissible exercise of policy judgment.” Berkovitz\n\nv. United States, 486 U.S. 531, 537 (1988).\n\n       The District Court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over\n\nCastillo’s claims under the FTCA because the prison officials’ actions fell within the\n\ndiscretionary function exception to the FTCA’s waiver of sovereign immunity. We agree.\n\nIn support of its motion, the United States submitted the declaration of Donald Reich,\n\nCaptain at FCI-McKean, who states that there are no official policies addressing how\n\nrival gang members should be integrated in the general prison population. In evaluating\n\nthe situation, Capt. Reich determined that bringing the rival inmates together in a\n\ncontrolled setting was safer than releasing the Aztecas onto the open prison compound, as\n\nthe staff would be able to prevent the presence of weapons and minimize the risk of a\n\nfight. In the event of an altercation, the staff would be able to prevent it from escalating\n\nand involving other inmates. Accordingly, Capt. Reich developed and wrote a plan for\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\fthe meeting between the rival groups, which was attended by staff members with\n\nadditional staff and medical personnel on standby. The integration plan, a product of\n\nCapt. Reich’s judgment and his analysis of policy considerations (including the safety of\n\ninmates and orderly operation of the prison), is clearly the type of conduct that the\n\ndiscretionary function exception was intended to shield.\n\n       Castillo argued in District Court that the decision to release the Aztecas into the\n\ngeneral prison population is outside of the discretionary function exception. In support,\n\nCastillo submitted his own affidavit in which he states that the prison’s Regional Office\n\ndirected FCI-McKean officials to release the Aztecas into the general population.\n\nCastillo’s argument appears to be that such a directive precludes a finding that any\n\ndiscretion was involved in this matter. However, as noted earlier, Capt. Reich formulated\n\nthe inmate integration plan (including the controlled meeting of the inmates) and\n\nexercised policy judgment in doing so; there was no existing policy on how to accomplish\n\nthe Regional Office’s directive.1\n\n       We also agree with the District Court’s conclusion that, to the extent that Castillo’s\n\n\n       1\n          In addition, Castillo relied on the language of section 2680(a) that bars “any\nclaim based upon an act or omission of an employee of the Government exercising due\ncare, in the execution of a statute or regulation, whether or not such statute or regulation\nbe valid ,” contending that FCI-McKean officials failed to use “due care” in following the\nRegional Office’s instruction to integrate the Aztecas into the general prison population.\nIn light of our conclusion that Castillo’s claim is barred because it is “based upon the\nexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or\nduty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the Government,” 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2680(a), we do not reach this “due care” argument.\n\n                                              5\n\fcomplaint contains claims of constitutional violations regarding retaliation and denial of\n\nmedical treatment, those claims are subject to the requirement of exhausting\n\nadministrative remedies under 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). Castillo presented no documentary\n\nevidence refuting the declaration of Regional Office counsel that Castillo filed no request\n\nfor administrative remedy regarding those claims. As such, those claims were not\n\nproperly before the District Court.\n\n       Because no substantial question is presented in this appeal, see 3d Cir. LAR 27.4\n\nand I.O.P. 10.6, we will grant the appellee’s motion and will summarily affirm the\n\nDistrict Court’s order. Castillo’s motion for the appointment of counsel is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\f",

In support,\n\nCastillo submitted his own affidavit in which he states that the prison’s Regional Office\n\ndirected FCI-McKean officials to release the Aztecas into the general population.\n\nCastillo’s argument appears to be that such a directive precludes a finding that any\n\ndiscretion was involved in this matter. However, as noted earlier, Capt. Reich formulated\n\nthe inmate integration plan (including the controlled meeting of the inmates) and\n\nexercised policy judgment in doing so; there was no existing policy on how to accomplish\n\nthe Regional Office’s directive.1\n\n       We also agree with the District Court’s conclusion that, to the extent that Castillo’s\n\n\n       1\n          In addition, Castillo relied on the language of section 2680(a) that bars “any\nclaim based upon an act or omission of an employee of the Government exercising due\ncare, in the execution of a statute or regulation, whether or not such statute or regulation\nbe valid ,” contending that FCI-McKean officials failed to use “due care” in following the\nRegional Office’s instruction to integrate the Aztecas into the general prison population.\nIn light of our conclusion that Castillo’s claim is barred because it is “based upon the\nexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or\nduty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the Government,” 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2680(a), we do not reach this “due care” argument.\n\n                                              5\n\fcomplaint contains claims of constitutional violations regarding retaliation and denial of\n\nmedical treatment, those claims are subject to the requirement of exhausting\n\nadministrative remedies under 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). Castillo presented no documentary\n\nevidence refuting the declaration of Regional Office counsel that Castillo filed no request\n\nfor administrative remedy regarding those claims. As such, those claims were not\n\nproperly before the District Court.\n\n       Because no substantial question is presented in this appeal, see 3d Cir. LAR 27.4\n\nand I.O.P. 10.6, we will grant the appellee’s motion and will summarily affirm the\n\nDistrict Court’s order. Castillo’s motion for the appointment of counsel is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\f</pre>",
