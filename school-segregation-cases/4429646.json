Bunker, Paul Carrell, Everett Brew Houston,\n              Jr., W. Andrew Buchholz, Scott J. Leighty, Jad L.\n              Davis, and Holly Clause (collectively, “the\n              Physicians”).    Strandhagen sought declarations\n              against them that (1) she was terminated without\n              cause, meaning the liquidated damages provision in\n              the parties’ contract would be inapplicable to her;\n              and (2) the liquidated damages provision was an\n              unenforceable penalty. (CR.4-9).\n\n Course of    The Physicians filed a Plea to the Jurisdiction\nProceedings   seeking dismissal of Strandhagen’s claims. (CR.77-\n              84). The trial court granted the Plea as to ground (1)\n              and denied it as to ground (2). (CR.184; Appx. 2).\n\n              Strandhagen then filed a Motion for Summary\n              Judgment on ground (2). (CR.154-159).\n\nTrial Court   The trial court granted Strandhagen’s Motion,\nDisposition   declaring the liquidated damages provision to be an\n              unenforceable penalty. (CR.212; Appx. 1). This\n              resulted in a Final Judgment.\n\n              The Physicians filed a Motion for New Trial, urging\n              in regard to ground (2) of Strandhagen’s claim that it\n              was error to deny the Physicians’ Plea and to grant\n              Strandhagen’s Motion. (CR.213-227). Following a\n              hearing, the trial court denied the Physicians’ Motion\n              for New Trial. (CR.271; RR.1-29; Appx. 3). The\n              Physicians timely perfected appeal.

See Tex. R.

This case also presents important and unsettled legal\n\nquestions as applied to these facts, including: (1) What elements of proof\n\nare required to prevail on an affirmative defense of “unenforceable\n\npenalty?”, and (2) When is a declaratory judgment claim sufficiently ripe\n\nfor review?\n\n\n\n\n                                       xi\n\f                         ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n\nIssue 1:   Was it reversible error for the district court to grant\n           Strandhagen’s traditional motion for summary judgment\n           declaring the parties’ liquidated damages provision to be an\n           unenforceable penalty?\n\n\n\nIssue 2:   Was it reversible error for the district court to deny the portion\n           of the Physicians’ Plea to the Jurisdiction contending that\n           Strandhagen’s claim was not yet ripe for decision?\n\n\n\n\n                                    xii\n\f                           STATEMENT OF FACTS\n      Dr. Tracy Strandhagen, an anesthesiologist, left her medical practice\n\ngroup approximately five years prior to the expiration of the seven-year\n\nterm that she had contractually agreed to work. (CR.160; Sealed.CR.12).\n\nBefore Strandhagen’s partners decided whether to sue her for breach of\n\ncontract or other claims, Strandhagen filed this preemptive lawsuit seeking\n\njudicial declarations that would preclude her partners from recovering\n\nagainst her under the liquidated damages provision of the parties’ contract\n\nif they decided to bring a future claim against her. (CR.4-9). Strandhagen\n\nnamed as defendants seven individual partners, who were the then-current\n\nmembers of the practice group’s Advisory Board (Appellants Dr. Noah S.\n\nBunker, Dr. Paul Carrell, Dr. Everett Brew Houston, Jr., Dr. W. Andrew\n\nBuchholz, Dr. Scott J. Leighty, Dr. Jad L. Davis, and Dr. Holly Clause)\n\n(collectively, “the Physicians”).         (CR.1-3, 162, 179). 1     The trial court\n\ngranted declaratory relief in favor of Strandhagen. (CR.212, 271). The\n\nPhysicians urge this Court to reverse that decision.\n\n\n\n\n1      Although Strandhagen appears to have chosen these defendants based on their\nprior service on the Board, she sued them in their individual capacities, not in their\ncapacities as Board members.\n\n\n                                          1\n\fI.      THE PARTIES ENTERED A SERIES OF CONTRACTS\n        GOVERNING THEIR MEDICAL PRACTICE.\n\n        Tracy Strandhagen and approximately sixty other anesthesiologists\n\nwere members of the Austin Anesthesiology Group (“AAG”). (CR.38, 160).\n\nIn October 2011, they collectively decided to sell 100% of their outstanding\n\ninterests in AAG to American Anesthesiology of Texas (“AAT” or “the\n\nCompany”)2 pursuant to a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement\n\n(“the Purchase Agreement”).                    (CR.38, 77, 155, 162). 3            The\n\nanesthesiologists thereby became “physician partners” of AAT (“the\n\nPartners”). 4 (CR.162). In connection with this transaction, the Company\n\nand the Partners entered two types of additional contracts. (CR.162, 186-\n\n187).\n\n        First, the Company and the Partners entered an Advisory Board and\n\nInternal Operations Agreement (“the Operations Agreement”). (CR.77,\n\n162-183; Appx. 4). This agreement (1) established the duties, powers, and\n\n\n\n2      AAT is an indirect subsidiary of a national medical services provider, Mednax,\nInc. (CR.6, 80; Sealed.CR.11).\n3    A copy of the Purchase Agreement is not included in the record. It is referenced,\nhowever, by the other contracts contained therein. (See CR.162; Sealed.CR.1).\n\n4       Under the assorted agreements, the anesthesiologists are referred as the\n“Physicians,” “Partners,” and/or “Physician Partners.” Herein, when referenced as an\nentire group, they will be called the “Partners.” To distinguish this from references to\nthe seven, individual physicians named as defendants in this lawsuit, the latter will be\ncalled the “Physicians.”\n\n\n                                           2\n\fprocedures of the Partners’ Advisory Board, Medical Director, and Partners’\n\nRepresentative; (2) identified the individuals who would serve the initial\n\nterms of those positions; and (3) set forth the obligations owed by each\n\nphysician to the other Partners and the Company. (Id.).\n\n      Second, the Company entered separate Employment Agreements\n\nwith each of the Partners “to protect the business interests and goodwill of\n\n[the Company] and to promote the effective administration and\n\ncontinuation of the Practice.” (Sealed.CR.1, 3, 12; see also CR.111, 155, 166-\n\n167).5 As shown by Strandhagen’s contract, the Employment Agreements\n\nset forth, inter alia, (1) the duties, services, and standards of conduct that\n\nthe Partners promised to provide; (2) the parties’ billing and compensation\n\nagreements;    and   (3)   the   terms    of   the   Partners’   non-competes.\n\n(Sealed.CR.1-12, 24). Importantly, the Employment Agreements specified a\n\nset number of years that each Partner agreed to work for the practice (“the\n\nInitial Term”). (CR.167; Sealed.CR.12). Strandhagen’s contract specified\n\nthat “the term of [the Employment Agreement] shall be a period of seven\n\n(7) years,” which would expire in approximately October 2018.\n\n(Sealed.CR.12). 6\n\n\n5     Strandhagen’s Employment Agreement was submitted as a sealed, in camera\n“Exhibit A-1” as part of the summary-judgment record and in connection with the\nMotion for New Trial. (CR.146-147, 150-152, 271; Sealed.CR; RR.23-24, 28).\n\n\n\n                                      3\n\f      A.     The Partners Promised to Stay With the Practice for a\n             Defined Period for Important Financial Reasons.\n\n      The Partners’ agreements to stay with the practice for a designated\n\nperiod of time was tied to the amount of monetary consideration they\n\nreceived under the Purchase Agreement. (See CR.144, 167-168). Their\n\ncollective agreements to stay for a designated number of years also had\n\nimportant financial implications for the practice.              First, each of the\n\nphysicians brought to the practice many years of experience and goodwill\n\nthat could not be readily replaced in the event of an early departure. (See\n\nSealed.CR.1). Strandhagen’s Employment Agreement reflects that she, like\n\nher Partners, “ha[d] practiced medicine in the Specialty for many years and\n\n[] developed substantial personal goodwill, including business contacts,\n\nreputation, and other relationships in the health care industry.”\n\n(Sealed.CR.1).\n\n      Beyond the Partners’ goodwill value, the profitability of their practice\n\nalso depended on each Partner working a designated shift schedule, as\n\ndetermined by the Medical Director.             (CR.168; Sealed.CR.2-3).         They\n\nworked in “units” to fulfill the schedule, which required the cooperation\n\nand dedication of each Partner. (Sealed.CR.2, 7, Annex A, B). Fulfillment\n\n\n6      It appears that the majority of the Partners, like Strandhagen, agreed to seven-\nyear terms while seven of them negotiated shorter terms of employment. (See CR.168;\nSealed.CR.12).\n\n\n                                          4\n\fof these obligations allowed the practice to earn annual gross profits, which\n\ndirectly affected the Partners’ ability to earn annual incentive bonuses.\n\n(CR.187; Sealed.CR.9, Annex A, B).\n\n     B.    The Partners Agreed to be Bound by a Liquidated\n           Damages Provision Regulating Early Departure from\n           their Practice.\n\n     In recognition of the financial importance of the Partners remaining\n\nwith the practice for the entire duration of their agreed-upon terms, they\n\ncollectively agreed to be bound by a liquidated damages provision stating\n\nthat, if a Partner departed the practice early, he or she would be liable to\n\nthe remaining Partners for a specified amount of damages, subject to\n\ncertain exceptions. (CR.168). More specifically, the Operations Agreement\n\nprovided that—given (1) the consideration received by the Partners under\n\nthe Purchase Agreement and the calculation of bonuses based upon the\n\nprofits of the Company, and (2) the Partners’ agreements to work for a\n\nspecified Initial Term—if any Partner departed early, the others “may suffer\n\nharm, including, without limitation, increased workloads necessitated by\n\nsuch termination, material impairment of the ability of the Physicians to\n\nearn bonuses, . . . material impairment of the Physicians’ relationships with\n\nhospitals and other [parties] . . ., and hiring and training costs related to\n\nreplacement physicians.” (CR.167-168, 187).\n\n\n                                     5\n\f     The Partners “acknowledge[d] and agree[d]” that such that damages\n\nwould be difficult to prove, and that it would otherwise be inconvenient or\n\nnon-feasible to obtain another adequate remedy. (CR.168). Thus, they\n\nagreed that if any Partner terminated his or her employment prior to the\n\nexpiration of the Initial Term (with some exceptions, as discussed below),\n\nthen he or she would pay the remaining Partners “as liquidated\n\ndamages and not as a penalty, the amount set forth below.” (CR.168)\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n     The majority of the sixty Partners agreed to be bound by a liquidated\n\ndamage amount of $500,000. (CR.156, 168). Seven others negotiated\n\nindividual liquidated damages amounts between $240,000 and $400,000,\n\npresumably tied to having negotiated shorter “Initial Terms” of\n\nemployment.     (CR.168).    The Partners “each acknowledge[d] and\n\nagree[d] that the Liquidated Damages Amount is reasonable in\n\nlight of the anticipated harm which would be caused by a Terminating\n\n[Partner’s] breach of or default under this Agreement, the difficulty of proof\n\nof loss, the inconvenience and non-feasibility of otherwise obtaining an\n\nadequate remedy, and the value of the transactions to be consummated\n\nunder the Purchase Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.”\n\n(CR.168) (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n                                      6\n\f      The Partners agreed to several exceptions in which the liquidated\n\ndamages provision would not be enforced. First and foremost, a Partner\n\nwould not be liable for liquidated damages if the Company terminated the\n\nPartner’s employment without cause prior to expiration of the Initial Term.\n\n(CR.168). The Employment Agreement specified events that would provide\n\nthe Company “cause” for termination. (Sealed.CR.13-18). Second, a Partner\n\nwould not be liable for liquidated damages if his or her employment ended\n\nearly due to the Partner’s death or disability, a down-sizing of the company,\n\nor similar specified exceptions. (CR.169). Finally, each Partner had the\n\noption of petitioning for permission by the majority to terminate his or her\n\nemployment early without payment of liquidated damages in the event of\n\n“unforeseen circumstances” or “to provide other services to the Company or\n\nits Affiliates.” (CR.169).\n\n      The Partners expressly acknowledged the importance of these\n\nprovisions. The Operations Agreement states that their “agreement to be\n\nbound by the covenants set forth herein, which [] are narrowly tailored and\n\nnecessary to protect the Physicians’ legitimate interests as a group,”\n\nconstituted a “significant inducement to [the Partners] entering into the\n\nPurchase Agreement and consummating the transaction contemplated\n\nthereby.” (CR.162).\n\n\n\n                                      7\n\fII.    STRANDHAGEN DEPARTED THE PRACTICE FIVE YEARS\n       EARLIER THAN SHE HAD CONTRACTUALLY AGREED.\n\n       Under Strandhagen’s Employment Agreement, the initial seven-year\n\nterm of her employment was not set to expire until approximately October\n\n2018. (Sealed.CR.12).     Strandhagen’s employment was terminated five\n\nyears early, between July-September 2013. (CR.88, 160, 187).\n\n       Strandhagen claimed she was constructively discharged on the basis\n\nof gender discrimination in July 2013. (CR.88, 93, 101). If that were true,\n\nit would provide a “terminated without cause” exception to her liability\n\nunder the liquidated damages provision. (CR.168). To the contrary, the\n\nCompany claimed that, following a series of disciplinary infractions,\n\nStrandhagen quit or was terminated with cause in September 2013.\n\n(CR.103, 144). Under that circumstance—whether Strandhagen resigned\n\nwithout first obtaining permission from the majority of her partners for an\n\nearly departure or was rightfully terminated for engaging in detrimental\n\nconduct, failing or refusing to adhere to specified policies and standards, or\n\nbreaching other terms of her Employment Agreement—Strandhagen would\n\nbe liable for payment of liquidated damages. (CR.167-169; Sealed.CR.13-\n\n15).\n\n\n\n\n                                      8\n\fIII. STRANDHAGEN FILED SEPARATE PROCEEDINGS AGAINST\n     THE COMPANY AND HER PHYSICIAN PARTNERS.\n\n       In approximately December 2013, Strandhagen filed an employment-\n\ndiscrimination complaint against the Company with the Texas Workforce\n\nCommission, Civil Rights Division and the EEOC. (CR.39, 80, 85-87, 91-\n\n92).   Despite having not made any representation of discrimination in\n\nconnection with the buyout just two months earlier, Strandhagen now\n\nclaimed that she had suffered such discrimination “for many years.”\n\n(CR.93, 144). The primary issue in Strandhagen’s proceeding against the\n\nCompany was, therefore, whether she was terminated with or without cause\n\n(i.e., whether Strandhagen’s termination resulted from her misconduct or\n\nwas based on gender discrimination).\n\n       While those administrative claims were pending, Strandhagen\n\ninitiated this suit in the Travis County District Court against seven of her\n\nPartners: Drs. Bunker, Carrell, Houston, Buchholz, Leighty, Davis, and\n\nClause (“the Physicians”). (CR.4). Strandhagen’s sole cause of action was a\n\ndeclaratory judgment claim. (CR.40). She sought declarations that:\n\n\n\n\n                                     9\n\f     (1)   she was terminated without cause, meaning the liquidated\n           damages provision is inapplicable to her; and\n\n     (2)   the liquidated damages provision is an unenforceable\n           penalty because:\n\n           (a)   the resulting harm from Strandhagen’s early\n                 termination was not incapable or difficult of\n                 estimation,\n\n           (b)   the liquidated damages amount is not a reasonable\n                 forecast of just compensation, and\n\n           (c)   it purports to render her liable to the Physicians for\n                 a breach of her Employment Agreement to which\n                 they are not parties or third-party beneficiaries.\n\n(CR.40-41).\n\n\nIV. THE DISTRICT COURT DISMISSED PART AND GRANTED\n    PART OF THE DECLARATORY RELIEF STRANDHAGEN\n    SOUGHT AGAINST THE PHYSICIANS.\n\n     The Physicians filed a Plea to the Jurisdiction seeking dismissal of\n\nboth grounds of Strandhagen’s declaratory judgment claim. (CR.70, 77).\n\nThe Physicians argued: (1) Strandhagen’s request to declare whether or not\n\nshe was terminated for cause duplicated the primary issue pending before\n\nthe TWC/EEOC, and she was required to exhaust her administrative\n\nremedies first; and (2) Strandhagen’s challenge to the liquidated damages\n\nprovision was not ripe because the Physicians had not made any demand\n\nnor sued her to collect such damages. (CR.79-80). The district court (the\n\n\n\n                                    10\n\fHonorable Steven Yelenosky presiding) granted the first argument, thereby\n\ndismissing ground (1) of Strandhagen’s declaratory judgment claim, and\n\ndenied the second, maintaining jurisdiction over ground (2) of\n\nStrandhagen’s claim. (CR.184). Strandhagen does not appeal the dismissal\n\nof ground (1) of her claim.\n\n      Strandhagen then moved for a traditional summary judgment\n\ngranting ground (2) of her claim.         In so doing, she abandoned her\n\ncontention that (a) the resulting damages would be incapable or difficult of\n\nestimation, instead arguing only that the liquidated damages provision was\n\nunenforceable as a matter of law because (b) the amount to be paid was not\n\na reasonable forecast of just compensation, and (c) the Physicians were not\n\nthird-party beneficiaries of her Employment Agreement. (CR.154, 196).\n\nFollowing the Physicians’ Response, further briefing by both parties, and a\n\nhearing, the district court (the Honorable Orlinda Naranjo presiding)\n\ngranted Strandhagen’s motion.      (CR.186-212).   Without specifying any\n\ngrounds, the Court “declare[d] that the $500,000 purported liquidated\n\ndamages clause in the . . . Operations Agreement is an unenforceable\n\npenalty,” and denied all other relief not expressly granted. (CR.212). This\n\nresulted in a final judgment. (CR.212).\n\n\n\n\n                                     11\n\f      The Physicians filed a Motion for New Trial urging several reasons\n\nwhy the grant of summary judgment was improper, as argued below.\n\n(CR.213-250). The Court denied the motion following a hearing on its\n\nmerits. (CR.271; RR.1-29). The Physicians appealed. (CR.272-78).\n\n\n                  SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n      This Court must decide whether to uphold the plain language of a\n\ncontract that was mutually-agreed to by parties of equal sophistication or,\n\ninstead, allow one of those parties (Strandhagen) to secure a premature\n\navoidance of the contractual liability provision before any actual dispute\n\nhas arisen and without sufficient evidence to support her request.     The\n\ndistrict court improperly refused to enforce the parties’ contract and\n\ngranted Strandhagen advisory relief.     This Court should reverse those\n\nerrors.\n\n      The first issue is whether the district court erred in granting\n\nStrandhagen a traditional summary-judgment when she failed to satisfy her\n\nburden of conclusively proving each element of her affirmative defense that\n\nthe liquidated damages provision in the parties’ Operations Agreement is\n\nan unenforceable penalty. The answer is yes. The summary-judgment\n\norder should be reversed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    12\n\f      Strandhagen failed to establish the two essential elements of her\n\nclaim.   She unequivocally abandoned the first element (that damages\n\nresulting from her breach would be difficult to estimate), and she failed to\n\noffer conclusive proof of the second element (that the liquidated amount\n\nwas an unreasonable forecast of the actual damages). In regard to the\n\nlatter, Strandhagen (a) offered no evidence of the actual damages to\n\nestablish an unreasonable disparity; (b) her contentions ignore the plain\n\nlanguage of the contract; and (c) in any event, a fact issue exists about\n\nwhether the court should modify the liquidated amount rather than strike it\n\nall together.\n\n      Strandhagen also failed to establish that it was necessary for the\n\nPhysicians to be third-party beneficiaries of her Employment Agreement to\n\nenforce the liquidated damages provision under their own Operations\n\nAgreement. Even had such status been required, Strandhagen did not\n\nsatisfy her summary-judgment burden of conclusively negating its\n\nexistence.\n\n      The second issue is whether the district court erred in denying the\n\nportion of the Physicians’ Plea to the Jurisdiction arguing that\n\nStrandhagen’s declaratory judgment claim was unripe. Again, the answer is\n\nyes. The partial denial of the Plea should be reversed. This presents an\n\n\n\n                                     13\n\falternative basis to reverse the summary judgment because such relief\n\nshould not have been granted in the absence of jurisdiction. Strandhagen’s\n\nclaim misuses the Declaratory Judgment Act by seeking an advance ruling\n\non a potential affirmative defense to a dispute that has not yet (and may\n\nnever) come to exist. As such, the district court’s grant of a declaration in\n\nher favor was advisory and improper.\n\n\n                               ARGUMENT\n        In two issues, the Physicians respectfully request that this Court\n\nreverse the district court’s (1) grant of Strandhagen’s traditional Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment on her declaratory judgment claim, and (2) partial\n\ndenial of the Physician’s Amended Plea to the Jurisdiction. If the latter is\n\nreversed, then a judgment dismissing Strandhagen’s claims should be\n\nrendered in favor of the Physicians.       See Texas Dept. of Crim. Justice-\n\nCmty. Justice Assistance Div. v. Campos, 384 S.W.3d 810, 812 (Tex. 2012).\n\nOtherwise, the case should be remanded for further proceedings. Tex. R.\n\nApp. P. 43.2, 43.3.\n\n\n   I.     THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED BY GRANTING\n          STRANDHAGEN’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT.\n\n        Strandhagen’s Motion for Summary Judgment should have been\n\ndenied because she failed to conclusively establish (1) the essential\n\n\n                                      14\n\felements of her claim and (2) that the status of the Physicians as third-\n\nparty beneficiaries to her Employment Agreement had any impact on the\n\nenforceability of the liquidated damages provision. In any event, as argued\n\nunder Issue 2, the court erred in granting summary judgment on a\n\nhypothetical (unripe) question because it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction\n\nto do so.\n\n      A.    Summary Judgment Standard of Review.\n      This Court reviews the grant of summary judgment de novo. Valence\n\nOperating Co. v. Dorsett, 164 S.W.3d 656, 661 (Tex. 2005). Appellate\n\ncourts “review the evidence presented in the motion and the response in the\n\nlight most favorable to the party against whom the summary judgment was\n\nrendered, crediting evidence favorable to that party if reasonable jurors\n\ncould, and disregarding contrary evidence unless reasonable jurors could\n\nnot.” Thomas v. Graham Mortg. Corp., 408 S.W.3d 581, 588 (Tex. App.—\n\nAustin 2013, pet. denied). “A movant is entitled to traditional summary\n\njudgment if (1) there are no genuine issues as to any material fact and (2)\n\nthe moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Id. (citing Tex.\n\nR. Civ. P. 166a(c)).\n\n\n\n\n                                      15\n\f      B.    Strandhagen Failed to Satisfy her Summary-Judgment\n            Burden on the Essential Elements of her Claim.\n      Strandhagen moved for a traditional summary judgment declaring\n\nthat the liquidated damages provision in the Operations Agreement is an\n\nunenforceable penalty. (CR.154). “The term ‘liquidated damages’ ordinarily\n\nrefers to an acceptable measure of damages that parties stipulate in\n\nadvance will be assessed in the event of a contract breach.” Flores v.\n\nMillennium Interests, Ltd., 185 S.W.3d 427, 431 (Tex. 2005).\n\n      Although Strandhagen was the plaintiff, her declaratory judgment\n\nclaim—which was filed preemptively in attempt to avoid potential liability\n\nunder the liquidated damages provision—was in the nature of an\n\naffirmative defense. “Whether a contractual provision is an unenforceable\n\npenalty and not a liquidated damage clause is an affirmative defense.” GPA\n\nHolding, Inc. v. Baylor Health Care Sys., 344 S.W.3d 467, 471 (Tex. App.—\n\nDallas 2011, pet. denied) (citing Tex. R. Civ. P. 94; Phillips v. Phillips, 820\n\nS.W.2d 785, 789 (Tex. 1991)); Khan v. Meknojiya, No. 03-11-00580-CV,\n\n2013 WL 3336874, *2 (Tex. App.—Austin June 28, 2013, no pet.) (same).\n\nWhen a movant seeks a traditional summary judgment on an affirmative\n\ndefense, the movant carries the burden of demonstrating her entitlement to\n\njudgment as a matter of law by conclusively proving each element of the\n\naffirmative defense. Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Lenk, 361 S.W.3d 602,\n\n\n                                      16\n\f609 (Tex. 2012); Landry's Seafood Restaurants, Inc. v. Waterfront Cafe,\n\nInc., 49 S.W.3d 544, 547 (Tex. App.—Austin 2001, pet. dism’d).\n\n      Strandhagen agrees that she bore the burden of proof on her\n\naffirmative defense of penalty. (CR.195-196, 262). Strandhagen and the\n\nPhysicians disagree, however, about which elements she was required to\n\nprove to be entitled to summary judgment. The Physicians argue she had\n\nto prove two elements, while Strandhagen claims she had to prove only one\n\nor the other. (CR.188-189, 196, 262).\n\n      Although the Texas Supreme Court has not definitively answered this\n\nlegal question, several intermediate courts—including this one—have\n\nreached the conclusion urged by the Physicians. See infra. In any event,\n\nbecause Strandhagen failed to conclusively prove both elements, the orders\n\ngranting her summary judgment and denying the Physicians’ Motion for\n\nNew Trial should be reversed. (RR.14).\n\n\n           1.    Strandhagen was required              to   conclusively\n                 establish two elements.\n\n      The most on point opinion is GPA Holding, 344 S.W.3d at 476. Like\n\nStrandhagen, GPA moved for summary judgment urging that the liquidated\n\ndamages clause in its contract with Baylor was an unenforceable penalty.\n\nId.   The Dallas Court held that, “[t]o obtain summary judgment on the\n\n\n\n                                    17\n\faffirmative defense of penalty, GPA [as the party seeking to avoid\n\nenforcement of the provision] must prove each element of the defense.”\n\nId. (emphasis added). GPA’s required elements were that: (1) the harm\n\nresulting from a breach was not incapable or difficult of estimation, and (2)\n\nthe amount of liquidated damages provided by the contract was not a\n\nreasonable forecast of actual damages. Id.; see also Baker v. Int’l Record\n\nSyndicate, Inc., 812 S.W.2d 53, 55 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1991, no writ)\n\n(“Evidence related to the difficulty of estimation and the reasonable\n\nforecast must be viewed as of the time the contract was executed.”).\n\n     “The difficulty (or lack of difficulty) in estimation as well as\n\nthe unreasonableness of the damages estimate were GPA’s to\n\nprove. General statements about a ‘more reasonable’ or ‘modest’ rate are\n\nnot evidence that the harm from late payment is difficult to estimate, or\n\nthat the normal billed charges were an unreasonable forecast of the loss\n\nactually sustained.” GPA Holding, 344 S.W.3d at 476 (emphasis added).\n\n“Because GPA did not meet its burden of establishing that the clause . . .\n\nwas an unenforceable penalty,” the trial judge did not err in denying GPA’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment on this issue.” Id.\n\n     This Court reached the same conclusion following a jury trial in\n\nSouthern Union Co. v. CSG Systems, Inc., No. 03-04-00172-CV, 2005 WL\n\n\n\n                                     18\n\f171349, *4 (Tex. App.—Austin Jan. 27, 2005, no pet.). Southern Union\n\nargued that the damages provision was an unenforceable penalty. Id. This\n\nCourt held that “[t]he party challenging the award of liquidated damages\n\nhas the burden to establish that the two-prong test is not satisfied\n\nand that, instead, the award of liquidated damages is an unenforceable\n\npenalty.” Id. at *4 (emphasis added). The Court then discussed whether\n\nSouthern Union satisfied the “first part of its burden” regarding “difficulty\n\nof estimation” and the “second part of its burden” regarding “reasonable\n\nforecast of just compensation.” Id. at *4-6. Concluding that Southern\n\nUnion failed to prove either essential element, the Court affirmed the award\n\nof liquidated damages, subject to a partial remittitur on another issue. Id.\n\nat *7-8.\n\n      More recently, in Khan v. Meknojiya, 2013 WL 3336874 at *2,\n\nMekonjiya moved for summary judgment on the affirmative defense of\n\npenalty. In considering whether the district court properly denied that\n\nmotion, this Court stated that, “to be entitled to summary judgment,\n\nMeknojiya had to conclusively establish every element of this defense,”\n\nand then set forth the two elements regarding (1) incapable or difficult of\n\nestimation, and (2) reasonable forecast of compensation.         Id. at *2-3\n\n\n\n\n                                     19\n\f(emphasis added) (ultimately holding that the provision was not one for\n\nliquidated damages and thus the penalty analysis was inapplicable).\n\n      The Eastland Court of Appeals also held that a party seeking to avoid\n\nenforcement of a liquidated damages provision on summary judgment\n\nmust prove both elements of the penalty affirmative defense.          Healix\n\nInfusion Therapy, Inc. v. Bellos, No. 11-02-00346-CV, 2003 WL 22411873,\n\n*2 (Tex. App.—Eastland Oct. 23, 2003, no pet.). The Court held that “the\n\nburden Healix [as the party claiming penalty] must bear [is] that at the time\n\nthe agreement was made damages could be easily ascertained and that the\n\namount of the liquidated damages award was not a reasonable forecast of\n\njust compensation.” Id. (emphasis added). Healix’s contention “that the\n\naward of liquidated damages is disproportionate to actual damages” was\n\ninsufficient on its own. Id. “Healix still must show that, at the time the\n\nagreement was made, the amount of the liquidated damages was not a\n\nreasonable forecast.” Id. “Healix failed to meet his burden of proof on the\n\npenalty issue.” Id. at *3.\n\n       Other courts have reached similar conclusions. See Triton 88, LP v.\n\nStar Electricity, LLC, 411 S.W.3d 42, 62 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n\n2013, no pet.) (favorably citing GPA Holding and concluding “Triton failed\n\nto raise a fact question on its claim that the . . . clause constituted an\n\n\n\n                                     20\n\fimpermissible penalty,” where Triton “did not present any evidence\n\nregarding the parties’ ability to estimate actual damages . . . or what a\n\nreasonable forecast of damages would have been at the time the contract\n\nwas formed.”); Murphy v. Cintas Corp., 923 S.W.2d 663, 666 (Tex. App.—\n\nTyler 1996, writ denied) (“For the provision to be an unenforceable penalty,\n\nthe uncertainty of the damages and the reasonableness of the stipulation\n\nmust have existed at the time when the contract was executed.” Where\n\nneither element was proven, the clause was held enforceable.) (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n     The Physicians acknowledge that contrary authority exists in which\n\ncourts have not required proof of both elements before concluding the\n\nprovision to be a penalty. See, e.g., Nexstar Broad., Inc. v. Gray, No. 09-\n\n07-00364-CV, 2008 WL 2521967 (Tex. App.—Beaumont 2008, no pet.)\n\n(holding liquidated damages provision to be an unenforceable penalty\n\nbecause it was an unreasonable forecast of just compensation without\n\ndiscussion of the difficulty of estimation element); (RR.9-10).\n\n     However—given the black-letter law that a movant seeking traditional\n\nsummary judgment on its affirmative defense is required to prove every\n\nelement of its defense, coupled with prior holdings of this Court (Southern\n\nUnion and Kahn) and the case most on point (GPA Holdings) requiring\n\n\n\n                                     21\n\fproof of both elements to prevail on the affirmative defense of penalty—the\n\nPhysicians urge this Court to conclude Strandhagen was required to\n\nestablish both elements, and decline to follow opinions to the contrary.\n\nConsequently, this Court should reverse the judgment if it concludes that\n\nStrandhagen failed to conclusively establish either one of the two required\n\nelements that (1) the harm resulting from a breach was not incapable or\n\ndifficult of estimation (i.e., the harm could be easily and accurately\n\nestimated), or (2) the amount of liquidated damages provided by the\n\ncontract was not a reasonable forecast of actual damages (i.e., the\n\nliquidated damages amount was excessive compared to the actual damages\n\nresulting from a breach).\n\n     But even if this Court were to conclude that Strandhagen was\n\nrequired to prove only one element of her affirmative defense, reversal of\n\nthe judgment is still necessitated by the fact that Strandhagen failed to\n\nconclusively prove both of the foregoing elements.\n\n\n           2.    Strandhagen conceded her inability to prove the\n                 “difficulty of estimation” element.\n\n     Strandhagen unequivocally admitted that “[s]he does not seek to\n\nnegate the element concerning the difficulty of estimation . . .; she only\n\nseeks to negate the second element.” (CR.196, 263). The record leaves no\n\n\n\n                                    22\n\fdoubt that Strandhagen failed to carry her burden of proof on this element.\n\nThe summary judgment should be reversed accordingly.\n\n\n           3.    Strandhagen failed to conclusively prove the\n                 “unreasonable forecast” element.\n\n     Strandhagen did not satisfy her summary-judgment burden of\n\nproving that the liquidated damages amount failed to reasonably forecast\n\nactual damages because (a) she offered no evidence to demonstrate what\n\nthe actual damages were or that there was an excessive disproportion\n\nbetween the amounts; (b) to accept her argument, this Court must\n\ndisregard the plain language of the contract; and (c) a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact remains about whether the liquidated damages clause should\n\nbe modified rather than struck as unenforceable.\n\n                 (a)   No evidence of actual damages.\n                       (i)   Texas law requires proof of actual damages.\n\n     Although the question of “[w]hether a contractual provision is an\n\nenforceable liquidated damages provision or an unenforceable penalty is a\n\nquestion of law for the court to decide, [s]ometimes . . . factual issues must\n\nbe resolved before the legal question can be decided.” Phillips v. Phillips,\n\n820 S.W.2d 785, 788 (Tex. 1991). Our supreme court identified a typical\n\nfact issue in connection with the “unreasonable forecast” element arising\n\n\n\n                                     23\n\ffrom the movant’s requirement to “prove what the actual damages were” in\n\ncomparison to “the amount contracted for.” Id. The party claiming the\n\nprovision is a penalty “must prove actual damages, if any, to show that the\n\nactual loss was not an approximation of the stipulated sum.” Healix, 2003\n\nWL 22411873 at *2.\n\n     Where a party fails to offer any evidence of actual damages in\n\ncomparison to the liquidated amount, the court may conclude that the\n\nparty has failed to carry its burden of proof and uphold the liquidated\n\ndamages provision. See e.g., Triton, 411 S.W.3d at 62 (“Triton did not\n\npresent any evidence regarding what a reasonable forecast of damages\n\nwould have been at the time the contract was formed, nor did it present any\n\nevidence of StarTex’s actual damages. Thus, . . . [the] liquidated damages\n\n[clause] provided a reasonable forecast of just compensation.”).\n\n     Additionally, vague averments of “unreasonableness” not supported\n\nby actual evidence will not suffice to establish the defense of penalty. The\n\nmovant cannot meet its burden simply by claiming that the actual damages\n\nare not yet ascertainable and therefore tantamount to “zero.” Healix, 2003\n\nWL 22411873 at *2. And as noted by this Court, a liquidated damages\n\namount awarding two to three times the amount of actual damages is not\n\nper se unreasonable.    Southern Union, 2005 WL 171349 at *6 (citing\n\n\n\n                                     24\n\fSealock v. Texas Fed. Sav. & Loan Assoc., 755 S.W.2d 69, 70 (Tex. 1988)\n\n(“uph[olding] a trial court’s judgment awarding $790,000 in liquidated\n\ndamages, which was twice the $395,000 found as actual damages”); Baker\n\nv. Int’l Record Syndicate, Inc., 812 S.W.2d 53, 56 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1991,\n\nno writ) (“approv[ing] a liquidated damages award of $51,000, which was\n\nmore than triple the $15,000 found as actual damages”).\n\n      In GPA Holding, 344 S.W.3d at 476, the movant “offered evidence\n\ncomparing the discounted rates to the hospital’s normal billed rates for the\n\ncharges at issue,” including an affidavit with an attached chart showing “the\n\npercentage difference between the discounted rate and the normal billed\n\ncharge for each of the charges at issue,” and presented argument about an\n\nalternative damage calculation that the movant contended would be more\n\nreasonable. Even this was not enough. The court held that movant failed\n\nto carry its burden of proof on the “unreasonable forecast” element because\n\nit failed to attach evidence in support of the alternative calculation. Id.\n\n                        (ii)   Strandhagen offered no proof of actual\n                               damages, and her “one size fits all” argument\n                               fails.\n\n      Strandhagen offered no evidence of what the Physicians’ actual\n\ndamages were or would be in the event that they brought a future suit\n\nagainst her for breach of contract nor did she establish any alternative\n\n\n\n                                       25\n\fdamages calculation that she would contend is more reasonable. Instead,\n\nStrandhagen claimed that, as a matter of law, the liquidated damage\n\namount was unreasonable because it was a “one size fits all” provision, i.e.,\n\nthe same amount of damages would be owed regardless of when she\n\nterminated her employment. (CR.157, 197-98, 264). This contention is\n\ninsufficient without any proof of how the liquidated damage amount was\n\ncalculated or what the actual damages were.\n\n      Strandhagen relied on cases holding that a liquidated damages\n\nprovision may be unenforceable if it imposes the same amount of liability\n\nfor breaches that are both trivial and severe. (CR.198). This is not the case\n\nunder the Operations Agreement. Here, the liquidated damages provision\n\napplies to only one form of breach: a Partner’s early departure from the\n\npractice. (CR.167-168). It does not apply, for example, to non-material\n\nbreaches like the Advisory Board’s failure to hold a regular meeting\n\n(CR.163) or its failure to take a written vote upon request (CR.164).\n\n      Strandhagen attempts to transform the time of the breach into a\n\nmeasure of its materiality. But Strandhagen presented no evidence to\n\nestablish that the financial impact on the remaining Partners would be\n\nsubstantially greater or lesser depending on the timing of another Partner’s\n\nearly departure.    As previously discussed, important financial reasons\n\n\n\n                                     26\n\fsupported the Partners’ agreement to be bound by this liquidated damages\n\nclause, including the anticipated impact that one’s early departure would\n\nhave on the practice’s gross profits and the Partners’ abilities to earn annual\n\nbonuses, as well as the resulting loss of experience and goodwill, which\n\ncould not be easily or quickly replaced. Supra, Statement of Facts Section\n\nI.A. These financial considerations could be the same whether Strandhagen\n\nquit on day 1 or day 1,000.      Strandhagen offered no evidence to prove\n\notherwise.   Instead, she simply claimed that “the consequences of Dr.\n\nStrandhagen’s employment terminating obviously varies over time.”\n\n(CR.157). This unsupported allegation does not suffice to meet her burden.\n\n      Strandhagen’s “one size fits all” contention also fails in light of the\n\nseveral exceptions to the liquidated damages provision.         (CR.167-169).\n\nSeveral types of “early departures” were carved out from application off the\n\nprovision. These exceptions eliminate the imposition of any liability for\n\nearly termination scenarios that would not constitute a material breach of\n\nthe contract (such as early termination based on disability or with\n\npermission by the majority). Hence, the clause was narrowly drafted, not\n\nan unenforceable “one size fits all” provision.\n\n      Moreover, relevant legal authorities are contrary to Strandhagen’s\n\ncontention. The fact that a liquidated damages provision awards a uniform\n\n\n\n                                      27\n\famount for the breach of a term agreement regardless of the date of the\n\nbreach is not per se unreasonable. In Murphy v. Cintas Corp., 923 S.W.2d\n\n663, 666 (Tex. App.—Tyler 1996, writ denied), Murphy claimed that the\n\nliquidated damages provision was an unenforceable penalty because it\n\nimposed the same amount of damages for early cancellation of the parties’\n\nagreement whether it resulted from his failure to pay for one of the\n\ncontemplated goods (at the end of the contract’s term) or all of them (at the\n\nbeginning).   Id.   The court rejected this argument and enforced the\n\nprovision. Id. at 666-667.\n\n     The Restatement of Contracts regarding liquidated damages is\n\nconsistent with Murphy. See RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 356,\n\nLiquidated Damages and Penalties (1981).           Comment (b), “Test of\n\nPenalty,” states that a liquidated damages amount “is reasonable to the\n\nextent that it approximates the actual loss that has resulted from the\n\nparticular breach, even though it may not approximate the loss that might\n\nhave been anticipated under other possible breaches.”         Id. (emphasis\n\nadded). Thus, this Court needs to determine only whether Strandhagen\n\nconclusively established that the liquidated amount was an unreasonable\n\nforecast of the actual damages resulting from this particular breach (her\n\n\n\n\n                                     28\n\ffive-year premature departure from the practice). Strandhagen offered no\n\nprove to establish this element.\n\n      According to Restatement Section 356, whether the liquidated\n\namount reasonably forecast other breaches that may have occurred is not a\n\nbasis to deny the provision’s enforceability in this case.       Id.   This is\n\nconfirmed by Illustration 2 to Section 356. In that example, partners A, B,\n\nand C formed a veterinary practice promising to remain as a partnership for\n\nten years. Id. The liquidated damages clause provided that, if one partner\n\nterminated early (and the others continued the business), and the\n\nterminating partner breached his duty of non-competition, he would be\n\nliable for $50,000. This provision is enforceable because “[e]ven though\n\n$50,000 may be unreasonable in relation to the loss that may have resulted\n\nin other circumstances, it is not unreasonable in relation to the actual loss.”\n\nId.\n\n      In the absence of any evidence from Strandhagen to support her\n\nclaim that the liquidated damages amount was not a reasonable forecast of\n\njust compensation—and especially considering that all inferences must be\n\nconstrued in favor of the Physicians as nonmovants—the record fails to\n\nconclusively demonstrate that Strandhagen satisfied her burden of proof on\n\n\n\n\n                                      29\n\fthis element. This Court should reject Strandhagen’s facial challenge just\n\nas the court did in Murphy, 923 S.W.2d at 666.\n\n                   (b)   Plain language of contract shows reasonable\n                         forecast.\n      Beyond the lack of evidence in support of Strandhagen’s contention\n\nthat the liquidated damages amount was an unreasonable forecast of the\n\nactual damages, the plain language of the parties’ contract demonstrates\n\nthat it was not.    The Court would be required to disregard or render\n\nmeaningless certain portions of the contract to accept Strandhagen’s\n\nargument.\n\n      In determining whether Strandhagen has satisfied her burden on the\n\naffirmative defense of penalty, this Court must keep in mind the basic rules\n\nof contract construction, as recognized in GPA Holding, 344 S.W.3d at 471.\n\n“The court’s primary concern in interpreting a written contract is to\n\ndetermine the mutual intent of the parties as manifested in the contract, . . .\n\nand the agreement must be enforced as written.” Id. Terms should be given\n\ntheir plain and ordinary meaning, and interpretations that render any\n\nportion meaningless should be avoided. Id.\n\n      This Court considered the plain language of the contract as a basis for\n\nrejecting a penalty defense and enforcing a liquidated damages provision in\n\nSouthern Union Co. v. CSG Systems, Inc., No. 03-04-00712CV, 2005 WL\n\n                                      30\n\f171349, *4-6 (Tex. App.—Austin Jan. 27, 2005, no pet.). There, the contract\n\nstated that the damages provision was included “[b]ecause of the difficulty\n\nin ascertaining CSG’s actual damages for a termination or other breach of\n\nthe Agreement,” and that “CSG would have been unwilling to provide the\n\nServices at the fees set forth in the Agreement” had Southern Union not\n\npromised “certainty of revenue” by obligating itself to pay the\n\ndiscontinuance fee in the event that it breached the contract.” Id. at *4.\n\nThe damages provision also “expressly state[d] that it ‘is not a penalty’ and\n\nthat it ‘is a reasonable estimation of the actual damages which CSG would\n\nsuffer if CSG were to fail to receive the amount of processing business as\n\ncontemplated by this Agreement.’” Id. at *6. The Court clarified that,\n\n“[a]lthough parties cannot avoid a challenge to a liquidated damages\n\nprovision simply by characterizing it as ‘reasonable,’ such express language\n\nis instructive of the parties’ intent when the terms are mutually bargained\n\nfor between equally competent parties.” Id.\n\n     This Court also put weight on the fact that the “provision was a\n\nbargained-for exchange, negotiated and approved by both companies.” Id.\n\n“When a provision is mutually bargained for by equally competent parties,\n\nwe give deference to its enforcement. . . . From the face of the contract,\n\nSouthern Union understood at the time it entered the agreement that CSG’s\n\n\n\n                                     31\n\fdamages would be difficult to estimate and therefore agreed a liquidated\n\ndamages provision was necessary.” Id.\n\n     Much like the Southern Union/CSG contract, the Operations\n\nAgreement between Strandhagen and her Partners expressly stated that the\n\nstipulated amount was to be paid “as liquidated damages, and not as a\n\npenalty,” and that the amount was “reasonable in light of the anticipated\n\nharm which would be caused by a Terminating Physician’s breach or\n\ndefault under this Agreement.”      (CR.168).   Additionally, the Partners\n\nagreed that the contract’s provisions were “narrowly tailored and necessary\n\nto protect the Physicians’ legitimate interests as a group,” and that they\n\nconstituted a “significant inducement to [the Partners] entering into the\n\nPurchase Agreement, and consummating the transaction contemplated\n\nthereby.” (CR.162).\n\n     Also like the Southern Union/CSG contract, Strandhagen and her\n\nPartners were mutually competent parties who voluntarily and knowingly\n\nentered this bargained-for exchange. (CR.162, 173-178). Hence, this Court\n\nshould defer to the plain language of the Operations Agreement, which\n\nevidences the parties’ mutual intent for the liquidated damages provision to\n\nbe valid and enforceable, and not construed as a penalty. To do otherwise\n\nwould impermissibly render meaningless the express provisions of the\n\n\n\n                                    32\n\fcontract stating that the damages provision was reasonable, narrowly-\n\ntailored, a necessary inducement, and not a penalty.\n\n                    (c)   Fact issue exists regarding modification.\n      Finally, to any extent the Court believes Strandhagen offered proof\n\nthat the damages provision was not a reasonable forecast of actual\n\ndamages, she has still failed to conclusively establish this element of her\n\ndefense because the “Severability” clause in the parties’ contract creates a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact.\n\n      Section 7(f) of the Operations Agreement provides:\n\n               Severability. . . . In the event that any provision of\n               this Agreement shall be declared by a Court of\n               competent jurisdiction to exceed the limits such\n               court deems reasonable and enforceable, said\n               provisions shall be deemed modified to the\n               minimum extent necessary to make such\n               provisions reasonable and enforceable.\n\n(CR.171) (emphasis added).\n\n      “An illegal or unconscionable provision of a contract may generally\n\nbe severed so long as it does not constitute the essential purpose of the\n\nagreement.” In re Poly-Am., L.P., 262 S.W.3d 337, 357, 360 (Tex. 2008)\n\n(recognizing that, pursuant to the parties’ contract, the arbitrator “would be\n\nfree to modify” terms found to be unconscionable rather than striking them\n\naltogether).     Severability is determined by the intent of the parties as\n\n\n\n                                        33\n\fevidenced by the language of the contract. In re Kasschau, 11 S.W.3d 305,\n\n313 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1999, orig. proceeding).\n\n      Here, the liquidated amount could be modified in a narrow fashion\n\nwithout undermining the essential purpose of the parties’ contract. The\n\nexpress purpose of the Operations Agreement was to “establish an Advisory\n\nBoard and set forth certain understandings and agreements among\n\nthemselves regarding the operations of their practice.”        (CR.162).    The\n\nspecific amount of liquidated damages applicable to any particular\n\nphysician was not the “essential purpose” of the Agreement.\n\n      In light of the Severability clause, the district court erred by declaring\n\nthe liquidated damages provision wholly unenforceable as a matter of law.\n\nEven if the court considered $500,000 to be an unreasonable liquidated\n\namount, the court should have concluded that a genuine issue of material\n\nfact exists about what modified amount or calculation would be reasonable\n\nto enforce in its place, keeping with the parties’ express intent to modify the\n\nterm “to the minimum extent necessary.”          To do otherwise, the Court\n\nwould have to impermissibly rewrite the parties’ bargained-for exchange to\n\nstrike out the final sentence of Paragraph 7(f), which is a mandatory\n\nprovision voluntarily agreed to by the parties. Alternatively, if this Court\n\n\n\n\n                                      34\n\fconcludes the Severability clause is ambiguous, then it creates a genuine\n\nissue of material fact requiring reversal and remand. (RR.12-14, 22-23).\n\n     C.    Strandhagen Failed to Satisfy her Summary-Judgment\n           Burden Regarding the Physicians’ Status as Third-\n           Party Beneficiaries.\n\n     Strandhagen also moved for summary judgment based on her\n\nargument that the liquidated damages provision is unenforceable because it\n\nseeks to render her liable to the Physicians for a breach of her Employment\n\nAgreement, to which the Physicians are not parties or third-party\n\nbeneficiaries. (CR.157-158). This did not provide a valid basis for summary\n\njudgment because (1) Strandhagen’s liability for liquidated damages arises\n\ndirectly from the Operations Agreement between her and her Physician\n\nPartners, and does not require that the Physicians be third-party\n\nbeneficiaries of her Employment Agreement; and/or (2) Strandhagen failed\n\nto conclusively establish that the Physicians were not third-party\n\nbeneficiaries of the Employment Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n                                    35\n\f           1.    The Operations Agreement Provides a Direct Line\n                 of Liability.\n\n     Paragraph 5 of the Operations Agreement provides:\n\n           [I]f [any Partner] terminates his or her employment\n           with the Company prior to the expiration of the\n           Initial Term, the Physicians may suffer harm [as\n           specified therein]. . . . In light of the foregoing, if a\n           [Partner’s] employment with the Company is\n           terminated for any reason during the Initial Term .\n           . . other than a termination without cause . . . then\n           such [Terminating Partner] shall promptly pay . . .\n           as liquidated damages and not as a penalty . . . the\n           amount set forth below.\n\n\n(CR.167-168).\n\n     This provision creates a direct line of liability for liquidated damages\n\nbetween an early-terminating physician and her remaining Partners based\n\non the direct harm that will be suffered by the remaining Partners as a\n\nresult of the early termination. (Id.). Under this provision, there is no need\n\nfor the Physicians to be third-party beneficiaries of the Employment\n\nAgreement to enforce the liquidated damages clause.         The Physicians (if\n\nthey sued Strandhagen for breach of contract) would not be attempting to\n\nrecover under the Employment Agreement as third-party beneficiaries.\n\nRather, they would be seeking and are entitled to directly enforce the\n\nliability provisions contained within the four corners of their own contract\n\nwith Strandhagen. (RR.10-11).\n\n\n                                      36\n\f            2.    A Genuine Issue of Material Fact Remains about\n                  the Physicians’ Third-Party Beneficiary Status.\n\n      Alternatively, even if the Court were to conclude that the Physicians\n\nare required to be third-party beneficiaries of Strandhagen’s Employment\n\nAgreement to enforce the liquidated damages clause under the Operations\n\nAgreement, it was error to grant summary-judgment on this ground\n\nbecause Strandhagen did not conclusively establish the absence of such\n\nthird-party beneficiary status.\n\n      Strandhagen’s Motion for Summary Judgment states in a single,\n\nconclusory sentence that the Physicians “are [not] third-party beneficiaries”\n\nto the Employment Agreement.         (CR.158).   She did not provide any\n\nevidence or analysis about the intention of the Employer or herself (or any\n\nof the other Partners) when entering their Employment Agreements, nor\n\nabout the meaning of the contract as a whole. Strandhagen failed to satisfy\n\nher traditional summary-judgment burden on this ground. See Alvarado v.\n\nLexington Ins. Co., 389 S.W.3d 544, 564 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n\n2012, no pet.) (“It was Lexington’s burden, as movant for summary\n\njudgment, to prove its entitlement to summary judgment against Alvarado\n\nas a matter of law. We hold that Lexington failed to carry its burden of\n\nconclusively negating Alvarado’s status as a third-party beneficiary to the\n\n\n\n\n                                     37\n\fPolicy. Thus, we hold that the trial court erred in rendering summary\n\njudgment in favor of Lexington.”).\n\n\n   II.     THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED BY DENYING PART OF THE\n           PHYSICIANS’ PLEA TO THE JURISDICTION.\n\n      The Physicians’ Amended Plea to the Jurisdiction argued, in part, that\n\nStrandhagen’s request for a declaration that the liquidated damages\n\nprovision was an unenforceable penalty was not yet ripe for decision\n\nbecause the Physicians had not yet decided whether to sue her for breach of\n\ncontract, much less made a demand or filed suit on that basis. (CR.79-80).\n\nIn the absence of a live, justiciable controversy, the court lacked subject-\n\nmatter jurisdiction over Strandhagen’s claim. (CR.79-80). On this basis,\n\nthe district court erred by denying this portion of the Physician’s Plea and\n\nby granting an advisory summary judgment on Strandhagen’s unripe\n\ndeclaratory judgment claim, and by denying the opportunity to correct this\n\nerror in response to the Motion for New Trial. (CR.184-85, 212, 271). This\n\nCourt should reverse these decisions and render judgment dismissing\n\nStrandhagen’s claims for a lack of jurisdiction.\n\n      A.     Texas Law Prohibits Advisory Declarations                   on\n             Potential Defenses to Hypothetical Disputes.\n\n      In an action for declaratory relief, a plaintiff must allege facts that\n\naffirmatively demonstrate that the trial court has subject matter\n\n                                      38\n\fjurisdiction.

App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2006, pet. denied). “A request for declaratory relief\n\nalone does not establish jurisdiction in [the] Court. . . . [It is] merely a\n\nprocedural device for deciding cases already within a court’s jurisdiction.”\n\nChenault v. Phillips, 914 S.W.2d 140, 141 (Tex. 1996).\n\n     For a court to have jurisdiction to consider a declaratory-judgment\n\naction, there must be a “justiciable controversy as to the rights and status\n\nof” the parties, and the requested declaration “must actually resolve the\n\ncontroversy.” Brooks v. Northglen Ass’n, 141 S.W.3d 158, 163-64 (Tex.\n\n2004). “A justiciable controversy is one in which a real and substantial\n\ncontroversy exists involving a genuine conflict of tangible interests and not\n\nmerely a theoretical dispute.” Texas Dep’t of Pub.

There must be some\n\nshowing that litigation is imminent between the parties unless the\n\n\n\n                                     39\n\fcontractual uncertainties are judicially resolved.” Paulsen v.

(holding the court lacked jurisdiction to issue a premature\n\ndeclaration regarding validity of contractual guarantee).\n\n      In Nexstar Broad., Inc. v. Gray, No. 09-07-00364-CV, 2008 WL\n\n2521967, *2 (Tex. App.—Beaumont June 26, 2008, no pet.), the court held\n\nthat it was an improper use of the DJA for a party with potential liability\n\n\n\n                                     41\n\funder a contract to seek a declaration that simply restated the “penalty”\n\naffirmative defense and sought no relief beyond what that defense would\n\nafford (i.e., avoidance of liquidated damages). This holding was based, in\n\npart, on the fact that the parties had no ongoing relationship—as contrasted\n\nfrom declarations in other cases that would settle future disputes of an\n\nongoing relationship between the parties. Id. (citing BHP Petro. Co. v.\n\nMillard, 800 S.W.2d 838, 841-842 (Tex. 1990)).\n\n      Similarly, this Court held in LHR Enterprises that the district court\n\nlacked jurisdiction to declare the meaning of the Insurance Commission’s\n\nconclusion that it “may impose an administrative penalty” in certain\n\ncircumstances where there was no pending or impending action to seek\n\nsuch a remedy from plaintiff. 2007 WL 3306492 at *5; see also State v.\n\nMargolis, 439 S.W.2d 695, 697-98 (Tex. Civ. App.—Austin 1969, writ ref’d\n\nn.r.e.) (where plaintiff merely alleged, without any supporting proof, that\n\ndefendant had “indicated an intention” to seek statutory penalty against\n\nplaintiff, and defendant denied that allegation in its pleadings, there was no\n\nevidence that a bona fide controversy existed giving rise to any justiciable\n\nissues between the parties; hence, declaratory judgment was improper).7\n\n\n7      LHR Enterprises and Margolis involved statutory penalties available to the State\nin specified circumstances. While the cases are procedurally similar to the instant case\nin that they presented un-ripe claims for declaratory relief related to the enforcement of\nthese remedies prior to a pending demand for their recovery, they are substantively\n\n\n                                           42\n\f      B.     Strandhagen’s Claim Is Not Ripe.\n\n      The    declaration    sought    by      Strandhagen    merely    presents    a\n\nhypothetical or contingent question about what damages may be available\n\nif the Physicians were to pursue a claim against her in the future for breach\n\nof contract. Strandhagen only speculated that she has “learned . . . [the\n\nPhysicians] and perhaps others are seeking to pursue her for collection,”\n\nbut she failed to offer any proof that a live, justiciable controversy actually\n\nexisted. (CR.8, 112). The Physicians generally denied all of Strandhagen’s\n\nallegations, specifically pled that her claim has not matured, and moved for\n\ndismissal based on their specific contention to the contrary. (CR.74-75, 79).\n\nA potential breach of contract suit against Strandhagen is not a certain,\n\nimminent, or unavoidable controversy.             At best, it is hypothetical or\n\ncontingent on other events. Hence, there is not a sufficiently ripe dispute\n\nbetween these parties about which declaratory relief may be appropriately\n\ngranted. Strandhagen’s attempt to misuse the Declaratory Judgment Act to\n\nobtain an advance ruling on her affirmative defense should be dismissed.\n\n\n\n\ndistinct in that they involved “penalties” rather than a liquidated damages clause as\nhere.\n\n\n                                         43\n\f                                  PRAYER\n      Based on the foregoing, Appellants respectfully pray that this Court\n\nsustain both of their issues on appeal and reverse the district court’s grant\n\nof Strandhagen’s Motion for Summary Judgment, its partial denial of the\n\nPhysicians’ Plea to the Jurisdiction, and its denial of the Physicians’ Motion\n\nfor New Trial. If the jurisdictional ruling is reversed, then this Court should\n\nrender judgment in favor of the Physicians dismissing Strandhagen’s claim\n\nin its entirety. Otherwise, this Court should remand to the district court for\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n      Appellants further pray that this Court tax all costs against\n\nStrandhagen, both in this Court and below, and award the Appellants any\n\nsuch other relief at law or equity to which they may be justly entitled.

KEYES, Justice.\n\nAppellee, Lexington Insurance Company (“Lexington”), moved for rehearing of our April 19,\n2012 opinion. We grant the motion for rehearing, withdraw our April 19, 2012 opinion and\njudgment, and issue this opinion and judgment in their stead. Our disposition remains the same.\nWe dismiss Lexington's May 21, 2012 motion for en banc reconsideration as moot. 1\n\nAppellant, Javier Alvarado, sued Lexington for breach of contract, breach of the duty of good faith\nand fair dealing, and violations of the Texas Insurance Code and the Deceptive Trade Practices Act\n(“DTPA”) after Lexington rejected Alvarado's claim for property damage following Hurricane Ike.\nThe trial court rendered summary judgment in favor of Lexington. In one issue, Alvarado contends\nthat the trial court erred in rendering summary judgment because Lexington did not conclusively\nnegate Alvarado's status as a third-party beneficiary under the “force-placed” insurance policy\nissued by Lexington to Alvarado's mortgage lender.\n\nWe reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n                                                  Background\n\nBefore May 2008, Alvarado maintained homeowner's insurance on his property with Columbia\nLloyds. Alvarado testified by affidavit that when he refinanced his mortgage in May 2008 with\nFlagstar Bank (“Flagstar”), a Flagstar representative informed him that he had to cancel his policy\nwith Columbia Lloyds and that Flagstar would obtain homeowner's insurance on his behalf.\nFlagstar obtained a “force-placed” insurance policy on Alvarado's property with Lexington (“the\nPolicy”). 2 Alvarado's *547 monthly payments to Flagstar included the principal and interest on\nhis mortgage, as well as taxes and the premiums on the Policy.\n\nIn September 2008, Alvarado's property sustained damage as a result of Hurricane Ike. Flagstar\nmade a claim on the Policy, and Lexington paid Flagstar $4,410.49 in damages. According to\nAlvarado's affidavit, Flagstar did not provide any of these funds to Alvarado for the purpose of\nrepairs, and it did not apply these funds to the balance of his mortgage. The application of these\nfunds is not part of the record.\n\nAfter Lexington denied his claim for damages, Alvarado sued Lexington for breach of contract,\nbreach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and various violations of the Texas Insurance\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                2\n\fAlvarado v. Lexington Ins. Co., 389 S.W.3d 544 (2012)\n\n\n\nCode and the DTPA. 3 Alvarado alleged that he was the owner of the Policy and that Lexington\nhad “sold the policy, insuring the property to [Alvarado] or [Alvarado's] predecessors in interest.”\nAmong other allegations, Alvarado argued that Lexington “failed to perform [its] contractual\nduty to adequately compensate [Alvarado] under the terms of the policy” and that Lexington\n“misrepresented to [Alvarado] that the damage to the property was not covered under the policy,\neven though the damage was caused by a covered occurrence.”\n\nLexington moved for traditional summary judgment. It argued that Alvarado could not recover on\nany of his claims because Lexington never entered into a contract with Alvarado; Alvarado was\nneither a named insured nor an additional insured on the Policy; Flagstar obtained the Policy “to\nprotect its interest in the residence for which Flagstar was the mortgagee”; the Policy provided\nthat all payments for damages were to be made solely to Flagstar; and the Policy “expressed no\nintent to benefit [Alvarado] in any way.” Lexington contended that Alvarado did not qualify as a\nthird-party beneficiary of the Policy and that, as a result, no legal relationship existed between it\nand Alvarado and Alvarado lacked standing to bring his claims. 4\n\nAs summary judgment evidence, Lexington attached a copy of the Policy as Exhibit A. Lexington\npointed out that the “Common Policy Declarations” in the Policy provide that “Flagstar Bank,\nFSB” is the “named insured” and that the “Mortgage Guard Property Policy” section further\ndefines “named insured” as “the Lending Institution named on the Declaration Page” and “you”\nas “the Named Insured shown in the Declarations.” It further pointed out that the Policy states,\n“In consideration of the premium to be charged we will (as shown on the Declaration Page)\ninsure ... the Lending Institution (you, as shown on the Declaration Page) against direct physical\nloss resulting from destruction of or damage to your property....” It also pointed to language in the\nPolicy stating that the Policy provides coverage for the dwelling, other structures on the property,\npersonal property, and loss of use “in which the insured has a mortgage and/or owner interest.”\nLexington argued that, although the Policy covers personal property, that coverage is limited to\nthe extent to which Flagstar, as *548 the named insured, has a mortgage or ownership interest\nin the property.\n\nThe Policy also includes the following “Mortgage Clause”:\n\n            Loss, if any, under this policy will be payable to the mortgagee (or trustee) as\n            its interests may appear under all present or future mortgages upon the Covered\n            Property described on the reporting forms in which mortgagee may have an\n            interest as mortgagee (or trustee) in order of precedence of said mortgages.\n\nLexington pointed out that the “Loss Payable” clause provides, “Loss will be adjusted with and\nmade payable to you unless another payee is specifically named.” It observed that this clause does\nnot provide that Alvarado, the borrower, is entitled to proceeds in excess of Flagstar's insurable\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  3\n\fAlvarado v. Lexington Ins. Co., 389 S.W.3d 544 (2012)\n\n\n\ninterest in the property, nor does it allow Alvarado to participate in the claim adjustment process.\nIt emphasized that neither Alvarado nor his property is specifically mentioned in the Policy.\n\nIn response to Lexington's summary judgment motion, Alvarado argued that Endorsement #\n12 to the Policy, entitled “Special Broad Form Homeowners Coverage,” expressly provides\nhomeowners' coverage for homeowners of properties specified on reporting forms referenced by\nthe Policy. He argued that this endorsement directly benefits him and supports his third-party\nbeneficiary status. Alvarado pointed to language in Endorsement # 12 defining “insured” as “[y]ou\nand residents of your household” and defining “insured location” as the “residence premises,”\nwhich is further defined as “[t]he one family dwelling where you reside.” He contended that this\nlanguage refers to him and not to Flagstar, the mortgage company. Alvarado also pointed out\nthat Endorsement # 12 provides coverage for direct physical loss to property, additional living\nexpenses, personal property damage, personal liability for suits brought against the insured for\nbodily injury or property damage, and medical payments to others. He contended that this coverage\ncould only apply to him and not to Flagstar. He also argued that Endorsement # 12 confers a benefit\nupon him because the endorsement's “Mortgage Clause” provides, “If a mortgagee is named in this\npolicy, any loss payable under Coverage A or B will be paid to the mortgagee and you, as interests\nappear.” According to Alvarado, “This clearly shows that the word ‘you’ in the Endorsement\nrefers to [Alvarado] ... but it does not necessarily refer to the mortgagee which would be Flagstar\nBank.” Therefore, Alvarado contended, because Endorsement # 12 “was intended to confer a direct\nbenefit” on him, he qualifies as a third-party beneficiary of the Policy.\n\nLexington replied and argued that Endorsement # 12 “only provides homeowners coverage for\nproperty and damages in which Flagstar has a mortgage and/or an ownership interest.” (Emphasis\nin original.) Lexington contended that the\n\n            Supplemental Declaration Page [to the Policy] qualifies every statement\n            made about homeowner's insurance in the Policy, leaving no doubt that\n            all homeowner's coverage statements and inclusions are meant solely and\n            exclusively to pertain to the insured, Flagstar Bank's, interest. Any references\n            [Alvarado] makes to the Homeowners Coverage Form are limited by the\n            Supplemental Declaration Page.\n\n(Emphasis in original.) Lexington argued that, under the supplemental declarations, any coverage\nprovided pursuant to the Policy is limited to property or damages in which the named insured,\nwhich is defined in the Common Policy Declarations solely as Flagstar, has a mortgage or\nownership interest. Lexington also argued that the Policy language clearly defines “you” as *549\nthe “Named Insured shown in the Declarations” and that Alvarado is not named as an insured,\nadditional insured, or third-party beneficiary in any part of the Policy, including Endorsement # 12.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Co., 389 S.W.3d 544 (2012)\n\n\n\nNeither Lexington nor Alvarado submitted any summary judgment evidence demonstrating\nwhether or not Alvarado's property is specified on the reporting forms submitted by Flagstar to\nLexington showing properties covered by Endorsement # 12. Nor is there any evidence as to what\nFlagstar's and Alvarado's interests in the property are. However, there is some evidence, in the form\nof Alvarado's affidavit, that Flagstar submitted a claim under the Policy to Lexington for damage\nto Alvarado's property and that Flagstar did not repair the damage, did not distribute the funds to\nAlvarado to repair the damage, and did not apply the funds to the balance of Alvarado's mortgage.\n\n [1] On August 19, 2010, the trial court granted Lexington's motion for summary judgment.\nBecause Alvarado's claims against Bower, Flagstar, and Proctor Financial remained pending, this\nwas an interlocutory order that was not yet final and appealable. Alvarado, however, prematurely\nfiled a notice of appeal, and the appeal was assigned to this Court and given appellate cause number\n01–10–00740–CV. Alvarado filed a motion to sever his claims against Lexington, which the trial\ncourt granted, and the trial court then rendered judgment in favor of Lexington on November 19,\n2010. After the trial court rendered this final judgment, Alvarado filed a second notice of appeal,\nwhich resulted in appellate cause number 01–10–01150–CV. We decide the first-filed appeal,\nappellate cause number 01–10–00740–CV, and dismiss appellate cause number 01–10–01150–\nCV. 5\n\n\n\n                                             Standard of Review\n\nWe review de novo the trial court's ruling on a summary judgment motion. Mann Frankfort Stein\n& Lipp Advisors, Inc. v. Fielding, 289 S.W.3d 844, 848 (Tex.2009). To prevail on a traditional\nsummary judgment motion, the movant must establish that no genuine issues of material fact exist\nand that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. TEX.R. CIV. P. 166a(c); Little v. Tex. Dep't\nof Criminal Justice, 148 S.W.3d 374, 381 (Tex.2004). When a defendant moves for summary\njudgment, it must either: (1) disprove at least one essential element of the plaintiff's *550 cause\nof action, or (2) plead and conclusively establish each essential element of its affirmative defense,\nthereby defeating the plaintiff's cause of action. Cathey v. Booth, 900 S.W.2d 339, 341 (Tex.1995).\n\nIf the movant meets its burden, the burden then shifts to the nonmovant to raise a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact precluding summary judgment. See Centeq Realty, Inc. v. Siegler, 899 S.W.2d 195,\n197 (Tex.1995). The evidence raises a fact issue if reasonable and fair-minded jurors could differ\nin their conclusions in light of all of the summary judgment evidence. Goodyear Tire & Rubber\nCo. v. Mayes, 236 S.W.3d 754, 755 (Tex.2007) (per curiam). To determine if the nonmovant has\nraised a fact issue, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, crediting\nfavorable evidence if reasonable jurors could do so, and disregarding contrary evidence unless\nreasonable jurors could not. See Fielding, 289 S.W.3d at 848 (citing City of Keller v. Wilson, 168\nS.W.3d 802, 827 (Tex.2005)). We indulge every reasonable inference and resolve any doubts in\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  5\n\fAlvarado v. Lexington Ins. Co., 389 S.W.3d 544 (2012)\n\n\n\nthe nonmovant's favor. See Sw. Elec. Power Co. v. Grant, 73 S.W.3d 211, 215 (Tex.2002) (citing\nSci. Spectrum, Inc. v. Martinez, 941 S.W.2d 910, 911 (Tex.1997)).\n\n\n\n                                      Third–Party Beneficiary Status\n\nIn his sole issue, Alvarado contends that the trial court erred in rendering summary judgment\nin favor of Lexington because Lexington failed to conclusively negate his status as a third-party\nbeneficiary of the Policy. Lexington responds that this Court should overrule Alvarado's sole issue\nand affirm the summary judgment because Alvarado failed to plead his third-party-beneficiary\nstatus. It further argues that we should affirm the summary judgment because Alvarado failed to\nraise a genuine issue of material fact with respect to his third-party-beneficiary status.\n\n\n1. Alvarado's Right to Argue His Third–Party–Beneficiary Status\n [2] Before we address the merits of Alvarado's sole issue, we address Lexington's contention that\nAlvarado was required to plead third-party beneficiary status, and that, because he did not, we\nshould affirm the trial court's summary judgment on that basis alone.\n\n [3] Lexington's contention is without merit. Lexington itself raised the issue of Alvarado's third-\nparty-beneficiary status by arguing in its summary judgment motion that Alvarado did not qualify\nas a third-party beneficiary to the Policy and therefore lacked standing. Standing is a jurisdictional\nissue that cannot be waived and may be raised at any time. See Tex. Ass'n of Bus. v. Tex. Air\nControl Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440, 445 (Tex.1993). Here, it was raised by Lexington as grounds for\ngranting it summary judgment against Alvarado.\n\nRule 166a provides that a defendant against whom a claim is asserted “may, at any time, move with\nor without supporting affidavits for summary judgment in his favor as to all or any part thereof.”\nTEX.R. CIV. P. 166a(b). The Rule further provides that summary judgment shall be granted if\nthe motion and the summary judgment evidence “show that, except as to the amount of damages,\nthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a\nmatter of law on the issues expressly set out in the motion or in an answer or other response.” Id.\n166a(c). Lexington moved for summary judgment on all of Alvarado's claims on the ground that\nhe lacked standing to pursue them because he was neither a party to the insurance contract between\nLexington and Flagstar nor *551 a third-party beneficiary of the contract. Alvarado responded\nto this issue in his summary judgment response. The issue of Alvarado's third-party-beneficiary\nstatus was thus squarely before the trial court in Lexington's motion and Alvarado's response.\nLexington's contention that Alvarado may not seek to overturn a summary judgment on the very\nissue it presented to the trial court in its own motion as the basis for granting summary judgment\nis directly contrary to the express language of Rule 166a and is without merit.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Third–Party–Beneficiary Status Under Force–Placed Insurance Policies\n [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Insurance contracts are subject to the same rules of construction as ordinary\ncontracts. Archon Invs., Inc. v. Great Am. Lloyds Ins. Co., 174 S.W.3d 334, 338 (Tex.App.-\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2005, pet. denied) (citing Trinity Universal Ins. Co. v. Cowan, 945 S.W.2d\n819, 823 (Tex.1997)). When a policy permits only one reasonable interpretation, we construe it as\na matter of law and enforce it as written. Id. (citing Upshaw v. Trinity Cos., 842 S.W.2d 631, 633\n(Tex.1992)). When construing an insurance policy, “[w]e must strive to effectuate the policy as\nthe written expression of the parties' intent.” Id. (citing State Farm Life Ins. Co. v. Beaston, 907\nS.W.2d 430, 433 (Tex.1995)). To discern the intent of the parties to a contract, the court examines\nand considers the entire writing to harmonize and give effect to all the provisions of the contract so\nthat none will be rendered meaningless, no single provision taken alone will be given controlling\neffect, and all the provisions will be considered with reference to the whole instrument. In re\nServ. Corp. Int'l, 355 S.W.3d 655, 661 (Tex.2011). If the term to be construed is unambiguous\nand susceptible of only one construction, we “give the words in the policy their plain meaning.”\nArchon, 174 S.W.3d at 338 (citing Devoe v. Great Am. Ins., 50 S.W.3d 567, 571 (Tex.App.-Austin\n2001, no pet.)).\n\n [9] [10] In determining whether a third party can enforce a contract, we look only to the intention\nof the contracting parties. Basic Capital Mgmt., Inc. v. Dynex Commercial, Inc., 348 S.W.3d 894,\n900 (Tex.2011); MCI Telecomms. Corp. v. Tex. Utils. Elec. Co., 995 S.W.2d 647, 651 (Tex.1999);\nUnion Pac. R.R. Co. v. Novus Int'l, Inc., 113 S.W.3d 418, 421 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2003,\npet. denied). The fact that a person might receive an incidental benefit from a contract to which he\nis not a party does not give that person a right to enforce the contract. Basic Capital Mgmt., 348\nS.W.3d at 899–900; MCI Telecomms., 995 S.W.2d at 651; Union Pac., 113 S.W.3d at 421.\n\n [11] [12] [13] [14] A third party may recover on a contract made between other parties only\nif the contracting parties intended to secure a benefit to the third party and only if the contracting\nparties entered into the contract directly for the third party's benefit. Basic Capital Mgmt., 348\nS.W.3d at 900; MCI Telecomms., 995 S.W.2d at 651; Union Pac., 113 S.W.3d at 421. The third\nparty must show that he is either a donee or a creditor beneficiary of the contract, and not one who\nis only incidentally benefitted by its performance. MCI Telecomms., 995 S.W.2d at 651; Union\nPac., 113 S.W.3d at 421. A party is a donee beneficiary if the promised performance will, when\nrendered, come to him as pure donation. MCI Telecomms., 995 S.W.2d at 651; Union Pac., 113\nS.W.3d at 421. If that performance will come to him in satisfaction of a legal duty owed to him by\nthe promisee, such as an “indebtedness, contractual obligation or other legally enforceable *552\ncommitment,” he is a creditor beneficiary.

As the\nTexas Supreme Court held in MCI Telecommunications,\n\n            The intention to contract or confer a direct benefit to a third party must be\n            clearly and fully spelled out or enforcement by the third party must be denied.\n            Consequently, a presumption exists that parties contracted for themselves unless\n            it “clearly appears” that they intended a third party to benefit from the contract.\n\n995 S.W.2d at 651; see also Basic Capital Mgmt., 348 S.W.3d at 900 (quoting same).\n\n [18] [19] Due to the presumption against finding third-party beneficiaries to contracts, courts\nwill generally deny third-party-beneficiary claims unless: (1) the obligation of the bargain-giver is\nfully spelled out, (2) it is unmistakable that a benefit to the third party was within the contemplation\nof the contracting parties, and (3) the contracting parties contemplated that the third party would\nbe vested with the right to sue for enforcement of the contract. Union Pac., 113 S.W.3d at 422. We\nresolve all doubts against conferring third-party-beneficiary status. Tawes, 340 S.W.3d at 425; see\nalso First Union Nat'l Bank v. Richmont Capital Partners I, L.P., 168 S.W.3d 917, 929 (Tex.App.-\nDallas 2005, no pet.) (“If there is any reasonable doubt as to the intent of the contracting parties\nto confer a direct benefit on the third party, then the third-party beneficiary claim must fail.”).\n\nTexas's third-party beneficiary policy was recently examined and explained by the Texas Supreme\nCourt in Basic Capital Management. 348 S.W.3d 894. In that case, Basic managed real estate\ninvestment trusts, including American Realty Trust, Inc. (“ART”) and Transcontinental Realty\nInvestors, Inc. (“TCI”). Id. at 896. Basic and Dynex signed a Commitment, in which Dynex agreed\nto loan funds to “single-asset, bankruptcy-remote entities” (“SABREs”) owned by ART and TCI if\nBasic would “propose other acceptable SABREs to borrow $160 million over a two-year period.”\nId. at 896–97. The issue on appeal was whether ART and TCI could recover damages from Dynex\nfor its alleged breach of the Commitment as third-party beneficiaries to the Commitment. Id. at\n898.\n\nThe supreme court reasoned that, because the intention to confer a direct benefit to a third party\nmust be clearly and fully spelled out in the contract for that party to have standing as a third-party\nbeneficiary, “a presumption exists that parties contracted for themselves unless it clearly appears\nthat they intended a third party to benefit from the contract.” Id. at 900. Although only Dynex\nand Basic had signed the Commitment, “Dynex knew that the purpose of the Commitment was\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Co., 389 S.W.3d 544 (2012)\n\n\n\nto secure future financing for ART and TCI, real estate investment trusts that Basic managed and\nin which it held an ownership interest.” Id. Not only was Basic not intended to be the borrower,\nbut the Commitment expressly required that the borrowers be SABREs acceptable to Dynex, and\nDynex knew that Basic would not own the SABREs. Id.\n\n *553 The court concluded that this requirement was for Dynex's benefit, since SABREs are\ndesigned to provide more certain recourse to collateral in the event of default. Id. The court pointed\nout that “SABRE-borrowers provided a mechanism for ART and TCI to hold investment property\ndirectly but in a way that would provide Dynex greater security.” Id. Thus, “if Dynex and Basic\ndid not intend the Commitment to benefit ART and TCI directly, then the Commitment had no\npurpose whatsoever.” Id. Moreover, the Commitment “clearly and fully spelled out the benefit\nto ART and TCI because their role was basic to Dynex's and Basic's agreement.” Id. at 901. The\ncourt concluded, “The Commitment itself, and the undisputed evidence regarding its negotiation\nand purpose, establish that ART and TCI were third-party beneficiaries.” Id.\n\nAlthough Texas state courts have addressed whether a party may be a third-party beneficiary\nin the general insurance policy context, they have not addressed the specific issue of whether a\nhomeowner-borrower qualifies as a third-party beneficiary under a force-placed insurance policy\nentered into between the insurance company and the mortgage company. See, e.g., Paragon Sales\nCo. v. N.H. Ins. Co., 774 S.W.2d 659, 660–61 (Tex.1989) (holding distributor presented some\nevidence that it was third-party beneficiary of indemnity contract between insurance company\nand public motor carrier). As a result of Hurricanes Dolly, Katrina, and Rita, however, some\nfederal courts within the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals' jurisdiction, primarily in Louisiana, have\naddressed this issue and have reached differing conclusions as to the homeowner's third-party-\nbeneficiary status according to the specific terms of the policy and the facts of the case.\n\nWhen deciding whether a homeowner-borrower is a third-party beneficiary under a force-placed\ninsurance policy, the federal courts applying state law, like the Texas courts, have looked to the\nlanguage of the policy to determine whether any of the provisions clearly confer a direct benefit\nupon the borrower. Thus, for example, the Fifth Circuit has found third-party beneficiary status\nto exist (1) when the policy, although only listing the mortgage company as a named insured,\ncontains a subrogation clause providing that the homeowner-borrower will not be liable to the\ninsurance company for any loss paid to the named insured and (2) when the policy contains a\nprovision allowing for temporary housing expenses to be paid to the homeowner-borrower. See\nPalma v. Verex Assurance, Inc., 79 F.3d 1453, 1457–58 (5th Cir.1996) (subrogation clause case\ndecided under Texas law).\n\nIn Palma, the Fifth Circuit held that the inclusion of the subrogation clause within the insurance\npolicy demonstrated a clear intention on the part of the contracting parties to benefit the\nhomeowner-borrower. See id. at 1458 (“[The subrogation clause] is written for the sole benefit of\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   9\n\fAlvarado v.

(noting that\nplaintiff's standing was limited solely to seeking temporary housing expenses because this was\nonly clause in policy providing direct benefit to borrower).\n\nPrimarily, the federal district courts have focused on whether the policy contains one of two\nspecific clauses that may benefit the borrower: (1) an “excess loss” or “residual payment” clause\nor (2) a clause providing that the insurer will adjust all personal property losses with, and pay\nany such proceeds to, the homeowner- *554 borrower. A common excess loss clause provides\nas follows:\n\n            We will adjust all losses with you [the mortgagee and named insured]. We\n            will pay you but in no event more than the amount of your interest in the\n            “insured location.” Amounts payable in excess of your interest will be paid to\n            the “borrower” unless some other person is named by the “borrower” to receive\n            payment....\n\nSee, e.g., Turner v. Gen. Ins. Co. of Am., Civil Action No. 5:09cv00057–DCB–JMR, 2009 WL\n3247302, at *3 (S.D.Miss. Oct. 7, 2009) (slip op.). If the policy provides coverage for personal\nproperty, the insurance policy may include a clause providing that the insurer will adjust all losses\nto personal property with the homeowner-borrower and will pay the borrower any proceeds for\nsuch loss, unless the borrower has named another person to receive payment. Id.\n\nA number of courts in the cases in which there were force-placed policies with such clauses have\nfound third-party-beneficiary status for homeowners under the terms of the particular policy. For\nexample, in Lee v. Safeco Insurance Co. of America, the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of Louisiana held that the excess loss clause, which “clearly stipulate[d] that the\nportion of any loss payment exceeding the value of [the mortgagee's] interest in the property\nwill be paid directly to [the homeowner-borrower],” manifested a “clear intent to benefit the\nborrower.” Civil Action No. 08–1100, 2008 WL 2622997, at *4 (E.D.La.

Graphia v. Balboa Ins. Co., 517 F.Supp.2d\n854 (E.D.La.2007). In Graphia, the policy provided that the borrower “shall be considered\nan additional insured with respect to any residual amounts of insurance over and above [the\nmortgagee's] insurable interest.” Id. at 857. The borrower claimed damages of $56,542.91, and\nshe presented evidence that the balance remaining on her loan was $110,000. Id. The court noted\nthat there was “no amount ‘due for the loss' that exceeds [the mortgagee's] insurable interest.” Id.\nThe court concluded, “The contract does manifest a clear intention to benefit Graphia, but only\nto the extent that she has an insurable interest in the property. *555 The contract evidences no\nintent to give plaintiff personal rights in the insurance coverage for losses that do [not] exceed\nthe mortgagee's insurable interest.” Id. at 858. Because her losses did not exceed the mortgagee's\ninterest in the property, Graphia received only an incidental benefit from this policy and, therefore,\ncould not enforce the contract. Id.; cf. Mingo v. Meritplan Ins. Co., No. 2:06 CV 1914, 2007 WL\n4292026, at *3 (W.D.La. Dec. 4, 2007) (not designated for publication) (denying insurer's motion\nto dismiss for lack of standing because parties disputed amount of loss and record did not reflect\neither amount of mortgage or mortgagee's interest in property).\n\nThe federal courts have also found the force-placed homeowner not to be a third-party beneficiary\nwhen the homeowner did not receive a direct benefit from the policy under the policy's own\nterms. Specifically, the federal courts have denied third-party beneficiary status when the insurance\npolicy states (1) that it does not provide coverage for loss of use, personal liability, or personal\nproperty, (2) that the mortgagee is the sole insured, (3) that the policy is intended to protect the\nmortgagee's interest only and not the borrower's, or (4) that all losses will be adjusted with and\nmade payable to the named insured, the mortgage company.

Alvarado's Status Under Flagstar's Force–Placed Policy\nOn appeal, Alvarado argues that he has third-party-beneficiary status under the Policy. He\ncontends that Endorsement # 12 to the Policy, which provides “Special Broad Form Homeowners\nCoverage,” is analogous to an excess loss clause or a clause allowing for adjustment and payment\nof losses to the borrower. He argues that it demonstrates that Lexington and Flagstar clearly\nintended to benefit him because the terms of this endorsement provide the type of coverage that\nhe, as the homeowner, would seek to obtain if he contracted directly with Lexington to procure\nhomeowner's insurance and that these provisions are irrelevant to Flagstar as the mortgagee of the\nproperty. He points out that Flagstar required the Policy when it loaned him the money to purchase\nhis house and took a mortgage on it. Alvarado paid the premiums on this force-placed Policy as\na separate part of his monthly mortgage payments, and Endorsement # 3 to the Policy required a\nhigher premium for the Special Broad Form Homeowners Coverage.\n\nLexington responds that Flagstar is the sole named insured in the Policy, that Alvarado is not\nmentioned in the Policy, and that the plain language of the Policy can reasonably be construed only\nas protecting Flagstar's mortgage interest in the property up to the extent of that interest, not as\nprotecting Alvarado's interest. It argues, therefore, that the Policy cannot be construed as intended\nto benefit Alvarado, as a matter of law; that Alvarado is not a third-party beneficiary to the Policy\nunder prevailing law construing force-placed insurance policies; and that Alvarado has failed to\nraise a material fact issue as to his third-party-beneficiary status.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Co., 389 S.W.3d 544 (2012)\n\n\n\nWe conclude that Lexington has failed to prove that Alvarado lacks third-party-beneficiary status\nas a matter of law.\n\n\na. The “Common Policy Declarations” and the “Supplemental Declaration Page” of the\nPolicy\nAs Lexington states, the “Common Policy Declarations” in the “Commercial Lines Policy” at issue\nlist “Flagstar Bank, FSB” as the sole “Named Insured.” These Declarations state that the Policy\n“consists of the following coverage parts for which a premium is indicated,” namely, a “Mortgage\nGuard Property Coverage Part.” The Common Policy Declarations then state:\n\n            THESE DECLARATIONS TOGETHER WITH THE COMMON POLICY\n            CONDITIONS, COVERAGE PART DECLARATIONS, COVERAGE PART\n            COVERAGE FORM(S) AND FORMS AND ENDORSEMENTS, IF ANY,\n            ISSUED TO FORM A PART THEREOF, COMPLETE THE ABOVE\n            NUMBERED POLICY.\n\nFor the “Form(s) and Endorsements(s) made part of this policy at time of issue,” the Common\nPolicy Declarations page states, “See attached Table of Contents.” The Table of Contents lists as\n“[c]overage forms and endorsements forming a part of this policy” the “Mortgage Guard Property\nPolicy” and a number of additional endorsements, including Endorsement # 12, a “Homeowners\n3 Special Form” providing “Special Broad Form Homeowner's Coverage.” The Common Policy\nDeclarations state that the complete Policy consists not only of the common declarations and policy\nconditions, but also of the coverage part declarations, coverage part forms, and “the forms and\nendorsements, if any, issued to form a part” of the Policy. In this case, therefore, the Policy at\nissue includes not only the Common Policy Declarations and the Mortgage Guard Property Policy\nwith its declarations, but also Endorsement *557 # 12, the Special Broad Form Homeowner's\nCoverage form, with its declarations.\n\nIn addition to the Common Policy Declarations, the Policy includes a “Supplemental Declaration\nPage” that sets out Lexington's “Limits of Liability” under the Common Policy:\n\n $1,000,000.

Or 50% of the insured value, whichever is the lesser\n\n         D. Loss of Use-$100,000. Or 20% of the insured value, whichever is the lesser *\nThus, the Policy provides that Lexington's liability is limited to $1,000,000 “per property.”\nAdditionally, coverage for properties with “Homeowners Coverage as reported as HO on the\nreporting form” is limited to $500,000 for “any one loss,” plus the lesser of $50,000 or 10% of\nthe insured value for any other structure on the property, plus the lesser of $250,000 or 50% of\nthe insured value of any personal property, plus the lesser of $100,000 or 20% of the insured\nvalue for loss of use. An asterisk by each of these categories of covered loss limits Lexington's\nliability to properties “in which the Insured has a mortgage and/or owner interest and which is\nspecifically described in the Reporting Mechanism agreed upon by the Company.” Lexington has\nproduced no summary judgment evidence that Alvarado's property was not among the properties\nwith “Homeowners Coverage” reported by Flagstar on Lexington's reporting form and specifically\ndescribed by Flagstar in Lexington's Reporting Mechanism at the time of the occurrence made\nthe basis of his claim. However, it did produce the “Homeowners Coverage” part of the Policy,\nEndorsement # 12, as part of the Policy applicable to Alvarado, and Alvarado has averred that he\npaid premiums for this coverage. Therefore, we assume, for purposes of the summary judgment\nmotion, that Alvarado did have Homeowners Coverage and therefore was included on Lexington's\nreporting forms. See Sw. Elec. Power Co., 73 S.W.3d at 215.\n\n\nb. The “Mortgage Guard Property Policy”\nThe “Mortgage Guard Property Policy” provides that “[t]hroughout this policy the words ‘you’\nand ‘your’ refer to the Named Insured shown in the Declarations,” namely Flagstar, and that “[t]he\nwords ‘we’, ‘us' and ‘our’ refer to the Company providing this insurance,” i.e., Lexington. The\nMortgage Guard Property Policy sets out the agreement of Lexington and Flagstar with respect\nto this part of the Policy:\n\n            In consideration of the premium to be charged we will (as shown on the\n            Declaration Page) insure (but only in the event there is no other insurance\n            applicable) the Lending Institution (you, as shown on the Declaration Page [here,\n            Flagstar] ) against direct physical loss resulting from destruction of or damage\n            to your property, reported by you on the reporting forms furnished by us, for the\n            Covered Causes of Loss described in this policy.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Co., 389 S.W.3d 544 (2012)\n\n\n\n\nThe Mortgage Guard Property Policy thus protects Flagstar against physical loss to its property\nreported on Lexington's reporting *558 forms, but “only in the event there is no other insurance\napplicable.”\n\nThe Mortgage Guard Property Policy identifies several types of interest the “Named Insured”\nlending institution, Flagstar, may have in a property and may report on Lexington's reporting\nforms. These include a “Loan” consisting of “an advance of funds or a loan secured by a note and\nfirst or second ‘mortgage interest/loan balance’ evidenced by a contract of sale for real property.”\nCorrespondingly, the Policy defines a “Borrower” as an individual “obligated on a ‘loan’ ... and\n[who] has ... an interest in the property securing such ‘loan.’ ” The Mortgage Guard Property Policy\nstates, “Loss will be adjusted with and made payable to you unless another payee is specifically\nnamed.” The “Mortgage Clause” states, “Loss, if any, under this policy will be payable to the\nmortgagee [Flagstar] (or trustee) as its interests may appear under all present or future mortgages\nupon the Covered Property described on the reporting forms in which mortgagee may have an\ninterest as mortgagee (or trustee) in order of precedence of said mortgages.” Thus, the Mortgage\nGuard Property Policy, by its own terms, insures Flagstar against direct physical loss resulting\nfrom the destruction of or damage to “your property,” i.e., property in which it has a mortgage or\nownership interest and that is reported by Flagstar on Lexington's reporting forms, in the event\nthere is no other insurance applicable.\n\nThe “Policy Conditions” for the Mortgage Guard Property Policy confirm the intent of the\ncontracting parties to cover physical loss to covered property at described locations, stating, “Our\nliability for loss with respect to any property covered will not exceed the Limit of Liability stated\nin the Declarations as applicable, nor exceed, in any event, the lesser of the amount it would cost\nto repair or replace with material of like kind and quality, or the amount of insurance specified on\neach Covered Property at the Described Location on the reporting forms completed by you and\nfurnished to us.”\n\nProvisions in the Mortgage Guard Property Policy specify the means by which Flagstar must\nreport damage for property; they grant it permission, “[i]n the event of loss ... to make reasonable\nrepairs ... provided the repairs are confined solely to the protection of the Covered Property from\nfurther damage and provided you keep an accurate record of the repair expenditures,” to “be\nincluded in determining the amount of loss”; they impose duties of notice, reporting of damage,\nand protection of the covered property in the event of loss; they provide for the examination of\nFlagstar or its representative “about any matter relating to this insurance or a claim”; and, “[i]n\nthe event of a dual interest,” they allow Lexington to require the agreement of “any mortgagor\nclaiming coverage or monetary benefit under this insurance ” to “submit to an examination under\noath ... about any matter relating to this insurance or a claim.” (Emphasis added.)

Co., 389 S.W.3d 544 (2012)\n\n\n\nproperty within the scope of the Policy, and they also recognize that a mortgagor, as well as\nFlagstar, may claim “coverage or monetary benefit under this insurance.”\n\nThere is no way to determine from the summary judgment evidence whether Alvarado is the owner\nof residential property described by Flagstar on Lexington's reporting forms, because those forms\nare not in the record. However, there is summary judgment evidence, in the form of Alvarado's\naffidavit, that Flagstar reported damage to Alvarado's property to Lexington. *559 It is also not\npossible to determine from the summary judgment record precisely what claims either Flagstar or\nAlvarado submitted to Lexington with respect to damage to the property or what amount of money\nfor what losses was paid by Lexington to Flagstar. Nor is it possible to ascertain the extent of\nFlagstar's mortgage interest in Alvarado's property and the extent of Alvarado's interest. However,\nAlvarado avers that his property sustained damage as a result of Hurricane Ike in 2008, that Flagstar\nmade a claim on the Policy, and that Lexington paid Flagstar $4,410.49 in damages. He further\navers that Flagstar did not provide any of these funds to him for the purpose of repairs and that it\ndid not apply these funds to the balance of his mortgage. We consider each of these uncontested\nfacts as stated by Alvarado, the nonmovant, to be true, as we must under summary judgment law.\nSee Fielding, 289 S.W.3d at 848; City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 827.\n\nWe conclude that the Policy manifests a clear intent to directly benefit both Flagstar and “any\nmortgagor claiming coverage or monetary benefit” for damage to property under the Policy, as\ntheir interests may appear as mortgagee or mortgagor of a covered property at the described\nlocations listed by Flagstar on Lexington's reporting forms. We further conclude that Flagstar is\nthe mortgagee of Alvarado's property and that Alvarado is a mortgagor with an ownership interest\nin a property described on Lexington's forms whose property was damaged and for which Flagstar\nsubmitted a claim and was paid. However, it is not possible to determine from the Mortgage Guard\nProperty Policy whether Alvarado was a mortgagor who had a right to claim coverage under the\nPolicy for damage to his property. Therefore, we turn to Endorsement # 12 of the Policy.\n\n\nc. Endorsement # 12: Special Broad Form Homeowners Coverage\n [20] Endorsement # 12, titled “Special Broad Form Homeowners Coverage,” is relied upon\nby Alvarado to show his third-party-beneficiary status under the Policy. It provides the type of\ncoverage that an individual homeowner would generally seek from an insurance company, instead\nof the coverage that a mortgagee seeking solely to protect its monetary interest in the property\nwould typically seek. Endorsement # 12 states, “It is understood and agreed [by Flagstar and\nLexington] that the following coverages are added to this policy and that these coverages apply\nonly to owner occupied properties reported as ‘HO’ property type by the Insured [Flagstar]:\nSpecial Broad Form Homeowners Coverage, Homeowners 3, Special Form, ED. 10–00 (HO–\n3, Ed. 10–00).” This statement is immediately followed by declarations specific to Endorsement\n# 12 that incorporate the property coverage limits from the Common Policy Declarations and\nSupplemental Declaration Page and add additional “Property Coverage,” “Liability Coverages,”\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                16\n\fAlvarado v. Lexington Ins. Co., 389 S.W.3d 544 (2012)\n\n\n\nand “Exclusions.” The endorsement states, “All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.”\nIt is unclear, however, whether Endorsement # 12 formed a part of the Policy insuring Alvarado's\nproperty. Alvarado claims that it did, and Lexington included Endorsement # 12 as part of the\nPolicy on Alvarado's property. Therefore, we take it as true for purposes of this summary judgment\nmotion that Alvarado's property was listed by Lexington as a property carrying Homeowner's\nInsurance. 6 See Sw. Elec. Power Co., 73 S.W.3d at 215.\n\n *560 The Homeowners Coverage provided by Endorsement # 12 is spelled out on the\nSpecial Form. Section I, “Property Coverage,” provides coverage up to the “[l]imit stated on\nthe Declaration Page.” This part of the Homeowners Coverage clearly references the limits\nfor property damage for residences referred to on the Supplemental Declaration Page of the\nPolicy. In addition, Section II, “Liability Coverages,” provides coverage to the owners of the\nspecified properties for “Personal Liability” of “$100,000 per person/$300,000 per occurrence”\nand coverage for “Medical Pay to others” of “$1,000 per person/ $25,000 per accident.” This\nHomeowners Coverage part of the Policy further provides that “[t]he combined limit of liability\nunder the policy for Special Broad Form Homeowners Coverage shall not exceed $1,000,000 for\nthe policy period.”\n\nEndorsement # 12 also states that “[t]he earned premium for each daily period shall be calculated\nby multiplying the total amount of insurance specified on the reporting form furnished by the\nCompany by the rate stated on the Rates and Deductibles Page.” The Rates and Deductibles\npage—Endorsement # 3 to the Policy—specifies that, for “Special Broad Form Homeowners\nCoverage,” “each claim for loss or damage (separately occurring) shall be adjusted separately,”\nand it defines the deductible for different types of covered properties, including Occupied\nResidences. Endorsement # 3 charges a higher premium for Special Broad Form Homeowners\nCoverage. Finally, Endorsement # 12 specifies that the homeowner's coverage ceases to apply\nwhen a property becomes vacant or goes into foreclosure, and it further specifies that “[o]n the\ndate the property status changes the regular residential coverage as indicated in the Residential\nProperty Coverages policy section will apply to that property,” i.e., the coverage indicated on the\nSupplemental Declaration Page of the Common Policy applies, and not the coverage indicated in\nEndorsement # 12.\n\nThe “Definitions” part of Endorsement # 12 defines the term “Insured” for the purpose of\nproperties covered under the “Homeowners Coverage” addition to the Policy in terms that can\nreasonably refer only to the homeowner, not to Flagstar. Section A of the “Definitions” states,\n“In this policy, ‘you’ and ‘your’ refer to the ‘named insured’ shown in the Declarations and the\nspouse if a resident of the same household. ‘We’, ‘us' and ‘our’ refer to the Company providing\nthis insurance.” Section B of the “Definitions” states, “In addition, certain words and phrases are\ndefined as follows.” Definition 5 defines “Insured” to mean, in pertinent part, “[y]ou and residents\nof your household who are ... [y]our relatives; or ... [o]ther persons under the age of 21 and in\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.               17\n\fAlvarado v. Lexington Ins. Co., 389 S.W.3d 544 (2012)\n\n\n\nthe care of any person named above.” Thus, the “insured” for purposes of Endorsement # 12 can\nreasonably be interpreted only as the homeowner of a covered property, and not as the “Named\nInsured” under the Common Policy, Flagstar, or as *561 the “insured” Lending Institution under\nthe Mortgage Guard Property Policy, also Flagstar.\n\n“Insured location” is defined to mean, in pertinent part, “the ‘residence premises.’ ” “Residence\npremises” is further defined as “[t]he one family dwelling where you reside ... and which is shown\nas the ‘residence premises' in the Declarations” and “other structures and grounds at that location.”\n\n“Occurrence” is defined to mean, in pertinent part, “an accident, including continuous or repeated\nexposure to substantially the same general harmful condition, which results, during the policy\nperiod, in ... [p]roperty damage,” i.e., “physical injury to, destruction of, or loss of use of tangible\nproperty.” The “Deductible” part of the endorsement states, “Unless otherwise noted in this policy,\nthe following deductible provision applies: Subject to the policy limits that apply, we will pay only\nthat part of the total of all loss payable under Section 1 [“Property Coverages”] that exceeds the\ndeductible amount shown in the Declarations.”\n\nSubsection A of “Section 1—Property Coverages” of Endorsement # 12 expressly states, “We\ncover ... [t]he dwelling on the ‘residence premises' shown in the Declarations, including structures\nattached to the dwelling; and ... [m]aterials and supplies located on or next to the ‘residence\npremises' used to construct, alter or repair the dwelling or other structures on the ‘residence\npremises.’ ” Subsections B, C, and D of Section 1 provide insurance coverage for, among other\nthings, personal property, loss of use, which includes additional living expenses and fair rental\nvalue, debris removal, reasonable repairs, and credit card fraud.\n\nFinally, “Section 1—Conditions” of Endorsement # 12 provides that, “[e]ven if more than one\nperson has an insurable interest in the property covered, [Lexington] will not be liable in any one\nloss [t]o an ‘insured’ for more than the amount of such ‘insured's' interest at the time of loss.”\nThe “Loss Payment” provision states: “We will adjust all losses with you. We will pay you unless\nsome other person is named in the policy or is legally entitled to receive payment.” Endorsement\n# 12 also includes a “Mortgage Clause” that provides, “If a mortgagee is named in this policy,\nany loss payable ... will be paid to the mortgagee and you, as interests appear.” (Emphasis\nadded.) “Section II—Liability Coverages” provides personal liability coverage for bodily injury\nor property damage, as well as coverage for medical payments to others.\n\nAll of these provisions of this endorsement are meaningful only if the “Insured” and “you”\nreferenced in the Definitions and Property Coverages of Endorsement # 12 mean the homeowner\nof an owner-occupied property reported by Flagstar to Lexington on Lexington's reporting forms\nas having force-placed Homeowners Coverage and if the Homeowners Coverage part of the Policy\nis interpreted as directly insuring the homeowner against loss to property, both real and personal,\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   18\n\fAlvarado v. Lexington Ins. Co., 389 S.W.3d 544 (2012)\n\n\n\nas well as insuring him against personal liability and certain other personal losses, such as loss of\nuse of the property and additional living expenses.\n\nWe conclude that the language in Endorsement # 12 makes apparent the contracting parties'\nintent to confer a direct benefit on the homeowner of “owner occupied properties reported as\n‘HO’ property type by the Insured” under the conditions specified in the Policy and that that\nbenefit is made applicable to property owners when their property is “added to this policy” by\nFlagstar on Lexington's reporting forms. See Basic Capital Mgmt., 348 S.W.3d at 900; *562 MCI\nTelecomms., 995 S.W.2d at 651; see also Palma, 79 F.3d at 1457–58 (holding that homeowner-\nborrower was third-party beneficiary of force-placed insurance policy when policy contained\nprovision that was for “sole benefit” of borrower); Henderson, 2009 WL 3190710, at *3 (limiting\nstanding to seeking temporary housing benefits because this was only clause in policy providing\nbenefit to homeowner); Beck, 2008 WL 4155301, at *2 (finding third-party-beneficiary status\nwhen policy contained excess loss clause and allowed adjustment of personal property damages\nwith borrower); Navarrete, 2008 WL 659477, at *2 (same); Hickman, 695 N.W.2d at 370–71\n(same).\n\nWe further conclude that, because Alvarado pays the premiums on his policy directly to Flagstar,\nwhich forwards them to Lexington, and, in return, Alvarado receives the property and liability\ncoverage provided by the Policy under the “Special Broad Form Homeowners Coverage” added\nby Endorsement # 12, Alvarado is a creditor beneficiary of the contract between Flagstar and\nLexington. See MCI Telecomms., 995 S.W.2d at 651 (stating that if performance will come to third\nparty in satisfaction of legal duty owed to him by promisee, including “contractual obligation or\nother legally enforceable commitment,” he is creditor beneficiary of contract).\n\nLexington argues, however, that the type of policy at issue in this case does not confer third-\nparty-beneficiary status on homeowners. It refers us to a recent opinion from the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of Texas in a diversity case brought under Texas law,\nwhich addressed the effect of a “Special Broad Form Homeowners Coverage” endorsement on the\nhomeowner-borrower's status as a third-party beneficiary in a case similar to the present one. See\nTrevino v. Evanston Ins. Co., Civil Action No. M–11–18, 2011 WL 2709063, at *3 (S.D.Tex. July\n12, 2011). In that case, the homeowner made the same argument Alvarado makes here: because\nthe endorsement provides coverage that is irrelevant to the mortgagee and that “could only inure\nto the benefit of [the homeowner],” the endorsement demonstrates the contracting parties' intent\nto confer a direct benefit on the homeowner. Id.\n\nThe federal district court noted that the insurance company, Evanston, “counters that these\ncoverages [for personal liability, medical pay to others, personal property loss, and loss of use\ncoverage] only become available when a mortgagee complies with the reporting provisions of\nthe Mortgage Guard Policy, which require the mortgagee to notify Evanston of ‘any change\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                19\n\fAlvarado v. Lexington Ins. Co., 389 S.W.3d 544 (2012)\n\n\n\nof ownership or occupancy or increase of hazard,’ i.e., foreclosure, and to pay additional risk\npremiums.” Id. The court concluded, without analysis of the language in the endorsement or the\nfactual circumstances of the case, other than the plaintiff had “made a claim under the policy\nseeking coverage for roof and water damage sustained by the property as a result of Hurricane\nDolly on July 23, 2008,” that “the Policy language unambiguously manifests the intent to provide\nhazard coverage to [the mortgagee] to the extent of its interest in the property, and any benefit\nconferred to [the homeowner] as a result is incidental,” and that the homeowner “has pointed to\nno provision that makes clearly apparent the contracting parties' intent to confer a direct benefit\non Plaintiff.” Id. The court ultimately held that the homeowner-borrower was not a third-party\nbeneficiary under the insurance policy at issue and had no standing to pursue his claims. Id. at\n*1, *3.\n\nIn the instant case, by contrast, the Policy language does unambiguously manifest the contracting\nparties' intent to provide *563 coverage directly to the owners of the properties described by\nFlagstar on Lexington's reporting forms for property damage, including coverage for personal\nproperty damage and personal liability, when Special Broad Form Homeowners Coverage is added\nto the Policy by an endorsement, as spelled out in the Policy. See Basic Capital Mgmt., 348 S.W.3d\nat 900; MCI Telecomms., 995 S.W.2d at 651. Alvarado, unlike Trevino, did point to a provision\nin the Policy, Endorsement # 12, that makes apparent the contracting parties' intent to confer a\ndirect benefit on owners of property reported by Flagstar on Lexington's reporting forms that meet\ncertain conditions specified in the Policy, including owning a Homeowner's Policy. Thus, we find\nTrevino to be distinguishable and its legal conclusions to be inapplicable to this case.\n\nThe dissent, however, finds Trevino persuasive. It reasons that this case is more closely analogous\nto the Texas Supreme Court's decision in MCI Telecommunications, in which the court found no\nthird-party-beneficiary status, than to its decision in Basic Capital Management. We disagree.\nIn MCI Telecommunications, Texas Utilities contracted with the Missouri Pacific Railroad\n(“MoPac”) to obtain a license to install an electric transmission line on MoPac's right-of-way. 995\nS.W.2d at 648–49. Twelve years later, MCI contracted with MoPac to use the right-of-way to\ninstall a fiber optic cable. Id. at 649. MCI's contract with MoPac contained a provision requiring\nMCI to exercise its contract rights “in such a manner as not to interfere in any way with any existing\nprior rights,” such as the rights of existing licensees. Id. The contract also included a provision\nexplicitly stating that no provision of the contract “shall be construed as being for the benefit of\nany party not in signatory hereto.” Id. at 649–50. The Texas Supreme Court reversed both the\ntrial court and the Fort Worth Court of Appeals and held that Texas Utilities was not a third-\nparty beneficiary of MCI's contract with MoPac. Id. at 651. The court reasoned that, although the\ncontract included a provision protecting Texas Utilities' rights as an earlier licensee, the contract\ndid not provide a direct benefit to Texas Utilities and no contractual language indicated that MCI\nand MoPac contracted for Texas Utilities' benefit. Id. at 651–52. At best, Texas Utilities was an\n“incidental beneficiary” of the contract. Id. at 652. The court also noted that the contract explicitly\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  20\n\fAlvarado v. Lexington Ins. Co., 389 S.W.3d 544 (2012)\n\n\n\nstated that it “is not to be interpreted as conferring any benefits on nonsignatory parties” and that\nit “reflects the intention of the parties that there be no third-party beneficiary to the contract.” Id.\n\nUnlike the contract at issue in MCI Telecommunications, the Policy at issue in this case\nincludes provisions directly benefitting the owners of properties reported on Lexington's forms—\nspecifically including those set out in Endorsement # 12—and it does not include a comparable\nexplicit provision restricting construction of the Policy to benefit only the signatories to the Policy.\nIn fact, the Mortgage Guard Property Policy contains language contemplating that the homeowner-\nmortgagor may have a dual interest and may potentially claim coverage or a monetary benefit\nunder the Policy. And Endorsement # 12 expressly states that it provides additional coverage\nto that provided by the rest of the Policy, spells out the protections that the additional coverage\nprovides, and states where this coverage differs from the coverage in the Common Policy in\nterms that can apply only to the homeowner of a residential property, here Alvarado, reported to\nLexington by a mortagee, here Flagstar, as having Special Broad Form Homeowners Coverage.\nIt also defines *564 such a residential homeowner as the “insured” for purposes of homeowners'\ncoverage. Finally, Endorsement # 12 expressly distinguishes the insured residential mortgagor\nfrom the mortgagee as a person having covered interests under the Policy and recognizes that they\nmay have dual interests.\n\nAs the Texas Supreme Court noted in MCI Telecommunications, when interpreting a contract,\n“we examine the entire agreement in an effort to harmonize and give effect to all provisions\nof the contract so that none will be meaningless.” Id. at 652. We conclude, as in Basic Capital\nManagement, that the additional coverage in Endorsement # 12 for which the homeowner is forced\nto pay additional premiums “ha[s] no purpose whatever” and is meaningless unless the “Special\nBroad Form Homeowners Coverage” was intended by Lexington, the insurer of the property,\nand Flagstar, the mortgagee, to directly benefit the mortgagors and homeowners of the properties\nspecifically described by Flagstar on Lexington's reporting forms. See Basic Capital Mgmt., 348\nS.W.3d at 900.\n\nIt was Lexington's burden, as movant for summary judgment, to prove its entitlement to summary\njudgment against Alvarado as a matter of law. We hold that Lexington failed to carry its burden of\nconclusively negating Alvarado's status as a third-party beneficiary to the Policy. Thus, we hold\nthat the trial court erred in rendering summary judgment in favor of Lexington.\n\nWe sustain Alvarado's sole issue.\n\n\n\n                                                   Conclusion\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London, 398 Fed.Appx. 44, 45 (5th Cir.2010) (not designated\n        for publication).\n3       Alvarado also sued Michael Bower, the insurance adjuster who handled Alvarado's claim. Bower is not a party to this appeal.\n\n4       After Lexington moved for summary judgment, Alvarado amended his petition to add claims against Flagstar and Proctor Financial,\n        Inc., the insurance agent responsible for procuring the Policy. Alvarado subsequently non-suited his claims against Flagstar with\n        prejudice. Neither Flagstar nor Proctor Financial is a party to this appeal.\n5       Pursuant to Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 27.1, Alvarado's first prematurely filed notice of appeal was effective and was deemed\n        filed on the day of, but after, the event that began the period for perfecting the appeal: November 19, 2010, the day the trial court\n        granted Alvarado's motion to sever and rendered a final judgment in favor of Lexington. See TEX.R.APP. P. 27.1(a); Ganesan v.\n        Reeves, 236 S.W.3d 816, 817 (Tex.App.-Waco 2007, pet. denied) (“[Rule 27.1] is designed to make it clear that a notice of appeal filed\n        before the final appealable judgment is rendered is nevertheless effective to invoke our appellate jurisdiction of such a judgment.”);\n        Espalin v.

(“[A] document filed in an attempt\n        to appeal an interlocutory order that later becomes final serves to appeal the final judgment.”). In a factually similar scenario, the El\n        Paso Court of Appeals noted that the second notice of appeal, filed after the trial court rendered a final judgment, “was unnecessary\n        to perfect appeal.” Lerma v. Forbes, 144 S.W.3d 18, 20 (Tex.App.-El Paso 2004, no pet.). The El Paso court dismissed the later cause\n        number on its own motion and consolidated the record with the first cause number. Id. We follow the El Paso Court of Appeals'\n        decision in Lerma and hold that Alvarado's first notice of appeal invoked our appellate jurisdiction, and, thus, the second notice of\n        appeal was unnecessary to perfect his appeal and is now moot. We therefore dismiss appellate cause number 01–10–01150–CV,\n        which resulted from his second notice of appeal.\n*          in which the Insured has a mortgage and/or owner interest and which is specifically described in the Reporting Mechanism agreed\n           upon by the Company.\n6       Lexington attached to its motion for rehearing a document purporting to show that Alvarado's property was listed as a “Residential\n        Owner” or “RO” on its reporting forms and claimed that this is a different type of coverage that does not extend the protections of\n        “HO” coverage to Alvarado. This improper attempt to supplement the summary judgment record to change the facts of Alvarado's\n        status on appeal is sufficient by itself to show that summary judgment was improperly granted. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 166a(c) (“The\n        judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if ... the pleadings, admissions, affidavits, stipulations of the parties, and authenticated\n        or certified public records, if any, on file at the time of the hearing, or filed thereafter and before judgment with permission of the\n        court, show that, except as to the amount of damages, there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled\n        to judgment as a matter of law on the issues expressly set out in the motion or in an answer or any other response.”).\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The trial court held that chapter 204 of the Texas Property Code 1 authorized the Board\nto raise assessments unilaterally. The court of appeals affirmed the trial court's judgment in part\nand reversed in part. Both parties petitioned this Court for review. We granted the petitions to\nreview the interplay between Texas Property Code chapter 204 and Northglen Association's deed\nrestrictions. We affirm the court of appeals' judgment in part, vacate in part, and reverse and render\njudgment in part.\n\n\n\n                                                       I\n\n\n                                                   Background\n\nNorthglen Association (“Northglen”) is the homeowners association for six Harris County\nsubdivisions or “sections” encompassing more than 1600 single-family residences. Each section is\ngoverned by a separate set of deed restrictions through which every property owner is a member of\nthe Association. The restrictions subject each homeowner to an annual assessment that is deposited\ninto a maintenance fund for such services as maintaining common areas, contracting for garbage\ndisposal, and constructing parks.\n\n *161 In 1994, Northglen's Board of Directors amended the deed restrictions to expand the Board\nand to assess late fees on unpaid assessments. Geneva Brooks and other Northglen property\nowners (“Brooks”) organized a committee, called the Committee to Remove the Board, to remove\ncertain Board members who, they complained, acted outside the bounds of the deed restrictions\nby adopting the amendments. Northglen responded by suing for injunctive and declaratory relief.\nNorthglen sought an order enjoining the eight homeowners from conveying the false impression\nthat Brooks's committee was formed pursuant to Northglen's bylaws and from other conduct\ndesigned to disrupt the Board's activities. Northglen also sought a judgment declaring that its\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  2\n\fBrooks v. Northglen Ass'n, 141 S.W.3d 158 (2004)\n47 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 719\n\nactions in electing the Board and assessing late fees were valid exercises of its authority. Brooks\ncounterclaimed for a declaratory judgment that Northglen had no authority to raise assessments or\ncharge late fees without a vote of the property owners. Northglen eventually nonsuited its claims,\nand the case proceeded on Brooks's declaratory judgment action.\n\nThe trial court granted summary judgment for Northglen, declaring that, without a vote of the\nhomeowners, Northglen had the authority to: (1) raise the assessment for Sections One, Two,\nand Three; (2) raise the assessment for Sections Four, Five, and Six by ten percent each year or\naccumulate and assess the increase after a number of years; and (3) charge delinquent homeowners\na $35 late fee. Finding that both parties had pursued legitimate interests, the trial court elected not\nto award attorney's fees.\n\nThe court of appeals affirmed the trial court's judgment in part and reversed in part. 76 S.W.3d\n162, 176. It reversed as to Sections One, Two, and Three, holding that the deed restrictions did not\npermit annual assessments exceeding $120. As to Sections Four, Five, and Six, the court of appeals\nheld that because the deed restrictions contained no language expressly forbidding accumulation,\nNorthglen could accumulate previous assessments under Property Code section 204.010(16). Id. at\n167. The court also held that section 204.010(10) gave Northglen the right to assess a $35 late fee\nin addition to the interest charge permitted by the deed restrictions. Id. at 174. Because the property\nowners did not have prior notice of the late fee, the court of appeals held that Northglen could not\nforeclose on any homesteads to collect those fees. Id. at 175. The court of appeals affirmed the\ntrial court's denial of attorney's fees. Id. at 176.\n\nWe hold that Northglen cannot accumulate unassessed fee increases because the language in\nthe deed restrictions prevails over chapter 204, and we reverse that portion of the court of\nappeals' judgment. We affirm the portion of the court of appeals' judgment restricting increases in\nassessments to $120 and holding that Northglen has the authority to assess late charges for unpaid\nfees, in addition to the interest charges described in the deed restrictions. We conclude, however,\nthat Northglen may not foreclose on the property if late charges are not paid. Finally, we affirm\nthe court of appeals' judgment regarding attorney's fees.\n\n\n\n                                                        II\n\n\n                                                   Jurisdiction\n\nWe first consider Northglen's contention that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction\nbecause Brooks did not join all Northglen property owners as parties. Northglen argues that Brooks\nwas required to join all property owners in each affected section before the trial court could render\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 719\n\na declaratory judgment and, alternatively, *162 that the trial court was without jurisdiction to\nrender a declaratory judgment interpreting the deed restrictions for Sections Three and Six because\nproperty owners from those sections were not represented in the lawsuit.\n\n [1] We do not have the benefit of the lower courts' views on jurisdiction because Northglen did\nnot raise the issue either in the trial court or the court of appeals. Northglen contends that the\ndoctrine of fundamental error excuses it from “the usual requirements of preservation of the error\nor briefing of the ... argument” because the absence of jurisdiction may be raised for the first time\non appeal. We disagree that the absence of parties within the represented sections deprived the\ncourt of jurisdiction and therefore reject Northglen's contention as to Sections One, Two, Four and\nFive; however, because no property owners in Sections Three or Six were joined in the suit, we\nagree with Northglen that any judgment affecting those sections would be advisory.\n\n\n\n                                                      A\n\n [2] No one disputes that the trial court had jurisdiction to declare the “rights, status, and other\nlegal relations” for the named homeowners, who are “interested under a deed, ... written contract,\nor other writings constituting a contract or whose rights, status, or other legal relations are affected\nby a statute....” Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code §§ 37.003(a) and 37.004(a). The question, then, is\nnot “whether jurisdiction is lacking,” as Northglen asserts, but whether the trial court should have\nrefused to enter a judgment when a subset of the homeowners was not joined in the lawsuit. See\nCooper v. Tex. Gulf Indus., Inc., 513 S.W.2d 200, 204 (Tex.1974) (“[the] concern is less that of the\njurisdiction of a court to proceed and is more a question of whether the court ought to proceed with\nthose who are present”). To answer that prudential question, we turn to Rule 39, which governs\njoinder of persons under the Declaratory Judgment Act. Tex.R. Civ. P. 39; Clear Lake City Water\nAuth. v. Clear Lake Util., 549 S.W.2d 385, 390 (Tex.1977) (applying Rule 39 to actions under the\nDeclaratory Judgment Act).\n\nRule 39, like the Declaratory Judgment Act, mandates joinder of persons whose interests would be\naffected by the judgment. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code § 37.006 (“When declaratory relief is\nsought, all persons who have or claim any interest that would be affected by the declaration must\nbe made parties.”) (emphasis added); Tex.R. Civ. P. 39(a) (“A person who is subject to service of\nprocess shall be joined as a party in the action if ... he claims an interest relating to the subject of\nthe action ....”) (emphasis added). Rule 39 determines whether a trial court has authority to proceed\nwithout joining a person whose presence in the litigation is made mandatory by the Declaratory\nJudgment Act. Clear Lake City Water Auth., 549 S.W.2d at 390.\n\nRule 39(a)(1) requires the presence of all persons who have an interest in the litigation so that\nany relief awarded will effectively and completely adjudicate the dispute. In this case, nothing\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    4\n\fBrooks v. Northglen Ass'n, 141 S.W.3d 158 (2004)\n47 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 719\n\nin the rule precluded the trial court from rendering complete relief among Northglen and the\neight homeowners who had sued for a declaration of rights. Although the parties continue to\nlitigate its correctness, the trial court's judgment represents a final and complete adjudication of the\ndispute for the parties who were before the court. See Caldwell v. Callender Lake Prop. Owners\nImprovement Ass'n, 888 S.W.2d 903, 907 (Tex.App.-Texarkana 1994, writ denied). Rule 39(a)(2)\nrelates to situations in which the absent party:\n\n              *163 [C]laims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated\n             that the disposition of the action in his absence may (i) as a practical matter\n             impair or impede his ability to protect that interest or (ii) leave any of the persons\n             already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or\n             otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of his claimed interest.\n\nTex.R. Civ. P. 39.\n\nSection 37.006(a) of the Declaratory Judgment Act, which provides that a trial court's declaration\ndoes not prejudice the rights of any person not a party to the proceeding, dispenses with the first\nof these concerns. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code § 37.006(a). Any non-joined homeowner\nwould be entitled to pursue individual claims contesting Northglen's authority to raise assessments\nor impose fees, notwithstanding the trial court's judgment in the current case. 2 See Cooper,\n513 S.W.2d at 204 (“[I]t would be rare indeed if there were a person whose presence was so\nindispensable in the sense that his absence deprives a court of jurisdiction ...”).\n\nWe appreciate the risk that, unless each homeowner is joined in one suit, Northglen may be\nsubject to inconsistent judgments. Tex.R. Civ. P. 39(a)(2)(ii). Northglen's dilemma, however, is\nthe product of its own inaction. Northglen could have sought relief at trial by urging the court,\namong other things, to abate the case, join absent homeowners, or grant special exceptions. See,\ne.g., Pirtle v. Gregory, 629 S.W.2d 919, 920 (Tex.1982); Dahl v. Hartman, 14 S.W.3d 434,\n436 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2000, pet. denied); Adams v. Owens, 519 S.W.2d 260, 261\n(Tex.Civ.App.-Beaumont 1975, writ ref'd n.r.e.); Pan Am. Petroleum Corp. v. Vines, 459 S.W.2d\n911, 912 (Tex.Civ.App.1970, writ ref'd n.r.e.); Texaco, Inc. v. Lettermann, 343 S.W.2d 726, 733\n(Tex.Civ.App.-Amarillo, 1961, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Instead, it waited until the case reached this Court\nto first raise the specter of multiple or inconsistent judgments.\n\n[3] Northglen counters that the doctrine of fundamental error excuses its failure to preserve error.\nHowever, when Rule 39 was amended, a young law professor remarked:\n\n             Henceforth, it will be rare indeed when an appellate court properly determines\n             that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate a dispute when the nonjoining\n             person's absence is raised for the first time on appeal by one of the parties in\n             the trial court, at least insofar as the judgment affects parties who participated in\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 719\n\n             the trial, directly or indirectly, or who purposely bypassed the proceedings. The\n             doctrine of fundamental error should no longer protect persons from the binding\n             force of judgments when they have had an opportunity to raise the absence of\n             the nonjoined person and waived it.\n\nWilliam V. Dorsaneo, III, Compulsory Joinder of Parties in Texas, 14 Hous. L.Rev. 345, 369\n(1977). We conclude that Northglen “had an opportunity to raise the absence of the nonjoined\nperson and waived it.” Id.; Tex.R.App. P. 33.1.\n\n\n\n                                                      B\n\n [4] [5] [6] Sections Three and Six present a different question — does a trial court have\njurisdiction to declare the rights of parties who are not before the court? A declaratory judgment\nrequires a justiciable *164 controversy as to the rights and status of parties actually before the\ncourt for adjudication, and the declaration sought must actually resolve the controversy. See, e.g.,\nThe M.D. Anderson Cancer Ctr. v. Novak, 52 S.W.3d 704, 708 (Tex.2001); Texas Workers' Comp.\nComm'n v. Garcia, 893 S.W.2d 504, 517–18 (Tex.1995). A judicial decision reached without a\ncase or controversy is an advisory opinion, which is barred by the separation of powers provision\nof the Texas Constitution. Tex. Const. art. II, § 1; see Southwestern Elec. Power Co. v. Grant,\n73 S.W.3d 211 (Tex.2002); Texas Ass'n of Bus. v. Tex. Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440, 444\n(Tex.1993). We must decide, then, whether there is a case or controversy with respect to these\nsections.\n\nBecause there are no “plaintiffs” from Sections Three and Six, there is no person in those sections\nfor whom rights could be declared in this declaratory judgment action. As a consequence, the trial\ncourt was without jurisdiction to issue a judgment with respect to those sections, and any opinion\ninterpreting those sections would be purely advisory. Accordingly, we vacate those portions of\nthe lower courts' judgments relating to Sections Three and Six and dismiss those claims for want\nof jurisdiction.\n\nHaving resolved Northglen's appellate pleas to the jurisdiction, we reach the merits for Sections\nOne, Two, Four and Five.\n\n\n\n                                                     III\n\n\n                                           Sections One and Two\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 719\n\n [7] We first decide whether the deed restrictions for Sections One and Two, which are identical,\nallow Northglen to assess additional maintenance fees above the restrictive covenant's express\nlimitation. The restrictions provide:\n\n             Each Lot in said Subdivision, when said Lot is certified by the Subdivision\n             Engineer to be a completed building site, is hereby subjected to an annual\n             maintenance charge and assessment not to exceed $10 per month or $120 per\n             annum, for the purpose of creating a fund to be designated and and [sic] known\n             as the “maintenance fund”, [sic] which maintenance charge and assessment will\n             be paid by the Owner or Owners of each Lot within said Subdivision, and any\n             annexed areas, to Northglen Association in advance annually, commencing as to\n             all Lots on the first day of the month following their certification of completion.\n             The rate at which each Lot will be assessed will be determined annually by the\n             Board of Directors of Northglen Association at least thirty (30) days in advance\n             of each annual assessment. Said rate and when same is payable may be adjusted\n             from year to year by said Board of Directors as the needs of the Subdivision may\n             in the judgment of the Directors require.\n\nThe restrictions also outline requirements for amendment. Article VIII provides that “... the\ncovenants and restrictions of this Declaration may be amended during the first forty (40) year\nperiod by an instrument signed by not less than ninety percent (90%) of the Lot Owners, and\nthereafter by an instrument signed by not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the Lot Owners.”\nTherefore, a small number of homeowners may exert enormous influence on the extent to which\namendments will be adopted. 3\n\n *165 Although there are practical hurdles to persuading seventy-five or ninety percent of\nhomeowners to modify the restrictions or agree to an additional assessment, it is clear that the\nrestrictions provide a mechanism by which Northglen can assess an annual fee greater than $120.\nThe court of appeals agreed, holding that because the deed restriction provided that the annual\nassessments were “not to exceed” $10 per month or $120 per annum, Northglen did not have the\nauthority to exceed the stated limits without first obtaining the homeowners' consent in accordance\nwith the restrictions. 76 S.W.3d at 174.\n\nNorthglen disputes this holding, arguing that the deed restrictions should be read in three steps.\nFirst, the restrictions create a maintenance fund, for which the assessment shall not exceed $10 per\nmonth or $120 per annum. Second, when the maintenance fund is created, the Board of Directors\nhas discretion to determine the rate at which each lot will be assessed above the $120. Third, the\nassessment rate and date payable may be adjusted from year to year, as the needs of the subdivision\nrequire.\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Autumn Run Cmty. Improvement Ass'n. 23\nS.W.3d 398 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2000, pet. denied). The Samms court held that a deed\nrestriction with language similar to Section One and Two granted the homeowners association the\nauthority, from year to year, to determine the rate at which property owners would be assessed.\nId. at 402. The court held that the homeowners association had authority to raise the assessment\nwithout limitation because a phrase in the deed restriction said “the rate at which each Lot will\nbe assessed ... will be determined annually by the Board of Directors....” Id. But the court did not\ndiscuss another provision of that deed restriction which stated explicitly that the assessment was\n“not to exceed” a particular amount.\n\nThe Northglen deed restrictions subject each property owner to “an annual maintenance charge\nand assessment not to exceed $10 per month or $120 per annum, for the purpose of creating ...\nthe ‘maintenance fund’....” (Emphasis added.) The restrictions further provide that “[t]he rate at\nwhich each Lot will be assessed will be determined annually” by Northglen, and that “[s]aid rate\nand when same is payable may be adjusted from year to year by [Northglen] as the needs of the\nSubdivision may in the judgment of [Northglen] require.”\n\nNorthglen's argument does not survive the restrictions' plain language. First, the annual assessment\nis not to exceed $10 per month or $120 per year. The restrictions do not require that Northglen\ncharge the maximum amount. Rather, Northglen may charge any amount so long as the amount\ndoes not exceed $120 per year. So, if Northglen had been assessing $50 per year and decided the\nnext year that $120 was necessary, it has the authority to raise the rates unilaterally. Second, the\ndeed restrictions neither contemplate nor permit an additional assessment once the maintenance\nfund is whole because the language says plainly that the assessment is not to exceed $10 per month\nor $120 per year. There is no language permitting an additional assessment beyond that which is\nincluded in the maintenance fund, aside from the special assessment for capital improvements.\n\n *166 We hold that the court of appeals correctly concluded that Northglen cannot increase\nassessments beyond the $120 limitation set forth in the deed restrictions, and we affirm that part\nof the court of appeals' judgment.\n\n\n\n                                                     IV\n\n\n                                          Sections Four and Five\n\n [8] Northglen argues — and the court of appeals held — that the deed restrictions permit\naccumulation of unassessed increases in maintenance fees for Sections Four and Five. 76 S.W.3d at\n167. Northglen contends, specifically, that Property Code section 204.010 allows it to accumulate\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Prop.Code § 204.010.\n\nThe property owners counter that the trial court properly interpreted Sections Four and Five as\nto allowable increases. They argue that by limiting the annual assessment increase to ten percent,\nthe deed restrictions “otherwise provide” that accumulation is not permitted. We examine the\ncompeting contentions first by analyzing the deed restrictions and then by determining the extent\nto which they are affected by the Property Code.\n\n\n\n                                                      A\n\nDetermining whether the statute applies requires an understanding of the deed restrictions. The\ndeed restrictions for Section Four provide:\n\n             Until January 1 of the year immediately following the conveyance of the\n             first Lot to an Owner, the maximum annual assessment shall not exceed Ten\n             ($10.00) Dollars per month, or One Hundred Twenty ($120.00) Dollars per\n             annum, per lot; provided, however, that from and after January 1 immediately\n             following the conveyance of the first Lot to an Owner, the Board of Directors\n             of the Association shall be empowered to increase said rate as the needs of the\n             Association require; except that if any such increase shall cause the annual\n             assessment to be greater than the aforesaid $120.00 plus the rise, if any, of\n             the Consumer Price Index as published by the United States Department\n             of Labor for the preceding month of July; or more than One Hundred\n             Ten (110%) percent of the amount assessed in the preceding calendar year,\n             whichever is greater, then shall such an increase require the vote of two-\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

From and\n             after the first day of January of the year immediately following the date of\n             commencement of the first annual assessment, the maximum annual assessment\n             may be increased by the Board of Directors of the Association, effective the\n             first day of January of each year, in conformance with the rise, if any, in the\n             Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers published\n             by the Department of Labor, Washington, D.C., or any successor publication,\n             for the preceding month of July or alternatively, by an amount equal to a\n             ten percent (10%) increase over the prior years [sic] annual assessment,\n             whichever is greater, without a vote of the Members of the Association. The\n             maximum annual assessment may be increased above that established by the\n             Consumer Price Index formula or the above-mentioned percentage increase only\n             by approval of two-thirds (2/3rds) of each class of Members in the Association\n             present and voting at a meeting duly called for this purpose.

Northglen Ass'n, 141 S.W.3d 158 (2004)\n47 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 719\n\n\n\n\n                                                      B\n\nWe now consider how the Texas Property Code applies to the preceding deed restrictions. One of\nthe stated purposes in chapter 204 is to provide a mechanism “to readily facilitate increases in the\namount of the regular or special assessments to allow the property owners' associations to better\nprovide services to the subdivisions.” Tex. Prop.Code § 204.001 historical note, [Act of May 27,\n1995, 74th Leg., R.S., ch. 1040, § 1, 1995 Tex. Gen. Laws 5170, 5171]. The Legislature observed\nthat severe restrictions on the ability to adjust regular assessments “may result in the inability of an\nineffective property owners' association to maintain common area facilities, including swimming\npools, tennis courts, clubhouses, greenbelt areas, or jogging trails, or to provide services, including\nstreetlights, security, architectural control, and deed restriction enforcement.” Id. Read in isolation,\nthe legislature's preamble to section 204 offers some support for Northglen's argument that it has\nthe authority to accumulate previously unassessed fee increases beyond the maximum stated in\nthe restrictions to maintain common facilities or to provide services. The Legislature, however,\ninserted a caveat that governs here: the statutory provision permitting accumulation does not apply\nif the deed restrictions “otherwise provide.” Tex. Prop.Code § 204.010.\n\nIn this case, the Northglen deed restrictions for Sections Four and Five “otherwise provide” that\naccumulation is not permitted. Section Four limits the ten *168 percent increase to “the amount\nassessed in the preceding calendar year.” (Emphasis added.) Section Five also limits the “increase\nover the prior years [sic] annual assessment.” (Emphasis added.) The natural consequence of\neach restriction's language is that if the annual assessment for this year is $120, then next year's\nassessment may not be raised to the $550 that Northglen seeks. Rather, next year's assessment may\nbe no more than $132. By specifically tying any increase to the previous year's annual assessment,\nthe deed restrictions do not permit accumulation over multiple years.\n\nAdditionally, in Section Four, Northglen may increase fees beyond the limits by receiving a “vote\nof two-thirds (2/3) of each class of Members of the Association who are voting in person or by\nproxy, at a meeting duly called for that purpose.” In Section Five the Board must receive “approval\nof two-thirds (2/3rds) of each class of Members in the Association present and voting at a meeting\nduly called for this purpose.” Although a two-thirds vote may be difficult to achieve, the deed\nrestrictions offer Northglen a procedure for increasing fee assessments beyond the ten-percent\nlimit other than accumulation. The voting mechanism, combined with the increase being tied to\nthe previous year's assessment, establishes that the deed restrictions “otherwise provide.”\n\nBecause we conclude that the statute does not permit accumulation or fee increases above the deed\nrestrictions, we need not address Brooks's contention that the statute's accumulation provisions\nare unconstitutional.\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 719\n\n\n\n\n                                                      V\n\n\n                                                   Late Fees\n\nWe next consider whether section 204.010(a)(10) authorized Northglen to impose a $35 late\ncharge, in addition to the interest charge included in the deed restrictions, for failure to pay the\nannual assessments, and if so, whether such a construction violates the Contract Clause of the U.S.\nor Texas Constitution. The trial court held that Northglen could charge a late fee under section\n204.010(a)(10), and the court of appeals affirmed. Both courts noted that the deed restrictions did\nnot expressly prohibit late fees nor limit penalties to the interest charge. We hold that Northglen\nmay charge a $35 late fee and that such a charge is constitutional.\n\n\n\n                                                      A\n\n [9] The homeowners argue that permitting Northglen to unilaterally assess late charges would\ndefeat the purpose of the deed restrictions, which already impose a six percent interest charge for\nnonpayment. Additionally, the homeowners argue that by expressly including the interest charge in\nthe restrictions, the homeowners necessarily rejected late charges, under the doctrine of expressio\nunius est exclusio alterius (to include one thing implies the exclusion of the other). Black's Law\nDictionary 602 (7th ed.1999).\n\nThe court of appeals disagreed with the homeowners' argument and held that Northglen could\nassess late charges. The court considered the language of section 204.010(a)(10), which provides,\nin pertinent part:\n\n   (a) Unless otherwise provided by the restrictions or the association's articles of incorporation or\n   bylaws, the property owners' association, acting through its board of directors or trustees, may:\n\n   ...\n\n   (10) impose interest, late charges, and, if applicable, returned check charges for *169 late\n   payments of regular assessments or special assessments.\n\nTex. Prop.Code § 204.010(a)(10). The court held that this statutory language granted Northglen\nauthority to assess the late charge in the absence of specific language to the contrary. Because\nthe deed restrictions do not mention late charges specifically, the court held that silence could not\nmean “otherwise provide.” 76 S.W.3d at 174.\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 719\n\nWe agree that nothing in the Northglen deed restrictions could be considered “otherwise\nproviding.” Each deed restriction contains the same provision for failing to pay assessments:\n\n   Effect of Non-payment of Assessments: Remedies of the Association. Any assessment not paid\n   within thirty (30) days after the due date shall bear interest from the due date at the rate of\n   six percent (6%) per annum. The Association may bring an action at law against the Owner\n   personally obligated to pay the same, or foreclose the lien against the property. No Owner may\n   waive or otherwise escape liability for the assessments provided for herein by non-use of any\n   Common Area or abandonment of his Lot.\n\nContrary to Brooks's argument, the deed restrictions do not say the penalties are the exclusive\nremedies for late payments, nor do they say that late charges are not permitted. The deed\nrestrictions only set the rate at which Northglen may charge interest on unpaid assessments.\n\n [10] When construing a statute, the Court must presume that every word of the legislation\nhas meaning. Riverside Nat'l Bank v. Lewis, 603 S.W.2d 169, 173 (Tex.1980). The statute\nunequivocally says the Board may impose both interest charges and late charges. That the deed\nrestriction mentions interest charges but not late charges is not sufficient to “otherwise provide.”\n\n\n\n                                                      B\n\nBrooks argues that the assessment of a late fee would violate the U.S. 4 and Texas 5 Constitutions'\nimpairment-of-contracts provisions because the deed restrictions do not provide for late fees. The\ncourt of appeals examined the constitutionality of the statute and held that Section 204.010 “is\nnot directed to any specific kind of contracts, and it does not directly contradict any contractual\nprovision....” 76 S.W.3d at 168. The court further noted that the statute is a permissible exercise\nof the State's police power because “it was enacted to promote the public welfare with regard to\nthe property owners associations' ability to better provide services to the homeowners, maintain\nthe common area facilities, and provide for the common security and restriction enforcement.” Id.\nat 168–69. We agree and hold that the same rationale applies to the late fees imposed pursuant\nto chapter 204.\n\n [11] [12] A statute is presumptively constitutional. Barshop v. Medina Cty. Underground\nWater Conservation Dist., 925 S.W.2d 618, 625 (Tex.1996). As such, we are obligated to avoid\nconstitutional problems if possible. Id. In this case, we must consider two factors: first, whether the\n *170 statute substantially impairs the contract; and second, if so, whether the Legislature acted\nwithin its police powers in enacting the legislation. See Allied Structural Steel Co. v. Spannaus,\n438 U.S. 234, 244–45, 98 S.Ct. 2716, 57 L.Ed.2d 727 (1978).\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 719\n\n [13] Section 204.010 does not substantially impair Northglen's deed restrictions. The statute\noperates only where the deed restrictions do not “otherwise provide.” Tex. Prop.Code § 204.010.\nIt does not serve to withdraw or remove any contractual obligation. If the statute required the\nassessment of late fees where late fees were expressly prohibited by the deed restrictions, this\nwould likely be a different case. See Travelers' Ins. Co. v. Marshall, 124 Tex. 45, 76 S.W.2d\n1007 (1934)(discussing statutes that declare a complete moratorium on particular contracts). We\nare not faced with that circumstance here. Thus, applying the statute to authorize a late fee is not\nunconstitutional.\n\n\n\n                                                       VI\n\n\n                                                   Foreclosure\n\n [14] Because we hold that Northglen may charge late fees for unpaid fee assessments, we\nmust address whether it has the authority to foreclose on the homestead if a property owner\nfails to pay the late fee. This Court has clarified that Texas' homestead laws authorize a\nhomeowners association to foreclose on homesteads for the nonpayment of fee assessments.\nInwood Homeowners' Ass'n v. Harris, 736 S.W.2d 632, 635–36 (Tex.1987). In Inwood, we\nconsidered whether the homestead laws of Texas protect a homeowner against foreclosure for\nfailure to pay homeowners association assessments. Id. at 633. As a general rule, a homestead\nis protected against the debts of those who live in the homestead. Id. at 634. However, the deed\nrestrictions for the subdivision included a vendor's lien permitting foreclosure on the homestead\nfor failure to pay the fee assessment. Id. at 633. Because the property owner had notice when\npurchasing the property that a lien attached to the land, we held that foreclosure was permissible.\nId. at 635–36.\n\nThe court of appeals, in our case, focused on the notice requirement and held that foreclosure was\nnot a potential remedy against unpaid late charges. 76 S.W.3d at 175. The court noted that the lien\nto enforce the late charges attached to the property after the homestead was acquired because late\ncharges were not included in the deed restriction. Id.\n\nThe court cited as authority an Attorney General opinion that said costs imposed upon property\nowners because of Chapter 204, which were not part of the deed restriction, could not be enforced\nthrough foreclosure. Id. (citing Tex. Att'y Gen. Op. LO–97–019 (1997)). The Attorney General\nconcluded that, in determining whether foreclosure is a remedy, the issue is “whether the lien\nfor those costs (i) attached to the property prior to the homestead right and (ii) is the result of\na restriction that runs with the land.” Tex. Att'y Gen. Op. LO–97–019. The court of appeals\nconsidered the two elements and held that because late charges were not part of the deed restrictions\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 719\n\nbut rather a function of the statute, Northglen could not foreclose for failure to pay late charges.\n76 S.W.3d at 175–76.\n\nNorthglen argues that a developer has the authority to create liens to ensure the payment\nof fee assessments, and under Inwood, an appropriate remedy for failure to pay assessments\nis foreclosure. Northglen also contends that because property *171 owners were aware that\ndelinquent assessments would be subject to late charges, in the form of an interest charge, the\nproperty owners had actual notice sufficient to satisfy Inwood. Thus, because the property owners\nhad actual notice, Northglen asserts, the late charge should also run with the land as the interest\ncharge does.\n\nWe disagree with Northglen and agree with the court of appeals. Northglen's argument essentially\namends the deed restrictions to include both late fees and interest charges. But the restrictions did\nnot provide any notice that a late fee would be imposed in addition to the interest charge. As a\nresult, the property owners did not have notice of the late charge. Therefore, in light of Inwood 's\nnotice requirement, foreclosure is not an appropriate remedy for a failure to pay the late charge. 6\n\n\n\n                                                    VII\n\n\n                                       Non-profit Corporation Act\n\n [15] Northglen challenges that portion of the trial court's judgment providing that “the bylaws\nmay only be amended by the members....” Northglen argues that, even absent Property Code\nchapter 204, it had the authority to increase assessments because it may amend the bylaws\nunilaterally under the Texas Non–Profit Corporation Act. Tex.Rev.Civ. Stat. art. 1396–1.01 et seq.\nThat statute provides, among other things, that a board of directors has the authority to amend\nbylaws unless the articles of incorporation reserve the power exclusively to the members. We\ncannot reach this issue. Northglen did not file a notice of appeal from the trial court's judgment,\ndid not notice a cross-appeal, and did not petition this court for review on the point. Accordingly,\nNorthglen did not preserve this issue for our review. Tex.R.App. P. 25.1(c) (“[A] party who seeks\nto alter the trial court's judgment or other appealable order must file a notice of appeal.... The\nappellate court may not grant a party who does not file a notice of appeal more favorable relief than\ndid the trial court except for just cause.”), 53.1 (“A party who seeks to alter the court of appeals'\njudgment must file a petition for review.”); see also Dean v.

The Declaratory Judgment act permits a court\nto “award costs and reasonable and necessary attorney's fees as are equitable and just.” Tex. Civ.\nPrac. & Rem.Code §§ 37.009. Although we reverse *172 part of the court of appeals' judgment,\nthe basis for the trial court's decision for denying fees — that each side pursued legitimate interests\n— has not changed. Accordingly, we will not disturb the trial court's discretionary decision in that\nregard.

The 107th District Court, Willacy County,\nHawthorne Phillips, J., entered judgment in favor of plaintiff and the defendant appealed. The San\nAntonio Court of Civil Appeals Fourth Supreme Judicial District, 324 S.W.2d 449, reversed and\nplaintiff brought error.

The\nprior suit in the 107th District Court was between the same parties, except petitioners herein were\ndefendants and respondent herein was plaintiff. In the first suit between the parties, Puretex, as\nplaintiff, recovered a permanent injunction against California Products and Davis prohibiting them\nfrom marketing their lemon and lime juice in bottles which resembled in appearance the bottles\nused by plaintiff. This judgment was an agreed judgment and there was no appeal taken from it and\nit became final. After the entry of the above decree, petitioner files this declaratory judgment suit.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Puretex Lemon Juice, Inc., 160 Tex. 586 (1960)\n334 S.W.2d 780\n\n\n **781 Trial was had before a jury and two special issues were answered by the jury. The first\nissue asked the jury to find from a preponderance of the evidence whether plaintiff planned to\nhave bottles made of the kind set out in a blueprint introduced in evidence, such bottles to be used\nas containers in which to market its lemon and lime juice. The jury answered this issue in the\naffirmative which was favorable to the plaintiff. The second issue asked the jury to find from a\npreponderance of the *588 evidence whether the bottle and its markings which plaintiff proposed\nto use to market its lemon and lime juice ‘will not so closely resemble in appearance the bottle of\ndefendant and its markings as to be liable to deceive a reasonably prudent buyer, exercising such\nordinary care and observation as shoppers generally may be expected to use so as to mislead such\nbuyer into believing that this bottle contains Puretex lemon or lime juice.’ The jury answered, ‘It\nwill not be likely to deceive.’ On this verdict, the court rendered judgment for plaintiff-California\nCalifornia Products, Inc. The judgment entered by the trial court reads, in part, as follows:\n‘That the terms of the agreed judgment entered by this Court on June 3, 1952, in Cause No. 1860,\nentitled Puretex Lemon Juice, Inc. v. California Products, Inc., and Charles H. Davis, properly\nconstrued, do not prohibit the use by Plaintiffs herein, in the marketing of lemon and lime juices,\nof a bottle resembling the said bottle of Defendant in any respect whatsoever, but the purport and\nmeaning thereof is to prevent the use by Plaintiffs of a bottle so resembling in appearance that of\nDefendant's bottle as to be calculated to mislead and deceive the buying public, and;\n\n‘That the use by Plaintiff, California Products, Inc. of its proposed bottle, above described in the\nmarketing of its lemon and lime juices will not be violative of, or inconsistent with, the injunction\nissued by this Court in said Cause No. 1860.’\n\n\nDefendant appealed to the Court of Civil Appeals. That Court reversed and rendered denying\nplaintiff and relief. The basis for the opinion of the Court of Civil Appeals was (1) plaintiffs had\nshown no justiciable interest, and were only seeking an advisory opinion from the Court and (2)\nthe trial court had no right to modify and change the terms of the judgment entered some five years\nin the past. 324 S.W.2d 449.\n\nWe granted the petition for writ of error on plaintiffs' first point. This asserted error by the Court\nof Civil Appeals in holding there was not an actual, real, or bona fide controversy between the\nparties. Petitioners-plaintiffs also have points on the error of the Court of Civil Appeals in holding\nthat the trial court had no right to modify and change the terms of the previous judgment.\n [1] All parties agree that there must be a justiciable controversy between the parties before a\ndeclaratory judgment action *589 will lie.

The Court of Civil Appeals has cited and discussed\nsome additional authorities and we will not repeat them.\n\n\n‘The rule with respect to the necessity for a justiciable controversy may be stated in the vernacular\nin this wise: The Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act does not license litigants to fish in judicial\nponds for legal advice.’ Anderson, Declaratory Judgments, 2d. Ed., Vol. 1, p. 47, quoting from\nLide v. Mears, 231 N.C. 111, 56 S.E.2d 404.\n\n **782 The case nearest in point to the case at bar which we have been able to find is the case of\nLadner v. Siegel, 1928, 294 Pa. 368, 144 A. 274, 275. Plaintiffs Ladners owned certain residences\non land purchased from defendant Siegel. On the remaining land adjoining plaintiffs' residences,\nSiegel proposed to erect a shopping center. One of the buildings was to be occupied by a garage\noperated for the general repair and service of automobiles for the public. The Ladners brought\nsuit against Siegel seeking to restrain him from erecting and occupying the garage as a violation\nof the residential district use. The Ladners won this suit and secured their injunction. That cause\nbecame final.\n\nThereafter Siegel filed a declaratory judgment action asking the court to fix his rights in the conduct\nof the garage in case it was carried on in such a way as not to constitute a private nuisance. The\ncourt was presented with the question of determining a method by which Siegel would operate the\ngarage, and then asked to determine whether or not such method of operation would be permitted\nin this residential district. The trial court entered a judgment setting out a method whereby the\ngarage could be operated so as not to constitute a private nuisance.\n\nOn appeal the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania says the crucial question is ‘do the circumstances\nhere disclosed give any jurisdiction to the court below to enter a declaratory judgment?’ *590 The\nCourt then quotes from the Declaratory Judgments Act which provides that courts of record ‘within\ntheir respective jurisdictions, shall have power to declare rights, status, and other legal relations'\nbetween parties where there is a real matter in controversy. These are the identical provisions in\nour statute-art. 2524-1, Vernon's Ann.Civ.St. The Court then says the Declaratory Judgments Act\ngives the court no power to grant advisory opinions, or to determine matters not essential to the\ndecision of the actual controversy although such questions may in the future require adjudication,\nor passing upon contingent or certain other situations. The court then says:\n         ‘* * * In the present case, the question of whether the use of the garage as now\n         contemplated would constitute an offensive business in the neighborhood, and\n         a private nuisance, affecting not only complainants, but others residing near by,\n         could not be determined until its actual operation at some future date.’\n\n\nAnd the Court further says:\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Thompson, Tex.Civ.App.1950, 232 S.W.2d 742, 751,\nref., n. r. e., it was said:\n‘The Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act does not provide for the giving of merely advisory\nopinions on the part of courts. In government this is a duty of the executive branch. In private\n *591 business it is the function of **783 the legal profession. City and County of Denver v.\nLynch, 92 Colo. 102, 18 P.2d 907, 86 A.L.R. 907.\n\n‘It is further a well established rule that a declaratory judgment should not be based upon\nfacts which are particularly subject to mutation and change as are the facts here. Anderson on\nDeclaratory Judgments, p. 195, s 72.’\n\n [2] A declaratory judgment rendered herein would not settle the controversy between the parties.\nThe permanent injunction in Cause No. 1860 is still outstanding. A violation of that judgment is\nsubject to be punished for contempt in a proper proceeding. It cannot be determined whether or\nnot a proposed bottle will be violative of the injunction issued on June 3, 1952 until California\nProducts seeks to market its product in a bottle in the same market with Puretex. Only in this way\ncan it be determined whether the California Products' bottle is of the size and appearance that it\nmisleads and deceives the buying public into believing that it is securing Puretex products rather\nthan California products.\n\n\nWe agree with the Court of Civil Appeals that this proceeding is one in which an advisory opinion\nis sought. Should we decide that the bottle proposed to be used by California Products did violate\nthe injunction, we would settle nothing. California could continue indefinitely to propose bottles of\ndifferent sizes, shapes and colors on which it could seek an equally indefinite number of advisory\nopinions as to whether such bottles violate the injunction.

Without reaching the merits, we hold that this action is not within the original\njurisdiction granted to this Court by either the Texas Constitution or the Legislature, and deny the\nmotion for leave to file the petition because Relators have an adequate remedy at law.\n\nBill Chenault, Roy Beene, and Miles Appleberry (Relators) filed an original petition in this Court\nseeking a declaration that the attorney occupation tax is unconstitutional, an injunction against\nthe officials responsible for collecting the tax, and writs prohibiting enforcement of the tax. 1\nRelators, members of the State Bar of Texas, argue that the statute's enforcement provision, which\nautomatically suspends the license of any attorney who does not timely pay the tax, deprives\nattorneys of their right to a full impartial hearing prior to the imposition of any sanction. Relators\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  1\n\fChenault v. Phillips, 914 S.W.2d 140 (1996)\n39 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 204\n\nfurther contend that the statute improperly infringes on this Court's inherent power to regulate\nthe legal profession in Texas, and that it violates the separation of powers provision of Article\nII, section one of the Texas Constitution by delegating the tax collection powers of the executive\nbranch to the judicial branch. Relators argue that this Court has jurisdiction over this original action\nunder Article III of the Texas Constitution, sections 22.001–.002 of the Government Code, and\nRules 121 and 122 of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n\n [1] [2] [3] This Court's jurisdiction, like that of all Texas courts, is conferred solely by the\nTexas Constitution and state statutes. We do not have jurisdiction to decide any case absent an\nexpress constitutional or statutory grant. See Pope v. Ferguson, 445 S.W.2d 950, 952 (Tex.1969),\ncert. denied, 397 U.S. 997, 90 S.Ct. 1138, 25 L.Ed.2d 405 (1970). A request for declaratory relief\nalone does not establish jurisdiction in this Court. We have held that the Uniform Declaratory\nJudgments Act, TEX.CIV.PRAC. & REM.CODE §§ 37.001–.011, is not a grant of jurisdiction,\nbut “merely a procedural device for deciding cases already within a court's jurisdiction.” State v.\nMorales, 869 S.W.2d 941, 947 (Tex.1994); see also Texas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control\nBd., 852 S.W.2d 440, 444 (Tex.1993). Likewise, we may not consider the merits of Relators'\nrequests for injunctions, writs of prohibition, and other relief under Rules 121 and 122 in a case\nnot otherwise properly before the Court. See Texas Employers' Ins. Ass'n v. Kirby, 137 Tex. 106,\n152 S.W.2d 1073, 1073 (1941).\n\n [4] [5] Relators also seek a writ of mandamus. Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy and\ngenerally is not available from any court in this state when a party has an adequate legal remedy.\nWalker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 840 (Tex.1992); Holloway v. Fifth Court of Appeals, 767\nS.W.2d 680, 684 (Tex.1989); State v. Walker, 679 S.W.2d 484, 485 (Tex.1984). Relators may\nfile their challenge to the Attorney Occupation Tax in district court and appeal any adverse ruling\nthrough the ordinary appellate process. They have not met their burden of showing that pursuing\ntheir claims first in the trial court will cause them to suffer any immediate harm that would entitle\nthem to mandamus relief under the Walker standard.\n\n *142 [6] [7] Moreover, this Court will not issue an original writ of mandamus absent a\n“compelling reason.” TEX.R.APP.P. 121(a); LaRouche v. Hannah, 822 S.W.2d 632, 633–34\n(Tex.1992); Sears v. Bayoud, 786 S.W.2d 248, 249–50 (Tex.1990). Relators assert as compelling\nreasons for the invocation of this Court's original jurisdiction the need to protect this Court's role\nas the ultimate supervisory authority over the State Bar of Texas, the presence of state officers as\nnecessary parties in the suit, and the statewide importance of the issue. None of these proffered\njurisdictional bases presents a compelling reason for this Court to exercise its original jurisdiction.\n\nRelators cite State Bar of Texas v. Gomez, 891 S.W.2d 243 (Tex.1994), as authority for the relief\nthey seek. In Gomez, several indigent litigants brought an action in district court to mandate that\nthe State Bar of Texas or this Court require all Texas attorneys to provide pro bono legal services.\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 204\n\nCentral to our decision in that case was this Court's exclusive administrative authority to regulate\nthe practice of law in Texas, an authority that “is derived from both statutory and inherent powers.”\nId. at 245. The State Bar, we held, is by itself powerless to address the harm alleged by the indigent\nlitigants, as its authority in this regard is limited to proposing regulations to the Court. We then\nrejected any attempt to involve the district court in the regulation of the practice of law: “[T]o\nthe extent the remedies are sought against the Supreme Court, they would clearly impinge on the\nCourt's exclusive authority to regulate the practice of law.... No subordinate court in Texas has the\npower to usurp our authority or responsibility in this area.” Id. at 246.\n\nRelators interpret this language as this Court's assumption of exclusive original jurisdiction over\nany action affecting attorneys in Texas. In so doing, they misconstrue our decision in Gomez.\nFirst, we observed that the Court's inherent powers, such as the power to regulate the bar,\nare administrative powers, not jurisdictional powers. Id. at 245. We then held that a district\ncourt could not impose a new requirement on Texas attorneys because “a district court has no\nauthority to assume this Court's authority to regulate the legal profession.” Id. at 246. Unlike the\nplaintiffs in Gomez, Relators do not seek imposition of new regulations on lawyers in Texas,\nbut rather challenge the constitutionality of a statute that affects lawyers. Yet, as we noted in\nGomez, constitutional challenges to rules enacted by this Court must be brought in the district\ncourt and heard by this Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction. “Had this Court\nactually promulgated rules establishing a pro bono program and had Gomez challenged the\nconstitutionality of such rules, the district court would have jurisdiction to decide, in the first\ninstance, whether such rules met constitutional standards.... Such a case would be justiciable\nbecause the district court would be capable of rendering a judgment that accords the parties\ncomplete relief, subject of course to appellate review.” Id. at 246. Analogously, Relators must\nfollow the same procedure in challenging the constitutionality of the Attorney Occupation Tax. A\nlitigant may not bring such a claim in the first instance in this Court.\n\nAccordingly, without hearing oral argument, see Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 122, a\nmajority of this Court overrules Relators' motion for leave to file an original petition for writ of\nmandamus and writs pursuant to Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure 121 and 122.\n\n\nParallel Citations\n\n39 Tex.

Rodriguez sued Woodling for negligence and, in the same case,\nRodriguez's automobile insurer, appellant Allstate County Mutual Insurance Company, seeking\ncoverage under an uninsured/underinsured motorist (UIM) policy. Rodriguez later amended his\npetition to add Woodling's insurer, appellant Farmers Insurance Exchange, seeking liability\ncoverage for Woodling under his homeowner's policy. In a pre-trial partial summary judgment,\nthe court declared the claims were covered by both insurance policies. At trial, the jury found\nno negligence on the part of Rodriguez, found that Woodling was negligent, and found that\nWoodling's negligence caused Rodriguez's damages. The primary issues on appeal pertain to\nthe trial court's subject matter jurisdiction over the claims against Farmers and interpretation of\nstandard form language in the Allstate automobile policy.\n\nFarmers appeals the trial court's grant of summary judgment against Farmers in favor of Rodriguez,\ndenial of Farmers' plea to the jurisdiction, and entry of declaratory judgment finding coverage\nunder the Farmers insurance policy. In three issues, Farmers contends the trial court lacked subject\nmatter jurisdiction over Rodriguez's claim against Farmers, the homeowner's policy issued by\nFarmers does not provide liability coverage for Woodling, and Rodriguez filed an impermissible\ndirect action against Farmers without satisfying conditions precedent in Woodling's insurance\npolicy. We hold the trial court erred by granting summary and declaratory judgments against\nFarmers and denying Farmers' plea to the jurisdiction because Rodriguez's claim against Farmers\nwas not ripe when the court made its rulings. We therefore reverse and render judgment dismissing\nRodriguez's claims against Farmers for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nAllstate appeals the trial court's summary judgment in favor of Rodriguez against Allstate and\ndeclaratory judgment finding coverage under the UIM policy. In four issues, Allstate contends its\npolicy does not cover Rodriguez's injury but the Farmers policy does. We hold the UIM provisions\nin Rodriguez's automobile policy provide coverage for his injury. We therefore affirm the trial\ncourt's summary judgment and declaratory judgment against Allstate.\n\n\n\n                                    Undisputed Factual Background\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  2\n\fFarmers Ins. Exchange v. Rodriguez, 366 S.W.3d 216 (2012)\n\n\n\nThe following facts are undisputed. Using a trailer hitched to his pickup truck, *220 Woodling 1\ntransported a deer stand from his deer lease to his residence. He pulled into his driveway and\nattempted to remove the deer stand from the trailer. He pushed the deer stand out of the trailer until\nthe legs on the stand touched the driveway. He left the stand resting at a 30–degree angle against\nthe trailer. He then attached a come-along 2 to a fence post and to the stand and attempted to raise\nthe stand upright. Realizing he could not accomplish the task alone, he requested assistance from\nhis neighbor, Rodriguez.\n\nRodriguez and Woodling decided to lift the stand manually by walking forward out of the trailer\nand onto the driveway. They began in the trailer, each using both hands to push the stand upward.\nThen they stepped onto the driveway and took “one or two” more steps. When the stand was no\nlonger touching the trailer, Woodling realized it was too heavy and yelled, “Juan, I can't hold it.\nJump.” Woodling then jumped away, leaving Rodriguez alone to hold the stand, which weighed\napproximately 350 pounds. The stand fell, and Rodriguez was injured.\n\nThe liability provisions of the Farmers homeowners policy contain the following exclusion for\nbodily injury claims: “arising out of the ownership, maintenance, operation, use, loading or\nunloading of ... trailers [or] semi-trailers” except for “trailers or semitrailers while not being towed\nby or carried on a motor vehicle.”\n\nRodriguez's Allstate automobile policy included UIM coverage for damages Rodriguez was\n“legally entitled to recover from the owner ... of an uninsured [or underinsured] motor vehicle\n[including any type of trailer] because of bodily injury sustained by [Rodriguez and] caused by an\naccident.” Under the Allstate policy, the uninsured or underinsured owner's liability must “arise\nout of the ownership, maintenance or use of the uninsured motor vehicle.” (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n\n                                             Procedural History\n\nRodriguez filed suit against Woodling and Allstate on June 2, 2008, asserting a negligence claim\nagainst Woodling and a claim against Allstate for UIM coverage. Rodriguez amended his petition\non September 16, 2008, adding Farmers as a defendant and seeking declarations that the exclusion\nfrom liability coverage in the Farmers policy did not apply or, alternatively, that Rodriguez's\ndamages arose from the use of a trailer covered by the Allstate policy.\n\nFarmers filed a motion to sever, contending Rodriguez's joinder of Farmers was improper. 3\nRodriguez moved for partial summary judgment against Farmers, seeking a declaration that\nFarmers had a contractual obligation to indemnify Woodling. Farmers moved for summary\njudgment based on improper joinder, lack of ripeness, and applicability of its “trailers or semi-\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Allstate moved for summary judgment, asserting that the accident did not arise\nout of the use of an uninsured motor vehicle so that the Allstate policy did not apply. The trial\ncourt granted Rodriguez's motion and denied motions filed by Allstate and Farmers. In a combined\nplea to the jurisdiction and motion to vacate the court's order granting partial summary judgment,\nFarmers reasserted its jurisdictional arguments *221 before trial of the underlying personal injury\nclaim. The court denied the combined motion.\n\nBefore trial, Allstate, while contesting coverage under its policy, stipulated to be bound by the\njury's findings on negligence and damages. The jury found Woodling 100% negligent and awarded\ndamages to Rodriguez totaling $233,123.71. Rodriguez subsequently filed a motion for summary\njudgment against Allstate, seeking a declaration that his injuries were covered under the Allstate\npolicy, which the trial court granted. After reducing the jury award based on the amount of\nRodriguez's incurred medical expenses, the trial court entered judgment awarding Rodriguez\n$211,618.42, plus interest and costs, and declaring that Rodriguez's injuries were covered under\nboth the Farmers and Allstate policies.\n\n\n\n                                            Standards of Review\n\nTraditional Summary Judgment.\nTo prevail on a traditional Rule 166a(c) summary-judgment motion, a movant must prove that\nthere is no genuine issue regarding any material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter\nof law. See Tex.R. Civ. P. 166a(c); Little v. Tex. Dep't of Criminal Justice, 148 S.W.3d 374, 381\n(Tex.2004). A plaintiff moving for a traditional summary judgment must conclusively prove all\nessential elements of its claim. See Rhone–Poulenc, Inc. v. Steel, 997 S.W.2d 217, 223 (Tex.1999).\n\nA defendant may prevail by traditional summary judgment if it conclusively negates at least one\nessential element of a plaintiff's cause of action. See IHS Cedars Treatment Ctr. of DeSoto, Tex.,\nInc. v. Mason, 143 S.W.3d 794, 798 (Tex.2004). A movant seeking traditional summary judgment\non an affirmative defense has the initial burden of establishing entitlement to judgment as a matter\nof law by conclusively establishing each element of his affirmative defense. See Chau v. Riddle,\n254 S.W.3d 453, 455 (Tex.2008); see also Tex.R. Civ. P. 166a(b)-(c). A matter is conclusively\nestablished if reasonable people could not differ as to the conclusion to be drawn from the evidence.\nSee City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 816 (Tex.2005).\n\nIf the movant meets its burden, the burden then shifts to the nonmovant to raise a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact precluding summary judgment. See Centeq Realty, Inc. v. Siegler, 899 S.W.2d 195,\n197 (Tex.1995). The evidence raises a genuine issue of fact if reasonable and fair-minded jurors\ncould differ in their conclusions in light of all of the summary-judgment evidence. Goodyear Tire\n& Rubber Co. v. Mayes, 236 S.W.3d 754, 755 (Tex.2007).\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   4\n\fFarmers Ins. Exchange v. Rodriguez, 366 S.W.3d 216 (2012)\n\n\n\n\nOn appeal, we review de novo a trial court's summary judgment ruling. See Mann Frankfort Stein\n& Lipp Advisors, Inc. v. Fielding, 289 S.W.3d 844, 848 (Tex.2009). In our review, we consider\nall the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, crediting evidence favorable to\nthe nonmovant if reasonable jurors could, and disregarding contrary evidence unless reasonable\njurors could not. See Mack Trucks, Inc. v. Tamez, 206 S.W.3d 572, 582 (Tex.2006). When, as\nhere, the parties file competing motions for summary judgment and the trial court grants one\nmotion and denies the other, this court should review both parties' summary-judgment evidence\nand determine all questions presented. Valence Operating Co. v. Dorsett, 164 S.W.3d 656, 661\n(Tex.2005); English v. B.G.P. Int'l, Inc., 174 S.W.3d 366, 370 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.]\n2005, no pet.).\n\n\nSubject-matter jurisdiction.\n [1] [2] [3] The absence of subject-matter jurisdiction may be raised by a plea to the *222\njurisdiction or another procedural vehicle such as a motion for summary judgment. Bland Indep.\nSch. Dist. v. Blue, 34 S.W.3d 547, 554 (Tex.2000). 4 When a plea to the jurisdiction challenges\njurisdictional facts, as here, we consider the evidence submitted by the parties. Stinson v. Ins. Co.\nof Penn., 286 S.W.3d 77, 83 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2009, pet. denied). The standard of\nreview for a jurisdictional plea based on evidence generally mirrors that of a traditional motion\nfor summary judgment. Id.\n\n\nDeclaratory judgment.\n [4] [5] In reviewing a declaratory judgment, we refer to the procedure for resolution of the issue\nat trial to determine the applicable standard of review on appeal. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code\n§ 37.010; English, 174 S.W.3d at 370; see also Gen. Agents Ins. Co. of Am. v. El Naggar, 340\nS.W.3d 552, 557 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2011, pet. denied). Here, because the trial court\nimplicitly resolved the declaratory judgment issues by ruling on motions for summary judgment,\nwe review the propriety of the trial court's grant of the declaratory judgments under the same\nstandards applicable for review of summary judgments. English, 174 S.W.3d at 370. Therefore, we\nmust determine whether the trial court properly granted Rodriguez's declaratory judgment requests\nand, if not, enter the judgment which should have been entered by the trial court. Id.\n\n\n\n                                Jurisdiction over Claim against Farmers\n\n [6] In its third issue, Fanners contends Rodriguez lacked standing to sue Farmers and Rodriguez's\nclaim against Farmers was not ripe, depriving the trial court of subject-matter jurisdiction. We\nagree with Farmers that Rodriguez's claim was not ripe. 5\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   5\n\fFarmers Ins. Exchange v. Rodriguez, 366 S.W.3d 216 (2012)\n\n\n\n\n [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Ripeness is a threshold issue that implicates subject-matter jurisdiction.\nRobinson v. Parker, 353 S.W.3d 753, 755 (Tex.2011). In evaluating ripeness, courts consider\n“whether, at the time a lawsuit is filed, the facts are sufficiently developed ‘so that an injury has\noccurred or is likely to occur, rather than being contingent or remote.’ ” Id. (emphasis in orig.)\n(citation omitted). Although a claim is not required to be ripe at the time of filing, if a party cannot\ndemonstrate a reasonable likelihood that the claim will soon ripen, the case must be dismissed. Id.\nA case is not ripe when resolution depends on contingent or hypothetical facts, or upon events that\nhave not yet come to pass. Id. at 756 (citing Waco Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Gibson, 22 S.W.3d 849, 852\n(Tex.2000)). “[T]he essence of the ripeness doctrine is to avoid premature adjudication ... [and] to\nhold otherwise would be the essence of an advisory opinion, advising what the law would be on\na hypothetical set of facts.” Id. (citing Patterson v. Planned Parenthood of Houston and Se. Tex.,\n971 S.W.2d 439, 444 (Tex.1998)) (second alteration in original).\n\n*223 [12]       [13] A tort claimant has no direct claim against the tortfeasor's liability insurer until\nthe insured tortfeasor is adjudged liable to the tort claimant. 6 Angus Chem. Co. v. IMC Fertilizer,\nInc., 939 S.W.2d 138, 138 (Tex.1997) (per curiam); State Farm Cnty. Mut. Ins. Co. of Tex. v. Ollis,\n768 S.W.2d 722, 723 (Tex.1989) (per curiam); Great Am. Ins. Co. v. Murray, 437 S.W.2d 264,\n265 (Tex.1969). A party injured by the insured is a third-party beneficiary of a liability insurance\npolicy, but he cannot enforce the policy directly against the insurer until it has been established,\nby final judgment or agreement, that the insured has a legal obligation to pay damages to the\ninjured party. Ollis, 768 S.W.2d at 723. It is undisputed that when the trial court granted Rodriguez\nsummary judgment against Farmers, Woodling's obligation to pay damages to Rodriguez had not\nbeen established by final judgment or by agreement. Therefore, Rodriguez's claim against Farmer's\nwas not ripe when the trial court granted summary judgment. See Certain Underwriters at Lloyds,\nLondon v. Four J's Cmty. Living Ctr., Inc., No. H–11–0713, 2011 WL 6026689, at *1–2 (S.D.Tex.\nDec. 2, 2011) (holding that, under Texas law, tort plaintiff did not yet have claim under tort\ndefendant's insurance policy because final judgment had not yet been rendered upon jury verdict\nin plaintiff's favor); Robinson, 353 S.W.3d at 755–56 (holding that declaratory-judgment claims\nwere not yet ripe because there was no showing that claimants had suffered a concrete injury);\nGibson, 22 S.W.3d at 853 (noting that to allow premature adjudication of contingent situations\nwould “eschew the ripeness doctrine” and “create an impermissible advisory opinion.”).\n\nThough a claim is not required to be ripe at the time of filing, if a party cannot demonstrate a\nreasonable likelihood that the claim will soon ripen, the case must be dismissed. See Robinson,\n353 S.W.3d at 755. The record does not reflect any agreement establishing Woodling's obligation\nto pay Rodriguez damages. 7 Therefore, Rodriguez cannot demonstrate a reasonable likelihood\nthat his claims against Farmers will soon ripen in the case under review, and these claims must be\ndismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.

Rodriguez, 366 S.W.3d 216 (2012)\n\n\n\nIn Firemen's Insurance Co. v. Burch, the Supreme Court of Texas held that there can be no\njusticiable controversy regarding the insurer's duty to indemnify before a judgment has been\nrendered against an insured. 442 S.W.2d 331, 332–34 (Tex.1968). The supreme court has\nrecognized a limited exception to this rule that applies “when the insurer has no duty to defend\nand the same reasons that negate the duty to defend likewise negate any possibility the insurer\nwill ever have a duty to indemnify.” Farmers Tex. Cnty. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Griffin, 955 S.W.2d 81,\n84 (Tex.1997) (emphasis in original); see also D.R. Horton–Tex., Ltd. v. Markel Int'l Ins. Co., 300\nS.W.3d 740, 744 (Tex.2009).\n\nRodriguez sued Farmers seeking payment based on Farmers' purported duty to indemnify\nWoodling. While generally acknowledging that a third party may not *224 sue an insurance\ncompany for payment under its policy without a judgment against the insured, Rodriguez argues\nthe exception recognized in Griffin should be applied here because “undisputed facts pertaining\nto the duty to indemnify ... were included in the summary judgment record [and] are consistent\nwith the factual record at trial and the fact-finder's disposition of the personal injury lawsuit.” We\nfind no merit in this argument.\n\n [14] [15] [16] The holding in Griffin pertained to an underlying tort suit for injuries sustained in\na drive-by shooting. D.R Horton–Tex., Ltd., 300 S.W.3d at 744–45 (citing Griffin, 955 S.W.2d at\n84). The policy in that case excluded coverage for intentional torts. Griffin, 955 S.W.2d at 83. The\nGriffin court thus concluded no “conceivable set of facts” could be developed in the underlying\ncase that would transform the intentional shooting into an auto accident covered by the policy.\nD.R. Horton–Tex., Ltd., 300 S.W.3d at 745. The court held that the duty to indemnify may be\nadjudicated before judgment is entered on the claim against the insured, when the facts negate both\nthe duty to defend and the duty to indemnify. 8 Griffin, 955 S.W.2d at 84. Here, the duty to defend\nis not at issue. 9 More importantly, even though the parties do not dispute the underlying accident\nfacts, the jury was required to decide and apportion liability before judgment could be entered.\nThus, when the lawsuit was filed, coverage of Rodriguez's injury under the Farmers policy was\ncontingent on the jury's future liability finding, if any, including apportionment between Woodling\nand Rodriguez. The Griffin exception is inapplicable. See D.R. Horton–Tex., Ltd., 300 S.W.3d at\n743–45 (distinguishing Griffin ); Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Nat'l Union Fire\nIns. Co. of Pittsburgh, PA., 334 S.W.3d 217, 219–20 (Tex.2011) (same). We hold that Rodriguez's\nclaims against Farmers were not ripe and that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to grant summary\njudgment against Farmers declaring coverage under the Farmers policy. The trial court erred in\ndenying Farmers' plea to the jurisdiction, and the proper remedy is to reverse the trial court's\njudgment as to Rodriguez's claims against Farmers and render judgment dismissing these claims\nfor lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nWe sustain Farmers' third issue.\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Rodriguez, 366 S.W.3d 216 (2012)\n\n\n\n\n                        Coverage of Rodriguez's Injury by the Allstate Policy\n\n [17] In two issues, Allstate argues the trial court erred by denying its summary judgment motion\nagainst Rodriguez, granting summary judgment in favor of Rodriguez, and declaring that UIM\nlanguage in his automobile policy provide coverage for his injury. In reference to the “use”\nexclusion, Allstate contends that “loading and unloading” a trailer is not use as contemplated under\nthe Allstate policy, and even if it were, there is no coverage because Rodriguez's injury did not\n“arise out of” the use of the trailer. We are not persuaded by these arguments.\n\nThe Allstate policy specifies that liability of the owner of an uninsured or underinsured vehicle\n“must arise out of the ownership, *225 maintenance, or use of the uninsured motor vehicle.” 10\n(Emphasis added.) The term “use” is not defined in the policy. Allstate urges us to hold that\n“loading and unloading” is excluded because the “use” clause omits these activities as a matter\nof law. We decline to do so.\n\n [18] [19] Automobile insurers in Texas are required to provide UIM coverage in all policies.\nThe quoted language from the Allstate policy mirrors statutory requirements. See Tex. Ins.Code\n§ 1952.101(a). The purpose of UIM coverage is to protect conscientious drivers from financial\nloss caused by irresponsible parties, and courts liberally construe the UIM statutes. Tex. Farm\nBureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sturrock, 146 S.W.3d 123, 128 (Tex.2004); Stracener v. United Servs.\nAuto. Ass'n, 777 S.W.2d 378, 382 (Tex.1989). Texas state and federal courts applying Texas law\nhave concluded that automobile liability policies may cover loading and unloading of a vehicle\neven when those terms are not specifically included in the policy. See, e.g., EMCASCO Ins. Co.\nv. Am. Int'l Specialty Lines Ins. Co., 438 F.3d 519, 525 (5th Cir.2006); Panhandle Steel Prods.\nCo. v. Fidelity Union Cas. Co., 23 S.W.2d 799, 801 (Tex.Civ.App.-Fort Worth 1929, no writ)\n(holding injury of passerby that occurred after iron beam was unloaded from truck and was being\ncarried across sidewalk was result of use of truck). The parties have not cited, and research has\nnot revealed, any Texas cases construing UIM policies that have held the term “use” without a\n“loading and unloading” clause excludes coverage for loading and unloading.\n\n [20] Allstate cites Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. v. American Employers Insurance Co., 556\nS.W.2d 242 (Tex.1977) for the proposition that the inclusion of a “loading and unloading”\nendorsement in an insurance policy expands coverage from the coverage afforded by the phrase\n“ownership, maintenance, or use.” Id. at 244. But the court in Liberty Mutual did not construe UIM\ncoverage or the “ownership, maintenance, or use” clause. 11 It analyzed whether injured workers\nwere “borrowers” of the automobile to determine if they were insured persons under the policy. 12\nId. Liberty Mutual does not hold that the “use” of a vehicle may never include “loading and\nunloading” merely because the policy does not include those terms. See id. Moreover, the intent to\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 8\n\fFarmers Ins. Exchange v.

Hudson Energy Co., 811 S.W.2d 552, 555 (Tex.1991). If Allstate\nintended to exclude loading and unloading from the scope of coverage, then it was incumbent\nupon it to expressly and clearly state the exclusion in the policy. See Nat'l Auto. & Cas. Ins. Co. v.\nGlens Falls Ins. Co., 493 S.W.2d 909, 911–12 (Tex.Civ.App.-Tyler 1973, no writ) (holding clause\nexpressly excluding “loading and unloading” of vehicle was effective). Having failed to do so,\nAllstate may not now complain. 13 See Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co., 811 S.W.2d at 555.\n\n [21] [22] [23] Allstate further argues that Rodriguez's injuries did not “arise out of” any use\nof the trailer. We disagree. Texas courts broadly define “use” of a motor vehicle in the context of\ninsurance policies. Mid–Continent Cas. Co. v. Global Enercom Mgmt., Inc., 323 S.W.3d 151, 156\n(Tex.2010). It is a “general catchall ..., designed and construed to include all proper uses of the\nvehicle.” Lyons v. State Farm Lloyds & Nat'l Cas. Co., 41 S.W.3d 201, 205 (Tex.App.-Houston\n[14th Dist.] 2001, pet. denied) (citing State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Pan Am. Ins. Co., 437\nS.W.2d 542, 545 (Tex.1969)). “Use” means “to put into action or service; to employ for or apply to\na given purpose.” Id. (citing LeLeaux v. Hamshire–Fannett I.S.D., 835 S.W.2d 49, 51 (Tex.1992)).\nIn Mid–Century Ins. Co. of Tex. v. Lindsey, 997 S.W.2d 153 (Tex.1999), the court employed the\nfollowing factors suggested in two insurance treatises 14 to help determine when a motor vehicle\nhas been in “use” under a similar UIM insuring provision:\n\n\n  For an injury to fall within the “use” coverage of an automobile policy (1) the accident must\n  have arisen out of the inherent nature of the automobile, as such; (2) the accident must have\n  arisen within the natural territorial limits of an automobile, and the actual use must not have\n  terminated; (3) the automobile must not merely contribute to cause the condition which produces\n  the injury, but must itself produce the injury. 15\nId. at 157. 16\n\nUsing the factors elucidated in Lindsey as a framework, and taking into consideration the broad\ndefinition of “use” recognized in Texas jurisprudence, we conclude that Rodriguez's injury resulted\nfrom use of the trailer as a matter of law.\n\n *227 Inherent nature. It is in the inherent nature of a trailer that it will be used to haul and tow\nmaterials. Cf. Mid–Continent Cas. Co., 323 S.W.3d at 155 (“[I]t is in the inherent nature of a 2000\nFord F–250 Super Duty pickup truck on a cell tower job site that it will be used to haul and tow\nmaterials.”); Panhandle Steel Prods. Co., 23 S.W.2d at 801 (holding, when delivery of material\nwas main purpose of haul, “loading and unloading were as necessary to accomplish that purpose\nas was the driving of the truck from plaintiff's place of business to the point of delivery”). That\nprocess includes not only the immediate action of loading and unloading materials from the trailer\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Rodriguez, 366 S.W.3d 216 (2012)\n\n\n\nbut also moving them from their starting point to their destination. 17 See Liberty Mut. Ins. Co.,\n556 S.W.2d at 244; Travelers Ins. Co. v. Emp'r's Cas. Co., 380 S.W.2d 610, 612 (Tex.1964);\nPanhandle Steel Prods. Co., 23 S.W.2d at 801. Using a trailer in this manner is “not an unexpected\nor unnatural use of the vehicle.” See Mid–Continent Cas. Co., 323 S.W.3d at 155 (citing Lindsey,\n997 S.W.2d at 158); Commercial Standard Ins. Co., 455 S.W.2d at 717.\n\nNatural territorial limits. The accident was within the “natural territorial limits” of the trailer,\neven though Woodling and Rodriguez had taken a few steps out of the trailer. In Mid–Continent\nCasualty Company and Lindsey, this factor was satisfied even though both accidents occurred\noutside the insured vehicles. See Mid–Continent Cas. Co., 323 S.W.3d at 155 (holding injuries\nsustained when rope that was anchored on one end to the truck broke arose from use of truck);\nLindsey, 997 S.W.2d at 160 (holding injury arose out of use of truck when child entered through\nsliding rear window and accidentally discharged loaded shotgun mounted over rear window,\ninjuring person in nearby vehicle, because child did not stray from purpose of entering truck by\nplaying with gun or trying to shoot it).\n\n [24] [25] The Supreme Court has adopted the complete operation doctrine, which defines the\nterms “loading and unloading” in the context of an insurance policy. “ ‘[L]oading and unloading’\nembraces not only the immediate transference of the goods to or from the vehicle, but also the\ncomplete operation of transporting the goods between the vehicle and the place from or to which\nthey are being delivered.” Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 556 S.W.2d at 244; Travelers Ins. Co., 380\nS.W.2d at 612. 18 Any activities involved in moving the goods to their final physical destination\nare themselves included in the term “unloading” and thus qualify as a use of the vehicle for\ninsurance purposes. See Travelers Ins. Co., 380 S.W.2d at 613–14. The court noted, “[w]hen a\nvehicle is being unloaded it is being used to the same extent as if it were being driven, and the\nperson doing the unloading is entitled to the same protection as the owner or operator.” Id. at\n614; see also Commercial *228 Standard Ins. Co. v. Am. Gen. Ins. Co., 455 S.W.2d 714, 716–17\n(Tex.1970) (quoting Travelers Ins. Co.). We conclude under these circumstances that Woodling\nand Rodriguez were using the trailer when the accident occurred.\n\n [26] Cause. The third factor is whether the vehicle produced the injury. Lindsey, 997 S.W.2d at\n157. The Supreme Court of Texas has stated that the causation inquiry in this context involves\n“but for” causation. Mid–Continent Cas. Co., 323 S.W.3d at 156. A but for cause is “one without\nwhich the event would not have occurred.” Transcon. Ins. Co. v. Crump, 330 S.W.3d 211, 223\n(Tex.2010).\n\nRodriguez's accident would not have occurred if Rodriguez had not been assisting Woodling in\nunloading the deer stand from the trailer. See Mid–Continent Cas. Co., 323 S.W.3d at 156 (holding\nrope would not have broken causing injuries if truck had not been used to hoist headache ball).\nThe accident did not merely happen near the trailer: Woodling and Rodriguez could not have\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Rodriguez, 366 S.W.3d 216 (2012)\n\n\n\naccomplished the same result without the presence of the trailer, and, as we have noted, the use of\na trailer includes unloading materials. See id.; Panhandle Steel Prods. Co., 23 S.W.2d at 802. 19\nThe trial court properly found the “use” clause in Allstate's policy covered Rodriguez's injury.\n\nThis case is not controlled by the cases cited by Allstate in support of its argument that the accident\nwas not caused by the use of a trailer as such. The cases cited by Allstate regarding UIM policies\ninvolved intentional shootings from one vehicle into another that were held to be incidental to the\nuse of the vehicles. See, e.g., State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Whitehead, 988 S.W.2d 744, 745\n(Tex.1999); Collier v. Emp'rs Nat'l Ins. Co., 861 S.W.2d 286, 289 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.]\n1993, writ denied). Here, as we have held, Rodriguez was injured while he was unloading the\ntrailer—which was a proper use—so his injury was not merely incidental to the use of the trailer.\n\n [27] [28] National Union Fire Insurance Co. v. Merchants Fast Motor Lines, Inc., 939 S.W.2d\n139 (Tex.1997) involved a duty to defend. An insurer's duty to defend is determined from the four\ncorners of the pleadings and the language of the insurance policy. Id. at 141. In such cases, if the\npetition does not allege facts within the scope of coverage, the insurer is not required to defend a\nsuit against its insured. Id. The petition in National Union alleged only that a driver was operating\nthe insured's truck when he negligently discharged a firearm injuring the plaintiff. Id. at 142. The\ninsurance policy only covered claims where the injury was caused by an accident resulting from\nthe use of a covered auto. Id. Accordingly, the allegations did not give rise to a duty to defend by\nthe insurer. Id.; see also Mid–Continent Cas. Co., 323 S.W.3d at 156. Here, we are not dealing\nwith the duty to defend; thus, the same pleading standard does not apply. 20\n\n *229 [29] The other two cases cited by Allstate were not insurance coverage cases, but instead\ninvolved claims under the Texas Torts Claims Act (TTCA). The TTCA waives governmental\nimmunity for “property damage, personal injury, or death aris[ing] from the operation or use\nof a motor driven vehicle.” 21 LeLeaux, 835 S.W.2d at 51 (citing Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code\n§ 101.021(1)(A)). The required “operation or use” under the TTCA is by the governmental\nemployee. Id. LeLeaux involved a school bus that was not in operation when a student jumped up\nfrom where she had been sitting in the open rear doorway of the empty school bus and hit her head\non the door frame. 835 S.W.2d at 51. The court held that the injury did not arise from the use of the\nbus because the driver was not aboard when the injury occurred—in other words, the injury did\nnot arise from the school district's or its driver's operation or use of the bus—and immunity was\nnot waived. Id. at 52. Brown v. Houston Independent School District, 123 S.W.3d 618 (Tex.App.-\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2003, pet. denied), involved an officer who pulled over a woman in his patrol\ncar and sexually assaulted her in her own vehicle. Id. at 619. Thus, the assault did not occur in\nthe patrol car, but in a vehicle which was not operated by the officer. Id. at 622; see also Mid–\nContinent Cas. Co., 323 S.W.3d at 156. Here, by contrast, the use of the vehicle covered by the\nAllstate policy was not similarly limited to a particular user. Moreover, Rodriguez's injury arose\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   11\n\fFarmers Ins. Exchange v. Rodriguez, 366 S.W.3d 216 (2012)\n\n\n\nfrom using the trailer as a trailer while he was unloading it. See Mid–Continent Cas. Co., 323\nS.W.3d at 155; Lindsey, 997 S.W.2d at 160.\n\nWe hold that the trial court did not err by rendering summary judgment against Allstate in favor of\nRodriguez and by declaring that Woodling's liability arose from the use of the trailer. We overrule\nAllstate's first and second issues.\n\n\n\n                                                              Conclusion\n\nWe hold that Rodriguez's claims against Farmers were not ripe and thus the trial court did not have\njurisdiction to enter a judgment against Farmers. Therefore, as to the claims against Farmers, we\nreverse the trial court's judgment and render judgment that these claims be dismissed for lack of\nsubject-matter jurisdiction.\n\nWe further hold that the trial court did not err by entering summary judgment and declaratory\njudgment in favor of Rodriguez against Allstate. We affirm that portion of the declaratory\njudgment finding Woodling's liability arose from “use” of the trailer and finding coverage over\nRodriguez's injury under the Allstate policy.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    Woodling is not a party to this appeal.\n\n2    A come-along is a tool used for moving heavy loads or for tightening wire. COLLINS ENGLISH DICTIONARY (2003 ed.).\n\n3    The record does not show whether the trial court ruled on that motion.\n\n4    Thus, it was appropriate for Farmers to assert in its summary-judgment motion that the trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction.\n        See Blue, 34 S.W.3d at 554. Farmers subsequently filed a plea to the jurisdiction on the same jurisdictional grounds.\n5       Accordingly, we do not reach the other issues presented by Farmers regarding whether Rodriguez's injury was covered by the Farmers\n        policy, whether Rodriguez filed an impermissible direct action against Farmers without first satisfying conditions precedent in the\n        policy, or whether Rodriguez had standing to bring his claim against Farmers. We likewise do not reach two of Allstate's issues\n        asserting that Rodriguez's injuries are covered under the Farmers policy (issues three and four).\n6       This principle applies where the insurance policy contains a so-called “no action” provision. See Struna v. Concord Ins. Servs., Inc.,\n        11 S.W.3d 355, 359 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2000, no pet.). Section I, ¶ 11 of the Farmers policy is a “no action” provision.\n7       Rodriguez cannot obtain a final judgment against Woodling until Rodriguez's claim against Farmers is adjudicated because Farmers\n        and Woodling are both parties. But Rodriguez's claim is not ripe and cannot be adjudicated until after Rodriguez obtains a final\n        judgment against Woodling.\n8       The duty to indemnify requires payment of all covered claims and judgments against an insured, whereas the duty to defend requires\n        tender of a defense in any lawsuit brought against the insured that seeks damages for an event potentially covered by the policy. D.R.\n        Horton–Tex., Ltd., 300 S.W.3d at 743. An insurer's duty to defend is justiciable before the entry of judgment on a claim against the\n        insured. See English, 174 S.W.3d at 371.\n9       Rodriguez's injury, moreover, did not arise from an intentional tort.\n\n10      The policy defines “uninsured motor vehicle” to include underinsured motor vehicles.\n\n11      The commercial policy in Liberty Mutual included “loading and unloading.”\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Rodriguez, 366 S.W.3d 216 (2012)\n\n\n\n12    Liberty Mutual involved competing automobile and general liability policies. Id. at 243. The automobile policy excluded\n      nonemployees of the insured unless they were “borrowers” of vehicles owned by the insured. Id. A “borrower” was defined by the\n      court as “someone who has, with permission of the owner, temporary possession and use of the property of another for his own\n      purposes.” Id. at 244. Before the addition of the loading and unloading endorsement to the standard automobile liability policy, neither\n      the automobile policy nor the standard liability policy defined which insurer had liability coverage for injuries sustained upon the\n      premises of one who was insured under a general liability policy during the loading and unloading of a vehicle not owned or hired\n      by the general liability insured. Id. The court concluded the policy exclusion for persons who were unloaders but not “borrowers”\n      of the vehicle was intended to limit the insurer's liability for injuries of nonemployees who were not borrowers of the vehicle. Id. at\n      245. By contrast, the Allstate policy covers injuries to Rodriguez caused by the owner or operator of an uninsured or underinsured\n      motor vehicle, including “trailer[s] of any type.” It does not expressly limit Allstate's liability based on whether an injured party is\n      a “borrower” of a vehicle.\n13    Allstate also cites an unreported federal district court's opinion that held a “use” clause (without “loading and unloading” language)\n      would not cover injuries sustained by a patient who travelled in an ambulance to the hospital. See St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v.\n      Am. Int'l Surplus Lines Ins. Co., No. 3:95–CV–0790–D, 1997 WL 160192, at *3–4 (N.D.Tex. Mar. 31, 1997). The court held that “the\n      acts of providing emergency medical care and of carrying a person from some location to an ambulance are ... a necessary incident to\n      the operation of an ambulance service, but are not fairly described as the use of an ambulance.” Id. at *3. The inclusion of a loading\n      and unloading clause would not alter the court's reasoning or result.\n14    See 6B JOHN A. APPLEMAN, INSURANCE LAW AND PRACTICE § 4317, at 367–69 (Buckley ed. 1979); 8A COUCH ON\n      INSURANCE 3d § 119:37, at 119–56 (2005).\n15    The Lindsey court noted this is not an “absolute test,” but the factors are helpful in focusing the analysis. 997 S.W.2d at 157–58; see\n      also Mid–Continent Cas. Co., 323 S.W.3d at 155 n. 4. The test is only a conceptual framework to analyze the inclusion or exclusion\n      at issue. Mid–Continent Cas. Co., 323 S.W.3d at 155 n. 4\n16    The court acknowledged that the third factor may be difficult to define because it is not always clear how the vehicle, as opposed to\n      other things, contributed to an accident. Lindsey, 997 S.W.2d at 157; see also Mid–Continent Cas. Co., 323 S.W.3d at 156.\n17    Here, the parties do not dispute that the deer stand did not reach its final destination.\n\n18    The cited cases that apply the complete operation doctrine involved third party claims arising from liability provisions of standard\n      automobile insurance policies, whereas this case involves a liability claim arising under a UIM provision. Liberty Mutual and\n      Travelers Insurance Company, however, both construe language in standard automobile policies that is identical to the language\n      in the Allstate UIM provision providing coverage for injuries “aris[ing] out of the ownership, maintenance, or use” of the insured\n      vehicle. See Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 556 S.W.2d at 243 n. 1; Travelers Ins. Co., 380 S.W.2d at 612. The UIM policy, moreover,\n      expressly covers as an “[u]ninsured motor vehicle” “a land motor vehicle or trailer of any type.” (Emphasis added.) Thus, the same\n      principles apply here.\n19    [S]ince the act of unloading was one of the natural and necessary steps to the undertaking to deliver the [truck's contents], and followed\n      in natural sequence the use of the truck to that end, which use was specifically contemplated and covered by the policy, we believe\n      that the conclusion is unavoidable that the use of the truck was the primary and efficient cause of the injury, even though it should\n      not be held to be the proximate cause.\n         Panhandle Steel Prods. Co., 23 S.W.2d at 802.\n20    Lindsey, by contrast to National Union, was not a duty-to-defend case, but involved an action to recover UIM benefits, as in this\n      case. See 997 S.W.2d at 154. Thus, the allegations in the petition were not at issue. The plaintiff proved the vehicle was in use at\n      the time of the accident because the child's “sole purpose was to gain entry into the truck” through the back window and he did not\n      stray from that purpose. Lindsey, 997 S.W.2d at 158. He did not play with the gun or try to shoot it. Id.; see also Mid–Continent\n      Cas.

Because many of the\narguments raised by the parties invoke issues of error preservation or waiver, we decline to grant\neither party the relief it seeks.\n\n *605 Petitioner Guaranty Bank 1 asks us to review the court of appeals' judgment in favor of\nrespondent Christa Lenk, and, in a cross-petition, Lenk seeks a remand to the trial court for a\ndetermination of attorney's fees. The facts of this case closely mirror those of Jefferson State\nBank v. Lenk, 323 S.W.3d 146 (Tex.2010). In both cases, bank customers died intestate. Shortly\nthereafter, Melvyn Spillman, a former Bexar County probate clerk and former employee of the\ncounty medical examiner, presented false letters of administration to both banks and gained\naccess to both deceased customers' accounts. Spillman subsequently used both accounts to make\nseveral transactions, ultimately withdrawing most of the accounts' funds. 2 Unlike Jefferson State\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Spillman was eventually arrested for\nperpetuating these frauds.\n\nIn September 2003, the probate court appointed Lenk administrator of both decedents' estates.\nThough aware of Spillman's fraudulent activities when she was appointed, Lenk made no attempt\nto recover funds from either bank until June 2005, when she demanded that each bank return the\nfull amounts withdrawn by Spillman. Both banks refused to comply, and, on June 27, 2005, Lenk\nfiled identical causes of action against the banks. In each pleading, she claimed the bank breached\nthe deposit agreement by refusing her payment demand. Lenk also argued that she was entitled to\nall sums in each account since the time of the decedent's death. 3\n\nIn each suit, the bank and Lenk moved for summary judgment, and the trial court granted each\nbank's motion and denied Lenk's. The court of appeals reversed in favor of Lenk in both matters.\nSee Lenk v.

This Court granted\nreview of Jefferson State Bank's petition and reversed the court of appeals' judgment, holding that\nthe statute of repose set forth in Texas Business and Commerce Code section 4.406 barred Lenk's\nclaims because she failed to notify Jefferson State Bank of the unauthorized transactions within\nsixty days of her appointment as estate administrator. 4 Jefferson State Bank, 323 S.W.3d at 149–\n50.\n\nBecause Lenk filed the exact same cause of action against both banks, the only material distinction\nbetween this case and Jefferson State Bank is the theories and *606 defenses asserted by the\nbanks. The resolution of both appeals, however, turns on this distinction. Jefferson State Bank\nraised numerous defenses in the trial court, including the statute of repose under section 4.406, a\ntheory on which it prevailed in this Court. See id. Conversely, Guaranty Bank chose not to raise a\nstatute of repose defense in the trial court. Instead, Guaranty Bank decided to argue that (1) it did\nnot breach the deposit agreement because Thompson's account was closed when Lenk filed her\nsuit, and (2) it did not substantially cause Lenk's injuries.\n\nIn this Court, Guaranty Bank's arguments relate solely to its central contention that it did not breach\nthe account agreement. Specifically, Guaranty Bank claims that it did not breach the agreement\nbecause (1) the account was closed prior to Lenk's payment demand, (2) Lenk acquiesced in\nSpillman's unauthorized withdrawals by waiting almost two years after her appointment to dispute\nthem, and (3) the bank was entitled to rely on Spillman's forged letters of administration. Guaranty\nBank also argues that the court of appeals improperly reviewed the denial of Lenk's motion for\npartial summary judgment. In a cross-petition, Lenk contends we should remand the case to the\ntrial court for a determination of attorney's fees. Because we conclude Guaranty Bank breached the\ndeposit agreement, but failed to raise any affirmative defenses compelling a judgment in its favor,\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Accrual of Breach Action\n\n [1] Guaranty Bank argues it did not breach the deposit agreement when Lenk demanded payment\nin 2005 because the agreement terminated when the account was closed in 2001. Guaranty Bank\nfurther asserts that any cause of action for a breach of the deposit agreement would have accrued in\n2000 and early 2001 when the bank denied liability by providing statements to Spillman. Guaranty\nBank maintains that Lenk filed a demand-based claim simply as a way to evade the applicable\nstatutes of limitations or repose, which would have barred alternative claims, such as a wrongful\npayment claim, Lenk chose not to pursue. We disagree.\n\n [2] [3] It is well-settled that a general deposit, such as that at issue here, creates a debtor-creditor\nrelationship between a bank and its customer. Sears v. Cont'l Bank & Trust Co., 562 S.W.2d\n843, 844 (Tex.1977); Upper Valley Aviation, Inc. v. Mercantile Nat'l Bank, 656 S.W.2d 952, 955\n(Tex.App.-Dallas 1983, writ ref'd n.r.e.); Meador v. Rudolph, 218 S.W. 520, 526 (Tex.Civ.App.-\nAmarillo 1919, writ dism'd w.o.j.) (describing the “well-recognized principle of law that the\ndeposit is a debt owing by the bank to the party in whose name the deposit is made”). Given this\nrelationship, a bank may only pay out money in accordance with a customer's order, and also bears\nthe burden of demonstrating proper payment. Sears, 562 S.W.2d at 844 (“The bank must justify\nits withdrawal from the depositor's account when the depositor proves the balance in his account\nand sues the bank for that amount.”); Mesquite State Bank v. Prof'l Inv. Corp., 488 S.W.2d 73,\n75 (Tex.1972) (observing that “the burden of proving payment under authority from the depositor\nis on the bank” (citing L.G. Balfour Co. v. State Trust & Sav. Bank of Dallas, 120 S.W.2d 477,\n479 (Tex.Civ.App.-Waco 1938, no writ))); *607 Peavy–Moore Lumber Co. v. First Nat'l Bank\nof Beaumont, 133 Tex. 467, 128 S.W.2d 1158, 1162 (Tex.Comm'n App.1939) (noting that when\na person makes a deposit in the name of another, “the bank becomes the debtor of the person for\nwhom and in whose name the deposit is made, and the money cannot be withdrawn by him who\nmade the deposit unless it is proven that he, rather than the person in whose name the deposit was\nmade, is the true owner”). While a bank's wrongful payment of a general deposit does not breach\nthe deposit agreement, a bank's refusal to pay such funds to the rightful account holder will. Hodge\nv. N. Trust Bank of Tex., N.A., 54 S.W.3d 518, 525–26 (Tex.App.-Eastland 2001, pet. denied).\n\n [4] Here, the bank refused to pay general deposit funds to the rightful account holder (Lenk), and\nso the bank breached the deposit agreement. Even if Lenk could have sued separately for wrongful\npayment, she was also entitled to sue for breach when the bank refused her demand for payment.\nSee id.; see also Upper Valley Aviation, 656 S.W.2d at 955 (observing that a bank deposit creates\na debtor/creditor relationship, and thus a person must sue for breach of the depository contract to\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 409\n\nrecover the deposit); Canyon Lake Bank v. New Braunfels Utils., 638 S.W.2d 944, 949 (Tex.App.-\nAustin 1982, no writ) (discussing demand-based claim); Hinds v. Sw. Sav. Ass'n of Houston,\n562 S.W.2d 4, 4–5 (Tex.Civ.App.-Beaumont 1977, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (same); First State Bank of\nSeminole v. Shannon, 159 S.W. 398, 401 (Tex.Civ.App.-Amarillo 1913, writ ref'd) (same). Given\nthe debtor-creditor relationship between a bank and a customer and the corresponding requirement\nthat the bank must repay any deposits to the customer, see Sears, 562 S.W.2d at 844, a breach\naction for such a refusal includes funds that were wrongfully paid out by a bank. A customer, after\nall, will always seek the funds that should be on deposit in an account. See Mesquite State Bank,\n488 S.W.2d at 75 (“In suits against a bank to recover deposits, the burden of proving payment\nunder authority from the depositor is on the bank.”). Indeed, Lenk sued for all funds on deposit\nsince Thompson's death (i.e., those funds wrongfully paid out by the bank), not merely for those\nnonexistent funds in the closed account at the time she made her demand. Thus, Lenk's claim for\nbreach of the deposit agreement fairly encompasses any wrongful payment claim she may have\nhad. See id.\n\n [5] Because there was a breach, we must next determine when the breach accrued. “A cause of\naction for denial of deposit liability on a deposit contract ... does not accrue until the bank has\ndenied liability and given notice of the denial [by providing an account statement] to the account\nholder.” TEX. FIN.CODE § 34.301(b). Thus, as a general matter, a bank's refusal to pay funds\non a customer's demand commences the accrual of a demand-based cause of action. See Hodge,\n54 S.W.3d at 525–26. But, importantly, section 34.301(b) goes on to state: “A bank that provides\nan account statement ... to the account holder is considered to have denied liability and given the\nnotice as to any amount not shown on the statement....” TEX. FIN.CODE § 34.301(b). Guaranty\nBank urges us to hold that any cause of action for breach of the deposit agreement thus accrued\nwhen it denied liability by sending account statements to Spillman in 2000.\n\nJefferson State Bank precludes this holding. In that case, we unconditionally rejected Jefferson\nState Bank's contention that it satisfied its burden of sending or making available statements when\nit sent them to the imposter Spillman. Jefferson State Bank, 323 S.W.3d at 149 (concluding that\n“sending Spillman the statements could not fulfill the Bank's obligation to *608 provide account\nstatements ‘to a customer’ ” (citing TEX. BUS. & COM.CODE § 4.406(a))). While Jefferson State\nBank concerned the statute of repose under section 4.406 of the Business and Commerce Code,\nthe rationale and logic of that opinion apply equally here. As we observed in Jefferson State Bank,\nany reliance Jefferson State Bank may have had on Spillman's fraudulent letters of administration\nwould not have altered the fact that Spillman was not the bank's customer. See id.; see also TEX.\nBUS. & COM.CODE § 4.406(a), (f) (precluding a bank customer “from asserting against the bank\n[an] unauthorized signature” if the customer does not timely “discover and report the customer's\nunauthorized signature” after the bank “sends or makes available to a customer a statement of\naccount”).\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                5\n\fFederal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Lenk, 361 S.W.3d 602 (2012)\n77 UCC Rep.Serv.2d 50, 55 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 409\n\nSimilarly, a bank may not deny liability by providing account statements to an imposter estate\nadministrator when section 34.301(b) of the Finance Code specifically provides that a bank must\nprovide account statements “to the account holder.” TEX. FIN.CODE § 34.301(b). Spillman, an\nimposter administrator, was not the account holder. Under Guaranty Bank's reasoning, Lenk's\ndemand-based cause of action would have accrued when Guaranty Bank began sending statements\nto Spillman in 2000, three years before Lenk—the legitimate estate administrator—was even\nappointed. In Jefferson State Bank, we held that in the event of a customer's death, a bank satisfies\nits section 4.406 burden of making an account statement available by retaining statements at a\nbank, but that the customer's burden to report unauthorized signatures does not arise until an estate\nrepresentative is appointed. Jefferson State Bank, 323 S.W.3d at 149–50. The same logic should\napply when determining when a bank denies liability in the face of a demand-based claim. We thus\nconclude that Guaranty Bank denied liability once Lenk was appointed administrator in 2003. See\nid. 5 At that point, Lenk would have had the opportunity to review any statements for the account\nprior to its closing and bring a timely demand-based claim.\n\n [6] Guaranty Bank's speculative argument that Lenk sued for breach of the deposit agreement\nin order to circumvent the applicable statute of repose under section 4.406 is also devoid of any\nmerit. As mentioned previously, Lenk filed the exact same cause of action—on the same day—\nin this case as she did in Jefferson State Bank. In Jefferson State Bank, we held that the statute of\nrepose barred Lenk's claim. Jefferson State Bank, 323 S.W.3d at 150.\n\n [7] [8] The statute of repose requires a person to report unauthorized transactions to a bank within\none year of account statements being made available. See TEX. BUS. & COM.CODE § 4.406(f).\nIf a person fails to report the unauthorized transaction, the *609 person is barred from bringing\na claim for payment. See id. The statute of repose demands that a person report unauthorized\ntransactions as a condition precedent to bringing suit. See, e.g., Am. Airlines Emps. Fed. Credit\nUnion v. Martin, 29 S.W.3d 86, 95 (Tex.2000) (observing that section 4.406 places a duty on bank\ncustomers to discover and report account irregularities and is similar to a condition precedent);\nNat'l Title Ins. Corp. Agency v. First Union Nat'l Bank, 263 Va. 355, 559 S.E.2d 668, 671 (2002)\n(observing that the statute of repose constitutes a condition precedent to a customer's right to file\nclaims against a bank). Unlike a statute of limitations, the statute of repose is an absolute bar to suit\nand “runs from a specific date without regard to the accrual of a cause of action.” Jefferson State\nBank, 323 S.W.3d at 147 n. 2 (emphasis added) (citing Holubec v. Brandenberger, 111 S.W.3d\n32, 37 (Tex.2003) and Trinity River Auth. v. URS Consultants, Inc.-Tex., 889 S.W.2d 259, 261\n(Tex.1994)); see Sandoe v. Lefta Assocs., 559 A.2d 732, 736 n. 5 (D.C.1989) (stating that “[a]\nstatute of repose ... establishes an absolute time period within which legal proceedings must be\ninitiated, regardless of when a cause of action accrues ” (emphasis added)). “A statute of repose\nis therefore a substantive definition of rights, rather than a procedural limitation.” Jefferson State\nBank, 323 S.W.3d at 147 n. 2 (quoting Trinity River Auth., 889 S.W.2d at 261). As in Jefferson\nState Bank, the repose time period began to run when Lenk was appointed in 2003, regardless of\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    6\n\fFederal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Lenk, 361 S.W.3d 602 (2012)\n77 UCC Rep.Serv.2d 50, 55 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 409\n\nthe accrual date of her cause of action. 6 Lenk had one year from the date of her appointment to\nreport the unauthorized transactions to the bank, and she failed to do so. See id. at 147.\n\n [9] [10] [11] But Guaranty Bank failed to raise the statute of repose as an affirmative defense\nin the trial court, and, in this Court, the bank expressly disclaims reliance on the statutes of repose\nand limitations as independent grounds for summary judgment. It is settled that “[a] court cannot\ngrant summary judgment on grounds that were not presented.” Johnson v. Brewer & Pritchard,\nP.C., 73 S.W.3d 193, 204 (Tex.2002) (citing Sci. Spectrum, Inc. v. Martinez, 941 S.W.2d 910,\n912 (Tex.1997)). 7 Moreover, as an affirmative defense, the statute of repose is only available to\nparties that properly raise it in the trial court. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 94. “When a defendant moves for\nsummary judgment based on an affirmative defense, such as the statute of repose, the defendant,\nas movant, bears the burden of proving each essential element of that defense.” Ryland Group,\nInc. v. Hood, 924 S.W.2d 120, 121 (Tex.1996) (per curiam); see also Jefferson State Bank, 323\nS.W.3d at 148–50 (explaining that, when raised as a defense, the statute of repose begins to run\nwhen an administrator is appointed). Thus, we will not analyze Guaranty Bank's petition in light of\nany such defenses. See *610 TEX.R. CIV. P. 166a(c) (“Issues not expressly presented to the trial\ncourt by written motion, answer or other response shall not be considered on appeal as grounds\nfor reversal.”).\n\nThe dissent agrees that under section 34.301(b) of the Finance Code, Lenk's cause of action\nbegan to accrue in 2003. See 361 S.W.3d at 613 (Hecht, J., dissenting) (“Lenk was appointed\nthe representative of Thompson's estate in September 2003. Under Section 34.301(b), her action\nagainst the bank accrued then, not in June 2005.”). The dissent parts company by believing that\ndemand-based claims do not exist. Id. at 614 (“The problem with the claim Lenk asserts is not that\nit is time-barred; the problem is that under Section 34.301(b), the claim does not exist, and for good\nreason.”). This statement either ignores the fact that we have consistently recognized demand-\nbased claims since 1913, see Shannon, 159 S.W. at 401, or that section 34.301(b) changed only\nwhen those demand-based claims begin to accrue for limitations purposes. Section 34.301(b) limits\nwhen demand-based claims may be brought but it does not eliminate them. Unlike limitations,\nrepose does not depend on when a cause begins to accrue. Jefferson State Bank, 323 S.W.3d at\n147 n. 2. Repose here required Lenk to sue within one year of being appointed administrator in\n2003, TEX. BUS. & COM.CODE § 4.406(f); Jefferson State Bank, 323 S.W.3d at 147, rather than\nthe limitations requirement of suing within four years of being appointed administrator in 2003,\nTEX. FIN.CODE § 34.301(b) (defining accrual as when bank denies liability by making account\nstatements available); TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE § 16.051 (establishing residual four-year\nlimitations period). Because Lenk sued two years after being appointed administrator, limitations\nwould not bar her claim and is not at issue in this case. TEX. FIN.CODE § 34.301(b); TEX. CIV.\nPRAC. & REM.CODE § 16.051. The dissent relies on a statute that is not relevant to Lenk's claim\nto attempt to explain that the claim never existed in the first place.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 409\n\nThe dissent also believes that our decision “will be significant to the entire financial industry in\nTexas” and will result in a windfall to the estate here. 361 S.W.3d at 614 (Hecht, J., dissenting).\nBanks have been on notice since at least 1913 that demand-based claims exist. Shannon, 159 S.W.\nat 401. And they also have the protection of various defenses. Our decision today gives full effect\nto these claims and defenses. Further, there is no evidence in the record identifying the source\nof the additional funds and there is certainly no evidence to suggest they came from somewhere\nother than the estate.\n\nLenk's cause of action for breach of the deposit agreement began to accrue when she was appointed\nin 2003, and thus was able to access the estate's account statements for the first time. However,\nGuaranty Bank did not raise a viable defense that compels judgment in its favor. Accordingly, we\nhold that Guaranty Bank breached the deposit agreement and that it raised no defense that negates\nits liability.\n\n\n\n                                        II. Estoppel by Acquiescence\n\n [12] Guaranty Bank argues that Lenk acquiesced to any unauthorized withdrawals by failing to\ndispute them for nearly two years after her appointment. In doing so, Guaranty Bank relies on\nL.G. Balfour Co., a 1938 court of appeals decision. We reject this argument. L.G. Balfour merely\nstates the statute of repose rule later codified in section 4.406 of the Business and Commerce\nCode. Thus, the theory of estoppel by acquiescence is not distinct from the affirmative defense of\nsection 4.406 which, as previously mentioned, Guaranty *611 Bank did not rely on in the trial\ncourt or at this Court. Compare, e.g., Oak Cliff Bank & Trust Co. v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 436\nS.W.2d 165, 169 (Tex.Civ.App.-Dallas 1969, no writ) (explaining that a bank customer has a duty\nto examine bank statements and notify a bank of forged signatures within a reasonable time, or else\nthe customer “may be said to have acquiesced in the correctness of the statement[s]”), with TEX.\nBUS. & COM. CODE § 4.406(c)–(d) (stating that a customer may be precluded from asserting a\nclaim for unauthorized signature or alteration if a bank proves the customer failed to reasonably\nexamine a statement and alert the bank of any irregularities).\n\nEven assuming estoppel by acquiescence is a distinct theory, Guaranty Bank did not preserve that\nargument in the trial court because it did not raise it as an affirmative defense. 8 See TEX.R. CIV.\nP. 94 (requiring parties to plead estoppel, statute of frauds, statute of limitations, waiver, “and any\nother matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense”). 9 Accordingly, Guaranty Bank\nfailed to preserve error on its acquiescence argument. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 166a(c).\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    8\n\fFederal Deposit Ins. Corp. v.

Reliance on Forged Letters of Administration\n\n [13] Guaranty Bank next claims that, under Texas Probate Code section 186, it was entitled to\nrely on Spillman's apparently valid letters of administration when it allowed Spillman to access\nThompson's account. In Jefferson State Bank, we did not reach this issue because Lenk's claim\nwas barred by the statute of repose. 323 S.W.3d at 147 n. 3. We decline to consider the section\n186 argument here because Guaranty bank did not raise this issue at the trial court, and therefore\nfailed to preserve error. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 166a(c).\n\n\n\n                        IV. Review of Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n\n [14] [15] Guaranty Bank argues the court of appeals erred in reviewing the trial court's denial\nof Lenk's motion for partial summary judgment. It contends that, because Lenk failed to move for\nsummary judgment on her request for attorney's fees, the trial court's order denying her motion is\nnot a final order subject to appellate court review. But, Lenk correctly responds that:\n\n            When both parties move for partial summary judgment on the same issues and\n            the trial court grants one motion and denies the other, as here, the reviewing court\n            considers the summary judgment evidence presented by both sides, determines\n            all questions presented, and if the reviewing court determines that the trial court\n            erred, renders the judgment the trial court should have rendered.\n\nValence Operating Co. v. Dorsett, 164 S.W.3d 656, 661 (Tex.2005) (citing FM Props. Operating\nCo. v. City of Austin, 22 S.W.3d 868, 872 (Tex.2000)). Here, the parties moved for summary\njudgment on the same issues, and the trial court granted Guaranty Bank's motion, denied Lenk's,\n *612 and stated that all relief not granted was denied. As Guaranty Bank correctly points out,\nthe only other pending issue not raised in the motions was Lenk's claim for attorney's fees, and,\nas we discuss below, Lenk waived this issue on appeal. Moreover, the trial court's order disposed\nof all issues in the case not only by virtue of the language of the order, but also because Lenk's\nattorney's fees claim was necessarily disposed of when the trial court ruled in Guaranty Bank's\nfavor. Accordingly, the court of appeals' review of the summary judgment motions was proper.\n\n\n\n                                   V. Cross–Petition for Attorney's Fees\n\n [16] Lenk filed a cross-petition seeking a remand to the trial court to determine an award of\nattorney's fees. Lenk claims that, because this issue was not addressed in her motion for partial\nsummary judgment, it should now be reviewed by the trial court. Guaranty Bank responds that\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  9\n\fFederal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Lenk, 361 S.W.3d 602 (2012)\n77 UCC Rep.Serv.2d 50, 55 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 409\n\nLenk waived this argument by not briefing it at the court of appeals. The bank argues that both\nparties chose to narrow their appellate arguments, and should be limited to the issues briefed and\nthe relief requested below. We agree with Guaranty Bank.\n\nIn her motion for partial summary judgment, Lenk sought damages for Guaranty Bank's breach\nand asked that the sole remaining issue for determination in the case be her request for attorney's\nfees. The trial court issued a final judgment denying Lenk's motion. On appeal, Lenk focused on\nher breach claim, and asked the court of appeals to reverse and render in her favor, which the court\ndid. Later, Lenk raised the issue of attorney's fees in a motion for rehearing, which the court of\nappeals denied. We decline to address Lenk's claim for attorney's fees because she did not properly\nraise the issue at the court of appeals. See, e.g., TEX.R.APP. P. 53.2(f) (explaining that, when a\nparty files a petition for review in the Supreme Court, “[i]f the matter complained of originated\nin the trial court, it should have been ... assigned as error in the court of appeals”). Thus, we deny\nLenk's cross-petition.\n\n\n\n                                                 VI. Conclusion\n\nLenk's claim for breach of the deposit agreement began to accrue in 2003, when Lenk was\nappointed as estate administrator. Because the bank breached the deposit agreement, yet failed to\nraise viable affirmative defenses against Lenk's breach claim, we will not render judgment in its\nfavor. Lenk's cross-petition for attorney's fees was not properly raised in the court of appeals, and\nthus we reject this claim as well. Accordingly, we grant Guaranty Bank's petition for review and,\nwithout hearing oral argument, TEX.R.APP. P. 59.1, affirm the court of appeals' judgment.\n\n\n\nJustice HECHT filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice GREEN joined.\n\nJustice HECHT, joined by Justice GREEN, dissenting.\nJohn Albert Thompson died in January 2000 with about $3,000 on deposit in a Guaranty Bank\nchecking account. A few weeks later, Mel Spillman falsely represented to the Bank that he was\nThompson's nephew and estate administrator, and directed that he be named on Thompson's\naccount. The Bank complied. Spillman then deposited around $167,000 to the account, and over\nthe next several months proceeded to withdraw all but a small amount that was eaten up in service\ncharges. The Bank closed the account on September 13, 2001.\n\nSpillman was a fraud. He forged letters of administration in dozens of estates like *613\nThompson's. In June 2002, he was sentenced to ten years in prison.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 10\n\fFederal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Lenk, 361 S.W.3d 602 (2012)\n77 UCC Rep.Serv.2d 50, 55 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 409\n\nIn September 2003, Christa Lenk was appointed administrator of Thompson's estate and several\nothers Spillman had defrauded. In June 2005, Lenk demanded that the Bank repay the funds\nSpillman had withdrawn from Thompson's account years earlier. The Bank refused, and Lenk sued.\nThe trial court granted summary judgment for the Bank; the court of appeals reversed, holding\nthat summary judgment should have been granted for Lenk. 1\n\nThe first sentence of Section 34.301(b) of the Texas Finance Code states: “A cause of action for\ndenial of deposit liability on a deposit contract without a maturity date does not accrue until the\nbank has denied liability and given notice of the denial to the account holder.” 2 Lenk contends\nthat her action against the Bank for allowing unauthorized withdrawals from Thompson's checking\naccount until January 2001 accrued in June 2005, when she demanded that the Bank return the\nmoney, and the Bank refused. The Court agrees that this is Lenk's contention—“[Lenk] claimed\nthe bank breached the deposit agreement by refusing her payment demand” 3 —and that it is correct\n—“the bank refused to pay general deposit funds to the rightful account holder (Lenk), and so ...\nbreached the deposit agreement.” 4\n\nBut Lenk's claim ignores the second sentence of Section 34.301(b): “A bank that provides an\naccount statement or passbook to the account holder is considered to have denied liability and\ngiven the notice as to any amount not shown on the statement or passbook.” 5 In Jefferson\nState Bank v. Lenk, we held that a bank that makes account statements available at its offices\nis considered to have denied liability for, and given notice of, unauthorized withdrawals from\na deceased customer's checking account when a representative is appointed for the decedent's\nestate. 6 Lenk was appointed the representative of Thompson's estate in September 2003. Under\nSection 34.301(b), her action against the Bank accrued then, not in June 2005.\n\nThe Court observes that suit based on a claim that accrued in September 2003 would be\ntimebarred 7 and faults the Bank *614 for not making that argument. But the Bank argues, and\nthe Court specifically acknowledges, that Lenk's claim is for the Bank's refusal of her June 2005\ndemand. Lenk pleaded in her petition:\n\n\n On June 4, 2005, [Lenk] made demand upon [the Bank] for the payment of [unauthorized\n withdrawals] from the account, and [the Bank] has failed and refused to pay over to [Lenk] the\n sums due and owing from the account.\n***\n\n   Under the terms of the depositor's agreement with [Thompson] and applicable law, [the Bank]\n   was required to pay sums on deposit to [Lenk] on demand or to her order to such persons as she\n   may direct. [The Bank] failed and refused to pay to [Lenk] the sums deposited upon her demand.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 409\n\n   Accordingly, [Lenk] is entitled to judgment in the amount of all sums which were deposited in\n   the name of [Thompson] or his representative since the date of his death.\n\nShe asserted in her motion for summary judgment:\n\n   On June 4, 2005, [Lenk] made written demand upon [the Bank] for the sums deposited into\n   [Thompson's] account, and [the Bank] has failed and refused to pay the sums deposited into\n   the account to [Lenk].\n\n   [The Bank's] failure and refusal to pay to [Lenk] the sums deposited into the account of\n   [Thompson] breached the terms of the depositor's agreement. Accordingly, [Lenk] is entitled\n   to judgment....\n\nShe argued to the court of appeals:\n\n            In Plaintiff's Original Petition, [Lenk] stated that [her] cause of action is based\n            upon the requirements of the depositors agreement and [the Bank's] refusal to\n            pay [Lenk] the sums deposited into Mr. Thompson's account after her demand.\n\nLenk could not have been clearer. She alleged that her June 2005 demand triggered her claim. She\nsued the Bank days later. An assertion by the Bank that her claim for its refusal of her demand\nwas time-barred would have been frivolous.\n\nThe problem with the claim Lenk asserts is not that it is time-barred; the problem is that, under\nSection 34.301(b), the claim does not exist, and for good reason. Allowing a bank customer to\ncreate a cause of action merely by writing a demand letter, as Lenk contends, would circumvent\nall time limitations on claims for unauthorized withdrawals. That is what the Court has done in\nthis case.\n\nIt bears comment that the Court hands Lenk a windfall. Not only does she recover the $3,000\nSpillman stole from Thompson's account, Lenk recovers about $145,000 of the money that\nSpillman laundered through the account, using letters of administration the Bank had no reason\nto know were forged, on a claim filed nearly four years after the account was closed and nearly\ntwo years after she was on notice of all the transactions. But the consequences of the Court's\nmisapplication of Section 34.301(b), in this case decided without argument, will be significant to\nthe entire financial industry in Texas.\n\nI respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

For ease of\n       reference, we refer to the FDIC as Guaranty Bank throughout this opinion.\n2      In this case, Spillman gained access to an account belonging to John Albert Thompson, who died on January 30, 2000. After Spillman\n       deposited and withdrew various amounts from the account, Lenk alleged that he stole $148,430.28 from Thompson's estate.\n3      Lenk specifically asserted in each petition:\n             Under the terms of the depositor's agreement with Decedent and applicable law, Defendant was required to pay sums on deposit\n             to Plaintiff on demand or to her order to such persons as she may direct. Defendant failed and refused to pay to Plaintiff the\n             sums deposited upon her demand. Accordingly, Plaintiff is entitled to judgment in the amount of all sums which were deposited\n             in the name of Decedent or his representative since the date of his death.\n4      The statute sets a one-year period of repose, which was contractually shortened to sixty days in that case.\n\n5      The fact that the account was closed when Lenk demanded payment does not change our analysis. Under the bank's rationale, a bank\n       could wrongfully pay out an account's entire balance to an imposter, as happened here, then unilaterally close the account to avoid\n       liability to the account holder or proper estate administrator. Further, as discussed above, in a situation such as this where the bank\n       has paid out sums to an imposter, a plaintiff in Lenk's position will naturally seek to withdraw the amount of funds that should be on\n       deposit, not the actual account balance after the wrongful withdrawals. Given the debtor-creditor relationship between a bank and its\n       customer and the requirement that a bank must repay any deposits to a customer on her order, it follows that a person is entitled to\n       demand payment for amounts that should be on deposit, not the amount actually in the account after wrongful withdrawals, even if\n       the bank has unilaterally closed the account. See Mesquite State Bank, 488 S.W.2d at 75.\n6      As explained supra, section 34.301(b) of the Finance Code indicates that Lenk's cause of action began to accrue in 2003 when Lenk\n       was appointed administrator.\n7      See also TEX.R.

BACKGROUND\n\nBaylor provides health care services to individual patients. Many of Baylor's patients are members\nof health plans. Baylor has many contracts with health benefit entities, including insurance\ncompanies and preferred provider organizations (PPOs), through which individual patients gain\naccess to Baylor's hospitals and services at discounted rates.\n\nPrivate Healthcare Systems, Inc. (PHCS) operates a network of PPOs. PHCS enters into contracts\nknown as preferred provider agreements with health care providers (such as Baylor) to negotiate\ndiscounts from the providers' full charges for health care services. PHCS also enters into contracts\nknown as subscriber services agreements with insurance companies, employer health plans,\nmanaged care organizations, and third-party administrators, to provide them and their members\naccess to health care services at the discounted rates established by the preferred provider\nagreements.\n\nGPA is a third-party administrator; its customers are self-funded health plans. Third-party\nadministrators provide claims handling services and administrative support to health plans. By\ncontracting with various PPO networks, such as PHCS, GPA also offers its customers—and their\nmembers—access to medical services from a network of providers (e.g. Baylor) at discounted\nrates.\n\nBaylor sued GPA for failure to pay for health care services Baylor provided to members of certain\nhealth care plans administered by GPA. GPA in turn filed a third-party action against PHCS.\nBoth Baylor and GPA moved for summary judgment; Baylor in fact filed several motions for\npartial summary judgment. The trial judge granted Baylor's motions and denied GPA's motion.\nThe parties then entered into an agreed final judgment and severance, by which GPA's third-\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Baylor Health Care System, 344 S.W.3d 467 (2011)\n\n\n\nparty claims against PHCS were severed into a separate cause, and final judgment was entered for\nBaylor. GPA appeals the judgment in favor of Baylor. PHCS is not a party to this appeal.\n\n\n\n                                      II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n [1] [2] The standards for reviewing summary judgments are well-established, *471 and we\nfollow them in reviewing this appeal. See Nixon v. Mr. Prop. Mgmt. Co., 690 S.W.2d 546, 548–\n49 (Tex.1985) (summary judgment standards of review). When both parties move for summary\njudgment, each party bears the burden of establishing that it is entitled to judgment as a matter\nof law. City of Garland v. Dallas Morning News, 22 S.W.3d 351, 356 (Tex.2000). When the trial\ncourt grants one motion and denies the other, we review the summary judgment evidence presented\nby both parties and determine all questions presented. Id. The reviewing court should render the\njudgment that the trial court should have rendered or reverse and remand if neither party has met\nits summary judgment burden. Id.\n\n [3] [4] If a defendant moves for summary judgment on an affirmative defense, it must\nconclusively establish each essential element of the affirmative defense. Selz v. Friendly Chevrolet,\nLtd., 152 S.W.3d 833, 836 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2005, no pet.) (“To prevail on summary judgment,\na defendant as movant must either disprove at least one element of each of the plaintiff's theories\nof recovery or plead and conclusively establish each essential element of an affirmative defense,\nthereby rebutting the plaintiff's cause of action.”). Similarly, if a party seeks to avoid summary\njudgment by way of an affirmative defense, it must come forward with summary judgment\nevidence sufficient to raise a fact issue on each element of its affirmative defense. See Brownlee v.\nBrownlee, 665 S.W.2d 111, 112 (Tex.1984). Whether a contractual provision is an unenforceable\npenalty and not a liquidated damage clause is an affirmative defense. See TEX.R. CIV. P.\n94; Phillips v. Phillips, 820 S.W.2d 785, 789 (Tex.1991) (“Although penalty is not among the\naffirmative defenses enumerated in Rule 94, TEX.R. CIV. P., the listing in that rule is not\nexclusive. Penalty is, in the language of the rule, a ‘matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative\ndefense’ [citations omitted].”)\n\n [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] The interpretation of an unambiguous contract is a question of law\nfor the court. MCI Telecomms. Corp. v. Tex. Utils. Elec. Co., 995 S.W.2d 647, 650–51 (Tex.1999).\nThe court's primary concern in interpreting a written contract is to determine the mutual intent of\nthe parties as manifested in the contract. Coker v. Coker, 650 S.W.2d 391, 393 (Tex.1983). The\nparties' intent must be taken from the agreement, and the agreement must be enforced as written.\nWells Fargo Bank, Minn., N.A. v. N. Cent. Plaza I, L.L.P., 194 S.W.3d 723, 726 (Tex.App.-Dallas\n2006, pet. denied). We favor an interpretation that affords some consequences to each part of the\nagreement so that none of the provisions will be rendered meaningless. Coker, 650 S.W.2d at\n394. Unless the agreement shows that the parties used a term in a technical or different sense,\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

DISCUSSION\n\nA. The Contracts\nBaylor relies on three written contracts to establish its claim against GPA. First, Baylor\nrelies on a Subscriber Services Agreement between PHCS and GPA dated April 17, 1998,\namended by an Amendment, *472 Assignment, and Assumption of the Subscriber Services\nAgreement with effective dates of September 1, 2002 and January 1, 2003. Under the Subscriber\nServices Agreement, GPA 2 became a subscriber to PHCS's “comprehensive medical management\nsystem.” 3 As a subscriber to PHCS's network, GPA could offer its customers access to PHCS's\nnetwork of medical care providers at the discount rates negotiated by PHCS.\n\nSecond, Baylor relies on a Hospital Services Agreement (HSA) between Baylor and PHCS dated\nJanuary 1, 2002. Under the HSA, Baylor became a “Preferred Provider” in PHCS's network. It\nagreed to provide—at discounted rates 4 —health care services (“Covered Services”) to persons\n(“Members”) covered by “Health Plans” (including PPOs) created or sponsored by a “Payor” (a\ndefined term in the HSA). As part of the HSA, PHCS warranted that its contracts with each Payor\nobligate the “Payor (or its designee) to comply with the duties and obligations of [the HSA],\nincluding, but not limited to, paying for Covered Services rendered to Members in accordance\nwith the provisions of Article IV of [the HSA].”\n\nThird, Baylor relies on a Subscriber Acknowledgment between GPA and PHCS effective January\n1, 2003. The Subscriber Acknowledgment refers to both the Subscriber Services Agreement and\nthe HSA, reciting that GPA and PHCS have entered into the Subscriber Services Agreement and\nthat PHCS has entered into contracts with health care providers for participation in its network. The\nSubscriber Acknowledgment requires GPA “to pay or arrange to pay PHCS Preferred Providers\n[which would include Baylor] in accordance with the PHCS Preferred Provider Agreement for\nsuch Preferred Provider, for the markets and the networks for which [GPA] has purchased provider\nnetwork Services from PHCS.” (First brackets added.)\n\n\nB. Is GPA a “Payor”?\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    4\n\fGPA Holding, Inc. v. Baylor Health Care System, 344 S.W.3d 467 (2011)\n\n\n\nIn its first issue, GPA contends the trial court erred in granting Baylor's motion for summary\njudgment because GPA is not a “payor” under the HSA. At the outset, GPA makes a procedural\nargument that summary judgment was improper because Baylor did not move for summary\njudgment on this issue. We disagree.\n\n *473 Baylor filed four motions for partial summary judgment. In its first motion, Baylor requested\nthat the trial court interpret the three contracts at issue and “find, as a matter of law, that GPA is\nbound by the terms and conditions of the HSA with respect to the health care claims at issue in this\ncase, including the requirements of Section 4.4(a).” In its own motion for summary judgment, GPA\nargued, “GPA is not a ‘Payor’ obligated to pay under the terms of the Baylor/PHCS Agreement,”\nand Baylor filed a summary judgment response again arguing that GPA was bound by the terms\nof the agreement.\n\n [11] The trial court granted Baylor's motion and denied GPA's, necessarily deciding that GPA\nwas a “Payor” bound by the provisions of the HSA, including section 4.4(a). We reject GPA's\nargument that the issue was not presented to and decided by the trial court.\n\nTurning to GPA's substantive argument, GPA asserts the HSA defines “Payor” very narrowly.\nIt argues the evidence established that GPA's clients—and not itself—were “Payors” under the\nHSA. It contends that as a third party administrator, it did not actually pay claims but only offered\nadministrative services to facilitate payment of claims by the employer-funded health plans that\nwere GPA's clients. Because the HSA's payment provisions apply only to “Payors” and GPA is\nnot a Payor, GPA contends it is not responsible to pay for Baylor's services, and thus that the trial\ncourt erred in entering summary judgment in favor of Baylor.\n\nThe HSA defines a “Payor” as\n\n            an insurance company, employer health plans, Taft–Hartley fund, plan sponsors\n            or other similarly situated entities or organizations which are obligated (directly\n            or through its designee) to pay for Covered Services for Members in accordance\n            with such Health Plans.\n\nGPA offered the affidavits of Kathy Enochs, the chief operating officer of GPA, and Madalyn\nStraughn, the vice president of operations for GPA, to establish that GPA is not an insurance\ncompany, employer health plan, Taft–Hartley fund, or plan sponsor. Enochs also testified that\nGPA was not a “payor” under the definition in the contract.\n\nGPA does not dispute it is a party to the Subscriber Services Agreement and the Subscriber\nAcknowledgment. In fact, Enochs testified GPA could not access PHCS's preferred providers at\na discount without the Subscriber Services Agreement and the Subscriber Acknowledgment. She\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    5\n\fGPA Holding, Inc. v. Baylor Health Care System, 344 S.W.3d 467 (2011)\n\n\n\ntestified GPA entered into the agreement with PHCS “to market their network to our plans that\nwe administer.”\n\nIn Exhibit J to the Subscriber Services Agreement, under “Duties of the Subscriber,” paragraph\n2(b) provides, “The Subscriber [i.e. GPA] shall abide by the terms of any agreement with a\nParticipating Provider [e.g. Baylor] entered into by PHCS on behalf of the Subscriber with regard\nto the provision of PPO services.” (Brackets added.) In the Subscriber Acknowledgment, GPA\n“agrees to pay or arrange to pay PHCS Preferred Providers in accordance with the PHCS Preferred\nProvider Agreement for each such Preferred provider, for the markets and the networks for which\nSubscriber has purchased provider network Services from PHCS.”\n\nThe discounts offered to GPA's customers were the result of the relationships among the parties\nto all three agreements. If PHCS did not contract with Baylor under the HSA, there would be no\ndiscount to PHCS's subscribers on the fees for Baylor's services. If GPA did not in turn contract\nwith PHCS to take advantage of the discounts offered in the HSA, those *474 discounts would\nnot have been available to GPA's customers.\n\n [12] In Baylor University Medical Center v. Epoch Group, L.C., 340 F.Supp.2d 749, 755\n(N.D.Tex.2004), similar contracts were held to “constitute a single, unified contract” requiring\na claims supervisor to timely pay Baylor's clean claims. While we are not bound by a decision\nof a federal district court, we may consider federal precedent when it is well-reasoned and\nhelpful. See Davenport v. Garcia, 834 S.W.2d 4, 20 (Tex.1992) (“With a strongly independent\nstate judiciary, Texas should borrow from well-reasoned and persuasive federal procedural and\nsubstantive precedent when this is deemed helpful, but should never feel compelled to parrot the\nfederal judiciary.”).\n\nAs here, there were three contracts in Epoch Group: a HSA between PHCS and Baylor, a\nsubscriber services agreement between PHCS and Epoch, and a payor acknowledgment between\nPHCS and Epoch. Epoch Group, 340 F.Supp.2d at 752. Discussing its conclusion that the three\ndocuments constituted a single, unified contract, the court reasoned:\n\n            Indeed, all three instruments were required to complete the relationship between\n            the parties. The Subscriber Services Agreement, which provided discounts from\n            PHCS to Payors, could not operate effectively without PHCS contracting with\n            providers through hospital services agreements. The very foundation of the\n            discounts offered in [the] Subscriber Services Agreement appears to be the\n            agreements between PHCS and providers such as Baylor. Moreover, Payor\n            Acknowledgments serve no apparent purpose other than to commit Payors to\n            comply with the terms and conditions of the provider agreements.\n\nId. at 755 (citation omitted).\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Baylor Health Care System, 344 S.W.3d 467 (2011)\n\n\n\n\nGPA distinguishes Epoch Group, arguing the court did not decide the question whether Epoch\nwas a “payor” under the HSA. Perhaps because Epoch signed a document called “payor\nacknowledgment” instead of “subscriber acknowledgment,” the issue whether Epoch was a\n“payor” for purposes of the agreements was not presented to the Epoch Group court. Regardless\nof the titles of the two agreements, however, their substance was the same: to commit the payor or\nsubscriber “to comply with the terms and conditions of the provider agreements,” so that provider\ndiscounts set forth in hospital services agreements could be extended to the subscriber's customers.\nSee id. at 755.\n\n [13] We conclude, as did the trial court, that GPA is bound by the HSA. Reading the three\nagreements together, GPA committed to abide by the terms of the HSA and to pay or arrange to\npay Baylor in accordance with the HSA. Even though the summary judgment evidence showed\nthat GPA was not an “insurance company, employer health plan[ ], Taft–Hartley fund, [or] plan\nsponsor[ ],” we conclude the evidence (i.e. the three contracts) proves as a matter of law that\nGPA falls within the contractual definition of “other similarly situated entities or organizations\nwhich are obligated (directly or through its designee) to pay for Covered Services for Members in\naccordance with such Health Plans.” We overrule GPA's first issue.\n\n\nB. “Liquidated Damages” or “Penalty”?\nThe HSA also contains terms regarding payment of claims:\n\n  4.4 Claim Processing\n\n  (a) Payor (or its designee) shall pay all Clean Claims for Covered Services *475 within forty-\n     five (45) calendar days of receipt of a Clean Claim containing the information set out in\n     Section 4.3 from Hospital in accordance with the applicable reimbursement rates attached on\n     Schedule 1. ... If Payor (directly or through its designee) does not pay within forty-five (45)\n     days of receipt of a Clean Claim, Payor shall no longer be eligible for the rates set forth on\n     Schedule 1 and shall be obligated to pay Hospital at Hospital's Normal Billed Charges and\n     hospital may elect to terminate this Agreement....\n\nIn its second issue, GPA contends the trial court erred in denying its motion for summary\njudgment because the amount of damages awarded against it under this provision constituted an\nunenforceable liquidated damages penalty.\n\nGPA complains that the above section, by requiring payors to pay the hospital's “Normal Billed\nCharges” unless the payor pays a Clean Claim within 45 days, “fixes compensation for breach in\nadvance of the breach,” and is thus an impermissible penalty.\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Baylor Health Care System, 344 S.W.3d 467 (2011)\n\n\n\n [14] [15] “The term ‘liquidated damages' ordinarily refers to an acceptable measure of damages\nthat parties stipulate in advance will be assessed in the event of a contract breach.” Flores v.\nMillennium Interests, Ltd., 185 S.W.3d 427, 431 (Tex.2005); see also Valence Operating Co.\nv. Dorsett, 164 S.W.3d 656, 664 (Tex.2005) (“[l]iquidated damages clauses fix in advance the\ncompensation to a party accruing from the failure to perform specified contractual obligations”).\nWhether a contract term is a liquidated damages clause is a question of law for the court. Valence\nOperating Co., 164 S.W.3d at 664.\n\n [16] [17] If a court determines that a contract term is a liquidated damages clause, the court may\nthen determine whether the clause is enforceable, or whether it is an unenforceable penalty. The\npolicy underlying the prohibition against penalties is to ensure that a party to a contract receives\n“just compensation,” that is, “neither more nor less than his actual damages.” Phillips, 820 S.W.2d\nat 788 (quoting Stewart v. Basey, 150 Tex. 666, 245 S.W.2d 484, 485–86 (1952)). In order to\nenforce a liquidated damages provision and determine the provision is not a penalty, “the court\nmust find: (1) that the harm caused by the breach is incapable or difficult of estimation, and (2)\nthat the amount of liquidated damages called for is a reasonable forecast of just compensation.”\nPhillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788 (quoting Rio Grande Valley Sugar Growers, Inc. v. Campesi, 592\nS.W.2d 340, 342 n. 2 (Tex.1979)).\n\nBaylor argues that section 4.4 is neither a liquidated damages provision nor a penalty. Baylor\nasserts that section 4.4 “does not fix in advance compensation for GPA's failure to perform,”\nbut rather “provides a two-tiered pricing structure that grants GPA discounts (often substantial)\nif claims are paid within forty-five days.” Baylor further contends that even if section 4.4 is a\nliquidated damages provision, it is enforceable under Texas law and is not a penalty because\ndamages are difficult or impossible to estimate, and Baylor's normal billed charge is a reasonable\nforecast of just compensation.\n\nFor purposes of this opinion, we will assume without deciding that section 4.4(a) of the HSA is\na liquidated damages provision, and examine whether the clause is also an unenforceable penalty\nunder the factors set forth in Phillips.\n\n [18] [19] The party asserting that a liquidated damages clause is an unenforceable penalty (here,\nGPA) bears the burden of proof. Urban Television Network Corp. *476 v. Liquidity Solutions,\nL.P., 277 S.W.3d 917, 919 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2009, no pet.) (citing Murphy v. Cintas Corp., 923\nS.W.2d 663, 665–66 (Tex.App.-Tyler 1996, writ denied)). GPA moved for summary judgment\non the issue whether section 4.4(a) of the HSA is an unenforceable penalty. To obtain summary\njudgment on the affirmative defense of penalty, GPA must prove each element of the defense. See\nBrownlee, 665 S.W.2d at 112; Selz, 152 S.W.3d at 836; see also Phillips, 820 S.W.2d at 789. GPA\nargues the payment of “Normal Billed Charges” is not a reasonable forecast of just compensation,\nand the harm caused by late payment is not incapable or difficult of estimation.

Baylor Health Care System, 344 S.W.3d 467 (2011)\n\n\n\nS.W.2d at 788. In support of its motion for summary judgment, GPA offered evidence comparing\nthe discounted rates to the hospital's normal billed rates for the charges at issue. GPA offered a\nchart attached to the affidavit of Madalyn Straughn that showed the percentage difference between\nthe discounted rate and the normal billed charge for each of the charges at issue. GPA notes “the\noverwhelming majority of the percentage charges are 33% or more.”\n\nIn response to GPA's motion for summary judgment, Baylor offered evidence regarding the\ndifficulty of estimation and the reasonableness of the charges. Baylor offered the affidavit of Janda\nEdwards to explain that Baylor's normal billed charge “is the amount Baylor charges for services\nand supplies to entities or individuals who do not have access to a discount through a contract with\nBaylor.” Edwards explained Baylor's normal billed charge “is established by each facility and is\nbased upon an analysis of many factors including the service provided, the amount of personnel\ntime needed to provide the service, the amount of capital equipment needed to provide the service,\nthe amount of routine equipment needed to provide the service, the overhead, and market value.”\nEdwards also testified that Baylor's normal billed charge is a reasonable amount for the health care\nservices and supplies provided in the charges at issue in this case.\n\n [20] [21] GPA quotes from Edwards's affidavit and argues, “Baylor offered no justification\nattempting to show how the changed billing rate was a reasonable estimate of the cost associated\nwith payments being untimely.” GPA posits that a “more reasonable” calculation would be “a $30\nservice fee and 18% annual interest,” and argues, “our society routinely deals with late payments\nby a modest service fee and interest, and thus Baylor's damages were calculable.” GPA does\nnot offer evidence to support these arguments, however. The difficulty (or lack of difficulty) in\nestimation as well as the unreasonableness of the damages estimate were GPA's to prove. Urban\nTelevision Network Corp., 277 S.W.3d at 919. General statements about a “more reasonable” or\n“modest” rate are not evidence that the harm from late payment is difficult to estimate, or that the\nnormal billed charges were an unreasonable forecast of the loss actually sustained. See Phillips,\n820 S.W.2d at 788. GPA also emphasized that Baylor itself referred to the normal billed charge as\na “penalty.” The substance of the provision controls, however. See Arthur's Garage, Inc. v. Racal–\nChubb Security Systems, Inc., 997 S.W.2d 803, 810 (Tex.App.-Dallas 1999, no pet.) (provision\nentitled “liquidated damages” was actually a limitation of liability provision, so penalty analysis\nwas not appropriate). Because GPA did not meet its burden of establishing that the clause requiring\npayment of normal billed charges after 45 days was an unenforceable penalty, the trial judge did\nnot err in denying GPA's motion for summary judgment on this issue. We overrule GPA's second\nissue.\n\n\n *477 C. Claims arising before 2003\nIn its third issue, GPA argues the trial judge erred by awarding damages for the period of\ntime before GPA signed the Subscriber Acknowledgment Form. While GPA admits signing the\nSubscriber Services Agreement in 1998, it argues that it did not agree to “pay or arrange to pay”\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Therefore, GPA argues,\nany claims arising in 2002 or before were included improperly in the trial court's judgment.\n\nBaylor counters that GPA's obligations were set forth in the Subscriber Services Agreement,\nincluding the agreement to abide by any agreement between PHCS and a hospital, and those\nobligations did not change in 2003. Because GPA accepted the benefits of the agreements before\n2003, Baylor argues, it must also accept the obligations.\n\n [22] We agree with Baylor that GPA's obligation to abide by the HSA did not change in 2003.\nWhile the “pay or arrange to pay” language does not appear in the Subscriber Services Agreement,\nGPA did agree at that time to abide by the provisions of the HSA, and, as noted in Epoch\nGroup, “the very foundation” of the discounts offered to GPA's customers are “the agreements\nbetween PHCS and providers such as Baylor.” Epoch Group, 340 F.Supp.2d at 755. The Epoch\nGroup court commented that the payor acknowledgments “serve no apparent purpose other than\nto commit Payors to comply with the terms and conditions of the provider agreements.” Id.\nThe contractual relationship among the parties was established when GPA signed the Subscriber\nServices Agreement and began to take advantage of the discounted rates offered under the HSA.\nThe trial court did not err in awarding damages for the period of time before GPA signed the\nSubscriber Acknowledgment. We overrule GPA's third issue.\n\n\n\n                                                         CONCLUSION\n\nWe overrule GPA's issues and affirm the trial court's judgment.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    The trial court's judgment recites that the full name of the plaintiff is “Baylor Health Care System, on behalf of Baylor All Saints\n        Medical Center, Baylor Heart and Vascular Hospital, Baylor Specialty Hospital, Baylor Institute for Rehabilitation, Baylor University\n        Medical Center, Baylor Medical Center at Garland, Baylor Regional Medical Center at Grapevine, Baylor Medical Center at Irving,\n        Our Children's House at Baylor, Baylor Regional Medical Center at Plano, and Baylor Medical Center Ellis County.”\n2       The Subscriber Services Agreement was actually between PHCS and a Texas corporation named “Group & Pension Administrators,\n        Inc.” The parties entered into a Rule 11 agreement that “[f]or purposes of this case, G & P Administrators, Inc, and GPA Holding,\n        Inc. agree that they can be treated as one entity for the purpose of discovery and liability.” In accordance with this agreement, in\n        this opinion we will refer only to GPA.\n3       The Subscriber Services Agreement recites its purpose:\n           A.

Bellos, M.D.,\nP.A. and enforced a contractual liquidated damages clause against Healix Infusion Therapy, Inc.\nThe trial court awarded Dr. Bellos $10,000.00 in his suit against Healix. The trial court also\nawarded attorney's fees to Dr. Bellos. In two issues on appeal, Healix argues that the liquidated\ndamages clause is an unenforceable penalty and that there are genuine issues of material fact\nregarding damages. 1 We affirm.\n\nDr. Bellos sued Healix in another lawsuit; the parties reached a settlement in that suit. Both\nparties agreed not to disclose the nature of the settlement agreement. The agreement provided for\n$10,000.00 in liquidated damages in the event of a breach by either party. After the settlement\nagreement was signed, Methodist Hospitals of Dallas (Methodist), where Dr. Bellos practiced,\nsent $6,385.13, which it owed to Dr. Bellos, because it mistakenly believed that Healix held a lien\nagainst Dr. Bellos. Healix sent a letter and a copy of the settlement agreement to Methodist to show\nthat there was no lien. Dr. Bellos claimed that Healix breached the settlement agreement when\nHealix furnished the agreement to Methodist, and he sued Healix to recover under the liquidated\ndamages provision of the agreement.\n\nA trial court must grant a motion for summary judgment if the moving party establishes that no\ngenuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of\nlaw.

Bellos, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2003)\n2003 WL 22411873\n\nwhether a liquidated damages clause is enforceable or whether it is an unenforceable penalty is a\nquestion of law. Phillips v. Phillips, supra.\n\n *2 In this case, the initial burden was on the movant. However, when a party raises the affirmative\ndefense of penalty, that party assumes the burden to conclusively establish the defense. Baker v.\nInternational Record Syndicate, Inc., supra.Therefore, the burden was upon Healix to prove that\nthe contractual liquidated damages was an unenforceable penalty.\n\nThe settlement agreement offered as summary judgment evidence by Dr. Bellos showed that the\nparties agreed to keep the nature of the settlement agreement confidential. The parties further\nagreed that a breach of the confidentiality clause would result in imminent and irreparable harm\nand that the damages for a breach of confidentiality would be $10,000.00. Healix admitted in its\nresponse to Dr. Bellos's request for admissions that it agreed to the confidentiality of the agreement\nand that it agreed to the $10,000.00 liquidated damages clause. Dr. Bellos's affidavit reflected that\nhe agreed to the confidential nature of the agreement and that he had performed all acts required of\nhim under the settlement agreement. His affidavit further showed that Methodist subjected him to\na re-credentialing process every two years. He was unaware of how the disclosure of the agreement\nwould affect the re-credentialing process, but states that he has been harmed in a manner that is\n“incapable of or difficult of estimation.”\n\nAs part of its proof, Healix attached the affidavit of Heather Hughes–Glass, the corporate risk\nmanager for Healix. In her affidavit, Heather Hughes–Glass stated that, as soon as she became\naware of the confidentiality provision of the agreement that was sent to Methodist, she contacted\nDean Matthys, the corporate risk manager for Methodist, to have him destroy the agreement. She\nfurther stated that Matthys indicated that only he and his assistant were aware of the settlement\nagreement. Also included in the summary judgment evidence was an affidavit given by Matthys as\nwell as a letter from Matthys to Healix. These documents indicated that the copy of the settlement\nagreement was destroyed soon after it was received by Methodist and that the only two people to\nsee the agreement, Matthys and his assistant Lisa Irby, were not involved with the re-credentialing\nprocess at Methodist. Finally, Healix offered as summary judgment evidence Dr. Bellos's response\nto a request for disclosure that any economic damages suffered by Dr. Bellos were difficult to\nestimate.\n\nThis evidence does not meet the burden Healix must bear: that at the time the agreement was made\ndamages could be easily ascertained and that the amount of the liquidated damages award was not\na reasonable forecast of just compensation. Healix contends that the award of liquidated damages\nis disproportionate to the actual damages suffered by Dr. Bellos because Dr. Bellos did not have\nany actual damages. To emphasize this point, Healix relies on Baker.“If the liquidated damages are\nshown to be disproportionate to the actual damages, then the liquidated damages can be declared a\npenalty and recovery limited to actual damages proven.”Baker v. International Record Syndicate,\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   3\n\fHealix Infusion Therapy, Inc. v. Bellos, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2003)\n2003 WL 22411873\n\nInc., supra at 55.Healix still must show that, at the time the agreement was made, the amount of\nthe liquidated damages was not a reasonable forecast. To prove this defense, Healix must prove\nactual damages, if any, to show that the actual loss was not an approximation of the stipulated\nsum.Baker v. International Record Syndicate, Inc., supra.That damages are not yet ascertainable\nis not tantamount to evidence of “zero” damages.\n\n *3 The summary judgment evidence establishes that there was an agreement between Healix and\nDr. Bellos that prohibited the disclosure of the nature of the settlement agreement and that Dr.\nBellos performed all the required acts under the agreement. Healix breached the agreement by\nsending a copy of the agreement to Methodist. Because we find that Healix failed to meet its burden\nof proof on the penalty issue and because Healix failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact,\nwe hold that the trial court did not err when it granted Dr. Bellos's motion for summary judgment.\nHealix's issues on appeal are overruled.\n\nThe judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    The award of attorney's fees is not contested in this appeal.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                      © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Before judgment was entered on court-approved\nmediated settlement agreement, wife nonsuited divorce petition. Unaware of nonsuit, husband\nfiled counter-petition for divorce, seeking enforcement of settlement, denying paternity of second\nchild, and asserting various tort claims. Wife filed new petition for divorce. Ultimately, the\n312th District Court, Harris County, James D.

The court's opinion of November 10, 1999, is\nwithdrawn and this opinion is substituted in its place.\n\nIn this original proceeding, relator seeks a writ of mandamus directing the trial court to vacate two\norders in the underlying divorce case: (1) denying reinstatement of an “original counter petition”\nfor divorce, and (2) setting aside a mediated settlement agreement. Because the first order is not\nreviewable by mandamus and the second order was not a clear abuse of discretion, we deny the\nwrit.\n\n\n\n                                              Background\n\nLuckmi Kasschau (“Luckmi”), the real party in interest, sued relator, Richard Allan Kasschau\n(“Richard”), for divorce in the 312th District Court of Harris County. In her petition, Luckmi\nsought not only dissolution of the marriage, but also conservatorship and support of their two\nchildren and division of the community estate. Richard answered the suit with a general denial, a\nplea for confirmation of his separate property, and a request for reimbursement, attorney's fees, and\nexpenses. The parties subsequently agreed to mediation. The parties settled all issues at mediation\nand the court approved the settlement. 1\n\nBefore the court entered judgment, however, Luckmi nonsuited her divorce petition. Unaware\nof the nonsuit, Richard filed an “original counter-petition” for divorce. In his counter-petition,\nRichard sought enforcement of the mediated settlement agreement, denied paternity of the second\nchild born during the marriage, and asserted various tort claims against Luckmi and Shivi Kumar\nPawa (“Shivi”), the alleged father of the second child. Luckmi subsequently filed in the same court\na new petition for divorce, seeking the same relief sought in her first suit. Luckmi also denied\nRichard's paternity of the second child and sought various temporary orders.\n\nMeanwhile, back in the first suit, Richard filed a motion to reinstate his counter-petition for\ndivorce and to consolidate the two divorce actions. He also asked the court to enter judgment\non the mediated settlement agreement. Luckmi opposed the motion for judgment, asserting that:\n(1) certain conditions precedent to judgment had not been satisfied; namely, Shivi had not\nfiled an intervention as contemplated *309 by the settlement agreement, and (2) the settlement\nagreement was void because it required Richard to turn over certain audiotape recordings of\nLuckmi for destruction by the parties' attorneys, an act Luckmi claimed would be illegal. See TEX.\nPEN.CODE ANN. §§ 16.02(b)(1), 37.09(a)(1) (Vernon 1994).\n\nAt a hearing on these motions, the trial court granted the motion to consolidate the two divorce\nactions based on its conclusion that Luckmi's nonsuit did not defeat the mediated settlement\nagreement. The court, however, denied Richard's motion to reinstate the counter-petition, finding\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The court withdrew its approval\nof the mediated settlement agreement, finding the agreement void and unenforceable because it\nrequired performance of an illegal act. The court put its first two rulings in writing by order signed\nthe same day as the hearing.\n\nAfter the hearing, Richard filed a request to enforce the terms of the mediated settlement\nagreement, except for the allegedly illegal provision. In the meantime, Shivi filed an intervention\nseeking to establish paternity, conservatorship and support of the second child. After the trial court\nsigned an order setting aside the entire mediated settlement agreement, Richard filed this petition\nfor writ of mandamus. 2\n\n\n\n                                               Mandamus\n\n [1] Mandamus relief is available if the trial court violates a duty imposed by law or clearly\nabuses its discretion, either in resolving factual issues or in determining legal issues when there\nis no adequate remedy at law. See Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 839–40 (Tex.1992). A\ntrial court clearly abuses its discretion by making an arbitrary and unreasonable decision that\namounts to a clear and prejudicial error of law. See Johnson v. Fourth Court of Appeals, 700\nS.W.2d 916, 917 (Tex.1985). Richard complains the trial court violated a duty imposed by law\nby refusing to reinstate his counter-petition and declining to enter judgment on the mediated\nsettlement agreement. We address each of these complaints and the question of whether Richard\nhas an adequate remedy by appeal.\n\n\n\n                                 Reinstatement of the Counter–Petition\n\n [2] [3] [4] Richard first contends the trial court violated a ministerial duty by refusing to\nreinstate his “original counter-petition,” even though it was filed after Luckmi's nonsuit. Under\nTexas Rule of Civil Procedure 162, a plaintiff has an absolute, unqualified right to take a nonsuit\nbefore she introduces all her evidence, as long as the defendant has not made a claim for affirmative\nrelief. See BHP Petroleum Co., Inc. v. Millard, 800 S.W.2d 838, 840 (Tex.1990); General Land\nOffice v. OXY U.S.A., Inc., 789 S.W.2d 569, 570 (Tex.1990); Greenberg v. Brookshire, 640 S.W.2d\n870, 871 (Tex.1982) (per curiam). The trial court's refusal to grant a nonsuit in the absence of\na defendant's claim for affirmative relief violates a ministerial duty and can be corrected by\nmandamus. See Quanto Int'l Co., Inc. v. Lloyd, 897 S.W.2d 482, 485 (Tex.App.—Houston [1st\nDist.] 1995, orig. proceeding). Similarly, the trial court's reinstatement of a case after the court has\nlost jurisdiction because of a nonsuit may also be reviewed by *310 mandamus. See id. (citing\nJohnson v. Harless, 651 S.W.2d 259, 260 (Tex.1983). Neither of these situations is present here.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   3\n\fIn re Kasschau, 11 S.W.3d 305 (1999)\n\n\n\n\n [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] The trial court did not refuse to grant a nonsuit nor did it attempt to reinstate\nthe case without jurisdiction to do so. Instead, the court merely refused to consider Richard's\ncounter-petition for divorce. We can see no reason to remedy the court's ruling by mandamus\nrather than by an appeal. The requirement that a person seeking mandamus relief establish the lack\nof an appellate remedy is a “fundamental tenet” of mandamus practice. See In re Masonite Corp.,\n997 S.W.2d 194, 199–201 (Tex. 1999) (J. Baker dissenting) (and cases cited therein). An appellate\nremedy is not inadequate merely because it may involve more expense or delay than obtaining\nmandamus. See id. Although, on rare occasions, exceptional circumstances may justify mandamus\nrelief despite the presence of a generally adequate appellate remedy, such circumstances do not\nexist when a trial court's ruling is merely incidental to the trial process and does not permanently\ndeprive a party of substantial rights. See id. at 199–201. Furthermore, the mere fact that a trial\ncourt's erroneous order will result in an eventual reversal on appeal does not mean that trial will be\na “waste of judicial resources.” See id. Rather, mandamus should issue only in situations involving\nmanifest and urgent necessity and not for grievances to which other remedies may apply. See id.\nat 198–99. Because Richard neglects to explain why the court's ruling on his motion to reinstate\ncannot be remedied by an appeal, we decline to address the court's ruling by mandamus.\n\n\n\n                          Judgment on the Mediated Settlement Agreement\n\nRichard also contends the trial court violated a ministerial duty by refusing to enter judgment on\nthe mediated settlement agreement. Sections 6.602(b) and 153.0071(d) of the Family Code state\nthat “a mediated settlement agreement is binding on the parties if the agreement: (1) provides in\na separate paragraph that the agreement is not subject to revocation; (2) is signed by each party\nto the agreement; and (3) is signed by the parties' attorney, if any, who is present at the time\nthe agreement is signed.” Section 157.0071(d) adds the requirement of “an underlined statement\nthat the agreement is not subject to revocation.” Finally, subsections (c) and (e) of these statutes\nprovide that “a party is entitled to judgment” on a mediated settlement agreement that meets the\nabove requirements “notwithstanding Rule 11 ... or another rule of law.”\n\n [10] It is undisputed that the mediated settlement agreement in the underlying case meets the\nrequirements of sections 6.602(b) and 153.0071(d). Relying on these Family Code provisions,\nRichard argues that Luckmi could not revoke her consent to the agreement by nonsuiting her\ndivorce action and that the trial court violated a ministerial duty by refusing to enter judgment on\nthe agreement. Citing the noted arbitration case, Jack B. Anglin v. Tipps, 842 S.W.2d 266, 271–73\n(Tex.1992), Richard also argues that without mandamus relief, he will be deprived of the rapid,\ninexpensive alternative to litigation provided by the Family Code. We need not compare mediated\nsettlement agreements under the Family Code to arbitration agreements. Instead, we conclude that\nRichard lacks an adequate remedy from the trial court's ruling because he will be deprived of the\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 4\n\fIn re Kasschau, 11 S.W.3d 305 (1999)\n\n\n\nsettlement's benefits if forced to expend further time and resources litigating a suit that may have\nbeen settled. See, e.g., Mantas v. Fifth Court of Appeals, 925 S.W.2d 656, 659 (Tex.1996) (holding\nthat relator who settled case on appeal lacked adequate remedy for appellate court's refusal to\nabate appeal pending suit to enforce settlement agreement); see also Harris County Appraisal Dist.\nv. Johnson, 889 S.W.2d 531, 533–34 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1994, orig. proceeding)\n(mandamus *311 is appropriate to compel a district judge to proceed to trial and judgment).\n\n [11] While we find the court's refusal to enter judgment on the mediated settlement agreement is\na proper subject for mandamus, we conclude that the trial court did not violate a ministerial duty in\nthis case. One of the two reported cases addressing section 153.0071 of the Family Code holds that\nsubsection (e) requires the trial court to enter judgment on a mediated settlement agreement that\nmeets the requirements of subsection (d). See Alvarez v. Reiser, 958 S.W.2d 232, 234 (Tex.App.\n—Eastland 1997, writ denied). 3 In Alvarez, the husband sued the wife for divorce. 958 S.W.2d\nat 233. The wife answered and filed a cross-petition for divorce. See id. At mediation, the parties\nreached a settlement agreement that complied with the requirements of section 153.071(d). See\nid. The trial court entered judgment on the mediated settlement agreement even though the wife\nhad withdrawn her consent to the agreement. See id. The wife appealed and the appellate court\naffirmed, concluding that: (1) a party's unilateral withdrawal of consent does not negate the\nenforceability of a mediated settlement agreement that complies with section 153.0071(d), and (2)\n“a separate suit for enforcement of a contract [i]s not necessary.” Id. at 234.\n\nHere, the issue is not whether Luckmi could revoke her consent to the mediated settlement\nagreement, but whether the agreement itself was valid and enforceable. Notably, the lower court\ndid not rule that Luckmi had revoked her consent to the mediated settlement agreement by taking\na nonsuit. To the contrary, in consolidating the two divorce actions, the court expressly stated that\nLuckmi's nonsuit did not defeat the agreement. Instead of immediately entering judgment on the\nmediated settlement agreement, however, the trial court reviewed the agreement and concluded\nit was void.\n\n [12] [13] [14] Neither the plain language of the Family Code nor the holding in Alvarez\nforeclose the court's action. First, as noted, sections 6.602 and 153.0071 of the Family Code\nprovide that “a party is entitled to judgment” on a mediated settlement agreement if certain\nrequirements of those statutes are met. Where, as here, the legislature has not defined the terms\nin the statute, we must apply their ordinary meaning. See In re Clark, 977 S.W.2d 152, 156\n(Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1998, orig. proceeding). “Entitle” means in part “to grant a legal\nright to or qualify for.” See BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 553 (7th ed.1999). That a party\nhas a “right to” judgment, or “qualifies for” judgment on a mediated settlement agreement does\nnot deprive the court of discretion to review an agreement before entering judgment. Second,\nwhile Alvarez precludes a party from revoking consent to a mediated settlement agreement that\ncomplies with section 153.0071, it does not hold that the court's duty to enter judgment on such\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  5\n\fIn re Kasschau, 11 S.W.3d 305 (1999)\n\n\n\nan agreement is ministerial. A court's duty to enter judgment on a settlement agreement becomes\nministerial only after it has first rendered judgment on that agreement. See In re Bland, 960\nS.W.2d 123, 124 (Tex.App. Houston [1st Dist.] 1997, orig. proceeding) (J. O' Connor dissenting)\n(citing Dunn v. Dunn, 439 S.W.2d 830, 832 (Tex.1969)); see also In the Marriage of Beavers,\n648 S.W.2d 729, 732 (Tex.App.—Amarillo 1983, no writ). Here, the trial court approved the\nsettlement agreement, but never rendered judgment on the agreement. See, e.g., S & A Restaurant\nCorp. v. Leal, 892 S.W.2d 855, 857–58 (Tex.1995) (holding that approval of a settlement does not\nnecessarily constitute a rendition of judgment in the absence of a clear intent to render judgment).\nAs a *312 result, the court had no ministerial duty to enter judgment and thus, did not violate\nsuch a duty.\n\nNotwithstanding this legal conclusion, the facts of the underlying case demonstrate that the\nparties did not intend for the court to immediately enter judgment on the settlement agreement.\nSpecifically, the mediated settlement agreement expressly contemplates certain contingencies in\nconnection with Shivi's intervention. It states that the court would likely require an intervention\nto resolve certain issues regarding the second child and that entry of a decree would be delayed,\nand agreed temporary orders entered while these issues were resolved. Thus, the facts of this\ncase establish the trial court's discretion to review the agreement before entering judgment.\nAccordingly, we hold that the trial court did not violate a ministerial duty by refusing to enter\njudgment on the mediated settlement agreement.\n\n\n\n                           Legality of the Mediated Settlement Agreement\n\n [15] [16] [17] [18] Finally, Richard contends the trial court clearly abused its discretion by\nsetting aside the entire mediated settlement agreement on grounds of illegality. “A contract to do\na thing which cannot be performed without violation of the law” violates public policy and is\nvoid. See Lewis v. Davis, 145 Tex. 468, 199 S.W.2d 146, 148–49 (1947); see also Montgomery v.\nBrowder, 930 S.W.2d 772, 778 (Tex.App.—Amarillo 1996, writ denied). The rationale behind the\nrule is not to protect or punish either party to the contract, but to benefit and protect the public. See\nMontgomery, 930 S.W.2d at 778; see also Plumlee v. Paddock, 832 S.W.2d 757, 759 (Tex.App.-\nFort Worth 1992, writ denied). Because of the presumption in Texas that contracting parties are\nknowledgeable of the law and contract accordingly, courts will generally leave the parties as they\nfind them. See id. Thus, “where the illegality does not appear on the face of the contract, it will not\nbe held void unless facts showing its illegality are before the court.” See Lewis, 199 S.W.2d at 149.\nHere, the trial court concluded from the facts before it that the settlement agreement called for the\nperformance of an illegal act. See TEX. PEN.CODE ANN. § 16.02(a)(1) (Vernon 1994) (“ a person\ncommits an offense if he intentionally intercepts ... a wire, oral, or electronic communication”).\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  6\n\fIn re Kasschau, 11 S.W.3d 305 (1999)\n\n\n\nAt the hearing on Richard's motions, the court heard uncontroverted testimony that Richard\nsecretly tape recorded Luckmi's phone conversations with various third persons. 4 Aware of these\ntape recordings at the time of mediation, the parties put the following provision in their settlement\nagreement:\n\n\n   Husband ordered to deliver all tape recordings of Wife and transcripts and all copies thereof\n   to Linda Marshall [husband's attorney] by 5:00 p.m., five days after entry of decree. Attorneys\n   to meet, inspect, and destroy all of same. Parties enjoined from disseminating or distributing a\n   copy of tapes or transcripts.\n [19] [20] Taking into account that Shivi and others might urge authorities to bring criminal\ncharges against Richard, the court concluded that this provision illegally required the parties to\ndestroy evidence in a potential criminal proceeding brought at the instance of non-parties to the\nsettlement agreement. 5 *313 Section 37.09(d)(1) of the Penal Code states that “a person commits\nan offense if the person knowing that an offense has been committed, alters, destroys, or conceals\nany record, document or thing with intent to impair its verity, legibility or availability as evidence\nin any subsequent investigation or official proceeding.” TEX. PEN.CODE ANN. § 37.09(d)(1)\n(Vernon Supp.1999) (emphasis added). This statute makes it a crime to alter or destroy evidence of\na crime even before the commencement of a criminal proceeding. Richard argues the provision in\nquestion is legal because it does not require immediate destruction of the tapes and correspondingly\nprohibits dissemination of them. The Penal Code does not provide a time after which a person,\nknowing that an offense has been committed, may legally destroy evidence. Richard contends,\nhowever, that “if they waited until the statute of limitations expired ... the agreement would be\nfully and lawfully performed.” We reject the notion that once the statute of limitations on the state\nwire tap law runs, destruction of the tapes would no longer violate § 37.09(d)(1), and, therefore,\ncould not be characterized as an illegal act. 6 Richard's argument incorrectly assumes that the mere\npassage of time transforms an illegal act into a legal one. The statute of limitations is an affirmative\ndefense; it does not bar prosecution for violation of a statute. See Proctor v. State, 967 S.W.2d\n840, 844 (Tex.Crim.App.1998) (defense created by statute of limitations is forfeited if not asserted\nbefore the guilt/innocence stage of trial). An act prohibited by § 37.09(d)(1) does not magically\nbecome legal upon the expiration of the statute of limitations. While the running of the limitations\nperiod provides the accused with a potential defense to any prosecution for violation of the statute,\nit does not change the nature or character of the act. For this reason, we are unable to find that the\ntrial court committed a clear and prejudicial error of law by declaring the settlement agreement\nillegal and unenforceable based on its finding that the agreement, on its face, called for a violation\nof § 37.09(d)(1).\n\n [21] [22] [23] Nevertheless, Richard argues the court abused its discretion in refusing to\neliminate any illegal provision and enforce the remainder of the settlement agreement. As a general\nrule, where part of the consideration for an agreement is illegal, the entire agreement is void if the\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The doctrine of severability\nis an exception that applies in circumstances in which the original consideration for the contract is\nlegal, but incidental promises within the contract are found to be illegal. See id. In such a case, the\ncourt may sever the invalid provision and uphold the valid portion, provided the invalid provision\ndoes not constitute the main or essential purpose of the agreement. See Rogers v. Wolfson, 763\nS.W.2d 922, 925 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1989, writ denied). Severability of the contract is determined\nby the intent of the parties as evidenced by the language in the contract. See Montgomery, 930\nS.W.2d at 778–79; see also McFarland v. Haby, 589 S.W.2d 521, 524 (Tex.App.—Austin 1979,\nwrit ref'd n.r.e.). The issue is whether the parties would have entered into the agreement absent the\nillegal parts. See Rogers, 763 S.W.2d at 925; see also McFarland, 589 S.W.2d at 524. Therefore,\nwe must determine the central and essential purpose of the settlement agreement.\n\nRichard argues that the resolution of the various issues related to divorce, not the destruction of the\ntapes, was the essential purpose of the settlement agreement. In contrast, Luckmi argues that the\ndestruction *314 of the tapes was the consideration for her release of claims against Richard and,\nthus, was an essential purpose of the agreement. Given the structure of the settlement agreement\nand its interrelated terms and provisions, we cannot say that the trial court acted without reference\nto guiding rules and principles in concluding that the agreement is entire and indivisible. Because\nthe court found part of the consideration for the settlement agreement illegal, it was justified in\nfinding the entire agreement void and unenforceable. Therefore, we find the trial court did not\nabuse its discretion by declaring the entire agreement void and refusing to enforce it.\n\n [24] [25] Lastly, Richard argues that Luckmi is estopped from questioning the agreement's\nvalidity because she accepted a $1000 cash payment under its terms. A void contract cannot be\nrendered enforceable by estoppel. See Reyes v. Storage & Processors, Inc., 995 S.W.2d 722, 725\nn. 3 (Tex.App.—San Antonio 1999, pet. filed) (holding that employee who accepted benefits of\nvoid agreement limiting worker's compensation benefits was not estopped from complaining about\nagreement). Thus, Luckmi is not estopped from questioning the agreement's validity. Therefore,\nwe find no clear abuse of discretion by the trial court in setting aside the entire agreement.\n\n\n\n                                               Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, we recognize that there are competing public policy interests at stake here.\nOn the one hand, courts are responsible for carrying out this state's policy of encouraging\nthe peaceable resolution of disputes involving the parent-child relationship through voluntary\nsettlement procedures. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. §§ 154.002, 154.003 (Vernon\n1997). On the other hand, public policy prohibits courts from enforcing illegal contracts. See Lewis,\n199 S.W.2d at 151; see also Montgomery, 930 S.W.2d at 778. Here, we are unable to find the\ntrial court violated the public policy encouraging settlements by refusing to enforce a settlement\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Accordingly, because the trial court neither\nviolated a duty imposed by law nor clearly abused its discretion by refusing to enter judgment on\nthe mediated settlement agreement, we deny mandamus relief.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    The copy of the mediated settlement agreement provided by Richard is neither file-stamped nor signed by the court. Nevertheless,\n       the reporter's record from a later hearing establishes that the court signed and approved the agreement.\n2      Luckmi objects to the documents included in the appendix to the petition. These were the only documents provided in support of\n       mandamus relief. A petition for writ of mandamus must contain an appendix, which must include “a certified or sworn copy of any\n       order complained of, or any other document showing the matter complained of.” See TEX.R.APP. P.2.3(j). The orders of which\n       Richard complains are included in the appendix and appear to be signed by the trial court, but are not file-stamped. The verification\n       of Richard's counsel states only “that the pleadings contained in the appendix are true and correct copies.” While the verification\n       makes no mention of “orders, motions or other documents,” we construe “pleadings” in this instance to include all the documents\n       in the appendix.\n3      Spinks v. Spinks, 939 S.W.2d 229 (Tex.App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1997, no writ) is the only other reported case addressing section\n       153.0071. In that case, the court held that a party could revoke a mediated settlement agreement that did not comply with section\n       153.071(d). See id. at 230.\n4      Luckmi testified that after filing for divorce, she discovered a recording device attached to a phone in the garage of the house where\n       she and Richard lived. She testified that the device also contained a tape of her conversations with others including, her mother,\n       Shivi, and friends. Luckmi testified that she was unaware of the recording device or the tape and that she did not give permission to\n       anyone to record her conversations. Luckmi also testified that when she confronted Richard, he acknowledged installing the device\n       and making the recordings. When Richard was questioned on this topic, his counsel invoked the Fifth Amendment on Richard's\n       behalf and instructed him not to answer.\n5      These non-parties include Shivi. Under the settlement agreement, Richard agreed to release Shivi of all claims, except for child\n       support. However, the release was conditioned on Shivi releasing claims against Richard.\n6      We note that § 37.09(d)(1) applies to the destruction of evidence that might be used in “any subsequent investigation or official\n       proceeding” and is not limited to a violation of the state wire tap laws.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                          © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

We must decide\nwhether any or all of these provisions are unconscionable and, if they are, whether the contract's\nseverability clause preserves the arbitration right. We hold that the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in allowing the arbitrator to assess the unconscionability of the agreement's fee-splitting\nand discovery-limitation provisions as applied in the course of arbitration. We further hold that\nthe arbitration agreement's provisions precluding remedies under the Workers' Compensation Act\nare substantively unconscionable and void under Texas law. However, those provisions are not\nintegral to the parties' overall intended purpose to arbitrate their disputes and, pursuant to the\nagreement's severability clause, are severable from the remainder of the arbitration agreement,\nwhich we conclude is otherwise enforceable. Accordingly, we conditionally grant the petition for\nmandamus.\n\n\n\n                                                       I. Facts\n\nJohnny Luna began his employment with Pol–Tex International, d/b/a Poly–America, L.P., in\nOctober 1998. Upon his hiring, Luna signed an agreement to submit “all claims or disputes” to\narbitration. Approximately four years later, Luna signed an amended agreement to arbitrate that\ncontained substantially the same provisions. Both the 1998 and 2002 agreements provide that\nthey are governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). 9 U.S.C. §§ 1–14. Additionally, both\nagreements contain a series of requirements for the arbitration between the parties. All claims\nmust be asserted within a maximum of one year from the occurrence of the event from which\nthe claim arises. Fees associated with arbitration—including but not limited to mediation fees, the\narbitrators' fees, court reporter fees, and fees to secure a place for a hearing—are to be split between\nthe parties, with the employee's share capped at “the gross compensation earned by the Employee\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Parties may not use written depositions or requests\nfor admission; the agreement prohibits discovery of either party's financial information except\nfor the employee's earnings if the employee seeks lost wages, back pay, and/or front pay; and all\naspects of the arbitration are deemed confidential. Finally, the arbitrator is stripped of authority to\naward punitive, exemplary, or liquidated damages, or to order reinstatement of employment.\n\nIn December 2002, Luna suffered a work-related neck injury when he accidentally hit his head on\na pipe. Poly–America's company doctor examined Luna and diagnosed him with an acute cervical\nspine flexion injury. Luna subsequently filed a workers' compensation claim and began receiving\nphysical therapy. Approximately two weeks later, Luna returned to work on a release for light\nduty; however, Luna continued to suffer pain and utilized previously scheduled vacation time to\nrecover from his injury. After being warned by the company doctor that he needed to return to\nwork and get off of workers' compensation if he wanted to keep his job, *345 Luna returned to\nwork without restrictions on January 10, 2003. Upon his return, Luna noticed that another person\nwas already being trained for his position, and he claims that his supervisor began to harass him.\nOne month later, Luna told his supervisor that his neck continued to bother him and that he needed\nto return to the company doctor; the next day that Luna was scheduled to work, he was fired.\n\nLuna filed this suit asserting claims for unlawful retaliatory discharge under section 451.001 of the\nLabor Code (“the Workers' Compensation Act”). TEX. LAB.CODE § 451.001–.003. Claiming\nthat Poly–America acted with malice, ill will, spite, or specific intent to cause injury, Luna sought\nboth reinstatement and the imposition of punitive damages. He additionally sought a declaratory\njudgment that the arbitration agreement was unenforceable because, among other reasons, its\nprovisions violated public policy and were unconscionable. Luna submitted two affidavits—his\nown, and that of an expert witness—in support of his claims. Poly–America responded with a\nmotion to compel arbitration which, after a hearing, the trial court granted.\n\nLuna sought a writ of mandamus in the court of appeals, reasserting his argument that provisions\nof the arbitration agreement were substantively unconscionable. The court of appeals held that,\nin light of the fee-splitting provisions and limitations on remedies, the arbitration agreement as a\nwhole was substantively unconscionable. 175 S.W.3d 315, 318. Poly–America sought review in\nthis Court. We hold that the arbitration agreement's provision that eliminates available remedies\nunder the Workers' Compensation Act is unenforceable, but we find that provision severable from\nthe arbitration agreement as a whole and conditionally grant Poly–America's writ of mandamus.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 1237\n\n\n\n\n                                             II. Standard of Review\n\n [1] [2] Mandamus is the proper means by which to seek review of an order compelling arbitration\nunder the FAA. In re Am. Homestar of Lancaster, Inc., 50 S.W.3d 480, 483 (Tex.2001). In In\nre Palacios, we recognized that it is “important for federal and state law to be as consistent\nas possible” in enforcement and review of provisions under the FAA. 221 S.W.3d 564, 565\n(Tex.2006) (per curiam) (quoting In re Kellogg Brown & Root, Inc., 166 S.W.3d 732, 739\n(Tex.2005)). Federal courts may not review orders compelling arbitration and staying litigation\n(“compel-and-stay orders”) by interlocutory appeal. See 9 U.S.C. § 16(b)(1) (“[A]n appeal may not\nbe taken from an interlocutory order ... granting a stay of any action under Section 3 of this title.”).\nAccordingly, as we noted in Palacios, it would be inappropriate to exercise our own mandamus\npower in a manner inconsistent with the federal courts' practice. See Palacios, 221 S.W.3d at\n565. Although mandamus review is generally available in federal courts to review non-appealable\ninterlocutory rulings, mandamus is granted only in exceptional cases. See generally Gulfstream\nAerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp., 485 U.S. 271, 288–90 & n. 13, 108 S.Ct. 1133, 99 L.Ed.2d\n296 (1988) (holding that, where a particular order is not appealable, mandamus is available and\n“will be appropriate in exceptional cases”). As we acknowledged in Palacios, federal courts have\napplied this template to orders that cannot be appealed under the FAA, although they almost\nnever grant mandamus relief. 221 S.W.3d at 565–66 (“Even after Green Tree [Financial Corp.—\nAlabama v. Randolph, 531 U.S. 79, 121 S.Ct. 513, 148 L.Ed.2d 373 (2000)], the Fifth Circuit has\nheld that federal mandamus review of an order staying a case for arbitration may still be available if\na party can meet a ‘particularly *346 heavy’ mandamus burden to show ‘clearly and indisputably\nthat the district court did not have the discretion to stay the proceedings pending arbitration.’ ”)\n(quoting Apache Bohai Corp. v. Texaco China, B.V., 330 F.3d 307, 310–11 (5th Cir.2003)). This\ngeneral rule has been broadly applied to unappealable ancillary interlocutory orders in proceedings\nunder the FAA, see, e.g., Georgiou v. Mobil Exploration & Prod. Servs., Inc. U.S., 190 F.3d 538,\n1999 WL 642871 at *3 (5th Cir. July 27, 1999) (dismissing appeal of order staying litigation\nin favor of arbitration proceeding in foreign forum, and denying mandamus because plaintiffs\nfailed to carry the “particularly heavy burden” to warrant mandamus relief from such an order);\nCofab Inc. v. Phila. Joint Bd., Amalgamated Clothing & Textile Workers Union, AFL–CIO–CLC,\n141 F.3d 105, 110 (3d Cir.1998); and appears to also apply to compel-and-stay orders under\nsection 16(b)(1), see Douglas v. U.S. Dist. Court, 495 F.3d 1062, 1065 (9th Cir.2007) (granting\nmandamus relief from compel-and-stay order); Manion v. Nagin, 255 F.3d 535, 538–40 & n.\n4 (8th Cir.2001) (dismissing appeal of various interlocutory orders, including order compelling\narbitration, and denying mandamus because Manion had not made “any showing that he [was]\nentitled to such extraordinary relief”); McDermott Int'l, Inc. v. Underwriters at Lloyds Subscribing\nto Memorandum of Ins. No. 104207, 981 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1993) (“This court has recognized\nthat [mandamus review of an order compelling arbitration] may be available [but] McDermott has\nfailed to satisfy [the] demanding standard.”). 1\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   4\n\fIn re Poly-America, L.P., 262 S.W.3d 337 (2008)\n156 Lab.Cas. P 60,669, 28 IER Cases 140, 51 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1237\n\n\n\n [3] [4] [5] Although federal precedent in this area is not uniformly clear, it appears a\nfederal court would be permitted—albeit not compelled—to address the merits of the mandamus\narguments in this case. If such review were categorically unavailable and unconscionability\ndeterminations the sole realm of arbitrators, as the dissenting Justice proposes, development of\nthe law as to this threshold issue would be substantially hindered if not precluded altogether.\nNevertheless, federal precedent counsels against granting relief unless the stringent requirements\nfor mandamus are met. See Gulfstream, 485 U.S. at 289, 108 S.Ct. 1133. Federal courts grant\nmandamus only upon demonstration of a “clear and indisputable” right to issuance of the writ:\n“First, the party seeking the issuance of the writ must have no other adequate means to attain\nthe relief he desires.... Second, the petitioner must satisfy the burden of showing that his right\nto issuance of the writ is clear and indisputable. Third ... the issuing court, in the exercise of its\ndiscretion, must be satisfied that the writ is appropriate under the circumstances.” Cheney v. U.S.\nDist. Court, 542 U.S. 367, 380–81, 124 S.Ct. 2576, 159 L.Ed.2d 459 (2004). Our own mandamus\nstandard is similar, requiring a demonstration that *347 the trial court clearly abused its discretion\nby failing to correctly analyze or apply the law and a determination that the benefits of mandamus\noutweigh the detriments such that an appellate remedy is inadequate. See In re Prudential Ins.\nCo. of Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 135–36 (Tex.2004). Because arbitration is intended to provide a\nlower-cost, expedited means to resolve disputes, mandamus proceedings will often, if not always,\ndeprive the parties of an arbitration agreement's intended benefits when a compel-and-stay order\nis at issue; accordingly, courts should be hesitant to intervene. With these standards in mind, we\nturn to the compel-and-stay order in this case.\n\n\n\n                        III. Unconscionability and the Federal Arbitration Act\n\n [6] [7] Poly–America argues that the FAA's “strong presumption” favoring arbitration applies\nin this case, and furthermore that the FAA preempts all state public-policy grounds for finding\nthe agreement to arbitrate unenforceable. See In re R & R Personnel Specialists of Tyler, Inc.,\n146 S.W.3d 699, 705 (Tex.App.—Tyler2004) (holding that the FAA preempts “any public policy\nunderlying the Texas workers' compensation statutes that is contrary to the enforceability of\narbitration agreements”). Because neither this presumption nor federal preemption applies in a\nstate court's assessment of whether parties have entered into a valid and enforceable agreement to\narbitrate under state contract law, we disagree.\n\n [8] Section 2 of the FAA provides that arbitration agreements “shall be valid, irrevocable, and\nenforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.”\n9 U.S.C. § 2 (emphasis added). Thus, an agreement to arbitrate is valid under the FAA if it meets\nthe requirements of the general contract law of the applicable state. In re AdvancePCS Health\nL.P., 172 S.W.3d 603, 606 (Tex.2005) (citing First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 5\n\fIn re Poly-America, L.P., 262 S.W.3d 337 (2008)\n156 Lab.Cas. P 60,669, 28 IER Cases 140, 51 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1237\n\n938, 944, 115 S.Ct. 1920, 131 L.Ed.2d 985 (1995)). In determining the validity of an agreement\nto arbitrate under the FAA, courts must first apply state law governing contract formation. See 9\nU.S.C. § 2; First Options, 514 U.S. at 944, 115 S.Ct. 1920.\n\n [9] [10] The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized that “state law, whether of\nlegislative or judicial origin, is applicable [to the determination of the validity of an agreement to\narbitrate] if that law arose to govern issues concerning the validity, revocability, and enforceability\nof contracts generally.” Perry v. Thomas, 482 U.S. 483, 493 n. 9, 107 S.Ct. 2520, 96 L.Ed.2d\n426 (1987). Thus, courts “may not ... invalidate arbitration agreements under state laws applicable\nonly to arbitration provisions.” Doctor's Assocs., Inc. v. Casarotto, 517 U.S. 681, 687, 116 S.Ct.\n1652, 134 L.Ed.2d 902 (1996); see also Perry, 482 U.S. at 493 n. 9, 107 S.Ct. 2520 (“A state-\nlaw principle that takes its meaning precisely from the fact that a contract to arbitrate is at issue\ndoes not comport with [section 2].”).\n\n [11] [12] However, the purpose and language of the FAA require only that agreements to\narbitrate be placed “upon the same footing as other contracts.” Doctor's Assocs., 517 U.S. at 687,\n116 S.Ct. 1652 (quoting Scherk v. Alberto–Culver Co., 417 U.S. 506, 511, 94 S.Ct. 2449, 41\nL.Ed.2d 270 (1974)) (emphasis added); see also H.R. REP. NO. 68–96, at 1 (1924) (noting that\nby enacting section 2, Congress sought to place agreements to arbitrate “upon the same footing\nas other contracts, where [they] belong[ ]”). Perry makes clear that state courts may not fashion\nspecial rules regarding the enforceability *348 of arbitration contracts per se. See Perry, 482 U.S.\nat 492 n. 9, 107 S.Ct. 2520. Furthermore, once an enforceable contract to arbitrate is found, there is\na strong federal presumption in favor of arbitration such that myriad doubts—as to waiver, scope,\nand other issues not relating to enforceability—must be resolved in favor of arbitration. See, e.g., In\nre FirstMerit Bank, 52 S.W.3d 749, 752 (Tex.2001); Prudential Sec. Inc. v. Marshall, 909 S.W.2d\n896, 898–99 (Tex.1995). However, a state court must initially determine—through the neutral\napplication of its own contract law—whether an enforceable agreement exists in the first instance,\nand whether “generally applicable contract defenses ... may be applied to invalidate arbitration\nagreements without contravening” the policies of the FAA. Doctor's Assocs., 517 U.S. at 687, 116\nS.Ct. 1652. Thus, in this case, if a contract limiting damages or restricting other remedies under the\nWorkers' Compensation Act is generally unenforceable under Texas law, an arbitration contract\nwith these same limitations will also be unenforceable.\n\n [13] [14] Nevertheless, under Texas law, as with any other contract, agreements to arbitrate\nare valid unless grounds exist at law or in equity for revocation of the agreement. The burden\nof proving such a ground—such as fraud, unconscionability or voidness under public policy—\nfalls on the party opposing the contract. See FirstMerit Bank, 52 S.W.3d at 756. Thus, while\nwe reject Poly–America's assertions that we must apply a presumption favoring arbitration in\nassessing whether the parties entered into an enforceable agreement under Texas law and that\nthe FAA preempts Texas public policies that may make certain contractual provisions generally\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Arbitration and Unconscionability Under Texas Law\n\n\n                                              A. General Standard\n\n [15] Agreements to arbitrate disputes between employers and employees are generally\nenforceable under Texas law; there is nothing per se unconscionable about an agreement to\narbitrate employment disputes and, in fact, Texas law has historically favored agreements to\nresolve such disputes by arbitration. See Advance PCS, 172 S.W.3d at 608; EZ Pawn Corp. v.\nMancias, 934 S.W.2d 87, 90 (Tex.1996); Cantella & Co. v. Goodwin, 924 S.W.2d 943, 944\n(Tex.1996).\n\n [16] [17] [18] [19] Unconscionable contracts, however—whether relating to arbitration or not\n—are unenforceable under Texas law. A contract is unenforceable if, “given the parties' general\ncommercial background and the commercial needs of the particular trade or case, the clause\ninvolved is so one-sided that it is unconscionable under the circumstances existing when the parties\nmade the contract.” FirstMerit Bank, 52 S.W.3d at 757; see also In re Halliburton Co., 80 S.W.3d\n566, 571 (Tex.2002) (“[S]ubstantive unconscionability ... refers to the fairness of the arbitration\nprovision itself.”). Unconscionability is to be determined in light of a variety of factors, which aim\nto prevent oppression and unfair surprise; in general, a contract will be found unconscionable if it\nis grossly one-sided. See DAN B. DOBBS, 2 LAW OF REMEDIES 703, 706 (2d ed.1993); see\nalso RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTSS § 208, cmt. a (1979) (“The determination\nthat a contract or term is or is not unconscionable is made in the light of its setting, purpose,\nand effect. Relevant factors include weaknesses in the contracting process like those involved in\nmore specific rules as to contractual capacity, fraud, and other invalidating causes; the policy also\noverlaps with rules which render particular *349 bargains or terms unenforceable on grounds\nof public policy.”). Although not subject to precise doctrinal definition, see Sw. Bell Tel. Co. v.\nDeLanney, 809 S.W.2d 493, 498 (Tex.1991) (GONZALEZ, J., concurring), unconscionability—\nas delineated by the above principles—has been recognized and applied by this Court for well\nover a century. See, e.g., Flanagan v. Pearson, 61 Tex. 302, 307 (1884); Fowler v. Stoneum, 11\nTex. 478, 493 (1854); Hemming v. Zimmerschitte, 4 Tex. 159, 166 (1849); Luckett v. Townsend,\n3 Tex. 119, 131 (1848).\n\n [20] [21] Whether a contract is contrary to public policy or unconscionable at the time it is\nformed is a question of law. Hoover Slovacek LLP v. Walton, 206 S.W.3d 557, 562 (Tex.2006).\nBecause a trial court has no discretion to determine what the law is or apply the law incorrectly,\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 1237\n\nits clear failure to properly analyze or apply the law of unconscionability constitutes an abuse of\ndiscretion. See Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 840 (Tex.1992).\n\n\n\n                                    B. Arbitration and Statutory Rights\n\n [22] [23] [24] An arbitration agreement covering statutory claims is valid so long as the\narbitration agreement does not waive the substantive rights and remedies the statute affords\nand the arbitration procedures are fair, such that the employee may “effectively vindicate his\nstatutory rights.” In re Halliburton, 80 S.W.3d at 572. Federal courts, analyzing the enforceability\nof arbitration provisions relating to federal statutory claims, have noted that such contracts are\nnot enforceable when a party is forced to “forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute,”\nas opposed to merely “submit[ting] to resolution in an arbitral, rather than a judicial, forum.”\nMitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler–Plymouth, Inc., 473 U.S. 614, 628, 105 S.Ct. 3346,\n87 L.Ed.2d 444 (1985). In the context of federal claims, either an expression of federal intent to\nexclude certain categories of claims from arbitration, see Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp.,\n500 U.S. 20, 26, 111 S.Ct. 1647, 114 L.Ed.2d 26 (1991), or the excessive waiver of statutory rights,\nsee Mitsubishi, 473 U.S. at 628, 105 S.Ct. 3346, may render a particular dispute un-arbitrable.\nState courts, bound by the FAA under the supremacy clause, have more limited power, as the FAA\npreempts state laws that specifically disfavor arbitration. Perry, 482 U.S. at 492 n. 9, 107 S.Ct.\n2520; see Jack B. Anglin Co. v. Tipps, 842 S.W.2d 266, 271 (Tex.1992) (holding that the FAA\npreempts state statutes to the extent they are inconsistent with the FAA's purpose to require courts\nto compel arbitration when the parties have so provided in their contracts).\n\n [25] However, where a particular waiver of substantive remedies or other provision of a contract is\nunconscionable—independent of the agreement to arbitrate—it will be unenforceable even though\nincluded in an agreement to arbitrate. See Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 33, 111 S.Ct. 1647 (“[A]rbitration\nagreements are enforceable, ‘save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation\nof any contract.’ ”) (quoting 9 U.S.C. § 2). To determine the permissibility of restrictions on a\nparticular worker's access to statutory rights, we analyze the provisions of the actual statute at\nissue; thus, to analyze the enforceability of the various restrictions and waivers in the employment\ncontract at issue in this case, we turn to the retaliatory-discharge provisions of the Texas Workers'\nCompensation Act, TEX. LAB.CODE §§ 451.001–.003.\n\n\n\n                            C. Purpose and Structure of the Texas Workers'\n                            Compensation Act's Anti–Retaliation Provisions\n\n[26] [27] [28] The Texas Workers' Compensation Act was enacted to protect Texas *350\nworkers and employees. Fid. & Cas. Co. of N.Y. v. McLaughlin, 134 Tex. 613, 135 S.W.2d 955,\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 8\n\fIn re Poly-America, L.P., 262 S.W.3d 337 (2008)\n156 Lab.Cas. P 60,669, 28 IER Cases 140, 51 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1237\n\n956 (1940). The Texas Legislature enacted the original Workers' Compensation Act in 1913 in\nresponse to the needs of workers who, despite a growing incidence of industrial accidents, were\nincreasingly being denied recovery. Kroger Co. v. Keng, 23 S.W.3d 347, 350 (Tex.2000); Tex.\nWorkers' Compensation Comm'n v. Garcia, 893 S.W.2d 504, 510 (Tex.1995). In order to ensure\ncompensation for injured employees while protecting employers from the costs of litigation, the\nLegislature provided a mechanism by which workers could recover from subscribing employers\nwithout regard to the workers' own negligence, see Kroger, 23 S.W.3d at 351, while limiting the\nemployers' exposure to uncertain, possibly high damage awards permitted under the common law,\nsee Reed Tool Co. v. Copelin, 689 S.W.2d 404, 407 (Tex.1985). In light of the purposes of the\nWorkers' Compensation Act as a whole, “[i]t is the settled policy of this State to construe liberally\nthe provisions of the ... [l]aw, in order to effectuate the purposes for which it was enacted.” Huffman\nv. S. Underwriters, 133 Tex. 354, 128 S.W.2d 4, 6 (1939) (citations omitted). As we have recently\nnoted, “[b]ecause we should liberally construe the Workers' Compensation Act in favor of the\ninjured worker, a strained or narrow construction of [the Act] would be improper. Moreover, it\nwould be injudicious to construe the statute in a manner that supplies by implication restrictions\non an employee's rights that are not found in ... [the] plain language.” Kroger, 23 S.W.3d at 349.\n\n [29] [30] The Texas Workers' Compensation Act provides that a subscriber to the workers'\ncompensation system may not “discharge or in any other manner discriminate against an employee\nbecause the employee has ... filed a workers' compensation claim in good faith.” TEX. LAB.CODE\n§ 451.001–.001(1). The Legislature's purpose in enacting section 451.001 was to protect persons\nentitled to benefits under the Act and to prevent them from being discharged for seeking to collect\nthose benefits. See Tex. Steel Co. v. Douglas, 533 S.W.2d 111, 115 (Tex.Civ.App.-Fort Worth\n1976, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Since recovery of benefits under the Workers' Compensation Act is the\nexclusive remedy available to injured employees of subscribing employers, see TEX. LAB.CODE\n§ 408.001(a), the availability of remedies for retaliatory discharge protects employees' exercise of\ntheir statutory rights to compensation under the Act. See Padilla v. Carrier Air Conditioning, 67\nF.Supp.2d 650, 664 (E.D.Tex.1999); Mid–South Bottling Co. v. Cigainero, 799 S.W.2d 385, 389\n(Tex.App.-Texarkana 1990, writ denied). In accordance with these principles, the anti-retaliation\nprovisions of the Act must protect employees even before they have actually filed a claim, because\notherwise “the law would be completely useless and would not accomplish the purpose for which\nit was enacted.... [A]ll the employer would have to do in order to avoid the consequences of the\nstatute would be to fire the injured workman before he filed the claim.” Tex. Steel Co., 533 S.W.2d\nat 115.\n\n [31] “The decisions of this State do not look with favor upon contracts waiving rights arising\nunder the Workmen's Compensation Law.” Huffman, 128 S.W.2d at 6. Such waivers affect not\nonly the individual employee subject to the waiver, but also the public, which bears the cost of\nthe workers' compensation program. See Holt v. Cont'l Group, Inc., 708 F.2d 87, 91 (2d Cir.1983)\n(“A retaliatory discharge carries with it the distinct risk that other employees may be deterred\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 1237\n\nfrom protecting their rights under the Act.”). Therefore, we *351 have invalidated contracts that\npurport to relieve employers of their obligations under the Workers' Compensation Act. See James\nv. Vernon Calhoun Packing Co., 498 S.W.2d 160, 162 (Tex.1973) (noting that “[w]e are much\nimpressed with the idea that there is a large element of public interest in the administration of\n[the Workers' Compensation Act]”); Hazelwood v. Mandrell Indus. Co., 596 S.W.2d 204, 206\n(Tex.Civ.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1990, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (“If ... this balance [established by the\nAct] is tipped so that the employee's benefits under the statute are substantially reduced, the\nclear intent of the legislature is thwarted.”). We have likewise held unenforceable contracts that\nexplicitly relieve employers of tort liability, relying either on common law prohibitions against\nsuch contracts, see Barnhart v. Kansas City M. & O. Ry. Co. of Tex., 107 Tex. 638, 184 S.W. 176,\n179 (1916), or upon the Workers' Compensation Act, see Petroleum Cas. Co. v. Smith, 274 S.W.2d\n150, 151 (Tex.Civ.App.-San Antonio 1954, writ ref'd) (noting that “[t]he right to workmen's\ncompensation is statutory, and cannot be abridged by private agreements or special applications\nfor employment”); Clevenger v. Burgess, 31 S.W.2d 675, 678 (Tex.Civ.App.-Beaumont 1930,\nwrit ref'd); Tex. Employers Ins. Ass'n v. Peppers, 133 S.W.2d 165, 167 (Tex.Civ.App.-Galveston\n1939, writ dism'd) (“[T]he courts will not enforce contracts which are either expressly or impliedly\nprohibited by the [Workers' Compensation] Act.”).\n\nThis case concerns the validity of a subscribing employer's use of an agreement that, in the\ncourse of requiring arbitration between the parties in work-related disputes, imposes a series\nof procedural and substantive limits on the employee's rights. We must analyze the challenged\nlimitations in light of the policies underlying the Workers' Compensation Act, and the purposes of\nits anti-retaliation provisions, to determine whether they improperly shift the cost of injury from\na subscribing employer onto its employees in contravention of the Act's provisions. Cf. Lawrence\nv. CDB Servs., Inc., 44 S.W.3d 544, 550 (Tex.2001) (noting that the agreements did not “shift\nthe risk of on-the-job injuries to the employees”); see also Gentry v. Superior Court, 42 Cal.4th\n443, 456, 64 Cal.Rptr.3d 773, 782, 165 P.3d 556 (2007), cert. denied 552 U.S. 1296, 128 S.Ct.\n1743, 170 L.Ed.2d 541 (2008) (noting that under California law, when an employee is bound\nby a predispute arbitration agreement to adjudicate nonwaivable statutory employment rights,\nthe arbitration agreement may not limit damages, discovery must be sufficient to arbitrate the\nclaim, there must be a written arbitration decision, and the employer must pay all costs “unique\nto arbitration”).\n\n\n\n                                V. The Challenged Arbitration Provisions\n\n\n                                          A. Limitation of Remedies\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.               10\n\fIn re Poly-America, L.P., 262 S.W.3d 337 (2008)\n156 Lab.Cas. P 60,669, 28 IER Cases 140, 51 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1237\n\n [32] [33] The Workers' Compensation Act specifies that “[a] person who violates section\n451.001 is liable for reasonable damages incurred by the employee as a result of the violation,”\nand that “[a]n employee discharged in violation of section 451.001 is entitled to reinstatement\nin the former position of employment.” TEX. LAB.CODE § 451.002(a)-(b). We have previously\nexplained that “reasonable damages” are not limited to actual damages, see Azar Nut Co. v.\nCaille, 734 S.W.2d 667, 669 (Tex.1987), but may include future damages, as well as exemplary or\npunitive damages when it is shown that the employer acted with actual malice in retaliating against\nthe employee for filing a workers' compensation claim. See Cont'l Coffee Prods. v. Cazarez,\n937 S.W.2d 444, 454 (Tex.1996); *352 Carnation Co. v. Borner, 610 S.W.2d 450, 454–55\n(Tex.1980). The arbitration agreement in this case eliminates two types of remedies available\nunder the anti-retaliation provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act, prohibiting the arbitrator\nfrom ordering reinstatement or awarding punitive damages. See TEX. LAB.CODE § 451.002\n(providing for reinstatement and an award of reasonable damages). Luna contends these limitations\nrender the agreement unconscionable and unenforceable because they prevent him from effectively\nvindicating his statutory rights in arbitration, thus undercutting the basic assumptions of the FAA.\nSee Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 28, 111 S.Ct. 1647 (noting that claims under other federal statutes are\nappropriate for arbitration so long as the litigant can effectively vindicate any statutory rights).\nThe court of appeals agreed with Luna. 175 S.W.3d at 323–24. Although it noted other courts'\ndecisions upholding punitive-damages waivers, id. at 323, and further noted that preclusion of\nstatutory remedies may not always portend unconscionability, id., the court held that the preclusion\nof remedies here interfered with Luna's ability to bring his retaliatory-discharge claim under the\nWorkers' Compensation Act and thus weighed toward the contract's unconscionability, id.\n\nPoly–America argues that the court of appeals' decision conflicts with Pony Express Courier\nCorp. v. Morris, 921 S.W.2d 817, 822 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 1996, no writ), and decisions of\nother courts indicating that limitations of remedies are permissible, e.g., Inv. Partners v. Glamour\nShots Licensing, Inc., 298 F.3d 314, 318 n. 1 (5th Cir.2002). Because we view the anti-retaliation\nprovisions of the Workers' Compensation Act as a non-waivable legislative system for deterrence\nnecessary to the nondiscriminatory and effective operation of the Texas Workers' Compensation\nsystem as a whole, we agree with Luna that the provisions eliminating key remedies under the\nstatute are unenforceable.\n\n [34] An arbitration agreement covering statutory claims is valid so long as “the arbitration\nagreement does not waive substantive rights and remedies of the statute and the arbitration\nprocedures are fair so that the employee may effectively vindicate his statutory rights.” In re\nHalliburton, 80 S.W.3d at 572. “ ‘[B]y agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim, a party does\nnot forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute; it only submits to their resolution in\nan arbitral, rather than a judicial, forum.’ ” Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 26, 111 S.Ct. 1647 (quoting\nMitsubishi, 473 U.S. at 628, 105 S.Ct. 3346). In this case, Luna contends Poly–America acted\nwith actual malice in unlawfully discharging him, a claim for which the Workers' Compensation\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 1237\n\nAct allows punitive damages. See TEX. LAB.CODE § 451.002; Azar Nut Co., 734 S.W.2d at 668.\nPermitting an employer to contractually absolve itself of this statutory remedy would undermine\nthe deterrent purpose of the Workers' Compensation Act's anti-retaliation provisions. In creating\nthe Texas Workers' Compensation Act, the Legislature carefully balanced competing interests—\nof employees subject to the risk of injury, employers, and insurance carriers—in an attempt to\ndesign a viable compensation system, all within constitutional limitations. See Garcia, 893 S.W.2d\nat 521. Were we to endorse Poly–America's position and permit enforcement of these remedy\nlimitations, a subscribing employer could avoid the Act's penalties by conditioning employment\nupon waiver of the very provisions designed to protect employees who have been the subject of\nwrongful retaliation.\n\nOur decision in Lawrence, 44 S.W.3d 544, is fully consistent with this view. There, employees\nof a non-subscribing employer *353 elected, after they were hired, to participate in an employer\nbenefit plan that would provide injured employees with specified benefits in lieu of common law\nremedies. Id. at 545–46. We refused to void the agreement on public-policy grounds, discerning\n“no clear legislative intent to prohibit agreements such as those presented.” Id. at 545. We\nemphasized that participation in the workers' compensation program is voluntary for employers in\nTexas, and that courts are ill equipped to weigh whether a non-subscribing employer's particular\nbenefits plan would undermine the purposes of the Workers' Compensation Act. See id. at 551–\n53. 2 Our decision was specifically tailored to non-subscribing employers who elected not to\nparticipate in the workers' compensation program. Importantly, we distinguished cases involving\ncontracts imposed as a condition of employment, emphasizing that “[t]he distinction between an\nemployment contract that requires a prospective employee, as a condition of the receipt or retention\nof employment, to agree to limit the employer's liability ... and a voluntary occupational insurance\nprogram, in which the employee has the option to enroll ... is decisive.” Lawrence, 44 S.W.3d at\n550 (quoting Brito v. Intex Aviation Servs., Inc., 879 F.Supp. 650, 654 (N.D.Tex.1995)) (citing\nClevenger, 31 S.W.2d at 678; Barnhart, 184 S.W. at 176)).\n\nThis case presents just such a liability-limiting provision, imposed as a condition of employment,\nwhich we suggested in Lawrence would violate public policy. See id. Such waivers would allow\nsubscribing employers to enjoy the Act's limited-liability benefits while exposing workers to\nexactly the sort of costs—of injuries paid for by the employee for fear of retribution for making\na claim—that the Act is specifically designed to shift onto the employer. The balance established\nby the Act is thus “tipped so that the employee's benefits under the statute are substantially\nreduced, [and] the clear intent of the legislature is thwarted.” Hazelwood, 596 S.W.2d at 206.\nAs we have previously refused to enforce private agreements that allow subscribing employers\nto reap the system's benefits while burdening employees with the cost of injury, so too we\nfind the provisions of the present contract—which substantively limit Poly–America's liability\nfor wrongful retaliation and thereby undermine the deterrent regime the Legislature specifically\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Poly–America argues that\nthis was clear error: first, because the court of appeals improperly inferred that Luna could not\nafford likely arbitration costs based solely on subjective evidence and, second, because it failed\nto compare such costs to the *354 expected costs of litigation. 3 Luna responds that it was Poly–\nAmerica that failed to present evidence of the comparative cost of litigation and that the evidence\npresented was sufficient to allow an objective determination that the likely costs of arbitration\nwere beyond Luna's financial means. We begin with the evidentiary challenge.\n\n\n\n                                           1. Evidentiary Challenge\n\n [35] [36] Poly–America claims that the court of appeals, by crediting Luna's factual allegations\nconcerning his financial inability to share arbitration costs, improperly applied a new evidentiary\nstandard that will require all parties seeking to compel arbitration to engage in expensive discovery\nwhenever a resisting party submits cursory and subjective evidence that arbitration costs are\n“unaffordable.” This evidentiary burden, Poly–America argues, is contrary to Texas law and policy\nthat supports summary disposition of motions to compel arbitration. In response, Luna contends\nthe facts upon which the court of appeals relied could have been controverted by affidavit or cross-\nexamination, which Poly–America failed to do; consequently, the court of appeals based its ruling\non the undisputed facts established by Luna's affidavits. Both parties cite Anglin, 842 S.W.2d at\n269, to support their respective positions. There, we defined the proper circumstances under which\na trial court should hold a full evidentiary hearing on a motion to compel arbitration:\n\n            Because the main benefits of arbitration lie in expedited and less expensive\n            disposition of a dispute, and the legislature has mandated that a motion to\n            compel arbitration be decided summarily, we think it unlikely that the legislature\n            intended the issue to be resolved following a full evidentiary hearing in all\n            cases. We also envision that the hearing at which a motion to compel arbitration\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 1237\n\n            is decided would ordinarily involve application of the terms of the arbitration\n            agreement to undisputed facts, amenable to proof by affidavit. With these\n            considerations in mind, we hold that the trial court may summarily decide\n            whether to compel arbitration on the basis of affidavits, pleadings, discovery,\n            and stipulations. However, if the material facts necessary to determine the issue\n            are controverted, by an opposing affidavit or otherwise admissible evidence,\n            the trial court must conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine the disputed\n            material facts.\n\nId. Because the only facts Luna presented on the motion to compel were uncontroverted under\nthis standard—Luna's affidavits accompanying his original petition were neither contradicted\nnor challenged in Poly–America's response—we believe the court of appeals acted properly in\ncrediting those facts on appeal.\n\nLuna attached to his original petition his own affidavit and that of an expert witness providing\ndetailed estimates of the likely cost of arbitration in Luna's case, and Luna's expected share\nunder the agreement's capped fee-splitting provision based on his monthly salary (approximately\n$3,300.00) as a Poly–America supervisor. Luna described his anticipated share of the arbitration\ncosts as “way more money than I can afford,” and averred that, if he *355 had to pay such an\namount to have his claim determined, he would be unable to pursue his claim against the company\nunless he could find an attorney willing to pay those fees. Luna recounted that he had attempted\nto retain two attorneys, but they had refused to represent him on a contingent-fee basis because\nof the arbitration agreement.\n\nPoly–America did not dispute these facts but asserted legal arguments in its pleadings that the cost\nprovisions, as written or as applied, were not unconscionable under Texas law. At the hearing on\nits motion to compel, Poly–America again asserted only legal arguments in response to Luna's\nchallenge to the cost-splitting provision. There is no indication in the record that the trial court\ndiscredited or otherwise viewed the facts recited in Luna's affidavits as insufficient; rather, on\nthe basis of Poly–America's legal arguments, the trial court granted the motion to compel. This\ndisposition was consistent with our statements in Anglin in which we indicated that motions to\ncompel should be decided summarily unless disputed issues of fact require a full evidentiary\nhearing. See id.\n\nHowever, the court of appeals clearly differed from the trial court in its view of the law. It held\nthat the trial court's granting of the motion to compel—in light of Luna's averred inability to afford\nhis likely arbitration costs and the agreement's other limitations—was an abuse of discretion.\n175 S.W.3d at 318–20. In doing so, the court of appeals properly credited the undisputed facts\ncontained in Luna's affidavits as to the total expected cost of arbitration and Luna's anticipated\nshare based upon his pre-termination monthly income. Id. at 319–20. Poly–America contends the\ncourt of appeals improperly ruled based on Luna's subjective, and thus practically incontrovertible,\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 1237\n\nbelief that he could not afford arbitration, which does not satisfy this Court's requirements of\n“specific” evidence to support claims of unconscionably expensive arbitration. See In re U.S.\nHome Corp., 236 S.W.3d 761, 764 (Tex.2007). However, the court of appeals relied not solely\nupon Luna's belief but upon his and his expert's specific monetary estimates, which provided\nobjective support for Luna's uncontroverted claim that arbitration costs would preclude his pursuit\nof the lawsuit. See 175 S.W.3d at 319. The court of appeals did not, therefore, rely solely on\nsubjective and incontrovertible allegations.\n\n\n\n                            2. Unconscionability of Fee–Splitting Provisions\n\nPoly–America alternatively challenges the court of appeals' conclusion that the agreement's cost-\nallocation provisions favor a finding of unconscionability because the court did not consider the\nrelative costs that Luna would likely incur if the case were litigated in court—costs that, based on\nPoly–America's estimates, would greatly exceed the capped cost of arbitration—and Luna failed\nto provide any evidence of the actual cost of arbitration that he would bear. Although we have\nno doubt that some fee-splitting provisions may operate to discourage employees like Luna from\nseeking vindication of their rights under the Workers' Compensation Act, we must agree with\nPoly–America that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering arbitration in this case.\n\nCourts across the country have universally condemned the use of fee-splitting agreements in\nemployment contracts that have the effect of deterring potential litigants from vindicating their\nstatutory rights in an arbitral forum. See Green Tree, 531 U.S. at 90–91, 121 S.Ct. 513. Some\ncourts have gone so far as to find fee-sharing agreements unenforceable per se. See, e.g., Cole\nv. Burns Int'l Sec. *356 Servs., 105 F.3d 1465, 1483–85 (D.C.Cir.1995), cited in Halliburton,\n80 S.W.3d at 572; Shankle v. B–G Maint. Mgmt. of Colo., Inc., 163 F.3d 1230, 1233–35 (10th\nCir.1999); Paladino v. Avnet Computer Techs., Inc., 134 F.3d 1054, 1062 (11th Cir.1998). These\ncourts reason that “an employee can never be required, as a condition of employment, to pay\nan arbitrator's compensation in order to secure the resolution of statutory claims.... [T]his would\nsurely deter the bringing of arbitration and constitute a de facto forfeiture of statutory rights.”\nCole, 105 F.3d at 1468; accord Shankle, 163 F.3d at 1235 (“Such a result clearly undermines the\nremedial and deterrent functions of ... anti-discrimination laws.”).\n\n [37] [38] We agree that fee-splitting provisions that operate to prohibit an employee from fully\nand effectively vindicating statutory rights are not enforceable. See Halliburton, 80 S.W.3d at 572.\nHowever, this Court joins the majority of other courts which—though recognizing the same policy\nconcerns articulated by courts holding fee-splitting arrangements per se unconscionable—require\nsome evidence that a complaining party will likely incur arbitration costs in such an amount as to\ndeter enforcement of statutory rights in the arbitral forum. See U.S. Home Corp., 236 S.W.3d at\n764; FirstMerit Bank, 52 S.W.3d at 756–57. As federal courts have likewise recognized:\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

[T]he burden of demonstrating that incurring such costs is likely under\n            a given set of circumstances rests, at least initially, with the party opposing\n            arbitration.\n\nMorrison v. Circuit City Stores, Inc., 317 F.3d 646, 659–60 (6th Cir.2003); accord Bradford v.\nRockwell Semiconductor Sys., Inc., 238 F.3d 549, 556 (4th Cir.2001); Rosenberg v. Merrill Lynch,\nPierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 170 F.3d 1, 16 (1st Cir.1999).\n\n [39] Luna contends the magnitude of the fee he could incur under the arbitration agreement, which\nhe estimates to be as high as $3,300, will prevent him from pursuing his claim. Poly–America\ncounters that litigation costs would be much higher, and therefore the arbitration agreement's\ncapped cost-splitting provision benefits the employee and cannot be unconscionable. It is true\nthat in evaluating the enforceability of fee-splitting provisions, some courts take into account the\nrelative costs of arbitration versus litigation. See, e.g., Bradford, 238 F.3d at 556 n. 5 (focusing\nupon “a claimant's expected or actual arbitration costs and his ability to pay those costs, measured\nagainst a baseline of the claimant's expected costs for litigation and his ability to pay those costs”).\nHowever, at this stage of the proceedings, much of this evidence is necessarily speculative, and\nthus counsels against a court's ex ante interference with arbitration.\n\nWe do not doubt that arbitration costs might be so high in a given case as to preclude access to the\nforum. But “the ‘risk’ that [a claimant] will be saddled with prohibitive costs is too speculative to\njustify the invalidation of an arbitration agreement.” Green Tree, 531 U.S. at 91, 121 S.Ct. 513.\nLuna has not demonstrated that the ability to pursue his claim in the arbitral forum hinges upon\nhis payment of the estimated costs; to the contrary, depending upon the circumstances, Luna may\nnot have to bear any cost at all, and *357 Poly–America has presented some evidence that the\ncapped cost-splitting arrangement may even benefit Luna. The fee-splitting provision in Luna's\narbitration agreement caps his share of costs at “the gross compensation earned by Employee in\nEmployee's highest earning month in the twelve months prior to the time the arbitrator issues\nhis award.” (Emphasis added). Luna, however, presented evidence of his “highest monthly salary\nin the year preceding [his] termination from the company,” a period necessarily earlier than that\nrelevant under the arbitration agreement. The record contains no fact-based estimation of Luna's\nwages in the relevant time period and, thus, no evidence of his likely share of arbitration costs.\n\nJust as we allow litigants who demonstrate an inability to pay costs to proceed with their claims in\ncourt, however, we see nothing that would prevent arbitrators from fairly adjusting employee cost\nprovisions when necessary to allow full vindication of statutory rights in the arbitral forum.

The contract presented in this case specifically provides that the arbitrator\nmay modify unconscionable terms; if the cost provisions precluded Luna's enforcement of his non-\nwaivable statutory rights, they would surely be unconscionable for the reasons we have explained\nand the arbitrator would be free to modify them. The arbitrator is better situated to assess whether\nthe cost provision in this case will hinder effective vindication of Luna's statutory rights and, if so,\nto modify the contract's terms accordingly. See Halliburton, 80 S.W.3d at 572. We conclude the\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to declare the contract's cost-splitting provision\nunconscionable and nullify the arbitration agreement.\n\n\n\n                                           C. Discovery Limitations\n\n [40] The 2002 agreement provides that each party may serve on the other a single set of twenty-\nfive interrogatories (including sub-parts) and one set of twenty-five requests for production or\ninspection of documents or tangible things. Additionally, the agreement includes limitations\nalleged by Luna to be unconscionable: (1) a limitation of each party to a single, six-hour deposition;\n(2) a prohibition on requests for admission; (3) a ban on inquiry into Poly–America's finances; and\n(4) a confidentiality provision requiring confidentiality of the parties and their attorneys regarding\nall aspects of the arbitration. Luna contends these limitations make it virtually impossible for him\nto prove his claim of retaliatory discharge and render the arbitration agreement unconscionable.\n\nAlthough an issue of first impression in this Court, several courts around the country have analyzed\nthe enforceability of similar arbitration provisions limiting parties' access to various forms of\ndiscovery. Applying a rule functionally equivalent to that used to analyze fee-splitting provisions,\nthese courts refuse to enforce such limitations when adequate evidence is presented that a plaintiff's\nability to present his or her claims in an arbitral forum is thereby hindered. See, e.g., Hulett\nv. Capitol Auto Group, Inc., No. 07–6151–AA, 2007 WL 3232283, at *4–*5 (D.Or. Oct.29,\n2007) (holding discovery restrictions that prohibited requests for admission or interrogatories and\nlimited parties to three depositions unconscionable because they “serve to unreasonably withhold\ninformation from plaintiff that would otherwise be available through discovery, thus hindering\nher ability to present her claims in an arbitration forum”); accord Ostroff v. Alterra Healthcare\nCorp., 433 F.Supp.2d 538, 547 (E.D.Pa.2006). Courts upholding arbitration provisions containing\ndiscovery limitations have done so in recognition of the same principle, but determined that a\nparticular *358 party failed to provide adequate evidence that the provisions “prove insufficient\nto allow ... claimants ... a fair opportunity to present their claims.” Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 31, 111\nS.Ct. 1647; see, e.g., In re Cotton Yarn Antitrust Litig., 505 F.3d 274, 286–87 (4th Cir.2007);\nAmisil Holdings, Ltd. v.

J. 1237\n\n [41] [42] We agree with these courts that, where the underlying substantive right is not waivable,\nex ante limitations on discovery that unreasonably impede effective prosecution of such rights are\nlikewise unenforceable. However, because the relevant inquiry depends upon the facts presented in\na given case and the particular discovery limitations' effect upon the relevant statutory regime, we\nare doubtful that courts—assessing claims and discovery limitations before arbitration begins—are\nin the best position to accurately determine which limits on discovery will have such impermissible\neffect.\n\nIn this case, Luna's expert witness testified that in most employment-discharge cases the employer\nonly needs to take the plaintiff's deposition, while the plaintiff generally needs testimony from a\nnumber of witnesses to disprove the employer's likely defense that termination was based on poor\nperformance. Additionally, the expert stated, the employee will likely wish to depose additional\nwitnesses to show a pattern or practice of discrimination, whereas the employer typically has a\nready pool of available employees and managers to assist in preparing for the arbitration. For these\nreasons, the expert concluded, the arbitration agreement's discovery limitations “significantly\nreduce the plaintiff's ability to prevail in arbitration, regardless of how strong a plaintiff's case is\non the merits.”\n\nWe agree that if the discovery limitations the arbitration agreement imposes operate to prevent\neffective presentation of Luna's claim they would be unenforceable. But at this point in the\nproceedings, without knowing what the particular claims and defenses—and the evidence needed\nto prove them—will be, discerning the discovery limitations' potential preclusive effect is largely\nspeculative. The assessment of particular discovery needs in a given case and, in turn, the\nenforceability of limitations thereon, is a determination we believe best suited to the arbitrator\nas the case unfolds. As with cost-sharing, discovery limitations that prevent vindication of non-\nwaivable rights or “prove insufficient to allow [Luna] a fair opportunity to present [his] claims,”\nGilmer, 500 U.S. at 31, 111 S.Ct. 1647, would be unconscionable and thus not binding on the\narbitrator, as the agreement in this case specifically acknowledges. At this point in the proceedings,\nthough, we cannot conclude that the evidence presented to the trial court compelled a finding\nthat the discovery limitations were per se unconscionable. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion.\n\n\n\n                              D. Prohibition on Inquiry into “Good Cause”\n\n [43] Luna claims the arbitration provision that prohibits the arbitrator's ability “to apply a\n‘just cause’ or ‘good cause’ standard to claims relating to Employee's claims concerning his\nemployment or separation therefrom” is substantively unconscionable because it prohibits, in\na retaliatory-discharge case, inquiry into whether the employer had a valid, nondiscriminatory\nreason for firing the employee. Poly–America contends the contract cannot be read as Luna\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   18\n\fIn re Poly-America, L.P., 262 S.W.3d 337 (2008)\n156 Lab.Cas. P 60,669, 28 IER Cases 140, 51 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1237\n\nclaims, and in fact does not *359 prevent such an inquiry. We agree with Poly–America, and\nwith the court of appeals, that this prohibition does not operate as Luna asserts; rather, the\nprohibition simply emphasizes that the contract relates to at-will employment. See Montgomery\nCounty Hosp. Dist. v. Brown, 965 S.W.2d 501, 502 (Tex.1998). Thus, the prohibition prevents the\narbitrator from substituting a “good cause” requirement for the “at will” standard. The provision\ndoes not, however, prohibit inquiry into whether Poly–America improperly terminated Luna in\nretaliation for his filing of a workers' compensation claim. Because we read the provision merely\nto articulate an accepted rule of employment contracts, and not to restrict a necessary inquiry\ninto the motivations behind Poly–America's termination of Luna in this case, we agree with the\ncourt of appeals that the provision is not unconscionable. See In re Palm Harbor Homes, Inc.,\n195 S.W.3d 672, 678 (Tex.2006) (rejecting a claim that an arbitration provision was substantively\nunconscionable where the challenged provision “effectively incorporate[d] established provisions\nof contract law”).\n\n\n\n                                      E. One–Year Limitations Period\n\nThe arbitration agreement includes a clause that requires written notice of a claim to be filed\nwithin a maximum of one year from the events giving rise to an arbitrable claim. Luna contends\nthis provision unconscionably shortens the two-year statute of limitations applicable to claims\nof retaliatory discharge. See Johnson & Johnson Med., Inc. v. Sanchez, 924 S.W.2d 925, 927\n(Tex.1996). However, as Luna filed this case well within the one-year period and thus suffered no\nprejudice from this provision, it is immaterial to Luna's claims of substantive unconscionability.\n\n\n\n                                            F. Lifetime Application\n\nFinally, Luna argues that the arbitration agreement unconscionably applies even to claims that\nmay arise after Luna's employment with Poly–America has ended and which may have nothing\nto do with Luna's employment. While we can imagine circumstances that might present a closer\nquestion, Luna's claims here concern his employment and termination, the central focus of the\nagreement. We thus agree with the court of appeals that this provision does not render the\narbitration agreement per se unconscionable. See 175 S.W.3d at 326.\n\n\n\n                                                  VI. Severability\n\n [44] The arbitration agreement in this case contains a severability clause, which provides as\nfollows:\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 1237\n\n\n            Should any term of this Agreement be declared illegal, unenforceable, or\n            unconscionable, the remaining terms of the Agreement shall remain in full\n            force and effect. To the extent possible, both Employee and Company desire\n            that the Arbitrator modify the term(s) declared to be illegal, unenforceable, or\n            unconscionable in such a way as to retain the intended meaning of the term(s)\n            as closely as possible.\n\nPoly–America argues that, even if elements of its arbitration agreement with Luna are\nunconscionable, arbitration is nevertheless required because the unconscionable provisions are\nseverable from the general agreement to arbitrate. 4 Luna *360 contends the unconscionable\nprovisions are integral to the entire contract and are therefore not severable. The court of appeals\nagreed with Luna, stating that the fee-splitting and remedies-limitation provisions “together\ndeprive Luna of his opportunity to vindicate his claim in the arbitral forum” and concluding that\n“those provisions are integral to the purpose of the agreement and cannot be severed.” 175 S.W.3d\nat 328. The court of appeals came to this conclusion, it appears, by identifying the fee-splitting\nand remedies-limitation provisions as weighing in favor of unconscionability “as a whole,” but the\ncourt did not identify any particular provision that, by itself, would defeat the agreement's purpose.\nSee id. at 322, 324. We have determined, however, that the remedies-limitation provisions are\nindividually unconscionable and void, and see no reason why they cannot be easily excised from\nthe contract without defeating its underlying purpose.\n\n [45] [46] [47] An illegal or unconscionable provision of a contract may generally be severed\nso long as it does not constitute the essential purpose of the agreement. See Williams v.\nWilliams, 569 S.W.2d 867, 871 (Tex.1978); see also Hoover Slovacek, 206 S.W.3d at 565 (citing\nRESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 208 (1981)). Whether or not the invalidity\nof a particular provision affects the rest of the contract depends upon whether the remaining\nprovisions are independent or mutually dependent promises, which courts determine by looking\nto the language of the contract itself. See John R. Ray & Sons, Inc. v. Stroman, 923 S.W.2d 80,\n86 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1996, writ denied) (citing Hanks v. GAB Bus. Servs., Inc., 644\nS.W.2d 707, 708 (Tex.1982)). The relevant inquiry is whether or not parties would have entered\ninto the agreement absent the unenforceable provisions. See Patrizi v. McAninch, 153 Tex. 389,\n269 S.W.2d 343, 348 (1954); see also City of Beaumont v. Int'l Ass'n of Firefighters, Local Union\nNo. 399, 241 S.W.3d 208, 215 (Tex.App.-Beaumont 2007, no pet.)

J. 1237\n\nThe 2002 version of the arbitration agreement in this case is over five pages long and contains\nnumerous provisions not challenged by Luna as imposing any unconscionable burdens: procedures\nfor mediation, selection of a neutral arbitrator, filing of motions, and other general provisions\ngoverning arbitration procedures. We agree with Poly–America that the intent of the parties, as\nexpressed by the severability clause, is that unconscionable provisions be excised where possible.\nFurthermore, it is clear by the contract's terms that the main purpose of the agreement is for the\nparties to submit their disputes to an arbitral forum rather than proceed in court. See id. Excising\nthe unconscionable provisions we have identified will not defeat or undermine this purpose, which\nwe have upheld in the context of agreements to arbitrate employment disputes.

Conclusion\n\nWe hold invalid, as substantively unconscionable and void, provisions of the parties' *361\ncontract that prohibit the award of punitive damages or reinstatement and thus inhibit effective\nvindication of Luna's retaliatory-discharge claim in an arbitral forum. We further hold that the trial\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in allowing the arbitrator to determine whether the fee-splitting\nagreement and discovery limitations—as applied in the course of arbitration—are unconscionable.\nBecause we find the invalid remedies-limitation provisions severable from the agreement to\narbitrate, which we conclude is otherwise enforceable, the trial court did not abuse its discretion\nin compelling arbitration. Accordingly, we conditionally grant the writ of mandamus.\n\n\n\nJustice BRISTER filed a dissenting opinion.\n\nJustice WILLETT did not participate in the decision.\n\nJustice BRISTER, dissenting.\nThe hard thing about granting mandamus relief is knowing when to stop. This Court has tried\nover the years to set mandamus boundaries through various tests, all of which soon generated\nexceptions, and most of which were met with objections that the “established” boundaries of\nmandamus were being ignored.\n\nOnly two years ago, we held in In re Palacios that mandamus review was available for “orders\nthat deny arbitration, but not orders that compel it.” 1 We noted that this was a reversal of previous\npractice, 2 but was necessitated by the Supreme Court's 2000 opinion in Green Tree Financial\nCorp. v. Randolph, which said that orders compelling arbitration “would not be appealable” unless\nthey included final dismissal of the case. 3 Today the Court comes full circle, saying once again that\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 1237\n\nmandamus review of orders compelling arbitration is “proper,” though courts should be “hesitant”\nabout it. 4 Apparently, so long as one expresses qualms, Palacios is a dead letter.\n\nOf course, firm rules governing mandamus are made to be broken, as issuance of the writ is\nprimarily a matter of judgment and prudence. 5 As the United States Supreme Court said in 2004,\nmandamus is appropriate if a party shows a clear right, no alternative remedy, and that mandamus\nis “appropriate under the circumstances.” 6 This test (especially the last prong) defies precise\napplication, but years of judicial effort have failed to produce a better one. As a result, reasonable\njudges will sometimes *362 disagree whether mandamus is “prudent” or “appropriate under the\ncircumstances,” and sometimes decide differently in one case than the next. But departing from\nPalacios is neither prudent nor appropriate for at least five reasons.\n\nFirst, Congress amended the Federal Arbitration Act in 1988 so that it “permits immediate appeal\nof orders hostile to arbitration, ... but bars appeal of interlocutory orders favorable to arbitration.” 7\nTexas law is to the same effect. 8 As the trial court's order here was favorable to arbitration, we\nshould defer to the cost-benefit analysis already conducted by the federal and state legislatures. 9\nWe cannot simply substitute mandamus when interlocutory appeal is prohibited without running\ninto serious Supremacy Clause problems; 10 “[f]requent pre-arbitration review would inevitably\nfrustrate Congress's intent to move the parties to an arbitrable dispute out of court and into\narbitration as quickly and easily as possible.” 11\n\nSecond, the trial court ordered these parties to arbitration five years ago. Had mandamus\nproceedings not intervened, this dispute would have long since been concluded. Surely the time\nand expense incurred arbitrating this case would have been less than that incurred in mandamus\nreview. And now that mandamus review is concluded, the parties must go to arbitration anyway.\nGiven our state's strong public policy favoring freedom of contract, 12 claims that a contract is\nunconscionable are asserted far more often than they are sustained. After today's decision, it is\nhard to see how any arbitration cannot be stopped in its tracks by alleging unconscionability.\n\nThird, today's opinion is purely advisory; if an arbitrator ignores it, there is little we can do. Both\nfederal and state law require courts to enforce an arbitrator's decision, no matter what it is, with\nvery few exceptions. 13 The allowable exceptions concern extrinsic or procedural matters like\ncorruption, fraud, or refusing to hear evidence; 14 they do not include (as the Supreme Court just\nheld) disregarding the law, even if a legal error is “manifest.” 15 What is the benefit of mandamus\nreview if the resulting order can be ignored?\n\n *363 Fourth, even if most arbitrators would comply with an appellate court's mandamus rulings,\nissuing them creates a hybrid procedure unknown to the arbitration acts. As already noted, those\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                      22\n\fIn re Poly-America, L.P., 262 S.W.3d 337 (2008)\n156 Lab.Cas. P 60,669, 28 IER Cases 140, 51 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1237\n\nstatutes commit matters concerning the law and the merits to the arbitrators and foreclose judicial\nreview of the details of the result. This also appears to violate the parties' agreement in this case,\nwhich authorized the arbitrator to address unconscionability:\n\n            Should any term of this Agreement be declared illegal, unenforceable, or\n            unconscionable, the remaining terms of the Agreement shall remain in full\n            force and effect. To the extent possible, both Employee and Company desire\n            that the Arbitrator modify the term(s) declared to be illegal, unenforceable, or\n            unconscionable in such a way as to retain the intended meaning of the term(s)\n            as closely as possible.\n\nTelling the arbitrators in advance what legal rulings they should make (as the Court does today)\nis an improper way to circumvent these restrictions.\n\nFifth and finally, the Court decides an important question in the abstract that the arbitration may\nrender moot. The Court concedes that unconscionability of the fee-splitting and discovery-limiting\nclauses should be deferred to the arbitrator. But unconscionability of the remedy-stripping clause\nis just as fact-based, and just as speculative until all the facts are arbitrated. The fairness of such\nclauses is not as one-sided as the Court suggests; many employees might actually prefer cash for\nlost wages (and no appellate delays) rather than reinstatement or a long shot at punitive damages.\nAs the Court notes, several courts have held that such “limitations of remedies are permissible.” 16\nTwice in 2003 the Supreme Court declined to hold that a remedy-stripping arbitration clause\nviolates the FAA—each time deferring the question until after arbitrators had addressed it. 17 We\nshould do the same here.\n\nWe have never held (as the Court holds repeatedly today) that an arbitration agreement is invalid\nunless an employee can “effectively vindicate his statutory rights.” 18 We did not say so in In re\nHalliburton Co. (as the Court's citations aver), where that phrase appears only in a parenthetical\ndescribing an opinion by an intermediate appellate court in Michigan, an opinion we neither\napproved nor adopted. 19 Nor does the Court's judgment comply with this new standard. Despite\nthe remedy limits imposed here, an arbitrator could still award Johnny Luna 50 years of future lost\nwages, which would certainly seem to “effectively vindicate his statutory rights.” Even more than\nthe fee-splitting or discovery-limiting provisions, it is simply too early to tell whether the remedy-\nstripping provisions will be unfair to Luna at all.\n\nSuch an important and controversial question should not be decided in such an offhanded and\nabstract way. We should instead wait to see whether the arbitration *364 award makes such a\ndecision necessary; “if it is not necessary to decide more, it is necessary not to decide more.” 20\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 1237\n\nThe Court overlooks all these problems on the ground that mandamus “has been broadly applied”\nby federal courts to review orders compelling arbitration. 21 But the string citations that follow do\nnot support that claim. Of the five cases cited, three predated Green Tree, 22 and a fourth did not\ninvolve a trial court order favorable to arbitration. 23 The single case granting mandamus relief\nfrom an order favorable to arbitration was by the Ninth Circuit, the court widely recognized as the\n“most hostile,” 24 “far to the left of center,” 25 and “renegade” court in the country in employment\narbitration cases. 26 Even so, mandamus was granted in that case only because arbitrating the\nsingle class representative's case could moot the class action he had brought, wiping it out without\nappellate review. 27 In short, there is no “broad” consensus for doing precisely the opposite of\nwhat Congress and the Texas Legislature intended.\n\n*365 It is certainly true that leaving matters like unconscionability to arbitrators will mean\ndevelopment of the law is “substantially hindered,” 28 but the same could be said of arbitration\nin all cases. It is hard to see the allure of a system in which decision-makers can ignore the law,\nunless of course one is planning to ignore the law oneself. Based on its popularity, few arbitrators\napparently go that far. But even carefully selected judges and jurors make mistakes, and carefully\nselected arbitrators are surely no less fallible. Nevertheless, these are policy matters that only\nCongress can address or amend; we cannot disregard the express legislative limits on interlocutory\nreview merely by calling it mandamus when we think the questions are important and the issues\nwell-briefed.\n\nWhile appeal from arbitration awards is very limited, that appeal is an adequate remedy unless the\nbenefits of mandamus outweigh the costs. 29 Considering the costs expended so far, I doubt Johnny\nLuna would consider them outweighed by getting the right to seek reinstatement in arbitration\n(which employees rarely request) and punitive damages (which they rarely get). Accordingly, I\nagree with the Court that the court of appeals erred in reviewing and reversing the trial court's\norder compelling arbitration. But I disagree that we have any place reviewing those matters either.\nTo that extent, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\nParallel Citations\n\n156 Lab.Cas. P 60,669, 28 IER Cases 140, 51 Tex. Sup. Ct.

In the suit, Khan sought damages pursuant to the lease's holdover provision,\ncontending that Meknojiya became a holdover tenant as a result of Khan's termination of the\nlease. Meknojiya moved for summary judgment on the sole ground that Khan's recovery under the\nholdover provision is barred as a matter of law because it represents an unenforceable penalty in\nthe form of “double-rent.” The trial court granted partial summary judgment in favor of Meknojiya,\nand following a bench trial only on attorney's fees, the court rendered a final judgment that Khan\ntake nothing on his claims and that Meknojiya recover attorney's fees. Because we conclude that\nthe holdover provision is not an unenforceable penalty, we reverse the trial court's judgment and\nremand the case for further proceedings.\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Meknojiya, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2013)\n2013 WL 3336874\n\n\n\n\n                                              BACKGROUND\n\nKhan owns commercial property located in Austin, Texas. In 1996, Khan and Meknojiya entered\ninto a written lease agreement, and Meknojiya began operating a convenience store on the leased\npremises. The parties renegotiated their lease (“the lease”) in March 2002. The renegotiated lease\nrequired Meknojiya to pay $4,500 per month in “base rent” and included the following paragraph,\nwhich the parties refer to as a “holdover provision”:\n\n           2.07 Holding Over.If Tenant does not vacate the Leased Premises upon the\n           expiration or earlier termination of the Lease, Tenant shall be a tenant at\n           sufferance for the holdover period and all of the terms and provisions of this\n           Lease shall be applicable during that period, except that Tenant shall pay\n           Landlord (in addition to additional rent payable under this Lease and any other\n           sums payable under this Lease) as base rental for the period of such holdover\n           an amount equal to two times the base rent which would have been payable by\n           Tenant had the holdover period been a part of the original terms of the Lease\n           (without waiver of Landlord's right to recover damages as permitted by law).\n\nAccording to Khan, Meknojiya committed a series of breaches following execution of the 2002\nlease. For instance, Khan contends that Meknojiya (1) failed to obtain or renew required insurance,\n(2) failed to provide the required insurance documentation, and (3) permitted a corporation owned\nby other individuals to operate the convenience store without obtaining Khan's prior written\nconsent. Khan notified Meknojiya in writing, through counsel, that Meknojiya was in default of\nthe lease and that Khan was exercising his option to terminate the lease effective May 1, 2002.\nNevertheless, despite additional notices of default, Meknojiya continued to occupy the premises\nand to pay $4,500 per month until January 2, 2007, the date the lease was set to have expired by\nits own terms.\n\nKhan subsequently sued Meknojiya for breach of the lease, asserting that upon Meknojiya's breach\nof the lease and Khan's notification that the lease was terminated, Meknojiya occupied the property\nas a tenant at sufferance. See ICM Mortg. Corp. v. Jacob, 902 S.W.2d 527, 530 (Tex.App.-El Paso\n1994, writ denied) (citing Restatement (First) of Property § 22 (1936)) (“A tenant at sufferance\nis a person who has been in lawful possession of property but who wrongfully remains as a\nholdover after his right to possession has expired.”). Khan sought damages in an amount equal\nto the difference that Meknojiya actually paid during the alleged holdover period and the amount\nthat Meknojiya was required to pay for the same time period under paragraph 2.07.\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Meknojiya, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2013)\n2013 WL 3336874\n\n*2 Khan moved for partial summary judgment, asserting that he conclusively established all\nelements of his claim for breach of the lease. 1 Meknojiya filed a response and subsequently moved\nfor summary judgment asserting that Khan's recovery was barred as a matter of law because the\ndouble-rent rate under paragraph 2.07 constitutes an unenforceable penalty. After conducting a\nhearing, the trial court granted Meknojiya's motion for summary judgment but denied Khan's\nmotion. Following a bench trial on Meknojiya's remaining counterclaim for attorney's fees, the trial\ncourt rendered a final judgment incorporating the trial court's order granting summary judgment\nin favor of Meknojiya and ordering Khan to pay $60,191.71 in attorney's fees. 2 In three issues on\nappeal, Khan argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Meknojiya\nand consequently, in awarding Meknojiya attorney's fees as the prevailing party.\n\n\n\n                                       STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nWe review a trial court's ruling on summary judgment de novo. Valence Operating Co. v. Dorsett,\n164 S.W.3d 656, 661 (Tex.2005). A moving party is entitled to summary judgment if (1) there\nare no genuine issues of material fact and (2) the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of\nlaw. Tex.R. Civ. P. 166a(c). A party who moves for traditional summary judgment on another\nparty's claim is entitled to summary judgment when he negates at least one essential element of\nthat claim or conclusively establishes each element of an affirmative defense. Science Spectrum,\nInc. v. Martinez, 941 S.W.2d 910, 911 (Tex.1997). When reviewing the trial court's summary\njudgment ruling, we take as true all evidence favorable to the nonmovant, and we indulge every\nreasonable inference and resolve any doubts in the nonmovant's favor.Valence Operating Co., 164\nS.W.3d at 661.\n\nIn part, Khan's arguments on appeal raise matters of contract construction. In construing a\nwritten agreement, we must ascertain and give effect to the parties' intentions as expressed in the\nagreement. Frost Nat'l Bank v. L & F Distribs., Ltd., 165 S.W.3d 310, 311–12 (Tex.2005) (per\ncuriam). We consider the agreement as a whole and attempt to harmonize and give effect to all\nprovisions of the contract. Id.

No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   3\n\fKhan v. Meknojiya, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2013)\n2013 WL 3336874\n\nThis assertion by Meknojiya is an affirmative defense that he had the burden of pleading and\nproving. See Phillips v. Phillips, 820 S.W.2d 785, 788 (Tex.1991). As a result, to be entitled to\nsummary judgment, Meknojiya had to conclusively establish every element of this defense. See\nRyland Grp., Inc. v. Hood, 924 S.W.2d 120, 121 (Tex.1996) (per curiam).\n\n *3 “The universal rule for measuring damages for the breach of a contract is just compensation\nfor the loss or damage actually sustained.”Phillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788. Accordingly, a liquidated-\ndamages provision is not enforceable if, in effect, it is a penalty. See id.(“Whether a contractual\nprovision is an enforceable liquidated damages provision or an unenforceable penalty is a question\nof law for the court to decide.”). A liquidated-damages provision is enforceable only if a court\nfinds that (1) the harm caused by the breach is incapable or difficult of estimation, and (2) the\namount of liquidated damages called for is a reasonable forecast of just compensation.Id. Whether\na liquidated-damages provision is an unenforceable penalty is a question of law for the court,\nalthough sometimes factual issues must be resolved before the court can decide the legal question.\nId.\n\nIn his first and second issues on appeal, Khan argues that the trial court erred in granting\nMeknojiya's summary-judgment motion because Meknojiya failed to conclusively establish the\nessential elements of his affirmative defense of penalty. Specifically, Khan argues that, as a matter\nof law, paragraph 2.07 is not an unenforceable penalty provision because it is not a liquidated-\ndamages provision at all. Instead, according to Khan, paragraph 2.07 simply sets forth the parties'\nagreed rental rate for any holdover period. Based on the unambiguous language of the lease, we\nagree.\n\nWhether a contract term is a liquidated-damages provision is a question of law for the court.\nValence Operating Co., 164 S.W.3d. at 644. “The term ‘liquidated damages' ordinarily refers to\nan acceptable measure of damages that parties stipulate in advance will be assessed in the event\nof a contract breach.”Flores v. Millennium Interests, Ltd., 185 S.W.3d 427, 431 (Tex.2005). Here,\nparagraph 2.07 sets an agreed-upon rental rate for situations in which the tenant has failed to\nsurrender the leased premises upon expiration of the lease term or earlier termination by one of the\nparties. The provision itself describes the amount due during the holdover period as “base rental for\nthe period of such holdover.”Further, paragraph 2.07 states that payment of such rental amounts\ndo not waive the landlord's right to recover “damages as permitted by law.” In other words, based\non the plain language of the lease, there is no indication that the parties intended the amounts owed\nunder paragraph 2.07 as a means of forecasting damages in the event of a breach. And, while rent\nunder paragraph 2.07 may, in certain circumstances, form the basis of measuring damages, it does\nnot independently set a damages amount or attempt to calculate damages. Simply put, any amount\nowed under paragraph 2.07 does not equate to a stipulated measure of damages; rather, it is an\nagreed-upon rental amount that is due under particular circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Meknojiya, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2013)\n2013 WL 3336874\n\nOur conclusion that paragraph 2.07 of the lease is not a liquidated-damages provision, and\ntherefore is not a penalty, is consistent with that of our sister court of appeals in Dallas in analyzing\nwhether a similar clause operated as a penalty provision. See Meridien Hotels, Inc. v. LHO Fin.\nP'ship I, L.P., 255 S.W.3d 807 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2008, no pet.). In Meridien Hotels, the landlord\nleased hotel space to the tenant under a lease that required the tenant to pay 1.5 times the base\nrental amount if the tenant remained in the space upon termination of the lease by one of the parties\nor the lease term's expiration. 3 Id. at 822.The landlord sent the tenant a notice of termination of\nthe lease, but the tenant remained in the hotel space anyway. Id. at 814.The landlord eventually\nsued the tenant, seeking multiple types and amounts of damages, including $2,130,136 in holdover\nrent, plus prejudgment interest, all of which the trial court awarded. Id.\n\n *4 The tenant appealed, claiming that the holdover rent provision was an unlawful penalty and\nthat, as a result, the trial court erred in awarding pre-judgment interest on that amount. Id. at\n822.Concluding that the holdover rental rate did not constitute a penalty, the court of appeals\nconcluded that the provision “does not punish appellants; it instead requires that if appellants make\nthe decision to hold over beyond the term of the lease, they must pay a higher rate for doing so.\nAppellants were on notice that [the landlord] considered the lease terminated, yet they chose to\nstay, having agreed in the lease to pay 1.5 times the usual rent for doing so.”Id.\n\nLikewise, in this case, paragraph 2.07 of the parties' lease agreement sets out in advance the rent to\nbe paid should the tenant choose to remain on the premises after one of the parties terminates the\nlease or the lease expires by its own terms, creating a tenancy at sufferance. Upon expiration or\ntermination of the lease, the tenant must decide whether to (1) leave the leased premises (assuming\nhe is not forcibly removed) or (2) hold over under the lease as a tenant at sufferance and pay\nadditional rent at the agreed holdover rate. Such additional rent is not a penalty; in fact, it does\nnot represent liquidated damages at all. Rather, the additional rent is the agreed-to, bargained-for\namount of rent due and owing in the event of a holdover. 4\n\nBecause paragraph 2.07 of the parties' lease agreement is not a liquidated-damages provision, it\ncannot be an unenforceable penalty, as a matter of law. We therefore conclude that the trial court\nerred in granting summary judgment in favor of Meknojiya on this ground. In addition, because\nMeknojiya should not have prevailed on summary judgment, it follows that he was not entitled to\nattorney's fees. We sustain appellant's first and second issues on appeal. 5\n\n\n\n                                               CONCLUSION\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Meknojiya, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2013)\n2013 WL 3336874\n\nBecause we conclude that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment, we reverse the trial\ncourt's judgment and award of attorney's fees in favor of Meknojiya. We remand the case to the\ntrial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    Khan also asked the trial court to render summary judgment that he was entitled to attorney's fees, but to reserve judgment on the\n        amount of fees for a separate hearing.\n2       Paragraph 13.03 of the lease states:\n              Attorney's Fees.The prevailing party in any legal proceeding brought under or with a relation to this agreement shall be entitled\n              to recover form the non-prevailing party, their reasonable attorney['s] fees, court costs and expenses, including but not limited\n              to travel and witness costs.\n3       Specifically, the lease at issue in Meridien Hotels, Inc. v. LHO Financing Partnership I, L.P., contained the following provision:\n              Any holding over by Tenant after the expiration or sooner termination of this Agreement shall be treated as a daily tenancy at\n              sufferance at a rate equal to one and one-half (1.5) times the Rent and other charges herein provided (prorated on a daily basis).\n           255 S.W.3d 807, 822 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2008, no pet.)\n4       Meknojiya relies on Phillips v. Phillips, 820 S.W.2d 785 (Tex.1991), for the proposition that a contractual provision in which one\n        party agrees to pay the other some multiple of damages is an unenforceable penalty. Phillips is a classic illustration of a liquidated-\n        damages provision that constitutes an unlawful penalty. In the midst of divorce proceedings, a husband and wife agreed to create\n        a limited partnership rather than divide their substantial assets. Id. at 786–87.The agreement contained the following provision: “If\n        the general partner breaches his trust hereunder, he shall pay to the limited partner as liquidated damages ten times the amount she\n        loses as a result of such breaches of trust.”Id. at 787.In other words, once actual damages were established for breach of the parties'\n        contract, they would be multiplied by ten to reach the damages award. Id. at 789.The supreme court held that this provision was an\n        unenforceable penalty provision, rather than an enforceable liquidated damages provision. Id.\n           Meknojiya's reliance on Phillips in this case is misplaced. First, unlike paragraph 2.07, the provision at issue in Phillips was\n           undisputedly a liquidated-damages provision. As previously discussed, paragraph 2.07 is not a liquidated-damages provision at\n           all, but instead is a rental amount that is triggered if and when the lease expires or is terminated. Second, the liquidated-damages\n           provision at issue in Phillips was an unenforceable penalty on its face because the amount awarded by the provision was computed\n           by multiplying actual damages (once established).See id. at 789.Here, paragraph 2.07 does not require a separate determination of\n           damages or the application of any multiplier to that amount. Thus, even if we were to conclude that paragraph 2.07 is a liquidated-\n           damages provision, unlike the court in Phillips we could not conclude that it constitutes a penalty on its face.\n5       In his third issue on appeal, Khan argues that, even if the double-rent rate set forth in paragraph 2.07 represents liquidated damages,\n        Meknojiya failed to satisfy his burden to establish that it is an unenforceable penalty. Having sustained Khan's first and second issues\n        on appeal, we do not address this issue.

Waterfront Cafe, Inc., 49 S.W.3d 544 (2001)\n\n\n\nOyster Investment Corporation (“Oyster”) leases from the University of Texas a commercial\nproperty on Lake Travis in Austin called “Oyster Landing.” Oyster subleases two adjoining\nrestaurant spaces in Oyster Landing to third parties. In 1993 Oyster subleased one restaurant space\nto Waterfront. At that time Oyster was subleasing the other space to Stillwater, Inc. (“Stillwater”),\nwhich was operating a restaurant known as “The Lodge at Lakeview” in the subleased space.\nUnder the terms of the sublease contract, Stillwater could not assign its interest in the sublease\nwithout Oyster's consent. In its subleased space, Waterfront began operating a restaurant called\n“Chuy's Hula Hut.” Waterfront's sublease provides that the restaurant in the other space must be\n“of substantially different character” from the Hula Hut. Waterfront describes the Hula Hut as\n“nautically-themed.”\n\nLandry's operates a chain of restaurants known as “Joe's Crab Shack.” In 1996 Landry's began\nnegotiations with Stillwater to assume Stillwater's sublease and operate a Joe's Crab Shack\nrestaurant in the space occupied by The Lodge at Lakeview. Waterfront learned of Landry's plan\nand voiced its objection to Oyster that a Joe's Crab Shack restaurant would not be “of substantially\ndifferent character” from the Hula Hut. The sublease between Waterfront and Oyster included an\narbitration clause, and the two parties entered into arbitration. The arbitrators issued a decision in\nMay 1997, which found that Joe's Crab Shack was not “of substantially different character” from\nthe Hula Hut. Landry's did not participate in the arbitration and apparently was not invited to do\nso. As a result, Oyster declined to approve Stillwater's assignment of its sublease to Landry's.\n\nIn June 1997 Landry's brought this suit against Waterfront and Oyster for “tortiously interfer[ing]\nwith the contractual relationship between it and Stillwater,” “maliciously [and] intentionally\ninterfering with and preventing [a] business relationship [with Stillwater] from occurring and\ncontinuing,” acting in a “conspiracy to tortiously interfere with a contract and a business\nrelationship,” and entering “into a combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade.” Landry's also\nfiled suit against Stillwater. Waterfront filed a traditional motion for summary judgment. See\nTex.R. Civ. P. 166a(b). Landry's did not respond. The district court granted Waterfront's motion\nand severed Landry's claims against Waterfront from those against Oyster and Stillwater. The\ncourt denied Landry's motion for new trial. By five issues, Landry's appeals the district court's\nsummary judgment in favor of Waterfront and the court's denial of Landry's motion for new trial.\n\n\n\n                                                 DISCUSSION\n\nSummary Judgment\n [1] [2] [3] Summary judgments must stand on their own merits.

Id. (citing City of Houston v. Clear Creek\nBasin Auth., 589 S.W.2d 671, 678 (Tex.1979)). But when the nonmovant fails to file a response,\nthe sole issue on appeal is whether the movant's proof entitles it to judgment as a matter of law.\nClear Creek Basin Auth., 589 S.W.2d at 678.\n\n [4] [5] A traditional motion for summary judgment is properly granted when the movant\nestablishes that there are no genuine issues of material fact to be decided and that it is entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law. Tex.R. Civ. P. 166a(c); Rhone–Poulenc, 997 S.W.2d at 222; Lear\nSiegler, Inc. v. Perez, 819 S.W.2d 470, 471 (Tex.1991). All doubts are resolved against the movant,\nand the reviewing court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant.\nLear Siegler, 819 S.W.2d at 471. When a defendant moves for summary judgment based on an\naffirmative defense, the defendant, as movant, bears the burden of conclusively proving each\nessential element of its defense. See Rhone–Poulenc, 997 S.W.2d at 223; Ryland Group, Inc. v.\nHood, 924 S.W.2d 120, 121 (Tex.1996).\n\nBy its first three issues, Landry's complains that the district court erred in granting Waterfront's\nmotion for summary judgment because Waterfront “completely failed to establish the elements of\nits affirmative defense, and the burden to respond never shifted to Landry.” Waterfront moved for\nsummary judgment based on the affirmative defense of legal justification. The supreme court has\nheld that justification is an affirmative defense to a claim of tortious interference with contract.\nTexas Beef Cattle Co. v. Green, 921 S.W.2d 203, 210 (Tex.1996).\n\nWaterfront and Landry's dispute what Waterfront must prove to prevail. Waterfront relies on Texas\nBeef Cattle, which established that the defense of justification is based on either the exercise of (1)\none's own legal rights or (2) a good-faith claim to a colorable legal right, even though that claim\nultimately proves to be mistaken. See id. at 211. Waterfront does not dispute that it provided no\nevidence that its actions were done in good faith; therefore, to have prevailed on this defense, it\nmust have conclusively proved that it was exercising its own legal right. If the trial court found as\na matter of law that the defendant, in exercising a legal right, interfered with a contract, then the\ndefendant has conclusively established the justification defense. Id. Waterfront asserts that it was\nexercising a right provided it under its sublease with Oyster. The sublease states that Oyster will\nonly lease the adjoining space to a restaurant of substantially different character and provides for\narbitration between Oyster and Waterfront in the event of a sublease dispute.\n\nLandry's counters that a party seeking summary judgment on the affirmative defense of\njustification must conclusively prove that (1) “the acts of interference were not in themselves\ntortious and or unlawful,” (2) “the acts of interference were consistent with protecting the right\nat issue,” and (3) “the contractual right to interfere exists as a matter of law pursuant to an\nunambiguous contract.” Landry's relies on Prudential Insurance Co. of America v. Financial\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    3\n\fLandry's Seafood Restaurants, Inc. v. Waterfront Cafe, Inc., 49 S.W.3d 544 (2001)\n\n\n\nReview Services, *548 Inc., 29 S.W.3d 74 (Tex.2000), 1 as support for its claim that Waterfront\nmust prove that its acts were not tortious or unlawful. In Financial Review Services, the supreme\ncourt observed that an otherwise legitimate privilege may not be exercised by resorting to illegal\nor tortious means, and that a defendant, under the guise of exercising a privilege, may not say\nor do whatever it sees fit. Id. at 81. Thus, Landry's concludes, “The obvious and fatal flaw in\nWaterfront's summary judgment motion was that it filed no evidence whatsoever as to its own\nacts of interference. Without such evidence it could not conclusively establish that those acts were\nlawful and consistent with the right being asserted.”\n\nHowever Financial Review Services does not relieve Landry's of pleading acts by Waterfront that\nconstitute tortious interference.\n\n   Generally, justification is established as a matter of law when the acts the plaintiff complains\n   of as tortious interference are merely the defendant's exercise of its own contractual rights.\n\n   ... Thus, if the plaintiff pleads and proves methods of interference that are tortious in themselves,\n   then the issue of privilege or justification never arises.\n\nId. (emphasis added). Landry's has failed to make any specific allegation as to what actions\nWaterfront took that interfered with its business and contractual relations. Even construing the\npetition liberally in favor of Landry's, see Roark v. Allen, 633 S.W.2d 804, 809 (Tex.1982),\nthe only claims are that Waterfront “engaged in conduct to prevent the sale by Stillwater of its\nleasehold interest to Landry's” and “knowingly and unlawfully interfered with the contractual and\nprospective business relationship between Stillwater, Inc. and Landry's.” There are no specific\nallegations of any actions on the part of Waterfront.\n\nWaterfront, however, has provided summary-judgment proof that, pursuant to its sublease, it\nengaged in arbitration with Oyster. This is the only evidence in the record of any actions on the\npart of Waterfront. In Financial Review Services, Financial Review Services' (“FRS”) pleadings\ndisclosed no fewer than five specific factual allegations of how Prudential disparaged FRS and\ninterfered with its contracts and business relations. Financial Review Servs., 29 S.W.3d at 81. “To\nraise an issue of whether Prudential interfered with FRS's contract by tortiously disparaging FRS,\nthere must be evidence that Prudential made statements rising to the level of trade disparagement.\nTo do so, FRS must first present evidence that Prudential made false statements of fact about\nFRS.” Id. at 82 (emphasis added) (citing Hurlbut v. Gulf Atl. Life Ins. Co., 749 S.W.2d 762, 766\n(Tex.1987)). Landry's presented no evidence that would raise an issue that Waterfront committed\nany acts other than relying on the provisions of its sublease with Oyster.\n\n [6] Landry's also claims that a party asserting justification must prove that its acts of interference\n“were consistent with protecting the right at issue.” In addition to Financial Review Services,\nLandry's directs this Court to two federal cases to support its proposition. See Access Telecom,\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                     4\n\fLandry's Seafood Restaurants, Inc. v. Waterfront Cafe, Inc., 49 S.W.3d 544 (2001)\n\n\n\n*549 Inc. v. MCI Telecomms. Corp., 197 F.3d 694, 710 (5th Cir.1999); Wardlaw v. Inland\nContainer Corp., 76 F.3d 1372, 1379 (5th Cir.1996). 2 Without addressing whether Landry's\nassertion is a correct statement of the law, we note that Waterfront has proven that the arbitration\nbetween it and Oyster, the only Waterfront act detected in the record, concerned the sublease's\nlanguage that the adjoining space would not be occupied by a restaurant of substantially similar\ncharacter.\n\n [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Finally, Landry's asserts that any contractual right to interfere must\nexist “as a matter of law pursuant to an unambiguous contract.” We agree that this is a correct\nstatement of the law. See Friendswood Dev. Co. v. McDade + Co., 926 S.W.2d 280, 282\n(Tex.1996). However, we disagree with Landry's contention that the Oyster–Waterfront sublease\nis an ambiguous contract. Section 4.2 of the sublease reads, “Landlord [Oyster] covenants and\nagrees that the two full service restaurants shall be of substantially different characters [sic] and\noffer substantially different menus to provide a diversity of food service for the customers visiting\n[Oyster Landing].” Landry's argues that “the exact meaning of [‘substantially different characters']\nis uncertain, making the provision ambiguous,” and “[where] the contract is ambiguous, the\nasserted legal right cannot be established as a matter of law.” 3 Whether a contract is ambiguous is\na question of law for the court to decide. Id. (citing National Union Fire Ins. Co. v. CBI Indus., Inc.,\n907 S.W.2d 517, 520 (Tex.1995); Coker v. Coker, 650 S.W.2d 391, 394 (Tex.1983)). A contract\nis ambiguous when its meaning is uncertain and doubtful or it is reasonably susceptible to more\nthan one meaning. Coker, 650 S.W.2d at 393. “If a contract is worded in such a manner that it can\nbe given a definite or certain legal meaning, then it is not ambiguous.” Friendswood Dev., 926\nS.W.2d at 282 (citing CBI Indus., 907 S.W.2d at 520; Coker, 650 S.W.2d at 393). Interpreting\nthe sublease according to its plain meaning, see Northern Natural Gas Co. v. Conoco, Inc., 986\nS.W.2d 603, 606 (Tex.1998), it is not rendered ambiguous by its use of the word “character.”\n“Character” has a meaning from common usage; it is understood to mean an entity's features,\ntraits, and qualities. 4 The character of a restaurant includes its interior and exterior appearance,\nits menu, its atmosphere, and the attire of employees, among other things.\n\nHere, the sublease separates “character” from “menu” and provides that, in the two restaurants\nlocated in Oyster Landing, both character and menu are to be “substantially different.” If the\nmenu is not included in the sublease's use of “character,” what remains of a restaurant's character\ncan only be the decor and atmosphere. This is the intention expressed in the language used by\nOyster and Waterfront. See Reilly v. Rangers Mgmt., Inc., 727 S.W.2d 527, 529 (Tex.1987) (“The\ninterpretation of a written contract is a quest for the intention of the parties to it.”). We hold that\nthe use of “character” in the sublease between Oyster and Waterfront is not uncertain nor is it\nreasonably *550 susceptible to more than one meaning; the sublease is not ambiguous.\n\nLandry's next attacks Waterfront's evidence. As summary-judgment proof, Waterfront submitted\nto the district court (1) a certified copy of Landry's first amended petition, (2) an affidavit of\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                     5\n\fLandry's Seafood Restaurants, Inc. v. Waterfront Cafe, Inc., 49 S.W.3d 544 (2001)\n\n\n\nMichael R. Young (Waterfront's custodian of records) identifying and authenticating an attached\ncopy of the sublease between Oyster and Waterfront, and (3) an affidavit of William C. Bryant (one\nof the arbitrators) identifying and authenticating an attached copy of the arbitrators' memorandum\nin the proceeding between Oyster and Waterfront.\n\nSection 10.17 of the sublease allows the parties to the sublease, Waterfront and Oyster, to submit a\n“dispute or matter” arising under the sublease to binding arbitration. Bryant's affidavit and attached\nmemorandum reflect that Waterfront and Oyster arbitrated the question of whether a Joe's Crab\nShack restaurant would be substantially different in character from the Hula Hut. Outside of its\nformal preface and conclusion, Bryant's affidavit states:\n\n   “My name is William C. Bryant. I am of sound mind, capable of making this affidavit, and\n   personally acquainted with the facts herein stated:\n\n   “In the spring of 1997, I acted as one of the arbitrators in a matter entitled ‘Arbitration\n   Proceeding Between Oyster Boat Town[e] Landing, Ltd. And Waterfront Café, Inc. (The\n   “Oyster–Waterfront Proceeding”)’. Attached hereto as Exhibit 1 is a true and correct copy of\n   a Memorandum signed by me and issued on or about May 22, 1997 in which Dean Blaine and\n   I, acting as arbitrators with the consent of both parties, announced our findings in the Oyster–\n   Waterfront Proceeding.”\n\nThe arbitrators' memorandum attached to Bryant's affidavit contains the only summary-judgment\nproof that describes the “character” of the Hula Hut and proposed Joe's Crab Shack and concludes\nthat the two restaurants would not be substantially different in character. 5\n\n *551 [12] The rules of civil procedure provide that affidavits in support of a motion for summary\njudgment “shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible\nin evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated\ntherein.” Tex.R. Civ. P. 166a(f). Defects in summary-judgment proof fall into two categories—\ndefects in form and defects in substance. Substantive defects can be asserted for the first time on\nappeal, but formal defects are waived if not raised in the trial court. See id.; Life Ins. Co. v. Gar–\nDal, Inc., 570 S.W.2d 378, 381 (Tex.1978); Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Penn, 363 S.W.2d\n230, 233–34 (Tex.1962).\n\n [13] [14] Bryant's affidavit states that the attachment is a true and correct copy of the arbitrators'\nmemorandum, but it does not state that the facts contained in the memorandum are true and correct.\nLandry's neither filed a response to Waterfront's motion for summary judgment nor objected to\nBryant's affidavit. This Court has determined that the failure to object to the form of an affidavit\non the ground that it does not show personal knowledge waives the complaint on appeal. McBride\nv. New Braunfels Herald–Zeitung, 894 S.W.2d 6, 8 (Tex.App.—Austin 1994, writ denied).

Furthermore, copies of documents attached to a properly prepared affidavit are sworn\ncopies within the meaning of rule 166a(f). Republic Nat'l Leasing Corp. v. Schindler, 717 S.W.2d\n606, 607 (Tex.1986); McBride, 894 S.W.2d at 8. “Rule 166a(f) does not require that the affiant\nhave personal knowledge of the contents of attached sworn exhibits.” McBride, 894 S.W.2d at 8.\n\n [15] The only question that remains is whether the arbitrators' memorandum proves that the Hula\nHut and Landry's Crab Shack would not be of substantially different character. The evidence before\nthe district court and this Court is sparse. Waterfront produced little summary-judgment proof.\nHowever, Landry's produced no controverting evidence. A nonmovant must present summary-\njudgment proof when necessary to establish a fact issue. Clear Creek Basin Auth., 589 S.W.2d at\n678. Waterfront provided evidence as to the decor and atmosphere of the two restaurants, elements\nthat we have determined were intended in the sublease's use of “character.” The arbitrators'\nmemorandum, in the absence of any controverting evidence, establishes that the Hula Hut and\nLandry's Crab Shack were not substantially different in character.\n\nWe hold that the uncontroverted summary-judgment proof conclusively establishes *552 that\nWaterfront's alleged actions were done in the exercise of its own legal right provided by its sublease\nwith Oyster. We overrule Landry's first three issues.\n\n\nMotion for New Trial\nBy its last two issues, Landry's complains that the district court erred in denying its motion for new\ntrial. Landry's claims that the district court treated Waterfront's motion for summary judgment as a\nno-evidence summary judgment. See Tex.R. Civ. P. 166a(i). Landry's continues that because it had\nno notice that Waterfront was seeking a no-evidence summary judgment, the summary judgment\ngranted by the district court was a default summary judgment. Landry's contentions are without\nmerit because Waterfront established its right to a traditional summary judgment as a matter of law\nby proving its affirmative defense of justification. Waterfront was not seeking, nor was it granted,\na no-evidence summary judgment. We overrule Landry's final two issues.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Powers, Senior Justice (retired), Third Court of Appeals, sitting by assignment. See Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 74.003(b)\n        (West 1998).\n1       Financial Review Services involved whether the defendant had conclusively established a justification defense in a tortious-\n        interference case. See Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. v. Financial Review Servs., 29 S.W.3d 74 (Tex.2000). The defendant had been\n        granted a partial summary judgment on some issues and a directed verdict on the remaining issues. Id. at 76. The supreme court\n        held that because the plaintiff had presented “at least some evidence” of improper conduct by the defendant, the defendant “did not\n        establish its justification defense as a matter of law.” Id. at 83.\n2       We note that although this Court may consider the decisions of federal courts of appeals, we are not bound by them. See Newth v.\n        Adjutant General's Dep't, 883 S.W.2d 356, 359 (Tex.App.—Austin 1994, writ denied).\n3       Landry's neither pleaded nor argued ambiguity in the district court\n\n4       Webster's defines character as “distinctive differentiating mark,” the “aggregate of distinctive qualities” of a thing, and an “outward\n        and visible quality or trait.” Webster's Third New International Dictionary 376 (Philip B. Gove ed., 1986).\n5       The memorandum provides, in pertinent part, the following:\n             We have been asked to decide the following question:\n                           “Is a Joe's Crab Shack restaurant substantially different in character from the Chuy's Hula Hut restaurant\n                           presently operated by Waterfront at [Oyster Landing]?”\n             It is our decision that the answer to that question is no. To the contrary, it is our opinion that a Joe's Crab Shack restaurant is\n             substantially similar in character to the Chuy's Hula Hut restaurant presently operated by Waterfront at the Facility.\n             The requirements in Section 4.2 of the Oyster–Waterfront sublease that the restaurants be of substantially different characters is\n             separate and independent from the requirement that they offer substantially different menus. We do not believe the [sub]lease\n             should be interpreted to make superfluous the requirement of substantially different characters. In addition, the requirement is\n             not just that the restaurants be of different characters but that they be of substantially different characters.\n             We view the requirement of substantially different characters to require the restaurants to have substantially different\n             characteristics, distinguishments, structures, functions and qualities—not just menu items. In that regard Hula Hut is described\n             by its owner as a typical beach hut, surf shack or old wharf boat house typical along sea coasts everywhere. The building is\n             built out of salvaged lumber and old boats, motors, surfboards, fishing nets, wooden fish and pictures of Hawaiian scenes are\n             randomly hung or placed within the restaurant.\n             Landry's Seafood Restaurant, Inc.'s Form 10K describes the character of a Joe's Crab Shack as “an old fishing camp with a\n             wood facade, tin roof and a raised outside deck. The Crab Shack restaurants feature a casual, nautical theme ...” Various articles\n             describe Joe's Crab Shack as having fish nets, sea shells, and other fake bounty from the sea, and a weatherbeaten facade giving\n             the impression of a Gulf fishing camp. Apart from menu, the characteristics of the two restaurants appear nearly identical.\n             Photographs that have been supplied to us also indicate that the characters appear to be very similar and not of a substantially\n             different nature.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                            © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Although we will discuss the various proceedings\nin more detail later in the opinion, we will briefly summarize the proceedings here. The\nCommissioner of Insurance became concerned that LHR Enterprises, Inc.; Transglobal Mortgage,\nInc.; Business Staffing, Inc.; Task Services, Inc.; Rick Chapman; and Harry Sewill (cumulatively\n“the appellants”) were engaged in the unauthorized practice of insurance and referred the matter\nto the State Office of Administrative Hearings (“SOAH”). In response, the appellants filed a\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.              1\n\fLHR Enterprises, Inc. v. Geeslin, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2007)\n2007 WL 3306492\n\ndeclaratory-judgment action in district court seeking declarations that the Commissioner did\nnot have the authority to refer the matter for a hearing before SOAH. Shortly thereafter, the\nCommissioner and the Department filed a plea to the jurisdiction contending that the district court\ndid not have jurisdiction over the case because the appellants had failed to show a valid waiver of\nsovereign immunity. The district court granted the plea, and the appellants appealed the judgment\nof the district court. We will dismiss this case for want of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n                                               BACKGROUND\n\nProceedings Before SOAH\nThe case presently before us is related to another case involving the appeal of an administrative\norder. Because it is helpful in explaining the outcome of this appeal, we will briefly review some\nof the facts of the related case.\n\nIn 2004, the staff of the Department of Insurance (“Staff”) became concerned that several\ncompanies and individuals, including the appellants, were engaged in the unauthorized business\nof insurance. SeeTex. Ins.Code Ann. §§ 101.051 (specifying what constitutes business of\ninsurance), .102 (prohibiting unauthorized business of insurance) (West Supp.2006). In particular,\nthe Staff believed that the appellants and others were improperly engaged in the business of\nproviding various companies' employees with workers' compensation insurance coverage.\n\nAfter formalizing their concerns, the Staff filed a report with the Commissioner that detailed the\nallegations against the appellants and others. The report also contained the Staff's recommendation\nthat the Commissioner order that all the parties investigated (1) be held jointly and severally liable\nfor any unpaid workers' compensation claims, (2) pay monetary penalties, and (3) cease practicing\nthe business of insurance in Texas. See id. §§ 84.041 (providing that if Staff determines that\ninsurance violations have occurred, they have the authority to file report with Commissioner that\nspecifies facts forming basis of their conclusion and also specifies any penalty that they feel should\nbe imposed), .021 (West Supp.2006) (authorizing Commissioner to impose penalty on individual\nwho violates insurance law, rule, or order).\n\nIn July 2004, the Commissioner referred the matter to SOAH for a contested-case hearing\nto determine whether the appellants and others had engaged in the unauthorized business of\ninsurance and whether a cease-and-desist order prohibiting the parties from engaging in the\nallegedly improper actions should be issued. See, e.g., id. §§ 31.021(a) (requiring Commissioner\nto “administer and enforce” insurance code), 40.002 (requiring SOAH to conduct hearing when\nrequired under insurance code), 101.151 (West Supp.2006) (authorizing Commissioner to set\nhearing to determine whether cease-and-desist order should be imposed if, among other things,\nCommissioner has reason to believe that individual has violated insurance provision or rule).\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Geeslin, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2007)\n2007 WL 3306492\n\n\n\n *2 During the proceedings, the investigated parties, including the appellants, filed pleas to the\njurisdiction and a motion for summary disposition. The administrative law judge overseeing the\ncase denied the motions, and the investigated parties appealed the administrative law judge's\nruling to the Commissioner. The Commissioner denied the appeal. Subsequently, a hearing was\nscheduled before SOAH.\n\n\nDeclaratory-Judgment Action\nSoon after the Commissioner requested a hearing before SOAH, the appellants filed a petition for\ndeclaratory relief in the district court. SeeTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. §§ 37.001-.011 (West\n1997 & Supp.2006) (Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act). The propriety of the district court's\njudgment is the subject of this appeal.\n\nIn their petition, the appellants sought, among other things, a declaration that the Commissioner\ndid not have the authority to require a hearing before SOAH. Specifically, they sought a declaration\nthat the Commissioner has no authority to require a hearing or impose administrative penalties on\nindividuals that are neither licensed to engage in the business of insurance nor regulated by the\ninsurance code. SeeTex. Ins.Code Ann. § 84.021 (West Supp.2006) (authorizing Commissioner\nto impose administrative penalties on individuals who are “licensed or regulated” under insurance\ncode or another Texas insurance law).\n\nIn addition, the appellants also sought a declaration that the Commissioner may not refer a matter\nto SOAH for a determination of whether a cease-and-desist order should be issued to stop an\nindividual from engaging in certain activities when the statutory time for requesting a hearing\nhas expired. See id. §§ 101.151(a) (authorizing Commissioner to set hearing concerning issuance\nof cease-and-desist order and specifying that Commissioner is required to provide notice of\nhearing), .152 (providing that unless parties agree otherwise, hearing must be held “not earlier than\nthe fifth day or later than the 30th day after” notice was given), .153 (West Supp.2006) (allowing\nCommissioner to issue cease-and-desist order after hearing has been held).\n\nIn response to the appellants' petition, the Commissioner and the Department filed a plea to the\njurisdiction. In their plea, they argued that because this case is essentially a suit against state\nagencies, the appellants had the burden of proving a waiver of sovereign immunity. Further, the\nCommissioner and the Department contended that because the appellants failed to plead and prove\na waiver, the district court did not have jurisdiction over the appellants' claims.\n\nUltimately, the district court granted the plea to the jurisdiction, and the appellants appeal the\ndistrict court's judgment.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  3\n\fLHR Enterprises, Inc. v. Geeslin, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2007)\n2007 WL 3306492\n\n\n\n\n                                                 DISCUSSION\n\nThe appellants raise three issues on appeal. First, they argue that the district court erred when it\ngranted the plea to the jurisdiction. Specifically, they contend that their suit does not implicate\nsovereign immunity because it seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against state officials acting\nbeyond their statutory authority. See Texas Natural Res. Comm'n v. IT-Davy, 74 S.W.3d 849, 855\n(Tex.2002) (explaining that “[p]rivate parties may seek declaratory relief against state officials\nwho allegedly act without legal or statutory authority” but that “such suits are not ‘suits against\nthe State’ ... because suits to compel state officers to act within their official capacity do not\nattempt to subject the State to liability” and, therefore, “do not implicate the sovereign-immunity\ndoctrine” (citation omitted)). Second, the appellants argue that the district court erred by failing to\ndeclare that the Commissioner does not have the authority to impose administrative penalties on\nindividuals who are not licensed or regulated under the provisions of the insurance code. Finally,\nthe appellants insist that the district court erred when it failed to declare that the Commissioner\nmay not refer a matter to SOAH for a hearing if the referral is not made within the time allowed\nby statute.\n\n *3 After the appellants filed this appeal, the SOAH hearing for determining whether the appellants\nand the other investigated parties had engaged in the unauthorized practice of insurance was held.\nAfter the hearing concluded, the Commissioner issued a final order, which specified that none of\nthe appellants had violated any insurance provision or regulation and that, accordingly, no sanction\nor penalty should be imposed upon them. Shortly thereafter, the Commissioner and the Department\nfiled a motion to dismiss this appeal. 1 In their motion, the Commissioner and the Department\nargue that because a final order has been issued absolving the appellants of any wrongdoing, this\nCourt no longer has subject-matter jurisdiction over the appellants' declaratory claims. Because\nour resolution of the motion to dismiss is dispositive of this appeal, we will now turn to the various\narguments made by the parties regarding the motion to dismiss.\n\nThe appellants seek relief under the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act. SeeTex. Civ. Prac. &\nRem.Code Ann. § 37.001-.011. The Act allows an individual “whose rights, status, or other legal\nrelations are affected by a statute” to “have determined any question of construction or validity\narising under the ... statute ... and obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other legal relations\nthereunder.”Id. § 37.04(a) (West 1997). In this case, the appellants seek declarations concerning\nthe authority of the Commissioner. This Court has previously recognized that individuals may\nrequest declaratory relief regarding whether state agencies or officers have acted beyond their\nstatutory authorities. See, e.g., Texas Dep't of Ins., Div. of Workers' Comp. v. Lumbermens Mut.\nCas. Co., 212 S.W.3d 870, 874-75 (Tex.App.-Austin 2006, pet. denied) (holding that claimant\nmay seek declaration that agency's issuance of advisories was outside agency's statutory authority).\nHowever, while individuals may employ the Act to challenge actions as beyond an agency's or\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Geeslin, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2007)\n2007 WL 3306492\n\nofficer's authority, a court must still have subject-matter jurisdiction over the case before it may\nproperly issue a declaration. Subject-matter jurisdiction may be considered for the first time on\nappeal, and appellate courts may raise that issue on their own accord. See Aguilar v. Weber, 72\nS.W.3d 729, 731 (Tex.App.-Waco 2002, no pet.). The Act does not expand the scope of a trial\ncourt's subject-matter jurisdiction but merely authorizes a court “to declare rights, status, and\nother legal relations” when subject-matter jurisdiction is already present. SeeTex. Civ. Prac. &\nRem.Code Ann. § 37.003(a) (West 1997) (court may act “within its jurisdiction”); Texas Ass'n\nof Bus. v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440, 444 (Tex.1993). Although the Act does not\nexpand the jurisdiction of a trial court, “[a] suit under the [Act] is not confined to cases in which\nthe parties have a cause of action apart from the Act itself.”Texas Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Moore,\n985 S.W.2d 149, 153 (Tex.App.-Austin 1998, no pet.).\n\n *4 In order for a court to have jurisdiction to consider a declaratory-judgment action, there must\nbe a “justiciable controversy as to the rights and status of” the parties, and the requested declaration\n“must actually resolve the controversy.” Brooks v. Northglen Ass'n, 141 S.W.3d 158, 163-64\n(Tex.2004).“A justiciable controversy is one in which a real and substantial controversy exists\ninvolving a genuine conflict of tangible interests and not merely a theoretical dispute.”Moore, 985\nS.W.2d at 153;see also City of Euless v. Dallas/Fort Worth Int'l Airport Bd., 936 S.W.2d 699,\n703 (Tex.App.-Dallas 1996, writ denied) (explaining that if there is no actual controversy between\nparties, declaratory judgment is improper). However, a person seeking declaratory relief need not\nhave yet incurred an actual injury of the sort for which consequential relief might be granted.\nSee Bexar Metro. Water Dist. v. City of Bulverde, 156 S.W.3d 79, 88 (Tex.App.-Austin 2004,\npet. denied). Instead, the Act is intended to provide a means to determine, before any wrong has\nactually occurred, the rights of parties when a controversy has arisen and is remedial in nature. Id.\n\nThe need for a justiciable controversy is related to the jurisdictional concepts of standing and\nripeness and does not supersede these concepts. See Texas Dep't of Ins v. Reconveyance Servs.,\nInc., No. 03-06-00313-CV, ---S.W.3d ----, ----, 2007 Tex.App. LEXIS 7262, at *38, 2007 WL\n2462043 (Tex.App.-Austin Aug. 31, 2007, no pet. h.). Ripeness is a necessary component of\nsubject-matter jurisdiction, Atmos Energy Corp. v. Abbott, 127 S.W.3d 852, 857 (Tex.App.-Austin\n2004, no pet.), and concerns when a claim may be made, Patterson v. Planned Parenthood, 971\nS.W.2d 439, 442 (Tex.1998). The requirement that a claim be ripe for review is based on the\nprohibition against issuing advisory opinions. Id.; see alsoTex. Const. art. II, § 1 (separation of\npowers); Northglen Ass'n, 141 S.W.3d at 164 (explaining that separation of powers provision bars\nissuance of advisory opinions). A claim is ripe if the facts involved demonstrate that “an injury\nhas occurred or is likely to occur.”Patterson, 971 S.W.2d at 442;see also City of Waco v. Texas\nNatural Res. Comm'n, 83 S.W.3d 169, 175 (Tex.App.-Austin 2002, pet. denied) (“In determining\nwhether a cause is ripe for judicial consideration, we look to see if the facts have sufficiently\ndeveloped to show that an injury has occurred, or is likely to occur”). In other words, there must\nbe a concrete injury for the claim to be ripe. See Atmos Energy Corp., 127 S.W.3d at 858. A claim\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Geeslin, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2007)\n2007 WL 3306492\n\nis not ripe if it is based on hypothetical or contingent facts that may not occur as anticipated or\nmay not occur at all. See Waco Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Gibson, 22 S.W.3d 849, 852 (Tex.2000).\n\nIn this case, there is no concrete dispute to resolve. The appellants pled the following, relevant\njurisdictional facts as the basis for their suit:\n\n    *5 On June 24, 2004, pursuant to section 84.041 of the insurance code, the Staff delivered to\n   the Commissioner a report “in which it alleged that these Plaintiffs engaged in activities in the\n   State of Texas in violation of the Texas Insurance Code, and recommended that administrative\n   penalties be assessed against them in the aggregate amount of $2,000,000.”\n\n            “[T]he Staff, on July 16, 2004, filed with SOAH and served on these Plaintiffs\n            a Notice of Hearing, thereby initiating a contested case ... [which] was assigned\n            Docket No. 454-4-75940H.”\n\n   The pleadings then recount that the appellants filed a plea to the jurisdiction and general denial\n   in the SOAH proceeding, that the Staff filed a response asserting various statutory bases for\n   jurisdiction, that the administrative law judge denied the appellant's plea to the jurisdiction and\n   summary disposition motion, and that they appealed the decision to the Commissioner, who\n   upheld it.\n\n   The appellants pled that they “have not and will not voluntarily subject themselves to the\n   [Department]'s jurisdiction” and sought a declaration that “the Commissioner as a matter of law\n   does not have jurisdiction over the Plaintiffs to take the action contemplated by the July 16,\n   2004 Notice of Hearing.”\n\nSubsequently, as previously discussed, the Commissioner issued a final order in the complained-\nof contested-case proceeding. The Commissioner's order concluded that none of the appellants\nwere engaged in the unauthorized practice of insurance or had violated any insurance provisions\nor regulations and that, therefore, no penalty should be imposed upon the appellants. As the State\nargues, these developments resolve the controversy on which Appellants' suit is based, i.e., the\nsubject matter of the July 16, 2004 Notice of Hearing has been resolved in Appellants' favor.\n\nAppellants nonetheless urge that a justiciable controversy remains because the Commissioner's\norder states a conclusion of law that, “Under Tex. Ins.Code § 84.021, the Commission may impose\nan administrative penalty on a person, including an entity, that is licensed or regulated under and\nwho violates the Insurance Code or rules adopted or orders issued thereunder.”However, absent\nanother impending hearing or other action by the Department adversely impacting the appellants\nin some concrete way, the Commissioner's legal conclusion amounts to a bare, abstract statement\nof legal opinion, and any judicial determination regarding the conclusion would necessarily be\nno more than a mere abstract advisory opinion.

Cintas Corp., 923 S.W.2d 663 (1996)\n\n\n\nMurphy to file a trial amendment after the court had taken the case under advisement. We will\naffirm.\n\nCintas Corporation is a national company that rents uniforms, towels and mats to businesses on a\nweekly basis. Murphy owns and *665 operates an Exxon and Chevron service station in Tyler,\nTexas. From 1988 until 1991, Murphy and Cintas entered into a series of contracts to rent uniforms.\nInitially, Cintas filed suit against Murphy alleging that he had failed to pay in accordance with their\nagreements which resulted in $8,724.59 in damages. As exhibits to its petition, Cintas attached the\ncontracts, the invoices and Cintas's affidavit stating that the claim against Murphy was just and\ntrue, that it was due, and that all just and lawful credit had been allowed. TEX.R.CIV.P. 185.\n\nMurphy answered by an unsworn denial, but alleged that Cintas “fail[ed] to furnish clean, high\nquality garments and fail[ed] to replace torn, damaged and worn garments when requested.”\nMurphy also alleged that Cintas was not entitled to recover liquidated damages because the\nliquidated damage provision was an unenforceable penalty. After a non-jury hearing, the court\nrendered judgment in favor of Cintas. Neither party requested findings of fact and conclusions\nof law.\n\nIn points one, two, three, four, five, six and eight, Murphy challenges the legal sufficiency of the\nevidence to support the court's award of liquidated damages. According to Murphy, the record\nis void of any evidence regarding the amount of monetary loss that Cintas actually suffered as a\nresult of the breach or the reasonableness of the liquidated damage provision. He also argues that\nthe record is void of any evidence that the amount of liquidated damages was a reasonable forecast\nof just compensation. Therefore, Murphy concludes that the court erred when it awarded damages\nin accordance with the liquidated damage provision of the contract rather than awarding damages\nin accordance with common law contract law. We do not agree.\n\n [1] [2] [3] When findings and conclusions are neither requested nor filed, the trial court is\npresumed to have made all of the findings necessary to support its judgment. Roberson v. Robinson,\n768 S.W.2d 280, 281 (Tex.1989). All questions of fact are presumed found in support of the\njudgment and the judgment will be upheld on any legal theory raised by the evidence. Point\nLookout West, Inc. v. Whorton, 742 S.W.2d 277, 278–79 (Tex.1987). Further, Murphy's points\nof error are “no evidence” points. In deciding a “no evidence” point, we must consider only the\nevidence and inferences tending to support the finding and disregard all evidence and inferences\nto the contrary. Davis v. City of San Antonio, 752 S.W.2d 518, 522 (Tex.1988).\n\n [4] [5] [6] [7] Here, we have a dispute between the parties about whether the court rendered\njudgment on a suit on sworn account or breach of contract. TEX.R.CIV.P. 185.

First Nat. Bank of Louisville, 704 S.W.2d 916, 917 (Tex.Civ.App.—Houston\n[14th Dist.] 1986, no writ). Had Cintas properly filed a suit on a sworn account in accordance\nwith Rule 185, and Murphy had failed to file a written denial under oath, Murphy could not have\ndenied Cintas's claim, he could not have disputed that he received the services, and he could not\nhave disputed the correctness of the stated charges. Vance v. Holloway, 689 S.W.2d 403, 404\n(Tex.1985); Airborne Freight Corp. v. CRB Marketing, Inc., 566 S.W.2d 573, 575 (Tex.1978).\nHowever, a lawsuit involving a breach of a lease agreement is not a valid claim on sworn account\nbecause a lease agreement does not involve a purchase and sale, and title to personal property\nhas not passed from one party to another. Id. Thus, we hold that Cintas's cause of action against\nMurphy is not a suit on sworn account as a matter of law. Id.\n\n [8] [9] Having determined that the court rendered judgment in favor of Cintas under a breach of\ncontract, we will determine whether there is any evidence to support the damage award. Murphy\nargues that, because Cintas did not offer proof of its actual damages, there was no evidence in\nthe record to show that the liquidated damage provision in the contract was reasonable. As an\naffirmative defense to Cintas's claim for liquidated damages, Murphy pled penalty. TEX.R.CIV.P.\n94; *666 Phillips v. Phillips, 820 S.W.2d 785, 789 (Tex.1991). In doing so, Murphy not Cintas\nhad the burden to prove that the liquidated damage provision was unreasonable and a penalty.\nGorman v. Life Ins. Co. of North America, 811 S.W.2d 542, 546 (Tex.1991). Murphy did not offer\nany evidence to prove the amount of Cintas' actual damages. Accordingly, points one, two, three,\nfour, five, six and eight are overruled.\n\n[10] In his seventh point, Murphy contends that the court erred when it awarded Cintas liquidated\ndamages because the contractual provision was, as a matter of law, an unenforceable penalty. The\ndisputed liquidated damage clause stated:\n\n            In the event of cancellation of this service agreement by the Customer prior to\n            the termination date, other than for failure of the Company to perform under its\n            guarantee, the Customer will pay the greater of 50% of the weekly service charge\n            per person per week for the unexpired term, or buy back all of the garments in\n            inventory at the rates listed above as replacement value.\n\nCiting Servisco v. Tramco Inc., 568 S.W.2d 434, 437 (Tex.App—Texarkana 1978, writ ref'd n.r.e);\nMayfield v. Hicks, 575 S.W.2d 571, 575 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1978, writ ref'd n.r.e.) and Bethel v.\nButler Drilling Co., 635 S.W.2d 834, 837 (Tex.App.—Houston 1982, writ ref'd n.r.e), Murphy\nargues that a contract provision is a penalty and is unenforceable if it provides for unreasonable\npayments for a minor breach. In Servisco, the court held that “a sum stipulated to be paid under an\nagreement should be treated as an unenforceable penalty if the agreement contains several matters\nof different degrees of importance and the sum stipulated is payable for the breach of any, even the\nleast.” Murphy argues that, under the language of the Cintas–Murphy agreement, Murphy could\nhave been liable for the same amount of damages whether he breached the agreement by failing to\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  3\n\fMurphy v. Cintas Corp., 923 S.W.2d 663 (1996)\n\n\n\npay the rental for all of the uniforms, by failing to pay for one shirt or by violating any of the other\nobligations contained in the contract. Murphy also contends that the harm caused by the breach\nmust not be capable of estimation or difficult to estimate to be an enforceable liquidated damage\nstipulation. Because employees of Cintas testified that documentation of the actual damage that\nCintas incurred as a result of the breach were available at the time of trial, Murphy concludes that\nCintas admitted that the liquidated damage provision was unenforceable.\n\nIn Stewart v. Basey, the Supreme Court considered the difference between an enforceable\nliquidated damage provision and an unenforceable penalty. Stewart v. Basey, 150 Tex. 666, 245\nS.W.2d 484 (1952). More recently, the courts have restated this two-part Stewart test when\nanalyzing the validity of a contractual damages provision:\n\n  In order to enforce a liquidated damage clause, the court must find:\n\n  (1) that the harm caused by the breach is incapable or difficult of estimation; and\n\n  (2) that the amount of liquidated damages called for is a reasonable forecast of just\n     compensation.\n\nPhillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788. For the provision to be an unenforceable penalty, the uncertainty of the\ndamages and the reasonableness of the stipulation must have existed at the time when the contract\nwas executed. Oetting v. Flake Uniform & Linen Service, 553 S.W.2d 793, 796 (Tex.Civ.App.—\nFt. Worth 1977, no writ). Even though Murphy contends that the actual damage incurred by Cintas\ncould have been calculated at the time of trial, such testimony was long after the contract between\nCintas and Murphy had been executed. To forecast the actual damages to Cintas as a result of\nMurphy's termination of the contract sixty months in advance would be fraught with uncertainty.\nFurther, similar contracts for liquidated damages have been approved in Liberty Sign Co. v.\nNewsom, 426 S.W.2d 210 (Tex.1968); Blakeway v. National Credit Corporation, 439 S.W.2d 155\n(Tex.Civ.App.—Austin 1969, writ ref'd n.r.e.); Blakeway v. General Electric Credit Corporation,\n429 S.W.2d 925 (Tex.Civ.App.—Austin 1968, writ ref'd n.r.e.); Hyde v. Claude Neon Federal Co.,\n157 S.W.2d 952 (Tex.Civ.App.—Eastland 1941, writ dism'd); White v. Wilbanks, 144 S.W.2d 941\n(Tex.Civ.App.—Amarillo 1940, no writ). Accordingly, we hold that the liquidated *667 damage\nclause is enforceable. Point seven is overruled.\n\n [11] In his last point of error, Murphy contends that the court erred when it refused to set aside\nthe judgment and render a take-nothing judgment in his favor. However, he failed to cite any\nauthority to support his position. Under Rule 74(f), Murphy's point is not preserved for our review.\nTEX.R.APP.P. 74(f); Tobias v. Univ. of Texas at Arlington, 824 S.W.2d 201, 206–07 (Tex.App.\n—Fort Worth 1991, writ denied).\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Cintas Corp., 923 S.W.2d 663 (1996)\n\n\n\n [12] In one cross-point, Cintas contends that the court erred when it allowed Murphy to file a trial\namendment after the case had been heard by the court. According to Cintas, Murphy had failed to\nplead the defense of penalty to the contract action under Rule 94 until after both parties had closed\nand the court had taken the case under advisement. TEX.R.CIV.P. 94. However, the only answer\nin the transcript is Defendant's Second Amended Original Answer. The record before us does\nnot contain any of the answers that precede Murphy's last amended answer, from which Cintas\ncomplains. Accordingly, we cannot determine from the record to what extent Murphy amended\nhis prior pleadings. To complain of error on appeal, it is incumbent upon the complaining party\nto submit evidence in the record to support his claim. TEX.R.APP.P. 50(d).

Gray, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n2008 WL 2521967, 27 IER Cases 1872\n\nNexstar asserts eight issues for appellate review. KTBS raises a cross-point attacking the\nsufficiency of the evidence to support the jury's finding of $2,000 in damages. SeeTEX.R. CIV.\nP. 324(c). We reverse the trial court's judgment. The cause is remanded for a new trial.\n\n\n\n                                               BACKGROUND\n\nGray was originally hired by Nexstar as a reporter in 2003 and signed an employment contract. In\n2004, Gray signed another contract with Nexstar as an on-air performer for a term of employment\nfrom April 11, 2004, to May 31, 2006. The contract contained a provision titled “Remedies and\nProcedure for Remedying Disputes,” which stated:\n\n            In the event Employee elects to breach this Agreement and leave employment\n            prior to the conclusion of the term, the Company may accept as liquidated\n            damages for said breach the amount of $10,000. In the event the Company\n            determines that the liquidated damages amount described above is insufficient\n            to cover all of its damages, the Company may seek to obtain additional\n            compensatory and consequential damages by pursuing an action under\n            paragraph 7(a) herein.\n\nIn February 2005, Gray gave notice that she would be resigning from her position. Nexstar sent\nher a letter reminding her of her continuing obligations under the contract. The letter informed\nGray she would have to pay $10,000 if she left her employment. Nexstar learned that KTBS was\ninterested in hiring Gray and sent KTBS a letter stating that Gray was still under contract.\n\nGray stopped appearing as an on-air performer for Nexstar in March 2005. Within two weeks of\nGray's departure, she began working for KTBS.\n\n\n\n                THE DECLARATORY JUDGMENT AND ATTORNEY'S FEES\n\nNexstar's lawsuit against Gray sought “liquidated damages from Gray and/or all actual and\nconsequential damages proximately caused by her breach of contract.”Gray filed a counterclaim\nseeking a declaratory judgment that the liquidated damages provision in the contract was an\nunenforceable penalty as a matter of law.\n\nThe trial court found that the liquidated damages provision in the employment contract was an\nunenforceable penalty. The jury awarded Nexstar $1.00 in nominal damages from Gray for the\nbreach of contract. Nexstar and Gray stipulated to the amount of reasonable attorney's fees, but\nnot to entitlement to attorney's fees. The trial court awarded Gray attorney's fees.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.             2\n\fNexstar Broadcasting, Inc. v. Gray, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n2008 WL 2521967, 27 IER Cases 1872\n\n\n\n *2 In issue one, Nexstar argues the trial court erred in granting the declaratory judgment, because\nGray had simply re-asserted an affirmative defense as a request for declaratory judgment. In issue\nsix, Nexstar contends the trial court erred in awarding Gray attorney's fees because Gray asserted\nthe declaratory judgment counterclaim merely to recover attorney's fees that were otherwise not\nrecoverable.\n\nThe purpose of the Declaratory Judgments Act is to “settle and to afford relief from uncertainty\nand insecurity with respect to rights, status, and other legal relations[.]”TEX. CIV. PRAC. &\nREM.CODE ANN. § 37.002(b) (Vernon 1997). A declaratory judgment is appropriate only if\nthere is a justiciable controversy and the declaration sought will resolve the controversy. Bonham\nState Bank v. Beadle, 907 S.W.2d 465, 467 (Tex.1995). The Act is not available to settle disputes\nalready pending before the court.BHP Petroleum Co. v. Millard, 800 S.W.2d 838, 841 (Tex.1990).\n\nA trial court may allow a counterclaim seeking a declaratory judgment if it is more than a mere\ndenial of the plaintiff's cause of action and has greater ramifications than the original lawsuit.\nSee id. at 842.Generally, a counterclaim will have greater ramifications than the original claim\nif it would have the effect of settling future disputes between the parties. See, e.g., id.(allowing\ndeclaratory judgment counterclaim that defined the parties' obligations under an ongoing contract\nfor the foreseeable future); Winslow v. Acker, 781 S.W.2d 322, 328 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 1989,\nwrit denied) (holding trial court did not err in allowing declaratory judgment counterclaim that\nwould settle all future disputes regarding royalties under deed). The counterclaim must seek\naffirmative relief and allege that the defendant has a cause of action, independent of the plaintiff's\nclaim, on which the defendant could recover benefits, compensation, or relief. Millard, 800 S.W.2d\nat 841; HECI Exploration Co. v. Clajon Gas Co., 843 S.W.2d 622, 638-39 (Tex.App.-Austin\n1992, writ denied). A counterclaim that presents no new controversy may not be asserted simply\nto recover attorney's fees. Hitchcock Props. Inc. v. Levering, 776 S.W.2d 236, 239 (Tex.App.-\nHouston [1st Dist.] 1989, writ denied).\n\nGray sought a declaration that the remedies provision in the contract was an unenforceable penalty\nand void as a matter of law. This requested declaration is essentially a restatement of the “penalty”\naffirmative defense asserted in Gray's answer. See Phillips v. Phillips, 820 S.W.2d 785, 789\n(Tex.1991) (noting that “penalty” is an affirmative defense to an award of damages under a\nliquidated damages provision). She sought no greater relief in her counterclaim than she asserted in\nher affirmative defense; Gray denied Nexstar's entitlement to liquidated damages. See Millard, 800\nS.W.2d at 842. Gray and Nexstar have no ongoing relationship. See HECI Exploration Co., 843\nS.W.2d at 639. Gray's declaratory judgment counterclaim presented no new controversy. Under\nthe circumstances, the award of attorney's fees to Gray under the Declaratory Judgments Act was\nunauthorized. See Hitchcock Props., 776 S.W.2d at 239.

Nexstar argues that liquidated damages are appropriate because damages\nwere difficult or incapable of estimation at the time the contract was signed, and $10,000 was a\nreasonable forecast of just compensation.\n\n“Whether a contractual provision is an enforceable liquidated damages provision or an\nunenforceable penalty is a question of law[.]”Phillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788. A liquidated damages\nprovision may be enforceable if the harm caused by the breach is difficult to estimate and the\namount of liquidated damages is a reasonable forecast of just compensation. Id. Evidence that the\nharm caused is difficult to estimate, and that the amount of liquidated damages is a reasonable\nforecast, must be viewed as of the time the parties executed the contract. Baker v. Int'l Record\nSyndicate, Inc., 812 S.W.2d 53, 55 (Tex.App.-Dallas 1991, no writ).\n\nGenerally, a contractual provision that does not exclude further liability for actual damages is not\na reasonable forecast of just compensation and is an unenforceable penalty. Robert G. Beneke &\nCo., v. Cole, 550 S.W.2d 321, 322 (Tex.Civ.App.-Dallas 1977, no writ). The provision must make\nclear that the amount of liquidated damages will be in lieu of other damages. Birdwell v. Ferrell,\n746 S.W.2d 338, 340 (Tex.App.-Austin 1988, no writ).\n\nThe provision in this case provided for $10,000 as liquidated damages, but also stated that\n“[i]n the event the Company determines that the liquidated damages amount described above is\ninsufficient to cover all of its damages, the Company may seek to obtain additional compensatory\nand consequential damages by pursuing an action under paragraph 7(a) herein.”This provision\ndoes not limit Nexstar's recovery to liquidated damages or make clear that liquidated damages will\nbe recovered in lieu of actual damages; under the provision, Nexstar could claim the “liquidated”\ndamages and then claim any additional damages by taking the dispute to an arbitrator under\nparagraph 7(a). The trial court did not err in failing to award $10,000 as “liquidated” damages.\nIssue two is overruled.\n\n\n\n                                            ACTUAL DAMAGES\n\nIn issue three, Nexstar asserts the evidence conclusively established that Nexstar suffered damages\nin excess of the $1 awarded by the jury. Nexstar argues it provided undisputed evidence that it\nincurred $14,615.49 in actual damages; we understand Nexstar to argue in issue three that it proved\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In the alternative, Nexstar argues in issue four that the\njury's finding of $1 in actual damages is against the overwhelming weight of the evidence.\n\nIn issue eight, Nexstar argues the trial court erred in disregarding the jury's finding on damages\nagainst KTBS for tortious interference with the contract. A judgment notwithstanding the verdict\nis proper when no evidence supports the jury's finding. Mancorp, Inc. v. Culpepper, 802 S.W.2d\n226, 227 (Tex.1990). Nexstar contends the evidence supported a finding of at least $2,000 in\ndamages, the amount found by the jury. KTBS argues by cross-point that the $2,000 finding is\nunsupported by the evidence.\n\n *4 A party attacking the legal sufficiency of evidence concerning an adverse finding on an issue\non which it has the burden of proof must demonstrate that the evidence conclusively established\nall vital facts in support of the issue. Dow Chem. Co. v. Francis, 46 S.W.3d 237, 241 (Tex.2001).\nIf the proposition contrary to the verdict is established as a matter of law, an appellate court must\nrender judgment for that proposition.Id.\n\nIn a factual sufficiency review, the appellate court considers and weighs all of the evidence and\nwill set aside a verdict only if the evidence is so weak or if the finding is so against the great weight\nand preponderance of the evidence that it is clearly wrong and unjust. Id.\n\nNexstar points out the jury instructions on damages for interference with the contract and breach\nof the contract were the same: “out of pocket” damages. The jury found $2,000 in “out of pocket”\ndamages resulted from the interference with contract, but $1 in damages resulted from the breach\nof contract. Nexstar argued in a post-judgment pleading that it was entitled to contract damages,\nat the least, in “the same $2,000 awarded against Defendant KTBS.” In its claim against Gray,\nNexstar argues on appeal “it is clear that the jury improperly failed to consider the undisputed\nevidence regarding Nexstar being ‘out of pocket’ $2,000 for the speech pathologist/talent coach\nbecause it found Nexstar was ‘out of pocket’ this amount in its answer to the damages question\nagainst KTBS.” 2\n\nNexstar also contends it paid $7,000 to promote a new morning show format that featured Gray\nas a meteorologist. The news director testified regarding this expense as follows:\n\n   [Plaintiff's Counsel]: And how much was that total cost?\n\n   [News Director]: I need to look. I'm not positive off the top of my head.\n\n   [Q]: Well, just give me your best estimate.\n\n   [A]: I believe it ran about $7,000.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Gray, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n2008 WL 2521967, 27 IER Cases 1872\n\n\n   [Q]: Okay.\n\nNexstar did not show that it promoted the morning show format only because of Gray. At the time\nof trial, Nexstar still aired the morning show with the same format.\n\nNexstar also argues that it is entitled to the $146.31 in makeup expenses it paid to Gray. The\nemployment contract states that Gray would be reimbursed for makeup expenses for up to $50 per\nmonth. Nexstar presented two checks spent in makeup reimbursements: $73.61 paid in November\n2004; and $73.70 paid on April 20, 2004. KBTV's news director testified that Gray used the\nmakeup while she worked for Nexstar. Nexstar would have paid these expenses even had Gray\nfully performed under the contract.\n\nNexstar asserts that it reimbursed Gray $3,110.07 for her meteorology school tuition. Gray\nacknowledged that Nexstar paid for her to attend meteorology school. KBTV's news director\ntestified that Nexstar did not normally pay for meteorology school but agreed to pay Gray's tuition\nbecause she had “great potential.” The trial court admitted into evidence the checks issued by\nNexstar for Gray's tuition: $1,431.50 paid on January 16, 2004; $1,194.07 paid on June 1, 2004;\nand $484.50 paid on July 28, 2004. The last two tuition checks, for $1,194.07 and $484.50, were\npaid during the term of employment under the March 2004 contract. However, Nexstar was not\nrequired to reimburse Gray for her meteorology school tuition expenses under the March 2004\ncontract.\n\n *5 Nexstar argues that it paid $2,000 to a speech pathologist, or talent coach, who provided Gray\nwith voice training. The talent coach trained all of the on-air performers. KBTV's news director\nwould set a day planner for the coach and would allocate how much time each individual would\nspend with the coach. The time an individual would spend with the coach varied according to how\nlong the individual worked with the station and how much potential they had. KBTV's general\nmanager testified that when Gray first started working with the station, the coach spent more time\nwith Gray to improve her voice. However, Nexstar did not present evidence showing how much\ntime Gray spent with the coach, nor did it segregate Gray's time with the coach from the time the\nother on-air performers trained with the coach. The record does not show whether the training\noccurred when Gray was first hired under the original contract, or during the term of the second\ncontract.\n\nFinally, Nexstar also contends it incurred costs in hiring Gray's replacement and paid for an\non-air performer to fill in for Gray. While Nexstar sought candidates to replace Gray, Gray's\nmeteorology duties were covered by the station's chief and weekend meteorologists. Nexstar paid\nGray's meteorology replacement $191.30 in traveling expenses, $750 in moving expenses, and\n$607.81 for a plane ticket.

The measure of damages under the interference with contract claim is the\nsame as that under the breach of contract claim in this case. See Am. Nat'l Petroleum Co. & Oil\nInvs., Ltd. v. Transcon. Gas Pipe Line Corp., 798 S.W.2d 274, 278 (Tex.1990).\n\nThe trial judge found no evidence to support the $2,000 damage finding and signed a judgment\nnotwithstanding the verdict. There is legally sufficient evidence in this record of some damages,\nhowever. Though this record may not support an award of all of the costs of finding a replacement,\nthe jury could reasonably conclude some of the costs incurred in covering Gray's job duties, hiring\na freelance reporter, and finding a replacement on short notice could have been avoided if KTBS\nhad not interfered with the contract. See Guevara v. Ferrer, 247 S.W.3d 662, 670 (Tex.2007)\n(“[W]hen there is evidence to support some damages it is not appropriate to render judgment.”).\nBut the jury made conflicting jury findings on conflicting evidence concerning the same material\nfact. The jury also found the same evidence did not support more than $1 in damages for the breach\nof contract. On this record, a coherent judgment cannot be rendered. A new trial is required. 3\n\n\n\n                                                        CONCLUSION\n\n*6 The trial court's judgment is reversed.

We will vacate the trial court's judgment and dismiss the cause for lack of a\njusticiable controversy.\n\n\n\n                        FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe Texas IOLTA program, like similar programs instituted in almost every other state, was\nestablished to raise money to provide legal assistance to low-income Texans. The “Rules\nGoverning the Operation of the Texas Equal Access to Justice Program” oblige attorneys to\nparticipate, subject to suspension of their law licenses. See Tex.R. Equal Access to Justice Prog.\n24 (State Bar Rules art. 11). When an attorney holds client funds, the money should ordinarily\nbe deposited into a trust account to earn interest for the client. But where the amount held is\nnominal, such that it could not be expected to earn enough interest to offset the cost of maintaining\na separate trust account, the funds are required to be deposited into an IOLTA account. See Tex.R.\nEqual Access to Justice Prog. 4, 6. The IOLTA account pools all such deposits from the attorney;\ncollectively, the sums generate interest where no individual deposit could. The interest is then paid\nto the Foundation, which distributes the interest received from all IOLTA accounts in Texas to\nlow-income legal services. See Tex.R. Equal Access to Justice Prog. 4, 10.\n\nA constitutional takings challenge to Texas's IOLTA program was brought in Phillips v.\nWashington Legal Foundation, which resulted in a 1998 United States Supreme Court decision\nholding that interest *44 earned on an IOLTA account is the private property of the clients of the\nattorney who established the account. 524 U.S. 156, 172, 118 S.Ct. 1925, 141 L.Ed.2d 174 (1998).\nThat case is now on remand to the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas\nfor further proceedings to determine whether those funds have been “taken” by the state without\njust compensation. While Phillips did not decide the ultimate issue of whether compliance with\nthe IOLTA program effectuates a governmental taking of client property, it is fair to say that the\nconstitutionality of the program is uncertain in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision. It is that\nuncertainty that appellants hope to resolve in this action.\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                      2\n\fPaulsen v. Texas Equal Access to Justice Foundation, 23 S.W.3d 42 (1999)\n\n\n\nThe Phillips decision left many questions unanswered, in part because of the procedural framework\nin which the case was brought. That case was an appeal from the trial court's grant of summary\njudgment and so arrived before the Supreme Court without the benefit of discovery. Since the\nrecord was essentially devoid of details, the Phillips decision made no reference to banking law\nor the particulars of an IOLTA contract between an attorney and bank. The Phillips decision\ntherefore makes no reference to the distinction recognized in Texas banking law between “general”\nand “special” accounts; this distinction, appellants assert, would have led to a different ruling.\nAppellants urge us to clarify what they characterize as the Supreme Court's misstatement of Texas\nlaw and to hold that both the principal and the interest earned on “general” accounts—and IOLTA\naccounts are apparently all “general”—are the property of the bank and not the client. Since the\ninterest earned is bank property, appellants argue, there is no unconstitutional taking involved\nwhen the bank pays that interest to the Foundation.\n\nAll parties to this suit agree on the constitutionality of IOLTA. Appellant Paulsen is an attorney\nwho has received a $1,000 retainer from a client and claims uncertainty as to his rights and\nobligations with respect to this money. The Equal Access to Justice Rules require him to deposit\nthe $1,000 in an IOLTA account or risk suspension of his license to practice law, yet he claims\nthe Phillips decision exposes him to liability to his client for breach of fiduciary duties if he does\ndeposit the funds. Bankers are the principal trade organizations for Texas financial institutions.\nThey claim that the contracts signed by their members and attorneys establishing IOLTA accounts\nare brought into question by the Phillips decision. While the banks are contractually obligated to\npay IOLTA interest to the Foundation, they also fear liability from threatened lawsuits should they\ncontinue to participate in the IOLTA program.\n\nAppellee, the Foundation, does not disagree with appellants as to the constitutionality of the\nIOLTA program. In fact, the Foundation has vigorously defended the IOLTA program as a\ndefendant in the ongoing Phillips litigation. It apparently disagrees with appellants only as to\nhow far this Court should go in deciding the ultimate constitutional issues involved. This lack of\nadversarial debate between the parties was noted in an amicus brief tendered by David Furlow, an\nattorney who disputes the constitutionality of the IOLTA program.\n\n\n\n                                                DISCUSSION\n\n [1] The Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act gives courts the power to “declare rights, status,\nand other legal relations whether or not further relief is or could be claimed.” Tex. Civ. Prac.\n& Rem.Code Ann. § 37.003 (West 1997). The determination of jurisdiction over a declaratory\njudgment action is a question of law and so is subject to de novo review. See Texas Dep't of Pub.\nSafety v. Moore, 985 S.W.2d 149, 153 (Tex.App.—Austin 1998, no pet.).\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Texas Equal Access to Justice Foundation, 23 S.W.3d 42 (1999)\n\n\n\n [2] [3] An action for declaratory relief is subject to the same jurisdictional requirements *45 as\nany other action brought in our courts. “Subject matter jurisdiction requires that the party bringing\nthe suit have standing, that there be a live controversy between the parties, and that the case be\njusticiable.” State Bar of Tex. v. Gomez, 891 S.W.2d 243, 245 (Tex.1994) (plurality opinion)\n(citing Texas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440, 443–46 (Tex.1993)).\nThe parties before us cannot satisfy these threshold jurisdictional requirements. Because the trial\ncourt lacked subject matter jurisdiction over this case, we will vacate that court's judgment and\ndismiss the cause.\n\n\nAppellant Paulsen\n [4] Paulsen seeks declaratory judgment because, by refusing to deposit a $1,000 client retainer\nin his IOLTA account, he claims he faces the imminent suspension of his law license. It is not\nat all clear from the record that the suspension of Paulsen's license is inevitable or imminent.\nIn a post-submission brief, however, Paulsen attached a letter he received from the Foundation\ninforming him that disciplinary action will be initiated if he does not comply with IOLTA rules.\nAssuming without deciding that we can consider this letter, and further assuming that the letter\nconfers standing on Paulsen, we nonetheless conclude that his suit must be dismissed for want of\njurisdiction, for he has not demonstrated any justiciable controversy with his putative opponent\nin this case.\n\nThe crux of the claimed dispute between Paulsen and the Foundation lies in the interpretation\nof the Supreme Court's Phillips decision. Paulsen argues that if we accept as a correct statement\nof Texas law the Phillips holding that interest earned in IOLTA accounts is client property, 1\nthen the decision places him in an ethical quandary. If he continues to participate in the IOLTA\nprogram, Paulsen believes he breaches his ethical duty to his client when he contracts with his\nbank to turn IOLTA interest over to the Foundation. On the other hand, if he does not give the\ninterest to the Foundation, he breaches professional ethics rules and stands to lose his law license.\nThe Foundation disagrees with Paulsen only as to whether Phillips creates ethical uncertainty. It\nbelieves that Phillips answered only the question of whether a client could ever have a property\nright in interest that would not exist without the IOLTA program; the Foundation believes Phillips\ndid not establish conclusively that IOLTA interest is always client property. That question will\nbe decided by the federal district court on remand. This dispute, then, centers on how broadly\nPhillips can be read.\n\n [5] What is troubling about this appeal is that the parties all believe that an attorney can ethically\nparticipate in the Texas IOLTA program. Paulsen merely claims that someone else might construe\nPhillips differently, and that such an alternate interpretation would put him in an ethical bind.\nWith no true opponent in the Foundation, what Paulsen seeks, in essence, is an advisory opinion\ninterpreting a decision from the Supreme Court to resolve his doubts about the IOLTA program.\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Texas Equal Access to Justice Foundation, 23 S.W.3d 42 (1999)\n\n\n\nBut, of course, the separation of powers doctrine prevents us from complying with this request.\nNeither the legislature nor the constitution has vested us with the authority to render an advisory\nopinion. See Tex. Const. art. II, § 1; Olson v. Commission for Lawyer Discipline, 901 S.W.2d 520,\n522 (Tex.App.—El Paso 1995, no writ). We therefore hold that Paulsen has presented *46 no\njusticiable controversy between himself and the Foundation.\n\n\nAppellant Bankers\n[6] Bankers claim to have standing in this declaratory relief action because they are faced with\nuncertainty and insecurity in their performance of current contracts with the Foundation. 2 The\nUniform Declaratory Judgments Act specifically provides that “a contract may be construed either\nbefore or after there has been a breach.” Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. § 37.004(b) (West\n1997); see also In re City of Dallas, 977 S.W.2d 798, 804 (Tex.App.—Fort Worth 1998, no pet.);\nHasty Inc. v. Inwood Buckhorn Joint Venture, 908 S.W.2d 494, 499 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1995, writ\ndenied). Section 37.004 does not, however, extend an open-ended invitation to parties seeking\ninterpretation of their contracts. There must be some showing that litigation is imminent between\nthe parties unless the contractual uncertainties are judicially resolved. See Reuter v. Cordes–\nHendreks Coiffures, Inc., 422 S.W.2d 193, 196 (Tex.Civ.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1967, no\nwrit).\n\n[7] Bankers have not demonstrated any imminent contractual dispute with the Foundation. As\nprimary proof of their grounds for uncertainty, Bankers cite a letter from Michael Mazzone 3 to\nappellant banking groups warning that the banks could face liability for the tort of conversion\nfor any interest paid by them to the Foundation after the Phillips decision. In the letter, Mazzone\nominously warned that he has “personal knowledge that there are lawyers who are planning a class\naction lawsuit against a number of banks.”\n\nMazzone's letter is insufficient to support an action for declaratory judgment. It amounts to a\nthreat from a stranger to this action who refers to unnamed sources who may be contemplating a\nlawsuit at some point in the future. Bankers' feared liability to theoretical litigants is simply too\nremote to support a claim for declaratory relief. Further, it does not appear that the litigation the\nBankers fear would even involve the Foundation. Mazzone's letter warned banks that they could\nbe liable for the tort of conversion if they continue to pay IOLTA interest to the Foundation. In\nthat event, any liability for conversion would be to the clients of the depositing attorneys and not\nto the Foundation.\n\nBankers, as evidenced by their briefs, strongly believe that IOLTA is constitutional and apparently\nintend to honor their contracts establishing IOLTA accounts unless and until a court declares the\nIOLTA program unconstitutional. Even assuming that the Foundation would have standing to\nprotect its right as third-party beneficiary to the interest earned on IOLTA accounts, there is no\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Texas Equal Access to Justice Foundation, 23 S.W.3d 42 (1999)\n\n\n\njusticiable controversy where, as here, there is an absence of any real threat or intention to breach\na contract. See id. (citing Spradley v. Whitehall, 314 S.W.2d 615, 619 (Tex.Civ.App.—Fort Worth\n1958, no writ)). The trial court, therefore, lacked jurisdiction to grant the relief sought by Bankers.\n\n\nTrue Controversy\nThe only issue on which the parties to this case seem to disagree is how broadly Phillips should\nbe read. Appellants paint a doomsday picture that throws all banking practices into uncertainty\nunless we hold that the Supreme Court misstated Texas law, grant declaratory relief reiterating\nthe distinction between “general” and “special” accounts, and explicitly hold that IOLTA is\nconstitutional. Appellants assert in the alternative that if, despite their arguments to the contrary,\nwe believe Phillips is correct, we should hold IOLTA expressly unconstitutional. The Foundation\nthinks the Phillips holding is *47 more narrow than appellants read it; they have no qualms with a\ndeclaration from this Court that IOLTA is constitutional, but they urge us to refrain from deciding\nIOLTA is unconstitutional on the strength of the Phillips decision. They otherwise have no dispute\nwith appellants' position and encourage us to grant the declaratory relief sought.\n\n [8] We must not decide a case that amounts to no more than a disagreement on how broadly the\nPhillips decision can be read. “A mere difference of opinion, not involving the assertion of adverse\ninterests, is not sufficient to support an action for declaratory judgment.” Reuter, 422 S.W.2d at 196\n(quoting 26 C.J.S. Declaratory Judgments, § 29 (1956)). In spite of the injuries and uncertainties\nappellants claim they will suffer, it seems they have no real dispute with the Foundation. This\ncase has been marked throughout by a near-total lack of true controversy between the parties. The\ntrial below was very brief. Paulsen was the only witness who testified, and cross-examination by\nthe Foundation's lawyer was perfunctory, consisting of only three questions to confirm that the\nPhillips court did not determine the ultimate constitutionality of the IOLTA program. On appeal,\nthe Foundation has not even raised the strongest reasons in support of the trial court's judgment—\nthose jurisdictional issues we have detailed above; indeed, appellee's brief is a mere seven pages\nlong. They are seven well-written and thoughtful pages, to be sure, but the brevity underscores\nthe lack of true controversy in this case.\n\nWhatever dispute appellants claim to have with the Foundation is clearly secondary to their\ndesire to have this Court effectively overrule the U.S. Supreme Court, declaring that the Court\nmisinterpreted Texas law in its Phillips ruling. Appellants' briefs focus almost exclusively on\nthe constitutionality of IOLTA, paying only minor attention to the claimed dispute with the\nFoundation.\n\nWe are not unsympathetic to appellants' arguments. The Phillips decision does appear to have at\nleast overlooked, if not misstated, a large body of Texas banking law that distinguishes between\n“general” and “special” accounts. See, e.g., Texas Commerce Bank v. Townsend, 786 S.W.2d 53\n(Tex.App.—Austin 1990, writ denied). In a general account, Texas law is clear that the financial\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                     6\n\fPaulsen v. Texas Equal Access to Justice Foundation, 23 S.W.3d 42 (1999)\n\n\n\ninstitution holds title to the funds deposited. See id. at 54. Paulsen's contract with his bank\nestablishing an IOLTA account expressly states that it is a general account. Since the Phillips\ncourt stated that “interest follows principal,” Phillips, 524 U.S. at 165–66, 118 S.Ct. 1925, the\nnatural conclusion would be that the interest earned in an IOLTA account belongs to the banks as\nwell. This appears to be in direct conflict with the actual Phillips holding that interest earned in\nan IOLTA account is the property of the attorney's client. See id. at 172, 118 S.Ct. 1925.\n\nWhatever our impressions of the constitutional arguments in support of IOLTA, however,\nthis particular case provides a singularly inappropriate context for deciding those issues. Both\nappellants and the Foundation are committed to upholding the constitutionality of the IOLTA\nprogram. In its brief the Foundation candidly admits that it does not contest the central legal\npremises of appellants' argument, and emphasizes that the Foundation is making the same pro-\nIOLTA arguments in the ongoing Phillips litigation in the federal district court.\n\nIn their arguments, the parties attempt to demonstrate that they are not in unanimous agreement\non how far this Court might go if we were to agree with the Supreme Court, but neither side ever\nseriously argues that IOLTA could be anything but constitutional. The hair-splitting difference\nbetween the parties' positions hardly presents the sort of robust debate a court should expect\nand demand when a major constitutional ruling is at issue. At core, both appellants and the\nFoundation *48 are in total agreement that IOLTA should be declared constitutional. It would be\ninappropriate for us to decide an issue of such gravity where there has been no genuine debate. In\nfact, the Supreme Court has expressly held that where both litigants agree on the constitutionality\nof a statute being challenged and desire the same result, there is no case or controversy before\nthe court. See Moore v. Charlotte–Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S. 47, 48, 91 S.Ct. 1292, 28\nL.Ed.2d 590 (1971).\n\nTruly, the appropriate forum for deciding the issues at the heart of this appeal is in the federal\ndistrict court, where the Phillips litigation is now pending on remand and the court is faced squarely\nwith the constitutionality of IOLTA. If the facts of this case were altered only slightly, we would\nbe required to defer to that court's proceeding, for there is a wide body of law that would prevent\nus from deciding this declaratory judgment action if another action were pending between the\nsame parties which would adjudicate the issues involved in the present action. See Texas Liquor\nControl Bd. v. Canyon Creek Land Corp., 456 S.W.2d 891, 895 (Tex.1970); Tucker v. Graham,\n878 S.W.2d 681, 683 (Tex.App.—Eastland 1994, no writ); Southern Traffic Bureau v.

Because the parties\nbefore us are not identical to those involved in the Phillips litigation, that doctrine cannot squarely\ndispose of this case. 4 The parties before us could, however, have intervened in the Phillips suit\nand presented their constitutional arguments in a more direct fashion to the district court. That\ncase has been hotly contested and is certain to involve a much fuller and more balanced debate\nthan has developed in the present cause. For that reason, the ongoing Phillips litigation would\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                     7\n\fPaulsen v. Texas Equal Access to Justice Foundation, 23 S.W.3d 42 (1999)\n\n\n\nbe a more appropriate forum for settling the question of whether the IOLTA program creates an\nunconstitutional taking of client property.\n\n\n\n                                                          CONCLUSION\n\nWe hold that appellants have not presented this Court or the trial court with a justiciable\ncontroversy. Paulsen seeks an advisory opinion from this Court interpreting a United States\nSupreme Court opinion. Bankers face no imminent litigation over their IOLTA contracts, and\ntheir claimed uncertainty as to their rights and obligations is insufficient to present the court with\na justiciable action. For these reasons, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the\naction presented; we therefore vacate that court's judgment and dismiss the cause.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    Of course, Paulsen does not really want us to accept this as true at all. He frames the issue in these terms to attempt to create a\n        justiciable controversy between himself and the Foundation. The real goal of the litigation is apparently to have this Court decide\n        that the U.S. Supreme Court was wrong in so holding, and that consequently IOLTA is constitutional under Texas law. We discuss\n        infra why the present case is an inappropriate one for deciding that issue.\n2       In an IOLTA contract, the Foundation is declared to be a third-party beneficiary to the contract between the financial institution and\n        the attorney who establishes the account.\n3       Mazzone is a named plaintiff in the Phillips litigation.\n\n4       Paulsen is not a party to the Phillips case, but he was involved in the case to the extent that he drafted the amicus curiae briefs\n        tendered to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals on behalf of the state bars of Texas, Mississippi, and Louisiana in support of IOLTA.\n        The Foundation is a party to the ongoing Phillips litigation, but Bankers are not.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                           © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Phillips, 820 S.W.2d 785 (1991)\n\n\n\nDuring 32 years of marriage, Harry and Martha Phillips accumulated over $18 million in\ncommunity property, primarily through the oil and gas business Harry managed. When they\ndivorced, rather than break up their oil and gas holdings, they created Phillips & Phillips, Ltd., a\nlimited partnership, and transferred the bulk of their assets to it. Each had an equal interest in the\npartnership. Harry, the only general partner, agreed to work for the partnership full-time without\nsalary and to offer Martha the option to participate in any business opportunities he pursued outside\nthe partnership. Martha, the only limited partner, agreed that she would have no right to participate\nin Harry's business decisions for the partnership and that she would leave each of her four children\nby Harry at least one-sixth of her estate.\n\nThe partnership agreement required Harry to pay himself and Martha each a minimum *787 of\n$21,000 per month for 24 months, and then minimum monthly distributions adjusted for inflation\nand for oil and gas prices. It also required Harry to furnish Martha certain financial information\nabout the partnership and to cooperate with her in auditing its affairs. The agreement contained\nthe following provision: “If the general partner breaches his trust hereunder, he shall pay to the\nlimited partner as liquidated damages ten times the amount she loses as a result of such breaches\nof trust. Errors of judgment shall not be considered breaches of trusts.”\n\nThe value of the partnership increased under Harry's management, but Harry did not fully comply\nwith the terms of the written agreement. In particular, after the first 20 months Harry distributed\nmuch less than the required minimum amounts, never actually calculating what payments the\nagreement required. He also failed to provide timely annual statements of operations and refused\nto cooperate fully with Martha's attempts to audit the partnership.\n\nMartha eventually sued Harry for dissolution of the partnership and damages based upon Harry's\nbreach of contractual and fiduciary duties. The case was tried to a jury, who found that Harry\nbreached the partnership agreement by favoring himself in paying his personal expenses and\nencumbering partnership assets, thus endangering partnership distributions. The jury also found\nthat Harry breached both the partnership agreement and his fiduciary duty to Martha by failing to\nkeep current and complete partnership books, failing to prepare required annual statements, and\ninterfering with Martha's efforts to examine partnership books and records. 1 The jury assessed\nMartha's actual damages at $300,000. None of the jury's findings are challenged by the parties\non appeal.\n\nDuring the trial the parties stipulated that a reasonable fee for legal services necessary for Martha's\nprosecution of the case was $235,302.14. The jury was aware of this stipulation, and the trial court\nsurmised that the jury included this amount in its $300,000 finding. Accordingly, the trial court\nrendered judgment for Martha for a total of $300,000, $235,302.14 against the partnership and\n$64,697.86 against Harry, and refused to award Martha any additional amount for attorney fees.\nThe trial court also ordered the partnership dissolved.\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   2\n\fPhillips v. Phillips, 820 S.W.2d 785 (1991)\n\n\n\n\nMartha appealed; Harry did not. The court of appeals held that the trial court erred in refusing to\naward Martha the $235,302.14 stipulated attorney fees in addition to the $300,000 damages found\nby the jury, but that the trial court did not err in refusing to award Martha decuple damages under\nthe partnership agreement. Consequently, the appeals court reversed the judgment of the trial court\nin part and rendered judgment against Harry for a total of $535,302.14, plus interest. 2\n\n *788 Martha contends that she is entitled to recover liquidated damages equal to ten times\nthe actual damages found by the jury, as provided by the limited partnership agreement. Harry\ncontends that the contractual provision is not an enforceable agreement for liquidated damages but\nan unenforceable penalty. Martha argues that even if Harry is correct, he has waived any defense\nof penalty by failing to plead it as an affirmative defense.\n\n [1] We first considered the difference between an enforceable liquidated damages provision and\nan unenforceable penalty in Stewart v. Basey, 150 Tex. 666, 245 S.W.2d 484, 485–486 (1952).\nThere we explained:\n\n   Volumes have been written on the question of when a stipulated damage provision of a contract\n   should be enforced as liquidated damages and when enforcement should be denied because it is\n   a penalty provision.... All agree that to be enforceable as liquidated damages the damages must\n   be uncertain and the stipulation must be reasonable.\n\n.....\n\n   The right of competent parties to make their own bargains is not unlimited. The universal rule\n   for measuring damages for the breach of a contract is just compensation for the loss or damage\n   actually sustained. By the operation of that rule a party generally should be awarded neither\n   less nor more than his actual damages. A party has no right to have a court enforce a stipulation\n   which violates the principle underlying that rule.\n\nMore recently, in Rio Grande Valley Sugar Growers, Inc. v. Campesi, 592 S.W.2d 340, 342 n. 2\n(Tex.1979), we restated the two-part Stewart test for determining whether to enforce a contractual\ndamages provision as follows: “In order to enforce a liquidated damage clause, the court must\nfind: (1) that the harm caused by the breach is incapable or difficult of estimation, and (2) that\nthe amount of liquidated damages called for is a reasonable forecast of just compensation.” Cf.\nTEX.BUS. & COM.CODE § 2.718(a). 3\n\n[2] Whether a contractual provision is an enforceable liquidated damages provision or an\nunenforceable penalty is a question of law for the court to decide. Farrar v. Beeman, 63 Tex. 175,\n181 (1885); see Lefevere v. Sears, 629 S.W.2d 768, 771 (Tex.Civ.App.—El Paso 1981, no writ);\nMuller v.

Phillips, 820 S.W.2d 785 (1991)\n\n\n\nv. American Dist. Telegraph Co., 286 S.W.2d 684, 690 (Tex.Civ.App.—Dallas 1955, no writ);\nZucht v. Stewart Title Guar. Co., 207 S.W.2d 414, 418 (Tex.Civ.App.—San Antonio 1947, writ\ndism'd); Bourland v. Huffhines, 244 S.W. 847, 849 (Tex.Civ.App.—Amarillo 1922, writ dism'd).\nSometimes, however, factual issues must be resolved before the legal question can be decided. For\nexample, to show that a liquidated damages provision is unreasonable because the actual damages\nincurred were much less than the amount contracted for, a defendant may be required to prove\nwhat the actual damages were. See Johnson Eng'rs, Inc. v. Tri–Water Supply Corp., 582 S.W.2d\n555, 557 (Tex.Civ.App.—Texarkana 1979, no writ); Oetting v. Flake Uniform & Linen Serv.,\nInc., 553 S.W.2d 793, 796–797 (Tex.Civ.App.—Fort Worth 1977, no writ); *789 Smith v.

Methodist\nEpiscopal Church, 212 S.W. 950, 952 (Tex.Comm'n App.1919, judgm't adopted).\n\n [3] [4] The enforceability of the contractual provision in this case involves no fact issues. A\ncontractual provision like the one here by which one party agrees to pay the other some multiple\nof actual damages for breach of the agreement does not meet either part of the legal test for\nan enforceable liquidated damages provision. It cannot meet the first prong of the test because\nthe harm caused by the breach of the contract is not incapable or difficult of estimation. The\nprovision assumes actual damages can and will be determined, indeed must be determined, before\nthe prescribed multiplier can be applied. The provision cannot meet the second prong of the test\nbecause, instead of attempting to forecast actual damages, it calls for them to be determined and\nthen multiplied. Cf. Robert G. Beneke & Co. v. Cole, 550 S.W.2d 321 (Tex.Civ.App.—Dallas\n1977, no writ) (contract provision which fixes liquidated damages without excluding additional\nliability for actual damages is not a reasonable forecast of just compensation and therefore a\npenalty). A contractual provision like the one in this case is thus, on its face, an unenforceable\npenalty.\n\n [5] [6] Harry, however, did not plead penalty as an affirmative defense to an award of damages\nunder the liquidated damages provision in the partnership agreement. Although penalty is not\namong the affirmative defenses enumerated in Rule 94, TEX.R.CIV.P., the listing in that rule\nis not exclusive. Penalty is, in the language of the rule, a “matter constituting an avoidance or\naffirmative defense.” Johnson, 582 S.W.2d at 557; Oetting, 553 S.W.2d at 795–796; Robinson v.\nGranite Equip.

Phillips, 820 S.W.2d 785 (1991)\n\n\n\n\n [7] One exception to this rule is the defense of illegality, a defense specifically listed in Rule 94.\n“[I]f the illegal nature of the document to be relied upon or sought to be enforced is apparent from\nthe plaintiff's pleadings, it is not necessary that illegality be specially pleaded by the defendant\nin order to rely upon it as a defense.” Lewkowicz v. El Paso Apparel Corp., 625 S.W.2d 301,\n303 (Tex.1981); accord Niles v. Harris County Fresh Water Supply Dist., 339 S.W.2d 562, 563\n(Tex.Civ.App.—Waco 1960, writ ref'd); Reid v. Associated Employers Lloyds, 164 S.W.2d 584,\n585–586 (Tex.Civ.App.—Fort Worth 1942, writ ref'd); Montgomery Ward & Co. v. Lusk, 52\nS.W.2d 1110 (Tex.Civ.App.—Waco 1932, writ ref'd); Texas & P. Coal Co. v. Lawson, 89 Tex.\n394, 34 S.W. 919, 921 (1896). Two principles support this exception to the general rule that\naffirmative defenses are waived if not pleaded. One is that “[w]hen a plaintiff in his pleadings\nanticipates defensive matters and pleads them, a defendant may rely upon the defenses though\nhis only pleading is a general denial.” Raney v. White, 267 S.W.2d 199, 200 (Tex.Civ.App.—San\nAntonio 1954, writ ref'd). Pleading an agreement illegal on its face in effect anticipates the defense.\nThe other principle is that the courts will not enforce a plainly illegal contract even if the parties do\nnot object. Lawson, 34 S.W. at 921. Enforcement of an illegal agreement violates public policy. Id.\n\n [8] For the same reasons, we hold that the defense of penalty is not waived by the failure\nto plead it if it is apparent on the face of the petition and established as a matter of law.\nEnforcement of a penalty, like enforcement of an illegal contract, violates *790 public policy.\nRESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACT § 356; see State v. Alpha Oil & Gas, Inc., 747\nS.W.2d 378 (Tex.1988). It should not be done, even if the parties do not object. In this case Martha\npleaded that she was “entitled to damages ... in the amount of ten (10) times all losses suffered”.\nInasmuch as Martha's own pleading establishes that the contractual provision she relies upon is an\nunenforceable penalty under our decisions in Stewart and Campesi as a matter of law, Harry was\nnot required to plead penalty as an affirmative defense.\n\nContrary to the dissent's very exaggerated alarms, we do not hold that the affirmative defense of\npenalty need never be pleaded. Whenever the defense is not clearly established on the face of the\npleadings, as it is here, it must be pleaded. We do not “resurrect[ ] trial by ambush”, post, at 790,\nor “retreat from ... encouraging full disclosure during discovery”, post, at 792. We apply a narrow\nbut necessary exception, long and well established, to the general requirement that affirmative\ndefenses be pleaded. We do not hold that penalty “can be asserted as a defense for the first time\non appeal”, post, at 792, in violation of Rule 52(a), TEX.R.APP.P. The record in this case reflects\nthat the issue of penalty was raised in the trial court, and that the trial court refused to enforce the\npenalty provision of the partnership agreement.\n\n******\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Phillips, 820 S.W.2d 785 (1991)\n\n\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that Martha is not entitled to recover ten times her actual damages.\nFinding no error in the judgment of the court of appeals, we affirm it.\n\n\nGONZALEZ, Justice, dissenting.\nDespite the clear language of TEX.R.CIV.P. 94 and the collective wisdom of every court of appeals\nof this state that has considered the issue, the majority holds that a defendant need not affirmatively\nplead the defense of “penalty” in a contract action. This holding resurrects trial by ambush and\nrejects the notion that parties are entitled to know what theories of law they will face at trial. I would\nhold that by failing to plead it, Mr. Phillips waived his right to assert that the contract he entered\ninto with his wife is unenforceable. Furthermore, since Mr. Phillips waived the penalty defense by\nfailing to affirmatively plead it, I would not reach the question of whether the contractual provision\nin question is, on its face, an unenforceable penalty. I thus would reverse the judgment of the\ncourt of appeals and remand this cause to the trial court for entry of a judgment that enforces the\nprovision.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Phillips were married for 32 years prior to getting a divorce. With the assistance of\ncounsel, they entered into a pre-divorce agreement, whereby they transferred about $18 million\nof their assets into a partnership which Mr. Phillips would manage. Mr. Phillips in effect said to\nhis soon-to-be ex-wife: “Trust me.” As a disincentive to cheating or short changing Mrs. Phillips,\nMr. Phillips pledged that he would pay her 10 times the amount of the losses if he violated the\ncontract. 1 The agreement also recited that Mr. Phillips owed Mrs. Phillips a fiduciary duty, a\nhigher standard of care than normally exists between parties to a contract. 2\n\nEight years later, Mrs. Phillips sued Mr. Phillips, alleging that he violated the agreement. *791\nMr. Phillips entered a general denial and asserted the affirmative defenses of limitations, laches,\nand equitable estoppel. In a unanimous verdict, the jury found that Mr. Phillips breached the\nagreement by interfering with Mrs. Phillips right to examine the books and records of the\npartnership, and by willfully underpaying Mrs. Phillips and overpaying himself.\n\n\n\n                                          AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\nRule 94 enumerates specific affirmative defenses which are waived if not pleaded, such as accord\nand satisfaction, arbitration and award, fraud, illegality, statute of frauds, statute of limitations,\n“and any other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense.” TEX.R.CIV.P. 94. An\naffirmative defense does not tend to rebut factual propositions asserted by a plaintiff, but seeks\nto establish an independent reason why the plaintiff should not recover. Gorman v. Life Ins. Co.\nof North America, 811 S.W.2d 542, 546 (Tex.1991). Asserting the defense of penalty does not\ndeny the facts pleaded by the plaintiff; instead, it is an independent reason why the contract should\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                     6\n\fPhillips v. Phillips, 820 S.W.2d 785 (1991)\n\n\n\nnot be enforced as written. In other words, if the defendant asserts facts that defeat in whole or in\npart the plaintiff's claim, such assertion amounts to an affirmative defense that must be pleaded\nor it is waived. “Penalty” is a classic affirmative defense; in my view, it clearly falls within the\npurview of Rule 94.\n\nThe majority implies that as long as the issue does not depend upon evidence or findings, no\npurpose is served by requiring that it be specifically pleaded. But there is a valid purpose to serve,\nnamely, the need for notice and fair play, so as to avoid trials by ambush.\n\nThe court refers to Lewkowicz v. El Paso Apparel Corp., 625 S.W.2d 301, 303 (Tex.1981), for\nits holding that pleading is not necessary if the affirmative defense appears on the face of the\nplaintiff's pleadings. That case is distinguishable because it involved the defense of illegality of\ncontract. The defense of illegality is a special situation and a poor choice from which to draw a rule\nof general applicability. The rule that a court will not enforce an illegal contract is for the public's\nbenefit rather than contending parties. Lewis v. Davis, 145 Tex. 468, 199 S.W.2d 146, 151 (1947).\nA strong policy reason supports the illegality exception. That is, courts should not have to validate\ncontracts that are illegal on their face merely because a defendant has failed to plead illegality.\n\nHere, the court seems to be saying that pleading and proof are not necessary, because the issue\nof whether the liquidated damages provision is a penalty is a question of law. In some contracts\nit may be possible to determine from their four corners that they impose a penalty. The classic\nexample is the lease that assesses the same liquidated damages for every breach, regardless of how\ntrivial. Stewart v. Basey, 150 Tex. 666, 245 S.W.2d 484, 486 (1952). But, in most cases, proof will\nbe necessary. Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. La Villa I.S.D., 779 S.W.2d 102, 106–107 (Tex.App.\n—Corpus Christi 1989, no writ); See D. WENDORF, ET AL., TEXAS RULES OF EVIDENCE\nMANUAL, I–38 (3rd ed. 1991).\n\nA good example of the need for proof is Presnal v. TLL Energy Corp., 788 S.W.2d 123, 127\n(Tex.App.—Houston [1st Dist.1990], writ denied). In that case, a mineral lease provided that the\nlessee was required to drill a second well or pay $75,000, which the defendant contended was a\npenalty. There is no way a court could possibly know if this provision is a reasonable forecast of\ndamages and therefore not a penalty, unless pleadings and proof develop the issue. It would be\npatently unfair not to require defendant to notify the plaintiff that the possible existence of penalty\nwould be an issue and this is contrary to well established case law.\n\nEvery intermediate appellate court considering this issue has held that penalty is an affirmative\ndefense under Rule 94 which is waived if not pleaded.

Waite, 424 S.W.2d 691, 693\n(Tex.Civ.App.—Waco 1968, writ ref'd n.r.e.).\n\nThere is no compelling reason for this court now to reject by implication the well-grounded\npleading practice and disagree with the cases cited above that hold that as a rule penalty is an\naffirmative defense which must be pleaded or it is waived. In my view, this is a retreat from this\ncourt's recent trend towards encouraging full disclosure during discovery of all witnesses, facts and\nlegal theories upon which a party intends to rely at trial. This trend not only encourages litigants\nto be well prepared for trial, but also enables disputes to be resolved on their true merits and\nnot on “mere technicalities.” It makes no sense to me to subject parties to a severe sanction for\nfailing to disclose witnesses or to supplement discovery responses, but not require them to plead\nthe legal theory upon which they intend to rely to defeat their opponent's claim. The majority has\ncreated an exception to Rule 94 that has a visceral appeal, but collapses on its own logic. The court\nsays that the contractual provision in issue is a penalty as a matter of law, and thus need not be\npleaded (and can be asserted as a defense for the first time on appeal). But a defendant likewise\nmay defeat a contract claim under a statute of limitations defense. And while the defendant may\nbe entitled to a judgment as a matter of law, we nevertheless require affirmative pleading of the\nstatute of limitations defense. The court ultimately rationalizes its de facto modification of Rule\n94 by relying on the RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 356 to assert that public\npolicy demands the result. The court expands the public policy exception to Rule 94's pleading\nrequirement beyond the exception for illegal contracts to include contracts that allegedly impose\na penalty. This is a faulty rationale. First, this is not a case where pure contract principles apply.\nMr. Phillips agreed to a higher standard of care (namely, a fiduciary's standard) than he normally\nwould have owed Mrs. Phillips in a standard contractual relationship. Courts impose damages on\nparties who violate a fiduciary duty in order to punish the party's breach of trust. I agree with the\nRestatement § 356's directive that the “central objective behind the system of contract remedies is\ncompensatory, not punitive.” RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 356 comment a\n(1979). But Mr. Phillips entered into this agreement with his eyes open, accepting a higher than\nnormal standard of care and devising and adopting a measure of damages for his breach of that\nstandard. I do not see how the it advances the best interest of the public to bail him out of his\nbargain. I would hold that penalty is an affirmative defense that must be pleaded and that Mr.\nPhillips waived this defense by failing to plead it. For the above reasons, I dissent.\n\n\n\nMAUZY and DOGGETT, JJ., join this opinion.\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Phillips, 820 S.W.2d 785 (1991)\n\n\n\n1      The jury also found that Harry breached the partnership agreement by failing to calculate the amount of distributions required to be\n       paid the partners and by failing to make all the distributions required by the agreement, but that Martha ratified Harry's actions in\n       making distributions other than as called for by the agreement.\n2      Harry contends that the court of appeals should not have disturbed the trial court's damage award. As a rule, however, the judgment in\n       a case tried by a jury must conform to the verdict. See TEX.R.CIV.P. 301. The trial court properly did not ask the jury to include in its\n       determination of Martha's actual damages a reasonable fee for legal services necessary to her prosecution of the case. See Hammonds\n       v. Hammonds, 158 Tex. 516, 313 S.W.2d 603, 605 (1958). We must assume that the jury followed the trial court's instructions and\n       answered the question put to them. See Turner, Collie & Braden v. Brookhollow, Inc., 642 S.W.2d 160, 167 (Tex.1982). Given that\n       assumption, we must conclude that the jury's answer of $300,000 to the trial court's question did not include attorney fees.\n          Harry argues that, logically, the jury must have arrived at their $300,000 finding by adding $37,585 accounting fees which Martha\n          testified she incurred to the stipulated $250,000 in attorney fees. However plausible Harry's explanation of the jury's reasoning\n          process may be, it cannot substitute for the jury's finding. What the jury found, not why the jury found it, is the relevant inquiry\n          absent jury misconduct. First Nat'l Bank v. Zimmerman, 442 S.W.2d 674, 678 (Tex.1969).\n          Under Rule 301, the trial court could properly have rendered judgment awarding Martha less than the $300,000 found by the jury\n          as actual damages only if the finding had no support in the evidence. See Burt v. Lochausen, 151 Tex. 289, 249 S.W.2d 194, 199\n          (1952). See also 4 R. MCDONALD, TEXAS CIVIL PRACTICE IN DISTRICT AND COUNTY COURTS § 17.32 nn. 7–8 (rev.\n          1984). Harry does not argue here that there is no evidence to support the jury's finding. Thus, we conclude that the court of appeals\n          was correct in rendering judgment against Harry for the actual damages found by the jury plus stipulated attorney fees.\n          Harry also complains of the court of appeals' judgment that he, rather than the partnership, pay Martha's attorney fees. This point,\n          however, was not raised in Harry's motion for rehearing in the court of appeals and is therefore not preserved. See TEX.R.APP.P.\n          131(e); Oil Field Haulers Ass'n v. Railroad Commission, 381 S.W.2d 183, 189 (Tex.1964).\n3      “Damages for breach by either party may be liquidated in the agreement but only at an amount which is reasonable in the light of the\n       anticipated or actual harm caused by the breach, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or non-feasibility of otherwise\n       obtaining an adequate remedy. A term fixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is void as a penalty.”\n1      At trial, Mr. Phillips testified as follows:\n             Q There's another interesting provision in [the partnership agreement] that says if Mrs. Phillips can show that you have breached\n             your fiduciary duty to her that you will be obliged to pay her 10 times any amount that she proves. Are you familiar with that?\n             A Yes sir.\n             Q How in the world did that get in there?\n             A I wanted her to let me-wanted to prove to her that I would not do anything wrong.\n             Q So—\n             A So I put it in myself.\n             Q Was it your idea?\n             A Yes, sir.\n2      The partnership agreement provides:\n          16.1 Fiduciary Capacity. “The general partner shall act in a fiduciary capacity with respect to the limited partner.”\n          16.2 Damages. “If the general partner breaches his trust hereunder, he shall pay to the limited partner as liquidated damages ten\n          times the amount she loses as a result of such breach. Errors of judgment shall not be considered breaches of trusts”.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                            © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

CSG Systems, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2005)\n2005 WL 171349\n\n\n\n\n                                              BACKGROUND\n\nBeginning in the late 1990's, Southern Union experienced technological difficulties and realized\nthat its computer system was no longer capable of printing and mailing approximately one million\nbills per month to its customers. 1 Southern Union investigated companies to which it could\noutsource these operations and then requested proposals from several potential vendors. CSG\nresponded to Southern Union's request in February 2000. Southern Union selected CSG's bid from\nthe field of candidates, and the two companies engaged in formal negotiations from April until\nSeptember.\n\nA contract was finalized and signed by representatives from both Southern Union and CSG as of\nOctober 13, 2000. The contract contained a “discontinuance fee” provision, obligating Southern\nUnion to pay a specified amount of damages to CSG in the event that Southern Union terminated\nthe agreement before its five-year term expired. The parties agree that the provision was intended\nas a liquidated damages provision.\n\nAfter the contract was finalized, CSG provided Southern Union with a written project plan\ncontemplating December 1, 2000 as the date for CSG to “go live” with the print-and-mail\noperations. In the months leading up to that deadline, implementation problems arose on both sides\nand the conversion fell behind schedule. The companies continued discussions in an attempt to\nsolve the problems until the first week of January 2001, when Southern Union ceased work on the\nproject. Southern Union filed suit against CSG on February 7, asserting breach of contract among\nother causes of action.\n\nIn its verdict, the jury found that Southern Union and CSG were both in breach of the agreement,\nbut that CSG's breach was excused, and that CSG would be fairly and reasonably compensated by\nan award of $2.1 million for the discontinuance fee; $111,000 for the cost of paper and envelopes\npurchased by CSG; $1,045,944 for CSG's lost profits; and $140,000 for the cost of software\nlicenses provided by CSG to Southern Union. Beneath the last element of damages, the jury wrote\n“upon return of 300 licenses to CSG, the answer would be $0.”The trial court determined that, as a\nmatter of law, it was proper to award liquidated damages in lieu of actual damages, and therefore\nentered a final judgment in conformance with the jury's verdict, for a total amount of $2,351,000,\nplus interest and attorney's fees.\n\n\n\n                                                 ANALYSIS\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

CSG Systems, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2005)\n2005 WL 171349\n\n *2 On appeal, Southern Union challenges the award of damages to CSG Systems, claiming that\nCSG should not be awarded any liquidated damages pursuant to the discontinuance fee provision,\nbut rather that CSG's recovery should be confined to $1,045,944 in lost profits. Southern Union\nfirst asserts that, based on the timing of its breach, the proper calculation of the fee results in a zero\nsum. Alternatively, Southern Union asserts that even if the proper calculation is $2.1 million, CSG\nis not entitled to recover the award because that amount constitutes an illegal penalty. Southern\nUnion also claims that prejudgment interest should not be awarded on CSG's damages for the\ndiscontinuance fee or lost profits. Finally, Southern Union urges that it is entitled to a remittitur\nof $140,000 because it returned the software licenses to CSG.\n\n\nThe Discontinuance Fee Provision\nSouthern Union's first issue, asserting that the timing of Southern Union's breach results in zero\ndamages for the discontinuance fee, turns on a construction of the provision's terms. We agree\nwith the parties that the provision is unambiguous. We therefore review this issue as a matter of\nlaw, looking only to the contract's four corners and interpreting its plain meaning. See French\nv. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., 896 S.W.2d 795, 796-97 (Tex.1995). The discontinuance fee provision\nstates:\n\n           The parties have mutually agreed upon the fees for the Services to be provided\n           hereunder based upon certain assumed volumes of processing activity, and the\n           length of the term of Agreement. Customer 2 acknowledges and agrees that,\n           without the certainty of revenue promised by the commitments set forth in this\n           Agreement, CSG would have been unwilling to provide the Services at the\n           fees set forth in the Agreement. Because of the difficulty in ascertaining CSG's\n           actual damages for a termination or other breach of the Agreement by Customer\n           resulting in a termination of this Agreement before the expiration of the then-\n           current term, Customer agrees that prior to such termination and in addition to\n           all other amounts then due and owing to CSG, Customer will pay to CSG (as\n           a contract and not as a penalty) an amount equal to a percentage of the total\n           Subscriber Statement Minimum for the remaining term of the Agreement, as\n           defined in Schedule C, times the then current ESP Processing Fees for the First\n           Physical Page, as defined in Schedule C beginning with the calendar month\n           in which termination occurs (“Discontinuance Fee”). If any such termination\n           occurs prior to the first anniversary of the Effective Date of this Agreement,\n           the percentage shall be fifty percent (50%). If between the first and second\n           anniversary of the Effective Date it shall be thirty percent (30%) and if following\n           the second anniversary of the Effective Date it shall be ten percent (10%).\n           Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Discontinuance Fee is a reasonable\n           estimation of the actual damages which CSG would suffer if CSG were to fail\n           to receive the amount of processing business contemplated by this Agreement.\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

CSG Systems, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2005)\n2005 WL 171349\n\n           Customer shall not be required to pay the Discontinuance Fee if CSG terminates\n           this Agreement other than as a result of Customer's breach of its obligations\n           hereunder or if Customer terminates the Agreement for a material, uncured\n           breach by CSG. The Discontinuance Fee shall be CSG's sole remedy resulting\n           from a termination or other breach of this Agreement by Customer resulting\n           in a termination of this Agreement before the expiration of the then-current\n           term. In the event of a sale or transfer of all or substantially all of Southern\n           Union Company's assets to a third party, the percentages used to calculate the\n           Discontinuance Fee shall be twenty-five percent (25%), fifteen percent (15%)\n           and five percent (5%), respectively.\n\n*3 (Emphasis added.)\n\nThe parties agree that, given the plain meaning of the relevant language, the proper way to calculate\nthe discontinuance fee for a breach within the first year of signing the agreement is to multiply the\napplicable “Subscriber Statement Minimum” by the applicable “ESP Processing Fees” and then\ntake fifty percent of that total. The parties disagree, however, on how to determine one factor of this\nequation: the Subscriber Statement Minimum. Southern Union asserts that, pursuant to Schedule\nC, the minimum does not accrue until after the “commencement date.” 3 Because Southern Union\nbreached this agreement prior to the commencement date, 4 it claims that the minimum was zero,\nand that the total calculation should therefore be zero.\n\nCSG interprets the provision to mean that, although Schedule C prevents Southern Union from\nhaving to pay the monthly minimum until after the commencement date, that time restriction\ndoes not apply to Southern Union's liability under the discontinuance fee provision. CSG asserts\nthat Southern Union's interpretation is wrong because it allows Southern Union to breach the\ncontract without consequence, so long as it does so within ninety days of the commencement date,\nregardless of the significant time and money invested by CSG during the implementation phase.\nAccording to CSG, the liquidated damages provision is most necessary during this initial time\nperiod because of the parties' unequal contributions and because of the difficulty in calculating\npotential damages before any actual profits have been made.\n\nWe agree with CSG's reading of the contract. Nothing in the provision limits its applicability to a\nbreach occurring after the commencement of services. The provision specifies the circumstances\nin which Southern Union is excused from paying the discontinuance fee, and none impose such\na timing limitation. To the contrary, the provision's express terms state that Southern Union shall\nbe liable for the discontinuance fee, at a rate of fifty percent, should it cause “any termination”\nwithin one year of signing the contract.\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

CSG Systems, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2005)\n2005 WL 171349\n\nTestimony of witnesses from both Southern Union and CSG also supports CSG's assertion that the\nprovision was intended to apply during the implementation phase, to protect the significant up-\nfront contributions made by CSG before it had received any profits from the agreement. Pamela\nVanlandingham, CSG's Senior Vice President and General Manager of the statement processing\ncenter, testified that during November and December, the CSG team “worked around the clock” to\ncomplete the project, which included working “very hard over the holidays,” and that “CSG [had]\nexpended right at 500 to 600 hours” when Southern Union breached the contract. Southern Union\nofficials confirmed that the nature of this contract required front-loaded efforts by CSG and that,\nprior to terminating the agreement, they were aware of the money CSG invested on supplies and\nequipment, and of the hours CSG put toward programming, testing, and implementing the new\nsystem. David Kvapil, the Chief Financial Officer for Southern Union, testified that he knew CSG\nhad worked “well beyond the number of hours they were going to dedicate to the project,” that CSG\nhad provided a “significant batch of bills” to Southern Union for approval, and that CSG had spent\nover $100,000 on envelopes and paper by the end of December 2000. Christine Shores, a business\nanalyst for Southern Union's mail services division, testified that Southern Union approved the\norder for paper and envelopes prior to CSG placing it, and that Southern Union was aware of the\ntime and money spent by CSG in its efforts to commence live operations.\n\n *4 Based on the plain meaning of the provision, as supported by the witnesses' testimony,\nSouthern Union's liability for the discontinuance fee is not limited to a breach occurring after\nthe commencement of live operations. Southern Union is liable under the discontinuance fee for\nits breach of the agreement during the implementation phase. The amount of fair and reasonable\ndamages pursuant to the discontinuance fee was therefore properly calculated by the jury, and\naffirmed by the trial court, as $2.1 million. Southern Union's first issue is overruled.\n\n\nLiquidated Damages\nSouthern Union claims in its second issue that, if the discontinuance fee is properly calculated\nas $2.1 million, then CSG is not entitled to any recovery of that amount because it constitutes\nan improper penalty. For the purposes of this case, the parties agree that the discontinuance fee\nshould be treated as an award of liquidated damages.\n\nA liquidated damages provision may only be enforced when the court finds “(1) that the harm\ncaused by the breach is incapable or difficult of estimation and (2) that the amount of liquidated\ndamages called for is a reasonable forecast of just compensation.”Phillips v. Phillips, 820 S.W.2d\n785, 788 (Tex.1991). The party challenging the award of liquidated damages has the burden to\nestablish that the two-prong test is not satisfied and that, instead, the award of liquidated damages\nis an unenforceable penalty. See Dominzo v. Progressive County Mut. Ins. Co., 54 S.W.3d 867, 875\n(Tex.App.-Austin 2001, pet. denied). Whether the liquidated damages provision is enforceable is\na question of law.

CSG Systems, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2005)\n2005 WL 171349\n\n\n\nDifficulty of Estimation\nSouthern Union seeks to satisfy the first part of its burden by claiming that CSG's damages were\neasy to estimate. Southern Union bases this claim on a “price projection” document prepared\nby CSG before entering the agreement, which anticipated that CSG would earn a total profit\nof $1,045,944 over the five-year term of its contract with Southern Union. Because the jury\nultimately awarded this exact amount to CSG as lost profits, Southern Union argues that CSG was\ncapable of precisely estimating its damages, and therefore the liquidated damages provision is an\nunenforceable penalty from which CSG is not entitled to recover. The record, however, shows\notherwise.\n\nThe language of the discontinuance fee provision supports the trial court's determination that an\naward of liquidated damages was proper because CSG's actual damages were not easy to estimate.\nThe provision expressly states that it was included in the contract “[b]ecause of the difficulty in\nascertaining CSG's actual damages for a termination or other breach of the Agreement,” and that\n“CSG would have been unwilling to provide the Services at the fees set forth in the Agreement” had\nSouthern Union not promised “certainty of revenue” by obligating itself to pay the discontinuance\nfee in the event that it breached the contract. This provision was a bargained-for exchange,\nnegotiated and approved by both companies.\n\n *5 When a provision is mutually bargained for by equally competent parties, we give deference\nto its enforcement. See Shel-al Corp. v. American Nat'l Ins. Co., 492 F.2d 87, 94 (5th Cir.1974).\nStanley Mayer, Southern Union's Chief Information Officer, testified that the provision's terms\nwere negotiated between attorneys representing both companies. From the face of the contract,\nSouthern Union understood at the time it entered the agreement that CSG's damages would be\ndifficult to estimate and therefore agreed a liquidated damages provision was necessary.\n\n“[T]he fundamental purpose of a valid liquidated damages provision is to provide a reasonable\nmeasure of compensation in the event of a breach where, at the time the provision is agreed\nto the damages are indeterminable or will be otherwise difficult to prove.”24 Williston on\nContracts § 65:3, at 250 (4th ed.2002). It is well established that lost profits can be inherently\ndifficult to estimate. See Texas Inst., Inc. v. Teletron Energy Mgmt., Inc., 877 S.W.2d 276,\n279 (Tex.1994). Frequently, lost profits are too speculative to recover because their calculation\ndepends on “uncertain and changing conditions, such as market fluctuations,” and this uncertainty\nis heightened where no profits have been made at the time the contract is breached. Id. The contract\nreflects that Southern Union and CSG sought to avoid such speculation in agreeing to the liquidated\ndamages provision. The sliding scale of damages recognized the front-loaded value to be provided\nby CSG. As argued by CSG, had there not been a discontinuance fee to rely on, in the event of\na breach by Southern Union-particularly early in the contract term-then CSG would have risked\nbeing unable to recover because of the uncertainty in calculating its lost profits.\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

CSG Systems, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2005)\n2005 WL 171349\n\nThat CSG prepared a projection of its prices, and that the jury looked to the projection as a\nreasonable calculation for lost profits, does not satisfy Southern Union's burden. The purpose of\nthe document was not to define CSG's potential damages. Rather, as Vanlandingham testified,\nthe projection was an internal tool used by CSG to outline the prices it anticipated charging for\nits print-and-mail services, so that CSG could make an informed bid in response to Southern\nUnion's request for proposal. Vanlandingham also testified that the projection was prepared with a\n“conservative accounting approach to pricing.” CSG excluded several items from its calculations\nbecause, prior to entering the contract, the parties had not assigned a value to these items. This\nincreased the difficulty of estimating damages. CSG's expert confirmed the difficulty of this\nestimation by explaining several different ways that CSG's lost profits could be calculated, with the\nresults ranging between approximately $1 million to $4 million. After hearing this evidence, the\njury determined that $1,045,944 was a reasonable award of lost profits. But their verdict does not\nestablish that the estimation was either an easy or precise one to make. Given the mutually agreed-\nupon terms of the provision, and the evidence in support of its plain meaning, we are unpersuaded\nby Southern Union's assertion that CSG's damages were easy to estimate.\n\n\nReasonable Forecast of Just Compensation\n *6 Southern Union seeks to satisfy the second part of its burden by showing that the\ndiscontinuance fee provision is an unenforceable penalty because the amount awarded to CSG\nas liquidated damages is unreasonable. Southern Union claims that this is established simply by\nthe fact that the $2.1 million awarded to CSG pursuant to the discontinuance fee is double the\namount found by the jury as lost profits. A liquidated damages provision will be considered an\nunenforceable penalty if the amount awarded is so disproportionate to the actual or anticipated\ndamages that it in effect punishes the breach, thereby coercing performance of the contract by\nmaking it too costly to not adhere to its terms. 24 Williston on Contracts § 65:3, at 249 (4th\ned.2002); see also Kothe v. R.C. Taylor Trust, 280 U.S. 224, 226, 50 S.Ct. 142, 74 L.Ed. 382\n(1930).\n\nBut Southern Union fails to cite, and we are unaware of, any cases in support of its claim that a two-\nto-one ratio of liquidated-to-actual damages is unreasonable per se.There is, however, authority\nto the contrary. In Baker v. International Record Syndicate, Inc., our sister court approved a\nliquidated damages award of $51,000, which was more than triple the $15,000 found as actual\ndamages. 812 S.W.2d 53, 56 (Tex.App.-Dallas 1991, no writ). The Texas Supreme Court also\nupheld a trial court's judgment awarding $790,000 in liquidated damages, which was twice the\n$395,000 found as actual damages.Sealock v. Texas Fed. Sav. & Loan Assoc., 755 S.W.2d 69,\n70 (Tex.1988).\n\nSouthern Union seeks to distinguish such cases by urging that, even if it is normally reasonable to\naward liquidated damages in an amount that is double the actual damages, this ratio is unreasonable\nin a case where the amount at issue involves millions rather than thousands of dollars, as here.\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    7\n\fSouthern Union Co. v. CSG Systems, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2005)\n2005 WL 171349\n\nAgain, while no cases support Southern Union's claim, there is authority to the contrary. In a case\ninvolving high-end commercial real estate, the Fifth Circuit held that a liquidated damages award\nof $5 million was reasonable, despite an internal memorandum stating that the anticipated damages\nwere $1.4 million.Thanksgiving Tower Partners v. Anros Thanksgiving Partners, 64 F.3d 227,\n232 (5th Cir.1995). Thus, as a matter of law, it is not unreasonable per se to award liquidated\ndamages in an amount that is double the actual damages. Moreover, in this case, the reasonableness\nof CSG's award is supported by the record.\n\nThe discontinuance fee expressly states that it “is not a penalty” and that it “is a reasonable\nestimation of the actual damages which CSG would suffer if CSG were to fail to receive the\namount of processing business as contemplated by this Agreement.”Although parties cannot\navoid a challenge to a liquidated damages provision simply by characterizing it as “reasonable,”\nsuch express language is instructive of the parties' intent when the terms are mutually bargained\nfor between equally competent parties. See Shel-al Corp., 492 F.2d at 94; Loggins Constr. Co.\nv. Stephen F. Austin State Univ. Bd. of Regents, 543 S.W.2d 682, 685 (Tex.App.-Tyler 1976,\nwrit ref'd). Southern Union's own witnesses testified that the language of the discontinuance fee\nprovision was bargained for and intended by the parties, and that the amount awarded under the\ndiscontinuance fee was reasonable. In response to questions on cross-examination, Stanley Mayer\nagreed that the provision was mutually negotiated, that he approved its terms, and that he knew\nSouthern Union would be responsible for paying the fee if it breached the contract. When David\nKvapil was asked whether he was aware at the time Southern Union filed suit against CSG “that\nthe calculation of the discontinuance fee would be approximately $2 million,” he responded that,\n“Yeah. I think that's what it calculates to.”Kvapil further agreed that Southern Union understood\nthe purpose of the discontinuance fee was “to compensate CSG for all the work they have done\nand all their expectation” and that this was “fair.”\n\n *7 The jury was asked to determine what amount would be “fair and reasonable” to award CSG\npursuant to the discontinuance fee, and it responded “$2.1 million.” A jury's findings on damages\nshould be upheld if there is sufficient evidence in the record to show that the amount is fair and\nreasonable compensation. Dillard Dep't Stores, Inc. v. Silva, 148 S.W.3d 370, 371 (Tex.2004).\nHere, the jury was entitled to make this finding based on both the express language of the contract\nand on the testimony of Southern Union's witnesses. We find that this is sufficient evidence from\nwhich the jury could determine that it was reasonable to award CSG $2.1 million in liquidated\ndamages. Southern Union's second issue is overruled.\n\n\nPrejudgment Interest\nSouthern Union urges in its third issue that, regardless of whether CSG is awarded lost profits or\nthe discontinuance fee, CSG is not entitled to recover prejudgment interest on either award because\nboth encompass elements of future damages, and section 304.1045 of the finance code, as amended\nin 2004, specifically prohibits recovery of prejudgment interest on awards of future damages.\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 8\n\fSouthern Union Co. v. CSG Systems, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2005)\n2005 WL 171349\n\nTex. Fin.Code Ann. § 304.1045 (West Supp.2004-05). CSG counters that the finance code does\nnot prevent prejudgment interest in this case because, by its express terms, the provision only\napplies to cases involving “wrongful death, personal injury, or property damage.”Tex. Fin.Code\nAnn. §§ 304.101, .1045 (West 1998 & Supp.2004-05). Southern Union asserts in response that,\ndespite its express terms, section 304.1045 prevents prejudgment interest here based on the Texas\nSupreme Court's holding that the statutory framework should be applied to all cases, not just those\ninvolving “wrongful death, personal injury, and property damage.”Johnson & Higgins of Tex.,\nInc. v. Kenneco Energy, Inc., 962 S.W.2d 507, 514, 530 (Tex.1998). CSG argues, however, that\neven if section 304.1045 prevents prejudgment interest on future damages in a breach-of-contract\ncase, it is still proper for CSG to recover prejudgment interest on the amount awarded as the\ndiscontinuance fee because it is an award of liquidated, not future, damages. We review the trial\ncourt's award of prejudgment interest for an abuse of discretion. Purcell Const., Inc. v. Welch, 17\nS.W.3d 398, 402 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2000, no pet.).\n\nSouthern Union and CSG agree that the discontinuance fee was intended to be a liquidated\ndamages provision. Liquidated damages are given in lieu of actual damages and thus they are not\nconsidered “future damages,” even though aspects of the liquidated award may compensate the\nparty for what would have otherwise been recovered as future losses. See Lafarge Corp. v. Wolff,\nInc., 977 S.W.2d 181, 188 n. 13 (Tex.App.-Austin 1998, pet. denied); Eberts v. Businesspeople\nPersonnel Servs., Inc., 620 S.W.2d 861, 864-65 (Tex.App.-Dallas 1981, no writ). Liquidated\ndamages are distinct from future damages because the measure of liquidated damages is stipulated\nto before the occurrence of a breach and thus, unlike future damages, the amount of liquidated\ndamages can be immediately ascertained at the time of the breach. See Phillips, 820 S.W.2d at\n788. It is permissible for a trial court to award prejudgment interest when a contract “provides the\nconditions on which liability depends and ... fixes a measure by which the sum payable can be\nascertained with reasonable certainty.”Wheat v. American Title Ins. Co., 751 S.W.2d 943, 944-45\n(Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1988, no writ); see also Sealock, 755 S.W.2d. at 70 (upholding\naward of prejudgment interest on liquidated damages); Perry Roofing Co. v. Olcott, 744 S.W.2d\n929, 932 (Tex.1988) (Wallace, J., dissenting) (“The Legislature has given contracting parties\nnotice that if they enter into and subsequently breach agreements in which damages are liquidated\nor otherwise ascertainable, they may be held liable for prejudgment interest. Parties to contracts\nhave always had this corresponding obligation and right....”).\n\n *8 We decline to reach the issue of whether the finance code prevents recovery of prejudgment\ninterest on future damages in a breach-of-contract case because we agree with CSG's argument\nthat liquidated damages are distinct from future damages and, as such, section 304.1045 does not\nprohibit the recovery of prejudgment interest on liquidated damages. The trial court therefore did\nnot abuse its discretion in awarding prejudgment interest to CSG on the $2.1 million it recovered\npursuant to the discontinuance fee.\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

CSG Systems, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2005)\n2005 WL 171349\n\n\nRemittitur\nIn its final issue, Southern Union asserts that the judgment should be modified to remit $140,000\nof CSG's damages. The jury expressly stated in the verdict that if Southern Union returned the\nsoftware licenses provided to it by CSG, then CSG would be entitled to zero damages for the\nlicenses. It is undisputed that Southern Union returned the licenses. The trial court awarded CSG\n$140,000 for the licenses, over Southern Union's objection. CSG does not oppose a remittitur of\n$140,000. Southern Union's fourth issue is sustained and we modify the judgment accordingly. In\nall other respects, the trial court's judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\nJustice KIDD not participating.\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    At the time, Southern Union had a contract with Pitney Bowes for that company to package the mailings after Southern Union\n       processed and printed them, but that contract was set to expire in December 2001.\n2      The provision refers to Southern Union as “Customer.”\n\n3      Schedule C states that, within the first year of the contract, the “minimums begin ninety (90) days ... following the initiation date of\n       services (‘Commencement Date’)....” The contract defines the commencement date as “the first day of the calendar month in which\n       the Services commence.”Schedule D discusses “services” as including a list of activities related to the printing, inserting and mailing\n       of customer bills in a specified carrier envelope, during specified billing cycles.\n4      CSG agrees that the commencement date had not yet occurred at the time of Southern Union's breach.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                           © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The State also urges that the statute under which this suit was\nbrought for a declaratory judgment violates provisions of the State Constitution forbidding the\nrendition of advisory opinions by the courts.\n\nAppellees are individuals and corporations engaged in an arrangement under which Sundaco, Inc.,\na retail store entity organized for the purpose of making the arrangement, is open for business only\non Sundays, and the other appellee corporations are open only on Mondays through Saturdays.\nThe purpose of this system of merchandising is to avoid violation of Article 286a, Vernon's Ann .\nTexas Penal Code, which makes unlawful the sale by any person of certain goods on both Saturday\nand Sunday. The plan operates by means of contracts under which Sundaco each Saturday night\nacquires from the other appellee corporations all merchandise in their stores and, after conducting\nbusiness through Sunday, returns the stores to the corporations that operate the remaining days of\nthe week. Profits made on Sunday are divided between Sundaco and the other corporations.\n\nAppellees brought suit for declaratory judgment under Section 15.12 of the Texas Business and\nCommerce Code, V.T.C.A. which purports to authorize suit when petitioner is ‘* * * uncertain\nof whether or not his action Or proposed action violates or Will violate the prohibition contained\nin Section 15.04 of this code * * *’ (Emphasis supplied). Section 15.04 of the code prohibits all\nmonopolies, trusts, and conspiracies in restraint of trade and declares such combinations illegal.\n [1] We have decided that because there is absent from the record any showing that a presently\njusticiable controversy exists between the State and the appellees, any judgment under the record\nwould be an advisory opinion the courts are not authorized to render. We do not reach the State's\npoints of error as to price control and lessening competition, and will notice only briefly the point\nunder which validity of Section 15.12 is challenged. We will order the cause dismissed.\n\n\nAppellees alleged the following with regard to the existence of a presenty justiciable controversy:\n         ‘The Defendant, The State of Texas, acting under its Attorney General and/\n         or District Attorney of Tarrant County, Texas, and other Counties in which a\n         corporate Plaintiff has operations, has contended that the actions and/or proposed\n         actions of all of the Plaintiffs, their agents and employees, violate or will violate the\n         prohibitions contained in Section 15.04 of the Business and Commerce Code.

As we have observed, appellees alleged in their petition, as a basis\nfor showing a justiciable controversy, that the State ‘the indicated its intention to proceed against\nthe Plaintiffs pursuant to said penalty provisions of said Code, which has given rise to a bona fide\ncontroversy and created justiciable issues which the Court has authority to determine.’\n\nIt is obvious from the record that appellees filed their petition seeking advice from the courts\nbecause they were ‘uncertain of whether or not (their) action or proposed action’ in carrying on\nthe Sundaco scheme ‘violates or will violate’ Section 15.04 prohibiting monopolies, trusts, and\nconspiracies in restraint of trade. Even if all but the prospective aspects of Section 15.12 are valid,\nand we do not decide that question, the suit for declaratory judgment will not lie unless proof is\nmade of a bona fide threat of interference by the State invoking the anti-trust laws.\n\nDiscretion rests with the Attorney General as to whether anti-trust suits will be brought by the State\nto interdict the Sundaco operations and invoke penalties. The record is devoid of any showing\nthat appellees had been ordered to discontinue their operations. There is no evidence of a threat\nto interfere with Sundaco activities as a violation of Section 15.04. No threat of interference by\nthe State with the rights of appellees appears beyond that implied by the existence of the statute\nand the State's answer defending against the petition for declaratory judgment. Appellees may not\ncompel the Attorney General to exercise his discretion by filing suit for declaratory judgment.\n\nThe power of courts to pass upon the ‘uncertainty’ appellees have with regard to their actions will\narise only when the interest of appellees require the use of judicial authority for their protection\nagainst actual interference. A threat that is only hypothetical is not enough. United Public Workers\nv. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 67 S.Ct . 556, 91 L.Ed. 754 (1947). In Hitchcock v.

Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\n\nFollowing a bench trial, the trial court denied the relief sought by TAB, and as requested by the\nState and Intervenors, declared that section 4.041 of the Texas Clean Air Act, sections 26.136 and\n27.1015 of the Texas Water Code, and section 8b of the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act, as well\nas the rules and regulations promulgated under those statutes, are constitutional with regard to the\nopen courts and jury trial provisions. We affirm the trial court's judgment as it relates to TAB's\njury trial challenge and reverse its judgment as to TAB's open courts challenge.\n\nAn overview of the regulatory scheme enacted by the legislature and these agencies is essential to\nan understanding of this case. In 1967, the Texas Legislature enacted the Clean Air Act of Texas.\nClean Air Act of Texas, 60th Leg., R.S., ch. 727, 1967 Tex.Gen.Laws 1941. The Clean Air Act was\ndesigned to safeguard the state's air resources without compromising the economic development\nof the state. Id. at § 1. The Act created the Texas Air Control Board and granted it the authority\nto promulgate regulations to accomplish the Act's goals. Id. at § 4(A)(2)(a). In the event the Air\nControl Board determined that a violation of its regulations had occurred, it was authorized to\nenforce those regulations in district court. Upon a judicial determination that a violation of the\nAir Control Board's regulations had occurred, two cumulative remedies were available, injunctive\nrelief to prohibit further violations and assessment of a fine ranging from $50 to $1,000 for each\nday the violations persisted. Id. at § 12(B).\n\nIn 1969, the Texas Legislature enacted the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Solid Waste Disposal Act,\n61st Leg., R.S., ch. 405, 1969 Tex.Gen.Laws 1320. The express purpose for this legislation was\nto protect public health and welfare by regulating the “collection, handling, storage, and disposal\nof solid waste.” Id. at § 1. The Texas Water Quality Board was designated the primary agency to\neffectuate the Disposal Act's purpose. Id. at § 4(f). Like the Air Control Board, the Water Quality\nBoard was authorized to enforce its rules and regulations in state district court. The Solid Waste\nDisposal Act provided the same remedies as the Clean Air Act. See id. at § 8(c).\n\nIn the last of the relevant statutory enactments, in 1969, the Texas Legislature promulgated a\nrevised version of the Water Quality Act. Water Quality Act—Revision, 61st Leg., R.S., ch. 760,\n1969 Tex.Gen.Laws 2229. By that Act, the Water Quality Board was given the power to develop\na statewide water quality plan, to perform research and investigations, and to adopt rules and\nissue orders necessary to effectuate the Act's purposes. Id. at § 3.01–3.10. The Water Quality Act\nprovided the same remedies as the Solid Waste Management Act and the Clean Air Act. See id.\nat § 4.02.\n\nOriginally, neither the Water Quality Board nor the Air Control Board had the power to levy civil\npenalties directly in the event it determined that its regulations or orders had been violated. Instead,\neach board was required first to file suit against the violator in district court. Only the district court\nhad the power to assess civil penalties.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                      2\n\fTexas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\n\nThe legislature substantially changed this enforcement scheme in 1985. That year the Air Control\nBoard and the Water Commission (formerly the Water Control Board) were granted the power\nto assess civil penalties directly of up to $10,000 per day per violation. 2 Both administrative\nbodies also retained the option to pursue civil penalties in district court. *443 TEX.HEALTH\n& SAFETY CODE §§ 361.224, 382.081; TEX.WATER CODE § 26.123. This was the regulatory\nscheme in effect when the district court rendered judgment in this case. 3\n\nAfter the Air Control Board or Water Commission assesses a penalty, the offender must either\ntimely pay the penalty or file suit in district court. However, a supersedeas bond or cash deposit\npaid into an escrow account, in the full amount of the penalty, is a prerequisite to judicial review.\nTEX.HEALTH & SAFETY CODE §§ 382.089(a), (b), 361.252(k), (l ); TEX.WATER CODE\n§ 26.136(j). A party who fails to make a cash deposit or file a bond forfeits all rights to judicial\nreview. TEX.HEALTH & SAFETY CODE §§ 361.252(m), 382.089(c); TEX.WATER CODE §\n26.136(k).\n\nTAB alleges that it is a Texas not-for-profit corporation, that its members do business throughout\nTexas, and that it is authorized to represent its members on any matter that may have an impact\non their businesses.\n\nTAB filed this suit under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, TEX.CIV.PRAC. &\nREM.CODE §§ 37.001–37.011, alleging that some of its members had been subjected to civil\npenalties assessed by either the Air Control Board or the Water Commission. TAB further alleged\nthat all of its other members that operate their businesses pursuant to the pertinent provisions of\nthe Texas Clean Air Act, the Texas Water Code, or the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act or any\nrules or orders issued pursuant to those provisions were put at “substantial risk (if not certainty)”\nof being assessed civil penalties by the Air Control Board or the Water Commission. Thus this\nsuit does not challenge specific instances of the Air Control Board's or the Water Commission's\nexercise, or threatened exercise, of the civil penalty power. Instead, TAB's suit is a facial challenge\nto the constitutionality of this administrative enforcement scheme under the Texas Constitution.\n\nThe Defendants and Intervenors counterclaimed seeking a declaratory judgment that the statutes,\nrules, and regulations challenged by TAB do not, on their face, conflict with the open courts and\njury trial provisions of our constitution. The trial court granted the Defendants' and Intervenors'\nrequested declaratory judgment and denied TAB's request for a declaratory judgment. The court\nalso denied TAB's request for injunctive relief.\n\nTAB appealed directly to this court. See TEX.GOV'T CODE § 22.001(c); 4 TEX.R.APP.P. 140.\nIn this court, TAB has limited its challenges to claims of unconstitutional denial of a jury trial and\nviolation of our constitution's open courts provision.\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Standing\n\nBefore we reach the merits of this case, we first consider the matter of the trial court's jurisdiction,\nas well as our own; specifically we determine whether TAB has standing to challenge the statutes\nand regulations in question. Because TAB's standing to bring this action is not readily apparent,\nand because our jurisdiction as well as that of the trial court depends on this issue, we requested\nsupplemental briefing on standing at the oral argument of this case. In response, the parties insist\nthat any question of standing has been waived in the trial court and cannot be raised by the court\nfor the first time on appeal. We disagree.\n\n [1] Subject matter jurisdiction is essential to the authority of a court to decide a case. Standing\nis implicit in the concept of subject matter jurisdiction. The standing requirement stems from two\nlimitations on subject matter jurisdiction: the separation of powers doctrine and, in Texas, the open\ncourts provision. Subject matter jurisdiction *444 is never presumed and cannot be waived. 5\n\n [2] [3] One limit on courts' jurisdiction under both the state and federal constitutions is the\nseparation of powers doctrine. See TEX.CONST. art. II, § 1; Valley Forge Christian College v.\nAmericans United for Separation of Church and State, 454 U.S. 464, 471–74, 102 S.Ct. 752, 757–\n60, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982); Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 2204, 45 L.Ed.2d\n343 (1975); see also, Antonin Scalia, The Doctrine of Standing as an Essential Element of the\nSeparation of Powers, 18 SUFFOLK U.L.Rev. 881, 889 n. 69 (1983) (noting that the dicta of\nFlast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 100, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 1952, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968), suggesting that\nstanding is unrelated to the separation of powers doctrine has since been disavowed). Under this\ndoctrine, governmental authority vested in one department of government cannot be exercised by\nanother department unless expressly permitted by the constitution. Thus we have construed our\nseparation of powers article to prohibit courts from issuing advisory opinions because such is the\nfunction of the executive rather than the judicial department. 6 Firemen's Ins. Co. v. Burch, 442\nS.W.2d 331, 333 (Tex.1969); Morrow v. Corbin, 122 Tex. 553, 62 S.W.2d 641, 644 (Tex.1933).\nAccordingly, we have interpreted the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, TEX.CIV.PRAC. &\nREM.CODE §§ 37.001–.011, to be merely a procedural device for deciding cases already within a\ncourt's jurisdiction rather than a legislative enlargement of a court's power, permitting the rendition\nof advisory opinions. Firemen's Ins. Co., 442 S.W.2d at 333; United Serv. Life Ins. Co. v. Delaney,\n396 S.W.2d 855, 863 (Tex.1965); California Prods., Inc. v. Puretex Lemon Juice, Inc., 160 Tex.\n586, 334 S.W.2d 780 (1960).\n\n[4] [5] The distinctive feature of an advisory opinion is that it decides an abstract question of law\nwithout binding the parties. Alabama State Fed'n of Labor v. McAdory, 325 U.S. 450, 461, 65 S.Ct.\n1384, 1389, 89 L.Ed. 1725 (1945); Firemen's Ins.

Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nInc., 160 Tex. at 591, 334 S.W.2d at 783. An opinion issued in a case brought by a party without\nstanding is advisory because rather than remedying an actual or imminent harm, the judgment\naddresses only a hypothetical injury. See Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751, 104 S.Ct. 3315,\n3324, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984). Texas courts, like federal courts, have no jurisdiction to render such\nopinions.\n\n [6] The separation of powers doctrine is not the only constitutional basis for standing. Under\nfederal law, standing is also an aspect of the Article III limitation of the judicial power to “cases”\nand “controversies.” Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 731, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 1364, 31 L.Ed.2d\n636 (1972). To comport with Article III, a federal court may hear a case only when the litigant has\nbeen threatened with or has sustained an injury. Valley Forge Christian College, 454 U.S. at 471,\n102 S.Ct. at 758. Under the Texas Constitution, standing is implicit in the open courts provision,\nwhich contemplates access to the courts only for those litigants suffering an injury. Specifically,\nthe open courts provision provides:\n\n            All courts shall be open, and every person for an injury done him, in his lands,\n            goods, person or reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law.\n\nTEX. CONST. art. I, § 13 (emphasis added). Because standing is a constitutional prerequisite to\nmaintaining a suit under both federal and Texas law, we look to the more extensive jurisprudential\nexperience of the federal courts on this subject for any guidance it may yield.\n\nUnder federal law, a lack of standing deprives a court of subject matter jurisdiction because\nstanding is an element of such *445 jurisdiction.

Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\n\n [7] Subject matter jurisdiction is an issue that may be raised for the first time on appeal; it\nmay not be waived by the parties. Texas Employment Comm'n v. International Union of Elec.,\nRadio and Mach. Workers, Local Union No. 782, 163 Tex. 135, 352 S.W.2d 252, 253 (1961);\nRESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF JUDGMENTS § 11, comment c (1982). This court recently\nreiterated that axiom in Gorman v. Life Insurance Co., 811 S.W.2d 542, 547 (Tex.), cert. denied,\n502 U.S. 824, 112 S.Ct. 88, 116 L.Ed.2d 60 (1991). Because we conclude that standing is a\ncomponent of subject matter jurisdiction, it cannot be waived and may be raised for the first time\non appeal. 8\n\n [8] If we were to conclude that standing is unreviewable on appeal at least three undesirable\nconsequences could result. First and foremost, appellate courts would be impotent to prevent lower\ncourts from exceeding their constitutional and statutory limits of authority. Second, appellate\ncourts could not arrest collusive suits. Third, by operation of the doctrines of res judicata and\ncollateral estoppel, judgments rendered in suits addressing only hypothetical injuries could bar\nrelitigation of issues by a litigant who eventually suffers an actual injury. We therefore hold that\nstanding, as a component of subject matter *446 jurisdiction, cannot be waived in this or any\nother case and may be raised for the first time on appeal by the parties or by the court.\n\nWe are aware that this holding conflicts with Texas Industrial Traffic League v. Railroad\nCommission, 633 S.W.2d 821, 823 (Tex.1982) (per curiam). 9 The analysis that leads us to the\nconclusion we reach here, however, compels us to overrule Texas Industrial Traffic League and\ndisapprove of all cases relying on it to the extent that they conflict with this opinion. 10 Although\nour concern for the rule of stare decisis makes us hesitant to overrule any case, when constitutional\nprinciples are at issue this court as a practical matter is the only government institution with the\npower and duty to correct such errors. See Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, –––– – ––––, 111\nS.Ct. 2597, 2609–11, 115 L.Ed.2d 720 (1991) (observing that reexamination of constitutional\ndecisions is appropriate when “correction through legislative action is practically impossible”).\n\nConsequently, we proceed to determine here, on our own motion, whether TAB has standing to\nbring this suit.\n\n [9] [10] Because standing is a component of subject matter jurisdiction, we consider TAB's\nstanding under the same standard by which we review subject matter jurisdiction generally. That\nstandard requires the pleader to allege facts that affirmatively demonstrate the court's jurisdiction\nto hear the cause. Richardson v. First Nat'l Life Ins. Co., 419 S.W.2d 836, 839 (Tex.1967). When\nreviewing a trial court order dismissing a cause for want of jurisdiction, Texas appellate courts\n“construe the pleadings in favor of the plaintiff and look to the pleader's intent.” Huston v. Federal\nDeposit Ins. Corp., 663 S.W.2d 126, 129 (Tex.App.—Eastland 1983, writ ref'd n.r.e. 1984); see\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Wendell Hall, Standards of Appellate Review in Civil Appeals, 21 ST. MARY'S L.J. 865,\n870 (1990).\n\n [11] Here, however, we are not reviewing a trial court order of dismissal for want of jurisdiction,\nwe are considering standing for the first time on appeal. A review of only the pleadings to\ndetermine subject matter jurisdiction is sufficient in the trial court because a litigant has a right to\namend to attempt to cure pleading defects if jurisdictional facts are not alleged. See TEX.R.CIV.P.\n80. Failing that, the suit is dismissed. When an appellate court questions jurisdiction on appeal\nfor the first time, however, there is no opportunity to cure the defect. Therefore, when a Texas\nappellate court reviews the standing of a party sua sponte, it must construe the petition in favor of\nthe party, and if necessary, review the entire record to determine if any evidence supports standing.\n\n [12] TAB asserts standing on behalf of its members. The general test for standing in Texas\nrequires that there “(a) shall be a real controversy between the parties, which (b) will be actually\ndetermined by the judicial declaration sought.” Board of Water Engineers v. City of San Antonio,\n155 Tex. 111, 114, 283 S.W.2d 722, 724 (1955). Texas, however, has no particular test for\ndetermining the standing of an organization, such as TAB. See e.g., *447 Touchy v. Houston\nLegal Found., 432 S.W.2d 690, 694 (Tex.1968); Texas Highway Comm'n v. Texas Ass'n of Steel\nImporters, Inc., 372 S.W.2d 525, 530–31 (Tex.1963). While we agree with the statement of the\ngeneral test for standing set out in Board of Water Engineers, we foresee difficulties in relying on\nit alone to determine the standing of an organization like TAB. For instance, when members of an\norganization have individual standing, but the organization was not established for the purpose of\nprotecting the particular interest at issue, it is not necessarily in the members' best interest to allow\nsuch a disinterested organization to sue on their behalf. Furthermore, an organization should not\nbe allowed to sue on behalf of its members when the claim asserted requires the participation of\nthe members individually rather than as an association, such as when the members seek to recover\nmoney damages and the amount of damages varies with each member.\n\n [13] The United States Supreme Court has articulated a standard for associational standing that\nlends itself to our use. We adopt that test today. In Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising\nCommission, the Court held that an association has standing to sue on behalf of its members when\n“(a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the interests it seeks\nto protect are germane to the organization's purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the\nrelief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.” 432 U.S. 333,\n343, 97 S.Ct. 2434, 2441, 53 L.Ed.2d 383 (1977); see also New York State Club Ass'n v. City of\nNew York, 487 U.S. 1, 9, 108 S.Ct. 2225, 2231, 101 L.Ed.2d 1 (1988); International Union, United\nAuto., Aerospace and Agric. Implement Workers of Am. v. Brock, 477 U.S. 274, 282, 106 S.Ct.\n2523, 2528, 91 L.Ed.2d 228 (1986). This standard incorporates the standing analysis we adopted\nin Board of Water Engineers, yet addresses the additional concerns we have noted.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\n [14] We now apply the Hunt standard to the case before us. Reviewing the record in its entirety\nfor evidence supporting subject matter jurisdiction, and resolving any doubt in TAB's favor, we\nconclude that TAB has standing to pursue the relief it seeks in this case.\n\nThe first prong of the Hunt test requires that TAB's pleadings and the rest of the record demonstrate\nthat TAB's members have standing to sue in their own behalf. This requirement should not be\ninterpreted to impose unreasonable obstacles to associational representation. In this regard the\nUnited States Supreme Court stated that “the purpose of the first part of the Hunt test is simply to\nweed out plaintiffs who try to bring cases, which could not otherwise be brought, by manufacturing\nallegations of standing that lack any real foundation.” New York State Club Ass'n, 487 U.S. at 9,\n108 S.Ct. at 2232. We are satisfied that TAB has not manufactured this lawsuit. A comparison of\nthe association's membership roster with the list of businesses subjected to state penalties indicates\nindividual TAB members have been assessed administrative penalties pursuant to the challenged\nenactments. Additionally, TAB has alleged that other of its members remain at substantial risk of\npenalty. A substantial risk of injury is sufficient under Hunt. See e.g., Pennell v. City of San Jose,\n485 U.S. 1, 7 n. 3, 108 S.Ct. 849, 855 n. 3, 99 L.Ed.2d 1 (1988) (concluding that association of\nlandlords had standing based on pleadings that individual members would likely be harmed by\nrent ordinance). Thus TAB satisfies the first prong of the Hunt test.\n\nThe second prong of Hunt requires that TAB's pleadings and the rest of the record demonstrate\nthat the interests TAB seeks to protect are germane to the organization's purpose. TAB was\nchartered to “represent the interests of its members on issues which may impact upon its members'\nbusinesses.” Considering a very similar question in New York State Club Association, the United\nStates Supreme Court held that: “[T]he associational interests that the consortium seeks to protect\nare germane to its purpose: appellant's certificate of incorporation states that its purpose is ‘to\npromote the common business interests of its *448 [member clubs].’ ” 487 U.S. at 10 n. 4, 108\nS.Ct. at 2232, n. 4 (bracketed language in original). Likewise, the interests TAB desires to protect\nare germane to the organization's purpose, and thus the second prong is met.\n\nUnder the third and final prong of the Hunt test, TAB's pleadings and the record must demonstrate\nthat neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested require the participation of individual\nmembers in the lawsuit. The Supreme Court has interpreted this prong as follows:\n\n            [W]hether an association has standing to invoke the court's remedial powers on\n            behalf of its members depends in substantial measure on the nature of the relief\n            sought. If in a proper case the association seeks a declaration, injunction, or\n            some other form of prospective relief, it can reasonably be supposed that the\n            remedy, if granted, will inure to the benefit of those members of the association\n            actually injured.\n\nHunt, 432 U.S. at 343, 97 S.Ct. at 2441 (quoting Warth, 422 U.S. at 515, 95 S.Ct. at 2213).\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\n\nBy seeking damages on behalf of its members, necessitating that each individual prove lost profits\nparticular to its operations, the organization in Warth lacked standing to sue; rather, each individual\nmember had to be a party to the suit. These facts are distinguishable from Brock, in which the\nunion challenged an administrative interpretation of statutory provisions relating to unemployment\ncompensation. 477 U.S. 274, 106 S.Ct. 2523. Recognizing that the suit raised “a pure question of\nlaw,” and that “the individual circumstances” of any aggrieved member were not in issue, the Court\nheld that the UAW had standing to challenge the government's actions. Id. at 287–88, 290, 106\nS.Ct. at 2531–32, 2533; see also Pennell, 485 U.S. at 7 n. 3, 108 S.Ct. at 855 n. 3 (facial challenge\nto rent ordinance does not require participation of individual landlords). Here, TAB seeks only\nprospective relief, raises only issues of law, and need not prove the individual circumstances of\nits members to obtain that relief, thus meeting the third prong of Hunt.\n\nHaving found that TAB meets all three prongs of the Hunt test, we conclude that TAB has standing\nto pursue the relief it seeks in this case.\n\n\n\n                                                II. Open Courts\n\nTAB contends that the forfeiture provisions of the statutes and regulations in question violate the\nopen courts provision of the Texas Constitution by unreasonably restricting access to the courts.\nAfter the agency has found a party to be in violation of any of these statutes and regulations, the\noffender must either tender a cash deposit or post a supersedeas bond in the full amount of the\npenalties assessed, or forfeit the right to judicial review. 11\n\nHistorically, we have recognized at least three separate constitutional guarantees emanating\nfrom our open courts provision. First, courts must actually be open and operating, so that, for\nexample, the legislature must place every county within a judicial district. Runge & Co. v.\nWyatt, 25 Tex.Supp. 294 (1860). Second, citizens must have access to those courts unimpeded by\nunreasonable financial barriers, so that the legislature cannot impose a litigation tax in the form\nof increased filing fees to enhance the state's general revenue, LeCroy v. Hanlon, 713 S.W.2d\n335, 342 (Tex.1986). Finally, meaningful legal remedies must be afforded to our citizens, so\nthat the legislature may not abrogate the right to assert a well-established common law cause of\naction unless the reason for its action outweighs the litigants' constitutional right of redress. Sax\nv. Votteler, 648 S.W.2d 661, 665–66 (Tex.1983).\n\n[15] Here the second guarantee is applicable. This is not a question of the abrogation of any\nwell-established common law *449 cause of action, 12 just as it is not a question of the physical\nabsence of a court to which a complaint may be brought. The issue before us is access to the\ncourts. In previous cases involving this issue, we did not predicate our decision on whether the\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    9\n\fTexas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nparty whose access had been restricted was attempting to assert a common law cause of action. In\nLeCroy, for example, the court did not permit increased filing fees for statutory causes of action\nwhile denying them for common law claims. 713 S.W.2d 335. Likewise in Dillingham v. Putnam,\nwhen the court struck down a statute requiring a supersedeas bond as a condition of appeal, the\ncourt did not concern itself with whether the particular appeal being restricted involved a common\nlaw or statutory claim. 109 Tex. 1, 14 S.W. 303 (1890). Similarly, in the present case, the issue is\nsimply whether the prepayment requirement is an unreasonable financial barrier to access to the\ncourts in light of the state interest involved.\n\nThe stated purpose of the regulatory statutes at issue here is to protect our state's natural\nresources. 13 There is no question that this is an important state interest. 14 The state argues that\nthe prepayment provisions further this interest by increasing the deterrent effect of the penalties\nand by aiding in their collection. The state maintains that a violator will be less deterred by an\nadministrative penalty if it can delay payment without bond while appealing the case in the courts.\nThe state also argues that delay may render the penalty uncollectible, as the violator may become\ninsolvent.\n\nIn considering these rationales, we note that the prepayment provisions actually consist of two\nelements. First, the assessed penalty must be paid, or financial security provided, within thirty\ndays; enforcement is not stayed pending any period of judicial review. 15 Second, if payment is\nnot made or financial security provided within the thirty-day period, the right to judicial review\nis forfeited. We agree that the rationales advanced by the state justify the first of these elements.\nRequiring expeditious payment of the administrative penalties increases their effectiveness. The\nlegislature, however, could have imposed the first element without the second. It could have\nprovided the agency with the right to collection of assessed penalties unless a supersedeas bond\nis posted, yet provided for judicial review. The requirement of immediate payment, without the\ncorresponding forfeiture provision, would not have implicated the open courts provision, as the\ncharged party could have obtained judicial review regardless of payment. This approach would\nhave been in accordance with the usual procedure governing appeals of trial court judgments.\nSee TEX.R.APP.P. 40. Any litigant may appeal without superseding the trial court's judgment,\nbut the mere pendency of an appeal does not stay enforcement of the judgment. 16 *450 Our\nspecific focus for purposes of our open courts analysis, therefore, is not whether the requirement\nof immediate payment is reasonable, but whether the forfeiture of the right of judicial review, if\nthe penalties are not superseded, is reasonable.\n\nWe conclude that the forfeiture provision is an unreasonable restriction on access to the courts.\nWhile the requirement of prepayment or the posting of a bond to stay enforcement furthers the\nstate's important environmental interests by creating a strong incentive for timely payment of\nthe assessed penalties, the forfeiture provision serves no additional interest. 17 The state may\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\naccomplish its goals by enforcing the prepayment requirements without infringing on a party's\nright to its day in court. Accordingly, we hold that forfeiture sections of the statutes and regulations\nat issue facially violate our open courts provision. 18\n\n\n\n                                                 III. Jury Trial\n\nTAB also claims that the statutes empowering these agencies to assess civil penalties violate the\nright to a jury trial guaranteed by the Texas Constitution. 19 We disagree.\n\nArticle I, section 15 of our constitution 20 preserves a right to trial by jury for those actions, or\nanalogous actions, tried to a jury at the time the constitution of 1876 was adopted. E.g., State v.\nCredit Bureau of Laredo, 530 S.W.2d 288, 291 (Tex.1975); White v. White, 108 Tex. 570, 196\nS.W. 508 (1917); Hatten v. City of Houston, 373 S.W.2d 525 (Tex.Civ.App.—Houston 1963, writ\nref'd n.r.e.); Hickman v. Smith, 238 S.W.2d 838 (Tex.Civ.App.—Austin 1951, writ ref'd). A jury\ntrial is not mandated by this provision for any other judicial proceeding. Id.\n\n [16] In Credit Bureau, we concluded that a suit for civil penalties for violation of an injunction\nissued pursuant to the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act was analogous to the common law\naction for debt, tried to a jury at the time our constitution was adopted. 530 S.W.2d at 293.\nThus, we held that the right to a jury trial for that action remained inviolate. Id. We observed\nin Credit Bureau, however, that in certain types of adversary proceedings the constitutional\nright to a jury trial does not attach. Among the proceedings we referred to are appeals from\nadministrative decisions. 21 Id. (citing State v. De Silva, 105 Tex. 95, 145 S.W. 330 (1912),\nand *451 Texas Liquor Control Bd. v. Jones, 112 S.W.2d 227 (Tex.Civ.App.—Houston 1937,\nwrit ref'd n.r.e.)). Consistent with this noted exception in Credit Bureau, we conclude that these\nagencies' assessments of environmental penalties are not actions, or analogous actions, to those\ntried to a jury at the time the constitution of 1876 was adopted. To hold that these environmental\nstatutes and regulations promulgated in the late 1960s merely parrot common law and statutory\nrights triable to a jury in 1876 would turn a blind eye to the emergence of the modern administrative\nstate and its profound impact on our legal and social order. In the late 19th century, ours was\nprimarily a sparsely-populated agrarian society. See generally, T.R. Fehrenbach, Lone Star: A\nHistory of Texas and the Texans, 279–324 (1983). By contrast, concentrated industrial activity and\nits by-products, including the wide-spread emission of pollutants, with their resulting potential for\nsignificant damage to our natural resources are phenomena of relatively recent origin. In response\nto such phenomena, regulatory schemes, such as those challenged here, were designed to balance\nmounting environmental concerns with our state's economic vitality. In 1876 no governmental\nschemes akin to these existed. 22 Thus, we conclude that the contested proceedings are not\nanalogous to any action tried to a jury in 1876. Accordingly, we hold that no right to a jury\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   11\n\fTexas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\ntrial attaches to appeals from administrative adjudications under the environmental statutes and\nregulations at issue here. 23\n\nWe should not be misunderstood to say that the legislature may abrogate the right to trial by\njury in any case by delegating duties to an administrative agency. Here, we simply reaffirm what\nthis court held almost a half century ago, in Corzelius v. Harrell, 143 Tex. 509, 186 S.W.2d\n961 (1945). In Corzelius, we concluded that certain judicial functions, including fact finding,\nmay be delegated constitutionally by the legislature to administrative agencies in furtherance of\nthe preservation and conservation of the state's natural resources. The decision in Corzelius was\nbased on article XVI, section 59(a) of our constitution, which provides in relevant part: “The\nconservation and development of all the natural resources of this State ... and the preservation and\nconservation of all such natural resources ... are each and all ... public rights and duties; and the\nLegislature shall pass all such laws as may be appropriate thereto.” TEX. CONST. art. XVI, §\n59(a). “By the use of the broad language used in Article XVI, Section 59(a),” the court stated, “the\nLegislature is authorized to enact such laws as are necessary to carry out the purposes for which\nsuch constitutional amendment was adopted.” Corzelius, 186 S.W.2d at 964. 24\n\n [17] There is no doubt that the legislature delegated the power to assess these civil penalties\nto the Air Control Board and the Water Commission as a manifestation of the public's interest\nin preserving and conserving the state's air and water resources. That intent is apparent from the\npolicy statements of the relevant statutes. 25 *452 We conclude, therefore, that the delegation of\nthe fact-finding function by the legislature to the Air Control Board and the Water Commission\nunder this statutory scheme was within the legislature's constitutional authority.\n\nOf course, the fact that no jury trial is provided by the legislature to an alleged violator of these\nenvironmental protection laws does not mean that the agencies' power to assess penalties is\nunbridled. 26 The Air Control Board and the Water Commission may act only within constitutional\nand statutory parameters.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, we reverse that portion of the trial court's judgment declaring that\nsection 4.041 of the Texas Clean Air Act, sections 26.136 and 27.1015 of the Texas Water Code,\nand section 8b of the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act and the rules and regulations promulgated\nunder those statutes comport with the open courts provision of our constitution, article I, section 13.\nWe declare that the requirement of a supersedeas bond or cash deposit paid into an escrow account\nas a prerequisite to judicial review under TEX.HEALTH & SAFETY CODE §§ 361.252(m)\n(first clause), 382.089(c) (first sentence), and TEX.WATER CODE § 26.136(k) (first sentence)\nis unconstitutional. We affirm that portion of the trial court's judgment declaring that the listed\nstatutes, rules, and regulations do not violate the jury trial provision of our constitution, article\nI, section 15.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

If the mess is\nbig enough, if the stench is strong enough, no matter how great the danger to public health and\nsafety, an industrial litterer can “mess” with Texas without fear of immediate punishment or legally\neffective citizen action.\n\nAnd what an occasion for permitting polluters to “mess” with Texas air and water. Our state tops\nthe nation in total toxic emissions and ranks dead last among the fifty states in important measures\nof environmental quality. 1 Although last in air *453 and water cleanliness, Texas today becomes\nthe first state to strike down the imposition of penalties by administrative agencies to enforce\nstatutes protecting the environment. I dissent from today's manipulation of the law to paralyze anti-\npollution efforts, tragically announced at a time when protecting the quality of the air we breathe\nand the water we drink is so critical.\n\nToday's opinion delivers a double whammy to protection of our natural resources. Polluters are\nfirst shielded from swift punishment for harming our environment, and then the courthouse door\nis slammed shut in the face of Texans who organize to object. Incredibly, this second punch was\nnot even sought by the corporate organization that brought this challenge; it was wholly designed\nby the majority during the three years that this cause has lingered in this court. Announced today is\nan easily manipulable “friends in, foes out” rule to prevent further actions by those who organize\nto protect taxpayers, consumers or the environment.\n\nThrough its broad writing designed to eviscerate administrative enforcement of our state's\nenvironmental laws, the majority has also created significant new uncertainties for a wide range\nof state governmental activity—tax collection is imperiled, laws to protect nursing home residents\nare effectively voided, and even a leading weapon in the war on drugs is threatened. At a time\nof budgetary crisis exacerbated by the majority's great misadventure in public school finance, 2\ntoday's opinion raises a substantial question of whether the State will be required to return to those\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Hidden within its lengthy legal mumbo-jumbo\nis an unprecedented blow to our jury system. The constitutional right of trial by jury, already\nsuffering at the hands of this majority, is no longer inviolate; it may be abrogated at any time.\nInstead of walking into a courthouse, where a jury is guaranteed, citizens may be detoured to\nan administrative agency, to explain their problems to bureaucrats not directly answerable to the\ncommunity.\n\nToday precedent and tradition have been trampled as the majority's long-standing fear of ordinary\npeople in our legal system has taken firm hold. The drafters of our Texas Constitution realized\nsomething that the majority has long ceased to appreciate—ordinary Texans can make an\nextraordinary contribution to our system of justice. The more their collective voice expressed in\na jury verdict is disregarded, the more new barriers are contrived to shut them out of our system\nof justice, the less justice that system will offer.\n\n\n\n                                                I. Open Courts\n\nThe ability of state agencies to enforce environmental laws through the assessment of\nadministrative penalties is declared unconstitutional by the majority as contradicting our state\nguarantee of open courts. While concluding that TAB certainly has a right to judicial review on\nbehalf of its members, I disagree that the statutory restrictions it challenges unreasonably restrict\naccess to the courts.\n\nAccess to the courts is unquestionably a fundamental constitutional and common law right. Article\nI, section 13 of the Texas Constitution forms the nucleus of this protection:\n\n             *454 The open courts provision specifically guarantees all litigants the right to\n            redress their grievances—to use a popular and correct phrase, the right to their\n            day in court. This right is a substantial state constitutional right.\n\nLeCroy v. Hanlon, 713 S.W.2d 335, 341 (Tex.1986) (citations omitted). This court has a long\nhistory of assuring that the right of access remains guaranteed to Texas citizens. 3\n\nIn Sax v. Votteler, 648 S.W.2d 661 (Tex.1983), we required a litigant alleging an unconstitutional\ndenial of access to the courts to show that: (1) a cognizable common law cause of action is being\nrestricted and (2) the limitation is unreasonable or arbitrary when balanced against the purpose\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                14\n\fTexas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nand basis of the statute. The majority today appropriately eliminates the first showing in certain\ncases. In some circumstances the distinction between common law and statutory causes of action\nclearly does not affect whether access to the courts has been denied.\n\nThe second part of the Sax test, however, continues to be applied in all open courts cases. 4 Thus,\nin determining whether the open courts provision of the Texas Constitution is violated by the\nrequirement that administrative penalties be paid as a prerequisite to judicial review, we must\nbalance two competing interests: the right of TAB's members to access to the courts and the state's\nconcern with effective and timely enforcement of its laws protecting the environment. The majority\ntoday restates in rather vague terms this second prong: “whether the prepayment requirement is\nan unreasonable financial barrier to access to the courts in light of the state interest involved.” 852\nS.W.2d at 449. As we held in LeCroy:\n\n\n   Because a substantial right is involved, the legislature cannot arbitrarily or unreasonably\n   interfere with a litigant's right of access to the courts. Thus, the general open courts provision\n   test balances the legislature's actual purpose in enacting the law against that law's interference\n   with the individual's right of access to the courts. The government has the burden to show that\n   the legislative purpose outweighs the interference with the individual's right of access.\n   713 S.W.2d at 341 (citations omitted; emphasis supplied).\nApplying this test, we have permitted certain restrictions on access to the courts, while disallowing\nothers. Compare LeCroy, 713 S.W.2d at 341 (court filing fee unreasonably restricts access to\njudicial system), and Dillingham v. Putnam, 109 Tex. 1, 14 S.W. 303 (1890) (supersedeas bond\nas prerequisite to appeal, without regard to ability to pay, unconstitutional), with Clanton v.\nClark, 639 S.W.2d 929 (Tex.1982) (court may constitutionally dismiss suit for failure to timely\nfile cost bond), and Federal Crude Oil Co. v. Yount–Lee Oil Co., 122 Tex. 21, 52 S.W.2d 56\n(1932) (requirement that franchise taxes be paid prior to filing suit upheld under article I, § 13);\ncompare Lucas v. United States, 757 S.W.2d 687 (Tex.1988) (limitations on damages for medical\nmalpractice unconstitutional), with Rose v. Doctors Hosp., 801 S.W.2d 841 (Tex.1990) (same\nlimitations upheld under open courts provision in wrongful death cases). I favor a more complete\nand predictable open courts analysis designed to discourage such anomalous results.\n\n *455 Today's implementation of the second prong of the Sax test demonstrates its malleability.\nAfter perfunctorily reciting the purpose of administrative penalties, the majority, without any\nfurther analysis, concludes that: “the forfeiture provision is an unreasonable restriction on access to\nthe courts,” 852 S.W.2d at 450, and “the forfeiture provision serves no additional [state] interest.”\nId. at 450. Enacted by the Legislature as an important means of enforcing our state's environmental\nlaws, these penalties are today judicially extinguished. The majority determines that these laudable\nlegislative objectives are not sufficiently “important” to justify the possibility that the use of\npenalties may perhaps someday impose some slight financial strain on some hypothetical polluter.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\n\nWhether examined under either the vague test employed today or my more exacting formulation,\nthe majority's conclusory analysis suffers from at least three major flaws: (1) a failure to recognize\nthe compelling interest, grounded in our state constitution, served by administrative penalties,\nincluding prepayment provisions; (2) a disregard of the extensive statutory constraints on penalty\nusage which represents the least restrictive means to achieve this purpose; and (3) an assumption\nthat the prepayment provision interferes with individual access to the courts unsupported by even\na single specific instance of such a restrictive effect.\n\nThe balancing required by Sax mandates careful consideration of the rights being affected. The\nmore significant the right the litigant asserts, the more onerous the government's burden becomes.\nTAB has asserted a right to judicial review of penalties imposed against its members. This interest\nis encompassed within the right of access to the courts, which we declared a “substantial state\nconstitutional right.” LeCroy, 713 S.W.2d at 341.\n\nThe State has met its burden by demonstrating a compelling interest in employing administrative\npenalties reflected in constitutionally-guaranteed protection of our state's natural resources.\nAlthough not critical in overcoming an open courts challenge, a constitutional predicate for the\nstate's interest is a highly persuasive factor in the balancing process. As declared in article XVI,\nsection 59(a) 5 :\n\n\n  [T]he preservation and conservation of all ... natural resources of the State are each and all\n  declared public rights and duties; and the Legislature shall pass all laws as may be appropriate\n  thereto.\n  This very mandate of the people, as well as protection of the public health and safety was\n   effectuated in the Clean Air Act, 6 the Texas Water Code, 7 and the Solid Waste Disposal Act, 8\n   including the right to assess administrative penalties. Protection of Texas' air, water and land\n   is undeniably a compelling interest.\n *456 The form of these particular administrative penalties has certainly been fashioned to serve\nthis important state interest through the least restrictive means. Penalty usage is substantially\nlimited and can in no way be said to be arbitrarily imposed. All three statutes at issue require\nthat, once a violation is established, the agency assessing a penalty must consider such factors as\nthe seriousness of the violation, including but not limited to the nature, circumstance, extent, and\ngravity of the prohibited acts; the hazard or potential hazard created to the public health or safety\nof the public; the history of previous violation; the amount necessary to deter future violations; and\nefforts to correct the violation. 9 There is thus statutory assurance that the amount of any resulting\npenalties will be directly related to the conduct.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nRequiring that assessed penalties be paid, or a bond in the same amount be posted, prior to\nchallenging the agency action in court is not unreasonable under these circumstances. Unlike the\nfiling fee held violative of the open courts provision in LeCroy, the legislative purpose is not to\nraise money by making it more expensive for citizens to enforce their legal rights. Instead, the\nlegislative objective is to deter and punish violations of the law that pose an environmental threat.\n\nThe wheels of justice grind slowly, with final resolution often years in reaching. Indeed, in\nthis court they sometimes hardly grind at all. Clearly those willing to profit from polluting our\nnatural resources will not hesitate to employ the delays in the judicial system to their advantage.\nA declaration of bankruptcy by a perhaps deliberately undercapitalized corporation during the\npendency of a suit is likely to relieve the polluter of any responsibility to remedy the damage it\nhas caused.\n\nShowing no awareness of the purpose of and need for administrative penalties, the majority finds\nthat “expeditious payment” is adequately guaranteed by the ability of the agency, through the\nattorney general, to initiate an enforcement action to collect the amount assessed. 852 S.W.2d at\n449 & n. 15. In other words, the purpose of immediate deterrence of violation of environmental\nlaws is ensured by the filing of a lawsuit that may take as many years to resolve as this case\nhas. These agencies charged with protecting our natural resources have long had the ability to\nbring an enforcement action in state court. See Tex.Water Code § 26.123; Tex.Health & Safety\nCode § 382.081; id. § 361.224. The effort of the Texas Legislature to improve the effectiveness\nof enforcement through the use of administrative penalties is today rendered a nullity.\n\nGiven the time and expense that must be devoted to pursuing an enforcement action in court, the\nState will have the capability to proceed against only the most egregious wrongs. The vast majority\nof administrative penalties to date have been relatively small, reflecting technical yet important\nstatutory violations. 10 In the absence of an administrative penalty power, most of these would\nhave gone unpunished, even though collectively the environmental impact of small violations\ncould be more profound than a major catastrophe. Relieving polluters from immediate sanctions\ndismantles the effectiveness of our laws protecting natural resources; no lesser means has been\nidentified that provides for prompt enforcement. I would hold that the state has demonstrated a\ncompelling interest in environmental protection that has been implemented by the least restrictive\nmeans, thus overriding any modest impediment that the prepayment of penalties may impose on\naccess to the courts.\n\n *457 Not even the slightest evidence has been provided to this court to suggest any actual\nrestrictive effect. No affidavit of any member of the Texas Association of Business appears in\nthe record stating that an inability to pay an administrative penalty has barred judicial review. As\nto most of the penalties assessed, $5,000 or less in amount, it is doubtful that such a contention\ncould be made. The majority necessarily concludes that imposing fines of $2,000 against Exxon\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nChemical Company, Shell Oil Company and Union Carbide Corporation has left those entities\nfinancially unable to pursue an appeal. 11 While the enormity of some future penalty could in\nfact unconstitutionally bar judicial access, that is certainly not the case here. See Jensen v. State\nTax Comm'n, 835 P.2d 965, 969 (Utah 1992) (payment of assessed taxes, penalties and interest as\nprecondition to suit “not unconstitutional in all cases,” but only those in which taxpayer financially\nbarred from prosecuting appeal); see also Morrison v. Chan, 699 S.W.2d 205, 207 (Tex.1985)\n(medical malpractice statute of limitations not unconstitutional as applied to facts of case).\n\nEliminating the need to prove actual restrictive effect, the majority declares “irrelevant” that “the\naffected parties may be able to afford prepayment.” 852 S.W.2d at 450 n. 18. Unexplained is how\nthis statement can be reconciled with Dillingham, in which this court found of critical importance\nthe failure to accommodate those financially unable to post a supersedeas bond as a prerequisite\nto judicial review. Opining that “the guarantee of constitutional rights should not depend on the\nbalance in one's bank account,” id., the majority would accord our state's largest businesses the\nsame treatment as indigents in avoiding financial responsibility for court and other litigation costs.\n\nNor is the majority restrained by Texas decisional law validating similar requirements. We long\nago upheld against this same type of challenge the condition that a corporation pay its franchise\ntaxes in order to file a court action. Federal Crude Oil Co. v. Yount–Lee Oil Co., 122 Tex. 21,\n52 S.W.2d 56 (1932); accord Rimco Enterprises, Inc. v. Texas Elec. Svc. Co., 599 S.W.2d 362\n(Tex.Civ.App.—Fort Worth 1980, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Various statutory requirements that taxes,\npenalties and interest be paid prior to contesting them in court have likewise sustained an open\ncourts challenge. See Filmstrips and Slides, Inc. v. Dallas Central Appraisal Dist., 806 S.W.2d\n289 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1991, no writ) (property taxes); Robinson v. Bullock, 553 S.W.2d 196\n(Tex.Civ.App.—Austin 1977, writ ref'd n.r.e.), cert. denied, 436 U.S. 918, 98 S.Ct. 2264, 56\nL.Ed.2d 759 (1978) (sales taxes).\n\nThe majority also ignores the certainty that far more than three statutes are impacted by today's\ndecision. A broad range of regulatory enforcement programs vital to protection of the public health\nand safety will be stripped of their most timely and effective sanctions to deter harmful conduct.\nLaws designed to protect the old—residents in nursing homes 12 —the young—our children away\nat camp 13 —the sick and the injured, 14 and those we have lost 15 will be substantially weakened.\nOthers, ensuring the sanitariness of food, drugs and cosmetics, 16 as well as the slaughter and\n*458 disposition of dead animals, 17 will be similarly rendered less effective. 18 Even where such\npenalties have not been frequently enforced, their potential use may promote law enforcement.\n\nThe most widespread damage, however, from today's decision will be in the enforcement of\nlaws protecting our environment, where the Legislature has determined again and again that such\npenalties are the most effective means of assuring compliance and preventing pollution of our\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nair, water and land. 19 The majority ensures that those who pollute will be brought to justice very\nslowly or not at all.\n\nOther statutes that impose administrative penalties permit the filing of an affidavit of inability to\npay in lieu of prepayment or the posting of a bond. 20 Because the majority's reasoning strikes\ndown administrative penalties without reference to financial ability, 852 S.W.2d at 451, these\nstatutes similarly cannot be enforced.\n\nToday's writing poses a potentially crippling effect for collection of taxes. All of our state statutes\nin this area require that assessed taxes, penalty and interest be prepaid before a suit challenging\nthem may be filed. See generally Tex.Tax Code §§ 112.051, 112.101. If such requirements are\nunconstitutionally void even to fulfill a constitutional mandate of environmental protection, their\nvalidity for tax collection is certainly subject to question. See R Communications, Inc. v. Sharp,\n839 S.W.2d 947 (Tex.App.—Austin 1992, writ granted).\n\nNor has the majority sought to consider the consequences of its decision for a major weapon in the\nwar against drugs, forfeiting prior to judicial review money, vehicles and other property alleged to\nhave been used in violating our criminal laws. Tex.Crim.Proc.Code art. 59.02–.11. Most frequently\ninvoked to seize assets from drug dealers, such as money and cars that could finance their defense,\nthis statute provides for the return of property prior to trial only *459 on the posting of a bond\nfor the full value. Id. art. 59.02(b).\n\nProcedures within our judicial system are also threatened. Why is not the requirement that\ncorporations and other organizations appear in court only through counsel a violation of the\nopen courts provision, since the cost of retaining an attorney in most cases exceeds the average\nadministrative penalty considered here?\n\nInadequately considered by the majority's opinion is its effect on the millions of dollars\nin administrative penalties that have already been paid under the statutes now declared\nunconstitutional. Yet, under the general rule that our decisions apply retroactively, past violators of\nenvironmental laws may stand to reap a substantial windfall. 21 In the firm grasp of this majority,\n“open courts” may have been rewritten to mean open coffers. While claiming that nothing in\ntoday's writing suggests that a refund is required, the majority apparently once again concludes that\nmonies extracted by the state under the coercion of an unconstitutional system may be retained.\nSee Carrollton–Farmers Indep. Sch. Dist., 826 S.W.2d at 515–23 (holding tax unconstitutional,\nbut requiring taxpayers to continue payment for two years).\n\nThe majority today throws a large wrench into the workings of the important administrative\nmechanism of our Texas government. By severely limiting enforcement powers, the majority\nleaves law enforcers little choice but to forego prosecution of law violators. Our laws designed\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Trial by Jury\n\nThe harm caused to our environment by today's writing is equalled only by the severe blow struck\nagainst our fundamental right of trial by jury. In holding that TAB and its members have no right to\na jury trial, the majority employs an analysis that has far-reaching ramifications. While I recognize\nthe need to accommodate the evolution of the administrative state, the history of this important\nguarantee mandates that only the narrowest of exceptions be permitted.\n\nThe ability of each individual to have a case heard by other members of the community is a vital\npart of our heritage and law. Long ago, Texans emphasized the paramount importance of this\nguarantee, stating in their grievances against the Mexican government:\n\n            It has failed and refused to secure, on a firm basis, the right of trial by jury,\n            that palladium of civil liberty, and only safe guarantee for the life, liberty, and\n            property of the citizen.\n\nThe Declaration of Independence of the Republic of Texas (1836), reprinted in Tex.Const.app.\n519, 520 (Vernon 1955). A strong guarantee of this right had been unsuccessfully sought in an\n1833 draft constitution, 22 which was submitted to Mexico by Stephen F. Austin 23 and was later\nincorporated in the 1836 Texas Independence Constitution. 24\n\nThe central role of the jury as a democratic institution was firmly recognized, indeed celebrated,\nin our early jurisprudence by the Supreme Court of the Republic of Texas:\n\n            The institution of jury trial has, perhaps, seldom or never been fully appreciated.\n            It has been often eulogized in sounding *460 phrase, and often decried and\n            derided. An occasional corrupt, or biased, or silly verdict is not enough for\n            condemnation; and when it is said the institution interposes chances of justice\n            and checks against venality and oppression, the measure of just praise is not\n            filled. Its immeasurable benefits, like the perennial springs of the earth, flow\n            from the fact that considerable portions of the communities at stated periods are\n            called into the courts to sit as judges of contested facts, and under the ministry\n            of the courts to apply the laws.... Let us then preserve and transmit this mode of\n            trial not only inviolate, but if possible purified and perfected.\n\nBailey v. Haddy, Dallam 35, 40–41 (Tex.1841). 25\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 20\n\fTexas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\n\nIn 1845, expanding the scope of this right was the subject of spirited debate in the deliberations\nover the new constitution for statehood. In addition to the previous guarantee, which was carried\nforward in a new Bill of Rights, 26 further protection was included in the Judiciary Article. Tex.\nConst. art. IV, § 16 (1845). While under our national Constitution and those of almost all of our\nsister states trial by jury is available only for those actions that could have been brought at common\nlaw, the Texas Constitution since 1845 has also preserved that right in cases that historically would\nhave been brought in equity. Thus, even when a private party seeks injunctive relief that will\ninure to the public's benefit, any derogation of the right to a jury nonetheless violates the Texas\nConstitution.\n\nUrging support of the additional Judiciary Article guarantee, Convention President Thomas Rusk\ndeclared:\n\n            It is a dangerous principle to trust too much power in the hands of one man.\n            Would it not be better to trust a power of this nature in the hands of twelve men,\n            than to confide it to the breast of one?\n\nWilliam F. Weeks, Debates of the Texas Convention 268 (1846). He was opposed by John\nHemphill, later the first Chief Justice of this court, who actually “preferred the civil law” system,\nid. at 271–73, and Jefferson County delegate James Armstrong, who insisted the new section would\n“operate very injuriously.” Id. at 270. He declared:\n\n            It would be better, in my opinion, to leave it to the legislature to apply these\n            things; it is enough for us to say in the constitution that the trial by jury shall be\n            preserved inviolate. If we intend the jury to determine every thing, it would be\n            better to dispense with the judge altogether, as a useless appendage of the court.\n\nId. Today it is this same fear of juries, fortunately rejected in 1845, that now unfortunately prevails.\n\nThe original language providing for trial by jury in the Judiciary Article of 1845 was retained\nin later constitutions, Tex. Const. art. IV, § 16 (1861), Tex. Const. art. IV, § 20 (1866), but was\nthereafter extended to “all cases of law or equity.” Tex. Const. art. V, § 16 (1869). It took its final\nform in our present Constitution of 1876, which continues to afford not one but two assurances\non this vital subject:\n\n            In the trial of all causes in the District Courts, the plaintiff or defendant shall,\n            upon application made in open court, have the right to trial by jury....\n\nTex. Const. art. V, § 10.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    21\n\fTexas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nThe right of trial by jury shall remain inviolate.\nTex. Const. art. I, § 15. Rather than keeping it “inviolate,” the majority today severely violates\nthis right.\n\n *461 Our heritage is now rejected by the majority in favor of a deliberately overbroad writing\nthat treats trial by jury as a mere anachronism. This is consistent with the majority's increasing\ndisfavor of decisionmaking by ordinary citizens composed as a jury. 27 Today's opinion insists that\nour constitutional assurance of trial by jury does not offer protection against legislative delegation\nof factfinding to an administrative bureaucracy. In essence, the majority engages in a massive\nredistribution of power from the people to the bureaucratic arm of state government. This extreme\nposition is totally unjustified in view of the staunch legal and historical underpinnings of our\nconstitutional commitment to afford Texans a jury of their peers.\n\nToday's opinion accurately describes one element of the dual constitutional protection for this\nfundamental liberty:\n\n            Article I, section 15 of our constitution preserves a right to trial by jury for those\n            actions, or analogous actions, tried to a jury at the time the constitution of 1876\n            was adopted.\n\n852 S.W.2d at 450 (footnote omitted). Then the majority grossly misconstrues this standard while\nmaking selective and misleading use of jurisprudence developed under the further guarantee of\narticle V.\n\nWith its hangnail sketch of Texas history limited to one historian's very generalized description\nof Texas in the era “between 1835 and 1861”, 28 852 S.W.2d at 450, the majority ignores our\nlongstanding concerns regarding threats to our natural resources. As early as 1860, the Legislature\nacted to penalize polluters, providing that:\n\n\n  If any person ... shall in anywise pollute, or obstruct any water course, lake, pond, marsh or\n  common sewer, or continue such obstruction or pollution so as to render the same unwholesome\n  or offensive to the county, city, town or neighborhood thereabouts, or shall do any act or thing\n  that would be deemed and held to be a nuisance at common law, shall be ... fined in any sum\n  not exceeding five hundred dollars.... 29\nIn an early decision considering whether a criminal nuisance was posed by a tallow factory\nnear Galveston at which cattle were slaughtered and their carcasses and offal were allowed to\naccumulate, this court stated:\n\n            It requires no aid of the common law to convince any one accustomed to pure\n            air, and who has been brought by accident or necessity within the sickening\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

[those] so\n            offending should be indicted and punished to the extent of the law.\n\nAllen v. State, 34 Tex. 230, 233–34 (1871). How significantly has this court's once vigorous\nenforcement of anti-pollution laws waned.\n\nDefilement of the environment was not only made punishable as a crime, but also subject to a\ncommon law action for nuisance. See generally Horace Wood, Wood's Law of Nuisances 501–\n21, 576–692 (2d ed. 1883) (discussing nuisance recovery at common law for various forms of air\nand water pollution). Such actions were regularly brought in Texas before 1876 to halt activities\nharmful to our air and water. In 1856, this court recognized that “[w]hat constitutes a nuisance\nis well defined.” 30 *462 Burditt v. Swenson, 17 Tex. 489 (1856). Considering an action to\nenjoin operation of a livery stable on Congress Avenue in Austin because “manure and filth has\nalready accumulated to such an extent, that it now causes an unhealthy and disagreeable effluvia,\nexceedingly offensive and prejudicial,” id. at 492, this court concluded such “noisome smells”\nconstituted a nuisance. Id. at 502–03. In City of Fort Worth v. Crawford, 74 Tex. 404, 12 S.W.\n52, 54 (1889), an individual asserted that, because of the dumping of garbage, filth and bodies of\ndead animals on city land,\n\n\n  his home was rendered almost uninhabitable; his family and himself were kept in bad health;\n  and he was, in the language of a witness, “a walking skeleton.”\n  This court further observed that\n\n               The stench was so offensive that he had to shut the doors to eat and\n               sleep.... The testimony shows that the filth on this place of deposit was so\n               indescribable, and was so offensive as to make persons sick, and could be\n               perceived a mile away.\n\n  Id. Affirming the judgment declaring the dump a common law nuisance, this court declared:\n\n               There is also no doubt that every person has a right to have the air diffused\n               over his premises free from noxious vapors and noisome smells....\n\n  Id. 31\nThe majority's suggestion that “pollutants ... are phenomena of relatively recent origin,” 852\nS.W.2d at 451, is contradicted by the nineteenth century legislative response of criminalizing\npollution and the common use of the common law of nuisance to fight soiling of the air and water.\nWith the ongoing construction of the railroads, the mining of coal and sulphur, the emergence\nof industry and the nascence of our oil and gas industry, our state's natural resources were by\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Cobb, Industrialization and Southern\nSociety 1877–1984, 128 (1984) (describing pollution relating to increased rail usage, lumbering\nand urban sewage); see also Robert A. Calvert & Arnoldo De Leon, The History of Texas 186–191\n(1990) (discussing the development of Texas industry in the late 1800's, including lumbering, beef\nprocessing and mining); Louis J. Wortham, 5 A History of Texas (1924) (examining industrial\ndevelopment in the nineteenth century). Only the scope and depth of the problem has changed.\nBut even if the fouling of the environment were a recent technological “innovation” of the past\ncentury, that would be irrelevant. As I recently wrote in another context,\n\n            The law is not irretrievably locked in the days before televisions and\n            videocameras, nor limited to operators of telegraphs and horse-drawn carriages.\n\nBoyles v. Kerr (Tex.1992) (Doggett, J., dissenting). There is nothing about technological change\nthat has made trial by jury any less vital. 32\n\nBut because there was no modern bureaucracy in 1876, the majority insists: “no governmental\nschemes akin to these existed.” Id. at 451. While our laws and society have grown more\ncomplicated, the mandate *463 of our constitution has not. As we concluded in State v. Credit\nBureau of Laredo, Inc., 530 S.W.2d 288, 292 (Tex.1975): “The right to a trial by jury is not\nlimited to the precise form of action ... at common law.” If there was an analogous cause of action\nwith a right to jury trial in 1876, then our article I jury trial guarantee requires it today. Yet the\nmajority ignores the fact that even the earliest of pollution statutes was designed to deter and punish\nthose who harm our environment. Our jury trial article is thus decreed as dependent on form, not\nsubstance; not analogy, but exactitude. Under the majority's analysis, Credit Bureau was wrongly\ndecided since a regulatory prohibition against deceptive non-disclosure or ambiguous language\nwith the capacity to deceive was beyond the “deceptive acts” of common law fraud or deceit as\nit existed in 1876.\n\nSeizing upon the rather obvious proposition that the administrative state had not yet been created\nin 1876, the majority concludes that there is no right to trial by jury in judicial review of an\nadministrative proceeding. But under article I it is the nature of the cause of action that controls,\nnot the procedures under which it is enforced. Each of the three statutes considered today defines\n“pollution” of air, water or land to incorporate early nuisance concepts. Tex. Health & Safety\nCode § 382.003(3) (contaminants that “are or may tend to be injurious to or to adversely affect\nhuman health or welfare, animal life, vegetation or property [or] interferes with the normal use and\nenjoyment of animal life, vegetation, or property”); id. § 361.003(44) ( “contamination of any land\nland or surface or subsurface water in the state that renders the land or water harmful, detrimental,\nor injurious to humans, animal life, vegetation”); Tex. Water Code § 26.001(13) (contamination\nthat “renders the water harmful, deterimental, or injurious to humans, animal life, vegetation, or\nproperty”). The majority fails to examine these provisions and makes no attempt to distinguish\ntheir substance from nuisance actions at the time the constitution was adopted.

That the creation of some administrative\nagency was not contemplated in 1876 does not mean that any type of factfinding transferred to that\nagency in 1993 or hereafter is beyond the purview of a jury. With its new approach, the majority\nis only clearing the way for a steady expansion of factfinding and decisionmaking by bureaucracy\nat the expense of trial by jury.\n\nConcluding that no common law action analogous to the assessment of administrative penalties\nexisted in 1876, the majority professes a superficial limit on its holding tied to article XVI, § 59(a)\nof the Texas Constitution, as interpreted in Corzelius v. Harrell, 143 Tex. 509, 186 S.W.2d 961\n(1945). 852 S.W.2d at 451 n. 24. Nothing in this provision affects the determination of whether a\nnuisance action for pollution is analogous to an enforcement action for the same conduct. Clearly,\nthe majority's reasoning rests solely on the fact that no administrative agency was charged in\n1876 with protecting the state's resources. Nor does Corzelius in any way address the right to jury\ntrial. Under the majority's asserted “narrow” holding, the right to trial by jury can be immediately\nabrogated in any case in which natural resources are even remotely involved, including private\ndisputes that this court has held are subject to jury trial, such as those involving mineral ownership,\ncontract rights, or mineral lease terms. See, e.g., Amarillo Oil Co. v. Energy–Agri Prod., Inc., 794\nS.W.2d 20, 26 (Tex.1990).\n\nThe constitutional limitation on legislative power to delegate away the people's right to trial by\njury was amply demonstrated by the writing of this court in White v. White, 108 Tex. 570, 196\nS.W. 508 (1917). There a husband had his wife, who apparently did not contest that she was a\n“lunatic,” committed to a state asylum. Commitment proceedings had been statutorily transferred\nto a “commission” appointed by a county judge and comprised of six members, “as many of\n[whom] shall be physicians as may be possible.” Act of *464 April 8, 1913, 33rd Leg., ch. 163,\nart. 152, 1913 Tex.Gen.Laws 342. Although a review of decisions of other states and of federal\npractice indicated substantial support for what appeared to be a quite reasonable legislative attempt\nto entrust the determination of mental competency to the expertise of the medical profession, 196\nS.W. at 514–15, this Court rightly concluded there that\n\n            trial by jury means something more than a hearing before a commission....\n\nId. 196 S.W. at 511. Such “a hearing before a commission, in lieu of the time-honored trial by\njury, is invalid.” Id. 196 S.W. at 515. Moreover,\n\n            [contrary] reasoning [in other jurisdictions] as to the right of the legislature to\n            dispense with jury trials is not applicable to our judicial system and laws, and it\n            is obnoxious to our [Texas] Constitution....”\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

I maintain that the wholesale transfer of authority for factfinding from juries to the bureaucracy\nannounced here is no less offensive to the rights our Constitution guarantees.\n\nBeginning with the constitutional amendment that led to the creation of the Railroad\nCommission, 33 the use of administrative agencies in Texas has steadily increased. Today this\narm of government implements broad legislative plans regulating many areas of public concern,\nincluding the conduct of public utilities, the development and conservation of energy resources,\nand the protection of the environment.\n\nTo preserve the workings of modern government, some exception for administrative proceedings\nmay be necessary, but it should be drawn narrowly so as not to encompass every conceivable\naction that could arguably be assigned to some existing or future administrative body. And that\nis precisely what, until today, our Texas courts have usually done. In two decisions concerning\nadministrative cancellation of a permit to sell liquor, courts narrowly recognized that no “cause\nof action” was involved. The court in Bradley v. Texas Liquor Control Bd., 108 S.W.2d 300\n(Tex.Civ.App.—Austin 1937, writ ref'd n.r.e.), specifically excluded from its ruling cases “based\nupon a civil right of [an individual] to compensation.” Relying on Bradley, 34 the court in Texas\nLiquor Control Bd. v. Jones, 112 S.W.2d 227, 229–30 (Tex.Civ.App.—Texarkana 1937, no writ),\nnoted that unlike other administrative proceedings that might involve rights of the same character\nas a “cause of action,” the cancellation of a liquor license is a proceeding brought by the state\npursuant to its police power to protect the “welfare, health, peace ... and safety of the people of\nTexas.”\n\nThis concern for “the safety of the people of Texas”—the rights and needs of the public, id., is not\ndissimilar from the doctrine of “public rights” rather imperfectly employed by the federal courts.\nState cancellation of a liquor license essentially represents a “public right.” In Atlas Roofing Co.\nv. Occupational Safety & Health Review Comm'n, 430 U.S. 442, 97 S.Ct. 1261, 51 L.Ed.2d 464\n(1977), the court distinguished between cases involving governmental action to protect the public\nhealth and safety and those involving only private rights:\n\n            At least in cases in which “public rights” are being litigated—e.g., cases in which\n            the government sues in its sovereign capacity to enforce public rights created by\n            statutes ... [the constitutional right to a jury trial] does not prohibit ... assign[ment\n            of] the factfinding function to an administrative forum with which the jury would\n            be incompatible.\n\nId. at 450, 97 S.Ct. at 1266.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nBradley and Jones are also consistent with writings in other jurisdictions strictly excluding from\nany administrative public rights exception actions invoking private *465 rights for which the\nConstitution mandates a right to trial by jury:\n\n            Although the award of general compensatory damages may have substantive\n            effect, in that it deters violation of the regulatory scheme ... when the\n            damages awarded advance a substantial private interest in remuneration that\n            is disproportionate to the concept of public relief, the right to a jury trial is\n            implicated and a jury is required.\n\nMcHugh v. Santa Monica Rent Control Bd., 49 Cal.3d 348, 261 Cal.Rptr. 318, 344, 777 P.2d\n91, 117 (1989) (Panelli, J., concurring); Bishop Coal Co. v. Salyers, 181 W.Va. 71, 380 S.E.2d\n238, 246 (1989) (subjective determinations of damages are constitutionally entrusted to juries);\nBroward County v. La Rosa, 505 So.2d 422, 424 (Fla.1987) (constitutional right to jury precludes\nadministrative awards of unliquidated damages).\n\nFortunately the rights of Texans are not constrained by whether the right to a jury trial was\npreserved in analogous actions in 1876. We have written quite clearly that an even broader right\nto trial by jury is afforded under article V, section 10 than under article I, section 15. 35 State v.\nCredit Bureau of Laredo, Inc., 530 S.W.2d 288, 292 (Tex.1975). Relying on Walsh v. Spencer,\n275 S.W.2d 220, 223 (Tex.Civ.App.—San Antonio 1954, no writ), which described the “much\nbroader guarantee” of the Judiciary Article, and Tolle v. Tolle, 101 Tex. 33, 104 S.W. 1049, 1050\n(1907), which said of the provision, “[l]anguage cannot be more comprehensive than this,” we\nexpressly disapproved of earlier cases “mistakenly” treating the two provisions\n\n\n  as identical in meaning, that is, as protecting the right of trial by jury only as it existed at common\n  law or by statutes in effect at the time of the adoption of the Constitution.\n  530 S.W.2d at 292 (citing Hickman v. Smith, 238 S.W.2d 838 (Tex.Civ.App.—Austin 1951,\n  writ ref'd), as improperly assigning the two provisions equivalent meaning). We held that the\n  Judiciary Article affords a unique right to trial by jury even for causes of action unknown at the\n   time of the Constitution's adoption. Id. 36\nInstead of heeding this holding, the majority seizes upon a citation to a commentary in that writing\nas an excuse to rewrite the Constitution. In the discussion of the article V jury trial guarantee in\nCredit Bureau, which involved no administrative action, we noted a few “isolated” proceedings\nthat do not constitute a “cause” that have been identified on a “case-by-case determination.” Id.\nat 293. We made shorthand reference to a commentator's brief list of exceptions carved from the\notherwise inviolate right to trial by jury. Id. (citing Whitney R. Harris, Jury Trial in Civil Cases—\nA Problem in Constitutional Interpretation, 7 Sw.L.J. 1, 8 (1953) (listing child custody by habeas\ncorpus and adoption proceedings, election contests, and contempt proceedings)). Additionally,\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    27\n\fTexas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nHarris relied upon Jones for the broader proposition that proceedings originally brought before\nadministrative agencies are excepted from constitutional jury rights. 7 Sw.L.J. at 12–13. 37\n\n *466 Today the majority overexpands this exception before considering the rule it prefers that\nexception to swallow. In Credit Bureau we attributed “broad meaning [to] the word ‘cause.’ ” 530\nS.W.2d at 292. In defining it, we did not limit its meaning in the past, but turned to a relatively\ncontemporary dictionary as well as older authority. Id. Clearly this term must adapt to modern\ndevelopments; our understanding of a “cause” is not frozen in 1876. See Davenport v. Garcia, 834\nS.W.2d 4, 19 (Tex.1992). Both the text of our Constitution and its historical backdrop demand\nthat the right to trial by jury remain “inviolate.” When, as here, however, changing circumstances\nrequire reexamination of the scope of this right in order to preserve the evolved workings of\ngovernment, we must ensure that any exception does not destroy the guarantee. 38 We should\ninstead follow the command of our Constitution in light of our contemporary situation, by limiting\nany exception in the most narrow way possible without completely undermining the administrative\nstate.\n\nI would accordingly clarify any existing exception for administrative proceedings to preserve\nthe right to trial by jury in all suits except those in which the state is enforcing a regulation\nor statute protecting the public. If construed too broadly, however, even this exception limited\nto “public rights” could destroy our traditional reliance on the jury system. 39 Indeed, despite\nthe writing in Atlas Roofing, such erosion has already begun at the federal level. 40 Properly\nlimited, however, a “public rights” administrative exception to the right to trial by jury is both\nconstitutionally sound and easy to apply. While perhaps far-reaching in other contexts, “public\nrights” that conflict with the right of each member of the public to have factual disputes resolved\nby a public jury must be narrowly construed. I would not permit the concept of “public rights”\nto be perverted to deny such a fundamental right. In this limited circumstance, I would define\nproceedings involving “public rights” as those in which the government, as a real party in interest,\nenforces a regulatory or statutory scheme. Contrary to the majority, I do not suggest that we follow\nits standard preference for copying a “federal test,” 852 S.W.2d at 451 n. 24. Rather, I recommend\na narrow and clear Texas standard that looks to Texas law predating Atlas Roofing, and which\nlearns from the misapplication of this doctrine in the federal courts.\n\nHere TAB's members are not entitled to a jury trial because the state is enforcing public regulations\nby imposing administrative penalties. Although this action is analogous to a common law nuisance\nclaim, here the state is protecting the public's right to a clean environment rather than an *467\nindividual's use and enjoyment of private property.\n\nThe right to trial by jury is a critical state constitutional guarantee. Denigrating my concern with\nprotecting this liberty, the majority dismisses my writing as “trumpeting.” 852 S.W.2d at 451 n.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The trumpet call has sounded from the very earliest days of our Republic, heralding our right\nto trial by jury, a clarion to our citizens to shout out to preserve their heritage against attack. It\ndemands that any intrusion on this right be narrow in scope, clearly-announced and thoughtfully\nconsidered. The majority's refusal to define with certainty its erosion of the right to trial by jury\nsounds a weak and shaky chord, reflecting a lack of commitment to this fundamental guarantee.\nAttempting to let the strong note drown the weak, the majority seeks to hide its equivocation by\nreference to my conclusion that a jury trial is not required under these anti-pollution statutes, id.,\nand by criticizing the narrow, clear and thoughtful exception I have drawn today. Id.\n\nThe inviolate nature of the right to trial by jury demands that this vital guarantee be circumscribed\nin only the most extraordinary circumstances and that any exception to it be clearly and narrowly\nconstrued. Although I do not disagree with the result announced by the majority, the analysis\nemployed is designed to destroy one of our most precious freedoms as Texans. The alternative\nI offer would permit our administrative bodies to implement efficiently their regulations, while\nensuring that efficiency concerns do not envelop a fundamental civil liberty. 41\n\n\n\n                                                 III. Standing\n\nThe issue of standing is a stranger to this litigation. No party before this court has ever asserted that\nthe Texas Association of Business lacked capacity to challenge the actions of state government.\nHow rare the occasion when all litigants agree on the proper resolution of an issue, but how truly\nextraordinary is such unanimity when the parties are two state regulatory agencies, the Texas\nAssociation of Business, the Sierra Club and the League of Women Voters. This, nonetheless,\nis the exceptional circumstance in which we find ourselves today as all of these diverse parties\nhave urged the court not to decide this matter in the manner adopted. Addressing the question\nof standing solely at the belated insistence of the majority, all parties asserted that this issue was\nnot in dispute; that, under recent precedent, standing had been waived; 42 and, alternatively, that\nthe record adequately demonstrated the right of the Texas Association of Business under Texas\nlaw to initiate this litigation. Why then does the majority insist on writing? Because it dare not\npass up the opportunity to close access to our courts to those citizens who choose to challenge\nenvironmental degradation, neighborhood destruction and consumer abuse. Through a narrowly\ncrafted test, the majority extends an invitation to TAB to come into the courts while telling other\npublic interest groups to stay out.\n\nWhile devoting over half of today's opinion to a nonissue in this litigation, the majority oddly\nlimits its inquiry to only one of the three organizations asserting standing here. Nothing is said as\nto the League of Women Voters and the Sierra Club, both of which intervened in the trial court\nand were aligned as defendants with the State. Asserting the interests of its members in water and\nair quality, as well as its involvement in protecting the state's natural resources, the League of\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    29\n\fTexas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nWomen Voters claimed standing to defend the challenged regulations. Similarly, the Sierra Club\n *468 based its standing on its purpose of environmental enhancement and conservation of natural\nresources. By completely ignoring whether these groups were proper parties and by embracing a\nfederal standing test hostile to their participation, the majority erects new barriers to deny Texans\naccess to Texas courts.\n\nTo achieve this result, the majority must overcome what, until recently, was viewed as a\nconsiderable obstacle—Texas law. This court has repeatedly held that the issue of standing may\nnot be raised for the first time on appeal, either by the parties or by the court. In Texas Industrial\nTraffic League v. Railroad Comm'n of Texas, 633 S.W.2d 821, 822–23 (Tex.1982), we concluded:\n\n  A party's lack of justiciable interest must be pointed out to the trial court ... in a written plea in\n  abatement, and a ruling thereon must be obtained or the matter is waived.\n\n  No plea challenging the standing of [the party] was filed in the district court. The issue of\n  standing was therefore waived, and the court of appeals erred in writing on the issue at all.\n\n(Emphasis supplied). The sole issue presented in Coffee v. William Marsh Rice University, 403\nS.W.2d 340 (Tex.1966), was whether the court of appeals erred in dismissing a case, on its own\nmotion, for want of standing. This court held that, because standing had not been challenged in the\ntrial court, that issue could not deprive the court of appeals of subject matter jurisdiction. Id. at 347–\n48. Assuming that standing was lacking in Sabine River Authority of Texas v. Willis, 369 S.W.2d\n348, 349–50 (Tex.1963), 43 this court nonetheless held that dismissal was erroneous, because the\nabsence of a justiciable interest was not first raised in the trial court. We have repeatedly cited\nthese decisions with approval. See Central Educ. Agency v. Burke, 711 S.W.2d 7, 8 (Tex.1986)\n(per curiam); American General Fire & Casualty Co. v. Weinberg, 639 S.W.2d 688 (Tex.1982);\nCox v. Johnson, 638 S.W.2d 867, 868 (Tex.1982) (per curiam).\n\nTime and time again, the courts of appeals have also refused to consider challenges to standing not\nfirst raised in the trial court. 44 Until today, the only criticism of our prior holdings to this effect\nhas *469 consisted primarily of writings authored by one appellate judge. 45\n\nThe majority has a simple way to deal with this venerable body of law—overrule only one case,\nmaking today's abrupt change in the law appear less drastic, while ignoring the rest. In fact,\nsix Texas Supreme Court cases must be overruled and no less than twenty-five decisions of the\ncourts of appeals must be disapproved to reach today's result. The concept of reliance on the prior\ndecisions of Texas courts has long since ceased to offer the slightest restraint on this majority. 46\n\nBulldozing a new path through this jurisprudential forest, the majority vaults standing to a new\nand remarkable prominence by suddenly discovering that it has not just one but two constitutional\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                     30\n\fTexas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nbases. And what unusual constitutional pillars each of these new finds represents. First, the\nproscription of the separation of powers doctrine against issuance of advisory judicial opinions\nallegedly requires rigorous enforcement of standing even when no party debates its existence. This\nlink between standing and separation of powers is not predicated on any directly relevant prior\ncourt decision, 47 but instead is entirely premised on an article openly antagonistic to standing\nfor environmental groups. 852 S.W.2d at 444, citing Atonin Scalia, The Doctrine of Standing as\nan Essential Element of the Separation of Powers, 17 Suffolk U.L.Rev. 881 (1983). The current\nmajority may be the first in the nation to anchor standing on this constitutional theory.\n\nThe authorities addressing the prohibition on advisory opinions cited in support of this proposition,\nof course, in no way implicate the question of standing. This precedent-setting concern with\nadvisory opinions contrasts markedly with the eagerness to issue this very type of writing within\nthe last year. See Edgewood Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Kirby, 804 S.W.2d 491, 501 (Tex.1991) (Doggett,\nJ., concurring); Carrollton–Farmers Branch Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Edgewood Indep. Sch. Dist., 826\nS.W.2d 489, 537 (Tex.1992) (Doggett, J., dissenting) (advisory opinions issued and retracted as\nnecessary to thwart efforts to satisfy the constitutional command of equity and efficiency in our\npublic schools). Writing on an issue not raised by any party, as the majority reaches out to revise\nthe law of standing today, seems to me the very essence of an “advisory” opinion.\n\nThe second newly-announced constitutional basis is equally ironic—our state's vital guarantee\nthat “[a]ll courts shall be open,” Tex. Const. art. I, § 13, in some inexplicable way, mandates that\nthey be closed to some and requires continual judicial monitoring of all who attempt to enter. No\nauthority of any type is cited for this *470 proposition that “open” courts really means “closed”\ncourts. Nothing in the history or text of the provision justifies this reading nor has any Texas court\npreviously attempted such converse interpretation. This constitutional guarantee is used today as a\ntwo-edged sword: the majority invokes the open courts provision to bar environmental groups from\nseeking judicial assistance in enforcing the laws, while in the very same opinion misinterpreting\nthis provision to allow continued violation of statutes protecting our precious natural resources. 48\n\nThen, with a final flourish, standing is conveniently classified as a nonwaivable component of\nsubject matter jurisdiction. Until today, Texas followed the rule, adopted by many of our sister\nstates considering the issue, that objections to a party's standing are waived if not first raised in\nthe trial court. 49 No Texas case is cited for the proposition that standing is part of nonwaivable\nsubject matter jurisdiction because, until today, this court had repeatedly stated precisely the very\nopposite—that standing is not jurisdictional. 50\n\nTexas has with good reason determined that standing is not excepted from traditional rules of\nappellate procedure. Our appellate system is predicated on the requirement of presentation of\ncomplaints to the lower court coupled with preservation and briefing in the reviewing court. See\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 31\n\fTexas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nTex.R.App.P. 52; 74(d), 131(e). Appellate courts face considerable difficulties in deciding an issue\nnot presented to the trial court; ordinarily, the necessary facts will not be fully developed. The\nunstated effect of today's opinion is to require trial courts to develop facts as to undisputed issues\nor risk subsequent appellate reversal. This is not an effective use of our limited judicial resources.\n\nThe requirement that issues first be presented to the trial court serves another function—preventing\nparties from “laying behind the log”:\n\n            The reason for the requirement that a litigant preserve a trial predicate for\n            complaint on appeal is that one should not be permitted to waive, consent to,\n            or neglect to complain about an error at trial and then surprise his opponent on\n            appeal by stating his complaint for the first time.\n\nPirtle v. Gregory, 629 S.W.2d 919, 920 (Tex.1982). While this court has condemned “trial by\nambush,” *471 Gutierrez v. Dallas Indep. School Dist., 729 S.W.2d 691, 693 (Tex.1987), today\nthe majority promotes “ambush on appeal.”\n\nThree purported policy justifications for the majority's actions are offered, with not a single\nsupporting authority. The first concern is that a strict standing rule is necessary to prevent\ncollusive litigation. Under Texas law, the filing of a fictitious suit constitutes contempt by counsel,\nTex.R.Civ.P. 13, and may serve as the basis for a host of sanctions, including dismissal with\nprejudice. Tex.R.Civ.P. 215 2b(5). Nor does our Texas judiciary lack the ability to reject collusive\nlitigation. Felderhoff v. Felderhoff, 473 S.W.2d 928, 932 (Tex.1971) (“We believe that our laws\nand judicial system are adequate to ferret out and prevent collusion....”); cf. Whitworth v. Bynum,\n699 S.W.2d 194, 197 (Tex.1985) (refusing to uphold Texas Guest Statute because of danger\nof collusion). Adhering to precedent today would in no way undermine the power to dismiss\nfraudulent suits.\n\nThe second virtue proclaimed for today's holding is the guarantee that the lower courts will be\nrestrained from exceeding their jurisdictional powers. 852 S.W.2d at 445. This concern is derived\nsolely from the federal law mandate that a federal appellate court is duty-bound to verify not only\nits own jurisdiction but that of the lower courts as well. Federal courts, however, have limited\njurisdiction; Texas courts do not. Our Texas Constitution creates courts of general jurisdiction,\ninvesting them with all of the “judicial power of this State.” Tex. Const. art. V, § 1. The differences\nare evident in our procedural rules. While a federal court must affirmatively ascertain jurisdiction\nover parties appearing before it, a Texas court's jurisdiction is presumed until proven lacking by\na contesting party. See Tex.R.Civ.P. 120a.\n\nLastly, the majority expresses concern as to the res judicata effect on other potential litigants\nof a judgment rendered in the absence of genuine standing. 852 S.W.2d at 445–446. Aware of\nthis concern, the very federal judiciary that this majority is so eager to emulate has failed to\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  32\n\fTexas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nperceive it as a problem of significance. International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and\nAgricultural Implement Workers of America v. Brock, 477 U.S. 274, 290, 106 S.Ct. 2523, 91\nL.Ed.2d 228 (1986). If representation is inadequate, or a conflict of interest between members\nexists, any judgment will have minimal preclusive effect. Id. Instead of completely barring access\nto the courts, procedural safeguards can ameliorate any potentially overbroad effects. See generally\nCharles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Edward H. Cooper, 18 Federal Practice & Procedure §\n4456 at 490–94 (1981 & Supp.1991).\n\nThe manufactured nature of the majority's concerns becomes all the more evident when the real\nworld experience of Texas is considered. The majority is unable to point to a single example of\ncollusion during the three decades our Texas rule, which allows the issue of standing to be waived,\nhas been in place. During this period there have likewise been no examples of lower courts making\na grab for extrajurisdictional power, nor of oppressed litigants shackled by the res judicata effect\nof contrived litigation.\n\nIn defining state requirements for standing, we are in no way bound by federal jurisprudence\nfounded upon converse jurisdictional principles from our own. Texas courts can afford their\ncitizens access to justice in circumstances where they would have been unable to establish standing\nin the federal courts. See City of Los Angeles v.

The Texas Constitution contains no express limitation of courts' jurisdiction to “cases” or\n“controversies,” as provided by the federal charter. U.S. Const. art. III, § 2. Instead, it affirmatively\nprotects the rights of litigants to gain access to our judicial system:\n\n            All courts shall be open, and every person for an injury done him, in his lands,\n            goods, person or reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law.\n\nTex.

The right of access to the courts has been at the foundation\n            of the American democratic experiment.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Hanlon, 713 S.W.2d 335, 339 (Tex.1986).\n\nThis constitutional mandate is reflected in decisions of this court adopting an “open courts”\napproach to standing in general and associational standing in particular. On several occasions,\nwe have recognized the power of the Legislature to exempt litigants from proof of “special\ninjury.” Scott v. Board of Adjustment, 405 S.W.2d 55, 56 (Tex.1966) (standing may be shown\neven in the absence of particular damage); Spence v. Fenchler, 107 Tex. 443, 180 S.W. 597\n(1915) (under statute, “any citizen” able to seek injunction, without showing particular interest or\npersonal damage). 51 In enacting the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, the Texas Legislature\nhas granted a broad right of standing: any person “whose rights, status or other legal relations are\naffected by a statute” may seek a declaration of those rights. Tex.Civ.Prac. & Rem.Code § 37.004\n(emphasis supplied).\n\nThis court has previously extended its “open courts” approach to groups representing the interests\nof their members. 52 In Texas Highway Comm'n v. Texas Ass'n of Steel Importers, 372 S.W.2d\n525, 530–31 (Tex.1963), we permitted a business association to challenge an administrative order.\nAlthough the order addressed only the import of foreign products for highway construction, this\ncourt recognized standing of an organization whose interest in foreign imports was not so limited:\n\n\n  Some of [the respondents] are owners of imported foreign manufactured products suitable for\n  highway construction purposes. All of them are actively engaged in the sale and use of imported\n  manufactured products.... [S]uch parties clearly have the right and litigable interest to have the\n  challenged ... Order declared null and void.\n  Id. at 531. Similarly, in Touchy v. Houston Legal Foundation, 432 S.W.2d 690 (Tex.1968), the\n  court considered whether an organization of attorneys had standing to maintain a suit against\n  a charitable corporation to restrain violations of ethical canons governing the practice of law.\n  Based solely on “the special interest attorneys have in their profession,” the court held standing\n  was established.\nThe “open courts” approach 53 of Touchy and Texas Highway Commission is quite sufficient to\nallow TAB access to the Texas *473 courts. 54 These two associational standing cases are all but\nignored today, brushed aside as setting forth “no particular test.” 852 S.W.2d at 446.\n\nYet in these cases in which the merits of standing are preserved for appellate court review, the\nTexas test applied has not been complicated. We simply look to whether a party has a stake in\nthe action sufficient to ensure adversarial presentation of the issues and to whether the court's\njudgment will have any effect on those before it. See Board of Water Engineers v. City of San\nAntonio, 155 Tex. 111, 283 S.W.2d 722, 724 (1955) (“there shall be a real controversy between the\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nparties, which ... will be actually determined by the judicial declaration sought.”). Because both\nof these considerations are met in the instant case, reference to federal law is wholly unnecessary.\n\nToday, however, to justify meddling with Texas standing law, the majority declares that “we\nforesee difficulties” not here with TAB, but in future cases involving organizational standing. 852\nS.W.2d at 446. To cure these perceived but as yet totally unrealized woes, the majority imposes\na difficult to meet, easy to manipulate standard drawn from federal law “that lends itself to our\nuse.” Id. at 447. Never needing an invitation to impose more federal requirements on Texas\ncitizens, the majority writes into our Texas law books the confused and troubling federal standing\nlimitations. Not surprisingly, that law has taken a regressive turn, denying standing to public\ninterest associations, including those seeking to protect the environment. See Gene R. Nichol, Jr.,\nAbusing Standing: A Comment on Allen v. Wright, 133 U.Pa.L.Rev. 635, 659 (1985) (“One could\nperhaps be forgiven for confusing standing's agenda with that of the New Right.”).\n\nThe benefits of permitting an association to represent the concerns of its members are manifest.\nAs recognized in United Auto Workers, 477 U.S. at 290, 106 S.Ct. at 2533, “[T]he primary reason\npeople join an organization is often to create an effective vehicle for vindicating interests that\nthey share with others.” Judicial economy is promoted when one litigant can, in a single lawsuit,\nadequately represent many members with similar interests, thus avoiding repetitive and costly\nactions. The wider range of resources often available for associations enhances their effectiveness\nin litigation:\n\n  Special features, advantageous both to the individuals represented and to the judicial system as\n  a whole, ... distinguish suits by associations on behalf of their members.... An association suing\n  can draw upon a pre-existing reservoir of expertise and capital. “Besides financial resources,\n  organizations often have specialized expertise and research resources relating to the subject\n  matter of the lawsuit that individual plaintiffs lack.” ... These resources assist both courts and\n  plaintiffs.\n\nId. at 289–90, 106 S.Ct. at 2532–33. In some cases, an injury that is substantial as to many may have\nan individual financial impact too small to make a challenge economically feasible. Associational\nrepresentation may be the only means of redressing conduct when the harm is limited in degree but\nsubstantial segments of society are affected. Additionally, in challenging policies of government,\norganizations are generally less susceptible than individuals to retaliation by the bureaucrats they\nchallenge.\n\nThese benefits are ignored as the majority declares that henceforth the right of associations to bring\nsuit in Texas courts will be constricted by a three-part federal test set forth in Hunt v. Washington\nState Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U.S. 333, 343, 97 S.Ct. 2434, 2441, 53 L.Ed.2d 383 (1977),\nrequiring that “(a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the\ninterests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization's *474 purpose; and (c) neither the\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nclaim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the\nlawsuit.” 55\n\nYet the Hunt test won't hunt in Texas. It is adopted purportedly because of the similarities between\nthe state and federal constitutional underpinnings of the standing doctrine. Two critical factors\nare ignored: (1) the significant differences between the Texas and United States Constitutions and\n(2) the fact that much of federal standing doctrine is not mandated by the federal charter, but is\nimposed solely on the grounds of judicial “prudence.” Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498, 95\nS.Ct. 2197, 2205, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975) (“This [standing] inquiry involves both constitutional\nlimitations on federal-court jurisdiction and prudential limitations on its exercise.”).\n\nThe majority works a grave disservice to our Texas Constitution by equating our open courts\nprovision, affirmatively guaranteeing all Texans access to our judicial system, with an express\nfederal constitutional limitation on the right to seek redress in court. Despite the fact that the\ntwo provisions are vastly different in language, history and purpose, the majority nonetheless\ndetermines to “look to the more extensive jurisprudential experience of the federal courts” to\ndetermine standing. This is clearly an erroneous course. See Davenport v. Garcia, 834 S.W.2d\n4 (Tex.1992, orig. proceeding) (in blindly adhering to federal law, “based on different language,\ndifferent history and different cases, “[f]rom our treasured state heritage, law and institutions ...\n[we] derive nothing....”).\n\nEven the federal constitutional constraint is a simple one, looking to whether “the plaintiff has\n‘alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy’ as to warrant his invocation of\nthe court's remedial powers on his behalf.” Warth, 422 U.S. at 498, 95 S.Ct. at 2205, quoting Baker\nv. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204, 82 S.Ct. 691, 1103, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962). In fact, this bare-bones test\nclosely resembles the approach that Texas courts have long chosen to follow. To the extent Hunt\nconstructs additional barriers to access to our judicial system, they are wholly court-created. 56 No\njustification for their adoption is contained in the majority opinion.\n\nMoreover, in turning to the federal law of standing, the majority invokes a doctrine that has been\ncriticized more heavily and justifiably than perhaps any other. See, e.g., Gene R. Nichol, Jr.,\nRethinking Standing, 72 Cal.L.Rev. 68, 68 (1984); Mark V. Tushnet, The “Case or Controversy”\nControversy, 93 Harv.L.Rev. 1698, 1713–21 (1980). Even the United States Supreme Court has\nrecognized that federal standing requirements have an “iceberg quality,” Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S.\n83, 94, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 1949, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968); yet the majority fails to navigate a course,\nnot unlike the captain of the Titanic, that would steer Texas well away from this potential disaster.\n\nThe concept of standing is “employed to refuse to decide the merits of a legal claim.” Charles\nA. Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice & Procedure § 3531, at\n338. Critics of the doctrine's complexity and uncertainty have recognized how subject it is to\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nmanipulation: “standing ... is no more than a convenient tool to avoid uncomfortable issues or\nto disguise a surreptitious ruling on the merits.” Id. at 348 (citing commentaries). 57 Important\nrights can be left unprotected *475 as a result. Id. at § 3531.3, 416–17 (“Standing decisions\npresent courts with an opportunity to avoid the vindication of unpopular rights, or even worse to\ndisguise a decision on the merits in ... opaque standing terminology.... Unarticulated and arbitrary\npredilection, cast as standing, defeats rights that deserve judicial protection.”).\n\nEven during the three years that this particular cause has been pending here, the federal courts\nhave been hard at work to manipulate standing requirements to bar public interest groups from\nseeking judicial vindication of rights common to their members. In Lujan v. National Wildlife\nFederation, 497 U.S. 871, 110 S.Ct. 3177, 111 L.Ed.2d 695 (1990), a nationally-recognized\nenvironmental group challenged a new development classification for certain federal wilderness\nareas that allegedly violated several federal statutes. The suit was dismissed for lack of standing\nbased upon a rigid construction of the requirement of injury to the association's members. This\ndecision has been widely criticized as significantly impairing the ability of public interest groups\nto represent their members, particularly those that seek to protect this nation's environment and\nnatural resources. 58 Today the majority eagerly positions itself to give the same treatment to\nthose Texans who would petition our state courts to protect the public interest. The majority\nnot only conspicuously relies on Lujan, 852 S.W.2d at 445, but also embraces the extremist\nanti-environmental stance propounded in an article openly critical of judicial opinions permitting\ncitizens to complain of harm inflicted upon our natural resources. Id. at 443–444, citing Atonin\nScalia, The Doctrine of Standing as an Essential Element of the Separation of Powers, 17 Suffolk\nU.L.Rev. 881 (1983).\n\nRather than a careful consideration of our Texas precedent and our unique Texas Constitution,\ntoday Texans are handed yet another unthinking embrace of federal law. Claiming “guidance”\nfrom federal precedent, 852 S.W.2d at 445, the majority overrules all Texas cases treating standing\nas a procedural issue, then unnecessarily modifies all Texas precedent addressing the merits of\nstanding. Without explanation, today's opinion simply photocopies into our Texas law books\nthe federal law of standing with all of its much-criticized complexities. Once again the majority\nchooses more Washington wisdom for Texas when what we need is more Texas thinking in\nWashington. See Bexar County Sheriff's Civ. Service Comm'n v. Davis, 802 S.W.2d 659, 665\n(Tex.1990) (Doggett, J., dissenting).\n\nWhile today the corporate members of the Texas Association of Business are permitted to\nchallenge the bureaucracy, tomorrow this same reasoning will be employed to bar public\ninterest, neighborhood, environmental and consumer groups from vindicating the rights of their\nmembers. Today's opinion not only repudiates our past “open courts” approach to access to the\njudicial system but also eliminates the long-recognized appellate requirement that *476 error be\npreserved. The majority has charged well beyond traditional constraints in its writing.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\n\nTo the extent this case is about standing, it is about standing still, about closing the courthouse\ndoor, once standing open. For today the majority extends a standing invitation to those who would\nharm our environment to act without fear of citizen challenge in the Texas courts.\n\n\n\n                                                IV. Conclusion\n\nToday the environment is the immediate victim. Those who pollute our rivers, release toxins into\nour air, and damage our land cannot be promptly penalized. Instead, only after the very slow\nwheels of our judicial system have creaked to a stop will violators of environmental protection\nlaws be held accountable.\n\nYet the environment is not the whole story. Much as a river may seem pure and clear even at the\nplace where illegal sewage is being pumped into it, the danger from a court's opinion may not\nbe immediately apparent on its surface. Only after the reasoning is applied in other cases is the\nseverity of the resulting harm to our system of justice revealed. Today's impairment of the ability\nof concerned citizens to vindicate the rights of many in our courts and the majority's knockout\npunch to the right of trial by jury will unfold in future cases to bar participation of ordinary citizens\nin Texas courts.\n\nThe mess in Texas is not only with our environment but with the misinterpretation of the law.\n\n\nGAMMAGE, Justice, concurring and dissenting.\nThough I would prefer not to write separately, I find I am unable to agree entirely with any single\nopinion of the court's other members. I must write this concurring and dissenting opinion because,\nwhile I agree with the disposition of this cause, I disagree with substantial portions of the reasoning\nand language in the majority's opinion and I agree with part of Justice Doggett's concurring and\ndissenting opinion.\n\nI agree with the preliminary portion of Justice Cornyn's majority opinion, which correctly sets\nforth the regulatory scheme and basic dispute.\n\nI agree substantially with Part II of Justice Doggett's opinion and his jury trial discussion. In my\nview, whether or not a suit is a “cause” for purposes of the right to a jury trial is not controlled\nby whether it was first determined by an administrative agency. I also agree with Part III of\nJustice Doggett's opinion relating to standing, which I will further address below. I agree with\nPart II of Justice Cornyn's majority opinion. The statutes may not condition access to the courts\non prepayment of a penalty. The principle here is the same as for a supersedeas bond. The statute\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    38\n\fTexas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nmay condition the right to restrain the prevailing party (the State) from executing (enforcing) its\njudgment (administrative order) on the posting of a bond for the full amount. It may not, however,\ncondition the right to appeal the judgment on posting of the full penalty imposed. Dillingham v.\nPutnam, 109 Tex. 1, 5–6, 14 S.W. 303, 304 (1890). This is true even if that “judgment” takes the\nform of an administrative agency decision. Administrative agency decisions, for the most part,\nentitle an appellant to only “substantial evidence” as opposed to de novo review. To further burden\nthose regulated with prepayment of the “judgment” as the only alternative to total loss of even\nsubstantial evidence review violates the basic concept of our constitutional open courts in Texas.\n\nAs to the issue (or non-issue) of standing, the majority in effect adopts the position of federal courts\nthat standing is a jurisdictional question. Otherwise it cannot be fundamental error to be addressed\nwhen no party raises it. Standing was not raised and should not be addressed in this cause.\n\nEven assuming standing is an element of subject matter jurisdiction, the court should not write\non the issue in this case. Even though a judgment is void and subject to collateral attack at any\npoint if there is an absence of subject matter jurisdiction, see *477 Mercer v. Phillips Natural\nGas Co., 746 S.W.2d 933, 936 (Tex.App.—Austin 1988, writ denied), unassigned error of lack of\njurisdiction should be addressed only if jurisdiction is in fact lacking. Since the majority concludes\nthere was standing in this case, and since no party raised its existence as an issue, there is no reason\nto address it at all, even if it would be fundamental error if lacking.\n\nThe basis for the majority's discussion is its sudden revelation that “[s]tanding is implicit in\nthe concept of subject matter jurisdiction.” 852 S.W.2d at 443. Their opinion then claims this\nimplication comes from the separation of powers doctrine and the open courts provision of the\nTexas Constitution. It is a curiosity of legal scholarship, however, that in the 156 prior years of\nits existence, this court never before found standing “implicit” in those constitutional provisions,\nbut in fact wrote that standing could be waived and hence was not fundamental error. Texas\nIndus. Traffic League v. Railroad Comm'n, 633 S.W.2d 821, 823 (Tex.1982). Justice Doggett's\nopinion adequately addresses why there is no implication from those provisions that standing is\njurisdictional.\n\nThe majority's struggle to put standing in issue whenit is not prompts me to address two statements\nin its opinion which strike me as either misleading or just plain wrong. The majority asserts,\nwithout citation to authority, that “[s]ubject matter jurisdiction is never presumed,” 852 S.W.2d at\n443–444, and in a footnote repeats that assertion in urging that “Justice Doggett confuses subject\nmatter jurisdiction with personal jurisdiction. Only the latter can be waived when uncontested. See\nTEX.R.CIV.P. 120a.” 852 S.W.2d at 444 n. 5. The majority's claim that subject matter jurisdiction\nis never presumed is at its very best misleading.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   39\n\fTexas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nConnected with this discussion is the implicit assertion in another footnote that there is a\n“jurisdictional standing” that is different from “objections to join a real party in interest or to a\nparty's capacity to sue rather than jurisdictional standing.” 852 S.W.2d at 445 n. 7. These remarks\nare made in an attempt to distinguish the cases cited by Justice Doggett from those of other states\nholding that standing is not jurisdictional. I suppose we should be encouraged to find out that there\nare some types of “standing” that will not be jurisdictional, but it occurs to me that by using the term\n“jurisdictional standing” the court is begging the question—if it is jurisdictional, then it must be\nfundamental. The problem is that the Texas cases, at least as I read them, define “standing” in terms\nof “the party's capacity to sue,” 1 which is one example we are given of non-jurisdictional standing.\nThe majority opinion is calculated—no, guaranteed—to cause confusion because apparently this\ncourt will henceforth tell litigants on a case-by-case basis whether the standing problems in their\ncases are “jurisdictional” or merely formal.\n\nThere is no need to create this confusion. The majority's fomenting it, however, requires that I\naddress it to some extent. I will discuss the “subject matter never presumed” proposition first, then\nweave into the “jurisdictional standing” language.\n\nI agree that subject matter jurisdiction is never presumed in one respect. Subject matter jurisdiction\nexists when the nature of the case falls within a general category of cases the court is empowered\nto adjudicate under the applicable constitutional and statutory provisions. See Pope v. Ferguson,\n *478 445 S.W.2d 950, 952 (Tex.1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 997, 90 S.Ct. 1138, 25 L.Ed.2d\n405 (1970); Bullock v. Briggs, 623 S.W.2d 508, 511 (Tex.App.—Austin 1981, writ ref'd n.r.e.),\ncert. denied, 457 U.S. 1135, 102 S.Ct. 2962, 73 L.Ed.2d 1352 (1982). In this sense, there is no\npresumption because if the case is not one over which the court had constitutional and statutory\nauthority to act one does not “presume” subject matter jurisdiction to make it valid. If a justice of\nthe peace grants a divorce, the judgment is void because that is not the type of case the constitution\nand legislature entrusts to that court, and appellate courts will not “presume” the justice court had\njurisdiction in order to make the judgment valid.\n\nBut what the majority addresses here under the rubric of “standing” is not a court assuming\njurisdiction over a type of dispute for which the statutes do not grant it power. The district court\nundoubtedly had jurisdiction over the declaratory judgment and injunction action brought there,\nsince district courts may entertain declaratory judgment and injunction actions. The question of\nstanding the majority gratuitously addresses here is related to an incidental party issue.\n\nThis court has expressly held that some facts or similar matters relating to party issues are\npresumed. For example, for many years the subject matter jurisdiction for certain trial courts\nas set by the statutes has included a jurisdictional amount, sometimes as a minimum amount in\ncontroversy and sometimes as both a maximum and minimum. Womble v. Atkins, 160 Tex. 363,\n370, 331 S.W.2d 294, 299 (1960). This court has held that jurisdiction, so far as the amount\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   40\n\fTexas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nin controversy is concerned, is determined by the pleadings unless facts disclose that a party\nfraudulently or in bad faith pleaded claims to make it appear there was jurisdiction over the case\nwhere there was not. Brown v. Peters, 127 Tex. 300, 94 S.W.2d 129, 130 (Tex.Comm'n App. B\n1936). Despite the supposed requirement that the pleadings demonstrate jurisdiction, we have also\nheld that unless the pleadings affirmatively show there is no jurisdiction, the court will presume\nthe existence of jurisdiction in the trial court. Peek v. Equipment Serv. Co., 779 S.W.2d 802, 804\n(Tex.1989). 2 This is not the only sense in which subject matter jurisdiction is “presumed” as\nto collateral matters. If a defendant contests jurisdiction and alleges in a verified pleading that\nplaintiff's fraudulent pleading amount was for the purpose of conferring jurisdiction on the trial\ncourt, but the trial judge still renders judgment in the case, on appeal the fact issue of jurisdiction\nis presumed decided against the defendant. Ellis v. Heidrick, 154 S.W.2d 293, 294 (Tex.Civ.App.\n—San Antonio 1941, writ ref'd); see also Maddux v. Booth, 108 S.W.2d 329, 331 (Tex.Civ.App.\n—Amarillo 1937, no writ) (appeal bond from county court to district court did not show filemark\nmaking the appeal timely, held “the absence of such a question being made in the trial court the\npresumption is that the court had jurisdiction”). Further, if the very power of the judge who sits\nis in question, that authority too may be presumed. It is presumed that the assignment of a retired\njudge was properly made pursuant to all statutory requirements absent an express showing to the\ncontrary in the record. Texaco, Inc. v. Pennzoil Co., 729 S.W.2d 768, 855 (Tex.App.—Houston\n[1st Dist.] 1987, writ ref'd n.r.e.).\n\nThere is a type of lack of standing that this court formerly held to be fundamental error. When there\nwas a joint interest in property involved in the litigation, and the joint owner was not joined as a\nparty, this court earlier held that the party defect was jurisdictional fundamental error that could be\nraised for the first time on appeal. The injustice which that rule caused prompted *479 this court\nto reduce those “indispensable ” necessary parties to near nonexistence. Petroleum Anchor Equip.,\nInc. v. Tyra, 406 S.W.2d 891, 893–94 (Tex.1966); see also Cooper v. Texas Gulf Indus., Inc., 513\nS.W.2d 200, 203 (Tex.1974). It was no accident that this court listed the case which the majority\ntoday overrules, Texas Indus. Traffic League v. Railroad Comm'n, 633 S.W.2d 821 (Tex.1982),\nas one of the cases showing that “[f]undamental or unassigned error is a discredited doctrine”\nas applied to these collateral defect-in-party type claims. Cox v. Johnson, 638 S.W.2d 867, 868\n(Tex.1982). After more than a hundred years of trying to narrow fundamental error exceptions,\nthe majority today takes a quantum leap backward.\n\nIn an appeal of or other direct attack on a trial court default judgment, it is service on the defendant\nand related due process requirements which must affirmatively appear on the record. In such cases\npersonal jurisdiction cannot be presumed. Capitol Brick, Inc. v. Fleming Mfg. Co., 722 S.W.2d\n399, 401 (Tex.1986); Uvalde Country Club v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 690 S.W.2d 884, 885\n(Tex.1985); McKanna v. Edgar, 388 S.W.2d 927, 928 (Tex.1965).

Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nthe court in question can be neither waived nor ignored. See Crawford v. McDonald, 88 Tex. 626,\n631–32, 33 S.W. 325, 328 (1895). This court has long recognized that there may be party issues,\ni.e., the matter is “a mere matter of procedure” as opposed to the constitutional or statutory power\nof a court to render judgment, that may be presumed as to either type of jurisdiction. Id. at 630,\n33 S.W. at 327.\n\nThe majority should not adopt the federal courts' position that “standing” is jurisdictional. There\nis a fundamental difference between federal law and state law that controls here. Federal courts\nare courts of limited jurisdiction. Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 178–79, 2 L.Ed. 60\n(1803). The parties asserting a claim must plead and prove (when not obvious) that jurisdiction\nexists. FED.R.CIV.P. 8(a). A party suing under a statute must establish his right to claim under\nthat statute—his standing —in order to establish jurisdiction. General Comm., Brotherhood of\nLocomotive Eng'rs v. Missouri–Kansas–Texas Ry. Co., 320 U.S. 323, 337–38, 64 S.Ct. 146, 152–\n53, 88 L.Ed. 76 (1943). Consequently, standing is a part of jurisdiction under federal procedure,\nrelated to the “case” or “controversy” requirement of the federal constitution. Association of Data\nProc. Serv. Orgs. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 151, 90 S.Ct. 827, 829, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970). But\nthere is no “case” or “controversy” limitation language in the Texas Constitution. In state courts of\ngeneral jurisdiction, the power to entertain any suit not prohibited by either the federal constitution\nor federal law is presumed. Cincinnati v. Louisville & N. Ry. Co., 223 U.S. 390, 32 S.Ct. 267,\n56 L.Ed. 481 (1912). State courts have all residual jurisdiction that federal courts lack. Id.; see\ngenerally 2 CHESTER J. ANTIEAU, MODERN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW § 10:1 at 4–5 (1969).\nWe should continue to recognize that “standing,” like other procedural issues, may be waived.\nThere is no reason to overrule the Texas Industrial Traffic League case, or its related progeny.\n\n\nSPECTOR, Justice, concurring and dissenting.\nI agree with the substance of the concurring and dissenting opinion by Justice Doggett. I write\nseparately, however, to explain why I would uphold the statutory requirement that those who\nrun afoul of environmental laws make timely payment of administrative penalties before seeking\njudicial review.\n\nIn two other causes decided today, this court has considered open courts challenges to the statutory\nrequirement that state mineral lessees prepay administrative deficiency assessments before seeking\njudicial review of those assessments. State v. Flag–Redfern Oil Co. and State v. Rutherford Oil\nCorp., 852 S.W.2d 480 (Tex.1993) (considering Tex.Nat.Res.Code § 52.137). Our analysis in\nthose cases focused on the *480 public interest at stake: the State's only interest in the prepayment\nrequirement, we noted, was its financial interest in immediate access to disputed royalty payments.\nId. at 485. Thus, we concluded that the prepayment requirement of section 52.137 was no different,\nin constitutional terms, from the litigation tax disapproved in LeCroy v. Hanlon, 713 S.W.2d 335,\n342 (Tex.1986). Id.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  42\n\fTexas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (1993)\n\n\n\nThe present case, in contrast, does not involve a litigation tax. The Clean Air Act, the Solid\nWaste Disposal Act, and the Water Quality Act embody this state's commitment to protect the\nenvironment; and the prepayment requirements struck down today were intended to give force\nto that commitment, not to raise revenue. Without the need to prepay administrative penalties,\npolluters will be left with little if any incentive to timely comply with environmental laws and\nregulations.\n\nThe effects of today's decision, though, extend far beyond the statutes at issue in this case. By\nrejecting these prepayment requirements, without regard to the state interest involved, the majority\nhas struck a severe blow to this state's ability to enforce a broad range of regulations in the\npublic interest. The similar statutory provisions identified in the opinion by Justice Doggett, 852\nS.W.2d at 457, cannot be dismissed as minor technicalities; they are carefully-crafted measures\nthat the legislature considered vital to protect the public from recalcitrant lawbreakers. Casting\nthose provisions aside will seriously disrupt the effective operation of our state government.\n\nThe Texas Constitution cannot be construed in absolutes. The basic right of access to the courts\nmust be balanced against the need to protect the public's health and safety. While the restriction at\nissue in this case may be substantial, I would hold that the public's interest in clean air and water,\ncombined with the due process afforded to TAB's members in the administrative process, tips the\nbalance in favor of the prepayment requirement. I therefore dissent.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    The League of Women Voters and the Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club intervened in the suit and were aligned as defendants with\n        the Texas Air Control Board and the Texas Water Commission. Justice Doggett contends that the standing of the Intervenors should\n        be addressed along with TAB's. We disagree. Standing concerns a party's faculty to invoke the court's subject matter jurisdiction.\n        Once it has been invoked by a plaintiff, a court's subject matter jurisdiction is not affected by the status of defendants or intervenors\n        aligned in interest with defendants.\n2       Act of June 14, 1985, 69th Leg., R.S., ch. 637, § 33, 1985 Tex.Gen.Laws 2350, 2359 (amending Texas Clean Air Act codified\n        at TEX.REV.CIV.STAT.ANN. art. 4.041 (Vernon 1976), currently codified as amended at TEX.HEALTH & SAFETY CODE §\n        382.088; Act of June 15, 1985, 69th Leg., R.S., ch. 795, § 6.001, 1985 Tex.Gen.Laws 2719, 2813 (amending Solid Waste Disposal Act\n        codified at TEX.REV.CIV.STAT.ANN. art. 4477–7 (Vernon 1976), currently codified as amended at TEX.HEALTH & SAFETY\n        CODE § 361.252; Act of June 15, 1985, 69th Leg., R.S., ch. 795, § 5.007, 1985 Tex.Gen.Laws 2719, 2806 (amending TEX.WATER\n        CODE § 26.136).\n3       Although some amendments have been adopted since, they are not relevant to the issue presented in this case.

Only the latter can be waived when uncontested. See\n        TEX.R.CIV.P. 120a.\n6       The analysis is the same under the federal constitution. See e.g. Correspondence of the Justices, Letter from Chief Justice John Jay\n        and the Associate Justices to President George Washington, August 8, 1793 in Laurence H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 73\n        n. 3 (2nd ed. 1988).\n7       Of the states listed by Justice Doggett, only Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, New York, South Dakota, and perhaps Ohio, Pennsylvania and\n        Washington actually treat jurisdictional standing as waivable. See 852 S.W.2d at 469. The other state cases cited deal with the waiver\n\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

City of West Palm Beach, 255 So.2d 673, 675 (Fla.1971) (addressing capacity objection).\n8     Justice Doggett disagrees that standing is a component of subject matter jurisdiction, yet he declines to explain what role standing\n      plays in our jurisprudence. From his harsh critique of the doctrine, it seems that he not only objects to the conclusion that standing\n      cannot be waived but also to the conclusion that standing is a requirement to initiate a lawsuit.\n9     Texas Industrial Traffic League relied on two cases to support its holding that standing cannot be raised for the first time on appeal:\n      Coffee v. William Marsh Rice University, 403 S.W.2d 340, 341 (Tex.1966), and Sabine River Authority v. Willis, 369 S.W.2d 348,\n      350 (Tex.1963). We need not overrule these two cases, however, because unlike Texas Industrial Traffic League, we believe that\n      standing was present in the trial court in these cases. Our concern is with a party's right to initiate a lawsuit and the trial court's\n      corresponding power to hear the case ab initio. Standing is determined at the time suit is filed in the trial court, and subsequent events\n      do not deprive the court of subject matter jurisdiction. Carr, 931 F.2d at 1061.\n10    Justice Doggett claims that we overrule three additional decisions of this court. See Central Educ. Agency v. Burke, 711 S.W.2d 7\n      (Tex.1986) (per curiam); American Gen. Fire & Casualty Co. v. Weinberg, 639 S.W.2d 688 (Tex.1982); Cox v. Johnson, 638 S.W.2d\n      867 (Tex.1982) (per curiam). We disagree. These cases hold that matters not raised in the trial court are waived. One exception noted\n      by these decisions, however, is a lack of jurisdiction which may be raised by a party, or the court, for the first time on appeal. Justice\n      Doggett does not believe that standing falls within that exception because he contends that standing is not jurisdictional.\n11    In most other jurisdictions, such prepayment provisions are required only to stay execution of judgments and are not prerequisites\n      to the right to appeal itself. See Gary Stein, Expanding the Due Process Rights of Indigent Litigants: Will Texaco Trickle Down?,\n      61 N.Y.U.L. REV. 463, 469 (1986).\n12    Thus, contrary to Justice Doggett's reading of our opinion, the Sax test is inapplicable.\n\n13    The Clean Air Act was implemented to “safeguard the state's air resources from pollution by controlling or abating air pollution\n      and emissions of air contaminants....” TEX.HEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 382.002(a). The Texas Water Code was implemented to\n      “maintain the quality of water in the state consistent with the public health and enjoyment ...” TEX.WATER CODE § 26.003.\n14    The importance is evidenced by article XVI, section 59(a) of our constitution, which provides in relevant part that: “The conservation\n      and development of all the natural resources of this State ... and the preservation and conservation of all such natural resources ... are\n      each and all ... public rights and duties.” TEX. CONST. art. XVI, § 59(a).\n15    If the person charged does not make payment or post bond within thirty days, the agency may forward the matter to the attorney\n      general for enforcement. TEX.HEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 382.089(c), § 361.252(m); TEX.WATER CODE § 26.136(k).\n16    It has been argued that our procedure of allowing immediate enforcement of trial court judgments violates federal due process when\n      the judgment debtor is financially unable to post a supersedeas bond and immediate enforcement will cause irreparable injury. Texaco,\n      Inc. v. Pennzoil Co., 784 F.2d 1133 (2d Cir.1986), rev'd on other grounds, 481 U.S. 1, 107 S.Ct. 1519, 95 L.Ed.2d 1 (1987). A similar\n      argument could be fashioned under the Texas open courts provision, but TAB does not assert that argument here. TAB's open courts\n      challenge centers not on the requirement of immediate payment, but on the forfeiture of judicial review if payment is not made.\n17    Thus, contrary to Justice Doggett's assertion, we do not strike down the penalties themselves. Nothing in this opinion prohibits the\n      state's collection of assessed penalties. We hold as violative of our open courts provision only the requirement that the penalties be\n      paid as a condition to judicial review. Furthermore, nothing in our opinion requires that penalties already paid be refunded.\n18    That the affected parties may be able to afford prepayment is irrelevant. The guarantee of constitutional rights should not depend\n      on the balance in one's bank account.\n19    TAB claims that the lack of a jury trial before the agency as well as the lack of a trial de novo violate article I, section 15. We limit\n      our inquiry to the absence of a trial de novo because, as this court has said: “Trial by jury cannot be claimed in an inquiry that is non-\n      judicial in its character, or with respect to proceedings before an administrative board.” Middleton v. Texas Power & Light Co., 108\n      Tex. 96, 185 S.W. 556, 561–62 (1916). Even if the right to a jury is denied before an administrative agency, the dispositive question\n      is whether a trial de novo and the corresponding right to a jury trial is constitutionally required upon judicial review of the agency's\n      decision. See Cockrill v. Cox, 65 Tex. 669, 674 (1886) (“The right of jury trial remains inviolate, though denied in the court of first\n      instance [in civil cases], if the right to appeal and the jury trial on appeal are secured.”) (bracketed language in original).\n20    Article I, section 15, provides, in pertinent part:\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

See 852 S.W.2d\n      at 461.\n23    Despite Justice Doggett's trumpeting of our constitution's guarantee of trial by jury, he agrees that the right does not attach under\n      the circumstances of this case.\n24    Justice Doggett contends that the basis for our jury trial holding is overbroad. Instead, he would have us adopt the “imperfectly\n      employed” federal test first enunciated in Atlas Roofing Co. v. Occupational Safety & Health Review Comm'n, 430 U.S. 442, 97 S.Ct.\n      1261, 51 L.Ed.2d 464 (1977). Infra, 852 S.W.2d at 464. The basis for our decision is more limited, arising as it does out of TEX.\n      CONST. article XVI, section 59(a) and our decision in Corzelius.\n25    The Clean Air Act proclaims:\n            The policy of this state and the purpose of this chapter to safeguard the air resources of the state from pollution by controlling\n            or abating air pollution and emissions of air contaminants, consistent with the protection of public health, general welfare, and\n            physical property of the people, including the aesthetic enjoyment of air resources by the public and the maintenance of adequate\n            visibility.\n            TEX.HEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 382.002.\n            The Texas Water Code proclaims in relevant part:\n            It is the policy of this state and the purpose of the subchapter to maintain the quality of water in the state consistent with the\n            public health and enjoyment\n      .....\n            TEX.WATER CODE § 26.003.\n26    The actions of the agencies involved in this proceeding are subject to the Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act (APTRA),\n      which specifically affords a “full panoply of procedural safeguards” to a party to contested case before those agencies. Southwestern\n      Bell Tel. Co. v. Public Util. Comm'n of Tex., 571 S.W.2d 503, 507 (Tex.1978). These procedural safeguards include the right to\n      notice, the making of a full record of the proceeding before the agency, the taking of depositions, the right to subpoena witnesses,\n      the application of the rules of evidence, the preparation of proposal for decision and the filing of exceptions and briefs, as well as\n      separately stated findings of fact and conclusions of law. TEX.CIV.STAT.ANN. art. 6252–13a § 19 (Vernon Supp.1993). Judicial\n      review is provided by section 19(e) under the substantial evidence rule, which directs a reviewing court to reverse and remand the\n      agency adjudication if the agency decision is:\n            1) in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;\n            2) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency;\n            3) made upon unlawful procedure;\n            4) affected by other error of law;\n            5) not reasonably supported by substantial evidence in view of the reliable and probative evidence in the record as a whole; or\n            6) arbitrary and capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\n         Id.\n         We have held that judicial review under APTRA based on the record developed before the agency “furnishes more assurance of\n         due process and a surer means of determining whether an agency acted arbitrarily, capriciously and without due regard for the\n         evidence.” Imperial Am.

While declaring that article XVI, § 59(a)\n      will not permit payment of even the most modest penalties under our open courts provision, the majority inexplicably finds that it\n      forms an insurmountable barrier to the right to jury trial.

The guarantee extends to any “cause” instituted in the district court. A\n            “cause” is defined as a suit or action concerning any question, civil or criminal, contested before a court of justice.\n         See Texas Constitutional Revision Commission, A New Constitution for Texas: Text, Explanation, Commentary 120–21 (1973).\n36    The Credit Bureau opinion was authored for the court by now former Chief Justice Jack Pope, who had written previously, “[t]he\n      struggle for survival by the institution we call the jury is truly the epic of our law.” Jack Pope, The Jury, 39 Tex.L.Rev. 426 (1961).\n      That struggle continues today.\n37    Though he wrote in unnecessarily global terms regarding this exception, even Harris recognized that\n            [t]he plain language of the Judiciary section conferring the right of trial by jury in all causes in the district courts would seem to\n            entitle parties to jury trials irrespective of whether that right existed at the time of the adoption of the Constitution.\n         Harris, supra, at 6–7.\n38    The majority notes the existence of other statutory procedural protections, such as those contained in the Administrative Procedure\n      and Texas Register Act, Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat. art. 6252–13a, § 19(e). 852 S.W.2d at 452, n. 26. While important, these measures certainly\n      do not constitute a complete substitute for a jury trial. If the Texas Constitution guarantees a right to trial by jury, no lesser protection\n      will suffice.\n39    To some extent every action legislatively entrusted to an administrative agency involves a public right. At the same time even actions\n      by private parties may have incidental regulatory effects and are unquestionably invested with a public interest. See The Dallas\n      Morning News, Inc. v. Fifth Court of Appeals, 842 S.W.2d 655, 663 (Tex.1992, orig. proceeding) (Doggett, J., dissenting from\n      overruling of motion for leave to file petition for writ of mandamus).\n40    The “public rights” concept has been recently muddled by the federal courts. In Granfinanciera, S.A. v. Nordberg, 492 U.S. 33, 109\n      S.Ct. 2782, 106 L.Ed.2d 26 (1989), the court, although upholding the right to a jury trial for defendants sued for fraudulent conveyance\n      by a trustee in bankruptcy, broadened the scope of its “public rights” exception to include all cases “involving statutory rights that\n      are integral parts of a public regulatory scheme and whose adjudication Congress has assigned to an administrative agency.” Id. at\n      55 n. 10, 109 S.Ct. at 2797 n. 10. See also Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric. Prod. Co., 473 U.S. 568, 586, 105 S.Ct. 3325, 3335,\n      87 L.Ed.2d 409 (1985) (rejecting the view that the government must bring suit in order for litigation to involve “public rights”). I\n      believe that such an expansive reading of “public rights” would not be consistent with the broad state constitutional protection of\n      the right to trial by jury in Texas.\n41    In view of recent attacks nationwide on the jury system, a recent study determined that\n            Our central conclusion is that the civil jury system is valuable and works well.... It is [not] “broken,” and therefore it need not\n            be “fixed.” The jury system is a proven, effective, an important means of resolving civil disputes.\n         The Brookings Institution, Charting a Future for the Civil Jury System 2 (1992).\n42    As the majority recognizes, “the parties insist that any question of standing has been waived in the trial court and cannot be raised\n      by the court for the first time on appeal.” 852 S.W.2d at 443–444.\n43    Despite the clear statement in Sabine River that “[w]e assume without deciding that Sabine has no justiciable interest,” 369 S.W.2d\n      at 349, the majority today asserts that “standing was present” in the trial court in that case. 852 S.W.2d at 446 n. 9.\n44    See, e.g., Espiricueta v.

The majority's odd attempt to distinguish some of these cases, all of which are\n      predicated in terms of standing, as involving solely the question of whether the litigant was a proper “real party in interest” has never\n      been drawn previously in the published decisions of any Texas court addressing the question of standing. See cases cited at notes\n      44, supra, and 50, infra.\n50    See Texas Industrial Traffic League, 633 S.W.2d at 822–23; Central Educ. Agency v.

To avoid overruling these, the majority claims\n      all three recognized that lack of subject matter jurisdiction can initially be raised on appeal. True, but ignored is the conclusion of\n      each that subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived while standing can be.\n51    Our past acknowledgement of the legislative power to expand access to Texas courts is inconsistent with today's conclusion that\n      we must narrowly limit access.

City of San Antonio, 155 Tex. 111, 114, 283 S.W.2d 722, 724 (1955). The majority overrules the Texas\n      Industrial Traffic League case, which addressed standing in the context of “justiciable interest” discussed in the more recent cases\n      of Coffee v. William Marsh Rice University, 403 S.W.2d 340 (Tex.1966), and Sabine River Authority v. Willis, 369 S.W.2d 348\n      (Tex.1963). The context of the cases differed from Board of Water Engineers, of course. The precise meaning of “standing” in fact\n      depends on the context. The majority adopts a federal gloss, and the federal courts have stated, “Generalizations about standing to\n      sue are largely worthless as such.” Association of Data Proc. Serv. Orgs. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 151, 90 S.Ct. 827, 829, 25 L.Ed.2d\n      184 (1970). Using “standing” to mean a party's legal capacity to sue is my best description of the labyrinth of different cases the\n      majority uses interchangeably.\n2     Richardson v.

Moore, 985 S.W.2d 149 (1998)\n\n\n\nAppellant, the Texas Department of Public Safety (the “Department”), failed to recommend\nappellee Charles Moore for promotion to the position of Assistant Commander of the Criminal\nIntelligence Service. Moore sued under the Human Rights Act claiming reverse discrimination\nand, by later amendment, under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (the “UDJA”) seeking\na declaration that the Department acted outside its statutory authority in filling four high-ranking\npositions without examining applicants based on merit. The trial court granted summary judgment\nagainst Moore on the discrimination claim. The trial court also granted partial summary judgment\nin favor of Moore, declaring that the Department acted outside its statutory authority in filling the\nfour positions, and ordered those positions vacated. The Department appeals. In its points of error,\nthe Department challenges (1) the trial court's jurisdiction under section 411.007 of the Texas\nGovernment Code and the UDJA; (2) the trial court's decision to order the four positions vacated;\nand (3) the trial court's discretion in awarding attorney's fees. We will affirm the trial court's order\nin part and reverse in part.\n\n\n\n                                               BACKGROUND\n\nIn October 1993, the Department announced a vacancy in the position of Assistant Commander\nof the Criminal Intelligence Service. Commander Don Plemons, the officer charged with making\nthe recommendation for appointment to fill the vacancy, orally interviewed seven candidates.\nAmong these candidates were Charles Moore, a white male, and Enrique Garcia, an Hispanic\nmale. Plemons recommended Garcia, and Garcia was appointed to the position. Moore sued in\ndistrict court.\n\n[1]    Moore originally brought suit under the Human Rights Act claiming he was the victim\nof reverse racial discrimination when he was denied promotion in favor of Garcia. 1 Moore\nlater amended his petition to include a declaratory judgment claim based upon the Department's\nalleged failure to comply with section 411.007(b) of the Texas Government Code, which\nrequires that the Department make promotions or appointments based upon merit determined\nby examination. See Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 411.007(b) (West 1998). The trial court granted\ncross motions for summary judgment; declaring that the Department failed to comply with all\nthe requirements of section 411.007(b) in promoting Garcia to Assistant Commander of the\nCriminal Intelligence Service, and dismissing Moore's discrimination claim for failure to exhaust\nthe necessary administrative remedies. 2 Moore does not appeal the dismissal of his discrimination\nclaim.\n\nBefore the trial court rendered final judgment, the Department filled the positions of Commander\nof the Criminal Intelligence Service, Commander of Narcotics, and Assistant *153 Commander\nof Narcotics; also by appointment, and also, allegedly, without a competitive examination. The\ntrial court allowed amendment of Moore's petition to ask for declaratory relief regarding these\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Subsequently, the trial court rendered final judgment declaring that\nthe Department failed to comply with the competitive examination requirements of section\n411.007(b) in hiring the four aforementioned positions, and ordered them vacated and filled\nthrough competitive examination. The trial court also awarded Moore attorney's fees. The\nDepartment brings this appeal.\n\n\n\n                                                 DISCUSSION\n\n [2] The Department initially challenges the trial court's jurisdiction to hear Moore's claim.\nSpecifically, the Department argues that section 411.007(b) only establishes norms for the\nDepartment in promoting its employees, and fails to create any cause of action in Moore.\nAdditionally, the Department contends that the UDJA likewise fails to create a cause of action in\nMoore, and cannot be used as a vehicle to interpret section 411.007(b) of the Labor Code. The\ndetermination of jurisdiction under the UDJA is a question of law. See Ainsworth v. Oil City Brass\nWorks, 271 S.W.2d 754, 760 (Tex.Civ.App.—Beaumont 1954, no writ). We will look first to the\njurisdiction of the trial court before deciding whether the court erred in entering its order.\n\n\nJurisdiction and the Declaratory Judgments Act\n [3] Enacted in 1943, the UDJA confers on Texas courts the authority to “declare rights, status,\nand other legal relations whether or not further relief is or could be claimed.” Tex. Civ. Prac. &\nRem.Code Ann. § 37.003 (West 1997). The Legislature intended the UDJA to be remedial, to\nsettle and afford relief from uncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights, and to be liberally\nconstrued. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. § 37.002 (West 1997). Describing the subject matter\navailable for relief, the UDJA provides:\n\n            A person interested under a deed, will, written contract, or other writings\n            constituting a contract or whose rights, status, or other legal relations are\n            affected by a statute, municipal ordinance, contract, or franchise may have\n            determined any question of construction or validity arising under the instrument,\n            statute, ordinance, contract, or franchise and obtain a declaration of rights, status,\n            or other legal relations thereunder.\n\nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. § 37.004 (West 1998) (emphasis added).\n\n [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] A suit under the UDJA is not confined to cases in which the parties\nhave a cause of action apart from the Act itself. Transportation Ins. Co. v. Franco, 821 S.W.2d 751,\n754 (Tex.App.—Amarillo 1992, writ denied). A declaratory judgment, however, is appropriate\nonly if (1) a justiciable controversy exists as to the rights and status of the parties; and (2) the\ncontroversy will be resolved by the declaration sought. See Bonham State Bank v. Beadle, 907\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    3\n\fTexas Dept. of Public Safety v. Moore, 985 S.W.2d 149 (1998)\n\n\n\nS.W.2d 465, 467 (Tex.1995) (citing Texas Ass'n of Bus. v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440,\n446 (Tex.1993)); see also City of Austin v. L.S. Ranch, Ltd., 970 S.W.2d 750, 754, (Tex.App.—\nAustin 1998, no pet.). A justiciable controversy is one in which a real and substantial controversy\nexists involving a genuine conflict of tangible interest and not merely a theoretical dispute. See\nBeadle, 907 S.W.2d at 467. A justiciable controversy must be distinguished from an advisory\nopinion, which is prohibited under both the Texas and federal constitutions. See Texas Air Control\nBd., 852 S.W.2d at 444. A judgment under the UDJA depends on a finding that the issues are not\nhypothetical or contingent, and the questions presented must resolve an actual controversy. Empire\nLife Ins. Co. v. Moody, 584 S.W.2d 855, 858 (Tex.1979). A justiciable controversy, however, does\nnot necessarily equate with a fully ripened cause of action:\n\n            It is not necessary that a person who seeks a declaration of rights under this\n            statute shall have incurred or caused damage or injury in a dispute over rights and\n            liabilities, but it has frequently been held that an action for declaratory judgment\n            would *154 lie when the fact situation manifests the presence of ‘ripening\n            seeds of a controversy.’ Such appear where the claims of several parties are\n            present and indicative of threatened litigation in the immediate future which\n            seems unavoidable, even though the differences between the parties as to their\n            legal rights have not reached the state of an actual controversy.\n\nAinsworth, 271 S.W.2d at 761.\n\nThe crux of this appeal concerns the application of section 411.007(b) to the advancement\nof personnel within the Department through appointment or promotion. In the section entitled\n“Officers and Employees,” section 411.007(b) provides:\n\n            Appointment or promotion of an officer or employee must be based on merit\n            determined by examination under commission rules that take into consideration\n            the applicant's age, physical condition, experience, and education. Each person\n            who has an application on file for a position in the department shall be given\n            reasonable written notice of the time and place of those examinations.\n\nTex. Gov't Code Ann. § 411.007(b) (West 1998). The Department originally contends that section\n411.007(b) creates no cause of action in Moore, and, therefore, the trial court had no jurisdiction\nto hear the case. The trial court received its jurisdiction from the controversy created by the\nDepartment's application of section 411.007(b) to Moore, not from the words of the statute itself.\nThe UDJA provides for a declaration of rights for persons “whose rights, status, or other legal\nrelations are affected by a statute....” Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. § 37.004 (West 1998).\nJurisdiction under the UDJA primarily depends on the nature of the controversy; whether the\ncontroversy is merely hypothetical or rises to the justiciable level. See Empire Life Ins., 584 S.W.2d\nat 858.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   4\n\fTexas Dept. of Public Safety v. Moore, 985 S.W.2d 149 (1998)\n\n\n\n\nMoore's interest in being treated according to statute when applying for vacant positions in the\nDepartment clearly implicates the UDJA's purpose of clarifying rights affected by statute. The\ncontroversy lies not in the actions of the Department in reviewing Moore's application for Assistant\nCommander of Criminal Intelligence, but in the Department's application of its promotional rules\nto future appointment vacancies. The Department has already taken an adverse stance to Moore's\nposition by allegedly not requiring competitive examinations when filling the initial vacancy. The\nDepartment's repetition of the same behavior in filling three subsequent positions emphasizes the\nactuality of the controversy. There is clearly a justiciable controversy sufficient to invoke the\ncourt's jurisdiction through the UDJA to clarify Moore's, and any other applicant's, rights as they\npertain to the Department's hiring procedure. Furthermore, the trial court's declaration resolves\nthe controversy by informing the Department that its actions in filling Assistant Commander\nand Commander positions without examining applicants based on merit falls outside its statutory\nauthority.\n\n [10] [11] The Department next argues that sovereign immunity shields the Department as an\nagency of the state. The Department argues that the UDJA does not act to waive the State's ordinary\nimmunity from liability. Suits challenging an agency's action as being outside the scope of its\ndelegated authority are not suits against the State requiring legislative or statutory authority. Public\nUtil. Comm'n v. City of Austin, 728 S.W.2d 907, 911 (Tex.App.—Austin 1987, writ ref'd n.r.e.).\nBecause Moore's suit under the UDJA sought a declaration that the Department acted outside its\nstatutory authority in appointing various high-level positions without examining applicants based\non merit, no explicit waiver by the State was necessary. Therefore, Moore's suit was not barred\nby sovereign immunity. We hold the trial court had jurisdiction to hear Moore's claim under the\nUDJA and overrule the Department's points of error in that regard.\n\n\nThe Requirement of “Merit–Based” Promotion\n [12] We must now determine whether the trial court erred in holding that the Department\nacted outside its statutory authority when filling the four vacancies. The enabling statutes of\nthe Department clearly provide for merit-based promotion and appointment. See *155 Tex.\nGov't Code Ann. § 411.007(b) (West 1998). That same section further provides for a competitive\nexamination of some sort, and provides that all applicants “shall receive notice of the time and\nplace of such examinations.” Id. While it is true that the statute, under the section entitled “Duties of\nDirector,” reserves for the Director's discretion some positions to be filled by “direct appointment,”\nthe section limits these direct appointments to chiefs of bureaus. See Tex. Gov't Code Ann. §\n411.006(6) (West 1998) (emphasis added). 3 No other positions are mentioned.\n\n[13] Pursuant to section 411.004(3), the Public Safety Commission (the “Commission”)\npromulgated rules governing appointments and promotions.

Moore, 985 S.W.2d 149 (1998)\n\n\n\n(West 1998). 4 These rules include the policy that the Department shall make all appointments\nbased on merit. See 37 Tex. Admin. Code § 1.21(a) (1998). In keeping with the policy of making\nappointments based on merit, the rules provide that “examinations will be conducted for all\npositions excepting unskilled labor, trades, and direct appointments made by the Director.” 37 Tex.\nAdmin. Code § 1.27 (1998) (emphasis added). Reading the rule in conjunction with the statute, the\nrule exempts from competitive examination only unskilled labor, trades, and the chiefs of bureaus.\nHowever, despite the language of the statute restricting directorial appointments to bureau chiefs,\nand despite the Department's own rules advocating the policy of promotions based on merit, the\nDepartment seeks in its General Manual to expand the number of director appointments exempted\nfrom competitive examination:\n\n\n   Positions of major division chief, assistant major division chief, division chief, regional\n   commander, commander, assistant commander, senior Ranger captain, assistant supervisor of\n   Rangers, Director and Assistant Director of Personnel and of Training, other positions deemed\n   necessary and appropriate by the Director and positions of the Director's staff will be filled by\n   direct appointment of the Director.\n   Texas Department of Public Safety General Manual, Chap. 7, § 26.04(4).\n [14] [15] The Department argues that the Assistant Commander and Commander positions are\nexempt from competitive examination by virtue of the discretion granted the Department by statute\ncoupled with the listing of director appointments found in the Department's General Manual. In\nthe alternative, the Department argues that, should the Assistant Commander position be subject\nto competitive examination, the oral interview by Commander Plemons given to applicants should\nsuffice. While we agree with the Department that the statute does provide discretion to the\nCommission and the Department to create its own rules and to define examination based on merit\nfor purposes of promotional appointments, we reject the notion that the Assistant Commander and\nCommander positions are exempt, or that the oral interview could fulfill the statutory requirement\nof a competitive examination. The language of the statute, and that of the Department's own\nrules, clearly envisions a merit-based promotional system for all those positions not specifically\nexempted as director appointments. And, according to statute and the rules promulgated by the\nCommission, Assistant Commander and Commander are not positions so exempted. Furthermore,\nthe mere existence of section 26.04(4) in the Department's General Manual expanding the number\nof exemptions beyond statutory limits both exceeds the Department's authority and belies the\nDepartment's argument that the oral interviews given applicants fulfilled the requirement of a\ncompetitive examination.\n\n [16] Moore argues that the statute contemplates written examinations as the proper manifestation\nof competitive examinations. To the extent that Moore seeks affirmation from this Court for his\nposition, we reject it. The Department maintains the discretion to *156 create procedures for\ncompetitive examinations regarding promotive appointments, provided such procedures make\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Moore, 985 S.W.2d 149 (1998)\n\n\n\na good faith effort to comply with the statutory and agency requirement of “merit-based”\npromotions. The Department should bear in mind, however, that the written notice requirements of\nthe statute regarding a stated time and location for the competitive examination seem to mandate\nsome type of formalized and structured examination. 5 See Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 411.007(b)\n(West 1998).\n\n\nThe Injunctive Order\n [17] The Department next contends that even if the trial court had jurisdiction to declare that\nthe Department failed to comply with section 411.007(b) in hiring Garcia and the others without\nresort to competitive examination, the trial court had no jurisdiction, or, alternatively, abused its\ndiscretion, in ordering the Department to vacate the four positions contested by Moore. We note\ninitially that actions under the UDJA are sui generis; they are unique in that the declarations of\n“rights, status and other legal relations” are not truly legal or equitable. See Cobb v. Harrington,\n144 Tex. 360, 190 S.W.2d 709, 713 (Tex.1945); see also Texas Liquor Control Bd. v. Canyon\nCreek Land Corp., 456 S.W.2d 891, 895 (Tex.1970). We further note that, at the time of the\ntrial court's rendition of final judgment, Moore's discrimination claim had been dismissed through\nsummary judgment; thus the trial court's authority to act was based on the UDJA alone. Moore\nargues that the UDJA allows the trial court to grant the injunctive relief requested, namely the\nvacation of the four positions, as ancillary to the declaratory relief awarded. See Tex. Civ. Prac.\n& Rem.Code § 37.011 (West 1998); see also Davis v. Pletcher, 727 S.W.2d 29, 35 (Tex.App.—\nSan Antonio 1987, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Under the facts presented here, we disagree.\n\n [18] As Moore suggests, the UDJA allows for injunctive relief ancillary to a declaration of rights\nin some situations: “[F]urther relief based on a declaratory judgment or decree may be granted\nwhenever necessary or proper. The application must be by petition to a court having jurisdiction\nto grant relief.” Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code. Ann. § 37.011 (West 1998). 6 This power to grant\nancillary relief is conditioned on such relief being necessary and proper. For the following reasons,\nsuch relief in this case is inappropriate.\n\n [19] Regarding Moore's original reverse discrimination claim, filing a complaint with the Human\nRights Commission and exhausting administrative remedies was a mandatory prerequisite to filing\na civil action alleging a violation of the Human Rights Act under the Texas Labor Code. Schroeder\nv. Texas Iron Works, Inc., 813 S.W.2d 483, 488 (Tex.1991). The rationale for this result is that\nthe Human Rights Act provides the exclusive remedy for alleged discrimination in administrative\nagency personnel decisions. See Stinnett v. Williamson County Sheriff's Dep't, 858 S.W.2d 573,\n577 (Tex.App.—Austin 1993, writ denied). Thus, Moore's failure to exhaust his administrative\nremedies was a jurisdictional bar to filing a discrimination claim in district court, and the trial\ncourt properly granted summary judgment against Moore's claim. Schroeder, 813 S.W.2d at 488.\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  7\n\fTexas Dept. of Public Safety v. Moore, 985 S.W.2d 149 (1998)\n\n\n\n [20] [21] [22] This procedural posture becomes important with regard to the trial court's\naward of injunctive relief based solely on jurisdiction under the UDJA because it allows\nMoore to circumvent the exclusive remedies provided for, and the purposes contained in, the\nHuman Rights Act. *157 The Human Rights Act includes a provision for injunctive relief\nfrom unlawful employment practices. See Tex. Labor Code Ann. § 21.210 (West 1996). This\nprovision represented Moore's exclusive injunctive remedy until his administrative remedies had\nbeen exhausted. Moore could have sought an injunction to halt the Department from promoting\nGarcia and the other three appointments had he followed the proper administrative procedures.\nHe failed to do so. He sought and received in district court a declaration that the Department\nhad misinterpreted and misapplied section 411.007(b). This declaration clarified Moore's rights\nand status regarding future vacancies in the Department. However, the order by the trial court\nretroactively vacating the four Assistant Commander and Commander positions rewarded Moore\nfor failing to follow the exclusive remedies provided for him by law. Declaratory relief creates\nno substantive rights. State v. Morales, 869 S.W.2d 941, 947 (Tex.1994). It provides a procedural\ndevice for the determination of controversies which are already within the jurisdiction of the court.\nId. The remedy afforded by the UDJA is additional and does not supplant any existing remedy.\nCobb, 190 S.W.2d at 713; Crow v. City of Corpus Christi, 146 Tex. 558, 209 S.W.2d 922, 924\n(Tex.1948). Because the exclusive remedy available to Moore regarding his reverse discrimination\nclaim is the Human Rights Act, which contains the right to injunctive relief, the trial court erred in\nvacating the positions in the Department based solely on the ancillary injunctive power contained\nin the UDJA.\n\nFurthermore, the trial court's order undercut the purpose of the Human Rights Act to create a\ncomprehensive administrative review. See Stinnett, 858 S.W.2d at 577. The Human Rights Act\nwas intended to embody the policies embedded in Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq., including\n“administrative procedures involving informal conference, conciliation and persuasion, as well as\njudicial review of administrative action.” Schroeder, 813 S.W.2d at 487. Allowing the jurisdiction\ncreated by the UDJA to circumvent the procedures and remedies provided by the Human Rights\nAct could create a back door to district court not contemplated by the Legislature. The proper\nremedy for Moore is prospective. His declaratory judgment carries preclusive effect in any future\nlawsuit, whether administrative or judicial, should the Department fail to offer him notice and\nthe opportunity for merit-based promotion as required by section 411.007(b). See Valley Oil\nCo. v. City of Garland, 499 S.W.2d 333, 335 (Tex.Civ.App.—Dallas 1973, no writ). Thus, the\nretroactive injunctive relief ordered by the trial court was not “necessary and proper” as required\nunder the UDJA before ancillary injunctive relief could be awarded. We reverse the trial court's\norder vacating the Department's appointments of Assistant Commander of Criminal Intelligence\nService, Commander of Criminal Intelligence Service, Commander of Narcotics, and Assistant\nCommander of Narcotics.\n\n\nAttorney's Fees\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                8\n\fTexas Dept. of Public Safety v. Moore, 985 S.W.2d 149 (1998)\n\n\n\n [23] The trial court awarded Moore attorney's fees under the UDJA. The UDJA provides that\n“[i]n any proceeding under this chapter, the court may award costs and reasonable and necessary\nattorney's fees as are equitable and just.” Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. § 37.009 (West\n1997). The Texas Supreme Court has expressly held that “by authorizing declaratory judgment\nactions to construe the legislative enactments of governmental entities and authorizing awards of\nattorney fees, the [U]DJA necessarily waives governmental immunity for such awards.” Texas\nEduc. Agency v. Leeper, 893 S.W.2d 432, 446 (Tex.1994). The grant or denial of attorney's fees\nin a declaratory judgment lies within the discretion of the trial court, and its judgment will not be\nreversed on appeal absent a clear showing that it abused that discretion. Oake v. Collin County,\n692 S.W.2d 454, 455 (Tex.1985).\n\n [24] [25] The Department argues that the UDJA may not be used solely as a vehicle for attorney's\nfees. See HECI Exploration Co. v. Clajon Gas Co., 843 S.W.2d 622, 637 (Tex.App.—Austin\n1992, writ denied). Since we have held that the trial court had jurisdiction to construe section\n411.007(b) and that the trial court's construction of that statute favors Moore, Moore has achieved\na declaration *158 of rights entitling him to seek the additional relief of attorney's fees. See\nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. § 37.009 (West 1997). The Department's argument fails. The\nDepartment also objects to the award of attorney's fees in the final judgment based upon affidavits\nof the competing parties, claiming that the affidavits do not represent competent evidence that\nthe attorney's fees were reasonable and necessary. See Stewart Title Guar. Co. v. Sterling, 822\nS.W.2d 1, 10 (Tex.1991). We refuse to hold that this procedure for determining attorney's fees\nrises to the level of an abuse of discretion. We overrule the Department's point of error regarding\nattorney's fees.\n\n\n\n                                                         CONCLUSION\n\nWe affirm the order of the trial court declaring that the Department acted outside its statutory duty\npursuant to section 411.007(b) in filling four Assistant Commander and Commander positions\nwithout examining applicants based on merit. We further affirm the order of the trial court\nawarding attorney's fees. We reverse the order of the trial court vacating the four Assistant\nCommander and Commander positions and hold that Moore's only injunctive relief must be\nprospective.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    The relevant statute provides:\n            An employer commits an unlawful employment practice if because of race, color, disability, religion, sex, national origin, or\n            age the employer:\n            (1) fails or refuses to hire an individual, discharges an individual, or discriminates in any other manner against an individual in\n            connection with compensation or the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment; or\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Orix Capital..., 353 S.W.3d 241 (2011)\n\n\n\nAppellant Transcontinental Realty Investors, Inc. appeals a declaratory judgment granted in favor\nof Orix Capital Markets, LLC. In three issues, Transcontinental generally contends: (1) the trial\ncourt erred in granting declaratory relief because no justiciable controversy existed and because\nOrix had previously filed, but abandoned, a breach of contract claim raising the same contentions,\n(2) the declaratory judgment act did not authorize the award of attorneys' fees in this case, and (3)\nthe attorneys' fees award was improper because Orix did not segregate the fees expended on the\ndeclaratory judgment claim from fees expended on the abandoned breach of contract claim. For\nthe following reasons, we vacate the trial court's judgment and dismiss the cause.\n\nThis suit involves a Guaranty in which Transcontinental guaranteed payment of attorneys' fees\nOrix expended in a suit against a Transcontinental subsidiary, TCI 9033 Wilshire Boulevard, Inc.\n(TCI). TCI was the owner of commercial real estate subject to a mortgage loan serviced by Orix.\nA dispute arose as to whether Orix could require that TCI purchase terrorism insurance. Orix\ndemanded that TCI purchase *243 such insurance and TCI refused. Orix then declared the loan\nin default and began charging interest at the default rate. TCI filed suit for breach of contract and\ndeclaratory relief. Orix counterclaimed—also for breach of contract and declaratory relief.\n\nMeanwhile, a third party sought to purchase the TCI property. The mortgage documents required\nOrix to consent to any sale of the property. Before Orix would consent, it required TCI's parent\ncompany, Transcontinental, to guarantee any attorneys' fees that might be awarded to Orix in the\nTCI litigation, which was to continue. To facilitate the sale, Transcontinental agreed and signed\nthe Guaranty.\n\nOrix ultimately prevailed in the underlying litigation and obtained a judgment against TCI that\nincluded $241,380.39 in attorneys' fees as well as appellate costs and fees in the event TCI\nunsuccessfully appealed. TCI did appeal that judgment. A few months later, while the appeal\nwas pending, Orix filed the instant suit. In its original petition, Orix alleged Transcontinental\nbreached the Guaranty. Specifically, Orix contended that after the TCI judgment was signed, it\nmade a demand upon Transcontinental to “comply with its obligations” under the agreement,\nbut Transcontinental refused to “accept” its responsibilities and indebtedness created under the\nGuaranty. As damages, it alleged the $241,380.39 that had been awarded, as well as any additional\nappellate attorneys' fees that might later be incurred in the TCI appeal if Orix prevailed.\n\nTranscontinental answered with a general denial and also asserted the affirmative defense of\nduress asserting the Guaranty was unenforceable. Transcontinental also filed a motion to abate\nor stay asserting the trial court should not determine the validity of the Guaranty until the TCI\nappeal was resolved because no determination could be made as to whether it was liable until\nTranscontinental's liability was first finally resolved.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Orix Capital..., 353 S.W.3d 241 (2011)\n\n\n\nOrix responded by amending its petition to abandon its breach of contract claim and replace it\nwith a claim for declaratory relief. In its First Amended Petition, Orix sought a global declaration\nthat the Guaranty was valid and enforceable and that Transcontinental was obligated to pay Orix\nall expenses, attorneys' fees, and other costs incurred at all levels of litigation of the TCI lawsuit\nas well as in any separate proceeding.\n\nOrix filed a motion for summary judgment asserting the Guaranty was valid as a matter of law and\nwas not procured by duress. Orix stated it was seeking a determination that Transcontinental was\nliable for the attorneys' fees ultimately awarded if they were affirmed on appeal. It asserted the\npendency of the appeal in the underlying judgment should not prevent it from obtaining declaratory\nrelief because it was not seeking to recover any attorneys' fees from the TCI lawsuit yet, but was\nonly seeking a declaration of liability for such fees (and all additional appellate fees in that case)\n“if and when” the TCI appeal was concluded in Orix's favor. Orix also expressly requested the\ntrial court to “extinguish” all affirmative defenses to the Guaranty. Transcontinental responded to\nthe motion asserting the trial court lacked jurisdiction because whether any controversy about the\nGuaranty existed was not ripe for review.\n\nThe trial court granted declaratory relief declaring the Guaranty “valid and enforceable” to\nwhich Transcontinental had “no viable affirmative defense.” The court also declared that\nTranscontinental was obligated to pay all attorneys' fees and costs awarded to Orix in the TCI\nlitigation at all levels. In this appeal, Transcontinental asserts the trial court erred in *244 granting\ndeclaratory relief because validity of the Guaranty did not present a justiciable issue.

The doctrine prohibits suits involving “uncertain or\ncontingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.”\nPatterson, 971 S.W.2d at 442. A case is not ripe if its resolution depends on contingent facts or\nupon events that have yet to come to pass. See id. at 443.\n\n [8] The declaration sought in this case concerned validity of a Guaranty for payment for attorneys'\nfees awarded to Orix from TCI in underlying litigation. The Guaranty obligated Transamerica to\npay these fees to Orix if TCI did not. Because Transcontinental's liability under the Guaranty in this\ncase would arise only if TCI was found liable for attorney's fees, its liability can be compared to\nliability that arises in indemnity cases. In Firemen's Insurance Co. v. Burch, 442 S.W.2d 331, 332\n(Tex.1968), the Texas Supreme Court held that a trial court cannot determine a claim for indemnity\nbefore liability is established in the underlying case because any such opinion would be purely\nadvisory. See also State Farm Lloyds v. C.M.W., 53 S.W.3d 877, 893 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2001, pet.\ndenied). The Court later limited this holding in Farmers Texas County Mutual Insurance, Co. v.\nGriffin, 955 S.W.2d 81, 84 (Tex.1997), concluding that, under limited circumstances, a claim for\nindemnity could be litigated while the underlying litigation remained pending. Specifically, the\nCourt held “the duty to indemnify is justiciable before the insured's liability is determined in the\nliability *245 lawsuit when the insurer has the duty to defend and the same reasons that negate\nthe duty to defend likewise negate any possibility the insurer will ever have a duty to indemnify.”\nGriffin, 955 S.W.2d at 84 (emphasis in original). It reasoned that under those circumstances, “no\nfacts could be developed” in the underlying tort suit that could alter the court's conclusion no duty\nto indemnify existed. Id.\n\nHere, Orix was seeking a general declaration of validity of the Guaranty and lack of viable\ndefenses. Orix pleaded it was entitled to declaratory relief because Transcontinental had failed\nto “acknowledge” its liability under the Guaranty and because, in response to its abandoned\nbreach of contract claim, it had pleaded duress. It was not seeking guidance with respect to what\nwas then currently required under the Guaranty. Indeed, in oral argument Orix conceded that\nTranscontinental was not obligated until appeals concluded and admitted it sought declaratory\nrelief to make collection efforts more expedient “if and when” the judgment was finally affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Orix Capital..., 353 S.W.3d 241 (2011)\n\n\n\nThe issue presented in determining justiciability is whether all the facts surrounding the Guaranty\nand defenses to it were sufficiently developed such that Transcontinental's liability could not have\nbeen affected by subsequent events. In its motion for summary judgment, Orix admitted that\nTranscontinental's liability was triggered “assuming the Final Judgment is affirmed on appeal.”\nIt complained Transcontinental did not “acknowledge” its responsibility “in the event” the trial\ncourt's judgment is affirmed. Orix thus admits that if the underlying judgment was reversed,\nthe entire proceedings—in the trial court and in this court—would be completely meaningless.\nFurther, the declaration sought—and the declaration given—was that Transcontinental was\nresponsible for any fees awarded in the TCI litigation at all trial and appellate levels. Thus, the trial\ncourt declared Transcontinental's liability for fees that had yet to even be expended. Moreover,\nthis case concerned a guarantee of payment for fees TCI incurred and was liable for. Future events\ncould certainly alter TCI's willingness or ability to pay its fees itself. Any such payment by TCI\nwould effect Transcontinental's liability on the Guaranty.\n\n [9] Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Orix's attempt to “extinguish” any defenses to the\nGuaranty and get a declaration that no defenses existed was not proper. According to Orix's\nrationale, Transcontinental should be forced to litigate any potential defenses it might have to\nliability before liability has even been established. A defendant may not use a declaratory judgment\nto prematurely adjudicate defenses to liability that may not yet exist. Cf. Calderon v. Ashmus,\n523 U.S. 740, 118 S.Ct. 1694, 140 L.Ed.2d 970 (1998) (under federal constitution, party may not\nuse a declaratory judgment to get advance ruling on an affirmative defense); see also Cohen v.\nOrthalliance New Image, Inc., 252 F.Supp.2d 761, 766 (N.D.Ind.2003) (assessing the success of a\ndefense to a potential claim (breach-of-contract or otherwise) is generally the type of hypothetical\nquestion federal courts endeavor to avoid). Not all affirmative defenses depend upon facts that\nexist at the time of contract formation. Any determination that no defenses could exist would be\ncompletely advisory. Even if we could say Transcontinental's answer pleading duress may have\nput that specific defense in controversy, the declaratory judgment was not intended to permit\nthe piecemeal trial of lawsuits. Delaney, 396 S.W.2d at 858. We conclude the trial court had no\njurisdiction to declare the Guaranty valid and that Transcontinental had no defenses to *246 it.\nConsequently, we vacate the trial court's judgment and dismiss this cause.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The District Court,\nHarris County, Patricia J. Kerrigan, J., entered summary judgment in favor of provider, granted\nprovider's motion for a turnover order, and appointed a receiver. Customer appealed.\n\n\n\nHoldings: The Court of Appeals, Evelyn V. Keyes, J., held that:\n\n[1] REP conclusively established its right to recover over $105,000 from customer for breach of\nESA;\n\n[2] customer was not excused from performance of ESA by REP's use of estimated billing;\n\n[3] it was impossible to determine the actual harm that would have been caused to REP by\ncustomer's early termination, as required for liquidated damages clause to be enforceable;\n\n[4] when viewed as of the time the ESA was executed, ESA's method for calculating liquidated\ndamages was reasonable;\n\n[5] early termination fee in ESA did not violate statute;\n\n[6] attorney's affidavit in support of attorney fees award was sufficient to support claims such that\nREP was entitled to statutory presumption that fees were reasonable; and\n\n[7] excessive demand exception to REP's statutory right to attorney fees did not apply.\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

(collectively, “Triton”),\nappeal the trial court's grant of summary judgment and a receivership order entered in favor of\nappellee, Star Electricity, L.L.C. d/b/a StarTex Power (“StarTex”). Triton presents fourteen issues\nfor appellate consideration. In its first seven issues, Triton argues that (1) the trial court erred in\ngranting summary judgment in favor of StarTex on its breach of contract claim because (2) the\ntrial court misinterpreted and misapplied the law applicable to the claims and defenses asserted\nby the parties; (3) StarTex's summary judgment evidence did not establish that it was entitled\nto judgment as a matter of law on its breach of contract claim; (4) Triton's summary judgment\nevidence raised genuine issues of material fact as to one or more elements of StarTex's breach of\ncontract claim; (5) genuine issues of material fact existed as to Triton's claims for offset and credit\nbased on StarTex's use of improper and incorrect billing and StarTex's use of estimated billing; (6)\ngenuine issues of material fact existed as to StarTex's billing practices and procedures and whether\nthose procedures constituted a breach by StarTex of the parties' contract; and (7) genuine issues\nof material fact existed regarding whether Triton objected *47 to StarTex's billing practices and\nprocedures and to invoices submitted to Triton by StarTex and whether StarTex failed to fulfill its\nlegal obligations for handling such complaints.\n\nTriton further argues that (8) StarTex's failure to comply with the legal requirements for handling\ncomplaints concerning retail electric service and Triton's pending complaint against StarTex\nbefore the Texas Public Utility Commission acted to stay the judgment and enforcement of the\njudgment. Triton attacks the trial court's damages award, arguing that the trial court erred in\nawarding StarTex (9) liquidated damages pursuant to the early termination provisions in the\ncontract because such an award constitutes an impermissible and unenforceable penalty; (10)\nearly termination fee damages based on unidentified and unproven monthly billings; (11) early\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Finally, Triton appeals the order of the\ntrial court appointing a receiver, arguing that (13) the trial court erred in appointing a receiver\nand ordering Triton to turn over to the receiver confidential records and all proceeds and revenue\ngenerated by Triton's businesses and that (14) Triton is entitled to immediate relief from the order\nappointing a receiver and is entitled to recover all records and revenue turned over pursuant to\nthe order, including all funds that have been disbursed, paid, relinquished, distributed, or in any\nway disposed of by the receiver.\n\nWe affirm.\n\n\n\n                                                      Background\n\nTexas deregulated its electric utility market beginning in 1999. See TEX. UTIL.CODE ANN. §\n39.051(a) (Vernon 2007) (“On or before September 1, 2000, each electric utility shall separate\nfrom its regulated utility activities its customer energy services business activities that are\notherwise also widely available in the competitive market.”); Tex. Indus. Energy Consumers v.\nCenterPoint Energy Houston Elec., LLC, 324 S.W.3d 95, 97 (Tex.2010). The Utilities Code\nprovides that electric utilities must separate their business activities from one another into three\nunits: (1) a power generation company; (2) a retail electric provider; and (3) a transmission and\ndistribution utility. TEX. UTIL.CODE ANN. § 39.051(b).\n\nRetail electric providers, like StarTex, essentially buy electricity from a transmission and\ndistribution utility and resell it to Texas consumers. See AEP Tex. N. Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm'n\nof Tex., 297 S.W.3d 435, 439 (Tex.App.-Austin 2009, pet. denied) (citing Tex. Util.Code Ann.\n§ 39.051). The transmission and distribution utility's rates are still regulated by the Texas Public\nUtility Commission (“PUC”). Tex. Indus. Energy Consumers, 324 S.W.3d at 97. Transmission and\ndistribution utilities provide metering services, charge retail electric providers for “nonbypassable\ndelivery charges” under rates approved by the PUC, and may also bill retail customers directly\nat the request of the retail provider. Id. at 97–98. Thus, Texas's electric utilities have “voluntarily\ninterconnected their transmission systems” to form a single grid managed by the Electric\nReliability Council of Texas (“ERCOT”). Pub. Util. Comm'n of Tex. v. City Pub. Serv. Bd. of\nSan Antonio, 53 S.W.3d 310, 312 (Tex.2001). Electricity is produced by a generating facility,\ntransmitted to a point of interconnection with the ERCOT grid, *48 and then distributed to end\nusers who purchase it from retail electric providers.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Star Electricity, L.L.C., 411 S.W.3d 42 (2013)\n\n\n\nIt is in this context that Triton, as owner of five commercial buildings, entered into an Electric\nServices Agreement (“ESA”) in May 2006 with StarTex, a retail electricity provider. StarTex\nagreed to supply Triton with electricity, and Triton agreed to pay at a fixed rate for a term of twelve\nmonths. Regarding invoicing and payment, the ESA provided that\n\n             [StarTex] shall render to Customer [Triton] on a monthly basis, or as mutually\n             agreed by [StarTex] and Customer but not less frequent than monthly, an invoice\n             that is due and payable fifteen (15) days from the date of the invoice. If the\n             payment of all undisputed amounts is not received by the due date, Customer\n             will be charged a late fee equal to five percent (5%) of the past due amount.\n             Customer must provide to [StarTex] written notice setting forth in particular\n             detail any disputed amount, including the calculations with respect to any errors\n             or inaccuracies claimed. If it is subsequently determined that Customer owes\n             [StarTex] any portion of the disputed amount, Customer shall remit to [StarTex]\n             within five (5) business days following such resolution the outstanding balance\n             plus interest .... Any amounts that may have been overpaid or underpaid shall\n             be applied to the next monthly invoice.\n\nThe ESA also contained the following language:\n\n   Early Termination Fee. In the event that Customer terminates this agreement or Customer\n   defaults as described [below], then an Early Termination Fee will be assessed. The Early\n   Termination Fee shall be equal to the greater of a) the three months highest bills for Customer or\n   b) any mark to market costs. For purposes of this fee the mark to market costs shall be calculated\n   by multiplying the difference between the initial cost of power procured to satisfy the ESA and\n   the final net liquidated value of said power at the time of termination by the total amount of\n   power procured from the Customer Location for the remainder of the original term of the ESA....\n\n   ....\n\n   Customer Acknowledgments. Customer acknowledges that [StarTex's] ability to invoice\n   Customer is dependent on the [transmission and distribution provider (TDSP) ]'s or ERCOT's\n   ability to furnish [StarTex] all necessary information including meter readings or recorded data,\n   as applicable. In the absence of such information from the TDSP or ERCOT, [StarTex] may\n   invoice Customer based on estimated meter reading according to the Usage Profile. As soon as\n   practical, and after receipt of Customer's Energy Consumption and settlement charges from the\n   TDSP and/or ERCOT, [StarTex] will reconcile on the next invoice any difference(s) between\n   estimated and actual consumption and settlement charges.\n\n   ....\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

An Event of Default occurs upon:\n\n      a. failure of Customer to pay amounts due under the ESA within 5 business days of receipt\n         of written notice of payment due;\n\n      b. failure of either Party to perform a material term of this ESA[.]\n\n         ....\n\nIn April 2007, Triton and StarTex extended their agreement, under modified terms, for another\ntwelve months (“First Amendment”). Triton elected to replace the fixed-rate pricing schedule with\nthe Market Clearing Price of Energy *49 (“MCPE”). The First Amendment provided:\n\n   1. PRICE FOR ENERGY: The term for this Amendment shall commence upon the Customer's\n   normal meter read during the month of May 2007, and continue through the Customer's normal\n   meter read during the month of May 2008. Customer agrees to purchase electricity from\n   STARTEX at a variable rate based on the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (“ERCOT”)'s\n   Balancing Energy price (“Contract Price”) for the Congestion Zone in which the Customer's\n   location resides. The price calculated by ERCOT in the market for Balancing Energy is referred\n   to as the Market Clearing Price for Energy (“MCPE”) in the ERCOT protocols....\n\n   2. Except as herein changed and amended, the Agreement [ESA] shall remain in full force and\n   effect as written. Any changes made in this Amendment that are disputed by Customer will be\n   replaced by the original Agreement's terms and conditions.\n\nIn 2008, the parties again extended their agreement under the MCPE pricing terms for a term of\nthirty-six months (“Second Amendment”). The Second Amendment contained language identical\nto that in the First Amendment, except that the term of the Second Amendment commenced “upon\nthe Customer's normal meter read during the month of May 2008 and continued through the\nCustomer's normal meter read during the month of May 2011.”\n\nTriton objected to some of StarTex's billing practices. This eventually led to Triton's terminating\nits contract with StarTex in October 2008 and seeking electricity from a different retail electricity\nprovider.\n\nOn September 14, 2009, StarTex filed suit against Triton alleging breach of contract, and, in\nthe alternative, suit on a sworn account and quantum meruit. StarTex asserted that Triton owed\nit $319,094.11, consisting of unpaid utility service and contractual fees, interest, and liquidated\ndamages. StarTex also sought attorney's fees under Civil Practice and Remedies Code chapter\n38. StarTex attached to its petition an affidavit from Robert Verhage, its Collections Manager,\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Star Electricity, L.L.C., 411 S.W.3d 42 (2013)\n\n\n\ncopies of the ESA and First and Second Amendments, copies of its unpaid invoices, and a claim\npresentment letter from its counsel to Triton demanding payment of the unpaid amounts.\n\nOn October 12, 2009, Triton answered. Triton generally denied StarTex's allegations and asserted\nthat the liquidated damages provision was invalid and unenforceable and that the attorney's fees\nsought were not reasonable and necessary.\n\nTriton also asserted that\n\n             the account on which [StarTex] sues ... is not just and true, and all just and\n             lawful offsets, payments, and credits have not been applied to [Triton's] account.\n             [Triton] does not owe [StarTex] $319,094.11 in damages, because [StarTex]\n             seeks to recover $197,323.95 in damages based on an invalid liquidated damages\n             provision. Furthermore, based on the inaccuracies in [StarTex's] billing and\n             estimates since 2007, [Triton] also challenge[s] [StarTex's] allegation that [it\n             owes] $105,034.18 to [StarTex] for services rendered.\n\nAttached to its answer, Triton provided the affidavit of Bill Bird, who averred:\n\n             I am responsible for and have knowledge of Triton's business dealings with\n             Plaintiff [StarTex]. Triton began doing business with Plaintiff in 2006. In the\n             summer of 2007, Plaintiff began providing usage estimates to Triton, which\n             reflected very high usage. Triton brought this issue to Plaintiff's attention,\n             and the *50 issue was not resolved. Triton contests the validity of Plaintiff's\n             account, and denies that it owes $105,034.18 to Plaintiff for services rendered.\n\nOn January 20, 2010, StarTex moved for summary judgment on its breach of contract claim.\nStarTex argued that the parties had a valid contract and that the First and Second Amendments of\nthe contract required Triton to pay for the electricity received under the MCPE pricing schedule\nthrough May 2011. Copies of the ESA and First and Second Amendments were attached as\nsummary judgment evidence. StarTex stated that “[t]he MCPE is a variable rate plan wherein the\nprice changes every fifteen (15) minutes to reflect the supply and demand for power in a particular\nmarket.”\n\nStarTex argued,\n\n             Due to the numerous price changes involved in an MCPE contract, StarTex\n             had to customize its purchase to fit the particular consumption needs of Triton.\n             Every customer's consumption needs differ, and StarTex must carefully time\n             its purchases so that it has sufficient power for the customer during their peak\n             usage hours and so that it does not over-purchase during down times.

Star Electricity, L.L.C., 411 S.W.3d 42 (2013)\n\n\n\n             referred to in the industry as the “shape” of a particular customer, and like a\n             fingerprint, no two customers have an identical “shape.” Triton's meters are\n             located at commercial office buildings, and therefore, the “shape” of StarTex's\n             purchase was designed to accommodate heavy usage from the hours of 8:00 a.m.\n             to 5:00 p.m., with a slight decrease during the lunch hour, and minimal usage for\n             the remaining hours of the day. Therefore, in order to service Triton's Contract,\n             not only did StarTex commit to purchase sufficient power to cover the life of\n             the Contract, but it also committed to make purchases every fifteen (15) minutes\n             that mirror the kWh used by Triton during each fifteen (15) minute interval.\n\nThis argument was supported by the affidavit of Stephen Madden, the Senior Vice–President of\nSupply for StarTex.\n\nStarTex asserted that it provided power to Triton throughout the term of the contract and submitted\ninvoices to Triton “based on meter reads performed by CenterPoint Energy (“CenterPoint”), the\nTransmission and/or Distribution Services Provider (“TDSP”) for the Houston area.” StarTex\nfurther argued that:\n\n             On several occasions, StarTex was required to generate [Triton's] monthly\n             invoice using estimated reads based on historical usage. This was a result of\n             CenterPoint being unable to gain access to [Triton's] meters to obtain the actual\n             usage amounts. All such estimated reads were reconciled on subsequent invoices\n             once CenterPoint obtained access to the meters, such that the final invoice\n             reflected only actual usage. All estimated reads and subsequent reconciliations\n             were detailed on [Triton's] monthly invoices.\n\nStarTex provided invoices and the affidavit of Robert Verhage, the Director of Credit and\nCollections for StarTex, substantiating these arguments. Verhage averred that the invoices\nattached as summary judgment evidence were true and correct copies of Triton's monthly invoices.\nVerhage testified that, after Triton terminated the ESA on approximately October 19, 2008,\n“StarTex generated one final invoice that contained the final, outstanding balance that was\nreconciled to correct all estimated reads.” The final invoice reflected that Triton owed $155,034.18,\nand Verhage averred that Triton subsequently made $50,000.00 in payments, leaving $105,034.18\ndue and owing. Thus, StarTex argued that Triton breached the ESA *51 when it failed to pay for\n$105,034.18 worth of electricity provided under the ESA and subsequent amendments.\n\nStarTex also asserted that Triton breached the ESA when it terminated the ESA early. StarTex\nstated in its motion, and Madden averred in his affidavit, that when StarTex entered into the Second\nAmendment extending the terms of the ESA through May 2011, it contracted with the electricity\nproducer “to purchase enough power to service the entire thirty-six (36) month term of the Second\nAmendment and the purchases were tailored to fit Triton's particular ‘shape’.” Thus, the ESA\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Star Electricity, L.L.C., 411 S.W.3d 42 (2013)\n\n\n\ncontained a liquidated damages clause for early termination of the contract which entitled StarTex\nto $197,323.95 in liquidated damages after Triton unilaterally terminated the contract on October\n10, 2008, approximately thirty-one months before the contract term was set to expire in May 2011.\n\nStarTex argued, based on Madden's statements in his affidavit, that this early termination clause\nwas a valid liquidated damages provision because, “[i]n the case of an MCPE contract, it is\nimpossible to calculate the total damages that stem from an early termination until the term of the\nbreached contract has expired and StarTex has been able to complete its attempts at mitigating\nthe damages.” StarTex argued that it “must continue to purchase Triton's power from its supplier\nuntil May of 2011” and that it was required to “purchase this power in Triton's particular ‘shape’\n” even though StarTex did not have another customer to sell it to because StarTex “would have\nto find a new customer who not only wants an MCPE contract, but has the exact same term and\nvolume requirements and ‘shape’ as Triton.” StarTex thus calculated its liquidated damages as\n$197,323.25, based on the sum of Triton's three highest monthly bills because the mark-to-market\nlosses were incapable of calculation until May 2011.\n\nFinally, StarTex argued that it was entitled to attorney's fees on its breach of contract claim. It\nargued that, under its fee agreement with its counsel, it would incur attorney's fees “in an amount\nequal to twenty-five percent (25%) of all amounts recovered from [Triton],” or $75,589.36, and\nthat this amount was reasonable and necessary. The summary judgment motion was accompanied\nby the affidavit of Rodney Drinnon, counsel for StarTex, who averred to the specific services\nprovided by his firm and stated that the services described were reasonable and necessary and that\n“twenty-five percent (25%) is a reasonable contingency fee for the services provided.”\n\nOn January 28, 2010, Triton amended its answer, adding claims that StarTex “materially breached\nthe contract, which was modified by agreement,” that Triton “complied with the terms of the\nmodified contract,” that Triton was “discharged from performing under the contract after [StarTex]\nmaterially breached same,” and that StarTex failed “to mitigate its damages as required under\napplicable law, limitation of warranty, limitation of liability, laches, and waiver.” Triton also\nsought a continuance of the summary judgment hearing, which the trial court granted.\n\nOn April 5, 2010, Triton responded to StarTex's summary judgment motion. Triton did not contest\nStarTex's statements that the ESA and subsequent amendments were valid contracts. However,\nTriton asserted that StarTex “made several promises to [Triton] and [orally] modified the terms of\nthe parties' agreements.” Triton argued that Michael Gary, Triton's property manager, “had several\ndiscussions with John Bejger, a representative of StarTex, relating to StarTex's estimated usage\nand Triton's disputes over *52 the StarTex invoices.” As supported by Gary's affidavit in Triton's\nsummary judgment evidence, Gary represented to Bejger that the practice of estimating electricity\nusage for several consecutive months was causing damage to Triton because Triton could not\nbill its tenants based on estimated billing. Gary also averred that Triton had “done everything\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.               8\n\fTriton 88, L.P. v. Star Electricity, L.L.C., 411 S.W.3d 42 (2013)\n\n\n\nin its power” to give CenterPoint access to the meters and that Triton would not continue the\nbusiness relationship with StarTex “if the estimations and errors in billing continued on a month\nto month basis.” Gary further averred that Bejger represented that the errors would be corrected,\nthat StarTex was attempting to resolve the allegations that CenterPoint did not have access to\nTriton's meters, and “that StarTex's previous practice of estimating usage of consecutive months\nwould not continue.” Gary stated that Triton entered into the Second Amendment based on these\nrepresentations by Bejger. Triton's response asserted that Gary's affidavit about his discussions\nwith Bejger raised a disputed issue of material fact as to whether there was a meeting of the minds\nin reaching a valid modification.\n\nTriton also argued that it was excused from performing under the ESA based on StarTex's material\nbreach of the agreements “when it failed to provide [Triton] with accurate and correct billings for\nthe electricity that it actually delivered.” Triton's motion referenced the invoices sent by StarTex\nand provided details regarding which specific invoices were based on estimated usage, including\nseveral instances in which it was invoiced based on estimated usage in consecutive months.\n\nTriton presented Gary's affidavit, averring that Gary first contacted StarTex to resolve the\nbilling problems during the original term of the ESA and that StarTex responded by saying\nthat CenterPoint could not access and read the electricity meters in Triton's buildings. Triton\nincluded in its summary judgment evidence various e-mails between Gary and StarTex in which\nGary raised questions and disputes over the amounts billed in the invoices and StarTex provided\ninformation reconciling its charges. Gary's e-mails did not contain any specific calculations or\namounts with regard to the alleged errors or inaccuracies. StarTex's e-mail reflects that it sent\nTriton a spreadsheet demonstrating how StarTex reconciled the bills and comparing Triton's\nusage and rates. Triton also included an e-mail from CenterPoint to StarTex, received in response\nto StarTex's inquiry regarding the difficulty of getting actual meter readings. The CenterPoint\nrepresentative stated,\n\n             I disagree that CenterPoint is at fault for the estimations. Triton does not provide\n             us unencumbered, permanent, ongoing access to our meters. The estimation\n             reasons are specific to each address, but on some accounts Triton has their meters\n             locked inside a mechanical room to which we're supposed to go track down\n             an employee and a key, apparently unsuccessfully at times, perhaps because\n             the right employee can't be found. On other accounts, we're supposed to enter\n             through a locked gate where the gate code we have on record has been changed.\n             Triton has a responsibility to keep us updated if access arrangements change.\n\nTriton's summary judgment evidence also included the affidavit of Jim Phillips, the Vice President\nof IEA Engineering, an energy engineering company. Phillips stated that he reviewed StarTex's\nbilling invoices and Triton's historical electricity usage. He averred that he found\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Star Electricity, L.L.C., 411 S.W.3d 42 (2013)\n\n\n\n\n   various and repeated errors and irregularities in the billings for the Triton *53 buildings. These\n   errors include, without limitation:\n\n   • several errors in math (multiplication of energy consumption by the cost of energy);\n\n   • excessive estimated energy readings;\n\n   • estimated energy readings at one site (meter) while the next site (meter) was actually read in\n      the same month, again repeatedly;\n\n   • three meters had a monthly load factor greater than 100%, which is an impossibility (LF is\n      the maximum demand used over hours of the month—over 100% is more hours than in that\n      month);\n\n   • several examples where the ending energy reading of one month did not match the beginning\n      reading of the next month;\n\n   • energy costs are not consistent across meters in the same month;\n\n   • multiple corrections from earlier months' estimated energy reading make analysis difficult; and\n\n   • it is improbable that back to back months would have the same exact energy consumption\n      readings and that demand would remain the same for several months in a row.\n\nPhillips provided his opinion about other errors and problems with StarTex's billing practices,\nwithout providing specific contested amounts, and concluded:\n\n             In summary, the total value of the errors I analyzed came to almost $97,000.00.\n             This is not an inclusive value and with additional time to review the invoices\n             and billing, this amount should significantly increase. The numbers and values\n             I used assume that StarTex's numbers were correct; however, I found that some\n             of these numbers and values were not correct when compared to each other. To\n             this amount and the other uncalculated errors, taxes must be added since they\n             are a percentage of the energy and [TDSP] charges. The error value is therefore\n             compounded.\n\nThus, Triton argued that it “created a fact issue on each element of [its] affirmative defense” of\nprior material breach and that it raised a fact issue regarding whether StarTex conclusively proved\nthe proper amount of damages.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Star Electricity, L.L.C., 411 S.W.3d 42 (2013)\n\n\n\nTriton further responded to StarTex's summary judgment motion by arguing that StarTex violated\nthe ESA “by estimating Triton's electricity usage for no apparent justifiable reasons” and by\nestimating Triton's usage over consecutive months.\n\nTriton also argued that summary judgment on the liquidated damages issue was not proper\n“because (1) a reasonable basis for estimating just compensation in an event of default does exist\nunder the circumstances, and (2) there are factual issues that must be resolved before the legal\nquestion of liquidated damages is determined.” Finally, Triton argued that StarTex was not entitled\nto recover attorney's fees because it “made an excessive demand on [Triton] before filing its\nlawsuit.”\n\nTriton also objected to Drinnon's affidavit, arguing that it “wholly fails to describe the time that\nwas required and expended in prosecuting [StarTex's] claim, the hourly rate usually charged by\n[StarTex's] counsel, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved in this lawsuit, and the\nskill required to perform the legal service properly under the circumstances.” Triton also objected\nbecause Drinnon's affidavit was not supported by any documents other than the engagement letter.\n\nOn April 13, 2010, StarTex replied to Triton's response. StarTex presented the affidavit of John\nBejger, contesting Gary's representations that the parties entered *54 into an oral modification\nof their agreement. StarTex also argued that, “because the TDSP [CenterPoint], not StarTex, is\nsolely authorized by the State of Texas to provide actual and estimated readings [,] Bejger would\nnot have made” any representations regarding discontinuing the use of estimated meter readings in\nthe monthly invoices. Finally, StarTex argued that the parties entered into the Second Amendment\nafter the alleged oral representations and thus Triton's argument that Texas law allows modification\nof a written agreement by later oral representations was inapplicable.\n\nStarTex also argued that it did not breach the ESA. Specifically, StarTex argued that Phillips,\nTriton's energy engineer expert, did not specifically identify any breach by StarTex. StarTex\nargued that it was permitted by the ESA and Texas law to bill Triton based on estimated usage;\nthat, under the terms of the ESA, it is irrelevant why CenterPoint provided Triton's estimated usage\nrather than actual usage; and that Triton did not follow the contractual provisions requiring it to\npay undisputed portions of the invoice and to set forth in detail “calculations with respect to any\nerrors or inaccuracies claims.”\n\nStarTex again argued that the liquidated damages provision was enforceable. Finally, StarTex\nargued that its original demand to Triton was not excessive, and thus that ground did not preclude\nit from recovering attorney's fees.\n\nOn April 16, 2010, following the summary judgment hearing, Triton filed its “Supplemental\nResponse” to StarTex's summary judgment motion. StarTex objected to the supplemental response\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.              11\n\fTriton 88, L.P. v. Star Electricity, L.L.C., 411 S.W.3d 42 (2013)\n\n\n\nand asked the trial court to strike it from consideration because it was filed outside the time\npermitted by Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 166a and without leave of the trial court. Triton also\nobjected to the affidavit of John Bejger, attached to StarTex's reply to Triton's response.\n\nOn April 26, 2010, the trial court granted StarTex's motion. The trial court's order stated that it\nconsidered “the Motion, the response, the pleadings, the affidavits, other evidence on file with\nthe Court, and arguments of counsel.” The trial court awarded StarTex $105,034.18 “as actual\ndamages for [Triton's] failure to pay for electricity provided by [StarTex].” The trial court awarded\nStarTex $197,323.25 “as liquidated damages for [Triton's] early termination of the [ESA].”\nFinally, the trial court awarded StarTex $12,000 as reasonable and necessary attorney's fees, as\nwell as additional attorney's fees conditioned on an unsuccessful appeal by Triton.\n\nOn May 12, 2010, StarTex moved for a turnover order.\n\nOn May 25, 2010, Triton moved for reconsideration or a new trial. Triton supported this motion\nwith new affidavits from Jim Phillips, Michael Gary, and Montague Morgan, attorney for Triton,\nwho attempted to authenticate documents attached to Phillips' affidavit. StarTex objected to and\nmoved to strike these affidavits on the ground that Triton did not timely file them and on the\nground that Gary's affidavit was not based on his personal knowledge and was made in bad faith.\nThe trial court granted StarTex's motion and struck the affidavits of Phillips, Gary, and Morgan\nthat were attached to Triton's motion for new trial. 1\n\n *55 On June 21, 2010, the trial court denied Triton's motion for reconsideration/new trial and\nstated that it did not consider the stricken affidavits. On July 6, 2010, the trial court signed a\nmodified order stating:\n\n   On this day, after hearing [Triton's] Motion for Reconsideration/New Trial (“Motion”), the\n   Court, relying solely [on] the summary judgment evidence on file, arguments of counsel and\n   without considering the stricken, untimely supplement filed by [Triton], is of the opinion that\n   [Triton's] Motion should be, in all things, DENIED.\n\n   It is therefore ORDERED, ADJUDGED and DECREED that [Triton's] Motion is denied and\n   that the Court's order of April 26, 2010, granting Plaintiff's Traditional Motion for Summary\n   Judgment is hereby, in all things, REAFFIRMED.\n\nOn July 28, 2010, the trial court signed an order granting StarTex's motion for a turnover order\nand appointing a receiver. On September 9, 2010, the trial court signed another order requiring\nthe receiver to pay to StarTex as the judgment creditor the balance of the rents collected during\nhis receivership and any rents collected in the future until the full amount of the judgment is paid.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The movant must establish that no material\nfact issue exists and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. M.D. Anderson Hosp. &\nTumor Inst. v. Willrich, 28 S.W.3d 22, 23 (Tex.2000). Thus, for a plaintiff to prevail on its motion\nfor summary judgment, it must show that it is entitled to prevail on each element of its cause of\naction. Hourani v. Katzen, 305 S.W.3d 239, 248 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2009, pet. denied)\n(citing MMP, Ltd. v. Jones, 710 S.W.2d 59, 60 (Tex.1986)). Only if the movant conclusively\nestablishes its cause of action does the burden shift to the nonmovant to respond to the summary\njudgment. Willrich, 28 S.W.3d at 23. When reviewing a motion for summary judgment, we take\nthe nonmovant's evidence as true, indulge every reasonable inference in favor of the nonmovant,\nand resolve all doubts in favor of the nonmovant. Id.\n\nIn its first through seventh issues, Triton argues that the trial court erred in granting summary\njudgment in favor of StarTex on its breach of contract claim. The trial court awarded StarTex\nsummary judgment on both grounds of StarTex's breach of contract claim against Triton: that\nTriton breached (1) by failing to pay the invoices for electricity provided and (2) by wrongfully\nterminating the contract early.\n\n\nB. Summary Judgment on StarTex's Breach of Contract Claim for Triton's Failure to Pay\nfor Invoiced Electricity\nIn its first and second issues, Triton argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment\nbecause it misinterpreted and misapplied the law applicable to StarTex's breach of contract claim\nand to Triton's defenses. In its third issue, Triton argues that StarTex's summary *56 judgment\nevidence did not establish that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n\n [6] [7] To prevail on a breach of contract claim, a plaintiff must prove: (1) the existence of a valid\ncontract; (2) the plaintiff's performance or tender of performance; (3) the defendant's breach of\ncontract; and (4) the plaintiff's damages as a result of the breach. Prime Prod., Inc. v. S.S.I. Plastics,\nInc., 97 S.W.3d 631, 636 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2002, pet. denied). The interpretation\nor construction of an unambiguous contract is a matter of law to be determined by the court.\nSee Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Schaefer, 124 S.W.3d 154, 157 (Tex.2003). Thus, StarTex had to\nconclusively establish that a valid contract existed between it and Triton, that it performed under\nthat contract, that Triton breached the contract, and that StarTex suffered damages as a result of\nTriton's breach.\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Evidence Establishing Elements of StarTex's Claim\nAttached to its summary judgment motion, StarTex included copies of the ESA and First and\nSecond Amendments. Neither party disputes that these documents constitute a valid contract\nbetween them.\n\nStarTex also provided summary judgment evidence, including multiple invoices and the affidavits\nof two corporate representatives, that it provided electricity to Triton. Triton does not dispute that\nStarTex provided it with electricity up until Triton terminated the ESA.\n\nStarTex provided invoices and affidavits demonstrating that Triton owed $105,034.18 under the\nunpaid invoices. The account summary on the final invoice showed that Triton owed $155,034.18\nas of November 15, 2008. Verhage's affidavit testimony provided that Triton subsequently made\n$50,000.00 in payments, leaving $105,034.18 due and owing.\n\n[8] We conclude that StarTex conclusively established its right to recover $105,034.18 from\nTriton for Triton's breach of contract by failing to pay the invoices. Thus, the burden shifted to\nTriton to respond to the motion for summary judgment and present evidence raising a fact issue\non at least one of the elements of StarTex's claim or to present a valid defense. See Willrich, 28\nS.W.3d at 23.\n\n\n2. Triton's Response\nIn its fourth issue, Triton argues that it presented summary judgment evidence controverting\nStarTex's evidence and raising genuine issues of material fact as to one or more elements of\nStarTex's breach of contract claim. Triton does not dispute that StarTex provided electricity to its\nbuildings throughout the term of the contract up until Triton terminated the agreement. Neither\ndoes Triton dispute that it did not pay amounts invoiced by StarTex for the electricity provided.\nHowever, Triton disputes (1) the terms of the contract as presented by StarTex, alleging that the\nparties orally modified their agreement; (2) StarTex's satisfactory performance under the contract\nand its own excuse from performance by StarTex's prior material breach; (3) the sufficiency of\nStarTex's evidence to support the amount of damages awarded by the trial court; and (4) the trial\ncourt's implicit determination that it was not entitled to any offsets or credits.\n\n\n\n                              (a) The alleged oral modification of the contract\n\nTriton argues that, according to Gary's affidavit testimony, the agreement between the parties was\norally modified by representations Bejger made prior to execution of the Second Amendment that\ninvoices based on estimated usage would no longer be used. Gary testified that he *57 represented\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                14\n\fTriton 88, L.P. v. Star Electricity, L.L.C., 411 S.W.3d 42 (2013)\n\n\n\nto Bejger that the practice of estimating electricity usage for several consecutive months was\ncausing damage to Triton because Triton could not bill its tenants based on estimated billing\nand that Triton would not continue the business relationship with StarTex if it continued to use\nestimations and make errors in the monthly invoices. Gary averred that Bejger represented that the\nerrors would be corrected, that StarTex was attempting to resolve the allegations that CenterPoint\ndid not have access to Triton's meters, and “that StarTex's previous practice of estimating usage\nof consecutive months would not continue.” Gary stated that Triton entered into the Second\nAmendment based on these representations by Bejger. Thus, on appeal, Triton argues that it agreed\nto the Second Amendment “only after receiving assurances that the billing errors and repeated use\nof estimated billing would be addressed and corrected by [StarTex].”\n\n [9] [10] A written agreement not required by law to be in writing may be modified by a later\noral agreement. Double Diamond, Inc. v. Hilco Elec. Coop., Inc., 127 S.W.3d 260, 267 (Tex.App.-\nWaco 2003, no pet.); Mar–Lan Indus., Inc. v. Nelson, 635 S.W.2d 853, 855 (Tex.App.-El Paso\n1982, no writ). However, this principle does not apply here. The statements Gary related in his\naffidavit as being made by Bejger and orally modifying the contract were made before the parties\nentered into the Second Amendment. Thus, the statements Triton asserts as oral modifications are,\nat most, extraneous evidence of negotiations prior to entering a written contract, which constitutes\nparol evidence. 2\n\n [11] [12] [13] “An unambiguous contract will be enforced as written, and parol evidence will\nnot be received for the purpose of creating an ambiguity or to give the contract a meaning different\nfrom that which its language imports.” David J. Sacks, P.C. v. Haden, 266 S.W.3d 447, 450\n(Tex.2008). Whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law. Id. at 451. We may not use\nextrinsic evidence to contradict or vary the meaning of the explicit language of a written contract.\nNat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. CBI Indus., Inc., 907 S.W.2d 517, 521 (Tex.1995).\n\n [14] Here, the Second Amendment expressly provided that, except for the extension of the term\nof the contract and the pricing scheme outlined in paragraph one, the ESA “shall remain in full\nforce and effect as written.” This includes the “Customer Acknowledgments” section of the ESA,\nwhich expressly stated that StarTex's “ability to invoice Customer is dependent on the [TDSP's]\nability to furnish ... meter readings” and that StarTex “may invoice Customer based on estimated\nmeter reading.” As matter of law, we conclude that the Second Amendment is not ambiguous. It\nextended the terms of the ESA, including the express provision allowing StarTex to invoice Triton\nbased on estimated meter readings, to the new 36–month term.\n\nTriton failed to establish that the parties orally modified the contract.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Star Electricity, L.L.C., 411 S.W.3d 42 (2013)\n\n\n\n\n             (b) Triton's entitlement to be excused from performing under the contract\n\nTriton also argues it was excused from performance under the ESA and the subsequent *58\namendments by StarTex's prior material breach.\n\n [15] [16] “[T]he contention that a party to a contract is excused from performance because\nof a prior material breach by the other contracting party is an affirmative defense....” See City\nof The Colony v. N. Tex. Mun. Water Dist., 272 S.W.3d 699, 746 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 2008,\npet. dism'd). The burden of proving an affirmative defense is on the party asserting it. See Am.\nPetrofina, Inc. v. Allen, 887 S.W.2d 829, 830 (Tex.1994). Thus, Triton had to present evidence\nraising a fact question on each element of its defense to defeat StarTex's motion for summary\njudgment. See id. (holding, where “response was in the nature of an affirmative defense,” that\nparty asserting defense “could only have defeated summary judgment with sufficient evidence to\nraise a fact question for each of the elements” of defense).\n\n [17] [18] [19] “It is a fundamental principle of contract law that when one party to a contract\ncommits a material breach of that contract, the other party is discharged or excused from further\nperformance.” Mustang Pipeline Co. v. Driver Pipeline Co., 134 S.W.3d 195, 196 (Tex.2004). A\nbreach of contract occurs when a party fails to perform an act that it has expressly or impliedly\npromised to perform. Henry v. Masson, 333 S.W.3d 825, 835 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2010,\nno pet.). The materiality of a breach—the question of whether a party's breach of a contract will\nrender the contract unenforceable—generally presents a dispute for resolution by the trier of fact.\nId. Here, however, because we determine that StarTex's actions did not breach the contract as a\nmatter of law, we need not consider whether Triton raised a fact issue on materiality.\n\n [20] To raise a material fact issue on every element of its affirmative defense, Triton had to raise\na fact question on StarTex's prior breach of contract. Triton argues that StarTex's use of estimated\nbilling was not proper under the contract because StarTex did not establish that the conditions\nprecedent to using estimated billing had occurred because StarTex did not prove that CenterPoint\nwas unable to access Triton's meters.\n\nThe ESA provides:\n\n   Customer Acknowledgments. Customer acknowledges that [StarTex's] ability to invoice\n   Customer is dependent on the [transmission and distribution provider (TDSP) ]'s or ERCOT's\n   ability to furnish [StarTex] all necessary information including meter readings or recorded data,\n   as applicable. In the absence of such information from the TDSP or ERCOT, [StarTex] may\n   invoice Customer based on estimated meter reading according to the Usage Profile. As soon as\n   practical, and after receipt of Customer's Energy Consumption and settlement charges from the\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Star Electricity, L.L.C., 411 S.W.3d 42 (2013)\n\n\n\n   TDSP and/or ERCOT, [StarTex] will reconcile on the next invoice any difference(s) between\n   estimated and actual consumption and settlement charges.\n\nThus, the plain, unambiguous language of the ESA provided that StarTex could invoice Triton\nbased on estimated usage in the absence of actual meter readings or other necessary information\nfrom CenterPoint, the TDSP. This contract provision is consistent with the legislatively mandated\ndivision of business activities in the electric utility market. See TEX. UTIL.CODE ANN. §\n39.051(b) (providing that electricity utilities must separate their business activities into three units\n—power generation company, retail electric provider, and transmission and distribution utility);\nTex. Indus. Energy Consumers, 324 S.W.3d at 97–98 *59 (observing that transmission and\ndistribution service providers are responsible for providing metering services).\n\nStarTex provided the affidavit of Robert Verhage, who averred that, on several occasions, it had\nto rely on estimated usage because CenterPoint did not provide Triton's actual meter usage. The\nsummary judgment evidence also contained an e-mail from a CenterPoint representative stating\nthat Triton was to blame for CenterPoint's failure to obtain actual meter readings. This e-mail\nshows that CenterPoint acknowledged that it provided StarTex with estimated usage rather than\nactual readings on several occasions and that StarTex was not at fault for CenterPoint's inability\nto access and read the meters.\n\nThe ESA expressly permits invoicing based on estimated usage. Triton did not present any\nsummary judgment evidence that StarTex used estimates in its invoices on occasions when\nCenterPoint had provided actual meter readings. Thus, this argument is without merit.\n\n [21] Triton also argues that, even if StarTex was permitted to use estimates in invoicing Triton\nfor its electricity usage, StarTex was required to reconcile any charges based on estimated usage\non the next bill. However, the plain language of the contract provides that StarTex must reconcile\nthe estimated usage with the actual usage “[a]s soon as practical, and after receipt of Customer's\nEnergy Consumption and settlement charges from the TDSP.” Triton's argument that the actual\nusage was required to be reconciled on the next month's bill is not supported by the plain language\nof the contract.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that Triton has not raised a fact issue on any element of its claim that\nStarTex committed a prior material breach of the contract.\n\n\n\n                                (c) StarTex's alleged failure to prove damages\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Star Electricity, L.L.C., 411 S.W.3d 42 (2013)\n\n\n\nIn its fifth, sixth, and seventh issues, Triton argues that the invoices relied on by StarTex in\nestablishing the amount of damages were inadequate estimates and were properly objected to and\ndisputed by Triton. Thus, Triton argues that StarTex failed to prove its damages as a matter of law.\n\nStarTex acknowledges that it used estimates in some of its bills, and we have already concluded\nthat it was permitted to do so by the plain language of the contract. Furthermore, StarTex presented\nthe actual invoices it sent Triton and Verhage's affidavit stating that the final invoice relied on in\ncalculating the amount due and owing “contained the final, outstanding balance that was reconciled\nto correct all estimated reads.”\n\nTriton presented Gary's affidavit testimony that he disputed several invoices and objected to\nnumerous charges. It also presented e-mail correspondence between Gary, Triton's property\nmanager, and StarTex, in which Gary made general objections to several invoices without\nproviding specific amounts or portions of the invoices that he believed were inaccurate. Triton also\npresented an expert affidavit pointing out general complaints about the invoices without specifying\nparticular amounts in controversy.\n\nTriton argues that StarTex was legally obligated to address Triton's objections to StarTex's billing\npractices before collecting on the unpaid invoices and that this evidence raises a fact question\nregarding the amount Triton owed to StarTex.\n\n [22] The contract provides a method for disputing charges on invoices. The ESA provides that the\n“Customer must provide to [StarTex] written notice setting forth in particular detail any disputed\n *60 amount, including the calculations with respect to any errors or inaccuracies claimed.” The\nrecord contains no evidence that Triton complied with this procedure. Neither Gary's and Phillips'\naffidavit testimony nor the e-mails sent to StarTex contain specific amounts or calculations. Triton\ndid not produce any evidence that it provided StarTex with written notice articulating the particular\ndisputed amount or calculations regarding claimed inaccuracies.\n\nThus, Triton failed to present evidence raising a fact issue on the accuracy of the invoices StarTex\nused to support its claim for the unpaid amounts for electricity usage.\n\n\n\n                                 (d) Triton's entitlement to offsets and credits\n\nTriton also argues that it was entitled to $97,000 in offsets and credits, based on Phillips' affidavit.\n\n [23] “The right of offset is an affirmative defense.” Brown v. Am. Transfer & Storage Co., 601\nS.W.2d 931, 936 (Tex.1980). Triton must show its entitlement to an offset and the amount. See\nid. (holding that party asserting right of offset bears burden of pleading offset and proving facts\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Thus, Triton must present evidence raising a fact question on its offset\ndefense to defeat StarTex's motion for summary judgment. See Am. Petrofina, 887 S.W.2d at 830.\n\n [24] Triton presented Phillips' affidavit, in which Phillips, as an electricity engineer, stated that the\ninvoices contained errors entitling Triton to offsets and credits worth at least $97,000. However,\nas we have already stated, Triton did not provide a proper challenge to any particular charge or\ninvoice. Phillip's conclusory statements in his affidavit, by themselves, do not support Triton's\nclaim for offsets and credits. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 166a(f) (providing that supporting affidavit must\nset forth facts that would be admissible in evidence); Wadewitz v. Montgomery, 951 S.W.2d 464,\n466 (Tex.1997) (holding that expert's testimony will support summary judgment only if it is “clear,\npositive and direct, otherwise credible and free from contradictions and inconsistencies, and could\nhave been readily controverted” and that conclusory statements by an expert are insufficient to\nsupport or defeat summary judgment).\n\nThus, we conclude that Triton failed to raise a fact issue on any element of StarTex's breach\nof contract claim against Triton for failure to pay the invoices. The trial court did not err in\ndetermining that Triton was entitled to summary judgment on this issue as a matter of law.\n\n\nC. Summary Judgment on StarTex's Breach of Contract Claim for Triton's Early\nTermination of the Contract\nIn parts of its first through seventh issues, Triton also argues that the trial court erred in granting\nsummary judgment on StarTex's breach of contract claim for Triton's wrongful early termination\nof the agreement.\n\n\n1. Evidence Establishing Elements of StarTex's Claim\nAs we have discussed, StarTex established the existence of a valid contract between itself and\nTriton, and it established that it performed under that contract. StarTex provided a copy of the\nSecond Amendment, which provided that the parties agreed to extend the ESA through May 2011.\n\nThe ESA contained the following early termination provision:\n\n   Early Termination Fee. In the event that Customer terminates this agreement *61 or Customer\n   defaults as described [in the ESA], then an Early Termination Fee will be assessed. The Early\n   Termination Fee shall be equal to the greater of a) the three months highest bills for Customer\n   or b) any mark to market costs.\n\nStarTex presented Verhage's affidavit testimony that Triton terminated the agreement on October\n10, 2008, approximately thirty-one months earlier than the Second Amendment's contractual\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   19\n\fTriton 88, L.P. v. Star Electricity, L.L.C., 411 S.W.3d 42 (2013)\n\n\n\ntermination date of May 2011, and Triton's final invoice reflecting a termination date in the middle\nof October 2008.\n\nStarTex likewise provided Madden's affidavit testimony that StarTex was harmed by Triton's early\ntermination. Madden averred that when StarTex entered into the Second Amendment extending\nthe terms of the ESA through May 2011, it contracted with its electricity producer “to purchase\nenough power to service the entire thirty-six (36) month term of the Second Amendment and the\npurchases were tailored to fit Triton's particular ‘shape’.” After Triton unilaterally terminated the\ncontract on October 10, 2008, StarTex was still obligated to continue to purchase power from its\nsupplier through May 2011 “in Triton's particular ‘shape,’ ” even though StarTex no longer had a\ncustomer to whom to sell it. Madden testified that it was almost impossible to sell that electricity\nto another customer because StarTex “would have to find a new customer who not only wants\nan MCPE contract, but has the exact same term and volume requirements and ‘shape’ as Triton.”\nAccording to Madden, these particular characteristics of a MCPE payment arrangement made it\nvery difficult to calculate the mark-to-market losses because StarTex had no way of knowing what\nthe exact cost of the future electricity would be. StarTex thus calculated its liquidated damages as\n$197,323.25 based on the sum of Triton's three highest monthly bills.\n\n\n2. Triton's response\nTriton does not contest that it terminated the contract in October 2008, approximately thirty-one\nmonths before the termination date provided in the Second Amendment. Triton again argues that\nits early termination was excused by StarTex's prior breach by billing based on estimated usage.\nWe have already concluded that StarTex did not breach the ESA when it invoiced Triton based\non its estimated usage.\n\nTriton also raises several issues specific to the early termination clause and the trial court's award\nof liquidated damages. In its ninth issue, Triton argues that the early termination fee clause is\nunenforceable as an impermissible penalty. Triton argues in its tenth and eleventh issues that\neven if the early termination fee clause is enforceable as a matter of law, StarTex did not present\nsummary judgment evidence establishing the amount of the early termination fee in compliance\nwith the contract's terms.\n\n\n\n                                (a) Enforceability of early termination clause\n\nTriton argues that the early termination fee clause constitutes an impermissible penalty. Triton\nargues that it is impermissible both under the common law standard set out in Phillips v. Phillips,\n820 S.W.2d 785 (Tex.1991), and under the Texas Business and Commerce Code.\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Star Electricity, L.L.C., 411 S.W.3d 42 (2013)\n\n\n\n [25] [26] [27] [28] Whether a contractual provision is an enforceable liquidated damages\nprovision or an unenforceable penalty is a question of law for the court to decide. Dorsett,\n164 S.W.3d at 664 (citing Phillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788). Valid liquidated damages clauses “fix\nin advance the compensation to a party accruing from the failure to *62 perform specified\ncontractual obligations.” Dorsett, 164 S.W.3d at 664. To enforce a liquidated damages clause,\nthe court must find that (1) the harm caused by the breach is incapable or difficult of estimation\nand (2) the amount of liquidated damages called for is a reasonable forecast of just compensation.\nPhillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788; GPA Holding, Inc. v. Baylor Health Care Sys., 344 S.W.3d 467, 475\n(Tex.App.-Dallas 2011, pet. denied). The party asserting that the provision is unenforceable bears\nthe burden of proof. GPA Holding, 344 S.W.3d at 475.\n\n [29] Triton argues that the harm caused by its breach is not incapable or difficult of estimation.\nTriton argues that StarTex “could determine the amount of electricity that would have been\npurchased by Triton but for the purported breach ... and determine what the electricity was sold for\nto an alternate customer versus what it would have been sold for to Triton.” However, StarTex's\nSenior Vice–President of Supply, Stephen Madden, provided affidavit testimony that it is almost\nimpossible to know what the cost of Triton's future energy use would have been because of the\nconstantly fluctuating prices involved in the MCPE pricing structure. He averred that the price\nof electricity changes as often as every fifteen minutes, that StarTex committed to buy electricity\nin fifteen minute increments to meet its obligation to provide electricity conforming to Triton's\nunique “shape” of energy consumption, and thus it would be very difficult to find another consumer\nto use that energy. Accordingly, it was not possible to determine, at the time of Triton's early\ntermination, the cost of the energy that would have been purchased by Triton but for the breach,\nand it was also very difficult for StarTex to predict whether it would find another consumer to\npurchase the electricity according to Triton's unique usage pattern, and if so, how much such a\nconsumer would pay.\n\nTriton did not present any evidence regarding the parties' ability to estimate actual damages when\nthe contract was formed, and it did not controvert Madden's description of the pricing model\napplicable to the ESA and Second Amendment. Thus, we conclude that it was impossible to\ndetermine the actual harm that would be caused by early termination. See Phillips, 820 S.W.2d\nat 788.\n\nTriton also appears to argue that the amount of the liquidated damages was not a reasonable\nforecast of StarTex's actual damages because it was unreasonably large. The ESA provided that\nthe early termination fee “shall be equal to the greater of a) the three months highest bills for\nCustomer or b) any mark to market costs.” In this instance, due to the length of the term remaining\non the terminated contract and the uncertainties of pricing, the “mark to market costs” could not\nbe calculated. Thus, Madden testified that StarTex calculated its damages based on Triton's three\nhighest monthly bills, which totaled $197,323.25.\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.              21\n\fTriton 88, L.P. v. Star Electricity, L.L.C., 411 S.W.3d 42 (2013)\n\n\n\n\n [30] Triton did not present any evidence regarding what a reasonable forecast of damages would\nhave been at the time the contract was formed, nor did it present any evidence of StarTex's actual\ndamages. Thus, we conclude that, when viewed as of the time the contract was executed, the ESA's\nmethod for calculating the amount of liquidated damages provided a reasonable forecast of just\ncompensation. See id.\n\n [31] This same reasoning also demonstrates that Triton failed to show that the early termination\nfee violated Business and Commerce Code section 2.718. Section 2.718 provides that a liquidated\ndamages clause is unenforceable if (1) the *63 agreed amount is unreasonable in light of the\nanticipated or actual harm caused by breach, (2) the proof of actual harm is not difficult, (3)\nobtaining an adequate remedy for breach is not inconvenient or not feasible, or (4) the agreed\namount is unreasonably large. See TEX. BUS. & COM.CODE ANN. § 2.718 (Vernon 2009).\nAs we have already discussed, the proof of actual harm is difficult, and obtaining an adequate\nremedy for breach is not feasible because StarTex could not have calculated the future cost of\nthe electricity, nor could it predict the extent to which it could mitigate its damages. And, the\nagreed amount was not unreasonably large or unreasonable in light of the anticipated or actual\nharm. StarTex was obligated to buy thirty-one months' worth of electricity that it had no ability\nto resell. In that light, liquidated damages calculated from Triton's three highest monthly invoices\nare not unreasonable.\n\nTriton failed to raise a fact question on its claim that the early termination fee clause constituted\nan impermissible penalty.\n\n\n\n                                   (b) StarTex's proof of liquidated damages\n\nTriton also argues that StarTex failed to prove the amount of liquidated damages permitted under\nthe ESA. Several of Triton's arguments on this issue again challenge the accuracy of StarTex's\nbilling and StarTex's use of estimates in its invoices. However, we have already determined that\nTriton has failed to raise a fact question regarding the accuracy or propriety of StarTex's invoices.\nThus, we do not address those arguments again.\n\nTriton argues that StarTex failed to identify which three invoices it relied on in calculating the\nliquidated damages. It also argues that no three invoices from the term of the Second Amendment\nadd up to $197,323.95, and, thus, StarTex improperly used invoices dated prior to the execution\nof the Second Amendment to calculate the early termination fee. However, the early termination\nfee provision did not limit the time period from which the three highest bills could be taken, and\nTriton failed to present these arguments to the trial court. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 166a(c) (“Issues\nnot expressly presented to the trial court by written motion, answer or other response shall not\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Haden, 332 S.W.3d\nat 513.\n\n\nB. Analysis\n [37] In its motion for summary judgment, StarTex sought $75,589.36 in attorney's fees, and\nits attorney, Rodney Drinnon, submitted an affidavit in support of an award for attorney's fees.\nDrinnon averred that the contingency fee agreement awarding twenty-five percent of damages\nrecovered from any successful trial award constituted usual and customary attorney's fees; he\nprovided a list of specific tasks he and his law practice undertook during the course of representing\nStarTex; and he stated that his fee was supported by several, listed Arthur Andersen factors.\nDrinnon's description was “ ‘clear, positive, and direct, otherwise credible’ and [was] neither\ninternally inconsistent nor [contradictory]” and could have been readily controverted by Triton.\nSee id. at 514. Based on Drinnon's affidavit, submitted as evidence in support of the request for\nattorney's fees, StarTex was entitled to the statutory presumption that its attorney's usual and\ncustomary fees were reasonable. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 38.003; see also\nHaden, 332 S.W.3d at 514 (holding attorney's affidavit sufficient to warrant summary judgment\nwhen it (1) contained recitals establishing attorney's competency to swear to facts stated and\nother requirements of Rule of Civil Procedure 166a(f), (2) described work encompassed by the\nfees sought, and (3) specified factors that formed basis of his statement that amount claimed was\nreasonable and necessary, tracking seven of eight Arthur Andersen factors).\n\nTriton filed a written objection to Drinnon's affidavit, arguing that it failed to describe the time\nrequired to prosecute StarTex's claim, to provide counsel's hourly rate, and to discuss two of the\nArthur Andersen factors. We have already concluded that Drinnon's affidavit was sufficient *65\nto support StarTex's claim for attorney's fees. See Haden, 332 S.W.3d at 514. Triton did not file a\ncontroverting affidavit or any other evidence disputing Drinnon's evidence. Because Triton did not\npresent any controverting evidence, Triton cannot overcome the presumption of reasonableness\naccorded to Drinnon's affidavit in support of an award of attorney's fees. See id. at 514–16 (holding\nthat because nonmovant “did not controvert [attorney's] affidavit or otherwise dispute the law\nfirm's evidence, the law firm was ... entitled to the statutory presumption that the requested amount\nwas both reasonable and necessary”).\n\n [38] [39] Triton also argues that StarTex is not entitled to attorney's fees on the basis of its\naffirmative defense that StarTex made an excessive demand on Triton prior to filing suit. See Kurtz\nv. Kurtz, 158 S.W.3d 12, 21 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2004, pet. denied). When a claimant\nmakes an “excessive” demand and will not accept a lesser amount, the claimant is not entitled\nto attorney's fees expended in litigation thereafter, even if it prevails on its breach of contract\nclaim. See, e.g., McMillin v. State Farm Lloyds, 180 S.W.3d 183, 209 (Tex.App.-Austin 2005,\npet. denied) (citing Findlay v. Cave, 611 S.W.2d 57, 58 (Tex.1981)).

Star Electricity, L.L.C., 411 S.W.3d 42 (2013)\n\n\n\nsimply because it is greater than the amount eventually awarded. See Findlay, 611 S.W.2d at 58.\nThe dispositive question is whether the claimant acted unreasonably or in bad faith in making\nthe demand. See Standard Constructors, Inc. v. Chevron Chem. Co., 101 S.W.3d 619, 627–28\n(Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2003, pet. denied).\n\n [40] StarTex's demand letter requested $105,034.18 as principal on the unpaid invoices,\n$14,290.98 in interest and fees, $197,323.95 in liquidated damages, and $68,329.82 in attorney's\nfees. It stated that Triton should pay the listed amounts within thirty days or make arrangements\nto satisfy the debt. Thus, the amounts demanded by StarTex prior to filing suit were not so much\ngreater than the amount it was eventually awarded as to be “excessive” or to indicate that the\ndemand was made in bad faith. Triton presented no evidence that StarTex would have refused\ntender of the $314,358.13 awarded by the trial court. Triton has failed to establish that this\nexception to StarTex's statutory right to attorney's fees is met. See Findlay, 611 S.W.2d at 58;\nMcMillin, 180 S.W.3d at 209.\n\nWe hold that the trial court did not err in awarding StarTex $12,000 in attorney's fees.\n\nWe overrule Triton's twelfth point of error.\n\n\n\n                                                      Other Issues\n\nA. PUC Rules and Procedures for Disputed Charges\n [41] In its eighth issue, Triton argues that its pending claim against StarTex before the PUC acted\nto stay the judgment and enforcement of the judgment. In its brief, Triton also argues that StarTex\nfailed to properly investigate Triton's complaints according to the PUC's rules and procedures.\nHowever, Triton did not present these arguments to the trial court. Furthermore, the only indication\nbefore this Court that Triton actually filed a complaint with the PUC is Triton's statement in its\nappellate brief. We conclude that these complaints are not properly presented for our review. See\nTEX.R. CIV. P. 166a(c); Marek v. Tomoco Equip.

Star Electricity, L.L.C., 411 S.W.3d 42 (2013)\n\n\n\nIn its thirteenth and fourteenth issues, Triton argues that, because the trial court erred in granting\nsummary judgment, the trial court also erred in appointing a receiver and in ordering Triton to turn\nover to the receiver confidential records and all proceeds and revenues generated by its businesses.\nThus, Triton argues that it is entitled to immediate relief from the order appointing a receiver and\nthe turnover order, including return of all records and revenues turned over to or seized by the\nreceiver. We have already concluded that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment.\nTherefore, this argument fails.\n\nWe overrule Triton's thirteenth and fourteenth issues.\n\n\n\n                                                               Conclusion\n\nWe affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\nJustice SHARP concurring in the judgment only.\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    StarTex moved this Court to strike the affidavits Triton submitted with its motion for reconsideration or new trial from the appellate\n        record. Those affidavits were part of Triton's motion, and “any filing that a party designates to have included in the record” is a proper\n        part of the clerk's record. TEX.R.APP. P. 34.5(a)(13). Therefore, we DENY StarTex's motion. We note, however, that the affidavits\n        attached to Triton's motion for reconsideration or new trial are not relevant to our review of the trial court's summary judgment. See\n        TEX.R.

Triton objected to this\n        evidence in the trial court, but it is not clear whether Triton is arguing on appeal that Bejger's affidavit should not be considered.\n        However, it is unnecessary for us to consider Bejger's testimony as the terms of the contract are established as a matter of law.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Liquidated damages or penalty. The parties to a contract may effectively provide in advance the\ndamages that are to be payable in the event of breach as long as the provision does not disregard\nthe principle of compensation. The enforcement of such provisions for liquidated damages saves\nthe time of courts, juries, parties and witnesses and reduces the expense of litigation. This is\nespecially important if the amount in controversy is small. However, the parties to a contract are\nnot free to provide a penalty for its breach. The central objective behind the system of contract\nremedies is compensatory, not punitive. Punishment of a promisor for having broken his promise\nhas no justification on either economic or other grounds and a term providing such a penalty is\nunenforceable on grounds of public policy. See Chapter 8. The rest of the agreement remains\nenforceable, however, under the rule stated in § 184(1), and the remedies for breach are determined\nby the rules stated in this Chapter. See Illustration 1. A term that fixes an unreasonably small\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 1\n\f§ 356Liquidated Damages and Penalties, Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 356 (1981)\n\n\n\namount as damages may be unenforceable as unconscionable. See § 208. As to the liquidation of\ndamages and modification or limitation of remedies in contracts of sale, see Uniform Commercial\nCode §§ 2-718, 2-719.\n\nb. Test of penalty. Under the test stated in Subsection (1), two factors combine in determining\nwhether an amount of money fixed as damages is so unreasonably large as to be a penalty. The first\nfactor is the anticipated or actual loss caused by the breach. The amount fixed is reasonable to the\nextent that it approximates the actual loss that has resulted from the particular breach, even though\nit may not approximate the loss that might have been anticipated under other possible breaches.\nSee Illustration 2. Furthermore, the amount fixed is reasonable to the extent that it approximates\nthe loss anticipated at the time of the making of the contract, even though it may not approximate\nthe actual loss. See Illustration 3. The second factor is the difficulty of proof of loss. The greater the\ndifficulty either of proving that loss has occurred or of establishing its amount with the requisite\ncertainty (see § 351), the easier it is to show that the amount fixed is reasonable. To the extent\nthat there is uncertainty as to the harm, the estimate of the court or jury may not accord with the\nprinciple of compensation any more than does the advance estimate of the parties. A determination\nwhether the amount fixed is a penalty turns on a combination of these two factors. If the difficulty\nof proof of loss is great, considerable latitude is allowed in the approximation of anticipated or\nactual harm. If, on the other hand, the difficulty of proof of loss is slight, less latitude is allowed\nin that approximation. If, to take an extreme case, it is clear that no loss at all has occurred, a\nprovision fixing a substantial sum as damages is unenforceable. See Illustration 4.\n\n\n     Illustrations:\n     Illustrations:\n\n           1. A and B sign a written contract under which A is to act in a play produced by B for a\n           ten week season for $4,000. A term provides that “if either party shall fail to perform as\n           agreed in any respect he will pay $10,000 as liquidated damages and not as a penalty.”\n           A leaves the play before the last week to take another job. The play is sold out for that\n           week and A is replaced by a suitable understudy. The amount fixed is unreasonable in\n           the light of both the anticipated and the actual loss and, in spite of the use of the words\n           “liquidated damages,” the term provides for a penalty and is unenforceable on grounds\n           of public policy. The rest of the agreement is enforceable (§ 184(1)), and B's remedies\n           for A's breach are governed by the rules stated in this Chapter.\n\n           2. A, B and C form a partnership to practice veterinary medicine in a town for ten years.\n           In the partnership agreement, each promises that if, on the termination of the partnership,\n           the practice is continued by the other two members, he will not practice veterinary\n           medicine in the same town during its continuance up to a maximum of three years. A\n           term provides that for breach of this duty “he shall forfeit $50,000 to be collected by the\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                       2\n\f§ 356Liquidated Damages and Penalties, Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 356 (1981)\n\n\n\n           others as damages.” A leaves the partnership, and the practice is continued by B and C. A\n           immediately begins to practice veterinary medicine in the same town. The loss actually\n           caused to B and C is difficult of proof and $50,000 is not an unreasonable estimate of it.\n           Even though $50,000 may be unreasonable in relation to the loss that might have resulted\n           in other circumstances, it is not unreasonable in relation to the actual loss. Therefore,\n           the term does not provide for a penalty and its enforcement is not precluded on grounds\n           of public policy. See Illustration 14 to § 188.\n\n           3. A contracts to build a grandstand for B's race track for $1,000,000 by a specified date\n           and to pay $1,000 a day for every day's delay in completing it. A delays completion for\n           ten days. If $1,000 is not unreasonable in the light of the anticipated loss and the actual\n           loss to B is difficult to prove, A's promise is not a term providing for a penalty and its\n           enforcement is not precluded on grounds of public policy.\n\n           4. The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 3, B is delayed for a month in\n           obtaining permission to operate his race track so that it is certain that A's delay of ten\n           days caused him no loss at all. Since the actual loss to B is not difficult to prove, A's\n           promise is a term providing for a penalty and is unenforceable on grounds of public\n           policy.\n\nc. Disguised penalties. Under the rule stated in this Section, the validity of a term providing for\ndamages depends on the effect of that term as interpreted according to the rules stated in Chapter\n9. Neither the parties' actual intention as to its validity nor their characterization of the term as\none for liquidated damages or a penalty is significant in determining whether the term is valid.\nSometimes parties attempt to disguise a provision for a penalty by using language that purports to\nmake payment of the amount an alternative performance under the contract, that purports to offer a\ndiscount for prompt performance, or that purports to place a valuation on property to be delivered.\nAlthough the parties may in good faith contract for alternative performances and fix discounts or\nvaluations, a court will look to the substance of the agreement to determine whether this is the case\nor whether the parties have attempted to disguise a provision for a penalty that is unenforceable\nunder this Section. In determining whether a contract is one for alternative performances, the\nrelative value of the alternatives may be decisive.\n\n\n     Illustration:\n     Illustration:\n\n           5. A contracts to build a house for B for $50,000 by a specified date or in the alternative\n           to pay B $1,000 a week during any period of delay. A delays completion for ten days.\n           If $1,000 a week is unreasonable in the light of both the anticipated and actual loss, A's\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Related types of provisions. This Section does not purport to cover the wide variety of provisions\nused by parties to control the remedies available to them for breach of contract. A term that fixes as\ndamages an amount that is unreasonably small does not come within the rule stated in this Section,\nbut a court may refuse to enforce it as unconscionable under the rule stated in § 208. A mere\nrecital of the harm that may occur as a result of a breach of contract does not come within the rule\nstated in this Section, but may increase damages by making that harm foreseeable under the rule\nstated § 351. As to the effect of a contract provision on the right to equitable relief, see Comment\na to § 359. As to the effect of a term requiring the occurrence of a condition where forfeiture\nwould result, see § 229. Although attorneys' fees are not generally awarded to the winning party,\nif the parties provide for the award of such fees the court will award a sum that it considers to\nbe reasonable. If, however, the parties specify the amount of such fees, the provision is subject\nto the test stated in this Section.\n\ne. Penalties in bonds. Bonds often fix a flat sum as a penalty for non-occurrence of the condition of\nthe bond. A term providing for a penalty is not unenforceable in its entirety but only to the extent\nthat it exceeds the loss caused by the non-occurrence of the condition.\n\n\n     Illustration:\n     Illustration:\n\n           6. A executes a bond obligating himself to pay B $10,000, on condition that the bond\n           shall be void, however, if C, who is B's cashier, shall properly account for all money\n           entrusted to him. C defaults to the extent of $500. A's promise is unenforceable on\n           grounds of public policy to the extent that it exceeds the actual loss, $500.\n\n\n\n                                              Reporter's Note\n\nThis Section is based on former §§ 339 and 579, but Subsection (1) has been redrafted to harmonize\nwith Uniform Commercial Code § 2-718(1).

Bunker, Paul Carrell, Everett Brew Houston,\n              Jr., W. Andrew Buchholz, Scott J. Leighty, Jad L.\n              Davis, and Holly Clause (collectively, “the\n              Physicians”).    Strandhagen sought declarations\n              against them that (1) she was terminated without\n              cause, meaning the liquidated damages provision in\n              the parties’ contract would be inapplicable to her;\n              and (2) the liquidated damages provision was an\n              unenforceable penalty. (CR.4-9).\n\n Course of    The Physicians filed a Plea to the Jurisdiction\nProceedings   seeking dismissal of Strandhagen’s claims. (CR.77-\n              84). The trial court granted the Plea as to ground (1)\n              and denied it as to ground (2). (CR.184; Appx. 2).\n\n              Strandhagen then filed a Motion for Summary\n              Judgment on ground (2). (CR.154-159).\n\nTrial Court   The trial court granted Strandhagen’s Motion,\nDisposition   declaring the liquidated damages provision to be an\n              unenforceable penalty. (CR.212; Appx. 1). This\n              resulted in a Final Judgment.\n\n              The Physicians filed a Motion for New Trial, urging\n              in regard to ground (2) of Strandhagen’s claim that it\n              was error to deny the Physicians’ Plea and to grant\n              Strandhagen’s Motion. (CR.213-227). Following a\n              hearing, the trial court denied the Physicians’ Motion\n              for New Trial. (CR.271; RR.1-29; Appx. 3). The\n              Physicians timely perfected appeal.

See Tex. R. App. P. 39.1, 39.2.\n\n      This case presents unique facts borne from Strandhagen’s decision to\n\nfile a preemptive lawsuit against the Physicians while simultaneously\n\npursuing a separate yet related claim in a different forum against their\n\nparent company. This case also presents important and unsettled legal\n\nquestions as applied to these facts, including: (1) What elements of proof\n\nare required to prevail on an affirmative defense of “unenforceable\n\npenalty?”, and (2) When is a declaratory judgment claim sufficiently ripe\n\nfor review?\n\n\n\n\n                                       xi\n\f                         ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n\nIssue 1:   Was it reversible error for the district court to grant\n           Strandhagen’s traditional motion for summary judgment\n           declaring the parties’ liquidated damages provision to be an\n           unenforceable penalty?\n\n\n\nIssue 2:   Was it reversible error for the district court to deny the portion\n           of the Physicians’ Plea to the Jurisdiction contending that\n           Strandhagen’s claim was not yet ripe for decision?\n\n\n\n\n                                    xii\n\f                           STATEMENT OF FACTS\n      Dr. Tracy Strandhagen, an anesthesiologist, left her medical practice\n\ngroup approximately five years prior to the expiration of the seven-year\n\nterm that she had contractually agreed to work. (CR.160; Sealed.CR.12).\n\nBefore Strandhagen’s partners decided whether to sue her for breach of\n\ncontract or other claims, Strandhagen filed this preemptive lawsuit seeking\n\njudicial declarations that would preclude her partners from recovering\n\nagainst her under the liquidated damages provision of the parties’ contract\n\nif they decided to bring a future claim against her. (CR.4-9). Strandhagen\n\nnamed as defendants seven individual partners, who were the then-current\n\nmembers of the practice group’s Advisory Board (Appellants Dr. Noah S.\n\nBunker, Dr. Paul Carrell, Dr. Everett Brew Houston, Jr., Dr. W. Andrew\n\nBuchholz, Dr. Scott J. Leighty, Dr. Jad L. Davis, and Dr. Holly Clause)\n\n(collectively, “the Physicians”).         (CR.1-3, 162, 179). 1     The trial court\n\ngranted declaratory relief in favor of Strandhagen. (CR.212, 271). The\n\nPhysicians urge this Court to reverse that decision.\n\n\n\n\n1      Although Strandhagen appears to have chosen these defendants based on their\nprior service on the Board, she sued them in their individual capacities, not in their\ncapacities as Board members.\n\n\n                                          1\n\fI.      THE PARTIES ENTERED A SERIES OF CONTRACTS\n        GOVERNING THEIR MEDICAL PRACTICE.\n\n        Tracy Strandhagen and approximately sixty other anesthesiologists\n\nwere members of the Austin Anesthesiology Group (“AAG”). (CR.38, 160).\n\nIn October 2011, they collectively decided to sell 100% of their outstanding\n\ninterests in AAG to American Anesthesiology of Texas (“AAT” or “the\n\nCompany”)2 pursuant to a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement\n\n(“the Purchase Agreement”).                    (CR.38, 77, 155, 162). 3            The\n\nanesthesiologists thereby became “physician partners” of AAT (“the\n\nPartners”). 4 (CR.162). In connection with this transaction, the Company\n\nand the Partners entered two types of additional contracts. (CR.162, 186-\n\n187).\n\n        First, the Company and the Partners entered an Advisory Board and\n\nInternal Operations Agreement (“the Operations Agreement”). (CR.77,\n\n162-183; Appx. 4). This agreement (1) established the duties, powers, and\n\n\n\n2      AAT is an indirect subsidiary of a national medical services provider, Mednax,\nInc. (CR.6, 80; Sealed.CR.11).\n3    A copy of the Purchase Agreement is not included in the record. It is referenced,\nhowever, by the other contracts contained therein. (See CR.162; Sealed.CR.1).\n\n4       Under the assorted agreements, the anesthesiologists are referred as the\n“Physicians,” “Partners,” and/or “Physician Partners.” Herein, when referenced as an\nentire group, they will be called the “Partners.” To distinguish this from references to\nthe seven, individual physicians named as defendants in this lawsuit, the latter will be\ncalled the “Physicians.”\n\n\n                                           2\n\fprocedures of the Partners’ Advisory Board, Medical Director, and Partners’\n\nRepresentative; (2) identified the individuals who would serve the initial\n\nterms of those positions; and (3) set forth the obligations owed by each\n\nphysician to the other Partners and the Company. (Id.).\n\n      Second, the Company entered separate Employment Agreements\n\nwith each of the Partners “to protect the business interests and goodwill of\n\n[the Company] and to promote the effective administration and\n\ncontinuation of the Practice.” (Sealed.CR.1, 3, 12; see also CR.111, 155, 166-\n\n167).5 As shown by Strandhagen’s contract, the Employment Agreements\n\nset forth, inter alia, (1) the duties, services, and standards of conduct that\n\nthe Partners promised to provide; (2) the parties’ billing and compensation\n\nagreements;    and   (3)   the   terms    of   the   Partners’   non-competes.\n\n(Sealed.CR.1-12, 24). Importantly, the Employment Agreements specified a\n\nset number of years that each Partner agreed to work for the practice (“the\n\nInitial Term”). (CR.167; Sealed.CR.12). Strandhagen’s contract specified\n\nthat “the term of [the Employment Agreement] shall be a period of seven\n\n(7) years,” which would expire in approximately October 2018.\n\n(Sealed.CR.12). 6\n\n\n5     Strandhagen’s Employment Agreement was submitted as a sealed, in camera\n“Exhibit A-1” as part of the summary-judgment record and in connection with the\nMotion for New Trial. (CR.146-147, 150-152, 271; Sealed.CR; RR.23-24, 28).\n\n\n\n                                      3\n\f      A.     The Partners Promised to Stay With the Practice for a\n             Defined Period for Important Financial Reasons.\n\n      The Partners’ agreements to stay with the practice for a designated\n\nperiod of time was tied to the amount of monetary consideration they\n\nreceived under the Purchase Agreement. (See CR.144, 167-168). Their\n\ncollective agreements to stay for a designated number of years also had\n\nimportant financial implications for the practice.              First, each of the\n\nphysicians brought to the practice many years of experience and goodwill\n\nthat could not be readily replaced in the event of an early departure. (See\n\nSealed.CR.1). Strandhagen’s Employment Agreement reflects that she, like\n\nher Partners, “ha[d] practiced medicine in the Specialty for many years and\n\n[] developed substantial personal goodwill, including business contacts,\n\nreputation, and other relationships in the health care industry.”\n\n(Sealed.CR.1).\n\n      Beyond the Partners’ goodwill value, the profitability of their practice\n\nalso depended on each Partner working a designated shift schedule, as\n\ndetermined by the Medical Director.             (CR.168; Sealed.CR.2-3).         They\n\nworked in “units” to fulfill the schedule, which required the cooperation\n\nand dedication of each Partner. (Sealed.CR.2, 7, Annex A, B). Fulfillment\n\n\n6      It appears that the majority of the Partners, like Strandhagen, agreed to seven-\nyear terms while seven of them negotiated shorter terms of employment. (See CR.168;\nSealed.CR.12).\n\n\n                                          4\n\fof these obligations allowed the practice to earn annual gross profits, which\n\ndirectly affected the Partners’ ability to earn annual incentive bonuses.\n\n(CR.187; Sealed.CR.9, Annex A, B).\n\n     B.    The Partners Agreed to be Bound by a Liquidated\n           Damages Provision Regulating Early Departure from\n           their Practice.\n\n     In recognition of the financial importance of the Partners remaining\n\nwith the practice for the entire duration of their agreed-upon terms, they\n\ncollectively agreed to be bound by a liquidated damages provision stating\n\nthat, if a Partner departed the practice early, he or she would be liable to\n\nthe remaining Partners for a specified amount of damages, subject to\n\ncertain exceptions. (CR.168). More specifically, the Operations Agreement\n\nprovided that—given (1) the consideration received by the Partners under\n\nthe Purchase Agreement and the calculation of bonuses based upon the\n\nprofits of the Company, and (2) the Partners’ agreements to work for a\n\nspecified Initial Term—if any Partner departed early, the others “may suffer\n\nharm, including, without limitation, increased workloads necessitated by\n\nsuch termination, material impairment of the ability of the Physicians to\n\nearn bonuses, . . . material impairment of the Physicians’ relationships with\n\nhospitals and other [parties] . . ., and hiring and training costs related to\n\nreplacement physicians.” (CR.167-168, 187).\n\n\n                                     5\n\f     The Partners “acknowledge[d] and agree[d]” that such that damages\n\nwould be difficult to prove, and that it would otherwise be inconvenient or\n\nnon-feasible to obtain another adequate remedy. (CR.168). Thus, they\n\nagreed that if any Partner terminated his or her employment prior to the\n\nexpiration of the Initial Term (with some exceptions, as discussed below),\n\nthen he or she would pay the remaining Partners “as liquidated\n\ndamages and not as a penalty, the amount set forth below.” (CR.168)\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n     The majority of the sixty Partners agreed to be bound by a liquidated\n\ndamage amount of $500,000. (CR.156, 168). Seven others negotiated\n\nindividual liquidated damages amounts between $240,000 and $400,000,\n\npresumably tied to having negotiated shorter “Initial Terms” of\n\nemployment.     (CR.168).    The Partners “each acknowledge[d] and\n\nagree[d] that the Liquidated Damages Amount is reasonable in\n\nlight of the anticipated harm which would be caused by a Terminating\n\n[Partner’s] breach of or default under this Agreement, the difficulty of proof\n\nof loss, the inconvenience and non-feasibility of otherwise obtaining an\n\nadequate remedy, and the value of the transactions to be consummated\n\nunder the Purchase Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.”\n\n(CR.168) (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n                                      6\n\f      The Partners agreed to several exceptions in which the liquidated\n\ndamages provision would not be enforced. First and foremost, a Partner\n\nwould not be liable for liquidated damages if the Company terminated the\n\nPartner’s employment without cause prior to expiration of the Initial Term.\n\n(CR.168). The Employment Agreement specified events that would provide\n\nthe Company “cause” for termination. (Sealed.CR.13-18). Second, a Partner\n\nwould not be liable for liquidated damages if his or her employment ended\n\nearly due to the Partner’s death or disability, a down-sizing of the company,\n\nor similar specified exceptions. (CR.169). Finally, each Partner had the\n\noption of petitioning for permission by the majority to terminate his or her\n\nemployment early without payment of liquidated damages in the event of\n\n“unforeseen circumstances” or “to provide other services to the Company or\n\nits Affiliates.” (CR.169).\n\n      The Partners expressly acknowledged the importance of these\n\nprovisions. The Operations Agreement states that their “agreement to be\n\nbound by the covenants set forth herein, which [] are narrowly tailored and\n\nnecessary to protect the Physicians’ legitimate interests as a group,”\n\nconstituted a “significant inducement to [the Partners] entering into the\n\nPurchase Agreement and consummating the transaction contemplated\n\nthereby.” (CR.162).\n\n\n\n                                      7\n\fII.    STRANDHAGEN DEPARTED THE PRACTICE FIVE YEARS\n       EARLIER THAN SHE HAD CONTRACTUALLY AGREED.\n\n       Under Strandhagen’s Employment Agreement, the initial seven-year\n\nterm of her employment was not set to expire until approximately October\n\n2018. (Sealed.CR.12).     Strandhagen’s employment was terminated five\n\nyears early, between July-September 2013. (CR.88, 160, 187).\n\n       Strandhagen claimed she was constructively discharged on the basis\n\nof gender discrimination in July 2013. (CR.88, 93, 101). If that were true,\n\nit would provide a “terminated without cause” exception to her liability\n\nunder the liquidated damages provision. (CR.168). To the contrary, the\n\nCompany claimed that, following a series of disciplinary infractions,\n\nStrandhagen quit or was terminated with cause in September 2013.\n\n(CR.103, 144). Under that circumstance—whether Strandhagen resigned\n\nwithout first obtaining permission from the majority of her partners for an\n\nearly departure or was rightfully terminated for engaging in detrimental\n\nconduct, failing or refusing to adhere to specified policies and standards, or\n\nbreaching other terms of her Employment Agreement—Strandhagen would\n\nbe liable for payment of liquidated damages. (CR.167-169; Sealed.CR.13-\n\n15).\n\n\n\n\n                                      8\n\fIII. STRANDHAGEN FILED SEPARATE PROCEEDINGS AGAINST\n     THE COMPANY AND HER PHYSICIAN PARTNERS.\n\n       In approximately December 2013, Strandhagen filed an employment-\n\ndiscrimination complaint against the Company with the Texas Workforce\n\nCommission, Civil Rights Division and the EEOC. (CR.39, 80, 85-87, 91-\n\n92).   Despite having not made any representation of discrimination in\n\nconnection with the buyout just two months earlier, Strandhagen now\n\nclaimed that she had suffered such discrimination “for many years.”\n\n(CR.93, 144). The primary issue in Strandhagen’s proceeding against the\n\nCompany was, therefore, whether she was terminated with or without cause\n\n(i.e., whether Strandhagen’s termination resulted from her misconduct or\n\nwas based on gender discrimination).\n\n       While those administrative claims were pending, Strandhagen\n\ninitiated this suit in the Travis County District Court against seven of her\n\nPartners: Drs. Bunker, Carrell, Houston, Buchholz, Leighty, Davis, and\n\nClause (“the Physicians”). (CR.4). Strandhagen’s sole cause of action was a\n\ndeclaratory judgment claim. (CR.40). She sought declarations that:\n\n\n\n\n                                     9\n\f     (1)   she was terminated without cause, meaning the liquidated\n           damages provision is inapplicable to her; and\n\n     (2)   the liquidated damages provision is an unenforceable\n           penalty because:\n\n           (a)   the resulting harm from Strandhagen’s early\n                 termination was not incapable or difficult of\n                 estimation,\n\n           (b)   the liquidated damages amount is not a reasonable\n                 forecast of just compensation, and\n\n           (c)   it purports to render her liable to the Physicians for\n                 a breach of her Employment Agreement to which\n                 they are not parties or third-party beneficiaries.\n\n(CR.40-41).\n\n\nIV. THE DISTRICT COURT DISMISSED PART AND GRANTED\n    PART OF THE DECLARATORY RELIEF STRANDHAGEN\n    SOUGHT AGAINST THE PHYSICIANS.\n\n     The Physicians filed a Plea to the Jurisdiction seeking dismissal of\n\nboth grounds of Strandhagen’s declaratory judgment claim. (CR.70, 77).\n\nThe Physicians argued: (1) Strandhagen’s request to declare whether or not\n\nshe was terminated for cause duplicated the primary issue pending before\n\nthe TWC/EEOC, and she was required to exhaust her administrative\n\nremedies first; and (2) Strandhagen’s challenge to the liquidated damages\n\nprovision was not ripe because the Physicians had not made any demand\n\nnor sued her to collect such damages. (CR.79-80). The district court (the\n\n\n\n                                    10\n\fHonorable Steven Yelenosky presiding) granted the first argument, thereby\n\ndismissing ground (1) of Strandhagen’s declaratory judgment claim, and\n\ndenied the second, maintaining jurisdiction over ground (2) of\n\nStrandhagen’s claim. (CR.184). Strandhagen does not appeal the dismissal\n\nof ground (1) of her claim.\n\n      Strandhagen then moved for a traditional summary judgment\n\ngranting ground (2) of her claim.         In so doing, she abandoned her\n\ncontention that (a) the resulting damages would be incapable or difficult of\n\nestimation, instead arguing only that the liquidated damages provision was\n\nunenforceable as a matter of law because (b) the amount to be paid was not\n\na reasonable forecast of just compensation, and (c) the Physicians were not\n\nthird-party beneficiaries of her Employment Agreement. (CR.154, 196).\n\nFollowing the Physicians’ Response, further briefing by both parties, and a\n\nhearing, the district court (the Honorable Orlinda Naranjo presiding)\n\ngranted Strandhagen’s motion.      (CR.186-212).   Without specifying any\n\ngrounds, the Court “declare[d] that the $500,000 purported liquidated\n\ndamages clause in the . . . Operations Agreement is an unenforceable\n\npenalty,” and denied all other relief not expressly granted. (CR.212). This\n\nresulted in a final judgment. (CR.212).\n\n\n\n\n                                     11\n\f      The Physicians filed a Motion for New Trial urging several reasons\n\nwhy the grant of summary judgment was improper, as argued below.\n\n(CR.213-250). The Court denied the motion following a hearing on its\n\nmerits. (CR.271; RR.1-29). The Physicians appealed. (CR.272-78).\n\n\n                  SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n      This Court must decide whether to uphold the plain language of a\n\ncontract that was mutually-agreed to by parties of equal sophistication or,\n\ninstead, allow one of those parties (Strandhagen) to secure a premature\n\navoidance of the contractual liability provision before any actual dispute\n\nhas arisen and without sufficient evidence to support her request.     The\n\ndistrict court improperly refused to enforce the parties’ contract and\n\ngranted Strandhagen advisory relief.     This Court should reverse those\n\nerrors.\n\n      The first issue is whether the district court erred in granting\n\nStrandhagen a traditional summary-judgment when she failed to satisfy her\n\nburden of conclusively proving each element of her affirmative defense that\n\nthe liquidated damages provision in the parties’ Operations Agreement is\n\nan unenforceable penalty. The answer is yes. The summary-judgment\n\norder should be reversed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    12\n\f      Strandhagen failed to establish the two essential elements of her\n\nclaim.   She unequivocally abandoned the first element (that damages\n\nresulting from her breach would be difficult to estimate), and she failed to\n\noffer conclusive proof of the second element (that the liquidated amount\n\nwas an unreasonable forecast of the actual damages). In regard to the\n\nlatter, Strandhagen (a) offered no evidence of the actual damages to\n\nestablish an unreasonable disparity; (b) her contentions ignore the plain\n\nlanguage of the contract; and (c) in any event, a fact issue exists about\n\nwhether the court should modify the liquidated amount rather than strike it\n\nall together.\n\n      Strandhagen also failed to establish that it was necessary for the\n\nPhysicians to be third-party beneficiaries of her Employment Agreement to\n\nenforce the liquidated damages provision under their own Operations\n\nAgreement. Even had such status been required, Strandhagen did not\n\nsatisfy her summary-judgment burden of conclusively negating its\n\nexistence.\n\n      The second issue is whether the district court erred in denying the\n\nportion of the Physicians’ Plea to the Jurisdiction arguing that\n\nStrandhagen’s declaratory judgment claim was unripe. Again, the answer is\n\nyes. The partial denial of the Plea should be reversed. This presents an\n\n\n\n                                     13\n\falternative basis to reverse the summary judgment because such relief\n\nshould not have been granted in the absence of jurisdiction. Strandhagen’s\n\nclaim misuses the Declaratory Judgment Act by seeking an advance ruling\n\non a potential affirmative defense to a dispute that has not yet (and may\n\nnever) come to exist. As such, the district court’s grant of a declaration in\n\nher favor was advisory and improper.\n\n\n                               ARGUMENT\n        In two issues, the Physicians respectfully request that this Court\n\nreverse the district court’s (1) grant of Strandhagen’s traditional Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment on her declaratory judgment claim, and (2) partial\n\ndenial of the Physician’s Amended Plea to the Jurisdiction. If the latter is\n\nreversed, then a judgment dismissing Strandhagen’s claims should be\n\nrendered in favor of the Physicians.       See Texas Dept. of Crim. Justice-\n\nCmty.

THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED BY GRANTING\n          STRANDHAGEN’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT.\n\n        Strandhagen’s Motion for Summary Judgment should have been\n\ndenied because she failed to conclusively establish (1) the essential\n\n\n                                      14\n\felements of her claim and (2) that the status of the Physicians as third-\n\nparty beneficiaries to her Employment Agreement had any impact on the\n\nenforceability of the liquidated damages provision. In any event, as argued\n\nunder Issue 2, the court erred in granting summary judgment on a\n\nhypothetical (unripe) question because it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction\n\nto do so.\n\n      A.

Strandhagen and the\n\nPhysicians disagree, however, about which elements she was required to\n\nprove to be entitled to summary judgment. The Physicians argue she had\n\nto prove two elements, while Strandhagen claims she had to prove only one\n\nor the other. (CR.188-189, 196, 262).\n\n      Although the Texas Supreme Court has not definitively answered this\n\nlegal question, several intermediate courts—including this one—have\n\nreached the conclusion urged by the Physicians. See infra. In any event,\n\nbecause Strandhagen failed to conclusively prove both elements, the orders\n\ngranting her summary judgment and denying the Physicians’ Motion for\n\nNew Trial should be reversed. (RR.14).\n\n\n           1.    Strandhagen was required              to   conclusively\n                 establish two elements.\n\n      The most on point opinion is GPA Holding, 344 S.W.3d at 476. Like\n\nStrandhagen, GPA moved for summary judgment urging that the liquidated\n\ndamages clause in its contract with Baylor was an unenforceable penalty.\n\nId.   The Dallas Court held that, “[t]o obtain summary judgment on the\n\n\n\n                                    17\n\faffirmative defense of penalty, GPA [as the party seeking to avoid\n\nenforcement of the provision] must prove each element of the defense.”\n\nId. (emphasis added). GPA’s required elements were that: (1) the harm\n\nresulting from a breach was not incapable or difficult of estimation, and (2)\n\nthe amount of liquidated damages provided by the contract was not a\n\nreasonable forecast of actual damages.

(CR.157, 197-98, 264). This contention is\n\ninsufficient without any proof of how the liquidated damage amount was\n\ncalculated or what the actual damages were.\n\n      Strandhagen relied on cases holding that a liquidated damages\n\nprovision may be unenforceable if it imposes the same amount of liability\n\nfor breaches that are both trivial and severe. (CR.198). This is not the case\n\nunder the Operations Agreement. Here, the liquidated damages provision\n\napplies to only one form of breach: a Partner’s early departure from the\n\npractice. (CR.167-168). It does not apply, for example, to non-material\n\nbreaches like the Advisory Board’s failure to hold a regular meeting\n\n(CR.163) or its failure to take a written vote upon request (CR.164).\n\n      Strandhagen attempts to transform the time of the breach into a\n\nmeasure of its materiality. But Strandhagen presented no evidence to\n\nestablish that the financial impact on the remaining Partners would be\n\nsubstantially greater or lesser depending on the timing of another Partner’s\n\nearly departure.    As previously discussed, important financial reasons\n\n\n\n                                     26\n\fsupported the Partners’ agreement to be bound by this liquidated damages\n\nclause, including the anticipated impact that one’s early departure would\n\nhave on the practice’s gross profits and the Partners’ abilities to earn annual\n\nbonuses, as well as the resulting loss of experience and goodwill, which\n\ncould not be easily or quickly replaced. Supra, Statement of Facts Section\n\nI.A. These financial considerations could be the same whether Strandhagen\n\nquit on day 1 or day 1,000.      Strandhagen offered no evidence to prove\n\notherwise.   Instead, she simply claimed that “the consequences of Dr.\n\nStrandhagen’s employment terminating obviously varies over time.”\n\n(CR.157). This unsupported allegation does not suffice to meet her burden.\n\n      Strandhagen’s “one size fits all” contention also fails in light of the\n\nseveral exceptions to the liquidated damages provision.         (CR.167-169).\n\nSeveral types of “early departures” were carved out from application off the\n\nprovision. These exceptions eliminate the imposition of any liability for\n\nearly termination scenarios that would not constitute a material breach of\n\nthe contract (such as early termination based on disability or with\n\npermission by the majority). Hence, the clause was narrowly drafted, not\n\nan unenforceable “one size fits all” provision.\n\n      Moreover, relevant legal authorities are contrary to Strandhagen’s\n\ncontention. The fact that a liquidated damages provision awards a uniform\n\n\n\n                                      27\n\famount for the breach of a term agreement regardless of the date of the\n\nbreach is not per se unreasonable. In Murphy v. Cintas Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1640220\"><a href=\"/opinion/1640220/murphy-v-cintas-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">663</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 666 (Tex. App.—Tyler 1996, writ denied), Murphy claimed that the\n\nliquidated damages provision was an unenforceable penalty because it\n\nimposed the same amount of damages for early cancellation of the parties’\n\nagreement whether it resulted from his failure to pay for one of the\n\ncontemplated goods (at the end of the contract’s term) or all of them (at the\n\nbeginning).   Id.   The court rejected this argument and enforced the\n\nprovision. Id. at 666-667.\n\n     The Restatement of Contracts regarding liquidated damages is\n\nconsistent with Murphy. See RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 356,\n\nLiquidated Damages and Penalties (1981).           Comment (b), “Test of\n\nPenalty,” states that a liquidated damages amount “is reasonable to the\n\nextent that it approximates the actual loss that has resulted from the\n\nparticular breach, even though it may not approximate the loss that might\n\nhave been anticipated under other possible breaches.”         Id. (emphasis\n\nadded). Thus, this Court needs to determine only whether Strandhagen\n\nconclusively established that the liquidated amount was an unreasonable\n\nforecast of the actual damages resulting from this particular breach (her\n\n\n\n\n                                     28\n\ffive-year premature departure from the practice). Strandhagen offered no\n\nprove to establish this element.\n\n      According to Restatement Section 356, whether the liquidated\n\namount reasonably forecast other breaches that may have occurred is not a\n\nbasis to deny the provision’s enforceability in this case.       Id.   This is\n\nconfirmed by Illustration 2 to Section 356. In that example, partners A, B,\n\nand C formed a veterinary practice promising to remain as a partnership for\n\nten years. Id. The liquidated damages clause provided that, if one partner\n\nterminated early (and the others continued the business), and the\n\nterminating partner breached his duty of non-competition, he would be\n\nliable for $50,000. This provision is enforceable because “[e]ven though\n\n$50,000 may be unreasonable in relation to the loss that may have resulted\n\nin other circumstances, it is not unreasonable in relation to the actual loss.”\n\nId.\n\n      In the absence of any evidence from Strandhagen to support her\n\nclaim that the liquidated damages amount was not a reasonable forecast of\n\njust compensation—and especially considering that all inferences must be\n\nconstrued in favor of the Physicians as nonmovants—the record fails to\n\nconclusively demonstrate that Strandhagen satisfied her burden of proof on\n\n\n\n\n                                      29\n\fthis element. This Court should reject Strandhagen’s facial challenge just\n\nas the court did in Murphy, 923 S.W.2d at 666.\n\n                   (b)   Plain language of contract shows reasonable\n                         forecast.\n      Beyond the lack of evidence in support of Strandhagen’s contention\n\nthat the liquidated damages amount was an unreasonable forecast of the\n\nactual damages, the plain language of the parties’ contract demonstrates\n\nthat it was not.    The Court would be required to disregard or render\n\nmeaningless certain portions of the contract to accept Strandhagen’s\n\nargument.\n\n      In determining whether Strandhagen has satisfied her burden on the\n\naffirmative defense of penalty, this Court must keep in mind the basic rules\n\nof contract construction, as recognized in GPA Holding, 344 S.W.3d at 471.\n\n“The court’s primary concern in interpreting a written contract is to\n\ndetermine the mutual intent of the parties as manifested in the contract, . . .\n\nand the agreement must be enforced as written.” Id. Terms should be given\n\ntheir plain and ordinary meaning, and interpretations that render any\n\nportion meaningless should be avoided. Id.\n\n      This Court considered the plain language of the contract as a basis for\n\nrejecting a penalty defense and enforcing a liquidated damages provision in\n\nSouthern Union Co. v. CSG Systems, Inc., No. 03-04-00712CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n\n                                      <span class=\"page\">30</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\f171349, *4-6 (Tex. App.—Austin Jan. 27, 2005, no pet.). There, the contract\n\nstated that the damages provision was included “[b]ecause of the difficulty\n\nin ascertaining CSG’s actual damages for a termination or other breach of\n\nthe Agreement,” and that “CSG would have been unwilling to provide the\n\nServices at the fees set forth in the Agreement” had Southern Union not\n\npromised “certainty of revenue” by obligating itself to pay the\n\ndiscontinuance fee in the event that it breached the contract.” Id. at *4.\n\nThe damages provision also “expressly state[d] that it ‘is not a penalty’ and\n\nthat it ‘is a reasonable estimation of the actual damages which CSG would\n\nsuffer if CSG were to fail to receive the amount of processing business as\n\ncontemplated by this Agreement.’” Id. at *6. The Court clarified that,\n\n“[a]lthough parties cannot avoid a challenge to a liquidated damages\n\nprovision simply by characterizing it as ‘reasonable,’ such express language\n\nis instructive of the parties’ intent when the terms are mutually bargained\n\nfor between equally competent parties.” Id.\n\n     This Court also put weight on the fact that the “provision was a\n\nbargained-for exchange, negotiated and approved by both companies.” Id.\n\n“When a provision is mutually bargained for by equally competent parties,\n\nwe give deference to its enforcement. . . . From the face of the contract,\n\nSouthern Union understood at the time it entered the agreement that CSG’s\n\n\n\n                                     31\n\fdamages would be difficult to estimate and therefore agreed a liquidated\n\ndamages provision was necessary.” Id.\n\n     Much like the Southern Union/CSG contract, the Operations\n\nAgreement between Strandhagen and her Partners expressly stated that the\n\nstipulated amount was to be paid “as liquidated damages, and not as a\n\npenalty,” and that the amount was “reasonable in light of the anticipated\n\nharm which would be caused by a Terminating Physician’s breach or\n\ndefault under this Agreement.”      (CR.168).   Additionally, the Partners\n\nagreed that the contract’s provisions were “narrowly tailored and necessary\n\nto protect the Physicians’ legitimate interests as a group,” and that they\n\nconstituted a “significant inducement to [the Partners] entering into the\n\nPurchase Agreement, and consummating the transaction contemplated\n\nthereby.” (CR.162).\n\n     Also like the Southern Union/CSG contract, Strandhagen and her\n\nPartners were mutually competent parties who voluntarily and knowingly\n\nentered this bargained-for exchange. (CR.162, 173-178). Hence, this Court\n\nshould defer to the plain language of the Operations Agreement, which\n\nevidences the parties’ mutual intent for the liquidated damages provision to\n\nbe valid and enforceable, and not construed as a penalty. To do otherwise\n\nwould impermissibly render meaningless the express provisions of the\n\n\n\n                                    32\n\fcontract stating that the damages provision was reasonable, narrowly-\n\ntailored, a necessary inducement, and not a penalty.\n\n                    (c)   Fact issue exists regarding modification.\n      Finally, to any extent the Court believes Strandhagen offered proof\n\nthat the damages provision was not a reasonable forecast of actual\n\ndamages, she has still failed to conclusively establish this element of her\n\ndefense because the “Severability” clause in the parties’ contract creates a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact.\n\n      Section 7(f) of the Operations Agreement provides:\n\n               Severability. . . . In the event that any provision of\n               this Agreement shall be declared by a Court of\n               competent jurisdiction to exceed the limits such\n               court deems reasonable and enforceable, said\n               provisions shall be deemed modified to the\n               minimum extent necessary to make such\n               provisions reasonable and enforceable.\n\n(CR.171) (emphasis added).\n\n      “An illegal or unconscionable provision of a contract may generally\n\nbe severed so long as it does not constitute the essential purpose of the\n\nagreement.” In re Poly-Am., L.P., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895041\"><a href=\"/opinion/895041/in-re-poly-america-lp/\"><span class=\"volume\">262</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">337</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 357, 360 (Tex. 2008)\n\n(recognizing that, pursuant to the parties’ contract, the arbitrator “would be\n\nfree to modify” terms found to be unconscionable rather than striking them\n\naltogether).

App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1999, orig. proceeding).\n\n      Here, the liquidated amount could be modified in a narrow fashion\n\nwithout undermining the essential purpose of the parties’ contract. The\n\nexpress purpose of the Operations Agreement was to “establish an Advisory\n\nBoard and set forth certain understandings and agreements among\n\nthemselves regarding the operations of their practice.”        (CR.162).    The\n\nspecific amount of liquidated damages applicable to any particular\n\nphysician was not the “essential purpose” of the Agreement.\n\n      In light of the Severability clause, the district court erred by declaring\n\nthe liquidated damages provision wholly unenforceable as a matter of law.\n\nEven if the court considered $500,000 to be an unreasonable liquidated\n\namount, the court should have concluded that a genuine issue of material\n\nfact exists about what modified amount or calculation would be reasonable\n\nto enforce in its place, keeping with the parties’ express intent to modify the\n\nterm “to the minimum extent necessary.”          To do otherwise, the Court\n\nwould have to impermissibly rewrite the parties’ bargained-for exchange to\n\nstrike out the final sentence of Paragraph 7(f), which is a mandatory\n\nprovision voluntarily agreed to by the parties. Alternatively, if this Court\n\n\n\n\n                                      34\n\fconcludes the Severability clause is ambiguous, then it creates a genuine\n\nissue of material fact requiring reversal and remand. (RR.12-14, 22-23).\n\n     C.    Strandhagen Failed to Satisfy her Summary-Judgment\n           Burden Regarding the Physicians’ Status as Third-\n           Party Beneficiaries.\n\n     Strandhagen also moved for summary judgment based on her\n\nargument that the liquidated damages provision is unenforceable because it\n\nseeks to render her liable to the Physicians for a breach of her Employment\n\nAgreement, to which the Physicians are not parties or third-party\n\nbeneficiaries. (CR.157-158). This did not provide a valid basis for summary\n\njudgment because (1) Strandhagen’s liability for liquidated damages arises\n\ndirectly from the Operations Agreement between her and her Physician\n\nPartners, and does not require that the Physicians be third-party\n\nbeneficiaries of her Employment Agreement; and/or (2) Strandhagen failed\n\nto conclusively establish that the Physicians were not third-party\n\nbeneficiaries of the Employment Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n                                    35\n\f           1.    The Operations Agreement Provides a Direct Line\n                 of Liability.\n\n     Paragraph 5 of the Operations Agreement provides:\n\n           [I]f [any Partner] terminates his or her employment\n           with the Company prior to the expiration of the\n           Initial Term, the Physicians may suffer harm [as\n           specified therein]. . . . In light of the foregoing, if a\n           [Partner’s] employment with the Company is\n           terminated for any reason during the Initial Term .\n           . . other than a termination without cause . . . then\n           such [Terminating Partner] shall promptly pay . . .\n           as liquidated damages and not as a penalty . . . the\n           amount set forth below.\n\n\n(CR.167-168).\n\n     This provision creates a direct line of liability for liquidated damages\n\nbetween an early-terminating physician and her remaining Partners based\n\non the direct harm that will be suffered by the remaining Partners as a\n\nresult of the early termination. (Id.). Under this provision, there is no need\n\nfor the Physicians to be third-party beneficiaries of the Employment\n\nAgreement to enforce the liquidated damages clause.         The Physicians (if\n\nthey sued Strandhagen for breach of contract) would not be attempting to\n\nrecover under the Employment Agreement as third-party beneficiaries.\n\nRather, they would be seeking and are entitled to directly enforce the\n\nliability provisions contained within the four corners of their own contract\n\nwith Strandhagen. (RR.10-11).\n\n\n                                      36\n\f            2.    A Genuine Issue of Material Fact Remains about\n                  the Physicians’ Third-Party Beneficiary Status.\n\n      Alternatively, even if the Court were to conclude that the Physicians\n\nare required to be third-party beneficiaries of Strandhagen’s Employment\n\nAgreement to enforce the liquidated damages clause under the Operations\n\nAgreement, it was error to grant summary-judgment on this ground\n\nbecause Strandhagen did not conclusively establish the absence of such\n\nthird-party beneficiary status.\n\n      Strandhagen’s Motion for Summary Judgment states in a single,\n\nconclusory sentence that the Physicians “are [not] third-party beneficiaries”\n\nto the Employment Agreement.         (CR.158).   She did not provide any\n\nevidence or analysis about the intention of the Employer or herself (or any\n\nof the other Partners) when entering their Employment Agreements, nor\n\nabout the meaning of the contract as a whole. Strandhagen failed to satisfy\n\nher traditional summary-judgment burden on this ground. See Alvarado v.\n\nLexington Ins.

THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED BY DENYING PART OF THE\n           PHYSICIANS’ PLEA TO THE JURISDICTION.\n\n      The Physicians’ Amended Plea to the Jurisdiction argued, in part, that\n\nStrandhagen’s request for a declaration that the liquidated damages\n\nprovision was an unenforceable penalty was not yet ripe for decision\n\nbecause the Physicians had not yet decided whether to sue her for breach of\n\ncontract, much less made a demand or filed suit on that basis. (CR.79-80).\n\nIn the absence of a live, justiciable controversy, the court lacked subject-\n\nmatter jurisdiction over Strandhagen’s claim. (CR.79-80). On this basis,\n\nthe district court erred by denying this portion of the Physician’s Plea and\n\nby granting an advisory summary judgment on Strandhagen’s unripe\n\ndeclaratory judgment claim, and by denying the opportunity to correct this\n\nerror in response to the Motion for New Trial. (CR.184-85, 212, 271). This\n\nCourt should reverse these decisions and render judgment dismissing\n\nStrandhagen’s claims for a lack of jurisdiction.\n\n      A.

Civ. App.—Austin 1969, writ ref’d\n\nn.r.e.) (where plaintiff merely alleged, without any supporting proof, that\n\ndefendant had “indicated an intention” to seek statutory penalty against\n\nplaintiff, and defendant denied that allegation in its pleadings, there was no\n\nevidence that a bona fide controversy existed giving rise to any justiciable\n\nissues between the parties; hence, declaratory judgment was improper).7\n\n\n7      LHR Enterprises and Margolis involved statutory penalties available to the State\nin specified circumstances. While the cases are procedurally similar to the instant case\nin that they presented un-ripe claims for declaratory relief related to the enforcement of\nthese remedies prior to a pending demand for their recovery, they are substantively\n\n\n                                           42\n\f      B.     Strandhagen’s Claim Is Not Ripe.\n\n      The    declaration    sought    by      Strandhagen    merely    presents    a\n\nhypothetical or contingent question about what damages may be available\n\nif the Physicians were to pursue a claim against her in the future for breach\n\nof contract. Strandhagen only speculated that she has “learned . . . [the\n\nPhysicians] and perhaps others are seeking to pursue her for collection,”\n\nbut she failed to offer any proof that a live, justiciable controversy actually\n\nexisted. (CR.8, 112). The Physicians generally denied all of Strandhagen’s\n\nallegations, specifically pled that her claim has not matured, and moved for\n\ndismissal based on their specific contention to the contrary. (CR.74-75, 79).\n\nA potential breach of contract suit against Strandhagen is not a certain,\n\nimminent, or unavoidable controversy.             At best, it is hypothetical or\n\ncontingent on other events. Hence, there is not a sufficiently ripe dispute\n\nbetween these parties about which declaratory relief may be appropriately\n\ngranted. Strandhagen’s attempt to misuse the Declaratory Judgment Act to\n\nobtain an advance ruling on her affirmative defense should be dismissed.\n\n\n\n\ndistinct in that they involved “penalties” rather than a liquidated damages clause as\nhere.\n\n\n                                         43\n\f                                  PRAYER\n      Based on the foregoing, Appellants respectfully pray that this Court\n\nsustain both of their issues on appeal and reverse the district court’s grant\n\nof Strandhagen’s Motion for Summary Judgment, its partial denial of the\n\nPhysicians’ Plea to the Jurisdiction, and its denial of the Physicians’ Motion\n\nfor New Trial. If the jurisdictional ruling is reversed, then this Court should\n\nrender judgment in favor of the Physicians dismissing Strandhagen’s claim\n\nin its entirety. Otherwise, this Court should remand to the district court for\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n      Appellants further pray that this Court tax all costs against\n\nStrandhagen, both in this Court and below, and award the Appellants any\n\nsuch other relief at law or equity to which they may be justly entitled.

KEYES, Justice.\n\nAppellee, Lexington Insurance Company (“Lexington”), moved for rehearing of our April 19,\n2012 opinion. We grant the motion for rehearing, withdraw our April 19, 2012 opinion and\njudgment, and issue this opinion and judgment in their stead. Our disposition remains the same.\nWe dismiss Lexington's May 21, 2012 motion for en banc reconsideration as moot. 1\n\nAppellant, Javier Alvarado, sued Lexington for breach of contract, breach of the duty of good faith\nand fair dealing, and violations of the Texas Insurance Code and the Deceptive Trade Practices Act\n(“DTPA”) after Lexington rejected Alvarado's claim for property damage following Hurricane Ike.\nThe trial court rendered summary judgment in favor of Lexington. In one issue, Alvarado contends\nthat the trial court erred in rendering summary judgment because Lexington did not conclusively\nnegate Alvarado's status as a third-party beneficiary under the “force-placed” insurance policy\nissued by Lexington to Alvarado's mortgage lender.\n\nWe reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n                                                  Background\n\nBefore May 2008, Alvarado maintained homeowner's insurance on his property with Columbia\nLloyds. Alvarado testified by affidavit that when he refinanced his mortgage in May 2008 with\nFlagstar Bank (“Flagstar”), a Flagstar representative informed him that he had to cancel his policy\nwith Columbia Lloyds and that Flagstar would obtain homeowner's insurance on his behalf.\nFlagstar obtained a “force-placed” insurance policy on Alvarado's property with Lexington (“the\nPolicy”). 2 Alvarado's *547 monthly payments to Flagstar included the principal and interest on\nhis mortgage, as well as taxes and the premiums on the Policy.\n\nIn September 2008, Alvarado's property sustained damage as a result of Hurricane Ike. Flagstar\nmade a claim on the Policy, and Lexington paid Flagstar $4,410.49 in damages. According to\nAlvarado's affidavit, Flagstar did not provide any of these funds to Alvarado for the purpose of\nrepairs, and it did not apply these funds to the balance of his mortgage. The application of these\nfunds is not part of the record.\n\nAfter Lexington denied his claim for damages, Alvarado sued Lexington for breach of contract,\nbreach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and various violations of the Texas Insurance\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

It argued that Alvarado could not recover on\nany of his claims because Lexington never entered into a contract with Alvarado; Alvarado was\nneither a named insured nor an additional insured on the Policy; Flagstar obtained the Policy “to\nprotect its interest in the residence for which Flagstar was the mortgagee”; the Policy provided\nthat all payments for damages were to be made solely to Flagstar; and the Policy “expressed no\nintent to benefit [Alvarado] in any way.” Lexington contended that Alvarado did not qualify as a\nthird-party beneficiary of the Policy and that, as a result, no legal relationship existed between it\nand Alvarado and Alvarado lacked standing to bring his claims. 4\n\nAs summary judgment evidence, Lexington attached a copy of the Policy as Exhibit A. Lexington\npointed out that the “Common Policy Declarations” in the Policy provide that “Flagstar Bank,\nFSB” is the “named insured” and that the “Mortgage Guard Property Policy” section further\ndefines “named insured” as “the Lending Institution named on the Declaration Page” and “you”\nas “the Named Insured shown in the Declarations.” It further pointed out that the Policy states,\n“In consideration of the premium to be charged we will (as shown on the Declaration Page)\ninsure ... the Lending Institution (you, as shown on the Declaration Page) against direct physical\nloss resulting from destruction of or damage to your property....” It also pointed to language in the\nPolicy stating that the Policy provides coverage for the dwelling, other structures on the property,\npersonal property, and loss of use “in which the insured has a mortgage and/or owner interest.”\nLexington argued that, although the Policy covers personal property, that coverage is limited to\nthe extent to which Flagstar, as *548 the named insured, has a mortgage or ownership interest\nin the property.\n\nThe Policy also includes the following “Mortgage Clause”:\n\n            Loss, if any, under this policy will be payable to the mortgagee (or trustee) as\n            its interests may appear under all present or future mortgages upon the Covered\n            Property described on the reporting forms in which mortgagee may have an\n            interest as mortgagee (or trustee) in order of precedence of said mortgages.\n\nLexington pointed out that the “Loss Payable” clause provides, “Loss will be adjusted with and\nmade payable to you unless another payee is specifically named.” It observed that this clause does\nnot provide that Alvarado, the borrower, is entitled to proceeds in excess of Flagstar's insurable\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

He argued that this endorsement directly benefits him and supports his third-party\nbeneficiary status. Alvarado pointed to language in Endorsement # 12 defining “insured” as “[y]ou\nand residents of your household” and defining “insured location” as the “residence premises,”\nwhich is further defined as “[t]he one family dwelling where you reside.” He contended that this\nlanguage refers to him and not to Flagstar, the mortgage company. Alvarado also pointed out\nthat Endorsement # 12 provides coverage for direct physical loss to property, additional living\nexpenses, personal property damage, personal liability for suits brought against the insured for\nbodily injury or property damage, and medical payments to others. He contended that this coverage\ncould only apply to him and not to Flagstar. He also argued that Endorsement # 12 confers a benefit\nupon him because the endorsement's “Mortgage Clause” provides, “If a mortgagee is named in this\npolicy, any loss payable under Coverage A or B will be paid to the mortgagee and you, as interests\nappear.” According to Alvarado, “This clearly shows that the word ‘you’ in the Endorsement\nrefers to [Alvarado] ... but it does not necessarily refer to the mortgagee which would be Flagstar\nBank.” Therefore, Alvarado contended, because Endorsement # 12 “was intended to confer a direct\nbenefit” on him, he qualifies as a third-party beneficiary of the Policy.\n\nLexington replied and argued that Endorsement # 12 “only provides homeowners coverage for\nproperty and damages in which Flagstar has a mortgage and/or an ownership interest.” (Emphasis\nin original.) Lexington contended that the\n\n            Supplemental Declaration Page [to the Policy] qualifies every statement\n            made about homeowner's insurance in the Policy, leaving no doubt that\n            all homeowner's coverage statements and inclusions are meant solely and\n            exclusively to pertain to the insured, Flagstar Bank's, interest. Any references\n            [Alvarado] makes to the Homeowners Coverage Form are limited by the\n            Supplemental Declaration Page.\n\n(Emphasis in original.) Lexington argued that, under the supplemental declarations, any coverage\nprovided pursuant to the Policy is limited to property or damages in which the named insured,\nwhich is defined in the Common Policy Declarations solely as Flagstar, has a mortgage or\nownership interest. Lexington also argued that the Policy language clearly defines “you” as *549\nthe “Named Insured shown in the Declarations” and that Alvarado is not named as an insured,\nadditional insured, or third-party beneficiary in any part of the Policy, including Endorsement # 12.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Nor is there any evidence as to what\nFlagstar's and Alvarado's interests in the property are. However, there is some evidence, in the form\nof Alvarado's affidavit, that Flagstar submitted a claim under the Policy to Lexington for damage\nto Alvarado's property and that Flagstar did not repair the damage, did not distribute the funds to\nAlvarado to repair the damage, and did not apply the funds to the balance of Alvarado's mortgage.\n\n [1] On August 19, 2010, the trial court granted Lexington's motion for summary judgment.\nBecause Alvarado's claims against Bower, Flagstar, and Proctor Financial remained pending, this\nwas an interlocutory order that was not yet final and appealable. Alvarado, however, prematurely\nfiled a notice of appeal, and the appeal was assigned to this Court and given appellate cause number\n01–10–00740–CV. Alvarado filed a motion to sever his claims against Lexington, which the trial\ncourt granted, and the trial court then rendered judgment in favor of Lexington on November 19,\n2010. After the trial court rendered this final judgment, Alvarado filed a second notice of appeal,\nwhich resulted in appellate cause number 01–10–01150–CV.

Lexington responds that this Court should overrule Alvarado's sole issue\nand affirm the summary judgment because Alvarado failed to plead his third-party-beneficiary\nstatus. It further argues that we should affirm the summary judgment because Alvarado failed to\nraise a genuine issue of material fact with respect to his third-party-beneficiary status.\n\n\n1. Alvarado's Right to Argue His Third–Party–Beneficiary Status\n [2] Before we address the merits of Alvarado's sole issue, we address Lexington's contention that\nAlvarado was required to plead third-party beneficiary status, and that, because he did not, we\nshould affirm the trial court's summary judgment on that basis alone.\n\n [3] Lexington's contention is without merit. Lexington itself raised the issue of Alvarado's third-\nparty-beneficiary status by arguing in its summary judgment motion that Alvarado did not qualify\nas a third-party beneficiary to the Policy and therefore lacked standing. Standing is a jurisdictional\nissue that cannot be waived and may be raised at any time. See Tex. Ass'n of Bus. v. Tex. Air\nControl Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1515115\"><a href=\"/opinion/1515115/tex-assn-of-business-v-air-control-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">852</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 445 (Tex.1993). Here, it was raised by Lexington as grounds for\ngranting it summary judgment against Alvarado.\n\nRule 166a provides that a defendant against whom a claim is asserted “may, at any time, move with\nor without supporting affidavits for summary judgment in his favor as to all or any part thereof.”\nTEX.R. CIV. P. 166a(b). The Rule further provides that summary judgment shall be granted if\nthe motion and the summary judgment evidence “show that, except as to the amount of damages,\nthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a\nmatter of law on the issues expressly set out in the motion or in an answer or other response.” Id.\n166a(c). Lexington moved for summary judgment on all of Alvarado's claims on the ground that\nhe lacked standing to pursue them because he was neither a party to the insurance contract between\nLexington and Flagstar nor *551 a third-party beneficiary of the contract. Alvarado responded\nto this issue in his summary judgment response. The issue of Alvarado's third-party-beneficiary\nstatus was thus squarely before the trial court in Lexington's motion and Alvarado's response.\nLexington's contention that Alvarado may not seek to overturn a summary judgment on the very\nissue it presented to the trial court in its own motion as the basis for granting summary judgment\nis directly contrary to the express language of Rule 166a and is without merit.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Safeco Insurance Co. of America, the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of Louisiana held that the excess loss clause, which “clearly stipulate[d] that the\nportion of any loss payment exceeding the value of [the mortgagee's] interest in the property\nwill be paid directly to [the homeowner-borrower],” manifested a “clear intent to benefit the\nborrower.” Civil Action No. 08–1100, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2622997</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4 (E.D.La.

Alvarado's Status Under Flagstar's Force–Placed Policy\nOn appeal, Alvarado argues that he has third-party-beneficiary status under the Policy. He\ncontends that Endorsement # 12 to the Policy, which provides “Special Broad Form Homeowners\nCoverage,” is analogous to an excess loss clause or a clause allowing for adjustment and payment\nof losses to the borrower. He argues that it demonstrates that Lexington and Flagstar clearly\nintended to benefit him because the terms of this endorsement provide the type of coverage that\nhe, as the homeowner, would seek to obtain if he contracted directly with Lexington to procure\nhomeowner's insurance and that these provisions are irrelevant to Flagstar as the mortgagee of the\nproperty. He points out that Flagstar required the Policy when it loaned him the money to purchase\nhis house and took a mortgage on it. Alvarado paid the premiums on this force-placed Policy as\na separate part of his monthly mortgage payments, and Endorsement # 3 to the Policy required a\nhigher premium for the Special Broad Form Homeowners Coverage.\n\nLexington responds that Flagstar is the sole named insured in the Policy, that Alvarado is not\nmentioned in the Policy, and that the plain language of the Policy can reasonably be construed only\nas protecting Flagstar's mortgage interest in the property up to the extent of that interest, not as\nprotecting Alvarado's interest. It argues, therefore, that the Policy cannot be construed as intended\nto benefit Alvarado, as a matter of law; that Alvarado is not a third-party beneficiary to the Policy\nunder prevailing law construing force-placed insurance policies; and that Alvarado has failed to\nraise a material fact issue as to his third-party-beneficiary status.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The “Common Policy Declarations” and the “Supplemental Declaration Page” of the\nPolicy\nAs Lexington states, the “Common Policy Declarations” in the “Commercial Lines Policy” at issue\nlist “Flagstar Bank, FSB” as the sole “Named Insured.” These Declarations state that the Policy\n“consists of the following coverage parts for which a premium is indicated,” namely, a “Mortgage\nGuard Property Coverage Part.” The Common Policy Declarations then state:\n\n            THESE DECLARATIONS TOGETHER WITH THE COMMON POLICY\n            CONDITIONS, COVERAGE PART DECLARATIONS, COVERAGE PART\n            COVERAGE FORM(S) AND FORMS AND ENDORSEMENTS, IF ANY,\n            ISSUED TO FORM A PART THEREOF, COMPLETE THE ABOVE\n            NUMBERED POLICY.\n\nFor the “Form(s) and Endorsements(s) made part of this policy at time of issue,” the Common\nPolicy Declarations page states, “See attached Table of Contents.” The Table of Contents lists as\n“[c]overage forms and endorsements forming a part of this policy” the “Mortgage Guard Property\nPolicy” and a number of additional endorsements, including Endorsement # 12, a “Homeowners\n3 Special Form” providing “Special Broad Form Homeowner's Coverage.” The Common Policy\nDeclarations state that the complete Policy consists not only of the common declarations and policy\nconditions, but also of the coverage part declarations, coverage part forms, and “the forms and\nendorsements, if any, issued to form a part” of the Policy.

Or 20% of the insured value, whichever is the lesser *\nThus, the Policy provides that Lexington's liability is limited to $1,000,000 “per property.”\nAdditionally, coverage for properties with “Homeowners Coverage as reported as HO on the\nreporting form” is limited to $500,000 for “any one loss,” plus the lesser of $50,000 or 10% of\nthe insured value for any other structure on the property, plus the lesser of $250,000 or 50% of\nthe insured value of any personal property, plus the lesser of $100,000 or 20% of the insured\nvalue for loss of use. An asterisk by each of these categories of covered loss limits Lexington's\nliability to properties “in which the Insured has a mortgage and/or owner interest and which is\nspecifically described in the Reporting Mechanism agreed upon by the Company.” Lexington has\nproduced no summary judgment evidence that Alvarado's property was not among the properties\nwith “Homeowners Coverage” reported by Flagstar on Lexington's reporting form and specifically\ndescribed by Flagstar in Lexington's Reporting Mechanism at the time of the occurrence made\nthe basis of his claim. However, it did produce the “Homeowners Coverage” part of the Policy,\nEndorsement # 12, as part of the Policy applicable to Alvarado, and Alvarado has averred that he\npaid premiums for this coverage. Therefore, we assume, for purposes of the summary judgment\nmotion, that Alvarado did have Homeowners Coverage and therefore was included on Lexington's\nreporting forms. See Sw. Elec. Power Co., 73 S.W.3d at 215.\n\n\nb. The “Mortgage Guard Property Policy”\nThe “Mortgage Guard Property Policy” provides that “[t]hroughout this policy the words ‘you’\nand ‘your’ refer to the Named Insured shown in the Declarations,” namely Flagstar, and that “[t]he\nwords ‘we’, ‘us' and ‘our’ refer to the Company providing this insurance,” i.e., Lexington. The\nMortgage Guard Property Policy sets out the agreement of Lexington and Flagstar with respect\nto this part of the Policy:\n\n            In consideration of the premium to be charged we will (as shown on the\n            Declaration Page) insure (but only in the event there is no other insurance\n            applicable) the Lending Institution (you, as shown on the Declaration Page [here,\n            Flagstar] ) against direct physical loss resulting from destruction of or damage\n            to your property, reported by you on the reporting forms furnished by us, for the\n            Covered Causes of Loss described in this policy.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

These include a “Loan” consisting of “an advance of funds or a loan secured by a note and\nfirst or second ‘mortgage interest/loan balance’ evidenced by a contract of sale for real property.”\nCorrespondingly, the Policy defines a “Borrower” as an individual “obligated on a ‘loan’ ... and\n[who] has ... an interest in the property securing such ‘loan.’ ” The Mortgage Guard Property Policy\nstates, “Loss will be adjusted with and made payable to you unless another payee is specifically\nnamed.” The “Mortgage Clause” states, “Loss, if any, under this policy will be payable to the\nmortgagee [Flagstar] (or trustee) as its interests may appear under all present or future mortgages\nupon the Covered Property described on the reporting forms in which mortgagee may have an\ninterest as mortgagee (or trustee) in order of precedence of said mortgages.” Thus, the Mortgage\nGuard Property Policy, by its own terms, insures Flagstar against direct physical loss resulting\nfrom the destruction of or damage to “your property,” i.e., property in which it has a mortgage or\nownership interest and that is reported by Flagstar on Lexington's reporting forms, in the event\nthere is no other insurance applicable.\n\nThe “Policy Conditions” for the Mortgage Guard Property Policy confirm the intent of the\ncontracting parties to cover physical loss to covered property at described locations, stating, “Our\nliability for loss with respect to any property covered will not exceed the Limit of Liability stated\nin the Declarations as applicable, nor exceed, in any event, the lesser of the amount it would cost\nto repair or replace with material of like kind and quality, or the amount of insurance specified on\neach Covered Property at the Described Location on the reporting forms completed by you and\nfurnished to us.”\n\nProvisions in the Mortgage Guard Property Policy specify the means by which Flagstar must\nreport damage for property; they grant it permission, “[i]n the event of loss ... to make reasonable\nrepairs ... provided the repairs are confined solely to the protection of the Covered Property from\nfurther damage and provided you keep an accurate record of the repair expenditures,” to “be\nincluded in determining the amount of loss”; they impose duties of notice, reporting of damage,\nand protection of the covered property in the event of loss; they provide for the examination of\nFlagstar or its representative “about any matter relating to this insurance or a claim”; and, “[i]n\nthe event of a dual interest,” they allow Lexington to require the agreement of “any mortgagor\nclaiming coverage or monetary benefit under this insurance ” to “submit to an examination under\noath ... about any matter relating to this insurance or a claim.” (Emphasis added.) These provisions\nthus recognize that the Mortgage Guard Property Policy covers payment for repairs to damaged\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

However, there is summary judgment evidence, in the form of Alvarado's\naffidavit, that Flagstar reported damage to Alvarado's property to Lexington. *559 It is also not\npossible to determine from the summary judgment record precisely what claims either Flagstar or\nAlvarado submitted to Lexington with respect to damage to the property or what amount of money\nfor what losses was paid by Lexington to Flagstar. Nor is it possible to ascertain the extent of\nFlagstar's mortgage interest in Alvarado's property and the extent of Alvarado's interest. However,\nAlvarado avers that his property sustained damage as a result of Hurricane Ike in 2008, that Flagstar\nmade a claim on the Policy, and that Lexington paid Flagstar $4,410.49 in damages. He further\navers that Flagstar did not provide any of these funds to him for the purpose of repairs and that it\ndid not apply these funds to the balance of his mortgage. We consider each of these uncontested\nfacts as stated by Alvarado, the nonmovant, to be true, as we must under summary judgment law.\nSee Fielding, 289 S.W.3d at 848; City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 827.\n\nWe conclude that the Policy manifests a clear intent to directly benefit both Flagstar and “any\nmortgagor claiming coverage or monetary benefit” for damage to property under the Policy, as\ntheir interests may appear as mortgagee or mortgagor of a covered property at the described\nlocations listed by Flagstar on Lexington's reporting forms. We further conclude that Flagstar is\nthe mortgagee of Alvarado's property and that Alvarado is a mortgagor with an ownership interest\nin a property described on Lexington's forms whose property was damaged and for which Flagstar\nsubmitted a claim and was paid. However, it is not possible to determine from the Mortgage Guard\nProperty Policy whether Alvarado was a mortgagor who had a right to claim coverage under the\nPolicy for damage to his property. Therefore, we turn to Endorsement # 12 of the Policy.\n\n\nc. Endorsement # 12: Special Broad Form Homeowners Coverage\n [20] Endorsement # 12, titled “Special Broad Form Homeowners Coverage,” is relied upon\nby Alvarado to show his third-party-beneficiary status under the Policy. It provides the type of\ncoverage that an individual homeowner would generally seek from an insurance company, instead\nof the coverage that a mortgagee seeking solely to protect its monetary interest in the property\nwould typically seek. Endorsement # 12 states, “It is understood and agreed [by Flagstar and\nLexington] that the following coverages are added to this policy and that these coverages apply\nonly to owner occupied properties reported as ‘HO’ property type by the Insured [Flagstar]:\nSpecial Broad Form Homeowners Coverage, Homeowners 3, Special Form, ED. 10–00 (HO–\n3, Ed. 10–00).” This statement is immediately followed by declarations specific to Endorsement\n# 12 that incorporate the property coverage limits from the Common Policy Declarations and\nSupplemental Declaration Page and add additional “Property Coverage,” “Liability Coverages,”\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Alvarado claims that it did, and Lexington included Endorsement # 12 as part of the\nPolicy on Alvarado's property. Therefore, we take it as true for purposes of this summary judgment\nmotion that Alvarado's property was listed by Lexington as a property carrying Homeowner's\nInsurance. 6 See Sw. Elec.

In addition, Section II, “Liability Coverages,” provides coverage to the owners of the\nspecified properties for “Personal Liability” of “$100,000 per person/$300,000 per occurrence”\nand coverage for “Medical Pay to others” of “$1,000 per person/ $25,000 per accident.” This\nHomeowners Coverage part of the Policy further provides that “[t]he combined limit of liability\nunder the policy for Special Broad Form Homeowners Coverage shall not exceed $1,000,000 for\nthe policy period.”\n\nEndorsement # 12 also states that “[t]he earned premium for each daily period shall be calculated\nby multiplying the total amount of insurance specified on the reporting form furnished by the\nCompany by the rate stated on the Rates and Deductibles Page.” The Rates and Deductibles\npage—Endorsement # 3 to the Policy—specifies that, for “Special Broad Form Homeowners\nCoverage,” “each claim for loss or damage (separately occurring) shall be adjusted separately,”\nand it defines the deductible for different types of covered properties, including Occupied\nResidences. Endorsement # 3 charges a higher premium for Special Broad Form Homeowners\nCoverage. Finally, Endorsement # 12 specifies that the homeowner's coverage ceases to apply\nwhen a property becomes vacant or goes into foreclosure, and it further specifies that “[o]n the\ndate the property status changes the regular residential coverage as indicated in the Residential\nProperty Coverages policy section will apply to that property,” i.e., the coverage indicated on the\nSupplemental Declaration Page of the Common Policy applies, and not the coverage indicated in\nEndorsement # 12.\n\nThe “Definitions” part of Endorsement # 12 defines the term “Insured” for the purpose of\nproperties covered under the “Homeowners Coverage” addition to the Policy in terms that can\nreasonably refer only to the homeowner, not to Flagstar. Section A of the “Definitions” states,\n“In this policy, ‘you’ and ‘your’ refer to the ‘named insured’ shown in the Declarations and the\nspouse if a resident of the same household. ‘We’, ‘us' and ‘our’ refer to the Company providing\nthis insurance.” Section B of the “Definitions” states, “In addition, certain words and phrases are\ndefined as follows.” Definition 5 defines “Insured” to mean, in pertinent part, “[y]ou and residents\nof your household who are ... [y]our relatives; or ... [o]ther persons under the age of 21 and in\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.               17\n\fAlvarado v.

[p]roperty damage,” i.e., “physical injury to, destruction of, or loss of use of tangible\nproperty.” The “Deductible” part of the endorsement states, “Unless otherwise noted in this policy,\nthe following deductible provision applies: Subject to the policy limits that apply, we will pay only\nthat part of the total of all loss payable under Section 1 [“Property Coverages”] that exceeds the\ndeductible amount shown in the Declarations.”\n\nSubsection A of “Section 1—Property Coverages” of Endorsement # 12 expressly states, “We\ncover ... [t]he dwelling on the ‘residence premises' shown in the Declarations, including structures\nattached to the dwelling; and ... [m]aterials and supplies located on or next to the ‘residence\npremises' used to construct, alter or repair the dwelling or other structures on the ‘residence\npremises.’ ” Subsections B, C, and D of Section 1 provide insurance coverage for, among other\nthings, personal property, loss of use, which includes additional living expenses and fair rental\nvalue, debris removal, reasonable repairs, and credit card fraud.\n\nFinally, “Section 1—Conditions” of Endorsement # 12 provides that, “[e]ven if more than one\nperson has an insurable interest in the property covered, [Lexington] will not be liable in any one\nloss [t]o an ‘insured’ for more than the amount of such ‘insured's' interest at the time of loss.”\nThe “Loss Payment” provision states: “We will adjust all losses with you. We will pay you unless\nsome other person is named in the policy or is legally entitled to receive payment.” Endorsement\n# 12 also includes a “Mortgage Clause” that provides, “If a mortgagee is named in this policy,\nany loss payable ... will be paid to the mortgagee and you, as interests appear.” (Emphasis\nadded.) “Section II—Liability Coverages” provides personal liability coverage for bodily injury\nor property damage, as well as coverage for medical payments to others.\n\nAll of these provisions of this endorsement are meaningful only if the “Insured” and “you”\nreferenced in the Definitions and Property Coverages of Endorsement # 12 mean the homeowner\nof an owner-occupied property reported by Flagstar to Lexington on Lexington's reporting forms\nas having force-placed Homeowners Coverage and if the Homeowners Coverage part of the Policy\nis interpreted as directly insuring the homeowner against loss to property, both real and personal,\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

See MCI Telecomms., 995 S.W.2d at 651 (stating that if performance will come to third\nparty in satisfaction of legal duty owed to him by promisee, including “contractual obligation or\nother legally enforceable commitment,” he is creditor beneficiary of contract).\n\nLexington argues, however, that the type of policy at issue in this case does not confer third-\nparty-beneficiary status on homeowners. It refers us to a recent opinion from the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of Texas in a diversity case brought under Texas law,\nwhich addressed the effect of a “Special Broad Form Homeowners Coverage” endorsement on the\nhomeowner-borrower's status as a third-party beneficiary in a case similar to the present one. See\nTrevino v. Evanston Ins. Co., Civil Action No. M–11–18, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2709063</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3 (S.D.Tex.

In that case, the homeowner made the same argument Alvarado makes here: because\nthe endorsement provides coverage that is irrelevant to the mortgagee and that “could only inure\nto the benefit of [the homeowner],” the endorsement demonstrates the contracting parties' intent\nto confer a direct benefit on the homeowner. Id.\n\nThe federal district court noted that the insurance company, Evanston, “counters that these\ncoverages [for personal liability, medical pay to others, personal property loss, and loss of use\ncoverage] only become available when a mortgagee complies with the reporting provisions of\nthe Mortgage Guard Policy, which require the mortgagee to notify Evanston of ‘any change\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The court concluded, without analysis of the language in the endorsement or the\nfactual circumstances of the case, other than the plaintiff had “made a claim under the policy\nseeking coverage for roof and water damage sustained by the property as a result of Hurricane\nDolly on July 23, 2008,” that “the Policy language unambiguously manifests the intent to provide\nhazard coverage to [the mortgagee] to the extent of its interest in the property, and any benefit\nconferred to [the homeowner] as a result is incidental,” and that the homeowner “has pointed to\nno provision that makes clearly apparent the contracting parties' intent to confer a direct benefit\non Plaintiff.” Id. The court ultimately held that the homeowner-borrower was not a third-party\nbeneficiary under the insurance policy at issue and had no standing to pursue his claims. Id. at\n*1, *3.\n\nIn the instant case, by contrast, the Policy language does unambiguously manifest the contracting\nparties' intent to provide *563 coverage directly to the owners of the properties described by\nFlagstar on Lexington's reporting forms for property damage, including coverage for personal\nproperty damage and personal liability, when Special Broad Form Homeowners Coverage is added\nto the Policy by an endorsement, as spelled out in the Policy. See Basic Capital Mgmt., 348 S.W.3d\nat 900; MCI Telecomms., 995 S.W.2d at 651. Alvarado, unlike Trevino, did point to a provision\nin the Policy, Endorsement # 12, that makes apparent the contracting parties' intent to confer a\ndirect benefit on owners of property reported by Flagstar on Lexington's reporting forms that meet\ncertain conditions specified in the Policy, including owning a Homeowner's Policy. Thus, we find\nTrevino to be distinguishable and its legal conclusions to be inapplicable to this case.\n\nThe dissent, however, finds Trevino persuasive. It reasons that this case is more closely analogous\nto the Texas Supreme Court's decision in MCI Telecommunications, in which the court found no\nthird-party-beneficiary status, than to its decision in Basic Capital Management. We disagree.\nIn MCI Telecommunications, Texas Utilities contracted with the Missouri Pacific Railroad\n(“MoPac”) to obtain a license to install an electric transmission line on MoPac's right-of-way. 995\nS.W.2d at 648–49. Twelve years later, MCI contracted with MoPac to use the right-of-way to\ninstall a fiber optic cable. Id. at 649. MCI's contract with MoPac contained a provision requiring\nMCI to exercise its contract rights “in such a manner as not to interfere in any way with any existing\nprior rights,” such as the rights of existing licensees. Id. The contract also included a provision\nexplicitly stating that no provision of the contract “shall be construed as being for the benefit of\nany party not in signatory hereto.” Id. at 649–50. The Texas Supreme Court reversed both the\ntrial court and the Fort Worth Court of Appeals and held that Texas Utilities was not a third-\nparty beneficiary of MCI's contract with MoPac. Id. at 651. The court reasoned that, although the\ncontract included a provision protecting Texas Utilities' rights as an earlier licensee, the contract\ndid not provide a direct benefit to Texas Utilities and no contractual language indicated that MCI\nand MoPac contracted for Texas Utilities' benefit. Id. at 651–52. At best, Texas Utilities was an\n“incidental beneficiary” of the contract. Id. at 652. The court also noted that the contract explicitly\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

And Endorsement # 12 expressly states that it provides additional coverage\nto that provided by the rest of the Policy, spells out the protections that the additional coverage\nprovides, and states where this coverage differs from the coverage in the Common Policy in\nterms that can apply only to the homeowner of a residential property, here Alvarado, reported to\nLexington by a mortagee, here Flagstar, as having Special Broad Form Homeowners Coverage.\nIt also defines *564 such a residential homeowner as the “insured” for purposes of homeowners'\ncoverage. Finally, Endorsement # 12 expressly distinguishes the insured residential mortgagor\nfrom the mortgagee as a person having covered interests under the Policy and recognizes that they\nmay have dual interests.\n\nAs the Texas Supreme Court noted in MCI Telecommunications, when interpreting a contract,\n“we examine the entire agreement in an effort to harmonize and give effect to all provisions\nof the contract so that none will be meaningless.” Id. at 652. We conclude, as in Basic Capital\nManagement, that the additional coverage in Endorsement # 12 for which the homeowner is forced\nto pay additional premiums “ha[s] no purpose whatever” and is meaningless unless the “Special\nBroad Form Homeowners Coverage” was intended by Lexington, the insurer of the property,\nand Flagstar, the mortgagee, to directly benefit the mortgagors and homeowners of the properties\nspecifically described by Flagstar on Lexington's reporting forms. See Basic Capital Mgmt., 348\nS.W.3d at 900.\n\nIt was Lexington's burden, as movant for summary judgment, to prove its entitlement to summary\njudgment against Alvarado as a matter of law. We hold that Lexington failed to carry its burden of\nconclusively negating Alvarado's status as a third-party beneficiary to the Policy. Thus, we hold\nthat the trial court erred in rendering summary judgment in favor of Lexington.\n\nWe sustain Alvarado's sole issue.\n\n\n\n                                                   Conclusion\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The trial court held that chapter 204 of the Texas Property Code 1 authorized the Board\nto raise assessments unilaterally. The court of appeals affirmed the trial court's judgment in part\nand reversed in part. Both parties petitioned this Court for review. We granted the petitions to\nreview the interplay between Texas Property Code chapter 204 and Northglen Association's deed\nrestrictions. We affirm the court of appeals' judgment in part, vacate in part, and reverse and render\njudgment in part.\n\n\n\n                                                       I\n\n\n                                                   Background\n\nNorthglen Association (“Northglen”) is the homeowners association for six Harris County\nsubdivisions or “sections” encompassing more than 1600 single-family residences. Each section is\ngoverned by a separate set of deed restrictions through which every property owner is a member of\nthe Association. The restrictions subject each homeowner to an annual assessment that is deposited\ninto a maintenance fund for such services as maintaining common areas, contracting for garbage\ndisposal, and constructing parks.\n\n *161 In 1994, Northglen's Board of Directors amended the deed restrictions to expand the Board\nand to assess late fees on unpaid assessments. Geneva Brooks and other Northglen property\nowners (“Brooks”) organized a committee, called the Committee to Remove the Board, to remove\ncertain Board members who, they complained, acted outside the bounds of the deed restrictions\nby adopting the amendments. Northglen responded by suing for injunctive and declaratory relief.\nNorthglen sought an order enjoining the eight homeowners from conveying the false impression\nthat Brooks's committee was formed pursuant to Northglen's bylaws and from other conduct\ndesigned to disrupt the Board's activities. Northglen also sought a judgment declaring that its\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                  2\n\fBrooks v.

Brooks\ncounterclaimed for a declaratory judgment that Northglen had no authority to raise assessments or\ncharge late fees without a vote of the property owners. Northglen eventually nonsuited its claims,\nand the case proceeded on Brooks's declaratory judgment action.\n\nThe trial court granted summary judgment for Northglen, declaring that, without a vote of the\nhomeowners, Northglen had the authority to: (1) raise the assessment for Sections One, Two,\nand Three; (2) raise the assessment for Sections Four, Five, and Six by ten percent each year or\naccumulate and assess the increase after a number of years; and (3) charge delinquent homeowners\na $35 late fee.

It reversed as to Sections One, Two, and Three, holding that the deed restrictions did not\npermit annual assessments exceeding $120. As to Sections Four, Five, and Six, the court of appeals\nheld that because the deed restrictions contained no language expressly forbidding accumulation,\nNorthglen could accumulate previous assessments under Property Code section 204.010(16). Id. at\n167. The court also held that section 204.010(10) gave Northglen the right to assess a $35 late fee\nin addition to the interest charge permitted by the deed restrictions. Id. at 174. Because the property\nowners did not have prior notice of the late fee, the court of appeals held that Northglen could not\nforeclose on any homesteads to collect those fees. Id. at 175. The court of appeals affirmed the\ntrial court's denial of attorney's fees. Id. at 176.\n\nWe hold that Northglen cannot accumulate unassessed fee increases because the language in\nthe deed restrictions prevails over chapter 204, and we reverse that portion of the court of\nappeals' judgment. We affirm the portion of the court of appeals' judgment restricting increases in\nassessments to $120 and holding that Northglen has the authority to assess late charges for unpaid\nfees, in addition to the interest charges described in the deed restrictions.

Northglen contends that the\ndoctrine of fundamental error excuses it from “the usual requirements of preservation of the error\nor briefing of the ... argument” because the absence of jurisdiction may be raised for the first time\non appeal. We disagree that the absence of parties within the represented sections deprived the\ncourt of jurisdiction and therefore reject Northglen's contention as to Sections One, Two, Four and\nFive; however, because no property owners in Sections Three or Six were joined in the suit, we\nagree with Northglen that any judgment affecting those sections would be advisory.\n\n\n\n                                                      A\n\n [2] No one disputes that the trial court had jurisdiction to declare the “rights, status, and other\nlegal relations” for the named homeowners, who are “interested under a deed, ... written contract,\nor other writings constituting a contract or whose rights, status, or other legal relations are affected\nby a statute....” Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code §§ 37.003(a) and 37.004(a).

Civ. P. 39.\n\nSection 37.006(a) of the Declaratory Judgment Act, which provides that a trial court's declaration\ndoes not prejudice the rights of any person not a party to the proceeding, dispenses with the first\nof these concerns. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code § 37.006(a). Any non-joined homeowner\nwould be entitled to pursue individual claims contesting Northglen's authority to raise assessments\nor impose fees, notwithstanding the trial court's judgment in the current case. 2 See Cooper,\n513 S.W.2d at 204 (“[I]t would be rare indeed if there were a person whose presence was so\nindispensable in the sense that his absence deprives a court of jurisdiction ...”).\n\nWe appreciate the risk that, unless each homeowner is joined in one suit, Northglen may be\nsubject to inconsistent judgments. Tex.R. Civ. P. 39(a)(2)(ii). Northglen's dilemma, however, is\nthe product of its own inaction.

Second, when the maintenance fund is created, the Board of Directors\nhas discretion to determine the rate at which each lot will be assessed above the $120. Third, the\nassessment rate and date payable may be adjusted from year to year, as the needs of the subdivision\nrequire.\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The Samms court held that a deed\nrestriction with language similar to Section One and Two granted the homeowners association the\nauthority, from year to year, to determine the rate at which property owners would be assessed.\nId. at 402. The court held that the homeowners association had authority to raise the assessment\nwithout limitation because a phrase in the deed restriction said “the rate at which each Lot will\nbe assessed ... will be determined annually by the Board of Directors....” Id. But the court did not\ndiscuss another provision of that deed restriction which stated explicitly that the assessment was\n“not to exceed” a particular amount.\n\nThe Northglen deed restrictions subject each property owner to “an annual maintenance charge\nand assessment not to exceed $10 per month or $120 per annum, for the purpose of creating ...\nthe ‘maintenance fund’....” (Emphasis added.) The restrictions further provide that “[t]he rate at\nwhich each Lot will be assessed will be determined annually” by Northglen, and that “[s]aid rate\nand when same is payable may be adjusted from year to year by [Northglen] as the needs of the\nSubdivision may in the judgment of [Northglen] require.”\n\nNorthglen's argument does not survive the restrictions' plain language. First, the annual assessment\nis not to exceed $10 per month or $120 per year. The restrictions do not require that Northglen\ncharge the maximum amount. Rather, Northglen may charge any amount so long as the amount\ndoes not exceed $120 per year. So, if Northglen had been assessing $50 per year and decided the\nnext year that $120 was necessary, it has the authority to raise the rates unilaterally. Second, the\ndeed restrictions neither contemplate nor permit an additional assessment once the maintenance\nfund is whole because the language says plainly that the assessment is not to exceed $10 per month\nor $120 per year. There is no language permitting an additional assessment beyond that which is\nincluded in the maintenance fund, aside from the special assessment for capital improvements.\n\n *166 We hold that the court of appeals correctly concluded that Northglen cannot increase\nassessments beyond the $120 limitation set forth in the deed restrictions, and we affirm that part\nof the court of appeals' judgment.\n\n\n\n                                                     IV\n\n\n                                          Sections Four and Five\n\n [8] Northglen argues — and the court of appeals held — that the deed restrictions permit\naccumulation of unassessed increases in maintenance fees for Sections Four and Five. 76 S.W.3d at\n167.

One of\nthe stated purposes in chapter 204 is to provide a mechanism “to readily facilitate increases in the\namount of the regular or special assessments to allow the property owners' associations to better\nprovide services to the subdivisions.” Tex. Prop.Code § 204.001 historical note, [Act of May 27,\n1995, 74th Leg., R.S., ch. 1040, § 1, 1995 Tex. Gen. Laws 5170, 5171]. The Legislature observed\nthat severe restrictions on the ability to adjust regular assessments “may result in the inability of an\nineffective property owners' association to maintain common area facilities, including swimming\npools, tennis courts, clubhouses, greenbelt areas, or jogging trails, or to provide services, including\nstreetlights, security, architectural control, and deed restriction enforcement.” Id. Read in isolation,\nthe legislature's preamble to section 204 offers some support for Northglen's argument that it has\nthe authority to accumulate previously unassessed fee increases beyond the maximum stated in\nthe restrictions to maintain common facilities or to provide services. The Legislature, however,\ninserted a caveat that governs here: the statutory provision permitting accumulation does not apply\nif the deed restrictions “otherwise provide.” Tex. Prop.Code § 204.010.\n\nIn this case, the Northglen deed restrictions for Sections Four and Five “otherwise provide” that\naccumulation is not permitted. Section Four limits the ten *168 percent increase to “the amount\nassessed in the preceding calendar year.” (Emphasis added.) Section Five also limits the “increase\nover the prior years [sic] annual assessment.” (Emphasis added.) The natural consequence of\neach restriction's language is that if the annual assessment for this year is $120, then next year's\nassessment may not be raised to the $550 that Northglen seeks. Rather, next year's assessment may\nbe no more than $132. By specifically tying any increase to the previous year's annual assessment,\nthe deed restrictions do not permit accumulation over multiple years.\n\nAdditionally, in Section Four, Northglen may increase fees beyond the limits by receiving a “vote\nof two-thirds (2/3) of each class of Members of the Association who are voting in person or by\nproxy, at a meeting duly called for that purpose.” In Section Five the Board must receive “approval\nof two-thirds (2/3rds) of each class of Members in the Association present and voting at a meeting\nduly called for this purpose.” Although a two-thirds vote may be difficult to achieve, the deed\nrestrictions offer Northglen a procedure for increasing fee assessments beyond the ten-percent\nlimit other than accumulation. The voting mechanism, combined with the increase being tied to\nthe previous year's assessment, establishes that the deed restrictions “otherwise provide.”\n\nBecause we conclude that the statute does not permit accumulation or fee increases above the deed\nrestrictions, we need not address Brooks's contention that the statute's accumulation provisions\nare unconstitutional.\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The trial court held that Northglen could charge a late fee under section\n204.010(a)(10), and the court of appeals affirmed. Both courts noted that the deed restrictions did\nnot expressly prohibit late fees nor limit penalties to the interest charge. We hold that Northglen\nmay charge a $35 late fee and that such a charge is constitutional.\n\n\n\n                                                      A\n\n [9] The homeowners argue that permitting Northglen to unilaterally assess late charges would\ndefeat the purpose of the deed restrictions, which already impose a six percent interest charge for\nnonpayment. Additionally, the homeowners argue that by expressly including the interest charge in\nthe restrictions, the homeowners necessarily rejected late charges, under the doctrine of expressio\nunius est exclusio alterius (to include one thing implies the exclusion of the other). Black's Law\nDictionary 602 (7th ed.1999).\n\nThe court of appeals disagreed with the homeowners' argument and held that Northglen could\nassess late charges. The court considered the language of section 204.010(a)(10), which provides,\nin pertinent part:\n\n   (a) Unless otherwise provided by the restrictions or the association's articles of incorporation or\n   bylaws, the property owners' association, acting through its board of directors or trustees, may:\n\n   ...\n\n   (10) impose interest, late charges, and, if applicable, returned check charges for *169 late\n   payments of regular assessments or special assessments.\n\nTex. Prop.Code § 204.010(a)(10). The court held that this statutory language granted Northglen\nauthority to assess the late charge in the absence of specific language to the contrary. Because\nthe deed restrictions do not mention late charges specifically, the court held that silence could not\nmean “otherwise provide.” 76 S.W.3d at 174.\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In Inwood, we\nconsidered whether the homestead laws of Texas protect a homeowner against foreclosure for\nfailure to pay homeowners association assessments. Id. at 633. As a general rule, a homestead\nis protected against the debts of those who live in the homestead. Id. at 634. However, the deed\nrestrictions for the subdivision included a vendor's lien permitting foreclosure on the homestead\nfor failure to pay the fee assessment. Id. at 633. Because the property owner had notice when\npurchasing the property that a lien attached to the land, we held that foreclosure was permissible.\nId. at 635–36.\n\nThe court of appeals, in our case, focused on the notice requirement and held that foreclosure was\nnot a potential remedy against unpaid late charges. 76 S.W.3d at 175. The court noted that the lien\nto enforce the late charges attached to the property after the homestead was acquired because late\ncharges were not included in the deed restriction. Id.\n\nThe court cited as authority an Attorney General opinion that said costs imposed upon property\nowners because of Chapter 204, which were not part of the deed restriction, could not be enforced\nthrough foreclosure. Id. (citing Tex. Att'y Gen. Op. LO–97–019 (1997)). The Attorney General\nconcluded that, in determining whether foreclosure is a remedy, the issue is “whether the lien\nfor those costs (i) attached to the property prior to the homestead right and (ii) is the result of\na restriction that runs with the land.” Tex. Att'y Gen. Op. LO–97–019. The court of appeals\nconsidered the two elements and held that because late charges were not part of the deed restrictions\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Northglen also contends that because property *171 owners were aware that\ndelinquent assessments would be subject to late charges, in the form of an interest charge, the\nproperty owners had actual notice sufficient to satisfy Inwood. Thus, because the property owners\nhad actual notice, Northglen asserts, the late charge should also run with the land as the interest\ncharge does.\n\nWe disagree with Northglen and agree with the court of appeals. Northglen's argument essentially\namends the deed restrictions to include both late fees and interest charges. But the restrictions did\nnot provide any notice that a late fee would be imposed in addition to the interest charge. As a\nresult, the property owners did not have notice of the late charge. Therefore, in light of Inwood 's\nnotice requirement, foreclosure is not an appropriate remedy for a failure to pay the late charge. 6\n\n\n\n                                                    VII\n\n\n                                       Non-profit Corporation Act\n\n [15] Northglen challenges that portion of the trial court's judgment providing that “the bylaws\nmay only be amended by the members....” Northglen argues that, even absent Property Code\nchapter 204, it had the authority to increase assessments because it may amend the bylaws\nunilaterally under the Texas Non–Profit Corporation Act. Tex.Rev.Civ. Stat. art. 1396–1.01 et seq.\nThat statute provides, among other things, that a board of directors has the authority to amend\nbylaws unless the articles of incorporation reserve the power exclusively to the members. We\ncannot reach this issue. Northglen did not file a notice of appeal from the trial court's judgment,\ndid not notice a cross-appeal, and did not petition this court for review on the point. Accordingly,\nNorthglen did not preserve this issue for our review.

The Declaratory Judgment act permits a court\nto “award costs and reasonable and necessary attorney's fees as are equitable and just.” Tex. Civ.\nPrac. & Rem.Code §§ 37.009.

Plaintiffs Ladners owned certain residences\non land purchased from defendant Siegel. On the remaining land adjoining plaintiffs' residences,\nSiegel proposed to erect a shopping center. One of the buildings was to be occupied by a garage\noperated for the general repair and service of automobiles for the public. The Ladners brought\nsuit against Siegel seeking to restrain him from erecting and occupying the garage as a violation\nof the residential district use. The Ladners won this suit and secured their injunction. That cause\nbecame final.\n\nThereafter Siegel filed a declaratory judgment action asking the court to fix his rights in the conduct\nof the garage in case it was carried on in such a way as not to constitute a private nuisance. The\ncourt was presented with the question of determining a method by which Siegel would operate the\ngarage, and then asked to determine whether or not such method of operation would be permitted\nin this residential district. The trial court entered a judgment setting out a method whereby the\ngarage could be operated so as not to constitute a private nuisance.\n\nOn appeal the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania says the crucial question is ‘do the circumstances\nhere disclosed give any jurisdiction to the court below to enter a declaratory judgment?’ *590 The\nCourt then quotes from the Declaratory Judgments Act which provides that courts of record ‘within\ntheir respective jurisdictions, shall have power to declare rights, status, and other legal relations'\nbetween parties where there is a real matter in controversy. These are the identical provisions in\nour statute-art. 2524-1, Vernon's Ann.Civ.St. The Court then says the Declaratory Judgments Act\ngives the court no power to grant advisory opinions, or to determine matters not essential to the\ndecision of the actual controversy although such questions may in the future require adjudication,\nor passing upon contingent or certain other situations. The court then says:\n         ‘* * * In the present case, the question of whether the use of the garage as now\n         contemplated would constitute an offensive business in the neighborhood, and\n         a private nuisance, affecting not only complainants, but others residing near by,\n         could not be determined until its actual operation at some future date.’\n\n\nAnd the Court further says:\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Yet, as we noted in\nGomez, constitutional challenges to rules enacted by this Court must be brought in the district\ncourt and heard by this Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction. “Had this Court\nactually promulgated rules establishing a pro bono program and had Gomez challenged the\nconstitutionality of such rules, the district court would have jurisdiction to decide, in the first\ninstance, whether such rules met constitutional standards.... Such a case would be justiciable\nbecause the district court would be capable of rendering a judgment that accords the parties\ncomplete relief, subject of course to appellate review.” Id. at 246. Analogously, Relators must\nfollow the same procedure in challenging the constitutionality of the Attorney Occupation Tax. A\nlitigant may not bring such a claim in the first instance in this Court.\n\nAccordingly, without hearing oral argument, see Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 122, a\nmajority of this Court overrules Relators' motion for leave to file an original petition for writ of\nmandamus and writs pursuant to Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure 121 and 122.\n\n\nParallel Citations\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.

Rodriguez sued Woodling for negligence and, in the same case,\nRodriguez's automobile insurer, appellant Allstate County Mutual Insurance Company, seeking\ncoverage under an uninsured/underinsured motorist (UIM) policy. Rodriguez later amended his\npetition to add Woodling's insurer, appellant Farmers Insurance Exchange, seeking liability\ncoverage for Woodling under his homeowner's policy. In a pre-trial partial summary judgment,\nthe court declared the claims were covered by both insurance policies. At trial, the jury found\nno negligence on the part of Rodriguez, found that Woodling was negligent, and found that\nWoodling's negligence caused Rodriguez's damages. The primary issues on appeal pertain to\nthe trial court's subject matter jurisdiction over the claims against Farmers and interpretation of\nstandard form language in the Allstate automobile policy.\n\nFarmers appeals the trial court's grant of summary judgment against Farmers in favor of Rodriguez,\ndenial of Farmers' plea to the jurisdiction, and entry of declaratory judgment finding coverage\nunder the Farmers insurance policy. In three issues, Farmers contends the trial court lacked subject\nmatter jurisdiction over Rodriguez's claim against Farmers, the homeowner's policy issued by\nFarmers does not provide liability coverage for Woodling, and Rodriguez filed an impermissible\ndirect action against Farmers without satisfying conditions precedent in Woodling's insurance\npolicy. We hold the trial court erred by granting summary and declaratory judgments against\nFarmers and denying Farmers' plea to the jurisdiction because Rodriguez's claim against Farmers\nwas not ripe when the court made its rulings. We therefore reverse and render judgment dismissing\nRodriguez's claims against Farmers for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nAllstate appeals the trial court's summary judgment in favor of Rodriguez against Allstate and\ndeclaratory judgment finding coverage under the UIM policy. In four issues, Allstate contends its\npolicy does not cover Rodriguez's injury but the Farmers policy does. We hold the UIM provisions\nin Rodriguez's automobile policy provide coverage for his injury. We therefore affirm the trial\ncourt's summary judgment and declaratory judgment against Allstate.\n\n\n\n                                    Undisputed Factual Background\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Using a trailer hitched to his pickup truck, *220 Woodling 1\ntransported a deer stand from his deer lease to his residence. He pulled into his driveway and\nattempted to remove the deer stand from the trailer. He pushed the deer stand out of the trailer until\nthe legs on the stand touched the driveway. He left the stand resting at a 30–degree angle against\nthe trailer. He then attached a come-along 2 to a fence post and to the stand and attempted to raise\nthe stand upright. Realizing he could not accomplish the task alone, he requested assistance from\nhis neighbor, Rodriguez.\n\nRodriguez and Woodling decided to lift the stand manually by walking forward out of the trailer\nand onto the driveway. They began in the trailer, each using both hands to push the stand upward.\nThen they stepped onto the driveway and took “one or two” more steps. When the stand was no\nlonger touching the trailer, Woodling realized it was too heavy and yelled, “Juan, I can't hold it.\nJump.” Woodling then jumped away, leaving Rodriguez alone to hold the stand, which weighed\napproximately 350 pounds. The stand fell, and Rodriguez was injured.\n\nThe liability provisions of the Farmers homeowners policy contain the following exclusion for\nbodily injury claims: “arising out of the ownership, maintenance, operation, use, loading or\nunloading of ... trailers [or] semi-trailers” except for “trailers or semitrailers while not being towed\nby or carried on a motor vehicle.”\n\nRodriguez's Allstate automobile policy included UIM coverage for damages Rodriguez was\n“legally entitled to recover from the owner ... of an uninsured [or underinsured] motor vehicle\n[including any type of trailer] because of bodily injury sustained by [Rodriguez and] caused by an\naccident.” Under the Allstate policy, the uninsured or underinsured owner's liability must “arise\nout of the ownership, maintenance or use of the uninsured motor vehicle.” (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n\n                                             Procedural History\n\nRodriguez filed suit against Woodling and Allstate on June 2, 2008, asserting a negligence claim\nagainst Woodling and a claim against Allstate for UIM coverage. Rodriguez amended his petition\non September 16, 2008, adding Farmers as a defendant and seeking declarations that the exclusion\nfrom liability coverage in the Farmers policy did not apply or, alternatively, that Rodriguez's\ndamages arose from the use of a trailer covered by the Allstate policy.\n\nFarmers filed a motion to sever, contending Rodriguez's joinder of Farmers was improper. 3\nRodriguez moved for partial summary judgment against Farmers, seeking a declaration that\nFarmers had a contractual obligation to indemnify Woodling. Farmers moved for summary\njudgment based on improper joinder, lack of ripeness, and applicability of its “trailers or semi-\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Allstate moved for summary judgment, asserting that the accident did not arise\nout of the use of an uninsured motor vehicle so that the Allstate policy did not apply. The trial\ncourt granted Rodriguez's motion and denied motions filed by Allstate and Farmers. In a combined\nplea to the jurisdiction and motion to vacate the court's order granting partial summary judgment,\nFarmers reasserted its jurisdictional arguments *221 before trial of the underlying personal injury\nclaim. The court denied the combined motion.\n\nBefore trial, Allstate, while contesting coverage under its policy, stipulated to be bound by the\njury's findings on negligence and damages. The jury found Woodling 100% negligent and awarded\ndamages to Rodriguez totaling $233,123.71. Rodriguez subsequently filed a motion for summary\njudgment against Allstate, seeking a declaration that his injuries were covered under the Allstate\npolicy, which the trial court granted. After reducing the jury award based on the amount of\nRodriguez's incurred medical expenses, the trial court entered judgment awarding Rodriguez\n$211,618.42, plus interest and costs, and declaring that Rodriguez's injuries were covered under\nboth the Farmers and Allstate policies.\n\n\n\n                                            Standards of Review\n\nTraditional Summary Judgment.\nTo prevail on a traditional Rule 166a(c) summary-judgment motion, a movant must prove that\nthere is no genuine issue regarding any material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter\nof law.

A party injured by the insured is a third-party beneficiary of a liability insurance\npolicy, but he cannot enforce the policy directly against the insurer until it has been established,\nby final judgment or agreement, that the insured has a legal obligation to pay damages to the\ninjured party. Ollis, 768 S.W.2d at 723. It is undisputed that when the trial court granted Rodriguez\nsummary judgment against Farmers, Woodling's obligation to pay damages to Rodriguez had not\nbeen established by final judgment or by agreement. Therefore, Rodriguez's claim against Farmer's\nwas not ripe when the trial court granted summary judgment. See Certain Underwriters at Lloyds,\nLondon v. Four J's Cmty.

While generally acknowledging that a third party may not *224 sue an insurance\ncompany for payment under its policy without a judgment against the insured, Rodriguez argues\nthe exception recognized in Griffin should be applied here because “undisputed facts pertaining\nto the duty to indemnify ... were included in the summary judgment record [and] are consistent\nwith the factual record at trial and the fact-finder's disposition of the personal injury lawsuit.” We\nfind no merit in this argument.\n\n [14] [15] [16] The holding in Griffin pertained to an underlying tort suit for injuries sustained in\na drive-by shooting. D.R Horton–Tex., Ltd., 300 S.W.3d at 744–45 (citing Griffin, 955 S.W.2d at\n84). The policy in that case excluded coverage for intentional torts. Griffin, 955 S.W.2d at 83. The\nGriffin court thus concluded no “conceivable set of facts” could be developed in the underlying\ncase that would transform the intentional shooting into an auto accident covered by the policy.\nD.R. Horton–Tex., Ltd., 300 S.W.3d at 745. The court held that the duty to indemnify may be\nadjudicated before judgment is entered on the claim against the insured, when the facts negate both\nthe duty to defend and the duty to indemnify. 8 Griffin, 955 S.W.2d at 84. Here, the duty to defend\nis not at issue. 9 More importantly, even though the parties do not dispute the underlying accident\nfacts, the jury was required to decide and apportion liability before judgment could be entered.\nThus, when the lawsuit was filed, coverage of Rodriguez's injury under the Farmers policy was\ncontingent on the jury's future liability finding, if any, including apportionment between Woodling\nand Rodriguez. The Griffin exception is inapplicable. See D.R. Horton–Tex., Ltd., 300 S.W.3d at\n743–45 (distinguishing Griffin ); Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Nat'l Union Fire\nIns.

In reference to the “use”\nexclusion, Allstate contends that “loading and unloading” a trailer is not use as contemplated under\nthe Allstate policy, and even if it were, there is no coverage because Rodriguez's injury did not\n“arise out of” the use of the trailer. We are not persuaded by these arguments.\n\nThe Allstate policy specifies that liability of the owner of an uninsured or underinsured vehicle\n“must arise out of the ownership, *225 maintenance, or use of the uninsured motor vehicle.” 10\n(Emphasis added.) The term “use” is not defined in the policy. Allstate urges us to hold that\n“loading and unloading” is excluded because the “use” clause omits these activities as a matter\nof law. We decline to do so.\n\n [18] [19] Automobile insurers in Texas are required to provide UIM coverage in all policies.\nThe quoted language from the Allstate policy mirrors statutory requirements. See Tex. Ins.Code\n§ 1952.101(a). The purpose of UIM coverage is to protect conscientious drivers from financial\nloss caused by irresponsible parties, and courts liberally construe the UIM statutes.

The accident was within the “natural territorial limits” of the trailer,\neven though Woodling and Rodriguez had taken a few steps out of the trailer.

Accordingly, the allegations did not give rise to a duty to defend by\nthe insurer. Id.; see also Mid–Continent Cas. Co., 323 S.W.3d at 156.

Farmers subsequently filed a plea to the jurisdiction on the same jurisdictional grounds.\n5       Accordingly, we do not reach the other issues presented by Farmers regarding whether Rodriguez's injury was covered by the Farmers\n        policy, whether Rodriguez filed an impermissible direct action against Farmers without first satisfying conditions precedent in the\n        policy, or whether Rodriguez had standing to bring his claim against Farmers. We likewise do not reach two of Allstate's issues\n        asserting that Rodriguez's injuries are covered under the Farmers policy (issues three and four).\n6       This principle applies where the insurance policy contains a so-called “no action” provision.

A “borrower” was defined by the\n      court as “someone who has, with permission of the owner, temporary possession and use of the property of another for his own\n      purposes.” Id. at 244. Before the addition of the loading and unloading endorsement to the standard automobile liability policy, neither\n      the automobile policy nor the standard liability policy defined which insurer had liability coverage for injuries sustained upon the\n      premises of one who was insured under a general liability policy during the loading and unloading of a vehicle not owned or hired\n      by the general liability insured. Id. The court concluded the policy exclusion for persons who were unloaders but not “borrowers”\n      of the vehicle was intended to limit the insurer's liability for injuries of nonemployees who were not borrowers of the vehicle. Id. at\n      245. By contrast, the Allstate policy covers injuries to Rodriguez caused by the owner or operator of an uninsured or underinsured\n      motor vehicle, including “trailer[s] of any type.” It does not expressly limit Allstate's liability based on whether an injured party is\n      a “borrower” of a vehicle.\n13    Allstate also cites an unreported federal district court's opinion that held a “use” clause (without “loading and unloading” language)\n      would not cover injuries sustained by a patient who travelled in an ambulance to the hospital.

Liberty Mutual and\n      Travelers Insurance Company, however, both construe language in standard automobile policies that is identical to the language\n      in the Allstate UIM provision providing coverage for injuries “aris[ing] out of the ownership, maintenance, or use” of the insured\n      vehicle. See Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 556 S.W.2d at 243 n. 1; Travelers Ins. Co., 380 S.W.2d at 612. The UIM policy, moreover,\n      expressly covers as an “[u]ninsured motor vehicle” “a land motor vehicle or trailer of any type.” (Emphasis added.) Thus, the same\n      principles apply here.\n19    [S]ince the act of unloading was one of the natural and necessary steps to the undertaking to deliver the [truck's contents], and followed\n      in natural sequence the use of the truck to that end, which use was specifically contemplated and covered by the policy, we believe\n      that the conclusion is unavoidable that the use of the truck was the primary and efficient cause of the injury, even though it should\n      not be held to be the proximate cause.\n         Panhandle Steel Prods.

Thus, the allegations in the petition were not at issue. The plaintiff proved the vehicle was in use at\n      the time of the accident because the child's “sole purpose was to gain entry into the truck” through the back window and he did not\n      stray from that purpose.

This Court granted\nreview of Jefferson State Bank's petition and reversed the court of appeals' judgment, holding that\nthe statute of repose set forth in Texas Business and Commerce Code section 4.406 barred Lenk's\nclaims because she failed to notify Jefferson State Bank of the unauthorized transactions within\nsixty days of her appointment as estate administrator. 4 Jefferson State Bank, 323 S.W.3d at 149–\n50.\n\nBecause Lenk filed the exact same cause of action against both banks, the only material distinction\nbetween this case and Jefferson State Bank is the theories and *606 defenses asserted by the\nbanks. The resolution of both appeals, however, turns on this distinction. Jefferson State Bank\nraised numerous defenses in the trial court, including the statute of repose under section 4.406, a\ntheory on which it prevailed in this Court. See id. Conversely, Guaranty Bank chose not to raise a\nstatute of repose defense in the trial court. Instead, Guaranty Bank decided to argue that (1) it did\nnot breach the deposit agreement because Thompson's account was closed when Lenk filed her\nsuit, and (2) it did not substantially cause Lenk's injuries.\n\nIn this Court, Guaranty Bank's arguments relate solely to its central contention that it did not breach\nthe account agreement. Specifically, Guaranty Bank claims that it did not breach the agreement\nbecause (1) the account was closed prior to Lenk's payment demand, (2) Lenk acquiesced in\nSpillman's unauthorized withdrawals by waiting almost two years after her appointment to dispute\nthem, and (3) the bank was entitled to rely on Spillman's forged letters of administration. Guaranty\nBank also argues that the court of appeals improperly reviewed the denial of Lenk's motion for\npartial summary judgment. In a cross-petition, Lenk contends we should remand the case to the\ntrial court for a determination of attorney's fees. Because we conclude Guaranty Bank breached the\ndeposit agreement, but failed to raise any affirmative defenses compelling a judgment in its favor,\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Guaranty\nBank maintains that Lenk filed a demand-based claim simply as a way to evade the applicable\nstatutes of limitations or repose, which would have barred alternative claims, such as a wrongful\npayment claim, Lenk chose not to pursue. We disagree.\n\n [2] [3] It is well-settled that a general deposit, such as that at issue here, creates a debtor-creditor\nrelationship between a bank and its customer. Sears v.

Given\nthe debtor-creditor relationship between a bank and a customer and the corresponding requirement\nthat the bank must repay any deposits to the customer, see Sears, 562 S.W.2d at 844, a breach\naction for such a refusal includes funds that were wrongfully paid out by a bank. A customer, after\nall, will always seek the funds that should be on deposit in an account. See Mesquite State Bank,\n488 S.W.2d at 75 (“In suits against a bank to recover deposits, the burden of proving payment\nunder authority from the depositor is on the bank.”). Indeed, Lenk sued for all funds on deposit\nsince Thompson's death (i.e., those funds wrongfully paid out by the bank), not merely for those\nnonexistent funds in the closed account at the time she made her demand. Thus, Lenk's claim for\nbreach of the deposit agreement fairly encompasses any wrongful payment claim she may have\nhad. See id.\n\n [5] Because there was a breach, we must next determine when the breach accrued. “A cause of\naction for denial of deposit liability on a deposit contract ... does not accrue until the bank has\ndenied liability and given notice of the denial [by providing an account statement] to the account\nholder.” TEX. FIN.CODE § 34.301(b). Thus, as a general matter, a bank's refusal to pay funds\non a customer's demand commences the accrual of a demand-based cause of action. See Hodge,\n54 S.W.3d at 525–26. But, importantly, section 34.301(b) goes on to state: “A bank that provides\nan account statement ... to the account holder is considered to have denied liability and given the\nnotice as to any amount not shown on the statement....” TEX. FIN.CODE § 34.301(b). Guaranty\nBank urges us to hold that any cause of action for breach of the deposit agreement thus accrued\nwhen it denied liability by sending account statements to Spillman in 2000.\n\nJefferson State Bank precludes this holding. In that case, we unconditionally rejected Jefferson\nState Bank's contention that it satisfied its burden of sending or making available statements when\nit sent them to the imposter Spillman. Jefferson State Bank, 323 S.W.3d at 149 (concluding that\n“sending Spillman the statements could not fulfill the Bank's obligation to *608 provide account\nstatements ‘to a customer’ ” (citing TEX. BUS. & COM.CODE § 4.406(a))). While Jefferson State\nBank concerned the statute of repose under section 4.406 of the Business and Commerce Code,\nthe rationale and logic of that opinion apply equally here. As we observed in Jefferson State Bank,\nany reliance Jefferson State Bank may have had on Spillman's fraudulent letters of administration\nwould not have altered the fact that Spillman was not the bank's customer. See id.; see also TEX.\nBUS. & COM.CODE § 4.406(a), (f) (precluding a bank customer “from asserting against the bank\n[an] unauthorized signature” if the customer does not timely “discover and report the customer's\nunauthorized signature” after the bank “sends or makes available to a customer a statement of\naccount”).\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

FIN.CODE § 34.301(b). Spillman, an\nimposter administrator, was not the account holder. Under Guaranty Bank's reasoning, Lenk's\ndemand-based cause of action would have accrued when Guaranty Bank began sending statements\nto Spillman in 2000, three years before Lenk—the legitimate estate administrator—was even\nappointed. In Jefferson State Bank, we held that in the event of a customer's death, a bank satisfies\nits section 4.406 burden of making an account statement available by retaining statements at a\nbank, but that the customer's burden to report unauthorized signatures does not arise until an estate\nrepresentative is appointed. Jefferson State Bank, 323 S.W.3d at 149–50. The same logic should\napply when determining when a bank denies liability in the face of a demand-based claim. We thus\nconclude that Guaranty Bank denied liability once Lenk was appointed administrator in 2003. See\nid. 5 At that point, Lenk would have had the opportunity to review any statements for the account\nprior to its closing and bring a timely demand-based claim.\n\n [6] Guaranty Bank's speculative argument that Lenk sued for breach of the deposit agreement\nin order to circumvent the applicable statute of repose under section 4.406 is also devoid of any\nmerit. As mentioned previously, Lenk filed the exact same cause of action—on the same day—\nin this case as she did in Jefferson State Bank. In Jefferson State Bank, we held that the statute of\nrepose barred Lenk's claim. Jefferson State Bank, 323 S.W.3d at 150.\n\n [7] [8] The statute of repose requires a person to report unauthorized transactions to a bank within\none year of account statements being made available. See TEX. BUS. & COM.CODE § 4.406(f).\nIf a person fails to report the unauthorized transaction, the *609 person is barred from bringing\na claim for payment. See id. The statute of repose demands that a person report unauthorized\ntransactions as a condition precedent to bringing suit. See, e.g., Am. Airlines Emps. Fed. Credit\nUnion v.

Under Section 34.301(b), her action\nagainst the bank accrued then, not in June 2005.”). The dissent parts company by believing that\ndemand-based claims do not exist. Id. at 614 (“The problem with the claim Lenk asserts is not that\nit is time-barred; the problem is that under Section 34.301(b), the claim does not exist, and for good\nreason.”). This statement either ignores the fact that we have consistently recognized demand-\nbased claims since 1913, see Shannon, 159 S.W. at 401, or that section 34.301(b) changed only\nwhen those demand-based claims begin to accrue for limitations purposes. Section 34.301(b) limits\nwhen demand-based claims may be brought but it does not eliminate them. Unlike limitations,\nrepose does not depend on when a cause begins to accrue.

Shannon, 159 S.W.\nat 401. And they also have the protection of various defenses. Our decision today gives full effect\nto these claims and defenses. Further, there is no evidence in the record identifying the source\nof the additional funds and there is certainly no evidence to suggest they came from somewhere\nother than the estate.\n\nLenk's cause of action for breach of the deposit agreement began to accrue when she was appointed\nin 2003, and thus was able to access the estate's account statements for the first time. However,\nGuaranty Bank did not raise a viable defense that compels judgment in its favor. Accordingly, we\nhold that Guaranty Bank breached the deposit agreement and that it raised no defense that negates\nits liability.\n\n\n\n                                        II. Estoppel by Acquiescence\n\n [12] Guaranty Bank argues that Lenk acquiesced to any unauthorized withdrawals by failing to\ndispute them for nearly two years after her appointment. In doing so, Guaranty Bank relies on\nL.G. Balfour Co., a 1938 court of appeals decision. We reject this argument. L.G. Balfour merely\nstates the statute of repose rule later codified in section 4.406 of the Business and Commerce\nCode. Thus, the theory of estoppel by acquiescence is not distinct from the affirmative defense of\nsection 4.406 which, as previously mentioned, Guaranty *611 Bank did not rely on in the trial\ncourt or at this Court.

Reliance on Forged Letters of Administration\n\n [13] Guaranty Bank next claims that, under Texas Probate Code section 186, it was entitled to\nrely on Spillman's apparently valid letters of administration when it allowed Spillman to access\nThompson's account. In Jefferson State Bank, we did not reach this issue because Lenk's claim\nwas barred by the statute of repose. 323 S.W.3d at 147 n. 3. We decline to consider the section\n186 argument here because Guaranty bank did not raise this issue at the trial court, and therefore\nfailed to preserve error. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 166a(c).\n\n\n\n                        IV. Review of Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n\n [14] [15] Guaranty Bank argues the court of appeals erred in reviewing the trial court's denial\nof Lenk's motion for partial summary judgment. It contends that, because Lenk failed to move for\nsummary judgment on her request for attorney's fees, the trial court's order denying her motion is\nnot a final order subject to appellate court review. But, Lenk correctly responds that:\n\n            When both parties move for partial summary judgment on the same issues and\n            the trial court grants one motion and denies the other, as here, the reviewing court\n            considers the summary judgment evidence presented by both sides, determines\n            all questions presented, and if the reviewing court determines that the trial court\n            erred, renders the judgment the trial court should have rendered.\n\nValence Operating Co. v.

Cross–Petition for Attorney's Fees\n\n [16] Lenk filed a cross-petition seeking a remand to the trial court to determine an award of\nattorney's fees. Lenk claims that, because this issue was not addressed in her motion for partial\nsummary judgment, it should now be reviewed by the trial court.

The bank argues that both\nparties chose to narrow their appellate arguments, and should be limited to the issues briefed and\nthe relief requested below. We agree with Guaranty Bank.\n\nIn her motion for partial summary judgment, Lenk sought damages for Guaranty Bank's breach\nand asked that the sole remaining issue for determination in the case be her request for attorney's\nfees. The trial court issued a final judgment denying Lenk's motion. On appeal, Lenk focused on\nher breach claim, and asked the court of appeals to reverse and render in her favor, which the court\ndid. Later, Lenk raised the issue of attorney's fees in a motion for rehearing, which the court of\nappeals denied. We decline to address Lenk's claim for attorney's fees because she did not properly\nraise the issue at the court of appeals. See, e.g., TEX.R.APP. P. 53.2(f) (explaining that, when a\nparty files a petition for review in the Supreme Court, “[i]f the matter complained of originated\nin the trial court, it should have been ... assigned as error in the court of appeals”). Thus, we deny\nLenk's cross-petition.\n\n\n\n                                                 VI. Conclusion\n\nLenk's claim for breach of the deposit agreement began to accrue in 2003, when Lenk was\nappointed as estate administrator. Because the bank breached the deposit agreement, yet failed to\nraise viable affirmative defenses against Lenk's breach claim, we will not render judgment in its\nfavor. Lenk's cross-petition for attorney's fees was not properly raised in the court of appeals, and\nthus we reject this claim as well. Accordingly, we grant Guaranty Bank's petition for review and,\nwithout hearing oral argument, TEX.R.APP. P. 59.1, affirm the court of appeals' judgment.\n\n\n\nJustice HECHT filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice GREEN joined.\n\nJustice HECHT, joined by Justice GREEN, dissenting.\nJohn Albert Thompson died in January 2000 with about $3,000 on deposit in a Guaranty Bank\nchecking account. A few weeks later, Mel Spillman falsely represented to the Bank that he was\nThompson's nephew and estate administrator, and directed that he be named on Thompson's\naccount. The Bank complied. Spillman then deposited around $167,000 to the account, and over\nthe next several months proceeded to withdraw all but a small amount that was eaten up in service\ncharges. The Bank closed the account on September 13, 2001.\n\nSpillman was a fraud. He forged letters of administration in dozens of estates like *613\nThompson's. In June 2002, he was sentenced to ten years in prison.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 10\n\fFederal Deposit Ins. Corp. v.

In June 2005, Lenk demanded that the Bank repay the funds\nSpillman had withdrawn from Thompson's account years earlier. The Bank refused, and Lenk sued.\nThe trial court granted summary judgment for the Bank; the court of appeals reversed, holding\nthat summary judgment should have been granted for Lenk. 1\n\nThe first sentence of Section 34.301(b) of the Texas Finance Code states: “A cause of action for\ndenial of deposit liability on a deposit contract without a maturity date does not accrue until the\nbank has denied liability and given notice of the denial to the account holder.” 2 Lenk contends\nthat her action against the Bank for allowing unauthorized withdrawals from Thompson's checking\naccount until January 2001 accrued in June 2005, when she demanded that the Bank return the\nmoney, and the Bank refused. The Court agrees that this is Lenk's contention—“[Lenk] claimed\nthe bank breached the deposit agreement by refusing her payment demand” 3 —and that it is correct\n—“the bank refused to pay general deposit funds to the rightful account holder (Lenk), and so ...\nbreached the deposit agreement.” 4\n\nBut Lenk's claim ignores the second sentence of Section 34.301(b): “A bank that provides an\naccount statement or passbook to the account holder is considered to have denied liability and\ngiven the notice as to any amount not shown on the statement or passbook.” 5 In Jefferson\nState Bank v. Lenk, we held that a bank that makes account statements available at its offices\nis considered to have denied liability for, and given notice of, unauthorized withdrawals from\na deceased customer's checking account when a representative is appointed for the decedent's\nestate. 6 Lenk was appointed the representative of Thompson's estate in September 2003. Under\nSection 34.301(b), her action against the Bank accrued then, not in June 2005.\n\nThe Court observes that suit based on a claim that accrued in September 2003 would be\ntimebarred 7 and faults the Bank *614 for not making that argument. But the Bank argues, and\nthe Court specifically acknowledges, that Lenk's claim is for the Bank's refusal of her June 2005\ndemand. Lenk pleaded in her petition:\n\n\n On June 4, 2005, [Lenk] made demand upon [the Bank] for the payment of [unauthorized\n withdrawals] from the account, and [the Bank] has failed and refused to pay over to [Lenk] the\n sums due and owing from the account.\n***\n\n   Under the terms of the depositor's agreement with [Thompson] and applicable law, [the Bank]\n   was required to pay sums on deposit to [Lenk] on demand or to her order to such persons as she\n   may direct. [The Bank] failed and refused to pay to [Lenk] the sums deposited upon her demand.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Accordingly, [Lenk] is entitled\n   to judgment....\n\nShe argued to the court of appeals:\n\n            In Plaintiff's Original Petition, [Lenk] stated that [her] cause of action is based\n            upon the requirements of the depositors agreement and [the Bank's] refusal to\n            pay [Lenk] the sums deposited into Mr. Thompson's account after her demand.\n\nLenk could not have been clearer. She alleged that her June 2005 demand triggered her claim. She\nsued the Bank days later. An assertion by the Bank that her claim for its refusal of her demand\nwas time-barred would have been frivolous.\n\nThe problem with the claim Lenk asserts is not that it is time-barred; the problem is that, under\nSection 34.301(b), the claim does not exist, and for good reason. Allowing a bank customer to\ncreate a cause of action merely by writing a demand letter, as Lenk contends, would circumvent\nall time limitations on claims for unauthorized withdrawals. That is what the Court has done in\nthis case.\n\nIt bears comment that the Court hands Lenk a windfall. Not only does she recover the $3,000\nSpillman stole from Thompson's account, Lenk recovers about $145,000 of the money that\nSpillman laundered through the account, using letters of administration the Bank had no reason\nto know were forged, on a claim filed nearly four years after the account was closed and nearly\ntwo years after she was on notice of all the transactions. But the consequences of the Court's\nmisapplication of Section 34.301(b), in this case decided without argument, will be significant to\nthe entire financial industry in Texas.\n\nI respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

For ease of\n       reference, we refer to the FDIC as Guaranty Bank throughout this opinion.\n2      In this case, Spillman gained access to an account belonging to John Albert Thompson, who died on January 30, 2000. After Spillman\n       deposited and withdrew various amounts from the account, Lenk alleged that he stole $148,430.28 from Thompson's estate.\n3      Lenk specifically asserted in each petition:\n             Under the terms of the depositor's agreement with Decedent and applicable law, Defendant was required to pay sums on deposit\n             to Plaintiff on demand or to her order to such persons as she may direct. Defendant failed and refused to pay to Plaintiff the\n             sums deposited upon her demand. Accordingly, Plaintiff is entitled to judgment in the amount of all sums which were deposited\n             in the name of Decedent or his representative since the date of his death.\n4      The statute sets a one-year period of repose, which was contractually shortened to sixty days in that case.\n\n5      The fact that the account was closed when Lenk demanded payment does not change our analysis. Under the bank's rationale, a bank\n       could wrongfully pay out an account's entire balance to an imposter, as happened here, then unilaterally close the account to avoid\n       liability to the account holder or proper estate administrator. Further, as discussed above, in a situation such as this where the bank\n       has paid out sums to an imposter, a plaintiff in Lenk's position will naturally seek to withdraw the amount of funds that should be on\n       deposit, not the actual account balance after the wrongful withdrawals. Given the debtor-creditor relationship between a bank and its\n       customer and the requirement that a bank must repay any deposits to a customer on her order, it follows that a person is entitled to\n       demand payment for amounts that should be on deposit, not the amount actually in the account after wrongful withdrawals, even if\n       the bank has unilaterally closed the account. See Mesquite State Bank, 488 S.W.2d at 75.\n6      As explained supra, section 34.301(b) of the Finance Code indicates that Lenk's cause of action began to accrue in 2003 when Lenk\n       was appointed administrator.\n7      See also TEX.R.

Because we conclude the trial judge correctly interpreted the three\nwritten contracts governing the parties' relationship, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n\n\n\n                                             I. BACKGROUND\n\nBaylor provides health care services to individual patients. Many of Baylor's patients are members\nof health plans. Baylor has many contracts with health benefit entities, including insurance\ncompanies and preferred provider organizations (PPOs), through which individual patients gain\naccess to Baylor's hospitals and services at discounted rates.\n\nPrivate Healthcare Systems, Inc. (PHCS) operates a network of PPOs. PHCS enters into contracts\nknown as preferred provider agreements with health care providers (such as Baylor) to negotiate\ndiscounts from the providers' full charges for health care services. PHCS also enters into contracts\nknown as subscriber services agreements with insurance companies, employer health plans,\nmanaged care organizations, and third-party administrators, to provide them and their members\naccess to health care services at the discounted rates established by the preferred provider\nagreements.\n\nGPA is a third-party administrator; its customers are self-funded health plans. Third-party\nadministrators provide claims handling services and administrative support to health plans. By\ncontracting with various PPO networks, such as PHCS, GPA also offers its customers—and their\nmembers—access to medical services from a network of providers (e.g. Baylor) at discounted\nrates.\n\nBaylor sued GPA for failure to pay for health care services Baylor provided to members of certain\nhealth care plans administered by GPA. GPA in turn filed a third-party action against PHCS.\nBoth Baylor and GPA moved for summary judgment; Baylor in fact filed several motions for\npartial summary judgment. The trial judge granted Baylor's motions and denied GPA's motion.\nThe parties then entered into an agreed final judgment and severance, by which GPA's third-\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

DISCUSSION\n\nA. The Contracts\nBaylor relies on three written contracts to establish its claim against GPA. First, Baylor\nrelies on a Subscriber Services Agreement between PHCS and GPA dated April 17, 1998,\namended by an Amendment, *472 Assignment, and Assumption of the Subscriber Services\nAgreement with effective dates of September 1, 2002 and January 1, 2003. Under the Subscriber\nServices Agreement, GPA 2 became a subscriber to PHCS's “comprehensive medical management\nsystem.” 3 As a subscriber to PHCS's network, GPA could offer its customers access to PHCS's\nnetwork of medical care providers at the discount rates negotiated by PHCS.\n\nSecond, Baylor relies on a Hospital Services Agreement (HSA) between Baylor and PHCS dated\nJanuary 1, 2002. Under the HSA, Baylor became a “Preferred Provider” in PHCS's network. It\nagreed to provide—at discounted rates 4 —health care services (“Covered Services”) to persons\n(“Members”) covered by “Health Plans” (including PPOs) created or sponsored by a “Payor” (a\ndefined term in the HSA). As part of the HSA, PHCS warranted that its contracts with each Payor\nobligate the “Payor (or its designee) to comply with the duties and obligations of [the HSA],\nincluding, but not limited to, paying for Covered Services rendered to Members in accordance\nwith the provisions of Article IV of [the HSA].”\n\nThird, Baylor relies on a Subscriber Acknowledgment between GPA and PHCS effective January\n1, 2003. The Subscriber Acknowledgment refers to both the Subscriber Services Agreement and\nthe HSA, reciting that GPA and PHCS have entered into the Subscriber Services Agreement and\nthat PHCS has entered into contracts with health care providers for participation in its network. The\nSubscriber Acknowledgment requires GPA “to pay or arrange to pay PHCS Preferred Providers\n[which would include Baylor] in accordance with the PHCS Preferred Provider Agreement for\nsuch Preferred Provider, for the markets and the networks for which [GPA] has purchased provider\nnetwork Services from PHCS.” (First brackets added.)\n\n\nB. Is GPA a “Payor”?\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                    4\n\fGPA Holding, Inc. v. Baylor Health Care System, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2546332\"><a href=\"/opinion/2546332/gpa-holding-v-baylor-health-care-sys/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2011)\n\n\n\nIn its first issue, GPA contends the trial court erred in granting Baylor's motion for summary\njudgment because GPA is not a “payor” under the HSA. At the outset, GPA makes a procedural\nargument that summary judgment was improper because Baylor did not move for summary\njudgment on this issue. We disagree.\n\n *473 Baylor filed four motions for partial summary judgment. In its first motion, Baylor requested\nthat the trial court interpret the three contracts at issue and “find, as a matter of law, that GPA is\nbound by the terms and conditions of the HSA with respect to the health care claims at issue in this\ncase, including the requirements of Section 4.4(a).” In its own motion for summary judgment, GPA\nargued, “GPA is not a ‘Payor’ obligated to pay under the terms of the Baylor/PHCS Agreement,”\nand Baylor filed a summary judgment response again arguing that GPA was bound by the terms\nof the agreement.\n\n [11] The trial court granted Baylor's motion and denied GPA's, necessarily deciding that GPA\nwas a “Payor” bound by the provisions of the HSA, including section 4.4(a). We reject GPA's\nargument that the issue was not presented to and decided by the trial court.\n\nTurning to GPA's substantive argument, GPA asserts the HSA defines “Payor” very narrowly.\nIt argues the evidence established that GPA's clients—and not itself—were “Payors” under the\nHSA. It contends that as a third party administrator, it did not actually pay claims but only offered\nadministrative services to facilitate payment of claims by the employer-funded health plans that\nwere GPA's clients. Because the HSA's payment provisions apply only to “Payors” and GPA is\nnot a Payor, GPA contends it is not responsible to pay for Baylor's services, and thus that the trial\ncourt erred in entering summary judgment in favor of Baylor.\n\nThe HSA defines a “Payor” as\n\n            an insurance company, employer health plans, Taft–Hartley fund, plan sponsors\n            or other similarly situated entities or organizations which are obligated (directly\n            or through its designee) to pay for Covered Services for Members in accordance\n            with such Health Plans.\n\nGPA offered the affidavits of Kathy Enochs, the chief operating officer of GPA, and Madalyn\nStraughn, the vice president of operations for GPA, to establish that GPA is not an insurance\ncompany, employer health plan, Taft–Hartley fund, or plan sponsor. Enochs also testified that\nGPA was not a “payor” under the definition in the contract.\n\nGPA does not dispute it is a party to the Subscriber Services Agreement and the Subscriber\nAcknowledgment. In fact, Enochs testified GPA could not access PHCS's preferred providers at\na discount without the Subscriber Services Agreement and the Subscriber Acknowledgment.

In the Subscriber Acknowledgment, GPA\n“agrees to pay or arrange to pay PHCS Preferred Providers in accordance with the PHCS Preferred\nProvider Agreement for each such Preferred provider, for the markets and the networks for which\nSubscriber has purchased provider network Services from PHCS.”\n\nThe discounts offered to GPA's customers were the result of the relationships among the parties\nto all three agreements. If PHCS did not contract with Baylor under the HSA, there would be no\ndiscount to PHCS's subscribers on the fees for Baylor's services. If GPA did not in turn contract\nwith PHCS to take advantage of the discounts offered in the HSA, those *474 discounts would\nnot have been available to GPA's customers.\n\n [12] In Baylor University Medical Center v. Epoch Group, L.C., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2452562\"><a href=\"/opinion/2452562/baylor-university-medical-center-v-epoch-group/\"><span class=\"volume\">340</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Epoch Group, 340 F.Supp.2d at 752. Discussing its conclusion that the three\ndocuments constituted a single, unified contract, the court reasoned:\n\n            Indeed, all three instruments were required to complete the relationship between\n            the parties. The Subscriber Services Agreement, which provided discounts from\n            PHCS to Payors, could not operate effectively without PHCS contracting with\n            providers through hospital services agreements. The very foundation of the\n            discounts offered in [the] Subscriber Services Agreement appears to be the\n            agreements between PHCS and providers such as Baylor. Moreover, Payor\n            Acknowledgments serve no apparent purpose other than to commit Payors to\n            comply with the terms and conditions of the provider agreements.\n\nId. at 755 (citation omitted).\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Perhaps because Epoch signed a document called “payor\nacknowledgment” instead of “subscriber acknowledgment,” the issue whether Epoch was a\n“payor” for purposes of the agreements was not presented to the Epoch Group court. Regardless\nof the titles of the two agreements, however, their substance was the same: to commit the payor or\nsubscriber “to comply with the terms and conditions of the provider agreements,” so that provider\ndiscounts set forth in hospital services agreements could be extended to the subscriber's customers.\nSee id. at 755.\n\n [13] We conclude, as did the trial court, that GPA is bound by the HSA. Reading the three\nagreements together, GPA committed to abide by the terms of the HSA and to pay or arrange to\npay Baylor in accordance with the HSA. Even though the summary judgment evidence showed\nthat GPA was not an “insurance company, employer health plan[ ], Taft–Hartley fund, [or] plan\nsponsor[ ],” we conclude the evidence (i.e. the three contracts) proves as a matter of law that\nGPA falls within the contractual definition of “other similarly situated entities or organizations\nwhich are obligated (directly or through its designee) to pay for Covered Services for Members in\naccordance with such Health Plans.” We overrule GPA's first issue.\n\n\nB. “Liquidated Damages” or “Penalty”?\nThe HSA also contains terms regarding payment of claims:\n\n  4.4 Claim Processing\n\n  (a) Payor (or its designee) shall pay all Clean Claims for Covered Services *475 within forty-\n     five (45) calendar days of receipt of a Clean Claim containing the information set out in\n     Section 4.3 from Hospital in accordance with the applicable reimbursement rates attached on\n     Schedule 1. ...

In support of its motion for summary judgment, GPA offered evidence comparing\nthe discounted rates to the hospital's normal billed rates for the charges at issue. GPA offered a\nchart attached to the affidavit of Madalyn Straughn that showed the percentage difference between\nthe discounted rate and the normal billed charge for each of the charges at issue. GPA notes “the\noverwhelming majority of the percentage charges are 33% or more.”\n\nIn response to GPA's motion for summary judgment, Baylor offered evidence regarding the\ndifficulty of estimation and the reasonableness of the charges. Baylor offered the affidavit of Janda\nEdwards to explain that Baylor's normal billed charge “is the amount Baylor charges for services\nand supplies to entities or individuals who do not have access to a discount through a contract with\nBaylor.” Edwards explained Baylor's normal billed charge “is established by each facility and is\nbased upon an analysis of many factors including the service provided, the amount of personnel\ntime needed to provide the service, the amount of capital equipment needed to provide the service,\nthe amount of routine equipment needed to provide the service, the overhead, and market value.”\nEdwards also testified that Baylor's normal billed charge is a reasonable amount for the health care\nservices and supplies provided in the charges at issue in this case.\n\n [20] [21] GPA quotes from Edwards's affidavit and argues, “Baylor offered no justification\nattempting to show how the changed billing rate was a reasonable estimate of the cost associated\nwith payments being untimely.” GPA posits that a “more reasonable” calculation would be “a $30\nservice fee and 18% annual interest,” and argues, “our society routinely deals with late payments\nby a modest service fee and interest, and thus Baylor's damages were calculable.” GPA does\nnot offer evidence to support these arguments, however. The difficulty (or lack of difficulty) in\nestimation as well as the unreasonableness of the damages estimate were GPA's to prove. Urban\nTelevision Network Corp., 277 S.W.3d at 919. General statements about a “more reasonable” or\n“modest” rate are not evidence that the harm from late payment is difficult to estimate, or that the\nnormal billed charges were an unreasonable forecast of the loss actually sustained. See Phillips,\n820 S.W.2d at 788. GPA also emphasized that Baylor itself referred to the normal billed charge as\na “penalty.” The substance of the provision controls, however.

Therefore, GPA argues,\nany claims arising in 2002 or before were included improperly in the trial court's judgment.\n\nBaylor counters that GPA's obligations were set forth in the Subscriber Services Agreement,\nincluding the agreement to abide by any agreement between PHCS and a hospital, and those\nobligations did not change in 2003. Because GPA accepted the benefits of the agreements before\n2003, Baylor argues, it must also accept the obligations.\n\n [22] We agree with Baylor that GPA's obligation to abide by the HSA did not change in 2003.\nWhile the “pay or arrange to pay” language does not appear in the Subscriber Services Agreement,\nGPA did agree at that time to abide by the provisions of the HSA, and, as noted in Epoch\nGroup, “the very foundation” of the discounts offered to GPA's customers are “the agreements\nbetween PHCS and providers such as Baylor.” Epoch Group, 340 F.Supp.2d at 755. The Epoch\nGroup court commented that the payor acknowledgments “serve no apparent purpose other than\nto commit Payors to comply with the terms and conditions of the provider agreements.” Id.\nThe contractual relationship among the parties was established when GPA signed the Subscriber\nServices Agreement and began to take advantage of the discounted rates offered under the HSA.\nThe trial court did not err in awarding damages for the period of time before GPA signed the\nSubscriber Acknowledgment. We overrule GPA's third issue.\n\n\n\n                                                         CONCLUSION\n\nWe overrule GPA's issues and affirm the trial court's judgment.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    The trial court's judgment recites that the full name of the plaintiff is “Baylor Health Care System, on behalf of Baylor All Saints\n        Medical Center, Baylor Heart and Vascular Hospital, Baylor Specialty Hospital, Baylor Institute for Rehabilitation, Baylor University\n        Medical Center, Baylor Medical Center at Garland, Baylor Regional Medical Center at Grapevine, Baylor Medical Center at Irving,\n        Our Children's House at Baylor, Baylor Regional Medical Center at Plano, and Baylor Medical Center Ellis County.”\n2       The Subscriber Services Agreement was actually between PHCS and a Texas corporation named “Group & Pension Administrators,\n        Inc.” The parties entered into a Rule 11 agreement that “[f]or purposes of this case, G & P Administrators, Inc, and GPA Holding,\n        Inc. agree that they can be treated as one entity for the purpose of discovery and liability.” In accordance with this agreement, in\n        this opinion we will refer only to GPA.\n3       The Subscriber Services Agreement recites its purpose:\n           A.

Phillips v. Phillips, supra.\n\n *2 In this case, the initial burden was on the movant. However, when a party raises the affirmative\ndefense of penalty, that party assumes the burden to conclusively establish the defense. Baker v.\nInternational Record Syndicate, Inc., supra.Therefore, the burden was upon Healix to prove that\nthe contractual liquidated damages was an unenforceable penalty.\n\nThe settlement agreement offered as summary judgment evidence by Dr. Bellos showed that the\nparties agreed to keep the nature of the settlement agreement confidential. The parties further\nagreed that a breach of the confidentiality clause would result in imminent and irreparable harm\nand that the damages for a breach of confidentiality would be $10,000.00. Healix admitted in its\nresponse to Dr. Bellos's request for admissions that it agreed to the confidentiality of the agreement\nand that it agreed to the $10,000.00 liquidated damages clause. Dr. Bellos's affidavit reflected that\nhe agreed to the confidential nature of the agreement and that he had performed all acts required of\nhim under the settlement agreement. His affidavit further showed that Methodist subjected him to\na re-credentialing process every two years. He was unaware of how the disclosure of the agreement\nwould affect the re-credentialing process, but states that he has been harmed in a manner that is\n“incapable of or difficult of estimation.”\n\nAs part of its proof, Healix attached the affidavit of Heather Hughes–Glass, the corporate risk\nmanager for Healix. In her affidavit, Heather Hughes–Glass stated that, as soon as she became\naware of the confidentiality provision of the agreement that was sent to Methodist, she contacted\nDean Matthys, the corporate risk manager for Methodist, to have him destroy the agreement. She\nfurther stated that Matthys indicated that only he and his assistant were aware of the settlement\nagreement. Also included in the summary judgment evidence was an affidavit given by Matthys as\nwell as a letter from Matthys to Healix. These documents indicated that the copy of the settlement\nagreement was destroyed soon after it was received by Methodist and that the only two people to\nsee the agreement, Matthys and his assistant Lisa Irby, were not involved with the re-credentialing\nprocess at Methodist. Finally, Healix offered as summary judgment evidence Dr. Bellos's response\nto a request for disclosure that any economic damages suffered by Dr. Bellos were difficult to\nestimate.\n\nThis evidence does not meet the burden Healix must bear: that at the time the agreement was made\ndamages could be easily ascertained and that the amount of the liquidated damages award was not\na reasonable forecast of just compensation. Healix contends that the award of liquidated damages\nis disproportionate to the actual damages suffered by Dr. Bellos because Dr. Bellos did not have\nany actual damages. To emphasize this point, Healix relies on Baker.“If the liquidated damages are\nshown to be disproportionate to the actual damages, then the liquidated damages can be declared a\npenalty and recovery limited to actual damages proven.”Baker v.

International Record Syndicate, Inc., supra.That damages are not yet ascertainable\nis not tantamount to evidence of “zero” damages.\n\n *3 The summary judgment evidence establishes that there was an agreement between Healix and\nDr. Bellos that prohibited the disclosure of the nature of the settlement agreement and that Dr.\nBellos performed all the required acts under the agreement. Healix breached the agreement by\nsending a copy of the agreement to Methodist.

The court's opinion of November 10, 1999, is\nwithdrawn and this opinion is substituted in its place.\n\nIn this original proceeding, relator seeks a writ of mandamus directing the trial court to vacate two\norders in the underlying divorce case: (1) denying reinstatement of an “original counter petition”\nfor divorce, and (2) setting aside a mediated settlement agreement. Because the first order is not\nreviewable by mandamus and the second order was not a clear abuse of discretion, we deny the\nwrit.\n\n\n\n                                              Background\n\nLuckmi Kasschau (“Luckmi”), the real party in interest, sued relator, Richard Allan Kasschau\n(“Richard”), for divorce in the 312th District Court of Harris County. In her petition, Luckmi\nsought not only dissolution of the marriage, but also conservatorship and support of their two\nchildren and division of the community estate. Richard answered the suit with a general denial, a\nplea for confirmation of his separate property, and a request for reimbursement, attorney's fees, and\nexpenses. The parties subsequently agreed to mediation. The parties settled all issues at mediation\nand the court approved the settlement. 1\n\nBefore the court entered judgment, however, Luckmi nonsuited her divorce petition. Unaware\nof the nonsuit, Richard filed an “original counter-petition” for divorce. In his counter-petition,\nRichard sought enforcement of the mediated settlement agreement, denied paternity of the second\nchild born during the marriage, and asserted various tort claims against Luckmi and Shivi Kumar\nPawa (“Shivi”), the alleged father of the second child. Luckmi subsequently filed in the same court\na new petition for divorce, seeking the same relief sought in her first suit. Luckmi also denied\nRichard's paternity of the second child and sought various temporary orders.\n\nMeanwhile, back in the first suit, Richard filed a motion to reinstate his counter-petition for\ndivorce and to consolidate the two divorce actions. He also asked the court to enter judgment\non the mediated settlement agreement. Luckmi opposed the motion for judgment, asserting that:\n(1) certain conditions precedent to judgment had not been satisfied; namely, Shivi had not\nfiled an intervention as contemplated *309 by the settlement agreement, and (2) the settlement\nagreement was void because it required Richard to turn over certain audiotape recordings of\nLuckmi for destruction by the parties' attorneys, an act Luckmi claimed would be illegal. See TEX.\nPEN.CODE ANN. §§ 16.02(b)(1), 37.09(a)(1) (Vernon 1994).\n\nAt a hearing on these motions, the trial court granted the motion to consolidate the two divorce\nactions based on its conclusion that Luckmi's nonsuit did not defeat the mediated settlement\nagreement. The court, however, denied Richard's motion to reinstate the counter-petition, finding\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The court withdrew its approval\nof the mediated settlement agreement, finding the agreement void and unenforceable because it\nrequired performance of an illegal act. The court put its first two rulings in writing by order signed\nthe same day as the hearing.\n\nAfter the hearing, Richard filed a request to enforce the terms of the mediated settlement\nagreement, except for the allegedly illegal provision. In the meantime, Shivi filed an intervention\nseeking to establish paternity, conservatorship and support of the second child. After the trial court\nsigned an order setting aside the entire mediated settlement agreement, Richard filed this petition\nfor writ of mandamus. 2\n\n\n\n                                               Mandamus\n\n [1] Mandamus relief is available if the trial court violates a duty imposed by law or clearly\nabuses its discretion, either in resolving factual issues or in determining legal issues when there\nis no adequate remedy at law.

Instead, the court merely refused to consider Richard's\ncounter-petition for divorce. We can see no reason to remedy the court's ruling by mandamus\nrather than by an appeal. The requirement that a person seeking mandamus relief establish the lack\nof an appellate remedy is a “fundamental tenet” of mandamus practice. See In re Masonite Corp.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2419813\"><a href=\"/opinion/2419813/in-re-masonite-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 199–201 (Tex. 1999) (J. Baker dissenting) (and cases cited therein). An appellate\nremedy is not inadequate merely because it may involve more expense or delay than obtaining\nmandamus. See id. Although, on rare occasions, exceptional circumstances may justify mandamus\nrelief despite the presence of a generally adequate appellate remedy, such circumstances do not\nexist when a trial court's ruling is merely incidental to the trial process and does not permanently\ndeprive a party of substantial rights. See id. at 199–201. Furthermore, the mere fact that a trial\ncourt's erroneous order will result in an eventual reversal on appeal does not mean that trial will be\na “waste of judicial resources.” See id. Rather, mandamus should issue only in situations involving\nmanifest and urgent necessity and not for grievances to which other remedies may apply. See id.\nat 198–99. Because Richard neglects to explain why the court's ruling on his motion to reinstate\ncannot be remedied by an appeal, we decline to address the court's ruling by mandamus.\n\n\n\n                          Judgment on the Mediated Settlement Agreement\n\nRichard also contends the trial court violated a ministerial duty by refusing to enter judgment on\nthe mediated settlement agreement. Sections 6.602(b) and 153.0071(d) of the Family Code state\nthat “a mediated settlement agreement is binding on the parties if the agreement: (1) provides in\na separate paragraph that the agreement is not subject to revocation; (2) is signed by each party\nto the agreement; and (3) is signed by the parties' attorney, if any, who is present at the time\nthe agreement is signed.” Section 157.0071(d) adds the requirement of “an underlined statement\nthat the agreement is not subject to revocation.” Finally, subsections (c) and (e) of these statutes\nprovide that “a party is entitled to judgment” on a mediated settlement agreement that meets the\nabove requirements “notwithstanding Rule 11 ... or another rule of law.”\n\n [10] It is undisputed that the mediated settlement agreement in the underlying case meets the\nrequirements of sections 6.602(b) and 153.0071(d). Relying on these Family Code provisions,\nRichard argues that Luckmi could not revoke her consent to the agreement by nonsuiting her\ndivorce action and that the trial court violated a ministerial duty by refusing to enter judgment on\nthe agreement.

One of the two reported cases addressing section 153.0071 of the Family Code holds that\nsubsection (e) requires the trial court to enter judgment on a mediated settlement agreement that\nmeets the requirements of subsection (d). See Alvarez v.

The wife answered and filed a cross-petition for divorce. See id. At mediation, the parties\nreached a settlement agreement that complied with the requirements of section 153.071(d). See\nid. The trial court entered judgment on the mediated settlement agreement even though the wife\nhad withdrawn her consent to the agreement. See id. The wife appealed and the appellate court\naffirmed, concluding that: (1) a party's unilateral withdrawal of consent does not negate the\nenforceability of a mediated settlement agreement that complies with section 153.0071(d), and (2)\n“a separate suit for enforcement of a contract [i]s not necessary.” Id. at 234.\n\nHere, the issue is not whether Luckmi could revoke her consent to the mediated settlement\nagreement, but whether the agreement itself was valid and enforceable. Notably, the lower court\ndid not rule that Luckmi had revoked her consent to the mediated settlement agreement by taking\na nonsuit. To the contrary, in consolidating the two divorce actions, the court expressly stated that\nLuckmi's nonsuit did not defeat the agreement. Instead of immediately entering judgment on the\nmediated settlement agreement, however, the trial court reviewed the agreement and concluded\nit was void.\n\n [12] [13] [14] Neither the plain language of the Family Code nor the holding in Alvarez\nforeclose the court's action. First, as noted, sections 6.602 and 153.0071 of the Family Code\nprovide that “a party is entitled to judgment” on a mediated settlement agreement if certain\nrequirements of those statutes are met. Where, as here, the legislature has not defined the terms\nin the statute, we must apply their ordinary meaning. See In re Clark, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1799553\"><a href=\"/opinion/1799553/in-re-clark/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">152</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 156\n(Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1998, orig. proceeding). “Entitle” means in part “to grant a legal\nright to or qualify for.” See BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 553 (7th ed.1999).

It states that the court would likely require an intervention\nto resolve certain issues regarding the second child and that entry of a decree would be delayed,\nand agreed temporary orders entered while these issues were resolved. Thus, the facts of this\ncase establish the trial court's discretion to review the agreement before entering judgment.\nAccordingly, we hold that the trial court did not violate a ministerial duty by refusing to enter\njudgment on the mediated settlement agreement.\n\n\n\n                           Legality of the Mediated Settlement Agreement\n\n [15] [16] [17] [18] Finally, Richard contends the trial court clearly abused its discretion by\nsetting aside the entire mediated settlement agreement on grounds of illegality. “A contract to do\na thing which cannot be performed without violation of the law” violates public policy and is\nvoid.

Because of the presumption in Texas that contracting parties are\nknowledgeable of the law and contract accordingly, courts will generally leave the parties as they\nfind them. See id. Thus, “where the illegality does not appear on the face of the contract, it will not\nbe held void unless facts showing its illegality are before the court.” See Lewis, 199 S.W.2d at 149.\nHere, the trial court concluded from the facts before it that the settlement agreement called for the\nperformance of an illegal act.

PEN.CODE ANN. § 16.02(a)(1) (Vernon 1994) (“ a person\ncommits an offense if he intentionally intercepts ... a wire, oral, or electronic communication”).\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Attorneys\n   to meet, inspect, and destroy all of same. Parties enjoined from disseminating or distributing a\n   copy of tapes or transcripts.\n [19] [20] Taking into account that Shivi and others might urge authorities to bring criminal\ncharges against Richard, the court concluded that this provision illegally required the parties to\ndestroy evidence in a potential criminal proceeding brought at the instance of non-parties to the\nsettlement agreement. 5 *313 Section 37.09(d)(1) of the Penal Code states that “a person commits\nan offense if the person knowing that an offense has been committed, alters, destroys, or conceals\nany record, document or thing with intent to impair its verity, legibility or availability as evidence\nin any subsequent investigation or official proceeding.” TEX. PEN.CODE ANN. § 37.09(d)(1)\n(Vernon Supp.1999) (emphasis added). This statute makes it a crime to alter or destroy evidence of\na crime even before the commencement of a criminal proceeding. Richard argues the provision in\nquestion is legal because it does not require immediate destruction of the tapes and correspondingly\nprohibits dissemination of them. The Penal Code does not provide a time after which a person,\nknowing that an offense has been committed, may legally destroy evidence. Richard contends,\nhowever, that “if they waited until the statute of limitations expired ... the agreement would be\nfully and lawfully performed.” We reject the notion that once the statute of limitations on the state\nwire tap law runs, destruction of the tapes would no longer violate § 37.09(d)(1), and, therefore,\ncould not be characterized as an illegal act. 6 Richard's argument incorrectly assumes that the mere\npassage of time transforms an illegal act into a legal one. The statute of limitations is an affirmative\ndefense; it does not bar prosecution for violation of a statute. See Proctor v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2433594\"><a href=\"/opinion/2433594/proctor-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">967</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">840</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 844 (Tex.Crim.App.1998) (defense created by statute of limitations is forfeited if not asserted\nbefore the guilt/innocence stage of trial). An act prohibited by § 37.09(d)(1) does not magically\nbecome legal upon the expiration of the statute of limitations. While the running of the limitations\nperiod provides the accused with a potential defense to any prosecution for violation of the statute,\nit does not change the nature or character of the act. For this reason, we are unable to find that the\ntrial court committed a clear and prejudicial error of law by declaring the settlement agreement\nillegal and unenforceable based on its finding that the agreement, on its face, called for a violation\nof § 37.09(d)(1).\n\n [21] [22] [23] Nevertheless, Richard argues the court abused its discretion in refusing to\neliminate any illegal provision and enforce the remainder of the settlement agreement.

See Montgomery, 930 S.W.2d at 778. The doctrine of severability\nis an exception that applies in circumstances in which the original consideration for the contract is\nlegal, but incidental promises within the contract are found to be illegal. See id. In such a case, the\ncourt may sever the invalid provision and uphold the valid portion, provided the invalid provision\ndoes not constitute the main or essential purpose of the agreement. See Rogers v. Wolfson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2461590\"><a href=\"/opinion/2461590/rogers-v-wolfson/\"><span class=\"volume\">763</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">922</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 925 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1989, writ denied). Severability of the contract is determined\nby the intent of the parties as evidenced by the language in the contract. See Montgomery, 930\nS.W.2d at 778–79; see also McFarland v. Haby, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1571276\"><a href=\"/opinion/1571276/mcfarland-v-haby/\"><span class=\"volume\">589</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">521</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 524 (Tex.App.—Austin 1979,\nwrit ref'd n.r.e.). The issue is whether the parties would have entered into the agreement absent the\nillegal parts. See Rogers, 763 S.W.2d at 925; see also McFarland, 589 S.W.2d at 524. Therefore,\nwe must determine the central and essential purpose of the settlement agreement.\n\nRichard argues that the resolution of the various issues related to divorce, not the destruction of the\ntapes, was the essential purpose of the settlement agreement. In contrast, Luckmi argues that the\ndestruction *314 of the tapes was the consideration for her release of claims against Richard and,\nthus, was an essential purpose of the agreement. Given the structure of the settlement agreement\nand its interrelated terms and provisions, we cannot say that the trial court acted without reference\nto guiding rules and principles in concluding that the agreement is entire and indivisible. Because\nthe court found part of the consideration for the settlement agreement illegal, it was justified in\nfinding the entire agreement void and unenforceable. Therefore, we find the trial court did not\nabuse its discretion by declaring the entire agreement void and refusing to enforce it.\n\n [24] [25] Lastly, Richard argues that Luckmi is estopped from questioning the agreement's\nvalidity because she accepted a $1000 cash payment under its terms. A void contract cannot be\nrendered enforceable by estoppel. See Reyes v. Storage & Processors, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2463771\"><a href=\"/opinion/2463771/reyes-v-storage-processors-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">722</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 725\nn. 3 (Tex.App.—San Antonio 1999, pet. filed) (holding that employee who accepted benefits of\nvoid agreement limiting worker's compensation benefits was not estopped from complaining about\nagreement). Thus, Luckmi is not estopped from questioning the agreement's validity. Therefore,\nwe find no clear abuse of discretion by the trial court in setting aside the entire agreement.\n\n\n\n                                               Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, we recognize that there are competing public policy interests at stake here.\nOn the one hand, courts are responsible for carrying out this state's policy of encouraging\nthe peaceable resolution of disputes involving the parent-child relationship through voluntary\nsettlement procedures. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. §§ 154.002, 154.003 (Vernon\n1997). On the other hand, public policy prohibits courts from enforcing illegal contracts. See Lewis,\n199 S.W.2d at 151; see also Montgomery, 930 S.W.2d at 778. Here, we are unable to find the\ntrial court violated the public policy encouraging settlements by refusing to enforce a settlement\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Accordingly, because the trial court neither\nviolated a duty imposed by law nor clearly abused its discretion by refusing to enter judgment on\nthe mediated settlement agreement, we deny mandamus relief.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    The copy of the mediated settlement agreement provided by Richard is neither file-stamped nor signed by the court. Nevertheless,\n       the reporter's record from a later hearing establishes that the court signed and approved the agreement.\n2      Luckmi objects to the documents included in the appendix to the petition. These were the only documents provided in support of\n       mandamus relief. A petition for writ of mandamus must contain an appendix, which must include “a certified or sworn copy of any\n       order complained of, or any other document showing the matter complained of.” See TEX.R.APP. P.2.3(j). The orders of which\n       Richard complains are included in the appendix and appear to be signed by the trial court, but are not file-stamped. The verification\n       of Richard's counsel states only “that the pleadings contained in the appendix are true and correct copies.” While the verification\n       makes no mention of “orders, motions or other documents,” we construe “pleadings” in this instance to include all the documents\n       in the appendix.\n3      Spinks v.

See id. at 230.\n4      Luckmi testified that after filing for divorce, she discovered a recording device attached to a phone in the garage of the house where\n       she and Richard lived. She testified that the device also contained a tape of her conversations with others including, her mother,\n       Shivi, and friends. Luckmi testified that she was unaware of the recording device or the tape and that she did not give permission to\n       anyone to record her conversations. Luckmi also testified that when she confronted Richard, he acknowledged installing the device\n       and making the recordings. When Richard was questioned on this topic, his counsel invoked the Fifth Amendment on Richard's\n       behalf and instructed him not to answer.\n5      These non-parties include Shivi. Under the settlement agreement, Richard agreed to release Shivi of all claims, except for child\n       support. However, the release was conditioned on Shivi releasing claims against Richard.\n6      We note that § 37.09(d)(1) applies to the destruction of evidence that might be used in “any subsequent investigation or official\n       proceeding” and is not limited to a violation of the state wire tap laws.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                          © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

We must decide\nwhether any or all of these provisions are unconscionable and, if they are, whether the contract's\nseverability clause preserves the arbitration right. We hold that the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in allowing the arbitrator to assess the unconscionability of the agreement's fee-splitting\nand discovery-limitation provisions as applied in the course of arbitration. We further hold that\nthe arbitration agreement's provisions precluding remedies under the Workers' Compensation Act\nare substantively unconscionable and void under Texas law. However, those provisions are not\nintegral to the parties' overall intended purpose to arbitrate their disputes and, pursuant to the\nagreement's severability clause, are severable from the remainder of the arbitration agreement,\nwhich we conclude is otherwise enforceable. Accordingly, we conditionally grant the petition for\nmandamus.\n\n\n\n                                                       I.

Parties may not use written depositions or requests\nfor admission; the agreement prohibits discovery of either party's financial information except\nfor the employee's earnings if the employee seeks lost wages, back pay, and/or front pay; and all\naspects of the arbitration are deemed confidential. Finally, the arbitrator is stripped of authority to\naward punitive, exemplary, or liquidated damages, or to order reinstatement of employment.\n\nIn December 2002, Luna suffered a work-related neck injury when he accidentally hit his head on\na pipe. Poly–America's company doctor examined Luna and diagnosed him with an acute cervical\nspine flexion injury. Luna subsequently filed a workers' compensation claim and began receiving\nphysical therapy. Approximately two weeks later, Luna returned to work on a release for light\nduty; however, Luna continued to suffer pain and utilized previously scheduled vacation time to\nrecover from his injury. After being warned by the company doctor that he needed to return to\nwork and get off of workers' compensation if he wanted to keep his job, *345 Luna returned to\nwork without restrictions on January 10, 2003. Upon his return, Luna noticed that another person\nwas already being trained for his position, and he claims that his supervisor began to harass him.\nOne month later, Luna told his supervisor that his neck continued to bother him and that he needed\nto return to the company doctor; the next day that Luna was scheduled to work, he was fired.\n\nLuna filed this suit asserting claims for unlawful retaliatory discharge under section 451.001 of the\nLabor Code (“the Workers' Compensation Act”). TEX. LAB.CODE § 451.001–.003. Claiming\nthat Poly–America acted with malice, ill will, spite, or specific intent to cause injury, Luna sought\nboth reinstatement and the imposition of punitive damages. He additionally sought a declaratory\njudgment that the arbitration agreement was unenforceable because, among other reasons, its\nprovisions violated public policy and were unconscionable. Luna submitted two affidavits—his\nown, and that of an expert witness—in support of his claims. Poly–America responded with a\nmotion to compel arbitration which, after a hearing, the trial court granted.\n\nLuna sought a writ of mandamus in the court of appeals, reasserting his argument that provisions\nof the arbitration agreement were substantively unconscionable. The court of appeals held that,\nin light of the fee-splitting provisions and limitations on remedies, the arbitration agreement as a\nwhole was substantively unconscionable. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1369688\"><a href=\"/opinion/1369688/in-re-luna/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 318.

If such review were categorically unavailable and unconscionability\ndeterminations the sole realm of arbitrators, as the dissenting Justice proposes, development of\nthe law as to this threshold issue would be substantially hindered if not precluded altogether.\nNevertheless, federal precedent counsels against granting relief unless the stringent requirements\nfor mandamus are met.

Our own mandamus\nstandard is similar, requiring a demonstration that *347 the trial court clearly abused its discretion\nby failing to correctly analyze or apply the law and a determination that the benefits of mandamus\noutweigh the detriments such that an appellate remedy is inadequate. See In re Prudential Ins.\nCo. of Am., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894594\"><a href=\"/opinion/894594/in-re-prudential-ins-co-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">148</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 135–36 (Tex.2004). Because arbitration is intended to provide a\nlower-cost, expedited means to resolve disputes, mandamus proceedings will often, if not always,\ndeprive the parties of an arbitration agreement's intended benefits when a compel-and-stay order\nis at issue; accordingly, courts should be hesitant to intervene. With these standards in mind, we\nturn to the compel-and-stay order in this case.\n\n\n\n                        III. Unconscionability and the Federal Arbitration Act\n\n [6] [7] Poly–America argues that the FAA's “strong presumption” favoring arbitration applies\nin this case, and furthermore that the FAA preempts all state public-policy grounds for finding\nthe agreement to arbitrate unenforceable. See In re R & R Personnel Specialists of Tyler, Inc.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2183723\"><a href=\"/opinion/2183723/in-re-r-r-personnel-specialists-of-tyler-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">699</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 705 (Tex.App.—Tyler2004) (holding that the FAA preempts “any public policy\nunderlying the Texas workers' compensation statutes that is contrary to the enforceability of\narbitration agreements”). Because neither this presumption nor federal preemption applies in a\nstate court's assessment of whether parties have entered into a valid and enforceable agreement to\narbitrate under state contract law, we disagree.\n\n [8] Section 2 of the FAA provides that arbitration agreements “shall be valid, irrevocable, and\nenforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.”\n9 U.S.C. § 2 (emphasis added). Thus, an agreement to arbitrate is valid under the FAA if it meets\nthe requirements of the general contract law of the applicable state.

A contract is unenforceable if, “given the parties' general\ncommercial background and the commercial needs of the particular trade or case, the clause\ninvolved is so one-sided that it is unconscionable under the circumstances existing when the parties\nmade the contract.” FirstMerit Bank, 52 S.W.3d at 757; see also In re Halliburton Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1768461\"><a href=\"/opinion/1768461/in-re-halliburton-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">566</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 571 (Tex.2002) (“[S]ubstantive unconscionability ... refers to the fairness of the arbitration\nprovision itself.”).

In creating\nthe Texas Workers' Compensation Act, the Legislature carefully balanced competing interests—\nof employees subject to the risk of injury, employers, and insurance carriers—in an attempt to\ndesign a viable compensation system, all within constitutional limitations. See Garcia, 893 S.W.2d\nat 521.

We\nemphasized that participation in the workers' compensation program is voluntary for employers in\nTexas, and that courts are ill equipped to weigh whether a non-subscribing employer's particular\nbenefits plan would undermine the purposes of the Workers' Compensation Act. See id. at 551–\n53. 2 Our decision was specifically tailored to non-subscribing employers who elected not to\nparticipate in the workers' compensation program. Importantly, we distinguished cases involving\ncontracts imposed as a condition of employment, emphasizing that “[t]he distinction between an\nemployment contract that requires a prospective employee, as a condition of the receipt or retention\nof employment, to agree to limit the employer's liability ... and a voluntary occupational insurance\nprogram, in which the employee has the option to enroll ... is decisive.” Lawrence, 44 S.W.3d at\n550 (quoting Brito v.

Fee–Splitting Provision\n\nThe arbitration agreements provide that, in the event of a claim, all fees related to arbitration—\nincluding but not limited to mediation fees, the arbitrators' fees, costs of procuring a location for\na hearing, and court reporter fees—will be split equally between the employer and the employee,\nwith the employee's contribution capped at an amount equal to “the gross compensation earned\nby the Employee in Employee's highest earning month in the twelve months prior to the time\nthe arbitrator issues his award.” The court of appeals held that this provision “weigh[ed] heavily\ntoward a finding of substantive unconscionability.” 175 S.W.3d at 322. Poly–America argues that\nthis was clear error: first, because the court of appeals improperly inferred that Luna could not\nafford likely arbitration costs based solely on subjective evidence and, second, because it failed\nto compare such costs to the *354 expected costs of litigation. 3 Luna responds that it was Poly–\nAmerica that failed to present evidence of the comparative cost of litigation and that the evidence\npresented was sufficient to allow an objective determination that the likely costs of arbitration\nwere beyond Luna's financial means. We begin with the evidentiary challenge.\n\n\n\n                                           1. Evidentiary Challenge\n\n [35] [36] Poly–America claims that the court of appeals, by crediting Luna's factual allegations\nconcerning his financial inability to share arbitration costs, improperly applied a new evidentiary\nstandard that will require all parties seeking to compel arbitration to engage in expensive discovery\nwhenever a resisting party submits cursory and subjective evidence that arbitration costs are\n“unaffordable.” This evidentiary burden, Poly–America argues, is contrary to Texas law and policy\nthat supports summary disposition of motions to compel arbitration. In response, Luna contends\nthe facts upon which the court of appeals relied could have been controverted by affidavit or cross-\nexamination, which Poly–America failed to do; consequently, the court of appeals based its ruling\non the undisputed facts established by Luna's affidavits. Both parties cite Anglin, 842 S.W.2d at\n269, to support their respective positions. There, we defined the proper circumstances under which\na trial court should hold a full evidentiary hearing on a motion to compel arbitration:\n\n            Because the main benefits of arbitration lie in expedited and less expensive\n            disposition of a dispute, and the legislature has mandated that a motion to\n            compel arbitration be decided summarily, we think it unlikely that the legislature\n            intended the issue to be resolved following a full evidentiary hearing in all\n            cases. We also envision that the hearing at which a motion to compel arbitration\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

With these\n            considerations in mind, we hold that the trial court may summarily decide\n            whether to compel arbitration on the basis of affidavits, pleadings, discovery,\n            and stipulations. However, if the material facts necessary to determine the issue\n            are controverted, by an opposing affidavit or otherwise admissible evidence,\n            the trial court must conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine the disputed\n            material facts.\n\nId. Because the only facts Luna presented on the motion to compel were uncontroverted under\nthis standard—Luna's affidavits accompanying his original petition were neither contradicted\nnor challenged in Poly–America's response—we believe the court of appeals acted properly in\ncrediting those facts on appeal.\n\nLuna attached to his original petition his own affidavit and that of an expert witness providing\ndetailed estimates of the likely cost of arbitration in Luna's case, and Luna's expected share\nunder the agreement's capped fee-splitting provision based on his monthly salary (approximately\n$3,300.00) as a Poly–America supervisor. Luna described his anticipated share of the arbitration\ncosts as “way more money than I can afford,” and averred that, if he *355 had to pay such an\namount to have his claim determined, he would be unable to pursue his claim against the company\nunless he could find an attorney willing to pay those fees. Luna recounted that he had attempted\nto retain two attorneys, but they had refused to represent him on a contingent-fee basis because\nof the arbitration agreement.\n\nPoly–America did not dispute these facts but asserted legal arguments in its pleadings that the cost\nprovisions, as written or as applied, were not unconscionable under Texas law. At the hearing on\nits motion to compel, Poly–America again asserted only legal arguments in response to Luna's\nchallenge to the cost-splitting provision. There is no indication in the record that the trial court\ndiscredited or otherwise viewed the facts recited in Luna's affidavits as insufficient; rather, on\nthe basis of Poly–America's legal arguments, the trial court granted the motion to compel. This\ndisposition was consistent with our statements in Anglin in which we indicated that motions to\ncompel should be decided summarily unless disputed issues of fact require a full evidentiary\nhearing. See id.\n\nHowever, the court of appeals clearly differed from the trial court in its view of the law. It held\nthat the trial court's granting of the motion to compel—in light of Luna's averred inability to afford\nhis likely arbitration costs and the agreement's other limitations—was an abuse of discretion.\n175 S.W.3d at 318–20. In doing so, the court of appeals properly credited the undisputed facts\ncontained in Luna's affidavits as to the total expected cost of arbitration and Luna's anticipated\nshare based upon his pre-termination monthly income. Id. at 319–20. Poly–America contends the\ncourt of appeals improperly ruled based on Luna's subjective, and thus practically incontrovertible,\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

However, the court of appeals relied not solely\nupon Luna's belief but upon his and his expert's specific monetary estimates, which provided\nobjective support for Luna's uncontroverted claim that arbitration costs would preclude his pursuit\nof the lawsuit. See 175 S.W.3d at 319. The court of appeals did not, therefore, rely solely on\nsubjective and incontrovertible allegations.\n\n\n\n                            2. Unconscionability of Fee–Splitting Provisions\n\nPoly–America alternatively challenges the court of appeals' conclusion that the agreement's cost-\nallocation provisions favor a finding of unconscionability because the court did not consider the\nrelative costs that Luna would likely incur if the case were litigated in court—costs that, based on\nPoly–America's estimates, would greatly exceed the capped cost of arbitration—and Luna failed\nto provide any evidence of the actual cost of arbitration that he would bear. Although we have\nno doubt that some fee-splitting provisions may operate to discourage employees like Luna from\nseeking vindication of their rights under the Workers' Compensation Act, we must agree with\nPoly–America that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering arbitration in this case.\n\nCourts across the country have universally condemned the use of fee-splitting agreements in\nemployment contracts that have the effect of deterring potential litigants from vindicating their\nstatutory rights in an arbitral forum.

Poly–America\ncounters that litigation costs would be much higher, and therefore the arbitration agreement's\ncapped cost-splitting provision benefits the employee and cannot be unconscionable. It is true\nthat in evaluating the enforceability of fee-splitting provisions, some courts take into account the\nrelative costs of arbitration versus litigation. See, e.g., Bradford, 238 F.3d at 556 n. 5 (focusing\nupon “a claimant's expected or actual arbitration costs and his ability to pay those costs, measured\nagainst a baseline of the claimant's expected costs for litigation and his ability to pay those costs”).\nHowever, at this stage of the proceedings, much of this evidence is necessarily speculative, and\nthus counsels against a court's ex ante interference with arbitration.\n\nWe do not doubt that arbitration costs might be so high in a given case as to preclude access to the\nforum.

The fee-splitting provision in Luna's\narbitration agreement caps his share of costs at “the gross compensation earned by Employee in\nEmployee's highest earning month in the twelve months prior to the time the arbitrator issues\nhis award.” (Emphasis added). Luna, however, presented evidence of his “highest monthly salary\nin the year preceding [his] termination from the company,” a period necessarily earlier than that\nrelevant under the arbitration agreement. The record contains no fact-based estimation of Luna's\nwages in the relevant time period and, thus, no evidence of his likely share of arbitration costs.\n\nJust as we allow litigants who demonstrate an inability to pay costs to proceed with their claims in\ncourt, however, we see nothing that would prevent arbitrators from fairly adjusting employee cost\nprovisions when necessary to allow full vindication of statutory rights in the arbitral forum.

The contract presented in this case specifically provides that the arbitrator\nmay modify unconscionable terms; if the cost provisions precluded Luna's enforcement of his non-\nwaivable statutory rights, they would surely be unconscionable for the reasons we have explained\nand the arbitrator would be free to modify them. The arbitrator is better situated to assess whether\nthe cost provision in this case will hinder effective vindication of Luna's statutory rights and, if so,\nto modify the contract's terms accordingly. See Halliburton, 80 S.W.3d at 572. We conclude the\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to declare the contract's cost-splitting provision\nunconscionable and nullify the arbitration agreement.\n\n\n\n                                           C. Discovery Limitations\n\n [40] The 2002 agreement provides that each party may serve on the other a single set of twenty-\nfive interrogatories (including sub-parts) and one set of twenty-five requests for production or\ninspection of documents or tangible things. Additionally, the agreement includes limitations\nalleged by Luna to be unconscionable: (1) a limitation of each party to a single, six-hour deposition;\n(2) a prohibition on requests for admission; (3) a ban on inquiry into Poly–America's finances; and\n(4) a confidentiality provision requiring confidentiality of the parties and their attorneys regarding\nall aspects of the arbitration. Luna contends these limitations make it virtually impossible for him\nto prove his claim of retaliatory discharge and render the arbitration agreement unconscionable.\n\nAlthough an issue of first impression in this Court, several courts around the country have analyzed\nthe enforceability of similar arbitration provisions limiting parties' access to various forms of\ndiscovery. Applying a rule functionally equivalent to that used to analyze fee-splitting provisions,\nthese courts refuse to enforce such limitations when adequate evidence is presented that a plaintiff's\nability to present his or her claims in an arbitral forum is thereby hindered.

However, because the relevant inquiry depends upon the facts presented in\na given case and the particular discovery limitations' effect upon the relevant statutory regime, we\nare doubtful that courts—assessing claims and discovery limitations before arbitration begins—are\nin the best position to accurately determine which limits on discovery will have such impermissible\neffect.\n\nIn this case, Luna's expert witness testified that in most employment-discharge cases the employer\nonly needs to take the plaintiff's deposition, while the plaintiff generally needs testimony from a\nnumber of witnesses to disprove the employer's likely defense that termination was based on poor\nperformance. Additionally, the expert stated, the employee will likely wish to depose additional\nwitnesses to show a pattern or practice of discrimination, whereas the employer typically has a\nready pool of available employees and managers to assist in preparing for the arbitration. For these\nreasons, the expert concluded, the arbitration agreement's discovery limitations “significantly\nreduce the plaintiff's ability to prevail in arbitration, regardless of how strong a plaintiff's case is\non the merits.”\n\nWe agree that if the discovery limitations the arbitration agreement imposes operate to prevent\neffective presentation of Luna's claim they would be unenforceable. But at this point in the\nproceedings, without knowing what the particular claims and defenses—and the evidence needed\nto prove them—will be, discerning the discovery limitations' potential preclusive effect is largely\nspeculative. The assessment of particular discovery needs in a given case and, in turn, the\nenforceability of limitations thereon, is a determination we believe best suited to the arbitrator\nas the case unfolds.

Thus, the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion.\n\n\n\n                              D. Prohibition on Inquiry into “Good Cause”\n\n [43] Luna claims the arbitration provision that prohibits the arbitrator's ability “to apply a\n‘just cause’ or ‘good cause’ standard to claims relating to Employee's claims concerning his\nemployment or separation therefrom” is substantively unconscionable because it prohibits, in\na retaliatory-discharge case, inquiry into whether the employer had a valid, nondiscriminatory\nreason for firing the employee.

Thus, the prohibition prevents the\narbitrator from substituting a “good cause” requirement for the “at will” standard. The provision\ndoes not, however, prohibit inquiry into whether Poly–America improperly terminated Luna in\nretaliation for his filing of a workers' compensation claim. Because we read the provision merely\nto articulate an accepted rule of employment contracts, and not to restrict a necessary inquiry\ninto the motivations behind Poly–America's termination of Luna in this case, we agree with the\ncourt of appeals that the provision is not unconscionable.

One–Year Limitations Period\n\nThe arbitration agreement includes a clause that requires written notice of a claim to be filed\nwithin a maximum of one year from the events giving rise to an arbitrable claim.

However, as Luna filed this case well within the one-year period and thus suffered no\nprejudice from this provision, it is immaterial to Luna's claims of substantive unconscionability.\n\n\n\n                                            F. Lifetime Application\n\nFinally, Luna argues that the arbitration agreement unconscionably applies even to claims that\nmay arise after Luna's employment with Poly–America has ended and which may have nothing\nto do with Luna's employment. While we can imagine circumstances that might present a closer\nquestion, Luna's claims here concern his employment and termination, the central focus of the\nagreement. We thus agree with the court of appeals that this provision does not render the\narbitration agreement per se unconscionable.

The court of appeals\nagreed with Luna, stating that the fee-splitting and remedies-limitation provisions “together\ndeprive Luna of his opportunity to vindicate his claim in the arbitral forum” and concluding that\n“those provisions are integral to the purpose of the agreement and cannot be severed.” 175 S.W.3d\nat 328. The court of appeals came to this conclusion, it appears, by identifying the fee-splitting\nand remedies-limitation provisions as weighing in favor of unconscionability “as a whole,” but the\ncourt did not identify any particular provision that, by itself, would defeat the agreement's purpose.\nSee id. at 322, 324. We have determined, however, that the remedies-limitation provisions are\nindividually unconscionable and void, and see no reason why they cannot be easily excised from\nthe contract without defeating its underlying purpose.\n\n [45] [46] [47] An illegal or unconscionable provision of a contract may generally be severed\nso long as it does not constitute the essential purpose of the agreement.

See AdvancePCS,\n172 S.W.3d at 608; EZ Pawn Corp., 934 S.W.2d at 90; Cantella & Co., 924 S.W.2d at 944.\n\n\n\n                                                  VII. Conclusion\n\nWe hold invalid, as substantively unconscionable and void, provisions of the parties' *361\ncontract that prohibit the award of punitive damages or reinstatement and thus inhibit effective\nvindication of Luna's retaliatory-discharge claim in an arbitral forum. We further hold that the trial\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in allowing the arbitrator to determine whether the fee-splitting\nagreement and discovery limitations—as applied in the course of arbitration—are unconscionable.\nBecause we find the invalid remedies-limitation provisions severable from the agreement to\narbitrate, which we conclude is otherwise enforceable, the trial court did not abuse its discretion\nin compelling arbitration. Accordingly, we conditionally grant the writ of mandamus.\n\n\n\nJustice BRISTER filed a dissenting opinion.\n\nJustice WILLETT did not participate in the decision.\n\nJustice BRISTER, dissenting.\nThe hard thing about granting mandamus relief is knowing when to stop. This Court has tried\nover the years to set mandamus boundaries through various tests, all of which soon generated\nexceptions, and most of which were met with objections that the “established” boundaries of\nmandamus were being ignored.\n\nOnly two years ago, we held in In re Palacios that mandamus review was available for “orders\nthat deny arbitration, but not orders that compel it.” 1 We noted that this was a reversal of previous\npractice, 2 but was necessitated by the Supreme Court's 2000 opinion in Green Tree Financial\nCorp. v. Randolph, which said that orders compelling arbitration “would not be appealable” unless\nthey included final dismissal of the case. 3 Today the Court comes full circle, saying once again that\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

As a result, reasonable\njudges will sometimes *362 disagree whether mandamus is “prudent” or “appropriate under the\ncircumstances,” and sometimes decide differently in one case than the next. But departing from\nPalacios is neither prudent nor appropriate for at least five reasons.\n\nFirst, Congress amended the Federal Arbitration Act in 1988 so that it “permits immediate appeal\nof orders hostile to arbitration, ... but bars appeal of interlocutory orders favorable to arbitration.” 7\nTexas law is to the same effect. 8 As the trial court's order here was favorable to arbitration, we\nshould defer to the cost-benefit analysis already conducted by the federal and state legislatures. 9\nWe cannot simply substitute mandamus when interlocutory appeal is prohibited without running\ninto serious Supremacy Clause problems; 10 “[f]requent pre-arbitration review would inevitably\nfrustrate Congress's intent to move the parties to an arbitrable dispute out of court and into\narbitration as quickly and easily as possible.” 11\n\nSecond, the trial court ordered these parties to arbitration five years ago. Had mandamus\nproceedings not intervened, this dispute would have long since been concluded. Surely the time\nand expense incurred arbitrating this case would have been less than that incurred in mandamus\nreview. And now that mandamus review is concluded, the parties must go to arbitration anyway.\nGiven our state's strong public policy favoring freedom of contract, 12 claims that a contract is\nunconscionable are asserted far more often than they are sustained. After today's decision, it is\nhard to see how any arbitration cannot be stopped in its tracks by alleging unconscionability.\n\nThird, today's opinion is purely advisory; if an arbitrator ignores it, there is little we can do. Both\nfederal and state law require courts to enforce an arbitrator's decision, no matter what it is, with\nvery few exceptions. 13 The allowable exceptions concern extrinsic or procedural matters like\ncorruption, fraud, or refusing to hear evidence; 14 they do not include (as the Supreme Court just\nheld) disregarding the law, even if a legal error is “manifest.” 15 What is the benefit of mandamus\nreview if the resulting order can be ignored?\n\n *363 Fourth, even if most arbitrators would comply with an appellate court's mandamus rulings,\nissuing them creates a hybrid procedure unknown to the arbitration acts. As already noted, those\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

This also appears to violate the parties' agreement in this case,\nwhich authorized the arbitrator to address unconscionability:\n\n            Should any term of this Agreement be declared illegal, unenforceable, or\n            unconscionable, the remaining terms of the Agreement shall remain in full\n            force and effect. To the extent possible, both Employee and Company desire\n            that the Arbitrator modify the term(s) declared to be illegal, unenforceable, or\n            unconscionable in such a way as to retain the intended meaning of the term(s)\n            as closely as possible.\n\nTelling the arbitrators in advance what legal rulings they should make (as the Court does today)\nis an improper way to circumvent these restrictions.\n\nFifth and finally, the Court decides an important question in the abstract that the arbitration may\nrender moot. The Court concedes that unconscionability of the fee-splitting and discovery-limiting\nclauses should be deferred to the arbitrator. But unconscionability of the remedy-stripping clause\nis just as fact-based, and just as speculative until all the facts are arbitrated. The fairness of such\nclauses is not as one-sided as the Court suggests; many employees might actually prefer cash for\nlost wages (and no appellate delays) rather than reinstatement or a long shot at punitive damages.\nAs the Court notes, several courts have held that such “limitations of remedies are permissible.” 16\nTwice in 2003 the Supreme Court declined to hold that a remedy-stripping arbitration clause\nviolates the FAA—each time deferring the question until after arbitrators had addressed it. 17 We\nshould do the same here.\n\nWe have never held (as the Court holds repeatedly today) that an arbitration agreement is invalid\nunless an employee can “effectively vindicate his statutory rights.” 18 We did not say so in In re\nHalliburton Co. (as the Court's citations aver), where that phrase appears only in a parenthetical\ndescribing an opinion by an intermediate appellate court in Michigan, an opinion we neither\napproved nor adopted. 19 Nor does the Court's judgment comply with this new standard. Despite\nthe remedy limits imposed here, an arbitrator could still award Johnny Luna 50 years of future lost\nwages, which would certainly seem to “effectively vindicate his statutory rights.” Even more than\nthe fee-splitting or discovery-limiting provisions, it is simply too early to tell whether the remedy-\nstripping provisions will be unfair to Luna at all.\n\nSuch an important and controversial question should not be decided in such an offhanded and\nabstract way. We should instead wait to see whether the arbitration *364 award makes such a\ndecision necessary; “if it is not necessary to decide more, it is necessary not to decide more.” 20\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Of the five cases cited, three predated Green Tree, 22 and a fourth did not\ninvolve a trial court order favorable to arbitration. 23 The single case granting mandamus relief\nfrom an order favorable to arbitration was by the Ninth Circuit, the court widely recognized as the\n“most hostile,” 24 “far to the left of center,” 25 and “renegade” court in the country in employment\narbitration cases. 26 Even so, mandamus was granted in that case only because arbitrating the\nsingle class representative's case could moot the class action he had brought, wiping it out without\nappellate review. 27 In short, there is no “broad” consensus for doing precisely the opposite of\nwhat Congress and the Texas Legislature intended.\n\n*365 It is certainly true that leaving matters like unconscionability to arbitrators will mean\ndevelopment of the law is “substantially hindered,” 28 but the same could be said of arbitration\nin all cases. It is hard to see the allure of a system in which decision-makers can ignore the law,\nunless of course one is planning to ignore the law oneself. Based on its popularity, few arbitrators\napparently go that far. But even carefully selected judges and jurors make mistakes, and carefully\nselected arbitrators are surely no less fallible. Nevertheless, these are policy matters that only\nCongress can address or amend; we cannot disregard the express legislative limits on interlocutory\nreview merely by calling it mandamus when we think the questions are important and the issues\nwell-briefed.\n\nWhile appeal from arbitration awards is very limited, that appeal is an adequate remedy unless the\nbenefits of mandamus outweigh the costs. 29 Considering the costs expended so far, I doubt Johnny\nLuna would consider them outweighed by getting the right to seek reinstatement in arbitration\n(which employees rarely request) and punitive damages (which they rarely get). Accordingly, I\nagree with the Court that the court of appeals erred in reviewing and reversing the trial court's\norder compelling arbitration. But I disagree that we have any place reviewing those matters either.\nTo that extent, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\nParallel Citations\n\n156 Lab.Cas.

In the suit, Khan sought damages pursuant to the lease's holdover provision,\ncontending that Meknojiya became a holdover tenant as a result of Khan's termination of the\nlease. Meknojiya moved for summary judgment on the sole ground that Khan's recovery under the\nholdover provision is barred as a matter of law because it represents an unenforceable penalty in\nthe form of “double-rent.” The trial court granted partial summary judgment in favor of Meknojiya,\nand following a bench trial only on attorney's fees, the court rendered a final judgment that Khan\ntake nothing on his claims and that Meknojiya recover attorney's fees. Because we conclude that\nthe holdover provision is not an unenforceable penalty, we reverse the trial court's judgment and\nremand the case for further proceedings.\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In 1996, Khan and Meknojiya entered\ninto a written lease agreement, and Meknojiya began operating a convenience store on the leased\npremises. The parties renegotiated their lease (“the lease”) in March 2002. The renegotiated lease\nrequired Meknojiya to pay $4,500 per month in “base rent” and included the following paragraph,\nwhich the parties refer to as a “holdover provision”:\n\n           2.07 Holding Over.If Tenant does not vacate the Leased Premises upon the\n           expiration or earlier termination of the Lease, Tenant shall be a tenant at\n           sufferance for the holdover period and all of the terms and provisions of this\n           Lease shall be applicable during that period, except that Tenant shall pay\n           Landlord (in addition to additional rent payable under this Lease and any other\n           sums payable under this Lease) as base rental for the period of such holdover\n           an amount equal to two times the base rent which would have been payable by\n           Tenant had the holdover period been a part of the original terms of the Lease\n           (without waiver of Landlord's right to recover damages as permitted by law).\n\nAccording to Khan, Meknojiya committed a series of breaches following execution of the 2002\nlease. For instance, Khan contends that Meknojiya (1) failed to obtain or renew required insurance,\n(2) failed to provide the required insurance documentation, and (3) permitted a corporation owned\nby other individuals to operate the convenience store without obtaining Khan's prior written\nconsent. Khan notified Meknojiya in writing, through counsel, that Meknojiya was in default of\nthe lease and that Khan was exercising his option to terminate the lease effective May 1, 2002.\nNevertheless, despite additional notices of default, Meknojiya continued to occupy the premises\nand to pay $4,500 per month until January 2, 2007, the date the lease was set to have expired by\nits own terms.\n\nKhan subsequently sued Meknojiya for breach of the lease, asserting that upon Meknojiya's breach\nof the lease and Khan's notification that the lease was terminated, Meknojiya occupied the property\nas a tenant at sufferance.

After conducting a\nhearing, the trial court granted Meknojiya's motion for summary judgment but denied Khan's\nmotion. Following a bench trial on Meknojiya's remaining counterclaim for attorney's fees, the trial\ncourt rendered a final judgment incorporating the trial court's order granting summary judgment\nin favor of Meknojiya and ordering Khan to pay $60,191.71 in attorney's fees. 2 In three issues on\nappeal, Khan argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Meknojiya\nand consequently, in awarding Meknojiya attorney's fees as the prevailing party.\n\n\n\n                                       STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nWe review a trial court's ruling on summary judgment de novo.

Accordingly, a liquidated-\ndamages provision is not enforceable if, in effect, it is a penalty. See id.(“Whether a contractual\nprovision is an enforceable liquidated damages provision or an unenforceable penalty is a question\nof law for the court to decide.”). A liquidated-damages provision is enforceable only if a court\nfinds that (1) the harm caused by the breach is incapable or difficult of estimation, and (2) the\namount of liquidated damages called for is a reasonable forecast of just compensation.Id. Whether\na liquidated-damages provision is an unenforceable penalty is a question of law for the court,\nalthough sometimes factual issues must be resolved before the court can decide the legal question.\nId.\n\nIn his first and second issues on appeal, Khan argues that the trial court erred in granting\nMeknojiya's summary-judgment motion because Meknojiya failed to conclusively establish the\nessential elements of his affirmative defense of penalty. Specifically, Khan argues that, as a matter\nof law, paragraph 2.07 is not an unenforceable penalty provision because it is not a liquidated-\ndamages provision at all. Instead, according to Khan, paragraph 2.07 simply sets forth the parties'\nagreed rental rate for any holdover period. Based on the unambiguous language of the lease, we\nagree.\n\nWhether a contract term is a liquidated-damages provision is a question of law for the court.\nValence Operating Co., 164 S.W.3d. at 644. “The term ‘liquidated damages' ordinarily refers to\nan acceptable measure of damages that parties stipulate in advance will be assessed in the event\nof a contract breach.”Flores v.

Here,\nparagraph 2.07 sets an agreed-upon rental rate for situations in which the tenant has failed to\nsurrender the leased premises upon expiration of the lease term or earlier termination by one of the\nparties. The provision itself describes the amount due during the holdover period as “base rental for\nthe period of such holdover.”Further, paragraph 2.07 states that payment of such rental amounts\ndo not waive the landlord's right to recover “damages as permitted by law.” In other words, based\non the plain language of the lease, there is no indication that the parties intended the amounts owed\nunder paragraph 2.07 as a means of forecasting damages in the event of a breach. And, while rent\nunder paragraph 2.07 may, in certain circumstances, form the basis of measuring damages, it does\nnot independently set a damages amount or attempt to calculate damages. Simply put, any amount\nowed under paragraph 2.07 does not equate to a stipulated measure of damages; rather, it is an\nagreed-upon rental amount that is due under particular circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

LHO Fin.\nP'ship I, L.P., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1760250\"><a href=\"/opinion/1760250/meridien-hotels-inc-v-lho-financing-partnership-i/\"><span class=\"volume\">255</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">807</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.App.-Dallas 2008, no pet.). In Meridien Hotels, the landlord\nleased hotel space to the tenant under a lease that required the tenant to pay 1.5 times the base\nrental amount if the tenant remained in the space upon termination of the lease by one of the parties\nor the lease term's expiration. 3 Id. at 822.The landlord sent the tenant a notice of termination of\nthe lease, but the tenant remained in the hotel space anyway. Id. at 814.The landlord eventually\nsued the tenant, seeking multiple types and amounts of damages, including $2,130,136 in holdover\nrent, plus prejudgment interest, all of which the trial court awarded. Id.\n\n *4 The tenant appealed, claiming that the holdover rent provision was an unlawful penalty and\nthat, as a result, the trial court erred in awarding pre-judgment interest on that amount. Id. at\n822.Concluding that the holdover rental rate did not constitute a penalty, the court of appeals\nconcluded that the provision “does not punish appellants; it instead requires that if appellants make\nthe decision to hold over beyond the term of the lease, they must pay a higher rate for doing so.\nAppellants were on notice that [the landlord] considered the lease terminated, yet they chose to\nstay, having agreed in the lease to pay 1.5 times the usual rent for doing so.”Id.\n\nLikewise, in this case, paragraph 2.07 of the parties' lease agreement sets out in advance the rent to\nbe paid should the tenant choose to remain on the premises after one of the parties terminates the\nlease or the lease expires by its own terms, creating a tenancy at sufferance. Upon expiration or\ntermination of the lease, the tenant must decide whether to (1) leave the leased premises (assuming\nhe is not forcibly removed) or (2) hold over under the lease as a tenant at sufferance and pay\nadditional rent at the agreed holdover rate. Such additional rent is not a penalty; in fact, it does\nnot represent liquidated damages at all. Rather, the additional rent is the agreed-to, bargained-for\namount of rent due and owing in the event of a holdover. 4\n\nBecause paragraph 2.07 of the parties' lease agreement is not a liquidated-damages provision, it\ncannot be an unenforceable penalty, as a matter of law. We therefore conclude that the trial court\nerred in granting summary judgment in favor of Meknojiya on this ground. In addition, because\nMeknojiya should not have prevailed on summary judgment, it follows that he was not entitled to\nattorney's fees. We sustain appellant's first and second issues on appeal. 5\n\n\n\n                                               CONCLUSION\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Phillips, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">820</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">785</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.1991), for the proposition that a contractual provision in which one\n        party agrees to pay the other some multiple of damages is an unenforceable penalty. Phillips is a classic illustration of a liquidated-\n        damages provision that constitutes an unlawful penalty. In the midst of divorce proceedings, a husband and wife agreed to create\n        a limited partnership rather than divide their substantial assets. Id. at 786–87.The agreement contained the following provision: “If\n        the general partner breaches his trust hereunder, he shall pay to the limited partner as liquidated damages ten times the amount she\n        loses as a result of such breaches of trust.”Id. at 787.In other words, once actual damages were established for breach of the parties'\n        contract, they would be multiplied by ten to reach the damages award. Id. at 789.The supreme court held that this provision was an\n        unenforceable penalty provision, rather than an enforceable liquidated damages provision. Id.\n           Meknojiya's reliance on Phillips in this case is misplaced. First, unlike paragraph 2.07, the provision at issue in Phillips was\n           undisputedly a liquidated-damages provision. As previously discussed, paragraph 2.07 is not a liquidated-damages provision at\n           all, but instead is a rental amount that is triggered if and when the lease expires or is terminated. Second, the liquidated-damages\n           provision at issue in Phillips was an unenforceable penalty on its face because the amount awarded by the provision was computed\n           by multiplying actual damages (once established).See id. at 789.Here, paragraph 2.07 does not require a separate determination of\n           damages or the application of any multiplier to that amount. Thus, even if we were to conclude that paragraph 2.07 is a liquidated-\n           damages provision, unlike the court in Phillips we could not conclude that it constitutes a penalty on its face.\n5       In his third issue on appeal, Khan argues that, even if the double-rent rate set forth in paragraph 2.07 represents liquidated damages,\n        Meknojiya failed to satisfy his burden to establish that it is an unenforceable penalty. Having sustained Khan's first and second issues\n        on appeal, we do not address this issue.

In 1993 Oyster subleased one restaurant space\nto Waterfront. At that time Oyster was subleasing the other space to Stillwater, Inc. (“Stillwater”),\nwhich was operating a restaurant known as “The Lodge at Lakeview” in the subleased space.\nUnder the terms of the sublease contract, Stillwater could not assign its interest in the sublease\nwithout Oyster's consent. In its subleased space, Waterfront began operating a restaurant called\n“Chuy's Hula Hut.” Waterfront's sublease provides that the restaurant in the other space must be\n“of substantially different character” from the Hula Hut. Waterfront describes the Hula Hut as\n“nautically-themed.”\n\nLandry's operates a chain of restaurants known as “Joe's Crab Shack.” In 1996 Landry's began\nnegotiations with Stillwater to assume Stillwater's sublease and operate a Joe's Crab Shack\nrestaurant in the space occupied by The Lodge at Lakeview. Waterfront learned of Landry's plan\nand voiced its objection to Oyster that a Joe's Crab Shack restaurant would not be “of substantially\ndifferent character” from the Hula Hut. The sublease between Waterfront and Oyster included an\narbitration clause, and the two parties entered into arbitration. The arbitrators issued a decision in\nMay 1997, which found that Joe's Crab Shack was not “of substantially different character” from\nthe Hula Hut. Landry's did not participate in the arbitration and apparently was not invited to do\nso. As a result, Oyster declined to approve Stillwater's assignment of its sublease to Landry's.\n\nIn June 1997 Landry's brought this suit against Waterfront and Oyster for “tortiously interfer[ing]\nwith the contractual relationship between it and Stillwater,” “maliciously [and] intentionally\ninterfering with and preventing [a] business relationship [with Stillwater] from occurring and\ncontinuing,” acting in a “conspiracy to tortiously interfere with a contract and a business\nrelationship,” and entering “into a combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade.” Landry's also\nfiled suit against Stillwater. Waterfront filed a traditional motion for summary judgment. See\nTex.R. Civ. P. 166a(b). Landry's did not respond. The district court granted Waterfront's motion\nand severed Landry's claims against Waterfront from those against Oyster and Stillwater. The\ncourt denied Landry's motion for new trial. By five issues, Landry's appeals the district court's\nsummary judgment in favor of Waterfront and the court's denial of Landry's motion for new trial.\n\n\n\n                                                 DISCUSSION\n\nSummary Judgment\n [1] [2] [3] Summary judgments must stand on their own merits.

Waterfront relies on Texas\nBeef Cattle, which established that the defense of justification is based on either the exercise of (1)\none's own legal rights or (2) a good-faith claim to a colorable legal right, even though that claim\nultimately proves to be mistaken. See id. at 211. Waterfront does not dispute that it provided no\nevidence that its actions were done in good faith; therefore, to have prevailed on this defense, it\nmust have conclusively proved that it was exercising its own legal right. If the trial court found as\na matter of law that the defendant, in exercising a legal right, interfered with a contract, then the\ndefendant has conclusively established the justification defense. Id. Waterfront asserts that it was\nexercising a right provided it under its sublease with Oyster. The sublease states that Oyster will\nonly lease the adjoining space to a restaurant of substantially different character and provides for\narbitration between Oyster and Waterfront in the event of a sublease dispute.\n\nLandry's counters that a party seeking summary judgment on the affirmative defense of\njustification must conclusively prove that (1) “the acts of interference were not in themselves\ntortious and or unlawful,” (2) “the acts of interference were consistent with protecting the right\nat issue,” and (3) “the contractual right to interfere exists as a matter of law pursuant to an\nunambiguous contract.” Landry's relies on Prudential Insurance Co. of America v.

In Financial Review Services, the supreme\ncourt observed that an otherwise legitimate privilege may not be exercised by resorting to illegal\nor tortious means, and that a defendant, under the guise of exercising a privilege, may not say\nor do whatever it sees fit. Id. at 81. Thus, Landry's concludes, “The obvious and fatal flaw in\nWaterfront's summary judgment motion was that it filed no evidence whatsoever as to its own\nacts of interference. Without such evidence it could not conclusively establish that those acts were\nlawful and consistent with the right being asserted.”\n\nHowever Financial Review Services does not relieve Landry's of pleading acts by Waterfront that\nconstitute tortious interference.\n\n   Generally, justification is established as a matter of law when the acts the plaintiff complains\n   of as tortious interference are merely the defendant's exercise of its own contractual rights.\n\n   ... Thus, if the plaintiff pleads and proves methods of interference that are tortious in themselves,\n   then the issue of privilege or justification never arises.\n\nId. (emphasis added). Landry's has failed to make any specific allegation as to what actions\nWaterfront took that interfered with its business and contractual relations.

This is the only evidence in the record of any actions on the\npart of Waterfront. In Financial Review Services, Financial Review Services' (“FRS”) pleadings\ndisclosed no fewer than five specific factual allegations of how Prudential disparaged FRS and\ninterfered with its contracts and business relations. Financial Review Servs., 29 S.W.3d at 81. “To\nraise an issue of whether Prudential interfered with FRS's contract by tortiously disparaging FRS,\nthere must be evidence that Prudential made statements rising to the level of trade disparagement.\nTo do so, FRS must first present evidence that Prudential made false statements of fact about\nFRS.” Id. at 82 (emphasis added) (citing Hurlbut v.

Bryant's affidavit and attached\nmemorandum reflect that Waterfront and Oyster arbitrated the question of whether a Joe's Crab\nShack restaurant would be substantially different in character from the Hula Hut. Outside of its\nformal preface and conclusion, Bryant's affidavit states:\n\n   “My name is William C. Bryant.

Waterfront provided evidence as to the decor and atmosphere of the two restaurants, elements\nthat we have determined were intended in the sublease's use of “character.” The arbitrators'\nmemorandum, in the absence of any controverting evidence, establishes that the Hula Hut and\nLandry's Crab Shack were not substantially different in character.\n\nWe hold that the uncontroverted summary-judgment proof conclusively establishes *552 that\nWaterfront's alleged actions were done in the exercise of its own legal right provided by its sublease\nwith Oyster. We overrule Landry's first three issues.\n\n\nMotion for New Trial\nBy its last two issues, Landry's complains that the district court erred in denying its motion for new\ntrial. Landry's claims that the district court treated Waterfront's motion for summary judgment as a\nno-evidence summary judgment. See Tex.R. Civ. P. 166a(i). Landry's continues that because it had\nno notice that Waterfront was seeking a no-evidence summary judgment, the summary judgment\ngranted by the district court was a default summary judgment. Landry's contentions are without\nmerit because Waterfront established its right to a traditional summary judgment as a matter of law\nby proving its affirmative defense of justification. Waterfront was not seeking, nor was it granted,\na no-evidence summary judgment. We overrule Landry's final two issues.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Gove ed., 1986).\n5       The memorandum provides, in pertinent part, the following:\n             We have been asked to decide the following question:\n                           “Is a Joe's Crab Shack restaurant substantially different in character from the Chuy's Hula Hut restaurant\n                           presently operated by Waterfront at [Oyster Landing]?”\n             It is our decision that the answer to that question is no. To the contrary, it is our opinion that a Joe's Crab Shack restaurant is\n             substantially similar in character to the Chuy's Hula Hut restaurant presently operated by Waterfront at the Facility.\n             The requirements in Section 4.2 of the Oyster–Waterfront sublease that the restaurants be of substantially different characters is\n             separate and independent from the requirement that they offer substantially different menus. We do not believe the [sub]lease\n             should be interpreted to make superfluous the requirement of substantially different characters. In addition, the requirement is\n             not just that the restaurants be of different characters but that they be of substantially different characters.\n             We view the requirement of substantially different characters to require the restaurants to have substantially different\n             characteristics, distinguishments, structures, functions and qualities—not just menu items. In that regard Hula Hut is described\n             by its owner as a typical beach hut, surf shack or old wharf boat house typical along sea coasts everywhere. The building is\n             built out of salvaged lumber and old boats, motors, surfboards, fishing nets, wooden fish and pictures of Hawaiian scenes are\n             randomly hung or placed within the restaurant.\n             Landry's Seafood Restaurant, Inc.'s Form 10K describes the character of a Joe's Crab Shack as “an old fishing camp with a\n             wood facade, tin roof and a raised outside deck. The Crab Shack restaurants feature a casual, nautical theme ...” Various articles\n             describe Joe's Crab Shack as having fish nets, sea shells, and other fake bounty from the sea, and a weatherbeaten facade giving\n             the impression of a Gulf fishing camp. Apart from menu, the characteristics of the two restaurants appear nearly identical.\n             Photographs that have been supplied to us also indicate that the characters appear to be very similar and not of a substantially\n             different nature.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                            © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The\nCommissioner of Insurance became concerned that LHR Enterprises, Inc.; Transglobal Mortgage,\nInc.; Business Staffing, Inc.; Task Services, Inc.; Rick Chapman; and Harry Sewill (cumulatively\n“the appellants”) were engaged in the unauthorized practice of insurance and referred the matter\nto the State Office of Administrative Hearings (“SOAH”).

Shortly thereafter, the\nCommissioner and the Department filed a plea to the jurisdiction contending that the district court\ndid not have jurisdiction over the case because the appellants had failed to show a valid waiver of\nsovereign immunity. The district court granted the plea, and the appellants appealed the judgment\nof the district court. We will dismiss this case for want of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n                                               BACKGROUND\n\nProceedings Before SOAH\nThe case presently before us is related to another case involving the appeal of an administrative\norder. Because it is helpful in explaining the outcome of this appeal, we will briefly review some\nof the facts of the related case.\n\nIn 2004, the staff of the Department of Insurance (“Staff”) became concerned that several\ncompanies and individuals, including the appellants, were engaged in the unauthorized business\nof insurance. SeeTex. Ins.Code Ann. §§ 101.051 (specifying what constitutes business of\ninsurance), .102 (prohibiting unauthorized business of insurance) (West Supp.2006). In particular,\nthe Staff believed that the appellants and others were improperly engaged in the business of\nproviding various companies' employees with workers' compensation insurance coverage.\n\nAfter formalizing their concerns, the Staff filed a report with the Commissioner that detailed the\nallegations against the appellants and others. The report also contained the Staff's recommendation\nthat the Commissioner order that all the parties investigated (1) be held jointly and severally liable\nfor any unpaid workers' compensation claims, (2) pay monetary penalties, and (3) cease practicing\nthe business of insurance in Texas. See id. §§ 84.041 (providing that if Staff determines that\ninsurance violations have occurred, they have the authority to file report with Commissioner that\nspecifies facts forming basis of their conclusion and also specifies any penalty that they feel should\nbe imposed), .021 (West Supp.2006) (authorizing Commissioner to impose penalty on individual\nwho violates insurance law, rule, or order).\n\nIn July 2004, the Commissioner referred the matter to SOAH for a contested-case hearing\nto determine whether the appellants and others had engaged in the unauthorized business of\ninsurance and whether a cease-and-desist order prohibiting the parties from engaging in the\nallegedly improper actions should be issued. See, e.g., id. §§ 31.021(a) (requiring Commissioner\nto “administer and enforce” insurance code), 40.002 (requiring SOAH to conduct hearing when\nrequired under insurance code), 101.151 (West Supp.2006) (authorizing Commissioner to set\nhearing to determine whether cease-and-desist order should be imposed if, among other things,\nCommissioner has reason to believe that individual has violated insurance provision or rule).\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The administrative law judge overseeing the\ncase denied the motions, and the investigated parties appealed the administrative law judge's\nruling to the Commissioner. The Commissioner denied the appeal. Subsequently, a hearing was\nscheduled before SOAH.\n\n\nDeclaratory-Judgment Action\nSoon after the Commissioner requested a hearing before SOAH, the appellants filed a petition for\ndeclaratory relief in the district court. SeeTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. §§ 37.001-.011 (West\n1997 & Supp.2006) (Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act). The propriety of the district court's\njudgment is the subject of this appeal.\n\nIn their petition, the appellants sought, among other things, a declaration that the Commissioner\ndid not have the authority to require a hearing before SOAH. Specifically, they sought a declaration\nthat the Commissioner has no authority to require a hearing or impose administrative penalties on\nindividuals that are neither licensed to engage in the business of insurance nor regulated by the\ninsurance code. SeeTex. Ins.Code Ann. § 84.021 (West Supp.2006) (authorizing Commissioner\nto impose administrative penalties on individuals who are “licensed or regulated” under insurance\ncode or another Texas insurance law).\n\nIn addition, the appellants also sought a declaration that the Commissioner may not refer a matter\nto SOAH for a determination of whether a cease-and-desist order should be issued to stop an\nindividual from engaging in certain activities when the statutory time for requesting a hearing\nhas expired. See id. §§ 101.151(a) (authorizing Commissioner to set hearing concerning issuance\nof cease-and-desist order and specifying that Commissioner is required to provide notice of\nhearing), .152 (providing that unless parties agree otherwise, hearing must be held “not earlier than\nthe fifth day or later than the 30th day after” notice was given), .153 (West Supp.2006) (allowing\nCommissioner to issue cease-and-desist order after hearing has been held).\n\nIn response to the appellants' petition, the Commissioner and the Department filed a plea to the\njurisdiction. In their plea, they argued that because this case is essentially a suit against state\nagencies, the appellants had the burden of proving a waiver of sovereign immunity. Further, the\nCommissioner and the Department contended that because the appellants failed to plead and prove\na waiver, the district court did not have jurisdiction over the appellants' claims.\n\nUltimately, the district court granted the plea to the jurisdiction, and the appellants appeal the\ndistrict court's judgment.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

First, they argue that the district court erred when it\ngranted the plea to the jurisdiction. Specifically, they contend that their suit does not implicate\nsovereign immunity because it seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against state officials acting\nbeyond their statutory authority. See Texas Natural Res. Comm'n v. IT-Davy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1383975\"><a href=\"/opinion/1383975/texas-natural-resource-conserv-v-it-davy/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">849</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 855\n(Tex.2002) (explaining that “[p]rivate parties may seek declaratory relief against state officials\nwho allegedly act without legal or statutory authority” but that “such suits are not ‘suits against\nthe State’ ... because suits to compel state officers to act within their official capacity do not\nattempt to subject the State to liability” and, therefore, “do not implicate the sovereign-immunity\ndoctrine” (citation omitted)). Second, the appellants argue that the district court erred by failing to\ndeclare that the Commissioner does not have the authority to impose administrative penalties on\nindividuals who are not licensed or regulated under the provisions of the insurance code. Finally,\nthe appellants insist that the district court erred when it failed to declare that the Commissioner\nmay not refer a matter to SOAH for a hearing if the referral is not made within the time allowed\nby statute.\n\n *3 After the appellants filed this appeal, the SOAH hearing for determining whether the appellants\nand the other investigated parties had engaged in the unauthorized practice of insurance was held.\nAfter the hearing concluded, the Commissioner issued a final order, which specified that none of\nthe appellants had violated any insurance provision or regulation and that, accordingly, no sanction\nor penalty should be imposed upon them. Shortly thereafter, the Commissioner and the Department\nfiled a motion to dismiss this appeal. 1 In their motion, the Commissioner and the Department\nargue that because a final order has been issued absolving the appellants of any wrongdoing, this\nCourt no longer has subject-matter jurisdiction over the appellants' declaratory claims. Because\nour resolution of the motion to dismiss is dispositive of this appeal, we will now turn to the various\narguments made by the parties regarding the motion to dismiss.\n\nThe appellants seek relief under the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act. SeeTex. Civ. Prac. &\nRem.Code Ann. § 37.001-.011. The Act allows an individual “whose rights, status, or other legal\nrelations are affected by a statute” to “have determined any question of construction or validity\narising under the ... statute ... and obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other legal relations\nthereunder.”Id. § 37.04(a) (West 1997). In this case, the appellants seek declarations concerning\nthe authority of the Commissioner. This Court has previously recognized that individuals may\nrequest declaratory relief regarding whether state agencies or officers have acted beyond their\nstatutory authorities. See, e.g., Texas Dep't of Ins., Div. of Workers' Comp. v. Lumbermens Mut.\nCas. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2193070\"><a href=\"/opinion/2193070/texas-dept-ins-v-lumbermens-mut-cas/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">870</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 874-75 (Tex.App.-Austin 2006, pet. denied) (holding that claimant\nmay seek declaration that agency's issuance of advisories was outside agency's statutory authority).\nHowever, while individuals may employ the Act to challenge actions as beyond an agency's or\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The appellants pled the following, relevant\njurisdictional facts as the basis for their suit:\n\n    *5 On June 24, 2004, pursuant to section 84.041 of the insurance code, the Staff delivered to\n   the Commissioner a report “in which it alleged that these Plaintiffs engaged in activities in the\n   State of Texas in violation of the Texas Insurance Code, and recommended that administrative\n   penalties be assessed against them in the aggregate amount of $2,000,000.”\n\n            “[T]he Staff, on July 16, 2004, filed with SOAH and served on these Plaintiffs\n            a Notice of Hearing, thereby initiating a contested case ... [which] was assigned\n            Docket No. 454-4-75940H.”\n\n   The pleadings then recount that the appellants filed a plea to the jurisdiction and general denial\n   in the SOAH proceeding, that the Staff filed a response asserting various statutory bases for\n   jurisdiction, that the administrative law judge denied the appellant's plea to the jurisdiction and\n   summary disposition motion, and that they appealed the decision to the Commissioner, who\n   upheld it.\n\n   The appellants pled that they “have not and will not voluntarily subject themselves to the\n   [Department]'s jurisdiction” and sought a declaration that “the Commissioner as a matter of law\n   does not have jurisdiction over the Plaintiffs to take the action contemplated by the July 16,\n   2004 Notice of Hearing.”\n\nSubsequently, as previously discussed, the Commissioner issued a final order in the complained-\nof contested-case proceeding. The Commissioner's order concluded that none of the appellants\nwere engaged in the unauthorized practice of insurance or had violated any insurance provisions\nor regulations and that, therefore, no penalty should be imposed upon the appellants. As the State\nargues, these developments resolve the controversy on which Appellants' suit is based, i.e., the\nsubject matter of the July 16, 2004 Notice of Hearing has been resolved in Appellants' favor.\n\nAppellants nonetheless urge that a justiciable controversy remains because the Commissioner's\norder states a conclusion of law that, “Under Tex. Ins.Code § 84.021, the Commission may impose\nan administrative penalty on a person, including an entity, that is licensed or regulated under and\nwho violates the Insurance Code or rules adopted or orders issued thereunder.”However, absent\nanother impending hearing or other action by the Department adversely impacting the appellants\nin some concrete way, the Commissioner's legal conclusion amounts to a bare, abstract statement\nof legal opinion, and any judicial determination regarding the conclusion would necessarily be\nno more than a mere abstract advisory opinion.

We will\naffirm.\n\nCintas Corporation is a national company that rents uniforms, towels and mats to businesses on a\nweekly basis. Murphy owns and *665 operates an Exxon and Chevron service station in Tyler,\nTexas. From 1988 until 1991, Murphy and Cintas entered into a series of contracts to rent uniforms.\nInitially, Cintas filed suit against Murphy alleging that he had failed to pay in accordance with their\nagreements which resulted in $8,724.59 in damages. As exhibits to its petition, Cintas attached the\ncontracts, the invoices and Cintas's affidavit stating that the claim against Murphy was just and\ntrue, that it was due, and that all just and lawful credit had been allowed. TEX.R.CIV.P. 185.\n\nMurphy answered by an unsworn denial, but alleged that Cintas “fail[ed] to furnish clean, high\nquality garments and fail[ed] to replace torn, damaged and worn garments when requested.”\nMurphy also alleged that Cintas was not entitled to recover liquidated damages because the\nliquidated damage provision was an unenforceable penalty. After a non-jury hearing, the court\nrendered judgment in favor of Cintas. Neither party requested findings of fact and conclusions\nof law.\n\nIn points one, two, three, four, five, six and eight, Murphy challenges the legal sufficiency of the\nevidence to support the court's award of liquidated damages. According to Murphy, the record\nis void of any evidence regarding the amount of monetary loss that Cintas actually suffered as a\nresult of the breach or the reasonableness of the liquidated damage provision. He also argues that\nthe record is void of any evidence that the amount of liquidated damages was a reasonable forecast\nof just compensation. Therefore, Murphy concludes that the court erred when it awarded damages\nin accordance with the liquidated damage provision of the contract rather than awarding damages\nin accordance with common law contract law. We do not agree.\n\n [1] [2] [3] When findings and conclusions are neither requested nor filed, the trial court is\npresumed to have made all of the findings necessary to support its judgment.

Murphy also contends that the harm caused by the breach\nmust not be capable of estimation or difficult to estimate to be an enforceable liquidated damage\nstipulation. Because employees of Cintas testified that documentation of the actual damage that\nCintas incurred as a result of the breach were available at the time of trial, Murphy concludes that\nCintas admitted that the liquidated damage provision was unenforceable.\n\nIn Stewart v. Basey, the Supreme Court considered the difference between an enforceable\nliquidated damage provision and an unenforceable penalty. Stewart v.

More recently, the courts have restated this two-part Stewart test when\nanalyzing the validity of a contractual damages provision:\n\n  In order to enforce a liquidated damage clause, the court must find:\n\n  (1) that the harm caused by the breach is incapable or difficult of estimation; and\n\n  (2) that the amount of liquidated damages called for is a reasonable forecast of just\n     compensation.\n\nPhillips, 820 S.W.2d at 788. For the provision to be an unenforceable penalty, the uncertainty of the\ndamages and the reasonableness of the stipulation must have existed at the time when the contract\nwas executed. Oetting v. Flake Uniform & Linen Service, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2458040\"><a href=\"/opinion/2458040/oetting-v-flake-uniform-linen-service-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">793</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 796 (Tex.Civ.App.—\nFt.

In\n2004, Gray signed another contract with Nexstar as an on-air performer for a term of employment\nfrom April 11, 2004, to May 31, 2006. The contract contained a provision titled “Remedies and\nProcedure for Remedying Disputes,” which stated:\n\n            In the event Employee elects to breach this Agreement and leave employment\n            prior to the conclusion of the term, the Company may accept as liquidated\n            damages for said breach the amount of $10,000. In the event the Company\n            determines that the liquidated damages amount described above is insufficient\n            to cover all of its damages, the Company may seek to obtain additional\n            compensatory and consequential damages by pursuing an action under\n            paragraph 7(a) herein.\n\nIn February 2005, Gray gave notice that she would be resigning from her position. Nexstar sent\nher a letter reminding her of her continuing obligations under the contract. The letter informed\nGray she would have to pay $10,000 if she left her employment. Nexstar learned that KTBS was\ninterested in hiring Gray and sent KTBS a letter stating that Gray was still under contract.\n\nGray stopped appearing as an on-air performer for Nexstar in March 2005. Within two weeks of\nGray's departure, she began working for KTBS.\n\n\n\n                THE DECLARATORY JUDGMENT AND ATTORNEY'S FEES\n\nNexstar's lawsuit against Gray sought “liquidated damages from Gray and/or all actual and\nconsequential damages proximately caused by her breach of contract.”Gray filed a counterclaim\nseeking a declaratory judgment that the liquidated damages provision in the contract was an\nunenforceable penalty as a matter of law.\n\nThe trial court found that the liquidated damages provision in the employment contract was an\nunenforceable penalty. The jury awarded Nexstar $1.00 in nominal damages from Gray for the\nbreach of contract. Nexstar and Gray stipulated to the amount of reasonable attorney's fees, but\nnot to entitlement to attorney's fees. The trial court awarded Gray attorney's fees.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.             2\n\fNexstar Broadcasting, Inc. v.

The jury found $2,000 in “out of pocket”\ndamages resulted from the interference with contract, but $1 in damages resulted from the breach\nof contract. Nexstar argued in a post-judgment pleading that it was entitled to contract damages,\nat the least, in “the same $2,000 awarded against Defendant KTBS.” In its claim against Gray,\nNexstar argues on appeal “it is clear that the jury improperly failed to consider the undisputed\nevidence regarding Nexstar being ‘out of pocket’ $2,000 for the speech pathologist/talent coach\nbecause it found Nexstar was ‘out of pocket’ this amount in its answer to the damages question\nagainst KTBS.” 2\n\nNexstar also contends it paid $7,000 to promote a new morning show format that featured Gray\nas a meteorologist.

At the time\nof trial, Nexstar still aired the morning show with the same format.\n\nNexstar also argues that it is entitled to the $146.31 in makeup expenses it paid to Gray. The\nemployment contract states that Gray would be reimbursed for makeup expenses for up to $50 per\nmonth. Nexstar presented two checks spent in makeup reimbursements: $73.61 paid in November\n2004; and $73.70 paid on April 20, 2004. KBTV's news director testified that Gray used the\nmakeup while she worked for Nexstar. Nexstar would have paid these expenses even had Gray\nfully performed under the contract.\n\nNexstar asserts that it reimbursed Gray $3,110.07 for her meteorology school tuition. Gray\nacknowledged that Nexstar paid for her to attend meteorology school. KBTV's news director\ntestified that Nexstar did not normally pay for meteorology school but agreed to pay Gray's tuition\nbecause she had “great potential.” The trial court admitted into evidence the checks issued by\nNexstar for Gray's tuition: $1,431.50 paid on January 16, 2004; $1,194.07 paid on June 1, 2004;\nand $484.50 paid on July 28, 2004. The last two tuition checks, for $1,194.07 and $484.50, were\npaid during the term of employment under the March 2004 contract. However, Nexstar was not\nrequired to reimburse Gray for her meteorology school tuition expenses under the March 2004\ncontract.\n\n *5 Nexstar argues that it paid $2,000 to a speech pathologist, or talent coach, who provided Gray\nwith voice training. The talent coach trained all of the on-air performers. KBTV's news director\nwould set a day planner for the coach and would allocate how much time each individual would\nspend with the coach. The time an individual would spend with the coach varied according to how\nlong the individual worked with the station and how much potential they had. KBTV's general\nmanager testified that when Gray first started working with the station, the coach spent more time\nwith Gray to improve her voice. However, Nexstar did not present evidence showing how much\ntime Gray spent with the coach, nor did it segregate Gray's time with the coach from the time the\nother on-air performers trained with the coach. The record does not show whether the training\noccurred when Gray was first hired under the original contract, or during the term of the second\ncontract.\n\nFinally, Nexstar also contends it incurred costs in hiring Gray's replacement and paid for an\non-air performer to fill in for Gray. While Nexstar sought candidates to replace Gray, Gray's\nmeteorology duties were covered by the station's chief and weekend meteorologists. Nexstar paid\nGray's meteorology replacement $191.30 in traveling expenses, $750 in moving expenses, and\n$607.81 for a plane ticket. Nexstar also paid $810 to a freelance reporter who covered some of\nGray's reporting duties.

We will vacate the trial court's judgment and dismiss the cause for lack of a\njusticiable controversy.\n\n\n\n                        FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe Texas IOLTA program, like similar programs instituted in almost every other state, was\nestablished to raise money to provide legal assistance to low-income Texans. The “Rules\nGoverning the Operation of the Texas Equal Access to Justice Program” oblige attorneys to\nparticipate, subject to suspension of their law licenses. See Tex.R. Equal Access to Justice Prog.\n24 (State Bar Rules art. 11). When an attorney holds client funds, the money should ordinarily\nbe deposited into a trust account to earn interest for the client. But where the amount held is\nnominal, such that it could not be expected to earn enough interest to offset the cost of maintaining\na separate trust account, the funds are required to be deposited into an IOLTA account. See Tex.R.\nEqual Access to Justice Prog. 4, 6. The IOLTA account pools all such deposits from the attorney;\ncollectively, the sums generate interest where no individual deposit could. The interest is then paid\nto the Foundation, which distributes the interest received from all IOLTA accounts in Texas to\nlow-income legal services. See Tex.R. Equal Access to Justice Prog. 4, 10.\n\nA constitutional takings challenge to Texas's IOLTA program was brought in Phillips v.\nWashington Legal Foundation, which resulted in a 1998 United States Supreme Court decision\nholding that interest *44 earned on an IOLTA account is the private property of the clients of the\nattorney who established the account. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118226\"><a href=\"/opinion/118226/phillips-v-washington-legal-foundation/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 172, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118226\"><a href=\"/opinion/118226/phillips-v-washington-legal-foundation/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

While Phillips did not decide the ultimate issue of whether compliance with\nthe IOLTA program effectuates a governmental taking of client property, it is fair to say that the\nconstitutionality of the program is uncertain in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision. It is that\nuncertainty that appellants hope to resolve in this action.\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                      2\n\fPaulsen v.

That case was an appeal from the trial court's grant of summary\njudgment and so arrived before the Supreme Court without the benefit of discovery. Since the\nrecord was essentially devoid of details, the Phillips decision made no reference to banking law\nor the particulars of an IOLTA contract between an attorney and bank. The Phillips decision\ntherefore makes no reference to the distinction recognized in Texas banking law between “general”\nand “special” accounts; this distinction, appellants assert, would have led to a different ruling.\nAppellants urge us to clarify what they characterize as the Supreme Court's misstatement of Texas\nlaw and to hold that both the principal and the interest earned on “general” accounts—and IOLTA\naccounts are apparently all “general”—are the property of the bank and not the client. Since the\ninterest earned is bank property, appellants argue, there is no unconstitutional taking involved\nwhen the bank pays that interest to the Foundation.\n\nAll parties to this suit agree on the constitutionality of IOLTA. Appellant Paulsen is an attorney\nwho has received a $1,000 retainer from a client and claims uncertainty as to his rights and\nobligations with respect to this money. The Equal Access to Justice Rules require him to deposit\nthe $1,000 in an IOLTA account or risk suspension of his license to practice law, yet he claims\nthe Phillips decision exposes him to liability to his client for breach of fiduciary duties if he does\ndeposit the funds. Bankers are the principal trade organizations for Texas financial institutions.\nThey claim that the contracts signed by their members and attorneys establishing IOLTA accounts\nare brought into question by the Phillips decision. While the banks are contractually obligated to\npay IOLTA interest to the Foundation, they also fear liability from threatened lawsuits should they\ncontinue to participate in the IOLTA program.\n\nAppellee, the Foundation, does not disagree with appellants as to the constitutionality of the\nIOLTA program. In fact, the Foundation has vigorously defended the IOLTA program as a\ndefendant in the ongoing Phillips litigation. It apparently disagrees with appellants only as to\nhow far this Court should go in deciding the ultimate constitutional issues involved. This lack of\nadversarial debate between the parties was noted in an amicus brief tendered by David Furlow, an\nattorney who disputes the constitutionality of the IOLTA program.\n\n\n\n                                                DISCUSSION\n\n [1] The Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act gives courts the power to “declare rights, status,\nand other legal relations whether or not further relief is or could be claimed.” Tex.

Because the trial\ncourt lacked subject matter jurisdiction over this case, we will vacate that court's judgment and\ndismiss the cause.\n\n\nAppellant Paulsen\n [4] Paulsen seeks declaratory judgment because, by refusing to deposit a $1,000 client retainer\nin his IOLTA account, he claims he faces the imminent suspension of his law license. It is not\nat all clear from the record that the suspension of Paulsen's license is inevitable or imminent.\nIn a post-submission brief, however, Paulsen attached a letter he received from the Foundation\ninforming him that disciplinary action will be initiated if he does not comply with IOLTA rules.\nAssuming without deciding that we can consider this letter, and further assuming that the letter\nconfers standing on Paulsen, we nonetheless conclude that his suit must be dismissed for want of\njurisdiction, for he has not demonstrated any justiciable controversy with his putative opponent\nin this case.\n\nThe crux of the claimed dispute between Paulsen and the Foundation lies in the interpretation\nof the Supreme Court's Phillips decision. Paulsen argues that if we accept as a correct statement\nof Texas law the Phillips holding that interest earned in IOLTA accounts is client property, 1\nthen the decision places him in an ethical quandary. If he continues to participate in the IOLTA\nprogram, Paulsen believes he breaches his ethical duty to his client when he contracts with his\nbank to turn IOLTA interest over to the Foundation. On the other hand, if he does not give the\ninterest to the Foundation, he breaches professional ethics rules and stands to lose his law license.\nThe Foundation disagrees with Paulsen only as to whether Phillips creates ethical uncertainty. It\nbelieves that Phillips answered only the question of whether a client could ever have a property\nright in interest that would not exist without the IOLTA program; the Foundation believes Phillips\ndid not establish conclusively that IOLTA interest is always client property. That question will\nbe decided by the federal district court on remand. This dispute, then, centers on how broadly\nPhillips can be read.\n\n [5] What is troubling about this appeal is that the parties all believe that an attorney can ethically\nparticipate in the Texas IOLTA program. Paulsen merely claims that someone else might construe\nPhillips differently, and that such an alternate interpretation would put him in an ethical bind.\nWith no true opponent in the Foundation, what Paulsen seeks, in essence, is an advisory opinion\ninterpreting a decision from the Supreme Court to resolve his doubts about the IOLTA program.\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Section 37.004 does not, however, extend an open-ended invitation to parties seeking\ninterpretation of their contracts. There must be some showing that litigation is imminent between\nthe parties unless the contractual uncertainties are judicially resolved. See Reuter v. Cordes–\nHendreks Coiffures, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1627470\"><a href=\"/opinion/1627470/reuter-v-cordes-hendreks-coiffures-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 196 (Tex.Civ.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1967, no\nwrit).\n\n[7] Bankers have not demonstrated any imminent contractual dispute with the Foundation. As\nprimary proof of their grounds for uncertainty, Bankers cite a letter from Michael Mazzone 3 to\nappellant banking groups warning that the banks could face liability for the tort of conversion\nfor any interest paid by them to the Foundation after the Phillips decision. In the letter, Mazzone\nominously warned that he has “personal knowledge that there are lawyers who are planning a class\naction lawsuit against a number of banks.”\n\nMazzone's letter is insufficient to support an action for declaratory judgment. It amounts to a\nthreat from a stranger to this action who refers to unnamed sources who may be contemplating a\nlawsuit at some point in the future. Bankers' feared liability to theoretical litigants is simply too\nremote to support a claim for declaratory relief. Further, it does not appear that the litigation the\nBankers fear would even involve the Foundation. Mazzone's letter warned banks that they could\nbe liable for the tort of conversion if they continue to pay IOLTA interest to the Foundation. In\nthat event, any liability for conversion would be to the clients of the depositing attorneys and not\nto the Foundation.\n\nBankers, as evidenced by their briefs, strongly believe that IOLTA is constitutional and apparently\nintend to honor their contracts establishing IOLTA accounts unless and until a court declares the\nIOLTA program unconstitutional. Even assuming that the Foundation would have standing to\nprotect its right as third-party beneficiary to the interest earned on IOLTA accounts, there is no\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The trial court, therefore, lacked jurisdiction to grant the relief sought by Bankers.\n\n\nTrue Controversy\nThe only issue on which the parties to this case seem to disagree is how broadly Phillips should\nbe read. Appellants paint a doomsday picture that throws all banking practices into uncertainty\nunless we hold that the Supreme Court misstated Texas law, grant declaratory relief reiterating\nthe distinction between “general” and “special” accounts, and explicitly hold that IOLTA is\nconstitutional. Appellants assert in the alternative that if, despite their arguments to the contrary,\nwe believe Phillips is correct, we should hold IOLTA expressly unconstitutional. The Foundation\nthinks the Phillips holding is *47 more narrow than appellants read it; they have no qualms with a\ndeclaration from this Court that IOLTA is constitutional, but they urge us to refrain from deciding\nIOLTA is unconstitutional on the strength of the Phillips decision. They otherwise have no dispute\nwith appellants' position and encourage us to grant the declaratory relief sought.\n\n [8] We must not decide a case that amounts to no more than a disagreement on how broadly the\nPhillips decision can be read. “A mere difference of opinion, not involving the assertion of adverse\ninterests, is not sufficient to support an action for declaratory judgment.” Reuter, 422 S.W.2d at 196\n(quoting 26 C.J.S. Declaratory Judgments, § 29 (1956)). In spite of the injuries and uncertainties\nappellants claim they will suffer, it seems they have no real dispute with the Foundation. This\ncase has been marked throughout by a near-total lack of true controversy between the parties. The\ntrial below was very brief. Paulsen was the only witness who testified, and cross-examination by\nthe Foundation's lawyer was perfunctory, consisting of only three questions to confirm that the\nPhillips court did not determine the ultimate constitutionality of the IOLTA program. On appeal,\nthe Foundation has not even raised the strongest reasons in support of the trial court's judgment—\nthose jurisdictional issues we have detailed above; indeed, appellee's brief is a mere seven pages\nlong. They are seven well-written and thoughtful pages, to be sure, but the brevity underscores\nthe lack of true controversy in this case.\n\nWhatever dispute appellants claim to have with the Foundation is clearly secondary to their\ndesire to have this Court effectively overrule the U.S. Supreme Court, declaring that the Court\nmisinterpreted Texas law in its Phillips ruling. Appellants' briefs focus almost exclusively on\nthe constitutionality of IOLTA, paying only minor attention to the claimed dispute with the\nFoundation.\n\nWe are not unsympathetic to appellants' arguments. The Phillips decision does appear to have at\nleast overlooked, if not misstated, a large body of Texas banking law that distinguishes between\n“general” and “special” accounts. See, e.g., Texas Commerce Bank v. Townsend, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2381588\"><a href=\"/opinion/2381588/texas-commerce-bank-new-braunfels-nat-assn-v-townsend/\"><span class=\"volume\">786</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(Tex.App.—Austin 1990, writ denied).

Both\nappellants and the Foundation are committed to upholding the constitutionality of the IOLTA\nprogram. In its brief the Foundation candidly admits that it does not contest the central legal\npremises of appellants' argument, and emphasizes that the Foundation is making the same pro-\nIOLTA arguments in the ongoing Phillips litigation in the federal district court.\n\nIn their arguments, the parties attempt to demonstrate that they are not in unanimous agreement\non how far this Court might go if we were to agree with the Supreme Court, but neither side ever\nseriously argues that IOLTA could be anything but constitutional. The hair-splitting difference\nbetween the parties' positions hardly presents the sort of robust debate a court should expect\nand demand when a major constitutional ruling is at issue. At core, both appellants and the\nFoundation *48 are in total agreement that IOLTA should be declared constitutional. It would be\ninappropriate for us to decide an issue of such gravity where there has been no genuine debate. In\nfact, the Supreme Court has expressly held that where both litigants agree on the constitutionality\nof a statute being challenged and desire the same result, there is no case or controversy before\nthe court.

Paulsen seeks an advisory opinion from this Court interpreting a United States\nSupreme Court opinion. Bankers face no imminent litigation over their IOLTA contracts, and\ntheir claimed uncertainty as to their rights and obligations is insufficient to present the court with\na justiciable action. For these reasons, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the\naction presented; we therefore vacate that court's judgment and dismiss the cause.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    Of course, Paulsen does not really want us to accept this as true at all. He frames the issue in these terms to attempt to create a\n        justiciable controversy between himself and the Foundation. The real goal of the litigation is apparently to have this Court decide\n        that the U.S. Supreme Court was wrong in so holding, and that consequently IOLTA is constitutional under Texas law. We discuss\n        infra why the present case is an inappropriate one for deciding that issue.\n2       In an IOLTA contract, the Foundation is declared to be a third-party beneficiary to the contract between the financial institution and\n        the attorney who establishes the account.\n3       Mazzone is a named plaintiff in the Phillips litigation.\n\n4       Paulsen is not a party to the Phillips case, but he was involved in the case to the extent that he drafted the amicus curiae briefs\n        tendered to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals on behalf of the state bars of Texas, Mississippi, and Louisiana in support of IOLTA.\n        The Foundation is a party to the ongoing Phillips litigation, but Bankers are not.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                           © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

When they\ndivorced, rather than break up their oil and gas holdings, they created Phillips & Phillips, Ltd., a\nlimited partnership, and transferred the bulk of their assets to it. Each had an equal interest in the\npartnership. Harry, the only general partner, agreed to work for the partnership full-time without\nsalary and to offer Martha the option to participate in any business opportunities he pursued outside\nthe partnership. Martha, the only limited partner, agreed that she would have no right to participate\nin Harry's business decisions for the partnership and that she would leave each of her four children\nby Harry at least one-sixth of her estate.\n\nThe partnership agreement required Harry to pay himself and Martha each a minimum *787 of\n$21,000 per month for 24 months, and then minimum monthly distributions adjusted for inflation\nand for oil and gas prices. It also required Harry to furnish Martha certain financial information\nabout the partnership and to cooperate with her in auditing its affairs. The agreement contained\nthe following provision: “If the general partner breaches his trust hereunder, he shall pay to the\nlimited partner as liquidated damages ten times the amount she loses as a result of such breaches\nof trust. Errors of judgment shall not be considered breaches of trusts.”\n\nThe value of the partnership increased under Harry's management, but Harry did not fully comply\nwith the terms of the written agreement. In particular, after the first 20 months Harry distributed\nmuch less than the required minimum amounts, never actually calculating what payments the\nagreement required. He also failed to provide timely annual statements of operations and refused\nto cooperate fully with Martha's attempts to audit the partnership.\n\nMartha eventually sued Harry for dissolution of the partnership and damages based upon Harry's\nbreach of contractual and fiduciary duties. The case was tried to a jury, who found that Harry\nbreached the partnership agreement by favoring himself in paying his personal expenses and\nencumbering partnership assets, thus endangering partnership distributions. The jury also found\nthat Harry breached both the partnership agreement and his fiduciary duty to Martha by failing to\nkeep current and complete partnership books, failing to prepare required annual statements, and\ninterfering with Martha's efforts to examine partnership books and records. 1 The jury assessed\nMartha's actual damages at $300,000. None of the jury's findings are challenged by the parties\non appeal.\n\nDuring the trial the parties stipulated that a reasonable fee for legal services necessary for Martha's\nprosecution of the case was $235,302.14. The jury was aware of this stipulation, and the trial court\nsurmised that the jury included this amount in its $300,000 finding. Accordingly, the trial court\nrendered judgment for Martha for a total of $300,000, $235,302.14 against the partnership and\n$64,697.86 against Harry, and refused to award Martha any additional amount for attorney fees.\nThe trial court also ordered the partnership dissolved.\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The court of appeals held that the trial court erred in refusing to\naward Martha the $235,302.14 stipulated attorney fees in addition to the $300,000 damages found\nby the jury, but that the trial court did not err in refusing to award Martha decuple damages under\nthe partnership agreement. Consequently, the appeals court reversed the judgment of the trial court\nin part and rendered judgment against Harry for a total of $535,302.14, plus interest. 2\n\n *788 Martha contends that she is entitled to recover liquidated damages equal to ten times\nthe actual damages found by the jury, as provided by the limited partnership agreement. Harry\ncontends that the contractual provision is not an enforceable agreement for liquidated damages but\nan unenforceable penalty. Martha argues that even if Harry is correct, he has waived any defense\nof penalty by failing to plead it as an affirmative defense.\n\n [1] We first considered the difference between an enforceable liquidated damages provision and\nan unenforceable penalty in Stewart v. Basey, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">666</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1507983\"><a href=\"/opinion/1507983/stewart-v-basey/\"><span class=\"volume\">245</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">484</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 485–486 (1952).\nThere we explained:\n\n   Volumes have been written on the question of when a stipulated damage provision of a contract\n   should be enforced as liquidated damages and when enforcement should be denied because it is\n   a penalty provision.... All agree that to be enforceable as liquidated damages the damages must\n   be uncertain and the stipulation must be reasonable.\n\n.....\n\n   The right of competent parties to make their own bargains is not unlimited. The universal rule\n   for measuring damages for the breach of a contract is just compensation for the loss or damage\n   actually sustained. By the operation of that rule a party generally should be awarded neither\n   less nor more than his actual damages. A party has no right to have a court enforce a stipulation\n   which violates the principle underlying that rule.\n\nMore recently, in Rio Grande Valley Sugar Growers, Inc. v.

A\ncontractual provision like the one here by which one party agrees to pay the other some multiple\nof actual damages for breach of the agreement does not meet either part of the legal test for\nan enforceable liquidated damages provision. It cannot meet the first prong of the test because\nthe harm caused by the breach of the contract is not incapable or difficult of estimation. The\nprovision assumes actual damages can and will be determined, indeed must be determined, before\nthe prescribed multiplier can be applied. The provision cannot meet the second prong of the test\nbecause, instead of attempting to forecast actual damages, it calls for them to be determined and\nthen multiplied. Cf. Robert G.

Although penalty is not\namong the affirmative defenses enumerated in Rule 94, TEX.R.CIV.P., the listing in that rule\nis not exclusive.

This holding resurrects trial by ambush and\nrejects the notion that parties are entitled to know what theories of law they will face at trial. I would\nhold that by failing to plead it, Mr. Phillips waived his right to assert that the contract he entered\ninto with his wife is unenforceable. Furthermore, since Mr. Phillips waived the penalty defense by\nfailing to affirmatively plead it, I would not reach the question of whether the contractual provision\nin question is, on its face, an unenforceable penalty. I thus would reverse the judgment of the\ncourt of appeals and remand this cause to the trial court for entry of a judgment that enforces the\nprovision.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Phillips were married for 32 years prior to getting a divorce. With the assistance of\ncounsel, they entered into a pre-divorce agreement, whereby they transferred about $18 million\nof their assets into a partnership which Mr. Phillips would manage. Mr. Phillips in effect said to\nhis soon-to-be ex-wife: “Trust me.” As a disincentive to cheating or short changing Mrs. Phillips,\nMr. Phillips pledged that he would pay her 10 times the amount of the losses if he violated the\ncontract. 1 The agreement also recited that Mr. Phillips owed Mrs. Phillips a fiduciary duty, a\nhigher standard of care than normally exists between parties to a contract. 2\n\nEight years later, Mrs. Phillips sued Mr. Phillips, alleging that he violated the agreement. *791\nMr. Phillips entered a general denial and asserted the affirmative defenses of limitations, laches,\nand equitable estoppel. In a unanimous verdict, the jury found that Mr. Phillips breached the\nagreement by interfering with Mrs. Phillips right to examine the books and records of the\npartnership, and by willfully underpaying Mrs. Phillips and overpaying himself.\n\n\n\n                                          AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\nRule 94 enumerates specific affirmative defenses which are waived if not pleaded, such as accord\nand satisfaction, arbitration and award, fraud, illegality, statute of frauds, statute of limitations,\n“and any other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense.” TEX.R.CIV.P. 94.

In other words, if the defendant asserts facts that defeat in whole or in\npart the plaintiff's claim, such assertion amounts to an affirmative defense that must be pleaded\nor it is waived. “Penalty” is a classic affirmative defense; in my view, it clearly falls within the\npurview of Rule 94.\n\nThe majority implies that as long as the issue does not depend upon evidence or findings, no\npurpose is served by requiring that it be specifically pleaded. But there is a valid purpose to serve,\nnamely, the need for notice and fair play, so as to avoid trials by ambush.\n\nThe court refers to Lewkowicz v. El Paso Apparel Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1770910\"><a href=\"/opinion/1770910/lewkowicz-v-el-paso-apparel-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">625</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 303 (Tex.1981), for\nits holding that pleading is not necessary if the affirmative defense appears on the face of the\nplaintiff's pleadings. That case is distinguishable because it involved the defense of illegality of\ncontract. The defense of illegality is a special situation and a poor choice from which to draw a rule\nof general applicability. The rule that a court will not enforce an illegal contract is for the public's\nbenefit rather than contending parties. Lewis v.

That is, courts should not have to validate\ncontracts that are illegal on their face merely because a defendant has failed to plead illegality.\n\nHere, the court seems to be saying that pleading and proof are not necessary, because the issue\nof whether the liquidated damages provision is a penalty is a question of law. In some contracts\nit may be possible to determine from their four corners that they impose a penalty. The classic\nexample is the lease that assesses the same liquidated damages for every breach, regardless of how\ntrivial. Stewart v.

In that case, a mineral lease provided that the\nlessee was required to drill a second well or pay $75,000, which the defendant contended was a\npenalty. There is no way a court could possibly know if this provision is a reasonable forecast of\ndamages and therefore not a penalty, unless pleadings and proof develop the issue. It would be\npatently unfair not to require defendant to notify the plaintiff that the possible existence of penalty\nwould be an issue and this is contrary to well established case law.\n\nEvery intermediate appellate court considering this issue has held that penalty is an affirmative\ndefense under Rule 94 which is waived if not pleaded.

In my view, this is a retreat from this\ncourt's recent trend towards encouraging full disclosure during discovery of all witnesses, facts and\nlegal theories upon which a party intends to rely at trial. This trend not only encourages litigants\nto be well prepared for trial, but also enables disputes to be resolved on their true merits and\nnot on “mere technicalities.” It makes no sense to me to subject parties to a severe sanction for\nfailing to disclose witnesses or to supplement discovery responses, but not require them to plead\nthe legal theory upon which they intend to rely to defeat their opponent's claim. The majority has\ncreated an exception to Rule 94 that has a visceral appeal, but collapses on its own logic. The court\nsays that the contractual provision in issue is a penalty as a matter of law, and thus need not be\npleaded (and can be asserted as a defense for the first time on appeal). But a defendant likewise\nmay defeat a contract claim under a statute of limitations defense. And while the defendant may\nbe entitled to a judgment as a matter of law, we nevertheless require affirmative pleading of the\nstatute of limitations defense. The court ultimately rationalizes its de facto modification of Rule\n94 by relying on the RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 356 to assert that public\npolicy demands the result. The court expands the public policy exception to Rule 94's pleading\nrequirement beyond the exception for illegal contracts to include contracts that allegedly impose\na penalty. This is a faulty rationale. First, this is not a case where pure contract principles apply.\nMr. Phillips agreed to a higher standard of care (namely, a fiduciary's standard) than he normally\nwould have owed Mrs. Phillips in a standard contractual relationship. Courts impose damages on\nparties who violate a fiduciary duty in order to punish the party's breach of trust. I agree with the\nRestatement § 356's directive that the “central objective behind the system of contract remedies is\ncompensatory, not punitive.” RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 356 comment a\n(1979). But Mr. Phillips entered into this agreement with his eyes open, accepting a higher than\nnormal standard of care and devising and adopting a measure of damages for his breach of that\nstandard. I do not see how the it advances the best interest of the public to bail him out of his\nbargain. I would hold that penalty is an affirmative defense that must be pleaded and that Mr.\nPhillips waived this defense by failing to plead it. For the above reasons, I dissent.\n\n\n\nMAUZY and DOGGETT, JJ., join this opinion.\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

As a rule, however, the judgment in\n       a case tried by a jury must conform to the verdict. See TEX.R.CIV.P. 301.

Given that\n       assumption, we must conclude that the jury's answer of $300,000 to the trial court's question did not include attorney fees.\n          Harry argues that, logically, the jury must have arrived at their $300,000 finding by adding $37,585 accounting fees which Martha\n          testified she incurred to the stipulated $250,000 in attorney fees. However plausible Harry's explanation of the jury's reasoning\n          process may be, it cannot substitute for the jury's finding.

CSG\nresponded to Southern Union's request in February 2000. Southern Union selected CSG's bid from\nthe field of candidates, and the two companies engaged in formal negotiations from April until\nSeptember.\n\nA contract was finalized and signed by representatives from both Southern Union and CSG as of\nOctober 13, 2000. The contract contained a “discontinuance fee” provision, obligating Southern\nUnion to pay a specified amount of damages to CSG in the event that Southern Union terminated\nthe agreement before its five-year term expired. The parties agree that the provision was intended\nas a liquidated damages provision.\n\nAfter the contract was finalized, CSG provided Southern Union with a written project plan\ncontemplating December 1, 2000 as the date for CSG to “go live” with the print-and-mail\noperations. In the months leading up to that deadline, implementation problems arose on both sides\nand the conversion fell behind schedule. The companies continued discussions in an attempt to\nsolve the problems until the first week of January 2001, when Southern Union ceased work on the\nproject. Southern Union filed suit against CSG on February 7, asserting breach of contract among\nother causes of action.\n\nIn its verdict, the jury found that Southern Union and CSG were both in breach of the agreement,\nbut that CSG's breach was excused, and that CSG would be fairly and reasonably compensated by\nan award of $2.1 million for the discontinuance fee; $111,000 for the cost of paper and envelopes\npurchased by CSG; $1,045,944 for CSG's lost profits; and $140,000 for the cost of software\nlicenses provided by CSG to Southern Union. Beneath the last element of damages, the jury wrote\n“upon return of 300 licenses to CSG, the answer would be $0.”The trial court determined that, as a\nmatter of law, it was proper to award liquidated damages in lieu of actual damages, and therefore\nentered a final judgment in conformance with the jury's verdict, for a total amount of $2,351,000,\nplus interest and attorney's fees.\n\n\n\n                                                 ANALYSIS\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Southern Union\nfirst asserts that, based on the timing of its breach, the proper calculation of the fee results in a zero\nsum. Alternatively, Southern Union asserts that even if the proper calculation is $2.1 million, CSG\nis not entitled to recover the award because that amount constitutes an illegal penalty. Southern\nUnion also claims that prejudgment interest should not be awarded on CSG's damages for the\ndiscontinuance fee or lost profits. Finally, Southern Union urges that it is entitled to a remittitur\nof $140,000 because it returned the software licenses to CSG.\n\n\nThe Discontinuance Fee Provision\nSouthern Union's first issue, asserting that the timing of Southern Union's breach results in zero\ndamages for the discontinuance fee, turns on a construction of the provision's terms. We agree\nwith the parties that the provision is unambiguous. We therefore review this issue as a matter of\nlaw, looking only to the contract's four corners and interpreting its plain meaning. See French\nv. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2462917\"><a href=\"/opinion/2462917/french-v-chevron-usa-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">795</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 796-97 (Tex.1995). The discontinuance fee provision\nstates:\n\n           The parties have mutually agreed upon the fees for the Services to be provided\n           hereunder based upon certain assumed volumes of processing activity, and the\n           length of the term of Agreement. Customer 2 acknowledges and agrees that,\n           without the certainty of revenue promised by the commitments set forth in this\n           Agreement, CSG would have been unwilling to provide the Services at the\n           fees set forth in the Agreement. Because of the difficulty in ascertaining CSG's\n           actual damages for a termination or other breach of the Agreement by Customer\n           resulting in a termination of this Agreement before the expiration of the then-\n           current term, Customer agrees that prior to such termination and in addition to\n           all other amounts then due and owing to CSG, Customer will pay to CSG (as\n           a contract and not as a penalty) an amount equal to a percentage of the total\n           Subscriber Statement Minimum for the remaining term of the Agreement, as\n           defined in Schedule C, times the then current ESP Processing Fees for the First\n           Physical Page, as defined in Schedule C beginning with the calendar month\n           in which termination occurs (“Discontinuance Fee”). If any such termination\n           occurs prior to the first anniversary of the Effective Date of this Agreement,\n           the percentage shall be fifty percent (50%). If between the first and second\n           anniversary of the Effective Date it shall be thirty percent (30%) and if following\n           the second anniversary of the Effective Date it shall be ten percent (10%).\n           Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Discontinuance Fee is a reasonable\n           estimation of the actual damages which CSG would suffer if CSG were to fail\n           to receive the amount of processing business contemplated by this Agreement.\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In the event of a sale or transfer of all or substantially all of Southern\n           Union Company's assets to a third party, the percentages used to calculate the\n           Discontinuance Fee shall be twenty-five percent (25%), fifteen percent (15%)\n           and five percent (5%), respectively.\n\n*3 (Emphasis added.)\n\nThe parties agree that, given the plain meaning of the relevant language, the proper way to calculate\nthe discontinuance fee for a breach within the first year of signing the agreement is to multiply the\napplicable “Subscriber Statement Minimum” by the applicable “ESP Processing Fees” and then\ntake fifty percent of that total. The parties disagree, however, on how to determine one factor of this\nequation: the Subscriber Statement Minimum. Southern Union asserts that, pursuant to Schedule\nC, the minimum does not accrue until after the “commencement date.” 3 Because Southern Union\nbreached this agreement prior to the commencement date, 4 it claims that the minimum was zero,\nand that the total calculation should therefore be zero.\n\nCSG interprets the provision to mean that, although Schedule C prevents Southern Union from\nhaving to pay the monthly minimum until after the commencement date, that time restriction\ndoes not apply to Southern Union's liability under the discontinuance fee provision. CSG asserts\nthat Southern Union's interpretation is wrong because it allows Southern Union to breach the\ncontract without consequence, so long as it does so within ninety days of the commencement date,\nregardless of the significant time and money invested by CSG during the implementation phase.\nAccording to CSG, the liquidated damages provision is most necessary during this initial time\nperiod because of the parties' unequal contributions and because of the difficulty in calculating\npotential damages before any actual profits have been made.\n\nWe agree with CSG's reading of the contract. Nothing in the provision limits its applicability to a\nbreach occurring after the commencement of services. The provision specifies the circumstances\nin which Southern Union is excused from paying the discontinuance fee, and none impose such\na timing limitation. To the contrary, the provision's express terms state that Southern Union shall\nbe liable for the discontinuance fee, at a rate of fifty percent, should it cause “any termination”\nwithin one year of signing the contract.\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Pamela\nVanlandingham, CSG's Senior Vice President and General Manager of the statement processing\ncenter, testified that during November and December, the CSG team “worked around the clock” to\ncomplete the project, which included working “very hard over the holidays,” and that “CSG [had]\nexpended right at 500 to 600 hours” when Southern Union breached the contract. Southern Union\nofficials confirmed that the nature of this contract required front-loaded efforts by CSG and that,\nprior to terminating the agreement, they were aware of the money CSG invested on supplies and\nequipment, and of the hours CSG put toward programming, testing, and implementing the new\nsystem. David Kvapil, the Chief Financial Officer for Southern Union, testified that he knew CSG\nhad worked “well beyond the number of hours they were going to dedicate to the project,” that CSG\nhad provided a “significant batch of bills” to Southern Union for approval, and that CSG had spent\nover $100,000 on envelopes and paper by the end of December 2000. Christine Shores, a business\nanalyst for Southern Union's mail services division, testified that Southern Union approved the\norder for paper and envelopes prior to CSG placing it, and that Southern Union was aware of the\ntime and money spent by CSG in its efforts to commence live operations.\n\n *4 Based on the plain meaning of the provision, as supported by the witnesses' testimony,\nSouthern Union's liability for the discontinuance fee is not limited to a breach occurring after\nthe commencement of live operations. Southern Union is liable under the discontinuance fee for\nits breach of the agreement during the implementation phase. The amount of fair and reasonable\ndamages pursuant to the discontinuance fee was therefore properly calculated by the jury, and\naffirmed by the trial court, as $2.1 million. Southern Union's first issue is overruled.\n\n\nLiquidated Damages\nSouthern Union claims in its second issue that, if the discontinuance fee is properly calculated\nas $2.1 million, then CSG is not entitled to any recovery of that amount because it constitutes\nan improper penalty. For the purposes of this case, the parties agree that the discontinuance fee\nshould be treated as an award of liquidated damages.\n\nA liquidated damages provision may only be enforced when the court finds “(1) that the harm\ncaused by the breach is incapable or difficult of estimation and (2) that the amount of liquidated\ndamages called for is a reasonable forecast of just compensation.”Phillips v.

Southern Union bases this claim on a “price projection” document prepared\nby CSG before entering the agreement, which anticipated that CSG would earn a total profit\nof $1,045,944 over the five-year term of its contract with Southern Union. Because the jury\nultimately awarded this exact amount to CSG as lost profits, Southern Union argues that CSG was\ncapable of precisely estimating its damages, and therefore the liquidated damages provision is an\nunenforceable penalty from which CSG is not entitled to recover. The record, however, shows\notherwise.\n\nThe language of the discontinuance fee provision supports the trial court's determination that an\naward of liquidated damages was proper because CSG's actual damages were not easy to estimate.\nThe provision expressly states that it was included in the contract “[b]ecause of the difficulty in\nascertaining CSG's actual damages for a termination or other breach of the Agreement,” and that\n“CSG would have been unwilling to provide the Services at the fees set forth in the Agreement” had\nSouthern Union not promised “certainty of revenue” by obligating itself to pay the discontinuance\nfee in the event that it breached the contract. This provision was a bargained-for exchange,\nnegotiated and approved by both companies.\n\n *5 When a provision is mutually bargained for by equally competent parties, we give deference\nto its enforcement. See Shel-al Corp. v. American Nat'l Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"317105\"><a href=\"/opinion/317105/shel-al-corporation-v-american-national-insurance-company-and-exchange/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 94 (5th Cir.1974).\nStanley Mayer, Southern Union's Chief Information Officer, testified that the provision's terms\nwere negotiated between attorneys representing both companies. From the face of the contract,\nSouthern Union understood at the time it entered the agreement that CSG's damages would be\ndifficult to estimate and therefore agreed a liquidated damages provision was necessary.\n\n“[T]he fundamental purpose of a valid liquidated damages provision is to provide a reasonable\nmeasure of compensation in the event of a breach where, at the time the provision is agreed\nto the damages are indeterminable or will be otherwise difficult to prove.”24 Williston on\nContracts § 65:3, at 250 (4th ed.2002). It is well established that lost profits can be inherently\ndifficult to estimate. See Texas Inst., Inc. v. Teletron Energy Mgmt., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2384880\"><a href=\"/opinion/2384880/texas-instruments-inc-v-teletron-energy-mgt-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">877</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">276</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n279 (Tex.1994). Frequently, lost profits are too speculative to recover because their calculation\ndepends on “uncertain and changing conditions, such as market fluctuations,” and this uncertainty\nis heightened where no profits have been made at the time the contract is breached. Id. The contract\nreflects that Southern Union and CSG sought to avoid such speculation in agreeing to the liquidated\ndamages provision. The sliding scale of damages recognized the front-loaded value to be provided\nby CSG. As argued by CSG, had there not been a discontinuance fee to rely on, in the event of\na breach by Southern Union-particularly early in the contract term-then CSG would have risked\nbeing unable to recover because of the uncertainty in calculating its lost profits.\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The purpose of\nthe document was not to define CSG's potential damages. Rather, as Vanlandingham testified,\nthe projection was an internal tool used by CSG to outline the prices it anticipated charging for\nits print-and-mail services, so that CSG could make an informed bid in response to Southern\nUnion's request for proposal. Vanlandingham also testified that the projection was prepared with a\n“conservative accounting approach to pricing.” CSG excluded several items from its calculations\nbecause, prior to entering the contract, the parties had not assigned a value to these items. This\nincreased the difficulty of estimating damages. CSG's expert confirmed the difficulty of this\nestimation by explaining several different ways that CSG's lost profits could be calculated, with the\nresults ranging between approximately $1 million to $4 million. After hearing this evidence, the\njury determined that $1,045,944 was a reasonable award of lost profits. But their verdict does not\nestablish that the estimation was either an easy or precise one to make. Given the mutually agreed-\nupon terms of the provision, and the evidence in support of its plain meaning, we are unpersuaded\nby Southern Union's assertion that CSG's damages were easy to estimate.\n\n\nReasonable Forecast of Just Compensation\n *6 Southern Union seeks to satisfy the second part of its burden by showing that the\ndiscontinuance fee provision is an unenforceable penalty because the amount awarded to CSG\nas liquidated damages is unreasonable. Southern Union claims that this is established simply by\nthe fact that the $2.1 million awarded to CSG pursuant to the discontinuance fee is double the\namount found by the jury as lost profits. A liquidated damages provision will be considered an\nunenforceable penalty if the amount awarded is so disproportionate to the actual or anticipated\ndamages that it in effect punishes the breach, thereby coercing performance of the contract by\nmaking it too costly to not adhere to its terms. 24 Williston on Contracts § 65:3, at 249 (4th\ned.2002); see also Kothe v.

Thus, as a matter of law, it is not unreasonable per se to award liquidated\ndamages in an amount that is double the actual damages.

As we have observed, appellees alleged in their petition, as a basis\nfor showing a justiciable controversy, that the State ‘the indicated its intention to proceed against\nthe Plaintiffs pursuant to said penalty provisions of said Code, which has given rise to a bona fide\ncontroversy and created justiciable issues which the Court has authority to determine.’\n\nIt is obvious from the record that appellees filed their petition seeking advice from the courts\nbecause they were ‘uncertain of whether or not (their) action or proposed action’ in carrying on\nthe Sundaco scheme ‘violates or will violate’ Section 15.04 prohibiting monopolies, trusts, and\nconspiracies in restraint of trade. Even if all but the prospective aspects of Section 15.12 are valid,\nand we do not decide that question, the suit for declaratory judgment will not lie unless proof is\nmade of a bona fide threat of interference by the State invoking the anti-trust laws.\n\nDiscretion rests with the Attorney General as to whether anti-trust suits will be brought by the State\nto interdict the Sundaco operations and invoke penalties. The record is devoid of any showing\nthat appellees had been ordered to discontinue their operations. There is no evidence of a threat\nto interfere with Sundaco activities as a violation of Section 15.04. No threat of interference by\nthe State with the rights of appellees appears beyond that implied by the existence of the statute\nand the State's answer defending against the petition for declaratory judgment. Appellees may not\ncompel the Attorney General to exercise his discretion by filing suit for declaratory judgment.\n\nThe power of courts to pass upon the ‘uncertainty’ appellees have with regard to their actions will\narise only when the interest of appellees require the use of judicial authority for their protection\nagainst actual interference.

We affirm the trial court's judgment as it relates to TAB's\njury trial challenge and reverse its judgment as to TAB's open courts challenge.\n\nAn overview of the regulatory scheme enacted by the legislature and these agencies is essential to\nan understanding of this case. In 1967, the Texas Legislature enacted the Clean Air Act of Texas.\nClean Air Act of Texas, 60th Leg., R.S., ch. 727, 1967 Tex.Gen.Laws 1941. The Clean Air Act was\ndesigned to safeguard the state's air resources without compromising the economic development\nof the state. Id. at § 1. The Act created the Texas Air Control Board and granted it the authority\nto promulgate regulations to accomplish the Act's goals. Id. at § 4(A)(2)(a). In the event the Air\nControl Board determined that a violation of its regulations had occurred, it was authorized to\nenforce those regulations in district court. Upon a judicial determination that a violation of the\nAir Control Board's regulations had occurred, two cumulative remedies were available, injunctive\nrelief to prohibit further violations and assessment of a fine ranging from $50 to $1,000 for each\nday the violations persisted. Id. at § 12(B).\n\nIn 1969, the Texas Legislature enacted the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Solid Waste Disposal Act,\n61st Leg., R.S., ch. 405, 1969 Tex.Gen.Laws 1320. The express purpose for this legislation was\nto protect public health and welfare by regulating the “collection, handling, storage, and disposal\nof solid waste.” Id. at § 1. The Texas Water Quality Board was designated the primary agency to\neffectuate the Disposal Act's purpose. Id. at § 4(f). Like the Air Control Board, the Water Quality\nBoard was authorized to enforce its rules and regulations in state district court. The Solid Waste\nDisposal Act provided the same remedies as the Clean Air Act. See id. at § 8(c).\n\nIn the last of the relevant statutory enactments, in 1969, the Texas Legislature promulgated a\nrevised version of the Water Quality Act. Water Quality Act—Revision, 61st Leg., R.S., ch. 760,\n1969 Tex.Gen.Laws 2229. By that Act, the Water Quality Board was given the power to develop\na statewide water quality plan, to perform research and investigations, and to adopt rules and\nissue orders necessary to effectuate the Act's purposes. Id. at § 3.01–3.10. The Water Quality Act\nprovided the same remedies as the Solid Waste Management Act and the Clean Air Act. See id.\nat § 4.02.\n\nOriginally, neither the Water Quality Board nor the Air Control Board had the power to levy civil\npenalties directly in the event it determined that its regulations or orders had been violated. Instead,\neach board was required first to file suit against the violator in district court. Only the district court\nhad the power to assess civil penalties.\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

That year the Air Control\nBoard and the Water Commission (formerly the Water Control Board) were granted the power\nto assess civil penalties directly of up to $10,000 per day per violation. 2 Both administrative\nbodies also retained the option to pursue civil penalties in district court. *443 TEX.HEALTH\n& SAFETY CODE §§ 361.224, 382.081; TEX.WATER CODE § 26.123. This was the regulatory\nscheme in effect when the district court rendered judgment in this case. 3\n\nAfter the Air Control Board or Water Commission assesses a penalty, the offender must either\ntimely pay the penalty or file suit in district court. However, a supersedeas bond or cash deposit\npaid into an escrow account, in the full amount of the penalty, is a prerequisite to judicial review.\nTEX.HEALTH & SAFETY CODE §§ 382.089(a), (b), 361.252(k), (l ); TEX.WATER CODE\n§ 26.136(j). A party who fails to make a cash deposit or file a bond forfeits all rights to judicial\nreview. TEX.HEALTH & SAFETY CODE §§ 361.252(m), 382.089(c); TEX.WATER CODE §\n26.136(k).\n\nTAB alleges that it is a Texas not-for-profit corporation, that its members do business throughout\nTexas, and that it is authorized to represent its members on any matter that may have an impact\non their businesses.\n\nTAB filed this suit under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, TEX.CIV.PRAC. &\nREM.CODE §§ 37.001–37.011, alleging that some of its members had been subjected to civil\npenalties assessed by either the Air Control Board or the Water Commission. TAB further alleged\nthat all of its other members that operate their businesses pursuant to the pertinent provisions of\nthe Texas Clean Air Act, the Texas Water Code, or the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act or any\nrules or orders issued pursuant to those provisions were put at “substantial risk (if not certainty)”\nof being assessed civil penalties by the Air Control Board or the Water Commission. Thus this\nsuit does not challenge specific instances of the Air Control Board's or the Water Commission's\nexercise, or threatened exercise, of the civil penalty power. Instead, TAB's suit is a facial challenge\nto the constitutionality of this administrative enforcement scheme under the Texas Constitution.\n\nThe Defendants and Intervenors counterclaimed seeking a declaratory judgment that the statutes,\nrules, and regulations challenged by TAB do not, on their face, conflict with the open courts and\njury trial provisions of our constitution. The trial court granted the Defendants' and Intervenors'\nrequested declaratory judgment and denied TAB's request for a declaratory judgment. The court\nalso denied TAB's request for injunctive relief.\n\nTAB appealed directly to this court. See TEX.GOV'T CODE § 22.001(c); 4 TEX.R.APP.P. 140.\nIn this court, TAB has limited its challenges to claims of unconstitutional denial of a jury trial and\nviolation of our constitution's open courts provision.\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Standing\n\nBefore we reach the merits of this case, we first consider the matter of the trial court's jurisdiction,\nas well as our own; specifically we determine whether TAB has standing to challenge the statutes\nand regulations in question. Because TAB's standing to bring this action is not readily apparent,\nand because our jurisdiction as well as that of the trial court depends on this issue, we requested\nsupplemental briefing on standing at the oral argument of this case. In response, the parties insist\nthat any question of standing has been waived in the trial court and cannot be raised by the court\nfor the first time on appeal. We disagree.\n\n [1] Subject matter jurisdiction is essential to the authority of a court to decide a case. Standing\nis implicit in the concept of subject matter jurisdiction. The standing requirement stems from two\nlimitations on subject matter jurisdiction: the separation of powers doctrine and, in Texas, the open\ncourts provision. Subject matter jurisdiction *444 is never presumed and cannot be waived. 5\n\n [2] [3] One limit on courts' jurisdiction under both the state and federal constitutions is the\nseparation of powers doctrine.

To comport with Article III, a federal court may hear a case only when the litigant has\nbeen threatened with or has sustained an injury. Valley Forge Christian College, 454 U.S. at 471,\n102 S.Ct. at 758. Under the Texas Constitution, standing is implicit in the open courts provision,\nwhich contemplates access to the courts only for those litigants suffering an injury. Specifically,\nthe open courts provision provides:\n\n            All courts shall be open, and every person for an injury done him, in his lands,\n            goods, person or reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law.\n\nTEX. CONST. art. I, § 13 (emphasis added). Because standing is a constitutional prerequisite to\nmaintaining a suit under both federal and Texas law, we look to the more extensive jurisprudential\nexperience of the federal courts on this subject for any guidance it may yield.\n\nUnder federal law, a lack of standing deprives a court of subject matter jurisdiction because\nstanding is an element of such *445 jurisdiction.

Because we conclude that standing is a\ncomponent of subject matter jurisdiction, it cannot be waived and may be raised for the first time\non appeal. 8\n\n [8] If we were to conclude that standing is unreviewable on appeal at least three undesirable\nconsequences could result. First and foremost, appellate courts would be impotent to prevent lower\ncourts from exceeding their constitutional and statutory limits of authority. Second, appellate\ncourts could not arrest collusive suits. Third, by operation of the doctrines of res judicata and\ncollateral estoppel, judgments rendered in suits addressing only hypothetical injuries could bar\nrelitigation of issues by a litigant who eventually suffers an actual injury. We therefore hold that\nstanding, as a component of subject matter *446 jurisdiction, cannot be waived in this or any\nother case and may be raised for the first time on appeal by the parties or by the court.\n\nWe are aware that this holding conflicts with Texas Industrial Traffic League v.

MARY'S L.J. 865,\n870 (1990).\n\n [11] Here, however, we are not reviewing a trial court order of dismissal for want of jurisdiction,\nwe are considering standing for the first time on appeal. A review of only the pleadings to\ndetermine subject matter jurisdiction is sufficient in the trial court because a litigant has a right to\namend to attempt to cure pleading defects if jurisdictional facts are not alleged. See TEX.R.CIV.P.\n80. Failing that, the suit is dismissed. When an appellate court questions jurisdiction on appeal\nfor the first time, however, there is no opportunity to cure the defect. Therefore, when a Texas\nappellate court reviews the standing of a party sua sponte, it must construe the petition in favor of\nthe party, and if necessary, review the entire record to determine if any evidence supports standing.\n\n [12] TAB asserts standing on behalf of its members. The general test for standing in Texas\nrequires that there “(a) shall be a real controversy between the parties, which (b) will be actually\ndetermined by the judicial declaration sought.” Board of Water Engineers v.

While we agree with the statement of the\ngeneral test for standing set out in Board of Water Engineers, we foresee difficulties in relying on\nit alone to determine the standing of an organization like TAB. For instance, when members of an\norganization have individual standing, but the organization was not established for the purpose of\nprotecting the particular interest at issue, it is not necessarily in the members' best interest to allow\nsuch a disinterested organization to sue on their behalf. Furthermore, an organization should not\nbe allowed to sue on behalf of its members when the claim asserted requires the participation of\nthe members individually rather than as an association, such as when the members seek to recover\nmoney damages and the amount of damages varies with each member.\n\n [13] The United States Supreme Court has articulated a standard for associational standing that\nlends itself to our use. We adopt that test today. In Hunt v.

Reviewing the record in its entirety\nfor evidence supporting subject matter jurisdiction, and resolving any doubt in TAB's favor, we\nconclude that TAB has standing to pursue the relief it seeks in this case.\n\nThe first prong of the Hunt test requires that TAB's pleadings and the rest of the record demonstrate\nthat TAB's members have standing to sue in their own behalf. This requirement should not be\ninterpreted to impose unreasonable obstacles to associational representation. In this regard the\nUnited States Supreme Court stated that “the purpose of the first part of the Hunt test is simply to\nweed out plaintiffs who try to bring cases, which could not otherwise be brought, by manufacturing\nallegations of standing that lack any real foundation.” New York State Club Ass'n, 487 U.S. at 9,\n108 S.Ct. at 2232. We are satisfied that TAB has not manufactured this lawsuit. A comparison of\nthe association's membership roster with the list of businesses subjected to state penalties indicates\nindividual TAB members have been assessed administrative penalties pursuant to the challenged\nenactments. Additionally, TAB has alleged that other of its members remain at substantial risk of\npenalty. A substantial risk of injury is sufficient under Hunt. See e.g., Pennell v. City of San Jose,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112009\"><a href=\"/opinion/112009/pennell-v-san-jose/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7 n. 3, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112009\"><a href=\"/opinion/112009/pennell-v-san-jose/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Thus TAB satisfies the first prong of the Hunt test.\n\nThe second prong of Hunt requires that TAB's pleadings and the rest of the record demonstrate\nthat the interests TAB seeks to protect are germane to the organization's purpose. TAB was\nchartered to “represent the interests of its members on issues which may impact upon its members'\nbusinesses.” Considering a very similar question in New York State Club Association, the United\nStates Supreme Court held that: “[T]he associational interests that the consortium seeks to protect\nare germane to its purpose: appellant's certificate of incorporation states that its purpose is ‘to\npromote the common business interests of its *448 [member clubs].’ ” 487 U.S. at 10 n. 4, 108\nS.Ct. at 2232, n. 4 (bracketed language in original). Likewise, the interests TAB desires to protect\nare germane to the organization's purpose, and thus the second prong is met.\n\nUnder the third and final prong of the Hunt test, TAB's pleadings and the record must demonstrate\nthat neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested require the participation of individual\nmembers in the lawsuit. The Supreme Court has interpreted this prong as follows:\n\n            [W]hether an association has standing to invoke the court's remedial powers on\n            behalf of its members depends in substantial measure on the nature of the relief\n            sought. If in a proper case the association seeks a declaration, injunction, or\n            some other form of prospective relief, it can reasonably be supposed that the\n            remedy, if granted, will inure to the benefit of those members of the association\n            actually injured.\n\nHunt, 432 U.S. at 343, 97 S.Ct. at 2441 (quoting Warth, 422 U.S. at 515, 95 S.Ct. at 2213).\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Recognizing that the suit raised “a pure question of\nlaw,” and that “the individual circumstances” of any aggrieved member were not in issue, the Court\nheld that the UAW had standing to challenge the government's actions. Id. at 287–88, 290, 106\nS.Ct. at 2531–32, 2533; see also Pennell, 485 U.S. at 7 n. 3, 108 S.Ct. at 855 n. 3 (facial challenge\nto rent ordinance does not require participation of individual landlords). Here, TAB seeks only\nprospective relief, raises only issues of law, and need not prove the individual circumstances of\nits members to obtain that relief, thus meeting the third prong of Hunt.\n\nHaving found that TAB meets all three prongs of the Hunt test, we conclude that TAB has standing\nto pursue the relief it seeks in this case.\n\n\n\n                                                II. Open Courts\n\nTAB contends that the forfeiture provisions of the statutes and regulations in question violate the\nopen courts provision of the Texas Constitution by unreasonably restricting access to the courts.\nAfter the agency has found a party to be in violation of any of these statutes and regulations, the\noffender must either tender a cash deposit or post a supersedeas bond in the full amount of the\npenalties assessed, or forfeit the right to judicial review. 11\n\nHistorically, we have recognized at least three separate constitutional guarantees emanating\nfrom our open courts provision. First, courts must actually be open and operating, so that, for\nexample, the legislature must place every county within a judicial district. Runge & Co. v.\nWyatt, 25 Tex.Supp. 294 (1860). Second, citizens must have access to those courts unimpeded by\nunreasonable financial barriers, so that the legislature cannot impose a litigation tax in the form\nof increased filing fees to enhance the state's general revenue, LeCroy v. Hanlon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2432899\"><a href=\"/opinion/2432899/lecroy-v-hanlon/\"><span class=\"volume\">713</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 342 (Tex.1986). Finally, meaningful legal remedies must be afforded to our citizens, so\nthat the legislature may not abrogate the right to assert a well-established common law cause of\naction unless the reason for its action outweighs the litigants' constitutional right of redress.

In\nLeCroy, for example, the court did not permit increased filing fees for statutory causes of action\nwhile denying them for common law claims. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2432899\"><a href=\"/opinion/2432899/lecroy-v-hanlon/\"><span class=\"volume\">713</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Likewise in Dillingham v. Putnam,\nwhen the court struck down a statute requiring a supersedeas bond as a condition of appeal, the\ncourt did not concern itself with whether the particular appeal being restricted involved a common\nlaw or statutory claim. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3954211\"><a href=\"/opinion/4185149/dillingham-receiver-v-putnam/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3954211\"><a href=\"/opinion/4185149/dillingham-receiver-v-putnam/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1890). Similarly, in the present case, the issue is\nsimply whether the prepayment requirement is an unreasonable financial barrier to access to the\ncourts in light of the state interest involved.\n\nThe stated purpose of the regulatory statutes at issue here is to protect our state's natural\nresources. 13 There is no question that this is an important state interest. 14 The state argues that\nthe prepayment provisions further this interest by increasing the deterrent effect of the penalties\nand by aiding in their collection. The state maintains that a violator will be less deterred by an\nadministrative penalty if it can delay payment without bond while appealing the case in the courts.\nThe state also argues that delay may render the penalty uncollectible, as the violator may become\ninsolvent.\n\nIn considering these rationales, we note that the prepayment provisions actually consist of two\nelements. First, the assessed penalty must be paid, or financial security provided, within thirty\ndays; enforcement is not stayed pending any period of judicial review. 15 Second, if payment is\nnot made or financial security provided within the thirty-day period, the right to judicial review\nis forfeited. We agree that the rationales advanced by the state justify the first of these elements.\nRequiring expeditious payment of the administrative penalties increases their effectiveness. The\nlegislature, however, could have imposed the first element without the second. It could have\nprovided the agency with the right to collection of assessed penalties unless a supersedeas bond\nis posted, yet provided for judicial review. The requirement of immediate payment, without the\ncorresponding forfeiture provision, would not have implicated the open courts provision, as the\ncharged party could have obtained judicial review regardless of payment. This approach would\nhave been in accordance with the usual procedure governing appeals of trial court judgments.\nSee TEX.R.APP.P. 40. Any litigant may appeal without superseding the trial court's judgment,\nbut the mere pendency of an appeal does not stay enforcement of the judgment. 16 *450 Our\nspecific focus for purposes of our open courts analysis, therefore, is not whether the requirement\nof immediate payment is reasonable, but whether the forfeiture of the right of judicial review, if\nthe penalties are not superseded, is reasonable.\n\nWe conclude that the forfeiture provision is an unreasonable restriction on access to the courts.\nWhile the requirement of prepayment or the posting of a bond to stay enforcement furthers the\nstate's important environmental interests by creating a strong incentive for timely payment of\nthe assessed penalties, the forfeiture provision serves no additional interest. 17 The state may\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Jury Trial\n\nTAB also claims that the statutes empowering these agencies to assess civil penalties violate the\nright to a jury trial guaranteed by the Texas Constitution. 19 We disagree.\n\nArticle I, section 15 of our constitution 20 preserves a right to trial by jury for those actions, or\nanalogous actions, tried to a jury at the time the constitution of 1876 was adopted.

Consistent with this noted exception in Credit Bureau, we conclude that these\nagencies' assessments of environmental penalties are not actions, or analogous actions, to those\ntried to a jury at the time the constitution of 1876 was adopted. To hold that these environmental\nstatutes and regulations promulgated in the late 1960s merely parrot common law and statutory\nrights triable to a jury in 1876 would turn a blind eye to the emergence of the modern administrative\nstate and its profound impact on our legal and social order. In the late 19th century, ours was\nprimarily a sparsely-populated agrarian society. See generally, T.R. Fehrenbach, Lone Star: A\nHistory of Texas and the Texans, 279–324 (1983). By contrast, concentrated industrial activity and\nits by-products, including the wide-spread emission of pollutants, with their resulting potential for\nsignificant damage to our natural resources are phenomena of relatively recent origin. In response\nto such phenomena, regulatory schemes, such as those challenged here, were designed to balance\nmounting environmental concerns with our state's economic vitality. In 1876 no governmental\nschemes akin to these existed. 22 Thus, we conclude that the contested proceedings are not\nanalogous to any action tried to a jury in 1876. Accordingly, we hold that no right to a jury\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   11\n\fTexas Ass'n of Business v.

Here, we simply reaffirm what\nthis court held almost a half century ago, in Corzelius v. Harrell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3953637\"><a href=\"/opinion/4184635/corzelius-v-harrell/\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">509</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3953637\"><a href=\"/opinion/4184635/corzelius-v-harrell/\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">961</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1945). In Corzelius, we concluded that certain judicial functions, including fact finding,\nmay be delegated constitutionally by the legislature to administrative agencies in furtherance of\nthe preservation and conservation of the state's natural resources. The decision in Corzelius was\nbased on article XVI, section 59(a) of our constitution, which provides in relevant part: “The\nconservation and development of all the natural resources of this State ... and the preservation and\nconservation of all such natural resources ... are each and all ... public rights and duties; and the\nLegislature shall pass all such laws as may be appropriate thereto.” TEX. CONST. art. XVI, §\n59(a). “By the use of the broad language used in Article XVI, Section 59(a),” the court stated, “the\nLegislature is authorized to enact such laws as are necessary to carry out the purposes for which\nsuch constitutional amendment was adopted.” Corzelius, 186 S.W.2d at 964. 24\n\n [17] There is no doubt that the legislature delegated the power to assess these civil penalties\nto the Air Control Board and the Water Commission as a manifestation of the public's interest\nin preserving and conserving the state's air and water resources. That intent is apparent from the\npolicy statements of the relevant statutes. 25 *452 We conclude, therefore, that the delegation of\nthe fact-finding function by the legislature to the Air Control Board and the Water Commission\nunder this statutory scheme was within the legislature's constitutional authority.\n\nOf course, the fact that no jury trial is provided by the legislature to an alleged violator of these\nenvironmental protection laws does not mean that the agencies' power to assess penalties is\nunbridled. 26 The Air Control Board and the Water Commission may act only within constitutional\nand statutory parameters.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, we reverse that portion of the trial court's judgment declaring that\nsection 4.041 of the Texas Clean Air Act, sections 26.136 and 27.1015 of the Texas Water Code,\nand section 8b of the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act and the rules and regulations promulgated\nunder those statutes comport with the open courts provision of our constitution, article I, section 13.\nWe declare that the requirement of a supersedeas bond or cash deposit paid into an escrow account\nas a prerequisite to judicial review under TEX.HEALTH & SAFETY CODE §§ 361.252(m)\n(first clause), 382.089(c) (first sentence), and TEX.WATER CODE § 26.136(k) (first sentence)\nis unconstitutional.

Our state tops\nthe nation in total toxic emissions and ranks dead last among the fifty states in important measures\nof environmental quality. 1 Although last in air *453 and water cleanliness, Texas today becomes\nthe first state to strike down the imposition of penalties by administrative agencies to enforce\nstatutes protecting the environment. I dissent from today's manipulation of the law to paralyze anti-\npollution efforts, tragically announced at a time when protecting the quality of the air we breathe\nand the water we drink is so critical.\n\nToday's opinion delivers a double whammy to protection of our natural resources.

The constitutional right of trial by jury, already\nsuffering at the hands of this majority, is no longer inviolate; it may be abrogated at any time.\nInstead of walking into a courthouse, where a jury is guaranteed, citizens may be detoured to\nan administrative agency, to explain their problems to bureaucrats not directly answerable to the\ncommunity.\n\nToday precedent and tradition have been trampled as the majority's long-standing fear of ordinary\npeople in our legal system has taken firm hold. The drafters of our Texas Constitution realized\nsomething that the majority has long ceased to appreciate—ordinary Texans can make an\nextraordinary contribution to our system of justice.

Article\nI, section 13 of the Texas Constitution forms the nucleus of this protection:\n\n             *454 The open courts provision specifically guarantees all litigants the right to\n            redress their grievances—to use a popular and correct phrase, the right to their\n            day in court.

The majority today appropriately eliminates the first showing in certain\ncases. In some circumstances the distinction between common law and statutory causes of action\nclearly does not affect whether access to the courts has been denied.\n\nThe second part of the Sax test, however, continues to be applied in all open courts cases. 4 Thus,\nin determining whether the open courts provision of the Texas Constitution is violated by the\nrequirement that administrative penalties be paid as a prerequisite to judicial review, we must\nbalance two competing interests: the right of TAB's members to access to the courts and the state's\nconcern with effective and timely enforcement of its laws protecting the environment. The majority\ntoday restates in rather vague terms this second prong: “whether the prepayment requirement is\nan unreasonable financial barrier to access to the courts in light of the state interest involved.” 852\nS.W.2d at 449. As we held in LeCroy:\n\n\n   Because a substantial right is involved, the legislature cannot arbitrarily or unreasonably\n   interfere with a litigant's right of access to the courts. Thus, the general open courts provision\n   test balances the legislature's actual purpose in enacting the law against that law's interference\n   with the individual's right of access to the courts. The government has the burden to show that\n   the legislative purpose outweighs the interference with the individual's right of access.\n   713 S.W.2d at 341 (citations omitted; emphasis supplied).\nApplying this test, we have permitted certain restrictions on access to the courts, while disallowing\nothers.

The\nmore significant the right the litigant asserts, the more onerous the government's burden becomes.\nTAB has asserted a right to judicial review of penalties imposed against its members. This interest\nis encompassed within the right of access to the courts, which we declared a “substantial state\nconstitutional right.” LeCroy, 713 S.W.2d at 341.\n\nThe State has met its burden by demonstrating a compelling interest in employing administrative\npenalties reflected in constitutionally-guaranteed protection of our state's natural resources.\nAlthough not critical in overcoming an open courts challenge, a constitutional predicate for the\nstate's interest is a highly persuasive factor in the balancing process. As declared in article XVI,\nsection 59(a) 5 :\n\n\n  [T]he preservation and conservation of all ... natural resources of the State are each and all\n  declared public rights and duties; and the Legislature shall pass all laws as may be appropriate\n  thereto.\n  This very mandate of the people, as well as protection of the public health and safety was\n   effectuated in the Clean Air Act, 6 the Texas Water Code, 7 and the Solid Waste Disposal Act, 8\n   including the right to assess administrative penalties. Protection of Texas' air, water and land\n   is undeniably a compelling interest.\n *456 The form of these particular administrative penalties has certainly been fashioned to serve\nthis important state interest through the least restrictive means. Penalty usage is substantially\nlimited and can in no way be said to be arbitrarily imposed. All three statutes at issue require\nthat, once a violation is established, the agency assessing a penalty must consider such factors as\nthe seriousness of the violation, including but not limited to the nature, circumstance, extent, and\ngravity of the prohibited acts; the hazard or potential hazard created to the public health or safety\nof the public; the history of previous violation; the amount necessary to deter future violations; and\nefforts to correct the violation. 9 There is thus statutory assurance that the amount of any resulting\npenalties will be directly related to the conduct.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Unlike the\nfiling fee held violative of the open courts provision in LeCroy, the legislative purpose is not to\nraise money by making it more expensive for citizens to enforce their legal rights. Instead, the\nlegislative objective is to deter and punish violations of the law that pose an environmental threat.\n\nThe wheels of justice grind slowly, with final resolution often years in reaching. Indeed, in\nthis court they sometimes hardly grind at all. Clearly those willing to profit from polluting our\nnatural resources will not hesitate to employ the delays in the judicial system to their advantage.\nA declaration of bankruptcy by a perhaps deliberately undercapitalized corporation during the\npendency of a suit is likely to relieve the polluter of any responsibility to remedy the damage it\nhas caused.\n\nShowing no awareness of the purpose of and need for administrative penalties, the majority finds\nthat “expeditious payment” is adequately guaranteed by the ability of the agency, through the\nattorney general, to initiate an enforcement action to collect the amount assessed. 852 S.W.2d at\n449 & n. 15. In other words, the purpose of immediate deterrence of violation of environmental\nlaws is ensured by the filing of a lawsuit that may take as many years to resolve as this case\nhas. These agencies charged with protecting our natural resources have long had the ability to\nbring an enforcement action in state court. See Tex.Water Code § 26.123; Tex.Health & Safety\nCode § 382.081; id. § 361.224. The effort of the Texas Legislature to improve the effectiveness\nof enforcement through the use of administrative penalties is today rendered a nullity.\n\nGiven the time and expense that must be devoted to pursuing an enforcement action in court, the\nState will have the capability to proceed against only the most egregious wrongs. The vast majority\nof administrative penalties to date have been relatively small, reflecting technical yet important\nstatutory violations. 10 In the absence of an administrative penalty power, most of these would\nhave gone unpunished, even though collectively the environmental impact of small violations\ncould be more profound than a major catastrophe. Relieving polluters from immediate sanctions\ndismantles the effectiveness of our laws protecting natural resources; no lesser means has been\nidentified that provides for prompt enforcement. I would hold that the state has demonstrated a\ncompelling interest in environmental protection that has been implemented by the least restrictive\nmeans, thus overriding any modest impediment that the prepayment of penalties may impose on\naccess to the courts.\n\n *457 Not even the slightest evidence has been provided to this court to suggest any actual\nrestrictive effect. No affidavit of any member of the Texas Association of Business appears in\nthe record stating that an inability to pay an administrative penalty has barred judicial review. As\nto most of the penalties assessed, $5,000 or less in amount, it is doubtful that such a contention\ncould be made. The majority necessarily concludes that imposing fines of $2,000 against Exxon\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Trial by Jury\n\nThe harm caused to our environment by today's writing is equalled only by the severe blow struck\nagainst our fundamental right of trial by jury. In holding that TAB and its members have no right to\na jury trial, the majority employs an analysis that has far-reaching ramifications. While I recognize\nthe need to accommodate the evolution of the administrative state, the history of this important\nguarantee mandates that only the narrowest of exceptions be permitted.\n\nThe ability of each individual to have a case heard by other members of the community is a vital\npart of our heritage and law. Long ago, Texans emphasized the paramount importance of this\nguarantee, stating in their grievances against the Mexican government:\n\n            It has failed and refused to secure, on a firm basis, the right of trial by jury,\n            that palladium of civil liberty, and only safe guarantee for the life, liberty, and\n            property of the citizen.\n\nThe Declaration of Independence of the Republic of Texas (1836), reprinted in Tex.Const.app.\n519, 520 (Vernon 1955). A strong guarantee of this right had been unsuccessfully sought in an\n1833 draft constitution, 22 which was submitted to Mexico by Stephen F. Austin 23 and was later\nincorporated in the 1836 Texas Independence Constitution. 24\n\nThe central role of the jury as a democratic institution was firmly recognized, indeed celebrated,\nin our early jurisprudence by the Supreme Court of the Republic of Texas:\n\n            The institution of jury trial has, perhaps, seldom or never been fully appreciated.\n            It has been often eulogized in sounding *460 phrase, and often decried and\n            derided. An occasional corrupt, or biased, or silly verdict is not enough for\n            condemnation; and when it is said the institution interposes chances of justice\n            and checks against venality and oppression, the measure of just praise is not\n            filled. Its immeasurable benefits, like the perennial springs of the earth, flow\n            from the fact that considerable portions of the communities at stated periods are\n            called into the courts to sit as judges of contested facts, and under the ministry\n            of the courts to apply the laws.... Let us then preserve and transmit this mode of\n            trial not only inviolate, but if possible purified and perfected.\n\nBailey v.

In addition to the previous guarantee, which was carried\nforward in a new Bill of Rights, 26 further protection was included in the Judiciary Article. Tex.\nConst. art. IV, § 16 (1845). While under our national Constitution and those of almost all of our\nsister states trial by jury is available only for those actions that could have been brought at common\nlaw, the Texas Constitution since 1845 has also preserved that right in cases that historically would\nhave been brought in equity. Thus, even when a private party seeks injunctive relief that will\ninure to the public's benefit, any derogation of the right to a jury nonetheless violates the Texas\nConstitution.\n\nUrging support of the additional Judiciary Article guarantee, Convention President Thomas Rusk\ndeclared:\n\n            It is a dangerous principle to trust too much power in the hands of one man.\n            Would it not be better to trust a power of this nature in the hands of twelve men,\n            than to confide it to the breast of one?\n\nWilliam F. Weeks, Debates of the Texas Convention 268 (1846). He was opposed by John\nHemphill, later the first Chief Justice of this court, who actually “preferred the civil law” system,\nid. at 271–73, and Jefferson County delegate James Armstrong, who insisted the new section would\n“operate very injuriously.” Id. at 270. He declared:\n\n            It would be better, in my opinion, to leave it to the legislature to apply these\n            things; it is enough for us to say in the constitution that the trial by jury shall be\n            preserved inviolate. If we intend the jury to determine every thing, it would be\n            better to dispense with the judge altogether, as a useless appendage of the court.\n\nId. Today it is this same fear of juries, fortunately rejected in 1845, that now unfortunately prevails.\n\nThe original language providing for trial by jury in the Judiciary Article of 1845 was retained\nin later constitutions, Tex. Const. art. IV, § 16 (1861), Tex. Const. art. IV, § 20 (1866), but was\nthereafter extended to “all cases of law or equity.” Tex. Const. art. V, § 16 (1869). It took its final\nform in our present Constitution of 1876, which continues to afford not one but two assurances\non this vital subject:\n\n            In the trial of all causes in the District Courts, the plaintiff or defendant shall,\n            upon application made in open court, have the right to trial by jury....\n\nTex.

Rather than keeping it “inviolate,” the majority today severely violates\nthis right.\n\n *461 Our heritage is now rejected by the majority in favor of a deliberately overbroad writing\nthat treats trial by jury as a mere anachronism. This is consistent with the majority's increasing\ndisfavor of decisionmaking by ordinary citizens composed as a jury. 27 Today's opinion insists that\nour constitutional assurance of trial by jury does not offer protection against legislative delegation\nof factfinding to an administrative bureaucracy. In essence, the majority engages in a massive\nredistribution of power from the people to the bureaucratic arm of state government. This extreme\nposition is totally unjustified in view of the staunch legal and historical underpinnings of our\nconstitutional commitment to afford Texans a jury of their peers.\n\nToday's opinion accurately describes one element of the dual constitutional protection for this\nfundamental liberty:\n\n            Article I, section 15 of our constitution preserves a right to trial by jury for those\n            actions, or analogous actions, tried to a jury at the time the constitution of 1876\n            was adopted.\n\n852 S.W.2d at 450 (footnote omitted).

As early as 1860, the Legislature\nacted to penalize polluters, providing that:\n\n\n  If any person ... shall in anywise pollute, or obstruct any water course, lake, pond, marsh or\n  common sewer, or continue such obstruction or pollution so as to render the same unwholesome\n  or offensive to the county, city, town or neighborhood thereabouts, or shall do any act or thing\n  that would be deemed and held to be a nuisance at common law, shall be ... fined in any sum\n  not exceeding five hundred dollars.... 29\nIn an early decision considering whether a criminal nuisance was posed by a tallow factory\nnear Galveston at which cattle were slaughtered and their carcasses and offal were allowed to\naccumulate, this court stated:\n\n            It requires no aid of the common law to convince any one accustomed to pure\n            air, and who has been brought by accident or necessity within the sickening\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Yet the\nmajority ignores the fact that even the earliest of pollution statutes was designed to deter and punish\nthose who harm our environment. Our jury trial article is thus decreed as dependent on form, not\nsubstance; not analogy, but exactitude. Under the majority's analysis, Credit Bureau was wrongly\ndecided since a regulatory prohibition against deceptive non-disclosure or ambiguous language\nwith the capacity to deceive was beyond the “deceptive acts” of common law fraud or deceit as\nit existed in 1876.\n\nSeizing upon the rather obvious proposition that the administrative state had not yet been created\nin 1876, the majority concludes that there is no right to trial by jury in judicial review of an\nadministrative proceeding. But under article I it is the nature of the cause of action that controls,\nnot the procedures under which it is enforced. Each of the three statutes considered today defines\n“pollution” of air, water or land to incorporate early nuisance concepts. Tex.

Nor does Corzelius in any way address the right to jury\ntrial. Under the majority's asserted “narrow” holding, the right to trial by jury can be immediately\nabrogated in any case in which natural resources are even remotely involved, including private\ndisputes that this court has held are subject to jury trial, such as those involving mineral ownership,\ncontract rights, or mineral lease terms.

Both the text of our Constitution and its historical backdrop demand\nthat the right to trial by jury remain “inviolate.” When, as here, however, changing circumstances\nrequire reexamination of the scope of this right in order to preserve the evolved workings of\ngovernment, we must ensure that any exception does not destroy the guarantee. 38 We should\ninstead follow the command of our Constitution in light of our contemporary situation, by limiting\nany exception in the most narrow way possible without completely undermining the administrative\nstate.\n\nI would accordingly clarify any existing exception for administrative proceedings to preserve\nthe right to trial by jury in all suits except those in which the state is enforcing a regulation\nor statute protecting the public. If construed too broadly, however, even this exception limited\nto “public rights” could destroy our traditional reliance on the jury system. 39 Indeed, despite\nthe writing in Atlas Roofing, such erosion has already begun at the federal level. 40 Properly\nlimited, however, a “public rights” administrative exception to the right to trial by jury is both\nconstitutionally sound and easy to apply. While perhaps far-reaching in other contexts, “public\nrights” that conflict with the right of each member of the public to have factual disputes resolved\nby a public jury must be narrowly construed. I would not permit the concept of “public rights”\nto be perverted to deny such a fundamental right. In this limited circumstance, I would define\nproceedings involving “public rights” as those in which the government, as a real party in interest,\nenforces a regulatory or statutory scheme. Contrary to the majority, I do not suggest that we follow\nits standard preference for copying a “federal test,” 852 S.W.2d at 451 n. 24. Rather, I recommend\na narrow and clear Texas standard that looks to Texas law predating Atlas Roofing, and which\nlearns from the misapplication of this doctrine in the federal courts.\n\nHere TAB's members are not entitled to a jury trial because the state is enforcing public regulations\nby imposing administrative penalties. Although this action is analogous to a common law nuisance\nclaim, here the state is protecting the public's right to a clean environment rather than an *467\nindividual's use and enjoyment of private property.\n\nThe right to trial by jury is a critical state constitutional guarantee.

The trumpet call has sounded from the very earliest days of our Republic, heralding our right\nto trial by jury, a clarion to our citizens to shout out to preserve their heritage against attack. It\ndemands that any intrusion on this right be narrow in scope, clearly-announced and thoughtfully\nconsidered. The majority's refusal to define with certainty its erosion of the right to trial by jury\nsounds a weak and shaky chord, reflecting a lack of commitment to this fundamental guarantee.\nAttempting to let the strong note drown the weak, the majority seeks to hide its equivocation by\nreference to my conclusion that a jury trial is not required under these anti-pollution statutes, id.,\nand by criticizing the narrow, clear and thoughtful exception I have drawn today. Id.\n\nThe inviolate nature of the right to trial by jury demands that this vital guarantee be circumscribed\nin only the most extraordinary circumstances and that any exception to it be clearly and narrowly\nconstrued. Although I do not disagree with the result announced by the majority, the analysis\nemployed is designed to destroy one of our most precious freedoms as Texans. The alternative\nI offer would permit our administrative bodies to implement efficiently their regulations, while\nensuring that efficiency concerns do not envelop a fundamental civil liberty. 41\n\n\n\n                                                 III. Standing\n\nThe issue of standing is a stranger to this litigation. No party before this court has ever asserted that\nthe Texas Association of Business lacked capacity to challenge the actions of state government.\nHow rare the occasion when all litigants agree on the proper resolution of an issue, but how truly\nextraordinary is such unanimity when the parties are two state regulatory agencies, the Texas\nAssociation of Business, the Sierra Club and the League of Women Voters. This, nonetheless,\nis the exceptional circumstance in which we find ourselves today as all of these diverse parties\nhave urged the court not to decide this matter in the manner adopted. Addressing the question\nof standing solely at the belated insistence of the majority, all parties asserted that this issue was\nnot in dispute; that, under recent precedent, standing had been waived; 42 and, alternatively, that\nthe record adequately demonstrated the right of the Texas Association of Business under Texas\nlaw to initiate this litigation. Why then does the majority insist on writing? Because it dare not\npass up the opportunity to close access to our courts to those citizens who choose to challenge\nenvironmental degradation, neighborhood destruction and consumer abuse. Through a narrowly\ncrafted test, the majority extends an invitation to TAB to come into the courts while telling other\npublic interest groups to stay out.\n\nWhile devoting over half of today's opinion to a nonissue in this litigation, the majority oddly\nlimits its inquiry to only one of the three organizations asserting standing here. Nothing is said as\nto the League of Women Voters and the Sierra Club, both of which intervened in the trial court\nand were aligned as defendants with the State. Asserting the interests of its members in water and\nair quality, as well as its involvement in protecting the state's natural resources, the League of\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

By completely ignoring whether these groups were proper parties and by embracing a\nfederal standing test hostile to their participation, the majority erects new barriers to deny Texans\naccess to Texas courts.\n\nTo achieve this result, the majority must overcome what, until recently, was viewed as a\nconsiderable obstacle—Texas law. This court has repeatedly held that the issue of standing may\nnot be raised for the first time on appeal, either by the parties or by the court. In Texas Industrial\nTraffic League v.

And what unusual constitutional pillars each of these new finds represents. First, the\nproscription of the separation of powers doctrine against issuance of advisory judicial opinions\nallegedly requires rigorous enforcement of standing even when no party debates its existence. This\nlink between standing and separation of powers is not predicated on any directly relevant prior\ncourt decision, 47 but instead is entirely premised on an article openly antagonistic to standing\nfor environmental groups. 852 S.W.2d at 444, citing Atonin Scalia, The Doctrine of Standing as\nan Essential Element of the Separation of Powers, 17 Suffolk U.L.Rev. 881 (1983). The current\nmajority may be the first in the nation to anchor standing on this constitutional theory.\n\nThe authorities addressing the prohibition on advisory opinions cited in support of this proposition,\nof course, in no way implicate the question of standing. This precedent-setting concern with\nadvisory opinions contrasts markedly with the eagerness to issue this very type of writing within\nthe last year. See Edgewood Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Kirby, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1498384\"><a href=\"/opinion/1498384/edgewood-indep-sch-dist-v-kirby/\"><span class=\"volume\">804</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">491</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 501 (Tex.1991) (Doggett,\nJ., concurring); Carrollton–Farmers Branch Indep.

Writing on an issue not raised by any party, as the majority reaches out to revise\nthe law of standing today, seems to me the very essence of an “advisory” opinion.\n\nThe second newly-announced constitutional basis is equally ironic—our state's vital guarantee\nthat “[a]ll courts shall be open,” Tex. Const. art. I, § 13, in some inexplicable way, mandates that\nthey be closed to some and requires continual judicial monitoring of all who attempt to enter. No\nauthority of any type is cited for this *470 proposition that “open” courts really means “closed”\ncourts. Nothing in the history or text of the provision justifies this reading nor has any Texas court\npreviously attempted such converse interpretation. This constitutional guarantee is used today as a\ntwo-edged sword: the majority invokes the open courts provision to bar environmental groups from\nseeking judicial assistance in enforcing the laws, while in the very same opinion misinterpreting\nthis provision to allow continued violation of statutes protecting our precious natural resources. 48\n\nThen, with a final flourish, standing is conveniently classified as a nonwaivable component of\nsubject matter jurisdiction. Until today, Texas followed the rule, adopted by many of our sister\nstates considering the issue, that objections to a party's standing are waived if not first raised in\nthe trial court. 49 No Texas case is cited for the proposition that standing is part of nonwaivable\nsubject matter jurisdiction because, until today, this court had repeatedly stated precisely the very\nopposite—that standing is not jurisdictional. 50\n\nTexas has with good reason determined that standing is not excepted from traditional rules of\nappellate procedure. Our appellate system is predicated on the requirement of presentation of\ncomplaints to the lower court coupled with preservation and briefing in the reviewing court.

Appellate courts face considerable difficulties in deciding an issue\nnot presented to the trial court; ordinarily, the necessary facts will not be fully developed. The\nunstated effect of today's opinion is to require trial courts to develop facts as to undisputed issues\nor risk subsequent appellate reversal. This is not an effective use of our limited judicial resources.\n\nThe requirement that issues first be presented to the trial court serves another function—preventing\nparties from “laying behind the log”:\n\n            The reason for the requirement that a litigant preserve a trial predicate for\n            complaint on appeal is that one should not be permitted to waive, consent to,\n            or neglect to complain about an error at trial and then surprise his opponent on\n            appeal by stating his complaint for the first time.\n\nPirtle v.

The first concern is that a strict standing rule is necessary to prevent\ncollusive litigation. Under Texas law, the filing of a fictitious suit constitutes contempt by counsel,\nTex.R.Civ.P. 13, and may serve as the basis for a host of sanctions, including dismissal with\nprejudice. Tex.R.Civ.P. 215 2b(5). Nor does our Texas judiciary lack the ability to reject collusive\nlitigation. Felderhoff v.

Adhering to precedent today would in no way undermine the power to dismiss\nfraudulent suits.\n\nThe second virtue proclaimed for today's holding is the guarantee that the lower courts will be\nrestrained from exceeding their jurisdictional powers. 852 S.W.2d at 445. This concern is derived\nsolely from the federal law mandate that a federal appellate court is duty-bound to verify not only\nits own jurisdiction but that of the lower courts as well. Federal courts, however, have limited\njurisdiction; Texas courts do not. Our Texas Constitution creates courts of general jurisdiction,\ninvesting them with all of the “judicial power of this State.” Tex. Const. art. V, § 1. The differences\nare evident in our procedural rules.

Wright, 133 U.Pa.L.Rev. 635, 659 (1985) (“One could\nperhaps be forgiven for confusing standing's agenda with that of the New Right.”).\n\nThe benefits of permitting an association to represent the concerns of its members are manifest.\nAs recognized in United Auto Workers, 477 U.S. at 290, 106 S.Ct. at 2533, “[T]he primary reason\npeople join an organization is often to create an effective vehicle for vindicating interests that\nthey share with others.” Judicial economy is promoted when one litigant can, in a single lawsuit,\nadequately represent many members with similar interests, thus avoiding repetitive and costly\nactions. The wider range of resources often available for associations enhances their effectiveness\nin litigation:\n\n  Special features, advantageous both to the individuals represented and to the judicial system as\n  a whole, ... distinguish suits by associations on behalf of their members.... An association suing\n  can draw upon a pre-existing reservoir of expertise and capital. “Besides financial resources,\n  organizations often have specialized expertise and research resources relating to the subject\n  matter of the lawsuit that individual plaintiffs lack.” ... These resources assist both courts and\n  plaintiffs.\n\nId. at 289–90, 106 S.Ct. at 2532–33. In some cases, an injury that is substantial as to many may have\nan individual financial impact too small to make a challenge economically feasible. Associational\nrepresentation may be the only means of redressing conduct when the harm is limited in degree but\nsubstantial segments of society are affected. Additionally, in challenging policies of government,\norganizations are generally less susceptible than individuals to retaliation by the bureaucrats they\nchallenge.\n\nThese benefits are ignored as the majority declares that henceforth the right of associations to bring\nsuit in Texas courts will be constricted by a three-part federal test set forth in Hunt v.

Despite the fact that the\ntwo provisions are vastly different in language, history and purpose, the majority nonetheless\ndetermines to “look to the more extensive jurisprudential experience of the federal courts” to\ndetermine standing.

The suit was dismissed for lack of standing\nbased upon a rigid construction of the requirement of injury to the association's members. This\ndecision has been widely criticized as significantly impairing the ability of public interest groups\nto represent their members, particularly those that seek to protect this nation's environment and\nnatural resources. 58 Today the majority eagerly positions itself to give the same treatment to\nthose Texans who would petition our state courts to protect the public interest. The majority\nnot only conspicuously relies on Lujan, 852 S.W.2d at 445, but also embraces the extremist\nanti-environmental stance propounded in an article openly critical of judicial opinions permitting\ncitizens to complain of harm inflicted upon our natural resources.

Conclusion\n\nToday the environment is the immediate victim. Those who pollute our rivers, release toxins into\nour air, and damage our land cannot be promptly penalized. Instead, only after the very slow\nwheels of our judicial system have creaked to a stop will violators of environmental protection\nlaws be held accountable.\n\nYet the environment is not the whole story. Much as a river may seem pure and clear even at the\nplace where illegal sewage is being pumped into it, the danger from a court's opinion may not\nbe immediately apparent on its surface. Only after the reasoning is applied in other cases is the\nseverity of the resulting harm to our system of justice revealed. Today's impairment of the ability\nof concerned citizens to vindicate the rights of many in our courts and the majority's knockout\npunch to the right of trial by jury will unfold in future cases to bar participation of ordinary citizens\nin Texas courts.\n\nThe mess in Texas is not only with our environment but with the misinterpretation of the law.\n\n\nGAMMAGE, Justice, concurring and dissenting.\nThough I would prefer not to write separately, I find I am unable to agree entirely with any single\nopinion of the court's other members.

In my\nview, whether or not a suit is a “cause” for purposes of the right to a jury trial is not controlled\nby whether it was first determined by an administrative agency. I also agree with Part III of\nJustice Doggett's opinion relating to standing, which I will further address below. I agree with\nPart II of Justice Cornyn's majority opinion.

This is true even if that “judgment” takes the\nform of an administrative agency decision. Administrative agency decisions, for the most part,\nentitle an appellant to only “substantial evidence” as opposed to de novo review. To further burden\nthose regulated with prepayment of the “judgment” as the only alternative to total loss of even\nsubstantial evidence review violates the basic concept of our constitutional open courts in Texas.\n\nAs to the issue (or non-issue) of standing, the majority in effect adopts the position of federal courts\nthat standing is a jurisdictional question. Otherwise it cannot be fundamental error to be addressed\nwhen no party raises it. Standing was not raised and should not be addressed in this cause.\n\nEven assuming standing is an element of subject matter jurisdiction, the court should not write\non the issue in this case. Even though a judgment is void and subject to collateral attack at any\npoint if there is an absence of subject matter jurisdiction, see *477 Mercer v.

Since the majority concludes\nthere was standing in this case, and since no party raised its existence as an issue, there is no reason\nto address it at all, even if it would be fundamental error if lacking.\n\nThe basis for the majority's discussion is its sudden revelation that “[s]tanding is implicit in\nthe concept of subject matter jurisdiction.” 852 S.W.2d at 443. Their opinion then claims this\nimplication comes from the separation of powers doctrine and the open courts provision of the\nTexas Constitution. It is a curiosity of legal scholarship, however, that in the 156 prior years of\nits existence, this court never before found standing “implicit” in those constitutional provisions,\nbut in fact wrote that standing could be waived and hence was not fundamental error.

Justice Doggett's\nopinion adequately addresses why there is no implication from those provisions that standing is\njurisdictional.\n\nThe majority's struggle to put standing in issue whenit is not prompts me to address two statements\nin its opinion which strike me as either misleading or just plain wrong. The majority asserts,\nwithout citation to authority, that “[s]ubject matter jurisdiction is never presumed,” 852 S.W.2d at\n443–444, and in a footnote repeats that assertion in urging that “Justice Doggett confuses subject\nmatter jurisdiction with personal jurisdiction. Only the latter can be waived when uncontested. See\nTEX.R.CIV.P. 120a.” 852 S.W.2d at 444 n. 5.

These remarks\nare made in an attempt to distinguish the cases cited by Justice Doggett from those of other states\nholding that standing is not jurisdictional. I suppose we should be encouraged to find out that there\nare some types of “standing” that will not be jurisdictional, but it occurs to me that by using the term\n“jurisdictional standing” the court is begging the question—if it is jurisdictional, then it must be\nfundamental. The problem is that the Texas cases, at least as I read them, define “standing” in terms\nof “the party's capacity to sue,” 1 which is one example we are given of non-jurisdictional standing.\nThe majority opinion is calculated—no, guaranteed—to cause confusion because apparently this\ncourt will henceforth tell litigants on a case-by-case basis whether the standing problems in their\ncases are “jurisdictional” or merely formal.\n\nThere is no need to create this confusion. The majority's fomenting it, however, requires that I\naddress it to some extent. I will discuss the “subject matter never presumed” proposition first, then\nweave into the “jurisdictional standing” language.\n\nI agree that subject matter jurisdiction is never presumed in one respect. Subject matter jurisdiction\nexists when the nature of the case falls within a general category of cases the court is empowered\nto adjudicate under the applicable constitutional and statutory provisions.

In this sense, there is no\npresumption because if the case is not one over which the court had constitutional and statutory\nauthority to act one does not “presume” subject matter jurisdiction to make it valid. If a justice of\nthe peace grants a divorce, the judgment is void because that is not the type of case the constitution\nand legislature entrusts to that court, and appellate courts will not “presume” the justice court had\njurisdiction in order to make the judgment valid.\n\nBut what the majority addresses here under the rubric of “standing” is not a court assuming\njurisdiction over a type of dispute for which the statutes do not grant it power. The district court\nundoubtedly had jurisdiction over the declaratory judgment and injunction action brought there,\nsince district courts may entertain declaratory judgment and injunction actions. The question of\nstanding the majority gratuitously addresses here is related to an incidental party issue.\n\nThis court has expressly held that some facts or similar matters relating to party issues are\npresumed. For example, for many years the subject matter jurisdiction for certain trial courts\nas set by the statutes has included a jurisdictional amount, sometimes as a minimum amount in\ncontroversy and sometimes as both a maximum and minimum.

The Clean Air Act, the Solid\nWaste Disposal Act, and the Water Quality Act embody this state's commitment to protect the\nenvironment; and the prepayment requirements struck down today were intended to give force\nto that commitment, not to raise revenue. Without the need to prepay administrative penalties,\npolluters will be left with little if any incentive to timely comply with environmental laws and\nregulations.\n\nThe effects of today's decision, though, extend far beyond the statutes at issue in this case. By\nrejecting these prepayment requirements, without regard to the state interest involved, the majority\nhas struck a severe blow to this state's ability to enforce a broad range of regulations in the\npublic interest. The similar statutory provisions identified in the opinion by Justice Doggett, 852\nS.W.2d at 457, cannot be dismissed as minor technicalities; they are carefully-crafted measures\nthat the legislature considered vital to protect the public from recalcitrant lawbreakers. Casting\nthose provisions aside will seriously disrupt the effective operation of our state government.\n\nThe Texas Constitution cannot be construed in absolutes. The basic right of access to the courts\nmust be balanced against the need to protect the public's health and safety. While the restriction at\nissue in this case may be substantial, I would hold that the public's interest in clean air and water,\ncombined with the due process afforded to TAB's members in the administrative process, tips the\nbalance in favor of the prepayment requirement. I therefore dissent.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    The League of Women Voters and the Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club intervened in the suit and were aligned as defendants with\n        the Texas Air Control Board and the Texas Water Commission. Justice Doggett contends that the standing of the Intervenors should\n        be addressed along with TAB's. We disagree. Standing concerns a party's faculty to invoke the court's subject matter jurisdiction.\n        Once it has been invoked by a plaintiff, a court's subject matter jurisdiction is not affected by the status of defendants or intervenors\n        aligned in interest with defendants.\n2       Act of June 14, 1985, 69th Leg., R.S., ch. 637, § 33, 1985 Tex.Gen.Laws 2350, 2359 (amending Texas Clean Air Act codified\n        at TEX.REV.CIV.STAT.ANN. art. 4.041 (Vernon 1976), currently codified as amended at TEX.HEALTH & SAFETY CODE §\n        382.088; Act of June 15, 1985, 69th Leg., R.S., ch. 795, § 6.001, 1985 Tex.Gen.Laws 2719, 2813 (amending Solid Waste Disposal Act\n        codified at TEX.REV.CIV.STAT.ANN. art. 4477–7 (Vernon 1976), currently codified as amended at TEX.HEALTH & SAFETY\n        CODE § 361.252; Act of June 15, 1985, 69th Leg., R.S., ch. 795, § 5.007, 1985 Tex.Gen.Laws 2719, 2806 (amending TEX.WATER\n        CODE § 26.136).\n3       Although some amendments have been adopted since, they are not relevant to the issue presented in this case.

Only the latter can be waived when uncontested. See\n        TEX.R.CIV.P. 120a.\n6       The analysis is the same under the federal constitution.

From his harsh critique of the doctrine, it seems that he not only objects to the conclusion that standing\n      cannot be waived but also to the conclusion that standing is a requirement to initiate a lawsuit.\n9     Texas Industrial Traffic League relied on two cases to support its holding that standing cannot be raised for the first time on appeal:\n      Coffee v. William Marsh Rice University, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2456695\"><a href=\"/opinion/2456695/coffee-v-william-marsh-rice-university/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">340</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 341 (Tex.1966), and Sabine River Authority v.

We need not overrule these two cases, however, because unlike Texas Industrial Traffic League, we believe that\n      standing was present in the trial court in these cases. Our concern is with a party's right to initiate a lawsuit and the trial court's\n      corresponding power to hear the case ab initio. Standing is determined at the time suit is filed in the trial court, and subsequent events\n      do not deprive the court of subject matter jurisdiction. Carr, 931 F.2d at 1061.\n10    Justice Doggett claims that we overrule three additional decisions of this court. See Central Educ. Agency v.

We disagree. These cases hold that matters not raised in the trial court are waived. One exception noted\n      by these decisions, however, is a lack of jurisdiction which may be raised by a party, or the court, for the first time on appeal. Justice\n      Doggett does not believe that standing falls within that exception because he contends that standing is not jurisdictional.\n11    In most other jurisdictions, such prepayment provisions are required only to stay execution of judgments and are not prerequisites\n      to the right to appeal itself. See Gary Stein, Expanding the Due Process Rights of Indigent Litigants: Will Texaco Trickle Down?,\n      61 N.Y.U.L. REV. 463, 469 (1986).\n12    Thus, contrary to Justice Doggett's reading of our opinion, the Sax test is inapplicable.\n\n13    The Clean Air Act was implemented to “safeguard the state's air resources from pollution by controlling or abating air pollution\n      and emissions of air contaminants....” TEX.HEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 382.002(a). The Texas Water Code was implemented to\n      “maintain the quality of water in the state consistent with the public health and enjoyment ...” TEX.WATER CODE § 26.003.\n14    The importance is evidenced by article XVI, section 59(a) of our constitution, which provides in relevant part that: “The conservation\n      and development of all the natural resources of this State ... and the preservation and conservation of all such natural resources ... are\n      each and all ... public rights and duties.” TEX. CONST. art. XVI, § 59(a).\n15    If the person charged does not make payment or post bond within thirty days, the agency may forward the matter to the attorney\n      general for enforcement. TEX.HEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 382.089(c), § 361.252(m); TEX.WATER CODE § 26.136(k).\n16    It has been argued that our procedure of allowing immediate enforcement of trial court judgments violates federal due process when\n      the judgment debtor is financially unable to post a supersedeas bond and immediate enforcement will cause irreparable injury.

A similar\n      argument could be fashioned under the Texas open courts provision, but TAB does not assert that argument here. TAB's open courts\n      challenge centers not on the requirement of immediate payment, but on the forfeiture of judicial review if payment is not made.\n17    Thus, contrary to Justice Doggett's assertion, we do not strike down the penalties themselves. Nothing in this opinion prohibits the\n      state's collection of assessed penalties. We hold as violative of our open courts provision only the requirement that the penalties be\n      paid as a condition to judicial review. Furthermore, nothing in our opinion requires that penalties already paid be refunded.\n18    That the affected parties may be able to afford prepayment is irrelevant. The guarantee of constitutional rights should not depend\n      on the balance in one's bank account.\n19    TAB claims that the lack of a jury trial before the agency as well as the lack of a trial de novo violate article I, section 15. We limit\n      our inquiry to the absence of a trial de novo because, as this court has said: “Trial by jury cannot be claimed in an inquiry that is non-\n      judicial in its character, or with respect to proceedings before an administrative board.” Middleton v.

Moore sued under the Human Rights Act claiming reverse discrimination\nand, by later amendment, under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (the “UDJA”) seeking\na declaration that the Department acted outside its statutory authority in filling four high-ranking\npositions without examining applicants based on merit. The trial court granted summary judgment\nagainst Moore on the discrimination claim. The trial court also granted partial summary judgment\nin favor of Moore, declaring that the Department acted outside its statutory authority in filling the\nfour positions, and ordered those positions vacated. The Department appeals. In its points of error,\nthe Department challenges (1) the trial court's jurisdiction under section 411.007 of the Texas\nGovernment Code and the UDJA; (2) the trial court's decision to order the four positions vacated;\nand (3) the trial court's discretion in awarding attorney's fees.

Moore sued in\ndistrict court.\n\n[1]    Moore originally brought suit under the Human Rights Act claiming he was the victim\nof reverse racial discrimination when he was denied promotion in favor of Garcia. 1 Moore\nlater amended his petition to include a declaratory judgment claim based upon the Department's\nalleged failure to comply with section 411.007(b) of the Texas Government Code, which\nrequires that the Department make promotions or appointments based upon merit determined\nby examination. See Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 411.007(b) (West 1998). The trial court granted\ncross motions for summary judgment; declaring that the Department failed to comply with all\nthe requirements of section 411.007(b) in promoting Garcia to Assistant Commander of the\nCriminal Intelligence Service, and dismissing Moore's discrimination claim for failure to exhaust\nthe necessary administrative remedies. 2 Moore does not appeal the dismissal of his discrimination\nclaim.\n\nBefore the trial court rendered final judgment, the Department filled the positions of Commander\nof the Criminal Intelligence Service, Commander of Narcotics, and Assistant *153 Commander\nof Narcotics; also by appointment, and also, allegedly, without a competitive examination.

The\ndetermination of jurisdiction under the UDJA is a question of law. See Ainsworth v.

We will look first to the\njurisdiction of the trial court before deciding whether the court erred in entering its order.\n\n\nJurisdiction and the Declaratory Judgments Act\n [3] Enacted in 1943, the UDJA confers on Texas courts the authority to “declare rights, status,\nand other legal relations whether or not further relief is or could be claimed.” Tex. Civ. Prac. &\nRem.Code Ann. § 37.003 (West 1997). The Legislature intended the UDJA to be remedial, to\nsettle and afford relief from uncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights, and to be liberally\nconstrued. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. § 37.002 (West 1997). Describing the subject matter\navailable for relief, the UDJA provides:\n\n            A person interested under a deed, will, written contract, or other writings\n            constituting a contract or whose rights, status, or other legal relations are\n            affected by a statute, municipal ordinance, contract, or franchise may have\n            determined any question of construction or validity arising under the instrument,\n            statute, ordinance, contract, or franchise and obtain a declaration of rights, status,\n            or other legal relations thereunder.\n\nTex.

A justiciable controversy, however, does\nnot necessarily equate with a fully ripened cause of action:\n\n            It is not necessary that a person who seeks a declaration of rights under this\n            statute shall have incurred or caused damage or injury in a dispute over rights and\n            liabilities, but it has frequently been held that an action for declaratory judgment\n            would *154 lie when the fact situation manifests the presence of ‘ripening\n            seeds of a controversy.’ Such appear where the claims of several parties are\n            present and indicative of threatened litigation in the immediate future which\n            seems unavoidable, even though the differences between the parties as to their\n            legal rights have not reached the state of an actual controversy.\n\nAinsworth, 271 S.W.2d at 761.\n\nThe crux of this appeal concerns the application of section 411.007(b) to the advancement\nof personnel within the Department through appointment or promotion. In the section entitled\n“Officers and Employees,” section 411.007(b) provides:\n\n            Appointment or promotion of an officer or employee must be based on merit\n            determined by examination under commission rules that take into consideration\n            the applicant's age, physical condition, experience, and education. Each person\n            who has an application on file for a position in the department shall be given\n            reasonable written notice of the time and place of those examinations.\n\nTex. Gov't Code Ann. § 411.007(b) (West 1998). The Department originally contends that section\n411.007(b) creates no cause of action in Moore, and, therefore, the trial court had no jurisdiction\nto hear the case. The trial court received its jurisdiction from the controversy created by the\nDepartment's application of section 411.007(b) to Moore, not from the words of the statute itself.\nThe UDJA provides for a declaration of rights for persons “whose rights, status, or other legal\nrelations are affected by a statute....” Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. § 37.004 (West 1998).\nJurisdiction under the UDJA primarily depends on the nature of the controversy; whether the\ncontroversy is merely hypothetical or rises to the justiciable level.

The\ncontroversy lies not in the actions of the Department in reviewing Moore's application for Assistant\nCommander of Criminal Intelligence, but in the Department's application of its promotional rules\nto future appointment vacancies. The Department has already taken an adverse stance to Moore's\nposition by allegedly not requiring competitive examinations when filling the initial vacancy. The\nDepartment's repetition of the same behavior in filling three subsequent positions emphasizes the\nactuality of the controversy. There is clearly a justiciable controversy sufficient to invoke the\ncourt's jurisdiction through the UDJA to clarify Moore's, and any other applicant's, rights as they\npertain to the Department's hiring procedure. Furthermore, the trial court's declaration resolves\nthe controversy by informing the Department that its actions in filling Assistant Commander\nand Commander positions without examining applicants based on merit falls outside its statutory\nauthority.\n\n [10] [11] The Department next argues that sovereign immunity shields the Department as an\nagency of the state. The Department argues that the UDJA does not act to waive the State's ordinary\nimmunity from liability. Suits challenging an agency's action as being outside the scope of its\ndelegated authority are not suits against the State requiring legislative or statutory authority. Public\nUtil. Comm'n v. City of Austin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2370201\"><a href=\"/opinion/2370201/puc-of-texas-v-city-of-austin/\"><span class=\"volume\">728</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">907</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 911 (Tex.App.—Austin 1987, writ ref'd n.r.e.).\nBecause Moore's suit under the UDJA sought a declaration that the Department acted outside its\nstatutory authority in appointing various high-level positions without examining applicants based\non merit, no explicit waiver by the State was necessary. Therefore, Moore's suit was not barred\nby sovereign immunity. We hold the trial court had jurisdiction to hear Moore's claim under the\nUDJA and overrule the Department's points of error in that regard.\n\n\nThe Requirement of “Merit–Based” Promotion\n [12] We must now determine whether the trial court erred in holding that the Department\nacted outside its statutory authority when filling the four vacancies. The enabling statutes of\nthe Department clearly provide for merit-based promotion and appointment. See *155 Tex.\nGov't Code Ann. § 411.007(b) (West 1998). That same section further provides for a competitive\nexamination of some sort, and provides that all applicants “shall receive notice of the time and\nplace of such examinations.” Id. While it is true that the statute, under the section entitled “Duties of\nDirector,” reserves for the Director's discretion some positions to be filled by “direct appointment,”\nthe section limits these direct appointments to chiefs of bureaus. See Tex. Gov't Code Ann. §\n411.006(6) (West 1998) (emphasis added). 3 No other positions are mentioned.\n\n[13] Pursuant to section 411.004(3), the Public Safety Commission (the “Commission”)\npromulgated rules governing appointments and promotions.

See 37 Tex. Admin. Code § 1.21(a) (1998). In keeping with the policy of making\nappointments based on merit, the rules provide that “examinations will be conducted for all\npositions excepting unskilled labor, trades, and direct appointments made by the Director.” 37 Tex.\nAdmin. Code § 1.27 (1998) (emphasis added). Reading the rule in conjunction with the statute, the\nrule exempts from competitive examination only unskilled labor, trades, and the chiefs of bureaus.\nHowever, despite the language of the statute restricting directorial appointments to bureau chiefs,\nand despite the Department's own rules advocating the policy of promotions based on merit, the\nDepartment seeks in its General Manual to expand the number of director appointments exempted\nfrom competitive examination:\n\n\n   Positions of major division chief, assistant major division chief, division chief, regional\n   commander, commander, assistant commander, senior Ranger captain, assistant supervisor of\n   Rangers, Director and Assistant Director of Personnel and of Training, other positions deemed\n   necessary and appropriate by the Director and positions of the Director's staff will be filled by\n   direct appointment of the Director.\n   Texas Department of Public Safety General Manual, Chap. 7, § 26.04(4).\n [14] [15] The Department argues that the Assistant Commander and Commander positions are\nexempt from competitive examination by virtue of the discretion granted the Department by statute\ncoupled with the listing of director appointments found in the Department's General Manual. In\nthe alternative, the Department argues that, should the Assistant Commander position be subject\nto competitive examination, the oral interview by Commander Plemons given to applicants should\nsuffice. While we agree with the Department that the statute does provide discretion to the\nCommission and the Department to create its own rules and to define examination based on merit\nfor purposes of promotional appointments, we reject the notion that the Assistant Commander and\nCommander positions are exempt, or that the oral interview could fulfill the statutory requirement\nof a competitive examination. The language of the statute, and that of the Department's own\nrules, clearly envisions a merit-based promotional system for all those positions not specifically\nexempted as director appointments. And, according to statute and the rules promulgated by the\nCommission, Assistant Commander and Commander are not positions so exempted. Furthermore,\nthe mere existence of section 26.04(4) in the Department's General Manual expanding the number\nof exemptions beyond statutory limits both exceeds the Department's authority and belies the\nDepartment's argument that the oral interviews given applicants fulfilled the requirement of a\ncompetitive examination.\n\n [16] Moore argues that the statute contemplates written examinations as the proper manifestation\nof competitive examinations. To the extent that Moore seeks affirmation from this Court for his\nposition, we reject it. The Department maintains the discretion to *156 create procedures for\ncompetitive examinations regarding promotive appointments, provided such procedures make\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The Department should bear in mind, however, that the written notice requirements of\nthe statute regarding a stated time and location for the competitive examination seem to mandate\nsome type of formalized and structured examination. 5 See Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 411.007(b)\n(West 1998).\n\n\nThe Injunctive Order\n [17] The Department next contends that even if the trial court had jurisdiction to declare that\nthe Department failed to comply with section 411.007(b) in hiring Garcia and the others without\nresort to competitive examination, the trial court had no jurisdiction, or, alternatively, abused its\ndiscretion, in ordering the Department to vacate the four positions contested by Moore. We note\ninitially that actions under the UDJA are sui generis; they are unique in that the declarations of\n“rights, status and other legal relations” are not truly legal or equitable. See Cobb v. Harrington,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3971414\"><a href=\"/opinion/4200368/cobb-v-harrington/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">360</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3971414\"><a href=\"/opinion/4200368/cobb-v-harrington/\"><span class=\"volume\">190</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">709</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 713 (Tex.1945); see also Texas Liquor Control Bd. v.

We further note that, at the time of the\ntrial court's rendition of final judgment, Moore's discrimination claim had been dismissed through\nsummary judgment; thus the trial court's authority to act was based on the UDJA alone. Moore\nargues that the UDJA allows the trial court to grant the injunctive relief requested, namely the\nvacation of the four positions, as ancillary to the declaratory relief awarded. See Tex. Civ. Prac.\n& Rem.Code § 37.011 (West 1998); see also Davis v. Pletcher, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2430972\"><a href=\"/opinion/2430972/davis-v-pletcher/\"><span class=\"volume\">727</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 35 (Tex.App.—\nSan Antonio 1987, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Under the facts presented here, we disagree.\n\n [18] As Moore suggests, the UDJA allows for injunctive relief ancillary to a declaration of rights\nin some situations: “[F]urther relief based on a declaratory judgment or decree may be granted\nwhenever necessary or proper. The application must be by petition to a court having jurisdiction\nto grant relief.” Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code. Ann. § 37.011 (West 1998). 6 This power to grant\nancillary relief is conditioned on such relief being necessary and proper. For the following reasons,\nsuch relief in this case is inappropriate.\n\n [19] Regarding Moore's original reverse discrimination claim, filing a complaint with the Human\nRights Commission and exhausting administrative remedies was a mandatory prerequisite to filing\na civil action alleging a violation of the Human Rights Act under the Texas Labor Code. Schroeder\nv. Texas Iron Works, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1534738\"><a href=\"/opinion/1534738/schroeder-v-texas-iron-works-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">813</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 488 (Tex.1991). The rationale for this result is that\nthe Human Rights Act provides the exclusive remedy for alleged discrimination in administrative\nagency personnel decisions. See Stinnett v.

Thus, Moore's failure to exhaust his administrative\nremedies was a jurisdictional bar to filing a discrimination claim in district court, and the trial\ncourt properly granted summary judgment against Moore's claim.

See Tex. Labor Code Ann. § 21.210 (West 1996). This\nprovision represented Moore's exclusive injunctive remedy until his administrative remedies had\nbeen exhausted. Moore could have sought an injunction to halt the Department from promoting\nGarcia and the other three appointments had he followed the proper administrative procedures.\nHe failed to do so. He sought and received in district court a declaration that the Department\nhad misinterpreted and misapplied section 411.007(b). This declaration clarified Moore's rights\nand status regarding future vacancies in the Department. However, the order by the trial court\nretroactively vacating the four Assistant Commander and Commander positions rewarded Moore\nfor failing to follow the exclusive remedies provided for him by law. Declaratory relief creates\nno substantive rights. State v.

Because the exclusive remedy available to Moore regarding his reverse discrimination\nclaim is the Human Rights Act, which contains the right to injunctive relief, the trial court erred in\nvacating the positions in the Department based solely on the ancillary injunctive power contained\nin the UDJA.\n\nFurthermore, the trial court's order undercut the purpose of the Human Rights Act to create a\ncomprehensive administrative review. See Stinnett, 858 S.W.2d at 577. The Human Rights Act\nwas intended to embody the policies embedded in Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq., including\n“administrative procedures involving informal conference, conciliation and persuasion, as well as\njudicial review of administrative action.” Schroeder, 813 S.W.2d at 487. Allowing the jurisdiction\ncreated by the UDJA to circumvent the procedures and remedies provided by the Human Rights\nAct could create a back door to district court not contemplated by the Legislature. The proper\nremedy for Moore is prospective. His declaratory judgment carries preclusive effect in any future\nlawsuit, whether administrative or judicial, should the Department fail to offer him notice and\nthe opportunity for merit-based promotion as required by section 411.007(b). See Valley Oil\nCo. v.

Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. § 37.009 (West\n1997). The Texas Supreme Court has expressly held that “by authorizing declaratory judgment\nactions to construe the legislative enactments of governmental entities and authorizing awards of\nattorney fees, the [U]DJA necessarily waives governmental immunity for such awards.” Texas\nEduc.

Since we have held that the trial court had jurisdiction to construe section\n411.007(b) and that the trial court's construction of that statute favors Moore, Moore has achieved\na declaration *158 of rights entitling him to seek the additional relief of attorney's fees. See\nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. § 37.009 (West 1997). The Department's argument fails. The\nDepartment also objects to the award of attorney's fees in the final judgment based upon affidavits\nof the competing parties, claiming that the affidavits do not represent competent evidence that\nthe attorney's fees were reasonable and necessary.

We further affirm the order of the trial court\nawarding attorney's fees. We reverse the order of the trial court vacating the four Assistant\nCommander and Commander positions and hold that Moore's only injunctive relief must be\nprospective.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1    The relevant statute provides:\n            An employer commits an unlawful employment practice if because of race, color, disability, religion, sex, national origin, or\n            age the employer:\n            (1) fails or refuses to hire an individual, discharges an individual, or discriminates in any other manner against an individual in\n            connection with compensation or the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment; or\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In three issues, Transcontinental generally contends: (1) the trial\ncourt erred in granting declaratory relief because no justiciable controversy existed and because\nOrix had previously filed, but abandoned, a breach of contract claim raising the same contentions,\n(2) the declaratory judgment act did not authorize the award of attorneys' fees in this case, and (3)\nthe attorneys' fees award was improper because Orix did not segregate the fees expended on the\ndeclaratory judgment claim from fees expended on the abandoned breach of contract claim. For\nthe following reasons, we vacate the trial court's judgment and dismiss the cause.\n\nThis suit involves a Guaranty in which Transcontinental guaranteed payment of attorneys' fees\nOrix expended in a suit against a Transcontinental subsidiary, TCI 9033 Wilshire Boulevard, Inc.\n(TCI). TCI was the owner of commercial real estate subject to a mortgage loan serviced by Orix.\nA dispute arose as to whether Orix could require that TCI purchase terrorism insurance. Orix\ndemanded that TCI purchase *243 such insurance and TCI refused. Orix then declared the loan\nin default and began charging interest at the default rate. TCI filed suit for breach of contract and\ndeclaratory relief. Orix counterclaimed—also for breach of contract and declaratory relief.\n\nMeanwhile, a third party sought to purchase the TCI property. The mortgage documents required\nOrix to consent to any sale of the property. Before Orix would consent, it required TCI's parent\ncompany, Transcontinental, to guarantee any attorneys' fees that might be awarded to Orix in the\nTCI litigation, which was to continue. To facilitate the sale, Transcontinental agreed and signed\nthe Guaranty.\n\nOrix ultimately prevailed in the underlying litigation and obtained a judgment against TCI that\nincluded $241,380.39 in attorneys' fees as well as appellate costs and fees in the event TCI\nunsuccessfully appealed. TCI did appeal that judgment. A few months later, while the appeal\nwas pending, Orix filed the instant suit. In its original petition, Orix alleged Transcontinental\nbreached the Guaranty. Specifically, Orix contended that after the TCI judgment was signed, it\nmade a demand upon Transcontinental to “comply with its obligations” under the agreement,\nbut Transcontinental refused to “accept” its responsibilities and indebtedness created under the\nGuaranty. As damages, it alleged the $241,380.39 that had been awarded, as well as any additional\nappellate attorneys' fees that might later be incurred in the TCI appeal if Orix prevailed.\n\nTranscontinental answered with a general denial and also asserted the affirmative defense of\nduress asserting the Guaranty was unenforceable. Transcontinental also filed a motion to abate\nor stay asserting the trial court should not determine the validity of the Guaranty until the TCI\nappeal was resolved because no determination could be made as to whether it was liable until\nTranscontinental's liability was first finally resolved.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In its First Amended Petition, Orix sought a global declaration\nthat the Guaranty was valid and enforceable and that Transcontinental was obligated to pay Orix\nall expenses, attorneys' fees, and other costs incurred at all levels of litigation of the TCI lawsuit\nas well as in any separate proceeding.\n\nOrix filed a motion for summary judgment asserting the Guaranty was valid as a matter of law and\nwas not procured by duress. Orix stated it was seeking a determination that Transcontinental was\nliable for the attorneys' fees ultimately awarded if they were affirmed on appeal. It asserted the\npendency of the appeal in the underlying judgment should not prevent it from obtaining declaratory\nrelief because it was not seeking to recover any attorneys' fees from the TCI lawsuit yet, but was\nonly seeking a declaration of liability for such fees (and all additional appellate fees in that case)\n“if and when” the TCI appeal was concluded in Orix's favor. Orix also expressly requested the\ntrial court to “extinguish” all affirmative defenses to the Guaranty. Transcontinental responded to\nthe motion asserting the trial court lacked jurisdiction because whether any controversy about the\nGuaranty existed was not ripe for review.\n\nThe trial court granted declaratory relief declaring the Guaranty “valid and enforceable” to\nwhich Transcontinental had “no viable affirmative defense.” The court also declared that\nTranscontinental was obligated to pay all attorneys' fees and costs awarded to Orix in the TCI\nlitigation at all levels. In this appeal, Transcontinental asserts the trial court erred in *244 granting\ndeclaratory relief because validity of the Guaranty did not present a justiciable issue.

See id. at 443.\n\n [8] The declaration sought in this case concerned validity of a Guaranty for payment for attorneys'\nfees awarded to Orix from TCI in underlying litigation. The Guaranty obligated Transamerica to\npay these fees to Orix if TCI did not. Because Transcontinental's liability under the Guaranty in this\ncase would arise only if TCI was found liable for attorney's fees, its liability can be compared to\nliability that arises in indemnity cases. In Firemen's Insurance Co. v. Burch, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1761674\"><a href=\"/opinion/1761674/firemens-ins-co-of-newark-new-jersey-v-burch/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">331</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 332\n(Tex.1968), the Texas Supreme Court held that a trial court cannot determine a claim for indemnity\nbefore liability is established in the underlying case because any such opinion would be purely\nadvisory.

Specifically, the\nCourt held “the duty to indemnify is justiciable before the insured's liability is determined in the\nliability *245 lawsuit when the insurer has the duty to defend and the same reasons that negate\nthe duty to defend likewise negate any possibility the insurer will ever have a duty to indemnify.”\nGriffin, 955 S.W.2d at 84 (emphasis in original). It reasoned that under those circumstances, “no\nfacts could be developed” in the underlying tort suit that could alter the court's conclusion no duty\nto indemnify existed. Id.\n\nHere, Orix was seeking a general declaration of validity of the Guaranty and lack of viable\ndefenses. Orix pleaded it was entitled to declaratory relief because Transcontinental had failed\nto “acknowledge” its liability under the Guaranty and because, in response to its abandoned\nbreach of contract claim, it had pleaded duress. It was not seeking guidance with respect to what\nwas then currently required under the Guaranty.

In its motion for summary judgment, Orix admitted that\nTranscontinental's liability was triggered “assuming the Final Judgment is affirmed on appeal.”\nIt complained Transcontinental did not “acknowledge” its responsibility “in the event” the trial\ncourt's judgment is affirmed. Orix thus admits that if the underlying judgment was reversed,\nthe entire proceedings—in the trial court and in this court—would be completely meaningless.\nFurther, the declaration sought—and the declaration given—was that Transcontinental was\nresponsible for any fees awarded in the TCI litigation at all trial and appellate levels. Thus, the trial\ncourt declared Transcontinental's liability for fees that had yet to even be expended. Moreover,\nthis case concerned a guarantee of payment for fees TCI incurred and was liable for. Future events\ncould certainly alter TCI's willingness or ability to pay its fees itself. Any such payment by TCI\nwould effect Transcontinental's liability on the Guaranty.\n\n [9] Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Orix's attempt to “extinguish” any defenses to the\nGuaranty and get a declaration that no defenses existed was not proper. According to Orix's\nrationale, Transcontinental should be forced to litigate any potential defenses it might have to\nliability before liability has even been established. A defendant may not use a declaratory judgment\nto prematurely adjudicate defenses to liability that may not yet exist. Cf. Calderon v.

Triton presents fourteen issues\nfor appellate consideration. In its first seven issues, Triton argues that (1) the trial court erred in\ngranting summary judgment in favor of StarTex on its breach of contract claim because (2) the\ntrial court misinterpreted and misapplied the law applicable to the claims and defenses asserted\nby the parties; (3) StarTex's summary judgment evidence did not establish that it was entitled\nto judgment as a matter of law on its breach of contract claim; (4) Triton's summary judgment\nevidence raised genuine issues of material fact as to one or more elements of StarTex's breach of\ncontract claim; (5) genuine issues of material fact existed as to Triton's claims for offset and credit\nbased on StarTex's use of improper and incorrect billing and StarTex's use of estimated billing; (6)\ngenuine issues of material fact existed as to StarTex's billing practices and procedures and whether\nthose procedures constituted a breach by StarTex of the parties' contract; and (7) genuine issues\nof material fact existed regarding whether Triton objected *47 to StarTex's billing practices and\nprocedures and to invoices submitted to Triton by StarTex and whether StarTex failed to fulfill its\nlegal obligations for handling such complaints.\n\nTriton further argues that (8) StarTex's failure to comply with the legal requirements for handling\ncomplaints concerning retail electric service and Triton's pending complaint against StarTex\nbefore the Texas Public Utility Commission acted to stay the judgment and enforcement of the\njudgment. Triton attacks the trial court's damages award, arguing that the trial court erred in\nawarding StarTex (9) liquidated damages pursuant to the early termination provisions in the\ncontract because such an award constitutes an impermissible and unenforceable penalty; (10)\nearly termination fee damages based on unidentified and unproven monthly billings; (11) early\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

StarTex\nagreed to supply Triton with electricity, and Triton agreed to pay at a fixed rate for a term of twelve\nmonths. Regarding invoicing and payment, the ESA provided that\n\n             [StarTex] shall render to Customer [Triton] on a monthly basis, or as mutually\n             agreed by [StarTex] and Customer but not less frequent than monthly, an invoice\n             that is due and payable fifteen (15) days from the date of the invoice. If the\n             payment of all undisputed amounts is not received by the due date, Customer\n             will be charged a late fee equal to five percent (5%) of the past due amount.\n             Customer must provide to [StarTex] written notice setting forth in particular\n             detail any disputed amount, including the calculations with respect to any errors\n             or inaccuracies claimed. If it is subsequently determined that Customer owes\n             [StarTex] any portion of the disputed amount, Customer shall remit to [StarTex]\n             within five (5) business days following such resolution the outstanding balance\n             plus interest .... Any amounts that may have been overpaid or underpaid shall\n             be applied to the next monthly invoice.\n\nThe ESA also contained the following language:\n\n   Early Termination Fee. In the event that Customer terminates this agreement or Customer\n   defaults as described [below], then an Early Termination Fee will be assessed. The Early\n   Termination Fee shall be equal to the greater of a) the three months highest bills for Customer or\n   b) any mark to market costs.

StarTex asserted that Triton owed\nit $319,094.11, consisting of unpaid utility service and contractual fees, interest, and liquidated\ndamages.

Triton generally denied StarTex's allegations and asserted\nthat the liquidated damages provision was invalid and unenforceable and that the attorney's fees\nsought were not reasonable and necessary.\n\nTriton also asserted that\n\n             the account on which [StarTex] sues ... is not just and true, and all just and\n             lawful offsets, payments, and credits have not been applied to [Triton's] account.\n             [Triton] does not owe [StarTex] $319,094.11 in damages, because [StarTex]\n             seeks to recover $197,323.95 in damages based on an invalid liquidated damages\n             provision. Furthermore, based on the inaccuracies in [StarTex's] billing and\n             estimates since 2007, [Triton] also challenge[s] [StarTex's] allegation that [it\n             owes] $105,034.18 to [StarTex] for services rendered.\n\nAttached to its answer, Triton provided the affidavit of Bill Bird, who averred:\n\n             I am responsible for and have knowledge of Triton's business dealings with\n             Plaintiff [StarTex]. Triton began doing business with Plaintiff in 2006. In the\n             summer of 2007, Plaintiff began providing usage estimates to Triton, which\n             reflected very high usage. Triton brought this issue to Plaintiff's attention,\n             and the *50 issue was not resolved. Triton contests the validity of Plaintiff's\n             account, and denies that it owes $105,034.18 to Plaintiff for services rendered.\n\nOn January 20, 2010, StarTex moved for summary judgment on its breach of contract claim.\nStarTex argued that the parties had a valid contract and that the First and Second Amendments of\nthe contract required Triton to pay for the electricity received under the MCPE pricing schedule\nthrough May 2011. Copies of the ESA and First and Second Amendments were attached as\nsummary judgment evidence. StarTex stated that “[t]he MCPE is a variable rate plan wherein the\nprice changes every fifteen (15) minutes to reflect the supply and demand for power in a particular\nmarket.”\n\nStarTex argued,\n\n             Due to the numerous price changes involved in an MCPE contract, StarTex\n             had to customize its purchase to fit the particular consumption needs of Triton.\n             Every customer's consumption needs differ, and StarTex must carefully time\n             its purchases so that it has sufficient power for the customer during their peak\n             usage hours and so that it does not over-purchase during down times.

Therefore, in order to service Triton's Contract,\n             not only did StarTex commit to purchase sufficient power to cover the life of\n             the Contract, but it also committed to make purchases every fifteen (15) minutes\n             that mirror the kWh used by Triton during each fifteen (15) minute interval.\n\nThis argument was supported by the affidavit of Stephen Madden, the Senior Vice–President of\nSupply for StarTex.\n\nStarTex asserted that it provided power to Triton throughout the term of the contract and submitted\ninvoices to Triton “based on meter reads performed by CenterPoint Energy (“CenterPoint”), the\nTransmission and/or Distribution Services Provider (“TDSP”) for the Houston area.” StarTex\nfurther argued that:\n\n             On several occasions, StarTex was required to generate [Triton's] monthly\n             invoice using estimated reads based on historical usage. This was a result of\n             CenterPoint being unable to gain access to [Triton's] meters to obtain the actual\n             usage amounts. All such estimated reads were reconciled on subsequent invoices\n             once CenterPoint obtained access to the meters, such that the final invoice\n             reflected only actual usage. All estimated reads and subsequent reconciliations\n             were detailed on [Triton's] monthly invoices.\n\nStarTex provided invoices and the affidavit of Robert Verhage, the Director of Credit and\nCollections for StarTex, substantiating these arguments. Verhage averred that the invoices\nattached as summary judgment evidence were true and correct copies of Triton's monthly invoices.\nVerhage testified that, after Triton terminated the ESA on approximately October 19, 2008,\n“StarTex generated one final invoice that contained the final, outstanding balance that was\nreconciled to correct all estimated reads.” The final invoice reflected that Triton owed $155,034.18,\nand Verhage averred that Triton subsequently made $50,000.00 in payments, leaving $105,034.18\ndue and owing. Thus, StarTex argued that Triton breached the ESA *51 when it failed to pay for\n$105,034.18 worth of electricity provided under the ESA and subsequent amendments.\n\nStarTex also asserted that Triton breached the ESA when it terminated the ESA early. StarTex\nstated in its motion, and Madden averred in his affidavit, that when StarTex entered into the Second\nAmendment extending the terms of the ESA through May 2011, it contracted with the electricity\nproducer “to purchase enough power to service the entire thirty-six (36) month term of the Second\nAmendment and the purchases were tailored to fit Triton's particular ‘shape’.” Thus, the ESA\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

It\nargued that, under its fee agreement with its counsel, it would incur attorney's fees “in an amount\nequal to twenty-five percent (25%) of all amounts recovered from [Triton],” or $75,589.36, and\nthat this amount was reasonable and necessary. The summary judgment motion was accompanied\nby the affidavit of Rodney Drinnon, counsel for StarTex, who averred to the specific services\nprovided by his firm and stated that the services described were reasonable and necessary and that\n“twenty-five percent (25%) is a reasonable contingency fee for the services provided.”\n\nOn January 28, 2010, Triton amended its answer, adding claims that StarTex “materially breached\nthe contract, which was modified by agreement,” that Triton “complied with the terms of the\nmodified contract,” that Triton was “discharged from performing under the contract after [StarTex]\nmaterially breached same,” and that StarTex failed “to mitigate its damages as required under\napplicable law, limitation of warranty, limitation of liability, laches, and waiver.” Triton also\nsought a continuance of the summary judgment hearing, which the trial court granted.\n\nOn April 5, 2010, Triton responded to StarTex's summary judgment motion. Triton did not contest\nStarTex's statements that the ESA and subsequent amendments were valid contracts. However,\nTriton asserted that StarTex “made several promises to [Triton] and [orally] modified the terms of\nthe parties' agreements.” Triton argued that Michael Gary, Triton's property manager, “had several\ndiscussions with John Bejger, a representative of StarTex, relating to StarTex's estimated usage\nand Triton's disputes over *52 the StarTex invoices.” As supported by Gary's affidavit in Triton's\nsummary judgment evidence, Gary represented to Bejger that the practice of estimating electricity\nusage for several consecutive months was causing damage to Triton because Triton could not\nbill its tenants based on estimated billing. Gary also averred that Triton had “done everything\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.               8\n\fTriton 88, L.P. v.

Triton's response asserted that Gary's affidavit about his discussions\nwith Bejger raised a disputed issue of material fact as to whether there was a meeting of the minds\nin reaching a valid modification.\n\nTriton also argued that it was excused from performing under the ESA based on StarTex's material\nbreach of the agreements “when it failed to provide [Triton] with accurate and correct billings for\nthe electricity that it actually delivered.” Triton's motion referenced the invoices sent by StarTex\nand provided details regarding which specific invoices were based on estimated usage, including\nseveral instances in which it was invoiced based on estimated usage in consecutive months.\n\nTriton presented Gary's affidavit, averring that Gary first contacted StarTex to resolve the\nbilling problems during the original term of the ESA and that StarTex responded by saying\nthat CenterPoint could not access and read the electricity meters in Triton's buildings. Triton\nincluded in its summary judgment evidence various e-mails between Gary and StarTex in which\nGary raised questions and disputes over the amounts billed in the invoices and StarTex provided\ninformation reconciling its charges. Gary's e-mails did not contain any specific calculations or\namounts with regard to the alleged errors or inaccuracies. StarTex's e-mail reflects that it sent\nTriton a spreadsheet demonstrating how StarTex reconciled the bills and comparing Triton's\nusage and rates. Triton also included an e-mail from CenterPoint to StarTex, received in response\nto StarTex's inquiry regarding the difficulty of getting actual meter readings. The CenterPoint\nrepresentative stated,\n\n             I disagree that CenterPoint is at fault for the estimations. Triton does not provide\n             us unencumbered, permanent, ongoing access to our meters. The estimation\n             reasons are specific to each address, but on some accounts Triton has their meters\n             locked inside a mechanical room to which we're supposed to go track down\n             an employee and a key, apparently unsuccessfully at times, perhaps because\n             the right employee can't be found. On other accounts, we're supposed to enter\n             through a locked gate where the gate code we have on record has been changed.\n             Triton has a responsibility to keep us updated if access arrangements change.\n\nTriton's summary judgment evidence also included the affidavit of Jim Phillips, the Vice President\nof IEA Engineering, an energy engineering company. Phillips stated that he reviewed StarTex's\nbilling invoices and Triton's historical electricity usage. He averred that he found\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

These\n   errors include, without limitation:\n\n   • several errors in math (multiplication of energy consumption by the cost of energy);\n\n   • excessive estimated energy readings;\n\n   • estimated energy readings at one site (meter) while the next site (meter) was actually read in\n      the same month, again repeatedly;\n\n   • three meters had a monthly load factor greater than 100%, which is an impossibility (LF is\n      the maximum demand used over hours of the month—over 100% is more hours than in that\n      month);\n\n   • several examples where the ending energy reading of one month did not match the beginning\n      reading of the next month;\n\n   • energy costs are not consistent across meters in the same month;\n\n   • multiple corrections from earlier months' estimated energy reading make analysis difficult; and\n\n   • it is improbable that back to back months would have the same exact energy consumption\n      readings and that demand would remain the same for several months in a row.\n\nPhillips provided his opinion about other errors and problems with StarTex's billing practices,\nwithout providing specific contested amounts, and concluded:\n\n             In summary, the total value of the errors I analyzed came to almost $97,000.00.\n             This is not an inclusive value and with additional time to review the invoices\n             and billing, this amount should significantly increase. The numbers and values\n             I used assume that StarTex's numbers were correct; however, I found that some\n             of these numbers and values were not correct when compared to each other. To\n             this amount and the other uncalculated errors, taxes must be added since they\n             are a percentage of the energy and [TDSP] charges. The error value is therefore\n             compounded.\n\nThus, Triton argued that it “created a fact issue on each element of [its] affirmative defense” of\nprior material breach and that it raised a fact issue regarding whether StarTex conclusively proved\nthe proper amount of damages.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

StarTex presented the affidavit of John\nBejger, contesting Gary's representations that the parties entered *54 into an oral modification\nof their agreement. StarTex also argued that, “because the TDSP [CenterPoint], not StarTex, is\nsolely authorized by the State of Texas to provide actual and estimated readings [,] Bejger would\nnot have made” any representations regarding discontinuing the use of estimated meter readings in\nthe monthly invoices. Finally, StarTex argued that the parties entered into the Second Amendment\nafter the alleged oral representations and thus Triton's argument that Texas law allows modification\nof a written agreement by later oral representations was inapplicable.\n\nStarTex also argued that it did not breach the ESA. Specifically, StarTex argued that Phillips,\nTriton's energy engineer expert, did not specifically identify any breach by StarTex. StarTex\nargued that it was permitted by the ESA and Texas law to bill Triton based on estimated usage;\nthat, under the terms of the ESA, it is irrelevant why CenterPoint provided Triton's estimated usage\nrather than actual usage; and that Triton did not follow the contractual provisions requiring it to\npay undisputed portions of the invoice and to set forth in detail “calculations with respect to any\nerrors or inaccuracies claims.”\n\nStarTex again argued that the liquidated damages provision was enforceable. Finally, StarTex\nargued that its original demand to Triton was not excessive, and thus that ground did not preclude\nit from recovering attorney's fees.\n\nOn April 16, 2010, following the summary judgment hearing, Triton filed its “Supplemental\nResponse” to StarTex's summary judgment motion.

Triton also\nobjected to the affidavit of John Bejger, attached to StarTex's reply to Triton's response.\n\nOn April 26, 2010, the trial court granted StarTex's motion. The trial court's order stated that it\nconsidered “the Motion, the response, the pleadings, the affidavits, other evidence on file with\nthe Court, and arguments of counsel.” The trial court awarded StarTex $105,034.18 “as actual\ndamages for [Triton's] failure to pay for electricity provided by [StarTex].” The trial court awarded\nStarTex $197,323.25 “as liquidated damages for [Triton's] early termination of the [ESA].”\nFinally, the trial court awarded StarTex $12,000 as reasonable and necessary attorney's fees, as\nwell as additional attorney's fees conditioned on an unsuccessful appeal by Triton.\n\nOn May 12, 2010, StarTex moved for a turnover order.\n\nOn May 25, 2010, Triton moved for reconsideration or a new trial. Triton supported this motion\nwith new affidavits from Jim Phillips, Michael Gary, and Montague Morgan, attorney for Triton,\nwho attempted to authenticate documents attached to Phillips' affidavit. StarTex objected to and\nmoved to strike these affidavits on the ground that Triton did not timely file them and on the\nground that Gary's affidavit was not based on his personal knowledge and was made in bad faith.\nThe trial court granted StarTex's motion and struck the affidavits of Phillips, Gary, and Morgan\nthat were attached to Triton's motion for new trial. 1\n\n *55 On June 21, 2010, the trial court denied Triton's motion for reconsideration/new trial and\nstated that it did not consider the stricken affidavits. On July 6, 2010, the trial court signed a\nmodified order stating:\n\n   On this day, after hearing [Triton's] Motion for Reconsideration/New Trial (“Motion”), the\n   Court, relying solely [on] the summary judgment evidence on file, arguments of counsel and\n   without considering the stricken, untimely supplement filed by [Triton], is of the opinion that\n   [Triton's] Motion should be, in all things, DENIED.\n\n   It is therefore ORDERED, ADJUDGED and DECREED that [Triton's] Motion is denied and\n   that the Court's order of April 26, 2010, granting Plaintiff's Traditional Motion for Summary\n   Judgment is hereby, in all things, REAFFIRMED.\n\nOn July 28, 2010, the trial court signed an order granting StarTex's motion for a turnover order\nand appointing a receiver.

When reviewing a motion for summary judgment, we take\nthe nonmovant's evidence as true, indulge every reasonable inference in favor of the nonmovant,\nand resolve all doubts in favor of the nonmovant. Id.\n\nIn its first through seventh issues, Triton argues that the trial court erred in granting summary\njudgment in favor of StarTex on its breach of contract claim. The trial court awarded StarTex\nsummary judgment on both grounds of StarTex's breach of contract claim against Triton: that\nTriton breached (1) by failing to pay the invoices for electricity provided and (2) by wrongfully\nterminating the contract early.\n\n\nB. Summary Judgment on StarTex's Breach of Contract Claim for Triton's Failure to Pay\nfor Invoiced Electricity\nIn its first and second issues, Triton argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment\nbecause it misinterpreted and misapplied the law applicable to StarTex's breach of contract claim\nand to Triton's defenses. In its third issue, Triton argues that StarTex's summary *56 judgment\nevidence did not establish that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n\n [6] [7] To prevail on a breach of contract claim, a plaintiff must prove: (1) the existence of a valid\ncontract; (2) the plaintiff's performance or tender of performance; (3) the defendant's breach of\ncontract; and (4) the plaintiff's damages as a result of the breach.

Evidence Establishing Elements of StarTex's Claim\nAttached to its summary judgment motion, StarTex included copies of the ESA and First and\nSecond Amendments. Neither party disputes that these documents constitute a valid contract\nbetween them.\n\nStarTex also provided summary judgment evidence, including multiple invoices and the affidavits\nof two corporate representatives, that it provided electricity to Triton. Triton does not dispute that\nStarTex provided it with electricity up until Triton terminated the ESA.\n\nStarTex provided invoices and affidavits demonstrating that Triton owed $105,034.18 under the\nunpaid invoices. The account summary on the final invoice showed that Triton owed $155,034.18\nas of November 15, 2008. Verhage's affidavit testimony provided that Triton subsequently made\n$50,000.00 in payments, leaving $105,034.18 due and owing.\n\n[8] We conclude that StarTex conclusively established its right to recover $105,034.18 from\nTriton for Triton's breach of contract by failing to pay the invoices. Thus, the burden shifted to\nTriton to respond to the motion for summary judgment and present evidence raising a fact issue\non at least one of the elements of StarTex's claim or to present a valid defense. See Willrich, 28\nS.W.3d at 23.\n\n\n2. Triton's Response\nIn its fourth issue, Triton argues that it presented summary judgment evidence controverting\nStarTex's evidence and raising genuine issues of material fact as to one or more elements of\nStarTex's breach of contract claim. Triton does not dispute that StarTex provided electricity to its\nbuildings throughout the term of the contract up until Triton terminated the agreement. Neither\ndoes Triton dispute that it did not pay amounts invoiced by StarTex for the electricity provided.\nHowever, Triton disputes (1) the terms of the contract as presented by StarTex, alleging that the\nparties orally modified their agreement; (2) StarTex's satisfactory performance under the contract\nand its own excuse from performance by StarTex's prior material breach; (3) the sufficiency of\nStarTex's evidence to support the amount of damages awarded by the trial court; and (4) the trial\ncourt's implicit determination that it was not entitled to any offsets or credits.\n\n\n\n                              (a) The alleged oral modification of the contract\n\nTriton argues that, according to Gary's affidavit testimony, the agreement between the parties was\norally modified by representations Bejger made prior to execution of the Second Amendment that\ninvoices based on estimated usage would no longer be used.

The materiality of a breach—the question of whether a party's breach of a contract will\nrender the contract unenforceable—generally presents a dispute for resolution by the trier of fact.\nId. Here, however, because we determine that StarTex's actions did not breach the contract as a\nmatter of law, we need not consider whether Triton raised a fact issue on materiality.\n\n [20] To raise a material fact issue on every element of its affirmative defense, Triton had to raise\na fact question on StarTex's prior breach of contract. Triton argues that StarTex's use of estimated\nbilling was not proper under the contract because StarTex did not establish that the conditions\nprecedent to using estimated billing had occurred because StarTex did not prove that CenterPoint\nwas unable to access Triton's meters.\n\nThe ESA provides:\n\n   Customer Acknowledgments.

This contract provision is consistent with the legislatively mandated\ndivision of business activities in the electric utility market. See TEX. UTIL.CODE ANN. §\n39.051(b) (providing that electricity utilities must separate their business activities into three units\n—power generation company, retail electric provider, and transmission and distribution utility);\nTex. Indus. Energy Consumers, 324 S.W.3d at 97–98 *59 (observing that transmission and\ndistribution service providers are responsible for providing metering services).\n\nStarTex provided the affidavit of Robert Verhage, who averred that, on several occasions, it had\nto rely on estimated usage because CenterPoint did not provide Triton's actual meter usage. The\nsummary judgment evidence also contained an e-mail from a CenterPoint representative stating\nthat Triton was to blame for CenterPoint's failure to obtain actual meter readings. This e-mail\nshows that CenterPoint acknowledged that it provided StarTex with estimated usage rather than\nactual readings on several occasions and that StarTex was not at fault for CenterPoint's inability\nto access and read the meters.\n\nThe ESA expressly permits invoicing based on estimated usage. Triton did not present any\nsummary judgment evidence that StarTex used estimates in its invoices on occasions when\nCenterPoint had provided actual meter readings. Thus, this argument is without merit.\n\n [21] Triton also argues that, even if StarTex was permitted to use estimates in invoicing Triton\nfor its electricity usage, StarTex was required to reconcile any charges based on estimated usage\non the next bill. However, the plain language of the contract provides that StarTex must reconcile\nthe estimated usage with the actual usage “[a]s soon as practical, and after receipt of Customer's\nEnergy Consumption and settlement charges from the TDSP.” Triton's argument that the actual\nusage was required to be reconciled on the next month's bill is not supported by the plain language\nof the contract.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that Triton has not raised a fact issue on any element of its claim that\nStarTex committed a prior material breach of the contract.\n\n\n\n                                (c) StarTex's alleged failure to prove damages\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Thus, Triton argues that StarTex failed to prove its damages as a matter of law.\n\nStarTex acknowledges that it used estimates in some of its bills, and we have already concluded\nthat it was permitted to do so by the plain language of the contract. Furthermore, StarTex presented\nthe actual invoices it sent Triton and Verhage's affidavit stating that the final invoice relied on in\ncalculating the amount due and owing “contained the final, outstanding balance that was reconciled\nto correct all estimated reads.”\n\nTriton presented Gary's affidavit testimony that he disputed several invoices and objected to\nnumerous charges. It also presented e-mail correspondence between Gary, Triton's property\nmanager, and StarTex, in which Gary made general objections to several invoices without\nproviding specific amounts or portions of the invoices that he believed were inaccurate. Triton also\npresented an expert affidavit pointing out general complaints about the invoices without specifying\nparticular amounts in controversy.\n\nTriton argues that StarTex was legally obligated to address Triton's objections to StarTex's billing\npractices before collecting on the unpaid invoices and that this evidence raises a fact question\nregarding the amount Triton owed to StarTex.\n\n [22] The contract provides a method for disputing charges on invoices. The ESA provides that the\n“Customer must provide to [StarTex] written notice setting forth in particular detail any disputed\n *60 amount, including the calculations with respect to any errors or inaccuracies claimed.” The\nrecord contains no evidence that Triton complied with this procedure. Neither Gary's and Phillips'\naffidavit testimony nor the e-mails sent to StarTex contain specific amounts or calculations. Triton\ndid not produce any evidence that it provided StarTex with written notice articulating the particular\ndisputed amount or calculations regarding claimed inaccuracies.\n\nThus, Triton failed to present evidence raising a fact issue on the accuracy of the invoices StarTex\nused to support its claim for the unpaid amounts for electricity usage.\n\n\n\n                                 (d) Triton's entitlement to offsets and credits\n\nTriton also argues that it was entitled to $97,000 in offsets and credits, based on Phillips' affidavit.\n\n [23] “The right of offset is an affirmative defense.” Brown v.

However,\nas we have already stated, Triton did not provide a proper challenge to any particular charge or\ninvoice. Phillip's conclusory statements in his affidavit, by themselves, do not support Triton's\nclaim for offsets and credits. See TEX.R. CIV.

The trial court did not err in\ndetermining that Triton was entitled to summary judgment on this issue as a matter of law.\n\n\nC. Summary Judgment on StarTex's Breach of Contract Claim for Triton's Early\nTermination of the Contract\nIn parts of its first through seventh issues, Triton also argues that the trial court erred in granting\nsummary judgment on StarTex's breach of contract claim for Triton's wrongful early termination\nof the agreement.\n\n\n1. Evidence Establishing Elements of StarTex's Claim\nAs we have discussed, StarTex established the existence of a valid contract between itself and\nTriton, and it established that it performed under that contract. StarTex provided a copy of the\nSecond Amendment, which provided that the parties agreed to extend the ESA through May 2011.\n\nThe ESA contained the following early termination provision:\n\n   Early Termination Fee. In the event that Customer terminates this agreement *61 or Customer\n   defaults as described [in the ESA], then an Early Termination Fee will be assessed. The Early\n   Termination Fee shall be equal to the greater of a) the three months highest bills for Customer\n   or b) any mark to market costs.\n\nStarTex presented Verhage's affidavit testimony that Triton terminated the agreement on October\n10, 2008, approximately thirty-one months earlier than the Second Amendment's contractual\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Madden averred that when StarTex entered into the Second Amendment extending\nthe terms of the ESA through May 2011, it contracted with its electricity producer “to purchase\nenough power to service the entire thirty-six (36) month term of the Second Amendment and the\npurchases were tailored to fit Triton's particular ‘shape’.” After Triton unilaterally terminated the\ncontract on October 10, 2008, StarTex was still obligated to continue to purchase power from its\nsupplier through May 2011 “in Triton's particular ‘shape,’ ” even though StarTex no longer had a\ncustomer to whom to sell it. Madden testified that it was almost impossible to sell that electricity\nto another customer because StarTex “would have to find a new customer who not only wants\nan MCPE contract, but has the exact same term and volume requirements and ‘shape’ as Triton.”\nAccording to Madden, these particular characteristics of a MCPE payment arrangement made it\nvery difficult to calculate the mark-to-market losses because StarTex had no way of knowing what\nthe exact cost of the future electricity would be. StarTex thus calculated its liquidated damages as\n$197,323.25 based on the sum of Triton's three highest monthly bills.\n\n\n2. Triton's response\nTriton does not contest that it terminated the contract in October 2008, approximately thirty-one\nmonths before the termination date provided in the Second Amendment. Triton again argues that\nits early termination was excused by StarTex's prior breach by billing based on estimated usage.\nWe have already concluded that StarTex did not breach the ESA when it invoiced Triton based\non its estimated usage.\n\nTriton also raises several issues specific to the early termination clause and the trial court's award\nof liquidated damages. In its ninth issue, Triton argues that the early termination fee clause is\nunenforceable as an impermissible penalty. Triton argues in its tenth and eleventh issues that\neven if the early termination fee clause is enforceable as a matter of law, StarTex did not present\nsummary judgment evidence establishing the amount of the early termination fee in compliance\nwith the contract's terms.\n\n\n\n                                (a) Enforceability of early termination clause\n\nTriton argues that the early termination fee clause constitutes an impermissible penalty. Triton\nargues that it is impermissible both under the common law standard set out in Phillips v.

The party asserting that the provision is unenforceable bears\nthe burden of proof. GPA Holding, 344 S.W.3d at 475.\n\n [29] Triton argues that the harm caused by its breach is not incapable or difficult of estimation.\nTriton argues that StarTex “could determine the amount of electricity that would have been\npurchased by Triton but for the purported breach ... and determine what the electricity was sold for\nto an alternate customer versus what it would have been sold for to Triton.” However, StarTex's\nSenior Vice–President of Supply, Stephen Madden, provided affidavit testimony that it is almost\nimpossible to know what the cost of Triton's future energy use would have been because of the\nconstantly fluctuating prices involved in the MCPE pricing structure. He averred that the price\nof electricity changes as often as every fifteen minutes, that StarTex committed to buy electricity\nin fifteen minute increments to meet its obligation to provide electricity conforming to Triton's\nunique “shape” of energy consumption, and thus it would be very difficult to find another consumer\nto use that energy. Accordingly, it was not possible to determine, at the time of Triton's early\ntermination, the cost of the energy that would have been purchased by Triton but for the breach,\nand it was also very difficult for StarTex to predict whether it would find another consumer to\npurchase the electricity according to Triton's unique usage pattern, and if so, how much such a\nconsumer would pay.\n\nTriton did not present any evidence regarding the parties' ability to estimate actual damages when\nthe contract was formed, and it did not controvert Madden's description of the pricing model\napplicable to the ESA and Second Amendment. Thus, we conclude that it was impossible to\ndetermine the actual harm that would be caused by early termination. See Phillips, 820 S.W.2d\nat 788.\n\nTriton also appears to argue that the amount of the liquidated damages was not a reasonable\nforecast of StarTex's actual damages because it was unreasonably large. The ESA provided that\nthe early termination fee “shall be equal to the greater of a) the three months highest bills for\nCustomer or b) any mark to market costs.” In this instance, due to the length of the term remaining\non the terminated contract and the uncertainties of pricing, the “mark to market costs” could not\nbe calculated. Thus, Madden testified that StarTex calculated its damages based on Triton's three\nhighest monthly bills, which totaled $197,323.25.\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Thus, we conclude that, when viewed as of the time the contract was executed, the ESA's\nmethod for calculating the amount of liquidated damages provided a reasonable forecast of just\ncompensation. See id.\n\n [31] This same reasoning also demonstrates that Triton failed to show that the early termination\nfee violated Business and Commerce Code section 2.718. Section 2.718 provides that a liquidated\ndamages clause is unenforceable if (1) the *63 agreed amount is unreasonable in light of the\nanticipated or actual harm caused by breach, (2) the proof of actual harm is not difficult, (3)\nobtaining an adequate remedy for breach is not inconvenient or not feasible, or (4) the agreed\namount is unreasonably large. See TEX. BUS. & COM.CODE ANN. § 2.718 (Vernon 2009).\nAs we have already discussed, the proof of actual harm is difficult, and obtaining an adequate\nremedy for breach is not feasible because StarTex could not have calculated the future cost of\nthe electricity, nor could it predict the extent to which it could mitigate its damages. And, the\nagreed amount was not unreasonably large or unreasonable in light of the anticipated or actual\nharm. StarTex was obligated to buy thirty-one months' worth of electricity that it had no ability\nto resell. In that light, liquidated damages calculated from Triton's three highest monthly invoices\nare not unreasonable.\n\nTriton failed to raise a fact question on its claim that the early termination fee clause constituted\nan impermissible penalty.\n\n\n\n                                   (b) StarTex's proof of liquidated damages\n\nTriton also argues that StarTex failed to prove the amount of liquidated damages permitted under\nthe ESA. Several of Triton's arguments on this issue again challenge the accuracy of StarTex's\nbilling and StarTex's use of estimates in its invoices. However, we have already determined that\nTriton has failed to raise a fact question regarding the accuracy or propriety of StarTex's invoices.\nThus, we do not address those arguments again.\n\nTriton argues that StarTex failed to identify which three invoices it relied on in calculating the\nliquidated damages. It also argues that no three invoices from the term of the Second Amendment\nadd up to $197,323.95, and, thus, StarTex improperly used invoices dated prior to the execution\nof the Second Amendment to calculate the early termination fee. However, the early termination\nfee provision did not limit the time period from which the three highest bills could be taken, and\nTriton failed to present these arguments to the trial court.

Haden, 332 S.W.3d\nat 513.\n\n\nB. Analysis\n [37] In its motion for summary judgment, StarTex sought $75,589.36 in attorney's fees, and\nits attorney, Rodney Drinnon, submitted an affidavit in support of an award for attorney's fees.\nDrinnon averred that the contingency fee agreement awarding twenty-five percent of damages\nrecovered from any successful trial award constituted usual and customary attorney's fees; he\nprovided a list of specific tasks he and his law practice undertook during the course of representing\nStarTex; and he stated that his fee was supported by several, listed Arthur Andersen factors.\nDrinnon's description was “ ‘clear, positive, and direct, otherwise credible’ and [was] neither\ninternally inconsistent nor [contradictory]” and could have been readily controverted by Triton.\nSee id. at 514. Based on Drinnon's affidavit, submitted as evidence in support of the request for\nattorney's fees, StarTex was entitled to the statutory presumption that its attorney's usual and\ncustomary fees were reasonable. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 38.003; see also\nHaden, 332 S.W.3d at 514 (holding attorney's affidavit sufficient to warrant summary judgment\nwhen it (1) contained recitals establishing attorney's competency to swear to facts stated and\nother requirements of Rule of Civil Procedure 166a(f), (2) described work encompassed by the\nfees sought, and (3) specified factors that formed basis of his statement that amount claimed was\nreasonable and necessary, tracking seven of eight Arthur Andersen factors).\n\nTriton filed a written objection to Drinnon's affidavit, arguing that it failed to describe the time\nrequired to prosecute StarTex's claim, to provide counsel's hourly rate, and to discuss two of the\nArthur Andersen factors. We have already concluded that Drinnon's affidavit was sufficient *65\nto support StarTex's claim for attorney's fees. See Haden, 332 S.W.3d at 514. Triton did not file a\ncontroverting affidavit or any other evidence disputing Drinnon's evidence. Because Triton did not\npresent any controverting evidence, Triton cannot overcome the presumption of reasonableness\naccorded to Drinnon's affidavit in support of an award of attorney's fees. See id. at 514–16 (holding\nthat because nonmovant “did not controvert [attorney's] affidavit or otherwise dispute the law\nfirm's evidence, the law firm was ... entitled to the statutory presumption that the requested amount\nwas both reasonable and necessary”).\n\n [38] [39] Triton also argues that StarTex is not entitled to attorney's fees on the basis of its\naffirmative defense that StarTex made an excessive demand on Triton prior to filing suit. See Kurtz\nv. Kurtz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1355142\"><a href=\"/opinion/1355142/kurtz-v-kurtz/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 21 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2004, pet. denied). When a claimant\nmakes an “excessive” demand and will not accept a lesser amount, the claimant is not entitled\nto attorney's fees expended in litigation thereafter, even if it prevails on its breach of contract\nclaim.

It stated that Triton should pay the listed amounts within thirty days or make arrangements\nto satisfy the debt. Thus, the amounts demanded by StarTex prior to filing suit were not so much\ngreater than the amount it was eventually awarded as to be “excessive” or to indicate that the\ndemand was made in bad faith. Triton presented no evidence that StarTex would have refused\ntender of the $314,358.13 awarded by the trial court. Triton has failed to establish that this\nexception to StarTex's statutory right to attorney's fees is met.

Furthermore, the only indication\nbefore this Court that Triton actually filed a complaint with the PUC is Triton's statement in its\nappellate brief.

Liquidated damages or penalty. The parties to a contract may effectively provide in advance the\ndamages that are to be payable in the event of breach as long as the provision does not disregard\nthe principle of compensation. The enforcement of such provisions for liquidated damages saves\nthe time of courts, juries, parties and witnesses and reduces the expense of litigation. This is\nespecially important if the amount in controversy is small. However, the parties to a contract are\nnot free to provide a penalty for its breach. The central objective behind the system of contract\nremedies is compensatory, not punitive. Punishment of a promisor for having broken his promise\nhas no justification on either economic or other grounds and a term providing such a penalty is\nunenforceable on grounds of public policy. See Chapter 8. The rest of the agreement remains\nenforceable, however, under the rule stated in § 184(1), and the remedies for breach are determined\nby the rules stated in this Chapter. See Illustration 1. A term that fixes an unreasonably small\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                 1\n\f§ 356Liquidated Damages and Penalties, Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 356 (1981)\n\n\n\namount as damages may be unenforceable as unconscionable. See § 208. As to the liquidation of\ndamages and modification or limitation of remedies in contracts of sale, see Uniform Commercial\nCode §§ 2-718, 2-719.\n\nb. Test of penalty. Under the test stated in Subsection (1), two factors combine in determining\nwhether an amount of money fixed as damages is so unreasonably large as to be a penalty. The first\nfactor is the anticipated or actual loss caused by the breach. The amount fixed is reasonable to the\nextent that it approximates the actual loss that has resulted from the particular breach, even though\nit may not approximate the loss that might have been anticipated under other possible breaches.\nSee Illustration 2. Furthermore, the amount fixed is reasonable to the extent that it approximates\nthe loss anticipated at the time of the making of the contract, even though it may not approximate\nthe actual loss. See Illustration 3. The second factor is the difficulty of proof of loss. The greater the\ndifficulty either of proving that loss has occurred or of establishing its amount with the requisite\ncertainty (see § 351), the easier it is to show that the amount fixed is reasonable. To the extent\nthat there is uncertainty as to the harm, the estimate of the court or jury may not accord with the\nprinciple of compensation any more than does the advance estimate of the parties. A determination\nwhether the amount fixed is a penalty turns on a combination of these two factors. If the difficulty\nof proof of loss is great, considerable latitude is allowed in the approximation of anticipated or\nactual harm. If, on the other hand, the difficulty of proof of loss is slight, less latitude is allowed\nin that approximation. If, to take an extreme case, it is clear that no loss at all has occurred, a\nprovision fixing a substantial sum as damages is unenforceable. See Illustration 4.\n\n\n     Illustrations:\n     Illustrations:\n\n           1. A and B sign a written contract under which A is to act in a play produced by B for a\n           ten week season for $4,000. A term provides that “if either party shall fail to perform as\n           agreed in any respect he will pay $10,000 as liquidated damages and not as a penalty.”\n           A leaves the play before the last week to take another job. The play is sold out for that\n           week and A is replaced by a suitable understudy. The amount fixed is unreasonable in\n           the light of both the anticipated and the actual loss and, in spite of the use of the words\n           “liquidated damages,” the term provides for a penalty and is unenforceable on grounds\n           of public policy. The rest of the agreement is enforceable (§ 184(1)), and B's remedies\n           for A's breach are governed by the rules stated in this Chapter.\n\n           2. A, B and C form a partnership to practice veterinary medicine in a town for ten years.\n           In the partnership agreement, each promises that if, on the termination of the partnership,\n           the practice is continued by the other two members, he will not practice veterinary\n           medicine in the same town during its continuance up to a maximum of three years. A\n           term provides that for breach of this duty “he shall forfeit $50,000 to be collected by the\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                       2\n\f§ 356Liquidated Damages and Penalties, Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 356 (1981)\n\n\n\n           others as damages.” A leaves the partnership, and the practice is continued by B and C. A\n           immediately begins to practice veterinary medicine in the same town. The loss actually\n           caused to B and C is difficult of proof and $50,000 is not an unreasonable estimate of it.\n           Even though $50,000 may be unreasonable in relation to the loss that might have resulted\n           in other circumstances, it is not unreasonable in relation to the actual loss. Therefore,\n           the term does not provide for a penalty and its enforcement is not precluded on grounds\n           of public policy. See Illustration 14 to § 188.\n\n           3. A contracts to build a grandstand for B's race track for $1,000,000 by a specified date\n           and to pay $1,000 a day for every day's delay in completing it. A delays completion for\n           ten days. If $1,000 is not unreasonable in the light of the anticipated loss and the actual\n           loss to B is difficult to prove, A's promise is not a term providing for a penalty and its\n           enforcement is not precluded on grounds of public policy.\n\n           4. The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 3, B is delayed for a month in\n           obtaining permission to operate his race track so that it is certain that A's delay of ten\n           days caused him no loss at all. Since the actual loss to B is not difficult to prove, A's\n           promise is a term providing for a penalty and is unenforceable on grounds of public\n           policy.\n\nc. Disguised penalties. Under the rule stated in this Section, the validity of a term providing for\ndamages depends on the effect of that term as interpreted according to the rules stated in Chapter\n9. Neither the parties' actual intention as to its validity nor their characterization of the term as\none for liquidated damages or a penalty is significant in determining whether the term is valid.\nSometimes parties attempt to disguise a provision for a penalty by using language that purports to\nmake payment of the amount an alternative performance under the contract, that purports to offer a\ndiscount for prompt performance, or that purports to place a valuation on property to be delivered.\nAlthough the parties may in good faith contract for alternative performances and fix discounts or\nvaluations, a court will look to the substance of the agreement to determine whether this is the case\nor whether the parties have attempted to disguise a provision for a penalty that is unenforceable\nunder this Section. In determining whether a contract is one for alternative performances, the\nrelative value of the alternatives may be decisive.\n\n\n     Illustration:\n     Illustration:\n\n           5. A contracts to build a house for B for $50,000 by a specified date or in the alternative\n           to pay B $1,000 a week during any period of delay. A delays completion for ten days.\n           If $1,000 a week is unreasonable in the light of both the anticipated and actual loss, A's\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Related types of provisions. This Section does not purport to cover the wide variety of provisions\nused by parties to control the remedies available to them for breach of contract. A term that fixes as\ndamages an amount that is unreasonably small does not come within the rule stated in this Section,\nbut a court may refuse to enforce it as unconscionable under the rule stated in § 208. A mere\nrecital of the harm that may occur as a result of a breach of contract does not come within the rule\nstated in this Section, but may increase damages by making that harm foreseeable under the rule\nstated § 351. As to the effect of a contract provision on the right to equitable relief, see Comment\na to § 359. As to the effect of a term requiring the occurrence of a condition where forfeiture\nwould result, see § 229. Although attorneys' fees are not generally awarded to the winning party,\nif the parties provide for the award of such fees the court will award a sum that it considers to\nbe reasonable. If, however, the parties specify the amount of such fees, the provision is subject\nto the test stated in this Section.\n\ne. Penalties in bonds. Bonds often fix a flat sum as a penalty for non-occurrence of the condition of\nthe bond. A term providing for a penalty is not unenforceable in its entirety but only to the extent\nthat it exceeds the loss caused by the non-occurrence of the condition.\n\n\n     Illustration:\n     Illustration:\n\n           6. A executes a bond obligating himself to pay B $10,000, on condition that the bond\n           shall be void, however, if C, who is B's cashier, shall properly account for all money\n           entrusted to him. C defaults to the extent of $500. A's promise is unenforceable on\n           grounds of public policy to the extent that it exceeds the actual loss, $500.\n\n\n\n                                              Reporter's Note\n\nThis Section is based on former §§ 339 and 579, but Subsection (1) has been redrafted to harmonize\nwith Uniform Commercial Code § 2-718(1).
