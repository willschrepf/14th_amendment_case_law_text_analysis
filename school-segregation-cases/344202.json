GARZA, Circuit Judges.\n\n     REAVLEY, Circuit Judge:\n\n     In this prisoner class action suit, the district court found\n\nunconstitutional       conditions   at       the   Angelina    County   jail,     and\n\ngranted injunctive relief in the form of a population cap on the\n\nnumber of inmates.         We find no error in the district court's\n\nfindings   of   fact    and   conclusions          of   law   in   support   of   the\n\ninjunctive relief granted.          We also conclude that the district\n\ncourt did not err in dismissing a third-party claim against state\n\nprison officials.\n\n                                 BACKGROUND\n\n     Plaintiffs Bobby Harris and Terry Weekly, former prisoners at\n\nthe Angelina County Jail, brought this 42 U.S.C. § 1983 suit\n\nseeking relief from allegedly unconstitutional conditions at the\n\njail.   The suit was brought against Angelina County and the county\n\nsheriff in his official capacity.             These defendants (collectively\n\n                                         1\n\fthe   County)      brought    a    third-party     action    against    the    Texas\n\nDepartment of Criminal Justice (TDCJ), individual members of the\n\nDepartment, and individual members of the Board overseeing the\n\nDepartment     (collectively        the    State   defendants).        All    of   the\n\nindividual third-party defendants were sued in their official\n\ncapacities.        After a bench trial the district court dismissed the\n\nState     defendants    and       issued   an   injunction    capping    the       jail\n\npopulation at 111.\n\n                                     DISCUSSION\n\nA. The Injunction\n\n          We review the district court's findings of fact for clear\n\nerror and its legal conclusions de novo.1                Fiberlok, Inc. v. LMS\n\nEnterprises, Inc., 976 F.2d 958, 962 (5th Cir.1992).                         Deciding\n\nwhether     jail     conditions      are   unconstitutional       involves     mixed\n\nquestions of law and fact.            The district court employed a correct\n\nlegal analysis of the issues before it.\n\n          The jail houses pretrial detainees and convicted felons.\n\nPretrial detainees are protected by the due process clause of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment. See Valencia v. Wiggins, 981 F.2d 1440, 1445\n\n(5th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2998, 125\n\nL.Ed.2d      691    (1993).         Conditions      of   detention      constitute\n\n      1\n      The injunction was interlocutory in the sense that it was\nentered not as part of a final judgment and \"pending further\norder of the Court.\" However, it represented the court's final\ndisposition of the claims concerning jail conditions as they\nexisted up to the time of trial, and was not a preliminary\ninjunction under FED.R.CIV.P. 65(a) contemplating a later\ndisposition after trial. Accordingly, the district court and\nappellate standards appropriate to the granting or denying of a\npreliminary injunction are inapplicable here.\n\n                                           2\n\fdeprivations of liberty without due process if they amount to\n\npunishment of the detainee.            Id.   Of course, confinement of a\n\npretrial    detainee   necessarily      involves   some   loss    of   liberty.\n\nDeciding whether a condition of confinement amounts to \"punishment\"\n\nunder a due process analysis turns on whether \"the disability is\n\nimposed for the purpose of punishment or whether it is but an\n\nincident of some other legitimate governmental purpose.\"                 Bell v.\n\nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 538, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1873, 60 L.Ed.2d 447\n\n(1979).     Without delving further into the subtleties of this\n\ndoctrine, we think it sufficient to note that jail conditions which\n\namount to \"cruel and unusual punishment\" under the Eighth Amendment\n\nsurely amount to \"punishment\" under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nEvidence presented to the district court indicated that pretrial\n\ndetainees were treated the same as convicted felons.              For example,\n\nall inmates are segregated on the basis of prior criminal history;\n\npretrial detainees with criminal records are placed in the general\n\npopulation with other previously convicted felons.\n\n        As to convicted felons, a violation of the Eighth Amendment's\n\nprohibition against cruel and unusual punishment occurs if two\n\nrequirements—one objective and one subjective—are met.                 Farmer v.\n\nBrennan, --- U.S. ----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 1977, 128 L.Ed.2d 811\n\n(1994).    Under the objective requirement, the deprivation must be\n\nso serious as to \"deprive prisoners of the minimal civilized\n\nmeasure of life's necessities,\" as when it denies the prisoner some\n\nbasic human need.      Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 304, 111 S.Ct.\n\n2321,    2327,   115   L.Ed.2d   271    (1991).     Under   the    subjective\n\n\n                                        3\n\frequirement, the court looks to the state of mind of the defendant;\n\ndeliberate indifference on the part of prison officials will\n\nsuffice to meet this requirement.            Id.\n\n       The district court found that constitutional violations had\n\noccurred due to overcrowding, and that housing more that 111\n\ninmates in the current facility violates the Eighth Amendment\n\nrights of the convicted inmates and the Fourteenth Amendment rights\n\nof    the   pretrial    detainees.     It    considered    the   objective     and\n\nsubjective elements of Eighth Amendment analysis.                The County and\n\nthe    State   defendants    argue    that   the   court    erred     in   finding\n\nunconstitutional conditions.           We cannot say that the district\n\ncourt, having employed the correct rules of law to this case,\n\nclearly erred in finding unconstitutional conditions as a result of\n\novercrowding.     Viewing the record as a whole, we are not \"left with\n\na definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\"\n\nGraham v. Milky Way Barge, Inc., 824 F.2d 376, 388 (5th Cir.1987).\n\n         As to the objective element of Eighth Amendment analysis,\n\nevidence supports the district court's conclusion that, given the\n\njail's      current    management,   staffing,     and     physical    plant,    a\n\npopulation exceeding 111 leads to a denial of the inmates' basic\n\nhuman needs.          The design capacity of the current jail is 111,\n\nmeaning that the current facility has 111 bunks.                    The district\n\ncourt correctly noted that design capacity is not always equivalent\n\nto constitutional capacity, but that design capacity is relevant to\n\nthe constitutional inquiry.          Compare Alberti v. Sheriff of Harris\n\nCounty, 937 F.2d 984, 1000-01 (5th Cir.1991) (holding district\n\n\n                                       4\n\fcourt's finding of unconstitutional jail overcrowding not clearly\n\nerroneous, where district court considered design capacity in\n\nconjunction with the \"totality of the conditions.\"), cert. denied,\n\n--- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 1994, 118 L.Ed.2d 590 (1992).                  Prior to\n\nthe   district   court's    ruling,       The    Texas     Commission    on   Jail\n\nStandards, which periodically reviews conditions at the jails\n\naround the     state,   issued   a   remedial      order    limiting    the   jail\n\npopulation to 111.      Again, we agree with the district court that\n\nthis order, while not dispositive, is instructive.\n\n      Additional evidence supports the district court's finding that\n\novercrowding had resulted in a denial of basic human needs of the\n\njail population.    The court noted that in the recent months prior\n\nto its ruling the jail had an average daily count of 135 inmates.\n\nThe population has gone as high at 159 inmates.                     Plaintiffs'\n\nexpert, who was well qualified, testified that with proper staffing\n\nthe facility could properly accommodate 111 inmates, and that to\n\nensure proper classification, the population should probably not\n\nexceed   105   inmates.     Evidence       was    presented     that    staffing,\n\nsupervision, management and classification of prisoners are all\n\nimportant to maintaining basic human needs in the jail, and that\n\nall are affected adversely by overcrowding.                  The design of the\n\nfacility is such that when the jail population exceeds 111 some\n\nprisoners must sleep on the floors in \"day rooms\" which are not\n\ndesigned as sleeping quarters.        Compare Alberti, 937 F.2d at 1000-\n\n01 (concluding that district court did not clearly err in finding\n\nunconstitutional jail conditions where court considered, inter\n\n\n                                      5\n\falia, design capacity, the physical design of the cellblocks, and\n\n\"the fact that thousands of inmates were sleeping on the floors\").\n\nEven       the   State   defendants'     expert        conceded:       \"[I]f    you   go\n\nsignificantly above that [111] number without any improvement in\n\nthe operation of the jail, you are going to hit that constitutional\n\nwall fairly quickly, in my opinion.\"2\n\n       Jail officials and former and present prisoners testified to\n\nnumerous specific incidents that the district court could have\n\nfound were the result of, or at least were exacerbated by, the\n\novercrowding at the jail.              These incidents included abuse and\n\nintimidation        by   stronger   or   more     hardened     inmates     of   weaker\n\ninmates, inadequate care for inmates with special needs, improper\n\nsexual relations between inmates or between inmates and guards, the\n\noperation of a homemade still, illegal drug use, and fighting among\n\ninmates.           Evidence     indicated       that     the   reported    incidents\n\nrepresented only the \"tip of the iceberg\" of the total incidents.\n\nThe    evidence       also    showed     that,     unlike      state    penitentiary\n\nfacilities, the jail houses a highly heterogenous mix of inmates:\n\nmen and women, inmates still under the influence of drugs or\n\n       2\n      The same expert earlier responded to an inquiry from the\ncourt as follows:\n\n            THE COURT: Let's assume that Angelina County is not\n       willing to add five security additional employees, intake\n       person, a classification person, doctor full or part-time or\n       contract or however, Angelina County is not willing to put\n       twelve new bunks in each dorm and double cell for the four\n       and the six, and is—prefers to leave staffing levels and the\n       facilities as they are. Now, assuming that is true, I\n       gather then you are hard-pressed to disagree with the 111?\n\n                 THE WITNESS:    You gather correctly.\n\n                                            6\n\falcohol after arrest, inmates with prior convictions for serious\n\nfelonies and those with no criminal records and under arrest for\n\nminor offenses, etc.    In such a jail the proper segregation and\n\nclassification of inmates is of paramount importance. Evidence was\n\npresented that the physical layout and size of the facility was\n\nsuch that overcrowding in excess of design capacity would adversely\n\naffect the   ability   of   jail   officials   to   safely   and   properly\n\nsegregate inmates.     Evidence that overcrowding had an impact on\n\nsecurity, recreation and the delivery of medical care was presented\n\nas well.\n\n      We also conclude that the district court did not clearly err\n\nin finding that the subjective element of Eighth Amendment analysis\n\nwas established   against    the   County.     Reports   from   the   Texas\n\nCommission on Jail Standards to the County, various incident\n\nreports, evidence brought to the attention of the County through\n\nthis ongoing litigation itself, and testimony from the County's\n\nsheriff and jail administrators all support the conclusion that the\n\nCounty was well aware of the overcrowding at the jail and the\n\nresulting conditions.       We also agree with the district court's\n\nanalysis of this issue.     It found that:\n\n     the County Defendants make deliberate decisions whether or not\n     to pick up prisoners, to release them or to detain them.\n     County Defendants also make decisions concerning staffing\n     levels, classification of inmates and configuration of the\n     facility. The exercise of this decision making authority,\n     which   has    resulted   in    inmates   being   housed    in\n     unconstitutionally overcrowded jail facilities, meets the\n     criteria of deliberate indifference required by the Eighth\n     Amendment.\n\n     The County argues that the subjective element was not met\n\n\n                                    7\n\fbecause, in response to the overcrowding, \"the county officials did\n\neverything in their power—from building a dormitory to transferring\n\ninmates to providing alternatives to incarceration—in order to\n\nrelieve overcrowding.\"      It argues that the overcrowding is beyond\n\nits control because the state has refused to take paper-ready\n\nfelons who belong in state prison facilities,3 and that the County\n\nhas \"continuously spent over budget for the expenses of the jail\n\nand anticipated going over budget in 1992, even with declining\n\nrevenue from sales taxes, fines and fees due to a slow economy.\"\n\nDespite this evidence, we cannot say that the district court\n\nclearly erred in finding that the subjective element was met.\n\nEvidence was presented that the County could, and in fact had,\n\nsimply   delayed   acting    on   arrest   warrants   in   response   to\n\novercrowding concerns, and had addressed overcrowding through other\n\nmeans as well, including the use of probation, other facilities and\n\nelectronic monitoring. While such approaches may not be ideal from\n\na public policy standpoint, they demonstrate that alternatives were\n\navailable to address the unconstitutional conditions at the jail.\n\n     As to a purported lack of funding, the Supreme Court has left\n\nopen the question of whether a cost defense is available under\n\nEighth Amendment analysis. Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 301-03,\n\n\n     3\n      \"Paper-ready\" or \"state-ready\" felons consist of convicted\nfelons sentenced to the state prison system and awaiting transfer\nfrom county facilities. Due to its own overcrowding problems,\nthe state has engaged in a policy of deliberately leaving\npaper-ready felons in county facilities, and accepting transfers\nof such felons from county jails under an allocation formula.\nSee TEX.GOV.CODE § 499.071 (West Supp.1994); Alberti, 937 F.2d at\n987-89.\n\n                                    8\n\f111 S.Ct. 2321, 2326, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991).               Prior to Seiter,\n\nthis court rejected the defense.          See Alberti, 937 F.2d at 999 and\n\ncases cited therein.      Even if a cost defense were recognized, we\n\nwould find    it    inapplicable   here,     since   the   evidence    did   not\n\nestablish    that    additional    funding    was    unavailable      from   the\n\ntaxpayers to address the overcrowding.               On the contrary, the\n\nsheriff testified:\n\n     The budget hasn't been a problem: I overspend my budget every\n     year, but the paper hasn't raised cane about it, the\n     Commissioners haven't raised cane about it, the citizens\n     haven't. They know the problem is something that we can't\n     handle as far as—or can't control as far as the amount of\n     people coming in. So.... they've always paid whatever we've\n     run over, and—and we've pretty well accepted that, that we\n     will.\n\n         While a population cap may be an appropriate remedy to\n\nrelieve overcrowding,4 the district court correctly recognized that\n\na constitutional review of jail conditions should not consider\n\ninmate population in a vacuum.            It stated in its order that it\n\n\"will entertain any motion by the County Defendants to raise the\n\npopulation cap upon notification that the County has made changes\n\nin the configuration of the physical plant, increased staffing and\n\nupgraded its classification system such that an inmate population\n\nin excess of 111 can be housed in the jail without violating the\n\nConstitutional rights of the Plaintiff Class.\"             We agree with this\n\napproach and urge the district court to freely and fully revisit\n\n     4\n      Alberti v. Sheriff of Harris County, 978 F.2d 893, 896 (5th\nCir.1992) (\"A numerical cap on the number of prisoners is not an\noverly intrusive remedy. It gives the county maximum flexibility\nin determining on its own how to meet the population goals.\"),\ncert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2996, 125 L.Ed.2d 690\n(1993).\n\n                                      9\n\fthe need for the injunction should the County bring any relevant\n\nchange in circumstances to its attention.5\n\nB. The Third-Party Claims Against the State Defendants\n\n     The    County      complains    that    the   district    court     erred    in\n\ndismissing its third-party action against the State defendants. In\n\nits third-party complaint the County sought monetary and injunctive\n\nrelief against the State defendants in the event the County was\n\nfound    liable    to     plaintiffs,       as   well   as    attorney's       fees.\n\nOvercrowding      at    the   jail   results     from   the   presence    of   both\n\ntraditional county inmates and paper-ready felons awaiting transfer\n\nto state facilities.\n\n     The district court dismissed the State defendants with the\n\nfollowing reasoning:\n\n     The County Defendants, as Third-Party Plaintiffs did not\n     establish that the State Defendants had a legal duty to pick\n     up paper-ready felons within a certain length of time.\n     Further, the State Defendants have reimbursed Angelina County\n     for the expenses of housing paper ready felons in accordance\n     with the statutory formula set out in [TEX.GOV'T CODE ANN. §§\n     499.123-499.124 (Vernon Supp.1994) ].\n\nWhile we cannot agree with this analysis, we nevertheless hold that\n\nthe State defendants were properly dismissed.\n\n         The County alleged in its third-party complaint that the\n\nstate's refusal to accept paper-ready felons was the cause of\n\nplaintiffs' damages, and sought to have the state enjoined to\n\ntimely accept those felons.          Whether the state is making payments\n\n     5\n      We note that there in no apparent procedural barrier to\nreopening the case, since so far as we can tell from the record,\nthe County is correct in contending that no final judgment has\nbeen entered in this case. Our appellate jurisdiction rests on\n28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1).\n\n                                        10\n\fto the County for housing state felons, under the state statutory\n\nscheme, cannot by itself resolve the question of the state's\n\nconstitutional obligations under the Eighth Amendment.         To hold\n\notherwise would mean that a state could abdicate its constitutional\n\nresponsibility to its own felons by paying a third party to house\n\nthem.\n\n     We addressed the issue of state liability for unconstitutional\n\nconditions at a county jail in Alberti.          We recognized that\n\nliability under § 1983 depends on which state actor is responsible\n\nfor the civil rights violation, and that this question \"turns\n\nexclusively on state law.\"    Alberti, 937 F.2d at 994 (emphasis in\n\noriginal).   We agreed with the district court that, under Texas\n\nlaw, both the state and county are responsible for the conditions\n\nat county jails, and both are therefore liable for constitutional\n\nviolations at such jails.    Id. at 996-97.   In particular, we noted\n\nthat by statute the state places primary responsibility for the\n\nconfinement of felons on a state agency, the TDCJ.       Id.    In our\n\ncase, the State defendants can point to no significant changes in\n\nstate law that would alter the careful analysis and conclusion of\n\nthe district court and this court in Alberti.6    The state's current\n\n     6\n      Under the current statutory scheme, the TDCJ remains the\nstate agency \"with primary responsibility for [ ] the\nconfinement, supervision, and rehabilitation of felons....\"\nTEX.GOV'T CODE § 493.001 (Vernon Supp.1994). The Board of the\nTDCJ is required to adopt and enforce an allocation formula for\naccepting inmates from county facilities. Id. § 499.071. The\ndirector of the TDCJ's institutional division must \"adopt rules\nto provide for the safe transfer of inmates from the counties in\nwhich inmates are sentenced to the institutional division.\" Id.\n§ 500.006(a). Further, a provision effective after the Alberti\ndecision now provides:\n\n                                 11\n\fstatutory       obligation   to   make        payments   to   counties   holding\n\npaper-ready felons does not divest the state of its constitutional\n\nresponsibility for assuring that state felons—felons convicted in\n\nstate courts of state crimes and sentenced to the state prison\n\nsystem—are not subjected to cruel and unusual punishment.\n\n           However, our case differs from Alberti, since the plaintiffs\n\nin that case brought direct claims against the state defendants to\n\navoid the very problem we face here.               Alberti, 937 F.2d at 988,\n\n990.       We note that if some of the claims the County asserted\n\nagainst the State defendants (including claims for contribution and\n\nother relief under state law) had been brought by a private\n\ncitizen, they would have been properly dismissed under the Eleventh\n\nAmendment.7       That Amendment however would not appear to bar all\n\n\n               If a state or federal court determines that conditions\n               in a county jail are unconstitutional, and if on or\n               after October 1, 1991, the percentage of inmates in the\n               jail awaiting transfer to the institutional division is\n               20 percent or more of the total number of inmates in\n               the jail, the commission shall transfer inmates from\n               the jail to an appropriate jail, detention center, work\n               camp, or correctional facility, but only to the extent\n               necessary to bring the county into compliance with\n               court orders or to reduce the percentage of inmates in\n               the jail awaiting transfer to the institutional\n               division to less that 20 percent of the total number of\n               inmates in the jail.\n\n       Id. § 499.125.\n       7\n      Decades of Supreme Court jurisprudence have defined the\ncontours of Eleventh Amendment immunity, and we do not attempt a\ncomprehensive analysis here. Under the current state of the law,\nthe TDCJ is deemed an instrumentality of the state operating as\nits alter ego in carrying out a public function of the state, and\nis immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment. Ruiz v.\nEstelle, 679 F.2d 1115, 1136-37 & n. 75 (5th Cir.1982)\n(dismissing claims against board of Texas Department of\nCorrections (TDC), predecessor of TDCJ, since board was \"merely\n\n                                         12\n\fsuch claims.     Under the authority of Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123,\n\n28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908) and later authority, a § 1983\n\naction seeking prospective injunctive relief based on federal\n\nconstitutional violations may be brought against state officials in\n\ntheir official capacities. Will v. Michigan Dep't of State Police,\n\n491 U.S. 58, 71 n. 10, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 2312 n. 10, 105 L.Ed.2d 45\n\n(1989);     Kentucky v.

The first is whether\n\ncontribution     is   generally   available   to   a   defendant    sued   for\n\nviolation of a plaintiff's civil rights under § 1983.

Texas Dep't of Corrections,\n878 F.2d 860, 861 (5th Cir.1989) (holding TDC immune from suit\nunder Eleventh Amendment). In contrast, counties generally are\nnot immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment. Mount Healthy\nCity Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 278-80, 97\nS.Ct. 568, 572, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977). State law claims against\nthe State defendants, such as the claim for contribution under\nstate law asserted in the third-party complaint, are also barred\nby the Eleventh Amendment. Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v.\nHalderman, 465 U.S. 89, 102-03, 124-26, 104 S.Ct. 900, 909, 921,\n79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984).\n     8\n      In appropriate circumstances, attorney's fees ancillary to\nthe award of prospective injunctive relief may also be awarded,\neven where the fees are ultimately to be paid from state coffers.\nHutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 687-98, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 2572-78, 57\nL.Ed.2d 522 (1978); Maher v. Gagne, 448 U.S. 122, 129-34, 100\nS.Ct. 2570, 2575-77, 65 L.Ed.2d 653 (1980); Wyatt v. Cole, 928\nF.2d 718, 722 (5th Cir.1991) (\"Congress intended to authorize\nawards of attorneys fees under § 1988 to prevailing parties in\nofficial-capacity actions even when the state is immune from\ndamages under § 1983.\"), rev'd on other grounds, --- U.S. ----,\n112 S.Ct. 1827, 118 L.Ed.2d 504 (1992).\n\n                                     13\n\fis whether, assuming there is such a general right to contribution,\n\na federal court has authority to grant relief in favor of a\n\npolitical subdivision of a state and against the state itself.   We\n\nneed not answer the first question here, although we note that\n\nother courts have struggled with it and have reached different\n\nconclusions.9\n\n     9\n      Miller v. Apartments and Homes of New Jersey, Inc., 646\nF.2d 101 (3d Cir.1981), addressed contribution under § 1982, and\nheld that damages recoverable by a plaintiff had to be reduced by\nthe amount of settlements received from other defendants. Id. at\n110. It states that there is \"a fair uniformity in favor of\nallowing contribution among the few courts which have considered\nthe general question of contribution under the civil rights\nacts.\" Id. at 106. Miller recognized that questions regarding\nthe effect of settlements and questions of contribution are\nclosely related. Id. at 105 n. 5 (\"However, the two problems\n[settlement and contribution] are so intertwined that they cannot\nsensibly be treated in isolation.\"). In Dobson v. Camden, 705\nF.2d 759 (5th Cir.1983), on rehearing en banc, 725 F.2d 1003 (5th\nCir.1984), this court addressed what effect to give a settlement\nin a § 1983 action. We initially held that a nonsettling\ndefendant is entitled to a credit for a settlement by a joint\ntortfeasor in proportion to the amount of damages caused by the\njoint tortfeasor. 705 F.2d at 760. We treated the issue as a\ncontribution issue of sorts. Id. at 762 (\"It is impractical to\nconsider the effect of a settlement without also considering the\nproblem of contribution and, indeed, the very nature of joint\nliability.\"). However, when the case went en banc, we affirmed\nthe district court on grounds that injuries caused by the\nsettling defendant and the other defendants were separate, and\nthere could be no joint liability requiring application of a rule\nof contribution or credit. 725 F.2d at 1005-6. Our case is\nsomewhat different from Dobson and Miller, which addressed the\neffect of a settlement rather that a direct right of action by\none defendant against another tortfeasor. These cases do\nsuggest, however, that there are at least some notions of\ncontribution applied to § 1983.\n\n          Miller is of questionable precedential value because in\n     1981 the Supreme Court decided two important contribution\n     cases. In Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Transport Workers\n     Union, 451 U.S. 77, 101 S.Ct. 1571, 67 L.Ed.2d 750 (1981),\n     the Court held that there was no right to contribution under\n     Title VII and the Equal Pay Act. In Texas Industries, Inc.\n     v. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630, 101 S.Ct. 2061,\n\n                                14\n\f     Assuming there is a right to contribution generally under §\n\n1983, no party argues that relief from unconstitutional jail\n\nconditions is impossible without enjoining the state. The district\n\ncourt    plainly   did   not    believe   so   either,   since   it    found\n\nunconstitutional conditions and entered an injunction to relieve\n\nthose conditions, but nevertheless dismissed the State defendants.\n\nThe issue therefore boils down to whether a federal district court\n\nin such circumstances, exercising its power to remedy civil rights\n\nviolations   under   a   federal     statute   passed    pursuant     to   the\n\nFourteenth Amendment, can grant a county contribution against its\n\nstate.\n\n     We have previously held that state subdivisions, such as\n\ncounties and municipalities, cannot assert constitutional claims in\n\nfederal court against their creator, the state itself, or other\n\nstate political subdivisions.       E.g. Town of Ball v. Rapides Parish\n\nPolice Jury, 746 F.2d 1049, 1051 n. 1 (5th Cir.1984);                 Appling\n\nCounty v. Municipal Elec. Authority of Georgia, 621 F.2d 1301,\n\n1307-08 (5th Cir.1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1015, 101 S.Ct. 574,\n\n66 L.Ed.2d 474 (1980);         City of Safety Harbor v. Birchfield, 529\n\n\n     68 L.Ed.2d 500 (1981), the Court held that there is no\n     contribution under the federal antitrust laws. Subsequent\n     district court cases have looked to these Supreme Court\n     cases in deciding whether there can be contribution under §\n     1983 or other civil rights statutes. Most find no right of\n     contribution. See, e.g., Gray v. City of Kansas City, 603\n     F.Supp. 872, 875 (D.Kan.1985); Wright v. Reynolds, 703\n     F.Supp. 583, 592 (N.D.Tex.1988); Banks v. City of\n     Emeryville, 109 F.R.D. 535, 539 (N.D.Cal.1985). But see\n     Hoffman v. McNamara, 688 F.Supp. 830, 834 (D.Conn.1988)\n     (allowing setoff for settlement in § 1983 action); Fishman\n     v. De Meo, 604 F.Supp. 873, 877 (E.D.Pa.1985) (holding that\n     contribution is available in § 1983 cases).\n\n                                     15\n\fF.2d 1251, 1253-56 (5th Cir.1976).        One rationale for these cases\n\nis that political subdivisions lack Fourteenth Amendment or other\n\nconstitutional rights against the creating state.10            These cases\n\narguably   are   distinguishable     because   here   the   County   is    not\n\nnecessarily claiming a constitutional right against the state;\n\ninstead,   it    is   seeking   contribution   from   the   state    for   the\n\nviolation of plaintiffs' constitutional rights.\n\n      Nevertheless, we conclude that the County should not be able\n\nto seek relief against the State defendants.          A fundamental limit\n\non federal jurisdiction is implicated here.            As a general rule\n\nstates cannot be made parties to a federal court suit.                \"[T]he\n\nprinciple of sovereign immunity is a constitutional limitation on\n\nthe federal judicial power established in Art. III:          \"That a State\n\nmay not be sued without its consent is a fundamental rule of\n\njurisprudence ... of which the [Eleventh] amendment is but an\n\nexemplification.' \" Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465\n\nU.S. 89, 98-99, 104 S.Ct. 900, 907, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984) (quoting\n\nEx Parte State of New York, 256 U.S. 490, 497, 41 S.Ct. 588, 589,\n\n     10\n      See City of Trenton v. New Jersey, 262 U.S. 182, 188, 43\nS.Ct. 534, 537, 67 L.Ed. 937 (1923) (\"In none of [our prior]\ncases was any power, right, or property of a city or other\npolitical subdivision held to be protected by the Contract Clause\nor the Fourteenth Amendment. This court has never held that\nthese subdivisions may invoke such restraints upon the power of\nthe state.\"); Birchfield, 529 F.2d at 1254 (\"Ever since the\nSupreme Court's landmark decision in Dartmouth College v.\nWoodward, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 518, 4 L.Ed. 629 (1819), it has been\napparent that public entities which are political subdivisions of\nstates do not possess constitutional rights ... in the same sense\nas private corporations or individuals. Such entities are\ncreatures of the state, and possess no rights, privileges or\nimmunities independent of those expressly conferred upon them by\nthe state.\") (citation omitted).\n\n                                     16\n\f65 L.Ed. 1057 (1921)).         Young represents a necessary exception to\n\nthis general       rule    which   \"has      not   been    provided   an   expansive\n\ninterpretation,\" id. 465 U.S. at 102, 104 S.Ct. at 909, and we are\n\nnot   inclined     to     extend   it   to     cover   the    County's     claim   for\n\ncontribution here.           The Supreme Court has concluded \"that in\n\nenacting     §     1983,     Congress        did    not     intend    to    override\n\nwell-established immunities or defenses under the common law.\"\n\nWill v. Michigan Dep't of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 67, 109 S.Ct.\n\n2304, 2310, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989).\n\n      In construing the Eleventh Amendment, the Court has recognized\n\nthat Congress has the power under the Fourteenth Amendment to\n\nabrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity for the states, but that\n\ncongressional intent to negate such immunity must be unequivocally\n\nexpressed.       Id. at 64-66, 109 S.Ct. at 2309;              Pennhurst, 465 U.S.\n\nat 98-100, 104 S.Ct. at 907.            We are unable to find an unequivocal\n\nexpression of congressional intent to subject states to claims for\n\ncontribution from their own political subdivisions.                   In Pennhurst,\n\nthe court recognized that in applying the Young doctrine, \"the need\n\nto promote the supremacy of federal law must be accommodated to the\n\nconstitutional immunity of the States.\"                   Id. 465 U.S. at 105, 104\n\nS.Ct. at 910.           In striking this balance, the Court found it\n\n\"difficult to think of a greater intrusion on state sovereignty\n\nthan when a federal court instructs state officials on how to\n\nconform their conduct to state law.\"               Id. at 106, 104 S.Ct. at 911.\n\nEmploying like reasoning, we can think of few greater intrusions on\n\nstate sovereignty than requiring a state to respond, in federal\n\n\n                                          17\n\fcourt, to a claim for contribution brought by one of its own\n\ncounties.

Prior to\n\nthe   district   court's    ruling,       The    Texas     Commission    on   Jail\n\nStandards, which periodically reviews conditions at the jails\n\naround the     state,   issued   a   remedial      order    limiting    the   jail\n\npopulation to 111.      Again, we agree with the district court that\n\nthis order, while not dispositive, is instructive.\n\n      Additional evidence supports the district court's finding that\n\novercrowding had resulted in a denial of basic human needs of the\n\njail population.    The court noted that in the recent months prior\n\nto its ruling the jail had an average daily count of 135 inmates.\n\nThe population has gone as high at 159 inmates.                     Plaintiffs'\n\nexpert, who was well qualified, testified that with proper staffing\n\nthe facility could properly accommodate 111 inmates, and that to\n\nensure proper classification, the population should probably not\n\nexceed   105   inmates.     Evidence       was    presented     that    staffing,\n\nsupervision, management and classification of prisoners are all\n\nimportant to maintaining basic human needs in the jail, and that\n\nall are affected adversely by overcrowding.                  The design of the\n\nfacility is such that when the jail population exceeds 111 some\n\nprisoners must sleep on the floors in \"day rooms\" which are not\n\ndesigned as sleeping quarters.        Compare Alberti, 937 F.2d at 1000-\n\n01 (concluding that district court did not clearly err in finding\n\nunconstitutional jail conditions where court considered, inter\n\n\n                                      5\n\falia, design capacity, the physical design of the cellblocks, and\n\n\"the fact that thousands of inmates were sleeping on the floors\").\n\nEven       the   State   defendants'     expert        conceded:       \"[I]f    you   go\n\nsignificantly above that [111] number without any improvement in\n\nthe operation of the jail, you are going to hit that constitutional\n\nwall fairly quickly, in my opinion.\"2\n\n       Jail officials and former and present prisoners testified to\n\nnumerous specific incidents that the district court could have\n\nfound were the result of, or at least were exacerbated by, the\n\novercrowding at the jail.              These incidents included abuse and\n\nintimidation        by   stronger   or   more     hardened     inmates     of   weaker\n\ninmates, inadequate care for inmates with special needs, improper\n\nsexual relations between inmates or between inmates and guards, the\n\noperation of a homemade still, illegal drug use, and fighting among\n\ninmates.           Evidence     indicated       that     the   reported    incidents\n\nrepresented only the \"tip of the iceberg\" of the total incidents.\n\nThe    evidence       also    showed     that,     unlike      state    penitentiary\n\nfacilities, the jail houses a highly heterogenous mix of inmates:\n\nmen and women, inmates still under the influence of drugs or\n\n       2\n      The same expert earlier responded to an inquiry from the\ncourt as follows:\n\n            THE COURT: Let's assume that Angelina County is not\n       willing to add five security additional employees, intake\n       person, a classification person, doctor full or part-time or\n       contract or however, Angelina County is not willing to put\n       twelve new bunks in each dorm and double cell for the four\n       and the six, and is—prefers to leave staffing levels and the\n       facilities as they are. Now, assuming that is true, I\n       gather then you are hard-pressed to disagree with the 111?\n\n                 THE WITNESS:    You gather correctly.\n\n                                            6\n\falcohol after arrest, inmates with prior convictions for serious\n\nfelonies and those with no criminal records and under arrest for\n\nminor offenses, etc.    In such a jail the proper segregation and\n\nclassification of inmates is of paramount importance. Evidence was\n\npresented that the physical layout and size of the facility was\n\nsuch that overcrowding in excess of design capacity would adversely\n\naffect the   ability   of   jail   officials   to   safely   and   properly\n\nsegregate inmates.     Evidence that overcrowding had an impact on\n\nsecurity, recreation and the delivery of medical care was presented\n\nas well.\n\n      We also conclude that the district court did not clearly err\n\nin finding that the subjective element of Eighth Amendment analysis\n\nwas established   against    the   County.     Reports   from   the   Texas\n\nCommission on Jail Standards to the County, various incident\n\nreports, evidence brought to the attention of the County through\n\nthis ongoing litigation itself, and testimony from the County's\n\nsheriff and jail administrators all support the conclusion that the\n\nCounty was well aware of the overcrowding at the jail and the\n\nresulting conditions.       We also agree with the district court's\n\nanalysis of this issue.     It found that:\n\n     the County Defendants make deliberate decisions whether or not\n     to pick up prisoners, to release them or to detain them.\n     County Defendants also make decisions concerning staffing\n     levels, classification of inmates and configuration of the\n     facility. The exercise of this decision making authority,\n     which   has    resulted   in    inmates   being   housed    in\n     unconstitutionally overcrowded jail facilities, meets the\n     criteria of deliberate indifference required by the Eighth\n     Amendment.\n\n     The County argues that the subjective element was not met\n\n\n                                    7\n\fbecause, in response to the overcrowding, \"the county officials did\n\neverything in their power—from building a dormitory to transferring\n\ninmates to providing alternatives to incarceration—in order to\n\nrelieve overcrowding.\"      It argues that the overcrowding is beyond\n\nits control because the state has refused to take paper-ready\n\nfelons who belong in state prison facilities,3 and that the County\n\nhas \"continuously spent over budget for the expenses of the jail\n\nand anticipated going over budget in 1992, even with declining\n\nrevenue from sales taxes, fines and fees due to a slow economy.\"\n\nDespite this evidence, we cannot say that the district court\n\nclearly erred in finding that the subjective element was met.\n\nEvidence was presented that the County could, and in fact had,\n\nsimply   delayed   acting    on   arrest   warrants   in   response   to\n\novercrowding concerns, and had addressed overcrowding through other\n\nmeans as well, including the use of probation, other facilities and\n\nelectronic monitoring. While such approaches may not be ideal from\n\na public policy standpoint, they demonstrate that alternatives were\n\navailable to address the unconstitutional conditions at the jail.\n\n     As to a purported lack of funding, the Supreme Court has left\n\nopen the question of whether a cost defense is available under\n\nEighth Amendment analysis.

The Third-Party Claims Against the State Defendants\n\n     The    County      complains    that    the   district    court     erred    in\n\ndismissing its third-party action against the State defendants. In\n\nits third-party complaint the County sought monetary and injunctive\n\nrelief against the State defendants in the event the County was\n\nfound    liable    to     plaintiffs,       as   well   as    attorney's       fees.\n\nOvercrowding      at    the   jail   results     from   the   presence    of   both\n\ntraditional county inmates and paper-ready felons awaiting transfer\n\nto state facilities.\n\n     The district court dismissed the State defendants with the\n\nfollowing reasoning:\n\n     The County Defendants, as Third-Party Plaintiffs did not\n     establish that the State Defendants had a legal duty to pick\n     up paper-ready felons within a certain length of time.\n     Further, the State Defendants have reimbursed Angelina County\n     for the expenses of housing paper ready felons in accordance\n     with the statutory formula set out in [TEX.GOV'T CODE ANN. §§\n     499.123-499.124 (Vernon Supp.1994) ].\n\nWhile we cannot agree with this analysis, we nevertheless hold that\n\nthe State defendants were properly dismissed.\n\n         The County alleged in its third-party complaint that the\n\nstate's refusal to accept paper-ready felons was the cause of\n\nplaintiffs' damages, and sought to have the state enjoined to\n\ntimely accept those felons.          Whether the state is making payments\n\n     5\n      We note that there in no apparent procedural barrier to\nreopening the case, since so far as we can tell from the record,\nthe County is correct in contending that no final judgment has\nbeen entered in this case. Our appellate jurisdiction rests on\n28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1).\n\n                                        10\n\fto the County for housing state felons, under the state statutory\n\nscheme, cannot by itself resolve the question of the state's\n\nconstitutional obligations under the Eighth Amendment.         To hold\n\notherwise would mean that a state could abdicate its constitutional\n\nresponsibility to its own felons by paying a third party to house\n\nthem.\n\n     We addressed the issue of state liability for unconstitutional\n\nconditions at a county jail in Alberti.          We recognized that\n\nliability under § 1983 depends on which state actor is responsible\n\nfor the civil rights violation, and that this question \"turns\n\nexclusively on state law.\"    Alberti, 937 F.2d at 994 (emphasis in\n\noriginal).   We agreed with the district court that, under Texas\n\nlaw, both the state and county are responsible for the conditions\n\nat county jails, and both are therefore liable for constitutional\n\nviolations at such jails.    Id. at 996-97.   In particular, we noted\n\nthat by statute the state places primary responsibility for the\n\nconfinement of felons on a state agency, the TDCJ.       Id.    In our\n\ncase, the State defendants can point to no significant changes in\n\nstate law that would alter the careful analysis and conclusion of\n\nthe district court and this court in Alberti.6    The state's current\n\n     6\n      Under the current statutory scheme, the TDCJ remains the\nstate agency \"with primary responsibility for [ ] the\nconfinement, supervision, and rehabilitation of felons....\"\nTEX.GOV'T CODE § 493.001 (Vernon Supp.1994). The Board of the\nTDCJ is required to adopt and enforce an allocation formula for\naccepting inmates from county facilities. Id. § 499.071. The\ndirector of the TDCJ's institutional division must \"adopt rules\nto provide for the safe transfer of inmates from the counties in\nwhich inmates are sentenced to the institutional division.\" Id.\n§ 500.006(a). Further, a provision effective after the Alberti\ndecision now provides:\n\n                                 11\n\fstatutory       obligation   to   make        payments   to   counties   holding\n\npaper-ready felons does not divest the state of its constitutional\n\nresponsibility for assuring that state felons—felons convicted in\n\nstate courts of state crimes and sentenced to the state prison\n\nsystem—are not subjected to cruel and unusual punishment.\n\n           However, our case differs from Alberti, since the plaintiffs\n\nin that case brought direct claims against the state defendants to\n\navoid the very problem we face here.               Alberti, 937 F.2d at 988,\n\n990.       We note that if some of the claims the County asserted\n\nagainst the State defendants (including claims for contribution and\n\nother relief under state law) had been brought by a private\n\ncitizen, they would have been properly dismissed under the Eleventh\n\nAmendment.7       That Amendment however would not appear to bar all\n\n\n               If a state or federal court determines that conditions\n               in a county jail are unconstitutional, and if on or\n               after October 1, 1991, the percentage of inmates in the\n               jail awaiting transfer to the institutional division is\n               20 percent or more of the total number of inmates in\n               the jail, the commission shall transfer inmates from\n               the jail to an appropriate jail, detention center, work\n               camp, or correctional facility, but only to the extent\n               necessary to bring the county into compliance with\n               court orders or to reduce the percentage of inmates in\n               the jail awaiting transfer to the institutional\n               division to less that 20 percent of the total number of\n               inmates in the jail.\n\n       Id. § 499.125.\n       7\n      Decades of Supreme Court jurisprudence have defined the\ncontours of Eleventh Amendment immunity, and we do not attempt a\ncomprehensive analysis here.

We treated the issue as a\ncontribution issue of sorts. Id. at 762 (\"It is impractical to\nconsider the effect of a settlement without also considering the\nproblem of contribution and, indeed, the very nature of joint\nliability.\").

Our case is\nsomewhat different from Dobson and Miller, which addressed the\neffect of a settlement rather that a direct right of action by\none defendant against another tortfeasor.

We are unable to find an unequivocal\n\nexpression of congressional intent to subject states to claims for\n\ncontribution from their own political subdivisions.                   In Pennhurst,\n\nthe court recognized that in applying the Young doctrine, \"the need\n\nto promote the supremacy of federal law must be accommodated to the\n\nconstitutional immunity of the States.\"                   Id. 465 U.S. at 105, 104\n\nS.Ct. at 910.
