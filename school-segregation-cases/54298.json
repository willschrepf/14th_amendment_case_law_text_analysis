FACTS AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p>A. Factual Background.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Endrin is a chlorinated hydrocarbon first introduced about 1950.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a> It has been used as a pesticide for several decades, and is currently used for pest control on crops including cotton and sugar cane.  At present, there is only one domestic manufacturer of endrin, Velsicol Chemical Corp.  (Velsicol), which produces three to six million pounds a year. 42 Fed.Reg. 2595, 2600 (1977).  Its endrin manufacturing plant is located at Memphis, Tennessee, and its discharges eventually reach the Mississippi River and are carried through the lower Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence concerning the dangers of endrin to public health and the environment has been produced over the years since endrin was first introduced.  In 1965, results from a study using rats suggested that it was carcinogenic.  See 41 Fed.Reg. 31316 (1976).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> EPA has found that endrin has caused fifty-two reported fish and wildlife kills, largely the result of leakage or runoff during agricultural use.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Id. at 31317.  However, a massive fish kill in the lower Mississippi in 1963 was traced to discharges from Velsicol's Memphis plant. 42 Fed.Reg. 2591.  Endrin is suspected in particular of threatening the brown pelican, an endangered species sensitive to endrin. 42 Fed.Reg. 2591; 41 Fed.Reg. 31317.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regulatory authorities have taken a number of steps to control endrin.  The Food and Drug Administration has established a ceiling on endrin levels in food. 42 Fed.Reg. 2591.  Velsicol discharged, on the average, approximately seven pounds of endrin per day in the mid-1960's, Joint Appendix (App.)  I 182, but, under public and governmental pressure, it has taken steps to reduce this discharge.  In June 1974, EPA issued Velsicol a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit allowing an average daily discharge of no more than one pound of endrin.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Velsicol failed to reduce its endrin discharge below an average of 2.5 pounds per day in 1975, App.  I 184, and it was found in violation of its permit and was subject to civil penalties.  United States v. Velsicol Chemical Corp., 9 ERC (BNA) 1723 (W.D.Tenn.1976).  Under the regulations now under review, Velsicol is required to limit its discharge to approximately .005 pounds of endrin per day. 42 Fed.Reg. 2594 &amp; n.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Toxaphene is also a chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticide.  It has been used for several decades, and is currently used for pest control on cotton and livestock.  In the recent past, toxaphene was produced by four manufacturers.  See 41 Fed.Reg. 23590 (1976).  Hercules, Inc.  (Hercules) contends that it is now the only manufacturer that discharges any toxaphene into waterways, and thus, the only manufacturer affected by these regulations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> In 1975, total domestic production of toxaphene was approximately one hundred million pounds.  App. I 205-11.  Hercules' toxaphene manufacturing plant is located at Brunswick, Georgia, and its discharge flows into the Brunswick Estuary, an arm of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence concerning the danger of toxaphene to public health and the environment, particularly to fish, has been produced in the years since the chemical was first introduced.  Application of toxaphene to agricultural land surrounding several bird refuges resulted in massive bird kills in 1960-62.  App. I 157.  Toxaphene was identified as a cause of fish kills because of the characteristic \"broken back\" syndrome it produces in fish.  In 1969, strobane, a pesticide closely related to toxaphene, was identified as a carcinogen in mice.  App. I 148.  Toxaphene has been frequently found in clarified and treated municipal drinking water.  App. I 152.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to 1970, Hercules' plant operated without a pollution treatment system; and, as Hercules concedes, its discharge \"had an adverse effect upon the ecology\" of local waters.  Brief for Petitioner Hercules at 4. Subsequently, Hercules received an NPDES permit from the State of Georgia limiting its allowable toxaphene discharge.  By 1975, Hercules reduced its average discharges of toxaphene to .27 pounds per day.  App. I 206.  Under the regulations now on review, Hercules is required to reduce its discharges to approximately .00375 pounds per day. 42 Fed.Reg. 2606 &amp; n.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>B. Proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The early attempts of EPA to limit discharges of toxic substances are described in the opinion of this court in EDF v. EPA (PCBs), 194 U.S.App.D.C. --- at --- - ---, 598 F.2d 62, at 68-70 (1978), decided today, and thus, there is no need to repeat that saga in detail.  Endrin and toxaphene were on EPA's July 1973 proposed list of toxic substances and its September 1973 final list. 38 Fed.Reg. 18044, 24342 (1973).  In December 1973, EPA proposed standards for endrin and toxaphene, 38 Fed.Reg. 35388 (1973); but after the 1974 hearings, EPA failed to issue final standards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the 1974 hearings, EPA subjected endrin and toxaphene to further investigation and analysis.  EPA conducted its own experiments concerning the effects of endrin and toxaphene on a variety of species at its National Environmental Research Laboratory in Gulf Breeze, Florida.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Based on these experiments and on other studies, the Chief of the Criterion Branch of EPA's Office of Water Planning and Standards, Dr. Leonard J. Guarraia, prepared Criteria Documents summarizing the available information on endrin and toxaphene.  On June 10, 1976, EPA proposed standards for endrin and toxaphene. 41 Fed.Reg. 23576 (1976).  The standards were of two kinds: Concentration limitations on the concentration of pollutant allowed in the discharges, and Mass limitations on the amount of pollutant allowed in the discharges.  For endrin, the proposed concentration limitation was 1.5 parts per billion, and the proposed mass limitation was 0.0003 kg/kkg (kilogram (kg.)/thousand (kilo) kilogram (kkg.)) of endrin produced. 41 Fed.Reg. 23595.  For toxaphene, the proposed concentration limitation was 1.5 parts per billion, and the proposed mass limitation was 0.00001 kg/kkg of toxaphene produced.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1976, EPA commenced an evidentiary hearing on the proposed endrin and toxaphene standards before an administrative law judge (ALJ), which was concluded on October 12 after sixteen days of testimony.  EPA presented the testimony of twelve witnesses.  Velsicol presented the testimony of four witnesses concerning endrin, and Hercules presented the testimony of six witnesses concerning toxaphene.  The Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) presented the testimony of one witness concerning the carcinogenic effects of endrin and toxaphene. 42 Fed.Reg. 2592, 2602.  Three other parties participated in the hearing and twelve persons filed written comments. At the close of the hearing the record was furnished to the EPA Administrator (Administrator) for his consideration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 3, 1977, the Administrator filed his final decision concerning endrin and toxaphene with the EPA hearing clerk,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> and on January 12, the decision was published. 42 Fed.Reg. 2588.  The final decision adopted the proposed concentration limitations for endrin and toxaphene, but adopted relaxed mass limitations of 0.0006 kg/kkg of endrin produced and 0.00003 kg/kkg of toxaphene produced.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the day the final standards were filed, the parties engaged in a customary \"race to the courthouse.\"  At 9:38 A.M., Hercules petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit for review of the toxaphene regulations.  However, the petition was premature as the standards were not filed until later in the day; Hercules filed a renewed petition for review two weeks later.  At 11:13 A.M., the moment EPA filed its standards, EDF petitioned this court for review of the standards for both endrin and toxaphene.  At 11:13 A.M., Velsicol also petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit for review of the endrin regulations.  Pursuant to motions by EPA, the Hercules and Velsicol petitions were transferred to this court.  Subsequently, EDF's petition for review was dismissed on voluntary motion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> This court denied joint motions by Hercules and Velsicol for retransfer of their petitions and for expedition of the appeals.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Compliance with the standards was required by January 12, 1978.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>II. APPLICABLE LAW.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">EPA adopted the regulations now under review pursuant to authority conferred by the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (1972 Act or the Act), 33 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1251-1376 (1976).  Almost one year after EPA published its final regulations, while this case awaited oral argument in this court, Congress amended the toxics provision of the 1972 Act in section 53 of the Clean Water Act of 1977 (1977 Amendments or the Amendments), 33 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1317 (1977).  Velsicol argues that the subsequent congressional action requires us to remand the toxic effluent standards for endrin for new proceedings under the 1977 Amendments.  We do not agree.  Courts apply the statutory law as it exists at the time of decision unless the intent of Congress is otherwise.  Bradley v. School Board, 416 U.S. 696, 715-16 &amp; n.21, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (1974).  We conclude that this is a case in which it was intended that the new legislation not affect regulations that were awaiting judicial review prior to enactment of the legislation.  Compare In re District of Columbia Workmen's Compensation Act, 180 U.S.App.D.C. 216, 219-222, 554 F.2d 1075, 1078-81, Cert. denied, 429 U.S. 820, 97 S.Ct. 67, 50 L.Ed.2d 81 (1976) With De Rodulfa v. United States, 149 U.S.App.D.C. 154, 161, 164-167, 461 F.2d 1240, 1247, 1250-53, Cert. denied, 409 U.S. 949, 93 S.Ct. 270, 34 L.Ed.2d 220 (1972).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress passed the 1972 Act in an effort to deal with the regulatory problems that had hindered efforts to control water pollution.  EPA v. State Water Resources Control Board, 426 U.S. 200, 202-03, 96 S.Ct. 2022, 48 L.Ed.2d 578 (1976).  The 1972 Act solved some regulatory problems, but not others.  By 1977, Congress concluded that the toxics provision of the 1972 Act, which provided for regulation based on health criteria, had been a failure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> As a reaction to inadequacy of the 1972 toxics provision, EPA commenced a new program to issue regulations under other provisions of the 1972 Act: it would regulate toxic discharges on an industry-by-industry basis and set standards based on the feasibility of control technology.  EPA would also continue to issue health-based standards.  EPA's new program was sanctioned by the judicial decree in NRDC v. Train, 8 ERC (BNA) 2120, 2122 (D.D.C.1976) (\"Flannery decree\"), Rev'd in part on other grounds sub nom.  NRDC v. Costle, 183 U.S.App.D.C. 11, 561 F.2d 904 (1977).  In the 1977 Amendments, Congress remodeled the toxics provision based on the judicial decree in NRDC v. Train.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In section 53(a) of the 1977 Amendments, 33 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1317(a)(2) (1977), Congress directed EPA to take into account, in issuing health-based regulations, \"the extent to which effective control is being or may be achieved under other regulatory authority,\" particularly EPA's authority to promulgate feasibility-based regulations.  See 33 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1311(b)(2)(C) (1977).  Velsicol contends that this provision shows that Congress intended EPA to withdraw the health-based toxics regulations promulgated under the 1972 Act, particularly the endrin regulations, and to regulate endrin discharges using feasibility-based criteria.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> EPA responds that the 1977 Amendments were intended to supplement its authority, and were not intended in any way to impede promulgation of health-based regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On a question of statutory interpretation such as this one, involving legislation enacted with EPA's advice and cooperation, EPA's view of the legislative intent concerning its ongoing efforts deserves some deference.  See E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Train, 430 U.S. 112, 134-35, 97 S.Ct. 965, 51 L.Ed.2d 204 (1977); Union Electric Co. v. EPA, 427 U.S. 246, 256, 96 S.Ct. 2518, 49 L.Ed.2d 474 (1976); Train v. NRDC, 421 U.S. 60, 75, 87, 95 S.Ct. 1470, 43 L.Ed.2d 731 (1975).  Congress knew that EPA's health-based regulations were in effect and were awaiting judicial review.  See 123 Cong.Rec. H12929 (daily ed. Dec. 15, 1977) (staff report).  Moreover, its attitude was not that EPA had done too much and should start all over, but rather that EPA had done too little. \"Frankly, (Section 307(a)) has failed. . . . (O)nly six toxic chemicals aldrin/dieldrin, endrin, DDT, toxaphene, benzidene and PCB's Have been regulated.  Six chemicals in 5 years.\"  Id. at H12927 (remarks of Rep.  Roberts) (emphasis added).  Congress's strong support for continuing health-based regulation is shown not only by its impatience with EPA's pace, but also by the great emphasis placed in the 1977 Amendments on making it Easier for EPA to promulgate health-based regulations as a supplement to feasibility-based regulation.  See 123 Cong.Rec. S19649 (daily ed. Dec. 15, 1977) (remarks of Sen.  Muskie) (\"these amendments reduce the evidentiary burden of establishing a toxic effluent standard\"); S.Rep.No.370, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 54 (1977); U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1977, p. 4378 (lifting of formal rulemaking requirement for health-based regulation).  The provision relied on by Velsicol merely directs EPA to \"take into account\" its \"other regulatory authority\"; it created no new threshold barrier in health-based regulation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> Senator Muskie stated that the test for regulating a pollutant under health-based criteria instead of feasibility-based criteria is simply whether \"there is sufficient information on toxicity to establish a separate nationwide effluent standard for that pollutant.\" 123 Cong.Rec. S19649 (daily ed. Dec. 15, 1977).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> EPA's lengthy and detailed final decision on endrin, 42 Fed.Reg. 2590-601, both demonstrates and supports its view that there is sufficient information on endrin to establish such a standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Velsicol emphasizes that Congress listed endrin among the sixty-five families of toxic substances in the 1977 Amendments.  It maintains this must have been intended to require EPA to reconstruct its regulations under the feasibility-based provisions of the 1977 Amendments.  However, the list of substances in the 1977 Amendments was modeled, in large measure, on the judicial decree in NRDC v. Train.  See note 14 Supra.  That decree expressly directed EPA to proceed with health-based regulation of endrin at the same time as it proceeded with feasibility-based regulation of other substances. 8 ERC (BNA) at 2128-29.  The 1977 Amendments required, \"at a minimum,\" section 307(a)(2), that EPA publish effluent limitations based upon best-available technology for all pollutants on the list; the list was in no way intended to preclude health-based standards if they were warranted. 123 Cong.Rec. S19663 (daily ed. Dec. 15, 1977) (remarks of Sen.  Randolph).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we conclude that the 1977 Amendments were intended to aid, not to impede, EPA's health-based regulation.  In accordance with EPA's view that this intent would be frustrated if the regulations were nullified, we conclude that the applicable law in this proceeding is the 1972 Act and that no remand is necessary.III. SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES CONCERNING TOXAPHENE.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>A. Claims of the Parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In setting discharge standards, EPA's approach was to follow a procedure consisting in essence of determining, in the laboratory, which aquatic organisms were most vulnerable to toxaphene, measuring how much toxaphene they could take, and then, using these data, calculating a maximum tolerable discharge figure.  Hercules challenges EPA's laboratory-based approach, as well as particular details of EPA's methodology.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">EPA's approach may be viewed as consisting of six steps.  In the first, EPA selected a half-dozen species of aquatic organisms for testing that were either important commercially in and of themselves (oysters), or important indirectly as food for other organisms (pinfish).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, EPA conducted \"bioassays\" in the laboratory.  In these bioassays, EPA exposed the organisms to toxaphene for ninety-six hours.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> EPA derived, from the bioassay results, the concentration of toxaphene that kills one-half of a group of aquatic organisms.  The short-term lethal dose for the tested organisms ranged from 16 parts per billion for oysters to 0.5 parts per billion for pinfish.  These figures reflect the vulnerability of fish and other aquatic life to toxaphene.  Third, EPA estimated from the short-term lethal dose the maximum tolerable long-term concentration of toxaphene for the tested species.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> Fourth, EPA used the long-term tolerable concentration level to set an \"ambient water criterion.\"  The ambient water criterion is intended to be the maximum concentration of the toxic substance allowed in the nation's waterways a concentration low enough that even the most vulnerable important life in the water will be safe.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fifth, EPA translated the ambient water criterion into the effluent discharge standard, the standard controlling how much toxaphene a plant may discharge legally.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a> Finally, EPA set a \"mass limitation\" to supplement the effluent discharge limit.  Whereas the effluent discharge limit is expressed in terms of a concentration of toxaphene, the mass limitation restates it in terms of the total amount of toxaphene produced.  Such a supplemental figure compels a plant to meet the effluent discharge limit by removing toxaphene from its effluent.  In the absence of such a mass limitation, a plant could meet the discharge limit simply by watering down its effluent until the effluent was diluted enough to meet the concentration limit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hercules' challenge to EPA's laboratory-based approach relies on alternative data using field studies.  Starting in 1970, Dr. Robert Reimold, a Georgia biologist, conducted a field study of aquatic life in Terry Creek, the arm of Brunswick Estuary into which Hercules' plant discharges effluent.  For six years, Dr. Reimold compared the variety of free-swimming species found in Terry Creek with the variety found in Duplin Estuary, a comparable nearby body of water not contaminated by toxaphene.  Dr. Reimold believed that toxaphene was not harming the free-swimming aquatic life present in Terry Creek.  The level of toxaphene in Terry Creek's waters was between 1 and 2 parts per billion, which is between 200 and 400 times EPA's \"ambient water criterion\" of .005 parts per billion.  Accordingly, Hercules asserts that aquatic life can survive higher levels of toxaphene than EPA allows, and thus, that EPA's regulations are overly strict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hercules combines this frontal assault with several attacks on the specifics of EPA's methodology.  It contends that EPA's use of the pinfish as a test species was misconceived, since the pinfish is not an important species in Brunswick Estuary.  It also argues that EPA's toxicity tests were conducted improperly, that the tests failed to support the standard with substantial evidence, and that EPA should not have adopted a mass limitation precluding dilution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">EPA replies that its six-step approach was proper, since the toxics provision requires \"categorical\" standards for toxic pollutants, rather than standards based on local species and local receiving waters.  EPA further responds that it was not required to give great weight to Hercules' evidence, and that its own tests furnished an adequate basis for regulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>B. Statutory Issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court has discussed the standards of section 307(a), 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1317(a) (1976), in EDF v. EPA (PCBs), 194 U.S.App.D.C. at --- - ---, 598 F.2d at 79-81.  As explained there, section 307(a)(2) of the 1972 Act lists six factors for EPA to \"take into account\" in proposing a toxic effluent standard: \"the toxicity of the pollutant, its persistence, degradability, the usual or potential presence of the affected organisms in any waters, the importance of the affected organisms and the nature and extent of the effect of the toxic pollutant on such organisms.\"  EPA is to set discharge standards that provide an \"ample margin of safety.\"  Section 307(a)(4).  Under the \"ample margin of safety\" directive, EPA's standards must protect against incompletely understood dangers to public health and the environment, in addition to well-known risks.  See EDF v. EPA (PCBs), 194 U.S.App.D.C. at --- - ---, 598 F.2d at 80-81.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hercules' challenge to the regulations concentrates on the last three factors in section 307(a): \"the usual or potential presence of the affected organisms in any waters, the importance of the affected organisms and the nature and extent of the effect of the toxic pollutant on such organisms.\"  Hercules argues that these factors preclude EPA from basing its calculations upon experiments performed on the pinfish, and require it to focus exclusively on organisms actually found in the particular receiving waters into which Hercules discharges.  EPA's testing scheme, Hercules contends, is \"contrary to the statutory requirement that EPA design its standards to fit the characteristics of Specific water bodies in terms of 'the toxicity of the pollutant' In those waters and 'the importance of the affected organisms' In those waters.\"  Brief of Petitioner Hercules at 59 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with EPA's interpretation of the statute.  See, e. g., E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Train, 430 U.S. at 134-35, 97 S.Ct. 965.  As reported, the House version of the 1972 Act, H.R. 11896, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. &#167; 307(a)(1) &amp; (2) (1972) (emphasis added), contained a factor for toxic standards related to local conditions, as Hercules would prefer: \"the usual or potential presence of the affected organisms In (The receiving ) Waters.\"  The Senate version did not include any factors relating to \"affected organisms.\"  S. 2770, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. &#167; 307 (1971).  In conference, the House factors were accepted, but the phrase \"in the receiving waters\" was replaced by \"in any waters.\"  The Conference Report notes:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>Sections 307(a)(1) and (2) are the same as the comparable provisions of the House amendment, except that the Administrator is required to take into account the usual or potential presence of the affected organisms In any water rather than in the receiving waters as is provided in the House amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1 Senate Comm. on Public Works, 93d Cong., 1st Sess., A Legislative History of the Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (hereafter, Legislative History) at 312 (Comm.Print 1973) (emphasis added).  Senator Muskie, a conference manager, explained that the substitution was a compromise to preserve the \"categorical determination\" established by the Senate in lieu of the focus on particular \"receiving waters\" in the House version:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>With regard to toxic pollutant control, the Senate bill and the House amendment differed in provisions for determining whether a pollutant would, in fact, be toxic.  The House amendment proposed that there be an examination of the effect of a pollutant on receiving waters to determine toxicity.  The Senate bill established a general test in order to assure a categorical determination as to which pollutants were toxic and which were not.  The Conference agreement provides specific tests for toxicity as proposed by the House But retains the categorical determination established by the Senate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1 Legislative History at 173 (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Conference Committee's focus on a \"categorical determination\" rather than on specific \"receiving waters\" reflected a drafters' leitmotif in the 1972 Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a> Pre-1972 attempts at water pollution control had been based upon characteristics of local bodies of receiving water.  For that reason, in part, they failed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>The earliest version of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act was passed in 1948 and amended five times before 1972.  Throughout that 24 year period, Congress attempted to use receiving water quality as a basis for setting pollution standards.  W. Rodgers, Environmental Law 355-57 (1977).  At the end of that period, Congress realized not only that its water pollution efforts until then had failed, but also that reliance on receiving water capacity as a crucial test for permissible pollution levels had contributed greatly to that failure.  EPA v. State Water Resources Control Board, 426 U.S. 200, 202, 96 S.Ct. 2022, 48 L.Ed.2d 578 (1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Costle, 191 U.S.App.D.C. 309 at 340, 590 F.2d 1011 at 1042 (1978).  The 1972 Act remedied that shortcoming by shifting its focus from difficult-to-measure conditions and benefits in local receiving waters to readily determinable categorical consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>Congress concluded that water pollution seriously harmed the environment, and that although the cost of control would be heavy, the nation would benefit from controlling that pollution.  Yet scientific uncertainties made it difficult to assess the benefits to particular bodies of receiving water. . . . Under the new statutory scheme, Congress clearly intended us to avoid such problems of proof so that a set of regulations with enforceable impact is possible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 337-340, 590 F.2d at 1039-1042.  See also E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Train, 430 U.S. at 127, 97 S.Ct. 965.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying a categorical approach, EPA did not limit its study to the aquatic life found in receiving waters for toxaphene discharges.  Instead, EPA tested six important marine species, and from the results of these tests, it inferred the likely sensitivity of other species.  Specifically, it chose the most sensitive species actually tested (pinfish), and used the test results from that species to set the ambient water criterion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The choice of the most sensitive species actually tested may be understood on at least two levels.  Legally, section 307(a)(4)'s fundamental instruction is that EPA's standards should provide an \"ample margin of safety.\"  Basing the scheme upon the most sensitive species actually tested provides a margin of safety for less sensitive species.  Scientifically, the scheme rests upon a statistical assumption:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p>Reliable toxicity data exist for a relatively small percent of all organisms in the aquatic environment for any given substance.  It seems a safe assumption to make, that as additional species are tested, some of them are going to be more resistant than those that have already been tested and some are going to be more sensitive. . . . If we consider the thousands of species of aquatic organisms which exist in our waterways and assume that only one hundred of these species are important enough to protect for the purpose of man's use; and if we further consider that perhaps only a half dozen species at most have been tested in most instances, it is highly probable that in any given water, species of greater sensitivity than those already tested, occur.  Therefore, it would appear that the Use of the most sensitive species tested, to establish acceptable levels, may not be overly conservative, since so few species have been tested and more sensitive important species surely exist.  Furthermore, should one of the food chain species be sensitive and essential, an entire food pyramid would be jeopardized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">App. I 255-56 (Affidavit of Dr. Donald I.

Scope of Review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The applicable scope of review is discussed in EDF v. EPA (PCBs ), 194 U.S.App.D.C. at --- - ---, 598 F.2d at 82-83.  EPA's determinations are subject to review under the \"substantial evidence\" test, which requires that EPA's conclusions be supported by \"such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support (the) conclusion(s).\"  Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 217, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938).  When agency rulemaking is based on judgments \"on the frontiers of scientific knowledge,\" this standard calls for deferential review of the agency's conclusions that \"depend to a greater extent upon policy judgments.\"  Industrial Union Department, AFL-CIO v. Hodgson, 162 U.S.App.D.C. 331, 338, 499 F.2d 467, 474-75 (1974).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, we are called upon to review a Numerical standard for discharge.  In reviewing a numerical standard, we must ask whether the agency's numbers are within a \"zone of reasonableness,\" not whether its numbers are precisely right.  See, e. g., FPC v. Conway Corp., 426 U.S. 271, 278, 96 S.Ct. 1999, 48 L.Ed.2d 626 (1976) (electric power rates); Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U.S. 747, 796-98, 88 S.Ct. 1344, 20 L.Ed.2d 312 (1968) (natural gas rates); New York v. United States, 331 U.S. 284, 344, 67 S.Ct. 1207, 91 L.Ed. 1492 (1947) (rail rates); Bilingual Bicultural Coalition on Mass Media v. FCC, 193 U.S.App.D.C. 236 at 244, 595 F.2d 621 at 629 (1978) (en banc) (minority workforce statistics); Federation of Homemakers v. Schmidt, 176 U.S.App.D.C. 261, 264-65, 539 F.2d 740, 743-44 (1976) (food content standards).  A principal rationale for the \"zone of reasonableness\" concept is that it frees the court from the minutiae of particular calculations, and correspondingly, it allows an agency discretion to adapt a general formula or methodology to the aspects of a particular case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hercules argues that EPA failed to respond adequately to, or to rebut, its showing on particular issues.  We shall discuss these issues individually.  However, as a preliminary matter, we observe that the toxics provision places the burden of persuasion (in the agency hearing) on the person urging modification of the proposed standard. \"(U )Nless the Administrator finds, on the record, that a Modification of such proposed standard (or prohibition) is justified based upon a preponderance of evidence adduced at such hearings, such standard (or prohibition) shall be promulgated.\"  Section 307(a)(2) (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a> Since Hercules urged EPA to modify the proposed standard (that is, to promulgate a more relaxed, revised standard), the burden of proof in the agency hearing was on Hercules, not EPA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p>D.

EPA's policy judgments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although EPA's categorical focus led it to favor a laboratory approach, that focus did not preclude consideration of field data.  Indeed, it considered past fish kills, bird kills, human poisonings, and other incidents, 42 Fed.Reg. 2602-03, as well as Dr. Reimold's Brunswick Estuary studies, Id. at 2604-05.  However, EPA concluded that, in this particular case, the Brunswick Estuary study should not be accorded much weight both because of the inherent limitations of such a study and because of the particular limitations on Dr. Reimold's technique.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hercules vigorously disputes EPA's conclusion about the Brunswick Estuary study.  It argues that EPA failed to present evidence to rebut Dr. Reimold's study; that neither the Administrator, nor the judicial officer assigned to the proceeding, Ms. Harriet Marple, had sufficient scientific training to reject Dr. Reimold's approach; and, that the rejection of the field study was unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The scientific uncertainty attending the choice is demonstrated dramatically by the different alternatives advanced by Hercules and EPA, each propounded by different scientists.  The choice of a suitable technique for estimating toxicity risks is a decision \"on the frontiers of scientific knowledge.\"  The relative scientific and administrative advantages of different techniques are incapable of precise comparison by this court.  Decision between the alternatives is a quintessential policy judgment within the discretion of EPA.  We cannot accept Hercules' notion that the administrator of the agency created to protect the environment lacked even the Capability to exercise the discretion with which he was entrusted by Congress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hercules contends that EPA failed to \"rebut\" the Reimold study with testimony from experts in Dr. Reimold's field of expertise, ecological analyses.  The short answer is that EPA had expert evidence on which it could, and did, base its refusal to credit Dr. Reimold's study with more weight.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a> Moreover, we would not impose on EPA a wooden requirement that when, as in this case, there is conflicting testimony from experts in different fields (here, toxicology and ecology), EPA may only accept the evidence from one field if it rebuts, point-by-point, the evidence from the other field.  Certainly, EPA may compare evidence from different fields, and make a reasoned determination thereon.  The issue is not whether EPA has substantial evidence from every scientific field, but whether it has substantial evidence on the record as a whole.  Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 488, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951); See FPC v. Florida Power &amp; Light Co., 404 U.S. 453, 462-67, 92 S.Ct. 637, 30 L.Ed.2d 600 (1972).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, we uphold EPA's decision to set a mass limitation restating its effluent discharge standard.  See text at --- - --- of 194 U.S.App.D.C., at 103-104 of 598 F.2d Supra.  EPA set a mass limitation in order that its effluent discharge standard would not be subverted; its standard would thus be met, not by dilution of effluent with uncontaminated water,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a> but by treatment of the effluent.  The 1972 Act favors toxic substance abatement rather than dilution.  Section 101(a)(3), 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1251(a)(3) (1976) (emphasis added) expresses a \"national policy that the discharge of toxic pollutants in toxic Amounts be prohibited.\"  Obviously, this national policy will be frustrated if discharge of a toxic substance continues in the same amount, but merely in diluted form.  During public hearings on the 1972 Act, then-Administrator Ruckelshaus testified that \"we don't believe that the solution to pollution is dilution.\" 2 Legislative History at 1228.  Congress accepted his position and \"(t)he Conference substitute (for the Senate and House bills) specifically bans pollution dilution as an alternative to waste treatment.\" 1 Legislative History at 284.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this respect, we draw support from cases involving clean air legislation that rejected dilution and dispersion of pollutants as a means of compliance.

Although the support that other tests and studies lend to the standard is not as direct as that provided by the pinfish data, those tests and studies are mostly decidedly part of the agency's cumulative evidence.

It contends that consideration of feasibility is required by \"reasoned decision making\" and principles of \"rational\" consideration.  Velsicol maintains that the standard under review is, in fact, not achievable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a> Velsicol refers to Bunker Hill Co. v.

Manor Drug Stores,  421 U.S. 723, 756, 95 S.Ct. 1917, 44 L.Ed.2d 539 (1975) (Powell, J., concurring)).  Section 307(a)(2) requires EPA to \"take into account\" six factors in proposing toxics standards that comprehensively cover the fate of toxic substances in the environment, their effects on living organisms in general, and their effects on some organisms present and important in particular.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a> EDF v. EPA (PCBs), 194 U.S.App.D.C. at --- - ---, 598 F.2d at 79-80.  None of the six factors speaks explicitly to the technical means used to control the discharge of substances, nor is there present any term commonly used to denote a feasibility consideration, E. g., feasibility, achievability, practicability, economic impact, or cost.  Cf. section 304(b)(1) &amp; (2), 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1314(b)(1) &amp; (2) (1976) (speaking of practicability and achievability).  Section 307(a) itself provides for consideration of no other factors.  Cf. section 304(b)(1)(B) &amp; (2) (B) &amp; (4)(B), 33 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1314(b)(1)(B) &amp; (2)(B) &amp; (4)(B) (1977) (EPA may take into account \"such other factors as the Administrator deems appropriate.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An examination of other provisions of the 1972 Act reinforces this interpretation of section 307(a).  Section 307(a)(4) directs EPA to set standards providing \"an ample margin of safety,\" without any mention of feasibility criteria.  Further, we do not believe that section 307(a)(5) introduces feasibility criteria into the statutory scheme.  Section 307(a)(5) states that \"(w)hen proposing or promulgating any effluent standard (or prohibition) under this section, the Administrator shall designate the category or categories of sources to which the effluent standard (or prohibition) shall apply.\"  The legislative history makes clear that categories would be differentiated not by the feasibility Vel non of pollution control, but by the extent to which a toxic substance is present in the industrial process.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative background explains why Congress focused on public and environmental protection, rather than discharge control technology, in the setting of toxic standards.  The regulatory scheme is similar to that of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970, Pub.L.No. 91-604, 84 Stat. 1676, which distinguished between pollutants subject to technology-based regulation under section 111, and hazardous substances, subject to health-based regulation under section 112.  Recognizing that \"certain pollutants\" required special treatment because of risk to health, Congress enacted section 112, dealing with hazardous pollutants, without provision for considerations of feasibility. 1 Senate Comm. on Public Works, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., A Legislative History of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 (hereafter, Clean Air Legislative History) at 133 (Comm.Print 1974) (remarks of Sen.  Muskie) (The Senate subcommittee on Air and Water Pollution \"was presented with strong evidence that any level of emissions of certain pollutants may produce adverse health effects that cannot be tolerated.\"  Id. at 227.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1972 Act continued this distinction, adopting technology-based standards for pollutants in general and health-based standards for toxic pollutants.  Compare sections 301 &amp; 304(b), 33 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1311 &amp; 1314(b) (1976) With section 307(a).  \"The Committee considers that the discharge of toxic pollutants are much too dangerous to be permitted on merely economic grounds.\" 1 Legislative History at 800 (House Report).  In light of this clear statutory wording and legislative history, it is not surprising that numerous commentators agree that considerations of technological and economic feasibility do not play a part in standard-setting for toxic substances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fn40_ref\">40</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Velsicol argues that, if feasibility is not considered, the regulations will be promulgated at an irrationally strict level.  However, the congressional selection of factors is a legislative determination that the need of the public and the environment for protection from toxic chemicals is more important than the problems of stringent regulation.  This congressional determination is a rational response to the dangers presented by toxic substances.  The meaning of the statute being clear, it is not this court's prerogative to impose considerations of feasibility.  See Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153, 98 S.Ct. 2279, 57 L.Ed.2d 117 (1978); Union Electric Co. v. EPA, 427 U.S. 246, 96 S.Ct. 2518, 49 L.Ed.2d 474 (1976).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn41-1\" id=\"fn41-1_ref\">41</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It may also be argued that, as a practical matter, it will prove very difficult to administer the statute without considering feasibility, because of the resistance of industry representatives and environmentalists to what will be perceived by them, respectively, as overly or underly stringent regulation.  However, our interpretation, which follows in large part EPA's original interpretation of section 307(a), will not necessarily lead to great difficulty in administering the section, because it does not preclude EPA from gathering information about feasibility.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn42-1\" id=\"fn42-1_ref\">42</a> Availability of information about feasibility may tend to induce industry and environmentalists to accept standards based on health criteria.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Velsicol points out that EPA did consider feasibility in the proceedings leading to the regulations in issue.  Indeed, Velsicol contends that EPA first set its endrin standard in accordance with feasibility criteria and then justified it with evidence related to the section 307(a)(2) factors.  This argument raises the possibility that we must remand the agency's standards on the grounds that EPA took an erroneous step in its deliberations.  See SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 196-97, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947).  However, upon careful examination of the manner in which EPA considered feasibility evidence, we conclude that a remand is unwarranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">EPA's consideration of feasibility is more understandable in light of the history of toxics proceedings.  In 1973 and 1974, EPA conducted proceedings for promulgating regulations under section 112 of the Clean Air Act and section 307(a).  In both the air and the water proceedings, EPA expressly excluded from consideration evidence concerning the economics of pollution control, although it had gathered such evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn43\" id=\"fn43_ref\">43</a> The 1973-74 toxics proceedings under section 307(a) ended in failure; EPA did not adopt toxic pollutant regulations.  See EDF v. EPA (PCBs), 194 U.S.App.D.C. at --- - ---, 598 F.2d at 68-69 (discussing this period in detail).  EPA's failure was partially due to its fear of \"almost certain challenge in court.\" 41 Fed.Reg. 23577 (1976).  Out of an abundance of caution, EPA altered its position after 1974 to allow limited consideration of feasibility.  In part, it did so on the basis of judicial authority, since overruled, that directed it to consider feasibility in the context of another health-based statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn44\" id=\"fn44_ref\">44</a> EPA's position served to build an administrative record that could support its regulations on appeal if feasibility were ultimately held to be a factor under section 307(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have concluded that section 307(a) does not include feasibility as a factor for consideration.  However, the fact that EPA considered evidence about feasibility does not require that the regulations be vacated.  It is apparent that EPA calculated its endrin standards using health-based, not feasibility-related, evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn45\" id=\"fn45_ref\">45</a> It conducted bioassays of aquatic species, determined the maximum long-term dose of endrin that the most sensitive tested species could tolerate, set an ambient water criterion, and calculated effluent standards and mass limitations.  Only then, upon calculating its standards, did it consider evidence about feasibility to provide an additional test. 42 Fed.Reg. 2597-600.  It found that the standards were, in fact, feasible.  Although consideration of feasibility is not contemplated by section 307(a), EPA's consideration of it did not affect its conclusions based on the factors specified by section 307(a), but constituted an attempt to confer additional legitimacy on its conclusions.  The supererogatory consideration did not prejudice Velsicol in any way.  Indeed, Velsicol actually gained an additional opportunity to press for relaxed standards by presenting evidence that the standards were not achievable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not find support in the record or in the administrative decision for Velsicol's contention that EPA proceeded \"backwards\" in setting the endrin standards.  Velsicol invites the court to probe the Administrator's mental processes in search of an alternative methodology for his decision other than the evidence and the reasons stated.  We must decline this invitation.  See Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 420, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971); United States v.

See App.  I 355-59.  In considering toxicity, it summarized studies showing that endrin was toxic to a broad range of invertebrates, fish, birds, and mammals.  App. I 94-107.  Evidence concerning the carcinogenicity of endrin in mice and rats had been produced, 41 Fed.Reg. 31316-17 (1976) (establishing \"rebuttable presumption\" against continued registration of endrin as a pesticide) and new evidence concerning this was presented in these proceedings, 42 Fed.Reg. 2591-93.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn46\" id=\"fn46_ref\">46</a> Endrin was demonstrated to be persistent and mobile in some circumstances, and while it was sometimes degraded or eliminated, it was bioaccumulated in many organisms.

Pink shrimp was the most sensitive species actually tested, with a short-term lethal dose of .037 parts per billion.  To estimate a long-term safe dose for shrimp, EPA multiplied the short-term lethal dose by an \"application factor\" of .1, a figure derived from endrin tests on an invertebrate, one type of stonefly that is found in mountain streams.  EPA then calculated the long-term safe dose for pink shrimp, and it set the ambient water criterion for endrin at .004 parts per billion.  See 42 Fed.Reg. 2593-94.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Velsicol challenges EPA's use of shrimp toxicity data and stonefly application factor data.  It notes that pink shrimp are not exposed to Velsicol's endrin discharges until the endrin travels over 700 miles along the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico, and that stoneflies of this species are not exposed to Velsicol's discharges at all.  See Brief of Petitioner Velsicol at 12-16.  It argues that data were available for species that do live in the Mississippi, and that EPA should not have preferred the shrimp and stonefly data over data for species in the local receiving waters.  As we discussed in connection with EPA's tests on pinfish in setting toxaphene standards, Congress intended that EPA would use categorical determinations in setting standards for toxic pollutants, rather than limit its consideration to species present in receiving waters.  EPA's decision sets forth at length the reasons for selecting the shrimp and stonefly data as the basis for the standards. 42 Fed.Reg. 2593-94.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn47\" id=\"fn47_ref\">47</a> Choice among scientific test data is precisely the type of judgment that must be made by EPA, not this court. \"It is in just such matters that the findings of (EPA), because of its experience and the assistance of its technical staff, should be accorded the greatest weight and the courts should be most hesitant to substitute their judgment for that of (EPA).\"  FPC v.

Having set an ambient water criteria for endrin of .004 parts per billion, EPA set an effluent discharge standard using a \"mixing zone\" factor.  It employed a mixing factor of 375, anticipating that one part of effluent would be mixed with about 375 parts of water before aquatic organisms had significant contact with endrin.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn48\" id=\"fn48_ref\">48</a> As a backstop, EPA also provided for a \"tightening variance\" a smaller mixing zone factor for any discharges in waters where mixing is likely to be less thorough. 42 Fed.Reg. 2609, 2614-15.  Velsicol contends that the evidence supports a larger mixing zone factor, up to 4,000 in view of the volume and flow of the Mississippi River, and that EPA must also provide for \"loosening\" variances (large mixing zone factors for thoroughly-mixed waters).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We sustain EPA's decision with respect to the mixing zone factor.  The issue of mixing zones is a controversial one.  One leading commentator on section 307(a) argued that the 1972 Act \"probably does not allow mixing zones at all,\" since Congress banned pollution dilution as an alternative to waste treatment.  K. Hall, The Control of Toxic Pollutants Under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 63 Iowa L.Rev. 609, 628 &amp; n. 109 (1978).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn49\" id=\"fn49_ref\">49</a> On the other hand, Velsicol urges that EPA should take into account the full diluting capacity of the Mississippi, based on the volume, flow, geographical configuration, and other factors that go into calculations about particular receiving waters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">EPA's decision to use a moderate mixing zone factor and to make provision only for \"tightening,\" not loosening, variances must be deemed a rational, although simple, compromise.  By prescribing that EPA focus on categorical factors rather than on characteristics of local receiving waters, Congress sought to keep toxics regulation from becoming ensnarled in disputes over the characteristics of particular local waters, a complex matter Congress left to the setting of water quality standards under section 303, 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1313 (1976).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn50\" id=\"fn50_ref\">50</a> Section 307 regulation was to focus on toxicity and related characteristics of pollutants.

Petitioners maintain that section 554 applies to all proceedings \"on the record.\"  See Reply Brief for Petitioner Hercules at 12-13.  Second, petitioners argue that a \"functional\" analysis of these proceedings shows that EPA must follow section 554.  We cannot agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 554 is entitled \"Adjudications\" and, by its express terms, applies in cases of \"Adjudication required by statute to be determined on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing.\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 554 (emphasis added).  It is well settled that section 554 applies only in cases of adjudication, and not to rulemaking proceedings.  Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc. v. Kleindienst, 478 F.2d 1, 13 (3d Cir. 1973); Willapoint Oysters, Inc. v. Ewing, 174 F.2d 676, 692-94 (9th Cir.), Cert. denied, 338 U.S. 860, 70 S.Ct. 101, 94 L.Ed. 527 (1949).  Thus, the issue before us is whether section 307(a) requires adjudication or rulemaking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We commence our analysis with the APA definitions. \"Adjudication\" is defined in the APA as \"agency process for the formulation of an order.\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 551(7) (1976).  An \"order\" means \"the whole or a part of a final disposition . . . in a matter other than rule making.\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 551(6) (1976).  \"Rule making\" is defined as \"agency process for formulating, amending, or repealing a rule.\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 551(5) (1976).  The entire definitional scheme of the APA therefore turns on the meaning of \"rule.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The APA defines \"rule\" as \"the whole or a part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy . . .\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 551(4) (1976).  Under the APA definition in section 551(4), the toxic pollutant standards now before us are \"rules.\"  The standards are designed to \"implement\" and \"prescribe law\" pursuant to the authority of the 1972 Act.  See Willapoint Oysters, Inc. v. Ewing, 174 F.2d at 693.  Moreover, the standards had solely \"future effect\"; they did not apply in any way to discharges prior to their promulgation, and, indeed, compliance was not required until January 12, 1978, one full year after they were published in final form. 42 Fed.Reg. 2612; 40 C.F.R. &#167; 129.8(a) (1977).  Thus, in the APA definitional scheme, section 307(a) standards are \"rules,\" and not \"orders\"; the process is \"rule making,\" and not \"adjudication.\"  Accordingly, section 554 is not applicable.  See generally PBW Stock Exchange, Inc. v. SEC, 485 F.2d 718, 732-33 (3d Cir. 1973, Cert. denied, 416 U.S. 969, 94 S.Ct. 1992, 40 L.Ed.2d 558 (1974); American Express Co. v.

That section 307(a) provides a \"hearing\" and findings \"on the record\" is not in any way inconsistent with the view that it calls for rulemaking.  Section 307(a)(2) begins by requiring EPA to propose a standard \"in accordance with section 553 of title 5,\" which explicitly contemplates \"Rules (that) are required by statute to be made On the record after opportunity for an agency Hearing.\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 553(c) (1976) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioners also contend that a \"functional\" analysis of these proceedings demonstrates that they involve adjudication.  In our view, such an analysis is unavailing.  As the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p>The basic distinction between rulemaking and adjudication is illustrated by this Court's treatment of two related cases (Londoner v.

State Board of Equalization, 239 U.S. 441, 36 S.Ct. 141, 60 L.Ed. 372 (1915)) under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. . . . While the line dividing them may not always be a bright one, these decisions represent a recognized distinction in administrative law between proceedings for the purpose of promulgating policy-type rules or standards, on the one hand, and proceedings designed to adjudicate disputed facts in particular cases on the other.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v.

The statutory provision requires EPA to consider issues of general policy with respect to a pollutant, I. e., the significance of its toxicity, degradability, persistence, and effects on affected organisms, rather than issues of fact concerning any particular entity's discharges.  These inquiries are the same whether the substance is discharged by one manufacturer or one thousand.  In short, as we discuss elsewhere, the statute calls for \"categorical,\" not individual or local, determinations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that Velsicol is the sole domestic manufacturer of endrin affected by the standards (and that Hercules contends it is the sole domestic manufacturer discharging toxaphene) does not, Ipso facto, mandate the use of5 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 556 &amp; 557 (1976), Anaconda Co. v.

Moreover, even when only one manufacturer is subject to the standards, that manufacturer is not the only affected entity.  The standards affect the multitude who fish, take drinking water, or otherwise, directly or indirectly, come in contact with waters containing the discharged toxic substance, all of whom may appear in proceedings.  Toxic substances are mobile, and individuals far from the site of discharge may be exposed to them.  Rulemaking, not adjudication, is the appropriate, flexible procedural mechanism to accommodate the input of all concerned.  See Anaconda Co. v. Ruckelshaus, 482 F.2d at 1306.  For these reasons, we agree with the comment in Seacoast Anti-Pollution League v. Costle, 572 F.2d 872, 878 n. 10 (1st Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 824, 99 S.Ct. 94, 57 L.Ed.2d 117 (1978) (dictum) (\"Of the determinations listed in &#167; 509(b) (of the 1972 Act), only one must be on the record by the terms of the (Act).

We set forth the background of these issues in detail because the particular administrative and factual context governs our resolution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As discussed more completely in EDF v. EPA (PCBs), 194 U.S.App.D.C. at ---, ---, 598 F.2d at 68-69, EPA's initial effort at rulemaking for PCBs, toxaphene, and endrin in 1973-74 ended in failure, frustrating Congress's express directive for rapid action.  As Representative Roberts, a conference manager of the House version of the 1977 Amendments later remarked, \"far and away the most severe single problem has been the formal, cumbersome rulemaking process.\" 123 Cong.Rec. H12927 (daily ed. Dec. 15, 1977).  Accordingly, when EPA set out on a renewed effort at toxics regulation in 1976, it took particular care to avoid, within the procedural law existing at that time, unnecessary impediments that might lead to another rulemaking failure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 12, 1976, EPA proposed changes in its procedural hearings on toxic pollutants. 41 Fed.Reg. 1766 (1976).  The proposals relaxed in some measure the existing procedures for notices of hearing, prehearing conferences, taking of evidence, interlocutory review within the agency, and similar matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among the numerous proposals was a change in the use of staff assistance.  Proposed regulation 40 C.F.R. &#167; 104.14(a) stated that \"the Administrator, with such staff assistance as he deems necessary and appropriate, shall review the entire record and prepare and file a tentative decision based thereon.\"  This regulation was intended to replace 40 C.F.R. &#167; 104.16 (1975) known as the \"Ex parte contacts rule\" that had enjoined \"the Administrator or the presiding officer (from) consult(ing) with any person or party on a fact at issue.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn54\" id=\"fn54_ref\">54</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Twenty-eight persons (including Hercules) commented on the proposed rules. 41 Fed.Reg. 17899 (1976).  EPA adopted the proposed staff assistance rule, and in response to comments it had received, set out the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p>Several commenters opposed the proposed deletion of the prohibition on Ex parte discussions appearing in the original rules at Section 104.16.  The Agency proposed to delete this section for the reason that the prohibition on such Ex parte conversations, which is applicable to adjudication, is inapplicable to rulemaking.  The Agency cited considerable case law in support of this point.  Although several of the commenters cited decisions which they claim supported a contrary view, each of the cases cited involved adjudication rather than rulemaking, and are hence inapplicable.  The comments submitted by Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corporation cite K. Davis Administrative Law Treatise, Section 13.00 at 453 (1970 Supp.).  Davis is at the point discussing the separation of prosecutorial and decision-making functions within an administrative Agency, which is closely related to the Ex parte question since the issue with respect to Agency personnel is whether the staff who presents the evidence should be precluded from discussing the regulation with the Administrator out of the presence of the objector's representatives.  Although Professor Davis equivocates on what the policy should be, he leaves no doubt about the law: \"The conclusion seems to be rather solid that no law requires the Commissioner (of FDA) to separate functions in rulemaking for which on-the-record hearings are required\".  Id. p. 443.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p>The rationale for not imposing separation of functions, and the attendant prohibition on communication between those responsible for developing and presenting the proposed rule or standard and the person ultimately charged with promulgation, lies with the nature of rulemaking.  The development of a proposed rule or standard includes a number of policy decisions in which many program offices within the agency participate.  The Administrator relies on the advice and recommendations of these offices in developing and proposing the standards.  At the same time, persons within these offices may well present evidence at rulemaking hearings including information on which the proposed standard was based.  It would be counterproductive to reasoned rulemaking if, at the stage of final decision and promulgation, the administrator were isolated from those within the Agency whom he normally consults on policy determinations and whose offices will be charged with implementation and enforcement of the regulations.  The institutional nature of the Administrator's decision, as noted previously, is inherent in the very nature of rulemaking, and is normally absent from adjudication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p>Because the law clearly does not require the prohibition on Ex parte discussions contained in Section 104.16 as originally promulgated, and because nothing in the rulemaking process warrants its retention, it is deleted as proposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 17902.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">EPA conducted the proceeding now on review under the new procedural rules.  Its chief judicial officer, Ms. Harriet B. Marple, was assigned to aid the Administrator in preparing his final decision.  Ms. Marple was confronted with a loosely organized rulemaking record of enormous detail and staggering complexity thousands of pages of highly technical testimony, affidavits, and studies from a variety of sources to be considered against an uncertain scientific and legal background.  The record had been closed on October 12, 1976.  Under the judicial decree in NRDC v. Train, 8 ERC (BNA) at 2122, and under the deadline imposed by section 307(a)(2), the Administrator had two months or less to issue his final standards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an affidavit for the court, Ms. Marple stated that, when she was assigned to assist in this matter, she met with G.

The mere fact that the final decision was largely in accord with the staff's position does not, without more, establish that the Administrator considered only the staff view and not others.  See Willapoint Oysters, Inc. v. Ewing, 174 F.2d at 689, 692-96.  See also National Nutritional Foods Association v.

Recently, this court has twice held that particular ex parte contacts between private parties and agency decisionmakers in rulemaking were improper.  United States Lines, Inc. v. FMC (Euro-Pacific), 189 U.S.App.D.C. 361, 584 F.2d 519 (1978); Home Box Office, Inc. v. FCC, 185 U.S.App.D.C. at 142, 567 F.2d at 9.  This Court has held that Other ex parte contacts between private parties and agency decisionmakers in rulemaking were Not improper.  Action for Children's Television v. FCC, 183 U.S.App.D.C. 437, 564 F.2d 458 (1977).  None of these cases concerned intra-agency staff contacts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn58\" id=\"fn58_ref\">58</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, we reject any notion that the Administrator or the judicial officer proceeded in bad faith.  The contacts here in no way involved a cabal-like arrangement within the agency.  To the contrary, the contacts were permissible under procedural rules adopted by EPA in 1976 after public comment and legal debate.  The validity of those rules was argued fully, and their justification was set out in detail.  In formulating the procedural rules, EPA relied upon the unquestioned authorities of that time both classic cases in this field and broader matter collected in Professor Davis's treatise.  The staff contacts under those rules were neither furtive, nor improvidently devised.  They were arranged after a conference between the agency's chief judicial officer and its chief legal officials, whose advice was based upon existing case law and agency rules.  While we must now decide whether that advice and those rules were sound in light of subsequent developments, our consideration of this issue does not impeach the good faith with which EPA proceeded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, an examination of the Marple affidavit demonstrates that the Administrator and the judicial officer did not consider or rely on any evidence presented outside the record.  The judicial officer stated that she prepared the final decision under the Administrator's supervision and direction; that she \"relied exclusively upon the record certified by the Administrative Law Judge\"; and that she \"did not rely on any extra-record material.\"  Marple affidavit at 1, 4. Two documents not in the record, one proffered and one possibly proffered to the judicial officer, were simply not considered.  Consultations with staff Counsel (as opposed to non-legal experts) occurred when the judicial officer needed assistance in locating documents and did not concern factual or policy issues.  Id. at 2. Consultation with staff experts was limited to reviewing the record.  We have examined the final decision, this affidavit, and the contentions of the petitioners, and we cannot question, on this basis, the judicial officer's unqualified and detailed averments.  Thus, this case is distinctly not one in which evidence outside the record was considered by the Administrator without being subject to challenge or rebuttal by the parties.  See Seacoast Anti-Pollution League v. Costle, 572 F.2d at 880-82; Doe v. Hampton, 184 U.S.App.D.C. 373, 392-397, 566 F.2d 265, 284-89 (1977) (Robinson, J., dissenting.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Home Box Office, this court held that the wide-ranging Private contacts with the FCC decisionmakers that had occurred were impermissible.  The parties here urge us to decide whether Staff contacts with agency decisionmakers are also impermissible.  Petitioners contend that staff contacts offend the principles underlying the Home Box Office decision no less than private contacts.  In their view, staff contacts deprive the reviewing court of the full and accurate administrative record, Home Box Office, Inc. v. FCC, 185 U.S.App.D.C. at 187-88, 567 F.2d at 54-55; foreclose the opportunity for genuine adversarial discussion among the parties, Id. 185 U.S.App.D.C. at 188-89, 567 F.2d at 55-56; and, most importantly, are inconsistent with fundamental notions of fairness implicit in due process and with the ideal of reasoned decisionmaking, Id. 185 U.S.App.D.C. at 189, 567 F.2d at 56.

The latter, of course, is not subject to any provision of section 5 (5 U.S.C. &#167; 554).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p142\">\n      <span class=\"num\">142</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The House Report for the APA, H.R.Rep.No.1980, 79th Cong., 2d Sess. 14 (1946) U.S.Code Cong.Serv. 1946, p. 1202 states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p143\">\n      <span class=\"num\">143</span>\n      <p>Various agencies objected to any provision for the separation of functions in rule making . . . a suggestion which the present bill carries even further because section 5 which contains the segregation provision does not apply to rule making and in subsection (c) makes additional exemptions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Attorney General's Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act (hereafter, Manual ), which is due some deference because of the role played by the Justice Department in drafting the APA, Vermont Yankee Power Corp. v.

Consistent with our duties, we must not rule on such issues unless and until the concrete elements of the case so demand.  For two reasons, we have determined that EPA's standards must be upheld in this particular context; the broader questions posed by the parties are reserved for another day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p148\">\n      <span class=\"num\">148</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, both the adoption by EPA of its procedural rules and the issuance of the final decision preceded Home Box Office.  In Action for Children's Television, Inc. v. FCC, 183 U.S.App.D.C. at 453, 564 F.2d at 474, this court considered the strong reliance of administrative agencies and the public on established precedent and specifically \"h(e)ld only that Home Box Office's broad proscription is not to be applied retroactively in the case Sub judice inasmuch as it constitutes a clear departure from established law.\"  Because EPA relied expressly on established precedent in promulgating its hearing rules, the holding of Action for Children's Television applies with particular force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p149\">\n      <span class=\"num\">149</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the administrative history under section 307(a) created a peculiar context wherein the necessity for staff contacts existed with unusual and compelling force.  As we have noted, section 307(a) sets forth rigid and compressed timetables.  Previous EPA failures to meet these timetables resulted in a judicial decree fixing the time for rulemaking.  NRDC v. Train, 8 ERC (BNA) at 2128.  These congressional and judicial time restraints were imposed to minimize the period during which the public and the environment would be exposed to toxic substances.  The administrative delay would not only have been contrary to law, but would also have increased exposure to hazardous substances.  In view of the extraordinary bulk and complexity of the administrative record, a judicial officer attempting to digest the record and prepare a decision in a matter of weeks would face, at the least, great difficulty in proceeding without staff assistance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn63\" id=\"fn63_ref\">63</a> Thus, this context invokes the rule of ancient origin that expedition in protecting the public health justifies less elaborate procedure than may be required in other contexts.  See, e. g., Ewing v. Mytinger &amp; Casselberry, Inc., 339 U.S. 594, 70 S.Ct. 870, 94 L.Ed. 1088 (1950); Adams v. Milwaukee, 228 U.S. 572, 584, 33 S.Ct. 610, 57 L.Ed. 971 (1913); North American Cold Storage Co. v. Chicago, 211 U.S. 306, 319-20, 29 S.Ct. 101, 53 L.Ed. 195 (1908).  See also United States v.

The fact that the attorneys who represented the staff's position at the administrative hearing were later consulted by the judicial officer who prepared the final decision possibly gives rise to an appearance of unfairness, even though the consultations did not involve factual or policy issues.  During congressional deliberation on the APA, the flexibility of rulemaking procedures was of concern, as the bill's sponsor indicated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p152\">\n      <span class=\"num\">152</span>\n      <p>Mr. President, as I have pointed out before, this bill is designed to operate as a whole, and its provisions are closely interrelated.  At the same time, it should be pointed out that here are certain provisions which touch upon subjects long regarded as of the highest importance.  On some of these subjects, such as the separation of examiners from the agencies they serve, there has been a wide divergence of views.  The committee has, in such cases, taken the course which it believes will suffice, without being excessive.  Amendatory or supplementary legislation can supply any deficiency which experience discloses in such cases.  The committee believes that special note should be made of these situations:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p153\">\n      <span class=\"num\">153</span>\n      <p>The exemption of rule making and determining applications for licenses, From provisions of sections 5(c) (5 U.S.C. &#167; 554(d)), 7(c), and 8(a) May require change if, in practice, it develops that they are too broad.  The committee believes it has followed sound discretion in selection of the language used, and it is the feeling of the committee that, where cases present sharply contested issues of fact, agencies should not as a matter of good practice take advantage of the exemptions (in 5 U.S.C. &#167; 554(d)(A)-(C)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p154\">\n      <span class=\"num\">154</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">92 Cong.Rec. 2159 (1946) (remarks of Sen.

As we have discussed, until 1976, EPA banned intra-agency contacts in hearings such as these.  EPA lifted this ban in 1976 in response to a peculiar situation of past failure and current necessity.  Now might be a particularly propitious time for Congress or the agencies to limit or provide disclosure of post-hearing contacts between staff advocates and decisionmakers.

In this connection, Hercules asserts, and EPA does not now contest, that 5 U.S.C. &#167; 557(b) (1976) is applicable.  Section 557(b) provides that if, as in this case, the Administrator did not preside at the reception of evidence, either the employee who did preside shall issue a recommended decision, or the Administrator may issue a tentative decision himself.  Section 557(b)(2) further provides that the Administrator may omit the tentative decision if he finds on the record that \"due and timely execution of (his) functions imperatively and unavoidably so requires.\"  EPA's procedural rules contain a very similar provision, but add that \"due and timely execution of his functions, include(s) compliance with time limitations established by law.\" 40 C.F.R. &#167; 104.14(c) (1977).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn66\" id=\"fn66_ref\">66</a> In his decision, the Administrator found explicitly that \"the preparation and filing of a tentative decision . . . should be omitted,\" because \"the filing of (the) decision had been delayed past the statutory deadline and past the deadline stipulated in the consent agreement in NRDC v. Train.\" 42 Fed.Reg. 2588.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have seen, section 307(a) was a dramatic congressional attempt to limit immediately and certainly the discharge of highly toxic substances into the nation's waterways.  In attempting to cope with what was perceived as a particularly acute problem, Congress mandated a strict timetable for EPA.  Thus, section 307(a) contained two directives to EPA that were difficult to reconcile.  On one hand, section 307 was \"saddled with extraordinary procedural preliminaries.\"  W. Rodgers, Environmental Law 481 (1977).  On the other hand, Congress legislated a precise timetable for the Administrator's promulgation of standards for toxics based on an unmistakable concern for the immediacy of implementation of the scheme.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn67\" id=\"fn67_ref\">67</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately, experience proved that EPA was unable to meet the congressionally imposed timetable.  See EDF v. EPA (PCBs), 189 U.S.App.D.C. at --- - ---, 598 F.2d at 68-69.  For purposes of this discussion, we need note only two aspects of EPA's experience.  First, by 1976, when EPA proposed the toxaphene standards now under review, it was already years behind schedule in every respect.  Second, suit had already been brought against the Administrator to compel immediate action under section 307(a).  The result of those suits was a judicially approved consent agreement under which</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p>The Administrator (was to) propose standards pursuant to Section 307(a) of the Act for aldrin/dieldrin, DDT (DDD, DDE), endrin, and toxaphene on or before May 31, 1976; and for benzidine on or before June 22, 1976; and for polychlorinatal biphenyls (PCB's) on or before July 14, 1976.  Not later than six months following proposal of each set of such standards, the Administrator (was to) promulgate final standards for each of such pollutants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p161\">\n      <span class=\"num\">161</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">NRDC v. Train, 8 ERC (BNA) at 2128-29.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn68\" id=\"fn68_ref\">68</a> Thus, with respect to toxaphene, EPA was required under the current decree to promulgate standards before the end of 1976.  EPA proposed new toxaphene standards on June 10, 1976, 41 Fed.Reg. 23576, held its formal rulemaking hearing from July 19 to October 12, and filed its final decision on January 3, 1977.  There was no tentative decision. 42 Fed.Reg. 2588.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p162\">\n      <span class=\"num\">162</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, the presence of the statutory deadline and the consent decree deadline amply justify the Administrator's actions.  The rulemaking in this case was characterized by voluminous submissions, a complex subject matter, and highly contested issues against the backdrop of judicial and statutory deadlines.  As a practical matter, to issue and receive meaningful comment on a tentative decision is a process that would necessarily require time.  EPA faced a choice among three basic possibilities: (1) to abridge the hearing process and the preparation of the final decision; (2) to miss the deadlines by a significant margin;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn69\" id=\"fn69_ref\">69</a> or (3) to omit the tentative decision.  Absent substantial prejudice to Hercules, the Administrator was entitled to make the third choice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn70\" id=\"fn70_ref\">70</a> Hercules alleges that it was prejudiced because it had no prior indication of EPA's position with respect to the Reimold study.  Even assuming Arguendo that EPA's position on that matter required a further round of argument by Hercules, Hercules could have sought reconsideration by EPA.

COMPLIANCE TIME.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p165\">\n      <span class=\"num\">165</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the 1972 Act's regulatory scheme, EPA sets discharge standards under the various statutory sections, and the standards are then incorporated into permits issued to dischargers which permit the maximum amount of pollutants that may be discharged.  However, a special exception to this scheme is made in the area of toxic pollutant regulation. \"Compliance with a permit issued pursuant to this section shall be deemed compliance (with the statutory standards) . . . except any standard imposed under (section 307) for a toxic pollutant Injurious to human health.\"  Section 402(k) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1342(k) (1976) (emphasis added).  Thus, dischargers must meet newly established toxics standards even before their permits have been (or may be) revised to include them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn71\" id=\"fn71_ref\">71</a> EPA contends this provision applies to its toxaphene and endrin standards.  Hercules responds that toxaphene is not \"injurious to human health\" within the meaning of the statute, because the current level of toxaphene discharges is not creating a human health hazard.  Velsicol also argues that the one-year compliance period should be extended because section 53(b) of the Clean Water Act of 1977, 33 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1317(a)(6) (1977) allows EPA to set a longer time for compliance than the maximum specified in the 1972 Act (if it determines that compliance within that time is technologically infeasible for a category of sources).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p166\">\n      <span class=\"num\">166</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject petitioners' arguments and uphold EPA's requirement of swift compliance with the newly set toxics standards.  The 1972 Act is replete with declarations that swift compliance with toxics standards is the normal, not the exceptional, circumstance that petitioners would make it.  Section 307(a)(6) provides that \"(a)ny effluent standard (or prohibition) established pursuant to this section shall take effect on such date or dates as specified in the order promulgating such standard, but in no case, more than one year from the date of such promulgation.\"  As the legislative history of the 1972 Act explains:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p167\">\n      <span class=\"num\">167</span>\n      <p>Because of the hazards posed by toxic substances, the committee considers the need for compliance with promulgated standards for toxic substances to be especially urgent.  Language in section (307(a)(6)) is thus intended to convey that one year be an Absolute maximum time allowed for compliance with standards promulgated under this section, and that compliance be required As early as possible within this limit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p168\">\n      <span class=\"num\">168</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2 Legislative History at 1479 (Senate Report) (emphasis added).  This command is reinforced by the declaration of purpose in section 101(a)(3) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1251(a)(3) (1976), that \"it is the national policy that the discharge of toxic pollutants in toxic amounts be prohibited.\"  This policy, in contrast to others declared in section 101(a), was intended to be implemented rapidly.  See note 67 Supra.  Because of EPA's failure to carry out Congress's mandate for rapid action concerning toxics, See EDF v. EPA (PCBs), 189 U.S.App.D.C. at --- - ---, 598 F.2d at 68-69, it is easy to lose sight of Congress's original intention that toxics be dealt with quickly.  However, we will not interpret the 1972 Act as though delay in toxics control were an acceptable result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p169\">\n      <span class=\"num\">169</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hercules points out that the term \"injurious to human health\" must have been intended to distinguish some toxic substances that are \"injurious\" from others that are not.  It contends that since all toxic substances are likely to be \"injurious\" in some amount, for the term to make a meaningful distinction, it must require proof that the toxic substance creates a human health hazard in the amount now being discharged.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn72\" id=\"fn72_ref\">72</a> EPA concluded that a less restrictive view of the term would make it meaningful.  As EPA interpreted the statute, the test should be whether the toxic substance would injure humans in \"relatively small quantities.\" 42 Fed.Reg. 2601.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn73\" id=\"fn73_ref\">73</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p170\">\n      <span class=\"num\">170</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We adopt EPA's interpretation.  Nowhere in the Act's approach to toxics is there any requirement that EPA determine what quantities of a toxic substance are now being discharged.  Hercules' view would require EPA to investigate and determine local discharge conditions, while EPA's view allows a categorical approach to toxicity measurements similar to that used in section 307(a).  See Text accompanying notes 23-27 Supra.  Velsicol's argument based on the Clean Water Act of 1977 is similarly unpersuasive.  The fact that the Clean Water Act of 1977 gave EPA discretionary authority to allow a longer compliance time does not necessarily imply or suggest that the pre-existing maximum one-year period was always to be considered excessively stringent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p171\">\n      <span class=\"num\">171</span>\n      <p>VII.

EPA assumed that few aquatic organisms are exposed to the concentrated discharge, while most will face only a mixed, attenuated toxaphene solution.  In this case, EPA considered it reasonable to expect that such post-discharge mixing would attenuate toxaphene effluent by a factor of 300.  Therefore, EPA set an average daily effluent discharge limit of 1.5 parts per billion, since that would produce, after attenuation through mixing by a factor of 300, an ambient water level of .005 parts per billion.

In the two adsorptive methods, waste water passes over an adsorbent substance (either activated carbon, which has been used for similar purposes in cigarette filters, or a synthetic resin) to which the endrin binds.

We welcome measures that may help to avoid the necessity of judicial review, and thus may further the administration of this statute.  It may well be that in toxics proceedings, industry will find little to gain in refusing to acquiesce in standards when information shows that they are achievable, and environmentalists, not desiring to erode public support for toxics regulation, will find little to gain in refusing to acquiesce in standards when information shows that stricter standards would not be readily achievable.

We do not believe that our view will lead EPA to use mixing zone factors for incorporating miscellaneous factors in its formulae.  If EPA believes that the standards resulting from its six-step calculation are too high or too low because of considerations such as the relative strength (or weakness) of particular toxicity data, the importance of particular affected organisms, and similar matters set forth in section 307(a)(2), it should adjust its standards by an appropriate coefficient, rather than by altering the mixing zone factor.

One strand of the court's analysis was that section 509(b) of the Act contemplates formal adjudications by EPA, yet the only statutory provision listed in section 509(b) that uses the term \"on the record\" is section 307(a)(2).

Section 307(a)(2).  To be sure, this finding is an integral part of the promulgation of \"a revised effluent standard (or prohibition).\"  Unless this finding is made, a revised standard may not be promulgated.

While the alternative of designating a responsible employee of the Agency to prepare a recommended decision is deleted, the new provision expressly recognizes the fact that in reviewing the entire record and preparing a tentative decision within the extremely tight time constraints of Section 307(a), the Administrator will have to utilize staff assistance.  This is routine practice in most federal administrative agencies, and is essential given the workloads and responsibilities of the officials at the top of such agencies. . . .</p>\n        <p>Finally, the former provision in &#167; 104.16 with respect to ex parte discussions has been deleted as unnecessary.  The statutory language together with the framework provided by these rules set forth the complete mechanism by which interested persons may submit evidence and material to the Agency on the record with respect to the Agency's proposed standards.  The promulgated standards in turn are to be based solely on that record.  Cf., Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. Section 556(e).  With respect to discussions between the Administrator and Agency staff involved in the presentation of evidence at the hearing, the rule requiring separation of functions which applies in cases of adjudication, 5 U.S.C.

In accepting these procedures, the Court looked to the broad purposes of the food and drug laws and noted that these laws \" 'touch phases of the lives and health of the people which, in the circumstances of modern industrialism, are largely beyond self-protection.' \"  United States v.

The 1972 Act and the judicial decree combined the mandate for rapid administrative action with provision for a period of compliance.  The ultimate rationale for deadlines was, of course, to protect the public and the environment as soon as possible from the special dangers of toxic pollutants.  See Note 67 Infra.  Lead time for compliance after issuance of regulations was a realistic adjustment to the fact that controlling the discharge of dangerous substances from massive industrial complexes is not a matter always susceptible to the kind of simple action taken to guard against impure food or drugs.  The rationale for a period of compliance emphasizes the necessity for swift issuance of regulations.  In EPA's view, it was necessary to give industry one year after the issuance of regulations to comply.  Thus, it is all the more important that industry be directed to comply as early as possible, lest exposure last even longer.  Moreover, the decision that administrative action proceed swiftly was not EPA's; it was Congress's.  See generally Ewing v.

At the time the rules were adopted, EPA noted that the preparation of a tentative decision and a concomitant opportunity to file exceptions and supporting briefs were \"an important feature of the proceeding.\"  Accordingly, it retained its general requirement that a tentative decision could only be omitted where the Administrator determines that \"due and timely execution of his function imperatively and unavoidably so requires.\"  However, it declined to impose a thirty-day time period for exceptions following the issuance of the tentative decision, believing this was best left to the discretion of the presiding officer or the Administrator</p>\n        <p>Further, EPA declined to require the Administrator to publish the tentative decision in the Federal Register noting that \"the tight statutory timetable established in section 307(a)(2) simply does not allow sufficient time for such publication and the receipt of meaningful comments thereto, nor is it clear what if any further procedures should be conducted following receipt of such comments.\" 41 Fed.Reg. 17902.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn67\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn67_ref\">67</a>\n        <p> Section 101(a), 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1251(a) (1976), provides in part:</p>\n        <p>The objective of this chapter is to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters.

(Section 108, now codified at 42 U.S.C.A. &#167; 7408(a)(1)(A) (1977), was amended in 1977 to replace the \"adverse effect\" language with other language.  This amendment does not affect Hercules' argument that the Ethyl Construction would suit the term involved in this case.)  The analogy is unpersuasive.  Hercules does not show any parallel in the purpose or legislative history of the two provisions.  The provision in section 108 could appropriately call for an elaborate test, since it was a threshold for an entire statutory standard-setting procedure.  Ethyl Corp. v. EPA, 176 U.S.App.D.C. at 386, 541 F.2d at 14.

At present, there is only one domestic manufacturer of endrin, Velsicol Chemical Corp.  (Velsicol), which produces three to six million pounds a year. 42 Fed.Reg. 2595, 2600 (1977).  Its endrin manufacturing plant is located at Memphis, Tennessee, and its discharges eventually reach the Mississippi River and are carried through the lower Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence concerning the dangers of endrin to public health and the environment has been produced over the years since endrin was first introduced.  In 1965, results from a study using rats suggested that it was carcinogenic.  See 41 Fed.Reg. 31316 (1976).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> EPA has found that endrin has caused fifty-two reported fish and wildlife kills, largely the result of leakage or runoff during agricultural use.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Id. at 31317.  However, a massive fish kill in the lower Mississippi in 1963 was traced to discharges from Velsicol's Memphis plant. 42 Fed.Reg. 2591.  Endrin is suspected in particular of threatening the brown pelican, an endangered species sensitive to endrin. 42 Fed.Reg. 2591; 41 Fed.Reg. 31317.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regulatory authorities have taken a number of steps to control endrin.  The Food and Drug Administration has established a ceiling on endrin levels in food. 42 Fed.Reg. 2591.  Velsicol discharged, on the average, approximately seven pounds of endrin per day in the mid-1960's, Joint Appendix (App.)  I 182, but, under public and governmental pressure, it has taken steps to reduce this discharge.  In June 1974, EPA issued Velsicol a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit allowing an average daily discharge of no more than one pound of endrin.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Velsicol failed to reduce its endrin discharge below an average of 2.5 pounds per day in 1975, App.  I 184, and it was found in violation of its permit and was subject to civil penalties.  United States v. Velsicol Chemical Corp., 9 ERC (BNA) 1723 (W.D.Tenn.1976).  Under the regulations now under review, Velsicol is required to limit its discharge to approximately .005 pounds of endrin per day. 42 Fed.Reg. 2594 &amp; n.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Toxaphene is also a chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticide.  It has been used for several decades, and is currently used for pest control on cotton and livestock.  In the recent past, toxaphene was produced by four manufacturers.  See 41 Fed.Reg. 23590 (1976).  Hercules, Inc.  (Hercules) contends that it is now the only manufacturer that discharges any toxaphene into waterways, and thus, the only manufacturer affected by these regulations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> In 1975, total domestic production of toxaphene was approximately one hundred million pounds.  App. I 205-11.

Application of toxaphene to agricultural land surrounding several bird refuges resulted in massive bird kills in 1960-62.  App. I 157.  Toxaphene was identified as a cause of fish kills because of the characteristic \"broken back\" syndrome it produces in fish.  In 1969, strobane, a pesticide closely related to toxaphene, was identified as a carcinogen in mice.  App. I 148.  Toxaphene has been frequently found in clarified and treated municipal drinking water.

Brief for Petitioner Hercules at 4. Subsequently, Hercules received an NPDES permit from the State of Georgia limiting its allowable toxaphene discharge.  By 1975, Hercules reduced its average discharges of toxaphene to .27 pounds per day.  App. I 206.  Under the regulations now on review, Hercules is required to reduce its discharges to approximately .00375 pounds per day. 42 Fed.Reg. 2606 &amp; n.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>B.

EPA conducted its own experiments concerning the effects of endrin and toxaphene on a variety of species at its National Environmental Research Laboratory in Gulf Breeze, Florida.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Based on these experiments and on other studies, the Chief of the Criterion Branch of EPA's Office of Water Planning and Standards, Dr. Leonard J. Guarraia, prepared Criteria Documents summarizing the available information on endrin and toxaphene.  On June 10, 1976, EPA proposed standards for endrin and toxaphene. 41 Fed.Reg. 23576 (1976).  The standards were of two kinds: Concentration limitations on the concentration of pollutant allowed in the discharges, and Mass limitations on the amount of pollutant allowed in the discharges.

Almost one year after EPA published its final regulations, while this case awaited oral argument in this court, Congress amended the toxics provision of the 1972 Act in section 53 of the Clean Water Act of 1977 (1977 Amendments or the Amendments), 33 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1317 (1977).

EPA would also continue to issue health-based standards.  EPA's new program was sanctioned by the judicial decree in NRDC v.

H12929 (daily ed. Dec. 15, 1977) (staff report).  Moreover, its attitude was not that EPA had done too much and should start all over, but rather that EPA had done too little. \"Frankly, (Section 307(a)) has failed. . . . (O)nly six toxic chemicals aldrin/dieldrin, endrin, DDT, toxaphene, benzidene and PCB's Have been regulated.  Six chemicals in 5 years.\"  Id. at H12927 (remarks of Rep.  Roberts) (emphasis added).  Congress's strong support for continuing health-based regulation is shown not only by its impatience with EPA's pace, but also by the great emphasis placed in the 1977 Amendments on making it Easier for EPA to promulgate health-based regulations as a supplement to feasibility-based regulation.  See 123 Cong.Rec. S19649 (daily ed. Dec. 15, 1977) (remarks of Sen.  Muskie) (\"these amendments reduce the evidentiary burden of establishing a toxic effluent standard\"); S.Rep.No.370, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 54 (1977); U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1977, p. 4378 (lifting of formal rulemaking requirement for health-based regulation).  The provision relied on by Velsicol merely directs EPA to \"take into account\" its \"other regulatory authority\"; it created no new threshold barrier in health-based regulation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> Senator Muskie stated that the test for regulating a pollutant under health-based criteria instead of feasibility-based criteria is simply whether \"there is sufficient information on toxicity to establish a separate nationwide effluent standard for that pollutant.\" 123 Cong.Rec. S19649 (daily ed. Dec. 15, 1977).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> EPA's lengthy and detailed final decision on endrin, 42 Fed.Reg. 2590-601, both demonstrates and supports its view that there is sufficient information on endrin to establish such a standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Velsicol emphasizes that Congress listed endrin among the sixty-five families of toxic substances in the 1977 Amendments.  It maintains this must have been intended to require EPA to reconstruct its regulations under the feasibility-based provisions of the 1977 Amendments.  However, the list of substances in the 1977 Amendments was modeled, in large measure, on the judicial decree in NRDC v. Train.  See note 14 Supra.  That decree expressly directed EPA to proceed with health-based regulation of endrin at the same time as it proceeded with feasibility-based regulation of other substances. 8 ERC (BNA) at 2128-29.  The 1977 Amendments required, \"at a minimum,\" section 307(a)(2), that EPA publish effluent limitations based upon best-available technology for all pollutants on the list; the list was in no way intended to preclude health-based standards if they were warranted. 123 Cong.Rec. S19663 (daily ed. Dec. 15, 1977) (remarks of Sen.  Randolph).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we conclude that the 1977 Amendments were intended to aid, not to impede, EPA's health-based regulation.  In accordance with EPA's view that this intent would be frustrated if the regulations were nullified, we conclude that the applicable law in this proceeding is the 1972 Act and that no remand is necessary.III. SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES CONCERNING TOXAPHENE.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>A. Claims of the Parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In setting discharge standards, EPA's approach was to follow a procedure consisting in essence of determining, in the laboratory, which aquatic organisms were most vulnerable to toxaphene, measuring how much toxaphene they could take, and then, using these data, calculating a maximum tolerable discharge figure.  Hercules challenges EPA's laboratory-based approach, as well as particular details of EPA's methodology.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">EPA's approach may be viewed as consisting of six steps.  In the first, EPA selected a half-dozen species of aquatic organisms for testing that were either important commercially in and of themselves (oysters), or important indirectly as food for other organisms (pinfish).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, EPA conducted \"bioassays\" in the laboratory.  In these bioassays, EPA exposed the organisms to toxaphene for ninety-six hours.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> EPA derived, from the bioassay results, the concentration of toxaphene that kills one-half of a group of aquatic organisms.  The short-term lethal dose for the tested organisms ranged from 16 parts per billion for oysters to 0.5 parts per billion for pinfish.  These figures reflect the vulnerability of fish and other aquatic life to toxaphene.  Third, EPA estimated from the short-term lethal dose the maximum tolerable long-term concentration of toxaphene for the tested species.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> Fourth, EPA used the long-term tolerable concentration level to set an \"ambient water criterion.\"  The ambient water criterion is intended to be the maximum concentration of the toxic substance allowed in the nation's waterways a concentration low enough that even the most vulnerable important life in the water will be safe.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fifth, EPA translated the ambient water criterion into the effluent discharge standard, the standard controlling how much toxaphene a plant may discharge legally.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a> Finally, EPA set a \"mass limitation\" to supplement the effluent discharge limit.  Whereas the effluent discharge limit is expressed in terms of a concentration of toxaphene, the mass limitation restates it in terms of the total amount of toxaphene produced.  Such a supplemental figure compels a plant to meet the effluent discharge limit by removing toxaphene from its effluent.  In the absence of such a mass limitation, a plant could meet the discharge limit simply by watering down its effluent until the effluent was diluted enough to meet the concentration limit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hercules' challenge to EPA's laboratory-based approach relies on alternative data using field studies.  Starting in 1970, Dr. Robert Reimold, a Georgia biologist, conducted a field study of aquatic life in Terry Creek, the arm of Brunswick Estuary into which Hercules' plant discharges effluent.  For six years, Dr. Reimold compared the variety of free-swimming species found in Terry Creek with the variety found in Duplin Estuary, a comparable nearby body of water not contaminated by toxaphene.  Dr. Reimold believed that toxaphene was not harming the free-swimming aquatic life present in Terry Creek.  The level of toxaphene in Terry Creek's waters was between 1 and 2 parts per billion, which is between 200 and 400 times EPA's \"ambient water criterion\" of .005 parts per billion.  Accordingly, Hercules asserts that aquatic life can survive higher levels of toxaphene than EPA allows, and thus, that EPA's regulations are overly strict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hercules combines this frontal assault with several attacks on the specifics of EPA's methodology.  It contends that EPA's use of the pinfish as a test species was misconceived, since the pinfish is not an important species in Brunswick Estuary.  It also argues that EPA's toxicity tests were conducted improperly, that the tests failed to support the standard with substantial evidence, and that EPA should not have adopted a mass limitation precluding dilution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">EPA replies that its six-step approach was proper, since the toxics provision requires \"categorical\" standards for toxic pollutants, rather than standards based on local species and local receiving waters.  EPA further responds that it was not required to give great weight to Hercules' evidence, and that its own tests furnished an adequate basis for regulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>B. Statutory Issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court has discussed the standards of section 307(a), 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1317(a) (1976), in EDF v. EPA (PCBs), 194 U.S.App.D.C. at --- - ---, 598 F.2d at 79-81.  As explained there, section 307(a)(2) of the 1972 Act lists six factors for EPA to \"take into account\" in proposing a toxic effluent standard: \"the toxicity of the pollutant, its persistence, degradability, the usual or potential presence of the affected organisms in any waters, the importance of the affected organisms and the nature and extent of the effect of the toxic pollutant on such organisms.\"  EPA is to set discharge standards that provide an \"ample margin of safety.\"  Section 307(a)(4).  Under the \"ample margin of safety\" directive, EPA's standards must protect against incompletely understood dangers to public health and the environment, in addition to well-known risks.  See EDF v. EPA (PCBs), 194 U.S.App.D.C. at --- - ---, 598 F.2d at 80-81.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hercules' challenge to the regulations concentrates on the last three factors in section 307(a): \"the usual or potential presence of the affected organisms in any waters, the importance of the affected organisms and the nature and extent of the effect of the toxic pollutant on such organisms.\"  Hercules argues that these factors preclude EPA from basing its calculations upon experiments performed on the pinfish, and require it to focus exclusively on organisms actually found in the particular receiving waters into which Hercules discharges.  EPA's testing scheme, Hercules contends, is \"contrary to the statutory requirement that EPA design its standards to fit the characteristics of Specific water bodies in terms of 'the toxicity of the pollutant' In those waters and 'the importance of the affected organisms' In those waters.\"  Brief of Petitioner Hercules at 59 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with EPA's interpretation of the statute.

Instead, EPA tested six important marine species, and from the results of these tests, it inferred the likely sensitivity of other species.  Specifically, it chose the most sensitive species actually tested (pinfish), and used the test results from that species to set the ambient water criterion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The choice of the most sensitive species actually tested may be understood on at least two levels.  Legally, section 307(a)(4)'s fundamental instruction is that EPA's standards should provide an \"ample margin of safety.\"  Basing the scheme upon the most sensitive species actually tested provides a margin of safety for less sensitive species.  Scientifically, the scheme rests upon a statistical assumption:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p>Reliable toxicity data exist for a relatively small percent of all organisms in the aquatic environment for any given substance.  It seems a safe assumption to make, that as additional species are tested, some of them are going to be more resistant than those that have already been tested and some are going to be more sensitive. . . . If we consider the thousands of species of aquatic organisms which exist in our waterways and assume that only one hundred of these species are important enough to protect for the purpose of man's use; and if we further consider that perhaps only a half dozen species at most have been tested in most instances, it is highly probable that in any given water, species of greater sensitivity than those already tested, occur.  Therefore, it would appear that the Use of the most sensitive species tested, to establish acceptable levels, may not be overly conservative, since so few species have been tested and more sensitive important species surely exist.  Furthermore, should one of the food chain species be sensitive and essential, an entire food pyramid would be jeopardized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">App. I 255-56 (Affidavit of Dr. Donald I.

Indeed, it considered past fish kills, bird kills, human poisonings, and other incidents, 42 Fed.Reg. 2602-03, as well as Dr. Reimold's Brunswick Estuary studies, Id. at 2604-05.  However, EPA concluded that, in this particular case, the Brunswick Estuary study should not be accorded much weight both because of the inherent limitations of such a study and because of the particular limitations on Dr. Reimold's technique.

It argues that EPA failed to present evidence to rebut Dr. Reimold's study; that neither the Administrator, nor the judicial officer assigned to the proceeding, Ms. Harriet Marple, had sufficient scientific training to reject Dr. Reimold's approach; and, that the rejection of the field study was unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The scientific uncertainty attending the choice is demonstrated dramatically by the different alternatives advanced by Hercules and EPA, each propounded by different scientists.  The choice of a suitable technique for estimating toxicity risks is a decision \"on the frontiers of scientific knowledge.\"  The relative scientific and administrative advantages of different techniques are incapable of precise comparison by this court.  Decision between the alternatives is a quintessential policy judgment within the discretion of EPA.  We cannot accept Hercules' notion that the administrator of the agency created to protect the environment lacked even the Capability to exercise the discretion with which he was entrusted by Congress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hercules contends that EPA failed to \"rebut\" the Reimold study with testimony from experts in Dr. Reimold's field of expertise, ecological analyses.  The short answer is that EPA had expert evidence on which it could, and did, base its refusal to credit Dr. Reimold's study with more weight.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a> Moreover, we would not impose on EPA a wooden requirement that when, as in this case, there is conflicting testimony from experts in different fields (here, toxicology and ecology), EPA may only accept the evidence from one field if it rebuts, point-by-point, the evidence from the other field.  Certainly, EPA may compare evidence from different fields, and make a reasoned determination thereon.  The issue is not whether EPA has substantial evidence from every scientific field, but whether it has substantial evidence on the record as a whole.  Universal Camera Corp. v.

During public hearings on the 1972 Act, then-Administrator Ruckelshaus testified that \"we don't believe that the solution to pollution is dilution.\" 2 Legislative History at 1228.

Section 307(a)(2) requires EPA to \"take into account\" six factors in proposing toxics standards that comprehensively cover the fate of toxic substances in the environment, their effects on living organisms in general, and their effects on some organisms present and important in particular.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a> EDF v.

None of the six factors speaks explicitly to the technical means used to control the discharge of substances, nor is there present any term commonly used to denote a feasibility consideration, E. g., feasibility, achievability, practicability, economic impact, or cost.  Cf. section 304(b)(1) &amp; (2), 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1314(b)(1) &amp; (2) (1976) (speaking of practicability and achievability).  Section 307(a) itself provides for consideration of no other factors.  Cf. section 304(b)(1)(B) &amp; (2) (B) &amp; (4)(B), 33 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1314(b)(1)(B) &amp; (2)(B) &amp; (4)(B) (1977) (EPA may take into account \"such other factors as the Administrator deems appropriate.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An examination of other provisions of the 1972 Act reinforces this interpretation of section 307(a).  Section 307(a)(4) directs EPA to set standards providing \"an ample margin of safety,\" without any mention of feasibility criteria.  Further, we do not believe that section 307(a)(5) introduces feasibility criteria into the statutory scheme.  Section 307(a)(5) states that \"(w)hen proposing or promulgating any effluent standard (or prohibition) under this section, the Administrator shall designate the category or categories of sources to which the effluent standard (or prohibition) shall apply.\"  The legislative history makes clear that categories would be differentiated not by the feasibility Vel non of pollution control, but by the extent to which a toxic substance is present in the industrial process.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative background explains why Congress focused on public and environmental protection, rather than discharge control technology, in the setting of toxic standards.  The regulatory scheme is similar to that of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970, Pub.L.No. 91-604, 84 Stat. 1676, which distinguished between pollutants subject to technology-based regulation under section 111, and hazardous substances, subject to health-based regulation under section 112.  Recognizing that \"certain pollutants\" required special treatment because of risk to health, Congress enacted section 112, dealing with hazardous pollutants, without provision for considerations of feasibility. 1 Senate Comm. on Public Works, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., A Legislative History of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 (hereafter, Clean Air Legislative History) at 133 (Comm.Print 1974) (remarks of Sen.  Muskie) (The Senate subcommittee on Air and Water Pollution \"was presented with strong evidence that any level of emissions of certain pollutants may produce adverse health effects that cannot be tolerated.\"  Id. at 227.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1972 Act continued this distinction, adopting technology-based standards for pollutants in general and health-based standards for toxic pollutants.  Compare sections 301 &amp; 304(b), 33 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1311 &amp; 1314(b) (1976) With section 307(a).  \"The Committee considers that the discharge of toxic pollutants are much too dangerous to be permitted on merely economic grounds.\" 1 Legislative History at 800 (House Report).  In light of this clear statutory wording and legislative history, it is not surprising that numerous commentators agree that considerations of technological and economic feasibility do not play a part in standard-setting for toxic substances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fn40_ref\">40</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Velsicol argues that, if feasibility is not considered, the regulations will be promulgated at an irrationally strict level.  However, the congressional selection of factors is a legislative determination that the need of the public and the environment for protection from toxic chemicals is more important than the problems of stringent regulation.  This congressional determination is a rational response to the dangers presented by toxic substances.  The meaning of the statute being clear, it is not this court's prerogative to impose considerations of feasibility.  See Tennessee Valley Authority v.

However, our interpretation, which follows in large part EPA's original interpretation of section 307(a), will not necessarily lead to great difficulty in administering the section, because it does not preclude EPA from gathering information about feasibility.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn42-1\" id=\"fn42-1_ref\">42</a> Availability of information about feasibility may tend to induce industry and environmentalists to accept standards based on health criteria.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Velsicol points out that EPA did consider feasibility in the proceedings leading to the regulations in issue.  Indeed, Velsicol contends that EPA first set its endrin standard in accordance with feasibility criteria and then justified it with evidence related to the section 307(a)(2) factors.  This argument raises the possibility that we must remand the agency's standards on the grounds that EPA took an erroneous step in its deliberations.  See SEC v. Chenery Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104462\"><a href=\"/opinion/104462/sec-v-chenery-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">332</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span>, 196-97, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104462\"><a href=\"/opinion/104462/sec-v-chenery-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

However, upon careful examination of the manner in which EPA considered feasibility evidence, we conclude that a remand is unwarranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">EPA's consideration of feasibility is more understandable in light of the history of toxics proceedings.  In 1973 and 1974, EPA conducted proceedings for promulgating regulations under section 112 of the Clean Air Act and section 307(a).  In both the air and the water proceedings, EPA expressly excluded from consideration evidence concerning the economics of pollution control, although it had gathered such evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn43\" id=\"fn43_ref\">43</a> The 1973-74 toxics proceedings under section 307(a) ended in failure; EPA did not adopt toxic pollutant regulations.  See EDF v. EPA (PCBs), 194 U.S.App.D.C. at --- - ---, 598 F.2d at 68-69 (discussing this period in detail).  EPA's failure was partially due to its fear of \"almost certain challenge in court.\" 41 Fed.Reg. 23577 (1976).  Out of an abundance of caution, EPA altered its position after 1974 to allow limited consideration of feasibility.  In part, it did so on the basis of judicial authority, since overruled, that directed it to consider feasibility in the context of another health-based statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn44\" id=\"fn44_ref\">44</a> EPA's position served to build an administrative record that could support its regulations on appeal if feasibility were ultimately held to be a factor under section 307(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have concluded that section 307(a) does not include feasibility as a factor for consideration.  However, the fact that EPA considered evidence about feasibility does not require that the regulations be vacated.  It is apparent that EPA calculated its endrin standards using health-based, not feasibility-related, evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn45\" id=\"fn45_ref\">45</a> It conducted bioassays of aquatic species, determined the maximum long-term dose of endrin that the most sensitive tested species could tolerate, set an ambient water criterion, and calculated effluent standards and mass limitations.  Only then, upon calculating its standards, did it consider evidence about feasibility to provide an additional test. 42 Fed.Reg. 2597-600.  It found that the standards were, in fact, feasible.  Although consideration of feasibility is not contemplated by section 307(a), EPA's consideration of it did not affect its conclusions based on the factors specified by section 307(a), but constituted an attempt to confer additional legitimacy on its conclusions.  The supererogatory consideration did not prejudice Velsicol in any way.  Indeed, Velsicol actually gained an additional opportunity to press for relaxed standards by presenting evidence that the standards were not achievable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not find support in the record or in the administrative decision for Velsicol's contention that EPA proceeded \"backwards\" in setting the endrin standards.  Velsicol invites the court to probe the Administrator's mental processes in search of an alternative methodology for his decision other than the evidence and the reasons stated.

See App.  I 355-59.  In considering toxicity, it summarized studies showing that endrin was toxic to a broad range of invertebrates, fish, birds, and mammals.  App. I 94-107.  Evidence concerning the carcinogenicity of endrin in mice and rats had been produced, 41 Fed.Reg. 31316-17 (1976) (establishing \"rebuttable presumption\" against continued registration of endrin as a pesticide) and new evidence concerning this was presented in these proceedings, 42 Fed.Reg. 2591-93.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn46\" id=\"fn46_ref\">46</a> Endrin was demonstrated to be persistent and mobile in some circumstances, and while it was sometimes degraded or eliminated, it was bioaccumulated in many organisms.

Pink shrimp was the most sensitive species actually tested, with a short-term lethal dose of .037 parts per billion.  To estimate a long-term safe dose for shrimp, EPA multiplied the short-term lethal dose by an \"application factor\" of .1, a figure derived from endrin tests on an invertebrate, one type of stonefly that is found in mountain streams.  EPA then calculated the long-term safe dose for pink shrimp, and it set the ambient water criterion for endrin at .004 parts per billion.

It notes that pink shrimp are not exposed to Velsicol's endrin discharges until the endrin travels over 700 miles along the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico, and that stoneflies of this species are not exposed to Velsicol's discharges at all.  See Brief of Petitioner Velsicol at 12-16.  It argues that data were available for species that do live in the Mississippi, and that EPA should not have preferred the shrimp and stonefly data over data for species in the local receiving waters.  As we discussed in connection with EPA's tests on pinfish in setting toxaphene standards, Congress intended that EPA would use categorical determinations in setting standards for toxic pollutants, rather than limit its consideration to species present in receiving waters.  EPA's decision sets forth at length the reasons for selecting the shrimp and stonefly data as the basis for the standards. 42 Fed.Reg. 2593-94.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn47\" id=\"fn47_ref\">47</a> Choice among scientific test data is precisely the type of judgment that must be made by EPA, not this court. \"It is in just such matters that the findings of (EPA), because of its experience and the assistance of its technical staff, should be accorded the greatest weight and the courts should be most hesitant to substitute their judgment for that of (EPA).\"  FPC v.

Velsicol contends that the evidence supports a larger mixing zone factor, up to 4,000 in view of the volume and flow of the Mississippi River, and that EPA must also provide for \"loosening\" variances (large mixing zone factors for thoroughly-mixed waters).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We sustain EPA's decision with respect to the mixing zone factor.  The issue of mixing zones is a controversial one.  One leading commentator on section 307(a) argued that the 1972 Act \"probably does not allow mixing zones at all,\" since Congress banned pollution dilution as an alternative to waste treatment.  K. Hall, The Control of Toxic Pollutants Under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 63 Iowa L.Rev. 609, 628 &amp; n. 109 (1978).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn49\" id=\"fn49_ref\">49</a> On the other hand, Velsicol urges that EPA should take into account the full diluting capacity of the Mississippi, based on the volume, flow, geographical configuration, and other factors that go into calculations about particular receiving waters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">EPA's decision to use a moderate mixing zone factor and to make provision only for \"tightening,\" not loosening, variances must be deemed a rational, although simple, compromise.  By prescribing that EPA focus on categorical factors rather than on characteristics of local receiving waters, Congress sought to keep toxics regulation from becoming ensnarled in disputes over the characteristics of particular local waters, a complex matter Congress left to the setting of water quality standards under section 303, 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1313 (1976).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn50\" id=\"fn50_ref\">50</a> Section 307 regulation was to focus on toxicity and related characteristics of pollutants.

Petitioners maintain that section 554 applies to all proceedings \"on the record.\"  See Reply Brief for Petitioner Hercules at 12-13.

An \"order\" means \"the whole or a part of a final disposition . . . in a matter other than rule making.\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 551(6) (1976).  \"Rule making\" is defined as \"agency process for formulating, amending, or repealing a rule.\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 551(5) (1976).  The entire definitional scheme of the APA therefore turns on the meaning of \"rule.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The APA defines \"rule\" as \"the whole or a part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy . . .\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 551(4) (1976).  Under the APA definition in section 551(4), the toxic pollutant standards now before us are \"rules.\"  The standards are designed to \"implement\" and \"prescribe law\" pursuant to the authority of the 1972 Act.  See Willapoint Oysters, Inc. v. Ewing, 174 F.2d at 693.  Moreover, the standards had solely \"future effect\"; they did not apply in any way to discharges prior to their promulgation, and, indeed, compliance was not required until January 12, 1978, one full year after they were published in final form. 42 Fed.Reg. 2612; 40 C.F.R. &#167; 129.8(a) (1977).  Thus, in the APA definitional scheme, section 307(a) standards are \"rules,\" and not \"orders\"; the process is \"rule making,\" and not \"adjudication.\"  Accordingly, section 554 is not applicable.

That section 307(a) provides a \"hearing\" and findings \"on the record\" is not in any way inconsistent with the view that it calls for rulemaking.  Section 307(a)(2) begins by requiring EPA to propose a standard \"in accordance with section 553 of title 5,\" which explicitly contemplates \"Rules (that) are required by statute to be made On the record after opportunity for an agency Hearing.\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 553(c) (1976) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioners also contend that a \"functional\" analysis of these proceedings demonstrates that they involve adjudication.

The proposals relaxed in some measure the existing procedures for notices of hearing, prehearing conferences, taking of evidence, interlocutory review within the agency, and similar matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among the numerous proposals was a change in the use of staff assistance.  Proposed regulation 40 C.F.R. &#167; 104.14(a) stated that \"the Administrator, with such staff assistance as he deems necessary and appropriate, shall review the entire record and prepare and file a tentative decision based thereon.\"  This regulation was intended to replace 40 C.F.R. &#167; 104.16 (1975) known as the \"Ex parte contacts rule\" that had enjoined \"the Administrator or the presiding officer (from) consult(ing) with any person or party on a fact at issue.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn54\" id=\"fn54_ref\">54</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Twenty-eight persons (including Hercules) commented on the proposed rules. 41 Fed.Reg. 17899 (1976).  EPA adopted the proposed staff assistance rule, and in response to comments it had received, set out the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p>Several commenters opposed the proposed deletion of the prohibition on Ex parte discussions appearing in the original rules at Section 104.16.  The Agency proposed to delete this section for the reason that the prohibition on such Ex parte conversations, which is applicable to adjudication, is inapplicable to rulemaking.  The Agency cited considerable case law in support of this point.  Although several of the commenters cited decisions which they claim supported a contrary view, each of the cases cited involved adjudication rather than rulemaking, and are hence inapplicable.  The comments submitted by Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corporation cite K. Davis Administrative Law Treatise, Section 13.00 at 453 (1970 Supp.).  Davis is at the point discussing the separation of prosecutorial and decision-making functions within an administrative Agency, which is closely related to the Ex parte question since the issue with respect to Agency personnel is whether the staff who presents the evidence should be precluded from discussing the regulation with the Administrator out of the presence of the objector's representatives.  Although Professor Davis equivocates on what the policy should be, he leaves no doubt about the law: \"The conclusion seems to be rather solid that no law requires the Commissioner (of FDA) to separate functions in rulemaking for which on-the-record hearings are required\".  Id. p. 443.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p>The rationale for not imposing separation of functions, and the attendant prohibition on communication between those responsible for developing and presenting the proposed rule or standard and the person ultimately charged with promulgation, lies with the nature of rulemaking.  The development of a proposed rule or standard includes a number of policy decisions in which many program offices within the agency participate.  The Administrator relies on the advice and recommendations of these offices in developing and proposing the standards.  At the same time, persons within these offices may well present evidence at rulemaking hearings including information on which the proposed standard was based.  It would be counterproductive to reasoned rulemaking if, at the stage of final decision and promulgation, the administrator were isolated from those within the Agency whom he normally consults on policy determinations and whose offices will be charged with implementation and enforcement of the regulations.  The institutional nature of the Administrator's decision, as noted previously, is inherent in the very nature of rulemaking, and is normally absent from adjudication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p>Because the law clearly does not require the prohibition on Ex parte discussions contained in Section 104.16 as originally promulgated, and because nothing in the rulemaking process warrants its retention, it is deleted as proposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 17902.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">EPA conducted the proceeding now on review under the new procedural rules.  Its chief judicial officer, Ms. Harriet B. Marple, was assigned to aid the Administrator in preparing his final decision.  Ms. Marple was confronted with a loosely organized rulemaking record of enormous detail and staggering complexity thousands of pages of highly technical testimony, affidavits, and studies from a variety of sources to be considered against an uncertain scientific and legal background.  The record had been closed on October 12, 1976.  Under the judicial decree in NRDC v. Train, 8 ERC (BNA) at 2122, and under the deadline imposed by section 307(a)(2), the Administrator had two months or less to issue his final standards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an affidavit for the court, Ms. Marple stated that, when she was assigned to assist in this matter, she met with G. William Frick, then-General Counsel of EPA, and Ridgway M. Hall, then-Associate General Counsel, Water, to discuss whether, in the course of her efforts, consultation with EPA experts was permissible.  Mr. Frick advised her that the APA \"did not bar such Ex parte contacts within the Agency, in rulemaking proceedings,\" and that she was allowed to \"consult with Agency experts to assist in reviewing the record, whether or not the experts had participated as witnesses in the hearing.\"  Affidavit of Ms. Harriet B.

I explained to Dr. Fisher that I could not consider extra-record material, because my decision had to be confined to the record, but that I wanted his assistance in understanding the record.  During one of our discussions Dr. Fisher gave me a package of materials.  In the course of preparing this affidavit, I searched for the materials which Dr. Fisher had given me.  I found an unsigned document entitled \"Affidavit\", purporting to be the work of Joel L. Fisher.  I recall that Dr. Fisher handed me this document during one of our meetings, I am certain that I did not consider the materials Dr. Fisher gave me in the preparation of the Final Decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p>In the course of preparing this affidavit, I have reviewed a memorandum at the request of Agency Counsel, subject: \"Dr. Robert Reimold's Testimony on Toxaphene Before the Toxic Substances Hearings, P.L. 92-500, Section 307(a) on May 24, 1974,\" from Joel L.

The contacts here in no way involved a cabal-like arrangement within the agency.  To the contrary, the contacts were permissible under procedural rules adopted by EPA in 1976 after public comment and legal debate.  The validity of those rules was argued fully, and their justification was set out in detail.  In formulating the procedural rules, EPA relied upon the unquestioned authorities of that time both classic cases in this field and broader matter collected in Professor Davis's treatise.  The staff contacts under those rules were neither furtive, nor improvidently devised.  They were arranged after a conference between the agency's chief judicial officer and its chief legal officials, whose advice was based upon existing case law and agency rules.  While we must now decide whether that advice and those rules were sound in light of subsequent developments, our consideration of this issue does not impeach the good faith with which EPA proceeded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, an examination of the Marple affidavit demonstrates that the Administrator and the judicial officer did not consider or rely on any evidence presented outside the record.  The judicial officer stated that she prepared the final decision under the Administrator's supervision and direction; that she \"relied exclusively upon the record certified by the Administrative Law Judge\"; and that she \"did not rely on any extra-record material.\"  Marple affidavit at 1, 4. Two documents not in the record, one proffered and one possibly proffered to the judicial officer, were simply not considered.  Consultations with staff Counsel (as opposed to non-legal experts) occurred when the judicial officer needed assistance in locating documents and did not concern factual or policy issues.  Id. at 2. Consultation with staff experts was limited to reviewing the record.  We have examined the final decision, this affidavit, and the contentions of the petitioners, and we cannot question, on this basis, the judicial officer's unqualified and detailed averments.  Thus, this case is distinctly not one in which evidence outside the record was considered by the Administrator without being subject to challenge or rebuttal by the parties.

Consistent with our duties, we must not rule on such issues unless and until the concrete elements of the case so demand.  For two reasons, we have determined that EPA's standards must be upheld in this particular context; the broader questions posed by the parties are reserved for another day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p148\">\n      <span class=\"num\">148</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, both the adoption by EPA of its procedural rules and the issuance of the final decision preceded Home Box Office.  In Action for Children's Television, Inc. v. FCC, 183 U.S.App.D.C. at 453, 564 F.2d at 474, this court considered the strong reliance of administrative agencies and the public on established precedent and specifically \"h(e)ld only that Home Box Office's broad proscription is not to be applied retroactively in the case Sub judice inasmuch as it constitutes a clear departure from established law.\"  Because EPA relied expressly on established precedent in promulgating its hearing rules, the holding of Action for Children's Television applies with particular force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p149\">\n      <span class=\"num\">149</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the administrative history under section 307(a) created a peculiar context wherein the necessity for staff contacts existed with unusual and compelling force.  As we have noted, section 307(a) sets forth rigid and compressed timetables.  Previous EPA failures to meet these timetables resulted in a judicial decree fixing the time for rulemaking.  NRDC v. Train, 8 ERC (BNA) at 2128.  These congressional and judicial time restraints were imposed to minimize the period during which the public and the environment would be exposed to toxic substances.  The administrative delay would not only have been contrary to law, but would also have increased exposure to hazardous substances.  In view of the extraordinary bulk and complexity of the administrative record, a judicial officer attempting to digest the record and prepare a decision in a matter of weeks would face, at the least, great difficulty in proceeding without staff assistance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn63\" id=\"fn63_ref\">63</a> Thus, this context invokes the rule of ancient origin that expedition in protecting the public health justifies less elaborate procedure than may be required in other contexts.

The fact that the attorneys who represented the staff's position at the administrative hearing were later consulted by the judicial officer who prepared the final decision possibly gives rise to an appearance of unfairness, even though the consultations did not involve factual or policy issues.  During congressional deliberation on the APA, the flexibility of rulemaking procedures was of concern, as the bill's sponsor indicated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p152\">\n      <span class=\"num\">152</span>\n      <p>Mr. President, as I have pointed out before, this bill is designed to operate as a whole, and its provisions are closely interrelated.  At the same time, it should be pointed out that here are certain provisions which touch upon subjects long regarded as of the highest importance.  On some of these subjects, such as the separation of examiners from the agencies they serve, there has been a wide divergence of views.  The committee has, in such cases, taken the course which it believes will suffice, without being excessive.  Amendatory or supplementary legislation can supply any deficiency which experience discloses in such cases.

The committee believes it has followed sound discretion in selection of the language used, and it is the feeling of the committee that, where cases present sharply contested issues of fact, agencies should not as a matter of good practice take advantage of the exemptions (in 5 U.S.C. &#167; 554(d)(A)-(C)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p154\">\n      <span class=\"num\">154</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">92 Cong.Rec. 2159 (1946) (remarks of Sen.

As we have discussed, until 1976, EPA banned intra-agency contacts in hearings such as these.  EPA lifted this ban in 1976 in response to a peculiar situation of past failure and current necessity.  Now might be a particularly propitious time for Congress or the agencies to limit or provide disclosure of post-hearing contacts between staff advocates and decisionmakers.

In this connection, Hercules asserts, and EPA does not now contest, that 5 U.S.C. &#167; 557(b) (1976) is applicable.  Section 557(b) provides that if, as in this case, the Administrator did not preside at the reception of evidence, either the employee who did preside shall issue a recommended decision, or the Administrator may issue a tentative decision himself.  Section 557(b)(2) further provides that the Administrator may omit the tentative decision if he finds on the record that \"due and timely execution of (his) functions imperatively and unavoidably so requires.\"  EPA's procedural rules contain a very similar provision, but add that \"due and timely execution of his functions, include(s) compliance with time limitations established by law.\" 40 C.F.R. &#167; 104.14(c) (1977).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn66\" id=\"fn66_ref\">66</a> In his decision, the Administrator found explicitly that \"the preparation and filing of a tentative decision . . . should be omitted,\" because \"the filing of (the) decision had been delayed past the statutory deadline and past the deadline stipulated in the consent agreement in NRDC v. Train.\" 42 Fed.Reg. 2588.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have seen, section 307(a) was a dramatic congressional attempt to limit immediately and certainly the discharge of highly toxic substances into the nation's waterways.  In attempting to cope with what was perceived as a particularly acute problem, Congress mandated a strict timetable for EPA.  Thus, section 307(a) contained two directives to EPA that were difficult to reconcile.  On one hand, section 307 was \"saddled with extraordinary procedural preliminaries.\"  W. Rodgers, Environmental Law 481 (1977).  On the other hand, Congress legislated a precise timetable for the Administrator's promulgation of standards for toxics based on an unmistakable concern for the immediacy of implementation of the scheme.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn67\" id=\"fn67_ref\">67</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately, experience proved that EPA was unable to meet the congressionally imposed timetable.  See EDF v. EPA (PCBs), 189 U.S.App.D.C. at --- - ---, 598 F.2d at 68-69.  For purposes of this discussion, we need note only two aspects of EPA's experience.  First, by 1976, when EPA proposed the toxaphene standards now under review, it was already years behind schedule in every respect.  Second, suit had already been brought against the Administrator to compel immediate action under section 307(a).  The result of those suits was a judicially approved consent agreement under which</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p>The Administrator (was to) propose standards pursuant to Section 307(a) of the Act for aldrin/dieldrin, DDT (DDD, DDE), endrin, and toxaphene on or before May 31, 1976; and for benzidine on or before June 22, 1976; and for polychlorinatal biphenyls (PCB's) on or before July 14, 1976.  Not later than six months following proposal of each set of such standards, the Administrator (was to) promulgate final standards for each of such pollutants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p161\">\n      <span class=\"num\">161</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">NRDC v. Train, 8 ERC (BNA) at 2128-29.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn68\" id=\"fn68_ref\">68</a> Thus, with respect to toxaphene, EPA was required under the current decree to promulgate standards before the end of 1976.  EPA proposed new toxaphene standards on June 10, 1976, 41 Fed.Reg. 23576, held its formal rulemaking hearing from July 19 to October 12, and filed its final decision on January 3, 1977.  There was no tentative decision. 42 Fed.Reg. 2588.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p162\">\n      <span class=\"num\">162</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, the presence of the statutory deadline and the consent decree deadline amply justify the Administrator's actions.  The rulemaking in this case was characterized by voluminous submissions, a complex subject matter, and highly contested issues against the backdrop of judicial and statutory deadlines.  As a practical matter, to issue and receive meaningful comment on a tentative decision is a process that would necessarily require time.  EPA faced a choice among three basic possibilities: (1) to abridge the hearing process and the preparation of the final decision; (2) to miss the deadlines by a significant margin;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn69\" id=\"fn69_ref\">69</a> or (3) to omit the tentative decision.  Absent substantial prejudice to Hercules, the Administrator was entitled to make the third choice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn70\" id=\"fn70_ref\">70</a> Hercules alleges that it was prejudiced because it had no prior indication of EPA's position with respect to the Reimold study.  Even assuming Arguendo that EPA's position on that matter required a further round of argument by Hercules, Hercules could have sought reconsideration by EPA.

However, a special exception to this scheme is made in the area of toxic pollutant regulation. \"Compliance with a permit issued pursuant to this section shall be deemed compliance (with the statutory standards) . . . except any standard imposed under (section 307) for a toxic pollutant Injurious to human health.\"  Section 402(k) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1342(k) (1976) (emphasis added).  Thus, dischargers must meet newly established toxics standards even before their permits have been (or may be) revised to include them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn71\" id=\"fn71_ref\">71</a> EPA contends this provision applies to its toxaphene and endrin standards.  Hercules responds that toxaphene is not \"injurious to human health\" within the meaning of the statute, because the current level of toxaphene discharges is not creating a human health hazard.  Velsicol also argues that the one-year compliance period should be extended because section 53(b) of the Clean Water Act of 1977, 33 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1317(a)(6) (1977) allows EPA to set a longer time for compliance than the maximum specified in the 1972 Act (if it determines that compliance within that time is technologically infeasible for a category of sources).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p166\">\n      <span class=\"num\">166</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject petitioners' arguments and uphold EPA's requirement of swift compliance with the newly set toxics standards.  The 1972 Act is replete with declarations that swift compliance with toxics standards is the normal, not the exceptional, circumstance that petitioners would make it.  Section 307(a)(6) provides that \"(a)ny effluent standard (or prohibition) established pursuant to this section shall take effect on such date or dates as specified in the order promulgating such standard, but in no case, more than one year from the date of such promulgation.\"  As the legislative history of the 1972 Act explains:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p167\">\n      <span class=\"num\">167</span>\n      <p>Because of the hazards posed by toxic substances, the committee considers the need for compliance with promulgated standards for toxic substances to be especially urgent.  Language in section (307(a)(6)) is thus intended to convey that one year be an Absolute maximum time allowed for compliance with standards promulgated under this section, and that compliance be required As early as possible within this limit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p168\">\n      <span class=\"num\">168</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2 Legislative History at 1479 (Senate Report) (emphasis added).  This command is reinforced by the declaration of purpose in section 101(a)(3) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1251(a)(3) (1976), that \"it is the national policy that the discharge of toxic pollutants in toxic amounts be prohibited.\"  This policy, in contrast to others declared in section 101(a), was intended to be implemented rapidly.  See note 67 Supra.  Because of EPA's failure to carry out Congress's mandate for rapid action concerning toxics, See EDF v. EPA (PCBs), 189 U.S.App.D.C. at --- - ---, 598 F.2d at 68-69, it is easy to lose sight of Congress's original intention that toxics be dealt with quickly.  However, we will not interpret the 1972 Act as though delay in toxics control were an acceptable result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p169\">\n      <span class=\"num\">169</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hercules points out that the term \"injurious to human health\" must have been intended to distinguish some toxic substances that are \"injurious\" from others that are not.  It contends that since all toxic substances are likely to be \"injurious\" in some amount, for the term to make a meaningful distinction, it must require proof that the toxic substance creates a human health hazard in the amount now being discharged.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn72\" id=\"fn72_ref\">72</a> EPA concluded that a less restrictive view of the term would make it meaningful.  As EPA interpreted the statute, the test should be whether the toxic substance would injure humans in \"relatively small quantities.\" 42 Fed.Reg. 2601.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn73\" id=\"fn73_ref\">73</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p170\">\n      <span class=\"num\">170</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We adopt EPA's interpretation.  Nowhere in the Act's approach to toxics is there any requirement that EPA determine what quantities of a toxic substance are now being discharged.  Hercules' view would require EPA to investigate and determine local discharge conditions, while EPA's view allows a categorical approach to toxicity measurements similar to that used in section 307(a).  See Text accompanying notes 23-27 Supra.  Velsicol's argument based on the Clean Water Act of 1977 is similarly unpersuasive.  The fact that the Clean Water Act of 1977 gave EPA discretionary authority to allow a longer compliance time does not necessarily imply or suggest that the pre-existing maximum one-year period was always to be considered excessively stringent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p171\">\n      <span class=\"num\">171</span>\n      <p>VII.

In this case, EPA considered it reasonable to expect that such post-discharge mixing would attenuate toxaphene effluent by a factor of 300.  Therefore, EPA set an average daily effluent discharge limit of 1.5 parts per billion, since that would produce, after attenuation through mixing by a factor of 300, an ambient water level of .005 parts per billion.

We welcome measures that may help to avoid the necessity of judicial review, and thus may further the administration of this statute.  It may well be that in toxics proceedings, industry will find little to gain in refusing to acquiesce in standards when information shows that they are achievable, and environmentalists, not desiring to erode public support for toxics regulation, will find little to gain in refusing to acquiesce in standards when information shows that stricter standards would not be readily achievable.

While the alternative of designating a responsible employee of the Agency to prepare a recommended decision is deleted, the new provision expressly recognizes the fact that in reviewing the entire record and preparing a tentative decision within the extremely tight time constraints of Section 307(a), the Administrator will have to utilize staff assistance.  This is routine practice in most federal administrative agencies, and is essential given the workloads and responsibilities of the officials at the top of such agencies. . . .</p>\n        <p>Finally, the former provision in &#167; 104.16 with respect to ex parte discussions has been deleted as unnecessary.  The statutory language together with the framework provided by these rules set forth the complete mechanism by which interested persons may submit evidence and material to the Agency on the record with respect to the Agency's proposed standards.  The promulgated standards in turn are to be based solely on that record.  Cf., Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. Section 556(e).  With respect to discussions between the Administrator and Agency staff involved in the presentation of evidence at the hearing, the rule requiring separation of functions which applies in cases of adjudication, 5 U.S.C.

The 1972 Act and the judicial decree combined the mandate for rapid administrative action with provision for a period of compliance.  The ultimate rationale for deadlines was, of course, to protect the public and the environment as soon as possible from the special dangers of toxic pollutants.  See Note 67 Infra.  Lead time for compliance after issuance of regulations was a realistic adjustment to the fact that controlling the discharge of dangerous substances from massive industrial complexes is not a matter always susceptible to the kind of simple action taken to guard against impure food or drugs.  The rationale for a period of compliance emphasizes the necessity for swift issuance of regulations.  In EPA's view, it was necessary to give industry one year after the issuance of regulations to comply.  Thus, it is all the more important that industry be directed to comply as early as possible, lest exposure last even longer.  Moreover, the decision that administrative action proceed swiftly was not EPA's; it was Congress's.  See generally Ewing v.

This amendment does not affect Hercules' argument that the Ethyl Construction would suit the term involved in this case.)  The analogy is unpersuasive.  Hercules does not show any parallel in the purpose or legislative history of the two provisions.  The provision in section 108 could appropriately call for an elaborate test, since it was a threshold for an entire statutory standard-setting procedure.  Ethyl Corp. v.
