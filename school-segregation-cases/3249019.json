The petitioner filed an objection. For reasons set forth below, this court grants the motion.</p>\n<p>The petitioner, Dimas Rodriguez, filed this action alleging that while he was incarcerated, he was unlawfully disciplined as a result of a false claim made by a Department of Corrections employee. This discipline resulted in 15 days punitive segregation; 90 days loss of phone privileges and 60 days loss of visitation rights. The petitioner filed a complaint with the Connecticut Correctional Ombudsman, which was found meritorious in a July 15, 2000 Formal Recommendation. Despite the finding of the Ombudsman that the petitioner was unjustly disciplined, based on false, and purportedly retaliatory claims made by an employee of the Department of Corrections, the discipline was never rescinded. The petitioner filed the instant matter to remedy this situation. The defendant files a motion to dismiss, arguing that the complaint fails to state a legally cognizable claim.</p>\n<p>The issue presented is whether a claim of erroneous punishment of a prisoner that did not include any loss of good time credits earned will support a habeas corpus petition.

In order to invoke the trial court's subject matter jurisdiction in a habeas action, a petitioner must allege that he is illegally confined or has been deprived of his liberty.
