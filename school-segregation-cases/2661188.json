Motherway, Assistant Attorney\n                                                     General, for George Jepsen, Attorney\n                                                     General of Connecticut, Hartford, CT.\n\n       Appeal from an order of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut\n(Shea, J.).\n\n       UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND\n\nDECREED that the order of the district court is AFFIRMED in part and that the appeal is\n\nDISMISSED in part.\n\n       Plaintiff-Appellee Jimmy Gardner brought a civil rights action against\n\nDefendants-Appellants, officials and employees of the Connecticut Department of Corrections,\n\nalleging that they created and executed a policy of requiring inmates with disciplinary problems to\n\nbe handcuffed behind their backs during their out-of-cell recreation periods. The defendants\n\nappeal from the district court’s order (Shea, J.), which denied their motion for summary judgment\n\non qualified immunity grounds. We assume the parties’ familiarity with the underlying facts, the\n\nprocedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.\n\n       We review de novo the denial of qualified immunity on a motion for summary judgment.\n\nSee Coollick v. Hughes, 699 F.3d 211, 219 (2d Cir. 2012). Summary judgment is appropriate\n\nwhere “there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as\n\na matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Although we generally lack jurisdiction to consider the\n\ndenial of summary judgment, we may do so when the district court has rejected a qualified\n\nimmunity defense. See Walczyk v. Rio, 496 F.3d 139, 153 (2d Cir. 2007). Our jurisdiction is\n\nlimited, however, “to circumstances where the qualified immunity defense may be established as a\n\nmatter of law.” Escalera v. Lunn, 361 F.3d 737, 743 (2d Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fomitted). When the district court has identified a disputed issue of fact, a defendant denied\n\nqualified immunity may obtain interlocutory review only by asserting an entitlement to the defense\n\neven accepting as true the plaintiff’s version of the facts. See Savino v. City of New York, 331 F.3d\n\n63, 72 (2d Cir. 2003). Accordingly, we analyze the facts in the light most favorable to Gardner,\n\nfocusing our de novo review on “the legal question of whether the disputed facts identified by the\n\n[d]istrict [c]ourt are, in fact, material” to the defendants’ entitlement to qualified immunity. Id.\n\n       Qualified immunity shields public officials “from liability for civil damages insofar as\n\ntheir conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a\n\nreasonable person would have known.” Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). The defendants bear the burden of establishing their entitlement to\n\nqualified immunity. See Vincent v. Yelich, 718 F.3d 157, 166 (2d Cir. 2013). “The issues on\n\nqualified immunity are: (1) whether plaintiff has shown facts making out violation of a\n\nconstitutional right; (2) if so, whether that right was clearly established; and (3) even if the right\n\nwas clearly established, whether it was objectively reasonable for the [officials] to believe the\n\nconduct at issue was lawful.” Gonzalez v. City of Schenectady, 728 F.3d 149, 154 (2d Cir. 2013)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       “A right is ‘clearly established’ if ‘the contours of the right are sufficiently clear that a\n\nreasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.’” LaBounty v.\n\nCoughlin, 137 F.3d 68, 73 (2d Cir. 1998) (alterations omitted) (quoting Anderson v. Creighton,\n\n483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987)). To determine whether a right is clearly established, we consider\n\n“whether the right in question was defined with reasonable specificity,” “whether the decisional\n\nlaw of the Supreme Court and the applicable circuit court support the existence of the right in\n\n\n\n                                                   3\n\fquestion,” and “whether under preexisting law a reasonable defendant official would have\n\nunderstood that his or her acts were unlawful.” Dean v. Blumenthal, 577 F.3d 60, 68 (2d Cir. 2009)\n\n(per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       To prevail on a conditions-of-confinement claim, an inmate must show that he suffered a\n\nsufficiently serious deprivation and that prison officials acted with deliberate indifference. See\n\nFarmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834 (1994). A prisoner suffers a sufficiently serious deprivation\n\nwhen prison officials fail to furnish him with “life’s necessities.” Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S.\n\n337, 347 (1981). Accordingly, we have recognized that “the Eighth Amendment requires that\n\nprison inmates be allowed some out-of-cell exercise.” Williams v. Greifinger, 97 F.3d 699, 704 n.5\n\n(2d Cir. 1996). That right is limited, however, where there is a valid safety exception or certain\n\nunusual circumstances. See id. at 704. Additionally, when a restriction on exercise is imposed,\n\nprison officials must perform “a detailed review” of feasible alternatives. Id. at 705 (internal\n\nquotation marks and alterations omitted). Taken together, our earlier decisions have clearly\n\nestablished the right for inmates to have some meaningful opportunity for exercise unless the\n\nprison has a legitimate safety justification and has adequately considered feasible alternatives. The\n\ndistrict court in this case defined the clearly established right similarly and therefore correctly\n\nstated “the level of generality at which the relevant ‘legal rule’ is to be identified.” Anderson, 483\n\nU.S. at 639.\n\n       Even though inmates have a clearly established right to some meaningful opportunity to\n\nexercise subject to a safety exception and adequate consideration of alternatives, the question\n\nremains whether “‘reasonable persons in [the defendants’] position would not have understood\n\nthat their conduct was within the scope of the established prohibition.’” LaBounty, 137 F.3d at 73\n\n\n\n                                                   4\n\f(quoting In re State Police Litig., 88 F.3d 111, 123 (2d Cir. 1996)). To be entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity on this basis, a defendant must demonstrate that “no rational jury could fail to conclude”\n\nthat it was reasonable for him to believe that his conduct did not violate the prisoner’s\n\nconstitutional right. Id. at 74 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n        Here, the defendants argue that all reasonable jurors would agree that the prison officials\n\nacted reasonably in permitting Gardner to exercise only while handcuffed behind his back. We\n\ndisagree. Of particular relevance on this interlocutory appeal are the district court’s conclusions\n\nthat questions of fact remained as to whether the plaintiff had some meaningful opportunity to\n\nengage in exercise and whether the defendants had an adequate safety justification for their\n\nimposing restraints on Gardner’s exercise. Because we lack jurisdiction to resolve the adequacy of\n\nthe plaintiff’s opportunity for exercise or the defendants’ safety justification, see Savino, 331 F.3d\n\nat 72, the question we must confront on this appeal narrows considerably: We must decide solely\n\nwhether reasonable jurors could disagree about whether it would have been objectively reasonable\n\nfor the defendants to believe that they would not violate Gardner’s clearly established\n\nconstitutional rights by requiring him to be handcuffed behind his back during exercise, absent an\n\nadequate safety justification for the restraints.\n\n        The defendants argue that reasonable officials could debate the legality of the conduct now\n\nat issue because neither the Supreme Court nor this Court “has held that requiring an inmate to\n\nrecreate in restraints for security reasons is unconstitutional.” Alston v. Murphy, No.\n\n3:12-cv-00811, 2014 WL 1379894, at *6 (D. Conn. Apr. 8, 2014) (emphasis added). We are\n\nunpersuaded for several reasons. First, the defendants’ argument assumes that there is in fact a\n\nvalid safety rationale, which we must assume is not true for purposes of this appeal. Second, the\n\n\n\n                                                    5\n\fdefendants’ position defines the scope of the right too narrowly. We have recognized that a\n\nrestriction on the meaningful opportunity to exercise must be based on a valid security exception.\n\nSee Williams, 97 F.3d at 704. Here, it is undisputed that while in Phase I of the Administrative\n\nSegregation Program, Gardner was permitted to attend outdoor recreation only while handcuffed\n\nbehind his back. Such a restriction may be found to infringe an inmate’s right to a meaningful\n\nopportunity to exercise, and, if so, must be justified by a valid security concern. Accordingly, if it\n\nfinds unpersuasive a proffered safety justification, a reasonable jury could readily conclude that a\n\ncorrections official acted unreasonably by permitting an inmate to exercise only in restraints. After\n\nall, we do not see how a prison policy that required every inmate to remain in restraints during\n\nout-of-cell exercise could comport with the clearly established scope of the Eighth Amendment as\n\nto a particular inmate, unless there were a persuasive safety justification for that inmate’s\n\nrestraints. Third, as we have noted previously, “the absence of legal precedent addressing an\n\nidentical factual scenario does not necessarily yield a conclusion that the law is not clearly\n\nestablished.” Johnson v. Newburgh Enlarged Sch. Dist., 239 F.3d 246, 251 (2d Cir. 2001); see also\n\nHope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 741 (2002) (“[O]fficials can still be on notice that their conduct\n\nviolates established law even in novel factual circumstances.”). Accordingly, we hold that under\n\nexisting clearly established case law, a reasonable jury may conclude that reasonable officers\n\nwould agree that handcuffing inmates behind their backs during their out-of-cell exercise without\n\nan adequate safety justification is unconstitutional. We therefore cannot conclude on this\n\ninterlocutory appeal that the district court erred in denying summary judgment to the defendants.\n\n       In resolving this appeal, we do not reach several questions as a result of the limits on our\n\njurisdiction. First, we lack jurisdiction to review whether there is in fact a “genuine” factual\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n\fdispute regarding the extent of Gardner’s deprivation of exercise or the adequacy of the\n\ndefendants’ proffered safety justification or of their consideration of feasible alternatives. See\n\nTerebesi v. Torreso, 764 F.3d 217, 229 (2d Cir. 2014) (“[W]hile we have jurisdiction to determine\n\nwhether the issue is material to the legal issues properly before us, we may not review whether it is\n\ngenuine.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Second, because we must “disregard any disputed\n\nfacts or facts that contradict [Gardner’s] version of events,” id., we do not resolve the factual\n\ndisputes necessary to decide the merits of Gardner’s underlying constitutional claim. As a result,\n\nwe do not consider whether the defendants would be entitled to qualified immunity if there were in\n\nfact an adequate safety justification for imposing the exercise-restraint policy on Gardner. We\n\nsimilarly lack jurisdiction to determine Gardner’s entitlement to equitable relief, which does not\n\ndepend on the defendants’ entitlement to qualified immunity. See Ford v. Reynolds, 316 F.3d 351,\n\n356 & n.3 (2d Cir. 2003).\n\n       We have examined the defendants’ remaining arguments and find that they lack merit to\n\nthe extent that we have jurisdiction to consider them. Accordingly, we AFFIRM in part the district\n\ncourt’s order and DISMISS the remainder of this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n\n                                               FOR THE COURT:\n                                               Catherine O’Hagan Wolfe, Clerk\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\f",

That right is limited, however, where there is a valid safety exception or certain\n\nunusual circumstances. See id. at 704. Additionally, when a restriction on exercise is imposed,\n\nprison officials must perform “a detailed review” of feasible alternatives. Id. at 705 (internal\n\nquotation marks and alterations omitted). Taken together, our earlier decisions have clearly\n\nestablished the right for inmates to have some meaningful opportunity for exercise unless the\n\nprison has a legitimate safety justification and has adequately considered feasible alternatives. The\n\ndistrict court in this case defined the clearly established right similarly and therefore correctly\n\nstated “the level of generality at which the relevant ‘legal rule’ is to be identified.” Anderson, 483\n\nU.S. at 639.\n\n       Even though inmates have a clearly established right to some meaningful opportunity to\n\nexercise subject to a safety exception and adequate consideration of alternatives, the question\n\nremains whether “‘reasonable persons in [the defendants’] position would not have understood\n\nthat their conduct was within the scope of the established prohibition.’” LaBounty, 137 F.3d at 73\n\n\n\n                                                   4\n\f(quoting In re State Police Litig., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"721310\"><a href=\"/opinion/721310/in-re-state-police-litigation-connecticut-criminal-defense-lawyers/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 123 (2d Cir. 1996)). To be entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity on this basis, a defendant must demonstrate that “no rational jury could fail to conclude”\n\nthat it was reasonable for him to believe that his conduct did not violate the prisoner’s\n\nconstitutional right. Id. at 74 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n        Here, the defendants argue that all reasonable jurors would agree that the prison officials\n\nacted reasonably in permitting Gardner to exercise only while handcuffed behind his back. We\n\ndisagree. Of particular relevance on this interlocutory appeal are the district court’s conclusions\n\nthat questions of fact remained as to whether the plaintiff had some meaningful opportunity to\n\nengage in exercise and whether the defendants had an adequate safety justification for their\n\nimposing restraints on Gardner’s exercise. Because we lack jurisdiction to resolve the adequacy of\n\nthe plaintiff’s opportunity for exercise or the defendants’ safety justification, see Savino, 331 F.3d\n\nat 72, the question we must confront on this appeal narrows considerably: We must decide solely\n\nwhether reasonable jurors could disagree about whether it would have been objectively reasonable\n\nfor the defendants to believe that they would not violate Gardner’s clearly established\n\nconstitutional rights by requiring him to be handcuffed behind his back during exercise, absent an\n\nadequate safety justification for the restraints.\n\n        The defendants argue that reasonable officials could debate the legality of the conduct now\n\nat issue because neither the Supreme Court nor this Court “has held that requiring an inmate to\n\nrecreate in restraints for security reasons is unconstitutional.” Alston v. Murphy, No.\n\n3:12-cv-00811, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1379894</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *6 (D. Conn. Apr. 8, 2014) (emphasis added). We are\n\nunpersuaded for several reasons. First, the defendants’ argument assumes that there is in fact a\n\nvalid safety rationale, which we must assume is not true for purposes of this appeal. Second, the\n\n\n\n                                                    5\n\fdefendants’ position defines the scope of the right too narrowly. We have recognized that a\n\nrestriction on the meaningful opportunity to exercise must be based on a valid security exception.\n\nSee Williams, 97 F.3d at 704. Here, it is undisputed that while in Phase I of the Administrative\n\nSegregation Program, Gardner was permitted to attend outdoor recreation only while handcuffed\n\nbehind his back. Such a restriction may be found to infringe an inmate’s right to a meaningful\n\nopportunity to exercise, and, if so, must be justified by a valid security concern. Accordingly, if it\n\nfinds unpersuasive a proffered safety justification, a reasonable jury could readily conclude that a\n\ncorrections official acted unreasonably by permitting an inmate to exercise only in restraints. After\n\nall, we do not see how a prison policy that required every inmate to remain in restraints during\n\nout-of-cell exercise could comport with the clearly established scope of the Eighth Amendment as\n\nto a particular inmate, unless there were a persuasive safety justification for that inmate’s\n\nrestraints. Third, as we have noted previously, “the absence of legal precedent addressing an\n\nidentical factual scenario does not necessarily yield a conclusion that the law is not clearly\n\nestablished.” Johnson v. Newburgh Enlarged Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771972\"><a href=\"/opinion/771972/timothy-johnson-sr-and-luaine-sims-on-behalf-of-their-minor-son-tj-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">246</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 251 (2d Cir. 2001); see also\n\nHope v. Pelzer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121169\"><a href=\"/opinion/121169/hope-v-pelzer/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">730</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 741 (2002) (“[O]fficials can still be on notice that their conduct\n\nviolates established law even in novel factual circumstances.”). Accordingly, we hold that under\n\nexisting clearly established case law, a reasonable jury may conclude that reasonable officers\n\nwould agree that handcuffing inmates behind their backs during their out-of-cell exercise without\n\nan adequate safety justification is unconstitutional. We therefore cannot conclude on this\n\ninterlocutory appeal that the district court erred in denying summary judgment to the defendants.\n\n       In resolving this appeal, we do not reach several questions as a result of the limits on our\n\njurisdiction. First, we lack jurisdiction to review whether there is in fact a “genuine” factual\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n\fdispute regarding the extent of Gardner’s deprivation of exercise or the adequacy of the\n\ndefendants’ proffered safety justification or of their consideration of feasible alternatives. See\n\nTerebesi v. Torreso, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">764</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">217</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 229 (2d Cir. 2014) (“[W]hile we have jurisdiction to determine\n\nwhether the issue is material to the legal issues properly before us, we may not review whether it is\n\ngenuine.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Second, because we must “disregard any disputed\n\nfacts or facts that contradict [Gardner’s] version of events,” id., we do not resolve the factual\n\ndisputes necessary to decide the merits of Gardner’s underlying constitutional claim. As a result,\n\nwe do not consider whether the defendants would be entitled to qualified immunity if there were in\n\nfact an adequate safety justification for imposing the exercise-restraint policy on Gardner. We\n\nsimilarly lack jurisdiction to determine Gardner’s entitlement to equitable relief, which does not\n\ndepend on the defendants’ entitlement to qualified immunity. See Ford v. Reynolds, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780506\"><a href=\"/opinion/780506/erica-ford-miriam-plata-quentin-walcott-jose-rivas-cinque-viola-plummer/\"><span class=\"volume\">316</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n356 & n.3 (2d Cir. 2003).\n\n       We have examined the defendants’ remaining arguments and find that they lack merit to\n\nthe extent that we have jurisdiction to consider them. Accordingly, we AFFIRM in part the district\n\ncourt’s order and DISMISS the remainder of this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n\n                                               FOR THE COURT:\n                                               Catherine O’Hagan Wolfe, Clerk\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\f</pre>",
