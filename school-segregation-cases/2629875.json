No. CVUJ111460)\n         Defendants and Respondents.\n\n\n         Plaintiff Aron D. Castlin, a prisoner in the Secured Housing Unit (SHU) at Pelican\nBay State Prison (Pelican Bay), appeals an order sustaining defendants’ demurrer without\nleave to amend his civil complaint. The complaint sought the return of or compensation\nfor property seized from his cell. The demurrer asserted that the complaint should be\ndismissed on numerous grounds, including that: 1) the claim for negligent supervision\ncould not be asserted against defendants as they are public employees; 2) the claim for\n“right to own legal material/property” was not a cognizable cause of action; 3) plaintiff\nfailed to state a claim for access to the courts; and 4) the complaint otherwise failed for\nuncertainty. We affirm in part and reverse in part.\n                                                 I. BACKGROUND\n         Because we are reviewing an order sustaining a demurrer, we are required to\naccept as true the allegations of facts set forth in plaintiff’s complaint. (City of Dinuba v.\nCounty of Tulare (2007) 41 Cal.4th 859, 865.) Therefore, the facts set forth in this\nopinion are taken from the allegations in plaintiff’s complaint.\n\n\n\n\n                                                             1\n\f       Plaintiff is a “respected author, anti-imperialist,” and self-described, “ ‘jailhouse\nlawyer.’ ” In December 2007, shortly after his writings “advocating for the release of\npolitical prisoners and abolition of prisons began being widely published in anti-\nimperialist” magazines, plaintiff was moved from the regular SHU to the\n“Communication Management Unit,” also known as the “short corridor.”\n       In December 2008, plaintiff filed a writ of habeas corpus, challenging his no\ncontest criminal conviction as being “in violation of constitutional law as plaintiff was\nnever informed of the direct consequences of having to register as a ‘gang offender’ ”\npursuant to Penal Code section 186.30. The petition was denied on or about September\n2009, at which time plaintiff “received representation by human rights attorney\nMr. Yavar Hameed of . . . Ontario Canada.” Hameed agreed to “represent plaintiff’s\ninterest via investigations and research on his pending habeas corpus, as well as . . . in\ndrafting a class action petition to the United Nations detailing and seeking redress of the\ninhumane and unconstitutional conditions of plaintiff’s confinement.”\n       In November 2009, plaintiff’s book, “ ‘Who Am Eye: A Spoken Word Memoir’ ”\nwas published. Plaintiff’s poetry was featured both nationally and internationally on\nradio and in print. At or about this same time, defendant J. Silveria, a correctional officer\nassigned to the institution gang investigation unit (IGI), began denying plaintiff\ncorrespondence with attorney Hameed.\n       On January 15, 2010, defendant Silveria, along with defendants D. Milligan, G.\nPimentel, and A. Rosenberg, all of whom were correctional officers acting under the\nsupervision of defendants Lieutenant F. Vanderhooven1 and Lieutenant W. Anthony, who\nwere both assigned to the investigative services unit (ISU), confronted plaintiff in his cell\nand told him to “ ‘cuff up’ ” for a cell search. When plaintiff asked about the purpose of\nthe search, defendants would not respond except to say “ ‘investigation into gang\nactivity,’ ” or “ ‘cuff up, or we’ll remove you.’ ” Defendants refused to allow plaintiff to\n\n1\n        Although the complaint names “F. Vanderhoofven” as a defendant, the record\nreflects that the correct spelling of this defendant’s last name is “Vanderhooven.”\nAccordingly, we shall refer to this defendant as “Vanderhooven.”\n\n                                              2\n\fobserve the search. Instead, he was handcuffed and placed in a locked shower stall,\nwhere he had no view of the search of his cell. Defendants seized and removed all\nplaintiff’s “personal property and legal paperwork,” leaving him only with his television\nand some laundry.\n       Upon being escorted back to his cell, plaintiff discovered a “vague uninformative\ndocument,” entitled “ ‘Pelican Bay State Prison, Security Housing Unit Cell Search\nReceipt,’ ” which stated that “ ‘all paperwork removed for review’ ” by internal affairs.\nPlaintiff complained about the lack of information and itemization on the receipt, but\ndefendants refused to give him an itemized account of the property taken.\n       On January 20, 2010, plaintiff went to the prison law library. Upon returning to\nhis housing unit around 1:30 p.m., he was notified by the control booth officer that his\nproperty had been returned to the unit. However, because plaintiff was not in the unit, his\nproperty was left unattended in the trash/storage room. Plaintiff asked defendant M.\nBrown, a floor officer who had just begun her shift, whether she had seen his property in\nthe trash/storage room. Defendant Brown told plaintiff that his property was in that room\nin large garbage bags and that she would “issue it to him” when she had the time.\nPlaintiff’s conversation with defendant Brown took place some time between 1:30 and\n1:45 p.m.\n       Plaintiff’s property was not returned to him until about 6:30 p.m. on January 20,\n2010, after the evening meal was served, trays were collected, and the garbage was\nthrown out. Plaintiff’s property, which had been put in large plastic garbage bags, was\nleft unattended for five hours in the garbage/storage room. Upon an initial inspection of\nhis property, plaintiff noticed that defendants Silveria, Milligan, Pimentel, and\nRosenberg, again had failed to itemize the property that had been confiscated and/or\nreturned. Plaintiff discovered that all of his legal paperwork was missing.\n       Plaintiff immediately notified defendant Brown that all of his legal paperwork was\nmissing and that the cell search receipt was missing as well. Defendant Brown told\nplaintiff to address his concerns to defendant Silveria, as he was the one who had left the\nproperty in the storage room.\n\n\n                                             3\n\f       On January 30, 2010, plaintiff filed an inmate appeal requesting the return of all of\nhis “legal property.” Plaintiff received an informal response on or about February 3,\n2010, from Lieutenant Vanderhooven, who stated: “ ‘Your property was searched and\nreturned to you, including your legal work. No property was retained and no disciplinary\nreport issued.’ ”\n       On February 8, 2010, plaintiff requested a formal level review of the informal\nclaim, asserting that the informal review did not address the issues raised, but only served\nto continue the “pattern of constitutional violations.” Thereafter, Lieutenant Anthony\ninterviewed plaintiff and told him that he would locate and return plaintiff’s legal\nproperty.\n       On or about April 2, 2010, plaintiff received an “unsatisfactory” Warden level’s\nresponse from Lieutenant Anthony, which had been authorized by defendants Captain\nK.L. McGuyer, Associate Warden M.J. Nimrod, and Warden D.G. Adams. Although the\nresponse purported to partially grant plaintiff’s appeal, plaintiff’s complaint was “only\nhalf-heartedly investigated or not investigated at all.”\n       On April 18, 2010, plaintiff sought Director’s level review of his grievance,\nrequesting the return of his legal property and claiming that the staff at Pelican Bay were\n“continuing to violate [his] constitutional rights and have denied [him] access to the\ncourts in [his] pending legal matter.” Thereafter, on or about July 28, 2010, defendants\nD. Stark, an appeals examiner at the Inmate Appeals Branch (IAB), and D. Foston, chief\nexaminer at IAB, issued a response in which they “did no investigation into the issues,”\nbut “merely reiterated the statements made at the previous levels of review.”\n                                         I. DISCUSSION\nA.     Standard of Review\n       “ ‘On appeal from a dismissal after an order sustaining a demurrer, we review the\norder de novo, exercising our independent judgment about whether the complaint states a\ncause of action as a matter of law.’ (Lazar v. Hertz Corp. (1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 1494,\n1501.) ‘ “We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded . . .\n[Citation.] We also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.” [Citation.] . . . .’\n\n\n                                              4\n\f(Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)” (Doe v. Albany Unified School Dist.\n(2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 668, 674.) When the demurrer is sustained without leave to\namend, we review the denial for leave to amend for abuse of discretion. (Campbell v.\nRegents of University of California (2005) 35 Cal.4th 311, 320.)\n       Under the governing legal principles, “we take as true the well-pleaded factual\nallegations of the complaint.” (Construction Protective Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty\nIns. Co.(2002) 29 Cal.4th 189, 193.) We construe the “complaint liberally to attain\nsubstantial justice among the parties.” (Long Beach Equities, Inc. v. County of Ventura\n(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1016, 1024.) Nevertheless, we “may not consider conclusions of\nfact or law, opinions, speculation or allegations which are contrary either to law or to\njudicially noticed facts.” (Ibid.)\nB.     Writ Relief Regarding Return of Property (First and Second Causes of Action)\n       Plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer without leave\nto amend by failing to recognize that his causes of action for bailment and conversion\nsought writ relief. It appears, as defendants concede, that plaintiff was seeking writ relief\nwith respect to his bailment and conversion claims. For example, the civil complaint\ncover sheet states, “Plaintiff seeks specific recovery of Bailed property and order\ncompelling defendants to perform a ministerial duty owed Plaintiff.” The face of the\nattached complaint is also entitled “Complaint Seeking Specific Performance of a\nMinisterial Duty to Return Property Arising From Bailment.”\n       On appeal, plaintiff contends that the trial court should not have dismissed on the\ngrounds that he failed to comply with the Government Tort Claims act because inmates\nare not required to file a government tort claim when seeking a writ of mandate for return\nof property. We, however, review a trial court’s decision, not its reasoning. (Ladas v.\nCalifornia State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 769.) Accordingly, we must\naffirm the trial court’s ruling if any legal theory would sustain the judgment, provided it\ndoes not raise factual issues not presented below. (City of Claremont v. Kruse (2009) 177\nCal.App.4th 1153, 1167.)\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f       Here, “it does not really matter if plaintiff [] expressly sought a writ of mandate\nbelow [and/or the trial court failed to consider it]. ‘[W]e are not limited to plaintiff[’s]\ntheory of recovery in testing the sufficiency of [his] complaint against a demurrer, but\ninstead must determine if the factual allegations of the complaint are adequate to state a\ncause of action under any legal theory. The courts of this state have . . . long since\ndeparted from holding a plaintiff strictly to the ‘form of action’ he has pleaded and\ninstead have adopted the more flexible approach of examining the facts alleged to\ndetermine if a demurrer should be sustained.’ (Barquis v. Merchants Collection Assn.\n(1972) 7 Cal.3d 94, 103.) ‘As against a general demurrer, . . . it is unimportant that\nplaintiff’s pleading was not in form a petition for mandamus . . . . All that is required is\nthat plaintiff state facts entitling him to some type of relief, and if a cause of action for\nmandamus . . . has been stated, the general demurrer should have been overruled.’\n(Boren v. State Personnel Board (1951) 37 Cal.2d 634, 638.)” (Doe v. Albany Unified\nSchool Dist., supra, 190 Cal.App.4th at pp. 682-683.) Accordingly, we turn to the\nquestion of whether the complaint states a claim for traditional mandamus.\n       Preliminarily, we agree with plaintiff that if the conditions for relief are otherwise\nadequately shown, writ of mandate is an appropriate remedy in this case. As noted in\nEscamilla v. Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 498\n(Escamilla), a petition for writ of mandate is an appropriate vehicle to compel the return\nof personal property wrongfully withheld by state custodial officers in violation of a\nstatutory duty. (Id. at pp. 509-511, fn. 10.) Additionally, as background to our\nconsideration of the issues in this case, we recognize the principle embodied in Penal\nCode section 2600 that “[a] person sentenced to imprisonment in a state prison . . . may\nduring that period of confinement be deprived of such rights, and only such rights, as is\nreasonably related to legitimate penological interests.”2\n\n\n2\n  Penal Code section 2601 elaborates that “[s]ubject only to the provisions of that section,\neach person described in Section 2600,” shall have certain retained rights, including the\nright to private property. (Pen.Code, § 2601, subd. (a).)\n\n\n                                               6\n\f        Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, subdivision (a), “[a] writ of\nmandate may be issued by any court to any inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or\nperson, to compel the performance of an act which the law specially enjoins, as a duty\nresulting from an office, trust, or station . . . .” The substantive requirements for issuance\nof the writ are (1) a clear, present and usually ministerial duty of the defendant to do an\nact which the law specially enjoins, and (2) a substantial beneficial interest of the plaintiff\nin the performance of that duty. (City of Dinuba v. County of Tulare (2007) 41 Cal.4th\n859, 868.) “A ministerial act is one that a public functionary ‘ “ ‘is required to perform in\na prescribed manner in obedience to the mandate of legal authority,’ ” ’ without regard to\nhis or her own judgment or opinion concerning the propriety of such act.” (Coachella\nValley Unified School Dist. v. State of California (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 93, 113.)\nAdditionally, “[m]andamus is an appropriate remedy to compel the exercise of discretion\nby a government officer, but does not lie to control the exercise of discretion unless under\nthe facts, discretion can be exercised in only one way. [Citations.]” (Pacific Bell v.\nCalifornia State & Consumer Services Agency (1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 107, 118.)\n        We now turn to the particular issue of whether defendants had a duty to return\nplaintiff’s property. On this question, plaintiff argues that Escamilla, supra, 141\nCal.App.4th 498 is controlling. In Escamilla, after a prison riot, an inmate was placed in\nthe SHU. (Id. at p. 502.) The inmate had placed his personal clothing, watch, and items\nhe had just purchased from the canteen into bags to be kept until he was released from the\nSHU. (Ibid.) When he was released from the SHU, his items were not returned to him.\n(Ibid.) After the inmate’s appeals seeking $255 compensation for the lost items were\ndenied, he filed a writ of habeas corpus, which the trial court granted. (Id. at pp. 504-\n505.)\n        On appeal, the court determined the appropriate writ to address the situation was a\nwrit of mandate, rather than habeas corpus. (Escamilla, supra, 141 Cal.App.4th at\npp. 505-508.) It concluded a claim for return of specific property held by a public entity\nas bailee did not require presentation of a government claim prior to seeking judicial\nrelief by way of mandate, because it was not a claim for money or damages to which the\n\n\n                                              7\n\fclaim filing requirement applied. (Id. at p. 506.) In so holding, the court quoted Minsky\nv. City of Los Angeles (1974) 11 Cal.3d 113, 121, which stated: “ ‘[T]he government in\neffect occupies the position of a bailee when it seizes from an arrestee property that is not\nshown to be contraband. [Citation.] The arrestee retains his right to eventual specific\nrecovery, whether he seeks to regain tangible property like an automobile, ring, wallet or\ncamera, or whether he seeks to recover a specific sum of money which, under general\nconstructive trust principles, is traceable to property within the possession of the\ndefendant. [Citations.]’ [Citation.]” (Escamilla, supra, 141 Cal.App.4th at p. 506, italics\nadded.)\n       Defendants, on the other hand, argue that Flores v. Department of Corrections and\nRehabilitation (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 199, 208 (Flores), is dispositive of the issues on\nappeal. In Flores, the court held that prison officials did not abuse their discretion in\nrefusing to return a contraband television to an inmate.    In so holding, it distinguished\nEscamilla, explaining that in Escamilla “the property . . . was not [confiscated] as\ncontraband; it was merely . . . held for safekeeping.” (Flores, supra, 224 Cal.App.4th at\np. 208.) In Flores, in contrast, “plaintiff’s property was not simply taken from him for\nsafekeeping when he was arrested or placed in segregated housing; it was seized as\ncontraband. Thus, in taking possession of plaintiff’s property, defendants were not acting\nas bailees charged with an obligation to safely keep and return the television.” (Ibid.) In\nreaching this conclusion, the court noted that the plaintiff had not alleged any “facts\nshowing that the television was not contraband, for example, that it was properly\nengraved with plaintiff’s name . . . or that he had proof sufficient to establish his\nownership, such as a receipt for its purchase bearing a serial number matching the serial\nnumber on the television.” (Ibid.)\n       Contrary to the respective positions of the parties, the facts of the instant case do\nnot squarely align with either Escamillia or Flores. For example, unlike in Escamilla, the\nproperty at issue was not simply taken from plaintiff for safekeeping. Rather, the\ncomplaint states that it was “seized” as part of an “ ‘investigation into gang activity.’ ”\nHowever, here, unlike in Flores, plaintiff alleged facts showing that the property seized\n\n\n                                              8\n\fwas not actually contraband. The fact that defendants attempted to return the seized\nproperty to plaintiff and that they did not take any disciplinary measures against plaintiff\nbased on the seized property suggests a reasonable inference that the property confiscated\nwas later shown not to be contraband. This inference militates toward finding the instant\ncase more closely aligned with Flores.\n       Here, it appears that the confiscation of plaintiff’s property began as an authorized\nseizure of suspected contraband. However, once defendants determined that the seized\nproperty was not contraband they effectively became bailees of plaintiff’s property and,\nas such, they had a duty to safely keep and return plaintiff’s personal property.\n(Escamilla, supra, 141 Cal.App.4th at p. 510, fn. 10.) Plaintiff contends that the\ndefendants either negligently and/or intentionally lost or destroyed his legal property.\nConsequently, plaintiff has demonstrated that his claims for bailment (first cause of\naction) and conversion (second cause of action) are proper ones to pursue by petition for\nwrit of mandate.\nC.     Remaining Causes of Action\n       1.     Right to Own Legal Property (Third Cause of Action)\n       In his third cause of action, plaintiff purports to assert a claim of interference with\nhis “right to own legal property.” In support of this claim, plaintiff relies on various parts\nof the California Code of Regulations (see Cal.Code.Regs., tit. 15, §§ 3161, 3190, 3191,\n3193) as well as the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United\nStates Constitution.\n       Plaintiff characterizes his claim as one for the deprivation of his personal property\nwithout due process; that is that he has been wrongly denied ownership and possession of\nlegal materials necessary for his pending criminal appeal. Interests protected by the due\nprocess may arise from two sources—the Due Process Clause itself and laws of the\nstates. (Meachum v. Fano (1976) 427 U.S. 215, 223-227.) The United States\nConstitution does not create a protected interest in property. (Board of Regents of State\nColleges v. Roth (1972) 408 U.S. 564, 577.) Rather, protected property interests “stem\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\ffrom an independent source such as state law—rules or understanding that secure certain\nbenefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.” (Ibid.)\n       Because there is no fundamental right to own personal property in prison, a due\nprocess right to such ownership would be created only by virtue of state statute or\nregulation. State law creates a protected interest if mandatory language in the law\nsubstantively restricts the discretion of state officials. (Hewitt v. Helms (1983) 459 U.S.\n460, 472 overruled in part on other grounds in Sandin v. Conner (1995) 515 U.S. 472,\n482-484.) The state regulations at issue do not contain such mandatory directives,\nhowever. For example, California Code of Regulations, title 15, section 3161 provides:\n“Inmate-owned legal materials/documents, law books and papers shall be limited to the\navailability of space authorized by section 3190(b) for personal property in the inmate’s\nquarters/living area except as specified in this section. Inmates may possess up to one\ncubic foot of legal materials/documents related to their active cases, in excess of the six\ncubic feet of allowable property in their assigned quarters/living area. Legal\nmaterials/documents, law books and papers in excess of this limitation shall be disposed\nof pursuant to section 3191(c). Inmates may request the institution/facility store excess\nlegal materials/documents related to their active cases(s) when such materials/documents\nexceed this one cubic foot additional allowance. Inmate-owned law books in excess of\nthe additional allowance shall not be stored by the institution/facility.”\n       Equally inapt are the provisions addressing the general policies of the California\nDepartment of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) regarding personal property\npossessed by inmates. (See Cal.Code Regs., tit. 15, § 3190 [General Policy (specifying\n“state-issued property items, and authorized personal/religious property items”)]; § 3191\n[Property Registration and Disposition (specifying procedure for “[r]egisterable personal\nproperty”)]; § 3193 [Liablity (specifying instances when department will be liable for\nloss or destruction of inmate personal property)].)\n       The language of these regulations does not create a legitimate claim of entitlement\nfor the “right to own legal property.” Therefore, a demurrer did lie as to plaintiff’s right\nto own property claim. We will therefore affirm the decision to sustain the demurrer.\n\n\n                                              10\n\f          Next, we must determine if plaintiff must be granted leave to amend this claim. If\n“an amendment could cure the defect,” then leave to amend must be granted. (Schifando\nv. City of Los Angeles (2003) 31 Cal.4th 1074, 1081, italics added.) That is, “unless the\ncomplaint shows on its face that it is incapable of amendment,” leave to amend must be\ngranted. (Lee v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (2003) 107\nCal.App.4th 848, 854, italics omitted; accord Berkeley Police Assn. v. City of Berkeley\n(1977) 76 Cal.App.3d 931, 942.) Here, the defect is that plaintiff did not cite to any\napplicable law supporting his claim of entitlement of the right to own property. Although\nthe specific regulations cited by plaintiff do not give rise to a cause of action, pursuant to\nPenal Code section 2601, subdivision (a), prisoners do retain the general right to own\npersonal property while in prison. Accordingly, as the complaint is clearly capable of\namendment by adding a claim under Penal Code section 2601, we direct the court to\ngrant plaintiff leave to amend the complaint as to his right to own property cause of\naction.\n          2.     Right of Access to the Court (Fourth Cause of Action)\n          Plaintiff claims that staff failed to return his confiscated legal materials, which had\nthe effect of violating his rights of access to the courts.\n          Prisoners have a constitutional right to access the courts. (Lewis v. Casey (1996)\n518 U.S. 343, 346.) There are at least two categories of suits prisoners bring to enforce\nthis right. (See Christopher v. Harbury (2002) 536 U.S. 403, 412-414.) “In the first are\nclaims that systemic official action frustrates a plaintiff or plaintiff class in preparing and\nfiling suits at the present time.” (Id. at p. 413.) “The second category covers claims not\nin aid of a class of suits yet to be litigated, but of specific cases that cannot now be tried\n. . . no matter what official action may be in the future.” (Id. at pp. 413-414, fn. omitted.)\nIn either type of suit, the prisoner must plead facts demonstrating that the underlying\naction frustrated by prison officials was “ ‘nonfrivolous’ ” or “ ‘arguable.’ ” (Id. at\np. 415.) Moreover, when asserting claims in the second category, the complaint must\nidentify “a remedy that may be awarded as recompense . . . .” (Ibid.)\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\f       Here, plaintiff alleges that prison officials confiscated his property, including\n“legal property.” According to the complaint, Lieutenant Anthony said he would return\nthe legal materials, but failed to do so. The unreturned documents allegedly included “all\nof [plaintiff’s] . . . legal paperwork.” Plaintiff alleged that he had “a pending legal\ndeadline and needed his legal work.” Because this is an appeal from a demurrer, we treat\nthese allegations as true. (Thrifty Payless, Inc. v. Americana at Brand, LLC (2013) 218\nCal.App.4th 1230, 1234, fn. 1.) And, if true, the allegations could form the core of a\nviable denial of access claim. (Lewis v. Casey, supra, 518 U.S. at p. 350 [Supreme Court\nhas protected right to access courts “by prohibiting state prison officials from actively\ninterfering with inmates’ attempts to prepare legal documents”] , citing Johnson v. Avery\n(1969) 393 U.S. 483, 489-490.)\n       Notably, the Supreme Court has imposed specific pleading requirements for denial\nof access claims. (See Christopher v. Harbury, supra, 536 U.S. at p. 415.) Here,\nplaintiff failed to satisfy those requirements by 1) not describing the underlying actions\nthat were adversely affected and 2) not proposing a remedy for the alleged violation.\n(See ibid.) Therefore, a demurrer did lie as to plaintiff’s denial of access claim. We will\ntherefore affirm the decision to sustain the demurrer.\n       Next, we must determine if plaintiff must be granted leave to amend this claim.\nHere, the defect is that plaintiff did not allege sufficient facts regarding the substance of\nthe underlying action, the specifics of how the action was adversely affected by\ndefendants’ alleged conduct, or proposed remedies. Since the complaint does not show\non its face that it is incapable of such an amendment, we direct the court to grant plaintiff\nleave to amend the complaint as to the claim he was unconstitutionally denied access to\nthe courts.\n       3.     Negligent Supervision (Fifth Cause of Action)\n       The court sustained the general demurrer to the fifth cause of action on the basis\nthat defendants Anthony, Cate, McGuyer, Milligan, Nimrod, Pimentel, Silveria, and\nVanderhooven could not be liable for negligent supervision because they are public\nemployees.\n\n\n                                              12\n\f       “[A] public employee is not liable for an injury caused by the act or omission of\nanother person.” (Gov.Code, § 820.8.) This immunity bar, however, does not apply\nwhen the public employee has some personal culpability for the injury. “Nothing in this\nsection exonerates a public employee from liability for injury proximately caused by his\nown negligent or wrongful act or omission.” (Ibid.; cf. Weaver v. State of California\n(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 188, 202-203 [no personal involvement shown and no negligent\nsupervision or negligent training alleged].)\n       Preliminarily, we note that defendants Silveria and Pimentel were not named in\nthe fifth cause of action. Rather, this cause of action was limited to the alleged acts of\ndefendants Cate, Adams, Nimrod, Vanderhooven, Anthony, McGuyer, Stark, and Foston\nwith respect to “their failure to properly, independently investigate” plaintiff’s claim, and\nthat each of these defendants “having knowledge of plaintiff’s pending case, and missing\nproperty continued to ignore their duty to return plaintiff his legal property or have him\nfill out the requisite property disposition form.”\n       In this situation, there were ample facts alleged to support a negligence cause of\naction against Cate, Adams, Nimrod, Vanderhooven, Anthony, and McGuyer3 based on\nnegligent supervision and training which would take these defendants outside the\nimmunity bar of section 820.8 of the Government Code. M. Cate was alleged to be the\nDirector of the CDCR and who “exercises final an overall responsibility for the policies,\npractices, training and actions” of all CDCR employees; D.G. Adams was alleged to be\nthe “designated Warden” at Pelican Bay and who was “responsible for . . . the training\nand supervising [ ] of all employees” at Pelican Bay; M.J. Nimrod was alleged to be the\n“designated Associate Warden” at Pelican Bay, who was in the position of “training and\nsupervising all employees” at Pelican Bay; F. Vanderhooven was alleged to be a\n“correctional Lieutenant,” and who “issued the warrant/order” to the IGI officers “who\nseized plaintiff’s property and was/is responsible to oversee training and conduct” of IGI\n\n3\n      To the extent the fifth cause of action alleges conduct on part of defendants Stark\nand Foston, we express no opinion inasmuch as these defendants were not part of the\ndemurrer below and are not parties to the instant appeal.\n\n                                               13\n\fofficers; it was further alleged that Vanderhooven “personally searched plaintiff’s\nproperty after it [had been] seized” and he responded to plaintiff’s informal grievance and\nwas therefore “responsible [] for . . . insuring the investigation . . . and the return of\n[plaintiff’s] bailed property”; W. Anthony was alleged to be a “correctional Lieutenant”\nassigned to the ISU and that he “issued the warrant/order” to “the IGI officers who seized\nplaintiff’s property and was/is responsible to oversee training and conduct” of IGI\nofficers; it was further alleged that Anthony “personally searched plaintiff’s property\nafter it [had been] seized” and he responded to plaintiff’s grievance at the “Warden’s\nlevel of review,” and therefore “responsible [] for . . . insuring the investigation . . . and\nthe return of [plaintiff’s] bailed property”; K.L. McGuyer was alleged to be a\n“correctional Captain” assigned to the ISU and the “immediate supervisor” of all ISU and\nIGI “staff named herein and is responsible to overseeing training and conduct of those\nstaff”; it was further alleged that McGuyer approved the order assigning the IGI officers\nwho seized plaintiff’s property and he was responsible for overseeing plaintiff’s\ncomplaint at the “Warden’s level.”\n       Construed liberally, plaintiff’s allegations state a claim for negligence with respect\nto Director Cate, Warden Adams, Associate Warden Nimrod, Lieutenant Vanderhooven,\nLieutenant Anthony, and Captain McGuyer based on their personal involvement and/or\nnegligent supervision in the handling of plaintiff’s property.\nD.     Uncertainty\n       Ordinarily, our inquiry into an order sustaining a general demurrer “ends and\nreversal is required once we determine a complaint has stated a cause of action under any\nlegal theory.” (Genesis Environmental Services v. San Joaquin Valley Unified Air\nPollution Control Dist. (2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 597, 603.) Under this rule, our analysis\ncould have been limited to the bailment and conversion claims. We, however, chose to\naddress plaintiff’s right to own property, access-to-court, and negligent supervision\ncauses of action because those claims presented legal questions that, if resolved in this\nappeal, could promote the efficiency of subsequent proceedings. As a result, our\n\n\n\n                                               14\n\fdirections to the trial court are more detailed than a simple direction to enter an order\noverruling the general demurrer. (See id. at p. 608.)\n       From our reading of the complaint it is not clear whether plaintiff intends to\npursue any California tort law claim concerning damage to personal property (i.e.,\nnonconstitutional claims). Under California statute, a demurrer may be sustained on the\nground that the “pleading is uncertain.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (f).) Based on\nthis statute, we direct the trial court to sustain the demurrer as to potential California tort\nlaw claims for damage to personal property. (1 Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil\nProcedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2014) ¶ 6:104, p. 6–28.)\n       The court shall allow plaintiff an opportunity to resolve this uncertainty by\namending his pleading and clarifying whether he intends to pursue any state tort law\nclaims (see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.112(2) [each separately stated cause of action or\ncount must specifically state its nature (e.g., “ ‘for fraud’ ”).]\n       Additionally, plaintiff has brought five causes of action against 13 defendants.\nEach of the causes of action appear to be lodged against all of the defendants. However,\ncertain causes of action refer to individual defendants by name, while others merely\nreference the defendants as a group. In this regard, the complaint is uncertain as it fails to\nspecify the basis for liability for each defendant. Thus, sustaining the demurrer for\nuncertainty was not improper. However, denying leave to amend was an abuse of\ndiscretion. The court shall allow plaintiff an opportunity to resolve this uncertainty by\namending his pleading and clarifying the basis of liability for each defendant.\n\n\n\n\n                                               15\n\fE.    Costs\n      An order awarding fees and costs “ ‘falls with a reversal of the judgment on which\nit is based.’ [Citation.]” (Merced County Taxpayers’ Assn. v. Cardella (1990) 218\nCal.App.3d 396, 402; Ryan v. California Interscholastic Federation-San Diego Section\n(2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 1048, 1082.) Inasmuch as the judgment must be partially\nreversed, the award of costs must be reversed as well.\n\n                                     III. DISPOSITION\n      The judgment is reversed with respect to the first, second, and fifth causes of\naction. As to the third and fourth causes of action, the judgment is reversed only insofar\nas it denies leave to amend plaintiff’s right to own property and denial-access-to-the-\ncourts claims. The superior court is directed to enter an order 1) overruling the demurrer\nas to the first, second, and fifth causes of action; 2) sustaining the demurrer to plaintiff’s\nthird cause of action with leave to amend; 3) sustaining the demurrer to plaintiff’s fourth\ncause of action with leave to amend; 4) sustaining the demurrer on grounds of\nuncertainty and with leave to amend as to any California tort law claims for damage to\npersonal property and to specify the basis of liability for each defendant.\n      The parties to bear their own costs on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\f                                 _________________________\n                                 REARDON, J.\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n_________________________\nRUVOLO, P.

Castlin, a prisoner in the Secured Housing Unit (SHU) at Pelican\nBay State Prison (Pelican Bay), appeals an order sustaining defendants’ demurrer without\nleave to amend his civil complaint. The complaint sought the return of or compensation\nfor property seized from his cell. The demurrer asserted that the complaint should be\ndismissed on numerous grounds, including that: 1) the claim for negligent supervision\ncould not be asserted against defendants as they are public employees; 2) the claim for\n“right to own legal material/property” was not a cognizable cause of action; 3) plaintiff\nfailed to state a claim for access to the courts; and 4) the complaint otherwise failed for\nuncertainty. We affirm in part and reverse in part.\n                                                 I. BACKGROUND\n         Because we are reviewing an order sustaining a demurrer, we are required to\naccept as true the allegations of facts set forth in plaintiff’s complaint. (City of Dinuba v.\nCounty of Tulare (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2599701\"><a href=\"/opinion/2599701/city-of-dinuba-v-county-of-tulare/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">859</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 865.) Therefore, the facts set forth in this\nopinion are taken from the allegations in plaintiff’s complaint.\n\n\n\n\n                                                             1\n\f       Plaintiff is a “respected author, anti-imperialist,” and self-described, “ ‘jailhouse\nlawyer.’ ” In December 2007, shortly after his writings “advocating for the release of\npolitical prisoners and abolition of prisons began being widely published in anti-\nimperialist” magazines, plaintiff was moved from the regular SHU to the\n“Communication Management Unit,” also known as the “short corridor.”\n       In December 2008, plaintiff filed a writ of habeas corpus, challenging his no\ncontest criminal conviction as being “in violation of constitutional law as plaintiff was\nnever informed of the direct consequences of having to register as a ‘gang offender’ ”\npursuant to Penal Code section 186.30. The petition was denied on or about September\n2009, at which time plaintiff “received representation by human rights attorney\nMr. Yavar Hameed of . . . Ontario Canada.” Hameed agreed to “represent plaintiff’s\ninterest via investigations and research on his pending habeas corpus, as well as . . . in\ndrafting a class action petition to the United Nations detailing and seeking redress of the\ninhumane and unconstitutional conditions of plaintiff’s confinement.”\n       In November 2009, plaintiff’s book, “ ‘Who Am Eye: A Spoken Word Memoir’ ”\nwas published. Plaintiff’s poetry was featured both nationally and internationally on\nradio and in print. At or about this same time, defendant J. Silveria, a correctional officer\nassigned to the institution gang investigation unit (IGI), began denying plaintiff\ncorrespondence with attorney Hameed.\n       On January 15, 2010, defendant Silveria, along with defendants D. Milligan, G.\nPimentel, and A. Rosenberg, all of whom were correctional officers acting under the\nsupervision of defendants Lieutenant F. Vanderhooven1 and Lieutenant W. Anthony, who\nwere both assigned to the investigative services unit (ISU), confronted plaintiff in his cell\nand told him to “ ‘cuff up’ ” for a cell search. When plaintiff asked about the purpose of\nthe search, defendants would not respond except to say “ ‘investigation into gang\nactivity,’ ” or “ ‘cuff up, or we’ll remove you.’ ” Defendants refused to allow plaintiff to\n\n1\n        Although the complaint names “F. Vanderhoofven” as a defendant, the record\nreflects that the correct spelling of this defendant’s last name is “Vanderhooven.”\nAccordingly, we shall refer to this defendant as “Vanderhooven.”\n\n                                              2\n\fobserve the search. Instead, he was handcuffed and placed in a locked shower stall,\nwhere he had no view of the search of his cell. Defendants seized and removed all\nplaintiff’s “personal property and legal paperwork,” leaving him only with his television\nand some laundry.\n       Upon being escorted back to his cell, plaintiff discovered a “vague uninformative\ndocument,” entitled “ ‘Pelican Bay State Prison, Security Housing Unit Cell Search\nReceipt,’ ” which stated that “ ‘all paperwork removed for review’ ” by internal affairs.\nPlaintiff complained about the lack of information and itemization on the receipt, but\ndefendants refused to give him an itemized account of the property taken.\n       On January 20, 2010, plaintiff went to the prison law library. Upon returning to\nhis housing unit around 1:30 p.m., he was notified by the control booth officer that his\nproperty had been returned to the unit. However, because plaintiff was not in the unit, his\nproperty was left unattended in the trash/storage room. Plaintiff asked defendant M.\nBrown, a floor officer who had just begun her shift, whether she had seen his property in\nthe trash/storage room. Defendant Brown told plaintiff that his property was in that room\nin large garbage bags and that she would “issue it to him” when she had the time.\nPlaintiff’s conversation with defendant Brown took place some time between 1:30 and\n1:45 p.m.\n       Plaintiff’s property was not returned to him until about 6:30 p.m. on January 20,\n2010, after the evening meal was served, trays were collected, and the garbage was\nthrown out. Plaintiff’s property, which had been put in large plastic garbage bags, was\nleft unattended for five hours in the garbage/storage room. Upon an initial inspection of\nhis property, plaintiff noticed that defendants Silveria, Milligan, Pimentel, and\nRosenberg, again had failed to itemize the property that had been confiscated and/or\nreturned. Plaintiff discovered that all of his legal paperwork was missing.\n       Plaintiff immediately notified defendant Brown that all of his legal paperwork was\nmissing and that the cell search receipt was missing as well. Defendant Brown told\nplaintiff to address his concerns to defendant Silveria, as he was the one who had left the\nproperty in the storage room.\n\n\n                                             3\n\f       On January 30, 2010, plaintiff filed an inmate appeal requesting the return of all of\nhis “legal property.” Plaintiff received an informal response on or about February 3,\n2010, from Lieutenant Vanderhooven, who stated: “ ‘Your property was searched and\nreturned to you, including your legal work. No property was retained and no disciplinary\nreport issued.’ ”\n       On February 8, 2010, plaintiff requested a formal level review of the informal\nclaim, asserting that the informal review did not address the issues raised, but only served\nto continue the “pattern of constitutional violations.” Thereafter, Lieutenant Anthony\ninterviewed plaintiff and told him that he would locate and return plaintiff’s legal\nproperty.\n       On or about April 2, 2010, plaintiff received an “unsatisfactory” Warden level’s\nresponse from Lieutenant Anthony, which had been authorized by defendants Captain\nK.L. McGuyer, Associate Warden M.J. Nimrod, and Warden D.G. Adams. Although the\nresponse purported to partially grant plaintiff’s appeal, plaintiff’s complaint was “only\nhalf-heartedly investigated or not investigated at all.”\n       On April 18, 2010, plaintiff sought Director’s level review of his grievance,\nrequesting the return of his legal property and claiming that the staff at Pelican Bay were\n“continuing to violate [his] constitutional rights and have denied [him] access to the\ncourts in [his] pending legal matter.” Thereafter, on or about July 28, 2010, defendants\nD. Stark, an appeals examiner at the Inmate Appeals Branch (IAB), and D. Foston, chief\nexaminer at IAB, issued a response in which they “did no investigation into the issues,”\nbut “merely reiterated the statements made at the previous levels of review.”\n                                         I. DISCUSSION\nA.     Standard of Review\n       “ ‘On appeal from a dismissal after an order sustaining a demurrer, we review the\norder de novo, exercising our independent judgment about whether the complaint states a\ncause of action as a matter of law.’ (Lazar v.

When the demurrer is sustained without leave to\namend, we review the denial for leave to amend for abuse of discretion.

Nevertheless, we “may not consider conclusions of\nfact or law, opinions, speculation or allegations which are contrary either to law or to\njudicially noticed facts.” (Ibid.)\nB.     Writ Relief Regarding Return of Property (First and Second Causes of Action)\n       Plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer without leave\nto amend by failing to recognize that his causes of action for bailment and conversion\nsought writ relief. It appears, as defendants concede, that plaintiff was seeking writ relief\nwith respect to his bailment and conversion claims. For example, the civil complaint\ncover sheet states, “Plaintiff seeks specific recovery of Bailed property and order\ncompelling defendants to perform a ministerial duty owed Plaintiff.” The face of the\nattached complaint is also entitled “Complaint Seeking Specific Performance of a\nMinisterial Duty to Return Property Arising From Bailment.”\n       On appeal, plaintiff contends that the trial court should not have dismissed on the\ngrounds that he failed to comply with the Government Tort Claims act because inmates\nare not required to file a government tort claim when seeking a writ of mandate for return\nof property. We, however, review a trial court’s decision, not its reasoning. (Ladas v.\nCalifornia State Auto. Assn. (1993) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2269931\"><a href=\"/opinion/2269931/ladas-v-california-state-auto-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Additionally, as background to our\nconsideration of the issues in this case, we recognize the principle embodied in Penal\nCode section 2600 that “[a] person sentenced to imprisonment in a state prison . . . may\nduring that period of confinement be deprived of such rights, and only such rights, as is\nreasonably related to legitimate penological interests.”2\n\n\n2\n  Penal Code section 2601 elaborates that “[s]ubject only to the provisions of that section,\neach person described in Section 2600,” shall have certain retained rights, including the\nright to private property.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">498</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> is controlling. In Escamilla, after a prison riot, an inmate was placed in\nthe SHU. (Id. at p. 502.) The inmate had placed his personal clothing, watch, and items\nhe had just purchased from the canteen into bags to be kept until he was released from the\nSHU. (Ibid.) When he was released from the SHU, his items were not returned to him.\n(Ibid.) After the inmate’s appeals seeking $255 compensation for the lost items were\ndenied, he filed a writ of habeas corpus, which the trial court granted. (Id. at pp. 504-\n505.)\n        On appeal, the court determined the appropriate writ to address the situation was a\nwrit of mandate, rather than habeas corpus. (Escamilla, supra, 141 Cal.App.4th at\npp. 505-508.) It concluded a claim for return of specific property held by a public entity\nas bailee did not require presentation of a government claim prior to seeking judicial\nrelief by way of mandate, because it was not a claim for money or damages to which the\n\n\n                                              7\n\fclaim filing requirement applied. (Id. at p. 506.) In so holding, the court quoted Minsky\nv.

[Citations.]’ [Citation.]” (Escamilla, supra, 141 Cal.App.4th at p. 506, italics\nadded.)\n       Defendants, on the other hand, argue that Flores v. Department of Corrections and\nRehabilitation (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">199</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 208 (Flores), is dispositive of the issues on\nappeal. In Flores, the court held that prison officials did not abuse their discretion in\nrefusing to return a contraband television to an inmate.    In so holding, it distinguished\nEscamilla, explaining that in Escamilla “the property . . . was not [confiscated] as\ncontraband; it was merely . . . held for safekeeping.” (Flores, supra, 224 Cal.App.4th at\np. 208.) In Flores, in contrast, “plaintiff’s property was not simply taken from him for\nsafekeeping when he was arrested or placed in segregated housing; it was seized as\ncontraband. Thus, in taking possession of plaintiff’s property, defendants were not acting\nas bailees charged with an obligation to safely keep and return the television.” (Ibid.) In\nreaching this conclusion, the court noted that the plaintiff had not alleged any “facts\nshowing that the television was not contraband, for example, that it was properly\nengraved with plaintiff’s name . . . or that he had proof sufficient to establish his\nownership, such as a receipt for its purchase bearing a serial number matching the serial\nnumber on the television.” (Ibid.)\n       Contrary to the respective positions of the parties, the facts of the instant case do\nnot squarely align with either Escamillia or Flores. For example, unlike in Escamilla, the\nproperty at issue was not simply taken from plaintiff for safekeeping. Rather, the\ncomplaint states that it was “seized” as part of an “ ‘investigation into gang activity.’ ”\nHowever, here, unlike in Flores, plaintiff alleged facts showing that the property seized\n\n\n                                              8\n\fwas not actually contraband. The fact that defendants attempted to return the seized\nproperty to plaintiff and that they did not take any disciplinary measures against plaintiff\nbased on the seized property suggests a reasonable inference that the property confiscated\nwas later shown not to be contraband. This inference militates toward finding the instant\ncase more closely aligned with Flores.\n       Here, it appears that the confiscation of plaintiff’s property began as an authorized\nseizure of suspected contraband. However, once defendants determined that the seized\nproperty was not contraband they effectively became bailees of plaintiff’s property and,\nas such, they had a duty to safely keep and return plaintiff’s personal property.\n(Escamilla, supra, 141 Cal.App.4th at p. 510, fn. 10.) Plaintiff contends that the\ndefendants either negligently and/or intentionally lost or destroyed his legal property.\nConsequently, plaintiff has demonstrated that his claims for bailment (first cause of\naction) and conversion (second cause of action) are proper ones to pursue by petition for\nwrit of mandate.\nC.     Remaining Causes of Action\n       1.     Right to Own Legal Property (Third Cause of Action)\n       In his third cause of action, plaintiff purports to assert a claim of interference with\nhis “right to own legal property.” In support of this claim, plaintiff relies on various parts\nof the California Code of Regulations (see Cal.Code.Regs., tit. 15, §§ 3161, 3190, 3191,\n3193) as well as the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United\nStates Constitution.\n       Plaintiff characterizes his claim as one for the deprivation of his personal property\nwithout due process; that is that he has been wrongly denied ownership and possession of\nlegal materials necessary for his pending criminal appeal. Interests protected by the due\nprocess may arise from two sources—the Due Process Clause itself and laws of the\nstates. (Meachum v. Fano (1976) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 223-227.) The United States\nConstitution does not create a protected interest in property. (Board of Regents of State\nColleges v. Roth (1972) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108608\"><a href=\"/opinion/108608/board-of-regents-of-state-colleges-v-roth/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 577.) Rather, protected property interests “stem\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\ffrom an independent source such as state law—rules or understanding that secure certain\nbenefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.” (Ibid.)\n       Because there is no fundamental right to own personal property in prison, a due\nprocess right to such ownership would be created only by virtue of state statute or\nregulation. State law creates a protected interest if mandatory language in the law\nsubstantively restricts the discretion of state officials. (Hewitt v. Helms (1983) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">460</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 472 overruled in part on other grounds in Sandin v. Conner (1995) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n482-484.) The state regulations at issue do not contain such mandatory directives,\nhowever. For example, California Code of Regulations, title 15, section 3161 provides:\n“Inmate-owned legal materials/documents, law books and papers shall be limited to the\navailability of space authorized by section 3190(b) for personal property in the inmate’s\nquarters/living area except as specified in this section. Inmates may possess up to one\ncubic foot of legal materials/documents related to their active cases, in excess of the six\ncubic feet of allowable property in their assigned quarters/living area. Legal\nmaterials/documents, law books and papers in excess of this limitation shall be disposed\nof pursuant to section 3191(c). Inmates may request the institution/facility store excess\nlegal materials/documents related to their active cases(s) when such materials/documents\nexceed this one cubic foot additional allowance. Inmate-owned law books in excess of\nthe additional allowance shall not be stored by the institution/facility.”\n       Equally inapt are the provisions addressing the general policies of the California\nDepartment of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) regarding personal property\npossessed by inmates. (See Cal.Code Regs., tit. 15, § 3190 [General Policy (specifying\n“state-issued property items, and authorized personal/religious property items”)]; § 3191\n[Property Registration and Disposition (specifying procedure for “[r]egisterable personal\nproperty”)]; § 3193 [Liablity (specifying instances when department will be liable for\nloss or destruction of inmate personal property)].)\n       The language of these regulations does not create a legitimate claim of entitlement\nfor the “right to own legal property.” Therefore, a demurrer did lie as to plaintiff’s right\nto own property claim. We will therefore affirm the decision to sustain the demurrer.\n\n\n                                              10\n\f          Next, we must determine if plaintiff must be granted leave to amend this claim. If\n“an amendment could cure the defect,” then leave to amend must be granted. (Schifando\nv. City of Los Angeles (2003) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2520945\"><a href=\"/opinion/2520945/schifando-v-city-of-los-angeles/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1074</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1081, italics added.) That is, “unless the\ncomplaint shows on its face that it is incapable of amendment,” leave to amend must be\ngranted. (Lee v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (2003) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">931</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 942.) Here, the defect is that plaintiff did not cite to any\napplicable law supporting his claim of entitlement of the right to own property. Although\nthe specific regulations cited by plaintiff do not give rise to a cause of action, pursuant to\nPenal Code section 2601, subdivision (a), prisoners do retain the general right to own\npersonal property while in prison. Accordingly, as the complaint is clearly capable of\namendment by adding a claim under Penal Code section 2601, we direct the court to\ngrant plaintiff leave to amend the complaint as to his right to own property cause of\naction.\n          2.     Right of Access to the Court (Fourth Cause of Action)\n          Plaintiff claims that staff failed to return his confiscated legal materials, which had\nthe effect of violating his rights of access to the courts.\n          Prisoners have a constitutional right to access the courts. (Lewis v. Casey (1996)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">343</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 346.) There are at least two categories of suits prisoners bring to enforce\nthis right. (See Christopher v. Harbury (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121160\"><a href=\"/opinion/121160/christopher-v-harbury/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">403</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 412-414.) “In the first are\nclaims that systemic official action frustrates a plaintiff or plaintiff class in preparing and\nfiling suits at the present time.” (Id. at p. 413.) “The second category covers claims not\nin aid of a class of suits yet to be litigated, but of specific cases that cannot now be tried\n. . . no matter what official action may be in the future.” (Id. at pp. 413-414, fn. omitted.)\nIn either type of suit, the prisoner must plead facts demonstrating that the underlying\naction frustrated by prison officials was “ ‘nonfrivolous’ ” or “ ‘arguable.’ ” (Id. at\np. 415.) Moreover, when asserting claims in the second category, the complaint must\nidentify “a remedy that may be awarded as recompense . . . .” (Ibid.)\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\f       Here, plaintiff alleges that prison officials confiscated his property, including\n“legal property.” According to the complaint, Lieutenant Anthony said he would return\nthe legal materials, but failed to do so. The unreturned documents allegedly included “all\nof [plaintiff’s] . . . legal paperwork.” Plaintiff alleged that he had “a pending legal\ndeadline and needed his legal work.” Because this is an appeal from a demurrer, we treat\nthese allegations as true. (Thrifty Payless, Inc. v. Americana at Brand, LLC (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">218</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1230</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1234, fn. 1.) And, if true, the allegations could form the core of a\nviable denial of access claim. (Lewis v. Casey, supra, 518 U.S. at p. 350 [Supreme Court\nhas protected right to access courts “by prohibiting state prison officials from actively\ninterfering with inmates’ attempts to prepare legal documents”] , citing Johnson v. Avery\n(1969) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107840\"><a href=\"/opinion/107840/johnson-v-avery/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 489-490.)\n       Notably, the Supreme Court has imposed specific pleading requirements for denial\nof access claims. (See Christopher v. Harbury, supra, 536 U.S. at p. 415.) Here,\nplaintiff failed to satisfy those requirements by 1) not describing the underlying actions\nthat were adversely affected and 2) not proposing a remedy for the alleged violation.\n(See ibid.) Therefore, a demurrer did lie as to plaintiff’s denial of access claim. We will\ntherefore affirm the decision to sustain the demurrer.\n       Next, we must determine if plaintiff must be granted leave to amend this claim.\nHere, the defect is that plaintiff did not allege sufficient facts regarding the substance of\nthe underlying action, the specifics of how the action was adversely affected by\ndefendants’ alleged conduct, or proposed remedies. Since the complaint does not show\non its face that it is incapable of such an amendment, we direct the court to grant plaintiff\nleave to amend the complaint as to the claim he was unconstitutionally denied access to\nthe courts.\n       3.     Negligent Supervision (Fifth Cause of Action)\n       The court sustained the general demurrer to the fifth cause of action on the basis\nthat defendants Anthony, Cate, McGuyer, Milligan, Nimrod, Pimentel, Silveria, and\nVanderhooven could not be liable for negligent supervision because they are public\nemployees.\n\n\n                                              12\n\f       “[A] public employee is not liable for an injury caused by the act or omission of\nanother person.” (Gov.Code, § 820.8.) This immunity bar, however, does not apply\nwhen the public employee has some personal culpability for the injury. “Nothing in this\nsection exonerates a public employee from liability for injury proximately caused by his\nown negligent or wrongful act or omission.” (Ibid.; cf. Weaver v. State of California\n(1998) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2252371\"><a href=\"/opinion/2252371/weaver-v-state-of-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 202-203 [no personal involvement shown and no negligent\nsupervision or negligent training alleged].)\n       Preliminarily, we note that defendants Silveria and Pimentel were not named in\nthe fifth cause of action. Rather, this cause of action was limited to the alleged acts of\ndefendants Cate, Adams, Nimrod, Vanderhooven, Anthony, McGuyer, Stark, and Foston\nwith respect to “their failure to properly, independently investigate” plaintiff’s claim, and\nthat each of these defendants “having knowledge of plaintiff’s pending case, and missing\nproperty continued to ignore their duty to return plaintiff his legal property or have him\nfill out the requisite property disposition form.”\n       In this situation, there were ample facts alleged to support a negligence cause of\naction against Cate, Adams, Nimrod, Vanderhooven, Anthony, and McGuyer3 based on\nnegligent supervision and training which would take these defendants outside the\nimmunity bar of section 820.8 of the Government Code. M. Cate was alleged to be the\nDirector of the CDCR and who “exercises final an overall responsibility for the policies,\npractices, training and actions” of all CDCR employees; D.G. Adams was alleged to be\nthe “designated Warden” at Pelican Bay and who was “responsible for . . . the training\nand supervising [ ] of all employees” at Pelican Bay; M.J. Nimrod was alleged to be the\n“designated Associate Warden” at Pelican Bay, who was in the position of “training and\nsupervising all employees” at Pelican Bay; F. Vanderhooven was alleged to be a\n“correctional Lieutenant,” and who “issued the warrant/order” to the IGI officers “who\nseized plaintiff’s property and was/is responsible to oversee training and conduct” of IGI\n\n3\n      To the extent the fifth cause of action alleges conduct on part of defendants Stark\nand Foston, we express no opinion inasmuch as these defendants were not part of the\ndemurrer below and are not parties to the instant appeal.\n\n                                               13\n\fofficers; it was further alleged that Vanderhooven “personally searched plaintiff’s\nproperty after it [had been] seized” and he responded to plaintiff’s informal grievance and\nwas therefore “responsible [] for . . . insuring the investigation . . . and the return of\n[plaintiff’s] bailed property”; W. Anthony was alleged to be a “correctional Lieutenant”\nassigned to the ISU and that he “issued the warrant/order” to “the IGI officers who seized\nplaintiff’s property and was/is responsible to oversee training and conduct” of IGI\nofficers; it was further alleged that Anthony “personally searched plaintiff’s property\nafter it [had been] seized” and he responded to plaintiff’s grievance at the “Warden’s\nlevel of review,” and therefore “responsible [] for . . . insuring the investigation . . . and\nthe return of [plaintiff’s] bailed property”; K.L. McGuyer was alleged to be a\n“correctional Captain” assigned to the ISU and the “immediate supervisor” of all ISU and\nIGI “staff named herein and is responsible to overseeing training and conduct of those\nstaff”; it was further alleged that McGuyer approved the order assigning the IGI officers\nwho seized plaintiff’s property and he was responsible for overseeing plaintiff’s\ncomplaint at the “Warden’s level.”\n       Construed liberally, plaintiff’s allegations state a claim for negligence with respect\nto Director Cate, Warden Adams, Associate Warden Nimrod, Lieutenant Vanderhooven,\nLieutenant Anthony, and Captain McGuyer based on their personal involvement and/or\nnegligent supervision in the handling of plaintiff’s property.\nD.     Uncertainty\n       Ordinarily, our inquiry into an order sustaining a general demurrer “ends and\nreversal is required once we determine a complaint has stated a cause of action under any\nlegal theory.” (Genesis Environmental Services v. San Joaquin Valley Unified Air\nPollution Control Dist. (2003) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2278235\"><a href=\"/opinion/2278235/genesis-environmental-services-v-district/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">597</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 603.) Under this rule, our analysis\ncould have been limited to the bailment and conversion claims. We, however, chose to\naddress plaintiff’s right to own property, access-to-court, and negligent supervision\ncauses of action because those claims presented legal questions that, if resolved in this\nappeal, could promote the efficiency of subsequent proceedings. As a result, our\n\n\n\n                                               14\n\fdirections to the trial court are more detailed than a simple direction to enter an order\noverruling the general demurrer. (See id. at p. 608.)\n       From our reading of the complaint it is not clear whether plaintiff intends to\npursue any California tort law claim concerning damage to personal property (i.e.,\nnonconstitutional claims). Under California statute, a demurrer may be sustained on the\nground that the “pleading is uncertain.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (f).) Based on\nthis statute, we direct the trial court to sustain the demurrer as to potential California tort\nlaw claims for damage to personal property. (1 Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil\nProcedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2014) ¶ 6:104, p. 6–28.)\n       The court shall allow plaintiff an opportunity to resolve this uncertainty by\namending his pleading and clarifying whether he intends to pursue any state tort law\nclaims (see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.112(2) [each separately stated cause of action or\ncount must specifically state its nature (e.g., “ ‘for fraud’ ”).]\n       Additionally, plaintiff has brought five causes of action against 13 defendants.\nEach of the causes of action appear to be lodged against all of the defendants. However,\ncertain causes of action refer to individual defendants by name, while others merely\nreference the defendants as a group. In this regard, the complaint is uncertain as it fails to\nspecify the basis for liability for each defendant. Thus, sustaining the demurrer for\nuncertainty was not improper. However, denying leave to amend was an abuse of\ndiscretion. The court shall allow plaintiff an opportunity to resolve this uncertainty by\namending his pleading and clarifying the basis of liability for each defendant.\n\n\n\n\n                                               15\n\fE.

DISPOSITION\n      The judgment is reversed with respect to the first, second, and fifth causes of\naction. As to the third and fourth causes of action, the judgment is reversed only insofar\nas it denies leave to amend plaintiff’s right to own property and denial-access-to-the-\ncourts claims. The superior court is directed to enter an order 1) overruling the demurrer\nas to the first, second, and fifth causes of action; 2) sustaining the demurrer to plaintiff’s\nthird cause of action with leave to amend; 3) sustaining the demurrer to plaintiff’s fourth\ncause of action with leave to amend; 4) sustaining the demurrer on grounds of\nuncertainty and with leave to amend as to any California tort law claims for damage to\npersonal property and to specify the basis of liability for each defendant.\n      The parties to bear their own costs on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\f                                 _________________________\n                                 REARDON, J.\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n_________________________\nRUVOLO, P.
