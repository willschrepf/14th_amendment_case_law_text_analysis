Specifically, these\nappeals contest the district court’s: (1) creation of\nthe St. Louis Career Education District (CED) and\nappointment of an interim board to direct the CED; (2)\ndetermination that as of January 1997 the vocational\neducation system for the St. Louis metropolitan area,\nthen operated by the Special School District of St. Louis\nCounty (SSD), had not achieved unitary status; and (3)\nfunding orders designed to ensure operation of the CED\nfor the 1997-98 school year. As a threshold matter, it\nis argued that the district court abused its discretion\nin issuing the above orders without holding a hearing and\nmaking the necessary findings of facts and conclusions of\nlaw based on a developed record. Although we recognize\nthe district court’s intimate involvement with this case\nover the last seventeen years, we agree that it is\nnecessary for the district court to develop the factual\nrecord and legal conclusions in a manner that is\n\n                            33\n\freviewable by this court. We thus remand to the district\ncourt to hold a prompt hearing on the issues raised in\nthis consolidated appeal as well as the unaddressed\nissues of long-term governance, finance, and structure of\nthe vocational education program in the St. Louis\nmetropolitan area. Thereafter, the district court is to\nenter a comprehensive order on these matters consistent\nwith the decisions of the United States\n\n\n\n\n                           34\n\fSupreme Court and this court, the ultimate aim of which\nwill be to ensure that the young men and women of all\nraces--whether they live in the city or the county--will\nat long last have an equal opportunity to secure a\nquality, integrated vocational education that will train\nthem to be productive members of the St. Louis\nmetropolitan area.\n\n                           I.\n\n    In the mid-1960s, the State of Missouri established\ntwo vocational education systems for the St. Louis\nmetropolitan area: one in St. Louis County and the other\nin the City of St. Louis. In 1980, pursuant to actions\nfiled by black parents and teachers, the district court\nfound that the school districts had been established to\ncreate a dual system of vocational education:            a\npredominantly white district in St. Louis County and a\npredominantly black district in the City of St. Louis.\nLiddell v. Board of Educ., 491 F. Supp. 351, 358 (E.D. Mo.\n1980).   The court further found that the State had the\npower to merge the dual system and that the State’s\nfailure to do so was “part and parcel of the State’s\nfailure to eradicate root and branch the dual system it\nonce formally mandated.” Id. The court directed that the\nState, the United States, and the Board of Education for\nthe City of St. Louis (City Board) develop a plan for “the\nconsolidation or merger and full desegregation of the\nseparate vocational education programs operated by the\n[SSD] and the school district of the City of St. Louis,\nfor implementation in the 1981-82 school year.” Id. at\n353. We affirmed. Liddell v. Board of Educ., 667 F.2d\n643, 651 (8th Cir. 1981). We noted that the SSD had been\n\n\n                            35\n\fjoined as a defendant and that there was no reason why a\nconsolidated, integrated vocational school could not be\nopened at the beginning of the 1981-82 school year.\n\n    In May 1981, the parties negotiated a settlement\nagreement that was approved in substance by the district\ncourt after a hearing. The agreement did not require the\nestablishment of a consolidated, integrated vocational\nschool, but rather permitted the SSD and the City Board to\noperate their own vocational schools and set racial goals\nfor each school. The State, as the primary constitutional\nviolator, was given responsibility\n\n\n\n\n                            36\n\fto fund elements of the plan.       The remedy was to be\neffective for a five-year period.        The Metropolitan\nCoordinating Committee (MCC), made up of representatives\nfrom the City Board, the SSD, and the State, was appointed\nby the court to monitor and administer vocational\neducation and to ensure that the various schools met\ncourt-ordered racial balances.      This court affirmed.\nLiddell v. Board of Educ., 677 F.2d 626 (8th Cir. 1982).\nWe noted that if the plan did not result in the\nintegration of vocational schools, a complete merger of\nthe city and county systems could be ordered. Id. at 636.\n\n    In 1986 and 1987, the district court adjusted the 1980\nplan, ordering the SSD and the city district to each\ncontinue offering vocational education, modifying the\nracial goals, and requiring the State to pay the costs of\ninterdistrict transportation.   Liddell v. Board of Educ.,\n654 F. Supp. 334, 339, 342 (E.D. Mo. 1987); (L(746)86).\nBecause of declining vocational enrollment, the district\ncourt also ordered two county technical schools closed,\nleaving one technical school in the county and one in the\ncity. Liddell, 654 F. Supp. at 337. This court approved\nthe revised plan as being within the informed discretion\nof the district court but ordered the district court to\nconduct a hearing to determine whether one of the county\nschools should be closed. Liddell v. Board of Educ., 822\nF.2d 1446, 1455-57 (8th Cir. 1987).       We reminded the\ndistrict court that it had broad authority to provide a\nquality, integrated system for the black and white\nchildren of the St. Louis metropolitan area, id. at 1455,\nand that if the voluntary plan as ordered did not work,\nthe district court and this court retained the authority\nto direct a complete merger of the vocational programs\n\n\n                            37\n\fwith a unified governing and taxing structure.    Id. at\n1460.\n\n    The district court conducted a seven-day hearing on\nthe closure issue and the future of integrated vocational\neducation. After the hearing, the district court directed\nthe parties to work out a plan designating the St. Louis\nCommunity College as the sole provider of vocational\neducation in the city and the county.     See Liddell v.\nBoard of Educ., 733 F. Supp. 1324, 1325 (E.D. Mo. 1990)\n(citing district court order\n\n\n\n\n                           38\n\fL(2293)89).    This attempt failed because turf battles\nbetween the City Board and the SSD led the St. Louis\nCommunity College to withdraw its participation. Id. In\n1988, the city’s only vocational school was converted into\na magnet school. See Liddell v. Board of Educ., 758 F.\nSupp. 499, 500 (E.D. Mo. 1991).\n\n    In 1990, the district court stated its “profound lack\nof confidence in either the City Board or the [SSD]’s\nability to manage a secondary vocational-education system\nwhich meets the needs of all students and parents” and\nnoted that neither district had demonstrated any interest\nin renovating the antiquated vocational education system.\n Liddell, 733 F. Supp. at 1325-26.     Although the court\nstated its belief that a single governing entity would be\nthe best way to administer a stable, integrated system, it\nrecognized the difficulties inherent in that option. Id.\nat 1327-28.     Focusing on the need for excellence in\neducation, the district court proposed a restructured\nsystem whereby the SSD and the City Board would each\noperate   a   racially-balanced   program   and,   through\nincentives and innovation, compete for students. Id. at\n1328. The State was required to pay the transportation\ncosts for the interdistrict transfers. Id. at 1330.\n\n    Less than one year later, in January 1991, the\ndistrict court determined that the 1990 plan was not\nworking and determined that a single, unified provider of\nvocational education was the only way to ensure that a\nquality, integrated vocational education would be provided\nto all the students of the St. Louis metropolitan area.\nLiddell, 758 F. Supp. at 503-05.      The district court,\n\n\n\n                            39\n\fwithout a hearing,1 designated the SSD as the sole provider\nof vocational education beginning with the 1991-92 school\nyear.    The State was ordered to pay interdistrict\ntransportation and other costs.       Id.   On appeal, we\nrecognized the concern that the SSD, elected exclusively\nby county residents, might\n\n\n\n\n      1\n        The City Board, the Liddell plaintiffs, and the St. Louis teachers’ union asserted\nthat they were entitled to a hearing on the matter. Board of Educ. v. Missouri, 936 F.2d\n993, 996 (8th Cir. 1991). The SSD argued that a hearing was unnecessary. Because\nthe district court previously held a comprehensive seven-day hearing, which included\nthe issue of single governance, we agreed that no hearing was required. Id. at 996-97.\n                                           40\n\fnot have the interests of the city students at heart.\nLiddell v. Board of Educ., 936 F.2d 993, 997 (8th Cir.\n1991).    Nonetheless, noting that the district court\nretained the power to consolidate the dual system, we\nagreed with the district court that the SSD was the only\nexisting entity capable of providing a viable, ongoing,\nvocational education program for both county and city\nstudents. Id. We emphasized the vital importance of the\nSSD operating vocational educational facilities in the\ncity. Id. at 998. The SSD assured this court that it had\nboth the financial means and the intention to do so.\nMoreover, we noted that the district court had the power\nto require the parties to provide the necessary funds for\na quality, integrated education. Id. at 999.\n\n\n    Rather than opening a city site, as advised by the\ndistrict court and our court, the SSD reopened one of the\ntwo county schools previously closed by court order. For\nthe city, the SSD developed a three-phase plan, which\ncalled for the opening of over twenty-five satellite\nsites, with the possibility of later consolidation of the\nsatellite sites into one facility. Three years later, the\nMCC reported to the district court that the SSD’s\nperformance in complying with its city-site plan was “poor\nwith little prospect for improvement.” G(1002)93. The\nMCC highlighted, in particular, the SSD’s failure to\nprovide vocational education to city students:      it had\nmade only three of the proposed twenty-five satellite\nprograms available and, after two years, only sixteen\nstudents were participating in a city-site program. Id.\nThe report also stated that the city programs appeared to\nreceive little support from the SSD administration.\n\n\n                            41\n\f     On March 22, 1995, the MCC and the SSD issued a joint\nreport    which   recognized    that   under   the   SSD’s\nadministration, the opportunities for city and county\nstudents for vocational education were uneven. G(1511)95.\nThey recommended the appointment of a planning body to\ndevelop the specific operating details for implementing a\ncomprehensive vocational education program. Specifically,\nthe planning board should consider a single, independent\nentity to administer vocational education for city and\ncounty students and the establishment of one or more four-\nyear\n\n\n\n\n                            42\n\facademies, at least one to be located in the city.     The\nplanning committee was to make recommendations with\nrespect to the level and sources of funding. The joint\nreport suggested that July 1996 was a realistic date for\ntransition to the new program and that when the designated\nentity began to provide vocational education, the court\nshould declare vocational education in the city and county\nunitary.\n\n    On April 26, 1995, after all parties had an\nopportunity to comment, the district court found “that the\ncurrent vocational education plan is not achieving the\ngoals of this case” and that the need for a four-year\nacademy in the city was supported by the record and would\nbe a major step toward compliance with earlier court\norders. G(1562)95. Agreeing with the joint report, the\ndistrict court stated that the “creation of a new\nindependent governing entity [to be called the Career\nEducation District (CED)] would best ensure the delivery\nof a quality, integrated vocational education system for\nall students in the St. Louis area.” Id. Accordingly,\nthe court appointed a planning coordinator who was to\nreport to the court on a proposed schedule and budget for\nthe planning process. It ordered that the SSD continue to\nbe the sole provider for vocational education for the\n1995-96 school year. No appeal was taken from this order.\n\n    On   March 21, 1996, after considering budget\nrecommendations, the district court ordered the SSD to pay\nto the CED $2.45 million as interim funding. The SSD\npromptly appealed. This court issued a stay. While the\nappeal was pending, the CED, the State of Missouri, the\nCity Board, and the SSD entered into a joint stipulation\nand   settlement   agreement   that   provided   for   the\n                            43\n\festablishment of an interim vocational education site in\nSt. Louis with the State, the City Board, and the SSD each\nto pay an equal amount for the operation of the school for\nthe 1996-97 school year. G(2084)96. The SSD’s appeal was\nwithdrawn.\n\n    On June 25, 1996, the district court entered an order\ncreating the CED.    G(2122)96.    It named the initial\nmembers of the board of education and directed the\n\n\n\n\n                            44\n\fState, the City Board, and the SSD each to pay the CED’s\nfiscal agent $330,444 on or before July 1, 1996; September\n3, 1996; and January 15, 1997. The State, the City Board,\nand the SSD all appeal or cross-appeal from this order.\n\n    On July 10, 1996, the SSD filed a motion seeking a\ndeclaration that the vocational educational system had\nachieved unitary status and requesting the court to\nrelinquish control of the system and to return control to\nstate and local authorities. The SSD requested a hearing.\nBaffled by the timing of the SSD’s motion after the\ncreation of the CED, the district court denied the motion\nwithout a hearing. G(2288)97. Consistent with its April\n1995 order, the district court reiterated that the record\ndocumented the SSD’s failure to accomplish the goal of\nproviding a quality, integrated vocational education\nsystem for St. Louis area students. The State and the SSD\nalso appeal this order.\n\n    On March 21, 1997, the district court ordered the SSD\nto transfer $490,780 to the CED on or before the 28th of\nthat month to be used by the CED for the 1997-98 school\nyear.   It noted that the SSD had unspent vocational\neducation funds of $532,200 from the 1996-97 school year.\nThe SSD and certain St. Louis County school districts\nappeal this order.\n\n    On May 8, 1997, the district court ordered the CED to\nassume responsibility for operating all secondary\nvocational public education in the city and county of St.\nLouis. The court set a hearing to consider proposals for\nthe CED’s 1997-98 budget. On June 13, 1997, after a two-\nday hearing, the district court adopted a $22 million\nbudget with the City Board to provide $7.2 million and the\n                            45\n\fSSD to provide $14.8 million to the CED. G(2450)97. It\nordered the State to continue to provide the city-to-\ncounty and county-to-city transportation, the SSD to lease\nthree county technical schools to the CED for $1 per site,\nand the State to pay $800,000 to the CED by July 15, 1997\nfor the renovation of Southwest High School to accommodate\nan additional 120 students.\n\n\n\n\n                            46\n\f    The SSD moved this court to stay the order pending\nresolution of the above appeals.      It suggested as an\nalternative that to maintain the status quo for the 1997-\n98 school year, the CED operate the city site, known as\nthe Career Academy, and the SSD operate the three\nvocational schools in the county; it further proposed that\nthe CED receive the same amount for the 1997-98 school\nyear as it received for the prior year, less the one-time,\nstart-up and capital costs and including the cost of\neducating 120 new students. We granted the stay until\nJuly 17, 1997, when the above appeals were argued and\nsubmitted.   The following day, in anticipation of this\nopinion, we ordered modification of the district court’s\nJune 13, 1997 order.\n\n                          II.\n\n    These appeals challenge the district court’s orders\ncreating the CED, denying unitary status, and providing\nthe CED with interim funding.     As part of each appeal,\nit is argued that the district court erred in failing to\nhold an evidentiary hearing and to make the necessary\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law before it issued\nthese orders. It is countered that the district court’s\ndecisions were fully supported by the record.          The\ndistrict court had before it numerous status and\nmonitoring reports to which the parties had an opportunity\nto respond.     Moreover, the court has been closely\nmonitoring this school desegregation case for nearly\nseventeen years, giving it an intimate knowledge of its\nhistory and development.\n\n\n\n\n                            47\n\f    We acknowledge that in this long and protracted case\nthe district court has issued several orders modifying\nthe original plan without holding a formal hearing and\nthat, on several occasions, we have sustained these\norders. Those past decisions, which either have not been\nappealed or have been appealed and affirmed, are the law\nof the case and need not be revisited. The importance of\nthe decisions on appeal, however, necessitates a formal\nhearing and detailed findings by the district court to\nsupport its decision. While the record is replete with\ninformation in the form of written documents that     if\naccepted in full may well support the district court’s\ndenial of\n\n\n\n\n                           48\n\funitary status, the parties are entitled to more, and\nthis court must have more to review carefully the\ndistrict court’s decision.       As the Supreme Court\nadmonished this court, where there is a need for detailed\narticulation of findings, we should not attempt to\nassemble an adequate record from the various reports that\nhave been filed by the parties or by court-appointed\ncommittees followed by district court orders.         See\nMissouri v. Jenkins, 115 S. Ct. 2038, 2055 (1995)\n(requiring a hearing for determination of partial unitary\nstatus). Accordingly, we must remand the appealed orders\nto the district court for a formal hearing followed by\ncomprehensive and detailed findings of fact and\nconclusions of law.\n\n      It is imperative that all of the issues now before\nus be addressed in a single, comprehensive proceeding and\nresolved well before the start of the 1998-99 school\nyear.     As to the unitary status motion, there is no\ndoubt that the vocational education program in the St.\nLouis metropolitan area was racially segregated.      See\nLiddell, 491 F. Supp. at 358 (finding a dual system had\nbeen created for vocational education).     Thus, as the\nSupreme Court has made clear, it must be demonstrated\nthat all steps necessary to eliminate the vestiges of an\nunconstitutional de jure system have been taken. Freeman\nv. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 485 (1992); Board of Educ. v.\nDowell, 498 U.S. 237, 245-46 (1991); Green v. County Sch.\nBd., 391 U.S. 430, 439 (1968).      In this inquiry, the\ndistrict court should be guided by the broad goal of\nproviding equal opportunities for quality, integrated\nvocational education for both city and county students,\nparticularly the long-standing concern that a vocational\n\n\n                           49\n\feducation facility be located in the city.2                           See Liddell,\n936 F.2d at 998.\n\n\n\n\n      2\n         We do not hold or imply that each of the twelve court-ordered goals as outlined\nin the March 7, 1996 report of the Vocational Education Oversight Office must be\nachieved to meet constitutional requirements for the establishment of unitary status.\nIt is for the district court to determine whether or the extent to which each of the goals\nmust be achieved to meet constitutional standards and to do this after hearing and\nfactfinding.\n                                           50\n\f    Should the district court determine that unitary\nstatus has not yet been attained, it must then turn to\nthe question of the appropriate remedy at this stage in\nlight of the goals of this case and the previous attempts\nto achieve a quality, integrated vocational education\nsystem.   As set forth at length in this opinion, the\ndistrict court has pursued several alternatives that have\nto date proved unsuccessful. If the court so determines\nonce again, it must fashion a remedy that is now feasible\nand most promising to be effective in light of what has\nalready been tried. See Green, 391 U.S. at 439 (listing\nseveral inquiries for assessing the effectiveness of a\nplan to disestablish state-imposed segregation). Whether\nor not the district court adheres to its decision to\nestablish a single independent body to administer\nvocational education in both the city and the county, it\nmust set forth in a reasoned, detailed decision the basis\nfor the remedy it imposes. Jenkins III, 115 S. Ct. at\n2055.\n\n    In addition, the district court must determine how\nthe remedy will be administered, including the questions\nof governance, funding, and structure, beyond the 1997-98\nschool year. In the interest of judicial economy and the\nneed for stability for students, parents, and faculty, it\nis critical that a decision be reached promptly so that,\nin the event of further appeals, there is no disruption\nto the 1998-99 school year.\n\n    Pending resolution of this matter, vocational\neducation must continue.      Recognizing the practical\ndifficulties inherent in any interim plan, we believe the\npreferable alternative is to leave the administration of\nvocational education as it was during the 1996-97 school\n                            51\n\fyear. Cf. Dayton Bd. of Educ. v. Brinkman, 443 U.S. 406,\n421 (1977) (permitting plan from previous school year to\nremain in effect pending resolution of appropriate\nremedy). Accordingly, the CED shall continue to operate\nthe Career Academy at Southwest High School for the 1997-\n98 school year, including the acceptance of a new class of\napproximately 120 students.    The SSD shall continue to\noperate the three county technical vocational schools for\nthe 1997-98 school year and will assume the use and\nresponsibility for maintenance of the facilities. The CED\nand the SSD shall be funded from the sources identified in\nthe district court’s June 13, 1997\n\n\n\n\n                            52\n\forder so as to permit each of them to operate their\nrespective vocational schools in accordance with the 1997-\n98 budget.3 The State shall pay $800,000 to the CED to\nbe used for the purposes specified in the June 13, 1997\norder. The State shall also continue to fund the costs of\ntransportation for city-to-county and county-to-city\ntransfers.\n\n    Representatives of the CED and the SSD shall meet\nimmediately with the district court to resolve the details\nnecessary to implement this plan, such as curriculum,\nfaculty and staff, computers, and bussing schedules. The\nrecord in this case as to cooperation between the parties\nand   with the district court is not impressive.\nCooperation is now essential to meet the needs of students\nwho desire a vocational education, and the district court\nshould issue the orders necessary to achieve this end. We\nknow that a formal hearing followed by factual findings is\nimpossible if all questions relating to the 1997-98 school\nyear are to be resolved in time for the school year to\nproceed as scheduled. Thus, the district court may make\nany orders it believes are necessary for the coming school\nyear without further hearings or findings of fact.\n\n    The time has come to move beyond turf battles between\nthe State, the city schools, and the county schools.\nStudents of all races, whether they live in the city or\nthe county, are entitled to an opportunity to have a\nquality, integrated vocational education now, not at some\n\n\n      3\n       In addition, the district court may need to reconsider its March 21, 1997 order\nrequiring the SSD to transfer $490,780 to the CED in light of our reallocation of\nresponsibilities for vocational education for the 1997-98 school year.\n                                          53\n\fdistant time.   Accordingly, we remand to the district\ncourt for actions consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                          54\n\fA true copy.\n\n    Attest.\n\n        CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                       55\n\f",

Specifically, these\nappeals contest the district court’s: (1) creation of\nthe St. Louis Career Education District (CED) and\nappointment of an interim board to direct the CED; (2)\ndetermination that as of January 1997 the vocational\neducation system for the St. Louis metropolitan area,\nthen operated by the Special School District of St. Louis\nCounty (SSD), had not achieved unitary status; and (3)\nfunding orders designed to ensure operation of the CED\nfor the 1997-98 school year. As a threshold matter, it\nis argued that the district court abused its discretion\nin issuing the above orders without holding a hearing and\nmaking the necessary findings of facts and conclusions of\nlaw based on a developed record. Although we recognize\nthe district court’s intimate involvement with this case\nover the last seventeen years, we agree that it is\nnecessary for the district court to develop the factual\nrecord and legal conclusions in a manner that is\n\n                            33\n\freviewable by this court. We thus remand to the district\ncourt to hold a prompt hearing on the issues raised in\nthis consolidated appeal as well as the unaddressed\nissues of long-term governance, finance, and structure of\nthe vocational education program in the St. Louis\nmetropolitan area. Thereafter, the district court is to\nenter a comprehensive order on these matters consistent\nwith the decisions of the United States\n\n\n\n\n                           34\n\fSupreme Court and this court, the ultimate aim of which\nwill be to ensure that the young men and women of all\nraces--whether they live in the city or the county--will\nat long last have an equal opportunity to secure a\nquality, integrated vocational education that will train\nthem to be productive members of the St. Louis\nmetropolitan area.\n\n                           I.\n\n    In the mid-1960s, the State of Missouri established\ntwo vocational education systems for the St. Louis\nmetropolitan area: one in St. Louis County and the other\nin the City of St. Louis. In 1980, pursuant to actions\nfiled by black parents and teachers, the district court\nfound that the school districts had been established to\ncreate a dual system of vocational education:            a\npredominantly white district in St. Louis County and a\npredominantly black district in the City of St. Louis.\nLiddell v. Board of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1798865\"><a href=\"/opinion/1798865/liddell-v-bd-of-ed-of-city-of-st-louis-mo/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 358 (E.D. Mo.\n1980).   The court further found that the State had the\npower to merge the dual system and that the State’s\nfailure to do so was “part and parcel of the State’s\nfailure to eradicate root and branch the dual system it\nonce formally mandated.” Id. The court directed that the\nState, the United States, and the Board of Education for\nthe City of St. Louis (City Board) develop a plan for “the\nconsolidation or merger and full desegregation of the\nseparate vocational education programs operated by the\n[SSD] and the school district of the City of St. Louis,\nfor implementation in the 1981-82 school year.” Id. at\n353. We affirmed. Liddell v.

We noted that the SSD had been\n\n\n                            35\n\fjoined as a defendant and that there was no reason why a\nconsolidated, integrated vocational school could not be\nopened at the beginning of the 1981-82 school year.\n\n    In May 1981, the parties negotiated a settlement\nagreement that was approved in substance by the district\ncourt after a hearing. The agreement did not require the\nestablishment of a consolidated, integrated vocational\nschool, but rather permitted the SSD and the City Board to\noperate their own vocational schools and set racial goals\nfor each school. The State, as the primary constitutional\nviolator, was given responsibility\n\n\n\n\n                            36\n\fto fund elements of the plan.       The remedy was to be\neffective for a five-year period.        The Metropolitan\nCoordinating Committee (MCC), made up of representatives\nfrom the City Board, the SSD, and the State, was appointed\nby the court to monitor and administer vocational\neducation and to ensure that the various schools met\ncourt-ordered racial balances.      This court affirmed.\nLiddell v.

Id. at\n1460.\n\n    The district court conducted a seven-day hearing on\nthe closure issue and the future of integrated vocational\neducation.

This attempt failed because turf battles\nbetween the City Board and the SSD led the St. Louis\nCommunity College to withdraw its participation. Id. In\n1988, the city’s only vocational school was converted into\na magnet school. See Liddell v. Board of Educ., 758 F.\nSupp. 499, 500 (E.D. Mo. 1991).\n\n    In 1990, the district court stated its “profound lack\nof confidence in either the City Board or the [SSD]’s\nability to manage a secondary vocational-education system\nwhich meets the needs of all students and parents” and\nnoted that neither district had demonstrated any interest\nin renovating the antiquated vocational education system.\n Liddell, 733 F. Supp. at 1325-26.     Although the court\nstated its belief that a single governing entity would be\nthe best way to administer a stable, integrated system, it\nrecognized the difficulties inherent in that option. Id.\nat 1327-28.     Focusing on the need for excellence in\neducation, the district court proposed a restructured\nsystem whereby the SSD and the City Board would each\noperate   a   racially-balanced   program   and,   through\nincentives and innovation, compete for students. Id. at\n1328. The State was required to pay the transportation\ncosts for the interdistrict transfers. Id. at 1330.\n\n    Less than one year later, in January 1991, the\ndistrict court determined that the 1990 plan was not\nworking and determined that a single, unified provider of\nvocational education was the only way to ensure that a\nquality, integrated vocational education would be provided\nto all the students of the St. Louis metropolitan area.\nLiddell, 758 F.

The district court,\n\n\n\n                            39\n\fwithout a hearing,1 designated the SSD as the sole provider\nof vocational education beginning with the 1991-92 school\nyear.

Nonetheless, noting that the district court\nretained the power to consolidate the dual system, we\nagreed with the district court that the SSD was the only\nexisting entity capable of providing a viable, ongoing,\nvocational education program for both county and city\nstudents. Id. We emphasized the vital importance of the\nSSD operating vocational educational facilities in the\ncity. Id. at 998. The SSD assured this court that it had\nboth the financial means and the intention to do so.\nMoreover, we noted that the district court had the power\nto require the parties to provide the necessary funds for\na quality, integrated education. Id. at 999.\n\n\n    Rather than opening a city site, as advised by the\ndistrict court and our court, the SSD reopened one of the\ntwo county schools previously closed by court order. For\nthe city, the SSD developed a three-phase plan, which\ncalled for the opening of over twenty-five satellite\nsites, with the possibility of later consolidation of the\nsatellite sites into one facility. Three years later, the\nMCC reported to the district court that the SSD’s\nperformance in complying with its city-site plan was “poor\nwith little prospect for improvement.” G(1002)93. The\nMCC highlighted, in particular, the SSD’s failure to\nprovide vocational education to city students:      it had\nmade only three of the proposed twenty-five satellite\nprograms available and, after two years, only sixteen\nstudents were participating in a city-site program. Id.\nThe report also stated that the city programs appeared to\nreceive little support from the SSD administration.\n\n\n                            41\n\f     On March 22, 1995, the MCC and the SSD issued a joint\nreport    which   recognized    that   under   the   SSD’s\nadministration, the opportunities for city and county\nstudents for vocational education were uneven. G(1511)95.\nThey recommended the appointment of a planning body to\ndevelop the specific operating details for implementing a\ncomprehensive vocational education program. Specifically,\nthe planning board should consider a single, independent\nentity to administer vocational education for city and\ncounty students and the establishment of one or more four-\nyear\n\n\n\n\n                            42\n\facademies, at least one to be located in the city.     The\nplanning committee was to make recommendations with\nrespect to the level and sources of funding. The joint\nreport suggested that July 1996 was a realistic date for\ntransition to the new program and that when the designated\nentity began to provide vocational education, the court\nshould declare vocational education in the city and county\nunitary.\n\n    On April 26, 1995, after all parties had an\nopportunity to comment, the district court found “that the\ncurrent vocational education plan is not achieving the\ngoals of this case” and that the need for a four-year\nacademy in the city was supported by the record and would\nbe a major step toward compliance with earlier court\norders. G(1562)95. Agreeing with the joint report, the\ndistrict court stated that the “creation of a new\nindependent governing entity [to be called the Career\nEducation District (CED)] would best ensure the delivery\nof a quality, integrated vocational education system for\nall students in the St. Louis area.” Id. Accordingly,\nthe court appointed a planning coordinator who was to\nreport to the court on a proposed schedule and budget for\nthe planning process. It ordered that the SSD continue to\nbe the sole provider for vocational education for the\n1995-96 school year. No appeal was taken from this order.\n\n    On   March 21, 1996, after considering budget\nrecommendations, the district court ordered the SSD to pay\nto the CED $2.45 million as interim funding. The SSD\npromptly appealed. This court issued a stay. While the\nappeal was pending, the CED, the State of Missouri, the\nCity Board, and the SSD entered into a joint stipulation\nand   settlement   agreement   that   provided   for   the\n                            43\n\festablishment of an interim vocational education site in\nSt. Louis with the State, the City Board, and the SSD each\nto pay an equal amount for the operation of the school for\nthe 1996-97 school year. G(2084)96. The SSD’s appeal was\nwithdrawn.\n\n    On June 25, 1996, the district court entered an order\ncreating the CED.    G(2122)96.    It named the initial\nmembers of the board of education and directed the\n\n\n\n\n                            44\n\fState, the City Board, and the SSD each to pay the CED’s\nfiscal agent $330,444 on or before July 1, 1996; September\n3, 1996; and January 15, 1997. The State, the City Board,\nand the SSD all appeal or cross-appeal from this order.\n\n    On July 10, 1996, the SSD filed a motion seeking a\ndeclaration that the vocational educational system had\nachieved unitary status and requesting the court to\nrelinquish control of the system and to return control to\nstate and local authorities. The SSD requested a hearing.\nBaffled by the timing of the SSD’s motion after the\ncreation of the CED, the district court denied the motion\nwithout a hearing. G(2288)97. Consistent with its April\n1995 order, the district court reiterated that the record\ndocumented the SSD’s failure to accomplish the goal of\nproviding a quality, integrated vocational education\nsystem for St. Louis area students. The State and the SSD\nalso appeal this order.\n\n    On March 21, 1997, the district court ordered the SSD\nto transfer $490,780 to the CED on or before the 28th of\nthat month to be used by the CED for the 1997-98 school\nyear.   It noted that the SSD had unspent vocational\neducation funds of $532,200 from the 1996-97 school year.\nThe SSD and certain St. Louis County school districts\nappeal this order.\n\n    On May 8, 1997, the district court ordered the CED to\nassume responsibility for operating all secondary\nvocational public education in the city and county of St.\nLouis. The court set a hearing to consider proposals for\nthe CED’s 1997-98 budget. On June 13, 1997, after a two-\nday hearing, the district court adopted a $22 million\nbudget with the City Board to provide $7.2 million and the\n                            45\n\fSSD to provide $14.8 million to the CED. G(2450)97. It\nordered the State to continue to provide the city-to-\ncounty and county-to-city transportation, the SSD to lease\nthree county technical schools to the CED for $1 per site,\nand the State to pay $800,000 to the CED by July 15, 1997\nfor the renovation of Southwest High School to accommodate\nan additional 120 students.\n\n\n\n\n                            46\n\f    The SSD moved this court to stay the order pending\nresolution of the above appeals.      It suggested as an\nalternative that to maintain the status quo for the 1997-\n98 school year, the CED operate the city site, known as\nthe Career Academy, and the SSD operate the three\nvocational schools in the county; it further proposed that\nthe CED receive the same amount for the 1997-98 school\nyear as it received for the prior year, less the one-time,\nstart-up and capital costs and including the cost of\neducating 120 new students. We granted the stay until\nJuly 17, 1997, when the above appeals were argued and\nsubmitted.   The following day, in anticipation of this\nopinion, we ordered modification of the district court’s\nJune 13, 1997 order.\n\n                          II.\n\n    These appeals challenge the district court’s orders\ncreating the CED, denying unitary status, and providing\nthe CED with interim funding.     As part of each appeal,\nit is argued that the district court erred in failing to\nhold an evidentiary hearing and to make the necessary\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law before it issued\nthese orders. It is countered that the district court’s\ndecisions were fully supported by the record.          The\ndistrict court had before it numerous status and\nmonitoring reports to which the parties had an opportunity\nto respond.     Moreover, the court has been closely\nmonitoring this school desegregation case for nearly\nseventeen years, giving it an intimate knowledge of its\nhistory and development.\n\n\n\n\n                            47\n\f    We acknowledge that in this long and protracted case\nthe district court has issued several orders modifying\nthe original plan without holding a formal hearing and\nthat, on several occasions, we have sustained these\norders. Those past decisions, which either have not been\nappealed or have been appealed and affirmed, are the law\nof the case and need not be revisited. The importance of\nthe decisions on appeal, however, necessitates a formal\nhearing and detailed findings by the district court to\nsupport its decision. While the record is replete with\ninformation in the form of written documents that     if\naccepted in full may well support the district court’s\ndenial of\n\n\n\n\n                           48\n\funitary status, the parties are entitled to more, and\nthis court must have more to review carefully the\ndistrict court’s decision.       As the Supreme Court\nadmonished this court, where there is a need for detailed\narticulation of findings, we should not attempt to\nassemble an adequate record from the various reports that\nhave been filed by the parties or by court-appointed\ncommittees followed by district court orders.         See\nMissouri v. Jenkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117944\"><a href=\"/opinion/117944/missouri-v-jenkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Accordingly, we must remand the appealed orders\nto the district court for a formal hearing followed by\ncomprehensive and detailed findings of fact and\nconclusions of law.\n\n      It is imperative that all of the issues now before\nus be addressed in a single, comprehensive proceeding and\nresolved well before the start of the 1998-99 school\nyear.     As to the unitary status motion, there is no\ndoubt that the vocational education program in the St.\nLouis metropolitan area was racially segregated.      See\nLiddell, 491 F. Supp. at 358 (finding a dual system had\nbeen created for vocational education).     Thus, as the\nSupreme Court has made clear, it must be demonstrated\nthat all steps necessary to eliminate the vestiges of an\nunconstitutional de jure system have been taken. Freeman\nv.

In this inquiry, the\ndistrict court should be guided by the broad goal of\nproviding equal opportunities for quality, integrated\nvocational education for both city and county students,\nparticularly the long-standing concern that a vocational\n\n\n                           49\n\feducation facility be located in the city.2                           See Liddell,\n936 F.2d at 998.\n\n\n\n\n      2\n         We do not hold or imply that each of the twelve court-ordered goals as outlined\nin the March 7, 1996 report of the Vocational Education Oversight Office must be\nachieved to meet constitutional requirements for the establishment of unitary status.\nIt is for the district court to determine whether or the extent to which each of the goals\nmust be achieved to meet constitutional standards and to do this after hearing and\nfactfinding.\n                                           50\n\f    Should the district court determine that unitary\nstatus has not yet been attained, it must then turn to\nthe question of the appropriate remedy at this stage in\nlight of the goals of this case and the previous attempts\nto achieve a quality, integrated vocational education\nsystem.   As set forth at length in this opinion, the\ndistrict court has pursued several alternatives that have\nto date proved unsuccessful. If the court so determines\nonce again, it must fashion a remedy that is now feasible\nand most promising to be effective in light of what has\nalready been tried. See Green, 391 U.S. at 439 (listing\nseveral inquiries for assessing the effectiveness of a\nplan to disestablish state-imposed segregation). Whether\nor not the district court adheres to its decision to\nestablish a single independent body to administer\nvocational education in both the city and the county, it\nmust set forth in a reasoned, detailed decision the basis\nfor the remedy it imposes. Jenkins III, 115 S. Ct. at\n2055.\n\n    In addition, the district court must determine how\nthe remedy will be administered, including the questions\nof governance, funding, and structure, beyond the 1997-98\nschool year. In the interest of judicial economy and the\nneed for stability for students, parents, and faculty, it\nis critical that a decision be reached promptly so that,\nin the event of further appeals, there is no disruption\nto the 1998-99 school year.\n\n    Pending resolution of this matter, vocational\neducation must continue.      Recognizing the practical\ndifficulties inherent in any interim plan, we believe the\npreferable alternative is to leave the administration of\nvocational education as it was during the 1996-97 school\n                            51\n\fyear.

Accordingly, the CED shall continue to operate\nthe Career Academy at Southwest High School for the 1997-\n98 school year, including the acceptance of a new class of\napproximately 120 students.    The SSD shall continue to\noperate the three county technical vocational schools for\nthe 1997-98 school year and will assume the use and\nresponsibility for maintenance of the facilities. The CED\nand the SSD shall be funded from the sources identified in\nthe district court’s June 13, 1997\n\n\n\n\n                            52\n\forder so as to permit each of them to operate their\nrespective vocational schools in accordance with the 1997-\n98 budget.3 The State shall pay $800,000 to the CED to\nbe used for the purposes specified in the June 13, 1997\norder. The State shall also continue to fund the costs of\ntransportation for city-to-county and county-to-city\ntransfers.\n\n    Representatives of the CED and the SSD shall meet\nimmediately with the district court to resolve the details\nnecessary to implement this plan, such as curriculum,\nfaculty and staff, computers, and bussing schedules. The\nrecord in this case as to cooperation between the parties\nand   with the district court is not impressive.\nCooperation is now essential to meet the needs of students\nwho desire a vocational education, and the district court\nshould issue the orders necessary to achieve this end. We\nknow that a formal hearing followed by factual findings is\nimpossible if all questions relating to the 1997-98 school\nyear are to be resolved in time for the school year to\nproceed as scheduled. Thus, the district court may make\nany orders it believes are necessary for the coming school\nyear without further hearings or findings of fact.\n\n    The time has come to move beyond turf battles between\nthe State, the city schools, and the county schools.\nStudents of all races, whether they live in the city or\nthe county, are entitled to an opportunity to have a\nquality, integrated vocational education now, not at some\n\n\n      3\n       In addition, the district court may need to reconsider its March 21, 1997 order\nrequiring the SSD to transfer $490,780 to the CED in light of our reallocation of\nresponsibilities for vocational education for the 1997-98 school year.\n                                          53\n\fdistant time.
