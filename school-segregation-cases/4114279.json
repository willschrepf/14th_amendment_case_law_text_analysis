Stat. (2014); (2) the Vendor had unfettered discretion\n\n\n                                        2\n\fin printing and mailing notices and citations in violation of a statutory requirement\n\nthat only an officer can “issue” citations, id.; and (3) the Vendor had unfettered\n\ndiscretion to send an electronic copy of the citation to the Clerk of Courts in\n\nviolation of the statutory requirement that only an officer “shall provide” an\n\nelectronic copy to the Clerk, section 316.650(3)(c), Fla. Stat. (2014).\n\n      For the reasons explained below, we reject Jimenez’s arguments. In\n\nparticular, we hold that the review of red light camera images authorized by\n\nsection 316.0083(1)(a) allows a municipality’s vendor, as its agent, to review and\n\nsort images to forward to a police officer where, as here, (1) the vendor’s decisions\n\nin this regard are strictly circumscribed by contract language, guidelines\n\npromulgated by the municipality, and actual practices, such that the vendor’s\n\ndecisions are essentially ministerial and non-discretionary; (2) these ministerial\n\ndecisions are further limited by an overarching policy of automatically passing all\n\nclose calls to the police for their review; (3) it is the police officer that makes the\n\nactual decision whether probable cause exists and whether a notice and citation\n\nshould issue; and (4) the officer’s decision that probable cause exists and a citation\n\nissues consists of a full, professional review by an identified officer who is\n\nresponsible for that decision and does not merely acquiesce in any determination\n\nmade by the vendor.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f      Due to these circumstances, we distinguish City of Hollywood v. Arem, 154\n\nSo. 3d 359 (Fla. 4th DCA 2014), in which the Fourth District dismissed a traffic\n\ncitation on the grounds that a city’s process of using red light cameras gave\n\nunfettered discretion to a vendor. Because of the broad public and institutional\n\ninterest in red light cameras, we certify three issues to the Florida Supreme Court\n\nas having great public importance.\n\n                         BACKGROUND AND FACTS\n\n      A. The Mark Wandall Traffic Safety Act.\n\n      On July 1, 2010, the Legislature enacted the Mark Wandall Traffic Safety\n\nAct, which authorized local governments to use cameras to enforce traffic lights.\n\nCh. 2010-80, Laws of Fla., partially codified at § 316.0083, Fla. Stat. (2010). The\n\nWandall Act was named in honor of Mark Wandall, whose wife was nine months\n\npregnant when he was killed by a driver who ran a red light. City of Orlando v.\n\nUdowychenko, 98 So. 3d 589, 596 n.10 (Fla. 5th DCA. 2012). According to the\n\naccompanying committee report, seventy-six people were killed in 2008 in Florida\n\nby drivers running red lights. See House of Representatives Staff Analysis, at p. 2,\n\nCS/CS/HB 325 (Mar. 9, 2010).\n\n      At the heart of the dispute in this case is the Wandall Act’s express\n\nauthorization for local governments to use “agents” to “review” images before the\n\n“officer” issues a citation. On this point, the Wandall Act reads, “[t]his paragraph\n\n\n\n                                         4\n\fdoes not prohibit a review of information from a traffic infraction detector by an\n\nauthorized employee or agent of the department, a county, or a municipality before\n\nissuance of the traffic citation by the traffic infraction enforcement officer.” §\n\n316.0083(1)(a), Fla. Stat.\n\n      B. The Vendor’s Sorting of Images.\n\n      The City and the Vendor entered into a contract whereby the Vendor is\n\nresponsible for installing, maintaining, monitoring, and assisting in administering a\n\n“digital photo red light enforcement system” which includes a network of\n\ncomputers, sensors, speed detectors, timers, cameras, printers, and mailing\n\ncapabilities, all supported by software owned by or licensed to the Vendor.\n\n      Under the contract and its various amendments, the Vendor sorts the\n\ninformation and images generated by the system into two databases: a “working”\n\ndatabase that the City police review to decide whether to issue a citation and a\n\n“non-working” database that the City police do not review for that purpose. Each\n\nimage placed in the non-working database is reported, and the reason for placing\n\nthe image in the non-working database is explained by the Vendor on a report\n\nscreen. The report screen is periodically reviewed by the sergeant in charge of the\n\nCity’s review. The non-working database remains available and is occasionally\n\naccessed by the police for other investigations.\n\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\f      Each month, approximately 5,000 images are sorted into the working\n\ndatabase and 3,000 are sorted into the non-working database. The police sergeant\n\nwho oversees the City’s review testified that the City would be overwhelmed if it\n\nwas required to review all images generated by the system.\n\n      To sort images, the Vendor conducts a review that includes (1) confirming\n\nworkable images exist (and the camera did not simply misfire); (2) examining the\n\nimages to verify the license plate of the subject vehicle is legible; (3) using the\n\nlicense plate number in an automated process to obtain the identifying information\n\nof the registered owner from the Florida Department of Motor Vehicles; (4)\n\nconfirming the capture of date, time-of-day, speed, and timing-of-light data; (5)\n\nchecking the “A” shot, which is a still photograph showing the vehicle approaching\n\nthe intersection; (6) checking the “B” shot, which shows the vehicle in the\n\nintersection; and (7) checking the twelve-second video clip that shows the vehicle\n\napproaching and traveling through the intersection. The Vendor can pause the\n\nvideo and view it frame by frame.\n\n      A representative of the Vendor testified that the Vendor’s task when\n\nreviewing images was to filter out images that were “useless.” A clear example,\n\nshe explained, is where a camera simply misfired and failed to record an image.\n\nOther examples are where the light displays green or where images fail to capture a\n\nvehicle’s license plate number. These images were useless, she testified, because\n\n\n\n                                        6\n\f“the police cannot do anything with them.” But other images are determined to be\n\nuseless based on the specific and detailed contract language and City guidelines.\n\n      C. Sorting Under the Prior 2008 Contract.\n\n      The Vendor’s responsibility and authority to sort images was first\n\nestablished in the 2008 Contract, where the Vendor’s authority to review images\n\nwas stated in a broad manner:\n\n      The vendor shall make the initial determination that the image meets\n      the requirements of the Ordinance and this Agreement, and is\n      otherwise sufficient to enable the City [to] meet its burden of\n      demonstrating a violation of the Ordinance. If the Vendor determines\n      that the standards are not met, the image shall not be processed any\n      further.\n\nAs discussed below, it is this 2008 Contract language that was quoted, analyzed,\n\nand relied upon by the Fourth District in the Arem decision cited by Jimenez.\n\nWhen this 2008 Contract was signed, no statute authorized local governments to\n\nenforce red lights with cameras.1 On July 19, 2010, immediately after the effective\n\ndate of the Wandall Act, the City and the Vendor amended the 2008 Contract and\n\nremoved this language.\n\n      D. Sorting Under the Current Amended Contract.\n\n\n\n\n1 The Florida Supreme Court subsequently held that local governments required\nstatutory authorization to use automatic cameras to enforce red light laws. Masone\nv. City of Aventura, 147 So. 3d 492 (Fla. 2014). While the Masone case was\npending, the Legislature enacted the Wandall Act.\n\n                                         7\n\f      Among other things, the 2010 amendment expressly deleted the language\n\nfrom the 2008 Contract quoted above. Importantly, the deleted language was\n\nreplaced with new language substantially narrowing the nature and scope of the\n\nVendor’s role in the process. The Amended Contract reads:\n\n      Vendor shall act as City’s agent for the limited purpose of making an\n      initial determination of whether the recorded images should be\n      forwarded to an Authorized Employee to determine whether an\n      infraction has occurred and shall not forward for processing those\n      recorded images that clearly fail to establish the occurrence of an\n      infraction.\n(emphasis added).\n\n      Significantly, the Amended Contract also expressly recognized that the\n\nVendor had no authority to decide that a citation would issue. Instead, it provided\n\nthat the decision to issue a citation can be made only by a police officer. The\n\nAmended Contract states:\n\n       VENDOR HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT\n       THE DECISION TO ISSUE A NOTICE OF VIOLATION SHALL\n       BE THE SOLE, UNILATERAL AND EXCLUSIVE DECISION\n       OF THE AUTHORIZED EMPLOYEE AND SHALL BE MADE\n       IN SUCH AUTHORIZED EMPLOYEE’S SOLE DISCRETION (A\n       “NOTICE OF VIOLATION DECISION”), AND IN NO EVENT\n       SHALL VENDOR HAVE THE ABILITY OR AUTHORIZATION\n       TO MAKE A NOTICE OF VIOLATION DECISION.\n      E. Creation of City’s Standards for Sorting Images.\n\n      Central to the issue of unfettered discretion in this case are certain\n\nguidelines, which the City and Vendor call the “Business Rules Questionnaire.”\n\n\n\n                                        8\n\fThe guidelines govern the Vendor’s task of checking the “A” and “B” shots and\n\nthe video clip. The guidelines were created by a process in which the Vendor\n\nidentified scenarios or decision points and suggested alternative solutions to the\n\nCity. For the most part, the City selected one of the alternative solutions suggested\n\nby the Vendor, but in several instances, the City created its own solutions.\n\n      For example, guideline 4.1 concerns the line of demarcation, which means\n\nthe boundary of the intersection. This is the line used to evaluate the “A” shot,\n\nwhich is the photograph that shows the vehicle approaching the intersection. In\n\nreviewing this guideline, one must keep in mind that if the front tires of a vehicle\n\ncrossed the boundary and entered the intersection when the light is still displaying\n\ngreen, the vehicle obviously is not running a red light. Conversely, if the front tires\n\nhad not yet reached this line when the light displays red, the vehicle would appear\n\nto be running a red light (assuming the vehicle does not immediately stop within\n\nthe edge of the intersection and wait for a green light). All of the City intersections\n\ncontaining red light cameras have painted stop lines. The Vendor provided four\n\nalternative suggestions for the line of demarcation: (1) the stop line; (2) the\n\nprolongation of the curb; (3) the crosswalk; and (4) whichever line the tires will hit\n\nfirst. The City adopted the first suggestion: the line of demarcation is the painted\n\nstop line. A similar process was followed for the other guidelines.\n\n      F. Police Decision to Issue Citation.\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\f      The police officers assigned to red light camera enforcement access the\n\nworking database by logging into the server using their own unique user\n\nidentification and password. The officers decide to issue a citation based on the\n\nimages in the same manner they decide to issue a roadside citation. If, after\n\nreviewing the photographs, video, and other information, the officer decides to\n\nissue a citation, the officer clicks the “accept” button on the screen. By doing so,\n\nthe officer authorizes his or her electronic signature and badge number to appear\n\non the notice and citation. The officer’s review and determination in this regard is\n\nfar from a mere rubber stamp. As the trial court expressly found, “[o]f the images\n\nreviewed by the City’s police officers, only between sixty-five percent (65%) and\n\nseventy percent (70%) are approved as a violation.”\n\n      G. Probable Cause in Jimenez’s case.\n\n      An example of the nature and extent of the police officer’s review is\n\nprovided by the issuance of Jimenez’s citation for turning right on red at an\n\nintersection marked no-turns-on-red. Jimenez’s ticket was issued by Officer\n\nJeanette Castro, a thirteen-year veteran of the City Police Department who has\n\nissued thousands of traffic citations roadside, and hundreds as part of the red light\n\ncamera program. Her badge number and electronic signature appear on the notice\n\nand citation. Officer Castro explained her thought process in deciding why\n\nprobable cause was demonstrated by the images in Jimenez’s case:\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\f      Q.    Can we see the video again and walk us through what\nyou see as you watch the video?\n\n       OFFICER CASTRO:          You see again the vehicle approaches\nthe right turn. At this point, the light is—like I stated, it’s already\nbeen red for 5.7 seconds. He proceeds to—the vehicle proceeds to\nmake a right-hand turn, and that oncoming traffic is moving.\n\n     Q.    Was that the same video that you watched when you\nmade your probable cause determination in this case?\n\n      OFFICER CASTRO:           Yes.\n\n      Q.    Again, you determined that there was probable cause\nthat Mr. Jimenez had committed a red light infraction?\n\n      OFFICER CASTRO:           Yes.\n\n      Q.    Did anyone else make that determination?\n\n      OFFICER CASTRO:           No.\n\n      Q.    Can you describe again the factors that you\nconsidered in making that determination?\n\n       OFFICER CASTRO:          The fact that the light was indeed red,\nthat it was a no turn on red intersection, that the vehicle proceeds to\nmake the right-hand turn through the intersection while the light is\nred.\n\n      Q.    You considered that to be a violation of the red light\nstatutes?\n\n      OFFICER CASTRO:           Yes, I do.\n\n       Q.   You made that determination as a law enforcement\nofficer based on your interpretation of those red light statutes?\n\n      OFFICER CASTRO:           Yes.\n\n\n\n                                  11\n\f      Officer Castro testified that her decision to issue a citation to Jimenez was\n\nbased on the same factors and criteria she uses when she issues a citation for a\n\nsimilar roadside violation.\n\n      H. Vendor’s Involvement in Printing, Mailing, and Processing Notices\n         and Citations.\n\n      The record reflects the Vendor plays an important role in administering the\n\nprinting, mailing, and electronic delivery of the notice and citation. The officer\n\nrecords in the City’s computers his or her determination that probable cause exists\n\nand that a notice and citation will issue. That decision is immediately\n\ncommunicated to the Vendor’s computers and triggers a pre-programed, automated\n\nprocess of printing and mailing the notice. If the required payments or affidavits\n\nare not received within the statutory deadlines, the Vendor’s system then\n\nautomatically prints and mails the citation. The Vendor’s system also automatically\n\ndelivers an electronic copy of the citation to the Clerk of the Courts, who creates a\n\ncourt file. The forms of the notice and citation are provided by the City. The\n\ninformation on the notice and citation are approved by the officer when she or he\n\nauthorizes the issuance. Once triggered by the police officer, the officer does not\n\nview the notice or citation again before it is sent out. Also, once triggered by the\n\npolice officer, this process involves no exercise of judgment or discretion on the\n\npart of the Vendor.\n\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\f      I. Trial Court’s Decision and Certification of Questions of Great Public\n         Importance.\n\n      After an evidentiary hearing, the trial court issued an opinion that made\n\nextensive and detailed findings of fact which neither side challenged on appeal.\n\nCiting to Arem, in which the Fourth District dismissed a traffic citation on the\n\ngrounds that a city’s process of using red light cameras gave unfettered discretion\n\nto a vendor, the trial court quashed Jimenez’s traffic citation. The trial court,\n\nhowever, determined that the Vendor’s actions in printing and mailing the notice\n\nand citation to Jimenez, and in delivering an electronic copy of the citation to the\n\nclerk, did not involve unfettered discretion. The trial court certified to this court the\n\nfollowing issues:\n\n      1. Does the review of red light camera images authorized by Florida\n         Statute 316.0083(1)(a) allow a municipality’s vendor, as its agent,\n         to review and then select which images to forward to the law\n         enforcement officer, where the municipality has provided the\n         vendor with specific written guidelines for determining which\n         images to forward or not to forward?\n\n      2. If the vendor is permitted to review and then forward images in\n         accordance with a municipality’s written guidelines, is it an illegal\n         delegation of police power for the vendor to print and mail the\n         [citation], through a totally automated process without human\n         involvement, after the law enforcement officer has affirmatively\n         made a probable cause determination and authorizes the\n         prosecution of the violation by selecting the “accept” button?\n\n      3. Does the fact that the [citation] data is electronically transmitted to\n         the Clerk of the Court from the vendor’s server via a totally\n         automated process without human involvement violate Florida\n         Statute §316.650(3)(c) when it is the law enforcement officer who\n\n\n                                           13\n\f          affirmatively authorizes the transmission process by selecting the\n          “accept” button?\n\nThe City and the Attorney General appealed. We accepted the questions for review\n\nand therefore have jurisdiction. Art. V, § 6, Fla. Const.; § 34.017(1) & (2), Fla.\n\nStat. (2015).\n\n                                     ANALYSIS\n\n      A. Certified Question Number 1: the Vendor’s Sorting of Images.\n\n      The trial court’s first certified question reads:\n\n      Does the review of red light camera images authorized by Florida\n      Statute 316.0083(1)(a) allow a municipality’s vendor, as its agent, to\n      review and then select which images to forward to the law\n      enforcement officer, where the municipality has provided the vendor\n      with specific written guidelines for determining which images to\n      forward or not to forward?\n\n      In regards to this certified question, Jimenez’s main argument is that the\n\nguidelines allow the Vendor unfettered discretion to place items into the non-\n\nworking database where they are never reviewed by the police for purposes of\n\nissuing citations.2 The starting point for this argument is the language in the\n\n2  Jimenez also argues that the creation of the guidelines reflects unfettered\ndiscretion by the Vendor. The Vendor’s suggestion of a range of options that\nincluded solutions diametrically opposed to one another falls far short of\nestablishing as a matter of law that the Vendor exercised unfettered discretion in\nthe creation of the standards. In fact, in at least two guidelines (4.3 and 4.4), the\nCity added requirements to the guidelines without Vendor input. There is nothing\nillegal in government obtaining input from private parties in these circumstances.\nSee generally, Walker v. Trump, 549 So. 2d 1098, 1102 (Fla. 4th DCA 1989)\n(“[T]he supreme court has held that there is no prohibition on the use of outside\nappraisers to assist the property appraiser in fulfilling her function, since such\n\n                                          14\n\fWandall Act authorizing the City to use “agents” to “review” the information\n\ngenerated by the red light traffic program “before issuance of the traffic citation by\n\nthe traffic infraction enforcement officer.” § 316.0083(1)(a), Fla. Stat.\n\n      In his brief, Jimenez acknowledged that “it makes perfect sense for the\n\nLegislature to have allowed the private entity to ‘review’ this evidence [generated\n\nby the red light camera program] to ensure that it is usable.” Jimenez therefore\n\nessentially conceded that the term “review” as used in the statutes, connotes not\n\njust viewing, but also some modicum of assessment. To be sure, it is hard to deny\n\nthat the legal term “review” indicates some level of evaluation: the Florida\n\nConstitution, after all, uses the term “review” when establishing the jurisdiction of\n\nthe Supreme Court and district courts. Art. V, §§ 3(b) & 4(b).\n\n      Nevertheless, behind the statutory term “review” is the principle of law that\n\na city’s legislative body cannot delegate its legislative function by investing\n\nunbridled discretion in an administrative agency, government official, or private\n\nparty. See, e.g, Arem, 154 So. 3d 359; Cty. of Volusia v. City of Deltona, 925 So.\n\n2d 340, 345 (Fla. 5th DCA 2006); City of Belleview v. Belleview Fire Fighters,\n\nInc., 367 So. 2d 1086, 1088 (Fla. 1st DCA 1979); Amara v. Town of Daytona\n\nBeach Shores, 181 So. 2d 722, 724 (Fla. 1st DCA 1966) (“Licensing ordinances\n\nmust prescribe definite rules and conditions which the applicant shall meet and\n\nappraisals produced by outside firms are not binding upon the property appraiser\nbut may serve as a guide.”).\n\n                                          15\n\fmay not leave the determination of the applicant’s fitness or suitability to the\n\nundirected and uncontrolled discretion of even the licensing authority.”).\n\n      At the same time, a government entity can outsource services and use private\n\nvendors, provided the essential decisions regarding the exercise of government\n\npower are retained by the government or controlled by that body through the\n\npromulgation of standards that prevent the private party from having unfettered\n\ndiscretion in the exercise of governmental power. See St. Johns Cty. v. N.E. Fla.\n\nBuilders Ass’n, Inc., 583 So. 2d 635, 642 (Fla. 1991) (upholding a county impact\n\nfee for school infrastructure that authorized the School Board to spend the fees\n\ncollected “because the fundamental policy decisions have been made by the\n\ncounty, and the discretion of the school board has been sufficiently limited”); Cty.\n\nCollection Servs., Inc. v. Charnock, 789 So. 2d 1109, 1112 (Fla. 4th DCA 2001)\n\n(upholding a contract in which a county hired a private entity to collect code\n\nenforcement liens because the private entity was not given unfettered discretion).\n\nSee generally Citizens of State of Fla. v. Wilson, 567 So. 2d 889, 892 (Fla. 1990)\n\n(upholding a delegation of the authority to grant a rate increase to its staff because\n\n“[t]he Commission specified the conditions for approval, and the staff merely\n\ncarried out the ministerial task of seeing whether these conditions were met”).\n\n      The question thus becomes whether the Vendor’s review in this case\n\ninvolves the exercise of unfettered discretion. We hold that it does not. The record\n\n\n\n                                         16\n\freflects that the type of evaluation exercised in the Vendor’s decisions is clerical\n\nand ministerial. When sorting images into the working and non-working databases,\n\nthe Vendor separates the images that are usable because they contain certain easy-\n\nto-ascertain information, from those that are not usable because they fail to contain\n\nthat information. For example, the Vendor exercises no unfettered discretion when\n\nit determines the camera misfired, the traffic light in the image displays green, or\n\nthe vehicle license plate number in the image is illegible.\n\n      Nor is unfettered discretion involved when the Vendor sorts images under\n\nthe main guideline, guideline 4.1.3 This guideline requires the Vendor to identify\n\nimages in which the vehicle’s front tires are behind (have not reached) the painted\n\nstop line and the light displays red. Whether a photograph shows that the front tires\n\nhave reached a line painted on the pavement is a purely ministerial observation. In\n\nthe overwhelming majority of the cases, the answer is a simple yes or no. In the\n\nfew instances where there might be a close call, for example, where the front tires\n\nare barely touching, on, or over the painted line, guideline 4.2 further eliminates\n\nany discretion by directing that those images must always be placed in the working\n\ndatabase for police review. Moreover, this guideline, like the others, is interpreted\n\n3 We note that although Jimenez’s violation squarely falls under guideline 4.5,\nwhich deals with right turns on red at intersections marked no-turns-on-red by\ngiving the address of those intersections, he challenges the validity of the City’s\nentire red light camera program and all guidelines. As no party raised the issue of\nwhether Jimenez has standing to challenge the other guidelines, we do not address\nthis issue.\n\n                                          17\n\funder the principle, “when in doubt, send it out.” In other words, if there is any\n\ndoubt, the Vendor will send it to the police for review. We find no unfettered\n\ndiscretion in the Vendor’s sorting in this regard.\n\n      Similarly, it is hard to imagine a more ministerial act than deciding whether\n\na traffic light in a photograph is displaying red. Determining whether a picture of a\n\ntraffic light shows red involves no discretionary judgment. The answer is either\n\nyes, the traffic light in the photograph is displaying red, or no, the traffic light in\n\nthe image is not displaying red. In the few instances where there might be close\n\ncalls, involving traffic lights with strobes or incandescent bulbs, guidelines 4.6 and\n\n4.7 require those events always to be placed in the working database for police\n\nreview. Again, the Vendor’s decision involves no exercise of unfettered discretion.\n\n      Guideline 4.4 governing right turns on red also directs the Vendor to sort\n\ninto the working database for police review images demonstrating the following\n\nevents: (1) traffic light displays red; (2) vehicle turns right without stopping; and\n\n(3) speed over 15 mph. Determining speed involves no judgment because the\n\nVendor merely documents the figure recorded on a sensor in the pavement. The\n\ntask of following these bright-line instructions involves no unfettered discretion.\n\n      Jimenez contends that unfettered discretion is involved in guideline 4.3,\n\nwhich concerns the “B” shot for vehicles allegedly running a red light while\n\nturning left and towing a trailer. The first part of guideline 4.3 is straightforward.\n\n\n\n                                          18\n\fThe City directs the Vendor to place into the working database only events where\n\nthe “B” shot shows the entire vehicle crossed the painted stop line. That decision\n\ninvolves no unfettered discretion.\n\n      But the City also created an exception for vehicles pulling trailers. In this\n\nsituation, even if the “B” shot does not show the entire trailer over the painted stop\n\nline, the City directed the Vendor to process the plates (which means obtain\n\nidentification from the Department of Motor Vehicles) and place the event in the\n\nworking database for police review “if the video supports violation.” Taken out of\n\ncontext, this language might appear to give the Vendor the authority to decide\n\nwhether a violation occurred. Understood in context, however, this language does\n\nno such thing. A supervisor of the Vendor testified that this language means that\n\nthe event is to be placed in the working database, if the video shows the entire\n\nvehicle, including the trailer, crosses the painted line on the pavement and\n\nproceeds through the intersection. We find no unfettered discretion in an\n\nevaluation of a video to determine if such an easily observable event occurred.\n\n      Jimenez also contends unfettered discretion is involved in guideline 4.7,\n\nwhich concerns vehicles running the red light and turning left in the circumstances\n\nwhere no video clip exists. This guideline requires the Vendor to place the event in\n\nthe working database “if the A-shot and the B-shot provide sufficient evidence of\n\nthe violation.” Again, taken out of context, this language might appear to give the\n\n\n\n                                         19\n\fVendor the authority to decide whether a violation occurred. Understood in\n\ncontext, however, this language does not do so. The sergeant in charge of City’s\n\nprogram testified that “sufficient evidence of a violation” refers to whether\n\nguidelines 4.1 and 4.2 are met. He testified this means “the A-shot was before the\n\nstop bar and in the B-shot is already passed through the intersection.” The\n\ndetermination whether the images reflect these characteristics involves no\n\ndiscretion. Moreover, the sergeant testified that he had never encountered a\n\nsituation where this exception would apply because he had never seen an event\n\nwhere the video failed.\n\n      Nine of the remaining guidelines concern certain easy-to-recognize\n\nscenarios, for example, events involving police, fire, emergency, and municipal\n\nvehicles. The guidelines direct the Vendor to always sort these images into the\n\nworking database for police review. Clearly, there is no unfettered discretion in\n\nguidelines that require the Vendor to always sort these scenarios into the working\n\ndatabase.\n\n      Moreover, a representative of the Vendor involved in applying these\n\nguidelines testified that the Vendor’s employees do not exercise discretion. They\n\nsimply follow the instructions as established by the guidelines. They are taught\n\n“when in doubt, send it out,” meaning if there is any question, they put the images\n\nin the working database for the police to review and decide. Regarding any near or\n\n\n\n                                        20\n\fclose calls, the representative testified, “We don’t make those determinations.\n\nWe’re just going to send it to the police.” Similarly, any images involving\n\nsituations not addressed by the guidelines are always put in the working database\n\nfor police review.\n\n      Not only do the bright-line standards promulgated by the City ensure the\n\nVendor’s tasks regarding images are purely ministerial and non-discretionary in\n\nnature, but the record reflects that no notice or citation is issued unless and until an\n\nindividual officer of the City weighs the evidence in the images and determines in\n\nhis or her professional judgment that probable cause exists. The officers make\n\nthese decisions in the same manner they decide to issue a roadside citation.\n\n      The police officers assigned to red light camera enforcement access the\n\nworking data base by logging into the server using their own unique user\n\nidentification and password. If, after reviewing the photographs, video, and other\n\ninformation, the officer decides to issue a citation, the officer clicks the “accept”\n\nbutton on the screen. By doing so, the officer authorizes his or her electronic\n\nsignature and badge number to appear on the notice and citation. The officer’s\n\nreview and determination in this regard are far from a mere rubber stamp. As the\n\ntrial court expressly found, “[o]f the images reviewed by the City’s police officers,\n\nonly between sixty-five percent (65%) and seventy percent (70%) are approved as\n\na violation.” Officer Castro’s testimony of the manner in which she evaluated\n\n\n\n                                          21\n\fJimenez’s video and found probable cause dovetailed precisely with the other\n\nevidence presented in this regard.\n\n      In making his arguments, Jimenez places primary reliance on the Fourth\n\nDistrict’s decision in Arem. In Arem, the court announced the principle of law that\n\na city’s red light program violates the statutory provision that allows the city to use\n\n“agents” to “review” the information generated by the red light traffic program\n\n“before issuance of the traffic citation by the traffic infraction enforcement officer”\n\nif the vendor is given unfettered discretion to determine who will receive citations.\n\n154 So. 3d at 364-65. We agree with the Fourth District’s statement of the\n\ncontrolling principle of law.\n\n      In Arem, the Fourth District applied this principle to quash a citation issued\n\nby the City of Hollywood expressly because, under the facts of that case, the\n\nVendor was given such unfettered discretion. While the vendor in Arem was the\n\nsame one involved in the instant case, any similarity between the facts of the two\n\ncases ends there. In particular, Arem is distinguished from the instant case because\n\nthere was a different contract, there were no standards or guidelines promulgated\n\nby the municipality, the Vendor determined probable cause, and the City officer\n\nmerely acquiesced in the Vendor’s determination.\n\n      Different Contract. The contract in Arem gave the Vendor broad discretion\n\nto “make the initial determination that the image meets the requirements of the\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\fOrdinance and this Agreement.” Id. at 365. The court in Arem expressly relied\n\nupon this contract language when it held the Vendor was making decisions “in its\n\nsole discretion.” Id. In fact, the ultimate holding in Arem is that the “process set\n\nforth in the contract between the City and [the Vendor] does not comply with\n\nFlorida Statutes.” Id.\n\n      In contrast, unlike the contract language analyzed in Arem, the governing\n\ncontract here strictly limits the Vendor only to “an initial determination of whether\n\nthe recorded images should be forwarded to an Authorized Employee to determine\n\nwhether an infraction has occurred.” The contract in this case expressly provides\n\nthat the police officer, and only the police officer, determines probable cause:\n\n      THE DECISION TO ISSUE A NOTICE OF VIOLATION SHALL\n      BE THE SOLE, UNILATERAL AND EXCLUSIVE DECISION OF\n      THE AUTHORIZED EMPLOYEE AND SHALL BE MADE IN\n      SUCH AUTHORIZED EMPLOYEE’S SOLE DISCRETION (A\n      “NOTICE OF VIOLATION DECISION”), AND IN NO EVENT\n      SHALL VENDOR HAVE THE ABILITY OR AUTHORIZATION\n      TO MAKE A NOTICE OF VIOLATION DECISION.\n\n      No Standards. In the Fourth District’s Arem opinion, there is a total\n\nabsence of any consideration of guidelines promulgated by the City. In contrast,\n\nthe record in this case includes guidelines and extensive testimony regarding how\n\nthe specific City-established guidelines cabin the Vendor’s tasks and limit the\n\nVendor to purely ministerial, non-discretionary decisions.\n\n\n\n\n                                         23\n\f      Vendor’s Sole Discretion. According to the Fourth District’s opinion, the\n\nfacts in Arem reflected that “the vendor unilaterally determines in its own\n\ndiscretion that either a violation did not occur or that the City would not be able to\n\nsustain its burden of proof.” Id. at 365 n.2. The Fourth District repeatedly noted\n\nthat, in the record before it, the Vendor not only had the authority to make the\n\ndecision whether a violation occurred but that the Vendor had the authority to do\n\nso “unilaterally,” based on “unfettered discretion,” “its own discretion,” and “in its\n\nsole discretion.” Id. at 365.\n\n      In contrast, in the instant case, the Vendor was prohibited from deciding\n\nwhether a violation had occurred. Instead, the Vendor here was limited to\n\nidentifying whether the image contained specific and easy-to-identify features,\n\nsuch as a red traffic light and front tires behind (meaning not having reached) a\n\npainted line on the pavement, or whether a video shows that a vehicle pulling a\n\ntrailer had traveled through the intersection. Moreover, the Vendor in this case\n\noperated under a protocol to sort into the working database any scenarios that were\n\nunclear (“when in doubt, send it out”) and any scenarios not expressly addressed in\n\nthe guidelines. Thus, unlike the Vendor’s decisions in Arem which involved\n\n“unfettered discretion” to decide whether a violation occurred, the Vendor’s\n\ndecisions here were ministerial and non-discretionary. As the trial court found, “the\n\n\n\n\n                                         24\n\fsole, unilateral, and unfettered decision making found unacceptable in Arem does\n\nnot exist in this case.”\n\n       Officer “Merely Acquiesces.” Most importantly, in Arem, the police\n\nofficer did not conduct an independent review of whether probable cause existed to\n\nissue a citation. Instead, as the Fourth District expressly determined, the officer\n\n“merely acquiesces in the vendor’s decision to issue the citation.” Id. at 365. In\n\ncontrast, in the instant case, the Vendor has no authority to decide that a citation\n\nwill issue. Only the police officer, whose name and badge number appears on the\n\ncitation, decides if probable cause exists and if a notice and citation issues. This\n\ndecision is reached in the same manner that the police officer decides to issue a\n\nroadside ticket. Unlike the officers in Arem, the officers in the instant case clearly\n\ndo not “merely acquiesce[] in the vendor’s decision to issue a citation.” To the\n\ncontrary, and as the trial court found below, “[o]f the images reviewed by the\n\nCity’s police officers, only between sixty-five percent (65%) and seventy percent\n\n(70%) are approved as a violation.”\n\n       In summary, we agree Arem was properly decided given the record as\n\nreflected in the Arem opinion. Because of the vastly different record in this case,\n\nhowever, we find Arem clearly distinguishable. For all the reasons discussed\n\nabove, we answer the first certified question in the affirmative.\n\n       B. Certified Question Number 2: the Vendor’s Printing and Mailing of\n          Notices and Citations.\n\n                                         25\n\f      The trial court’s second certified question reads:\n\n      If the vendor is permitted to review and then forward images in\n      accordance with a municipality’s written guidelines, is it an illegal\n      delegation of police power for the vendor to print and mail the\n      [citation], through a totally automated process without human\n      involvement, after the law enforcement officer has affirmatively made\n      a probable cause determination and authorizes the prosecution of the\n      violation by selecting the “accept” button?\n\n      Jimenez argues that the statutory language requiring the “issuance” of the\n\nnotice and citation by an “officer” signifies that the officer who makes the probable\n\ncause decision must also print and mail the citation. § 316.0083(1)(a), Fla. Stat.\n\nTaken to its logical extreme, Jimenez’s argument would require the officer to affix\n\nthe stamps, seal the envelopes, and drop the items in the mailbox. The trial court\n\nrejected Jimenez’s argument in this regard. In doing so, it found that, once the\n\nofficer decides the citation will issue, “a fully automated computer program is\n\ntriggered to print and mail the [notice and citation] based on the owner’s failure to\n\nelect any of the options under the time frame contained in the statute. [The Vendor]\n\nonly acts as an electronic apparatus to print and mail [the notice and citation].”\n\n       We agree with the trial court. Jimenez’s argument conflates the non-\n\ndelegable discretionary power to make the decision to issue the citation with the\n\ndelegable clerical and ministerial task of delivering the citation. By way of\n\nanalogy, the Florida Constitution similarly authorizes individual justices of the\n\nFlorida Supreme Court, judges of the district courts, and judges of the circuit\n\n\n                                          26\n\fcourts to “issue” writs of habeas corpus. Art. V, §§ 3(b), 4(b), 5(b). Surely, an\n\notherwise lawful writ would not be rendered unlawful because the issuing jurist did\n\nnot personally print, seal, and mail the envelopes used to deliver the writ. Nor does\n\nthe law require the writ to be delivered by a person under the immediate\n\nsupervision or employ of the judge. See Fla. Bar v. Abreu, 833 So. 2d 752, 753\n\n(Fla. 2002) (noting with approval that the Florida Supreme Court’s order to show\n\ncause was served by a private process server). Likewise, we see nothing in the\n\nstatutory language mandating that a sworn police officer, with years of specialized\n\nlaw enforcement training, must perform or directly supervise such clerical tasks.\n\n      Thus, we answer the second certified question in the negative. The statutory\n\nlanguage providing that only an officer can issue a citation means that only an\n\nofficer can make the discretionary decision that probable cause exists and the\n\ncitation issues. Once that discretionary decision is made, nothing in the statutory\n\nlanguage prohibits the police from delegating the clerical and ministerial task of\n\ndelivering the notice and citation to administrative staff, independent contractors,\n\nor private vendors. See, e.g., Abreu, 833 So. 2d at 753.\n\n      C. Certified Question Number 3: Use of the Vendor’s Server to Provide\n         an Electronic Copy to the Clerk.\n\n      The third question certified by the trial court reads as follows:\n\n      Does the fact that the [citation] data is electronically transmitted to the\n      Clerk of the Court from the vendor’s server via a totally automated\n      process without human involvement violate Florida Statute\n\n                                          27\n\f      §316.650(3)(c) when it is the law enforcement officer who\n      affirmatively authorizes the transmission process by selecting the\n      “accept” button?\n\n      Jimenez contends that the language in the controlling statute stating that the\n\n“officer shall provide by electronic transmission a replica of the traffic citation date\n\nto the court having jurisdiction” means that the officer cannot use the clerical and\n\nministerial services of the Vendor to provide the electronic copy to the Court. The\n\ntrial court rejected this argument: “This Court finds that the process by which red\n\nlight camera E-citations are transmitted is no different than how other E-citations\n\nare transmitted when an officer issues the [citation] roadside . . . therefore, the fact\n\nthat the computer program that actually sends the data is that of a vendor does not\n\nviolate the statute.” Again, we agree with the trial court.\n\n      We see nothing in the statutory language indicating any legislative intent to\n\nbar law enforcement from using third-party software and servers to accomplish\n\nthese ministerial and clerical tasks. See generally Frazier v. State, 180 So. 3d 1067\n\n(Fla. 5th DCA 2015) (recognizing the legality of the police making use of third\n\nparty vendor software to aggregate public information when the same task could\n\notherwise be performed manually by law enforcement, albeit at a slower and less\n\nefficient pace). To read such a requirement into the statute, where it does not exist,\n\nwould serve only to waste limited law enforcement resources and taxpayer dollars.\n\nWe therefore answer the question in the negative.\n\n\n\n                                          28\n\f          CERTIFICATION OF GREAT PUBLIC IMPORTANCE\n\n      Because the lawful use of cameras to enforce red lights has attracted the\n\nattention of the public, local governments, and the Legislature, we certify the\n\nfollowing issues, which we have answered in this opinion, pursuant to Article V,\n\nsection 3(b)(4) of the Florida Constitution as having great public importance:\n\n      1. Does the review of red light camera images authorized by section\n         316.0083(1)(a), Florida Statutes (2014), allow a municipality’s\n         vendor, as its agent, to sort images to forward to the law\n         enforcement officer, where the controlling contract and City\n         guidelines limit the Vendor to deciding whether the images contain\n         certain easy-to-identify characteristics and where only the law\n         enforcement officer makes the determinations whether probable\n         cause exists and whether to issue a notice of violation and citation?\n\n      2. Is it an illegal delegation of police power for the vendor to print\n         and mail the notices and citation, through a totally automated\n         process without human involvement, after the law enforcement\n         officer makes the determinations that probable cause exists and to\n         issue a notice of violation and citation?\n\n      3. Does the fact that the citation data is electronically transmitted to\n         the Clerk of the Court from the vendor’s server via a totally\n         automated process without human involvement violate section\n         316.650(3)(c), Florida Statutes (2014), when it is the law\n         enforcement officer who affirmatively authorizes the transmission\n         process?\n\n      Affirmed in part; reversed in part; questions of great public importance\n\ncertified; and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n      EMAS, J., concurs.\n\n\n\n\n                                        29\n\f                       State of Florida, by and through the City of Aventura, et. al.,\n                                                             v. Luis Torres Jimenez\n                                               Case Nos. 3D15-2303 & 3D15-2271\n\n\nWELLS, Judge, (specially concurring).\n      I agree with the majority that the first of the three certified questions must be\n\nanswered in the affirmative and the remaining two questions must be answered in\n\nthe negative. I do so for the following reasons.\n\n      First, section 316.0083 of the Florida Statutes authorizes, and provides basic\n\nprocedures for local governments to utilize automated devices, that is, computer\n\noperated cameras, to enforce laws regulating conduct at traffic lights.         See §\n\n316.0083, Fla. Stat. (2010) (authorizing use of cameras to enforce traffic light\n\nviolations; providing for notice of violations to be sent to vehicle owners;\n\nproviding for exemptions from liability; providing for challenges to purported\n\nviolations at an administrative hearing; and providing for appeals from adverse\n\nadministrative hearing determinations).       As pertinent here, this law expressly\n\nauthorizes law enforcement agencies responsible for enforcing traffic laws to\n\n                                         30\n\futilize agents to screen images secured by automated devices before issuance of a\n\ntraffic violation citation by a traffic infraction enforcement officer:\n\n             For purposes of administering this section, the department, a\n      county, or a municipality may authorize a traffic infraction\n      enforcement officer under s. 316.640 to issue a traffic citation for a\n      violation of s. 316.074(1) or 316.075(1)(c)1. . . . This paragraph does\n      not prohibit a review of information from a traffic infraction detector\n      by an authorized employee or agent of the department, a county, or a\n      municipality before issuance of the traffic citation by the traffic\n      infraction enforcement officer.\n§ 316.0083(1)(a), Fla. Stat. (2015). 4\n\n      In keeping with this provision, in 2010, Aventura amended its contract with\n\nAmerican Traffic Solutions, Inc., the agent selected to operate Aventura’s\n\ncomputerized red-light camera system.           That contract as amended accorded\n\nAmerican the limited authority to screen images of vehicles taken at designated\n\nintersections in the city:\n\n      [American] shall act as City’s agent for the limited purpose of making\n      an initial determination of whether the recorded images should be\n      forwarded to an authorized [City] employee to determine whether an\n      infraction has occurred and shall not forward for processing those\n\n\n\n4 See also § 316.074(1), Fla. Stat. (2105) (requiring drivers to obey the instructions\nof any official traffic control device unless directed otherwise by a police officer);\n§ 316.075(1), Fla. Stat. (2015) (requiring drivers generally to obey traffic control\ndevices “exhibiting different colored lights”); § 316.640(3), Fla. Stat. (2015)\n(providing for traffic laws to be enforced in municipalities by local police and\nsheriff’s department officers); § 316.640(5)(a), Fla. Stat. (2015) (expressly\nauthorizing municipal law enforcement agencies to employ “any individual who\nsuccessfully completes instruction in traffic enforcement procedures and court\npresentation” to issue citations for traffic law infractions).\n\n                                           31\n\f       recorded images that clearly fail to establish the occurrence of an\n       infraction.\n\nIn conjunction with this agreement, Aventura adopted a number of guidelines\n\npursuant to which American was to screen images as authorized by the\n\nAventura/American contract.\n\n       With regard to the screening of images that might show a vehicle running a\n\nred light for example, the guidelines promulgated by Aventura generally require\n\nAmerican to screen images of vehicles at electronically monitored intersections by\n\nexamining images of vehicles’ tires in relationship to lines demarking an\n\nintersection. Specifically, under Aventura’s guidelines, American screeners are to\n\nexamine still images taken after a traffic light has turned red (“shot A”) which\n\ndepict the position of a vehicle’s front tires. If that image shows a vehicle’s front\n\ntires either on or slightly over the line demarking an intersection, a video clip of\n\nthe same vehicle is examined to confirm that the front tires were either on or\n\nslightly over the demarcation line when the light turned red. If so, American is not\n\nto pass on the images to a traffic infraction enforcement officer as there is no\n\nphotographic support for the conclusion an infraction has occurred. However, if\n\nvideo clip shows that the tires were behind the line when the light turned red, the\n\nimages are to be passed on to a traffic infraction enforcement officer to determine\n\nwhether a traffic infraction had occurred.5\n\n5   This is but one example of the guidelines adopted by Aventura to address\n\n                                         32\n\f      In my opinion, this constitutes no more than the “screening” expressly\n\nauthorized by the law. That is especially so here because the testimony was that\n\nAventura’s traffic infraction enforcement officers do not simply rubber stamp\n\nrecommendations or determinations made by American.           To the contrary, the\n\nrecord is that Aventura’s traffic infraction enforcement officers historically have\n\ndetermined that only sixty-five percent of the images forwarded by American\n\nevidence an infraction warranting issuance of a traffic citation. For this reason\n\nalone, I reject the notion advanced by our sister court in City of Hollywood v.\n\nArem, 154 So. 3d 359 (Fla. 4th DCA 2014), that by allowing a servicing agent to\n\nforward pre-screened images to a traffic infraction enforcement officer that the\n\nservicing agent “[f]or all practical purposes” determines who is subject to\n\nprosecution for a red light violation.\n\n      The record in this case establishes that at most the servicing agent has been\n\naccorded only the ministerial authority to screen and cull those images which,\n\npursuant to a rigid set of guidelines, clearly show no possible violation of the\n\ntraffic laws; it is the traffic infraction officer alone who determines from the\n\npopulation of possible violators, those who will be subject to prosecution. This, in\n\nmy opinion, is neither a violation of the law nor a matter about which those cited\n\nscreening procedures with regard to a number of other potential traffic violations.\nBy way of example only, Aventura has adopted guidelines for screening images of\nlong vehicles and vehicles towing trailers and for screening images of vehicles\nmaking right turns on red.\n\n                                         33\n\ffor a violation have authority to complain. Put another way, the real issue here is\n\nthat some individuals who may have violated traffic regulations may be screened\n\nout of the process because the images of their vehicles were not sent to a traffic\n\ninfraction enforcement officer to determine if a violation has occurred.          This\n\nargument is no different than that made by an individual issued a speeding ticket\n\nwho complains that other speeders also were not ticketed. In short, the fact that\n\nAmerican determines certain images will not be forwarded—i.e., that some drivers\n\nwill not be ticketed—because images taken of their vehicles show that they have\n\nnot exceeded set guidelines, does not amount to determining whether those drivers\n\nwho potentially exceed those guidelines have violated the law. That determination,\n\nas the record before us confirms, is left solely to traffic infraction enforcement\n\nofficers. I therefore agree with the majority that the answer to the first certified\n\nquestion is “yes.”\n\n      I also agree with the majority that in today’s computerized world, the\n\nanswers to the second and third certified questions as to whether it is illegal for\n\nAmerican to print and mail a citation issued by a traffic infraction enforcement\n\nofficer, clearly is “no.” Pursuant to Aventura’s guidelines, after a traffic infraction\n\nenforcement officer receives images from American, the officer independently\n\nreviews the images to determine whether an infraction has occurred. If the officer\n\ndetermines that the image depicts an infraction, the officer electronically indicates\n\n\n\n                                          34\n\fthat he or she accepts that an infraction has occurred and electronically issues the\n\nnotice of infraction by authorizing American to send a notice of violation bearing\n\nthe officer’s badge number and signature. American then uses a form approved by\n\nthe State of Florida. The clerk of the court is also notified electronically by\n\nAmerican or one of its subsidiaries or vendors. As the testimony adduced below\n\nconfirms, this is little different from what happens when an officer issues a\n\nviolation roadside:\n\n            Q. So can you explain how that information is sent\n      electronically, if you know?\n\n             A. It is sent electronically to [the clerk’s office].\n\n            Q. Is that any different than any other electronic citation\n      information that might be sent from roadside?\n\n            A. In the instance when it is sent from my computer roadside,\n      it would go through my station’s server and then to Miami-Dade\n      Clerk of Courts.\n\n            In the instance of these violations they – this officer approves\n      them, the server – [American’s] server in Arizona provides that\n      information to the Miami-Dade Clerk of Courts.\n\n      In my opinion, to conclude that such ministerial acts are unauthorized by\n\nsection 316.0083 would be akin to determining that a trial judge has no authority to\n\ninstruct a judicial assistant to prepare a computerized order which the judge\n\nelectronically signs and issues electronically to the parties and the clerk’s office.\n\nNeedless to say, this court determines and electronically transmits many matters\n\n\n\n                                           35\n\feach day. It is the judges who decide the cases and issue their opinions, however it\n\nis the clerk’s office which electronically sends those decisions on to the\n\nappropriate parties.\n\n      I also find no violation of section 316.0083 when American electronically\n\n“issues” a uniform traffic citation (as expressly authorized by Aventura with\n\nautomatic notification to the court) when the owner of a vehicle fails to respond to\n\na traffic citation as required by law. See § 316.0083(1)(b)1.a., Fla. Stat. (2015)\n\n(providing that “to avoid the issuance of a traffic citation,” a vehicle owner notified\n\nof a violation must either pay a penalty, submit an affidavit, or request a hearing\n\nwithin 60 days of notification as provided in section 316.0083). Again, and at best,\n\nthis is a non-discretionary function which takes no more than a computer program\n\nto perform.\n\n      In conclusion, because I agree that the first certified question as to whether\n\nsection 316.0083 allows a municipality vendor to segregate images for forwarding\n\nto traffic infraction enforcement officers should be answered in the affirmative,\n\nand because I agree that the second and third certified questions about utilizing\n\nautomated processes should be answered in the negative, I agree that the order\n\nentered below must be reversed. I would not, however, certify this matter to the\n\nFlorida Supreme Court as a matter of exceptional importance as I do not believe\n\n\n\n\n                                          36\n\fthis matter is of such import as to warrant further review, but would certify this\n\ndecision as being in express and direct conflict with Arem.\n\n\n\n\n                                        37\n\f",

Stat. (2014); (2) the Vendor had unfettered discretion\n\n\n                                        2\n\fin printing and mailing notices and citations in violation of a statutory requirement\n\nthat only an officer can “issue” citations, id.; and (3) the Vendor had unfettered\n\ndiscretion to send an electronic copy of the citation to the Clerk of Courts in\n\nviolation of the statutory requirement that only an officer “shall provide” an\n\nelectronic copy to the Clerk, section 316.650(3)(c), Fla. Stat. (2014).\n\n      For the reasons explained below, we reject Jimenez’s arguments. In\n\nparticular, we hold that the review of red light camera images authorized by\n\nsection 316.0083(1)(a) allows a municipality’s vendor, as its agent, to review and\n\nsort images to forward to a police officer where, as here, (1) the vendor’s decisions\n\nin this regard are strictly circumscribed by contract language, guidelines\n\npromulgated by the municipality, and actual practices, such that the vendor’s\n\ndecisions are essentially ministerial and non-discretionary; (2) these ministerial\n\ndecisions are further limited by an overarching policy of automatically passing all\n\nclose calls to the police for their review; (3) it is the police officer that makes the\n\nactual decision whether probable cause exists and whether a notice and citation\n\nshould issue; and (4) the officer’s decision that probable cause exists and a citation\n\nissues consists of a full, professional review by an identified officer who is\n\nresponsible for that decision and does not merely acquiesce in any determination\n\nmade by the vendor.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f      Due to these circumstances, we distinguish City of Hollywood v.

Because of the broad public and institutional\n\ninterest in red light cameras, we certify three issues to the Florida Supreme Court\n\nas having great public importance.\n\n                         BACKGROUND AND FACTS\n\n      A. The Mark Wandall Traffic Safety Act.\n\n      On July 1, 2010, the Legislature enacted the Mark Wandall Traffic Safety\n\nAct, which authorized local governments to use cameras to enforce traffic lights.\n\nCh. 2010-80, Laws of Fla., partially codified at § 316.0083, Fla. Stat. (2010). The\n\nWandall Act was named in honor of Mark Wandall, whose wife was nine months\n\npregnant when he was killed by a driver who ran a red light. City of Orlando v.\n\nUdowychenko, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">589</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 596 n.10 (Fla. 5th DCA. 2012). According to the\n\naccompanying committee report, seventy-six people were killed in 2008 in Florida\n\nby drivers running red lights. See House of Representatives Staff Analysis, at p. 2,\n\nCS/CS/HB 325 (Mar. 9, 2010).\n\n      At the heart of the dispute in this case is the Wandall Act’s express\n\nauthorization for local governments to use “agents” to “review” images before the\n\n“officer” issues a citation. On this point, the Wandall Act reads, “[t]his paragraph\n\n\n\n                                         4\n\fdoes not prohibit a review of information from a traffic infraction detector by an\n\nauthorized employee or agent of the department, a county, or a municipality before\n\nissuance of the traffic citation by the traffic infraction enforcement officer.” §\n\n316.0083(1)(a), Fla. Stat.\n\n      B. The Vendor’s Sorting of Images.\n\n      The City and the Vendor entered into a contract whereby the Vendor is\n\nresponsible for installing, maintaining, monitoring, and assisting in administering a\n\n“digital photo red light enforcement system” which includes a network of\n\ncomputers, sensors, speed detectors, timers, cameras, printers, and mailing\n\ncapabilities, all supported by software owned by or licensed to the Vendor.\n\n      Under the contract and its various amendments, the Vendor sorts the\n\ninformation and images generated by the system into two databases: a “working”\n\ndatabase that the City police review to decide whether to issue a citation and a\n\n“non-working” database that the City police do not review for that purpose. Each\n\nimage placed in the non-working database is reported, and the reason for placing\n\nthe image in the non-working database is explained by the Vendor on a report\n\nscreen. The report screen is periodically reviewed by the sergeant in charge of the\n\nCity’s review. The non-working database remains available and is occasionally\n\naccessed by the police for other investigations.\n\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\f      Each month, approximately 5,000 images are sorted into the working\n\ndatabase and 3,000 are sorted into the non-working database. The police sergeant\n\nwho oversees the City’s review testified that the City would be overwhelmed if it\n\nwas required to review all images generated by the system.\n\n      To sort images, the Vendor conducts a review that includes (1) confirming\n\nworkable images exist (and the camera did not simply misfire); (2) examining the\n\nimages to verify the license plate of the subject vehicle is legible; (3) using the\n\nlicense plate number in an automated process to obtain the identifying information\n\nof the registered owner from the Florida Department of Motor Vehicles; (4)\n\nconfirming the capture of date, time-of-day, speed, and timing-of-light data; (5)\n\nchecking the “A” shot, which is a still photograph showing the vehicle approaching\n\nthe intersection; (6) checking the “B” shot, which shows the vehicle in the\n\nintersection; and (7) checking the twelve-second video clip that shows the vehicle\n\napproaching and traveling through the intersection. The Vendor can pause the\n\nvideo and view it frame by frame.\n\n      A representative of the Vendor testified that the Vendor’s task when\n\nreviewing images was to filter out images that were “useless.” A clear example,\n\nshe explained, is where a camera simply misfired and failed to record an image.\n\nOther examples are where the light displays green or where images fail to capture a\n\nvehicle’s license plate number. These images were useless, she testified, because\n\n\n\n                                        6\n\f“the police cannot do anything with them.” But other images are determined to be\n\nuseless based on the specific and detailed contract language and City guidelines.\n\n      C. Sorting Under the Prior 2008 Contract.\n\n      The Vendor’s responsibility and authority to sort images was first\n\nestablished in the 2008 Contract, where the Vendor’s authority to review images\n\nwas stated in a broad manner:\n\n      The vendor shall make the initial determination that the image meets\n      the requirements of the Ordinance and this Agreement, and is\n      otherwise sufficient to enable the City [to] meet its burden of\n      demonstrating a violation of the Ordinance. If the Vendor determines\n      that the standards are not met, the image shall not be processed any\n      further.\n\nAs discussed below, it is this 2008 Contract language that was quoted, analyzed,\n\nand relied upon by the Fourth District in the Arem decision cited by Jimenez.\n\nWhen this 2008 Contract was signed, no statute authorized local governments to\n\nenforce red lights with cameras.1 On July 19, 2010, immediately after the effective\n\ndate of the Wandall Act, the City and the Vendor amended the 2008 Contract and\n\nremoved this language.\n\n      D. Sorting Under the Current Amended Contract.\n\n\n\n\n1 The Florida Supreme Court subsequently held that local governments required\nstatutory authorization to use automatic cameras to enforce red light laws. Masone\nv. City of Aventura, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla. 2014). While the Masone case was\npending, the Legislature enacted the Wandall Act.\n\n                                         7\n\f      Among other things, the 2010 amendment expressly deleted the language\n\nfrom the 2008 Contract quoted above. Importantly, the deleted language was\n\nreplaced with new language substantially narrowing the nature and scope of the\n\nVendor’s role in the process. The Amended Contract reads:\n\n      Vendor shall act as City’s agent for the limited purpose of making an\n      initial determination of whether the recorded images should be\n      forwarded to an Authorized Employee to determine whether an\n      infraction has occurred and shall not forward for processing those\n      recorded images that clearly fail to establish the occurrence of an\n      infraction.\n(emphasis added).\n\n      Significantly, the Amended Contract also expressly recognized that the\n\nVendor had no authority to decide that a citation would issue. Instead, it provided\n\nthat the decision to issue a citation can be made only by a police officer. The\n\nAmended Contract states:\n\n       VENDOR HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT\n       THE DECISION TO ISSUE A NOTICE OF VIOLATION SHALL\n       BE THE SOLE, UNILATERAL AND EXCLUSIVE DECISION\n       OF THE AUTHORIZED EMPLOYEE AND SHALL BE MADE\n       IN SUCH AUTHORIZED EMPLOYEE’S SOLE DISCRETION (A\n       “NOTICE OF VIOLATION DECISION”), AND IN NO EVENT\n       SHALL VENDOR HAVE THE ABILITY OR AUTHORIZATION\n       TO MAKE A NOTICE OF VIOLATION DECISION.\n      E. Creation of City’s Standards for Sorting Images.\n\n      Central to the issue of unfettered discretion in this case are certain\n\nguidelines, which the City and Vendor call the “Business Rules Questionnaire.”\n\n\n\n                                        8\n\fThe guidelines govern the Vendor’s task of checking the “A” and “B” shots and\n\nthe video clip. The guidelines were created by a process in which the Vendor\n\nidentified scenarios or decision points and suggested alternative solutions to the\n\nCity. For the most part, the City selected one of the alternative solutions suggested\n\nby the Vendor, but in several instances, the City created its own solutions.\n\n      For example, guideline 4.1 concerns the line of demarcation, which means\n\nthe boundary of the intersection. This is the line used to evaluate the “A” shot,\n\nwhich is the photograph that shows the vehicle approaching the intersection. In\n\nreviewing this guideline, one must keep in mind that if the front tires of a vehicle\n\ncrossed the boundary and entered the intersection when the light is still displaying\n\ngreen, the vehicle obviously is not running a red light. Conversely, if the front tires\n\nhad not yet reached this line when the light displays red, the vehicle would appear\n\nto be running a red light (assuming the vehicle does not immediately stop within\n\nthe edge of the intersection and wait for a green light). All of the City intersections\n\ncontaining red light cameras have painted stop lines. The Vendor provided four\n\nalternative suggestions for the line of demarcation: (1) the stop line; (2) the\n\nprolongation of the curb; (3) the crosswalk; and (4) whichever line the tires will hit\n\nfirst. The City adopted the first suggestion: the line of demarcation is the painted\n\nstop line. A similar process was followed for the other guidelines.\n\n      F. Police Decision to Issue Citation.\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\f      The police officers assigned to red light camera enforcement access the\n\nworking database by logging into the server using their own unique user\n\nidentification and password. The officers decide to issue a citation based on the\n\nimages in the same manner they decide to issue a roadside citation. If, after\n\nreviewing the photographs, video, and other information, the officer decides to\n\nissue a citation, the officer clicks the “accept” button on the screen. By doing so,\n\nthe officer authorizes his or her electronic signature and badge number to appear\n\non the notice and citation. The officer’s review and determination in this regard is\n\nfar from a mere rubber stamp. As the trial court expressly found, “[o]f the images\n\nreviewed by the City’s police officers, only between sixty-five percent (65%) and\n\nseventy percent (70%) are approved as a violation.”\n\n      G. Probable Cause in Jimenez’s case.\n\n      An example of the nature and extent of the police officer’s review is\n\nprovided by the issuance of Jimenez’s citation for turning right on red at an\n\nintersection marked no-turns-on-red. Jimenez’s ticket was issued by Officer\n\nJeanette Castro, a thirteen-year veteran of the City Police Department who has\n\nissued thousands of traffic citations roadside, and hundreds as part of the red light\n\ncamera program. Her badge number and electronic signature appear on the notice\n\nand citation. Officer Castro explained her thought process in deciding why\n\nprobable cause was demonstrated by the images in Jimenez’s case:\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\f      Q.    Can we see the video again and walk us through what\nyou see as you watch the video?\n\n       OFFICER CASTRO:          You see again the vehicle approaches\nthe right turn. At this point, the light is—like I stated, it’s already\nbeen red for 5.7 seconds. He proceeds to—the vehicle proceeds to\nmake a right-hand turn, and that oncoming traffic is moving.\n\n     Q.    Was that the same video that you watched when you\nmade your probable cause determination in this case?\n\n      OFFICER CASTRO:           Yes.\n\n      Q.    Again, you determined that there was probable cause\nthat Mr. Jimenez had committed a red light infraction?\n\n      OFFICER CASTRO:           Yes.\n\n      Q.    Did anyone else make that determination?\n\n      OFFICER CASTRO:           No.\n\n      Q.    Can you describe again the factors that you\nconsidered in making that determination?\n\n       OFFICER CASTRO:          The fact that the light was indeed red,\nthat it was a no turn on red intersection, that the vehicle proceeds to\nmake the right-hand turn through the intersection while the light is\nred.\n\n      Q.    You considered that to be a violation of the red light\nstatutes?\n\n      OFFICER CASTRO:           Yes, I do.\n\n       Q.   You made that determination as a law enforcement\nofficer based on your interpretation of those red light statutes?\n\n      OFFICER CASTRO:           Yes.\n\n\n\n                                  11\n\f      Officer Castro testified that her decision to issue a citation to Jimenez was\n\nbased on the same factors and criteria she uses when she issues a citation for a\n\nsimilar roadside violation.\n\n      H. Vendor’s Involvement in Printing, Mailing, and Processing Notices\n         and Citations.\n\n      The record reflects the Vendor plays an important role in administering the\n\nprinting, mailing, and electronic delivery of the notice and citation. The officer\n\nrecords in the City’s computers his or her determination that probable cause exists\n\nand that a notice and citation will issue. That decision is immediately\n\ncommunicated to the Vendor’s computers and triggers a pre-programed, automated\n\nprocess of printing and mailing the notice. If the required payments or affidavits\n\nare not received within the statutory deadlines, the Vendor’s system then\n\nautomatically prints and mails the citation. The Vendor’s system also automatically\n\ndelivers an electronic copy of the citation to the Clerk of the Courts, who creates a\n\ncourt file. The forms of the notice and citation are provided by the City. The\n\ninformation on the notice and citation are approved by the officer when she or he\n\nauthorizes the issuance. Once triggered by the police officer, the officer does not\n\nview the notice or citation again before it is sent out. Also, once triggered by the\n\npolice officer, this process involves no exercise of judgment or discretion on the\n\npart of the Vendor.\n\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\f      I. Trial Court’s Decision and Certification of Questions of Great Public\n         Importance.\n\n      After an evidentiary hearing, the trial court issued an opinion that made\n\nextensive and detailed findings of fact which neither side challenged on appeal.\n\nCiting to Arem, in which the Fourth District dismissed a traffic citation on the\n\ngrounds that a city’s process of using red light cameras gave unfettered discretion\n\nto a vendor, the trial court quashed Jimenez’s traffic citation. The trial court,\n\nhowever, determined that the Vendor’s actions in printing and mailing the notice\n\nand citation to Jimenez, and in delivering an electronic copy of the citation to the\n\nclerk, did not involve unfettered discretion. The trial court certified to this court the\n\nfollowing issues:\n\n      1. Does the review of red light camera images authorized by Florida\n         Statute 316.0083(1)(a) allow a municipality’s vendor, as its agent,\n         to review and then select which images to forward to the law\n         enforcement officer, where the municipality has provided the\n         vendor with specific written guidelines for determining which\n         images to forward or not to forward?\n\n      2. If the vendor is permitted to review and then forward images in\n         accordance with a municipality’s written guidelines, is it an illegal\n         delegation of police power for the vendor to print and mail the\n         [citation], through a totally automated process without human\n         involvement, after the law enforcement officer has affirmatively\n         made a probable cause determination and authorizes the\n         prosecution of the violation by selecting the “accept” button?\n\n      3. Does the fact that the [citation] data is electronically transmitted to\n         the Clerk of the Court from the vendor’s server via a totally\n         automated process without human involvement violate Florida\n         Statute §316.650(3)(c) when it is the law enforcement officer who\n\n\n                                           13\n\f          affirmatively authorizes the transmission process by selecting the\n          “accept” button?\n\nThe City and the Attorney General appealed. We accepted the questions for review\n\nand therefore have jurisdiction. Art. V, § 6, Fla. Const.; § 34.017(1) & (2), Fla.\n\nStat. (2015).\n\n                                     ANALYSIS\n\n      A. Certified Question Number 1: the Vendor’s Sorting of Images.\n\n      The trial court’s first certified question reads:\n\n      Does the review of red light camera images authorized by Florida\n      Statute 316.0083(1)(a) allow a municipality’s vendor, as its agent, to\n      review and then select which images to forward to the law\n      enforcement officer, where the municipality has provided the vendor\n      with specific written guidelines for determining which images to\n      forward or not to forward?\n\n      In regards to this certified question, Jimenez’s main argument is that the\n\nguidelines allow the Vendor unfettered discretion to place items into the non-\n\nworking database where they are never reviewed by the police for purposes of\n\nissuing citations.2 The starting point for this argument is the language in the\n\n2  Jimenez also argues that the creation of the guidelines reflects unfettered\ndiscretion by the Vendor. The Vendor’s suggestion of a range of options that\nincluded solutions diametrically opposed to one another falls far short of\nestablishing as a matter of law that the Vendor exercised unfettered discretion in\nthe creation of the standards. In fact, in at least two guidelines (4.3 and 4.4), the\nCity added requirements to the guidelines without Vendor input. There is nothing\nillegal in government obtaining input from private parties in these circumstances.\nSee generally, Walker v. Trump, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1800351\"><a href=\"/opinion/1800351/walker-v-trump/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1098</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1102 (Fla. 4th DCA 1989)\n(“[T]he supreme court has held that there is no prohibition on the use of outside\nappraisers to assist the property appraiser in fulfilling her function, since such\n\n                                          14\n\fWandall Act authorizing the City to use “agents” to “review” the information\n\ngenerated by the red light traffic program “before issuance of the traffic citation by\n\nthe traffic infraction enforcement officer.” § 316.0083(1)(a), Fla. Stat.\n\n      In his brief, Jimenez acknowledged that “it makes perfect sense for the\n\nLegislature to have allowed the private entity to ‘review’ this evidence [generated\n\nby the red light camera program] to ensure that it is usable.” Jimenez therefore\n\nessentially conceded that the term “review” as used in the statutes, connotes not\n\njust viewing, but also some modicum of assessment. To be sure, it is hard to deny\n\nthat the legal term “review” indicates some level of evaluation: the Florida\n\nConstitution, after all, uses the term “review” when establishing the jurisdiction of\n\nthe Supreme Court and district courts. Art. V, §§ 3(b) & 4(b).\n\n      Nevertheless, behind the statutory term “review” is the principle of law that\n\na city’s legislative body cannot delegate its legislative function by investing\n\nunbridled discretion in an administrative agency, government official, or private\n\nparty.

We hold that it does not. The record\n\n\n\n                                         16\n\freflects that the type of evaluation exercised in the Vendor’s decisions is clerical\n\nand ministerial. When sorting images into the working and non-working databases,\n\nthe Vendor separates the images that are usable because they contain certain easy-\n\nto-ascertain information, from those that are not usable because they fail to contain\n\nthat information. For example, the Vendor exercises no unfettered discretion when\n\nit determines the camera misfired, the traffic light in the image displays green, or\n\nthe vehicle license plate number in the image is illegible.\n\n      Nor is unfettered discretion involved when the Vendor sorts images under\n\nthe main guideline, guideline 4.1.3 This guideline requires the Vendor to identify\n\nimages in which the vehicle’s front tires are behind (have not reached) the painted\n\nstop line and the light displays red. Whether a photograph shows that the front tires\n\nhave reached a line painted on the pavement is a purely ministerial observation. In\n\nthe overwhelming majority of the cases, the answer is a simple yes or no. In the\n\nfew instances where there might be a close call, for example, where the front tires\n\nare barely touching, on, or over the painted line, guideline 4.2 further eliminates\n\nany discretion by directing that those images must always be placed in the working\n\ndatabase for police review. Moreover, this guideline, like the others, is interpreted\n\n3 We note that although Jimenez’s violation squarely falls under guideline 4.5,\nwhich deals with right turns on red at intersections marked no-turns-on-red by\ngiving the address of those intersections, he challenges the validity of the City’s\nentire red light camera program and all guidelines. As no party raised the issue of\nwhether Jimenez has standing to challenge the other guidelines, we do not address\nthis issue.\n\n                                          17\n\funder the principle, “when in doubt, send it out.” In other words, if there is any\n\ndoubt, the Vendor will send it to the police for review. We find no unfettered\n\ndiscretion in the Vendor’s sorting in this regard.\n\n      Similarly, it is hard to imagine a more ministerial act than deciding whether\n\na traffic light in a photograph is displaying red. Determining whether a picture of a\n\ntraffic light shows red involves no discretionary judgment. The answer is either\n\nyes, the traffic light in the photograph is displaying red, or no, the traffic light in\n\nthe image is not displaying red. In the few instances where there might be close\n\ncalls, involving traffic lights with strobes or incandescent bulbs, guidelines 4.6 and\n\n4.7 require those events always to be placed in the working database for police\n\nreview. Again, the Vendor’s decision involves no exercise of unfettered discretion.\n\n      Guideline 4.4 governing right turns on red also directs the Vendor to sort\n\ninto the working database for police review images demonstrating the following\n\nevents: (1) traffic light displays red; (2) vehicle turns right without stopping; and\n\n(3) speed over 15 mph. Determining speed involves no judgment because the\n\nVendor merely documents the figure recorded on a sensor in the pavement. The\n\ntask of following these bright-line instructions involves no unfettered discretion.\n\n      Jimenez contends that unfettered discretion is involved in guideline 4.3,\n\nwhich concerns the “B” shot for vehicles allegedly running a red light while\n\nturning left and towing a trailer. The first part of guideline 4.3 is straightforward.\n\n\n\n                                          18\n\fThe City directs the Vendor to place into the working database only events where\n\nthe “B” shot shows the entire vehicle crossed the painted stop line. That decision\n\ninvolves no unfettered discretion.\n\n      But the City also created an exception for vehicles pulling trailers. In this\n\nsituation, even if the “B” shot does not show the entire trailer over the painted stop\n\nline, the City directed the Vendor to process the plates (which means obtain\n\nidentification from the Department of Motor Vehicles) and place the event in the\n\nworking database for police review “if the video supports violation.” Taken out of\n\ncontext, this language might appear to give the Vendor the authority to decide\n\nwhether a violation occurred. Understood in context, however, this language does\n\nno such thing. A supervisor of the Vendor testified that this language means that\n\nthe event is to be placed in the working database, if the video shows the entire\n\nvehicle, including the trailer, crosses the painted line on the pavement and\n\nproceeds through the intersection. We find no unfettered discretion in an\n\nevaluation of a video to determine if such an easily observable event occurred.\n\n      Jimenez also contends unfettered discretion is involved in guideline 4.7,\n\nwhich concerns vehicles running the red light and turning left in the circumstances\n\nwhere no video clip exists. This guideline requires the Vendor to place the event in\n\nthe working database “if the A-shot and the B-shot provide sufficient evidence of\n\nthe violation.” Again, taken out of context, this language might appear to give the\n\n\n\n                                         19\n\fVendor the authority to decide whether a violation occurred. Understood in\n\ncontext, however, this language does not do so. The sergeant in charge of City’s\n\nprogram testified that “sufficient evidence of a violation” refers to whether\n\nguidelines 4.1 and 4.2 are met. He testified this means “the A-shot was before the\n\nstop bar and in the B-shot is already passed through the intersection.” The\n\ndetermination whether the images reflect these characteristics involves no\n\ndiscretion. Moreover, the sergeant testified that he had never encountered a\n\nsituation where this exception would apply because he had never seen an event\n\nwhere the video failed.\n\n      Nine of the remaining guidelines concern certain easy-to-recognize\n\nscenarios, for example, events involving police, fire, emergency, and municipal\n\nvehicles. The guidelines direct the Vendor to always sort these images into the\n\nworking database for police review. Clearly, there is no unfettered discretion in\n\nguidelines that require the Vendor to always sort these scenarios into the working\n\ndatabase.\n\n      Moreover, a representative of the Vendor involved in applying these\n\nguidelines testified that the Vendor’s employees do not exercise discretion. They\n\nsimply follow the instructions as established by the guidelines. They are taught\n\n“when in doubt, send it out,” meaning if there is any question, they put the images\n\nin the working database for the police to review and decide. Regarding any near or\n\n\n\n                                        20\n\fclose calls, the representative testified, “We don’t make those determinations.\n\nWe’re just going to send it to the police.” Similarly, any images involving\n\nsituations not addressed by the guidelines are always put in the working database\n\nfor police review.\n\n      Not only do the bright-line standards promulgated by the City ensure the\n\nVendor’s tasks regarding images are purely ministerial and non-discretionary in\n\nnature, but the record reflects that no notice or citation is issued unless and until an\n\nindividual officer of the City weighs the evidence in the images and determines in\n\nhis or her professional judgment that probable cause exists. The officers make\n\nthese decisions in the same manner they decide to issue a roadside citation.\n\n      The police officers assigned to red light camera enforcement access the\n\nworking data base by logging into the server using their own unique user\n\nidentification and password. If, after reviewing the photographs, video, and other\n\ninformation, the officer decides to issue a citation, the officer clicks the “accept”\n\nbutton on the screen. By doing so, the officer authorizes his or her electronic\n\nsignature and badge number to appear on the notice and citation. The officer’s\n\nreview and determination in this regard are far from a mere rubber stamp. As the\n\ntrial court expressly found, “[o]f the images reviewed by the City’s police officers,\n\nonly between sixty-five percent (65%) and seventy percent (70%) are approved as\n\na violation.” Officer Castro’s testimony of the manner in which she evaluated\n\n\n\n                                          21\n\fJimenez’s video and found probable cause dovetailed precisely with the other\n\nevidence presented in this regard.\n\n      In making his arguments, Jimenez places primary reliance on the Fourth\n\nDistrict’s decision in Arem. In Arem, the court announced the principle of law that\n\na city’s red light program violates the statutory provision that allows the city to use\n\n“agents” to “review” the information generated by the red light traffic program\n\n“before issuance of the traffic citation by the traffic infraction enforcement officer”\n\nif the vendor is given unfettered discretion to determine who will receive citations.\n\n154 So. 3d at 364-65. We agree with the Fourth District’s statement of the\n\ncontrolling principle of law.\n\n      In Arem, the Fourth District applied this principle to quash a citation issued\n\nby the City of Hollywood expressly because, under the facts of that case, the\n\nVendor was given such unfettered discretion. While the vendor in Arem was the\n\nsame one involved in the instant case, any similarity between the facts of the two\n\ncases ends there. In particular, Arem is distinguished from the instant case because\n\nthere was a different contract, there were no standards or guidelines promulgated\n\nby the municipality, the Vendor determined probable cause, and the City officer\n\nmerely acquiesced in the Vendor’s determination.\n\n      Different Contract. The contract in Arem gave the Vendor broad discretion\n\nto “make the initial determination that the image meets the requirements of the\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\fOrdinance and this Agreement.” Id. at 365. The court in Arem expressly relied\n\nupon this contract language when it held the Vendor was making decisions “in its\n\nsole discretion.” Id. In fact, the ultimate holding in Arem is that the “process set\n\nforth in the contract between the City and [the Vendor] does not comply with\n\nFlorida Statutes.” Id.\n\n      In contrast, unlike the contract language analyzed in Arem, the governing\n\ncontract here strictly limits the Vendor only to “an initial determination of whether\n\nthe recorded images should be forwarded to an Authorized Employee to determine\n\nwhether an infraction has occurred.” The contract in this case expressly provides\n\nthat the police officer, and only the police officer, determines probable cause:\n\n      THE DECISION TO ISSUE A NOTICE OF VIOLATION SHALL\n      BE THE SOLE, UNILATERAL AND EXCLUSIVE DECISION OF\n      THE AUTHORIZED EMPLOYEE AND SHALL BE MADE IN\n      SUCH AUTHORIZED EMPLOYEE’S SOLE DISCRETION (A\n      “NOTICE OF VIOLATION DECISION”), AND IN NO EVENT\n      SHALL VENDOR HAVE THE ABILITY OR AUTHORIZATION\n      TO MAKE A NOTICE OF VIOLATION DECISION.\n\n      No Standards. In the Fourth District’s Arem opinion, there is a total\n\nabsence of any consideration of guidelines promulgated by the City. In contrast,\n\nthe record in this case includes guidelines and extensive testimony regarding how\n\nthe specific City-established guidelines cabin the Vendor’s tasks and limit the\n\nVendor to purely ministerial, non-discretionary decisions.\n\n\n\n\n                                         23\n\f      Vendor’s Sole Discretion. According to the Fourth District’s opinion, the\n\nfacts in Arem reflected that “the vendor unilaterally determines in its own\n\ndiscretion that either a violation did not occur or that the City would not be able to\n\nsustain its burden of proof.” Id. at 365 n.2. The Fourth District repeatedly noted\n\nthat, in the record before it, the Vendor not only had the authority to make the\n\ndecision whether a violation occurred but that the Vendor had the authority to do\n\nso “unilaterally,” based on “unfettered discretion,” “its own discretion,” and “in its\n\nsole discretion.” Id. at 365.\n\n      In contrast, in the instant case, the Vendor was prohibited from deciding\n\nwhether a violation had occurred. Instead, the Vendor here was limited to\n\nidentifying whether the image contained specific and easy-to-identify features,\n\nsuch as a red traffic light and front tires behind (meaning not having reached) a\n\npainted line on the pavement, or whether a video shows that a vehicle pulling a\n\ntrailer had traveled through the intersection. Moreover, the Vendor in this case\n\noperated under a protocol to sort into the working database any scenarios that were\n\nunclear (“when in doubt, send it out”) and any scenarios not expressly addressed in\n\nthe guidelines. Thus, unlike the Vendor’s decisions in Arem which involved\n\n“unfettered discretion” to decide whether a violation occurred, the Vendor’s\n\ndecisions here were ministerial and non-discretionary. As the trial court found, “the\n\n\n\n\n                                         24\n\fsole, unilateral, and unfettered decision making found unacceptable in Arem does\n\nnot exist in this case.”\n\n       Officer “Merely Acquiesces.” Most importantly, in Arem, the police\n\nofficer did not conduct an independent review of whether probable cause existed to\n\nissue a citation. Instead, as the Fourth District expressly determined, the officer\n\n“merely acquiesces in the vendor’s decision to issue the citation.” Id. at 365. In\n\ncontrast, in the instant case, the Vendor has no authority to decide that a citation\n\nwill issue. Only the police officer, whose name and badge number appears on the\n\ncitation, decides if probable cause exists and if a notice and citation issues. This\n\ndecision is reached in the same manner that the police officer decides to issue a\n\nroadside ticket. Unlike the officers in Arem, the officers in the instant case clearly\n\ndo not “merely acquiesce[] in the vendor’s decision to issue a citation.” To the\n\ncontrary, and as the trial court found below, “[o]f the images reviewed by the\n\nCity’s police officers, only between sixty-five percent (65%) and seventy percent\n\n(70%) are approved as a violation.”\n\n       In summary, we agree Arem was properly decided given the record as\n\nreflected in the Arem opinion. Because of the vastly different record in this case,\n\nhowever, we find Arem clearly distinguishable. For all the reasons discussed\n\nabove, we answer the first certified question in the affirmative.\n\n       B. Certified Question Number 2: the Vendor’s Printing and Mailing of\n          Notices and Citations.\n\n                                         25\n\f      The trial court’s second certified question reads:\n\n      If the vendor is permitted to review and then forward images in\n      accordance with a municipality’s written guidelines, is it an illegal\n      delegation of police power for the vendor to print and mail the\n      [citation], through a totally automated process without human\n      involvement, after the law enforcement officer has affirmatively made\n      a probable cause determination and authorizes the prosecution of the\n      violation by selecting the “accept” button?\n\n      Jimenez argues that the statutory language requiring the “issuance” of the\n\nnotice and citation by an “officer” signifies that the officer who makes the probable\n\ncause decision must also print and mail the citation. § 316.0083(1)(a), Fla. Stat.\n\nTaken to its logical extreme, Jimenez’s argument would require the officer to affix\n\nthe stamps, seal the envelopes, and drop the items in the mailbox. The trial court\n\nrejected Jimenez’s argument in this regard. In doing so, it found that, once the\n\nofficer decides the citation will issue, “a fully automated computer program is\n\ntriggered to print and mail the [notice and citation] based on the owner’s failure to\n\nelect any of the options under the time frame contained in the statute. [The Vendor]\n\nonly acts as an electronic apparatus to print and mail [the notice and citation].”\n\n       We agree with the trial court. Jimenez’s argument conflates the non-\n\ndelegable discretionary power to make the decision to issue the citation with the\n\ndelegable clerical and ministerial task of delivering the citation. By way of\n\nanalogy, the Florida Constitution similarly authorizes individual justices of the\n\nFlorida Supreme Court, judges of the district courts, and judges of the circuit\n\n\n                                          26\n\fcourts to “issue” writs of habeas corpus. Art. V, §§ 3(b), 4(b), 5(b). Surely, an\n\notherwise lawful writ would not be rendered unlawful because the issuing jurist did\n\nnot personally print, seal, and mail the envelopes used to deliver the writ. Nor does\n\nthe law require the writ to be delivered by a person under the immediate\n\nsupervision or employ of the judge. See Fla. Bar v. Abreu, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">833</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">752</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 753\n\n(Fla. 2002) (noting with approval that the Florida Supreme Court’s order to show\n\ncause was served by a private process server). Likewise, we see nothing in the\n\nstatutory language mandating that a sworn police officer, with years of specialized\n\nlaw enforcement training, must perform or directly supervise such clerical tasks.\n\n      Thus, we answer the second certified question in the negative. The statutory\n\nlanguage providing that only an officer can issue a citation means that only an\n\nofficer can make the discretionary decision that probable cause exists and the\n\ncitation issues. Once that discretionary decision is made, nothing in the statutory\n\nlanguage prohibits the police from delegating the clerical and ministerial task of\n\ndelivering the notice and citation to administrative staff, independent contractors,\n\nor private vendors. See, e.g., Abreu, 833 So. 2d at 753.\n\n      C. Certified Question Number 3: Use of the Vendor’s Server to Provide\n         an Electronic Copy to the Clerk.\n\n      The third question certified by the trial court reads as follows:\n\n      Does the fact that the [citation] data is electronically transmitted to the\n      Clerk of the Court from the vendor’s server via a totally automated\n      process without human involvement violate Florida Statute\n\n                                          27\n\f      §316.650(3)(c) when it is the law enforcement officer who\n      affirmatively authorizes the transmission process by selecting the\n      “accept” button?\n\n      Jimenez contends that the language in the controlling statute stating that the\n\n“officer shall provide by electronic transmission a replica of the traffic citation date\n\nto the court having jurisdiction” means that the officer cannot use the clerical and\n\nministerial services of the Vendor to provide the electronic copy to the Court. The\n\ntrial court rejected this argument: “This Court finds that the process by which red\n\nlight camera E-citations are transmitted is no different than how other E-citations\n\nare transmitted when an officer issues the [citation] roadside . . . therefore, the fact\n\nthat the computer program that actually sends the data is that of a vendor does not\n\nviolate the statute.” Again, we agree with the trial court.\n\n      We see nothing in the statutory language indicating any legislative intent to\n\nbar law enforcement from using third-party software and servers to accomplish\n\nthese ministerial and clerical tasks. See generally Frazier v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">180</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1067</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(Fla. 5th DCA 2015) (recognizing the legality of the police making use of third\n\nparty vendor software to aggregate public information when the same task could\n\notherwise be performed manually by law enforcement, albeit at a slower and less\n\nefficient pace). To read such a requirement into the statute, where it does not exist,\n\nwould serve only to waste limited law enforcement resources and taxpayer dollars.\n\nWe therefore answer the question in the negative.\n\n\n\n                                          28\n\f          CERTIFICATION OF GREAT PUBLIC IMPORTANCE\n\n      Because the lawful use of cameras to enforce red lights has attracted the\n\nattention of the public, local governments, and the Legislature, we certify the\n\nfollowing issues, which we have answered in this opinion, pursuant to Article V,\n\nsection 3(b)(4) of the Florida Constitution as having great public importance:\n\n      1. Does the review of red light camera images authorized by section\n         316.0083(1)(a), Florida Statutes (2014), allow a municipality’s\n         vendor, as its agent, to sort images to forward to the law\n         enforcement officer, where the controlling contract and City\n         guidelines limit the Vendor to deciding whether the images contain\n         certain easy-to-identify characteristics and where only the law\n         enforcement officer makes the determinations whether probable\n         cause exists and whether to issue a notice of violation and citation?\n\n      2. Is it an illegal delegation of police power for the vendor to print\n         and mail the notices and citation, through a totally automated\n         process without human involvement, after the law enforcement\n         officer makes the determinations that probable cause exists and to\n         issue a notice of violation and citation?\n\n      3. Does the fact that the citation data is electronically transmitted to\n         the Clerk of the Court from the vendor’s server via a totally\n         automated process without human involvement violate section\n         316.650(3)(c), Florida Statutes (2014), when it is the law\n         enforcement officer who affirmatively authorizes the transmission\n         process?\n\n      Affirmed in part; reversed in part; questions of great public importance\n\ncertified; and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n      EMAS, J., concurs.\n\n\n\n\n                                        29\n\f                       State of Florida, by and through the City of Aventura, et. al.,\n                                                             v. Luis Torres Jimenez\n                                               Case Nos. 3D15-2303 & 3D15-2271\n\n\nWELLS, Judge, (specially concurring).\n      I agree with the majority that the first of the three certified questions must be\n\nanswered in the affirmative and the remaining two questions must be answered in\n\nthe negative. I do so for the following reasons.\n\n      First, section 316.0083 of the Florida Statutes authorizes, and provides basic\n\nprocedures for local governments to utilize automated devices, that is, computer\n\noperated cameras, to enforce laws regulating conduct at traffic lights.         See §\n\n316.0083, Fla. Stat. (2010) (authorizing use of cameras to enforce traffic light\n\nviolations; providing for notice of violations to be sent to vehicle owners;\n\nproviding for exemptions from liability; providing for challenges to purported\n\nviolations at an administrative hearing; and providing for appeals from adverse\n\nadministrative hearing determinations).       As pertinent here, this law expressly\n\nauthorizes law enforcement agencies responsible for enforcing traffic laws to\n\n                                         30\n\futilize agents to screen images secured by automated devices before issuance of a\n\ntraffic violation citation by a traffic infraction enforcement officer:\n\n             For purposes of administering this section, the department, a\n      county, or a municipality may authorize a traffic infraction\n      enforcement officer under s. 316.640 to issue a traffic citation for a\n      violation of s. 316.074(1) or 316.075(1)(c)1. . . . This paragraph does\n      not prohibit a review of information from a traffic infraction detector\n      by an authorized employee or agent of the department, a county, or a\n      municipality before issuance of the traffic citation by the traffic\n      infraction enforcement officer.\n§ 316.0083(1)(a), Fla. Stat. (2015). 4\n\n      In keeping with this provision, in 2010, Aventura amended its contract with\n\nAmerican Traffic Solutions, Inc., the agent selected to operate Aventura’s\n\ncomputerized red-light camera system.           That contract as amended accorded\n\nAmerican the limited authority to screen images of vehicles taken at designated\n\nintersections in the city:\n\n      [American] shall act as City’s agent for the limited purpose of making\n      an initial determination of whether the recorded images should be\n      forwarded to an authorized [City] employee to determine whether an\n      infraction has occurred and shall not forward for processing those\n\n\n\n4 See also § 316.074(1), Fla. Stat. (2105) (requiring drivers to obey the instructions\nof any official traffic control device unless directed otherwise by a police officer);\n§ 316.075(1), Fla. Stat. (2015) (requiring drivers generally to obey traffic control\ndevices “exhibiting different colored lights”); § 316.640(3), Fla. Stat. (2015)\n(providing for traffic laws to be enforced in municipalities by local police and\nsheriff’s department officers); § 316.640(5)(a), Fla. Stat. (2015) (expressly\nauthorizing municipal law enforcement agencies to employ “any individual who\nsuccessfully completes instruction in traffic enforcement procedures and court\npresentation” to issue citations for traffic law infractions).\n\n                                           31\n\f       recorded images that clearly fail to establish the occurrence of an\n       infraction.\n\nIn conjunction with this agreement, Aventura adopted a number of guidelines\n\npursuant to which American was to screen images as authorized by the\n\nAventura/American contract.\n\n       With regard to the screening of images that might show a vehicle running a\n\nred light for example, the guidelines promulgated by Aventura generally require\n\nAmerican to screen images of vehicles at electronically monitored intersections by\n\nexamining images of vehicles’ tires in relationship to lines demarking an\n\nintersection. Specifically, under Aventura’s guidelines, American screeners are to\n\nexamine still images taken after a traffic light has turned red (“shot A”) which\n\ndepict the position of a vehicle’s front tires. If that image shows a vehicle’s front\n\ntires either on or slightly over the line demarking an intersection, a video clip of\n\nthe same vehicle is examined to confirm that the front tires were either on or\n\nslightly over the demarcation line when the light turned red. If so, American is not\n\nto pass on the images to a traffic infraction enforcement officer as there is no\n\nphotographic support for the conclusion an infraction has occurred. However, if\n\nvideo clip shows that the tires were behind the line when the light turned red, the\n\nimages are to be passed on to a traffic infraction enforcement officer to determine\n\nwhether a traffic infraction had occurred.5\n\n5   This is but one example of the guidelines adopted by Aventura to address\n\n                                         32\n\f      In my opinion, this constitutes no more than the “screening” expressly\n\nauthorized by the law. That is especially so here because the testimony was that\n\nAventura’s traffic infraction enforcement officers do not simply rubber stamp\n\nrecommendations or determinations made by American.           To the contrary, the\n\nrecord is that Aventura’s traffic infraction enforcement officers historically have\n\ndetermined that only sixty-five percent of the images forwarded by American\n\nevidence an infraction warranting issuance of a traffic citation. For this reason\n\nalone, I reject the notion advanced by our sister court in City of Hollywood v.\n\nArem, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">154</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">359</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla. 4th DCA 2014), that by allowing a servicing agent to\n\nforward pre-screened images to a traffic infraction enforcement officer that the\n\nservicing agent “[f]or all practical purposes” determines who is subject to\n\nprosecution for a red light violation.\n\n      The record in this case establishes that at most the servicing agent has been\n\naccorded only the ministerial authority to screen and cull those images which,\n\npursuant to a rigid set of guidelines, clearly show no possible violation of the\n\ntraffic laws; it is the traffic infraction officer alone who determines from the\n\npopulation of possible violators, those who will be subject to prosecution. This, in\n\nmy opinion, is neither a violation of the law nor a matter about which those cited\n\nscreening procedures with regard to a number of other potential traffic violations.\nBy way of example only, Aventura has adopted guidelines for screening images of\nlong vehicles and vehicles towing trailers and for screening images of vehicles\nmaking right turns on red.\n\n                                         33\n\ffor a violation have authority to complain. Put another way, the real issue here is\n\nthat some individuals who may have violated traffic regulations may be screened\n\nout of the process because the images of their vehicles were not sent to a traffic\n\ninfraction enforcement officer to determine if a violation has occurred.          This\n\nargument is no different than that made by an individual issued a speeding ticket\n\nwho complains that other speeders also were not ticketed. In short, the fact that\n\nAmerican determines certain images will not be forwarded—i.e., that some drivers\n\nwill not be ticketed—because images taken of their vehicles show that they have\n\nnot exceeded set guidelines, does not amount to determining whether those drivers\n\nwho potentially exceed those guidelines have violated the law. That determination,\n\nas the record before us confirms, is left solely to traffic infraction enforcement\n\nofficers. I therefore agree with the majority that the answer to the first certified\n\nquestion is “yes.”\n\n      I also agree with the majority that in today’s computerized world, the\n\nanswers to the second and third certified questions as to whether it is illegal for\n\nAmerican to print and mail a citation issued by a traffic infraction enforcement\n\nofficer, clearly is “no.” Pursuant to Aventura’s guidelines, after a traffic infraction\n\nenforcement officer receives images from American, the officer independently\n\nreviews the images to determine whether an infraction has occurred. If the officer\n\ndetermines that the image depicts an infraction, the officer electronically indicates\n\n\n\n                                          34\n\fthat he or she accepts that an infraction has occurred and electronically issues the\n\nnotice of infraction by authorizing American to send a notice of violation bearing\n\nthe officer’s badge number and signature. American then uses a form approved by\n\nthe State of Florida. The clerk of the court is also notified electronically by\n\nAmerican or one of its subsidiaries or vendors. As the testimony adduced below\n\nconfirms, this is little different from what happens when an officer issues a\n\nviolation roadside:\n\n            Q. So can you explain how that information is sent\n      electronically, if you know?\n\n             A. It is sent electronically to [the clerk’s office].\n\n            Q. Is that any different than any other electronic citation\n      information that might be sent from roadside?\n\n            A. In the instance when it is sent from my computer roadside,\n      it would go through my station’s server and then to Miami-Dade\n      Clerk of Courts.\n\n            In the instance of these violations they – this officer approves\n      them, the server – [American’s] server in Arizona provides that\n      information to the Miami-Dade Clerk of Courts.\n\n      In my opinion, to conclude that such ministerial acts are unauthorized by\n\nsection 316.0083 would be akin to determining that a trial judge has no authority to\n\ninstruct a judicial assistant to prepare a computerized order which the judge\n\nelectronically signs and issues electronically to the parties and the clerk’s office.\n\nNeedless to say, this court determines and electronically transmits many matters\n\n\n\n                                           35\n\feach day. It is the judges who decide the cases and issue their opinions, however it\n\nis the clerk’s office which electronically sends those decisions on to the\n\nappropriate parties.\n\n      I also find no violation of section 316.0083 when American electronically\n\n“issues” a uniform traffic citation (as expressly authorized by Aventura with\n\nautomatic notification to the court) when the owner of a vehicle fails to respond to\n\na traffic citation as required by law. See § 316.0083(1)(b)1.a., Fla. Stat. (2015)\n\n(providing that “to avoid the issuance of a traffic citation,” a vehicle owner notified\n\nof a violation must either pay a penalty, submit an affidavit, or request a hearing\n\nwithin 60 days of notification as provided in section 316.0083). Again, and at best,\n\nthis is a non-discretionary function which takes no more than a computer program\n\nto perform.\n\n      In conclusion, because I agree that the first certified question as to whether\n\nsection 316.0083 allows a municipality vendor to segregate images for forwarding\n\nto traffic infraction enforcement officers should be answered in the affirmative,\n\nand because I agree that the second and third certified questions about utilizing\n\nautomated processes should be answered in the negative, I agree that the order\n\nentered below must be reversed. I would not, however, certify this matter to the\n\nFlorida Supreme Court as a matter of exceptional importance as I do not believe\n\n\n\n\n                                          36\n\fthis matter is of such import as to warrant further review, but would certify this\n\ndecision as being in express and direct conflict with Arem.\n\n\n\n\n                                        37\n\f</pre>",
