The district court\r\nawarded Kitchen back pay, lost benefits, and attorney's fees and ordered Kitchen reinstated.  ASH\r\nand TDMHMR appeal, claiming that their objections and the jury's answers to questions in the\r\ncourt's charge should have precluded the deemed findings necessary for Kitchen to recover on her\r\ntheory that appellants failed to reasonably accommodate her employment at ASH.  We will reverse\r\nthe judgment of the trial court and remand the cause for new trial.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center><strong>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tKitchen was hired to work as a mental health aide in the Children and Adolescents\r\nPsychiatric Services (\"CAPS\") division of ASH in December 1990.  During the two-week\r\norientation preceding her initial assignment, Kitchen, who suffers from epilepsy, had a seizure\r\nthat disoriented her for several minutes.<strong><sup> (1)</sup></strong>  Following her seizure, CAPS Administrator Eddie\r\nMcQueary gave Kitchen a \"Physical Capacity Report\" for her doctor to complete.  The\r\nneurologist who had treated Kitchen's epilepsy for ten years, Dr. Vincent Virgadamo, indicated\r\non the form that Kitchen was capable of the job activities listed on the report,<strong><sup> (2)</sup></strong> provided that\r\n\"seizure precautions\" were taken.  To clarify the meaning of \"seizure precautions,\" McQueary\r\ngave Kitchen a second physical capacity report for Virgadamo to complete.  This second report\r\ndid not specifically request Virgadamo to explain the phrase \"seizure precautions,\" but it did ask\r\nhim to verify that Kitchen could be alert 100 percent of the time.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter faxing the second report, Kitchen had a telephone conversation with her\r\nfather and Virgadamo in which Virgadamo expressed reservations about the report.  He asked\r\nKitchen to have someone at ASH call him.  On January 24, 1991, Kitchen relayed Virgadamo's\r\nconcerns to McQueary and authorized an ASH physician to contact Virgadamo.  McQueary\r\ntestified that he gave Kitchen a deadline of January 25 at 3:00 p.m. for the return of the second\r\nreport.  When the report was not returned by the deadline, McQueary sent Kitchen to ASH's\r\nAssistant Superintendent, Adolph Supak, with the recommendation that she be terminated for\r\ninsubordination.  Supak terminated Kitchen's employment that day.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThere was conflicting testimony at trial about whether Kitchen had requested an\r\naccommodation and the extent to which ASH accommodated employees by reassigning them to\r\nother open positions within the organization.  In addition to maintaining that Kitchen never\r\nformally requested an accommodation, ASH asserted through McQueary that an accommodation\r\nwas not warranted unless Virgadamo refused to sign the second physical capacity report. \r\nAlternatively, ASH argued that absent clarification from Virgadamo, it was unable to determine\r\nwhat accommodation was necessary to render Kitchen \"otherwise qualified\" for the position and\r\nwhether such accommodation was reasonable.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center><strong>STATUTORY FRAMEWORK</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tKitchen brought her complaint pursuant to the former Texas Commission on\r\nHuman Rights Act (the \"Act\"), now found at chapter 21 of the Texas Labor Code.  <em>See</em> Tex. Lab.\r\nCode Ann. §§ 21.001-.262 (West 1995).<strong><sup> (3)</sup></strong></span><span>  Sections of the Act which form the basis for Kitchen's\r\nsuit provide:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>§ 21.051\tDiscrimination by Employer</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>An employer commits an unlawful employment practice if because of race, color,\r\ndisability, religion, sex, national origin, or age the employer:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t(1) fails or refuses to hire an individual, discharges an individual, or\r\ndiscriminates in any other manner against an individual in connection\r\nwith compensation or the terms, conditions, or privileges of\r\nemployment . . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>§ 21.105\tDiscrimination Based on Disability</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA provision in this subchapter or Subchapter B referring to\r\ndiscrimination because of disability or on the basis of disability\r\napplies only to discrimination because of or on the basis of a physical\r\nor mental condition <em>that does not impair an individual's ability to\r\nreasonably perform a job</em>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>§ 21.260\tRelief for Disabled Employee or Applicant</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIf the affected employee or applicant for employment has a disability,\r\na court shall consider <em>the undue hardship defense</em>, including the\r\nreasonableness of the cost of necessary workplace accommodation\r\nand the availability of alternatives or other appropriate relief.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em>Id.</em> §§ 21.051, .105, .260 (emphasis added).  Appellants initially protested that these sections of\r\nthe Act did not expressly provide that an employer's failure to make reasonable workplace\r\naccommodation constituted an independent ground or theory of recovery for employment\r\ndiscrimination.<strong><sup> (4)</sup></strong></span><span>  The language and purpose of the Act persuade us, however, that a cause of\r\naction based on an employer's failure to accommodate a disability was implied under the Act when\r\nKitchen filed suit.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Act has among its express purposes:  (1) \"the execution of the policies of Title\r\nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\"; (2) securing freedom from discrimination in employment\r\ntransactions \"for persons in this state, including persons with disabilities\"; and (3) the\r\ndevelopment of the \"full productive capacities of persons of this state.\"  <em>Id.</em> §§ 21.001(1), (3), (4). \r\nBecause the Act seeks to promote federal civil rights policy and because Texas has little caselaw\r\ninterpreting the Act, this Court looks to analogous federal law when appropriate.  <em>Farrington v.\r\nSysco Food Servs., Inc.</em>, 865 S.W.2d 247, 251 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1993, writ denied);\r\n<em>City of Austin v. Gifford</em>, 824 S.W.2d 735, 739 (Tex. App.--Austin 1992, no writ).  The Texas Act\r\nis broader than Title VII, which does not apply by its terms to disability or handicap\r\ndiscrimination.  <em>See</em> 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e-2(a), 2000e-16(a) (1988) (prohibiting discriminatory\r\nemployment practices based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin); <em>Stroud v. Delta\r\nAirlines, Inc.</em>, 544 F.2d 892, 894 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, 434 U.S. 844 (1977) (Title VII does\r\nnot ban all discriminations, only those specifically enumerated).  Instead, federal policy regarding\r\nemployment discrimination based on disability is found in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29\r\nU.S.C. §§ 701-797b (1988 &amp; Supp. V 1993), and the Americans with Disabilities Act (the\r\n\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213 (Supp. V 1993).  Consequently, we look to the most closely\r\nanalogous provisions of these laws in interpreting our state's Act with regard to disability\r\ndiscrimination.<strong><sup> (5)</sup></strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOur review of the relevant federal statutes convinces us that the jurisprudence\r\ndeveloped under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act is most applicable to Kitchen's case.  <em>See</em>\r\n29 U.S.C. § 794 (1988 &amp; Supp. V 1993).<strong><sup> (6)</sup></strong>  Section 504 provides in pertinent part:  \"No otherwise\r\nqualified individual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be\r\nexcluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination in . .\r\n. any [federally funded] program or activity . . . .\"  <em>Id.</em> § 794(a) (1988).  Sections 21.051 and\r\n21.105 of the Texas Act make it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discharge\r\na disabled person on the basis of a disability when the disability does not impair the individual's\r\nability to reasonably perform a job.  Tex. Lab. Code Ann. §§ 21.051, .105 (West 1995). \r\nFacially, the Act more closely resembles section 504's broad prohibition against discrimination\r\nthan the prohibitions of other federal statutes that explicitly address an employer's failure to\r\naccommodate.  For example, the ADA includes provisions regarding \"reasonable\r\naccommodation,\" which resemble the Texas Act after its amendment in 1993, but do not parallel\r\nas closely the wording of the Texas statute that governed Kitchen's cause of action.<strong><sup> (7)</sup></strong></span><span>  However,\r\neven section 504 incorporates the question of reasonable accommodation as part of the inquiry into\r\nwhether an individual is \"otherwise qualified.\"  <em>School Bd. of Nassau County v. Arline</em>, 480 U.S.\r\n273, 288 (1987); <em>Gilbert v. Frank</em>, 949 F.2d 637, 642 (2d Cir. 1991).  We agree with the Fifth\r\nCircuit that the Texas Act's mandate that the individual be able to \"reasonably perform a job\"\r\nrequires the same inquiry.  <em>See Chiari v. City of League City</em>, 920 F.2d 311, 319 (5th Cir. 1991).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center><strong>THE COURT'S CHARGE</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe court submitted three questions to the jury.  The first two asked the jury to\r\ndecide issues related to Kitchen's claim.  Relevant portions of the questions and accompanying\r\ninstructions are:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><span>Question No. 1</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tDo you find from a preponderance of the evidence that [ASH and\r\nTDMHMR] discharged [Kitchen] because of her disability?  A \"yes\"\r\nanswer must be based on a preponderance of the evidence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tYou are instructed that [Kitchen] has a disability under Texas law.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tYou are further instructed that \"because of disability\" means discrimination\r\nbecause of or on the basis of a physical or mental condition that does not\r\nimpair an individual's ability to reasonably perform a job.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tANSWER:  No.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIf you answered \"no\" to Question No. 1, please answer Question No. 2. \r\nOtherwise, go on to Question No. 3.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><span>Question No. 2</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tDo you find from a preponderance of the evidence that [ASH and\r\nTDMHMR] could not have reasonably accommodated [Kitchen] in her\r\nemployment at the Austin State Hospital?  Answer \"They could not have\"\r\nor \"They could have.\"  An answer of \"They could not have\" must be based\r\non a preponderance of the evidence.  If you do not find a preponderance of\r\nthe evidence supports an answer of \"They could not have,\" then answer\r\n\"They could have.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIn connection with this issue, you are instructed that \"reasonable\r\naccommodation\" means steps, modifications, or adjustments that would\r\npermit a person to perform a job with safety and efficiency.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tYou are further instructed that in order to find that a person could not\r\nperform a job with safety, there must be a reasonable probability that her\r\njob performance would result in substantial harm to herself or others.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tYou are further instructed in connection with this issue that factors in\r\ndetermining whether a reasonable accommodation of a person with a\r\ndisability can be made include reasonableness of the cost of any necessary\r\nworkplace accommodation and the availability of alternatives.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tANSWER:  They could have.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tASH and TDMHMR raised several objections to this charge at the initial charge\r\nconference.  First, they objected to the inclusion of question 2, arguing that the statute as it\r\nexisted at the time of Kitchen's suit did not impose a requirement of reasonable accommodation\r\nupon the employer.  Second, appellants objected to the instruction that the jury answer question\r\n2 even if they answered \"no\" to question 1.  Appellants insisted that the jury should reach\r\nquestion 2 <em>only if</em> they found in question 1 that Kitchen had been discharged because of her\r\ndisability.  In effect, appellants' objections demonstrate that they understood the issue in question\r\n2 to be an affirmative defense, not a second theory under which Kitchen could prove\r\ndiscrimination based on a disability.<strong><sup> (8)</sup></strong></span><span>  This impression is strengthened by appellants' request for\r\na trial amendment to their pleading adding the affirmative defense of \"undue burden,\" which the\r\ncourt granted.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter a lunch recess, but before the jury was returned, appellants again objected\r\nto the court's charge.  Apparently realizing that question 2 referred to a separate theory of\r\nrecovery and not an affirmative defense, appellants objected that the burden of proof on the\r\naccommodation issue in question 2 improperly rested with them and not with Kitchen.  The court\r\noverruled the objection, saying that it came too late or should be overruled on the merits.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter the jury returned its verdict, Kitchen moved for judgment and requested a\r\nsupplemental finding from the trial court that \"[ASH and TDMHMR] failed reasonably to\r\naccommodate [Kitchen] in her employment at Austin State Hospital.\"  Kitchen averred as required\r\nunder Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 279 that this finding was a necessary element of her theory\r\nof recovery for failure to provide reasonable accommodation, that the finding was supported by\r\nlegally and factually sufficient evidence, and that neither party requested submission nor objected\r\nto the nonsubmission of this element.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. Civ. P. 279.  Appellants responded that\r\nKitchen was asking the court to deem a theory of recovery to which they had objected, and which\r\nKitchen had waived by omitting it from the charge.  <em>See Ramos v. Frito-Lay, Inc.</em>, 784 S.W.2d\r\n667, 668 (Tex. 1990).  Appellants further requested that the trial court disregard the jury's\r\nfindings to questions 2 and 3, arguing that the jury's answer to question 1 resolved the issue of\r\ntheir liability against Kitchen and that question 2 was no more than an affirmative defense which\r\nbecame irrelevant.  The trial court granted Kitchen's motion for supplemental findings and\r\nrendered judgment in her favor.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThis appeal asks us to decide (1) which party bears the burden of proof on the issue\r\nof reasonable accommodation in an action for employment discrimination based on a theory of\r\nfailure to accommodate, (2) whether that burden was properly allocated in this case, and if not (3)\r\nwhether error was properly preserved so as to prevent a deemed finding on the issue by the trial\r\ncourt.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe United States Supreme Court in two decisive cases has carefully outlined the\r\nallocation of the burdens of proof and production that apply to Title VII discrimination cases.  <em>See\r\nTexas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine</em>, 450 U.S. 248 (1981); <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp.\r\nv. Green</em>, 411 U.S. 792 (1973); <em>see also Texas Dep't of Human Servs. v. Hinds</em>, 38 Tex. Sup. Ct.\r\nJ. 711 (June 8, 1995).  Key to our resolution of the instant dispute is the Court's holding that\r\n\"[t]he ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated\r\nagainst the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff.\"  <em>Burdine</em>, 450 U.S. at 253.  As the\r\nCourt explained, however, the intermediate burdens of production alternate between the plaintiff\r\nand the defendant and serve to eliminate claims at an earlier stage if no fact dispute exists that\r\nrequires the court or jury to reach this ultimate question.  <em>Id.</em> at 253-55.<strong><sup> (9)</sup></strong></span><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe <em>Burdine</em> system of burden allocation clearly applies to those situations in which\r\nan employer denies that an individual's disability played any role in its employment decision.  <em>See,\r\ne.g.</em>, <em>Barth v. Gelb</em>, 2 F.3d 1180, 1186 (D.C. Cir. 1993).  In many cases of disability\r\ndiscrimination like Kitchen's, however, the employer may concede that the employee's disability\r\nplayed a role in its employment decision, but the parties disagree whether the disability impedes\r\nthe employee's ability to perform the \"essential functions\" of the job or whether a reasonable\r\naccommodation is feasible that would enable the employee to perform the job.  <em>Id.</em>  The <em>Burdine</em>\r\ntest is somewhat inappropriate in these situations because the propriety of the employment\r\ndecision turns on the objective claims of the parties that accommodation was or was not possible\r\nrather than on the employer's subjective motivation.  <em>Id.</em>  Nonetheless, the basic principle is\r\nconstant: the burden remains with the plaintiff to prove her case of employment discrimination\r\nby a preponderance of the evidence.  <em>Id.</em>; <em>see also Hinds</em>, 38 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. at 717; <em>Mason v.\r\nFrank</em>, 32 F.3d 315, 318 (8th Cir. 1994).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn a cause of action alleging failure to accommodate, part of plaintiff's burden is\r\nto demonstrate that she is \"otherwise qualified\" for the position from which she was excluded. \r\nShe may show this qualification in one of two ways:  (1) by proving that she can perform all\r\nessential job functions without modifications or accommodations, or (2) that some reasonable\r\naccommodation by the employer would enable her to perform the job.  29 C.F.R. § 1613.702(f)\r\n(defining qualified handicapped person under § 504 of Rehabilitation Act as one who \"with or\r\nwithout reasonable accommodation can perform the essential functions of the position in question\r\nwithout endangering the health and safety of the individual or others\"); <em>Arline</em>, 480 U.S. at 288\r\nn.17; <em>Mantolete v. Bolger</em>, 767 F.2d 1416, 1423 (9th Cir. 1985).  Although there appears to be\r\nconsensus among the federal courts to this extent, opinions diverge on whether the plaintiff or the\r\ndefendant employer then bears the burden of persuading the trier of fact that accommodations are\r\nor are not possible.  <em>Compare Barth</em>, 2 F.3d at 1186-87<em> and Chandler v. City of Dallas</em>, 2 F.3d\r\n1385, 1395 (5th Cir. 1993) <em>with Prewitt v. United States Postal Serv.</em>, 662 F.2d 292, 308 (5th\r\nCir. 1981) (burden of proving inability to accommodate always remains on employer because\r\nemployer has greater knowledge of essentials of job and can obtain advice concerning\r\naccommodations from private and government sources).<strong><sup> (10)</sup></strong></span><span>  One court has suggested that the\r\ndisparity may result from the obligation of the government to undertake affirmative action to\r\naccommodate the disabled under section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act, an obligation not imposed\r\nunder section 504 on programs receiving federal funds.  <em>See Overton v. Reilly</em>, 977 F.2d 1190,\r\n1194 (7th Cir. 1992).  However, even that court acknowledges a lack of consensus on the\r\nallocation of burden to prove reasonable accommodation under section 504.  <em>Id.</em>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe issue is further complicated by the availability of the \"undue hardship\" defense. \r\nOnce the plaintiff has shown that a method of accommodation would allow her to perform the\r\nessentials of the job, the defendant employer has two options: it may either attempt to refute the\r\nplaintiff's evidence by demonstrating that the plaintiff would be unable to perform the essentials\r\nof the job despite the proposed accommodation, or it may assume the burden of proving that the\r\nproposed accommodation imposes on it an undue financial, logistic, or administrative burden. \r\n<em>See Barth</em>, 2 F.3d at 1186-87.  As with other affirmative defenses, the defendant bears the burden\r\nof proof for the undue hardship defense.  <em>Id.</em>  However, as the <em>Barth</em> court noted, \"a grey area\"\r\narises if a proposed accommodation is both unduly burdensome and unreasonable.  <em>Id.</em>  We\r\nbelieve the confusion is lessened if the \"reasonableness\" of the accommodation is evaluated in\r\nterms of the plaintiff's ability to do the job, while the question of \"undue hardship\" is linked to\r\nthe employer's financial and organizational ability to adopt the proposed modifications.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tUnder this analysis, the plaintiff clearly retains the burden of proving by a\r\npreponderance of the evidence that an accommodation is possible that would enable her to perform\r\nthe \"essential functions\" of the position she holds or seeks.  <em>Id.</em>; <em>Chandler</em>, 2 F.3d at 1395; 29\r\nC.F.R. §§ 1613.702(f), .704(a)-(b).  By demonstrating that she could be reasonably\r\naccommodated, the plaintiff proves that she is \"otherwise qualified\" for or can, under the Texas\r\nAct, \"reasonably perform a job.\"  Tex. Lab. Code Ann. § 21.015; <em>Chiari</em>, 920 F.2d at 319.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe court's charge in the instant cause essentially collapsed into one question the\r\nissue of reasonable accommodation, on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof, and the issue\r\nof undue hardship, an affirmative defense on which the defendant bears the burden of proof.  The\r\ncourt subsumed the question of whether Kitchen was \"otherwise qualified\" by instructing the jury\r\nthat a reasonable accommodation was one that \"would permit a person to perform a job with\r\nsafety and efficiency\" and without \"substantial harm to herself or others.\"  However, the court\r\nsimultaneously instructed the jury to consider the cost of the accommodation and availability of\r\nalternatives in deciding whether an accommodation could be made--factors a defendant would argue\r\nin support of its affirmative defense that a particular accommodation is unduly burdensome.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAlthough the caselaw suffers from a lack of clarity in setting forth the elements and\r\nburdens in a discrimination action based on a failure to accommodate, and although appellants\r\nfailed to object to the charge as artfully as they might have, we believe their objections were\r\nsufficient to preserve error.  The objections clearly demonstrate that appellants believed question\r\n2 to be an affirmative defense.  Appellants find further support for their contention because the\r\nquestion placed the burden of proof on them and because the instruction on the cost of\r\naccommodation and availability of alternatives tracks the statutory language of section 21.260,\r\ninstructing the court to consider \"the undue hardship <em>defense</em>.\"  <em>See</em> Tex. Lab. Code Ann. §\r\n21.260 (emphasis added). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMoreover, question 1 broadly asked whether appellants discharged Kitchen because\r\nof her disability, with instructions tracking the language of sections 21.051 and 21.105.  Once\r\ntheir objection that the Act contained no accommodation requirement until the 1993 amendments\r\nwas overruled, appellants may have believed that question 1 incorporated both disparate treatment\r\nand failure to accommodate theories of recovery, with question 2 remaining their affirmative\r\ndefense.<strong><sup> (11)</sup></strong></span><span>  As appellants cogently argue, if question 1 incorporates the failure to accommodate\r\ntheory of recovery, the jury's negative finding on this question absolves them of liability.  Even\r\nKitchen admits in a post-submission brief that \"[f]ailure to make reasonable accommodation is\r\nitself disability discrimination.\"  Kitchen's petition alleged only general \"disability discrimination\"\r\nwithout outlining the separate theories of disparate treatment and failure to accommodate. \r\nTherefore, although we do not believe that Kitchen's failure to amend her petition to reflect her\r\ntwo theories precludes her recovery under the statute at that time, her failure to separately plead\r\nthe theories certainly lends credence to appellants' interpretation of question 1 as incorporating\r\nboth theories.  However, because question 2 related clearly to neither an affirmative defense nor\r\nto the special issue of accommodation, we decline to render judgment for appellants on the basis\r\nof the jury's answer to question 1.  <em>See Spencer v. Eagle Star Ins. Co.</em>, 876 S.W.2d 154, 157\r\n(Tex. 1994).  We therefore overrule appellants' first point of error urging that the trial court erred\r\nby refusing to disregard the jury's answers to questions 2 and 3.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe do believe, however, that Kitchen bore the burden of proving that reasonable\r\naccommodation was possible in order to show that she was \"otherwise qualified,\" and that\r\nappellants were entitled to raise the affirmative defense that the accommodation she proposed was\r\nunduly burdensome.  Given the confusion in the statute, caselaw, and instructions in this case, it\r\nis not surprising that appellants failed to realize that question 2 embodied Kitchen's second theory\r\nof recovery, not their affirmative defense, and failed to object to the misplaced burden of proof\r\nat the original charge conference.  The question remains whether the objection was timely.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTexas Rule of Civil Procedure 272 requires the court to allow counsel for the\r\nparties \"a reasonable time\" to inspect and raise objections to the charge.  The rule establishes as\r\nan outside limit that all objections be presented \"before the charge is read to the jury.\"  Tex. R.\r\nCiv. P. 272.  Kitchen argues that the trial court has discretion to set the time allowed for\r\nobjections to the jury charge.  <em>See Hargrove v. Texas Employers' Ins. Ass'n</em>, 332 S.W.2d 121\r\n(Tex. Civ. App.--Amarillo 1959, no writ); <em>Burton v. Williams</em>, 195 S.W.2d 245 (Tex. Civ.\r\nApp.--Amarillo 1946, writ ref'd n.r.e.); <em>Federal Underwriters Exch. v. Tubbe</em>, 180 S.W.2d 473\r\n(Tex. Civ. App.--Amarillo), <em>rev'd on other grounds</em>, 183 S.W.2d 444 (Tex. 1944).  Although the\r\ncases Kitchen cites generally support the proposition that a trial court has discretion to set the\r\namount of time counsel has to inspect and object to the charge, those cases are not on point.  In\r\n<em>Hargrove</em> and <em>Burton</em>, counsel failed to raise objections or request instructions until the court had\r\nbegun to read the charge to the jury.  <em>Hargrove</em>, 332 S.W.2d at 123; <em>Burton</em>, 195 S.W.2d at 249. \r\nAt that point, under the current rules, the trial court no longer had discretion to consider the\r\nrequests or objections.  <em>Methodist Hosps. of Dallas v. Corporate Communicators, Inc.</em>, 806\r\nS.W.2d 879, 884-85 (Tex. App.--Dallas 1991, writ denied).  In <em>Tubbe</em>, the court found that\r\nappellant failed to show harm because he was able to prepare all of his objections in the hour and\r\na half the court allowed.  <em>Tubbe</em>, 180 S.W.2d at 477.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe purpose of Rule 272 is to allow the court to correct any errors in the charge\r\nbefore submitting it to the jury.  <em>Methodist Hosps.</em>, 806 S.W.2d at 884.  In the instant cause, the\r\ncourt did not set in advance a deadline for submitting requests or objections, and appellants raised\r\ntheir objections before the jury returned to receive the charge.  Moreover, the trial court did not\r\nrely solely on a procedural technicality in overruling appellants' objection.  Although it\r\nadmonished appellants that the objection came too late, the court also stated that the objection was\r\noverruled even if timely.  Because the trial court clearly considered the substance of appellants'\r\ncomplaint, we believe that appellants have satisfied the requirement for preserving error in the\r\njury charge as articulated by the Texas Supreme Court.  <em>See State Dep't of Highways &amp; Pub.\r\nTransp. v. Payne</em>, 838 S.W.2d 235, 241 (Tex. 1992) (\"There should be but one test for\r\ndetermining if a party has preserved error in the jury charge, and that is <em>whether the party made\r\nthe trial court aware of the complaint, timely and plainly, and obtained a ruling</em>.\") (emphasis\r\nadded); <em>Hinds</em>, 38 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. at 718;<em> cf. Alaniz v. Jones &amp; Neuse, Inc.</em>, 878 S.W.2d 244,\r\n245 (Tex. 1994) (challenge to charge not preserved despite <em>Payne</em>, because plaintiff failed to\r\nfollow specific rules for requests in Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 273).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause appellants' objection to the charge was sufficient to preserve error on\r\nKitchen's burden to prove that she was otherwise qualified for her position with reasonable\r\naccommodation, we hold that the trial court erred in deeming her requested finding that appellants\r\nfailed to reasonably accommodate her employment at ASH.  <em>See Payne</em>, 838 S.W.2d at 241\r\n(finding on element of plaintiff's case cannot be deemed in her favor if opposing party objected\r\nto omission of special issue); <em>see also Spencer</em>, 876 S.W.2d at 157 (proper objection to material\r\nissue in defective charge entitles party to new trial); <em>Dittberner v. Bell</em>, 558 S.W.2d 527, 534\r\n(Tex. Civ. App.--Amarillo 1977, writ ref'd n.r.e.).  Contrary to Kitchen's assertions, the evidence\r\ndid not establish conclusively that appellants failed to reasonably accommodate her; although the\r\njury certainly may have determined on this record that ASH's conduct in Kitchen's dismissal\r\nlacked good faith, the burden was Kitchen's to persuade the jury that reasonable accommodations\r\nwere possible that would have rendered her otherwise qualified for her position.  Similarly, issues\r\nrelating to appellants' affirmative defense of \"undue burden\" should have been more clearly\r\narticulated and allocated to a separate question.  Accordingly, we sustain appellants' second point\r\nof error.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe hold that Kitchen bore the burden of proving that reasonable accommodation\r\nwas possible as part of her burden of establishing that she was otherwise qualified for her position\r\nat ASH.  Appellants properly attempted through their objections to segregate the issue of\r\nreasonable accommodation on which Kitchen bore the burden of proof and their affirmative\r\ndefense that any accommodation was unduly burdensome.  Because appellants' objections were\r\nsufficient to preserve error, the trial court should not have deemed the finding that appellants\r\nfailed to reasonably accommodate Kitchen.  We therefore reverse the judgment of the trial court\r\nand remand the cause for new trial on Kitchen's claim of failure to accommodate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t<span>                                                               </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\tBea Ann Smith, Justice</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Before Justices Powers, Jones and B.

Kitchen herself testified that the seizure was typical of other seizures\r\nshe has had.\r\n<p>2.      <strong>  McQueary also apparently gave Kitchen a copy of the job description for her\r\nposition, which she failed to forward to Virgadamo.\r\n<p>3.      <strong>  At the time of trial, the Act was found at Texas Revised Civil Statutes article 5221k. \r\nBecause the recodification of the Act in the Labor Code effected no substantive change in\r\nthe law, we cite the current code for convenience.  </strong><em>See</em> Act of May 12, 1993, 73d Leg.,\r\nR.S., ch. 269, §§ 5, 6, 1993 Tex. Gen. Laws 987, 1273.\r\n</p><p>4.      <strong>  When it recodified the Act in the Labor Code, the legislature concurrently amended\r\nthe Act to make an employer's failure or refusal to furnish reasonable workplace\r\naccommodation an unlawful employment practice.  </strong><em>See</em> Act of May 14, 1993, 73d Leg.,\r\nR.S., ch. 276, § 5.17, 1993 Tex. Gen. Laws 1285, 1288-89.  However, the amended\r\nprovisions apply only to complaints filed with the Commission on Human Rights on or after\r\nSeptember 1, 1993.  <em>Id.</em> at 1292.  Kitchen filed her complaint with the Commission on Human\r\nRights on February 8, 1991.\r\n</p><p>5.      <strong>  Although they provide distinct statutory bases for bringing claims of employment\r\ndiscrimination, federal courts have looked to Title VII precedent in interpreting the\r\nRehabilitation Act of 1973.  </strong><em>See, e.g.</em>, <em>Barth v. Gelb</em>, 2 F.3d 1180, 1183-84 (D.C. Cir. 1993)\r\n(looking to Title VII precedent on religious discrimination).  In turn, the ADA adopts the\r\npowers, remedies, and procedures of Title VII and directs the agencies with enforcement\r\nauthority under the ADA to \"develop procedures to ensure that administrative complaints filed\r\nunder [the ADA] and under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 are dealt with in a manner that\r\navoids duplication of effort and prevents imposition of inconsistent or conflicting standards.\" \r\n42 U.S.C. § 12117(b) (Supp. V 1993); <em>see also</em> 29 U.S.C. §§ 791(g), 794(d) (synchronizing\r\nstandards used to determine violations under the Rehabilitation Act with those employed under\r\nthe ADA).\r\n</p><p>6.      <strong>  As codified, sections 501 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 appear at 29\r\nU.S.C. §§ 791 and 794, respectively.  Because most cases refer to these sections by their\r\nact rather than code designations, we will follow this convention.\r\n<p>7.      <strong>  The ADA includes in its definition of \"discrimination\" a failure to make \"reasonable\r\naccommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified\r\nindividual with a disability.\"  </strong><em>See </em>ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A) (Supp. V 1993).  The\r\nADA also defines \"qualified individual with a disability\" as an individual who \"with or\r\nwithout reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment\r\nposition that such individual holds or desires.\"  <em>Id.</em> § 12111(8).  Finally, the ADA explicitly\r\ndefines \"reasonable accommodation.\"  <em>See id. </em>§ 12111(9).  Because the ADA refers directly to\r\nthe issue of \"reasonable accommodation,\" it more closely resembles the Texas provisions\r\nfollowing the enactment of § 5.17 of the Labor Code.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tSection 501 of the Rehabilitation Act is also inapposite as a guide because it imposes an\r\naffirmative duty on employers which finds no counterpart in the Texas Act.  Section 501\r\nrequires <em>federal</em> employers to submit an \"affirmative action program plan for the hiring,\r\nplacement and advancement of individuals with disabilities\" including \"a description of the\r\nextent to which <em>and methods whereby</em> the special needs of employees who are individuals with\r\ndisabilities are being met.\"  29 U.S.C. § 791(b) (1988) (emphasis added); <em>see also</em> <em>Mantolete\r\nv. Bolger</em>, 767 F.2d 1416, 1421 (9th Cir. 1985) (observing § 501's explicit requirement that\r\naccommodation of the handicap be considered in determining handicapped person's\r\nqualification for employment); <em>Prewitt v. United States Postal Serv.</em>, 662 F.2d 292, 307 (5th\r\nCir. 1981) (same).  As appellants note, this affirmative duty to create an action program under\r\n§ 501 may shift the burden to the defendant employer to show that no reasonable\r\naccommodation was possible.  <em>See Overton v. Reilly</em>, 977 F.2d 1190, 1194 (7th Cir. 1992).\r\n<p>8.      <strong>  Appellants made a further objection in regard to question 3 that reinforces this\r\ninterpretation.  Question 3 asked the jury to award Kitchen attorney's fees if they\r\nanswered either \"yes\" to question 1 </strong><em>or</em> \"they could have\" to question 2.  Appellants requested\r\nthe instruction to read that the jury proceed to question 3 only if they answered question 1\r\naffirmatively <em>and</em> found the appellants could have accommodated Kitchen in question 2.\r\n</p><p>9.      <strong>  In </strong><em>Burdine</em> the Court applied these burdens of proof and production in a case alleging\r\ndisparate treatment discrimination, i.e., the blatant discrimination that stems from simple bias\r\nagainst the characteristic in question.  The plaintiff must first establish her prima facie case,\r\ndemonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that she was qualified for the position and\r\nthat the circumstances of termination give rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination. \r\n<em>Burdine</em>, 450 U.S. at 253.  If established, the prima facie case creates a presumption that the\r\nemployer unlawfully discriminated against the employee.  <em>Id.</em> at 254.  The burden then shifts\r\nto the defendant employer to produce evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact that its\r\nemployment action was not the result of discriminatory animus but instead was motivated by a\r\nlegitimate reason.  <em>Id.</em>  In so doing, the defendant employer rebuts the presumption raised by\r\nthe plaintiff's prima facie case and frames the factual issue requiring ultimate resolution by the\r\ntrier of fact.  The burden of production then returns to the plaintiff and merges with her\r\nultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the employer's proffered reason for its\r\naction is mere pretext and that she has been the victim of unlawful discrimination.  <em>Id.</em> at 255. \r\n</p><p>10.      <strong>  Although </strong><em>Prewitt</em> was a § 501 case, its rationale for placing the burden of proving\r\ninability to accommodate on the employer was based on an article discussing the burden under\r\na § 504 cause of action.  <em>Prewitt</em>, 662 F.2d at 308 (citing Donald J. Olenick, <em>Accommodating\r\nthe Handicapped: Rehabilitating Section 504 After Southeastern</em>, 80 Colum. L. Rev. 171, 187-88 (1980)).\r\n</p><p>11.      <strong>  Appellants followed with a request for an additional instruction to question 1, citing\r\n</strong><em>Chevron v. Redmon</em>, 745 S.W.2d 314, 318 (Tex. 1987), for the proposition that no cause of\r\naction exists under § 21.051 if a person's disability impairs her ability to do the particular job\r\nfor which she was hired.  Apparently, appellants were attempting to limit the jury's\r\nconsideration of any accommodation based on job reassignment.  This request further indicates\r\nthat they may have believed question 1 encompassed the theory of failure to accommodate.</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tWe also note that although an employer need not find another job for a disabled\r\nemployee no longer qualified for her present position, under federal law some job\r\nreassignment or assignment to \"alternative employment opportunities\" consistent with the\r\nemployer's existing policies may be required.  While reserving opinion on the accuracy or\r\ndesirability of the policy, we note that some authority suggests an employer's duty of\r\naccommodation may not extend this far under the Texas Act.  <em>Compare Arline</em>, 480 U.S. at\r\n289 n.19 <em>with </em><em>Chiari</em>, 920 F.2d at 319 (citing <em>Chevron</em>, 745 S.W.2d at 318, for proposition\r\nthat Texas Act does not impose duty of reassignment).\r\n</span></p></strong></p></strong></p></strong></p>\r\n</div>",

During the two-week\r\norientation preceding her initial assignment, Kitchen, who suffers from epilepsy, had a seizure\r\nthat disoriented her for several minutes.<strong><sup> (1)</sup></strong>  Following her seizure, CAPS Administrator Eddie\r\nMcQueary gave Kitchen a \"Physical Capacity Report\" for her doctor to complete.  The\r\nneurologist who had treated Kitchen's epilepsy for ten years, Dr. Vincent Virgadamo, indicated\r\non the form that Kitchen was capable of the job activities listed on the report,<strong><sup> (2)</sup></strong> provided that\r\n\"seizure precautions\" were taken.  To clarify the meaning of \"seizure precautions,\" McQueary\r\ngave Kitchen a second physical capacity report for Virgadamo to complete.  This second report\r\ndid not specifically request Virgadamo to explain the phrase \"seizure precautions,\" but it did ask\r\nhim to verify that Kitchen could be alert 100 percent of the time.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter faxing the second report, Kitchen had a telephone conversation with her\r\nfather and Virgadamo in which Virgadamo expressed reservations about the report.  He asked\r\nKitchen to have someone at ASH call him.  On January 24, 1991, Kitchen relayed Virgadamo's\r\nconcerns to McQueary and authorized an ASH physician to contact Virgadamo.  McQueary\r\ntestified that he gave Kitchen a deadline of January 25 at 3:00 p.m. for the return of the second\r\nreport.  When the report was not returned by the deadline, McQueary sent Kitchen to ASH's\r\nAssistant Superintendent, Adolph Supak, with the recommendation that she be terminated for\r\ninsubordination.  Supak terminated Kitchen's employment that day.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThere was conflicting testimony at trial about whether Kitchen had requested an\r\naccommodation and the extent to which ASH accommodated employees by reassigning them to\r\nother open positions within the organization.  In addition to maintaining that Kitchen never\r\nformally requested an accommodation, ASH asserted through McQueary that an accommodation\r\nwas not warranted unless Virgadamo refused to sign the second physical capacity report. \r\nAlternatively, ASH argued that absent clarification from Virgadamo, it was unable to determine\r\nwhat accommodation was necessary to render Kitchen \"otherwise qualified\" for the position and\r\nwhether such accommodation was reasonable.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center><strong>STATUTORY FRAMEWORK</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tKitchen brought her complaint pursuant to the former Texas Commission on\r\nHuman Rights Act (the \"Act\"), now found at chapter 21 of the Texas Labor Code.  <em>See</em> Tex.

Instead, federal policy regarding\r\nemployment discrimination based on disability is found in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29\r\nU.S.C. §§ 701-797b (1988 &amp; Supp. V 1993), and the Americans with Disabilities Act (the\r\n\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213 (Supp. V 1993).  Consequently, we look to the most closely\r\nanalogous provisions of these laws in interpreting our state's Act with regard to disability\r\ndiscrimination.<strong><sup> (5)</sup></strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOur review of the relevant federal statutes convinces us that the jurisprudence\r\ndeveloped under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act is most applicable to Kitchen's case.  <em>See</em>\r\n29 U.S.C. § 794 (1988 &amp; Supp. V 1993).<strong><sup> (6)</sup></strong>  Section 504 provides in pertinent part:  \"No otherwise\r\nqualified individual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be\r\nexcluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination in . .\r\n. any [federally funded] program or activity . . . .\"  <em>Id.</em> § 794(a) (1988).  Sections 21.051 and\r\n21.105 of the Texas Act make it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discharge\r\na disabled person on the basis of a disability when the disability does not impair the individual's\r\nability to reasonably perform a job.  Tex. Lab. Code Ann. §§ 21.051, .105 (West 1995). \r\nFacially, the Act more closely resembles section 504's broad prohibition against discrimination\r\nthan the prohibitions of other federal statutes that explicitly address an employer's failure to\r\naccommodate.  For example, the ADA includes provisions regarding \"reasonable\r\naccommodation,\" which resemble the Texas Act after its amendment in 1993, but do not parallel\r\nas closely the wording of the Texas statute that governed Kitchen's cause of action.<strong><sup> (7)</sup></strong></span><span>  However,\r\neven section 504 incorporates the question of reasonable accommodation as part of the inquiry into\r\nwhether an individual is \"otherwise qualified.\"  <em>School Bd. of Nassau County v.

The first two asked the jury to\r\ndecide issues related to Kitchen's claim.  Relevant portions of the questions and accompanying\r\ninstructions are:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><span>Question No. 1</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tDo you find from a preponderance of the evidence that [ASH and\r\nTDMHMR] discharged [Kitchen] because of her disability?  A \"yes\"\r\nanswer must be based on a preponderance of the evidence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tYou are instructed that [Kitchen] has a disability under Texas law.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tYou are further instructed that \"because of disability\" means discrimination\r\nbecause of or on the basis of a physical or mental condition that does not\r\nimpair an individual's ability to reasonably perform a job.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tANSWER:  No.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIf you answered \"no\" to Question No. 1, please answer Question No. 2. \r\nOtherwise, go on to Question No. 3.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><span>Question No. 2</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tDo you find from a preponderance of the evidence that [ASH and\r\nTDMHMR] could not have reasonably accommodated [Kitchen] in her\r\nemployment at the Austin State Hospital?  Answer \"They could not have\"\r\nor \"They could have.\"  An answer of \"They could not have\" must be based\r\non a preponderance of the evidence.  If you do not find a preponderance of\r\nthe evidence supports an answer of \"They could not have,\" then answer\r\n\"They could have.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIn connection with this issue, you are instructed that \"reasonable\r\naccommodation\" means steps, modifications, or adjustments that would\r\npermit a person to perform a job with safety and efficiency.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tYou are further instructed that in order to find that a person could not\r\nperform a job with safety, there must be a reasonable probability that her\r\njob performance would result in substantial harm to herself or others.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tYou are further instructed in connection with this issue that factors in\r\ndetermining whether a reasonable accommodation of a person with a\r\ndisability can be made include reasonableness of the cost of any necessary\r\nworkplace accommodation and the availability of alternatives.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tANSWER:  They could have.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tASH and TDMHMR raised several objections to this charge at the initial charge\r\nconference.  First, they objected to the inclusion of question 2, arguing that the statute as it\r\nexisted at the time of Kitchen's suit did not impose a requirement of reasonable accommodation\r\nupon the employer.  Second, appellants objected to the instruction that the jury answer question\r\n2 even if they answered \"no\" to question 1.  Appellants insisted that the jury should reach\r\nquestion 2 <em>only if</em> they found in question 1 that Kitchen had been discharged because of her\r\ndisability.  In effect, appellants' objections demonstrate that they understood the issue in question\r\n2 to be an affirmative defense, not a second theory under which Kitchen could prove\r\ndiscrimination based on a disability.<strong><sup> (8)</sup></strong></span><span>  This impression is strengthened by appellants' request for\r\na trial amendment to their pleading adding the affirmative defense of \"undue burden,\" which the\r\ncourt granted.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter a lunch recess, but before the jury was returned, appellants again objected\r\nto the court's charge.  Apparently realizing that question 2 referred to a separate theory of\r\nrecovery and not an affirmative defense, appellants objected that the burden of proof on the\r\naccommodation issue in question 2 improperly rested with them and not with Kitchen.  The court\r\noverruled the objection, saying that it came too late or should be overruled on the merits.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter the jury returned its verdict, Kitchen moved for judgment and requested a\r\nsupplemental finding from the trial court that \"[ASH and TDMHMR] failed reasonably to\r\naccommodate [Kitchen] in her employment at Austin State Hospital.\"  Kitchen averred as required\r\nunder Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 279 that this finding was a necessary element of her theory\r\nof recovery for failure to provide reasonable accommodation, that the finding was supported by\r\nlegally and factually sufficient evidence, and that neither party requested submission nor objected\r\nto the nonsubmission of this element.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. Civ. P. 279.  Appellants responded that\r\nKitchen was asking the court to deem a theory of recovery to which they had objected, and which\r\nKitchen had waived by omitting it from the charge.  <em>See Ramos v. Frito-Lay, Inc.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1637025\"><a href=\"/opinion/1637025/ramos-v-frito-lay-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">784</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">667</span></a></span>, 668 (Tex. 1990).  Appellants further requested that the trial court disregard the jury's\r\nfindings to questions 2 and 3, arguing that the jury's answer to question 1 resolved the issue of\r\ntheir liability against Kitchen and that question 2 was no more than an affirmative defense which\r\nbecame irrelevant.  The trial court granted Kitchen's motion for supplemental findings and\r\nrendered judgment in her favor.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThis appeal asks us to decide (1) which party bears the burden of proof on the issue\r\nof reasonable accommodation in an action for employment discrimination based on a theory of\r\nfailure to accommodate, (2) whether that burden was properly allocated in this case, and if not (3)\r\nwhether error was properly preserved so as to prevent a deemed finding on the issue by the trial\r\ncourt.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe United States Supreme Court in two decisive cases has carefully outlined the\r\nallocation of the burdens of proof and production that apply to Title VII discrimination cases.  <em>See\r\nTexas Dep't of Community Affairs v.

Hinds</em>, 38 Tex. Sup. Ct.\r\nJ. 711 (June 8, 1995).  Key to our resolution of the instant dispute is the Court's holding that\r\n\"[t]he ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated\r\nagainst the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff.\"  <em>Burdine</em>, 450 U.S. at 253.  As the\r\nCourt explained, however, the intermediate burdens of production alternate between the plaintiff\r\nand the defendant and serve to eliminate claims at an earlier stage if no fact dispute exists that\r\nrequires the court or jury to reach this ultimate question.  <em>Id.</em> at 253-55.<strong><sup> (9)</sup></strong></span><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe <em>Burdine</em> system of burden allocation clearly applies to those situations in which\r\nan employer denies that an individual's disability played any role in its employment decision.  <em>See,\r\ne.g.</em>, <em>Barth v. Gelb</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"628594\"><a href=\"/opinion/628594/donald-barth-v-bruce-s-gelb-director-united-states-information-agency/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1180</span></a></span>, 1186 (D.C. Cir. 1993).  In many cases of disability\r\ndiscrimination like Kitchen's, however, the employer may concede that the employee's disability\r\nplayed a role in its employment decision, but the parties disagree whether the disability impedes\r\nthe employee's ability to perform the \"essential functions\" of the job or whether a reasonable\r\naccommodation is feasible that would enable the employee to perform the job.  <em>Id.</em>  The <em>Burdine</em>\r\ntest is somewhat inappropriate in these situations because the propriety of the employment\r\ndecision turns on the objective claims of the parties that accommodation was or was not possible\r\nrather than on the employer's subjective motivation.  <em>Id.</em>  Nonetheless, the basic principle is\r\nconstant: the burden remains with the plaintiff to prove her case of employment discrimination\r\nby a preponderance of the evidence.  <em>Id.</em>; <em>see also Hinds</em>, 38 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. at 717; <em>Mason v.\r\nFrank</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"676110\"><a href=\"/opinion/676110/james-jimmie-mason-v-anthony-m-frank-postmaster-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span>, 318 (8th Cir. 1994).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn a cause of action alleging failure to accommodate, part of plaintiff's burden is\r\nto demonstrate that she is \"otherwise qualified\" for the position from which she was excluded. \r\nShe may show this qualification in one of two ways:  (1) by proving that she can perform all\r\nessential job functions without modifications or accommodations, or (2) that some reasonable\r\naccommodation by the employer would enable her to perform the job.  29 C.F.R. § 1613.702(f)\r\n(defining qualified handicapped person under § 504 of Rehabilitation Act as one who \"with or\r\nwithout reasonable accommodation can perform the essential functions of the position in question\r\nwithout endangering the health and safety of the individual or others\"); <em>Arline</em>, 480 U.S. at 288\r\nn.17; <em>Mantolete v.

Although there appears to be\r\nconsensus among the federal courts to this extent, opinions diverge on whether the plaintiff or the\r\ndefendant employer then bears the burden of persuading the trier of fact that accommodations are\r\nor are not possible.  <em>Compare Barth</em>, 2 F.3d at 1186-87<em> and Chandler v.

Reilly</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593231\"><a href=\"/opinion/593231/edward-b-overton-v-william-k-reilly-administrator-environmental/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1190</span></a></span>,\r\n1194 (7th Cir. 1992).  However, even that court acknowledges a lack of consensus on the\r\nallocation of burden to prove reasonable accommodation under section 504.  <em>Id.</em>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe issue is further complicated by the availability of the \"undue hardship\" defense. \r\nOnce the plaintiff has shown that a method of accommodation would allow her to perform the\r\nessentials of the job, the defendant employer has two options: it may either attempt to refute the\r\nplaintiff's evidence by demonstrating that the plaintiff would be unable to perform the essentials\r\nof the job despite the proposed accommodation, or it may assume the burden of proving that the\r\nproposed accommodation imposes on it an undue financial, logistic, or administrative burden. \r\n<em>See Barth</em>, 2 F.3d at 1186-87.  As with other affirmative defenses, the defendant bears the burden\r\nof proof for the undue hardship defense.  <em>Id.</em>  However, as the <em>Barth</em> court noted, \"a grey area\"\r\narises if a proposed accommodation is both unduly burdensome and unreasonable.  <em>Id.</em>  We\r\nbelieve the confusion is lessened if the \"reasonableness\" of the accommodation is evaluated in\r\nterms of the plaintiff's ability to do the job, while the question of \"undue hardship\" is linked to\r\nthe employer's financial and organizational ability to adopt the proposed modifications.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tUnder this analysis, the plaintiff clearly retains the burden of proving by a\r\npreponderance of the evidence that an accommodation is possible that would enable her to perform\r\nthe \"essential functions\" of the position she holds or seeks.  <em>Id.</em>; <em>Chandler</em>, 2 F.3d at 1395; 29\r\nC.F.R. §§ 1613.702(f), .704(a)-(b).  By demonstrating that she could be reasonably\r\naccommodated, the plaintiff proves that she is \"otherwise qualified\" for or can, under the Texas\r\nAct, \"reasonably perform a job.\"  Tex. Lab. Code Ann. § 21.015; <em>Chiari</em>, 920 F.2d at 319.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe court's charge in the instant cause essentially collapsed into one question the\r\nissue of reasonable accommodation, on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof, and the issue\r\nof undue hardship, an affirmative defense on which the defendant bears the burden of proof.  The\r\ncourt subsumed the question of whether Kitchen was \"otherwise qualified\" by instructing the jury\r\nthat a reasonable accommodation was one that \"would permit a person to perform a job with\r\nsafety and efficiency\" and without \"substantial harm to herself or others.\"  However, the court\r\nsimultaneously instructed the jury to consider the cost of the accommodation and availability of\r\nalternatives in deciding whether an accommodation could be made--factors a defendant would argue\r\nin support of its affirmative defense that a particular accommodation is unduly burdensome.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAlthough the caselaw suffers from a lack of clarity in setting forth the elements and\r\nburdens in a discrimination action based on a failure to accommodate, and although appellants\r\nfailed to object to the charge as artfully as they might have, we believe their objections were\r\nsufficient to preserve error.  The objections clearly demonstrate that appellants believed question\r\n2 to be an affirmative defense.  Appellants find further support for their contention because the\r\nquestion placed the burden of proof on them and because the instruction on the cost of\r\naccommodation and availability of alternatives tracks the statutory language of section 21.260,\r\ninstructing the court to consider \"the undue hardship <em>defense</em>.\"  <em>See</em> Tex. Lab. Code Ann. §\r\n21.260 (emphasis added). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMoreover, question 1 broadly asked whether appellants discharged Kitchen because\r\nof her disability, with instructions tracking the language of sections 21.051 and 21.105.  Once\r\ntheir objection that the Act contained no accommodation requirement until the 1993 amendments\r\nwas overruled, appellants may have believed that question 1 incorporated both disparate treatment\r\nand failure to accommodate theories of recovery, with question 2 remaining their affirmative\r\ndefense.<strong><sup> (11)</sup></strong></span><span>  As appellants cogently argue, if question 1 incorporates the failure to accommodate\r\ntheory of recovery, the jury's negative finding on this question absolves them of liability.  Even\r\nKitchen admits in a post-submission brief that \"[f]ailure to make reasonable accommodation is\r\nitself disability discrimination.\"  Kitchen's petition alleged only general \"disability discrimination\"\r\nwithout outlining the separate theories of disparate treatment and failure to accommodate. \r\nTherefore, although we do not believe that Kitchen's failure to amend her petition to reflect her\r\ntwo theories precludes her recovery under the statute at that time, her failure to separately plead\r\nthe theories certainly lends credence to appellants' interpretation of question 1 as incorporating\r\nboth theories.  However, because question 2 related clearly to neither an affirmative defense nor\r\nto the special issue of accommodation, we decline to render judgment for appellants on the basis\r\nof the jury's answer to question 1.  <em>See Spencer v. Eagle Star Ins. Co.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2455735\"><a href=\"/opinion/2455735/spencer-v-eagle-star-ins-co-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span>, 157\r\n(Tex. 1994).  We therefore overrule appellants' first point of error urging that the trial court erred\r\nby refusing to disregard the jury's answers to questions 2 and 3.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe do believe, however, that Kitchen bore the burden of proving that reasonable\r\naccommodation was possible in order to show that she was \"otherwise qualified,\" and that\r\nappellants were entitled to raise the affirmative defense that the accommodation she proposed was\r\nunduly burdensome.  Given the confusion in the statute, caselaw, and instructions in this case, it\r\nis not surprising that appellants failed to realize that question 2 embodied Kitchen's second theory\r\nof recovery, not their affirmative defense, and failed to object to the misplaced burden of proof\r\nat the original charge conference.  The question remains whether the objection was timely.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTexas Rule of Civil Procedure 272 requires the court to allow counsel for the\r\nparties \"a reasonable time\" to inspect and raise objections to the charge.  The rule establishes as\r\nan outside limit that all objections be presented \"before the charge is read to the jury.\"  Tex. R.\r\nCiv. P. 272.  Kitchen argues that the trial court has discretion to set the time allowed for\r\nobjections to the jury charge.  <em>See Hargrove v. Texas Employers' Ins.

Although the\r\ncases Kitchen cites generally support the proposition that a trial court has discretion to set the\r\namount of time counsel has to inspect and object to the charge, those cases are not on point.  In\r\n<em>Hargrove</em> and <em>Burton</em>, counsel failed to raise objections or request instructions until the court had\r\nbegun to read the charge to the jury.  <em>Hargrove</em>, 332 S.W.2d at 123; <em>Burton</em>, 195 S.W.2d at 249. \r\nAt that point, under the current rules, the trial court no longer had discretion to consider the\r\nrequests or objections.  <em>Methodist Hosps. of Dallas v. Corporate Communicators, Inc.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1519083\"><a href=\"/opinion/1519083/methodist-hospitals-of-dallas-v-corporate-com-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">806</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">879</span></a></span>, 884-85 (Tex. App.--Dallas 1991, writ denied).  In <em>Tubbe</em>, the court found that\r\nappellant failed to show harm because he was able to prepare all of his objections in the hour and\r\na half the court allowed.  <em>Tubbe</em>, 180 S.W.2d at 477.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe purpose of Rule 272 is to allow the court to correct any errors in the charge\r\nbefore submitting it to the jury.  <em>Methodist Hosps.</em>, 806 S.W.2d at 884.  In the instant cause, the\r\ncourt did not set in advance a deadline for submitting requests or objections, and appellants raised\r\ntheir objections before the jury returned to receive the charge.  Moreover, the trial court did not\r\nrely solely on a procedural technicality in overruling appellants' objection.  Although it\r\nadmonished appellants that the objection came too late, the court also stated that the objection was\r\noverruled even if timely.  Because the trial court clearly considered the substance of appellants'\r\ncomplaint, we believe that appellants have satisfied the requirement for preserving error in the\r\njury charge as articulated by the Texas Supreme Court.  <em>See State Dep't of Highways &amp; Pub.\r\nTransp. v. Payne</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1747332\"><a href=\"/opinion/1747332/state-dept-highways-v-payne/\"><span class=\"volume\">838</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">235</span></a></span>, 241 (Tex. 1992) (\"There should be but one test for\r\ndetermining if a party has preserved error in the jury charge, and that is <em>whether the party made\r\nthe trial court aware of the complaint, timely and plainly, and obtained a ruling</em>.\") (emphasis\r\nadded); <em>Hinds</em>, 38 Tex.

Civ. App.--Amarillo 1977, writ ref'd n.r.e.).  Contrary to Kitchen's assertions, the evidence\r\ndid not establish conclusively that appellants failed to reasonably accommodate her; although the\r\njury certainly may have determined on this record that ASH's conduct in Kitchen's dismissal\r\nlacked good faith, the burden was Kitchen's to persuade the jury that reasonable accommodations\r\nwere possible that would have rendered her otherwise qualified for her position.  Similarly, issues\r\nrelating to appellants' affirmative defense of \"undue burden\" should have been more clearly\r\narticulated and allocated to a separate question.  Accordingly, we sustain appellants' second point\r\nof error.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe hold that Kitchen bore the burden of proving that reasonable accommodation\r\nwas possible as part of her burden of establishing that she was otherwise qualified for her position\r\nat ASH.  Appellants properly attempted through their objections to segregate the issue of\r\nreasonable accommodation on which Kitchen bore the burden of proof and their affirmative\r\ndefense that any accommodation was unduly burdensome.  Because appellants' objections were\r\nsufficient to preserve error, the trial court should not have deemed the finding that appellants\r\nfailed to reasonably accommodate Kitchen.  We therefore reverse the judgment of the trial court\r\nand remand the cause for new trial on Kitchen's claim of failure to accommodate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t<span>                                                               </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\tBea Ann Smith, Justice</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Before Justices Powers, Jones and B.

Kitchen herself testified that the seizure was typical of other seizures\r\nshe has had.\r\n<p>2.      <strong>  McQueary also apparently gave Kitchen a copy of the job description for her\r\nposition, which she failed to forward to Virgadamo.\r\n<p>3.      <strong>  At the time of trial, the Act was found at Texas Revised Civil Statutes article 5221k. \r\nBecause the recodification of the Act in the Labor Code effected no substantive change in\r\nthe law, we cite the current code for convenience.  </strong><em>See</em> Act of May 12, 1993, 73d Leg.,\r\nR.S., ch. 269, §§ 5, 6, 1993 Tex. Gen. Laws 987, 1273.\r\n</p><p>4.      <strong>  When it recodified the Act in the Labor Code, the legislature concurrently amended\r\nthe Act to make an employer's failure or refusal to furnish reasonable workplace\r\naccommodation an unlawful employment practice.  </strong><em>See</em> Act of May 14, 1993, 73d Leg.,\r\nR.S., ch. 276, § 5.17, 1993 Tex. Gen. Laws 1285, 1288-89.  However, the amended\r\nprovisions apply only to complaints filed with the Commission on Human Rights on or after\r\nSeptember 1, 1993.  <em>Id.</em> at 1292.  Kitchen filed her complaint with the Commission on Human\r\nRights on February 8, 1991.\r\n</p><p>5.      <strong>  Although they provide distinct statutory bases for bringing claims of employment\r\ndiscrimination, federal courts have looked to Title VII precedent in interpreting the\r\nRehabilitation Act of 1973.  </strong><em>See, e.g.</em>, <em>Barth v. Gelb</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"628594\"><a href=\"/opinion/628594/donald-barth-v-bruce-s-gelb-director-united-states-information-agency/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1180</span></a></span>, 1183-84 (D.C. Cir. 1993)\r\n(looking to Title VII precedent on religious discrimination).  In turn, the ADA adopts the\r\npowers, remedies, and procedures of Title VII and directs the agencies with enforcement\r\nauthority under the ADA to \"develop procedures to ensure that administrative complaints filed\r\nunder [the ADA] and under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 are dealt with in a manner that\r\navoids duplication of effort and prevents imposition of inconsistent or conflicting standards.\" \r\n42 U.S.C. § 12117(b) (Supp. V 1993); <em>see also</em> 29 U.S.C. §§ 791(g), 794(d) (synchronizing\r\nstandards used to determine violations under the Rehabilitation Act with those employed under\r\nthe ADA).\r\n</p><p>6.      <strong>  As codified, sections 501 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 appear at 29\r\nU.S.C. §§ 791 and 794, respectively.  Because most cases refer to these sections by their\r\nact rather than code designations, we will follow this convention.\r\n<p>7.      <strong>  The ADA includes in its definition of \"discrimination\" a failure to make \"reasonable\r\naccommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified\r\nindividual with a disability.\"  </strong><em>See </em>ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A) (Supp. V 1993).  The\r\nADA also defines \"qualified individual with a disability\" as an individual who \"with or\r\nwithout reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment\r\nposition that such individual holds or desires.\"  <em>Id.</em> § 12111(8).  Finally, the ADA explicitly\r\ndefines \"reasonable accommodation.\"  <em>See id. </em>§ 12111(9).  Because the ADA refers directly to\r\nthe issue of \"reasonable accommodation,\" it more closely resembles the Texas provisions\r\nfollowing the enactment of § 5.17 of the Labor Code.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tSection 501 of the Rehabilitation Act is also inapposite as a guide because it imposes an\r\naffirmative duty on employers which finds no counterpart in the Texas Act.  Section 501\r\nrequires <em>federal</em> employers to submit an \"affirmative action program plan for the hiring,\r\nplacement and advancement of individuals with disabilities\" including \"a description of the\r\nextent to which <em>and methods whereby</em> the special needs of employees who are individuals with\r\ndisabilities are being met.\"  29 U.S.C. § 791(b) (1988) (emphasis added); <em>see also</em> <em>Mantolete\r\nv. Bolger</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"455825\"><a href=\"/opinion/455825/bonnie-mantolete-v-william-g-bolger-in-his-capacity-as-postmaster/\"><span class=\"volume\">767</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1416</span></a></span>, 1421 (9th Cir. 1985) (observing § 501's explicit requirement that\r\naccommodation of the handicap be considered in determining handicapped person's\r\nqualification for employment); <em>Prewitt v. United States Postal Serv.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"396212\"><a href=\"/opinion/396212/george-dunbar-prewitt-jr-v-united-states-postal-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">662</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></a></span>, 307 (5th\r\nCir. 1981) (same).  As appellants note, this affirmative duty to create an action program under\r\n§ 501 may shift the burden to the defendant employer to show that no reasonable\r\naccommodation was possible.  <em>See Overton v. Reilly</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593231\"><a href=\"/opinion/593231/edward-b-overton-v-william-k-reilly-administrator-environmental/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1190</span></a></span>, 1194 (7th Cir. 1992).\r\n<p>8.      <strong>  Appellants made a further objection in regard to question 3 that reinforces this\r\ninterpretation.  Question 3 asked the jury to award Kitchen attorney's fees if they\r\nanswered either \"yes\" to question 1 </strong><em>or</em> \"they could have\" to question 2.  Appellants requested\r\nthe instruction to read that the jury proceed to question 3 only if they answered question 1\r\naffirmatively <em>and</em> found the appellants could have accommodated Kitchen in question 2.\r\n</p><p>9.      <strong>  In </strong><em>Burdine</em> the Court applied these burdens of proof and production in a case alleging\r\ndisparate treatment discrimination, i.e., the blatant discrimination that stems from simple bias\r\nagainst the characteristic in question.  The plaintiff must first establish her prima facie case,\r\ndemonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that she was qualified for the position and\r\nthat the circumstances of termination give rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination. \r\n<em>Burdine</em>, 450 U.S. at 253.  If established, the prima facie case creates a presumption that the\r\nemployer unlawfully discriminated against the employee.  <em>Id.</em> at 254.  The burden then shifts\r\nto the defendant employer to produce evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact that its\r\nemployment action was not the result of discriminatory animus but instead was motivated by a\r\nlegitimate reason.  <em>Id.</em>  In so doing, the defendant employer rebuts the presumption raised by\r\nthe plaintiff's prima facie case and frames the factual issue requiring ultimate resolution by the\r\ntrier of fact.  The burden of production then returns to the plaintiff and merges with her\r\nultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the employer's proffered reason for its\r\naction is mere pretext and that she has been the victim of unlawful discrimination.  <em>Id.</em> at 255. \r\n</p><p>10.      <strong>  Although </strong><em>Prewitt</em> was a § 501 case, its rationale for placing the burden of proving\r\ninability to accommodate on the employer was based on an article discussing the burden under\r\na § 504 cause of action.  <em>Prewitt</em>, 662 F.2d at 308 (citing Donald J. Olenick, <em>Accommodating\r\nthe Handicapped: Rehabilitating Section 504 After Southeastern</em>, 80 Colum. L. Rev. 171, 187-88 (1980)).\r\n</p><p>11.      <strong>  Appellants followed with a request for an additional instruction to question 1, citing\r\n</strong><em>Chevron v. Redmon</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2467432\"><a href=\"/opinion/2467432/chevron-corp-v-redmon/\"><span class=\"volume\">745</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span>, 318 (Tex. 1987), for the proposition that no cause of\r\naction exists under § 21.051 if a person's disability impairs her ability to do the particular job\r\nfor which she was hired.  Apparently, appellants were attempting to limit the jury's\r\nconsideration of any accommodation based on job reassignment.  This request further indicates\r\nthat they may have believed question 1 encompassed the theory of failure to accommodate.</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tWe also note that although an employer need not find another job for a disabled\r\nemployee no longer qualified for her present position, under federal law some job\r\nreassignment or assignment to \"alternative employment opportunities\" consistent with the\r\nemployer's existing policies may be required.  While reserving opinion on the accuracy or\r\ndesirability of the policy, we note that some authority suggests an employer's duty of\r\naccommodation may not extend this far under the Texas Act.  <em>Compare Arline</em>, 480 U.S. at\r\n289 n.19 <em>with </em><em>Chiari</em>, 920 F.2d at 319 (citing <em>Chevron</em>, 745 S.W.2d at 318, for proposition\r\nthat Texas Act does not impose duty of reassignment).\r\n</span></p></strong></p></strong></p></strong></p>\r\n</div>",
