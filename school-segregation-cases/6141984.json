Finding no\n\nprejudicial error, we affirm.\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\n                                              FACTS\n\n                                         I. BACKGROUND\n\n       In January 2011, police arrested district school bus driver Shafer for molesting three district\n\nstudents—NL, VV, and TC—and for possessing child pornography. In August, Shafer pleaded\n\nguilty as charged and was sentenced to 175 months in prison. In June 2014, the Appellants, parents\n\nof DH, a fourth district student whom Shafer had also molested, sued the District for gross\n\nnegligence, negligence, and negligent infliction of emotional distress based upon the District’s\n\nfailure to prevent Shafer from abusing DH.\n\n                      II. SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND EVIDENTIARY MOTION\n\n       In September 2015, the Appellants moved for summary judgment on the issue of the\n\nDistrict’s liability on the ground that collateral estoppel applied. The trial court denied the\n\nsummary judgment motion, ruling that collateral estoppel did not apply.\n\n       In October, the Appellants moved to have the trial court admit the complaint and the\n\nDistrict’s admissions of negligence and gross negligence in Crunkleton v. Olympia School District1\n\nas substantive evidence under ER 801(d)(2).2 In response, the District argued that the Crunkleton\n\n\n\n1\n  Following Shafer’s convictions, NL, VV, TC, and their families or guardians brought three civil\nlawsuits against the District—Gutierrez v. Olympia School District, noted at 184 Wn. App. 1059,\n2014 WL 6984636, review denied, 183 Wn.2d 1004 (2015), Villarreal v. Olympia School District,\nNo. 11-2-01970-2, Thurston County Super. Ct., and Crunkleton v. Olympia School District, No.\n12-2-02039-3, Thurston County Super. Ct. The Gutierrez plaintiffs prevailed at trial and were\nawarded $1.4 million in damages. The Villarreal plaintiffs obtained summary judgment against\nthe District on the issue of breach of duty. And in Crunkleton, the District admitted liability,\nalthough it contested the amount of damages. Whether damages were awarded in the latter two\ncases is not in the record before us.\n2\n ER 801(d)(2) excludes from the definition of hearsay a party opponent’s admissions when the\nadmissions are offered against the party opponent.\n\n                                                 2\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\ndocuments were not admissions under ER 801(d)(2) and, alternatively, that the Crunkleton\n\ndocuments were inadmissible under ER 403. The trial court denied the Appellants’ motion and\n\ntheir subsequent motion for reconsideration.\n\n                                 III. OTHER PRETRIAL PROCEEDINGS\n\n        Trial was set for November 30. In the months preceding trial, the District represented that\n\nit would contest liability at trial. The parties disputed the division of trial time, with the Appellants\n\nrequesting either that trial be allowed to proceed until both parties had fully presented their cases\n\nor a 60/40 allocation with the possibility of extending trial.\n\n        On November 24, the parties appeared for a pretrial hearing, and both the Appellants and\n\nthe District informed the trial court that they were prepared for trial on November 30. The\n\nAppellants told the trial court that when they had agreed that eight days was appropriate, they had\n\n“always assumed that the District would . . . admit[] liability or that it would be otherwise\n\nestablished.” Report of Proceedings (RP) (Nov. 24, 2015) at 9. In response, the trial court stated\n\nthat “I understand the [Appellants] made some assumptions about admissions by the [District], but\n\nit’s pretty late, and there’s been no motions to the Court to ask for extra time other than a very\n\nrecent motion to either divide the trial time in a particular way or give you extra days, and it’s not\n\npossible at this stage.” RP (Nov. 24, 2015) at 10. The District subsequently sought a continuance\n\nof the trial date, which the Appellants “vehemently oppose[d]” and the trial court denied. Clerk’s\n\nPapers (CP) at 6864.3\n\n\n\n3\n  The Appellants’ witness list included multiple damages experts. In the first week of trial, the\nAppellants moved for two additional days of trial time to present their case, including three of the\ndamages experts’ testimony. The trial court granted the Appellants only an additional half day\nbecause in its view, the Appellants had run out of time because they “made some assumptions that\nthe case would shrink before it started and that eight days would be sufficient.” 6 RP at 1177.\n                                                 3\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\n                                            IV. TRIAL\n\n                             A. APPELLANTS’ LIABILITY TESTIMONY\n\n       Shafer testified that he was a district employee who had joined the District as a bus driver\n\nin 2005. Shafer explained that at least once a week, in order to groom children, he rode along on\n\nbuses driven by other district drivers. Beginning in the fall or early winter of 2010, Shafer\n\nmolested DH three times. DH suffers from a congenital condition known as Trisomy X.4 Shafer\n\nassumed that due to her condition, DH would be “less likely . . . to tell on” Shafer. 2 RP at 325.\n\nThe first two times, Shafer molested DH while Shafer rode along on DH’s bus. The third time,\n\nShafer drove DH’s bus, and he pulled the bus over in order to molest DH.\n\n       District employees described a failure to train bus drivers to recognize the signs of\n\ngrooming and sexual molestation and a lack of procedures documenting when other bus drivers\n\nwould ride along on a bus. The district superintendent admitted that after a driver had been fired\n\nin 2009 for misconduct, Shafer’s supervisors should have been “on the lookout.” 4 RP at 644.\n\nDocumenting ride-alongs would have helped district employees to recognize when there was an\n\nunusual pattern or behavior by a bus driver. And the Appellants’ expert witness testified that the\n\nDistrict did not meet the standard of care in Washington when it hired Shafer.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the trial court, the “[Appellants] had information well before trial that the case had\nnot been narrowed in terms of the issues and nonetheless did not seek a continuance, knowing that\nthe case had been confirmed for eight trial days.” 6 RP at 1177.\n4\n DH’s mother testified that DH’s Trisomy X caused her to have delayed speech, language, and\nmotor skills, to have a slightly lowered IQ, and to be shy.\n\n                                                4\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\n                                    B. DAMAGES TESTIMONY\n\n1.     APPELLANTS’ TESTIMONY\n\n       DH’s mother explained that in November or December 2010, four-year-old DH, who rode\n\na special needs bus, had been dropped off by a school bus driven by two men. DH was not smiling,\n\nwhich her mother noted was “different,” and right away, DH asked her mother, “‘Why that man\n\ntouch my bottom?’” 7 RP at 1231. DH was “really upset,” “moody,” and “off” that afternoon—\n\nso much so that DH’s father returned home early from work because he was concerned—although\n\nDH’s behavior eventually returned to normal and her parents attributed her behavior that afternoon\n\nto a “misunderstanding.” 7 RP at 1232.\n\n       DH’s mother called DH’s preschool teacher, Simona McEwen, who testified that DH’s\n\nstatement about a man touching her had “stood out to” McEwen at the time. 9 RP at 1721. In\n\nMcEwen’s view, it was remarkable for DH to utter such a long sentence because DH typically\n\nspoke in “pretty short sentences.” 9 RP at 1721. DH refused to ride the bus after the incident.\n\nAfter DH began kindergarten, approximately three years after the molestations, her toilet training\n\nregressed, and at home, she had tantrums and was destructive and abusive to the family pets. DH\n\nbegan to act out sexually between second and third grade to the point that DH’s parents felt that\n\nshe was “out of control.” 7 RP at 1268.\n\n       According to DH’s mother, DH’s behavior was “stressful,” caused DH’s parents to have\n\nmarital problems, and led DH’s mother to worry that DH’s sexual behavior would cause her future\n\nproblems. 7 RP at 1275. It was not until May 2011, when police informed DH’s mother that\n\nShafer had admitted to molesting a child on DH’s bus, that DH’s mother learned that Shafer had\n\npotentially molested DH. DH’s mother testified that she believed that DH was the child that Shafer\n\n\n                                                5\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\nhad molested and that the news emotionally upset her, so that she “felt like [her] whole world was\n\ncoming down.” 7 RP at 1237. She felt “[l]ike [she had] not been a good mom . . . [b]ecause this\n\nhappened to [DH]” and because she “didn’t follow up.” 7 RP at 1274-75. DH’s mother explained\n\nthat she had preexisting depression.\n\n       Jon Conte, the Appellants’ “sex abuse trauma expert,” also briefly testified regarding DH’s\n\nmother’s damages. 1 RP at 66. Conte opined that DH’s mother suffered as a result of DH’s\n\nabuse—in particular, she worried and felt “guilty” and she could not “stop thinking about” and\n\nimagining “what must have happened on the bus.” 6 RP at 1031. The abuse had caused DH’s\n\nmother to experience depression and anxiety.\n\n       Conte did not testify regarding the effect of Shafer’s abuse of DH on DH’s father. DH’s\n\nfather testified about his fears that “all of this” would continue to affect DH because DH would be\n\nunable to complete high school and college and would become pregnant in high school and\n\ninvolved in “other things,” such as prostitution. 7 RP at 1360. These fears were “very disturbing”\n\nto DH’s father. 7 RP at 1360.\n\n2.     DISTRICT TESTIMONY\n\n       Dr. Russell Vandenbelt, a psychiatrist, testified regarding which of DH’s symptoms were\n\nattributable to her Trisomy X and which could be attributed to the molestations. He explained that\n\nTrisomy X resulted in developmental delays, particularly in speech and language acquisition and\n\nmotor skills, below average intelligence, and difficulty in social situations resulting in anger,\n\ntantrums, and anxiety. Dr. Vandenbelt acknowledged that DH had been “transiently upset[]” (8\n\nRP at 1546) on the afternoon of the bus incident but opined that\n\n       [t]he best available information in the records is that [DH] really wasn’t any\n       different in the immediate time frame following what happened on the bus outside\n\n                                                6\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\n       of the afternoon when supposedly something happened and carrying forward. So\n       the picture that emerges is one of someone who is pretty much the same after the\n       time of whatever happened on the bus as she was before.\n\n8 RP at 1531. DH immediately reported the bus incident, and thus Dr. Vandenbelt explained that\n\nDH had not repressed the incident, which he characterized as “at the lower end of the severity\n\ncontinuum with regard to what can happen . . . in childhood sexual abuse.” 8 RP at 1544.\n\n       According to Dr. Vandenbelt, DH’s shyness, sensitivity to wearing clothing, aggression,\n\ntemper tantrums, anger, immaturity, social and emotional issues, and speech delays all preexisted\n\nthe molestations and were attributable to DH’s Trisomy X, not to the molestations. Dr. Vandenbelt\n\nexplained that DH’s abuse of the family pets and difficulties at home were “attributable to her\n\ndevelopmental issues related to the Trisomy X” and were “repeated examples of her having\n\ndifficulty managing . . . different frustrations.” 8 RP at 1561. Similarly, DH’s incontinence issues\n\nwere unrelated to “past incidences of sexual abuse” because her incontinence correlated with\n\nchanges in DH’s schedule and was not a “pervasive pattern.” 8 RP at 1564-65. And DH’s sexual\n\nacting out was “not related” to the molestations because the sexualized behaviors occurred in\n\nisolation, rather than being part of the aftermath of an earlier event that carried forward. 8 RP at\n\n1571. The “[p]robability” was that DH would not “have any future problems” related to the\n\nmolestation, which DH did not seem to remember.5 8 RP at 1545.\n\n       The District also called DH’s mother, who admitted that DH had not had concerning\n\n“toileting issues” until kindergarten, which had later resolved, and that DH’s mother had told a\n\ndoctor in 2013 that she noticed no regression or loss of skills in DH. 8 RP at 1447. In June 2011,\n\n\n\n5\n  On cross-examination, the Appellants’ expert Conte similarly testified that DH had no\nindependent memory of the molestations on the bus.\n\n                                                 7\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\nafter DH’s mother had learned of the abuse, DH’s mother stated at a doctor’s appointment that she\n\nfelt that DH did not have any significant issues related to the bus incident.6 DH’s mother had also\n\nadmitted in December 2012 that she had seen nothing in DH’s behavior that caused her to believe\n\nthat there had been significant contact. It was not until a therapist’s appointment in 2015 that DH’s\n\nmother stated that DH had been acting out sexually. However, DH’s mother did note that DH’s\n\nbehavior had become “increasingly more difficult . . . to handle” since 2011. 8 RP at 1498. DH’s\n\nmother also stated, “[A] lot of what I have seen and simply shrugged off as just problematic and\n\nsomething that was part of [DH], I can see [was] most likely due to an evolving problem with her\n\nhaving been sexually molested.” 8 RP at 1498.\n\n       McEwen testified that when DH was McEwen’s student, DH never acted aggressively and\n\nexhibited no unusual or concerning behaviors. McEwen noted “[n]o change” in DH’s behavior\n\nfollowing the bus incident and that DH continued to make “steady progress.” 9 RP at 1721-22.\n\nSimilarly, DH’s kindergarten and first-grade teachers reported that DH appeared reserved yet\n\nfriendly and happy and did not have any angry outbursts or aggressive or sexualized behaviors.\n\n       Dr. Vandenbelt had also evaluated DH’s mother. He acknowledged that DH’s mother\n\nsuffered guilt, anger, anxiety, and depression; DH’s mother was stressed by her own understanding\n\nof what had happened on the bus. Dr. Vandenbelt acknowledged that DH’s mother had preexisting\n\ndepression, and he testified that the depression was “affected by [DH’s mother’s] understanding\n\n\n\n\n6\n  Dr. Vandenbelt had also testified that he reviewed records of a doctor’s visit in July 2012, where\nno symptoms attributable to any events that occurred in the fall of 2010 were discussed. Having\ninterviewed DH’s mother, Dr. Vandenbelt believed that DH’s mother was someone who would be\nparticularly likely to notice if DH had symptoms resulting from the abuse.\n\n                                                 8\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\nof her daughter having been sexually abused. [However, t]hat’s a different thing than saying . . .\n\nthat her . . . depression over time has been made worse.” 9 RP at 1632-33.\n\n                                C. JURY INSTRUCTIONS AND VERDICT\n\n       At a jury instructions conference, the trial court explained that it would include as\n\ninstruction 19 an instruction proposed by the District and used in Rollins v. King County Metro\n\nTransit, a case that the trial court believed had “significant parallels to this case.” 10 RP at 1930\n\n(citing 148 Wn. App. 370, 199 P.3d 499 (2009)). Instruction 19 stated,\n\n               In calculating a damage award, you must not include any damages that were\n       caused by acts of Gary Shafer and not proximately caused by negligence of the\n       [District]. Any damages caused solely by Gary Shafer and not proximately caused\n       by negligence of the [District] must be segregated from and not made a part of any\n       damage award against [the District].\n\nCP at 6433. The Appellants objected to instruction 19 and argued that the instruction “unfairly\n\nand prejudicially” “frame[d] the issue in the negative and has the jury excluding damages\n\nimmediately as opposed to describing in a positive fashion what they are to award” and misstated\n\nthe law. CP at 6155; 11 RP at 2065-66. The trial court also gave instruction 5, proposed by the\n\nAppellants, which stated that “[a]ny act or omission of an officer or employee is the act or omission\n\nof the” District. CP at 6419.\n\n       During deliberation, the jury asked whether under instruction 5, Shafer should be\n\nconsidered an employee of the District for purposes of determining negligence. The District\n\nargued that the jury had “found a flaw” in the instructions and speculated that the jury wondered\n\nwhether Shafer’s intentional acts could be imputed to the District. 11 RP at 2189. The Appellants\n\ndisagreed, argued that there were a “myriad of reasons” that the jury could have asked the question,\n\nand proposed that the jury be told to read its instructions. 11 RP at 2198. After consulting with\n\n\n                                                 9\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\nboth attorneys, the trial court agreed with the Appellants, rejected the District’s request for an\n\nadditional instruction, and directed the jury to reread the instructions. The trial court reasoned that\n\nit was unclear from the question whether the jury thought “that there is vicarious liability here”\n\nand accepted the Appellants’ argument that “the instructions together guide the jury to the overall\n\ninstructions and legal principles that apply.” 12 RP at 2217.\n\n       On December 17, the jury returned a special verdict form in which it answered, “Yes” to\n\nthe questions of whether the District was negligent or grossly negligent and whether such\n\nnegligence or gross negligence was “a proximate cause of injury or damage to the [Appellants].”\n\nCP at 6447-48. However, the jury found the measure of each of the Appellants’ damages\n\n“proximately caused by” the District to be “$0” in response to three separate interrogatories. CP\n\nat 6449. After the jury returned its verdict and was polled, neither party raised any issues to\n\naddress, and the trial court recessed.\n\n                                   V. MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL\n\n       In January 2016, the Appellants moved for a new trial on the issue of damages alone under\n\nCR 59(a)(1), (5), (7), and (9).7 The Appellants argued that the verdict was inherently contradictory\n\nbecause the jury had found that the District’s negligence proximately caused the Appellants’\n\ndamages, yet failed to award the Appellants any damages. The Appellants further argued that\n\nbecause the evidence of their damages was undisputed, the jury’s damage award of “$0” was not\n\n\n\n7\n  CR 59 provides that a trial court may vacate a verdict and grant a new trial on the basis of\n“[i]rregularity in the proceedings of the court, jury or adverse party . . . by which such party was\nprevented from having a fair trial,” “[d]amages so excessive or inadequate as unmistakably to\nindicate that the verdict must have been the result of passion or prejudice,” “[t]hat there is no\nevidence or reasonable inference from the evidence to justify the verdict or the decision, or that it\nis contrary to law,” or “[t]hat substantial justice has not been done.” CR 59(a)(1), (5), (7), (9).\n\n                                                  10\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\nsupported by the evidence. In response, the District argued that the Appellants waived the issue\n\nof whether the verdict was internally inconsistent because they failed to raise it while the jury was\n\nimpaneled. The District also argued that the verdict was consistent.\n\n       The trial court denied the Appellants’ motion for a new trial. The trial court disagreed that\n\nthe Appellants had waived the argument. Further, the trial court determined that the jury’s verdict\n\nwas internally consistent on the basis that either the jury believed that there were no damages\n\ncaused solely by the District and not also by Shafer or that the jury determined there was no proof\n\nof monetary value of any injury caused by the District.\n\n                                   VI. ATTORNEY FEES REQUEST\n\n       After trial, the Appellants moved for fees and costs and argued that fees were appropriate\n\nunder CR 37(c)8 because the Appellants’ requests for admissions9 had sought the District’s\n\n“opinion with regard to the application of law to fact.” CP at 6703. The District responded that it\n\nhad properly refused to “admit negligence” and that the requests were improper because they\n\nrequired the District to admit a legal conclusion. CP at 7431. The District also noted that it was\n\n\n\n8\n  CR 36 governs requests for admission; CR 37(c) provides that “[i]f a party fails to admit . . . the\ntruth of any matter as requested under [CR] 36, and if the party requesting the admissions thereafter\nproves . . . the truth of the matter, the party may apply to the court for an order requiring the other\nparty to pay the requesting party the reasonable expenses incurred in making that proof, including\nreasonable attorney fees. The court shall make the order unless it finds that (1) the request was\nheld objectionable pursuant to [CR] 36(a), or (2) the admission sought was of no substantial\nimportance, or (3) the party failing to admit had reasonable ground to believe the fact was not true\n. . ., or (4) there was other good reason for the failure to admit.”\n9\n  In September 2015, the Appellants had requested that the District admit that it “failed to act\nreasonably in protecting D.H. from [Shafer’s] sexual abuse” and that it “breached its duty of care\nin failing to protect D.H. from [Shafer’s] sexual abuse.” CP at 4561-62. The District refused these\nrequests and explained that each request did “not refer to a factual issue but involve[d] a question\nof law.” CP at 4561-62.\n\n                                                  11\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\nnot required to admit factual matters central to the lawsuit. The trial court denied the Appellants’\n\nfee request.\n\n                                            ANALYSIS\n\n                                   I. MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL\n\n                                          A. NO WAIVER\n\n       The District argues that the Appellants waived their arguments that the verdict was\n\nirreconcilable because the Appellants failed to object while the jury was still impaneled. We\n\ndisagree.\n\n       The existence of a waiver is a mixed question of fact and law that, where the facts are\n\nundisputed, we review de novo. Brundridge v. Fluor Fed. Servs., Inc., 164 Wn.2d 432, 440-41,\n\n191 P.3d 879 (2008). We have noted inconsistency in cases deciding whether a party waived its\n\nchallenge to a jury verdict when it did not raise the alleged inconsistency prior to the jury’s\n\ndischarge. Mears v. Bethel Sch. Dist. No. 403, 182 Wn. App. 919, 928, 332 P.3d 1077 (2014),\n\nreview denied, 182 Wn.2d 1021 (2015). In Mears, we stated that Gjerde v. Fritzsche, a Division\n\nOne case declining to consider a challenge to jury interrogatories, appeared to be limited to the\n\ncircumstances presented:     counsel who was silent in the face of actual knowledge of an\n\ninconsistency when it could be cured and remained silent in order to “‘try his luck with a second\n\njury.’” 182 Wn. App. at 929 n.2 (quoting 55 Wn. App. 387, 394, 777 P.2d 1072 (1989)).\n\n       Here, after the jury returned the special verdict and was polled, the Appellants did not\n\nobject to the verdict. The Appellants first argued that the verdict was irreconcilable in their new\n\ntrial motion.    When the District subsequently argued that the Appellants had waived their\n\nobjection, the trial court correctly determined that there is no absolute standard that a party waives\n\n\n                                                 12\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\nits claim of an irreconcilable verdict when it fails to raise the issue before the jury’s discharge. See\n\nMears, 182 Wn. App. at 928.\n\n       On appeal, the District claims that here, there was actual knowledge of an inconsistency\n\nand that this is a situation where counsel remained silent despite actual knowledge in order to try\n\nhis luck with a second jury. See Mears, 182 Wn. App. at 929 n.2 (quoting Gjerde, 55 Wn. App.\n\nat 394). The District points to the jury’s question during deliberations: “‘In regards to Instruction\n\n5, should [Shafer] be considered an employee of the [District] in determining negligence?’” 11\n\nRP at 2187. But in response to this question, the Appellants contended that it was unclear why the\n\njury asked about negligence and argued against the District’s speculation that the jury had found a\n\nflaw in the instructions. Thus, it is not clear that the Appellants remained silent despite actual\n\nknowledge of an inconsistency, and the rule from Gjerde does not apply. See Mears, 182 Wn.\n\nApp. at 929 n.2. We hold that the Appellants did not waive their irreconcilable verdict argument.\n\n                                   B. VERDICT IS RECONCILABLE\n\n       The Appellants argue that the jury’s verdict was irreconcilable so that the matter must be\n\nreversed and remanded for a new trial on damages. We disagree.\n\n1.     LEGAL PRINCIPLES\n\n       We generally review the denial of a motion for new trial for an abuse of discretion;\n\nhowever, where the trial court based its decision upon an issue of law, we review the issue de novo.\n\nMears, 182 Wn. App. at 926-27. Where the jury’s answers to a special verdict cannot be\n\nreconciled, “‘[n]either a trial court nor an appellate court may substitute its judgment for that which\n\nis within the province of the jury’” and “‘[t]he only proper recourse is to remand the cause for a\n\nnew trial.’” Tincani v. Inland Empire Zoological Soc’y, 124 Wn.2d 121, 131, 875 P.2d 621 (1994)\n\n\n                                                  13\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\n(alterations in original) (quoting Blue Chelan, Inc. v. Dep’t of Labor & Indus., 101 Wn.2d 512,\n\n515, 681 P.2d 233 (1984)). We have stated that “[i]n reviewing a verdict, an appellate court must\n\ntry to reconcile the answers to special interrogatories.” Alvarez v. Keyes, 76 Wn. App. 741, 743,\n\n887 P.2d 496 (1995). And in reviewing the verdict, we read the verdict “as a whole, including\n\ninstructions.” Espinoza v. Am. Commerce Ins. Co., 184 Wn. App. 176, 197, 336 P.3d 115 (2014).\n\n2.     JURY INSTRUCTIONS\n\n       As relevant to this appeal, the trial court provided the following instructions to the jury:\n\n                                      INSTRUCTION NO. 5\n              . . . Any act or omission of an officer or employee [of the District] is the act\n       or omission of the [District].\n                                      INSTRUCTION NO. 6\n              The [Appellants] claim that [the District] was grossly negligent and/or\n       negligent in one or more of the following respects:\n              1.       Failing to provide reasonable protection for D.H.;\n              2.       Failing to use reasonable care in the hiring, retention and\n       supervision of the activities of . . . Gary Shafer;\n              3.       Failing to enforce rules designed to protect passengers from\n       inappropriate touching; and\n              4.       Failing to train employees;\n              [The Appellants] claim that this negligence caused injuries and damages to\n       the [Appellants].\n\nCP at 6419-20.\n\n                                    INSTRUCTION NO. 19\n               In calculating a damage award, you must not include any damages that were\n       caused by acts of Gary Shafer and not proximately caused by negligence of the\n       [District]. Any damages caused solely by Gary Shafer and not proximately caused\n       by negligence of the [District] must be segregated from and not made a part of any\n       damage award against [the District].\n\nCP at 6433.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 14\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\n                                    INSTRUCTION NO. 22\n               The cause of an injury or event is a proximate cause if it is related to the\n       injury or event in two ways: (1) the cause produced the injury or event in a direct\n       sequence, and (2) the injury or event would not have happened in the absence of\n       the cause.\n               There may be more than one proximate cause of the same injury or event.\n       If you find that the [District] was negligent and that such negligence was a\n       proximate cause of injury or damage to the [Appellants], it is not a defense that the\n       act of some other person who is not a party to this lawsuit may also have been a\n       proximate cause.\n               However, if you find that the sole proximate cause of injury or damage to\n       the [Appellants] was the act of some other person who is not a party to this lawsuit\n       then your verdict should be for the [District].\n\nCP at 6436.\n\n                                    INSTRUCTION NO. 28\n               ....\n               If your verdict is for the [Appellants], then you must determine the amount\n       of money which will reasonably and fairly compensate the [Appellants] for such\n       damages as you find were proximately caused by the [District].\n               [The instructions then listed the elements of noneconomic damages for DH\n       and factors to be considered if the jury awarded DH’s parents damages.]\n               The burden of proving damages rests with the [Appellants] and it is for you\n       to determine, based upon the evidence, whether any particular element has been\n       proved by a preponderance of the evidence.\n               Your award must be based upon the evidence and not upon speculation,\n       guess or conjecture.\n               The law has not furnished us with any fixed standard by which to measure\n       pain, suffering, or disability. With reference to these matters, you must be governed\n       by your own judgment, by the evidence in the case, and by these instructions.\n\nCP at 6442-43.\n\n3.     ANALYSIS\n\n       Here, the jury returned a verdict that the District had been both negligent and grossly\n\nnegligent, that the negligence and gross negligence proximately caused “injury or damage to the\n\n[Appellants],” but that the “measure of [Appellants’] damages proximately caused by the\n\n[District]” was “$0” for DH, DH’s mother, and DH’s father. CP at 6448-49. These answers to the\n\n\n                                                15\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\nspecial verdict are reconcilable under the instructions because the jury could have determined that\n\nthe District was liable, yet that the Appellants had proved no legally compensable damages.\n\n       The Appellants contend that the verdict is irreconcilable under this theory because the jury\n\ncould not have found that the Appellants had proven damage proximately caused by the District\n\nbut then awarded nothing in compensation. We disagree with this argument; nothing in the jury\n\ninstructions foreclosed the jury from determining that the Appellants had suffered injuries or\n\ndamages yet assessing that the legally compensable value of the injury or damages was “$0.” For\n\ninstance, although instruction 6 stated that the Appellants claimed that the District’s negligence\n\ncaused the Appellants’ “injuries and damages” (CP at 6420) and instruction 22 discussed whether\n\nthe District’s negligence was a “proximate cause of injury or damage to the [Appellants]” (CP at\n\n6436), instruction 28 told the jury,\n\n               If your verdict is for the [Appellants], then you must determine the amount\n       of money which will reasonably and fairly compensate the [Appellants] for such\n       damages as you find were proximately caused by the [District].\n               ....\n               The burden of proving damages rests with the [Appellants] and it is for you\n       to determine, based upon the evidence, whether any particular element has been\n       proved by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\nCP at 6442-43. Thus, the instructions allowed the jury to conclude that even if it found that the\n\nDistrict was liable, the jury could decline to award damages to the Appellants if the jury was not\n\nconvinced that the Appellants had proven that the amount of compensation they were entitled to\n\nwas greater than “$0.”\n\n       When we review whether the answers to a special verdict are reconcilable under the\n\ninstructions and the verdict as a whole, we must try to reconcile the answers where possible. See\n\nAlvarez, 76 Wn. App. at 743. Here, the jury’s verdict may be reconciled under the District’s theory\n\n\n                                                16\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\nthat the jury decided that the value of the Appellants’ damages was “$0.” We reject the Appellants’\n\narguments that a new trial should have been granted because the verdict was irreconcilable.10\n\n       Next, we turn to whether the trial evidence substantially supports the verdict.\n\n                    C. SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT A “$0” VERDICT\n\n       The Appellants further argue that even if the verdict was reconcilable, the trial court abused\n\nits discretion when it ruled that there was substantial evidence to support a “$0” verdict for each\n\nAppellant. Again, we disagree.\n\n       A trial court abuses its discretion when it denies a motion for a new trial where the verdict\n\nis contrary to the evidence. Sommer v. Dep’t of Soc. & Health Servs., 104 Wn. App. 160, 172, 15\n\nP.3d 664 (2001). We review the record to determine whether there was sufficient evidence to\n\nsupport the verdict: that is, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\n\nparty, there must be “‘substantial evidence’” to support the verdict and the verdict must not be\n\nfounded on mere theory or speculation. Sommer, 104 Wn. App. at 172 (quoting Hojem v. Kelly,\n\n93 Wn.2d 143, 145, 606 P.2d 275 (1980)).\n\n       We have stated that\n\n       when a court reviews a jury’s verdict\n              [the] court will not willingly assume that the jury did not fairly and\n              objectively consider the evidence and the contentions of the parties relative\n\n\n10\n   We note that the Appellants proposed the instruction that became instruction 5 and that the\nAppellants had an opportunity to clarify instruction 5 when the jury posed a question regarding\nthat instruction. The Appellants, however, chose not to do so and repeatedly “urg[ed] the Court\nnot to give” any additional instructions. 12 RP at 2212, 2215. Further, we are not asked to decide\nwhether it was error to give instruction 5 together with instruction 19, and thus we do not reach\nthis issue. We have doubts whether instruction 19 was properly given due to the interplay between\ninstructions 19 and 5 as discussed here. But Appellant’s challenge to instruction 19 is solely on\nthe grounds that it was “misleading and confusing” because it was negatively phrased, redundant,\nand biased in favor of the District. Br. of Appellants at 47.\n\n                                                17\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\n               to the issues before it. The inferences to be drawn from the evidence are for\n               the jury and not for [the] court. The credibility of witnesses and the weight\n               to be given to the evidence are matters within the province of the jury and\n               even if convinced that a wrong verdict has been rendered, the reviewing\n               court will not substitute its judgment for that of the jury, so long as there\n               was evidence which, if believed, would support the verdict rendered.\n\nEstate of Stalkup v. Vancouver Clinic, Inc., P.S., 145 Wn. App. 572, 586, 187 P.3d 291 (2008)\n\n(alterations in original; citation omitted). In Stalkup, we further stated that “[e]ven in those\n\ninstances, where several competent experts concur in their opinion and the opposing party does\n\nnot offer contrary expert evidence, the jury is bound to decide the issue on its own fair judgment,\n\nassisted by the expert testimony.” 145 Wn. App. at 591. “[T]here is no per se rule that general\n\ndamages must be awarded to every plaintiff who sustains an injury, [although] a plaintiff who\n\nsubstantiates her pain and suffering with evidence is entitled to general damages.” Palmer v.\n\nJensen, 132 Wn.2d 193, 201, 937 P.2d 597 (1997).\n\n       The District cites to Kozma v. Starbucks Coffee Co., which is illustrative that a defendant\n\nmay be liable for injury to a plaintiff, yet the plaintiff may suffer no legally compensable injury.\n\n412 N.J. Super. 319, 990 A.2d 679 (2010). There, the plaintiff, who had a preexisting knee injury,\n\nslipped and fell outside a Starbucks and sued Starbucks Corporation for damages. Kozma, 412\n\nN.J. Super. at 322. At trial, the jury allocated “sixty percent of the negligence and proximate cause\n\nto Starbucks and the balance” to the plaintiff. Kozma, 412 N.J. Super. at 321. However, the jury\n\nunanimously declined to award any compensatory damages. Kozma, 412 N.J. Super. at 321. The\n\nappellate court affirmed the jury’s verdict, noting that a jury “‘need not give controlling effect to\n\nany or all of the testimony provided by experts even in the absence of [contrary] evidence.’”\n\nKozma, 412 N.J. Super. at 325 (quoting State v. Spann, 236 N.J. Super. 13, 21, 563 A.2d 1145\n\n(1989), aff’d, 130 N.J. 484, 617 A.2d 247 (1993)). Rather, “the evidence was susceptible to an\n\n                                                 18\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\ninterpretation that minimized the monetary equivalent of plaintiff’s pain and suffering to its\n\nvanishing point. . . . The jury could reasonably find that the impact of the fall was so insignificant\n\nthat no additional injury beyond plaintiff’s preexisting condition was sustained.” Kozma, 412 N.J.\n\nat 325-27.\n\n       Here, the District and the Appellants hotly disputed whether or not DH suffered any\n\ncompensable damages because of the molestation. The District’s expert acknowledged that DH\n\nhad been briefly upset on the afternoon of the bus incident but also that the\n\n       best available information in the records is that [DH] really wasn’t any different in\n       the immediate time frame following what happened on the bus outside of the\n       afternoon when supposedly something happened and carrying forward. So the\n       picture that emerges is one of someone who is pretty much the same after the time\n       of whatever happened on the bus as she was before.\n\n8 RP at 1531. The expert further testified at length that all of DH’s symptoms were attributable\n\nnot to any molestations but to her preexisting Trisomy X. Finally, the expert opined that the\n\n“[p]robability” was that DH would not “have any future problems” related to the molestation,\n\nwhich DH did not seem to remember. 8 RP at 1545. Notably, the Appellants’ own expert\n\nconfirmed on cross-examination that DH did not independently remember the incidents.\n\n       DH’s mother also testified that DH’s toileting issues had begun in kindergarten and that\n\nDH’s mother did not report any of DH’s symptoms allegedly related to the molestations until long\n\nafter the incidents. Finally, multiple teachers testified that they witnessed no changes in DH’s\n\nbehavior following the molestations. Thus, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\nDistrict, there is substantial evidence to support the jury’s award of “$0” as DH’s compensation\n\nfor the molestations. Sommer, 104 Wn. App. at 172.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 19\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\n       The parties did not as clearly contest whether DH’s parents suffered damages. In fact, at\n\ntrial, Dr. Vandenbelt confirmed that DH’s mother suffered symptoms including guilt, anger,\n\nanxiety, and effects to her preexisting depression, all of which resulted from DH’s mother’s own\n\nunderstanding of what had happened on the bus. During the Appellants’ case, they presented\n\nundisputed testimony that learning about the molestation had caused DH’s mother to feel “like\n\n[her] whole world was coming down.” 7 RP at 1237. The Appellants’ expert briefly testified that\n\nDH’s mother suffered as a result of DH’s abuse—in particular, she worried and felt “guilty,” and\n\nshe could not “stop thinking about” and imagining “what must have happened on the bus.” 6 RP\n\nat 1031. The abuse had caused DH’s mother to experience depression and anxiety. DH’s father\n\ntestified about his “disturbing” fears that DH’s future would be affected because she had been\n\nmolested. 7 RP at 1360. Notably, the District did not focus upon DH’s mother’s injuries during\n\nher cross-examination and did not cross-examine DH’s father at all.\n\n       However, even where several witnesses have given uncontroverted testimony, a jury is\n\n“bound to decide the issue on its own fair judgment,” assisted by the testimony. Stalkup, 145 Wn.\n\nApp. at 591. DH’s parents’ testimony about “guilt,” “anger,” “depression,” and “anxiety,”\n\nalthough evidence of emotional upset, could reasonably have been assessed by the jury not to rise\n\nto the level of upset that would merit a damages recovery. See, e.g., Kozma, 412 N.J. Super. at\n\n325-27. Thus, again, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the District, substantial\n\nevidence supports a “$0” verdict for DH’s parents. For these reasons, we hold that the trial court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion when it denied Appellant’s new trial motion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                20\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\n                                II. JURY INSTRUCTION CHALLENGE\n\n       The Appellants argue that the trial court abused its discretion when it gave instruction 19,\n\nwhich the Appellants contend was (1) misleading and confusing because it was phrased negatively,\n\n(2) redundant with instructions 22 and 28, and (3) slanted in favor of the District. The Appellants\n\nfurther contend that (4) the claimed error was harmful because instruction 19 allegedly provides\n\nthe only grounds to reconcile the jury’s verdict. We hold that the Appellants’ arguments either\n\nfail or are waived.\n\n                                       A. LEGAL PRINCIPLES\n\n       We review de novo whether a jury instruction is an accurate statement of the law. Terrell\n\nv. Hamilton, 190 Wn. App. 489, 498, 358 P.3d 453 (2015). But we review for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion the trial court’s decision regarding how to word an instruction or whether to give an\n\ninstruction. Terrell, 190 Wn. App. at 498. A party must make a proper objection to a jury\n\ninstruction to preserve its challenge for appellate review. Millies v. LandAmerica Transnation,\n\n185 Wn.2d 302, 313, 372 P.3d 111 (2016). The exception must be sufficient to apprise the trial\n\njudge of the objection’s nature and substance. Washburn v. City of Federal Way, 178 Wn.2d 732,\n\n746, 310 P.3d 1275 (2013). Negatively phrased instructions may be objectionable for at least two\n\nreasons: first, they may be misleading and confuse the jury, and second, they may slant the\n\ninstructions in the opposing party’s favor. Terrell, 190 Wn. App. at 505.\n\n                                             B. WAIVER\n\n       In its proposed jury instructions, the District included instruction 19 with an additional\n\nsentence at the end. At a jury instructions conference, the trial court explained that it would include\n\n\n\n\n                                                  21\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\ninstruction 19 (without the additional sentence) as the instruction used in Rollins, a case with\n\n“significant parallels to this case.” 10 RP at 1930 (citing 148 Wn. App. 370). Instruction 19 stated,\n\n               In calculating a damage award, you must not include any damages that were\n       caused by acts of Gary Shafer and not proximately caused by negligence of the\n       [District]. Any damages caused solely by Gary Shafer and not proximately caused\n       by negligence of the [District] must be segregated from and not made a part of any\n       damage award against [the District].\n\nCP at 6433. The Appellants objected to instruction 19 and argued that the instruction “unfairly\n\nand prejudicially” “frame[d] the issue in the negative and ha[d] the jury excluding damages\n\nimmediately as opposed to describing in a positive fashion what they are to award” and misstated\n\nthe law. CP at 6155; 11 RP at 2066.\n\n       On appeal, the Appellants reiterate their argument that instruction 19 was improper because\n\nit was negatively framed and further argue that instruction 19 is redundant and slanted in the\n\nDistrict’s favor. The arguments that the instruction is redundant and slanted in the District’s favor\n\nwere not made before the trial court. Thus, we decline to review these arguments unless\n\nAppellants’ instruction conference arguments were “‘sufficient to apprise the trial judge of the\n\nnature and substance of the objection[s].’” Washburn, 178 Wn.2d at 746 (quoting Crossen v.\n\nSkagit County, 100 Wn.2d 355, 358, 669 P.2d 1244 (1983)).\n\n       Here, the Appellants’ argument that instruction 19 is redundant with other instructions was\n\nnot raised in the trial court and accordingly has not been preserved. See Millies, 185 Wn.2d at\n\n313; Washburn, 178 Wn.2d at 746. Further, the Appellants’ argument that instruction 19 is one-\n\nsided is not sufficiently related to the Appellants’ argument that it is confusing—Terrell indicates\n\nthat one-sidedness and capacity to be misleading are distinct reasons that a negatively phrased\n\ninstruction may be objectionable. See 190 Wn. App. at 505. For these reasons, we hold that the\n\n\n                                                 22\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\nAppellants preserved only their arguments that instruction 19 was misleading, and accordingly\n\nconfusing, because it is negatively phrased.\n\n                                   C. NO ABUSE OF DISCRETION\n\n        As discussed, the Appellants’ remaining argument is that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion because instruction 19 was misleading and confusing. We disagree.\n\n        Contrary to the Appellants’ arguments, there is no per se rule that the giving of a negatively\n\nphrased jury instruction is an abuse of discretion. The Appellants rely upon Rickert v. Geppert, in\n\nwhich the court determined that an instruction “not to compare negligence of the parties, if any\n\nexists” was more likely to confuse, than aid, the jury. 64 Wn.2d 350, 355-56, 391 P.2d 964 (1964).\n\nBut Rickert does not absolutely bar the giving of a jury instruction phrased in the negative; rather,\n\nthere, the court granted a retrial on other grounds and determined that while there was “no abuse\n\nof judicial discretion in the giving of the instruction,” a similar instruction “should not be given in\n\na retrial” if it were proposed. 64 Wn.2d at 356.\n\n        Here, the trial court gave instruction 19 because the instruction had been used in Rollins.\n\nIn Rollins, a passenger sued King County Metro Transit for negligence arising out of an altercation\n\non a Metro bus. 148 Wn. App. at 372-73. Division One of this court observed that “[t]he\n\nintentional conduct of unknown assailants was a proximate cause of injury” but that the passenger\n\nsought recovery solely from Metro and not from the assailants who intentionally attacked her.\n\nRollins, 148 Wn. App. at 379. Division One held that it was not misleading to give an instruction\n\nthat,\n\n        “[i]n calculating a damage award, you must not include any damages that were\n        caused by acts of the unknown assailants and not proximately caused by negligence\n        of the defendant. Any damages caused solely by the unknown assailants and not\n\n\n                                                   23\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\n       proximately caused by negligence of defendant [Metro] must be segregated from\n       and not made a part of any damage award against [Metro.]”\n\nRollins, 148 Wn. App. at 379. Given the similarity of this case to Rollins, the trial court’s decision\n\nthat instruction 19 would be helpful to the jury and was not misleading or confusing was not\n\nunreasonable. Accordingly, the Appellants’ argument that the trial court abused its discretion\n\nwhen it gave instruction 19 because that instruction was negatively phrased fails. Because the trial\n\ncourt acted within its discretion and accordingly did not err, we do not address the Appellants’\n\ncontention that the alleged error was not harmless.\n\n                                      III. SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n\n       The Appellants contend that the trial court erred when it denied their summary judgment\n\nmotion on liability.11 We decline to address this argument.\n\n       An issue is moot if we can no longer provide effective relief. SEIU Healthcare 775NW v.\n\nGregoire, 168 Wn.2d 593, 602, 229 P.3d 774 (2010). Because we affirm the jury verdict finding\n\nthe District liable, it is no longer material that the trial court denied summary judgment on liability.\n\n                                     IV. EVIDENTIARY RULING\n\n       The Appellants also argue that the trial court abused its discretion when it excluded the\n\nDistrict’s liability admissions from Crunkleton. The Appellants contend that exclusion of the\n\nDistrict’s prior liability admissions was not harmless error because had the evidence been\n\n\n\n\n11\n   The Appellants also argue that the summary judgment ruling was “not harmless.” Br. of\nAppellants at 55. But we do not address this argument because we do not review the denial of\nsummary judgment motions for harmless error. See Christensen v. Grant County Hosp. Dist. No.\n1, 152 Wn.2d 299, 305, 96 P.3d 957 (2004).\n\n                                                  24\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\nadmitted, the Appellants could have streamlined their liability case and focused upon presenting\n\nevidence of damages. We reject this argument.\n\n          Evidentiary error is harmless unless it affects the outcome of the case. Mut. of Enumclaw\n\nIns. Co. v. Gregg Roofing, Inc., 178 Wn. App. 702, 729, 315 P.3d 1143 (2013). Thus, we reverse\n\na jury’s verdict on the basis of evidentiary error only where we can say that the error affected that\n\nverdict. Brown v. Spokane County Fire Prot. Dist. No. 1, 100 Wn.2d 188, 196, 668 P.2d 571\n\n(1983).\n\n          We assume without deciding that the trial court abused its discretion when it declined to\n\nadmit the Crunkleton documents. Turning to harmless error, the Appellants do not argue that the\n\nCrunkleton documents would have proven damages. The Appellants argue instead that the\n\nadmissions were probative “regarding the central issues of duty, breach, and liability.” Br. of\n\nAppellants at 65. We thus assume that any effect of their admission would go to liability. As\n\ndiscussed, the jury found that the District was, in fact, liable. Therefore, even if we were to agree\n\nthat the trial court erred, the error would be harmless because it could not have affected the liability\n\nverdict. See Brown, 100 Wn.2d at 196.\n\n          The Appellants provide no authority for the proposition that the exclusion of evidence is\n\nharmful merely because it would have allowed for a more “streamlined” presentation of a party’s\n\ncase. Here, the Appellants were unable to more fully present their damages case because they\n\nwrongly assumed that the District would not contest liability, failed to seek a continuance, and\n\neven opposed the District’s request for a continuance shortly before trial. We reject the Appellants’\n\narguments and hold that even assuming error in the exclusion of the Crunkleton documents, that\n\nerror would have been harmless.\n\n\n                                                  25\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\n                              V. TRIAL COURT ATTORNEY FEE MOTION\n\n        The Appellants contend that they are entitled to an award of fees under CR 37(c) because\n\nthe District “fail[ed] to admit its negligence prior to trial,” in particular its “breach of its duty.” Br.\n\nof Appellants at 72, 75. We reject the Appellants’ arguments.\n\n        “We review a trial court’s decision to impose discovery sanctions under CR 37(c) for an\n\nabuse of discretion”; a trial court “abuses its discretion if its decision is manifestly unreasonable\n\nor based on untenable grounds.” Thompson v. King Feed & Nutrition Serv., Inc., 153 Wn.2d 447,\n\n472, 105 P.3d 378 (2005). CR 36(a) governs requests for admission of the truth of matters\n\nincluding “the application of law to fact”; the purpose of the rule “is to eliminate from controversy\n\nfactual matters that will not be disputed at trial.” Thompson, 153 Wn.2d at 472. Thus, “a party is\n\nnot required to concede either factual matters central to the lawsuit or legal conclusions.”\n\nThompson, 153 Wn.2d at 472.\n\n        If a party fails to admit the . . . truth of any matter as requested under [CR] 36, and\n        if the party requesting the admissions thereafter proves . . . the truth of the matter,\n        the party may apply to the court for an order requiring the other party to pay the\n        requesting party the reasonable expenses incurred in making that proof, including\n        reasonable attorney fees. The court shall make the order unless it finds that (1) the\n        request was held objectionable pursuant to [CR] 36(a), or (2) the admission sought\n        was of no substantial importance, or (3) the party failing to admit had reasonable\n        ground to believe the fact was not true[,] or (4) there was other good reason for the\n        failure to admit.\n\nCR 37(c).\n\n        In September 2015, the Appellants requested that the District admit that it “failed to act\n\nreasonably in protecting D.H. from [Shafer’s] sexual abuse” and that the District “breached its\n\nduty of care in failing to protect D.H. from [Shafer’s] sexual abuse.” CP at 4561-62. The District\n\nrefused these requests and explained that each request did “not refer to a factual issue but\n\n\n                                                    26\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\ninvolve[d] a question of law.” CP at 4561-62. After trial, the Appellants moved for fees and costs\n\nand argued that fees were appropriate under CR 37(c) because the Appellants’ requests sought the\n\nDistrict’s “opinion with regard to the application of law to fact.” CP at 6703. The District\n\nresponded that it had properly refused to “admit negligence” and that the requests were improper,\n\nrelying on both the rules that a party is not required to admit factual matters central to the lawsuit\n\nand that requests for admission cannot request that a party admit a legal conclusion. CP at 7431.\n\nThe trial court denied the Appellants’ request.\n\n       In Thompson, the plaintiff requested that the defendant admit that its negligence was,\n\namong other things, “the sole proximate cause” of a fire. 153 Wn.2d at 473. Our Supreme Court\n\nnoted that although this request could be characterized as the “‘application of law to fact’” under\n\nCR 36(a), the request “undoubtedly requested [the defendant] to admit [a] legal conclusion[].”\n\nThompson, 153 Wn.2d at 474 (quoting CR 36(a)). “Negligence and proximate cause are legal\n\nconclusions and are matters usually reserved for the jury.” Thompson, 153 Wn.2d at 474. Thus,\n\ndespite the request’s phrasing, the defendant had “‘good reason for the failure to admit’” under CR\n\n37(c)(4).\n\n       Here, unlike in Thompson, at issue are admissions requiring that the District admit breach\n\nof duty, rather than proximate cause or negligence. See 153 Wn.2d at 473. The Appellants argue\n\nthat breach of duty is “‘a question[] of fact for a jury,’” so that Thompson should not apply. Br. of\n\nAppellants at 74 (quoting Bowers v. Marzano, 170 Wn. App. 498, 506, 290 P.3d 134 (2012)). But\n\nthe Appellants’ reliance upon Bowers is misplaced—that case states that both breach of duty and\n\nproximate cause are “generally questions of fact for a jury.” 170 Wn. App. at 506. As discussed,\n\nThompson held that proximate cause is a legal conclusion usually reserved for the jury. 153 Wn.2d\n\n\n                                                  27\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\nat 474. Thus, Bowers’ language that proximate cause and breach of duty are both questions of fact\n\nfor the jury fails as a reason to distinguish Thompson.\n\n        Because the District was not required to concede breach of duty, the District had “‘good\n\nreason for the failure to admit.’”       Thompson, 153 Wn.2d at 474 (quoting CR 37(c)(4)).\n\nAccordingly, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the Appellants’\n\nmotion for costs under CR 37.12\n\n        We affirm.\n\n        A majority of the panel having determined that this opinion will not be printed in the\n\nWashington Appellate Reports, but will be filed for public record in accordance with RCW 2.06.040,\n\nit is so ordered.\n\n\n\n                                                     JOHANSON, J.\n We concur:\n\n\n\n WORSWICK, J.\n\n\n\n\n BJORGEN, C.J.\n\n\n\n\n12\n   In the alternative, the District was not required to admit breach of duty because breach of duty\nwas a central issue in dispute. See Thompson, 153 Wn.2d 472. At trial, the District contested\nwhether it had breached its duty; for instance, in closing, the District argued that in order to find it\nliable, the jury would have to find that the District “did something wrong . . . that violated the\nstandard of care.” 11 RP at 2135. The District also elicited testimony from Shafer that he had\ncarefully hidden his actions from others to avoid detection.\n                                                  28\n\f",

Finding no\n\nprejudicial error, we affirm.\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\n                                              FACTS\n\n                                         I. BACKGROUND\n\n       In January 2011, police arrested district school bus driver Shafer for molesting three district\n\nstudents—NL, VV, and TC—and for possessing child pornography. In August, Shafer pleaded\n\nguilty as charged and was sentenced to 175 months in prison. In June 2014, the Appellants, parents\n\nof DH, a fourth district student whom Shafer had also molested, sued the District for gross\n\nnegligence, negligence, and negligent infliction of emotional distress based upon the District’s\n\nfailure to prevent Shafer from abusing DH.\n\n                      II. SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND EVIDENTIARY MOTION\n\n       In September 2015, the Appellants moved for summary judgment on the issue of the\n\nDistrict’s liability on the ground that collateral estoppel applied. The trial court denied the\n\nsummary judgment motion, ruling that collateral estoppel did not apply.\n\n       In October, the Appellants moved to have the trial court admit the complaint and the\n\nDistrict’s admissions of negligence and gross negligence in Crunkleton v. Olympia School District1\n\nas substantive evidence under ER 801(d)(2).2 In response, the District argued that the Crunkleton\n\n\n\n1\n  Following Shafer’s convictions, NL, VV, TC, and their families or guardians brought three civil\nlawsuits against the District—Gutierrez v.

The Gutierrez plaintiffs prevailed at trial and were\nawarded $1.4 million in damages. The Villarreal plaintiffs obtained summary judgment against\nthe District on the issue of breach of duty. And in Crunkleton, the District admitted liability,\nalthough it contested the amount of damages. Whether damages were awarded in the latter two\ncases is not in the record before us.\n2\n ER 801(d)(2) excludes from the definition of hearsay a party opponent’s admissions when the\nadmissions are offered against the party opponent.\n\n                                                 2\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\ndocuments were not admissions under ER 801(d)(2) and, alternatively, that the Crunkleton\n\ndocuments were inadmissible under ER 403. The trial court denied the Appellants’ motion and\n\ntheir subsequent motion for reconsideration.\n\n                                 III. OTHER PRETRIAL PROCEEDINGS\n\n        Trial was set for November 30. In the months preceding trial, the District represented that\n\nit would contest liability at trial. The parties disputed the division of trial time, with the Appellants\n\nrequesting either that trial be allowed to proceed until both parties had fully presented their cases\n\nor a 60/40 allocation with the possibility of extending trial.\n\n        On November 24, the parties appeared for a pretrial hearing, and both the Appellants and\n\nthe District informed the trial court that they were prepared for trial on November 30. The\n\nAppellants told the trial court that when they had agreed that eight days was appropriate, they had\n\n“always assumed that the District would . . . admit[] liability or that it would be otherwise\n\nestablished.” Report of Proceedings (RP) (Nov. 24, 2015) at 9. In response, the trial court stated\n\nthat “I understand the [Appellants] made some assumptions about admissions by the [District], but\n\nit’s pretty late, and there’s been no motions to the Court to ask for extra time other than a very\n\nrecent motion to either divide the trial time in a particular way or give you extra days, and it’s not\n\npossible at this stage.” RP (Nov. 24, 2015) at 10. The District subsequently sought a continuance\n\nof the trial date, which the Appellants “vehemently oppose[d]” and the trial court denied. Clerk’s\n\nPapers (CP) at 6864.3\n\n\n\n3\n  The Appellants’ witness list included multiple damages experts. In the first week of trial, the\nAppellants moved for two additional days of trial time to present their case, including three of the\ndamages experts’ testimony. The trial court granted the Appellants only an additional half day\nbecause in its view, the Appellants had run out of time because they “made some assumptions that\nthe case would shrink before it started and that eight days would be sufficient.” 6 RP at 1177.\n                                                 3\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\n                                            IV. TRIAL\n\n                             A. APPELLANTS’ LIABILITY TESTIMONY\n\n       Shafer testified that he was a district employee who had joined the District as a bus driver\n\nin 2005. Shafer explained that at least once a week, in order to groom children, he rode along on\n\nbuses driven by other district drivers. Beginning in the fall or early winter of 2010, Shafer\n\nmolested DH three times. DH suffers from a congenital condition known as Trisomy X.4 Shafer\n\nassumed that due to her condition, DH would be “less likely . . . to tell on” Shafer. 2 RP at 325.\n\nThe first two times, Shafer molested DH while Shafer rode along on DH’s bus. The third time,\n\nShafer drove DH’s bus, and he pulled the bus over in order to molest DH.\n\n       District employees described a failure to train bus drivers to recognize the signs of\n\ngrooming and sexual molestation and a lack of procedures documenting when other bus drivers\n\nwould ride along on a bus. The district superintendent admitted that after a driver had been fired\n\nin 2009 for misconduct, Shafer’s supervisors should have been “on the lookout.” 4 RP at 644.\n\nDocumenting ride-alongs would have helped district employees to recognize when there was an\n\nunusual pattern or behavior by a bus driver. And the Appellants’ expert witness testified that the\n\nDistrict did not meet the standard of care in Washington when it hired Shafer.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the trial court, the “[Appellants] had information well before trial that the case had\nnot been narrowed in terms of the issues and nonetheless did not seek a continuance, knowing that\nthe case had been confirmed for eight trial days.” 6 RP at 1177.\n4\n DH’s mother testified that DH’s Trisomy X caused her to have delayed speech, language, and\nmotor skills, to have a slightly lowered IQ, and to be shy.\n\n                                                4\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\n                                    B. DAMAGES TESTIMONY\n\n1.     APPELLANTS’ TESTIMONY\n\n       DH’s mother explained that in November or December 2010, four-year-old DH, who rode\n\na special needs bus, had been dropped off by a school bus driven by two men. DH was not smiling,\n\nwhich her mother noted was “different,” and right away, DH asked her mother, “‘Why that man\n\ntouch my bottom?’” 7 RP at 1231. DH was “really upset,” “moody,” and “off” that afternoon—\n\nso much so that DH’s father returned home early from work because he was concerned—although\n\nDH’s behavior eventually returned to normal and her parents attributed her behavior that afternoon\n\nto a “misunderstanding.” 7 RP at 1232.\n\n       DH’s mother called DH’s preschool teacher, Simona McEwen, who testified that DH’s\n\nstatement about a man touching her had “stood out to” McEwen at the time. 9 RP at 1721. In\n\nMcEwen’s view, it was remarkable for DH to utter such a long sentence because DH typically\n\nspoke in “pretty short sentences.” 9 RP at 1721. DH refused to ride the bus after the incident.\n\nAfter DH began kindergarten, approximately three years after the molestations, her toilet training\n\nregressed, and at home, she had tantrums and was destructive and abusive to the family pets. DH\n\nbegan to act out sexually between second and third grade to the point that DH’s parents felt that\n\nshe was “out of control.” 7 RP at 1268.\n\n       According to DH’s mother, DH’s behavior was “stressful,” caused DH’s parents to have\n\nmarital problems, and led DH’s mother to worry that DH’s sexual behavior would cause her future\n\nproblems. 7 RP at 1275. It was not until May 2011, when police informed DH’s mother that\n\nShafer had admitted to molesting a child on DH’s bus, that DH’s mother learned that Shafer had\n\npotentially molested DH. DH’s mother testified that she believed that DH was the child that Shafer\n\n\n                                                5\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\nhad molested and that the news emotionally upset her, so that she “felt like [her] whole world was\n\ncoming down.” 7 RP at 1237. She felt “[l]ike [she had] not been a good mom . . . [b]ecause this\n\nhappened to [DH]” and because she “didn’t follow up.” 7 RP at 1274-75. DH’s mother explained\n\nthat she had preexisting depression.\n\n       Jon Conte, the Appellants’ “sex abuse trauma expert,” also briefly testified regarding DH’s\n\nmother’s damages. 1 RP at 66. Conte opined that DH’s mother suffered as a result of DH’s\n\nabuse—in particular, she worried and felt “guilty” and she could not “stop thinking about” and\n\nimagining “what must have happened on the bus.” 6 RP at 1031. The abuse had caused DH’s\n\nmother to experience depression and anxiety.\n\n       Conte did not testify regarding the effect of Shafer’s abuse of DH on DH’s father. DH’s\n\nfather testified about his fears that “all of this” would continue to affect DH because DH would be\n\nunable to complete high school and college and would become pregnant in high school and\n\ninvolved in “other things,” such as prostitution. 7 RP at 1360. These fears were “very disturbing”\n\nto DH’s father. 7 RP at 1360.\n\n2.     DISTRICT TESTIMONY\n\n       Dr. Russell Vandenbelt, a psychiatrist, testified regarding which of DH’s symptoms were\n\nattributable to her Trisomy X and which could be attributed to the molestations. He explained that\n\nTrisomy X resulted in developmental delays, particularly in speech and language acquisition and\n\nmotor skills, below average intelligence, and difficulty in social situations resulting in anger,\n\ntantrums, and anxiety. Dr. Vandenbelt acknowledged that DH had been “transiently upset[]” (8\n\nRP at 1546) on the afternoon of the bus incident but opined that\n\n       [t]he best available information in the records is that [DH] really wasn’t any\n       different in the immediate time frame following what happened on the bus outside\n\n                                                6\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\n       of the afternoon when supposedly something happened and carrying forward. So\n       the picture that emerges is one of someone who is pretty much the same after the\n       time of whatever happened on the bus as she was before.\n\n8 RP at 1531. DH immediately reported the bus incident, and thus Dr. Vandenbelt explained that\n\nDH had not repressed the incident, which he characterized as “at the lower end of the severity\n\ncontinuum with regard to what can happen . . . in childhood sexual abuse.” 8 RP at 1544.\n\n       According to Dr. Vandenbelt, DH’s shyness, sensitivity to wearing clothing, aggression,\n\ntemper tantrums, anger, immaturity, social and emotional issues, and speech delays all preexisted\n\nthe molestations and were attributable to DH’s Trisomy X, not to the molestations. Dr. Vandenbelt\n\nexplained that DH’s abuse of the family pets and difficulties at home were “attributable to her\n\ndevelopmental issues related to the Trisomy X” and were “repeated examples of her having\n\ndifficulty managing . . . different frustrations.” 8 RP at 1561. Similarly, DH’s incontinence issues\n\nwere unrelated to “past incidences of sexual abuse” because her incontinence correlated with\n\nchanges in DH’s schedule and was not a “pervasive pattern.” 8 RP at 1564-65. And DH’s sexual\n\nacting out was “not related” to the molestations because the sexualized behaviors occurred in\n\nisolation, rather than being part of the aftermath of an earlier event that carried forward. 8 RP at\n\n1571. The “[p]robability” was that DH would not “have any future problems” related to the\n\nmolestation, which DH did not seem to remember.5 8 RP at 1545.\n\n       The District also called DH’s mother, who admitted that DH had not had concerning\n\n“toileting issues” until kindergarten, which had later resolved, and that DH’s mother had told a\n\ndoctor in 2013 that she noticed no regression or loss of skills in DH. 8 RP at 1447. In June 2011,\n\n\n\n5\n  On cross-examination, the Appellants’ expert Conte similarly testified that DH had no\nindependent memory of the molestations on the bus.\n\n                                                 7\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\nafter DH’s mother had learned of the abuse, DH’s mother stated at a doctor’s appointment that she\n\nfelt that DH did not have any significant issues related to the bus incident.6 DH’s mother had also\n\nadmitted in December 2012 that she had seen nothing in DH’s behavior that caused her to believe\n\nthat there had been significant contact. It was not until a therapist’s appointment in 2015 that DH’s\n\nmother stated that DH had been acting out sexually. However, DH’s mother did note that DH’s\n\nbehavior had become “increasingly more difficult . . . to handle” since 2011. 8 RP at 1498. DH’s\n\nmother also stated, “[A] lot of what I have seen and simply shrugged off as just problematic and\n\nsomething that was part of [DH], I can see [was] most likely due to an evolving problem with her\n\nhaving been sexually molested.” 8 RP at 1498.\n\n       McEwen testified that when DH was McEwen’s student, DH never acted aggressively and\n\nexhibited no unusual or concerning behaviors. McEwen noted “[n]o change” in DH’s behavior\n\nfollowing the bus incident and that DH continued to make “steady progress.” 9 RP at 1721-22.\n\nSimilarly, DH’s kindergarten and first-grade teachers reported that DH appeared reserved yet\n\nfriendly and happy and did not have any angry outbursts or aggressive or sexualized behaviors.\n\n       Dr. Vandenbelt had also evaluated DH’s mother. He acknowledged that DH’s mother\n\nsuffered guilt, anger, anxiety, and depression; DH’s mother was stressed by her own understanding\n\nof what had happened on the bus. Dr. Vandenbelt acknowledged that DH’s mother had preexisting\n\ndepression, and he testified that the depression was “affected by [DH’s mother’s] understanding\n\n\n\n\n6\n  Dr. Vandenbelt had also testified that he reviewed records of a doctor’s visit in July 2012, where\nno symptoms attributable to any events that occurred in the fall of 2010 were discussed. Having\ninterviewed DH’s mother, Dr. Vandenbelt believed that DH’s mother was someone who would be\nparticularly likely to notice if DH had symptoms resulting from the abuse.\n\n                                                 8\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\nof her daughter having been sexually abused. [However, t]hat’s a different thing than saying . . .\n\nthat her . . . depression over time has been made worse.” 9 RP at 1632-33.\n\n                                C. JURY INSTRUCTIONS AND VERDICT\n\n       At a jury instructions conference, the trial court explained that it would include as\n\ninstruction 19 an instruction proposed by the District and used in Rollins v. King County Metro\n\nTransit, a case that the trial court believed had “significant parallels to this case.” 10 RP at 1930\n\n(citing </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">148</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2602012\"><a href=\"/opinion/2602012/rollins-v-king-county-metro-transit/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2009)). Instruction 19 stated,\n\n               In calculating a damage award, you must not include any damages that were\n       caused by acts of Gary Shafer and not proximately caused by negligence of the\n       [District]. Any damages caused solely by Gary Shafer and not proximately caused\n       by negligence of the [District] must be segregated from and not made a part of any\n       damage award against [the District].\n\nCP at 6433. The Appellants objected to instruction 19 and argued that the instruction “unfairly\n\nand prejudicially” “frame[d] the issue in the negative and has the jury excluding damages\n\nimmediately as opposed to describing in a positive fashion what they are to award” and misstated\n\nthe law. CP at 6155; 11 RP at 2065-66. The trial court also gave instruction 5, proposed by the\n\nAppellants, which stated that “[a]ny act or omission of an officer or employee is the act or omission\n\nof the” District. CP at 6419.\n\n       During deliberation, the jury asked whether under instruction 5, Shafer should be\n\nconsidered an employee of the District for purposes of determining negligence. The District\n\nargued that the jury had “found a flaw” in the instructions and speculated that the jury wondered\n\nwhether Shafer’s intentional acts could be imputed to the District. 11 RP at 2189. The Appellants\n\ndisagreed, argued that there were a “myriad of reasons” that the jury could have asked the question,\n\nand proposed that the jury be told to read its instructions. 11 RP at 2198. After consulting with\n\n\n                                                 9\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\nboth attorneys, the trial court agreed with the Appellants, rejected the District’s request for an\n\nadditional instruction, and directed the jury to reread the instructions. The trial court reasoned that\n\nit was unclear from the question whether the jury thought “that there is vicarious liability here”\n\nand accepted the Appellants’ argument that “the instructions together guide the jury to the overall\n\ninstructions and legal principles that apply.” 12 RP at 2217.\n\n       On December 17, the jury returned a special verdict form in which it answered, “Yes” to\n\nthe questions of whether the District was negligent or grossly negligent and whether such\n\nnegligence or gross negligence was “a proximate cause of injury or damage to the [Appellants].”\n\nCP at 6447-48. However, the jury found the measure of each of the Appellants’ damages\n\n“proximately caused by” the District to be “$0” in response to three separate interrogatories. CP\n\nat 6449. After the jury returned its verdict and was polled, neither party raised any issues to\n\naddress, and the trial court recessed.\n\n                                   V. MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL\n\n       In January 2016, the Appellants moved for a new trial on the issue of damages alone under\n\nCR 59(a)(1), (5), (7), and (9).7 The Appellants argued that the verdict was inherently contradictory\n\nbecause the jury had found that the District’s negligence proximately caused the Appellants’\n\ndamages, yet failed to award the Appellants any damages. The Appellants further argued that\n\nbecause the evidence of their damages was undisputed, the jury’s damage award of “$0” was not\n\n\n\n7\n  CR 59 provides that a trial court may vacate a verdict and grant a new trial on the basis of\n“[i]rregularity in the proceedings of the court, jury or adverse party . . . by which such party was\nprevented from having a fair trial,” “[d]amages so excessive or inadequate as unmistakably to\nindicate that the verdict must have been the result of passion or prejudice,” “[t]hat there is no\nevidence or reasonable inference from the evidence to justify the verdict or the decision, or that it\nis contrary to law,” or “[t]hat substantial justice has not been done.” CR 59(a)(1), (5), (7), (9).\n\n                                                  10\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\nsupported by the evidence. In response, the District argued that the Appellants waived the issue\n\nof whether the verdict was internally inconsistent because they failed to raise it while the jury was\n\nimpaneled. The District also argued that the verdict was consistent.\n\n       The trial court denied the Appellants’ motion for a new trial. The trial court disagreed that\n\nthe Appellants had waived the argument. Further, the trial court determined that the jury’s verdict\n\nwas internally consistent on the basis that either the jury believed that there were no damages\n\ncaused solely by the District and not also by Shafer or that the jury determined there was no proof\n\nof monetary value of any injury caused by the District.\n\n                                   VI. ATTORNEY FEES REQUEST\n\n       After trial, the Appellants moved for fees and costs and argued that fees were appropriate\n\nunder CR 37(c)8 because the Appellants’ requests for admissions9 had sought the District’s\n\n“opinion with regard to the application of law to fact.” CP at 6703. The District responded that it\n\nhad properly refused to “admit negligence” and that the requests were improper because they\n\nrequired the District to admit a legal conclusion. CP at 7431. The District also noted that it was\n\n\n\n8\n  CR 36 governs requests for admission; CR 37(c) provides that “[i]f a party fails to admit . . . the\ntruth of any matter as requested under [CR] 36, and if the party requesting the admissions thereafter\nproves . . . the truth of the matter, the party may apply to the court for an order requiring the other\nparty to pay the requesting party the reasonable expenses incurred in making that proof, including\nreasonable attorney fees. The court shall make the order unless it finds that (1) the request was\nheld objectionable pursuant to [CR] 36(a), or (2) the admission sought was of no substantial\nimportance, or (3) the party failing to admit had reasonable ground to believe the fact was not true\n. . ., or (4) there was other good reason for the failure to admit.”\n9\n  In September 2015, the Appellants had requested that the District admit that it “failed to act\nreasonably in protecting D.H. from [Shafer’s] sexual abuse” and that it “breached its duty of care\nin failing to protect D.H. from [Shafer’s] sexual abuse.” CP at 4561-62. The District refused these\nrequests and explained that each request did “not refer to a factual issue but involve[d] a question\nof law.” CP at 4561-62.\n\n                                                  11\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\nnot required to admit factual matters central to the lawsuit. The trial court denied the Appellants’\n\nfee request.\n\n                                            ANALYSIS\n\n                                   I. MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL\n\n                                          A. NO WAIVER\n\n       The District argues that the Appellants waived their arguments that the verdict was\n\nirreconcilable because the Appellants failed to object while the jury was still impaneled. We\n\ndisagree.\n\n       The existence of a waiver is a mixed question of fact and law that, where the facts are\n\nundisputed, we review de novo. Brundridge v. Fluor Fed.

In Mears, we stated that Gjerde v. Fritzsche, a Division\n\nOne case declining to consider a challenge to jury interrogatories, appeared to be limited to the\n\ncircumstances presented:     counsel who was silent in the face of actual knowledge of an\n\ninconsistency when it could be cured and remained silent in order to “‘try his luck with a second\n\njury.’” 182 Wn. App. at 929 n.2 (quoting </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash.

The Appellants first argued that the verdict was irreconcilable in their new\n\ntrial motion.    When the District subsequently argued that the Appellants had waived their\n\nobjection, the trial court correctly determined that there is no absolute standard that a party waives\n\n\n                                                 12\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\nits claim of an irreconcilable verdict when it fails to raise the issue before the jury’s discharge. See\n\nMears, 182 Wn. App. at 928.\n\n       On appeal, the District claims that here, there was actual knowledge of an inconsistency\n\nand that this is a situation where counsel remained silent despite actual knowledge in order to try\n\nhis luck with a second jury. See Mears, 182 Wn. App. at 929 n.2 (quoting Gjerde, 55 Wn. App.\n\nat 394). The District points to the jury’s question during deliberations: “‘In regards to Instruction\n\n5, should [Shafer] be considered an employee of the [District] in determining negligence?’” 11\n\nRP at 2187. But in response to this question, the Appellants contended that it was unclear why the\n\njury asked about negligence and argued against the District’s speculation that the jury had found a\n\nflaw in the instructions. Thus, it is not clear that the Appellants remained silent despite actual\n\nknowledge of an inconsistency, and the rule from Gjerde does not apply. See Mears, 182 Wn.\n\nApp. at 929 n.2. We hold that the Appellants did not waive their irreconcilable verdict argument.\n\n                                   B. VERDICT IS RECONCILABLE\n\n       The Appellants argue that the jury’s verdict was irreconcilable so that the matter must be\n\nreversed and remanded for a new trial on damages. We disagree.\n\n1.     LEGAL PRINCIPLES\n\n       We generally review the denial of a motion for new trial for an abuse of discretion;\n\nhowever, where the trial court based its decision upon an issue of law, we review the issue de novo.\n\nMears, 182 Wn.

JURY INSTRUCTIONS\n\n       As relevant to this appeal, the trial court provided the following instructions to the jury:\n\n                                      INSTRUCTION NO. 5\n              . . . Any act or omission of an officer or employee [of the District] is the act\n       or omission of the [District].\n                                      INSTRUCTION NO. 6\n              The [Appellants] claim that [the District] was grossly negligent and/or\n       negligent in one or more of the following respects:\n              1.       Failing to provide reasonable protection for D.H.;\n              2.       Failing to use reasonable care in the hiring, retention and\n       supervision of the activities of . . . Gary Shafer;\n              3.       Failing to enforce rules designed to protect passengers from\n       inappropriate touching; and\n              4.       Failing to train employees;\n              [The Appellants] claim that this negligence caused injuries and damages to\n       the [Appellants].\n\nCP at 6419-20.\n\n                                    INSTRUCTION NO. 19\n               In calculating a damage award, you must not include any damages that were\n       caused by acts of Gary Shafer and not proximately caused by negligence of the\n       [District]. Any damages caused solely by Gary Shafer and not proximately caused\n       by negligence of the [District] must be segregated from and not made a part of any\n       damage award against [the District].\n\nCP at 6433.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 14\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\n                                    INSTRUCTION NO. 22\n               The cause of an injury or event is a proximate cause if it is related to the\n       injury or event in two ways: (1) the cause produced the injury or event in a direct\n       sequence, and (2) the injury or event would not have happened in the absence of\n       the cause.\n               There may be more than one proximate cause of the same injury or event.\n       If you find that the [District] was negligent and that such negligence was a\n       proximate cause of injury or damage to the [Appellants], it is not a defense that the\n       act of some other person who is not a party to this lawsuit may also have been a\n       proximate cause.\n               However, if you find that the sole proximate cause of injury or damage to\n       the [Appellants] was the act of some other person who is not a party to this lawsuit\n       then your verdict should be for the [District].\n\nCP at 6436.\n\n                                    INSTRUCTION NO. 28\n               ....\n               If your verdict is for the [Appellants], then you must determine the amount\n       of money which will reasonably and fairly compensate the [Appellants] for such\n       damages as you find were proximately caused by the [District].\n               [The instructions then listed the elements of noneconomic damages for DH\n       and factors to be considered if the jury awarded DH’s parents damages.]\n               The burden of proving damages rests with the [Appellants] and it is for you\n       to determine, based upon the evidence, whether any particular element has been\n       proved by a preponderance of the evidence.\n               Your award must be based upon the evidence and not upon speculation,\n       guess or conjecture.\n               The law has not furnished us with any fixed standard by which to measure\n       pain, suffering, or disability. With reference to these matters, you must be governed\n       by your own judgment, by the evidence in the case, and by these instructions.\n\nCP at 6442-43.\n\n3.     ANALYSIS\n\n       Here, the jury returned a verdict that the District had been both negligent and grossly\n\nnegligent, that the negligence and gross negligence proximately caused “injury or damage to the\n\n[Appellants],” but that the “measure of [Appellants’] damages proximately caused by the\n\n[District]” was “$0” for DH, DH’s mother, and DH’s father. CP at 6448-49. These answers to the\n\n\n                                                15\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\nspecial verdict are reconcilable under the instructions because the jury could have determined that\n\nthe District was liable, yet that the Appellants had proved no legally compensable damages.\n\n       The Appellants contend that the verdict is irreconcilable under this theory because the jury\n\ncould not have found that the Appellants had proven damage proximately caused by the District\n\nbut then awarded nothing in compensation. We disagree with this argument; nothing in the jury\n\ninstructions foreclosed the jury from determining that the Appellants had suffered injuries or\n\ndamages yet assessing that the legally compensable value of the injury or damages was “$0.” For\n\ninstance, although instruction 6 stated that the Appellants claimed that the District’s negligence\n\ncaused the Appellants’ “injuries and damages” (CP at 6420) and instruction 22 discussed whether\n\nthe District’s negligence was a “proximate cause of injury or damage to the [Appellants]” (CP at\n\n6436), instruction 28 told the jury,\n\n               If your verdict is for the [Appellants], then you must determine the amount\n       of money which will reasonably and fairly compensate the [Appellants] for such\n       damages as you find were proximately caused by the [District].\n               ....\n               The burden of proving damages rests with the [Appellants] and it is for you\n       to determine, based upon the evidence, whether any particular element has been\n       proved by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\nCP at 6442-43. Thus, the instructions allowed the jury to conclude that even if it found that the\n\nDistrict was liable, the jury could decline to award damages to the Appellants if the jury was not\n\nconvinced that the Appellants had proven that the amount of compensation they were entitled to\n\nwas greater than “$0.”\n\n       When we review whether the answers to a special verdict are reconcilable under the\n\ninstructions and the verdict as a whole, we must try to reconcile the answers where possible. See\n\nAlvarez, 76 Wn. App. at 743. Here, the jury’s verdict may be reconciled under the District’s theory\n\n\n                                                16\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\nthat the jury decided that the value of the Appellants’ damages was “$0.” We reject the Appellants’\n\narguments that a new trial should have been granted because the verdict was irreconcilable.10\n\n       Next, we turn to whether the trial evidence substantially supports the verdict.\n\n                    C. SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT A “$0” VERDICT\n\n       The Appellants further argue that even if the verdict was reconcilable, the trial court abused\n\nits discretion when it ruled that there was substantial evidence to support a “$0” verdict for each\n\nAppellant. Again, we disagree.\n\n       A trial court abuses its discretion when it denies a motion for a new trial where the verdict\n\nis contrary to the evidence. Sommer v.

We review the record to determine whether there was sufficient evidence to\n\nsupport the verdict: that is, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\n\nparty, there must be “‘substantial evidence’” to support the verdict and the verdict must not be\n\nfounded on mere theory or speculation.

Kelly,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1145062\"><a href=\"/opinion/1145062/hojem-v-kelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">143</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 145, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1145062\"><a href=\"/opinion/1145062/hojem-v-kelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">606</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1980)).\n\n       We have stated that\n\n       when a court reviews a jury’s verdict\n              [the] court will not willingly assume that the jury did not fairly and\n              objectively consider the evidence and the contentions of the parties relative\n\n\n10\n   We note that the Appellants proposed the instruction that became instruction 5 and that the\nAppellants had an opportunity to clarify instruction 5 when the jury posed a question regarding\nthat instruction. The Appellants, however, chose not to do so and repeatedly “urg[ed] the Court\nnot to give” any additional instructions. 12 RP at 2212, 2215. Further, we are not asked to decide\nwhether it was error to give instruction 5 together with instruction 19, and thus we do not reach\nthis issue. We have doubts whether instruction 19 was properly given due to the interplay between\ninstructions 19 and 5 as discussed here. But Appellant’s challenge to instruction 19 is solely on\nthe grounds that it was “misleading and confusing” because it was negatively phrased, redundant,\nand biased in favor of the District.

The inferences to be drawn from the evidence are for\n               the jury and not for [the] court. The credibility of witnesses and the weight\n               to be given to the evidence are matters within the province of the jury and\n               even if convinced that a wrong verdict has been rendered, the reviewing\n               court will not substitute its judgment for that of the jury, so long as there\n               was evidence which, if believed, would support the verdict rendered.\n\nEstate of Stalkup v.

However, the jury\n\nunanimously declined to award any compensatory damages. Kozma, 412 N.J. Super. at 321.

Rather, “the evidence was susceptible to an\n\n                                                 18\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\ninterpretation that minimized the monetary equivalent of plaintiff’s pain and suffering to its\n\nvanishing point. . . . The jury could reasonably find that the impact of the fall was so insignificant\n\nthat no additional injury beyond plaintiff’s preexisting condition was sustained.” Kozma, 412 N.J.\n\nat 325-27.\n\n       Here, the District and the Appellants hotly disputed whether or not DH suffered any\n\ncompensable damages because of the molestation. The District’s expert acknowledged that DH\n\nhad been briefly upset on the afternoon of the bus incident but also that the\n\n       best available information in the records is that [DH] really wasn’t any different in\n       the immediate time frame following what happened on the bus outside of the\n       afternoon when supposedly something happened and carrying forward. So the\n       picture that emerges is one of someone who is pretty much the same after the time\n       of whatever happened on the bus as she was before.\n\n8 RP at 1531. The expert further testified at length that all of DH’s symptoms were attributable\n\nnot to any molestations but to her preexisting Trisomy X. Finally, the expert opined that the\n\n“[p]robability” was that DH would not “have any future problems” related to the molestation,\n\nwhich DH did not seem to remember. 8 RP at 1545. Notably, the Appellants’ own expert\n\nconfirmed on cross-examination that DH did not independently remember the incidents.\n\n       DH’s mother also testified that DH’s toileting issues had begun in kindergarten and that\n\nDH’s mother did not report any of DH’s symptoms allegedly related to the molestations until long\n\nafter the incidents. Finally, multiple teachers testified that they witnessed no changes in DH’s\n\nbehavior following the molestations. Thus, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\nDistrict, there is substantial evidence to support the jury’s award of “$0” as DH’s compensation\n\nfor the molestations. Sommer, 104 Wn. App. at 172.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 19\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\n       The parties did not as clearly contest whether DH’s parents suffered damages. In fact, at\n\ntrial, Dr. Vandenbelt confirmed that DH’s mother suffered symptoms including guilt, anger,\n\nanxiety, and effects to her preexisting depression, all of which resulted from DH’s mother’s own\n\nunderstanding of what had happened on the bus. During the Appellants’ case, they presented\n\nundisputed testimony that learning about the molestation had caused DH’s mother to feel “like\n\n[her] whole world was coming down.” 7 RP at 1237. The Appellants’ expert briefly testified that\n\nDH’s mother suffered as a result of DH’s abuse—in particular, she worried and felt “guilty,” and\n\nshe could not “stop thinking about” and imagining “what must have happened on the bus.” 6 RP\n\nat 1031. The abuse had caused DH’s mother to experience depression and anxiety. DH’s father\n\ntestified about his “disturbing” fears that DH’s future would be affected because she had been\n\nmolested. 7 RP at 1360. Notably, the District did not focus upon DH’s mother’s injuries during\n\nher cross-examination and did not cross-examine DH’s father at all.\n\n       However, even where several witnesses have given uncontroverted testimony, a jury is\n\n“bound to decide the issue on its own fair judgment,” assisted by the testimony. Stalkup, 145 Wn.\n\nApp. at 591. DH’s parents’ testimony about “guilt,” “anger,” “depression,” and “anxiety,”\n\nalthough evidence of emotional upset, could reasonably have been assessed by the jury not to rise\n\nto the level of upset that would merit a damages recovery. See, e.g., Kozma, 412 N.J. Super. at\n\n325-27. Thus, again, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the District, substantial\n\nevidence supports a “$0” verdict for DH’s parents. For these reasons, we hold that the trial court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion when it denied Appellant’s new trial motion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                20\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\n                                II. JURY INSTRUCTION CHALLENGE\n\n       The Appellants argue that the trial court abused its discretion when it gave instruction 19,\n\nwhich the Appellants contend was (1) misleading and confusing because it was phrased negatively,\n\n(2) redundant with instructions 22 and 28, and (3) slanted in favor of the District. The Appellants\n\nfurther contend that (4) the claimed error was harmful because instruction 19 allegedly provides\n\nthe only grounds to reconcile the jury’s verdict. We hold that the Appellants’ arguments either\n\nfail or are waived.\n\n                                       A.

Negatively phrased instructions may be objectionable for at least two\n\nreasons: first, they may be misleading and confuse the jury, and second, they may slant the\n\ninstructions in the opposing party’s favor.

WAIVER\n\n       In its proposed jury instructions, the District included instruction 19 with an additional\n\nsentence at the end. At a jury instructions conference, the trial court explained that it would include\n\n\n\n\n                                                  21\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\ninstruction 19 (without the additional sentence) as the instruction used in Rollins, a case with\n\n“significant parallels to this case.” 10 RP at 1930 (citing </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">148</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">). Instruction 19 stated,\n\n               In calculating a damage award, you must not include any damages that were\n       caused by acts of Gary Shafer and not proximately caused by negligence of the\n       [District]. Any damages caused solely by Gary Shafer and not proximately caused\n       by negligence of the [District] must be segregated from and not made a part of any\n       damage award against [the District].\n\nCP at 6433. The Appellants objected to instruction 19 and argued that the instruction “unfairly\n\nand prejudicially” “frame[d] the issue in the negative and ha[d] the jury excluding damages\n\nimmediately as opposed to describing in a positive fashion what they are to award” and misstated\n\nthe law. CP at 6155; 11 RP at 2066.\n\n       On appeal, the Appellants reiterate their argument that instruction 19 was improper because\n\nit was negatively framed and further argue that instruction 19 is redundant and slanted in the\n\nDistrict’s favor. The arguments that the instruction is redundant and slanted in the District’s favor\n\nwere not made before the trial court. Thus, we decline to review these arguments unless\n\nAppellants’ instruction conference arguments were “‘sufficient to apprise the trial judge of the\n\nnature and substance of the objection[s].’” Washburn, 178 Wn.2d at 746 (quoting Crossen v.\n\nSkagit County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1177393\"><a href=\"/opinion/1177393/crossen-v-skagit-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">355</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 358, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1177393\"><a href=\"/opinion/1177393/crossen-v-skagit-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">669</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1244</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1983)).\n\n       Here, the Appellants’ argument that instruction 19 is redundant with other instructions was\n\nnot raised in the trial court and accordingly has not been preserved. See Millies, 185 Wn.2d at\n\n313; Washburn, 178 Wn.2d at 746. Further, the Appellants’ argument that instruction 19 is one-\n\nsided is not sufficiently related to the Appellants’ argument that it is confusing—Terrell indicates\n\nthat one-sidedness and capacity to be misleading are distinct reasons that a negatively phrased\n\ninstruction may be objectionable. See 190 Wn. App. at 505. For these reasons, we hold that the\n\n\n                                                 22\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\nAppellants preserved only their arguments that instruction 19 was misleading, and accordingly\n\nconfusing, because it is negatively phrased.\n\n                                   C. NO ABUSE OF DISCRETION\n\n        As discussed, the Appellants’ remaining argument is that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion because instruction 19 was misleading and confusing. We disagree.\n\n        Contrary to the Appellants’ arguments, there is no per se rule that the giving of a negatively\n\nphrased jury instruction is an abuse of discretion. The Appellants rely upon Rickert v. Geppert, in\n\nwhich the court determined that an instruction “not to compare negligence of the parties, if any\n\nexists” was more likely to confuse, than aid, the jury. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1229046\"><a href=\"/opinion/1229046/rickert-v-geppert/\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 355-56, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1229046\"><a href=\"/opinion/1229046/rickert-v-geppert/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">964</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1964).\n\nBut Rickert does not absolutely bar the giving of a jury instruction phrased in the negative; rather,\n\nthere, the court granted a retrial on other grounds and determined that while there was “no abuse\n\nof judicial discretion in the giving of the instruction,” a similar instruction “should not be given in\n\na retrial” if it were proposed. 64 Wn.2d at 356.\n\n        Here, the trial court gave instruction 19 because the instruction had been used in Rollins.\n\nIn Rollins, a passenger sued King County Metro Transit for negligence arising out of an altercation\n\non a Metro bus. 148 Wn. App. at 372-73. Division One of this court observed that “[t]he\n\nintentional conduct of unknown assailants was a proximate cause of injury” but that the passenger\n\nsought recovery solely from Metro and not from the assailants who intentionally attacked her.\n\nRollins, 148 Wn. App. at 379. Division One held that it was not misleading to give an instruction\n\nthat,\n\n        “[i]n calculating a damage award, you must not include any damages that were\n        caused by acts of the unknown assailants and not proximately caused by negligence\n        of the defendant. Any damages caused solely by the unknown assailants and not\n\n\n                                                   23\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\n       proximately caused by negligence of defendant [Metro] must be segregated from\n       and not made a part of any damage award against [Metro.]”\n\nRollins, 148 Wn. App. at 379. Given the similarity of this case to Rollins, the trial court’s decision\n\nthat instruction 19 would be helpful to the jury and was not misleading or confusing was not\n\nunreasonable. Accordingly, the Appellants’ argument that the trial court abused its discretion\n\nwhen it gave instruction 19 because that instruction was negatively phrased fails. Because the trial\n\ncourt acted within its discretion and accordingly did not err, we do not address the Appellants’\n\ncontention that the alleged error was not harmless.\n\n                                      III. SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n\n       The Appellants contend that the trial court erred when it denied their summary judgment\n\nmotion on liability.11 We decline to address this argument.\n\n       An issue is moot if we can no longer provide effective relief. SEIU Healthcare 775NW v.\n\nGregoire, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">593</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 602, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2600023\"><a href=\"/opinion/2600023/seiu-healthcare-775nw-v-gregoire/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">774</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2010). Because we affirm the jury verdict finding\n\nthe District liable, it is no longer material that the trial court denied summary judgment on liability.\n\n                                     IV. EVIDENTIARY RULING\n\n       The Appellants also argue that the trial court abused its discretion when it excluded the\n\nDistrict’s liability admissions from Crunkleton. The Appellants contend that exclusion of the\n\nDistrict’s prior liability admissions was not harmless error because had the evidence been\n\n\n\n\n11\n   The Appellants also argue that the summary judgment ruling was “not harmless.” Br. of\nAppellants at 55. But we do not address this argument because we do not review the denial of\nsummary judgment motions for harmless error. See Christensen v. Grant County Hosp. Dist.

We reject this argument.\n\n          Evidentiary error is harmless unless it affects the outcome of the case. Mut. of Enumclaw\n\nIns. Co. v. Gregg Roofing, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash.

No. 1, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2615206\"><a href=\"/opinion/2615206/brown-v-fire-protec-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 196, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2615206\"><a href=\"/opinion/2615206/brown-v-fire-protec-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">668</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">571</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(1983).\n\n          We assume without deciding that the trial court abused its discretion when it declined to\n\nadmit the Crunkleton documents. Turning to harmless error, the Appellants do not argue that the\n\nCrunkleton documents would have proven damages. The Appellants argue instead that the\n\nadmissions were probative “regarding the central issues of duty, breach, and liability.” Br. of\n\nAppellants at 65. We thus assume that any effect of their admission would go to liability. As\n\ndiscussed, the jury found that the District was, in fact, liable. Therefore, even if we were to agree\n\nthat the trial court erred, the error would be harmless because it could not have affected the liability\n\nverdict. See Brown, 100 Wn.2d at 196.\n\n          The Appellants provide no authority for the proposition that the exclusion of evidence is\n\nharmful merely because it would have allowed for a more “streamlined” presentation of a party’s\n\ncase. Here, the Appellants were unable to more fully present their damages case because they\n\nwrongly assumed that the District would not contest liability, failed to seek a continuance, and\n\neven opposed the District’s request for a continuance shortly before trial. We reject the Appellants’\n\narguments and hold that even assuming error in the exclusion of the Crunkleton documents, that\n\nerror would have been harmless.\n\n\n                                                  25\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\n                              V. TRIAL COURT ATTORNEY FEE MOTION\n\n        The Appellants contend that they are entitled to an award of fees under CR 37(c) because\n\nthe District “fail[ed] to admit its negligence prior to trial,” in particular its “breach of its duty.” Br.\n\nof Appellants at 72, 75. We reject the Appellants’ arguments.\n\n        “We review a trial court’s decision to impose discovery sanctions under CR 37(c) for an\n\nabuse of discretion”; a trial court “abuses its discretion if its decision is manifestly unreasonable\n\nor based on untenable grounds.” Thompson v. King Feed & Nutrition Serv., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">447</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n472, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2581654\"><a href=\"/opinion/2581654/thompson-v-king-feed-nutrition-service-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">378</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005). CR 36(a) governs requests for admission of the truth of matters\n\nincluding “the application of law to fact”; the purpose of the rule “is to eliminate from controversy\n\nfactual matters that will not be disputed at trial.” Thompson, 153 Wn.2d at 472. Thus, “a party is\n\nnot required to concede either factual matters central to the lawsuit or legal conclusions.”\n\nThompson, 153 Wn.2d at 472.\n\n        If a party fails to admit the . . . truth of any matter as requested under [CR] 36, and\n        if the party requesting the admissions thereafter proves . . . the truth of the matter,\n        the party may apply to the court for an order requiring the other party to pay the\n        requesting party the reasonable expenses incurred in making that proof, including\n        reasonable attorney fees. The court shall make the order unless it finds that (1) the\n        request was held objectionable pursuant to [CR] 36(a), or (2) the admission sought\n        was of no substantial importance, or (3) the party failing to admit had reasonable\n        ground to believe the fact was not true[,] or (4) there was other good reason for the\n        failure to admit.\n\nCR 37(c).\n\n        In September 2015, the Appellants requested that the District admit that it “failed to act\n\nreasonably in protecting D.H. from [Shafer’s] sexual abuse” and that the District “breached its\n\nduty of care in failing to protect D.H. from [Shafer’s] sexual abuse.” CP at 4561-62. The District\n\nrefused these requests and explained that each request did “not refer to a factual issue but\n\n\n                                                    26\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\ninvolve[d] a question of law.” CP at 4561-62. After trial, the Appellants moved for fees and costs\n\nand argued that fees were appropriate under CR 37(c) because the Appellants’ requests sought the\n\nDistrict’s “opinion with regard to the application of law to fact.” CP at 6703. The District\n\nresponded that it had properly refused to “admit negligence” and that the requests were improper,\n\nrelying on both the rules that a party is not required to admit factual matters central to the lawsuit\n\nand that requests for admission cannot request that a party admit a legal conclusion. CP at 7431.\n\nThe trial court denied the Appellants’ request.\n\n       In Thompson, the plaintiff requested that the defendant admit that its negligence was,\n\namong other things, “the sole proximate cause” of a fire. 153 Wn.2d at 473. Our Supreme Court\n\nnoted that although this request could be characterized as the “‘application of law to fact’” under\n\nCR 36(a), the request “undoubtedly requested [the defendant] to admit [a] legal conclusion[].”\n\nThompson, 153 Wn.2d at 474 (quoting CR 36(a)). “Negligence and proximate cause are legal\n\nconclusions and are matters usually reserved for the jury.” Thompson, 153 Wn.2d at 474. Thus,\n\ndespite the request’s phrasing, the defendant had “‘good reason for the failure to admit’” under CR\n\n37(c)(4).\n\n       Here, unlike in Thompson, at issue are admissions requiring that the District admit breach\n\nof duty, rather than proximate cause or negligence. See 153 Wn.2d at 473. The Appellants argue\n\nthat breach of duty is “‘a question[] of fact for a jury,’” so that Thompson should not apply. Br. of\n\nAppellants at 74 (quoting Bowers v. Marzano, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash.

But\n\nthe Appellants’ reliance upon Bowers is misplaced—that case states that both breach of duty and\n\nproximate cause are “generally questions of fact for a jury.” 170 Wn. App. at 506. As discussed,\n\nThompson held that proximate cause is a legal conclusion usually reserved for the jury. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span>\n\n\n                                                  <span class=\"page\">27</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\fNo. 48583-4-II\n\n\nat 474. Thus, Bowers’ language that proximate cause and breach of duty are both questions of fact\n\nfor the jury fails as a reason to distinguish Thompson.\n\n        Because the District was not required to concede breach of duty, the District had “‘good\n\nreason for the failure to admit.’”       Thompson, 153 Wn.2d at 474 (quoting CR 37(c)(4)).\n\nAccordingly, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the Appellants’\n\nmotion for costs under CR 37.12\n\n        We affirm.\n\n        A majority of the panel having determined that this opinion will not be printed in the\n\nWashington Appellate Reports, but will be filed for public record in accordance with RCW 2.06.040,\n\nit is so ordered.\n\n\n\n                                                     JOHANSON, J.\n We concur:\n\n\n\n WORSWICK, J.\n\n\n\n\n BJORGEN, C.J.\n\n\n\n\n12\n   In the alternative, the District was not required to admit breach of duty because breach of duty\nwas a central issue in dispute.

The District also elicited testimony from Shafer that he had\ncarefully hidden his actions from others to avoid detection.\n                                                  28\n\f</pre>",
