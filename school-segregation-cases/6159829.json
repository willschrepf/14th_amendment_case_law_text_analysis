They contend that the\n\nGeneral Assembly and other Respondents collectively have failed to live up to the\n\nmandate, embodied in our Constitution’s Education Clause, that the General Assembly\n\n“provide for the maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of public\n\neducation.”2 They further allege that the hybrid state-local approach to school financing\n\nresults in untenable funding and resource disparities between wealthier and poorer\n\nschool districts.   They claim that the General Assembly’s failure legislatively to\n\n\n\n\n1\n       This case was reassigned to this author.\n2\n        See PA. CONST. art. III, § 14 (“The General Assembly shall provide for the\nmaintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of public education to\nserve the needs of the Commonwealth.”). While the constitutional mandate is directed\nsolely to the General Assembly, the remaining Commonwealth Respondents, who raise\nno specific challenge to their inclusion as parties, are named because Petitioners seek\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief that would constrain the executive branch’s\nadministration and enforcement of the challenged school financing scheme.\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 2\n\fameliorate those disparities to a greater extent than it does constitutes a violation of the\n\nequal protection of law guaranteed by the Pennsylvania Constitution.3\n\n       The Commonwealth Court, sitting in its original jurisdiction, dismissed both\n\nclaims at the pleading stage, relying upon this Court’s prior dispositions of similar\n\ncases.4   Arguably, these prior decisions held that such challenges to prerogatives\n\nconstitutionally conferred upon the General Assembly were political questions that the\n\ncourts cannot adjudicate without infringing upon the constitutional separation of powers.\n\nConcluding that these decisions controlled the issues presented, the Commonwealth\n\nCourt ruled that Petitioners’ claims lay outside the reach of the judiciary as non-\n\njusticiable political questions pursuant to the principles set forth in Baker v. Carr,\n\n369 U.S. 186 (1962), and its federal and Pennsylvania progeny.\n\n       It is settled beyond peradventure that constitutional promises must be kept.\n\nSince Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803), it has been well-established that the\n\nseparation of powers in our tripartite system of government typically depends upon\n\njudicial review to check acts or omissions by the other branches in derogation of\n\nconstitutional requirements.   That same separation sometimes demands that courts\n\n3\n        Petitioners state their equal protection claim solely in terms of Article III,\nSection 32 of our Constitution, which by its terms proscribes the enactment of “local or\nspecial laws” when the circumstance “can be provided for by general law.” Unlike the\nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Section 32 does not speak\nexpressly in terms of equal protection. Nonetheless, we long have gleaned equal\nprotection principles from Section 32, which we have held is substantially coterminous\nwith the federal Equal Protection Clause. See Balt. & Ohio R. Co. v. Dep’t of Labor &\nIndus., 334 A.2d 636, 643 (Pa. 1975) (“[T]he content of the two provisions is not\nsignificantly different.”).\n4\n      See Malone v. Hayden, 197 A. 344, 352 (Pa. 1938) (hereinafter “the Teachers’\nTenure Act Case”); Danson v. Casey, 399 A.2d 360 (Pa. 1979); Marrero v.\nCommonwealth, 739 A.2d 110 (Pa. 1999) (hereinafter “Marrero II”).\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 3\n\fleave matters exclusively to the political branches. Nonetheless, “[t]he idea that any\n\nlegislature . . . can conclusively determine for the people and for the courts that what it\n\nenacts in the form of law, or what it authorizes its agents to do, is consistent with the\n\nfundamental law, is in opposition to the theory of our institutions.” Smyth v. Ames,\n\n169 U.S. 466, 527 (1898).5 Thus, we must be skeptical of calls to abstain from a given\n\nconstitutional dispute. We hold that this is not a case that requires such abstention.\n\nAccordingly, we reverse the Commonwealth Court’s contrary ruling.\n\nI.     Background\n\n       A.     The Pennsylvania Constitution and Public Education6\n\n       The lineage of charters that led to Pennsylvania’s current Constitution offers a\n\nwindow into the shifting priorities and prerogatives animating the Commonwealth’s\n\nsometimes fractious history. This history informed the introduction and evolution of\n\nwhat became the Education Clause, a provision that has remained in our Constitution in\n\nmaterially the same form since 1874. We choose as a starting point William Penn’s\n\n1682 Frame of Government of Pennsylvania. This was Pennsylvania’s first charter, “in\n\neffect a constitution agreed upon between Penn and the colonists,” and “the first real\n\n5\n      Overruled on other grounds by Fed. Power Comm’n v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co.\nof Am., 315 U.S. 575 (1942).\n6\n        The following account draws principally upon section three of Kenneth Gormley,\net al.’s THE PENNSYLVANIA CONSTITUTION: A TREATISE ON RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES, the\nexemplary, unpublished single-judge Commonwealth Court opinion written by the\nHonorable Dan Pellegrini in Pennsylvania Association of Rural & Small Schools v.\nRidge, 11 M.D. 1991, slip op. at 86-105 (Cmwlth. Ct. July 9, 1998) (hereinafter\n“PARSS”), affirmed by PARSS v. Ridge, 737 A.2d 246 (Pa. 1999) (per curiam), and\nsources cited therein. A copy of Judge Pellegrini’s opinion in PARSS is appended to\nPetitioners’ brief in the instant appeal. We provide direct citations to these sources only\nwhere quotations are drawn from them. Additional intertextual citations refer to sources\nwith which we supplement the above authors’ accounts.\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 4\n\f[C]onstitution followed in the colony of Pennsylvania.”      Gormley, et al., supra n.6,\n\n§ 3.2[a] at 33 (hereinafter “RIGHTS & LIBERTIES”) (citing Thomas Raeburn White,\n\nCOMMENTARIES    ON THE   CONSTITUTION   OF   PENNSYLVANIA xvii (1907)). Notably, Penn’s\n\nFramework provided for the creation of schools, and the colonial assembly passed\n\neducation legislation as early as 1683. William Penn himself stressed that the people\n\nshould “spare no cost” in providing for education, opining that “by such parsimony all is\n\nlost that is saved.”   PARSS at 87 (quoting Philip S. Klein, et al., A HISTORY          OF\n\nPENNSYLVANIA 384 (2d ed. 1973)). The Framework was short-lived, as Penn issued the\n\nCharter of Privileges in 1701, notable for its addition of certain defined individual\n\nliberties, and in particular its expansion of religious freedom and concomitant\n\nbroadening of the electoral franchise, which, in turn, transformed Pennsylvania into a\n\nhaven for oppressed religious sects. Notably absent from the Charter, though, was any\n\nprovision concerning education.\n\n       Continued economic growth, as well as demographic, economic, and political\n\nchanges, led to the Pennsylvania Convention of 1776. The Constitution that emerged\n\nfrom the convention, which came to be a model for other state charters, added\n\nextensive and now-familiar procedural protections, intra-governmental checks and\n\nbalances, and a detailed declaration of rights. Education also returned in the 1776\n\nConstitution’s mandate that “[a] school or schools shall be established in each county by\n\nthe legislature, for the convenient instruction of youth, with such salaries to the masters\n\npaid by the public, as may enable them to instruct youth at low prices.” PA. CONST. OF\n\n1776 § 44.\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 5\n\f       Aspects of the 1776 Constitution, including in particular its further expansion of\n\nthe franchise, its unicameral legislature, its weak executive Council of Censors lacking\n\nveto power, and a judiciary characterized by the combination of democratic selection\n\nand the brevity of judges’ terms, provoked conflict among political factions. This led to\n\ngridlock, recrimination, and, in due time, the 1789 Pennsylvania constitutional\n\nconvention, which culminated in the adoption of the 1790 Constitution.             The new\n\nConstitution divided legislative power into two houses, replaced the Council of Censors\n\nwith a unitary executive having veto power, and extended life tenure on good behavior\n\nto judges who were appointed rather than elected.7          Like other state constitutions\n\nenacted in that era, it resembled in its broad strokes, and in its conception of tripartite\n\nrepresentative democracy, the United States Constitution.\n\n       The fledgling federal constitution conspicuously omitted any mention of\n\neducation, which presumably was among the unenumerated powers reserved to the\n\nstates by the Tenth Amendment.8          But in Pennsylvania, the Constitution of 1790\n\npreserved generally the 1776 Constitution’s educational mandate, refining the language\n\nof the earlier clause to direct the legislature “to provide, by law, for the establishment of\n\nschools throughout the State, in such manner that the poor may be taught gratis.”\n\nPA. CONST. OF 1790 art. VII, § 1.\n\n\n7\n       The method of selecting judges in Pennsylvania repeatedly has changed over\nthe years. Presently, the selection of judges by partisan elections, subject to decennial\nretention elections, reflects changes effectuated in the 1968 Constitution. See generally\nPA. CONST. art. V, §§ 12-15.\n8\n       “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor\nprohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”\nU.S. CONST. amend X.\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 6\n\f      Judge Dan Pellegrini has provided a useful account of how the 1790 Education\n\nClause’s mandate was applied in the decades that followed:\n\n      Laws effectuating the [1790 Education Clause], passed in 1802, 1804[,]\n      and 1809, allowed parents who declared themselves paupers to receive\n      state aid to pay tuition at private institutions. But the “pauper school”\n      approach reached few children, and as late as 1828, the state had paid\n      the tuition of only 4,477 children that year. Ellwood P. Cubberley, PUBLIC\n      EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 192 (2d ed. 1934). Over half the state’s\n      400,000 children were not enrolled in school. Stuart G. Noble, A HISTORY\n      OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 160 (1938).\n\n      The cause of universal public education gained wide support during the\n      1820s. The Pennsylvania Society for the Promotion of Public Schools,\n      founded in 1827, petitioned for a revision of the state’s school laws. None\n      of the governors during the period that the 1809 law was in effect believed\n      that the constitutional mandate was being fulfilled. In his 1823 inaugural\n      address to the state legislature, Governor [John] Schulze stated:\n\n         The object of the convention seems to have been, to diffuse the\n         means of rudimental education so extensively, that they should be\n         completely within the reach of all—the poor who could not pay for\n         them, as well as the rich who could. Convinced that even liberty\n         without knowledge, is but a precarious blessing, I cannot therefore\n         too strongly recommend this subject to your consideration.\n\n      JOURNAL OF THE THIRTY-FOURTH HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 1823-24 151-\n      52, quoted in Lawrence A. Cremin, THE AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOL 104\n      (1951) (hereinafter “AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOL”). George Wolf, another\n      advocate of public education, was elected to two successive terms as\n      governor, beginning in 1829. In his message to the legislature in 1830,\n      Governor Wolf forcefully stated:\n\n         Of the various projects which present themselves, as tending to\n         contribute most essentially to the welfare and happiness of a\n         people, and which come within the scope of legislative action, and\n         require legislative aid, there is none which gives more ample\n         promise of success, than that of a liberal and enlightened system of\n         education, by means of which, the light of knowledge will be\n         diffused throughout the whole community, and imparted to every\n         individual susceptible of partaking of its blessings; to the poor as\n\n\n\n                                    [J-82-2016] - 7\n\f   well as to the rich, so that all may be fitted to participate in, and to\n   fulfil all the duties which each one owes to himself, to God, and to\n   his country. The [C]onstitution of Pennsylvania imperatively enjoins\n   the establishment of such a system. Public opinion demands it.\n   The state of public morals calls for it; and the security and stability\n   of the invaluable privileges which we have inherited from our\n   ancestors require our immediate attention to it.\n\nVI REGISTER OF PENNSYLVANIA 386 (1830), quoted in AMERICAN COMMON\nSCHOOL 104-105. In his 1831 message to the legislature, Governor Wolf\nsaid:\n\n   The improvement of the mind should be the first care of the\n   American statesman, and the dissemination of learning and\n   knowledge ought to form one of the principal objects of his\n   ambition. Virtue and intelligence are the only appropriate pillars\n   upon which a [r]epublican Government can securely rest . . . .\n   Under these impressions, no opportunity has been omitted\n   earnestly to press upon the attention of the legislature, the\n   indispensable necessity of establishing by law a general system of\n   common school education . . . .\n\nV PENNSYLVANIA ARCHIVES, FOURTH SERIES 962-64, quoted in Klein &\nHoogenboom, A HISTORY OF PENNSYLVANIA [page citation omitted] (2d ed.\n1973).\n\nThe efforts of the proponents of public education eventually produced\nresults. In 1831, the Report of the House Committee on Education\naddressed the shortcomings of the pauper school laws:\n\n   [T]he unremitted attention of your committee has been directed to\n   the labour of compiling the details of a system of common schools,\n   in which eventually all the children of our [C]ommonwealth may at\n   least be instructed in reading, and a knowledge of the English\n   language, in writing, arithmetic and geography—subjecting them to\n   such regulations as may best promote their future usefulness—\n   securing competent and able teachers, and providing for their\n   support . . . .\n\nVII REGISTER OF PENNSYLVANIA 386 (1830), quoted in AMERICAN COMMON\nSCHOOL 105. This report contributed to the passage of a bill creating a\npermanent school fund. During the 1833-34 session, Senator Samuel\n\n\n\n                               [J-82-2016] - 8\n\f       Breck was appointed chairman of a joint committee on education which\n       produced a report stating the following:\n\n          A radical defect in our laws upon the subject of education, is that\n          the public aid now given, and imperfectly given, is confined to the\n          poor. Aware of this, your committee have taken care to exclude the\n          word poor, from the bill which will accompany this report, meaning\n          to make the system general, that is to say, to form an educational\n          association between the rich, the comparatively rich, and the\n          destitute. Let them all fare alike in primary schools; receive the\n          same elementary instruction; imbibe the same republican spirit, and\n          be animated by a feeling of perfect equality.\n\n       XIII REGISTER OF PENNSYLVANIA 97 (1834), quoted in AMERICAN COMMON\n       SCHOOL 106. The bill accompanying the report was passed into law and\n       created a system of public schools. The act created school districts in\n       every ward, township and borough, which were given the choice of\n       participating in the new system or continuing to operate under the 1809\n       mandate of providing only for the education of the poor. To participate in\n       the disbursement of state funds, each district was required to raise by\n       local effort an amount twice that to be received from the state.[9]\n\n       While the new law was passed almost unanimously and received broad\n       support among the New England settlers of the northern tier counties and\n       the Scotch-Irish Presbyterians of the western counties, opponents rallied\n\n9\n        While, as detailed below, the precise ratio of state funds to local funds\ncomprising the non-federal share of any given school district’s budget will vary from one\ndistrict to the next, it is worth noting that, overall, the two-to-one ratio of local to state\nfunding approximates the overall ratio in effect nearly two hundred years later.\nHowever, as one commentator observes, it was not always so:\n       The high[-]water mark for [Pennsylvania] state contributions to public\n       education funding was in 1974-75, when the state reimbursed school\n       districts for 55% of their actual instructional expenses. By 2003-04, that\n       figure had dropped to 34%. The shift was not accidental: in 1983, the\n       state legislature removed language from the School Code which held the\n       state to a goal of paying 50% of statewide district instructional costs.\nAnn L. Martin, Comment, Been There, Done That: What Next? Looking Back & Ahead\nat Litigation Prospects for School Funding Reform in Pa., 15 W IDENER L.J. 815, 816 n.6\n(2006) (citing The Education and Policy Leadership Center, PENNSYLVANIA EDUCATION\nFINANCE PRIMER 7 (Nov. 2005)).\n\n\n\n                                       [J-82-2016] - 9\n\f      to repeal the law in the Senate and almost succeeded in the House.\n      Three groups were allied in their opposition to public education: property\n      owners who opposed the use of taxes to fund the system; religious groups\n      like the [Quakers], the Lutherans and the Mennonites who supported their\n      own parochial schools; and the German-speaking settlers of the east-\n      central counties who were opposed to the English language requirements.\n      Thaddeus Stevens, then a member of the House of Representatives,\n      eloquently spoke in defense of the school act and the supporters of public\n      education were able to prevent the repeal of the law.[10]\n\nPARSS at 88-92 (citations modified; footnotes omitted).\n\n      It was left to Governor Wolf’s successor, Joseph Ritner, and the first\n\nSuperintendent of Common Schools, Thomas H. Burrowes, to implement the newly-\n\ndesigned system that followed. By 1837, 742 of 987 districts were participating in the\n\nstate system. The notion of the pauper school had been marginalized, and most parts\n\nof the state accepted a tax-based system of public education for all young people.\n\n      In its contribution to and convergence with other state charters and the federal\n\nconstitution, Pennsylvania’s 1790 Constitution reflected the animating principles of a\n\nburgeoning nation. Nonetheless, simmering conflicts among competing factions, in part\n\nreflecting the divergent interests of the Commonwealth’s far-flung eastern and western\n\n10\n        As reflected by the Senate’s passage of a repeal bill in 1835, opposition to the\n1834 act was widespread and fierce, perhaps costing Governor Wolf his job in the 1835\nelection and leading to the election of repeal-inclined senators and representatives.\nThirty-eight of fifty-one counties sent petitions seeking repeal, and at least two more\npetitioned for modifications. Only eleven counties refrained entirely from seeking\nchanges to the new act. The Famous Speech of Hon. Thaddeus Stevens of\nPennsylvania in Opposition to the Repeal of the Common School Law of 1834, in the\nHouse of Representatives of Pennsylvania, April 11, 1835, Introduction, at 3, available\nat https://goo.gl/vZ8GN0 (last reviewed Aug. 28, 2017). Mr. Stevens’ entire speech is\nworthy of review, but among his observations was that, “[i]f education be of admitted\nimportance to the people under all forms of government, and of unquestioned necessity\nwhen they govern themselves, it follows of course that its cultivation and diffusion is a\nmatter of public concern, and a duty which every government owes to its people.” Id.\nat 4 (emphasis in original).\n\n\n\n                                    [J-82-2016] - 10\n\fpopulations, led to a successful 1837 popular referendum calling for a constitutional\n\nconvention.    The resulting 1838 Constitution adjusted the structure of government,\n\nproviding refinements in the protection of rights and the imposition of additional\n\nlimitations on legislative power. The 1790 Constitution’s Education Clause remained\n\nunchanged.11\n\n      Judge Pellegrini continues:\n\n      The 1850s saw an expansion of legislative activity concerning education.\n      In 1851, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the clause\n      concerning free education for the poor, contained in the education\n      provision of the constitutions of 1790 and 1838, was not a limitation on the\n      power of the legislat[ure]. Commonwealth v. Hartman, 17 Pa. 118 (1851).\n      The [C]ourt held that the clause defined the minimum legislative effort and\n      did not enjoin the legislature from doing more. Id. In 1852, another\n      staunch supporter of public education, William Bigler, was elected\n      governor. . . . Governor Bigler oversaw an expansion of state efforts in\n      education, which included the establishment of the first state normal\n      schools and the State Teachers’ Association and the first publication of\n      the Pennsylvania School Journal.\n\n      During this period, Pennsylvania was not alone in its efforts to institute a\n      universal system of public education. People like Horace Mann in\n      Massachusetts, Henry Barnard in Connecticut, Samuel Lewis in Ohio, and\n      John Pierce in Michigan led movements advocating publicly-funded\n      universal education. Some states added education clauses to their\n      constitutions or strengthened their commitment to education by passing\n      new legislation. The phrase “thorough and efficient” was first included in\n\n11\n       Interestingly, as a reflection of the Commonwealth’s collective, ongoing\ncommitment to an education that might fairly be called “thorough,” delegates to the 1837\nconvention defeated an amendment that would have added “common” as a modifier to\nthe Education Clause. In the parlance of that era, such language would have purported\nto restrict the state’s obligation to the maintenance only of a system of elementary and\nmiddle schools, as we define them today. See John Dinan, The Meaning of State\nConstitutional Education Clauses: Evidence from the Constitutional Convention\nDebates, 70 ALB. L. REV. 927, 953 (2007) (quoting 5 PENNSYLVANIA CONVENTION OF\n1837-1838 290-91).\n\n\n\n                                    [J-82-2016] - 11\n\f       the Education Clause of the Ohio Constitution of 1851 and over the next\n       several decades was added to the Constitutions of Minnesota, Maryland,\n       New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. . . .[12] The phrase can be\n       traced to a lecture Mann delivered in 1840: “[T]he efficient and thorough\n       education of the young was not merely commended to us, as a means of\n       promoting private and public welfare, but commanded as the only\n       safeguard against such a variety and extent of calamities as no nation on\n       earth has ever suffered.” Horace Mann, Lectures on Education, II LIFE &\n       WORKS OF HORACE MANN 191 (1891).\n\nPARSS at 93-94 (citations modified; footnotes omitted).\n\n       Pennsylvania did not revisit the Education Clause until the 1873 constitutional\n\nconvention,13 when the drafters eliminated the prior clause’s focus upon instruction for\n\nthe poor.    The new clause directed the General Assembly to “provide for the\n\nmaintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of public schools, wherein\n\nall the children of this Commonwealth above the age of six years may be educated,”\n\nand specified that the legislature “shall appropriate at least one million dollars each year\n\nfor that purpose.” PA. CONST.     OF   1874 art. X, § 1. While the 1776, 1790, and 1838\n\nConstitutions recognized education’s “vitally important part in our existence,” it was only\n\nupon the adoption of the 1874 Constitution that Pennsylvania “fortified” the public school\n\n\n12\n       See MD. CONST. art. VIII, § 1; MINN. CONST. art. XIII, § 1; N.J. CONST. art. VIII, § 4;\nW.V. CONST. art. XII, § 1. In point of fact, in addition to those states, the same language\nalso appeared in the Constitutions of Illinois and Wyoming. See ILL. CONST. art. X, § 1;\nWYO. CONST. art. VII, § 1.\n13\n       This Court previously has observed that the 1874 Constitution “was drafted in an\natmosphere of extreme distrust of the legislative body and of fear of the growing power\nof corporations,” and reflected a “prevailing mood . . . of reform.” In re Commonwealth,\nDep’t of Transp., 515 A.2d 899, 901 (Pa. 1986) (quoting R.

Commonwealth, 877 A.2d 383, 394 (Pa. 2005) (agreeing with\nthe above, and noting that the resultant mandates limiting legislative power “retain their\nvalue even today by placing certain constitutional limitations on the legislative process”).\n\n\n\n                                       [J-82-2016] - 12\n\fsystem, making schools “an integral part of our governmental system, as a state\n\ninstitution,” and rendering school districts “but agencies of the state Legislature to\n\nadminister [its newly-defined] constitutional duty.” Wilson v.

Ransley, 58 A. 122,\n\n123 (Pa. 1904) (“A review of constitutional provisions and legislative enactments clearly\n\nshows that the state has regarded the education of its children as one of its duties and\n\nfunctions . . . .”).\n\n        While the procedural posture of this case militates against delving deeply into the\n\nhistory of—or drawing broad conclusions regarding the collective intent underlying—the\n\nphrase “thorough and efficient,” some contemporaneous context nonetheless is\n\nilluminating.    Most notably, delegates to the convention appear to have linked the\n\nimportance of public education to the success of democracy, with William Darlington\n\naverring that “the perpetuity of free institutions rests, in a large degree, upon the\n\nintelligence of the people, and that intelligence is to be secured by education,” and\n\nfurther opining that “[t]he section on education is second in importance to no other\n\nsection to be submitted to this Convention.” PARSS at 98 (quoting II PENNSYLVANIA\n\nDEBATES    OF   1873 421).14 This Court, in turn, has noted that the General Assembly,\n\nwhile enacting piecemeal legislation in its service, did not entirely fulfill the 1790\n\nConstitution’s education mandate until the Act of May 8, 1854, P.L. 617, which for the\n\n\n14\n       The transition from a mandate to “establish” a system of education to one\nrequiring “maintenance and support” was described by one delegate to the 1873\nconvention as a way of recognizing “the existence of that admirable system of public\nschools which now prevails all over the Commonwealth,” i.e., as a reflection of principle\nand the status quo, rather than a mandate to effect specific change. Dinan, supra n.11,\nat 942 (2007) (quoting 2 PENNSYLVANIA CONVENTION OF 1872-73 419-20).\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 13\n\ffirst time “established a system of common school education for all the counties of the\n\n[C]ommonwealth.” Ransley, 58 A. at 123.\n\n       Reflecting a general preference for the protection of local school district\n\nprerogatives over state control that persists to this day in Pennsylvania and throughout\n\nthe country, the Convention rejected a proposal to add the word “uniform” in the\n\nEducation Clause ahead of the words “thorough” and “efficient.”               Opponents of\n\nuniformity expressed, inter alia, concerns that the word would deny schools the ability to\n\ntailor their instruction to the disparate needs of children in urban and rural districts, with\n\none    conventioneer    cautioning   against   the   imposition   of   statewide    curricular\n\nrequirements. Concerns also arose that local districts would be precluded from raising\n\nadditional funds to supplement and enrich the educations they might provide, a\n\ndisfavored intrusion upon local prerogatives. See Danson v. Casey, 399 A.2d 360, 366-\n\n67 (Pa. 1979) (noting that the framers of the 1874 Constitution considered and rejected\n\nadding a uniformity requirement to the Education Clause, thereby “endors[ing] the\n\nconcept of local control to meet diverse local needs”). The risk of a race to the bottom\n\nalso was considered, based upon the fear that, far from elevating school districts with\n\nlower standards, a uniformity requirement would cause higher-flying schools to weaken\n\ntheir efforts.\n\n       A spirited debate also arose regarding the proposed $1 million funding\n\nmandate.15 Supporters argued that such funds would prevent the “farcical” situation\n\nwhereunder some local taxing jurisdictions, in order to finance a school year of state-\n\n\n15\n      While it may seem strange now, this Court once described this as a “magnificent\nsum.” Ford v. Sch.-Dist. of Kendall Borough, 121 Pa. 543, 547 (Pa. 1888).\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 14\n\fspecified duration, would be forced to impose an onerous millage rate upon their\n\nresidents, while other districts would be able to impose a less burdensome funding\n\nstructure on their own constituents.      Instead, the appropriation “would equalize the\n\nburdens of supporting the system” of education prescribed by the Constitution. PARSS\n\nat 101 (quoting II PENNSYLVANIA DEBATES OF 1873 679).16 Conversely, opponents raised\n\nthe specter of state intrusion upon local districts’ prerogatives to tailor education to local\n\nresources and needs.\n\n       The 1874 numbering and text of the Education Clause were amended during the\n\n1967 constitutional convention to read, “The General Assembly shall provide for the\n\nmaintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of public education to\n\nserve the needs of the Commonwealth.”            PA. CONST. art. III, § 14.     Once again,\n\nuniformity was absent from the text. The $1 million appropriation requirement was\n\nomitted as anachronistic.     Thus, while the language upon which the instant case\n\nprimarily hinges first appeared in our Constitution in 1874, it did not take on its present\n\nform until the adoption of the 1968 Constitution.\n\n       B.     The Parties and the Action\n\n       Appellant-Petitioners include public school districts spanning the Commonwealth,\n\nfrom Philadelphia and Delaware Counties in southeastern Pennsylvania to Cambria\n\nCounty in the west. Petitioners also include students and parents and guardians of\n\nstudents who attend the named school districts and others. They further include the\n\n\n16\n         Interestingly, according to Petitioners’ allegations as related infra, that concern\nremains emergent, as low-wealth districts continue to assess taxes upon property in\ntheir domains at a much higher rate than those of wealthier districts, while the former\nstill collect significantly less school tax revenue per student than the latter.\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 15\n\fPennsylvania Association of Rural and Small Schools (“PARSS”), a statewide\n\nmembership organization that comprises approximately 150 school districts and\n\nprovides advocacy and training to address problems that affect rural school districts,\n\nand the NAACP—Pennsylvania State Conference, a Commonwealth affiliate of the\n\nNational Association for the Advancement of Colored People.\n\n      As set forth at length below, Petitioners filed a Petition for Review in the\n\nCommonwealth Court’s original jurisdiction, naming as Respondents the President Pro\n\nTempore of the Pennsylvania Senate, Joseph B. Scarnati, III, and the then-Speaker of\n\nthe Pennsylvania House of Representatives, Samuel H. Smith (collectively, “Legislative\n\nRespondents”); and the Pennsylvania Department of Education, Secretary of Education\n\nPedro Rivera, and Governor Tom Wolf (collectively, “Executive Respondents”).\n\nPetitioners sought declaratory and injunctive relief aimed at rectifying what they alleged\n\nare constitutional deficiencies in Pennsylvania’s system of public education arising from\n\nthe General Assembly’s failure to support and maintain the thorough and efficient\n\nsystem of education mandated by the Pennsylvania Constitution.\n\n      C.     Petitioners’ Allegations\n\n      Petitioners’ averments, which for purposes of review we must take as true and\n\nread in the light most favorable to their causes of action,17 fall into two sometimes\n\noverlapping categories. Generally, Petitioners aver that Pennsylvania’s school funding\n\nsystem is flawed on its face in its failure to ensure, in tandem with local funding, that\n\neach school district has the resources necessary to provide an adequate education.\n\nThis includes broad averments as well as more particularized allegations, couched in\n\n17\n      Kuren v. Luzerne Cnty., 146 A.3d 715, 718 n.1 (Pa. 2016).\n\n\n\n                                    [J-82-2016] - 16\n\fquantitative comparisons of various districts’ resources and respective capacities to\n\nprovide an education of a quality that satisfies the Education Clause’s mandate.\n\nSpecifically, Petitioners plead numerous allegations concerning the circumstances\n\nfaced by their own districts, as well as the alleged injuries that a constitutionally\n\ninadequate school system has caused the individual petitioners, children attending such\n\nschools and their parents or guardians. As an organizing principle, we review these\n\nallegations in turn.\n\n       In 1999, the General Assembly imposed an elaborate set of standards to govern\n\nthe content of educational materials, which led to the adoption of assessment and\n\naccountability measures tied to those standards. Thus, through authority conferred by\n\nthe School Code, the Department of Education adopted a series of regulations “to\n\nestablish rigorous academic standards and assessments, applicable only to the public\n\nschools in this Commonwealth, to facilitate the improvement of student achievement\n\nand to provide parents and communities a measure by which school performance can\n\nbe determined.” 22 Pa. Code § 4.2.18\n\n\n18\n      One commentator, addressing the evolution of the “standards-based model” of\neducation, provides a useful shorthand for the components of such an educational\nparadigm, noting that the model entails “three key components: (1) academic content\nstandards for various subjects identifying what a student should know and be able to do\nat each grade level; (2) standardized tests designed to gauge student mastery of these\nstandards; and (3) a system of accountability for schools, including rewards and\nconsequences based on individual school and district performance.” Jill Ambrose,\nNote, A Fourth Wave of Education Funding Litigation: How Education Standards &\nCosting-Out Studies Can Aid Plaintiffs in Pennsylvania & Beyond, 19 B.U. PUB. INT. L.J.\n107, 117 (2009).\n       Executive Respondents reject the thrust of Petitioners’ contention that 1999\nmarked the initial imposition of academic standards upon school districts. Executive\nRespondents note that, over fifty years ago, in 1963, in service of the goal of facilitating\nthe “expeditious reorganization” of the Commonwealth’s public school system,\n(continued…)\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 17\n\f      In its statement of “general policies,” the new regulatory framework reinforced the\n\nprinciple that districts should be free to fashion local curricula to achieve prescribed\n\nacademic standards, retaining “the greatest possible flexibility in curriculum planning,”\n\nwhile meeting prescribed course and curriculum requirements, ensuring the provision of\n\nspecified numbers of days and hours of instruction at different school levels, and\n\nmaintaining a sufficient professional staff. The Department further committed to support\n\nlocal efforts, by, e.g., establishing model curricula and diagnostic tools tailored to\n\nsatisfying the state assessment system. 22 Pa. Code. § 4.4. The state assessments\n\n(…continued)\n24 Pa.C.S. § 2-290, the General Assembly directed the Department of Education to\n“develop or cause to be developed an evaluation procedure designed to measure\nobjectively the adequacy and efficiency of the educational programs offered by the\npublic schools” by, e.g., deploying tests to measure “the achievements and performance\nof students.” 24 P.S. § 2-290.1; see Brief for Executive Respondents at 23. They note\nthat systematic school and student assessments were administered as early as the\n1969-70 school year under the Educational Quality Assurance (“EQA”) program, which\nwas joined, in 1984, by the Testing for Educational Learning and Literacy Skills\n(“TELLS”). EQA was discontinued in 1988, and, in 1992, TELLS was replaced by the\nfirst incarnation of the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment (“PSSA”). This\ndoes not strike us as contradictory of Petitioners’ claim that the pervasiveness, rigor,\nand thoroughness of the tests employed by the Commonwealth in determining the\nprogress of individual students and the success of individual teachers, programs, and\nschools and their districts increased significantly in 1999, when, by Executive\nRespondents’ own admission, the PSSA was substantially overhauled. Id. at 26-27.\nPassage of the No Child Left Behind Act in 2001 tied federal funding to various federal\nmandates and standards. See 20 U.S.C. § 6311; Aaron Y. Tang, Broken Systems,\nBroken Duties: A New Theory for School Finance Litigation, 94 MARQ. L. REV. 1195,\n1213-14 (2011). In light of the complications associated with this subject, our standard\nof review prevails and we assume the truth of Petitioners’ averments in this regard. But\nto the extent that it is material to what follows, we accept as undisputed Executive\nRespondents’ observation that standards and measurement have been in play in\nPennsylvania public education in one form or another since the 1960s, and that these\ncontinue to evolve. That being said, Respondents do not suggest that there is a strong\nresemblance between the pre-1999 and post-1999 landscape in terms of the frequency,\ndepth, and consequence associated with the exams administered to students who\nattend Pennsylvania’s public schools. Absent that, we are bound to accept the thrust of\nPetitioners’ assertions as true to at least that extent.\n\n\n\n                                    [J-82-2016] - 18\n\fare conducted primarily through the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment\n\n(“PSSA”) and Keystone Exams. See generally 22 Pa. Code. §§ 4.51, et seq.\n\n      In 2008, the General Assembly passed Act 61.19 In that measure, the legislature\n\nresponded to an extensive “costing out” study it had commissioned, which had\n\nestablished benchmarks for effective funding levels on a district-by-district basis and\n\npointed to widespread funding deficiencies and inequities in Pennsylvania’s public\n\nschool system.20   The General Assembly implemented a “Basic Education Funding\n\nPlan” for calculating the distribution of state resources among Pennsylvania’s school\n\ndistricts. The costing-out study found that 94% of Pennsylvania school districts were\n\nspending less than should be spent to meet the Commonwealth’s own academic\n\nstandards. The poorest quintile of school districts needed to spend 38% more than they\n\nwere spending, while the wealthiest quintile needed to increase spending by 7%. The\n\naggregate statewide shortfall relative to what was required to meet those standards was\n\nover $20 billion. Under Act 61, funding levels for the 2008-09 school year increased by\n\n$274.7 million, a 5% increase over the preceding year. In the two years that followed,\n\nutilizing the same formula, the Commonwealth increased state funding by approximately\n\n$300 million and $355 million, respectively. Thus, as against the study’s recommended\n\n\n\n19\n      Act of July 9, 2008, P.L. 846, No. 61, amending Act of Mar. 10, 1949, P.L. 30,\nNo. 14, codified at 24 P.S. §§ 1-101, et seq.\n20\n       While we consider this “costing-out” study, infra, to the extent necessary to\naddress the parties’ arguments, it is beyond the scope of this Opinion to delve deeply\ninto the nature of such studies. For a succinct description of the methodologies\nemployed in such studies and how they have been utilized in forming education policy in\nother states, as well as a brief description of the specific study conducted at the behest\nof the Pennsylvania General Assembly, see Ambrose, supra n.18, at 119-22.\n\n\n\n                                    [J-82-2016] - 19\n\f$20 billion increase, Act 61 provided for an increase of roughly $1 billion over three\n\nschool years.\n\n      The increased funding drew heavily upon federal stimulus funds furnished to the\n\nstate pursuant to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”). 21\n\nARRA expired in 2011, by which time the Commonwealth had relied upon hundreds of\n\nmillions of federal dollars to reduce the Commonwealth’s direct contribution to the\n\nfunding pool by which Act 61’s mandate was fulfilled. In the wake of ARRA’s expiration,\n\nthe Commonwealth faced a shortfall of over $800 million relative to prior funding levels,\n\nwhich was reflected in the 2011 budget. Pursuant thereto, the basic education subsidy\n\nwas reduced by $420 million; Accountability Block Grants, which fund initiatives such as\n\nfull-day kindergarten, tutoring assistance, and class size reduction, by $160 million;\n\ncharter school reimbursements, which partially compensate school districts for the cost\n\nof transferring district funds to charter schools, by $224 million; and the Educational\n\nAssistance Program, which funds tutoring services, by $47 million, with additional\n\nreductions affecting other initiatives, including those aimed at improving educational\n\nachievement in low-performing schools.      The 2011 budget also destabilized school\n\nfunding generally, by abandoning Act 61’s long-term funding formula in favor of mutable\n\nannual funding calculations. Compounding the funding shortfalls was the Taxpayer\n\nRelief Act of 2006,22 which restricted the ability of local jurisdictions to offset state\n\nbudget cuts by increasing local taxes.

Nonetheless, as a convenience, we utilize the present tense in rendering\nPetitioners’ allegations, with the caveat that certain specific allegations presumably will\nrequire updating as this litigation proceeds in the wake of our decision. Notably, while\ncommon sense strongly suggests that particular allegations, especially quantifiable\naverments, will not be accurate at any given moment relative to present circumstances,\nwe nonetheless are bound by this case’s procedural posture to accept Petitioners’\nallegations at face value.\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 21\n\fbooks; persistent and ongoing reductions in teachers and staff, with concomitant\n\nincreases in student-teacher ratios and class size; the elimination of educational\n\nprograms such as art, music, and foreign languages; and deficiencies in learning\n\nmaterials and physical school facilities.\n\n       Petitioners offered an overview of the funding scheme that applied when they\n\nfiled their Petition.25 Their account is quite detailed, but for present purposes it suffices\n\nto highlight the broader points.    Petitioners aver that 87% of Pennsylvania’s public\n\neducation budget is funded through state appropriations and local property taxes, while\n\n13% is contributed by the federal government.             In 2011, local taxes provided\n\napproximately 53%, with state appropriations comprising approximately 34% of\n\nstatewide public school expenditures. State funds are distributed according to an aid\n\nratio, which divides state funding according to various formulas that are designed to\n\naccount for the aggregate property values and personal incomes in a given school\n\ndistrict in discerning, speaking broadly, the wealth per student in a given district. A\n\ndistrict’s “wealth” is then measured against the state average, and the less favorably it\n\ncompares, the greater proportional share of state education funds it receives.\n\n\n\n25\n       When Petitioners filed their challenge, the state funding formula that applied to\nthe allocation of state funding among school districts was provided by 24 P.S. §§ 25-\n2502.50 (“Basic education funding for 2010-11 school year”), 25-2502.51 (2011-12\nschool year), and 25-2502.52 (2012-13 school year). See Act of June 30, 2011,\nP.L. 112, No. 24, § 26.        However, after the Commonwealth Court sustained\nRespondents’ preliminary objections in this matter, and indeed after briefing was\ncompleted before this Court, the General Assembly enacted Act 35, which created a\nnew state funding formula that applied to the 2016-17 school year and applies each\nyear thereafter. See Act of June 1, 2016, P.L. 252, No. 35, § 1, codified at 24 P.S. § 25-\n2502.53. The effect of this change is addressed infra, at the outset of our discussion of\nthe legal issues presented.\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 22\n\f       Districts with lower wealth per student values are unable to raise the same per\n\ncapita funding through local property taxes as districts with higher values.             The\n\ndependence of local tax revenues on the application of millage rates, which can vary\n\nover only a limited range, upon the aggregate value of the property in the district confers\n\nan insuperable advantage to districts that have a ratio of assessed property wealth per\n\nstudent that is significantly higher than districts with less aggregate property value.\n\nThus, even low-wealth districts that impose substantially higher tax rates on their\n\nproperty cannot generate close to as much tax revenue per student as districts with\n\nsubstantially higher property values, even when the latter districts impose tax rates that\n\nare a fraction of those imposed by low-wealth districts. Thus, while Shenandoah Valley\n\nSchool District applied a property tax rate of 26.8 equalized mills, its local tax collections\n\nwere only $4,011.48 per student. Conversely, Lower Merion School District, at 14.7\n\nequalized mills, collected over $23,000 per student.          Tredyffrin / Easttown School\n\nDistrict, which applied a millage rate substantially less than half that applied by\n\nShenandoah Valley, collected $19,418.38 per student, well over four times Shenandoah\n\nValley’s per-student revenue.       Petitioners document numerous similar disparities\n\nbetween wealthy and low-wealth districts across the Commonwealth.\n\n       Turning to Petitioners’ more specific allegations, the School District of Lancaster\n\nhas eliminated 100 teaching positions and more than twenty administrative positions,\n\nsubstantially increasing the student-teacher ratio throughout the district.           Where\n\nLancaster once employed twenty librarians, it now employs five. In 2011 and 2012,\n\nLancaster imposed a hiring and salary freeze for teachers and other staff. Panther\n\nValley School District has struggled similarly since 2011. The number of elementary\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 23\n\fschool and high school teachers has been reduced by 10%.                All district librarian\n\npositions were eliminated, as were all elementary school technology coach positions.\n\nReductions also have adversely affected Panther Valley’s ability to support its growing\n\npopulation of English language-learning students. Greater Johnstown School District,\n\nwhere an unusually high proportion of students have incarcerated, substance-abusing,\n\nand/or mentally ill family members, also has labored under the burden of reduced\n\nfunding. It has eliminated twenty-five teacher positions, and has an insufficient number\n\nof administrators, counselors, and librarians, with two librarians serving four schools,\n\nresulting in cutbacks to its reading intervention program. The William Penn School\n\nDistrict has eliminated fifty-seven teachers, five administrators, and twelve support staff.\n\nNone of its schools employs a full-time guidance counselor, it has eliminated one\n\nlibrarian position, and in 2011 it eliminated all of its reading specialist positions. Due to\n\nsevere staff reductions, William Penn’s former seven-period schedule has been reduced\n\nto six periods.26\n\n\n\n\n26\n        The story is much the same in the Wilkes-Barre Area and Shenandoah Valley\nSchool Districts. And since 2011, amicus curiae Philadelphia School District has\nreduced the number of principals and assistant principals by 40%; teachers by 33%;\nspecial education teachers by 22%; career and technical education teachers by 37%;\nand counselors, student advisors, and social service liaisons by 54%. Philadelphia\noperates 214 schools serving approximately 131,000 students, but employs only sixty-\nsix music teachers and three full-time-equivalent librarians. The superintendent of the\nPhiladelphia School District, as well as Respondent Department of Education have\ncharacterized the state of public education in Philadelphia as “insufficient and\nunsustainable.” Petition at 82-83 ¶ 200; see id. at 83 ¶ 201 (quoting at length a joint\nfiling of the Philadelphia School District, the School Reform Commission, and the\nDepartment of Education in other litigation describing the “bare-bones” and\n“unsatisfactory” conditions and “woefully inadequate” staffing levels in the Philadelphia\nSchool District).\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 24\n\f       Petitioners further detail reductions in Petitioner School Districts of various\n\neducational programs, including art, physical education, and health education, which,\n\nPetitioners argue, are important to preparing students for “civic, economic, and social\n\nsuccess.” Id. at 85-86 ¶ 204. Schools also have reduced or eliminated vocational\n\nprograms, interventions for struggling and at-risk students, English language-learning\n\nassistance, and programming for gifted students, including advanced placement\n\ncourses. Lancaster has cut summer tutoring programs to non-high school students and\n\nnearly all foreign language education. Only half of students have access to shop and\n\ncomputer classes.      Panther Valley has made similarly dramatic cuts, and also\n\neliminated driver’s education and SAT preparation. Greater Johnstown has been forced\n\nto reduce severely its intervention, remediation, and special education services. Similar\n\nreductions have been required in the Wilkes-Barre Area and William Penn School\n\nDistricts.   These cuts, they allege, have been forced primarily upon economically\n\ndisadvantaged districts, while more prosperous districts have remained largely\n\nunscathed.\n\n       Petitioners also identify severe shortages in classroom materials and equipment,\n\nas well as deteriorating schools.     In the School District of Lancaster, for example,\n\nPetitioners allege that much of the furniture is in need of repair or replacement,\n\nprojectors are non-functioning, and textbooks and computers are severely out of date.\n\nThe roof over Panther Valley’s overcrowded elementary school is in need of repair, and\n\nas a temporary measure to address a shortage of usable space, the district has placed\n\nchildren in twelve modular classrooms. In Greater Johnstown, the roof over the middle\n\nschool’s auditorium is collapsing, plaster is falling from crumbling walls and ceilings, and\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 25\n\fsome bathrooms are in such disrepair that they cannot be used.               Much of the\n\ntechnology in the Wilkes-Barre Area School District is ten or more years old, and that\n\ndistrict’s physical facilities, too, are in poor condition.   In the William Penn School\n\nDistrict, textbooks are so out of date that they do not match Pennsylvania state\n\ncurricular requirements, and high school students may not bring some texts home—\n\nshould they be lost, the school will not be able to replace them. In twenty-three of thirty-\n\ntwo school buildings in Philadelphia surveyed by Philadelphia in partnership with the\n\nHealth and Welfare Fund and the federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health,\n\ninvestigators found dampness, mold, or water damage in more than a third of the\n\nrooms.\n\n       By way of contrast, in the Lower Merion School District, all kindergartners and\n\nfirst-graders have access to iPads, and all high school freshmen are issued laptops to\n\nuse as their own during their high school years.\n\n       Perhaps most importantly, Petitioners allege that certain programs and services\n\nthat disadvantaged districts have been forced to reduce or eliminate are essential to\n\nequip students to meet the proficiency standards imposed by the General Assembly.\n\nTeacher layoffs and concomitant class size increases; reductions in advanced studies\n\nand programs such as art and music, as well as after-school and summer school\n\nprograms for supplemental instruction; the elimination or reduction of teacher education\n\nand development relative to the areas tested; reductions in preschool and early\n\nchildhood programs; out-of-date instructional materials; and the various other\n\ndeficiencies enumerated above all work to prevent disadvantaged school districts from\n\nmeeting the educational standards imposed by the state.\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 26\n\f      Based on the foregoing allegations, Petitioners’ Petition sets forth two counts. In\n\nCount I, Petitioners assert that Respondents have violated their collective constitutional\n\nduty under the Education Clause to “provide for the maintenance and support of a\n\nthorough and efficient system of public education to serve the needs of the\n\nCommonwealth.” PA. CONST. art. III, § 14. In this regard, they allege that Respondents\n\nhave defined the content of an adequate education—i.e., one that will “serve the needs\n\nof the Commonwealth”—by promulgating academic standards assessed by the PSSA\n\nand Keystone exams.27 Petitioners aver that Respondents failed to provide the school\n\ndistricts in question with enough funding to ensure that all students have an opportunity\n\nto receive an adequate education—where funding is measured by the allocations\n\nsuggested by the General Assembly-commissioned costing-out study, and adequacy is\n\ntested by whether the students are prepared to “meet state academic standards” and to\n\nachieve “civic, economic, and social success” beyond school.           Id. at 118 ¶ 304.\n\nPetitioners maintain that the current levels and allocation of school funding “are\n\nirrational, arbitrary, and not reasonably calculated to ensure that all Pennsylvania\n\nschoolchildren have access to an adequate education.”                 Id. at 118 ¶ 305.\n\nConsequently, Petitioners claim, the General Assembly has failed to maintain and\n\nsupport “a thorough and efficient system of public education.”\n\n      In effect, Petitioners posit that Pennsylvania law imposes a threshold obligation\n\nto provide all Pennsylvania students with an “adequate” education, which they define in\n\npart by reference to the very standards imposed by the General Assembly and the\n\nDepartment of Education, and in part by reference to the broader goal of enabling\n\n27\n      See generally 22 Pa.Code §§ 4.1, et seq.\n\n\n\n                                    [J-82-2016] - 27\n\fstudents to “participate meaningfully in the economic, civic, and social activities of our\n\nsociety.” That is to say, while Petitioners rely significantly upon the proposition that the\n\nvery instantiation of elaborate goals and assessment tools by the General Assembly\n\nreflects a legislative effort to define an adequate education against which constitutional\n\nadequacy can be measured, they appeal distinctly to broader notions of what\n\nconstitutes a constitutionally adequate education of a sort that is thorough and efficient.\n\n       In their second count, Petitioners assert that Respondents have violated equal\n\nprotection principles under Article III, Section 32 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. They\n\naver that education is a fundamental right, triggering strict scrutiny of the\n\ndisadvantageous classification reflected in the disparity of educational resources at the\n\ndisposal of low and high-wealth districts. Petitioners do not dispute that a constitutional\n\nschool funding scheme would still enable wealthier districts to provide greater resources\n\nto their students than districts that cannot raise as much money through local taxes.\n\nBut they maintain that the Constitution “imposes a duty on the Commonwealth to ensure\n\nthat all students have the same basic level of educational opportunity,” that is, “the\n\nsame fundamental opportunity to meet academic standards and to obtain an adequate\n\neducation that prepares the student for civil, economic, and social success.” Id. at 119\n\n¶ 308. Petitioners contend that the state charter “prohibits the General Assembly from\n\nirrationally enacting laws that benefit a select few.” Id. at 119 ¶ 309. Petitioners assert\n\nthat many funding methodologies exist that would support the state’s interest in\n\npreserving local control of public education without compromising the ability of students\n\nin low-wealth school districts to obtain an adequate education. By adopting a school\n\nfunding program that discriminates against students living in such districts by denying\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 28\n\fthem an equal opportunity to obtain an adequate education, the General Assembly,\n\naccording to Petitioners, has denied the disadvantaged students equal protection. Id.\n\nat 119-20 ¶¶ 308-311.\n\n      In connection with both counts, Petitioners seek declaratory relief consistent with\n\ntheir allegations regarding Respondents’ respective obligations, and in particular\n\nconcerning the scope of the General Assembly’s mandate under the Education Clause,\n\nas well as permanent injunctive relief directing Respondents to rectify the situation\n\naccordingly.    Petitioners request that the Commonwealth Court retain jurisdiction in\n\norder to ensure Respondents’ compliance.\n\n      Legislative and Executive Respondents each filed preliminary objections in the\n\nnature of a demurrer. See Pa.R.C.P. 1028(a)(4). Respondents averred primarily that\n\nPetitioners’ claims present non-justiciable political questions.   They maintained that\n\nresponsibility for providing a thorough and efficient system of public education is\n\ntextually conferred exclusively upon the legislature and that there are no judicially\n\nmanageable standards for granting relief.     They reasoned that these factors require\n\ncourts to abstain pursuant to the political question doctrine under Baker, as adopted by\n\nthis Court.28    Respondents also argued that Petitioners failed to state an equal\n\n\n28\n       The Baker Court set forth the following factors to guide the political question\nanalysis:\n       Prominent on the surface of any case held to involve a political question is\n       found a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a\n       coordinate political department; or a lack of judicially discoverable and\n       manageable standards for resolving it; or the impossibility of deciding\n       without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for non[-]judicial\n       discretion; or the impossibility of a court’s undertaking independent\n       resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches\n       of government; or an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a\n(continued…)\n\n                                    [J-82-2016] - 29\n\fprotection claim upon which relief may be granted because they do not have a\n\nfundamental right to education entitling them to strict scrutiny of the school funding\n\nscheme, and the existing statutory scheme rationally serves the state’s interest in\n\nmaintaining and supporting a thorough and efficient system of public education. Finally,\n\nRespondents averred that Petitioners’ causes of action were barred by sovereign\n\nimmunity—to the extent they sought mandatory injunctive relief—as well as the\n\nseparation of powers doctrine insofar as Petitioners asked the judicial branch to compel\n\naction by the General Assembly and to subject it to ongoing judicial supervision.29\n\n      D.     The Commonwealth Court’s Decision\n\n      In a unanimous, published decision, the Commonwealth Court sustained\n\nRespondents’ preliminary objections and dismissed Petitioners’ Petition on the grounds\n\nthat, pursuant to this Court’s precedent, both the Education Clause claims and the equal\n\nprotection claim entail non-justiciable political questions. See William Penn Sch. Dist. v.\n\nPa. Dep’t of Educ., 114 A.3d 456, 464 & n.15 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2015) (en banc).\n\n\n(…continued)\n     political decision already made; or the potentiality of embarrassment from\n     multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.\nBaker, 369 U.S. at 217; see Robinson Twp. v. Commonwealth, 83 A.3d 901, 928\n(Pa. 2013); Council 13, AFSCME ex rel. Fillman v. Rendell, 986 A.2d 63, 75 (Pa. 2009);\nSweeney v. Tucker, 375 A.2d 698, 706 (Pa. 1977). The presence of any one Baker\nfactor warrants abstention under the political question doctrine. Baker, 369 U.S. at 217;\nBlackwell v. City of Phila., 684 A.2d 1068, 1071 (Pa. 1996); Zemprelli v. Daniels, 436\nA.2d 1165, 1169 (Pa. 1981).\n29\n       The Commonwealth Court did not rule upon these preliminary objections, which\nare independent of the justiciability argument upon which the Commonwealth Court\nrelied in sustaining Respondents’ preliminary objections. Accordingly, we do not\naddress them herein. These arguments remain salient upon remand, and our decision\nis not intended to prejudice Respondents’ right to pursue them further in the court\nbelow.\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 30\n\f       Initially, the Commonwealth Court observed that this Court has relied upon the\n\nBaker considerations to ascertain whether the political question doctrine counsels in\n\nfavor of abstention in a given case.        See id. at 462 (citing Robinson Twp. v.\n\nCommonwealth, 83 A.3d 901, 928 (Pa. 2013), and Sweeney v. Tucker, 375 A.2d 698\n\n(Pa. 1977)). Rather than analyze the Baker factors anew, however, the Commonwealth\n\nCourt found that the question of justiciability was controlled by this Court’s decision in\n\nMarrero v. Commonwealth, 739 A.2d 110 (Pa. 1999) (“Marrero II”), which relied\n\nprimarily upon Danson v. Casey, 399 A.2d 360 (Pa. 1979).               As read by the\n\nCommonwealth Court, in Marrero II, this Court held that the Education Clause did not\n\nconfer upon students an individual right to an education of any particular quality.\n\nRather, it imposed an exclusive mandate upon the General Assembly to provide for the\n\naforesaid maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of public\n\neducation.    The Court further maintained that the Education Clause precluded the\n\nGeneral Assembly from establishing any educational policy that future legislatures\n\ncannot change. “[T]he very essence” of the Education Clause, it held, “is to enable\n\nsuccessive legislatures to adopt a changing program to keep abreast of educational\n\nadvances.” William Penn Sch. Dist., 114 A.3d at 462 (quoting Marrero II, 739 A.2d\n\nat 112).     Consequently, it would be equally violative of the Education Clause’s\n\n“essence” for the Court to establish any fixed standard by which to measure\n\nthoroughness and efficiency.     The Marrero II Court thus concluded that “the only\n\njudicially manageable standard this [C]ourt could adopt would be the rigid rule that each\n\npupil must receive the same dollar expenditures,” and, because expenditures per pupil\n\n“are not the exclusive yardstick of educational quality, or even constitutional quantity,”\n\n\n\n\n                                    [J-82-2016] - 31\n\fsuch a standard would offend the historical means and intended ends of the Education\n\nClause. William Penn Sch. Dist., 114 A.3d at 463 (quoting Marrero II, 739 A.2d at 113).\n\nThus, any legislative scheme with “a reasonable relation” to providing “for the\n\nmaintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of public schools” passes\n\nconstitutional muster. Id. (quoting Marrero II, 739 A.2d at 113).\n\n       The Commonwealth Court rejected Petitioners’ attempt to distinguish Danson\n\nand Marrero II on the basis that subsequently-adopted education standards and\n\nassessments, viewed in tandem with the findings of the legislatively-commissioned\n\ncosting-out study, have revealed a judicially discoverable and manageable standard by\n\nwhich to measure constitutional adequacy. Such considerations, the Commonwealth\n\nCourt held, might establish salutary policy-related benchmarks, but they cannot supply a\n\njudicially manageable standard enabling a court to determine whether the Legislature\n\nhas fulfilled its constitutional duties without overstepping its bounds. See id. Thus, as\n\nin Marrero II, that want of judicially manageable standards rendered Petitioners’ claims\n\nnon-justiciable.30\n\n       This appeal followed.     This Court has exclusive jurisdiction over Petitioners’\n\nappeal. See 42 Pa.C.S. § 723(a) (“The Supreme Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction\n\nof appeals from final orders of the Commonwealth Court entered in any matter which\n\nwas originally commenced in the Commonwealth Court.”).\n\nII. Issues Presented and Standards of Review\n\n       Petitioners frame their issues for review as follows:\n\n30\n       The Commonwealth Court did not treat Petitioners’ Education Clause and equal\nprotection claims discretely, an approach which, as set forth infra, more or less follows\nfrom the court’s reliance upon Danson and Marrero II.\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 32\n\f       A.      Education Clause Claims\n\n       Where a petition alleges that the legislature’s school[-]funding scheme\n       bears no relationship to the actual cost of preparing students to meet state\n       academic standards, does the political[ ]question doctrine bar the judiciary\n       from considering whether the legislature has complied with its\n       constitutional duty to support a thorough and efficient system of public\n       education?\n\n       B.      Equal Protection\n\n       Where a petition alleges gross and irrational disparities in school funding\n       between low-wealth and high-wealth school districts, does the political\n       question doctrine preclude students in low-wealth school districts from\n       asserting an equal protection claim to protect their individual constitutional\n       rights?\n\nBrief for Petitioners at 2.31\n\n       We exercise de novo review of a lower tribunal’s order sustaining preliminary\n\nobjections in the nature of a demurrer.       Bruno v. Erie Ins. Co., 106 A.3d 48, 56\n\n(Pa. 2014). The scope of our review is plenary. Kuren v. Luzerne Cnty., 146 A.3d 715,\n\n753 (Pa. 2016). We must determine “whether, on the facts averred, the law says with\n\ncertainty that no recovery is possible.”    Bruno, 106 A.3d at 56.      In conducting our\n\nreview, “we accept as true all well-pleaded material facts set forth in the [petition for\n\nreview] and all inferences fairly deducible from those facts.” Kuren, 146 A.3d at 718\n\nn.1. We will sustain preliminary objections “only when, based on the facts pleaded, it is\n\nclear and free from doubt that the complainant will be unable to prove facts legally\n\n\n31\n       The City of Philadelphia, as well as several individuals and organizations, have\nfiled amicus briefs supporting Petitioners’ position, including the Philadelphia Federation\nof Teachers, Local 3, of the American Federation of Teachers, together with the\nAmerican Federation of Teachers Pennsylvania, AFT; two groups of youth, education,\nand civil rights advocacy associations led, respectively, by Public Citizens for Children\nand Youth and the Consortium for Public Education; and a group of individual\nprofessors of constitutional law.\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 33\n\fsufficient to establish a right to relief.” Id. (quoting Mazur v. Trinity Area Sch. Dist., 961\n\nA.2d 96, 101 (Pa. 2008)).\n\nIII. Discussion\n\n       A.     Mootness and Appealability\n\n       As noted, supra n.25, with the enactment of 72 P.S. § 25-2502.53 and related\n\nprovisions (hereinafter, “Act 35”) during the pendency of this appeal, the General\n\nAssembly supplanted the funding formula that applied when Petitioners filed suit. This\n\nnew enactment is the subject of a Supplemental Brief submitted by Governor Tom\n\nWolf,32 to which Petitioners responded in turn. Governor Wolf submits that Act 35 for\n\nthe first time bases allocations on the “objective needs of each district.” Supplemental\n\nBrief of Governor Tom Wolf at 3. Governor Wolf contends that these salutary changes\n\nmilitate in favor of affirmance, but does not argue that the changes moot Petitioners’\n\nclaims.33 The question presented concerns the justiciability of Petitioners’ claims. The\n\nnature of the applicable state formula (which can change any time the legislature\n\nchooses) goes to the correct ruling only if the claims are justiciable in the first instance.\n32\n     We granted Governor Wolf leave to file his brief by per curiam Order of\nSeptember 22, 2016, shortly after we heard oral argument in this matter.\n33\n       We have described the mootness doctrine as follows:\n       [C]ases presenting mootness problems involve litigants who clearly had\n       standing to sue at the outset of the litigation. The problems arise from\n       events occurring after the lawsuit has gotten under way—changes in the\n       facts or in the law—which allegedly deprive the litigant of the necessary\n       stake in the outcome. The mootness doctrine requires that an actual case\n       or controversy must be extant at all stages of review, not merely at the\n       time the complaint is filed.\nPub. Def.’s Office of Venango Cnty. v. Venango Cnty. Court of Common Pleas, 893\nA.2d 1275, 1279 (Pa. 2006) (quoting Pap’s A.M. v. City of Erie, 812 A.2d 591, 599-600\n(Pa. 2002)).\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 34\n\fChanges in the formula do not render the questions presented moot, nor do they\n\nmaterially affect the substance of our ruling in the case’s present posture.34\n\n       B.     Justiciability and the Political Question Doctrine\n\n       The cornerstone of our republican democracy is the principle of government\n\ndivided into three separate, co-equal branches that both empower and constrain one\n\nanother. See Robinson Twp., 83 A.3d at 927 n.16. Judicial review stands as a bulwark\n\nagainst unconstitutional or otherwise illegal actions by the two political branches. “It is\n\nemphatically the province and duty of the judicial department,” instructed Chief Justice\n\nJohn Marshall, “to say what the law is.” Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 177 (1803).\n\nThe foundation for the rule of law as we have come to know it is the axiom that, when\n\ndisagreements arise, the Court has the final word regarding the Constitution’s meaning.\n\n       Even as the separation of powers upon which our system depends relies\n\nsubstantially upon judicial review, the courts long have recognized that the very same\n\nimperatives sometimes require judicial abstention.         In Marbury itself, the Court\n\ncontemplated the prospect that certain legal acts and omissions may be neither\n\n\n34\n       Even if we were to find that the particular claims presented technically were\nmooted by the passage of Act 35, Petitioners would have a compelling argument for this\nCourt to proceed to decision on the basis that the issues as stated are of importance to\nthe public interest and “capable of repetition yet evading review.” See Commonwealth,\nDep’t of Env’l Protection v. Cromwell Twp., Huntingdon Cnty., 32 A.3d 639, 652\n(Pa. 2011). At the inception of any action such as the one presented—the public\nimportance of which cannot be disputed—there inheres the risk that the General\nAssembly will move the goalposts by enacting new legislation, a risk that was especially\ntrue under the legislation that applied when Petitioners filed their appeal, when the\nGeneral Assembly had transitioned to an annual funding process from one applying a\nformulaic approach indefinitely or over a designated series of years. In any event, this\nCourt is not asked at this juncture to decide the constitutionality of a particular funding\nformula, but rather whether a claim regarding the constitutionality of any funding formula\nmay be litigated or instead lies entirely outside judicial review.\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 35\n\fassessed nor corrected by judicial intervention. Id. at 164 (“That there may be such\n\ncases is not to be questioned . . . .”). As Chief Justice Marshall allowed, and as the\n\ncenturies have proven, judicial review has its limitations, including those suggested by\n\nwhat has come to be known as the political question doctrine.\n\n       The parameters of the political question doctrine have never been amenable to\n\nprecise definition. In 1955, Justice Felix Frankfurter acknowledged the difficulty that\n\nattends any effort to delineate the scope and application of the doctrine:\n\n       I . . . believe that no judge charged with the duty of enforcing the Due\n       Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, and the Equal\n       Protection of the Laws Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, can free\n       himself from the disquietude that the line is often very thin between the\n       cases in which the Court felt compelled to abstain from adjudication\n       because of their “political” nature, and the cases that so frequently arise in\n       applying the concepts of “liberty” and “equality.”\nFelix Frankfurter, John Marshall and the Judicial Function, 69 HARV. L. REV. 217, 227\n\n(1955).\n\n       Not long after Justice Frankfurter expressed his misgivings, the United States\n\nSupreme Court, confronted with a challenge to state-level efforts to fashion\n\ncongressional districts, distilled the following six-factor test from its prior political\n\nquestion decisions:\n\n       [S]everal formulations which vary slightly according to the settings in\n       which the questions arise may describe a political question, although each\n       has one or more elements which identify it as essentially a function of the\n       separation of powers. Prominent on the surface of any case held to\n       involve a political question is found a textually demonstrable constitutional\n       commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or a lack of\n       judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or the\n       impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind\n       clearly for non-judicial discretion; or the impossibility of a court’s\n       undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect\n       due coordinate branches of government; or an unusual need for\n       unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; or the\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 36\n\f       potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by\n       various departments on one question.\nBaker, 369 U.S. at 217.\n\n       Baker has not appreciably mitigated the difficulty of locating Justice Frankfurter’s\n\n“very thin” line. The Baker Court itself acknowledged that its discussion “require[d]\n\nreview of a number of political question cases, in order to expose the attributes of the\n\ndoctrine—attributes which, in various settings, diverge, combine, appear, and disappear\n\nin seeming disorderliness.” Id. at 210. The Court also made the following observation:\n\n       Much confusion results from the capacity of the ‘political question’ label to\n       obscure the need for case-by-case inquiry. Deciding whether a matter\n       has in any measure been committed by the Constitution to another branch\n       of government . . . is itself a delicate exercise in constitutional\n       interpretation, and is a responsibility of this Court as ultimate interpreter of\n       the Constitution.\nId. at 210-11; accord Nixon v. United States, 506 U.S. 224, 228 (1993); Powell v.\n\nMcCormack, 395 U.S. 486, 521 (1969). “[D]eference,” the Court said, “rests on reason,\n\nnot habit.” Baker, 369 U.S. at 213.35\n\n       Although Pennsylvania has employed the Baker factors in its own political\n\nquestion jurisprudence, we mine the doctrine from a different seam. We have held that,\n\n“[i]n contrast to the federal approach, notions of case or controversy and justiciability\n\nhave no constitutional predicate, do not involve a court’s jurisdiction, and are regarded\n\n35\n        Scholars have questioned the very existence of a discrete political question\ndoctrine. See Louis Henkin, Is There a “Political Question” Doctrine?, 85 YALE L.J. 597,\n605 (1976) (“[T]he considerations distilled from [earlier cases] by Justice Brennan [in\nBaker] seem rather to be elements of the ordinary respect which the courts show to the\nsubstantive decisions of the political branches.”); id. at 606 (“In such cases . . . the court\ndoes not refuse judicial review; it exercises it. It is not dismissing an issue as non-\njusticiable; it adjudicates.

Daniels, 436 A.2d 1165, 1169 (Pa. 1981)\n\n(quoting Laurence Tribe, AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 79 (1978)) (“Thus the political\n\nquestion doctrine, like other justiciability doctrines, at bottom reflects the mixture of\n\nconstitutional interpretation and judicial discretion which is an inevitable by-product of\n\nthe efforts of federal courts to define their own limitations.”); cf.

See PA. CONST. art. V, § 1.\n       In application, the Court has recognized that “[i]t is the province of the\n       Judiciary to determine whether the Constitution or laws of the\n       Commonwealth require or prohibit the performance of certain acts. That\n       our role may not extend to the ultimate carrying out of those acts does not\n       reflect upon our capacity to determine the requirements of the law.”\n       Council 13, AFSCME ex rel. Fillman v. Rendell, 986 A.2d 63, 75\n       (Pa. 2009) (quoting Thornburgh v. Lewis, 470 A.2d 952, 955 (Pa. 1983)).\n       This is not a radical proposition in American law. See, e.g., Marbury,\n\n36\n       Although the lead opinion in Robinson Township did not command a majority of\nthe Court in all particulars, a majority of Justices joined this account of the political\nquestion doctrine.\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 38\n\f5 U.S. at 166 (“[W]here a specific duty is assigned by law [to another\nbranch of government], and individual rights depend upon the\nperformance of that duty, it seems equally clear that the individual who\nconsiders himself injured, has a right to resort to the laws of his country for\na remedy.”). Indeed, “[o]rdinarily, the exercise of the judiciary’s power to\nreview the constitutionality of legislative action does not offend the\nprinciple of separation of powers,” and abstention under the political[\n]question doctrine is implicated in limited settings.          See Hosp. &\nHealthsys. Ass’n of Pa. v. Commonwealth, 77 A.3d 587, 596 (Pa. 2013)\n(“HHAP”) (quoting Sweeney, 375 A.2d at 705).\nThe applicable standards to determine whether a claim warrants the\nexercise of judicial abstention or restraint under the political question\ndoctrine are well[-]settled. Courts will refrain from resolving a dispute and\nreviewing the actions of another branch only where “the determination\nwhether the action taken is within the power granted by the Constitution\nhas been entrusted exclusively and finally to the political branches of\ngovernment for ‘self-monitoring.’” Sweeney, 375 A.2d at 706; Council 13,\n986 A.2d at 76. To illustrate our approach to the political question\ndoctrine, we customarily reference the several formulations by which the\nU.S. Supreme Court has described a “political question” in Baker . . . .\nSee, e.g., Council 13; Thornburgh, supra.\n                                    ****\nWe have made clear, however, that “[w]e will not refrain from resolving a\ndispute which involves only an interpretation of the laws of the\nCommonwealth, for the resolution of such disputes is our constitutional\nduty.” Council 13, 986 A.2d at 76 (quoting Thornburgh, 470 A.2d at 956).\n“[T]he need for courts to fulfill their role of enforcing constitutional\nlimitations is particularly acute where the interests or entitlements of\nindividual citizens are at stake.” HHAP, 77 A.3d at 597 (citing Sweeney,\n375 A.2d at 709 (“[T]he political question doctrine is disfavored when a\nclaim is made that individual liberties have been infringed.”)); accord\nGondelman v.

Responsive litigation rhetoric raising the specter of\njudicial interference with legislative policy does not remove a legitimate\nlegal claim from the Court’s consideration; the political question doctrine is\na shield and not a sword to deflect judicial review. Council 13, 986 A.2d\nat 75-76. Furthermore, a statute is not exempt from a challenge brought\nfor judicial consideration simply because it is said to be the General\nAssembly’s expression of policy rendered in a polarized political context.\nSee id. at 76; HHAP, 77 A.3d at 598 (“[The] political question doctrine\ndoes not exist to remove a question of law from the Judiciary’s purview\nmerely because another branch has stated its own opinion of the salient\n\n\n                               [J-82-2016] - 39\n\f       legal issue.”). Whatever the context may have been, it produced\n       legislation; and it is the legislation that is being challenged. As the U.S.\n       Supreme Court has stated:\n          The idea that any legislature . . . can conclusively determine for the\n          people and for the courts that what it enacts in the form of law, or\n          what it authorizes its agents to do, is consistent with the\n          fundamental law, is in opposition to the theory of our institutions.\n          The duty rests upon all courts . . . when their jurisdiction is properly\n          invoked, to see to it that no right secured by the supreme law of the\n          land is impaired or destroyed by legislation. This function and duty\n          of the judiciary distinguishes the American system from all other\n          systems of government. The perpetuity of our institutions, and the\n          liberty which is enjoyed under them, depend, in no small degree,\n          upon the power given the judiciary to declare null and void all\n          legislation that is clearly repugnant to the supreme law of the land.\n       Smyth, 169 U.S. at 527-28.\nRobinson Twp., 83 A.3d at 927-29 (citations modified; footnote omitted); see HHAP,\n\n77 A.3d at 596-98 (quoting Jubelirer v.

While this Court has commented that the presence of any one Baker\n\ncriterion will render the question non-justiciable, Zemprelli, 436 A.2d at 1169, we have\n\nbeen circumspect in our application of the political question doctrine—arguably more so\n\nrecently. See Law Professors’ Amicus Curiae Brief at 18-19 & n.17 (counterposing six\n\ncases since 2000 in which this Court rejected political question doctrine arguments\n\nagainst two in which we did, one of which relied upon Marrero II).\n\n       A critical aspect of this formulation, arguably absent from Baker and its federal\n\nprogeny, warrants special notice. Under our account of the textual commitment factor,\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 40\n\fwe will abstain from reviewing cases only where “the determination whether the action\n\ntaken is within the power granted by the Constitution has been entrusted exclusively\n\nand finally to the political branches of government for ‘self-monitoring.’” Sweeney, 375\n\nA.2d at 706 (emphasis added); cf. Nixon, 506 U.S. at 240 (White, J., concurring) (“[T]he\n\nissue in the political question doctrine is not whether the constitutional text commits\n\nexclusive responsibility for a particular governmental function to one of the political\n\nbranches. . . .   Rather, the issue is whether the Constitution has given one of the\n\npolitical branches final responsibility for interpreting the scope and nature of such a\n\npower.” (emphasis in original)).37 It will not suffice to prevent our review to observe that\n\nthe constitutional provision in question has directed the General Assembly, not the\n\ncourts, to “provide for a thorough and efficient system of public education.”          The\n\nquestion is whether our Constitution, explicitly or impliedly, can be read as reflecting the\n\nclear intent to entrust the legislature with the sole prerogative to assess the adequacy of\n\nits own effort to satisfy that constitutional mandate. If the Constitution confers upon the\n\nGeneral Assembly the exclusive authority to monitor its own compliance with the\n\nEducation Clause, that authority’s absence from the text of the Education Clause\n\nrequires that it must be inferred.\n\n       C.     The Teachers’ Tenure Act Case, Danson, and Marrero II\n\n       As the discussion above suggests, deciding the two questions presented in this\n\ncase requires us to examine our ruling in Marrero II, which itself adopted wholesale the\n\n37\n         See Herbert Wechsler, Toward Neutral Principles of Constitutional Law, 73 HARV.\nL. REV. 1, 7-8 (1959) (“[A]ll the [political question] doctrine can defensibly imply is that\nthe courts are called upon to judge whether the Constitution has committed to another\nagency of government the autonomous determination of the issue raised, a finding that\nitself requires an interpretation.”) (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 41\n\fCommonwealth Court’s earlier opinion in that case, see Marrero ex rel. Tabales v.\n\nCommonwealth, 709 A.2d 956 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1998) (“Marrero I”). To do so, we must first\n\nreview the precedents upon which Marrero I and Marrero II relied, beginning with the\n\nTeachers’ Tenure Act Case, i.e., Malone v. Hayden, 197 A. 344 (Pa. 1938).\n\n       In the Teachers’ Tenure Act Case, this Court confronted teachers’ mandamus\n\nchallenge to the Teachers’ Tenure Act, which affected the contractual relationship\n\nbetween school districts and teachers subject to the Act’s ambit. “In considering laws\n\nrelating to the public school system,” we held, “courts will not inquire into the reason,\n\nwisdom, or expedience of the legislative policy” at issue, but only “whether the\n\nlegislation has a reasonable relation to the purpose expressed in [the Education\n\nClause], and whether the fruits or effects of such legislation impinge on the article by\n\ncircumscribing it, or abridging its exercise by future Legislatures within the field of ‘a\n\nthorough and efficient system of public schools.’” 197 A. at 352. Far from imposing a\n\nfixed standard upon the General Assembly, we observed, the Education Clause was\n\ndesigned “to enable successive Legislatures to adopt a changing program to keep\n\nabreast of educational advances. The people have directed that the cause of public\n\neducation . . . must evolute or retrograde with succeeding generations as the times\n\nprescribe.” Id. Thus, all matters bearing upon education, from employment contracts to\n\n“legislative determinations of school policy or the scope of educational activity, . . . must\n\nat all times be subject to future legislative control.” Id. If the General Assembly does\n\nnot retain such freedom, we held, “we will not have a thorough and efficient system of\n\npublic schools.” Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 42\n\f       It is important to note that, in that case, this Court considered whether the\n\nTeachers’ Tenure Act would preclude or interfere with future legislatures’ freedom to\n\nrefine and innovate education policy, thus confounding the Education Clause’s inferred\n\npurpose to afford the General Assembly precisely such latitude. That is to say, we\n\nasked whether the incumbent General Assembly at the time had prospectively infringed\n\nthe prerogative of successor legislatures. To the contrary, we found that the General\n\nAssembly’s modification of the pre-existing teacher contracts was an exercise of the\n\nlegislature’s freedom to innovate and adjust education policy, noting as well that “a\n\nsubsequent Legislature may abolish [the Teachers’ Tenure Act,] in toto, if it deems it\n\nnecessary to do so.” Id. at 353.38\n\n       Notably, we did not specifically decline to decide the constitutional challenge as a\n\npolitical question.   Rather, we measured the challenged legislation against the\n\nEducation Clause substantively without any express reservation about our authority to\n\ndo so. In adopting and applying the “reasonable relation” test, this Court assumed a\n\ndeferential posture toward the General Assembly’s efforts, reflecting the judicial restraint\n\n\n38\n        Inasmuch as this responded implicitly to the suggestion that the General\nAssembly might ever pass a statute concerning education that interfered with its own\nability to later repeal or modify that statute, or otherwise change education policy by\nlegislative action, it flirts with incoherence. Unlike the United States Congress, the\nPennsylvania General Assembly is not limited to specifically enumerated powers.\nRather, it may legislate in any way that is not expressly forbidden by the Pennsylvania\nor United States Constitution.         Compare U.S. CONST. art. I, § 8 (enumerating\nCongressional prerogatives), with Russ v. Commonwealth, 60 A. 169, 172 (Pa. 1905)\n(quoting Norris v. Clymer, 2 Pa. (Barr.) 277, 285 (1845)) (“What the people have not\nsaid in the organic law their representatives shall not do, they may do. . . . ‘The\nConstitution allows to the Legislature every power which it does not positively\nprohibit.’”). Thus, if the question is whether the General Assembly has authority to\nlegislate in the education arena, the answer is “Yes” in virtually every circumstance,\nprovided it stays within constitutional bounds.\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 43\n\fostensibly necessary to preserve free legislative development of education policy.\n\nHowever, in underscoring that any successor legislature would be free to amend or\n\nrepeal the Teachers’ Tenure Act, the Court spoke forcefully against the government’s\n\nprerogative to “bargain[] away or fetter[]” education, and emphasized that no laws, or\n\n“legislative incursions,” can be permitted to “destroy” the underlying constitutional\n\npurpose. Id. The Court thus implied that there was a body competent to ensure that\n\nsuch abuses did not happen. By its reference to “legislative incursions,” the Court\n\nconfounded any suggestion that the General Assembly itself could be that body.\n\nStructurally, only courts might police such legislative “incursions” upon the constitutional\n\nmandate.\n\n       Nearly a half-century later, in Danson v. Casey, 399 A.2d 360 (Pa. 1979), a case\n\nthat defies confident interpretation, plaintiffs alleged that “Pennsylvania’s system of\n\nschool financing fail[ed] to provide Philadelphia’s public school children with a thorough\n\nand efficient education and denie[d] them equal educational opportunity solely because\n\nof their residence in the School District of Philadelphia.” Id. at 363. Plaintiffs sought\n\ninjunctive relief based upon alleged violations of the Education Clause and equal\n\nprotection principles enshrined by Article III Section 32.39 Petitioners challenged the\n\nCommonwealth’s failure to supplement the Philadelphia School District’s budget so as\n\nto “furnish the children of Philadelphia . . . with a normal program of full educational\n\nservices” or to ensure that “the programs of educational services . . . are substantially\n\nuniform throughout all the school districts of the state.” Id. at 362-63.\n\n\n\n39\n       See supra n.3.\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 44\n\f       This Court first reviewed the prevailing formula by which state funds were\n\ndistributed to school districts statewide, a formula that, like the current one, sought to\n\nameliorate the hardships faced by economically disadvantaged districts. State funding\n\nnotwithstanding, in fact and by design, local revenue sources remained the major\n\nsource of school financing, just as they are now. Id. at 363-64. Notwithstanding the\n\nGeneral Assembly’s partial mitigation of the differences in resources produced by\n\nschool districts’ heavy reliance upon highly variable local tax policies and tax bases,\n\nplaintiffs argued that the legislative formula was insufficient to satisfy the Education\n\nClause’s mandate.\n\n       “More than forty years ago,” we observed in Danson, the Court “recognized [in\n\nthe Teachers’ Tenure Act Case], that because educational philosophy and needs\n\nchange constantly, the words ‘thorough and efficient’ must not be narrowly construed.”\n\nId. at 366. Reaffirming that the Education Clause must “enable successive legislatures\n\nto adopt a changing program to keep abreast of educational advances,” id. (quoting the\n\nTeachers’ Tenure Act Case, 197 A. at 352), we held that “[i]t would be . . . contrary to\n\nthe ‘essence’ of the Constitutional provision for this Court to bind future Legislatures and\n\nschool boards to a present judicial review of a constitutionally required ‘normal’ program\n\nof educational services.” Id. The Court then fashioned of whole cloth the hypothesis\n\nthat the only way we might “attempt to define the specific components of a ‘thorough\n\nand efficient [system of] education’” in a “judicially manageable” fashion would be to\n\nimpose “the rigid rule that each pupil must receive the same dollar expenditures.” Id.\n\nWe noted that the framers of the 1874 Constitution, in which the Education Clause first\n\nappeared with the requirement of thoroughness and efficiency, specifically considered\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 45\n\fand rejected any suggestion that Pennsylvania’s system of public education should be\n\nuniform, instead endorsing “local control to meet diverse local needs” and recognizing\n\n“the right of local communities to utilize local tax revenues to expand educational\n\nprograms subsidized by the state.”       Id. at 366-67.40    Thus, echoing the Teachers’\n\n\n40\n       The relationship of school funding and local control is often cited by defenders of\nhybrid school funding schemes that result in significant district-by-district disparities.\nNumerous courts and commentators have observed that this relationship is typically\nconclusory in its presentation, and disregards the limitations on local prerogatives\ncaused by a paucity of financial resources. The school funding disparities defended by\nresort to local control in practice disserve that end as to many districts. To cite just one\nexample, the Supreme Court of Arkansas has observed as follows:\n       Those jurisdictions finding no equal protection violation in a system based\n       on district wealth generally uphold the system of funding by finding a\n       legitimate state purpose in maintaining local control. We find however,\n       two fallacies in this reasoning. First, to alter the state financing system to\n       provide greater equalization among districts does not in any way dictate\n       that local control must be reduced. Second, as pointed out in Serrano v.\n       Priest, 557 P.2d 929, 948 (Cal. 1976), “The notion of local control was a\n       ‘cruel illusion’ for the poor districts due to limitations placed upon them by\n       the system itself. . . . Far from being necessary to promote local fiscal\n       choice, the present system actually deprives the less wealthy districts of\n       the option.”\nDupree v. Alma, 651 S.W.2d 90, 93 (Ark. 1983). Furthermore, recitations of the need\nfor local control cannot relieve the General Assembly of its exclusive obligation under\nthe Education Clause. Regardless of how it balances the minimal education that the\nConstitution requires to be provided to all students with the limitations inherent in local\ncontrol and funding (and, again, to suggest that those two are inextricable is\ntendentious), the General Assembly alone must be held accountable, regardless of\nwhether one perceives the cause of the actionable deficiency to exist at the local or\nstate level. Thus, in Smith v. School District of Upper Darby Township, we held that\n“[t]he Constitution of 1874 . . . directed the Legislature to maintain a ‘thorough and\nefficient system of public schools’ . . . . The school system, or the school districts, then,\nare but agencies of the state Legislature to administer this constitutional duty.” 130\nA.2d 661, 667 (Pa. 1957) (quoting Wilson v. Phila. Sch. Dist., 195 A. 90, 94 (Pa. 1937));\nsee Robinson v. Cahill, 303 A.2d 273, 294 (N.J. 1973) (“Whether the State acts directly\nor imposed the role upon local government, the end product must be what the\nconstitution commands. A system of instruction in any district of the State which is not\nthorough and efficient falls short of the constitutional command. . . . [T]he obligation is\nthe State’s to rectify it.”).\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 46\n\fTenure Act Case, we held that the Education Clause is satisfied “as long as the\n\nlegislative scheme for financing public education ‘has a reasonable relation’ to\n\n‘[providing] for the maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of public\n\nschools.’” Id. Because the funding framework there at issue was neutral with respect to\n\nthe Philadelphia School District and because it provided that district with “its fair share”\n\nof state subsidies, we concluded that the funding scheme was reasonably related “to\n\nmaintenance and support of a system of public education” and thus did not violate the\n\nEducation Clause. Id.\n\n       The Danson Court rejected plaintiffs’ equal protection claims with nothing more\n\nthan a brief observation that the Philadelphia School District could not be heard to\n\ncomplain of unequal treatment where it “arguably benefit[ed] from the operation of the\n\nschool financing scheme [because] more sources of taxation [were] made available to\n\nPhiladelphia than to any other category of school district.”       Id. at 367.   Given the\n\nabsence of reasoned analysis, Danson has very little if any precedential value regarding\n\nPetitioners’ equal protection challenge. See Ario v. Reliance Ins. Co., 980 A.2d 588,\n\n598 (Pa. 2009) (Saylor, J., concurring) (quoting Commonwealth v. Perry, 798 A.2d 697,\n\n707 (Pa. 2002) (Castille, J., concurring) (“[Stare decisis] only applies to issues actually\n\nraised, argued and adjudicated, and only where the decision was necessary to the\n\ndetermination of the case.”)).\n\n       If the Danson Court’s conclusory extension of the Teachers’ Tenure Act Case to\n\nthe question of justiciability was problematic, so, too, was the Court’s interjection of a\n\ncritical caveat into what first seemed to be a categorical ruling. Specifically, this Court\n\ndeclined entirely to foreclose the possibility that a funding disparity could lead to an\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 47\n\fEducation Clause violation. Instead, we distinguished cases from states in which the\n\nplaintiffs had presented evidence of “gross disparities in total and per child expenditures\n\nthroughout the state[s].” Danson, 399 A.2d at 365 n.10 (citing cases from Ohio, New\n\nYork, New Jersey, and California).41 It bears noting that, as set forth supra at length,\n\nPetitioners have alleged that per capita funding varies by nearly a three-to-one ratio\n\nfrom the best-funded to worst-funded schools, and have offered a litany of serious\n\ndeficits among districts relating to every aspect of the educational enterprise.       The\n\nDanson Court identified no such allegations, but the ratio and other allegations set forth\n\nby Petitioners in the instant case stand in stark opposition to the vague claims described\n\nby the Danson Court. The allegations before us suggest a “gross disparity” that, if true,\n\nmight sow doubt in the mind of a fact-finder regarding the thoroughness and efficiency\n\nof the education that the districts on the short end of the funding stick can hope to\n\nprovide. More importantly, the Danson caveat creates a great deal of implied conflict\n\nbetween that opinion’s per se overtone and its more fact-sensitive distinctions of cases\n\ngranting relief in other jurisdictions, cases which the Danson Court did not criticize or\n\ndisavow.\n\n       Nor does this discussion exhaust Danson’s internal tensions. On one hand, the\n\nDanson Court embraced and purported to apply the reasonable relation test from the\n\nTeachers’ Tenure Act Case to the challenge presented. On the other, it recited the\n\n41\n      But see Noreen O’Grady, Comment, Toward a Thorough and Efficient Education:\nResurrecting the Pennsylvania Education Clause, 67 TEMP. L. REV. 613, 633 (1994)\n(“[W]hen the Danson [C]ourt characterized these debates as indicating that the framers\nunderstood that local communities had the right to use local tax revenues to expand\neducational programs subsidized by the Commonwealth, it failed to clarify that those\nframers also understood that the Commonwealth had a duty to make a ‘good’ or ‘proper’\neducation available to all children throughout Pennsylvania.”) (footnotes omitted).\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 48\n\fBaker factors and held that the claim was not justiciable.        Complicating things still\n\nfurther, Danson also appeared to root its holding in the lack of “legal harm” or “legal\n\ninjury” alleged, terminology invoking the discrete question of standing, the absence of\n\nwhich would render the claims non-justiciable for reasons wholly distinct from the\n\npolitical question doctrine. See Danson, 399 A.2d at 365.42 In sum, the Danson Court’s\n\nimprecise approach, especially viewed in tandem with the “gross disparity” qualification,\n\nundermines any effort to derive a broad principle regarding the justiciability of Education\n\nClause and equal protection claims in the instant matter.\n\n        Then came Marrero II, the Education Clause case most like the one we now\n\nface, and the one upon which the Commonwealth relied in this case.43 In that case,\n\nplaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment holding that the General Assembly had failed to\n\nsatisfy the Education Clause’s mandate relative to the Philadelphia School District.\n\nPlaintiffs sought an injunction directing the appropriation of additional funds for the\n\ndistrict.   The Commonwealth Court sustained the Commonwealth’s preliminary\n\nobjections, holding that the claims in question were based upon matters committed\n\nsolely to the discretion of the General Assembly by the Education Clause and that the\n\ncase was non-justiciable on the basis that “it would be impossible to resolve the claims\n\nwithout making an initial policy determination of a kind which is clearly of legislative, and\n\n42\n       See HHAP, 77 A.3d at 599 (reviewing the requirements for standing, including a\n“real and concrete” controversy, a “substantial, direct, and immediate” interest in the\noutcome of the litigation, and aggrievement by the complained-of actions or omissions).\n43\n       Hereinafter, we refer primarily to Marrero I, the Commonwealth Court’s decision\nthat this Court adopted without material supplementation. See Marrero II, 739 A.2d\n110, 114 (Pa. 1999) (“The foregoing summary of the rationale of the Commonwealth\nCourt discloses no error, but rather a conscientious adherence to precedent which\nforecloses the relief sought by appellants.”).\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 49\n\fnot judicial, discretion.” Marrero I, 709 A.2d at 966. The Commonwealth Court also\n\nfound that the second Baker factor, a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable\n\nstandards, precluded judicial review. See 709 A.2d at 966.\n\n       Following Danson’s dubious lead, the Marrero I court asserted baldly that the\n\nonly judicially manageable standard for monitoring the legislature’s compliance with the\n\nconstitutional mandate would be to impose a rigid requirement that each student receive\n\nthe benefit of equal expenditures, despite the fact that plaintiffs suggested no such\n\nthing.44   To this premise, the Commonwealth Court responded, again without\n\ndevelopment or citation of developed authority, that expenditures alone “are not the\n\nexclusive yardstick of educational quality, or even of educational quantity.” Id. at 964\n\n(quoting Danson, 399 A.2d at 366).45         Rather, the Court explained, the quality of\n\neducation is dependent upon various factors, including the efficiency with which\n\nresources are utilized and the wisdom of particular expenditures.                 Thus, the\n\nCommonwealth Court ruled, “[a]s long as the legislative scheme for financing public\n\neducation ‘has a reasonable relation’ to ‘[providing] for the maintenance and support of\n\n\n44\n        Notably, in his Danson dissent, Justice Manderino disputed the majority’s similar\ncharacterization of the petitioners’ claims in that case, observing that they did not “ask\nthat this Court impose any rigid rules as to how much money each school district must\nreceive.” Danson, 399 A.2d at 369 (Manderino, J., dissenting).\n45\n         There is ample dispute regarding the relationship between the amount of money\nspent on education and the results of same. For example, in dissent in San Antonio\nIndependent School District v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1 (1973), Justice Marshall observed\nthat “[i]t is an inescapable fact that if one district has more funds available per pupil than\nanother district, the former will have greater choice in educational planning than will the\nlatter. . . . I believe the question of discrimination in educational quality must be\ndeemed to be an objective one that looks to what the State provides its children, not to\nwhat the children are able to do with what they receive.” Id. at 83-84 (Marshall, J.,\ndissenting); see also id. at 83 n.40 (noting authorities espousing contrary views).\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 50\n\fa thorough and efficient system of public schools,’ [Teachers’ Tenure Act Case, 197 A.\n\nat 352,] the General Assembly has fulfilled its constitutional duty.” Marrero I, 709 A.2d\n\nat 964 (quoting Danson, 399 A.2d at 367). The Commonwealth Court determined that\n\nthe financing scheme enacted by the General Assembly was reasonably related to its\n\nconstitutional mandate and was neutral with regard to the district, providing that district\n\nwith a “fair share” of state subsidies. Consequently, the legislative scheme did not\n\nviolate the Education Clause.     Having so declared, the Commonwealth Court then\n\ncircled back to observe, in the same terminology applied in the Teachers’ Tenure Act\n\nCase, that it would “not inquire into the reason, wisdom, or expediency of the legislative\n\npolicy with regard to education, nor any matters relating to legislative determinations of\n\nschool policy or the scope of educational activity.” Id. at 965. Thus, in Marrero I, as in\n\nDanson, and unlike in the Teachers’ Tenure Act Case upon which both decisions\n\npurported to rely, the court deemed the question non-justiciable, even as it utilized\n\nlanguage suggesting its review and rejection of the underlying challenge on the merits.\n\nMarrero I, 709 A.2d at 965-66.\n\n       The Teachers’ Tenure Act Case, Danson, and Marrero II necessarily inform our\n\nconsideration regarding the justiciability of Petitioners’ Education Clause and equal\n\nprotection claims. But to rely uncritically upon their analyses and holdings would be to\n\nrest our decision upon an unstable three-legged stool. The account above makes clear\n\njust how little weight that stool can bear. The first of these three cases assessed\n\nlegislative discretion alone, implicitly and necessarily treating a claimed violation of the\n\nEducation Clause as justiciable. The Teachers’ Tenure Act Case can be construed\n\neither as establishing a standard of review by which to review Education Clause\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 51\n\fchallenges, in the form of the reasonable relation test, or as one cursorily dismissing\n\nplaintiffs’ claim upon the strength of future legislatures’ discretion to modify education\n\npolicy. In fact, that future legislative discretion was not impaired by the Act in question,\n\ngiven that the Act could be repealed or amended at any time. Then, in Danson, the\n\nCourt seemed to vindicate deferential merits review in its recitation and apparent\n\napplication of the reasonable relation standard, only to follow that with what appeared to\n\nbe a determination that the challenge was not justiciable. The Court based this pivot\n\nupon the manifestly debatable premises that: (a) the only judicially discoverable and\n\nmanageable standard for resolving such a challenge would be to require equal per\n\ncapita expenditures statewide; and (b) the imposition of any judicially-defined standard\n\nwhatsoever necessarily would preclude the General Assembly’s continued salutary\n\nexperimentation with education policy.      Then came Marrero I and II, wherein the\n\nCommonwealth Court, and then this Court, adopted Danson wholesale, warts and all,\n\nagain applying the political question doctrine and reasonable relationship test\n\nsimultaneously—and irreconcilably.\n\n       For what little developed reasoning there is to be gleaned from our prior three\n\ncases, we must conclude that the slate relative to the instant challenges is, if not clean,\n\nthen at least relatively unadorned by any harmonious rule of law that controls the instant\n\nmatter. Thus, in addressing Petitioners’ claims in this case, we must consider anew the\n\nBaker factors as to each claim.\n\n       D.     Justiciability and the Education Clause\n\n       In evaluating the factors and their application to Petitioners’ Education Clause\n\nclaim, we focus upon the first three factors: a textually demonstrable commitment to the\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 52\n\fGeneral Assembly, a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards, 46 and\n\nan inability to decide the question without an initial policy determination not appropriate\n\nfor judicial discretion. These three factors are closely interrelated.47\n\n              1.     Textual Commitment\n\n       With regard to the textual commitment factor, Sweeney and Robinson Township,\n\ninter alia, have made clear that mere textual commitment of a given function to a given\n\nbranch of government does not by itself preclude judicial review. See, e.g., Robinson\n\nTwp., 83 A.3d at 928 (“Courts will refrain from resolving a dispute and reviewing the\n\nactions of another branch only where the determination whether the action taken is\n\nwithin the power granted by the Constitution has been entrusted exclusively and finally\n\nto the political branches of government for self-monitoring.”) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). Thus, there must be some indication that vested within the Education Clause\n\nmandate is the obligation and prerogative to “self-monitor.” That the mandate charges\n\nthe General Assembly with maintaining and supporting “a thorough and efficient system\n\nof public education” by no means implies that the legislature’s efforts at doing so may\n\n46\n       The Nixon Court observed that the “textually demonstrable constitutional\ncommitment” and “judicially discoverable and manageable standards” factors under\nBaker “are not completely separate; the lack of judicially manageable standards may\nstrengthen the conclusion that there is a textually demonstrable commitment to a\ncoordinate branch.” Nixon, 506 U.S. at 228-29; see id. at 240 (White, J., concurring)\n(“[C]ourts are sometimes aided by textual evidence that the Judiciary was not meant to\nexercise judicial review—a coordinate inquiry expressed in Baker’s ‘lack of judicially\ndiscoverable and manageable standards’ criterion.”).\n47\n       Like the parties, the following three factors we find immaterial to the instant case:\nan inability to resolve the issue without expressing a lack of respect for the coordinate\nbranches of government, an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political\ndecision already made, and “the potential for embarrassment from multifarious\npronouncements by various departments on one question.” Robinson Twp., 83 A.3d\nat 928.\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 53\n\fbe graded exclusively by that body without judicial recourse. We find no evidence from\n\nwhich to draw such a broad conclusion when it is antithetical to our prior stringent\n\naccounts of the textual commitment factor in Sweeney, Robinson Township, and other\n\ncases. This is especially so in light of the well-documented suspicion with which the\n\nframers of the 1874 Constitution viewed legislative overreach.48          Thus, any such\n\nimplication must lie in the close relationship between the textual commitment factor and\n\nthe lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards factor that has been\n\nrecognized in the past. See Nixon, 506 U.S. at 228-29.\n\n              2.     Judicially  Manageable         Standards      and     Initial   Policy\n                     Determinations\n\n       In proposing a basis upon which to harmonize rather than abrogate our prior\n\ndecisions,49 Petitioners, in sum, suggest that the recent proliferation of federal and state\n\n\n48\n       See supra at 12 & n.13.\n49\n        While Petitioners, perhaps in an abundance of circumspection, decline to\nsuggest that this Court should abrogate our prior case law, the Law School Professors\nas Amicus Curiae are not so shy. They argue forthrightly that Marrero II should be\nreconsidered and perhaps overruled. Executive Branch Respondents underscore that\nPetitioners have not taken that strong of a position. Brief for Executive Respondents at\n21 & n.8. They correctly note that issues raised only by friends of the Court may not be\nconsidered. Id. (citing Madison Const. Co. v. Harleysville Mut. Ins. Co., 735 A.2d 100,\n109 n.8 (Pa. 1999)). Thus, they effectively contend that Petitioners’ failure to make a\nfrontal attack upon our prior Education Clause case law forecloses this Court’s ability to\nconsider in this case the soundness and viability of our earlier decisions.\n       Respondents are correct to the extent that the question of the ongoing tenability\nof Danson, Marrero II, and the cases upon which they were based is not expressed in\nthe questions as to which we granted review, both of which inquire as to the justiciability\nof Petitioners’ claims. In reviewing those decisions, though, our final determination as\nto whether and how they apply to this case requires us to consider their internal\nconsistency as well as the cogency of their reasoning. Put another way, if, in seeking to\nharmonize these cases and apply them to the case before us, we find that we cannot do\nso with due rigor, we cannot look the other way simply because to abrogate prior\nprecedent in the process of resolving this case is more than Petitioners have asked us\n(continued…)\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 54\n\fcurricular mandates, in tandem with elaborate student assessment and school\n\naccountability measures, reflect a sea change in the legislative imposition of standards.\n\nSpecifically, the advent of the modern era of Common Core curricula and elaborate\n\ntools for assessing educational success, such as the PSSA and Keystone Exams,\n\ncontradict any argument that there are no judicially enforceable standards that might\n\napply to test the General Assembly’s satisfaction of its mandate. And because a court\n\ncan rely upon standards already established by the legislature to make a circumstance-\n\nspecific determination of educational adequacy without fashioning a fixed baseline\n\nstandard out of whole cloth, judicial oversight does not require an intrusion upon the\n\nGeneral Assembly’s policy-making function. Petitioners explain as follows:\n\n       After defining what children should learn in school (and imposing\n       significant consequences on those who fall short), the legislature has a\n       duty under the Education Clause to provide funding sufficient to ensure\n       that all students are given an opportunity to actually learn it. That duty\n       flows from the plain language of the Education Clause . . . . The\n       legislature’s current definition of a “thorough and efficient system of public\n       education”—as related in state academic standards and other legislative\n       enactments—thus defines the scope of its financial support obligations. In\n       other words, the Constitution requires the legislature to maintain and\n       support the system that the legislature itself has mandated.\nBrief for Petitioners at 33-34.\n\n       Petitioners reinforce this line of reasoning by reviewing other state courts that\n\nhave applied it in reviewing (on the merits) legislative compliance with their respective\n\n(…continued)\nto do. We would encourage the perpetuation of poorly reasoned precedent were we to\npermit ourselves to revisit the soundness of our case law only when expressly invited to\ndo so based upon a given party’s tactical decision of whether to attack adverse case\nlaw frontally (always a gamble against long odds) or to attempt more finely to distinguish\nthe adverse decisions. The scope of our review is not so circumscribed. See Freed v.\nGeisinger Med. Ctr., 5 A.3d 212, 231 (Pa. 2010) (noting that testing the validity of the\nSuperior Court’s ruling distinguishing one of our prior cases may entail reviewing the\nvalidity of the case in question).\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 55\n\feducation clauses. Petitioners acknowledge that some school districts may have poor\n\ntest results due to “local mismanagement or ineffective teachers,” even where the\n\nGeneral Assembly has allocated the resources necessary to provide the education that\n\nthe legislature itself has demanded. But Petitioners underscore that this is distinct from\n\njudicially assessing the alleged systemic inability of many school districts to satisfy\n\nlegislative standards given their limited resources, an infirmity curable only with greater\n\nstate assistance, given certain districts’ limited property tax bases and taxing authority.\n\nBy way of reinforcement, Petitioners review their pleading’s allegations and recite a\n\nseries of “abysmal” performance numbers50 from various school districts.            Id. at 36\n\n(citing Petition at 65-67 ¶ 156).       They underscore that universal satisfaction of\n\nperformance thresholds is not the goal. Rather, the General Assembly’s obligation lies\n\nin providing sufficient support to all school districts to ensure that their students have the\n\nopportunity to meet the General Assembly’s and Department of Education’s stated\n\nthresholds.\n\n       With regard to the funding component of providing such support, Petitioners point\n\nto the 2006-08 costing-out study ordered and obtained by the General Assembly. They\n\ncontend that, while the General Assembly effectively has defined an “adequate”\n\neducation either through, or at least by inference from, the various performance\n\nstandards it has imposed upon school districts, it also has access (as do the courts) to\n\nits own district-by-district costing-out study.   This study may be used to determine\n\n\n50\n       They note that Shenandoah Valley’s numbers were so poor in 2013 that, were\nthey to persist, only 36% of students would have graduated high school in the 2016-17\nschool year. Further, Petitioners allege that Shenandoah Valley’s scores were the\nhighest of all the petitioning school districts. Brief for Petitioners at 36-37.\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 56\n\fwhether the state’s financial support, in its magnitude and distribution, provides the\n\nopportunity to succeed relative to the state’s own benchmarks.\n\n      As to Baker’s “initial policy judgment” factor, Petitioners seek to distinguish, in\n\neffect, holding the General Assembly’s feet to the fire broadly from conducting a full\n\ninquisition on the particulars. Petitioners suggest that no such policy judgment need be\n\nmade in assessing the adequacy of the resources dedicated by the General Assembly\n\nto support fulfillment of objectives delineated by that selfsame body. Petitioners close\n\nby reviewing various decisions from other jurisdictions in which courts “crafted effective\n\nand noninvasive remedies to address education clause violations.” Id. at 41-43. In light\n\nof these developments over the past twenty years, Petitioners argue that it is\n\nincongruous for Respondents now to maintain that it is impossible for a court to fashion\n\na constitutional threshold for educational adequacy.\n\n      Respondents reply that it would be unreasonable to take a snapshot of legislative\n\nstandards at a moment in time and confer constitutional status upon that snapshot.\n\nThey suggest that, at any given moment, the legislature may be doing far more than any\n\nreasonable interpretation of the Constitution would require, implicitly arguing that the\n\nGeneral Assembly should retain latitude to do less. Respondents further argue that to\n\nadopt a fixed constitutional standard based upon any particular suite of benchmarks\n\nimposed by the General Assembly limits the legislative freedom to experiment with\n\neducation policy in response to changing needs and innovations. The necessity of this\n\nfreedom is precisely the one unequivocal proposition that may reasonably be inferred\n\nfrom the Teachers’ Tenure Act Case, Danson, and Marrero II. Alternatively, if a court\n\nwas to enshrine the standards of the moment as the constitutional threshold, but leave\n\n\n\n\n                                    [J-82-2016] - 57\n\fopen the door to future legislative changes with the expectation that those standards\n\nthen would become constitutional, such a holding would render our own rulings merely\n\nperfunctory.   More perniciously, Respondents say, the General Assembly might be\n\nencouraged to lower standards simply to deflect whatever judicial oversight might\n\nremain, enshrining utter and de facto legislative prerogative without acknowledging it as\n\nsuch.51\n\n       Respondents then adopt the dubious premise accepted without material\n\nexplanation by the Danson and Marrero II Courts that financial equalization offers the\n\nonly judicially manageable standard. To impose such a standard would confound the\n\nconstitutional design in numerous particulars. First, it would contradict the framers’\n\nspecific consideration and rejection of a uniformity requirement.        Second, it would\n\nundermine the enduring emphasis on local prerogatives that long has animated\n\neducation policy in the Commonwealth and elsewhere.52\n\n       It is true that Petitioners lean heavily upon the strict academic standards\n\nembodied in the General Assembly’s measures of educational success, without\n\n\n51\n        Respondents’ argument that the General Assembly alone has authority to\nmonitor its own compliance with the Education Clause renders this argument hollow. If\nRespondents prevail, the General Assembly would be free to defund education entirely\nwithout the interference of any other branch of government, subject only to the\nvicissitudes of the next election cycle. Accordingly, nothing this or any other court does\nwill increase the chance of the proverbial race to the bottom. On the Respondents’ own\naccount, the General Assembly can race to the bottom whenever it chooses for all\nanyone else can do to interfere.\n52\n       Presumably, given finite state resources, equalization of expenditures could be\nachieved only by capping what wealthier districts could spend on their schools. This is\nprecisely what Justice Manderino disputed when he disagreed with the Danson majority\nthat petitioners in that case sought any particular amount of funding for all districts as a\nproxy for educational adequacy. See supra n.44.\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 58\n\fexpressly allowing that the constitutional threshold found by a court might lie\n\nsomewhere below that level or be differently described. See Petition at 120-21 ¶¶ 313-\n\n14, 320-21 (seeking a court order directing, inter alia, that the General Assembly\n\nestablish a “school[ ]financing arrangement that is reasonably calculated to ensure that\n\nall students in Pennsylvania have an opportunity to obtain an adequate education that\n\nwill enable them to meet state academic standards”). It is reasonable to maintain that\n\nthese measures necessarily are mutable, and are ill-suited, as such, to serve as a\n\nconstitutional minimum now or in the future. Nonetheless, Petitioners also request relief\n\naimed at a more general purpose: a declaration that the General Assembly must\n\nprovide the “support necessary to ensure that all students have the opportunity to obtain\n\nan adequate education that will enable them to . . . participate meaningfully in the\n\neconomic, civic, and social activities of our society.” Id. at 120-21 ¶ 314.53 This is\n\ndistinct from Petitioners’ parallel prayers for the relief they seek in explicitly financial\n\nterms or in terms of the curricular mandates of the moment. That is to say, Petitioners’\n\nreliance upon today’s statutory or regulatory standards, or any particular standardized\n\ntesting measures, is by no means exclusive.\n\n       Even when Petitioners speak in financial terms, they do not conjure the straw\n\nman of funding equality or fixed standards so critical to this Court’s reasoning in Danson\n\nand Marrero II.    To the contrary, they posit that there exists a threshold level of\n\n“adequacy” that is a condition precedent to systemic thoroughness and efficiency in the\n\n\n53\n       See Petition at 122 ¶ 320 (seeking permanent injunctive relief directing the\nCommonwealth to “establish, fund, and maintain a thorough and efficient system of\npublic education that provides all students in Pennsylvania with an equal opportunity to\nobtain an adequate education”).\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 59\n\fconstitutionally-intended sense for which the General Assembly is responsible.\n\nConsonantly, Petitioners never dispute that individual districts should be free to utilize\n\nlocal funding sources to elevate their standards above the constitutional floor.\n\nAccordingly, we will not impute to Petitioners the desire for funding equality that, once\n\nposited, necessarily short-circuits an appropriately rigorous discussion of how courts\n\nmight ensure that the Education Clause is more than merely hortatory without unduly\n\ninfringing legislative prerogatives.\n\n       If we accept Respondents’ framing, the question of standards answers itself.\n\nSurely, it cannot be correct that we simply constitutionalize whatever standards the\n\nGeneral Assembly relies upon at a moment in time, and then fix those as the\n\nconstitutional minimum moving forward, if only because at that point our oversight\n\nfunction would be merely symbolic. But we must remember that the question presented\n\nis not what standard a court might employ in assessing the General Assembly’s\n\nsatisfaction of its mandate, but whether any conceivable judicially enforceable standard\n\nmight be formulated and applied after the development of an adequate record\n\nconsisting of an array of proposals as to how a court might fairly assess thoroughness\n\nand efficiency.54 That Petitioners focus upon the web of standards presently imposed\n\n\n54\n        Whatever definition of thoroughness and efficiency further study might\nrecommend, one must bear in mind the broad array of deficiencies alleged by\nPetitioners. See Petition at 72-105 (averring, inter alia, teacher shortages and\nclassroom overcrowding, crumbling infrastructure, unavailability of the most basic of\nlearning materials, and so on). It is incorrect to suggest that these reduce to nothing\nmore than a prayer for more money. To the contrary, Petitioners argue consistently that\nit is the General Assembly’s obligation to give each child an opportunity to obtain an\n“adequate” education, with the current elaborate matrix of assessments and\nbenchmarks merely indicative that such an opportunity is susceptible of measurement\nand enforcement.\n\n\n\n                                       [J-82-2016] - 60\n\fupon districts by the General Assembly and the Department of Education as offering\n\njudicially enforceable standards for constitutional purposes does not mean that we\n\nshould decide at this juncture whether those standards are suitable.             Nor does it\n\nforeclose the prospect that the Commonwealth Court on remand may fashion an\n\nentirely different standard, as is its prerogative by virtue of Petitioners’ request for “such\n\nother and further relief as the [c]ourt may deem just and proper.” Petition at 123 ¶ 324;\n\nsee Lower Frederick Twp. v. Clemmer, 543 A.2d 502, 512 (Pa. 1988) (“A prayer for\n\ngeneral relief is as broad as the equitable powers of the court. Under such a prayer a\n\nchancellor in equity may grant any relief that is consistent with the theory and purpose\n\nof the action.”); Meth v. Meth, 62 A.2d 848, 849 (Pa. 1949) (same).\n\n       It would be folly to suggest that creating a practicable standard by which courts\n\nmight define and measure the thoroughness and efficiency of a given statutory\n\neducational scheme presents no formidable challenge. But we are not called upon to\n\npropose such a definition now.       Our sister states, which have sought to do so by\n\nreference to the history of their own constitutions, have taken the most sensible\n\napproach. See, e.g., Hornbeck v. Somerset Cnty. Bd. of Ed., 458 A.2d 758, 770-81\n\n(Md. 1983). Because their histories are not ours, only their analytic approach is relevant\n\nat this juncture. The results of such an inquiry in Pennsylvania may vary.\n\n       The examples offered by other jurisdictions are worth reviewing, if only to gain\n\nsome sense of what happens when a court does not shy away from developing a broad,\n\nflexible judicial standard for assessing legislative fulfillment of a constitutional mandate\n\nto furnish public education while remaining sensitive to the legislature’s sole prerogative\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 61\n\fto negotiate the particular policies that will satisfy it.55 The West Virginia Supreme\n\nCourt, whose education clause provides that “[t]he Legislature shall provide, by general\n\nlaw, for a thorough and efficient system of free schools,”56 after carefully surveying the\n\nhistory of the framing of its clause, set forth the following standard:\n\n       [A thorough and efficient system of schools] develops, as best the state of\n       education expertise allows, the minds, bodies and social morality of its\n       charges to prepare them for useful and happy occupations, recreation and\n       citizenship, and does so economically.\n       Legally recognized elements in this definition are development in every\n       child to his or her capacity of (1) literacy; (2) ability to add, subtract,\n       multiply and divide numbers; (3) knowledge of government to the extent\n       that the child will be equipped as a citizen to make informed choices\n       among persons and issues that affect his own governance; (4) self-\n       knowledge and knowledge of his or her total environment to allow the child\n       to intelligently choose life work to know his or her options; (5) work-training\n       and advanced academic training as the child may intelligently choose;\n       (6) recreational pursuits; (7) interests in all creative arts, such as music,\n       theatre, literature, and the visual arts; (8) social ethics, both behavioral\n       and abstract, to facilitate compatibility with others in this society.\n       Implicit are supportive services: (1) good physical facilities, instructional\n       materials and personnel; (2) careful state and local supervision to prevent\n       waste and to monitor pupil, teacher and administrative competency.\nPauley v.

It essentially echoes the standards\n\noffered in Pauley and Leandro, supra:\n\n      Purpose of public education.\n\n      (a)   This section and § 4.12 (relating to academic standards) describe\n      the purpose of public education and its relationship with the academic\n      standards.\n\n      (b)    Public education prepares students for adult life by attending to\n      their intellectual and developmental needs and challenging them to\n      achieve at their highest level possible. In conjunction with families and\n      other community institutions, public education prepares students to\n      become self-directed, life-long learners and responsible, involved citizens.\n\n      (c)   Together with parents, families and community institutions, public\n      education provides opportunities for students to:\n\n             (1) Acquire knowledge and skills.\n\n             (2) Develop integrity.\n\n             (3) Process information.\n\n             (4) Think critically.\n\n             (5) Work independently.\n\n             (6) Collaborate with others.\n\n             (7) Adapt to change.\n\n                                            ****\n\n      (e)   Achievement of high academic standards in public education is\n      dependent upon the quality of instruction in schools and student effort\n      supported by the involvement of family and community.\n\n                                            ****\n\n      (g)   Public schools provide instruction throughout the curriculum so that\n      students may develop knowledge and skills in the following areas:\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 64\n\f              (1) English language arts.\n\n              (2) Mathematics.\n\n              (3) Science and technology.\n\n              (4) Environment and ecology.\n\n              (5) Social studies (civics and government, geography,\n              economics and history).\n\n              (6) Arts and humanities.\n\n              (7) Career education and work.\n\n              (8) Health, safety and physical education.\n\n              (9) Family and consumer science.\n\n22 Pa. Code § 4.11 (amended Feb. 16, 2008, Oct. 16, 2010, and Mar. 1, 2014). In light\n\nof this formulation, it is somewhat incongruous for Respondents to maintain that there is\n\nno prospect that a court could fashion a constitutionalized account not unlike this one,\n\nand measure the state of public education against that rubric, just as other states have\n\ndone.\n\n        The widespread recognition that the essential concepts at issue are amenable to\n\ndefinition underscores the difficulty with a per se rule of non-justiciability. It is instructive\n\nthat so many other states have found claims under their respective education clauses to\n\nbe justiciable, either explicitly in the face of political question challenges, or implicitly by\n\nanalyzing at length the merits of the challenges at issue. See Conn. Coal. for Justice in\n\nEduc. Funding, Inc., v. Rell, 990 A.2d 206, 225 n.24 (Conn. 2010) (citing cases to\n\nestablish that “the vast majority of jurisdictions ‘overwhelmingly’ have concluded that\n\nclaims that their legislatures have not fulfilled their constitutional responsibilities under\n\ntheir education clauses are justiciable”).

In addition to West Virginia, these include Maryland, Minnesota,\n\nNew Jersey, Ohio, Wyoming, and Illinois.58 It also is useful to consider those cases in\n\ntandem with cases reviewing other education clauses that employ qualitative\n\nlanguage—i.e., that which is amenable to interpretation59—which by and large have\n\nbeen treated as justiciable.60 Still other states have considered the merits of challenges\n\n\n58\n       See Hornbeck, 458 A.2d 758 (implicit finding of justiciability based upon merits\nreview); Skeen v.

In\nConnecticut Coalition for Justice, 990 A.2d at 232, the court noted the distinction\nbetween states, like Pennsylvania, that employ qualitative language and those that do\nnot, and found that even words such as “elementary,” “secondary,” and “school” “have a\nqualitative connotation” rendering the constitutional language less than self-explanatory,\nand therefore needful of interpretation. Commentators alike have sorted education\nclauses into discrete categories. See generally Dinan, supra n.11 (relying upon records\nof various states’ convention debates); Gershon M. Ratner, A New Legal Duty for Urban\nPublic Schools: Effective Education in Basic Skills, 63 TEX. L.

These suggest precisely\nthe sort of textual commitment that might satisfy the Robinson Township requirement\n(continued…)\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 68\n\f       These many decisions stand for the proposition that courts in a substantial\n\nmajority of American jurisdictions have declined to let the potential difficulty and conflict\n\nthat may attend constitutional oversight of education dissuade them from undertaking\n\nthe task of judicial review. Their methods of doing so, the standards and rigor they\n\nemploy, and the degree of their deference to legislative determinations vary, as do the\n\nresults of the cases they have considered. That a case is entertained on the merits\n\nhardly guarantees victory for either side. But it cannot be said that the inability to\n\nfashion a tidy, mechanical standard of review for such challenges has prompted many\n\nother states to abandon their judicial function.\n\n       Respondents argue, in effect, that this Court cannot define thoroughness and\n\nefficiency while still respecting the legislature’s primacy in fashioning educational policy\n\nand preserving its ongoing flexibility to refine that policy to reflect pedagogical advances\n\nand to adapt to changing times and evolving needs. But centuries of litigation leading to\n\njudicially enforceable definitions of such vague terms as “probable cause,” “due\n\nprocess,” “equal protection,” and “cruel and unusual punishment” undermine the\n\nargument. Courts give meaning routinely to all manner of amorphous constitutional\n\nconcepts, including those that lie at the intersection of legislative prerogative and judicial\n\nreview. And they do so while still leaving room for future development by whatever\n\ngovernment body or mechanism the law fairly prescribes. Nor is this a phenomenon\n\nreserved for fundamental rights. The United States Supreme Court has given judicial\n\nmeaning to such nebulous terms as “interstate commerce.” Cf. Nixon, 506 U.S. at 246-\n\n(…continued)\nthat the textual commitment include not only a mandate but also evidence that the\nframers intended the legislature to monitor its own compliance with that mandate.\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 69\n\f47 (White, J., concurring) (noting that the Court has taken it upon itself to construe\n\nconstitutional terminology such as “commerce,” which it did in Gibbons v. Ogden,\n\n22 U.S. 1, 72 (1924), and, more famously, “due process of law”); Baker, 369 U.S. at 226\n\n(“Judicial standards under the Equal Protection Clause are well[-]developed and\n\nfamiliar . . . .”).\n\n        The same is true of this Court. Recently, in Robinson Township, we rejected a\n\njusticiability challenge to claims that certain legislative actions failed to pay due regard\n\nto Article I, Section 27 of our Constitution, commonly referred to as the Environmental\n\nRights Amendment. There, we were called upon to give enforceable meaning to terms\n\nlike “clean air [and] pure water,” “preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and\n\nesthetic values of the environment,” and “natural resources,” and we undertook to\n\ndelineate how the Commonwealth might satisfy its mandate to “conserve and maintain\n\n[these natural resources] for the benefit of all the people.” See Robinson Twp., 83 A.3d\n\nat 969 (Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court).63 We rejected the suggestion\n\nthat the question was so political as to remove it from our purview. Surely, these terms\n\nare no more amenable to precise definition and mechanical application than a “thorough\n\nand efficient system of public education.”\n\n        We must at times return a case to a legislative body for further action with only a\n\nbroadly-stated mandate to serve as guidance.          This was the effective outcome in\n\n63\n       Noting the dearth of jurisprudence interpreting the Environmental Rights\nAmendment, a plurality of justices in Robinson Township emphasized that, nonetheless,\n“this Court has an obligation to vindicate the rights of its citizens . . . in accordance with\nthe plain language of the constitution.” Robinson Twp., 83 A.3d at 969. We also\nobserved that “[t]he [interpretive] task is neither more nor less intrusive upon a\ncoordinate branch function than in other matters in which we are called upon to\ndetermine the constitutional validity of a legislative act.” Id. at 929.\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 70\n\fRobinson Township. Furthermore, we have allowed claims to proceed even when the\n\nremedy might require increased funding for a government function, where the precise\n\namount of funding necessary is not amenable to easy quantification. See Kuren, 146\n\nA.3d 715 (reversing dismissal of injunctive claim based upon prospective violations of\n\nright to counsel due to county underfunding of indigent criminal defense resources); cf.\n\nPa. Env’l Defense Found. v. Commonwealth, 161 A.3d 911 (Pa. 2017) (holding that the\n\nEnvironmental Rights Amendment, PA. CONST. art. I, § 27, imposes limitations,\n\npreviously unrecognized, upon how the Commonwealth may dispose of the net\n\nproceeds of sales of public natural resources). And in Pennsylvania Human Relations\n\nCommission v. Chester School District, 233 A.2d 290 (Pa. 1967), finding that a school\n\ndistrict was too racially segregated to pass constitutional muster (a determination that,\n\nitself, required a necessarily imprecise assessment), we upheld an administrative order\n\ndirecting the school district through its board, officers, and agents to submit a\n\ndesegregation plan. Perhaps most notably, in Holt v. 2011 Legislative Reapportionment\n\nCommission, 38 A.3d 711 (Pa. 2012), we rejected a proposed legislative redistricting\n\nplan, notwithstanding the limited guidance we could offer the commission in remedying\n\nthe constitutional failings that we had identified.\n\n       To the extent that our prior cases have suggested, if murkily, that a court cannot\n\ndevise a judicially discoverable and manageable standard for Education Clause\n\ncompliance that does not entail making a policy determination inappropriate for judicial\n\ndiscretion, or that we may only deploy a rubber stamp in a hollow mockery of judicial\n\nreview, we underscore that we are not bound to follow precedent when it cannot bear\n\nscrutiny, either on its own terms or in light of subsequent developments. “Although this\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 71\n\fCourt adheres to the principle of stare decisis, it will not be bound by a decision that in\n\nitself is clearly contrary to the body of the law.

As this Court previously has recognized, “[w]here . . . by our\n\ndecisions . . . the Court distorted the clear intention of the legislative enactment and by\n\nthat erroneous interpretation permitted the policy of that legislation to be effectively\n\nfrustrated, we . . . have no alternative but to rectify our earlier pronouncements and may\n\nnot blindly adhere to the past rulings out of a deference to antiquity.” Perry, 798 A.2d\n\nat 707 & n.1 (Castille J., concurring) (quoting Mayhugh v. Coon, 331 A.2d 452, 456\n\n(Pa. 1975), and observing that the principle “is no less applicable to constitutional\n\nprovisions”).\n\n       We find irreconcilable deficiencies in the rigor, clarity, and consistency of the line\n\nof cases that culminated in Marrero II. When presented with a case that hinges upon\n\nour interpretation and application of prior case law, the validity of that case law always is\n\nsubject to consideration, and we follow the exercise of our interpretive function\n\nwherever it leads. Cf. Commonwealth ex rel. Marigotti v. Lawrence, 193 A. 46, 48\n\n(Pa. 1937) (quoting 1 Cooley, CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS 121 (8th ed. 1977)) (“[W]hen\n\na question involving important public or private rights, extending through all coming\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 72\n\ftime, has been passed upon on a single occasion, and which decision can in no just\n\nsense be said to have been acquiesced in, it is not only the right, but the duty, of the\n\ncourt, when properly called upon, to re-examine the questions involved, and again\n\nsubject them to judicial scrutiny.”).\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we reject Respondents’ and the lower courts’\n\nartificially narrow account of how a court may go about reviewing Education Clause\n\nchallenges. We do not take at face value Petitioners’ attempt to constitutionalize the\n\nstandards of the day. But we agree with the broader proposition—long accepted by\n\ndozens of our sister courts—that it is feasible for a court to give meaning and force to\n\nthe language of a constitutional mandate to furnish education of a specified quality, in\n\nthis case “thorough and efficient,” without trammeling the legislature in derogation of the\n\nseparation of powers. This, of course, does not suggest that Petitioners’ claims, or\n\nthose of any future litigant, should or will prevail. The parties have had no opportunity to\n\ndevelop the historic record concerning what, precisely, thoroughness and efficiency\n\nwere intended to entail, nor have they had an opportunity to develop a record enabling\n\nassessment of the adequacy of the current funding scheme relative to any particular\n\naccount of the Constitution’s meaning. We hold merely that Petitioners’ claims cannot\n\nbe dismissed as non-justiciable.\n\n       E.     Justiciability and Equal Protection\n\n       Petitioners’ equal protection claim sounds in Article III, Section 32 of the\n\nPennsylvania Constitution, not the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\n\nConstitution. See supra n.3. However, we have held that the substantive content of the\n\ntwo provisions does not differ significantly. Balt. & Ohio R. Co. v. Dep’t of Labor &\n\n\n\n\n                                        [J-82-2016] - 73\n\fIndus., 334 A.2d 636, 643 (Pa. 1975)); accord Commonwealth v. Albert, 758 A.2d 1149,\n\n1151 (Pa. 2000). Hence, we may consider them together. Section 32 embodies the\n\nprinciple that “like persons in like circumstances should be treated similarly by the\n\nsovereign.” Robinson Twp., 83 A.3d at 987.\n\n       Under a typical [equal protection] analysis of governmental classifications,\n       there are three different types of classifications calling for three different\n       standards of judicial review. The first type—classifications implicating\n       neither suspect classes nor fundamental rights—will be sustained if it\n       meets a “rational basis” test. In the second type of case[], where a\n       suspect classification has been made or a fundamental right has been\n       burdened, another standard of review is applied: that of strict scrutiny.\n       Finally, in the third type of cases, if “important,” though not fundamental\n       rights are affected by the classification, or if “sensitive” classifications have\n       been made, the United States Supreme Court has employed what may be\n       called an intermediate standard of review, or a heightened standard of\n       review.\nJames, 477 A.2d at 1305-1306. When applicable, strict scrutiny under equal protection\n\nrequires the court to determine whether the classification is necessary to advance a\n\ncompelling state interest. D.P. v. G.J.P., 146 A.3d 204, 210 (Pa. 2016). If the rational\n\nbasis test applies, then the classification in question must be “reasonable rather than\n\narbitrary and bear a reasonable relationship to the object of the legislation.[ 64] In other\n\nwords, a classification must rest upon some ground of difference which justifies the\n\nclassification and have a fair and substantial relationship to the object of the legislation.”\n\nAlbert, 758 A.2d at 1151 (citation omitted). Since Petitioners undisputedly do not claim\n\nto comprise a class historically recognized as “suspect” under the United States or\n\nPennsylvania Constitutions, they are entitled to elevated scrutiny only if they establish\n\n\n64\n       It is not lost on this Court that this “reasonable relationship” terminology closely\ntracks that of the “reasonable relation” test invoked, if opaquely employed, by this Court\nin the Teachers’ Tenure Act Case, Danson, and Marrero II.\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 74\n\fthat they have an important or fundamental right to education. Failing that, Petitioners\n\nwill prevail on their equal protection claim only if they establish that the school financing\n\nlegislation has no rational basis for the classification it utilizes in allocating funds at the\n\ndistrict level.\n\n        Although it did not do so in clear terms, it is difficult to understand the\n\nCommonwealth Court’s conclusory rejection of Petitioner’s equal protection claim as\n\nrelying upon anything other than this Court’s approach in Danson, in which we\n\nuncritically linked the plaintiff’s equal protection claim to the Education Clause. To that\n\nextent, the Commonwealth Court’s ruling in this case suffers from the same faults that\n\nhave led us to identify little of precedential value in Danson.                  Indeed, the\n\nCommonwealth Court’s disposition of the equal protection claim in the instant case\n\ndepends so completely upon the outcome of the Education Clause claim that we could\n\nsimply remand with direction that it consider that issue in light of our ruling with regard\n\nto the Education Clause. However, because we think it wrong to conflate Petitioners’\n\nequal protection claim with their Education Clause claims, we think it prudent to discuss\n\ntheir justiciability independently.\n\n        Despite some inevitable degree of overlap, Petitioners’ pleading establishes the\n\nindependence of their equal protection claim from their Education Clause claim. For\n\nexample, Petitioners allege classifications by which even with the benefit of a relatively\n\nhigher share of state funding some districts still have radically less to spend on their\n\nstudents than other districts that also receive state funding, albeit in smaller measure.\n\nAnd it is the classifications, not the absolute amounts, that form the basis of Petitioners’\n\nclaims. See Petition at 5 ¶ 7 (“[T]he very low levels of state funding and unusually high\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 75\n\fdependence on local taxes under the current financing arrangement have created gross\n\nfunding disparities among school districts—an asymmetry that disproportionately harms\n\nchildren residing in districts with low property values and incomes.”), 5 ¶ 8 (noting that\n\n“total education expenditures per student now range from as little as $9,800 per student\n\nin school districts with low property values and incomes to more than $28,400 per\n\nstudent in districts with high property values and incomes,” an “unconscionable and\n\nirrational funding disparity [that] violates the Equal Protection Clause”); 32 ¶ 94 (“A\n\nschool financing arrangement that denies children residing in school districts with low\n\nproperty values and incomes the opportunity to obtain an adequate education, while\n\nproviding sufficient resources to children in school districts with high property values\n\nand incomes, is unconstitutional.” (emphasis added)). Further, as set forth at length,\n\nsupra, even setting aside entirely the question of money, Petitioners assert myriad\n\ndeficiencies in facilities and educational materials, staffing, programming, and so on that\n\nare not specifically couched in terms of funding, and that conceivably could be rectified\n\nby means other than increasing monetary allocations to the districts in question.\n\n       In alleging the Commonwealth’s failure “to finance the Commonwealth’s public\n\neducation system in a manner that does not irrationally discriminate against a class of\n\nchildren,” id. at 2 ¶ 1 (emphasis added), it is clear that it is the manner of distribution,\n\nnot the quantum of financial resources distributed, that drives this claim. Moreover,\n\nPetitioners’ prayer for relief reinforces the distinction between their equal protection and\n\nEducation Clause arguments. See, e.g., id. at 8 ¶ 13 (seeking an injunction compelling\n\nthe legislature to halt any funding arrangement that “irrationally discriminates against\n\nchildren who live in school districts with low property values and incomes”); 121 ¶ 316\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 76\n\f(seeking a declaration that equal protection “imposes upon Respondents an obligation\n\nto adopt a school[ ]financing arrangement that does not discriminate against students\n\nbased on the amount of incomes and taxable property in their school districts”). In\n\nshort, Petitioners’ equal protection claims focus upon “the method by which education\n\nfunds are raised and distributed—not the overall amount of funding.”              Brief for\n\nPetitioners at 26 (emphasis in original).65 Thus, the Commonwealth Court erred to the\n\nextent that it determined that the fate of Petitioners’ equal protection claims necessarily\n\nis tied to that of their Education Clause claims.\n\n       Treating Petitioners’ equal protection claims as distinct leaves us with little basis\n\nupon which to deem them non-justiciable. On the question of justiciability, Respondents\n\nprimarily rely upon the proposition that the fate of Petitioners’ Education Clause claims\n\ndictates the fate of their equal protection claims.      But our determination that the\n\nEducation Clause claims are justiciable is fatal to that argument.\n\n       Application of the Baker factors does not suggest a different result.66 To the\n\nextent that Petitioners’ equal protection claim is tied to their Education Clause claim, the\n\nforegoing analysis governs, and the equal protection claim is justiciable. But treating\n\nthe claims separately, we find no analysis by the Commonwealth Court, no argument by\n\nRespondents, nor anything in law to suggest how Petitioners’ equal protection claim\n\ndoes not survive Baker scrutiny. If the Education Clause does not textually repose in\n\nthe General Assembly the authority to self-monitor and self-validate its compliance with\n\n65\n       To the extent that their Petition read as a whole creates any ambiguity on this\npoint, we emphasize that it is our obligation to read the Petition in the light most\nfavorable to Petitioners’ claims.\n66\n       The parties once again focus upon the first three Baker factors. See supra n.47.\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 77\n\fthat provision, certainly Article III, Section 32 does not do so, and no one suggests\n\notherwise.    Furthermore, there is little question that the rational basis/heightened\n\nscrutiny/strict scrutiny rubric that applies to equal protection claims is, by its very nature,\n\na judicially discoverable and manageable standard, and one that does not require a\n\npolicy determination that properly belongs to the legislature.\n\n       Of course, there is no question that, in addressing the latter two Baker concerns,\n\nthe substance of the underlying legal issue informs the question of standards—the very\n\nphrase “equal protection of the law” presupposes some other law that must be applied\n\nequally to similarly situated parties. But in that sense, we find ourselves confronting our\n\nruling as to the justiciability of the Education Clause claim, which leads to the same\n\nresult in this instance. All of which is to say, our foregoing ruling effectively compels us\n\nto determine that Petitioners’ equal protection claim is justiciable in the general sense.\n\nNeither the lower court nor Respondents suggest otherwise. Even if that were not the\n\ncase, Petitioners’ allegations raise the sort of equal protection questions that we nearly\n\nalways treat as justiciable: Whether there exists a classification; whether it is suspect or\n\nsubject to heightened scrutiny; whether it burdens a fundamental right; and whether the\n\nlaw is appropriately fashioned relative to the applicable standard of review. These are\n\nall commonplace inquiries in the courts, and involve neither undiscoverable nor\n\nunmanageable standards. Nor do they implicate initial policy considerations best left to\n\nthe legislature. Rather, the court measures the legislature’s initial policy consideration\n\nagainst a familiar, time-honored rubric that courts have applied on innumerable\n\noccasions.\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 78\n\f       In rebutting the existence of an individual right to education, Respondents rely in\n\npart on the United States Supreme Court’s decision in San Antonio Independent School\n\nDistrict v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1 (1973).       There, the Court faced a federal Equal\n\nProtection Clause challenge to the system by which Texas distributed state education\n\nfunding, a challenge substantively quite similar to the claim at issue in the instant case.\n\nThe Court ruled adversely to the plaintiffs in part based upon its determination that there\n\nis no right to education to be found in the United States Constitution.         That was a\n\nconsequence of the United States Constitution’s conspicuous and complete silence on\n\nthe very topic of education. This renders the High Court’s determination on the question\n\nof an individual right immaterial to the Pennsylvania Constitution, which, obviously, is\n\nnot at all silent on the topic. What is important to note in connection with this claim,\n\nhowever, is that the Court, as bound by Baker and its progeny as we are, did not find\n\nthe challenge non-justiciable as a political question. Rather, the Court engaged in a\n\nquite lengthy analysis of the merits of the claim.            Thus, in citing Rodriguez,\n\nRespondents effectively reinforce that Petitioners’ equal protection claims are justiciable\n\nwithout regard to the viability of their Education Clause claims.67\n\n       This leaves the question of what sort of right is at issue. In turn, this will dictate\n\nwhat standard of review applies to Petitioners’ equal protection claim, should it proceed.\n\nWe need not resolve that question presently, but we underscore that whether education\n\n67\n        No political question challenge was raised or addressed in Rodriguez. However,\nin federal courts, unlike in Pennsylvania courts, see supra at 37-38, the question of\njusticiability, and specifically the political question doctrine, goes to the jurisdictional\n“case or controversy” requirement set forth in Article III of the United States\nConstitution. See Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U.S. 208, 215\n(1974). Thus, the absence of discussion of the issue does not make less significant the\nCourt’s assertion of jurisdiction over the Equal Protection Clause claim.\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 79\n\fis a fundamental right under Pennsylvania law is not a settled question simply because\n\nDanson and Marrero II suggested as much. To the contrary, we do not read any of our\n\nprior cases as settling whether the Pennsylvania Constitution confers an individual right\n\nto education—and, if so, of what sort. In the Teachers’ Tenure Act Case, this Court\n\ndistinguished a Pennsylvania with the benefits of mandated public education from one\n\nin which education is “scarce,” “a privilege of the rich.” 197 A. at 352. This might be\n\ntaken as support for the proposition that the framers intended that what was once “a\n\nprivilege of the rich” would, through the Education Clause, become a right vested in all\n\nPennsylvanians. To similar effect, in School District of Philadelphia v. Twer, this Court\n\nobserved that “financial concerns could not in any way dilute the primary responsibility\n\nto maintain ‘a thorough and efficient system of public schools,’” and “that the\n\nmaintenance of a public school system is primarily for the education and training of our\n\nyouth.” 447 A.2d 222, 224 (Pa. 1982). Thus, “the polestar in any decision requiring the\n\nassignment of priorities of resources available for education must be the best interest of\n\nthe student.” Id.68\n\n\n\n68\n        This is consistent with the intuition that to disregard the beneficiaries of a\nmandate is to render that mandate little more than a hortatory slogan. But this intuition\nis by no means shared by all. Compare Wesley Hohfeld, Some Fundamental\nConceptions as Applied in Judicial Reasoning, 23 YALE L.J. 16, 32 (1913)\n(distinguishing rights from privileges, and observing that “‘[d]uty’ and ‘right’ are\ncorrelative terms”); McDuffy v.

It is required by Article III, Section 14 of the Pennsylvania\n\nConstitution.”   667 A.2d 5, 9 (Pa. 1995).    However, in Danson, albeit implicitly, we\n\nrejected the notion that there was an individual right to education, a proposition that we\n\nmade explicit in Marrero II. There, we approved what we characterized as Danson’s\n\nholding that our Constitution’s educational mandate does not confer an “individual right\n\nupon each student to a particular level or quality of education.” Marrero II, 739 A.2d\n\nat 112. The simple fact is that none of these cases conclusively decided the question,\n\nand to read any of them to the contrary is to confer upon them more precedential value\n\non that question than they warrant.

Viewed as necessarily derivative of Petitioners’ Education Clause claim,\n\nPetitioners’ equal protection claim is justiciable for the reasons set forth above. Viewed\n\nas an independent claim, we discern no basis in prior precedent or the arguments of the\n\nRespondents to establish that any of the Baker factors apply independently to bar\n\njudicial review. We decline at this time to address what individual right to education\n\nPetitioners may have, and concomitantly what level of scrutiny should apply to\n\nPetitioners’ claims, as these issues lie outside the ambit of the justiciability question we\n\nare called upon to answer here. It suffices at this time to note that our prior precedent is\n\ninconclusive.   We intend only to dispel any notion that our decision in Marrero II\n\nresolved the question as a matter of law.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\n       Two decades after Marbury, in another paean to the importance of judicial\n\nreview, Chief Justice Marshall cautioned that “[t]he judiciary cannot, as the legislature\n\nmay, avoid a measure because it approaches the confines of the [C]onstitution. We\n\ncannot pass it by because it is doubtful.         With whatever doubts, with whatever\n\ndifficulties, a case may be attended, we must decide it, if it be brought before us.”\n\nCohens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. 264, 404 (1821). The spirit of Chief Justice Marshall’s\n\ncautionary refrain has informed the clear majority of state courts that have held it their\n\njudicial duty to construe interpretation-begging state education clauses like ours to\n\n(…continued)\nS.E.2d 859; Campbell County School District v.

We hold that our Education Clause,\n\nviewed in the overarching context of our cases taking up the question of abstention from\n\npolitical questions, compels the same result. To the extent our prior cases suggest a\n\ncontrary result, they must yield.\n\n       To be sure, courts must take great care in wading deeply into questions of social\n\nand economic policy, which we long have recognized as fitting poorly with the judiciary’s\n\ninstitutional competencies. See, e.g., Martin v. Unemployment Comp. Bd. of Review,\n\n466 A.2d 107, 111-13 (Pa. 1963). However, the judiciary has a correlative and equally\n\nimportant obligation to fulfill its interpretive function. It bears repeating that the political\n\nquestion doctrine in Pennsylvania is of wholly prudential cloth, and hence must be\n\nconsidered anew each time it is invoked. See supra at 37-38. It is a mistake to conflate\n\nlegislative policy-making pursuant to a constitutional mandate with constitutional\n\ninterpretation of that mandate and the minimum that it requires. In this domain, as in so\n\nmany others, courts have the capacity to differentiate a constitutional threshold, which\n\nultimately is ours to determine, from the particular policy needs of a given moment,\n\nwhich lie within the General Assembly’s purview. The array of courts that have done\n\nprecisely that in this arena suggests that our assessment in this regard is neither\n\nimprudent nor uncommon.\n\n       It is fair neither to the people of the Commonwealth nor to the General Assembly\n\nitself to expect that body to police its own fulfillment of its constitutional mandate. This\n\nis especially so in light of the many competing and not infrequently incompatible\n\ndemands our legislators face to satisfy non-constitutional needs, appease dissatisfied\n\n\n\n\n                                       [J-82-2016] - 84\n\fconstituents, and balance a limited budget in a way that will placate a majority of\n\nmembers in both chambers despite innumerable differences regarding policy and\n\npriority.    Cf. Sweeney, 375 A.2d at 710 (quoting R. Brooke Jackson, The Political\n\nQuestion Doctrine, 44 U. COLO. L. REV. 477, 501 (1974)) (“One does not think of [the\n\nlegislature] as functionally equipped or designed to interpret the Constitution without\n\nreview, nor under our system, does one wish to leave to [the legislature] unbridled\n\nauthority to determine the constitutionality of its own acts.”). Judicial oversight must be\n\ncommensurate with the priority reflected in the fact that for centuries our charter has\n\nfeatured some form of educational mandate. Otherwise, it is all but inevitable that the\n\nobligation to support and maintain a “thorough and efficient system of public education”\n\nwill jostle on equal terms with non-constitutional considerations that the people deemed\n\nunworthy of embodying in their Constitution. We cannot avoid our responsibility to\n\nmonitor the General Assembly’s efforts in service of its mandate and to measure those\n\neffects     against   the   constitutional   imperative,   ensuring   that   non-constitutional\n\nconsiderations never prevail over that mandate.\n\n          Similarly, and for the reasons stated, we find colorable Petitioners’ allegation that\n\nthe General Assembly imposes a classification whereunder distribution of state funds\n\nresults in widespread deprivations in economically disadvantaged districts of the\n\nresources necessary to attain a constitutionally adequate education. Accordingly, the\n\nCommonwealth Court erred in determining that Petitioners’ equal protection claims are\n\nnon-justiciable. Whether Petitioners’ equal protection claims are viewed as intertwined\n\nwith their Education Clause claims or assessed independently, those claims are not\n\nsubject to judicial abstention under the political question doctrine.           It remains for\n\n\n\n\n                                        [J-82-2016] - 85\n\fPetitioners to substantiate and elucidate the classification at issue and to establish the\n\nnature of the right to education, if any, to determine what standard of review the lower\n\ncourt must employ to evaluate their challenge.          But Petitioners are entitled to the\n\nopportunity to do so.\n\n       The Commonwealth Court’s order sustaining the Commonwealth’s preliminary\n\nobjections is reversed.

They claim that the General Assembly’s failure legislatively to\n\n\n\n\n1\n       This case was reassigned to this author.\n2\n        See PA. CONST. art. III, § 14 (“The General Assembly shall provide for the\nmaintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of public education to\nserve the needs of the Commonwealth.”). While the constitutional mandate is directed\nsolely to the General Assembly, the remaining Commonwealth Respondents, who raise\nno specific challenge to their inclusion as parties, are named because Petitioners seek\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief that would constrain the executive branch’s\nadministration and enforcement of the challenged school financing scheme.\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 2\n\fameliorate those disparities to a greater extent than it does constitutes a violation of the\n\nequal protection of law guaranteed by the Pennsylvania Constitution.3\n\n       The Commonwealth Court, sitting in its original jurisdiction, dismissed both\n\nclaims at the pleading stage, relying upon this Court’s prior dispositions of similar\n\ncases.4   Arguably, these prior decisions held that such challenges to prerogatives\n\nconstitutionally conferred upon the General Assembly were political questions that the\n\ncourts cannot adjudicate without infringing upon the constitutional separation of powers.\n\nConcluding that these decisions controlled the issues presented, the Commonwealth\n\nCourt ruled that Petitioners’ claims lay outside the reach of the judiciary as non-\n\njusticiable political questions pursuant to the principles set forth in Baker v.

The Pennsylvania Constitution and Public Education6\n\n       The lineage of charters that led to Pennsylvania’s current Constitution offers a\n\nwindow into the shifting priorities and prerogatives animating the Commonwealth’s\n\nsometimes fractious history. This history informed the introduction and evolution of\n\nwhat became the Education Clause, a provision that has remained in our Constitution in\n\nmaterially the same form since 1874. We choose as a starting point William Penn’s\n\n1682 Frame of Government of Pennsylvania. This was Pennsylvania’s first charter, “in\n\neffect a constitution agreed upon between Penn and the colonists,” and “the first real\n\n5\n      Overruled on other grounds by Fed. Power Comm’n v.

Notably, Penn’s\n\nFramework provided for the creation of schools, and the colonial assembly passed\n\neducation legislation as early as 1683. William Penn himself stressed that the people\n\nshould “spare no cost” in providing for education, opining that “by such parsimony all is\n\nlost that is saved.”   PARSS at 87 (quoting Philip S. Klein, et al., A HISTORY          OF\n\nPENNSYLVANIA 384 (2d ed. 1973)). The Framework was short-lived, as Penn issued the\n\nCharter of Privileges in 1701, notable for its addition of certain defined individual\n\nliberties, and in particular its expansion of religious freedom and concomitant\n\nbroadening of the electoral franchise, which, in turn, transformed Pennsylvania into a\n\nhaven for oppressed religious sects. Notably absent from the Charter, though, was any\n\nprovision concerning education.\n\n       Continued economic growth, as well as demographic, economic, and political\n\nchanges, led to the Pennsylvania Convention of 1776. The Constitution that emerged\n\nfrom the convention, which came to be a model for other state charters, added\n\nextensive and now-familiar procedural protections, intra-governmental checks and\n\nbalances, and a detailed declaration of rights. Education also returned in the 1776\n\nConstitution’s mandate that “[a] school or schools shall be established in each county by\n\nthe legislature, for the convenient instruction of youth, with such salaries to the masters\n\npaid by the public, as may enable them to instruct youth at low prices.” PA.

This led to\n\ngridlock, recrimination, and, in due time, the 1789 Pennsylvania constitutional\n\nconvention, which culminated in the adoption of the 1790 Constitution.             The new\n\nConstitution divided legislative power into two houses, replaced the Council of Censors\n\nwith a unitary executive having veto power, and extended life tenure on good behavior\n\nto judges who were appointed rather than elected.7          Like other state constitutions\n\nenacted in that era, it resembled in its broad strokes, and in its conception of tripartite\n\nrepresentative democracy, the United States Constitution.\n\n       The fledgling federal constitution conspicuously omitted any mention of\n\neducation, which presumably was among the unenumerated powers reserved to the\n\nstates by the Tenth Amendment.8          But in Pennsylvania, the Constitution of 1790\n\npreserved generally the 1776 Constitution’s educational mandate, refining the language\n\nof the earlier clause to direct the legislature “to provide, by law, for the establishment of\n\nschools throughout the State, in such manner that the poor may be taught gratis.”\n\nPA. CONST. OF 1790 art. VII, § 1.\n\n\n7\n       The method of selecting judges in Pennsylvania repeatedly has changed over\nthe years. Presently, the selection of judges by partisan elections, subject to decennial\nretention elections, reflects changes effectuated in the 1968 Constitution. See generally\nPA. CONST. art. V, §§ 12-15.\n8\n       “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor\nprohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”\nU.S. CONST. amend X.\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 6\n\f      Judge Dan Pellegrini has provided a useful account of how the 1790 Education\n\nClause’s mandate was applied in the decades that followed:\n\n      Laws effectuating the [1790 Education Clause], passed in 1802, 1804[,]\n      and 1809, allowed parents who declared themselves paupers to receive\n      state aid to pay tuition at private institutions. But the “pauper school”\n      approach reached few children, and as late as 1828, the state had paid\n      the tuition of only 4,477 children that year. Ellwood P. Cubberley, PUBLIC\n      EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 192 (2d ed. 1934). Over half the state’s\n      400,000 children were not enrolled in school. Stuart G. Noble, A HISTORY\n      OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 160 (1938).\n\n      The cause of universal public education gained wide support during the\n      1820s. The Pennsylvania Society for the Promotion of Public Schools,\n      founded in 1827, petitioned for a revision of the state’s school laws. None\n      of the governors during the period that the 1809 law was in effect believed\n      that the constitutional mandate was being fulfilled. In his 1823 inaugural\n      address to the state legislature, Governor [John] Schulze stated:\n\n         The object of the convention seems to have been, to diffuse the\n         means of rudimental education so extensively, that they should be\n         completely within the reach of all—the poor who could not pay for\n         them, as well as the rich who could. Convinced that even liberty\n         without knowledge, is but a precarious blessing, I cannot therefore\n         too strongly recommend this subject to your consideration.\n\n      JOURNAL OF THE THIRTY-FOURTH HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 1823-24 151-\n      52, quoted in Lawrence A. Cremin, THE AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOL 104\n      (1951) (hereinafter “AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOL”). George Wolf, another\n      advocate of public education, was elected to two successive terms as\n      governor, beginning in 1829. In his message to the legislature in 1830,\n      Governor Wolf forcefully stated:\n\n         Of the various projects which present themselves, as tending to\n         contribute most essentially to the welfare and happiness of a\n         people, and which come within the scope of legislative action, and\n         require legislative aid, there is none which gives more ample\n         promise of success, than that of a liberal and enlightened system of\n         education, by means of which, the light of knowledge will be\n         diffused throughout the whole community, and imparted to every\n         individual susceptible of partaking of its blessings; to the poor as\n\n\n\n                                    [J-82-2016] - 7\n\f   well as to the rich, so that all may be fitted to participate in, and to\n   fulfil all the duties which each one owes to himself, to God, and to\n   his country. The [C]onstitution of Pennsylvania imperatively enjoins\n   the establishment of such a system. Public opinion demands it.\n   The state of public morals calls for it; and the security and stability\n   of the invaluable privileges which we have inherited from our\n   ancestors require our immediate attention to it.\n\nVI REGISTER OF PENNSYLVANIA 386 (1830), quoted in AMERICAN COMMON\nSCHOOL 104-105. In his 1831 message to the legislature, Governor Wolf\nsaid:\n\n   The improvement of the mind should be the first care of the\n   American statesman, and the dissemination of learning and\n   knowledge ought to form one of the principal objects of his\n   ambition. Virtue and intelligence are the only appropriate pillars\n   upon which a [r]epublican Government can securely rest . . . .\n   Under these impressions, no opportunity has been omitted\n   earnestly to press upon the attention of the legislature, the\n   indispensable necessity of establishing by law a general system of\n   common school education . . . .\n\nV PENNSYLVANIA ARCHIVES, FOURTH SERIES 962-64, quoted in Klein &\nHoogenboom, A HISTORY OF PENNSYLVANIA [page citation omitted] (2d ed.\n1973).\n\nThe efforts of the proponents of public education eventually produced\nresults. In 1831, the Report of the House Committee on Education\naddressed the shortcomings of the pauper school laws:\n\n   [T]he unremitted attention of your committee has been directed to\n   the labour of compiling the details of a system of common schools,\n   in which eventually all the children of our [C]ommonwealth may at\n   least be instructed in reading, and a knowledge of the English\n   language, in writing, arithmetic and geography—subjecting them to\n   such regulations as may best promote their future usefulness—\n   securing competent and able teachers, and providing for their\n   support . . . .\n\nVII REGISTER OF PENNSYLVANIA 386 (1830), quoted in AMERICAN COMMON\nSCHOOL 105. This report contributed to the passage of a bill creating a\npermanent school fund. During the 1833-34 session, Senator Samuel\n\n\n\n                               [J-82-2016] - 8\n\f       Breck was appointed chairman of a joint committee on education which\n       produced a report stating the following:\n\n          A radical defect in our laws upon the subject of education, is that\n          the public aid now given, and imperfectly given, is confined to the\n          poor. Aware of this, your committee have taken care to exclude the\n          word poor, from the bill which will accompany this report, meaning\n          to make the system general, that is to say, to form an educational\n          association between the rich, the comparatively rich, and the\n          destitute. Let them all fare alike in primary schools; receive the\n          same elementary instruction; imbibe the same republican spirit, and\n          be animated by a feeling of perfect equality.\n\n       XIII REGISTER OF PENNSYLVANIA 97 (1834), quoted in AMERICAN COMMON\n       SCHOOL 106. The bill accompanying the report was passed into law and\n       created a system of public schools. The act created school districts in\n       every ward, township and borough, which were given the choice of\n       participating in the new system or continuing to operate under the 1809\n       mandate of providing only for the education of the poor. To participate in\n       the disbursement of state funds, each district was required to raise by\n       local effort an amount twice that to be received from the state.[9]\n\n       While the new law was passed almost unanimously and received broad\n       support among the New England settlers of the northern tier counties and\n       the Scotch-Irish Presbyterians of the western counties, opponents rallied\n\n9\n        While, as detailed below, the precise ratio of state funds to local funds\ncomprising the non-federal share of any given school district’s budget will vary from one\ndistrict to the next, it is worth noting that, overall, the two-to-one ratio of local to state\nfunding approximates the overall ratio in effect nearly two hundred years later.\nHowever, as one commentator observes, it was not always so:\n       The high[-]water mark for [Pennsylvania] state contributions to public\n       education funding was in 1974-75, when the state reimbursed school\n       districts for 55% of their actual instructional expenses. By 2003-04, that\n       figure had dropped to 34%. The shift was not accidental: in 1983, the\n       state legislature removed language from the School Code which held the\n       state to a goal of paying 50% of statewide district instructional costs.\nAnn L. Martin, Comment, Been There, Done That: What Next?

Burrowes, to implement the newly-\n\ndesigned system that followed. By 1837, 742 of 987 districts were participating in the\n\nstate system. The notion of the pauper school had been marginalized, and most parts\n\nof the state accepted a tax-based system of public education for all young people.\n\n      In its contribution to and convergence with other state charters and the federal\n\nconstitution, Pennsylvania’s 1790 Constitution reflected the animating principles of a\n\nburgeoning nation. Nonetheless, simmering conflicts among competing factions, in part\n\nreflecting the divergent interests of the Commonwealth’s far-flung eastern and western\n\n10\n        As reflected by the Senate’s passage of a repeal bill in 1835, opposition to the\n1834 act was widespread and fierce, perhaps costing Governor Wolf his job in the 1835\nelection and leading to the election of repeal-inclined senators and representatives.\nThirty-eight of fifty-one counties sent petitions seeking repeal, and at least two more\npetitioned for modifications. Only eleven counties refrained entirely from seeking\nchanges to the new act. The Famous Speech of Hon.

Mr. Stevens’ entire speech is\nworthy of review, but among his observations was that, “[i]f education be of admitted\nimportance to the people under all forms of government, and of unquestioned necessity\nwhen they govern themselves, it follows of course that its cultivation and diffusion is a\nmatter of public concern, and a duty which every government owes to its people.” Id.\nat 4 (emphasis in original).\n\n\n\n                                    [J-82-2016] - 10\n\fpopulations, led to a successful 1837 popular referendum calling for a constitutional\n\nconvention.    The resulting 1838 Constitution adjusted the structure of government,\n\nproviding refinements in the protection of rights and the imposition of additional\n\nlimitations on legislative power. The 1790 Constitution’s Education Clause remained\n\nunchanged.11\n\n      Judge Pellegrini continues:\n\n      The 1850s saw an expansion of legislative activity concerning education.\n      In 1851, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the clause\n      concerning free education for the poor, contained in the education\n      provision of the constitutions of 1790 and 1838, was not a limitation on the\n      power of the legislat[ure]. Commonwealth v. Hartman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pa.</span> <span class=\"page\">118</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1851).\n      The [C]ourt held that the clause defined the minimum legislative effort and\n      did not enjoin the legislature from doing more. Id. In 1852, another\n      staunch supporter of public education, William Bigler, was elected\n      governor. . . . Governor Bigler oversaw an expansion of state efforts in\n      education, which included the establishment of the first state normal\n      schools and the State Teachers’ Association and the first publication of\n      the Pennsylvania School Journal.\n\n      During this period, Pennsylvania was not alone in its efforts to institute a\n      universal system of public education. People like Horace Mann in\n      Massachusetts, Henry Barnard in Connecticut, Samuel Lewis in Ohio, and\n      John Pierce in Michigan led movements advocating publicly-funded\n      universal education. Some states added education clauses to their\n      constitutions or strengthened their commitment to education by passing\n      new legislation. The phrase “thorough and efficient” was first included in\n\n11\n       Interestingly, as a reflection of the Commonwealth’s collective, ongoing\ncommitment to an education that might fairly be called “thorough,” delegates to the 1837\nconvention defeated an amendment that would have added “common” as a modifier to\nthe Education Clause. In the parlance of that era, such language would have purported\nto restrict the state’s obligation to the maintenance only of a system of elementary and\nmiddle schools, as we define them today.

The new clause directed the General Assembly to “provide for the\n\nmaintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of public schools, wherein\n\nall the children of this Commonwealth above the age of six years may be educated,”\n\nand specified that the legislature “shall appropriate at least one million dollars each year\n\nfor that purpose.” PA.

Most notably, delegates to the convention appear to have linked the\n\nimportance of public education to the success of democracy, with William Darlington\n\naverring that “the perpetuity of free institutions rests, in a large degree, upon the\n\nintelligence of the people, and that intelligence is to be secured by education,” and\n\nfurther opining that “[t]he section on education is second in importance to no other\n\nsection to be submitted to this Convention.” PARSS at 98 (quoting II PENNSYLVANIA\n\nDEBATES    OF   1873 421).14 This Court, in turn, has noted that the General Assembly,\n\nwhile enacting piecemeal legislation in its service, did not entirely fulfill the 1790\n\nConstitution’s education mandate until the Act of May 8, 1854, P.L. 617, which for the\n\n\n14\n       The transition from a mandate to “establish” a system of education to one\nrequiring “maintenance and support” was described by one delegate to the 1873\nconvention as a way of recognizing “the existence of that admirable system of public\nschools which now prevails all over the Commonwealth,” i.e., as a reflection of principle\nand the status quo, rather than a mandate to effect specific change.

Concerns also arose that local districts would be precluded from raising\n\nadditional funds to supplement and enrich the educations they might provide, a\n\ndisfavored intrusion upon local prerogatives.

Instead, the appropriation “would equalize the\n\nburdens of supporting the system” of education prescribed by the Constitution. PARSS\n\nat 101 (quoting II PENNSYLVANIA DEBATES OF 1873 679).16 Conversely, opponents raised\n\nthe specter of state intrusion upon local districts’ prerogatives to tailor education to local\n\nresources and needs.\n\n       The 1874 numbering and text of the Education Clause were amended during the\n\n1967 constitutional convention to read, “The General Assembly shall provide for the\n\nmaintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of public education to\n\nserve the needs of the Commonwealth.”            PA.

Thus, while the language upon which the instant case\n\nprimarily hinges first appeared in our Constitution in 1874, it did not take on its present\n\nform until the adoption of the 1968 Constitution.\n\n       B.

Petitioners’ Allegations\n\n      Petitioners’ averments, which for purposes of review we must take as true and\n\nread in the light most favorable to their causes of action,17 fall into two sometimes\n\noverlapping categories. Generally, Petitioners aver that Pennsylvania’s school funding\n\nsystem is flawed on its face in its failure to ensure, in tandem with local funding, that\n\neach school district has the resources necessary to provide an adequate education.\n\nThis includes broad averments as well as more particularized allegations, couched in\n\n17\n      Kuren v.

As an organizing principle, we review these\n\nallegations in turn.\n\n       In 1999, the General Assembly imposed an elaborate set of standards to govern\n\nthe content of educational materials, which led to the adoption of assessment and\n\naccountability measures tied to those standards. Thus, through authority conferred by\n\nthe School Code, the Department of Education adopted a series of regulations “to\n\nestablish rigorous academic standards and assessments, applicable only to the public\n\nschools in this Commonwealth, to facilitate the improvement of student achievement\n\nand to provide parents and communities a measure by which school performance can\n\nbe determined.” 22 Pa. Code § 4.2.18\n\n\n18\n      One commentator, addressing the evolution of the “standards-based model” of\neducation, provides a useful shorthand for the components of such an educational\nparadigm, noting that the model entails “three key components: (1) academic content\nstandards for various subjects identifying what a student should know and be able to do\nat each grade level; (2) standardized tests designed to gauge student mastery of these\nstandards; and (3) a system of accountability for schools, including rewards and\nconsequences based on individual school and district performance.” Jill Ambrose,\nNote, A Fourth Wave of Education Funding Litigation: How Education Standards &\nCosting-Out Studies Can Aid Plaintiffs in Pennsylvania & Beyond, 19 B.U. PUB. INT. L.J.\n107, 117 (2009).\n       Executive Respondents reject the thrust of Petitioners’ contention that 1999\nmarked the initial imposition of academic standards upon school districts. Executive\nRespondents note that, over fifty years ago, in 1963, in service of the goal of facilitating\nthe “expeditious reorganization” of the Commonwealth’s public school system,\n(continued…)\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 17\n\f      In its statement of “general policies,” the new regulatory framework reinforced the\n\nprinciple that districts should be free to fashion local curricula to achieve prescribed\n\nacademic standards, retaining “the greatest possible flexibility in curriculum planning,”\n\nwhile meeting prescribed course and curriculum requirements, ensuring the provision of\n\nspecified numbers of days and hours of instruction at different school levels, and\n\nmaintaining a sufficient professional staff. The Department further committed to support\n\nlocal efforts, by, e.g., establishing model curricula and diagnostic tools tailored to\n\nsatisfying the state assessment system. 22 Pa. Code. § 4.4. The state assessments\n\n(…continued)\n24 Pa.C.S. § 2-290, the General Assembly directed the Department of Education to\n“develop or cause to be developed an evaluation procedure designed to measure\nobjectively the adequacy and efficiency of the educational programs offered by the\npublic schools” by, e.g., deploying tests to measure “the achievements and performance\nof students.” 24 P.S. § 2-290.1; see Brief for Executive Respondents at 23. They note\nthat systematic school and student assessments were administered as early as the\n1969-70 school year under the Educational Quality Assurance (“EQA”) program, which\nwas joined, in 1984, by the Testing for Educational Learning and Literacy Skills\n(“TELLS”). EQA was discontinued in 1988, and, in 1992, TELLS was replaced by the\nfirst incarnation of the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment (“PSSA”). This\ndoes not strike us as contradictory of Petitioners’ claim that the pervasiveness, rigor,\nand thoroughness of the tests employed by the Commonwealth in determining the\nprogress of individual students and the success of individual teachers, programs, and\nschools and their districts increased significantly in 1999, when, by Executive\nRespondents’ own admission, the PSSA was substantially overhauled. Id. at 26-27.\nPassage of the No Child Left Behind Act in 2001 tied federal funding to various federal\nmandates and standards. See 20 U.S.C. § 6311; Aaron Y. Tang, Broken Systems,\nBroken Duties: A New Theory for School Finance Litigation, 94 MARQ. L. REV. 1195,\n1213-14 (2011). In light of the complications associated with this subject, our standard\nof review prevails and we assume the truth of Petitioners’ averments in this regard. But\nto the extent that it is material to what follows, we accept as undisputed Executive\nRespondents’ observation that standards and measurement have been in play in\nPennsylvania public education in one form or another since the 1960s, and that these\ncontinue to evolve. That being said, Respondents do not suggest that there is a strong\nresemblance between the pre-1999 and post-1999 landscape in terms of the frequency,\ndepth, and consequence associated with the exams administered to students who\nattend Pennsylvania’s public schools. Absent that, we are bound to accept the thrust of\nPetitioners’ assertions as true to at least that extent.\n\n\n\n                                    [J-82-2016] - 18\n\fare conducted primarily through the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment\n\n(“PSSA”) and Keystone Exams. See generally 22 Pa. Code. §§ 4.51, et seq.\n\n      In 2008, the General Assembly passed Act 61.19 In that measure, the legislature\n\nresponded to an extensive “costing out” study it had commissioned, which had\n\nestablished benchmarks for effective funding levels on a district-by-district basis and\n\npointed to widespread funding deficiencies and inequities in Pennsylvania’s public\n\nschool system.20   The General Assembly implemented a “Basic Education Funding\n\nPlan” for calculating the distribution of state resources among Pennsylvania’s school\n\ndistricts. The costing-out study found that 94% of Pennsylvania school districts were\n\nspending less than should be spent to meet the Commonwealth’s own academic\n\nstandards. The poorest quintile of school districts needed to spend 38% more than they\n\nwere spending, while the wealthiest quintile needed to increase spending by 7%. The\n\naggregate statewide shortfall relative to what was required to meet those standards was\n\nover $20 billion. Under Act 61, funding levels for the 2008-09 school year increased by\n\n$274.7 million, a 5% increase over the preceding year. In the two years that followed,\n\nutilizing the same formula, the Commonwealth increased state funding by approximately\n\n$300 million and $355 million, respectively. Thus, as against the study’s recommended\n\n\n\n19\n      Act of July 9, 2008, P.L. 846, No. 61, amending Act of Mar. 10, 1949, P.L. 30,\nNo. 14, codified at 24 P.S. §§ 1-101, et seq.\n20\n       While we consider this “costing-out” study, infra, to the extent necessary to\naddress the parties’ arguments, it is beyond the scope of this Opinion to delve deeply\ninto the nature of such studies. For a succinct description of the methodologies\nemployed in such studies and how they have been utilized in forming education policy in\nother states, as well as a brief description of the specific study conducted at the behest\nof the Pennsylvania General Assembly, see Ambrose, supra n.18, at 119-22.\n\n\n\n                                    [J-82-2016] - 19\n\f$20 billion increase, Act 61 provided for an increase of roughly $1 billion over three\n\nschool years.\n\n      The increased funding drew heavily upon federal stimulus funds furnished to the\n\nstate pursuant to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”). 21\n\nARRA expired in 2011, by which time the Commonwealth had relied upon hundreds of\n\nmillions of federal dollars to reduce the Commonwealth’s direct contribution to the\n\nfunding pool by which Act 61’s mandate was fulfilled. In the wake of ARRA’s expiration,\n\nthe Commonwealth faced a shortfall of over $800 million relative to prior funding levels,\n\nwhich was reflected in the 2011 budget. Pursuant thereto, the basic education subsidy\n\nwas reduced by $420 million; Accountability Block Grants, which fund initiatives such as\n\nfull-day kindergarten, tutoring assistance, and class size reduction, by $160 million;\n\ncharter school reimbursements, which partially compensate school districts for the cost\n\nof transferring district funds to charter schools, by $224 million; and the Educational\n\nAssistance Program, which funds tutoring services, by $47 million, with additional\n\nreductions affecting other initiatives, including those aimed at improving educational\n\nachievement in low-performing schools.      The 2011 budget also destabilized school\n\nfunding generally, by abandoning Act 61’s long-term funding formula in favor of mutable\n\nannual funding calculations. Compounding the funding shortfalls was the Taxpayer\n\nRelief Act of 2006,22 which restricted the ability of local jurisdictions to offset state\n\nbudget cuts by increasing local taxes. In 2011, Petitioners note, in the face of the above\n\n21\n      Act of Feb. 17, 2009, P.L. 111-5, 123 Stat. 115, codified as amended at 26\nU.S.C. §§ 1, et seq.\n22\n      Act of June 27, 2006, P.L. 1973, No. 1 (Spec.

Petition for Review (“Petition”)\n\nat 54 ¶ 142 & n.46 (citing Pa. Budget & Policy Ctr. Staff, Pa. House Budget Locks in\n\nMost of the School Funding Cuts, June 21, 2013). Petitioners further allege a host of\n\npronounced inequities within and among school districts that obtained under the 2011\n\nfunding scheme, including but not restricted to massive district-by-district funding\n\ndisparities; low-wealth districts’ inability to provide individualized instruction to children\n\nwho require it; shortages of essential learning materials such as computers and text\n\n\n23\n      Widespread funding shortages and reductions in education expenditures in the\nwake of 2008’s “Great Recession” have been well-documented.

REV. 1855 (2011).\n24\n       The considerable time that has passed since Petitioners filed their Petition\nnecessarily renders their allegations dated, in their particulars if not in their overarching\npropositions. Nonetheless, as a convenience, we utilize the present tense in rendering\nPetitioners’ allegations, with the caveat that certain specific allegations presumably will\nrequire updating as this litigation proceeds in the wake of our decision. Notably, while\ncommon sense strongly suggests that particular allegations, especially quantifiable\naverments, will not be accurate at any given moment relative to present circumstances,\nwe nonetheless are bound by this case’s procedural posture to accept Petitioners’\nallegations at face value.\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 21\n\fbooks; persistent and ongoing reductions in teachers and staff, with concomitant\n\nincreases in student-teacher ratios and class size; the elimination of educational\n\nprograms such as art, music, and foreign languages; and deficiencies in learning\n\nmaterials and physical school facilities.\n\n       Petitioners offered an overview of the funding scheme that applied when they\n\nfiled their Petition.25 Their account is quite detailed, but for present purposes it suffices\n\nto highlight the broader points.    Petitioners aver that 87% of Pennsylvania’s public\n\neducation budget is funded through state appropriations and local property taxes, while\n\n13% is contributed by the federal government.             In 2011, local taxes provided\n\napproximately 53%, with state appropriations comprising approximately 34% of\n\nstatewide public school expenditures. State funds are distributed according to an aid\n\nratio, which divides state funding according to various formulas that are designed to\n\naccount for the aggregate property values and personal incomes in a given school\n\ndistrict in discerning, speaking broadly, the wealth per student in a given district. A\n\ndistrict’s “wealth” is then measured against the state average, and the less favorably it\n\ncompares, the greater proportional share of state education funds it receives.\n\n\n\n25\n       When Petitioners filed their challenge, the state funding formula that applied to\nthe allocation of state funding among school districts was provided by 24 P.S. §§ 25-\n2502.50 (“Basic education funding for 2010-11 school year”), 25-2502.51 (2011-12\nschool year), and 25-2502.52 (2012-13 school year). See Act of June 30, 2011,\nP.L. 112, No. 24, § 26.        However, after the Commonwealth Court sustained\nRespondents’ preliminary objections in this matter, and indeed after briefing was\ncompleted before this Court, the General Assembly enacted Act 35, which created a\nnew state funding formula that applied to the 2016-17 school year and applies each\nyear thereafter. See Act of June 1, 2016, P.L. 252, No. 35, § 1, codified at 24 P.S. § 25-\n2502.53. The effect of this change is addressed infra, at the outset of our discussion of\nthe legal issues presented.\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 22\n\f       Districts with lower wealth per student values are unable to raise the same per\n\ncapita funding through local property taxes as districts with higher values.             The\n\ndependence of local tax revenues on the application of millage rates, which can vary\n\nover only a limited range, upon the aggregate value of the property in the district confers\n\nan insuperable advantage to districts that have a ratio of assessed property wealth per\n\nstudent that is significantly higher than districts with less aggregate property value.\n\nThus, even low-wealth districts that impose substantially higher tax rates on their\n\nproperty cannot generate close to as much tax revenue per student as districts with\n\nsubstantially higher property values, even when the latter districts impose tax rates that\n\nare a fraction of those imposed by low-wealth districts. Thus, while Shenandoah Valley\n\nSchool District applied a property tax rate of 26.8 equalized mills, its local tax collections\n\nwere only $4,011.48 per student. Conversely, Lower Merion School District, at 14.7\n\nequalized mills, collected over $23,000 per student.          Tredyffrin / Easttown School\n\nDistrict, which applied a millage rate substantially less than half that applied by\n\nShenandoah Valley, collected $19,418.38 per student, well over four times Shenandoah\n\nValley’s per-student revenue.       Petitioners document numerous similar disparities\n\nbetween wealthy and low-wealth districts across the Commonwealth.\n\n       Turning to Petitioners’ more specific allegations, the School District of Lancaster\n\nhas eliminated 100 teaching positions and more than twenty administrative positions,\n\nsubstantially increasing the student-teacher ratio throughout the district.           Where\n\nLancaster once employed twenty librarians, it now employs five. In 2011 and 2012,\n\nLancaster imposed a hiring and salary freeze for teachers and other staff. Panther\n\nValley School District has struggled similarly since 2011. The number of elementary\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 23\n\fschool and high school teachers has been reduced by 10%.                All district librarian\n\npositions were eliminated, as were all elementary school technology coach positions.\n\nReductions also have adversely affected Panther Valley’s ability to support its growing\n\npopulation of English language-learning students. Greater Johnstown School District,\n\nwhere an unusually high proportion of students have incarcerated, substance-abusing,\n\nand/or mentally ill family members, also has labored under the burden of reduced\n\nfunding. It has eliminated twenty-five teacher positions, and has an insufficient number\n\nof administrators, counselors, and librarians, with two librarians serving four schools,\n\nresulting in cutbacks to its reading intervention program. The William Penn School\n\nDistrict has eliminated fifty-seven teachers, five administrators, and twelve support staff.\n\nNone of its schools employs a full-time guidance counselor, it has eliminated one\n\nlibrarian position, and in 2011 it eliminated all of its reading specialist positions. Due to\n\nsevere staff reductions, William Penn’s former seven-period schedule has been reduced\n\nto six periods.26\n\n\n\n\n26\n        The story is much the same in the Wilkes-Barre Area and Shenandoah Valley\nSchool Districts. And since 2011, amicus curiae Philadelphia School District has\nreduced the number of principals and assistant principals by 40%; teachers by 33%;\nspecial education teachers by 22%; career and technical education teachers by 37%;\nand counselors, student advisors, and social service liaisons by 54%. Philadelphia\noperates 214 schools serving approximately 131,000 students, but employs only sixty-\nsix music teachers and three full-time-equivalent librarians. The superintendent of the\nPhiladelphia School District, as well as Respondent Department of Education have\ncharacterized the state of public education in Philadelphia as “insufficient and\nunsustainable.” Petition at 82-83 ¶ 200; see id. at 83 ¶ 201 (quoting at length a joint\nfiling of the Philadelphia School District, the School Reform Commission, and the\nDepartment of Education in other litigation describing the “bare-bones” and\n“unsatisfactory” conditions and “woefully inadequate” staffing levels in the Philadelphia\nSchool District).\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 24\n\f       Petitioners further detail reductions in Petitioner School Districts of various\n\neducational programs, including art, physical education, and health education, which,\n\nPetitioners argue, are important to preparing students for “civic, economic, and social\n\nsuccess.” Id. at 85-86 ¶ 204. Schools also have reduced or eliminated vocational\n\nprograms, interventions for struggling and at-risk students, English language-learning\n\nassistance, and programming for gifted students, including advanced placement\n\ncourses. Lancaster has cut summer tutoring programs to non-high school students and\n\nnearly all foreign language education. Only half of students have access to shop and\n\ncomputer classes.      Panther Valley has made similarly dramatic cuts, and also\n\neliminated driver’s education and SAT preparation. Greater Johnstown has been forced\n\nto reduce severely its intervention, remediation, and special education services. Similar\n\nreductions have been required in the Wilkes-Barre Area and William Penn School\n\nDistricts.   These cuts, they allege, have been forced primarily upon economically\n\ndisadvantaged districts, while more prosperous districts have remained largely\n\nunscathed.\n\n       Petitioners also identify severe shortages in classroom materials and equipment,\n\nas well as deteriorating schools.     In the School District of Lancaster, for example,\n\nPetitioners allege that much of the furniture is in need of repair or replacement,\n\nprojectors are non-functioning, and textbooks and computers are severely out of date.\n\nThe roof over Panther Valley’s overcrowded elementary school is in need of repair, and\n\nas a temporary measure to address a shortage of usable space, the district has placed\n\nchildren in twelve modular classrooms. In Greater Johnstown, the roof over the middle\n\nschool’s auditorium is collapsing, plaster is falling from crumbling walls and ceilings, and\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 25\n\fsome bathrooms are in such disrepair that they cannot be used.               Much of the\n\ntechnology in the Wilkes-Barre Area School District is ten or more years old, and that\n\ndistrict’s physical facilities, too, are in poor condition.   In the William Penn School\n\nDistrict, textbooks are so out of date that they do not match Pennsylvania state\n\ncurricular requirements, and high school students may not bring some texts home—\n\nshould they be lost, the school will not be able to replace them. In twenty-three of thirty-\n\ntwo school buildings in Philadelphia surveyed by Philadelphia in partnership with the\n\nHealth and Welfare Fund and the federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health,\n\ninvestigators found dampness, mold, or water damage in more than a third of the\n\nrooms.\n\n       By way of contrast, in the Lower Merion School District, all kindergartners and\n\nfirst-graders have access to iPads, and all high school freshmen are issued laptops to\n\nuse as their own during their high school years.\n\n       Perhaps most importantly, Petitioners allege that certain programs and services\n\nthat disadvantaged districts have been forced to reduce or eliminate are essential to\n\nequip students to meet the proficiency standards imposed by the General Assembly.\n\nTeacher layoffs and concomitant class size increases; reductions in advanced studies\n\nand programs such as art and music, as well as after-school and summer school\n\nprograms for supplemental instruction; the elimination or reduction of teacher education\n\nand development relative to the areas tested; reductions in preschool and early\n\nchildhood programs; out-of-date instructional materials; and the various other\n\ndeficiencies enumerated above all work to prevent disadvantaged school districts from\n\nmeeting the educational standards imposed by the state.\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 26\n\f      Based on the foregoing allegations, Petitioners’ Petition sets forth two counts. In\n\nCount I, Petitioners assert that Respondents have violated their collective constitutional\n\nduty under the Education Clause to “provide for the maintenance and support of a\n\nthorough and efficient system of public education to serve the needs of the\n\nCommonwealth.” PA. CONST. art. III, § 14. In this regard, they allege that Respondents\n\nhave defined the content of an adequate education—i.e., one that will “serve the needs\n\nof the Commonwealth”—by promulgating academic standards assessed by the PSSA\n\nand Keystone exams.27 Petitioners aver that Respondents failed to provide the school\n\ndistricts in question with enough funding to ensure that all students have an opportunity\n\nto receive an adequate education—where funding is measured by the allocations\n\nsuggested by the General Assembly-commissioned costing-out study, and adequacy is\n\ntested by whether the students are prepared to “meet state academic standards” and to\n\nachieve “civic, economic, and social success” beyond school.           Id. at 118 ¶ 304.\n\nPetitioners maintain that the current levels and allocation of school funding “are\n\nirrational, arbitrary, and not reasonably calculated to ensure that all Pennsylvania\n\nschoolchildren have access to an adequate education.”                 Id. at 118 ¶ 305.\n\nConsequently, Petitioners claim, the General Assembly has failed to maintain and\n\nsupport “a thorough and efficient system of public education.”\n\n      In effect, Petitioners posit that Pennsylvania law imposes a threshold obligation\n\nto provide all Pennsylvania students with an “adequate” education, which they define in\n\npart by reference to the very standards imposed by the General Assembly and the\n\nDepartment of Education, and in part by reference to the broader goal of enabling\n\n27\n      See generally 22 Pa.Code §§ 4.1, et seq.\n\n\n\n                                    [J-82-2016] - 27\n\fstudents to “participate meaningfully in the economic, civic, and social activities of our\n\nsociety.” That is to say, while Petitioners rely significantly upon the proposition that the\n\nvery instantiation of elaborate goals and assessment tools by the General Assembly\n\nreflects a legislative effort to define an adequate education against which constitutional\n\nadequacy can be measured, they appeal distinctly to broader notions of what\n\nconstitutes a constitutionally adequate education of a sort that is thorough and efficient.\n\n       In their second count, Petitioners assert that Respondents have violated equal\n\nprotection principles under Article III, Section 32 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. They\n\naver that education is a fundamental right, triggering strict scrutiny of the\n\ndisadvantageous classification reflected in the disparity of educational resources at the\n\ndisposal of low and high-wealth districts. Petitioners do not dispute that a constitutional\n\nschool funding scheme would still enable wealthier districts to provide greater resources\n\nto their students than districts that cannot raise as much money through local taxes.\n\nBut they maintain that the Constitution “imposes a duty on the Commonwealth to ensure\n\nthat all students have the same basic level of educational opportunity,” that is, “the\n\nsame fundamental opportunity to meet academic standards and to obtain an adequate\n\neducation that prepares the student for civil, economic, and social success.” Id. at 119\n\n¶ 308. Petitioners contend that the state charter “prohibits the General Assembly from\n\nirrationally enacting laws that benefit a select few.” Id. at 119 ¶ 309. Petitioners assert\n\nthat many funding methodologies exist that would support the state’s interest in\n\npreserving local control of public education without compromising the ability of students\n\nin low-wealth school districts to obtain an adequate education. By adopting a school\n\nfunding program that discriminates against students living in such districts by denying\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 28\n\fthem an equal opportunity to obtain an adequate education, the General Assembly,\n\naccording to Petitioners, has denied the disadvantaged students equal protection. Id.\n\nat 119-20 ¶¶ 308-311.\n\n      In connection with both counts, Petitioners seek declaratory relief consistent with\n\ntheir allegations regarding Respondents’ respective obligations, and in particular\n\nconcerning the scope of the General Assembly’s mandate under the Education Clause,\n\nas well as permanent injunctive relief directing Respondents to rectify the situation\n\naccordingly.    Petitioners request that the Commonwealth Court retain jurisdiction in\n\norder to ensure Respondents’ compliance.\n\n      Legislative and Executive Respondents each filed preliminary objections in the\n\nnature of a demurrer.

They maintained that\n\nresponsibility for providing a thorough and efficient system of public education is\n\ntextually conferred exclusively upon the legislature and that there are no judicially\n\nmanageable standards for granting relief.

Finally,\n\nRespondents averred that Petitioners’ causes of action were barred by sovereign\n\nimmunity—to the extent they sought mandatory injunctive relief—as well as the\n\nseparation of powers doctrine insofar as Petitioners asked the judicial branch to compel\n\naction by the General Assembly and to subject it to ongoing judicial supervision.29\n\n      D.

As read by the\n\nCommonwealth Court, in Marrero II, this Court held that the Education Clause did not\n\nconfer upon students an individual right to an education of any particular quality.\n\nRather, it imposed an exclusive mandate upon the General Assembly to provide for the\n\naforesaid maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of public\n\neducation.    The Court further maintained that the Education Clause precluded the\n\nGeneral Assembly from establishing any educational policy that future legislatures\n\ncannot change. “[T]he very essence” of the Education Clause, it held, “is to enable\n\nsuccessive legislatures to adopt a changing program to keep abreast of educational\n\nadvances.” William Penn Sch. Dist., 114 A.3d at 462 (quoting Marrero II, 739 A.2d\n\nat 112).     Consequently, it would be equally violative of the Education Clause’s\n\n“essence” for the Court to establish any fixed standard by which to measure\n\nthoroughness and efficiency.     The Marrero II Court thus concluded that “the only\n\njudicially manageable standard this [C]ourt could adopt would be the rigid rule that each\n\npupil must receive the same dollar expenditures,” and, because expenditures per pupil\n\n“are not the exclusive yardstick of educational quality, or even constitutional quantity,”\n\n\n\n\n                                    [J-82-2016] - 31\n\fsuch a standard would offend the historical means and intended ends of the Education\n\nClause. William Penn Sch. Dist., 114 A.3d at 463 (quoting Marrero II, 739 A.2d at 113).\n\nThus, any legislative scheme with “a reasonable relation” to providing “for the\n\nmaintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of public schools” passes\n\nconstitutional muster. Id. (quoting Marrero II, 739 A.2d at 113).\n\n       The Commonwealth Court rejected Petitioners’ attempt to distinguish Danson\n\nand Marrero II on the basis that subsequently-adopted education standards and\n\nassessments, viewed in tandem with the findings of the legislatively-commissioned\n\ncosting-out study, have revealed a judicially discoverable and manageable standard by\n\nwhich to measure constitutional adequacy. Such considerations, the Commonwealth\n\nCourt held, might establish salutary policy-related benchmarks, but they cannot supply a\n\njudicially manageable standard enabling a court to determine whether the Legislature\n\nhas fulfilled its constitutional duties without overstepping its bounds. See id. Thus, as\n\nin Marrero II, that want of judicially manageable standards rendered Petitioners’ claims\n\nnon-justiciable.30\n\n       This appeal followed.     This Court has exclusive jurisdiction over Petitioners’\n\nappeal. See 42 Pa.C.S. § 723(a) (“The Supreme Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction\n\nof appeals from final orders of the Commonwealth Court entered in any matter which\n\nwas originally commenced in the Commonwealth Court.”).\n\nII.

Discussion\n\n       A.     Mootness and Appealability\n\n       As noted, supra n.25, with the enactment of 72 P.S. § 25-2502.53 and related\n\nprovisions (hereinafter, “Act 35”) during the pendency of this appeal, the General\n\nAssembly supplanted the funding formula that applied when Petitioners filed suit. This\n\nnew enactment is the subject of a Supplemental Brief submitted by Governor Tom\n\nWolf,32 to which Petitioners responded in turn. Governor Wolf submits that Act 35 for\n\nthe first time bases allocations on the “objective needs of each district.” Supplemental\n\nBrief of Governor Tom Wolf at 3. Governor Wolf contends that these salutary changes\n\nmilitate in favor of affirmance, but does not argue that the changes moot Petitioners’\n\nclaims.33 The question presented concerns the justiciability of Petitioners’ claims. The\n\nnature of the applicable state formula (which can change any time the legislature\n\nchooses) goes to the correct ruling only if the claims are justiciable in the first instance.\n32\n     We granted Governor Wolf leave to file his brief by per curiam Order of\nSeptember 22, 2016, shortly after we heard oral argument in this matter.\n33\n       We have described the mootness doctrine as follows:\n       [C]ases presenting mootness problems involve litigants who clearly had\n       standing to sue at the outset of the litigation. The problems arise from\n       events occurring after the lawsuit has gotten under way—changes in the\n       facts or in the law—which allegedly deprive the litigant of the necessary\n       stake in the outcome. The mootness doctrine requires that an actual case\n       or controversy must be extant at all stages of review, not merely at the\n       time the complaint is filed.\nPub.

See Robinson Twp., 83 A.3d at 927 n.16. Judicial review stands as a bulwark\n\nagainst unconstitutional or otherwise illegal actions by the two political branches. “It is\n\nemphatically the province and duty of the judicial department,” instructed Chief Justice\n\nJohn Marshall, “to say what the law is.” Marbury v.

At the inception of any action such as the one presented—the public\nimportance of which cannot be disputed—there inheres the risk that the General\nAssembly will move the goalposts by enacting new legislation, a risk that was especially\ntrue under the legislation that applied when Petitioners filed their appeal, when the\nGeneral Assembly had transitioned to an annual funding process from one applying a\nformulaic approach indefinitely or over a designated series of years. In any event, this\nCourt is not asked at this juncture to decide the constitutionality of a particular funding\nformula, but rather whether a claim regarding the constitutionality of any funding formula\nmay be litigated or instead lies entirely outside judicial review.\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 35\n\fassessed nor corrected by judicial intervention. Id. at 164 (“That there may be such\n\ncases is not to be questioned . . . .”). As Chief Justice Marshall allowed, and as the\n\ncenturies have proven, judicial review has its limitations, including those suggested by\n\nwhat has come to be known as the political question doctrine.\n\n       The parameters of the political question doctrine have never been amenable to\n\nprecise definition. In 1955, Justice Felix Frankfurter acknowledged the difficulty that\n\nattends any effort to delineate the scope and application of the doctrine:\n\n       I . . . believe that no judge charged with the duty of enforcing the Due\n       Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, and the Equal\n       Protection of the Laws Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, can free\n       himself from the disquietude that the line is often very thin between the\n       cases in which the Court felt compelled to abstain from adjudication\n       because of their “political” nature, and the cases that so frequently arise in\n       applying the concepts of “liberty” and “equality.”\nFelix Frankfurter, John Marshall and the Judicial Function, 69 HARV. L. REV. 217, 227\n\n(1955).\n\n       Not long after Justice Frankfurter expressed his misgivings, the United States\n\nSupreme Court, confronted with a challenge to state-level efforts to fashion\n\ncongressional districts, distilled the following six-factor test from its prior political\n\nquestion decisions:\n\n       [S]everal formulations which vary slightly according to the settings in\n       which the questions arise may describe a political question, although each\n       has one or more elements which identify it as essentially a function of the\n       separation of powers. Prominent on the surface of any case held to\n       involve a political question is found a textually demonstrable constitutional\n       commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or a lack of\n       judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or the\n       impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind\n       clearly for non-judicial discretion; or the impossibility of a court’s\n       undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect\n       due coordinate branches of government; or an unusual need for\n       unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; or the\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 36\n\f       potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by\n       various departments on one question.\nBaker, 369 U.S. at 217.\n\n       Baker has not appreciably mitigated the difficulty of locating Justice Frankfurter’s\n\n“very thin” line. The Baker Court itself acknowledged that its discussion “require[d]\n\nreview of a number of political question cases, in order to expose the attributes of the\n\ndoctrine—attributes which, in various settings, diverge, combine, appear, and disappear\n\nin seeming disorderliness.” Id. at 210. The Court also made the following observation:\n\n       Much confusion results from the capacity of the ‘political question’ label to\n       obscure the need for case-by-case inquiry. Deciding whether a matter\n       has in any measure been committed by the Constitution to another branch\n       of government . . . is itself a delicate exercise in constitutional\n       interpretation, and is a responsibility of this Court as ultimate interpreter of\n       the Constitution.\nId. at 210-11; accord Nixon v.

Hayden, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3852447\"><a href=\"/opinion/4093024/teachers-tenure-act-cases/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span> <span class=\"page\">344</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Pa. 1938).\n\n       In the Teachers’ Tenure Act Case, this Court confronted teachers’ mandamus\n\nchallenge to the Teachers’ Tenure Act, which affected the contractual relationship\n\nbetween school districts and teachers subject to the Act’s ambit. “In considering laws\n\nrelating to the public school system,” we held, “courts will not inquire into the reason,\n\nwisdom, or expedience of the legislative policy” at issue, but only “whether the\n\nlegislation has a reasonable relation to the purpose expressed in [the Education\n\nClause], and whether the fruits or effects of such legislation impinge on the article by\n\ncircumscribing it, or abridging its exercise by future Legislatures within the field of ‘a\n\nthorough and efficient system of public schools.’” 197 A. at 352. Far from imposing a\n\nfixed standard upon the General Assembly, we observed, the Education Clause was\n\ndesigned “to enable successive Legislatures to adopt a changing program to keep\n\nabreast of educational advances. The people have directed that the cause of public\n\neducation . . . must evolute or retrograde with succeeding generations as the times\n\nprescribe.” Id. Thus, all matters bearing upon education, from employment contracts to\n\n“legislative determinations of school policy or the scope of educational activity, . . . must\n\nat all times be subject to future legislative control.” Id. If the General Assembly does\n\nnot retain such freedom, we held, “we will not have a thorough and efficient system of\n\npublic schools.” Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 42\n\f       It is important to note that, in that case, this Court considered whether the\n\nTeachers’ Tenure Act would preclude or interfere with future legislatures’ freedom to\n\nrefine and innovate education policy, thus confounding the Education Clause’s inferred\n\npurpose to afford the General Assembly precisely such latitude. That is to say, we\n\nasked whether the incumbent General Assembly at the time had prospectively infringed\n\nthe prerogative of successor legislatures. To the contrary, we found that the General\n\nAssembly’s modification of the pre-existing teacher contracts was an exercise of the\n\nlegislature’s freedom to innovate and adjust education policy, noting as well that “a\n\nsubsequent Legislature may abolish [the Teachers’ Tenure Act,] in toto, if it deems it\n\nnecessary to do so.” Id. at 353.38\n\n       Notably, we did not specifically decline to decide the constitutional challenge as a\n\npolitical question.   Rather, we measured the challenged legislation against the\n\nEducation Clause substantively without any express reservation about our authority to\n\ndo so. In adopting and applying the “reasonable relation” test, this Court assumed a\n\ndeferential posture toward the General Assembly’s efforts, reflecting the judicial restraint\n\n\n38\n        Inasmuch as this responded implicitly to the suggestion that the General\nAssembly might ever pass a statute concerning education that interfered with its own\nability to later repeal or modify that statute, or otherwise change education policy by\nlegislative action, it flirts with incoherence. Unlike the United States Congress, the\nPennsylvania General Assembly is not limited to specifically enumerated powers.\nRather, it may legislate in any way that is not expressly forbidden by the Pennsylvania\nor United States Constitution.         Compare U.S. CONST. art. I, § 8 (enumerating\nCongressional prerogatives), with Russ v. Commonwealth, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span> <span class=\"page\">169</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 172 (Pa. 1905)\n(quoting Norris v.

Thus, if the question is whether the General Assembly has authority to\nlegislate in the education arena, the answer is “Yes” in virtually every circumstance,\nprovided it stays within constitutional bounds.\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 43\n\fostensibly necessary to preserve free legislative development of education policy.\n\nHowever, in underscoring that any successor legislature would be free to amend or\n\nrepeal the Teachers’ Tenure Act, the Court spoke forcefully against the government’s\n\nprerogative to “bargain[] away or fetter[]” education, and emphasized that no laws, or\n\n“legislative incursions,” can be permitted to “destroy” the underlying constitutional\n\npurpose. Id. The Court thus implied that there was a body competent to ensure that\n\nsuch abuses did not happen. By its reference to “legislative incursions,” the Court\n\nconfounded any suggestion that the General Assembly itself could be that body.\n\nStructurally, only courts might police such legislative “incursions” upon the constitutional\n\nmandate.\n\n       Nearly a half-century later, in Danson v.

Plaintiffs sought\n\ninjunctive relief based upon alleged violations of the Education Clause and equal\n\nprotection principles enshrined by Article III Section 32.39 Petitioners challenged the\n\nCommonwealth’s failure to supplement the Philadelphia School District’s budget so as\n\nto “furnish the children of Philadelphia . . . with a normal program of full educational\n\nservices” or to ensure that “the programs of educational services . . . are substantially\n\nuniform throughout all the school districts of the state.” Id. at 362-63.\n\n\n\n39\n       See supra n.3.\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 44\n\f       This Court first reviewed the prevailing formula by which state funds were\n\ndistributed to school districts statewide, a formula that, like the current one, sought to\n\nameliorate the hardships faced by economically disadvantaged districts. State funding\n\nnotwithstanding, in fact and by design, local revenue sources remained the major\n\nsource of school financing, just as they are now. Id. at 363-64. Notwithstanding the\n\nGeneral Assembly’s partial mitigation of the differences in resources produced by\n\nschool districts’ heavy reliance upon highly variable local tax policies and tax bases,\n\nplaintiffs argued that the legislative formula was insufficient to satisfy the Education\n\nClause’s mandate.\n\n       “More than forty years ago,” we observed in Danson, the Court “recognized [in\n\nthe Teachers’ Tenure Act Case], that because educational philosophy and needs\n\nchange constantly, the words ‘thorough and efficient’ must not be narrowly construed.”\n\nId. at 366. Reaffirming that the Education Clause must “enable successive legislatures\n\nto adopt a changing program to keep abreast of educational advances,” id. (quoting the\n\nTeachers’ Tenure Act Case, 197 A. at 352), we held that “[i]t would be . . . contrary to\n\nthe ‘essence’ of the Constitutional provision for this Court to bind future Legislatures and\n\nschool boards to a present judicial review of a constitutionally required ‘normal’ program\n\nof educational services.” Id. The Court then fashioned of whole cloth the hypothesis\n\nthat the only way we might “attempt to define the specific components of a ‘thorough\n\nand efficient [system of] education’” in a “judicially manageable” fashion would be to\n\nimpose “the rigid rule that each pupil must receive the same dollar expenditures.” Id.\n\nWe noted that the framers of the 1874 Constitution, in which the Education Clause first\n\nappeared with the requirement of thoroughness and efficiency, specifically considered\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 45\n\fand rejected any suggestion that Pennsylvania’s system of public education should be\n\nuniform, instead endorsing “local control to meet diverse local needs” and recognizing\n\n“the right of local communities to utilize local tax revenues to expand educational\n\nprograms subsidized by the state.”       Id. at 366-67.40    Thus, echoing the Teachers’\n\n\n40\n       The relationship of school funding and local control is often cited by defenders of\nhybrid school funding schemes that result in significant district-by-district disparities.\nNumerous courts and commentators have observed that this relationship is typically\nconclusory in its presentation, and disregards the limitations on local prerogatives\ncaused by a paucity of financial resources. The school funding disparities defended by\nresort to local control in practice disserve that end as to many districts. To cite just one\nexample, the Supreme Court of Arkansas has observed as follows:\n       Those jurisdictions finding no equal protection violation in a system based\n       on district wealth generally uphold the system of funding by finding a\n       legitimate state purpose in maintaining local control. We find however,\n       two fallacies in this reasoning. First, to alter the state financing system to\n       provide greater equalization among districts does not in any way dictate\n       that local control must be reduced. Second, as pointed out in Serrano v.\n       Priest, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1148513\"><a href=\"/opinion/1148513/serrano-v-priest/\"><span class=\"volume\">557</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">929</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 948 (Cal. 1976), “The notion of local control was a\n       ‘cruel illusion’ for the poor districts due to limitations placed upon them by\n       the system itself. . . . Far from being necessary to promote local fiscal\n       choice, the present system actually deprives the less wealthy districts of\n       the option.”\nDupree v. Alma, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1772589\"><a href=\"/opinion/1772589/dupree-v-alma-school-dist-no-30/\"><span class=\"volume\">651</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 93 (Ark. 1983). Furthermore, recitations of the need\nfor local control cannot relieve the General Assembly of its exclusive obligation under\nthe Education Clause. Regardless of how it balances the minimal education that the\nConstitution requires to be provided to all students with the limitations inherent in local\ncontrol and funding (and, again, to suggest that those two are inextricable is\ntendentious), the General Assembly alone must be held accountable, regardless of\nwhether one perceives the cause of the actionable deficiency to exist at the local or\nstate level. Thus, in Smith v. School District of Upper Darby Township, we held that\n“[t]he Constitution of 1874 . . . directed the Legislature to maintain a ‘thorough and\nefficient system of public schools’ . . . .

Because the funding framework there at issue was neutral with respect to\n\nthe Philadelphia School District and because it provided that district with “its fair share”\n\nof state subsidies, we concluded that the funding scheme was reasonably related “to\n\nmaintenance and support of a system of public education” and thus did not violate the\n\nEducation Clause.

The Commonwealth Court determined that\n\nthe financing scheme enacted by the General Assembly was reasonably related to its\n\nconstitutional mandate and was neutral with regard to the district, providing that district\n\nwith a “fair share” of state subsidies. Consequently, the legislative scheme did not\n\nviolate the Education Clause.     Having so declared, the Commonwealth Court then\n\ncircled back to observe, in the same terminology applied in the Teachers’ Tenure Act\n\nCase, that it would “not inquire into the reason, wisdom, or expediency of the legislative\n\npolicy with regard to education, nor any matters relating to legislative determinations of\n\nschool policy or the scope of educational activity.” Id. at 965. Thus, in Marrero I, as in\n\nDanson, and unlike in the Teachers’ Tenure Act Case upon which both decisions\n\npurported to rely, the court deemed the question non-justiciable, even as it utilized\n\nlanguage suggesting its review and rejection of the underlying challenge on the merits.\n\nMarrero I, 709 A.2d at 965-66.\n\n       The Teachers’ Tenure Act Case, Danson, and Marrero II necessarily inform our\n\nconsideration regarding the justiciability of Petitioners’ Education Clause and equal\n\nprotection claims. But to rely uncritically upon their analyses and holdings would be to\n\nrest our decision upon an unstable three-legged stool. The account above makes clear\n\njust how little weight that stool can bear. The first of these three cases assessed\n\nlegislative discretion alone, implicitly and necessarily treating a claimed violation of the\n\nEducation Clause as justiciable. The Teachers’ Tenure Act Case can be construed\n\neither as establishing a standard of review by which to review Education Clause\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 51\n\fchallenges, in the form of the reasonable relation test, or as one cursorily dismissing\n\nplaintiffs’ claim upon the strength of future legislatures’ discretion to modify education\n\npolicy. In fact, that future legislative discretion was not impaired by the Act in question,\n\ngiven that the Act could be repealed or amended at any time. Then, in Danson, the\n\nCourt seemed to vindicate deferential merits review in its recitation and apparent\n\napplication of the reasonable relation standard, only to follow that with what appeared to\n\nbe a determination that the challenge was not justiciable. The Court based this pivot\n\nupon the manifestly debatable premises that: (a) the only judicially discoverable and\n\nmanageable standard for resolving such a challenge would be to require equal per\n\ncapita expenditures statewide; and (b) the imposition of any judicially-defined standard\n\nwhatsoever necessarily would preclude the General Assembly’s continued salutary\n\nexperimentation with education policy.      Then came Marrero I and II, wherein the\n\nCommonwealth Court, and then this Court, adopted Danson wholesale, warts and all,\n\nagain applying the political question doctrine and reasonable relationship test\n\nsimultaneously—and irreconcilably.\n\n       For what little developed reasoning there is to be gleaned from our prior three\n\ncases, we must conclude that the slate relative to the instant challenges is, if not clean,\n\nthen at least relatively unadorned by any harmonious rule of law that controls the instant\n\nmatter. Thus, in addressing Petitioners’ claims in this case, we must consider anew the\n\nBaker factors as to each claim.\n\n       D.     Justiciability and the Education Clause\n\n       In evaluating the factors and their application to Petitioners’ Education Clause\n\nclaim, we focus upon the first three factors: a textually demonstrable commitment to the\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 52\n\fGeneral Assembly, a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards, 46 and\n\nan inability to decide the question without an initial policy determination not appropriate\n\nfor judicial discretion. These three factors are closely interrelated.47\n\n              1.     Textual Commitment\n\n       With regard to the textual commitment factor, Sweeney and Robinson Township,\n\ninter alia, have made clear that mere textual commitment of a given function to a given\n\nbranch of government does not by itself preclude judicial review. See, e.g., Robinson\n\nTwp., 83 A.3d at 928 (“Courts will refrain from resolving a dispute and reviewing the\n\nactions of another branch only where the determination whether the action taken is\n\nwithin the power granted by the Constitution has been entrusted exclusively and finally\n\nto the political branches of government for self-monitoring.”) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). Thus, there must be some indication that vested within the Education Clause\n\nmandate is the obligation and prerogative to “self-monitor.” That the mandate charges\n\nthe General Assembly with maintaining and supporting “a thorough and efficient system\n\nof public education” by no means implies that the legislature’s efforts at doing so may\n\n46\n       The Nixon Court observed that the “textually demonstrable constitutional\ncommitment” and “judicially discoverable and manageable standards” factors under\nBaker “are not completely separate; the lack of judicially manageable standards may\nstrengthen the conclusion that there is a textually demonstrable commitment to a\ncoordinate branch.” Nixon, 506 U.S. at 228-29; see id. at 240 (White, J., concurring)\n(“[C]ourts are sometimes aided by textual evidence that the Judiciary was not meant to\nexercise judicial review—a coordinate inquiry expressed in Baker’s ‘lack of judicially\ndiscoverable and manageable standards’ criterion.”).\n47\n       Like the parties, the following three factors we find immaterial to the instant case:\nan inability to resolve the issue without expressing a lack of respect for the coordinate\nbranches of government, an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political\ndecision already made, and “the potential for embarrassment from multifarious\npronouncements by various departments on one question.” Robinson Twp., 83 A.3d\nat 928.\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 53\n\fbe graded exclusively by that body without judicial recourse. We find no evidence from\n\nwhich to draw such a broad conclusion when it is antithetical to our prior stringent\n\naccounts of the textual commitment factor in Sweeney, Robinson Township, and other\n\ncases. This is especially so in light of the well-documented suspicion with which the\n\nframers of the 1874 Constitution viewed legislative overreach.48          Thus, any such\n\nimplication must lie in the close relationship between the textual commitment factor and\n\nthe lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards factor that has been\n\nrecognized in the past. See Nixon, 506 U.S. at 228-29.\n\n              2.

They argue forthrightly that Marrero II should be\nreconsidered and perhaps overruled. Executive Branch Respondents underscore that\nPetitioners have not taken that strong of a position.

Thus, they effectively contend that Petitioners’ failure to make a\nfrontal attack upon our prior Education Clause case law forecloses this Court’s ability to\nconsider in this case the soundness and viability of our earlier decisions.\n       Respondents are correct to the extent that the question of the ongoing tenability\nof Danson, Marrero II, and the cases upon which they were based is not expressed in\nthe questions as to which we granted review, both of which inquire as to the justiciability\nof Petitioners’ claims. In reviewing those decisions, though, our final determination as\nto whether and how they apply to this case requires us to consider their internal\nconsistency as well as the cogency of their reasoning. Put another way, if, in seeking to\nharmonize these cases and apply them to the case before us, we find that we cannot do\nso with due rigor, we cannot look the other way simply because to abrogate prior\nprecedent in the process of resolving this case is more than Petitioners have asked us\n(continued…)\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 54\n\fcurricular mandates, in tandem with elaborate student assessment and school\n\naccountability measures, reflect a sea change in the legislative imposition of standards.\n\nSpecifically, the advent of the modern era of Common Core curricula and elaborate\n\ntools for assessing educational success, such as the PSSA and Keystone Exams,\n\ncontradict any argument that there are no judicially enforceable standards that might\n\napply to test the General Assembly’s satisfaction of its mandate. And because a court\n\ncan rely upon standards already established by the legislature to make a circumstance-\n\nspecific determination of educational adequacy without fashioning a fixed baseline\n\nstandard out of whole cloth, judicial oversight does not require an intrusion upon the\n\nGeneral Assembly’s policy-making function. Petitioners explain as follows:\n\n       After defining what children should learn in school (and imposing\n       significant consequences on those who fall short), the legislature has a\n       duty under the Education Clause to provide funding sufficient to ensure\n       that all students are given an opportunity to actually learn it. That duty\n       flows from the plain language of the Education Clause . . . . The\n       legislature’s current definition of a “thorough and efficient system of public\n       education”—as related in state academic standards and other legislative\n       enactments—thus defines the scope of its financial support obligations. In\n       other words, the Constitution requires the legislature to maintain and\n       support the system that the legislature itself has mandated.\nBrief for Petitioners at 33-34.\n\n       Petitioners reinforce this line of reasoning by reviewing other state courts that\n\nhave applied it in reviewing (on the merits) legislative compliance with their respective\n\n(…continued)\nto do.

Petitioners acknowledge that some school districts may have poor\n\ntest results due to “local mismanagement or ineffective teachers,” even where the\n\nGeneral Assembly has allocated the resources necessary to provide the education that\n\nthe legislature itself has demanded. But Petitioners underscore that this is distinct from\n\njudicially assessing the alleged systemic inability of many school districts to satisfy\n\nlegislative standards given their limited resources, an infirmity curable only with greater\n\nstate assistance, given certain districts’ limited property tax bases and taxing authority.\n\nBy way of reinforcement, Petitioners review their pleading’s allegations and recite a\n\nseries of “abysmal” performance numbers50 from various school districts.

They\n\ncontend that, while the General Assembly effectively has defined an “adequate”\n\neducation either through, or at least by inference from, the various performance\n\nstandards it has imposed upon school districts, it also has access (as do the courts) to\n\nits own district-by-district costing-out study.

Petitioners suggest that no such policy judgment need be\n\nmade in assessing the adequacy of the resources dedicated by the General Assembly\n\nto support fulfillment of objectives delineated by that selfsame body. Petitioners close\n\nby reviewing various decisions from other jurisdictions in which courts “crafted effective\n\nand noninvasive remedies to address education clause violations.” Id. at 41-43. In light\n\nof these developments over the past twenty years, Petitioners argue that it is\n\nincongruous for Respondents now to maintain that it is impossible for a court to fashion\n\na constitutional threshold for educational adequacy.\n\n      Respondents reply that it would be unreasonable to take a snapshot of legislative\n\nstandards at a moment in time and confer constitutional status upon that snapshot.\n\nThey suggest that, at any given moment, the legislature may be doing far more than any\n\nreasonable interpretation of the Constitution would require, implicitly arguing that the\n\nGeneral Assembly should retain latitude to do less. Respondents further argue that to\n\nadopt a fixed constitutional standard based upon any particular suite of benchmarks\n\nimposed by the General Assembly limits the legislative freedom to experiment with\n\neducation policy in response to changing needs and innovations. The necessity of this\n\nfreedom is precisely the one unequivocal proposition that may reasonably be inferred\n\nfrom the Teachers’ Tenure Act Case, Danson, and Marrero II. Alternatively, if a court\n\nwas to enshrine the standards of the moment as the constitutional threshold, but leave\n\n\n\n\n                                    [J-82-2016] - 57\n\fopen the door to future legislative changes with the expectation that those standards\n\nthen would become constitutional, such a holding would render our own rulings merely\n\nperfunctory.   More perniciously, Respondents say, the General Assembly might be\n\nencouraged to lower standards simply to deflect whatever judicial oversight might\n\nremain, enshrining utter and de facto legislative prerogative without acknowledging it as\n\nsuch.51\n\n       Respondents then adopt the dubious premise accepted without material\n\nexplanation by the Danson and Marrero II Courts that financial equalization offers the\n\nonly judicially manageable standard. To impose such a standard would confound the\n\nconstitutional design in numerous particulars. First, it would contradict the framers’\n\nspecific consideration and rejection of a uniformity requirement.        Second, it would\n\nundermine the enduring emphasis on local prerogatives that long has animated\n\neducation policy in the Commonwealth and elsewhere.52\n\n       It is true that Petitioners lean heavily upon the strict academic standards\n\nembodied in the General Assembly’s measures of educational success, without\n\n\n51\n        Respondents’ argument that the General Assembly alone has authority to\nmonitor its own compliance with the Education Clause renders this argument hollow. If\nRespondents prevail, the General Assembly would be free to defund education entirely\nwithout the interference of any other branch of government, subject only to the\nvicissitudes of the next election cycle. Accordingly, nothing this or any other court does\nwill increase the chance of the proverbial race to the bottom. On the Respondents’ own\naccount, the General Assembly can race to the bottom whenever it chooses for all\nanyone else can do to interfere.\n52\n       Presumably, given finite state resources, equalization of expenditures could be\nachieved only by capping what wealthier districts could spend on their schools. This is\nprecisely what Justice Manderino disputed when he disagreed with the Danson majority\nthat petitioners in that case sought any particular amount of funding for all districts as a\nproxy for educational adequacy. See supra n.44.\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 58\n\fexpressly allowing that the constitutional threshold found by a court might lie\n\nsomewhere below that level or be differently described. See Petition at 120-21 ¶¶ 313-\n\n14, 320-21 (seeking a court order directing, inter alia, that the General Assembly\n\nestablish a “school[ ]financing arrangement that is reasonably calculated to ensure that\n\nall students in Pennsylvania have an opportunity to obtain an adequate education that\n\nwill enable them to meet state academic standards”). It is reasonable to maintain that\n\nthese measures necessarily are mutable, and are ill-suited, as such, to serve as a\n\nconstitutional minimum now or in the future. Nonetheless, Petitioners also request relief\n\naimed at a more general purpose: a declaration that the General Assembly must\n\nprovide the “support necessary to ensure that all students have the opportunity to obtain\n\nan adequate education that will enable them to . . . participate meaningfully in the\n\neconomic, civic, and social activities of our society.” Id. at 120-21 ¶ 314.53 This is\n\ndistinct from Petitioners’ parallel prayers for the relief they seek in explicitly financial\n\nterms or in terms of the curricular mandates of the moment. That is to say, Petitioners’\n\nreliance upon today’s statutory or regulatory standards, or any particular standardized\n\ntesting measures, is by no means exclusive.\n\n       Even when Petitioners speak in financial terms, they do not conjure the straw\n\nman of funding equality or fixed standards so critical to this Court’s reasoning in Danson\n\nand Marrero II.    To the contrary, they posit that there exists a threshold level of\n\n“adequacy” that is a condition precedent to systemic thoroughness and efficiency in the\n\n\n53\n       See Petition at 122 ¶ 320 (seeking permanent injunctive relief directing the\nCommonwealth to “establish, fund, and maintain a thorough and efficient system of\npublic education that provides all students in Pennsylvania with an equal opportunity to\nobtain an adequate education”).\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 59\n\fconstitutionally-intended sense for which the General Assembly is responsible.\n\nConsonantly, Petitioners never dispute that individual districts should be free to utilize\n\nlocal funding sources to elevate their standards above the constitutional floor.\n\nAccordingly, we will not impute to Petitioners the desire for funding equality that, once\n\nposited, necessarily short-circuits an appropriately rigorous discussion of how courts\n\nmight ensure that the Education Clause is more than merely hortatory without unduly\n\ninfringing legislative prerogatives.\n\n       If we accept Respondents’ framing, the question of standards answers itself.\n\nSurely, it cannot be correct that we simply constitutionalize whatever standards the\n\nGeneral Assembly relies upon at a moment in time, and then fix those as the\n\nconstitutional minimum moving forward, if only because at that point our oversight\n\nfunction would be merely symbolic. But we must remember that the question presented\n\nis not what standard a court might employ in assessing the General Assembly’s\n\nsatisfaction of its mandate, but whether any conceivable judicially enforceable standard\n\nmight be formulated and applied after the development of an adequate record\n\nconsisting of an array of proposals as to how a court might fairly assess thoroughness\n\nand efficiency.54 That Petitioners focus upon the web of standards presently imposed\n\n\n54\n        Whatever definition of thoroughness and efficiency further study might\nrecommend, one must bear in mind the broad array of deficiencies alleged by\nPetitioners. See Petition at 72-105 (averring, inter alia, teacher shortages and\nclassroom overcrowding, crumbling infrastructure, unavailability of the most basic of\nlearning materials, and so on). It is incorrect to suggest that these reduce to nothing\nmore than a prayer for more money.

Their methods of doing so, the standards and rigor they\n\nemploy, and the degree of their deference to legislative determinations vary, as do the\n\nresults of the cases they have considered. That a case is entertained on the merits\n\nhardly guarantees victory for either side. But it cannot be said that the inability to\n\nfashion a tidy, mechanical standard of review for such challenges has prompted many\n\nother states to abandon their judicial function.\n\n       Respondents argue, in effect, that this Court cannot define thoroughness and\n\nefficiency while still respecting the legislature’s primacy in fashioning educational policy\n\nand preserving its ongoing flexibility to refine that policy to reflect pedagogical advances\n\nand to adapt to changing times and evolving needs. But centuries of litigation leading to\n\njudicially enforceable definitions of such vague terms as “probable cause,” “due\n\nprocess,” “equal protection,” and “cruel and unusual punishment” undermine the\n\nargument. Courts give meaning routinely to all manner of amorphous constitutional\n\nconcepts, including those that lie at the intersection of legislative prerogative and judicial\n\nreview. And they do so while still leaving room for future development by whatever\n\ngovernment body or mechanism the law fairly prescribes. Nor is this a phenomenon\n\nreserved for fundamental rights. The United States Supreme Court has given judicial\n\nmeaning to such nebulous terms as “interstate commerce.” Cf.

Recently, in Robinson Township, we rejected a\n\njusticiability challenge to claims that certain legislative actions failed to pay due regard\n\nto Article I, Section 27 of our Constitution, commonly referred to as the Environmental\n\nRights Amendment. There, we were called upon to give enforceable meaning to terms\n\nlike “clean air [and] pure water,” “preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and\n\nesthetic values of the environment,” and “natural resources,” and we undertook to\n\ndelineate how the Commonwealth might satisfy its mandate to “conserve and maintain\n\n[these natural resources] for the benefit of all the people.” See Robinson Twp., 83 A.3d\n\nat 969 (Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court).63 We rejected the suggestion\n\nthat the question was so political as to remove it from our purview. Surely, these terms\n\nare no more amenable to precise definition and mechanical application than a “thorough\n\nand efficient system of public education.”\n\n        We must at times return a case to a legislative body for further action with only a\n\nbroadly-stated mandate to serve as guidance.          This was the effective outcome in\n\n63\n       Noting the dearth of jurisprudence interpreting the Environmental Rights\nAmendment, a plurality of justices in Robinson Township emphasized that, nonetheless,\n“this Court has an obligation to vindicate the rights of its citizens . . . in accordance with\nthe plain language of the constitution.” Robinson Twp., 83 A.3d at 969.

We do not take at face value Petitioners’ attempt to constitutionalize the\n\nstandards of the day. But we agree with the broader proposition—long accepted by\n\ndozens of our sister courts—that it is feasible for a court to give meaning and force to\n\nthe language of a constitutional mandate to furnish education of a specified quality, in\n\nthis case “thorough and efficient,” without trammeling the legislature in derogation of the\n\nseparation of powers. This, of course, does not suggest that Petitioners’ claims, or\n\nthose of any future litigant, should or will prevail. The parties have had no opportunity to\n\ndevelop the historic record concerning what, precisely, thoroughness and efficiency\n\nwere intended to entail, nor have they had an opportunity to develop a record enabling\n\nassessment of the adequacy of the current funding scheme relative to any particular\n\naccount of the Constitution’s meaning.

Hence, we may consider them together. Section 32 embodies the\n\nprinciple that “like persons in like circumstances should be treated similarly by the\n\nsovereign.” Robinson Twp., 83 A.3d at 987.\n\n       Under a typical [equal protection] analysis of governmental classifications,\n       there are three different types of classifications calling for three different\n       standards of judicial review. The first type—classifications implicating\n       neither suspect classes nor fundamental rights—will be sustained if it\n       meets a “rational basis” test. In the second type of case[], where a\n       suspect classification has been made or a fundamental right has been\n       burdened, another standard of review is applied: that of strict scrutiny.\n       Finally, in the third type of cases, if “important,” though not fundamental\n       rights are affected by the classification, or if “sensitive” classifications have\n       been made, the United States Supreme Court has employed what may be\n       called an intermediate standard of review, or a heightened standard of\n       review.\nJames, 477 A.2d at 1305-1306. When applicable, strict scrutiny under equal protection\n\nrequires the court to determine whether the classification is necessary to advance a\n\ncompelling state interest. D.P. v. G.J.P., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">204</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 210 (Pa. 2016). If the rational\n\nbasis test applies, then the classification in question must be “reasonable rather than\n\narbitrary and bear a reasonable relationship to the object of the legislation.[ 64] In other\n\nwords, a classification must rest upon some ground of difference which justifies the\n\nclassification and have a fair and substantial relationship to the object of the legislation.”\n\nAlbert, 758 A.2d at 1151 (citation omitted). Since Petitioners undisputedly do not claim\n\nto comprise a class historically recognized as “suspect” under the United States or\n\nPennsylvania Constitutions, they are entitled to elevated scrutiny only if they establish\n\n\n64\n       It is not lost on this Court that this “reasonable relationship” terminology closely\ntracks that of the “reasonable relation” test invoked, if opaquely employed, by this Court\nin the Teachers’ Tenure Act Case, Danson, and Marrero II.\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 74\n\fthat they have an important or fundamental right to education. Failing that, Petitioners\n\nwill prevail on their equal protection claim only if they establish that the school financing\n\nlegislation has no rational basis for the classification it utilizes in allocating funds at the\n\ndistrict level.\n\n        Although it did not do so in clear terms, it is difficult to understand the\n\nCommonwealth Court’s conclusory rejection of Petitioner’s equal protection claim as\n\nrelying upon anything other than this Court’s approach in Danson, in which we\n\nuncritically linked the plaintiff’s equal protection claim to the Education Clause. To that\n\nextent, the Commonwealth Court’s ruling in this case suffers from the same faults that\n\nhave led us to identify little of precedential value in Danson.                  Indeed, the\n\nCommonwealth Court’s disposition of the equal protection claim in the instant case\n\ndepends so completely upon the outcome of the Education Clause claim that we could\n\nsimply remand with direction that it consider that issue in light of our ruling with regard\n\nto the Education Clause. However, because we think it wrong to conflate Petitioners’\n\nequal protection claim with their Education Clause claims, we think it prudent to discuss\n\ntheir justiciability independently.\n\n        Despite some inevitable degree of overlap, Petitioners’ pleading establishes the\n\nindependence of their equal protection claim from their Education Clause claim. For\n\nexample, Petitioners allege classifications by which even with the benefit of a relatively\n\nhigher share of state funding some districts still have radically less to spend on their\n\nstudents than other districts that also receive state funding, albeit in smaller measure.\n\nAnd it is the classifications, not the absolute amounts, that form the basis of Petitioners’\n\nclaims. See Petition at 5 ¶ 7 (“[T]he very low levels of state funding and unusually high\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 75\n\fdependence on local taxes under the current financing arrangement have created gross\n\nfunding disparities among school districts—an asymmetry that disproportionately harms\n\nchildren residing in districts with low property values and incomes.”), 5 ¶ 8 (noting that\n\n“total education expenditures per student now range from as little as $9,800 per student\n\nin school districts with low property values and incomes to more than $28,400 per\n\nstudent in districts with high property values and incomes,” an “unconscionable and\n\nirrational funding disparity [that] violates the Equal Protection Clause”); 32 ¶ 94 (“A\n\nschool financing arrangement that denies children residing in school districts with low\n\nproperty values and incomes the opportunity to obtain an adequate education, while\n\nproviding sufficient resources to children in school districts with high property values\n\nand incomes, is unconstitutional.” (emphasis added)). Further, as set forth at length,\n\nsupra, even setting aside entirely the question of money, Petitioners assert myriad\n\ndeficiencies in facilities and educational materials, staffing, programming, and so on that\n\nare not specifically couched in terms of funding, and that conceivably could be rectified\n\nby means other than increasing monetary allocations to the districts in question.\n\n       In alleging the Commonwealth’s failure “to finance the Commonwealth’s public\n\neducation system in a manner that does not irrationally discriminate against a class of\n\nchildren,” id. at 2 ¶ 1 (emphasis added), it is clear that it is the manner of distribution,\n\nnot the quantum of financial resources distributed, that drives this claim. Moreover,\n\nPetitioners’ prayer for relief reinforces the distinction between their equal protection and\n\nEducation Clause arguments. See, e.g., id. at 8 ¶ 13 (seeking an injunction compelling\n\nthe legislature to halt any funding arrangement that “irrationally discriminates against\n\nchildren who live in school districts with low property values and incomes”); 121 ¶ 316\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 76\n\f(seeking a declaration that equal protection “imposes upon Respondents an obligation\n\nto adopt a school[ ]financing arrangement that does not discriminate against students\n\nbased on the amount of incomes and taxable property in their school districts”). In\n\nshort, Petitioners’ equal protection claims focus upon “the method by which education\n\nfunds are raised and distributed—not the overall amount of funding.”              Brief for\n\nPetitioners at 26 (emphasis in original).65 Thus, the Commonwealth Court erred to the\n\nextent that it determined that the fate of Petitioners’ equal protection claims necessarily\n\nis tied to that of their Education Clause claims.\n\n       Treating Petitioners’ equal protection claims as distinct leaves us with little basis\n\nupon which to deem them non-justiciable. On the question of justiciability, Respondents\n\nprimarily rely upon the proposition that the fate of Petitioners’ Education Clause claims\n\ndictates the fate of their equal protection claims.      But our determination that the\n\nEducation Clause claims are justiciable is fatal to that argument.\n\n       Application of the Baker factors does not suggest a different result.66 To the\n\nextent that Petitioners’ equal protection claim is tied to their Education Clause claim, the\n\nforegoing analysis governs, and the equal protection claim is justiciable. But treating\n\nthe claims separately, we find no analysis by the Commonwealth Court, no argument by\n\nRespondents, nor anything in law to suggest how Petitioners’ equal protection claim\n\ndoes not survive Baker scrutiny. If the Education Clause does not textually repose in\n\nthe General Assembly the authority to self-monitor and self-validate its compliance with\n\n65\n       To the extent that their Petition read as a whole creates any ambiguity on this\npoint, we emphasize that it is our obligation to read the Petition in the light most\nfavorable to Petitioners’ claims.\n66\n       The parties once again focus upon the first three Baker factors. See supra n.47.\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 77\n\fthat provision, certainly Article III, Section 32 does not do so, and no one suggests\n\notherwise.    Furthermore, there is little question that the rational basis/heightened\n\nscrutiny/strict scrutiny rubric that applies to equal protection claims is, by its very nature,\n\na judicially discoverable and manageable standard, and one that does not require a\n\npolicy determination that properly belongs to the legislature.\n\n       Of course, there is no question that, in addressing the latter two Baker concerns,\n\nthe substance of the underlying legal issue informs the question of standards—the very\n\nphrase “equal protection of the law” presupposes some other law that must be applied\n\nequally to similarly situated parties. But in that sense, we find ourselves confronting our\n\nruling as to the justiciability of the Education Clause claim, which leads to the same\n\nresult in this instance. All of which is to say, our foregoing ruling effectively compels us\n\nto determine that Petitioners’ equal protection claim is justiciable in the general sense.\n\nNeither the lower court nor Respondents suggest otherwise. Even if that were not the\n\ncase, Petitioners’ allegations raise the sort of equal protection questions that we nearly\n\nalways treat as justiciable: Whether there exists a classification; whether it is suspect or\n\nsubject to heightened scrutiny; whether it burdens a fundamental right; and whether the\n\nlaw is appropriately fashioned relative to the applicable standard of review. These are\n\nall commonplace inquiries in the courts, and involve neither undiscoverable nor\n\nunmanageable standards. Nor do they implicate initial policy considerations best left to\n\nthe legislature. Rather, the court measures the legislature’s initial policy consideration\n\nagainst a familiar, time-honored rubric that courts have applied on innumerable\n\noccasions.\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-82-2016] - 78\n\f       In rebutting the existence of an individual right to education, Respondents rely in\n\npart on the United States Supreme Court’s decision in San Antonio Independent School\n\nDistrict v. Rodriguez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108751\"><a href=\"/opinion/108751/san-antonio-independent-school-dist-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1973).       There, the Court faced a federal Equal\n\nProtection Clause challenge to the system by which Texas distributed state education\n\nfunding, a challenge substantively quite similar to the claim at issue in the instant case.\n\nThe Court ruled adversely to the plaintiffs in part based upon its determination that there\n\nis no right to education to be found in the United States Constitution.         That was a\n\nconsequence of the United States Constitution’s conspicuous and complete silence on\n\nthe very topic of education. This renders the High Court’s determination on the question\n\nof an individual right immaterial to the Pennsylvania Constitution, which, obviously, is\n\nnot at all silent on the topic. What is important to note in connection with this claim,\n\nhowever, is that the Court, as bound by Baker and its progeny as we are, did not find\n\nthe challenge non-justiciable as a political question. Rather, the Court engaged in a\n\nquite lengthy analysis of the merits of the claim.            Thus, in citing Rodriguez,\n\nRespondents effectively reinforce that Petitioners’ equal protection claims are justiciable\n\nwithout regard to the viability of their Education Clause claims.67\n\n       This leaves the question of what sort of right is at issue. In turn, this will dictate\n\nwhat standard of review applies to Petitioners’ equal protection claim, should it proceed.\n\nWe need not resolve that question presently, but we underscore that whether education\n\n67\n        No political question challenge was raised or addressed in Rodriguez. However,\nin federal courts, unlike in Pennsylvania courts, see supra at 37-38, the question of\njusticiability, and specifically the political question doctrine, goes to the jurisdictional\n“case or controversy” requirement set forth in Article III of the United States\nConstitution. See Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109087\"><a href=\"/opinion/109087/schlesinger-v-reservists-comm-to-stop-the-war/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">208</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 215\n(1974). Thus, the absence of discussion of the issue does not make less significant the\nCourt’s assertion of jurisdiction over the Equal Protection Clause claim.\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 79\n\fis a fundamental right under Pennsylvania law is not a settled question simply because\n\nDanson and Marrero II suggested as much. To the contrary, we do not read any of our\n\nprior cases as settling whether the Pennsylvania Constitution confers an individual right\n\nto education—and, if so, of what sort. In the Teachers’ Tenure Act Case, this Court\n\ndistinguished a Pennsylvania with the benefits of mandated public education from one\n\nin which education is “scarce,” “a privilege of the rich.” 197 A. at 352. This might be\n\ntaken as support for the proposition that the framers intended that what was once “a\n\nprivilege of the rich” would, through the Education Clause, become a right vested in all\n\nPennsylvanians. To similar effect, in School District of Philadelphia v. Twer, this Court\n\nobserved that “financial concerns could not in any way dilute the primary responsibility\n\nto maintain ‘a thorough and efficient system of public schools,’” and “that the\n\nmaintenance of a public school system is primarily for the education and training of our\n\nyouth.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2093298\"><a href=\"/opinion/2093298/school-dist-of-philadelphia-v-twer/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 224 (Pa. 1982). Thus, “the polestar in any decision requiring the\n\nassignment of priorities of resources available for education must be the best interest of\n\nthe student.” Id.68\n\n\n\n68\n        This is consistent with the intuition that to disregard the beneficiaries of a\nmandate is to render that mandate little more than a hortatory slogan.

It is a mistake to conflate\n\nlegislative policy-making pursuant to a constitutional mandate with constitutional\n\ninterpretation of that mandate and the minimum that it requires.

REV. 477, 501 (1974)) (“One does not think of [the\n\nlegislature] as functionally equipped or designed to interpret the Constitution without\n\nreview, nor under our system, does one wish to leave to [the legislature] unbridled\n\nauthority to determine the constitutionality of its own acts.”). Judicial oversight must be\n\ncommensurate with the priority reflected in the fact that for centuries our charter has\n\nfeatured some form of educational mandate. Otherwise, it is all but inevitable that the\n\nobligation to support and maintain a “thorough and efficient system of public education”\n\nwill jostle on equal terms with non-constitutional considerations that the people deemed\n\nunworthy of embodying in their Constitution. We cannot avoid our responsibility to\n\nmonitor the General Assembly’s efforts in service of its mandate and to measure those\n\neffects     against   the   constitutional   imperative,   ensuring   that   non-constitutional\n\nconsiderations never prevail over that mandate.\n\n          Similarly, and for the reasons stated, we find colorable Petitioners’ allegation that\n\nthe General Assembly imposes a classification whereunder distribution of state funds\n\nresults in widespread deprivations in economically disadvantaged districts of the\n\nresources necessary to attain a constitutionally adequate education. Accordingly, the\n\nCommonwealth Court erred in determining that Petitioners’ equal protection claims are\n\nnon-justiciable. Whether Petitioners’ equal protection claims are viewed as intertwined\n\nwith their Education Clause claims or assessed independently, those claims are not\n\nsubject to judicial abstention under the political question doctrine.           It remains for\n\n\n\n\n                                        [J-82-2016] - 85\n\fPetitioners to substantiate and elucidate the classification at issue and to establish the\n\nnature of the right to education, if any, to determine what standard of review the lower\n\ncourt must employ to evaluate their challenge.          But Petitioners are entitled to the\n\nopportunity to do so.\n\n       The Commonwealth Court’s order sustaining the Commonwealth’s preliminary\n\nobjections is reversed. This case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with\n\nthis Opinion.\n\n       Justices Todd, Donohue, Dougherty and Mundy join the opinion.\n\n\n\n       Justice Dougherty files a concurring opinion.\n\n\n\n       Chief Justice Saylor files a dissenting opinion.\n\n\n\n       Justice Baer files a dissenting opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                     [J-82-2016] - 86\n\f</pre>",
