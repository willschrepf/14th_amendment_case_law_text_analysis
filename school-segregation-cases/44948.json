Hauck of Cincinnati, Ohio, Attorney\nRegistration No. 0023153, was admitted to the practice of law in Ohio in 1978. In\nFebruary 2010, relator, Cincinnati Bar Association, filed a complaint charging\nrespondent with failing to maintain client funds in a separate, interest bearing trust\naccount, failing to maintain adequate records of client funds in his possession,\ncommingling client funds with his own, and failing to notify his clients that he did\nnot carry malpractice insurance.\n        {¶ 2} The parties have submitted stipulations of fact and misconduct, and\na panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline conducted a\nhearing to determine the appropriate sanction for respondent’s misconduct. The\npanel and board adopted the stipulated findings of fact and misconduct. While the\npanel recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for 12\nmonths with six months stayed on conditions, the board, citing extraordinary\nevidence in mitigation, recommended that the entire 12-month suspension be\nstayed. Because respondent has stipulated to misconduct involving dishonesty,\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nfraud, deceit, or misrepresentation, we conclude that an actual suspension is\nwarranted. Accordingly, we suspend respondent from the practice of law for 12\nmonths, with six months stayed on conditions.\n                                    Misconduct\n       {¶ 3} In February 2009, respondent issued a $2,800 check from a\nNational City Bank account to the guardian of a minor, representing the proceeds\nof the minor’s personal-injury claim. At the end of March 2009, after discovering\nthat the guardian had not negotiated the check, respondent directed the bank to\nstop payment. At a guardianship hearing before the probate court, respondent\nadvised the magistrate that there may have been commingling in the account, and\nthat because the account balance had dropped below $2,800, he would need time\nto replenish the account and reissue the check. He did not remit the funds to the\nguardian until June 2009.\n       {¶ 4} Beginning in 2003 and continuing through 2009, respondent\ncommingled his personal and business funds with client funds in a single National\nCity Bank account to avoid overdraft charges on his personal and business\naccounts. While comingling these funds, respondent failed to maintain adequate\nrecords of client funds in his possession.\n       {¶ 5} The National City Bank account that respondent used is registered\nto “ABC Company,” a nonprofit entity that he had formed. The checks that he\nissued from that account, however, were deceptive, because they did not identify\nABC Company as the owner of the account. Instead, they bore respondent’s\nname followed by “Attorney at Law,” and “IOLTA,” giving the false impression\nthat the checks were drawn on his client trust account.\n       {¶ 6} Respondent testified that one of the reasons he used the ABC\nCompany account was to avoid tax garnishments by the Internal Revenue Service\n(“IRS”) for income taxes and employment taxes that he owed. Although he\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f                                     January Term, 2011\n\n\n\n\nadmitted that he had had issues with the Internal Revenue Service in the 1980s\nand early 1990s, he claimed that he was not aware of any pending IRS issues.\n         {¶ 7} In addition to respondent’s banking irregularities, the parties have\nstipulated that respondent ceased to carry professional-malpractice insurance as of\nApril 1, 2009. They have also stipulated that he did not begin informing his\nclients about his uninsured status until sometime in February 2010.\n         {¶ 8} Based on these facts, the parties have stipulated, the panel and\nboard have found, and we agree that respondent has violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(a)\n(requiring a lawyer to hold property of clients separate from the lawyer’s own\nproperty), 1.15(b) (permitting a lawyer to deposit his or her own funds in a client\ntrust account for the sole purpose of paying or obtaining a waiver of bank service\ncharges), 1.4(c) (requiring a lawyer to inform the client in a writing signed by the\nclient if the lawyer does not maintain professional-liability insurance), and 8.4(c)\n(prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,\ndeceit, or misrepresentation).1\n                                            Sanction\n         {¶ 9} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider\nrelevant factors, including the ethical duties that the lawyer violated and the\nsanctions imposed in similar cases. Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, 96 Ohio\nSt.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, ¶ 16.                           In making a final\ndetermination, we also weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors\nlisted in Section 10(B) of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on\nComplaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and\n\n\n\n1. Although relator’s complaint did not charge respondent with a violation of Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(c),\nwe have previously recognized that a respondent’s review of and consent to stipulated facts and\nthe stipulated violations, and his waiver of a hearing, satisfied the due-process requirements of In\nre Ruffalo (1968), 390 U.S. 544, 550-551, 88 S.Ct. 1222, 20 L.Ed.2d 117. See Disciplinary\nCounsel v. Jackson (1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 104, 105, 712 N.E.2d 122. Here, respondent stipulated\nto the facts and violation and received a hearing.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nDiscipline (“BCGD Proc.Reg.”). Disciplinary Counsel v. Broeren, 115 Ohio\nSt.3d 473, 2007-Ohio-5251, 875 N.E.2d 935, ¶ 21.\n       {¶ 10} The panel and board found that respondent’s dishonest motive was\nan aggravating factor. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(b). As mitigating factors,\nthe panel and board cited respondent’s lack of a prior disciplinary record, his full\nand free disclosure and cooperative attitude toward the disciplinary proceeding,\nand the fact that no clients were harmed. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a) and (d).\n       {¶ 11} The panel and board also observed that respondent had submitted\n“compelling testimony” from Kathy King, a magistrate of the Hamilton County\nDomestic Relations Court, regarding his integrity and honesty.          The panel\ndiscounted this testimony in light of respondent’s admission that his use of the\nABC Company checking account was deceitful and recommended that respondent\nbe suspended from the practice of law for 12 months, with six months stayed on\nconditions. The board, however, gave greater weight to King’s testimony, which\nrecounted respondent’s history of public service, beginning in law school and\ncontinuing throughout his 30 years of practice, including his participation in\nprojects and investments designed to strengthen Cincinnati’s low-income\ncommunity.    Therefore, the board recommended that respondent’s entire 12-\nmonth suspension be stayed on conditions.\n       {¶ 12} “Dishonest conduct on the part of an attorney generally warrants\nan actual suspension from the practice of law.” Disciplinary Counsel v. Rooney,\n110 Ohio St.3d 349, 2006-Ohio-4576, 853 N.E.2d 663, ¶ 12, citing Disciplinary\nCounsel v. Beeler, 105 Ohio St.3d 188, 2005-Ohio-1143, 824 N.E.2d 78, ¶ 44,\nand Disciplinary Counsel v. Fowerbaugh (1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 187, 191, 658\nN.E.2d 237.     We acknowledge respondent’s extensive work with the poor,\nincluding his full-time volunteer work with the public defender’s office after he\ngraduated from law school, the investment of his inherited wealth in the\nrehabilitation of buildings and social service agencies in the inner-city\n\n\n\n\n                                         4\n\f                               January Term, 2011\n\n\n\n\nneighborhood of Over-the-Rhine, and his dedication to the poor and\ndisadvantaged people of that area. These good works, however, do not excuse\nrespondent’s complete disregard of the Rules of Professional Conduct requiring\nattorneys to maintain client funds separate from their own and to maintain\ndetailed records of all funds received on behalf of a client.        Nor do they\ncompensate for his deceptive course of conduct that spanned more than five years.\n       {¶ 13} Having considered respondent’s conduct, the aggravating and\nmitigating factors, and our precedent, we conclude that the appropriate sanction\nfor respondent’s misconduct is a 12-month suspension, with six months stayed on\nthe conditions that he serve six months of monitored probation in accordance with\nGov.Bar. V(9) and that he commit no further misconduct.\n       {¶ 14} Accordingly, we suspend respondent from the practice of law in\nOhio for 12 months, with six months stayed on the conditions that he serve six\nmonths of supervised probation with a monitor appointed by relator in accordance\nwith Gov.Bar R. V(9) and that he commit no further misconduct. If respondent\nfails to comply with the conditions, the stay will be lifted, and he will serve the\nentire 12-month suspension. Costs are taxed to respondent.\n                                                             Judgment accordingly.\n       O’CONNOR, C.J., and PFEIFER, LUNDBERG STRATTON, O’DONNELL,\nLANZINGER, CUPP, and MCGEE BROWN, JJ., concur.\n                              __________________\n       James K.

V(9) and that he commit no further misconduct.\n       {¶ 14} Accordingly, we suspend respondent from the practice of law in\nOhio for 12 months, with six months stayed on the conditions that he serve six\nmonths of supervised probation with a monitor appointed by relator in accordance\nwith Gov.Bar R. V(9) and that he commit no further misconduct. If respondent\nfails to comply with the conditions, the stay will be lifted, and he will serve the\nentire 12-month suspension. Costs are taxed to respondent.\n                                                             Judgment accordingly.\n       O’CONNOR, C.J., and PFEIFER, LUNDBERG STRATTON, O’DONNELL,\nLANZINGER, CUPP, and MCGEE BROWN, JJ., concur.\n                              __________________\n       James K. Rice and Richard H. Johnson, for relator.\n       John H. Burlew, for respondent.\n                           ______________________\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\f</pre>",
