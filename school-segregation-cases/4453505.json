The primary disagreement between the\n\nparties now centers on whether or not the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to\n\nconsider the discovery order at issue and whether or not the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion with its discovery rulings.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\f                     COUNTER-ISSUES PRESENTED\n\nCounter-Issue One: The Court of Appeals does not have jurisdiction to\nconsider the discovery matters at issue in this case and the mandamus should\nbe dismissed because Relator has an adequate legal remedy.\n\nReply Point One: Assuming arguendo, that this court has jurisdiction of this\nmatter, Mandamus still fails, because Green has the right to inspect\ndocuments provided under the order and the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in maintaining its docket and court procedures.

(CR p. 8-14)1 During the pendency of the litigation, POC\n\nfiled a motion seeking protection from Green’s discovery actions on August 8,\n\n2014. (CR p. 114-130) One basis of the Motion was that Green was making\n\nduplicative requests for information to harass POC. (RR Vol. II, p. 5-15) A\n\nhearing was held on August 14, 2014, and after that, an order for protection was\n\ngranted. (CR p. 131-132)                                                                                                                                                                                                                            George Green was at that hearing and discussed\n\ndiscovery issues with Respondent. (RR Vol. II, p. 28)\n\n                                                           Subsequently, Green continued conduct POC believed violated the order of\n\nprotection. (CR p. 153-156) In response, POC filed a Motion to Enforce the Order\n\nof August 14, 2014. (CR p. 153-156) A hearing was held on that motion on\n\nOctober 14, 2014. (CR p. 175; RR Vol. III, p. 3) The Judge granted the Motion to\n\nEnforce the Protective Order and entered an order on October 21, 2014. (CR p. 175)\n\nThe record of the hearing on that Motion again details what Respondent expected\n\nof the parties. (RR Vol. II, p. 12-19) That is the order that was the subject of the\n\noriginal appeal. That order has been vacated.

(Supp. CR p. 4; Supp. RR p.\n\n4-30) On that date, the trial court again discussed the discovery issues at length\n\nwith the parties, working with them to try to fashion a further compromise in order\n\nto meet the concerns of both parties. (Supp. RR Vol. I, p. 4-31) As the record\n\nfrom that hearing makes clear, neither Respondent nor Real Parties In Interest were\n\nseeking to prevent Green from attending meetings of the Homeowners Association\n\n(“HOA”), voting in HOA elections or speaking at those meetings. (Supp. RR Vol.\n\nI, p. 6, 11, 15, 23) Indeed, Green had attended meetings of the Homeowners\n\nAssociation after the October 21, 2014 order. (Supp. RR Vol. I, p. 6) Rather,\n\nRespondent wanted to provide Relator the information allowable under the Bylaws\n\nand Codes, while preventing what he had found to be the harassing conduct of\n\nconstant demands for information and documents directly to POC.

First, the trial court vacated the earlier order Green\n\nsought to appeal. Second, the January 30, 2015 order concerns a discovery matter,\n\nthere is no final judgment and there is an adequate remedy at law.\n\n       Moreover, assuming arguendo that this Court has jurisdiction, the Trial\n\nCourt did not abuse its discretion in any action of which the Relator has\n\ncomplained, or seeks to complain. Respondent has authority to manage his docket\n\nand the discovery process for cases the parties have conferred jurisdiction upon it\n\nby filing a lawsuit. Moreover, the codes providing for information and document\n\nrequests require such requests be pursued reasonably and for a proper purpose.\n\nThe Respondent very clearly followed those principles in fashioning these orders.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f                    I. ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES\n\nA.    The Court of Appeals does not have jurisdiction to consider the\n      discovery matters at issue in this case and the mandamus should be\n      dismissed because Relator has an adequate legal remedy.\n\n      1.    The Court Should Reconsider its April 3, 2015 Order and Find\n            the Issue Moot Because the Order Complained of was Vacated.\n\n      Originally, Relator claimed to be seeking interlocutory review of an\n\ninjunction. However, properly understood, the order for which Green seeks relief\n\nis a discovery sanction. Wood v. James R. Moriarty, P.C., 940 S.W.2d 359 (Tex.\n\nApp—Dallas, 1997, no pet). On January 30, 2015, a hearing was held in the\n\nDistrict Court and the District Court vacated the order of October 21, 2014, the\n\norder that was the subject of the pending interlocutory appeal. (Supp. CR p. 4)\n\n      POC has argued and here re-urges its argument that this court has the\n\nauthority to dismiss this appeal because the discovery order complained of has\n\nbeen vacated. In re Campbell, 106 S.W.3d 788 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2003)(trial\n\ncourt order vacating earlier contempt order moots appeal because order no longer\n\nexists). For this reason, POC re-urges its argument that the Court of Appeals is\n\nwithout jurisdiction and the case should be dismissed. Tex. R. App. Pro. 42.3\n\n(Vernon 2003).\n\n      2.    The mandamus should be denied because this is a discovery\n            matter, there is no final appealable judgment and Relators have\n            an adequate remedy at law for the review of the Order.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f      This case involves questions about the discovery process undertaken by the\n\nparties and the court umpiring those actions in this civil case. There is no final\n\njudgment. Lehmann v. Har-Con Corp., 39 S.W.3d 191, 200 (Tex. 2001). Rather,\n\nGreen sought to proceed under the extraordinary remedy that is an interlocutory\n\nappeal. (CR p. 182-183) Subsequently, this Court allowed Green’s appeal to\n\nproceed as a mandamus action.\n\n      Consistent with the idea of judicial economy allowing review of trial court\n\nrulings under the discretionary standard of review, Green has a remedy at law for\n\nthe review of these discovery orders and that is available after judgment. Walker v.\n\nPacker, 827 S.W2d 833, 842 (Tex. 1992). The discussion between the parties and\n\nRespondent, about the Respondent’s interest for discovery in this case, weighing\n\ncosts to the court and parties clearly illustrates why discovery matters are not\n\nordinarily appealable during the pendency of the case. (Supp. RR Vol. I, p. 10-24)\n\nDiscovery sanctions are rarely the proper subject for mandamus review. Velez v.\n\nDelara, 905 S.W.2d 43 (Tex.App.—San Antonio 1995, no writ). Even if the Court\n\nof Appeals had jurisdiction, the Respondent did not abuse his discretion with his\n\nruling in this case. And, if he did, the ruling is subject to review after judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fB.    Reply Point One: Assuming arguendo, that this court has\n      jurisdiction of this matter, Mandamus still fails, because Green\n      has the right to inspect documents provided under the order and\n      the trial court did not abuse its discretion in maintaining its\n      docket and court procedures. [Responsive to all Relator’s issues]\n\n      1.     Standard of Review\n\n      As Relator rightly concedes, a trial court has a broad range of discretion in\n\nmaintaining its docket and controlling discovery procedures with parties before the\n\ncourt. The proper standard of review for this matter is whether or not the trial\n\njudge abused his discretion. Johnson v. Fourth Court of Appeals, 700 S.W.2d 916,\n\n917 (Tex. 1985). In order to establish that the trial judge abused his discretion, the\n\nreviewing court must consider he acted without reference to any guiding rules and\n\nprinciples, such that the act was arbitrary and unreasonable. Downer v.\n\nAquamarine Operators, Inc., 701 S.W.2d 238 (Tex. 1985) cert. denied, 476 U.S.\n\n1159 (1986).\n\n\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\f      2.     The court did not violate its discretionary authority to umpire\n             discovery matters before the court.\n\n      When standing for confirmation to the Supreme Court, Justice John Roberts\n\naptly described the proper role of the judge as the umpire of the judicial system,\n\nnot playing the game, but seeking to insure the parties operate fairly and in bounds.\n\nwww.Washingtonpost.com 6/28/2012, Chris Cillizza (visited 2/27). As the parties\n\nhere agree, that understanding is at the heart of the standard of review in this case.\n\nThe standard guides the Court of Appeals’ review. Applying that standard, it is\n\nclear the district judge did not abuse his discretion here.\n\n      Regardless of how the order at issue may be styled, it is not a final order as it\n\ndid not dispose of all parties and/or claims. Lehmann v. Har-Con, 39 S.W.3d 191,\n\n200 (Tex. 2001). Therefore, it is not a final judgment. Tex. R. Civ. Pro. 301. A\n\ntrial court retains jurisdiction over its docket, including the power to modify,\n\namend, or change interlocutory rulings and orders until it loses its plenary power.\n\nTex. R. Civ. Pro. 329b, Scott & White Memorial Hosp., v. Schexnider, 940 S.W.2d\n\n594, 596 (Tex. 1996). Accordingly, the trial court had authority to change this\n\ninterlocutory order in the way it did regardless of what it is called.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\f      3.    Green is not entitled to mandamus relief from Judge Garrett’s\n            January 30, 2015 discovery order because the Judge’s decision\n            was not arbitrary, it was reasonable, and does not violate Green’s\n            rights as a property owner derived from statute, bylaws or other\n            legal authority.\n\n            a.     George Green is not a property owner and therefore has no\n                   rights to inspect records under the statute, bylaws or other\n                   legal authority.\n\n      George Green brought this lawsuit by and through a Power of Attorney he\n\nhad from his father, Garlan Green, a property owner at Port of Call. (CR p. 8)\n\nRelator argued earlier that outside of the discovery context of the Texas Rules of\n\nCivil Procedure, he is entitled to information under the Property Code, the Texas\n\nBusiness Organizations Code and the Bylaws of the Association as a property\n\nowner. (RR Vol. II, p 51 - 53) On or about January 17, 2015, Garlan Green\n\npassed away. Green’s counsel has since filed a Suggestion of Death notifying the\n\nCourt of this development.     The powers of the agent cease on the death of his\n\nprincipal. Cole v. McWillie,    S.W.3d        , 2015 WL 535562 (Tex.App.—\n\nEastland 2015, no pet.) (“…the law is clear, that an agent’s authority to bind his\n\nprincipal terminates upon the principal’s death.” citing Cleveland v. Williams, 29\n\nTex. 204, 213 (1867), Crawford v. Morris, 228 S.W.2d 364, 366 (Tex.Civ.App.—\n\nEastland 1950, writ ref’d n.r.e.)). Upon his passing, the Power of Attorney from\n\nGarlan Green to his son George Green was revoked. Gilmer v. Veatch, 121 S.W.\n\n545 Tex. Civ. App. 1909, no writ), Nehring v. McMurrain, 45 S.W. 1032 (Tex. Civ.\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fApp. 1898, no writ). Green’s counsel has acknowledged that Garland Green’s\n\ndeath complicates standing. (Supp. RR p. 12-13)\n\n                                                           George Green is not a property owner. (Supp. RR p. 12-13) Nor is there any\n\nevidence that he is acting as a proper agent for a property owner because the\n\nproperty owner Garlan Green has passed away. Therefore, George Green has no\n\nrights to review or inspect documents under the Homeowner Association Bylaws,\n\nthe Texas Property Code or the Texas Business Organizations Code. Absent such\n\nstanding, he has no right to request or inspect documents in any event.\n\n                                                                                                                      b.

The fact is, the order\n\nentered by the court on January 30, 2015 expressly allows for the production of\n\nrecords from POC to Green through counsel.2 (Supp. CR p. 5) This is a proper\n\nruling. See Watson v The Homeowners Association of Heritage Ranch, Inc., 346\n\nS.W.3d 258 (Tex.App.—Dallas 2011, no petition) (protective order regarding\n\ninformation request under statute not abuse of discretion).

See: Tex. Prop.\n\nCode §82.114 and Tex. Bus. Org. Code §22.351. (and/or their predecessors)\n\nFurther, no one has argued that POC has not followed and met its obligations under\n\nthese orders made by Respondent.       The January 30, 2015 order provides a\n\nreasonable procedure for POC to provide all statutorily required documents and\n\nother discovery.\n\n      The apparent question before the court in this Mandamus proceeding is\n\nwhether the Relator abused his discretion to control extra-judicial discovery\n\nrequests incident to a lawsuit. See Court of Appeals Order of April 3, 2015 p. 2.\n\nThe Court has asked POC to address the power of the court to control document\n\nand information requests existing beyond the ordinary discovery vehicles described\n\nin the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. Initially, the Court of Appeals should\n\nrecognize that the Respondent did not abuse his discretion in finding Green had not\n\nexercised his rights for a proper purpose, but rather had been using them to harass\n\nthe Association.\n\n      At the commencement of this lawsuit, Green sent POC significant discovery,\n\nincluding extensive requests for production of documents. (RR Vol. II, p. 51)\n\nThese requests included information a property owner is entitled to inspect by\n\nstatute, as well as additional information. (Id.) The Texas Property Code, Texas\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fBusiness Organization Code, and the Port of Call Homeowners Association\n\nBylaws themselves only require that documents requested be produced for\n\ninspection, and possibly copying. Tex. Prop. Code §82.114; Tex. Bus. Org. Code\n\n§22.351. However, Relator also requested the documents in his Requests for\n\nProduction and his attorney has taken the position that inspection is not sufficient\n\nbut rather the documents needed to be “produced.” (RR Vol. II, p. 51) POC\n\ncounsel has produced to Green all non-privileged documents in their actual and\n\nconstructive possession relating to the Home Owners Association, these documents\n\ndated back to 1998 and totaled over 16,000 pages. (RR Vol. II, p. 19)\n\n      Ultimately POC sought relief from Green’s constant demands in the form of\n\na protective order. (CR p. 114) The Respondent determined that the constant\n\ndemand to the POC for more documents, additional documents and to re-review\n\ndocuments previously produced, was harassing. (RR Vol. II, p. 29, 53; RR Vol. II,\n\np. 13-19; Supp. RR p. 8-30) Subsequently, POC filed a Motion to Enforce the\n\norder believing Green had violated the earlier ruling. (CR p. 153) After a series of\n\nhearings, the Order of January 30, 2015 was entered. (Supp. CR Vol. I, p. 5) It\n\nrequires “Defendants [POC] supplement document responsive to Plaintiff’s [Green]\n\nprevious discovery requests made by Plaintiff every sixty (60) days ... Such\n\nsupplementation shall occur without prompting or request by Plaintiff, and shall\n\ninclude any Port of Call Homeowners Association-related documents that\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fmembers may lawfully request due to their status as HOA members.” (Supp. CR\n\nVol. I, p. 5) (Emphasis added)\n\n      Clearly, the court can sanction parties under the discovery rules of the Texas\n\nRules of Civil Procedure, when parties are abusing discovery. See generally: Tex.\n\nR. Civ. Pro. 190.5 (Vernon Supp. 2014), Tex. R. Civ. Pro. 191.1 (Vernon 2004),\n\nTex. R. Civ. Pro. 192.4 (Vernon 2004), Tex. R. Civ. Pro. 192.6 (Vernon 2004), and\n\nTex. R. Civ. Pro. 215.3 (Vernon 2004). Indeed, the court can undertake such action\n\nsua sponte. See Tex. R. Civ. Pro. 191.3(e) (Vernon 2004). Further, the court can\n\nmodify a discovery period developed under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure at\n\nanytime, and it must do so when justice requires it. Tex. R. Civ. Pro. 190.5.\n\n(Emphasis added) Those rules further describe that discovery may be limited by\n\nthe court, and should be limited by the court if it determines, on motion or its own\n\ninitiative, that discovery requests are duplicative or otherwise harmful. Tex. R. Civ.\n\nPro. 192.4.\n\n      Properly understood, this power of the court to umpire the parties’ discovery\n\nefforts must extend to extra judicial discovery processes in other statutory\n\nframeworks, like the Texas Property Code and the Texas Business Organizations\n\nCode. Courts have recognized this. See e.g., In re Bay Area Citizens Against\n\nLawsuit Abuse, 982 S.W.2d 371, 381-82 (Tex. 1998) (names of financial\n\ncontributors not subject to blanket disclosures under Tex. Bus. Org. Code §1396-\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\f2.23A), Huie v. DeShazo, 922 S.W.2d 920, 923-23 (Tex. 1996) (information\n\nrequests under statute do not override attorney-client privilege). Indeed, even the\n\nstructure of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure themselves support this\n\nunderstanding, because the power of the court to sanction, limit or otherwise\n\nmodify discovery requests found in Tex. R. Civ. Pro. 192.6(a) and 192.6(b)(4) is\n\nnot limited to “these rules” (i.e., the discovery processes of the Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure). The drafters of those rules could have limited that provision to the\n\ndiscovery in the Rules of Civil Procedure had they wanted to. They did not. Thus,\n\nthat power is not circumscribed.      See:    Gaughn v. National Cutting Horse\n\nAssociation, 351 S.W. 3d 408 (Tex.App.—Ft. Worth 2011, pet. for review denied).\n\n      In addition, Tex. R. Civ. Pro. 191.3(c) provides that the signature of a party\n\nto a “discovery request” implies that the request, among other things, is not\n\nharassing. If a court determines otherwise it may impose a sanction on the person\n\nwho made the certification by signature. Tex. R. Civ. Pro. 191.3(e). Again, that\n\njudicial power is not limited to “these rules” and the discovery vehicles described\n\nin the Rules of Civil Procedure. Therefore, the judicial discretion built into the\n\nsystem via the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure can be applied to discovery matters\n\nbeyond those rules. See: Gaughn v. National Cutting Horse Association, 351\n\nS.W.3d 408 (Tex.App.—Ft. Worth 2011, pet. for review denied). In addition, a\n\ncourt has inherent authority in some situations to impose sanctions. See: Ezeoke v.\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fTracy, 349 S.W.3d 679, 685 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2011, no pet.). That\n\npower extends to sanctions if a party violates a court order, like here. Respondent\n\nearlier determined that Green had violated his discovery order of August 14, 2014\n\nand continued harassing POC. (CR p. 175; Supp. RR Vol. I, p. 8; RR Vol. II,\n\np. 12-19)\n\n       It is not crystal clear all of the statutory schemes the Relator believes provide\n\nhim the right of immediate inspection of records from his father’s Homeowners\n\nAssociation. In the hearing of August 14, 2014, Relator’s counsel urged Texas\n\nBusiness and Organizations Code §252.010 and §22.351. (RR Vol. II, p. 40 - 45)\n\nFurthermore, the Texas Property Code §82.114 is referenced in the Bylaws and\n\nthus also of likely application. (RR Vol. II, p. 40) Moreover, §81.209 of the Texas\n\nProperty Code may too apply. Each of these is discussed below.\n\n       The Texas Property Code §82.114(b) requires an association keep “all\n\nfinancial and other records of the association…reasonably available…for\n\nexamination by a unit owner and the owner’s agents.” Tex. Prop. Code §82.114\n\n(Vernon’s 2014). (Emphasis added) The same reasonableness provision is\n\nincorporated into the Port of Call Homeowner’s Association Bylaws by reference.\n\n(RR Vol. II, p. 40) Section 81.2093 of the Property Code has been interpreted to\n\nmean a homeowner may inspect records unless the request is for an improper\n\n3\n  §81.209 applies to those regimes created before January 1, 1994. POC was created in 1980, it\nis possible it has application to this case.\n\n                                             -17-\n\fpurpose. Burton v. Cravey, 759 S.W.2d 160 (Tex.App.—Houston [1st Dist] 1988,\n\nno writ).\n\n                                                           The Texas Business Organizations Code states that a member of a\n\ncorporation is entitled to review specific documents at any “reasonable time and\n\nfor a proper purpose.” Tex. Bus. Org. Code §22.351 (Vernon’s 2012) (Emphasis\n\nadded) Moreover, §252.010 requires that an unincorporated non-profit association\n\n“. . . shall make the books and records available on request to members of the\n\nassociation for inspection and copying.” Tex. Bus. Org. Code §252.010 (Vernon\n\n2012).4 The statutes do not require production “on demand.” (RR Vol. II, p. 27)\n\n                                                           Considering all of these sections together, it is certainly not an abuse of\n\ndiscretion for a court to determine that the documents the statues require to be\n\ninspected or produced shall be produced in a form that is regularly used in the\n\ncourse of business every 60 days. That is what the Respondent did in this case.\n\nThat should not be taken as disregarding all standards or rules, but is rather a\n\nprudent use of his discretionary authority.\n\n                                                           Since the Respondent ruled that POC had to produce all documents Green\n\nwould be entitled to inspect as a homeowner, POC is actually required to exceed\n\ntheir obligations to Green under the referenced statutes or bylaws. In an effort to\n\ncurb what Respondent identified as Green’s previous harassing behavior, the Court\n\t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r   \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \n4\n While POC was created in 1980, it was not incorporated until later. (RR Vol. I, p. 41-42) Thus\nboth sections might apply.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    -18-\n\falso ruled that Green’s request for documents covered by the order or previously\n\nproduced will be viewed as a discovery abuse and subject to sanctions. (Supp. CR\n\np. 5) The Judge explicitly excluded requests for documents from Green’s attorney.\n\n(Id)\n\n       The January 30, 2015 Order does not deprive Green of any right to access of\n\nrecords, in fact, it gives him greater access to records than he is entitled to under\n\nstatutes and bylaws. Further the January 30, 2015 Order is an attempt to protect\n\nPOC from Green’s harassing and abusive requests. Accordingly, there is no abuse\n\nof discretion in making the order Respondent made and the Petition for Mandamus\n\nshould be denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\f                        CONCLUSION AND PRAYER\n\n       POC prays that the Court dismiss the Petition for Mandamus because it is\n\nwithout jurisdiction to consider it. In the alternative, POC prays that the Court\n\ndeny the Relator’s issues because there is no error in the rendition of the order\n\nbelow. Pleading as a further alternative, POC prays that the Court sustain their\n\ncounterpoint as an alternative ground for affirming the order of the trial court.\n\nPOC prays for such other relief both at law or equity to which it may be justly\n\nentitled.\n\n                                          Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                          WRIGHT & GREENHILL, P.C.\n                                          221 West 6th Street, Suite 1800\n                                          Austin, Texas 78701\n                                          512/476-4600\n                                          512/476-5382\n                                          rpringle@w-g.com\n                                          hcoughlin@w-g.com\n                                          mthompson@w-g.com\n\n                                           /s/ Brantley Ross Pringle, Jr.\n                                          By:_____________________________\n                                             Brantley Ross Pringle, Jr.\n                                             State Bar No. 16330001\n                                             Heidi A.

In that pleading, Tracy contended sanctions were warranted because Ezeoke falsely alleged that the suit to modify was\n       filed within one year after the rendition of the order sought to be modified. Tracy filed a First Amended Answer to Motion to Deny\n       Relief in Suit to Modify Parent–Child relationship and Request for Sanctions on June 3, 2009. In this pleading, Tracy contended\n       sanctions were warranted because Ezeoke (1) falsely alleged that the motion to modify was filed within one year after rendition of\n       the order sought to be modified; and (2) failed to serve a copy of an Amended Motion to Deny Relief in Suit to Modify Parent–Child\n       relationship when it was filed on May 14, 2009. There is no indication in the appellate record that the trial court ruled on either of\n       the two earlier sanctions requests.\n2      As filed, the January 4, 2010 motion sought sanctions against both Ezeoke and his client, Jossie Herrera. During the hearing on January\n       11, 2010, Tracy clarified that she sought sanctions solely on behalf of her professional corporation, “Cynthia Tracy, Attorney–at–\n       Law, P.C.,” and not on behalf of her client. Tracy also clarified that she was requesting sanctions solely against Ezeoke individually\n       and not against his client, Jossie Herrera.\n3      As a threshold matter, we reject Tracy's contention that Ezeoke waived all challenges to the imposition of sanctions because he did\n       not object to the imposition of sanctions before or at the sanctions hearing. The motion for sanctions was filed on January 4, 2010,\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Tracy, 349 S.W.3d 679 (2011)\n\n\n      and the hearing was held on January 11, 2010. It is undisputed on this record that Ezeoke was out of the country until mid-January.\n      Under these circumstances, Ezeoke's timely “Motion for a New Hearing on Attorney Cynthia Tracy's Motion for Sanctions” filed on\n      January 28, 2010 sufficed to preserve his challenges to the imposition of sanctions. See Howell v. Tex. Workers' Comp. Comm'n, 143\n      S.W.3d 416, 450 (Tex.App.-Austin 2004, pet. denied); Kiefer v. Cont'l Airlines, Inc., 10 S.W.3d 34, 41 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th\n      Dist.] 1999, pet. denied).\n4     This concern is not diminished by the fact that a hearing on Ezeoke's motion for rehearing was held on February 4, 2010 in front of\n      a different judge. A “reasonable opportunity to respond” to a sanctions request contemplates something more than the chance to ask\n      one trial court judge to reverse sanctions that already have been imposed by another trial court judge.\n5     In light of this remand, we express no opinion regarding (1) the trial court's finding that Ezeoke included “unfounded accusations,\n      misrepresentations, and name-calling of opposing counsel” in the motion for continuance; or (2) Ezeoke's contentions on appeal\n      regarding this finding. This issue should be addressed in the first instance on remand in conformity with section 10.003.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                  © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

See Basin Credit\n\n\nFootnotes\n1      Sanders was originally a plaintiff in this lawsuit, but he withdrew from the lawsuit as a plaintiff. He is a party to this appeal because\n       he and Gaughan are jointly and severally liable under the trial court's judgment for the NCHA's attorney's fees.\n2      The written request actually cited Texas Business Organizations Code section 22.351, the successor to article 1396–2.23. See Tex.\n       Bus. Org.Code Ann. § 22.351 (West 2009). However, the parties agree that article 1396–2.23 applies to this case.\n3      Gaughan sought three additional judicial declarations via summary judgment, but she does not assert on appeal that the trial court\n       erred by denying her motion for summary judgment on those grounds. Thus, we do not address Gaughan's request for those three\n       additional judicial declarations. See generally LeBlanc v. Riley, No. 02–08–00234–CV, 2009 WL 885953, at *3 (Tex.App.-Fort\n       Worth Apr. 2, 2009, no pet.) (mem. op.) (holding that a general issue broadly challenging a summary judgment is permissible but\n       requiring an appellant to present argument and legal authority on appeal to preserve error on a particular cause of action on which\n       the trial court granted summary judgment).\n4      When the legislature passes two separate statutes on the same general subject matter, it is presumed to have done so for a particular\n       purpose, and meaning must be given to both statutes. See Aldine Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Ogg, 122 S.W.3d 257, 270 (Tex.App.-Houston\n       [1st Dist.] 2003, no pet.); Font v. Carr, 867 S.W.2d 873, 881 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1993, writ dism'd w.o.j.).\n5      Because Gaughan is a member of the NCHA, the applicable statute in this case is article 1396–2.23(B), governing the right of a\n       member of a non-profit corporation, not the right of the public under article 1396–2.23A.\n6      Texas Business Corporations Act article 2.44 entitled directors and certain shareholders of a corporation to review the books and\n       records of a corporation for any proper purpose. Tex.Rev.Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2.44. (expired Jan. 2010); see also Tex. Bus. Org.Code\n       Ann. § 21.218 (West 2009) (current version of expired article 2.44). That statute, which is applicable to for-profit corporations, is\n       similar to article 1396.–2.23, which is applicable to non-profit corporations and at issue in this case. Texas courts have looked to\n       precedent under article 2.44 when dealing with issues presented under article 1396–2.23. See CASE, 886 S.W.2d at 289.\n7      Gaughan does not contend that she has been denied the opportunity to inspect confidential or attorney-client communications, but\n       the broader principle revealed by BACALA, Huie, CASE, PMI, and similar opinions—that the scope of the right of inspection for\n       members of a non-profit corporation may be limited by legitimate considerations of privilege, trade secrets, and confidentiality—as\n       well as the differing access granted to members and the public under articles 1396–2.23 and 1396–2.23A, reveals that even members\n       of a non-profit corporation do not have unfettered access to the non-profit's corporate records.\n8      Gaughan's first issue contends that the trial court erred by declaring that the NCHA's “financial records” are entitled to confidential\n       treatment, but it is clear from Gaughan's briefing on appeal and in the trial court that she contends that the trial court erred by entering\n       the protective order concerning any of the records she requested from the NCHA. As discussed above, however, Gaughan requested\n       and received records that a non-member may not inspect.\n9      We do not reach the issues of whether the NCHA met its burden of establishing confidentiality as to particular categories of records,\n       or whether a non-member may disseminate to other non-members information received pursuant to article 1396–2.23A. Those issues\n       are not before us given the unique procedural posture of this case and Gaughan's request that the trial court declare that all records\n       produced by the NCHA are not confidential despite her receipt of documents to which a non-member does not have the right to\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 288\n\nHuie and Ringer relating to the trust. The court's order, signed   fiduciaries and their counsel. Chenault nonetheless contends\nJuly 19, 1995, does not cite to any of the exceptions under        that communications between Huie and Ringer regarding\nTexas Rule of Civil Evidence 503 or otherwise disclose             trust matters cannot be privileged as to Chenault, a trust\nthe court's rationale. 2 The court held that the attorney-         beneficiary, even if the elements of Rule 503 are otherwise\nclient privilege protected only communications made under          met. Chenault's primary argument is that Huie's fiduciary\nthe following circumstances: 1) a litigious dispute existed        duty of disclosure overrides any attorney-client privilege that\nbetween Chenault and Huie; 2) Huie obtained legal advice           might otherwise apply.\nto protect himself against charges of misconduct; and 3)\nHuie paid for the legal counsel without reimbursement from          [2] Trustees and executors owe beneficiaries “a fiduciary\nthe estate or trust. The court accordingly ordered Ringer to       duty of full disclosure of all material facts known to them\nanswer questions relating to events before February 1993,          that might affect [the beneficiaries'] rights.” Montgomery\nwhen suit was filed and Huie began personally compensating         v. Kennedy, 669 S.W.2d 309, 313 (Tex.1984). See also\nRinger. The court also held that the attorney-work-product         TEX.PROP.CODE § 113.151(a) (requiring trustee to account\nprivilege did not apply to communications made before              to beneficiaries for all trust transactions). This duty exists\nChenault filed suit, again without stating its reasoning.          independently of the rules of discovery, applying even if no\n                                                                   litigious dispute exists between the trustee and beneficiaries.\nThe court of appeals, after granting Huie's motion for leave to\nfile petition for writ of mandamus, subsequently vacated that      Chenault argues that the trustee's duty of disclosure extends\norder as improvidently granted, denying relief. After Huie         to any communications between the trustee and the trustee's\nsought mandamus relief from this Court, we stayed Ringer's         attorney. The fiduciary's affairs are the beneficiaries' affairs,\ndeposition pending our consideration of the merits.                according to Chenault, and thus the beneficiaries are entitled\n                                                                   to know every aspect of Huie's conduct as trustee, including\n                                                                   his communications with Ringer.

Chenault also named several business associates of Huie as additional defendants.\n2      The trial court initially relied on Texas Rule of Civil Evidence 503(d)(5), which creates an exception to the attorney-client privilege\n       as between joint clients of an attorney regarding matters of common interest to the clients. The court, however, later amended its\n       order to delete this reference.\n3      Chenault argues for the first time in a post-submission brief that Ringer represented the trust itself as an entity, rather than Huie as\n       trustee. This argument is addressed in section III–B below.\n4      Chenault also argues that Huie, by accepting the appointment as trustee with knowledge of his duty of disclosure, impliedly waived\n       the protection of the attorney-client privilege. Because we conclude that a trustee does not violate the duty of full disclosure by\n       invoking the attorney-client privilege, we reject this waiver argument.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                     © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

III, § 52.\n3       Although the trial court ordered Keef to answer deposition questions covering a variety of topics, BACALA complains only of the\n        portion of the order requiring Keef to testify about BACALA's donor list. Similarly, although the trial court ordered BACALA to\n        produce a number of different documents, BACALA complains only of the portion of the trial court's order requiring BACALA to\n        produce its donor lists for 1994, 1995, and 1996. Therefore, the other portions of the discovery orders are not before us.\n4       Although BACALA asserted associational rights under Article I, Section 27 of the Texas Constitution, BACALA cited authority\n        only under the U.S. Constitution. Consequently, we do not consider the extent to which Article I, Section 27 provides an independent\n        basis for protection. See Tilton v. Moye, 869 S.W.2d 955, 956 n. 2 (Tex.1994).\n5       U.S. CONST. amend. I (“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;\n        or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government\n        for a redress of grievances.”).\n6       The taxpayers assert that the trial court's protective order, which limits the use of the donor information to litigation purposes\n        only, alleviates any First Amendment concerns. A protective order allows a court to grant disclosure rights while deferring to First\n        Amendment concerns. Ex parte Lowe, 887 S.W.2d at 4. Especially when the information is sought by private litigants, the existence of\n        a protective order limiting dissemination of the information to litigation purposes may be a factor to be considered when determining\n        whether disclosure is justified, although the protective order “itself does not justify disclosure.” Id. However, the protective order in\n        this case does not alleviate BACALA's First Amendment concerns because the taxpayers' lawyers, who would receive the information\n        under the protective order, are the very persons who have made some of the boycott threats.\n7       TEX.REV.CIV. STAT. ANN.. art. 1396–2.23A (Vernon 1997).\n8       In support of this proposition amicus briefs were submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, other Citizens Against\n        Lawsuit Abuse organizations, and a coalition of non-profit corporations, joined by the Texas Medical Association.\n9       See, e.g., Familias Unidas v. Briscoe, 619 F.2d 391, 398 (5 th Cir.1980).\n10      As stated supra, the Constitution requires that once a party makes a prima facie showing of harm from disclosure of contributors'\n        identities, the party seeking to compel disclosure “must show convincingly a substantial relation between the information sought and\n        a subject of overriding and compelling state interest.” Ex parte Lowe, 887 S.W.2d at 3. The state interest served by the statute is\n        ensuring the accountability of non-profit corporations for expenditures of contributions. Even if this interest is a compelling state\n        interest, there is no “substantial relation” between requiring disclosure of contributors' identities and ensuring such accountability. See\n        Pollard, 283 F.Supp. at 257 (finding no showing that disclosure of contributors' identities was relevant to the state's unquestionably\n        legitimate interest in preventing vote buying).\n\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Although our opinion did not quote the trial court's order, an examination of the record\n       in the case reveals that the order recited that the court had considered the defendant's motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff's\n       responses, and the defendant's reply, and had notified the parties that “it had determined to grant the defendant's motion for summary\n       judgment.” The decretal portion of the order stated “that plaintiff, Paul G. Chessher, take nothing of and from defendant, Southwestern\n       Bell Telephone Company. Costs of court are hereby taxed against plaintiff, Paul G. Chessher.”\n97     Young v. Hodde, 682 S.W.2d 236, 236–237 (Tex.1984) (per curiam), writ ref'd n.r.e., 672 S.W.2d 45 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th\n       Dist.] ).\n98     Post at 219 (emphasis in original).\n1      These rules and presumptions are irrelevant to the issues before the Court today. As we have repeatedly admonished—in Mafrige, in\n       Aldridge, and even in the Court's opinion today—the rules governing finality after a conventional trial are wholly inappropriate for\n       determining finality of summary judgments. See Mafrige, 866 S.W.2d at 592; North East Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Aldridge, 400 S.W.2d\n       893, 897–98 (Tex.1966); Lehmann, 39 S.W.3d 191.\n2      The unpublished opinions cited in Part I are cited only as examples, not as precedent. See TEX.R.APP. P. 47.7.\n3      This issue also arises when a trial court expressly mentions and disposes of a party even though that party was not mentioned in the\n       motion for summary judgment. Here, the lower courts have been more willing to apply Mafrige and hold that the order purports to\n       dispose of all parties and issues. See, e.g., Mikulich v. Perez, 915 S.W.2d 88, 91–92 (Tex.App.—San Antonio 1996, no writ).\n4      In fact, the district clerk sent all the parties (including those omitted from the summary judgment order) a postcard indicating that an\n       “Order for Interlocutory Summary Judgment” had been signed. Lehmann, 988 S.W.2d at 416.\n5      Oftentimes in these cases litigation continues to move forward. Any error in including magic finality language in a summary judgment\n       is not discovered until it is too late; the appellate timetable has expired and the trial court has lost plenary power to act. The litigants\n       have forever lost their right to complain of the judgment.\n6      It would not be enough for a court to generally state “plaintiff takes nothing,” “defendant is granted summary judgment in all things,”\n       or “this is a final appealable judgment.” Conclusory finality clauses (i.e. “magic language”) do not indicate that a trial court actually\n       granted relief not requested for or against parties or issues are not mentioned in the order.\n7      Of course, this procedure would not apply if the order fell within the category of cases for which there can be more than one final\n       judgment, or the category of orders for which a court of appeals has been granted statutory authority to review interlocutory orders.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                       © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The evidence of this witness was              Ratliffe, 5 Pet. 81.” In Flynn v.

The witness goes on and describes the               show that the person has been heard from, as living within\nappearance of this Frank Conrad, and gives his probable age,         that time, though by others than the members of his family.”\nand testifies as to some conversations that he had with Frank        Mullery v.

If the purpose had been           did survive her, and who claimed to be the legatee, was in\nto establish the pedigree by the evidence of this witness, it        fact so. On the question of identity it was held admissible\nwould not have been admissible, but here the object was to           to show the name such person bore, his personal appearance\nidentify the Frank *1033 Conrad known to this witness as             and conversation, and the account he gave of himself and his\nthe Frank Conrad who the plaintiffs claim had previously             family connections and associations. And evidence of these\ndisappeared. The evidence of this witness would have some            facts was from witnesses, it seems, who were not connected\nbearing upon the question of identity, and in rebutting the          with the family, and had no previous knowledge of its history.\npresumption of the death of Frank Conrad, which arose from           Our conclusion is that much of this testimony was admissible,\nhis disappearance since 1868.

See Vera v.\n         Perez, 884 S.W.2d 182, 184 (Tex.App.—Corpus Christi 1994, no writ); Jobe v. Lapidus, 874 S.W.2d 764, 766–68 (Tex.App.—Dallas\n         1994, writ denied); Warfield Elec. Of Texas, Inc. v. Harry Hines Prop. Venture, 871 S.W.2d 273, 275 (Tex.App.—Eastland 1994, no\n         writ). Another, however, has affirmed sanctions for filing a frivolous pleading imposed after a trial court's plenary jurisdiction expired,\n         reasoning that some collateral matters that do not affect the judgment on the merits may be considered outside the jurisdictional time\n         period. Wolma v. Gonzalez, 822 S.W.2d 302, 303 (Tex.App.—San Antonio 1991, orig. proceeding). We disapprove of Wolma to the\n         extent it holds that a trial court may sanction pre-judgment conduct after its plenary jurisdiction has expired.\n3        Since the United States Supreme Court decided Cooter & Gell, Rule 11 has been amended to create a safe harbor: “[A motion for\n         sanctions] shall be served as provided in Rule 5, but shall not be filed with or presented to the court unless, within 21 days after\n         service of the motion ... the challenged paper, claim, defense, contention, allegation, or denial is not withdrawn or appropriately\n         corrected.” FED.R.CIV.P. 11(c)(1)(A).\n\n\n\n\n                  © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In this situation, such evidence should be discoverable.\n6      We do not decide whether the documents were properly discoverable, only that the trial court erred in denying discovery based\n       solely on Russell. If the Walkers sought the documents solely to attack the credibility of Dr. Gilstrap by showing that his deposition\n       testimony was untrue, for instance, the information would probably not be reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Pope v. Stephenson, 787 S.W.2d 953\n      (Tex.1990). We explained: “The decision not to pursue the extraordinary remedy of mandamus does not prejudice or waive a party's\n      right to complain on appeal.” Id. at 954.\n10    Courts use a similar approach in determining whether a witness has properly invoked the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-\n      incrimination. It is often impossible for a witness to prove that an answer might incriminate him without actually answering and\n      thereby forfeiting the privilege. Therefore, rather than requiring actual proof of the privilege, courts sustain the privilege if it is\n      “evident from the implications of the question, in the setting in which it is asked, that a responsive answer [might be incriminating].”\n      Hoffman v. United States, 341 U.S. 479, 487, 71 S.Ct. 814, 818, 95 L.Ed. 1118 (1951).\n1     If the records have relevance apart from their potential for impeachment, however, Russell does not bar discovery. See Ex Parte\n      Shepperd, 513 S.W.2d 813, 816 (Tex.1974).\n1     Billie Holiday, God Bless the Child (Okeh Records 1941) (words and music by Arthur Herzog, Jr. & Billie Holiday).\n2     These entities rarely need information to prevail:\n            Even when an institutional litigant appears as a plaintiff suing an individual defendant as, for example, when a corporation sues\n            an individual on a debt, the institutional litigant tends to already have the information needed to prove its case.\n         Review of Discovery Orders at 1070 n. 162. They are also less likely to require information from an opponent to establish affirmative\n         defenses. Id. at 1070.\n3     With no appellate opinions setting forth appropriate limitations upon trial court discretion, “litigants may receive widely divergent\n      rulings from different judges, even in the same geographical location.” Id. at 1077. Proper use of mandamus discourages forum\n      shopping to obtain a trial judge more likely to provide a more favorable ruling and allows for greater consistency and accountability:\n            [Such] review ... even[s] out inconsistencies in trial court rulings, and ... allows trial judges to operate with a more accurate\n            understanding of the meaning of the discovery rules.... If the appellate court is consistent, it can fix disparities and inequities\n            produced by the trial courts and promote consistency among the trial level decisionmakers.\n         Id. at 1047, 1077 (footnotes omitted).\n4     Intermediate appellate courts have also recognized the importance of mandamus to avoid trial court abuse in improperly limiting or\n      denying discovery. See, e.g., Kentucky Fried Chicken Nat'l Mgmt. Co. v. Tennant, 782 S.W.2d 318 (Tex.App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n      1989, orig. proceeding) (writ granted when discovery of plaintiff's psychiatric records denied); Foster v.

Co. v. Dellana, 667 S.W.2d 911 (Tex.App.—Austin 1984, orig. proceeding)\n      (mandamus issued against trial court for denying discovery of claims files).\n5     The majority identifies by name five cases in conflict with today's writing, declaring that: “We disapprove of Barker and Allen, and\n      any other authorities,” at 842, and “[we] disapprove of Cleveland, Crane, Jampole, and any other authorities,” at 842, to the extent\n      they conflict with the new Walker standard. Subsumed within the “other” designation are a great number of additional cases from\n      this court and the courts of appeals that would grant to the Walkers relief when the trial court has clearly abused its discretion in\n      denying discovery. The court's willingness to sweepingly erase whole unidentified categories of recent precedent is exemplified by\n      their signing of a blank check: “any other authorities,” meaning all other authorities, are now endangered.\n6     The few cases citing Automatic Drilling do not expand its holding to that suggested by the court today. See Jampole, 673 S.W.2d\n      at 574–75 (“We hold that discovery cannot be denied because of an asserted proprietary interest in the requested documents when\n      a protective order would sufficiently preserve that interest.”); Firestone Photographs, Inc. v. Lamaster, 567 S.W.2d 273, 278\n      (Tex.Civ.App.—Texarkana 1978, no writ) (“[T]he claim of trade secrets ... does not necessarily defeat the right of discovery.”).\n7     James B. Sales, Pretrial Discovery in Texas Under the Amended Rules: Analysis and Commentary, 27 S.Tex.L.Rev. 305, 345–46\n      (1986), stating that:\n            Trade secrets ... are not, per se, exempt from discovery. The trial court is obligated to weigh the need for discovery against the\n            interests on secrecy.... The need to protect the confidentiality of documents does not constitute an absolute bar to discovery....\n8     Although also citing General Motors Corp. v. Lawrence, 651 S.W.2d 732 (Tex.1983, orig. proceeding), as allowing mandamus relief\n      from an allegedly burdensome trial court discovery order, the majority fails to note the very expansive discovery permitted in that\n      case. The efforts of General Motors to limit discovery to results from tests performed on the particular type of truck and the particular\n      type of impact involved in the subject incident were rejected, and it was directed to supply all impact test results for all types of\n      trucks manufactured over a 23–year period.\n9     If the trial court “refuses to make [the discovery] part of the record,” At 843, presumably the only relief accorded under today's\n      standard would be issuance of a writ directing inclusion of these materials.\n10    See Caller Times Publishing Co. v.

This Court ordered that the opinion not be published.\n       Rule 90(i) of the rules of appellate procedure provides, “Unpublished opinions shall not be cited as authority by counsel or by a\n       court.” TEX.R.APP. P. 90(i) (emphasis added). Appellees' citation to Tollack as authority in support of their argument is in clear\n       violation of this rule. Appellees and their counsel are cautioned not to violate this rule in the future.\n3      Appellants do not challenge this ruling as overbroad. Accordingly, we do not address this issue. We do not consider and we express\n       no opinion on the propriety of the order.\n4      On page iv of appellants' brief, this point of error is listed as the fourth point of error.\n5      Before bringing this appeal, appellants filed a motion for leave to file a writ of mandamus. That motion was summarily denied. The\n       statement of facts from the hearing on the motion to seal was delivered to the clerk of this Court as an exhibit to the petition for\n       writ of mandamus presented with the motion for leave to file. See TEX.R.APP. P. 121(a)(3), (4). No party to this appeal attempted\n       to make that statement of facts part of the record of this appeal or requested that we take judicial notice of the statement of facts.\n       Accordingly, we do not address the issue of whether the statement of facts is properly part of the records of this Court following the\n       denial of the motion for leave to file the petition for writ of mandamus.\n6      This is the point of error as stated on page 17 of appellants' brief immediately preceding the argument on the point of error. On\n       page iv of their brief, appellants state the third point of error as: “The trial court abused its discretion in failing to make a factual\n       determination on the motion to restrict use of and access to discovery pursuant to Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 76a and 166b(5)\n       (c).” Appellants do not argue the point as stated on page iv. Accordingly, we address the point of error as stated on page 17.\n7      Rule 76a permits a trial court to seal court records only when the movant makes the showing required by rule 76a. However, rule 76a\n       does not require the trial court to seal the record if the movant makes the 76a(1) showing. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 76a(1) (“court records ...\n       are presumed to be open ... and may be sealed only upon a showing of the [requirements of rule 76a(1)(a) & (b) ]” (emphasis added)).\n8      On page iv of appellants' brief, this point of error is listed as the second point of error.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Rule\n190.2 now applies to expedited actions, as defined by Rule 169. Rule 190.2 continues to apply to divorces not involving children\nin which the value of the marital estate is not more than $50,000, which are otherwise exempt from the expedited actions process.\nAmended Rule 190.2(b) ends the discovery period 180 days after the date the first discovery request is served; imposes a fifteen\nlimit maximum on interrogatories, requests for production, and requests for admission; and allows for additional disclosures.\nAlthough expedited actions are not subject to mandatory additional discovery under amended Rule 190.5, the court may still\nallow additional discovery if the conditions of Rule 190.5(a) are met.\n\n\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The signature of an attorney or party on a discovery\nrequest, notice, response, or objection constitutes a certification that to the best of the signer's knowledge, information, and\nbelief, formed after a reasonable inquiry, the request, notice, response, or objection:\n\n  (1) is consistent with the rules of civil procedure and these discovery rules and warranted by existing law or a good faith\n  argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law;\n\n  (2) has a good faith factual basis;\n\n  (3) is not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the\n  cost of litigation; and\n\n  (4) is not unreasonable or unduly burdensome or expensive, given the needs of the case, the discovery already had in the\n  case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation.\n\n(d) Effect of Failure to Sign. If a request, notice, response, or objection is not signed, it must be stricken unless it is signed\npromptly after the omission is called to the attention of the party making the request, notice, response, or objection. A party is\nnot required to take any action with respect to a request or notice that is not signed.\n\n(e) Sanctions. If the certification is false without substantial justification, the court may, upon motion or its own initiative, impose\non the person who made the certification, or the party on whose behalf the request, notice, response, or objection was made, or\nboth, an appropriate sanction as for a frivolous pleading or motion under Chapter 10 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code.\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

This had resulted from a number of causes, including the press of ever-increasing judicial\n     business and crowded court dockets, particularly in the more populous counties, and recognition of the fact that\n     traditional terms of court impeded the administration of justice by unnecessary delays and waste of time for the courts,\n     the litigants and the attorneys. In courts where rigid terms for holding court existed, the expiration of a term usually\n     meant that trials and judicial proceedings in progress came to an end, and that uncompleted trials and proceedings\n     had to be begun anew at a subsequent term. Motions for new trial had to be filed and considered, if at all, at the term\n     at which the case was tried; and on expiration of the term pending motions were overruled automatically by operation\n     of law, and if there was not enough time before the end of the term, the judgment was final without motion for new\n     trial; after the term had expired, the court had no control over judgments rendered during the term, and thereafter it\n     could not revise or set aside its judgments. 1 The underlying principle was that a court is without power to function\n     except during term time. During vacation, according to the traditional view, a court could engage only in corrective\n     and incidental proceedings, perform administrative functions and issue writs in extraordinary or ancillary proceedings\n     such as injunctions, mandamus, sequestration, garnishment and supersedeas as expressly authorized by statute. Under\n     this system, uncontested litigation and settlements could not be disposed of during vacation, the court being without\n     power to exercise judicial authority. Also, if terms of court were of several months duration, judgments rendered\n     during the early part of a term are a long time in becoming final since trial courts customarily retained jurisdiction\n     to revise or to set aside their judgments until the end of the term.\n\n     Relaxation of district court terms\n\n     The elimination of the rigid term concept as to district courts was brought about in a variety of ways by a series of\n     legislative enactments and rule changes extending over a period of many years. First, beginning with the authorization\n     given by the Constitution of 1876 2 to regulate terms of district courts the Legislature began to establish so called\n     “continuous terms” for district courts in the more populous counties, and this trend continued, with impetus by the\n     amendment of the Constitution of 1949, so that by 1952 the terms of most district courts had been made continuous.\n\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Time for Filing Motions, TX R RCP Rule 329b\n\n\n    The effect of these enactments was to require the district courts to which they applied to be in continuous session\n    throughout the year without any intervening vacation periods between terms, simply by providing for the beginning\n    of a new term immediately upon termination of the previous one. Then, from 1905 on district judges were given the\n    authority to avoid the inflexibility of conventional statutory terms by calling special terms for the purpose of disposing\n    of pending cases. 3 Likewise, after 1909 district courts had the authority to extend their statutory terms as to pending\n    cases where the trial was not completed before the end of the term, including disposition of the motion for new trial,\n    as well as conclusion of the trial on the merits; 4 and also, by consent of the parties, to try civil cases without a jury\n    in vacation and enter final judgments therein. 5\n\n    The Special Practice Act; Continuous Term Courts\n\n\n    In 1923 the Legislature passed the Special Practice Act, 6 which was first applicable in counties having two or more\n    civil district courts, and later by the 1939 amendment, in counties having five or more civil or criminal district courts.\n    This Act was the forerunner of Rule 330 and present practice under Rules 329a and 329b. Among other things the\n    Special Practice Act provided that a motion for new trial filed during one term of court could be heard and acted on\n    at the next, and that a case or other matter on trial or in process of hearing when the term of court expired, could be\n    proceeded with at the next term. It expressly stated that no motion for new trial or other motion or plea would be\n    considered waived or overruled because not passed on at the term at which it was filed, and that such matter could\n    be acted on at the succeeding term or at any time fixed by the judge or to which it may have been postponed by\n    agreement. Motions for new trial were required to be presented within 30 days and determined within 45 days unless\n    decision was postponed by agreement. Motions for new trial were required to be filed within 10 days after judgment,\n    and judgments were made final after the expiration of 30 days from rendition or overruling of motion for new trial\n    “as if the terms of court has expired”. These familiar provisions are readily recognized as the source of the procedural\n    rules above mentioned. Thus, under the Special Practice Act the end of the term was not fraught with all of the age-\n    old problems previously referred to, the ripening of completed cases into final judgment was placed on a reasonable\n    basis, and litigation which was in progress would automatically carry over into the next term, including the filing and\n    disposition of motions for new trial, without the necessity for extending the term under existing statutes.\n\n    In 1942 when the Rules of Civil Procedure became effective, there were 203 counties in the State in which district\n    courts did not have continuous terms. 7 The Rules were intended to broaden the application of the Special Practice Act,\n    and Rule 330 states that it applies in all district courts in counties where such courts have “successive terms throughout\n    the year, without more than two days intervening”. By 1952, as a result of successive legislative enactments converting\n    more district courts into continuous term courts, district by district, the Special Practice Act applied in approximately\n    eighty-five percent of the counties. 8\n\n    The 1955 amendments\n\n    The 1955 revision of Rules 320 and 330 and the adoption of new Rules 329-a and 329-b, effective January 1, sought\n    to achieve uniformity of practice in all district courts with respect to motions for new trial. Except as modified by the\n    new rules, Rules 320 and 330 did not contain any new matter; there was no change of substance in the matter that was\n    retained in those rules. The portions that were eliminated were covered by the newly adopted Rules 329-a and 329-b.\n\n    Rule 329a\n\n    Rule 329-a as promulgated applied only to County Courts, including County Courts at Law. The former practice with\n    respect to the filing and disposition of motions for new trial in those courts was unchanged.\n\n    Rule 329b\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Time for Filing Motions, TX R RCP Rule 329b\n\n\n\n\n    Under Rule 329-b the provisions of the former Special Practice Act were made applicable to all District Courts,\n    including those with non-continuous terms. The confusing variation with respect to the time for filing and determining\n    original and amended motions for new trial in District Courts having continuous terms and those whose terms were\n    limited by law, in such manner that there was an appreciable interval of time between terms, was abolished. With\n    some modification, the former provisions of sub-division (j) of Rule 330 were made applicable to all District Courts.\n    An original motion for new trial may be filed within ten days after the judgment or other order complained of is\n    rendered. [Subd. 1.] The 1961 amendment permits more than one postponement but none beyond 90 days after the\n    original or amended motion for new trial is filed; and by the concluding sentence of Section 4, also added by the\n    amendment, a postponed motion or amended motion is overruled by operation of law on expiration of 90 days after\n    it was filed or after the date to which it was postponed, whichever occurs first.\n\n    Amendment\n\n    With leave of court, the original motion for new trial may be amended within twenty days and only one amended\n    motion for new trial will be permitted. [Subd. 2.]\n\n    Continuous term courts\n\n    The former practice of hearing motions for new trial at a succeeding term in District Courts having continuous terms\n    is continued. [Subd. 6.] It is not necessary to secure an order extending a term of court for the purpose of hearing\n    and determining a motion for new trial in courts which do not have continuous terms because provision is made for\n    automatic extensions.\n\n    Presentation\n\n    One change of significance was made with respect to the presenting and determining of original and amended motions\n    for new trial. Under Rule 330, as previously worded, such motion had to be presented within thirty days after it was\n    filed. A number of District Judges throughout the State found that this arbitrary time limitation in some cases worked\n    a hardship on the Court, which might be engaged in an extended trial for several days prior to the expiration of such\n    time. In order to provide some flexibility, the District Judges were given discretion to permit the presenting of a\n    motion for new trial within an additional period of fifteen days. [Subd. 4.] It should be specifically noted that the\n    granting of this discretion did not extend the time for the determination of an original or an amended motion for new\n    trial beyond the period of forty-five days after its filing. Hence it will be seen that the new provision gave the Court\n    discretion to permit the presenting and to hear the motion within a period of an additional fifteen days and no more.\n\n    Postponement of hearing on motion\n\n    As was formerly the practice under Rule 330, the determination of the motion could be had after the forty-five day\n    period only by written agreement of the parties postponing the decision to “a later date”. [Subd. 3.]\n\n    Under the rule as amended in 1961, the agreement must specify the day to which decision is postponed, which may\n    not be more than 90 days after filing.\n\n    The 1961 amendment was intended to eliminate postponements to “a date convenient to the court” and similar\n    indefinite agreements. See Holland v. Foley Bros. Dry Goods Co., Inc., 324 S.W.2d 430, writ ref.\n\n    District courts with non-continuous terms\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Time for Filing Motions, TX R RCP Rule 329b\n\n\n    In subd. 7, it was provided that as to judgments rendered in non-continuous term courts within 30 days of the end of\n    the term, there is an automatic extension of the term so as to permit filing and disposition of motions and amended\n    motions for new trial within the time periods prescribed for continuous term courts, and that such judgments become\n    final at the end of 30 days from date of rendition or order overruling motion for new trial. Finally, Article 1919 was\n    amended, effective January 1, 1956, to provide that the terms of all district courts shall be continuous “notwithstanding\n    the provision of any law”. 9 This amendment rendered obsolete Section 7 of Rule 329b having application in district\n    courts without continuous terms since the terms of all district courts were now made continuous. The net effect of\n    these changes is that all civil actions in district courts in all counties are governed by the provisions of the Special\n    Practice Act as now written into Rules 329b and 330, and that terms of court no longer have any real significance in the\n    disposition of litigation in the district courts. The 1961 amendments deleted subd. 7 as it was originally promulgated,\n    and inserted a new subd. 7 extending the application of subd. 6 to county courts with non-continuous terms.\n\n    County court terms and their problems\n\n    In county courts, the progression toward doing away with terms of court did not parallel developments in the district\n    courts. This resulted in part from the Constitutional provision giving both the Legislature and the commissioners'\n    courts control of county court terms. 10 Under this provision the authority of the commissioners' courts is in some\n    respects recognized as superior to that of the Legislature and not subject to legislative restriction. 11 Unlike district\n    courts, county courts have not had the authority to extend their terms 12 nor to call special terms; in fact, legislation\n    authorizing the county judge to call special terms is unconstitutional. 13 While under the Constitution continuous\n    terms for the disposition of civil business may be established in the county court by authorization of the commissioners'\n    court, 14 this has been accomplished in some but not in most of the counties. In short, except in probate matters, 15\n    county courts have always had inflexible terms of court with the result that unfinished business did not carry over\n    beyond the end of the term or to the next term. Motions for new trial always had to be filed, if time permitted, by the\n    end of the term, and if not considered and disposed of by the court during the term such motions were overruled by\n    operation of law. 16 Judgments became final at the end of the term.\n\n\n    In county courts at law 17 the same concepts as to terms of court have prevailed as in the regular county courts, and\n    the motion for new trial practice has been identical. In some of the county courts at law, continuous terms of court\n    have been provided by the legislative enactments creating them, 18 but as in the case of county courts there are no\n    provisions for extension of terms as to uncompleted trials and hearings, or for unfinished matters carrying over into\n    the next term.\n\n    Special practice in county courts\n\n    The 1961 amendments of Rules 329a and 329b effective January 1, 1961, have made the district court practice with\n    respect to pending and unfinished matters and motions for new trial applicable in county courts in so far as it was\n    possible to do so. These rules in referring to county courts include both the constitutional county courts and county\n    courts at law. Under Rule 329a as now amended unfinished trials and all matters which are in process of hearing when\n    the term ends “may be proceeded with at the next or any subsequent term”, and no pleas or motions will be waived\n    or overruled automatically if not considered by the end of the term. Under Rule 329b original and amended motions\n    for new trial in the county court are to be filed and disposed of within the same time periods as have application in\n    the district court. The same extensions and other conditions for presentation and determination only. County court\n    judgments become final 30 days after judgment or order overruling the motion for new trial, and during this 30 day\n    period the county court retains control over its judgments, as in the district court. [Subd. 5.] The same rules apply\n    in county courts which have, as well as those which do not have continuous terms, except that in noncontinuous\n    term courts time periods ending during vacation are extended to the fifth day of the next term.

Time for Filing Motions, TX R RCP Rule 329b\n\n\n     Evidently the last mentioned provision is in recognition of the fact that such courts without continuous terms are\n     without power to act judicially in vacation.\n\n\n\nNotes of Decisions (2132)\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1             See, for example, Rule 320 as originally promulgated, regulating motions for new trial in district courts without continuous\n              terms, and Rule 329a prior to the 1960 amendment, pertaining to motion for new trial in county courts.

The primary disagreement between the\n\nparties now centers on whether or not the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to\n\nconsider the discovery order at issue and whether or not the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion with its discovery rulings.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\f                     COUNTER-ISSUES PRESENTED\n\nCounter-Issue One: The Court of Appeals does not have jurisdiction to\nconsider the discovery matters at issue in this case and the mandamus should\nbe dismissed because Relator has an adequate legal remedy.\n\nReply Point One: Assuming arguendo, that this court has jurisdiction of this\nmatter, Mandamus still fails, because Green has the right to inspect\ndocuments provided under the order and the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in maintaining its docket and court procedures.

(CR p. 8-14)1 During the pendency of the litigation, POC\n\nfiled a motion seeking protection from Green’s discovery actions on August 8,\n\n2014. (CR p. 114-130) One basis of the Motion was that Green was making\n\nduplicative requests for information to harass POC. (RR Vol. II, p. 5-15) A\n\nhearing was held on August 14, 2014, and after that, an order for protection was\n\ngranted. (CR p. 131-132)                                                                                                                                                                                                                            George Green was at that hearing and discussed\n\ndiscovery issues with Respondent. (RR Vol. II, p. 28)\n\n                                                           Subsequently, Green continued conduct POC believed violated the order of\n\nprotection. (CR p. 153-156) In response, POC filed a Motion to Enforce the Order\n\nof August 14, 2014. (CR p. 153-156) A hearing was held on that motion on\n\nOctober 14, 2014. (CR p. 175; RR Vol. III, p. 3) The Judge granted the Motion to\n\nEnforce the Protective Order and entered an order on October 21, 2014. (CR p. 175)\n\nThe record of the hearing on that Motion again details what Respondent expected\n\nof the parties. (RR Vol. II, p. 12-19) That is the order that was the subject of the\n\noriginal appeal. That order has been vacated.

(Supp. CR p. 4; Supp. RR p.\n\n4-30) On that date, the trial court again discussed the discovery issues at length\n\nwith the parties, working with them to try to fashion a further compromise in order\n\nto meet the concerns of both parties. (Supp. RR Vol. I, p. 4-31) As the record\n\nfrom that hearing makes clear, neither Respondent nor Real Parties In Interest were\n\nseeking to prevent Green from attending meetings of the Homeowners Association\n\n(“HOA”), voting in HOA elections or speaking at those meetings. (Supp. RR Vol.\n\nI, p. 6, 11, 15, 23) Indeed, Green had attended meetings of the Homeowners\n\nAssociation after the October 21, 2014 order. (Supp. RR Vol. I, p. 6) Rather,\n\nRespondent wanted to provide Relator the information allowable under the Bylaws\n\nand Codes, while preventing what he had found to be the harassing conduct of\n\nconstant demands for information and documents directly to POC.

First, the trial court vacated the earlier order Green\n\nsought to appeal. Second, the January 30, 2015 order concerns a discovery matter,\n\nthere is no final judgment and there is an adequate remedy at law.\n\n       Moreover, assuming arguendo that this Court has jurisdiction, the Trial\n\nCourt did not abuse its discretion in any action of which the Relator has\n\ncomplained, or seeks to complain. Respondent has authority to manage his docket\n\nand the discovery process for cases the parties have conferred jurisdiction upon it\n\nby filing a lawsuit. Moreover, the codes providing for information and document\n\nrequests require such requests be pursued reasonably and for a proper purpose.\n\nThe Respondent very clearly followed those principles in fashioning these orders.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f                    I. ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES\n\nA.    The Court of Appeals does not have jurisdiction to consider the\n      discovery matters at issue in this case and the mandamus should be\n      dismissed because Relator has an adequate legal remedy.\n\n      1.    The Court Should Reconsider its April 3, 2015 Order and Find\n            the Issue Moot Because the Order Complained of was Vacated.\n\n      Originally, Relator claimed to be seeking interlocutory review of an\n\ninjunction. However, properly understood, the order for which Green seeks relief\n\nis a discovery sanction. Wood v. James R. Moriarty, P.C., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1781146\"><a href=\"/opinion/1781146/wood-v-james-r-moriarty-pc/\"><span class=\"volume\">940</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">359</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.\n\nApp—Dallas, 1997, no pet). On January 30, 2015, a hearing was held in the\n\nDistrict Court and the District Court vacated the order of October 21, 2014, the\n\norder that was the subject of the pending interlocutory appeal. (Supp. CR p. 4)\n\n      POC has argued and here re-urges its argument that this court has the\n\nauthority to dismiss this appeal because the discovery order complained of has\n\nbeen vacated. In re Campbell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">788</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2003)(trial\n\ncourt order vacating earlier contempt order moots appeal because order no longer\n\nexists). For this reason, POC re-urges its argument that the Court of Appeals is\n\nwithout jurisdiction and the case should be dismissed. Tex. R. App. Pro. 42.3\n\n(Vernon 2003).\n\n      2.    The mandamus should be denied because this is a discovery\n            matter, there is no final appealable judgment and Relators have\n            an adequate remedy at law for the review of the Order.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f      This case involves questions about the discovery process undertaken by the\n\nparties and the court umpiring those actions in this civil case. There is no final\n\njudgment. Lehmann v. Har-Con Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1947466\"><a href=\"/opinion/1947466/lehmann-v-har-con-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 200 (Tex. 2001). Rather,\n\nGreen sought to proceed under the extraordinary remedy that is an interlocutory\n\nappeal. (CR p. 182-183) Subsequently, this Court allowed Green’s appeal to\n\nproceed as a mandamus action.\n\n      Consistent with the idea of judicial economy allowing review of trial court\n\nrulings under the discretionary standard of review, Green has a remedy at law for\n\nthe review of these discovery orders and that is available after judgment. Walker v.\n\nPacker, 827 S.W2d 833, 842 (Tex. 1992). The discussion between the parties and\n\nRespondent, about the Respondent’s interest for discovery in this case, weighing\n\ncosts to the court and parties clearly illustrates why discovery matters are not\n\nordinarily appealable during the pendency of the case. (Supp. RR Vol. I, p. 10-24)\n\nDiscovery sanctions are rarely the proper subject for mandamus review. Velez v.\n\nDelara, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">905</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.App.—San Antonio 1995, no writ). Even if the Court\n\nof Appeals had jurisdiction, the Respondent did not abuse his discretion with his\n\nruling in this case. And, if he did, the ruling is subject to review after judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fB.    Reply Point One: Assuming arguendo, that this court has\n      jurisdiction of this matter, Mandamus still fails, because Green\n      has the right to inspect documents provided under the order and\n      the trial court did not abuse its discretion in maintaining its\n      docket and court procedures. [Responsive to all Relator’s issues]\n\n      1.     Standard of Review\n\n      As Relator rightly concedes, a trial court has a broad range of discretion in\n\nmaintaining its docket and controlling discovery procedures with parties before the\n\ncourt. The proper standard of review for this matter is whether or not the trial\n\njudge abused his discretion. Johnson v. Fourth Court of Appeals, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2419359\"><a href=\"/opinion/2419359/johnson-v-fourth-court-of-appeals/\"><span class=\"volume\">700</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">916</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n917 (Tex. 1985). In order to establish that the trial judge abused his discretion, the\n\nreviewing court must consider he acted without reference to any guiding rules and\n\nprinciples, such that the act was arbitrary and unreasonable.

The court did not violate its discretionary authority to umpire\n             discovery matters before the court.\n\n      When standing for confirmation to the Supreme Court, Justice John Roberts\n\naptly described the proper role of the judge as the umpire of the judicial system,\n\nnot playing the game, but seeking to insure the parties operate fairly and in bounds.\n\nwww.Washingtonpost.com 6/28/2012, Chris Cillizza (visited 2/27). As the parties\n\nhere agree, that understanding is at the heart of the standard of review in this case.\n\nThe standard guides the Court of Appeals’ review. Applying that standard, it is\n\nclear the district judge did not abuse his discretion here.\n\n      Regardless of how the order at issue may be styled, it is not a final order as it\n\ndid not dispose of all parties and/or claims. Lehmann v. Har-Con, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1947466\"><a href=\"/opinion/1947466/lehmann-v-har-con-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n200 (Tex. 2001). Therefore, it is not a final judgment. Tex. R. Civ. Pro. 301. A\n\ntrial court retains jurisdiction over its docket, including the power to modify,\n\namend, or change interlocutory rulings and orders until it loses its plenary power.\n\nTex. R. Civ. Pro. 329b, Scott & White Memorial Hosp., v. Schexnider, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1781310\"><a href=\"/opinion/1781310/scott-white-mem-hosp-v-schexnider/\"><span class=\"volume\">940</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">594</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 596 (Tex. 1996). Accordingly, the trial court had authority to change this\n\ninterlocutory order in the way it did regardless of what it is called.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\f      3.    Green is not entitled to mandamus relief from Judge Garrett’s\n            January 30, 2015 discovery order because the Judge’s decision\n            was not arbitrary, it was reasonable, and does not violate Green’s\n            rights as a property owner derived from statute, bylaws or other\n            legal authority.\n\n            a.     George Green is not a property owner and therefore has no\n                   rights to inspect records under the statute, bylaws or other\n                   legal authority.\n\n      George Green brought this lawsuit by and through a Power of Attorney he\n\nhad from his father, Garlan Green, a property owner at Port of Call. (CR p. 8)\n\nRelator argued earlier that outside of the discovery context of the Texas Rules of\n\nCivil Procedure, he is entitled to information under the Property Code, the Texas\n\nBusiness Organizations Code and the Bylaws of the Association as a property\n\nowner.

See: Tex. Prop.\n\nCode §82.114 and Tex. Bus. Org. Code §22.351. (and/or their predecessors)\n\nFurther, no one has argued that POC has not followed and met its obligations under\n\nthese orders made by Respondent.       The January 30, 2015 order provides a\n\nreasonable procedure for POC to provide all statutorily required documents and\n\nother discovery.\n\n      The apparent question before the court in this Mandamus proceeding is\n\nwhether the Relator abused his discretion to control extra-judicial discovery\n\nrequests incident to a lawsuit. See Court of Appeals Order of April 3, 2015 p. 2.\n\nThe Court has asked POC to address the power of the court to control document\n\nand information requests existing beyond the ordinary discovery vehicles described\n\nin the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. Initially, the Court of Appeals should\n\nrecognize that the Respondent did not abuse his discretion in finding Green had not\n\nexercised his rights for a proper purpose, but rather had been using them to harass\n\nthe Association.\n\n      At the commencement of this lawsuit, Green sent POC significant discovery,\n\nincluding extensive requests for production of documents. (RR Vol. II, p. 51)\n\nThese requests included information a property owner is entitled to inspect by\n\nstatute, as well as additional information. (Id.) The Texas Property Code, Texas\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fBusiness Organization Code, and the Port of Call Homeowners Association\n\nBylaws themselves only require that documents requested be produced for\n\ninspection, and possibly copying. Tex. Prop. Code §82.114; Tex. Bus. Org. Code\n\n§22.351. However, Relator also requested the documents in his Requests for\n\nProduction and his attorney has taken the position that inspection is not sufficient\n\nbut rather the documents needed to be “produced.” (RR Vol. II, p. 51) POC\n\ncounsel has produced to Green all non-privileged documents in their actual and\n\nconstructive possession relating to the Home Owners Association, these documents\n\ndated back to 1998 and totaled over 16,000 pages. (RR Vol. II, p. 19)\n\n      Ultimately POC sought relief from Green’s constant demands in the form of\n\na protective order. (CR p. 114) The Respondent determined that the constant\n\ndemand to the POC for more documents, additional documents and to re-review\n\ndocuments previously produced, was harassing. (RR Vol. II, p. 29, 53; RR Vol. II,\n\np. 13-19; Supp. RR p. 8-30) Subsequently, POC filed a Motion to Enforce the\n\norder believing Green had violated the earlier ruling. (CR p. 153) After a series of\n\nhearings, the Order of January 30, 2015 was entered. (Supp. CR Vol. I, p. 5) It\n\nrequires “Defendants [POC] supplement document responsive to Plaintiff’s [Green]\n\nprevious discovery requests made by Plaintiff every sixty (60) days ... Such\n\nsupplementation shall occur without prompting or request by Plaintiff, and shall\n\ninclude any Port of Call Homeowners Association-related documents that\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fmembers may lawfully request due to their status as HOA members.” (Supp. CR\n\nVol. I, p. 5) (Emphasis added)\n\n      Clearly, the court can sanction parties under the discovery rules of the Texas\n\nRules of Civil Procedure, when parties are abusing discovery. See generally: Tex.\n\nR. Civ. Pro. 190.5 (Vernon Supp. 2014), Tex. R. Civ. Pro. 191.1 (Vernon 2004),\n\nTex. R. Civ. Pro. 192.4 (Vernon 2004), Tex. R. Civ. Pro. 192.6 (Vernon 2004), and\n\nTex. R. Civ. Pro. 215.3 (Vernon 2004). Indeed, the court can undertake such action\n\nsua sponte. See Tex. R. Civ. Pro. 191.3(e) (Vernon 2004). Further, the court can\n\nmodify a discovery period developed under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure at\n\nanytime, and it must do so when justice requires it. Tex. R. Civ. Pro. 190.5.\n\n(Emphasis added) Those rules further describe that discovery may be limited by\n\nthe court, and should be limited by the court if it determines, on motion or its own\n\ninitiative, that discovery requests are duplicative or otherwise harmful. Tex. R. Civ.\n\nPro. 192.4.\n\n      Properly understood, this power of the court to umpire the parties’ discovery\n\nefforts must extend to extra judicial discovery processes in other statutory\n\nframeworks, like the Texas Property Code and the Texas Business Organizations\n\nCode. Courts have recognized this.

Indeed, even the\n\nstructure of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure themselves support this\n\nunderstanding, because the power of the court to sanction, limit or otherwise\n\nmodify discovery requests found in Tex. R. Civ. Pro. 192.6(a) and 192.6(b)(4) is\n\nnot limited to “these rules” (i.e., the discovery processes of the Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure). The drafters of those rules could have limited that provision to the\n\ndiscovery in the Rules of Civil Procedure had they wanted to. They did not. Thus,\n\nthat power is not circumscribed.      See:    Gaughn v. National Cutting Horse\n\nAssociation, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">408</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.App.—Ft. Worth 2011, pet. for review denied).\n\n      In addition, Tex. R. Civ. Pro. 191.3(c) provides that the signature of a party\n\nto a “discovery request” implies that the request, among other things, is not\n\nharassing. If a court determines otherwise it may impose a sanction on the person\n\nwho made the certification by signature. Tex. R. Civ. Pro. 191.3(e). Again, that\n\njudicial power is not limited to “these rules” and the discovery vehicles described\n\nin the Rules of Civil Procedure. Therefore, the judicial discretion built into the\n\nsystem via the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure can be applied to discovery matters\n\nbeyond those rules. See: Gaughn v.

Respondent\n\nearlier determined that Green had violated his discovery order of August 14, 2014\n\nand continued harassing POC. (CR p. 175; Supp. RR Vol. I, p. 8; RR Vol. II,\n\np. 12-19)\n\n       It is not crystal clear all of the statutory schemes the Relator believes provide\n\nhim the right of immediate inspection of records from his father’s Homeowners\n\nAssociation. In the hearing of August 14, 2014, Relator’s counsel urged Texas\n\nBusiness and Organizations Code §252.010 and §22.351. (RR Vol. II, p. 40 - 45)\n\nFurthermore, the Texas Property Code §82.114 is referenced in the Bylaws and\n\nthus also of likely application. (RR Vol. II, p. 40) Moreover, §81.209 of the Texas\n\nProperty Code may too apply. Each of these is discussed below.\n\n       The Texas Property Code §82.114(b) requires an association keep “all\n\nfinancial and other records of the association…reasonably available…for\n\nexamination by a unit owner and the owner’s agents.” Tex. Prop. Code §82.114\n\n(Vernon’s 2014). (Emphasis added) The same reasonableness provision is\n\nincorporated into the Port of Call Homeowner’s Association Bylaws by reference.\n\n(RR Vol. II, p. 40) Section 81.2093 of the Property Code has been interpreted to\n\nmean a homeowner may inspect records unless the request is for an improper\n\n3\n  §81.209 applies to those regimes created before January 1, 1994. POC was created in 1980, it\nis possible it has application to this case.\n\n                                             -17-\n\fpurpose. Burton v.

Pleading as a further alternative, POC prays that the Court sustain their\n\ncounterpoint as an alternative ground for affirming the order of the trial court.\n\nPOC prays for such other relief both at law or equity to which it may be justly\n\nentitled.\n\n                                          Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                          WRIGHT & GREENHILL, P.C.\n                                          221 West 6th Street, Suite 1800\n                                          Austin, Texas 78701\n                                          512/476-4600\n                                          512/476-5382\n                                          rpringle@w-g.com\n                                          hcoughlin@w-g.com\n                                          mthompson@w-g.com\n\n                                           /s/ Brantley Ross Pringle, Jr.\n                                          By:_____________________________\n                                             Brantley Ross Pringle, Jr.\n                                             State Bar No. 16330001\n                                             Heidi A.

In that pleading, Tracy contended sanctions were warranted because Ezeoke falsely alleged that the suit to modify was\n       filed within one year after the rendition of the order sought to be modified. Tracy filed a First Amended Answer to Motion to Deny\n       Relief in Suit to Modify Parent–Child relationship and Request for Sanctions on June 3, 2009. In this pleading, Tracy contended\n       sanctions were warranted because Ezeoke (1) falsely alleged that the motion to modify was filed within one year after rendition of\n       the order sought to be modified; and (2) failed to serve a copy of an Amended Motion to Deny Relief in Suit to Modify Parent–Child\n       relationship when it was filed on May 14, 2009. There is no indication in the appellate record that the trial court ruled on either of\n       the two earlier sanctions requests.\n2      As filed, the January 4, 2010 motion sought sanctions against both Ezeoke and his client, Jossie Herrera. During the hearing on January\n       11, 2010, Tracy clarified that she sought sanctions solely on behalf of her professional corporation, “Cynthia Tracy, Attorney–at–\n       Law, P.C.,” and not on behalf of her client. Tracy also clarified that she was requesting sanctions solely against Ezeoke individually\n       and not against his client, Jossie Herrera.\n3      As a threshold matter, we reject Tracy's contention that Ezeoke waived all challenges to the imposition of sanctions because he did\n       not object to the imposition of sanctions before or at the sanctions hearing. The motion for sanctions was filed on January 4, 2010,\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

A “reasonable opportunity to respond” to a sanctions request contemplates something more than the chance to ask\n      one trial court judge to reverse sanctions that already have been imposed by another trial court judge.\n5     In light of this remand, we express no opinion regarding (1) the trial court's finding that Ezeoke included “unfounded accusations,\n      misrepresentations, and name-calling of opposing counsel” in the motion for continuance; or (2) Ezeoke's contentions on appeal\n      regarding this finding.

He is a party to this appeal because\n       he and Gaughan are jointly and severally liable under the trial court's judgment for the NCHA's attorney's fees.\n2      The written request actually cited Texas Business Organizations Code section 22.351, the successor to article 1396–2.23. See Tex.\n       Bus. Org.Code Ann. § 22.351 (West 2009).

That statute, which is applicable to for-profit corporations, is\n       similar to article 1396.–2.23, which is applicable to non-profit corporations and at issue in this case. Texas courts have looked to\n       precedent under article 2.44 when dealing with issues presented under article 1396–2.23. See CASE, 886 S.W.2d at 289.\n7      Gaughan does not contend that she has been denied the opportunity to inspect confidential or attorney-client communications, but\n       the broader principle revealed by BACALA, Huie, CASE, PMI, and similar opinions—that the scope of the right of inspection for\n       members of a non-profit corporation may be limited by legitimate considerations of privilege, trade secrets, and confidentiality—as\n       well as the differing access granted to members and the public under articles 1396–2.23 and 1396–2.23A, reveals that even members\n       of a non-profit corporation do not have unfettered access to the non-profit's corporate records.\n8      Gaughan's first issue contends that the trial court erred by declaring that the NCHA's “financial records” are entitled to confidential\n       treatment, but it is clear from Gaughan's briefing on appeal and in the trial court that she contends that the trial court erred by entering\n       the protective order concerning any of the records she requested from the NCHA. As discussed above, however, Gaughan requested\n       and received records that a non-member may not inspect.\n9      We do not reach the issues of whether the NCHA met its burden of establishing confidentiality as to particular categories of records,\n       or whether a non-member may disseminate to other non-members information received pursuant to article 1396–2.23A. Those issues\n       are not before us given the unique procedural posture of this case and Gaughan's request that the trial court declare that all records\n       produced by the NCHA are not confidential despite her receipt of documents to which a non-member does not have the right to\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Chenault also named several business associates of Huie as additional defendants.\n2      The trial court initially relied on Texas Rule of Civil Evidence 503(d)(5), which creates an exception to the attorney-client privilege\n       as between joint clients of an attorney regarding matters of common interest to the clients. The court, however, later amended its\n       order to delete this reference.\n3      Chenault argues for the first time in a post-submission brief that Ringer represented the trust itself as an entity, rather than Huie as\n       trustee. This argument is addressed in section III–B below.\n4      Chenault also argues that Huie, by accepting the appointment as trustee with knowledge of his duty of disclosure, impliedly waived\n       the protection of the attorney-client privilege. Because we conclude that a trustee does not violate the duty of full disclosure by\n       invoking the attorney-client privilege, we reject this waiver argument.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                     © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

I (“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;\n        or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government\n        for a redress of grievances.”).\n6       The taxpayers assert that the trial court's protective order, which limits the use of the donor information to litigation purposes\n        only, alleviates any First Amendment concerns. A protective order allows a court to grant disclosure rights while deferring to First\n        Amendment concerns. Ex parte Lowe, 887 S.W.2d at 4. Especially when the information is sought by private litigants, the existence of\n        a protective order limiting dissemination of the information to litigation purposes may be a factor to be considered when determining\n        whether disclosure is justified, although the protective order “itself does not justify disclosure.” Id. However, the protective order in\n        this case does not alleviate BACALA's First Amendment concerns because the taxpayers' lawyers, who would receive the information\n        under the protective order, are the very persons who have made some of the boycott threats.\n7       TEX.REV.CIV.

The state interest served by the statute is\n        ensuring the accountability of non-profit corporations for expenditures of contributions. Even if this interest is a compelling state\n        interest, there is no “substantial relation” between requiring disclosure of contributors' identities and ensuring such accountability.

As we have repeatedly admonished—in Mafrige, in\n       Aldridge, and even in the Court's opinion today—the rules governing finality after a conventional trial are wholly inappropriate for\n       determining finality of summary judgments.

See TEX.R.APP. P. 47.7.\n3      This issue also arises when a trial court expressly mentions and disposes of a party even though that party was not mentioned in the\n       motion for summary judgment. Here, the lower courts have been more willing to apply Mafrige and hold that the order purports to\n       dispose of all parties and issues. See, e.g., Mikulich v. Perez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2468697\"><a href=\"/opinion/2468697/mikulich-v-perez/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 91–92 (Tex.App.—San Antonio 1996, no writ).\n4      In fact, the district clerk sent all the parties (including those omitted from the summary judgment order) a postcard indicating that an\n       “Order for Interlocutory Summary Judgment” had been signed. Lehmann, 988 S.W.2d at 416.\n5      Oftentimes in these cases litigation continues to move forward. Any error in including magic finality language in a summary judgment\n       is not discovered until it is too late; the appellate timetable has expired and the trial court has lost plenary power to act. The litigants\n       have forever lost their right to complain of the judgment.\n6      It would not be enough for a court to generally state “plaintiff takes nothing,” “defendant is granted summary judgment in all things,”\n       or “this is a final appealable judgment.” Conclusory finality clauses (i.e. “magic language”) do not indicate that a trial court actually\n       granted relief not requested for or against parties or issues are not mentioned in the order.\n7      Of course, this procedure would not apply if the order fell within the category of cases for which there can be more than one final\n       judgment, or the category of orders for which a court of appeals has been granted statutory authority to review interlocutory orders.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                       © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Because we find that the Walkers have failed to establish the requirements for mandamus relief, we\n       do not reach this issue.\n2      The court also sustained Aetna's motion to quash, holding that the discovery requested was improper under the investigation\n       exemption, the attorney-client privilege, and the work-product privilege. The Walkers do not complain to us about this ruling.\n3      Even if no evidence had been presented, the Walkers would have had the burden of filing an affidavit so stating.

Tex.R.Civ.Evid. 613(b). To date,\n       however, Dr. Gilstrap has not admitted any bias, but rather has flatly denied it. In this situation, such evidence should be discoverable.\n6      We do not decide whether the documents were properly discoverable, only that the trial court erred in denying discovery based\n       solely on Russell. If the Walkers sought the documents solely to attack the credibility of Dr. Gilstrap by showing that his deposition\n       testimony was untrue, for instance, the information would probably not be reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Id. at 1070.\n3     With no appellate opinions setting forth appropriate limitations upon trial court discretion, “litigants may receive widely divergent\n      rulings from different judges, even in the same geographical location.” Id. at 1077. Proper use of mandamus discourages forum\n      shopping to obtain a trial judge more likely to provide a more favorable ruling and allows for greater consistency and accountability:\n            [Such] review ... even[s] out inconsistencies in trial court rulings, and ... allows trial judges to operate with a more accurate\n            understanding of the meaning of the discovery rules.... If the appellate court is consistent, it can fix disparities and inequities\n            produced by the trial courts and promote consistency among the trial level decisionmakers.\n         Id. at 1047, 1077 (footnotes omitted).\n4     Intermediate appellate courts have also recognized the importance of mandamus to avoid trial court abuse in improperly limiting or\n      denying discovery.

This Court ordered that the opinion not be published.\n       Rule 90(i) of the rules of appellate procedure provides, “Unpublished opinions shall not be cited as authority by counsel or by a\n       court.” TEX.R.APP. P. 90(i) (emphasis added). Appellees' citation to Tollack as authority in support of their argument is in clear\n       violation of this rule. Appellees and their counsel are cautioned not to violate this rule in the future.\n3      Appellants do not challenge this ruling as overbroad. Accordingly, we do not address this issue. We do not consider and we express\n       no opinion on the propriety of the order.\n4      On page iv of appellants' brief, this point of error is listed as the fourth point of error.\n5      Before bringing this appeal, appellants filed a motion for leave to file a writ of mandamus. That motion was summarily denied. The\n       statement of facts from the hearing on the motion to seal was delivered to the clerk of this Court as an exhibit to the petition for\n       writ of mandamus presented with the motion for leave to file. See TEX.R.APP. P. 121(a)(3), (4). No party to this appeal attempted\n       to make that statement of facts part of the record of this appeal or requested that we take judicial notice of the statement of facts.\n       Accordingly, we do not address the issue of whether the statement of facts is properly part of the records of this Court following the\n       denial of the motion for leave to file the petition for writ of mandamus.\n6      This is the point of error as stated on page 17 of appellants' brief immediately preceding the argument on the point of error. On\n       page iv of their brief, appellants state the third point of error as: “The trial court abused its discretion in failing to make a factual\n       determination on the motion to restrict use of and access to discovery pursuant to Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 76a and 166b(5)\n       (c).” Appellants do not argue the point as stated on page iv. Accordingly, we address the point of error as stated on page 17.\n7      Rule 76a permits a trial court to seal court records only when the movant makes the showing required by rule 76a.

Rule\n190.2 now applies to expedited actions, as defined by Rule 169. Rule 190.2 continues to apply to divorces not involving children\nin which the value of the marital estate is not more than $50,000, which are otherwise exempt from the expedited actions process.\nAmended Rule 190.2(b) ends the discovery period 180 days after the date the first discovery request is served; imposes a fifteen\nlimit maximum on interrogatories, requests for production, and requests for admission; and allows for additional disclosures.\nAlthough expedited actions are not subject to mandatory additional discovery under amended Rule 190.5, the court may still\nallow additional discovery if the conditions of Rule 190.5(a) are met.\n\n\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The signature of an attorney or party on a disclosure constitutes a certification that to\nthe best of the signer's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after a reasonable inquiry, the disclosure is complete and\ncorrect as of the time it is made.\n\n(c) Effect of Signature on Discovery Request, Notice, Response, or Objection. The signature of an attorney or party on a discovery\nrequest, notice, response, or objection constitutes a certification that to the best of the signer's knowledge, information, and\nbelief, formed after a reasonable inquiry, the request, notice, response, or objection:\n\n  (1) is consistent with the rules of civil procedure and these discovery rules and warranted by existing law or a good faith\n  argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law;\n\n  (2) has a good faith factual basis;\n\n  (3) is not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the\n  cost of litigation; and\n\n  (4) is not unreasonable or unduly burdensome or expensive, given the needs of the case, the discovery already had in the\n  case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation.\n\n(d) Effect of Failure to Sign. If a request, notice, response, or objection is not signed, it must be stricken unless it is signed\npromptly after the omission is called to the attention of the party making the request, notice, response, or objection. A party is\nnot required to take any action with respect to a request or notice that is not signed.\n\n(e) Sanctions. If the certification is false without substantial justification, the court may, upon motion or its own initiative, impose\non the person who made the certification, or the party on whose behalf the request, notice, response, or objection was made, or\nboth, an appropriate sanction as for a frivolous pleading or motion under Chapter 10 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code.\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Every disclosure, discovery request, notice, response, and objection must be signed:\n\n  (1) by an attorney, if the party is represented by an attorney, and must show the attorney's State Bar of Texas identification\n  number, address, telephone number, and fax number, if any; or\n\n  (2) by the party, if the party is not represented by an attorney, and must show the party's address, telephone number, and\n  fax number, if any.\n\n(b) Effect of Signature on Disclosure. The signature of an attorney or party on a disclosure constitutes a certification that to\nthe best of the signer's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after a reasonable inquiry, the disclosure is complete and\ncorrect as of the time it is made.\n\n(c) Effect of Signature on Discovery Request, Notice, Response, or Objection. The signature of an attorney or party on a discovery\nrequest, notice, response, or objection constitutes a certification that to the best of the signer's knowledge, information, and\nbelief, formed after a reasonable inquiry, the request, notice, response, or objection:\n\n  (1) is consistent with the rules of civil procedure and these discovery rules and warranted by existing law or a good faith\n  argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law;\n\n  (2) has a good faith factual basis;\n\n  (3) is not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the\n  cost of litigation; and\n\n  (4) is not unreasonable or unduly burdensome or expensive, given the needs of the case, the discovery already had in the\n  case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation.\n\n(d) Effect of Failure to Sign. If a request, notice, response, or objection is not signed, it must be stricken unless it is signed\npromptly after the omission is called to the attention of the party making the request, notice, response, or objection. A party is\nnot required to take any action with respect to a request or notice that is not signed.\n\n(e) Sanctions. If the certification is false without substantial justification, the court may, upon motion or its own initiative, impose\non the person who made the certification, or the party on whose behalf the request, notice, response, or objection was made, or\nboth, an appropriate sanction as for a frivolous pleading or motion under Chapter 10 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code.\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

This had resulted from a number of causes, including the press of ever-increasing judicial\n     business and crowded court dockets, particularly in the more populous counties, and recognition of the fact that\n     traditional terms of court impeded the administration of justice by unnecessary delays and waste of time for the courts,\n     the litigants and the attorneys. In courts where rigid terms for holding court existed, the expiration of a term usually\n     meant that trials and judicial proceedings in progress came to an end, and that uncompleted trials and proceedings\n     had to be begun anew at a subsequent term. Motions for new trial had to be filed and considered, if at all, at the term\n     at which the case was tried; and on expiration of the term pending motions were overruled automatically by operation\n     of law, and if there was not enough time before the end of the term, the judgment was final without motion for new\n     trial; after the term had expired, the court had no control over judgments rendered during the term, and thereafter it\n     could not revise or set aside its judgments. 1 The underlying principle was that a court is without power to function\n     except during term time. During vacation, according to the traditional view, a court could engage only in corrective\n     and incidental proceedings, perform administrative functions and issue writs in extraordinary or ancillary proceedings\n     such as injunctions, mandamus, sequestration, garnishment and supersedeas as expressly authorized by statute. Under\n     this system, uncontested litigation and settlements could not be disposed of during vacation, the court being without\n     power to exercise judicial authority. Also, if terms of court were of several months duration, judgments rendered\n     during the early part of a term are a long time in becoming final since trial courts customarily retained jurisdiction\n     to revise or to set aside their judgments until the end of the term.\n\n     Relaxation of district court terms\n\n     The elimination of the rigid term concept as to district courts was brought about in a variety of ways by a series of\n     legislative enactments and rule changes extending over a period of many years. First, beginning with the authorization\n     given by the Constitution of 1876 2 to regulate terms of district courts the Legislature began to establish so called\n     “continuous terms” for district courts in the more populous counties, and this trend continued, with impetus by the\n     amendment of the Constitution of 1949, so that by 1952 the terms of most district courts had been made continuous.\n\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Time for Filing Motions, TX R RCP Rule 329b\n\n\n    The effect of these enactments was to require the district courts to which they applied to be in continuous session\n    throughout the year without any intervening vacation periods between terms, simply by providing for the beginning\n    of a new term immediately upon termination of the previous one. Then, from 1905 on district judges were given the\n    authority to avoid the inflexibility of conventional statutory terms by calling special terms for the purpose of disposing\n    of pending cases. 3 Likewise, after 1909 district courts had the authority to extend their statutory terms as to pending\n    cases where the trial was not completed before the end of the term, including disposition of the motion for new trial,\n    as well as conclusion of the trial on the merits; 4 and also, by consent of the parties, to try civil cases without a jury\n    in vacation and enter final judgments therein. 5\n\n    The Special Practice Act; Continuous Term Courts\n\n\n    In 1923 the Legislature passed the Special Practice Act, 6 which was first applicable in counties having two or more\n    civil district courts, and later by the 1939 amendment, in counties having five or more civil or criminal district courts.\n    This Act was the forerunner of Rule 330 and present practice under Rules 329a and 329b. Among other things the\n    Special Practice Act provided that a motion for new trial filed during one term of court could be heard and acted on\n    at the next, and that a case or other matter on trial or in process of hearing when the term of court expired, could be\n    proceeded with at the next term. It expressly stated that no motion for new trial or other motion or plea would be\n    considered waived or overruled because not passed on at the term at which it was filed, and that such matter could\n    be acted on at the succeeding term or at any time fixed by the judge or to which it may have been postponed by\n    agreement. Motions for new trial were required to be presented within 30 days and determined within 45 days unless\n    decision was postponed by agreement. Motions for new trial were required to be filed within 10 days after judgment,\n    and judgments were made final after the expiration of 30 days from rendition or overruling of motion for new trial\n    “as if the terms of court has expired”. These familiar provisions are readily recognized as the source of the procedural\n    rules above mentioned. Thus, under the Special Practice Act the end of the term was not fraught with all of the age-\n    old problems previously referred to, the ripening of completed cases into final judgment was placed on a reasonable\n    basis, and litigation which was in progress would automatically carry over into the next term, including the filing and\n    disposition of motions for new trial, without the necessity for extending the term under existing statutes.\n\n    In 1942 when the Rules of Civil Procedure became effective, there were 203 counties in the State in which district\n    courts did not have continuous terms. 7 The Rules were intended to broaden the application of the Special Practice Act,\n    and Rule 330 states that it applies in all district courts in counties where such courts have “successive terms throughout\n    the year, without more than two days intervening”. By 1952, as a result of successive legislative enactments converting\n    more district courts into continuous term courts, district by district, the Special Practice Act applied in approximately\n    eighty-five percent of the counties. 8\n\n    The 1955 amendments\n\n    The 1955 revision of Rules 320 and 330 and the adoption of new Rules 329-a and 329-b, effective January 1, sought\n    to achieve uniformity of practice in all district courts with respect to motions for new trial. Except as modified by the\n    new rules, Rules 320 and 330 did not contain any new matter; there was no change of substance in the matter that was\n    retained in those rules. The portions that were eliminated were covered by the newly adopted Rules 329-a and 329-b.\n\n    Rule 329a\n\n    Rule 329-a as promulgated applied only to County Courts, including County Courts at Law. The former practice with\n    respect to the filing and disposition of motions for new trial in those courts was unchanged.\n\n    Rule 329b\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Time for Filing Motions, TX R RCP Rule 329b\n\n\n\n\n    Under Rule 329-b the provisions of the former Special Practice Act were made applicable to all District Courts,\n    including those with non-continuous terms. The confusing variation with respect to the time for filing and determining\n    original and amended motions for new trial in District Courts having continuous terms and those whose terms were\n    limited by law, in such manner that there was an appreciable interval of time between terms, was abolished. With\n    some modification, the former provisions of sub-division (j) of Rule 330 were made applicable to all District Courts.\n    An original motion for new trial may be filed within ten days after the judgment or other order complained of is\n    rendered. [Subd. 1.] The 1961 amendment permits more than one postponement but none beyond 90 days after the\n    original or amended motion for new trial is filed; and by the concluding sentence of Section 4, also added by the\n    amendment, a postponed motion or amended motion is overruled by operation of law on expiration of 90 days after\n    it was filed or after the date to which it was postponed, whichever occurs first.\n\n    Amendment\n\n    With leave of court, the original motion for new trial may be amended within twenty days and only one amended\n    motion for new trial will be permitted. [Subd. 2.]\n\n    Continuous term courts\n\n    The former practice of hearing motions for new trial at a succeeding term in District Courts having continuous terms\n    is continued. [Subd. 6.] It is not necessary to secure an order extending a term of court for the purpose of hearing\n    and determining a motion for new trial in courts which do not have continuous terms because provision is made for\n    automatic extensions.\n\n    Presentation\n\n    One change of significance was made with respect to the presenting and determining of original and amended motions\n    for new trial. Under Rule 330, as previously worded, such motion had to be presented within thirty days after it was\n    filed. A number of District Judges throughout the State found that this arbitrary time limitation in some cases worked\n    a hardship on the Court, which might be engaged in an extended trial for several days prior to the expiration of such\n    time. In order to provide some flexibility, the District Judges were given discretion to permit the presenting of a\n    motion for new trial within an additional period of fifteen days. [Subd. 4.] It should be specifically noted that the\n    granting of this discretion did not extend the time for the determination of an original or an amended motion for new\n    trial beyond the period of forty-five days after its filing. Hence it will be seen that the new provision gave the Court\n    discretion to permit the presenting and to hear the motion within a period of an additional fifteen days and no more.\n\n    Postponement of hearing on motion\n\n    As was formerly the practice under Rule 330, the determination of the motion could be had after the forty-five day\n    period only by written agreement of the parties postponing the decision to “a later date”. [Subd. 3.]\n\n    Under the rule as amended in 1961, the agreement must specify the day to which decision is postponed, which may\n    not be more than 90 days after filing.\n\n    The 1961 amendment was intended to eliminate postponements to “a date convenient to the court” and similar\n    indefinite agreements.

Time for Filing Motions, TX R RCP Rule 329b\n\n\n    In subd. 7, it was provided that as to judgments rendered in non-continuous term courts within 30 days of the end of\n    the term, there is an automatic extension of the term so as to permit filing and disposition of motions and amended\n    motions for new trial within the time periods prescribed for continuous term courts, and that such judgments become\n    final at the end of 30 days from date of rendition or order overruling motion for new trial. Finally, Article 1919 was\n    amended, effective January 1, 1956, to provide that the terms of all district courts shall be continuous “notwithstanding\n    the provision of any law”. 9 This amendment rendered obsolete Section 7 of Rule 329b having application in district\n    courts without continuous terms since the terms of all district courts were now made continuous. The net effect of\n    these changes is that all civil actions in district courts in all counties are governed by the provisions of the Special\n    Practice Act as now written into Rules 329b and 330, and that terms of court no longer have any real significance in the\n    disposition of litigation in the district courts. The 1961 amendments deleted subd. 7 as it was originally promulgated,\n    and inserted a new subd. 7 extending the application of subd. 6 to county courts with non-continuous terms.\n\n    County court terms and their problems\n\n    In county courts, the progression toward doing away with terms of court did not parallel developments in the district\n    courts. This resulted in part from the Constitutional provision giving both the Legislature and the commissioners'\n    courts control of county court terms. 10 Under this provision the authority of the commissioners' courts is in some\n    respects recognized as superior to that of the Legislature and not subject to legislative restriction. 11 Unlike district\n    courts, county courts have not had the authority to extend their terms 12 nor to call special terms; in fact, legislation\n    authorizing the county judge to call special terms is unconstitutional. 13 While under the Constitution continuous\n    terms for the disposition of civil business may be established in the county court by authorization of the commissioners'\n    court, 14 this has been accomplished in some but not in most of the counties. In short, except in probate matters, 15\n    county courts have always had inflexible terms of court with the result that unfinished business did not carry over\n    beyond the end of the term or to the next term. Motions for new trial always had to be filed, if time permitted, by the\n    end of the term, and if not considered and disposed of by the court during the term such motions were overruled by\n    operation of law. 16 Judgments became final at the end of the term.\n\n\n    In county courts at law 17 the same concepts as to terms of court have prevailed as in the regular county courts, and\n    the motion for new trial practice has been identical. In some of the county courts at law, continuous terms of court\n    have been provided by the legislative enactments creating them, 18 but as in the case of county courts there are no\n    provisions for extension of terms as to uncompleted trials and hearings, or for unfinished matters carrying over into\n    the next term.\n\n    Special practice in county courts\n\n    The 1961 amendments of Rules 329a and 329b effective January 1, 1961, have made the district court practice with\n    respect to pending and unfinished matters and motions for new trial applicable in county courts in so far as it was\n    possible to do so. These rules in referring to county courts include both the constitutional county courts and county\n    courts at law. Under Rule 329a as now amended unfinished trials and all matters which are in process of hearing when\n    the term ends “may be proceeded with at the next or any subsequent term”, and no pleas or motions will be waived\n    or overruled automatically if not considered by the end of the term. Under Rule 329b original and amended motions\n    for new trial in the county court are to be filed and disposed of within the same time periods as have application in\n    the district court. The same extensions and other conditions for presentation and determination only. County court\n    judgments become final 30 days after judgment or order overruling the motion for new trial, and during this 30 day\n    period the county court retains control over its judgments, as in the district court. [Subd. 5.] The same rules apply\n    in county courts which have, as well as those which do not have continuous terms, except that in noncontinuous\n    term courts time periods ending during vacation are extended to the fifth day of the next term.
