The\n\njury returned its verdict finding (1) that Hoang was not liable to Appellees for any of\n\nthe Appellees’ claims against Hoang and (2) that Appellees breached the hold\n\nharmless agreement. The jury then awarded Hoang $230,000 for her attorney’s fees\n\nwhich she incurred as damages under the hold harmless agreement. Appellees then\n\nfiled their JNOV. Appellees’ argument in the JNOV centered solely on the issue that\n\nno separate jury issue was submitted for damages and attorney’s fees were not\n\nrecoverable as damages. Hoang filed her response opposing the JNOV since\n\nAppellees were not entitled to judgment as a matter of law because attorney’s fees are\n\ndamages under hold harmless indemnity agreements. Alternatively, Hoang argued\n\nthat since the jury found a breach of the hold harmless agreement and found\n\nreasonable attorney’s fees, she was entitled to attorney’s fees under her claims\n\npursuant to Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §37.001 et seq (the “Texas Declaratory\n\n\n\n\n                                          -1-\n\fJudgment Act”). The Trial Court granted the JNOV and entered a take nothing\n\njudgment in favor of Appellees. It is from this judgement that Hoang appeals.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f             STATEMENT OF ORAL ARGUMENT\n\nThe Court should grant oral argument for the following reasons:\n\n      a.    Oral argument would give the Court a more complete\n            understanding of the facts presented in this appeal. Tex. R.\n            App. P. 39.1(c).\n\n      b.    Oral argument would allow the Court to better analyze the\n            complicated legal issues presented in this appeal. Tex. R. App. P.\n            39.1(c).\n\n      c.    Oral argument would significantly aid the Court in deciding this\n            case.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f          ISSUES PRESENTED FOR REVIEW\n\n                   ISSUE NO. 1\n\n THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN GRANTING APPELLEES’\nJNOV AND AWARDING HOANG NOTHING IN\nCONTRAVENTION OF THE JURY VERDICT\n\n                   ISSUE NO. 2\n\nTHE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN REFUSING TO SUBMIT\nHOANG’S QUESTION ON DAMAGES TO THE JURY\n\n                   ISSUE NO. 3\n\nTHE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN FAILING TO AWARD\nATTORNEY’S FEES UNDER THE DECLARATORY JUDGMENT\nACT\n\n\n\n\n                       -4-\n\f                            STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      Appellees brought suit against Hoang. Anh Van Dang and Hong Bich Chau\n\n(collectively “Chau” or “Seller”) for violations of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act,\n\nfraud, statutory fraud and civil conspiracy to commit fraud arising out of the purchase\n\nof a piece of property in Harris County, Texas (the “Property”). CR 105-107. Chau\n\nwas the seller of the Property and Hoang was the real estate agent for the Seller. CR\n\n23-31, RR 35-37.\n\n      Appellees’ claims against Hoang centered solely on the argument that Hoang\n\nfailed to disclose and/or misrepresented material information about the condition of\n\nthe Property which Appellees claim Hoang had gained from her knowledge as the real\n\nestate agent for the Seller. CR 105-107. Hoang brought counterclaims for (1) breach\n\nof a hold harmless agreement that was signed by Appellees at closing which was part\n\nof the Acceptance of Title and Closing Agreements (“Acceptance Agreement”) and\n\n(2) for a declaratory judgment seeking to establish that the hold harmless provision\n\nin the Acceptance Agreement released Hoang from any liability. CR 156-165.\n\n      Appellees do not dispute signing the Acceptance Agreement. The Acceptance\n\nAgreement clearly stated that Appellees “acknowledge that neither the Real Estate\n\nAgent(s) or Broker(s) . . . have made any warranties or representations as to the\n\ncondition of the above referenced property . . . and accordingly the undersigned\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fPurchasers release and hold them harmless from any and all liability in regard to\n\nthe same.” SCR at 266.\n\n      Since the breach of the hold harmless agreement was the act of Appellees suing\n\nHoang, the only damages that Hoang could claim in her counterclaims were the her\n\ncosts to defend herself against the actions of the Appellants who had agreed to hold\n\nher harmless under the Acceptance Agreement.          These damages constituted her\n\nattorney’s fees. CSR at 266. RR 41-42, RR11.\n\n      The case was tried to a jury in November 2014. At the jury charge conference,\n\nHoang requested and submitted a standard form breach of contract question, a\n\nstandard form breach of contract damages question, and a standard form reasonable\n\nand necessary attorney’s fees question, all from the Texas Pattern Jury Charge. Due\n\nto the fact that Appellees had sued Hoang for fraud, Hoang’s questions were\n\nconditioned upon the jury’s finding that Hoang was not liable to Appellees on any of\n\ntheir causes of action against her. Because Hoang’s breach of contract question was\n\nconditioned on findings of no liability by Hoang, the only damages arising from the\n\nhold harmless obligation were attorney’s fees.\n\n      The Trial Court submitted the conditioned breach of contract question and the\n\nreasonable and necessary attorney’s fees question to the jury, but refused to submit the\n\nbreach of contract damages question. The Trial Court refused the submission of the\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fbreach of contract damage question because the only damages, if any, arising from the\n\nhold harmless obligation were Hoang’s cost of defense, i.e. her attorney’s fees.\n\nTherefore, the Trial Court concluded that a question on the amount of reasonable and\n\nnecessary attorney’s fees was sufficient to establish Hoang’s damages. CR 306-339;\n\nRR Vol.3 at 5, Vol. 4 at 15:16. Hoang’s counsel objected on the record to the Trial\n\nCourt’s refusal to submit the contract damages question. RR Vol. 3 at 53. The Trial\n\nCourt overruled the objection for the reason that the attorney’s fee question submitted\n\nwould cover the damages for the breach of contract cause of action damages. CR 406;\n\nRR Vol3 at 53; RR Vol. 4 at 15-16. The Trial Court property submitted the question\n\nas to whether the Appellees breached the Acceptance Agreement with respect to\n\nHoang. CR 421-22.\n\n      The case was submitted to the jury on November 20, 2014 without the breach\n\nof contract damages question for Hoang. The jury found:\n\n             a.     Hoang did not engage in any false, misleading or deceptive act or\n                    practice that Appellees relied upon to their detriment and that was\n                    a producing cause of damage to them; and\n\n             b.     Hoang did not engage in any unconscionable action or course of\n                    action that was a producing cause to Appellees; and\n\n             c.     Hoang did not commit fraud against Appellees; and\n\n             d.     Hoang did not commit statutory fraud against Appellees and\n\n             e.     Hoang was not part of a conspiracy to commit fraud;\n\n                                          -7-\n\f             f.    Appellees breached the agreement to release and hold Hoang\n                   harmless.\n\nCR 409-413, 418, 421. However, the jury did find that the Seller had committed\n\nfraud and awarded Appellees in excess of 1.2 million in damages against the Seller.\n\nCR 409-413, 415-417, 420\n\n      Based on finding that Hoang had not committed any wrongdoing, the jury then\n\nanswered the questions approved by the Court with respect to Hoang’s counterclaims\n\nagainst the Appellees. The Jury found that Appellees failed to comply with the release\n\nand hold harmless agreement. CR 421. The jury also found that a reasonable fee\n\nnecessary for the services of Hoang’s attorney was $230,000.00. CR 422.\n\n      On November 25, 2014, Appellants filed their JNOV seeking to overrule the\n\nfindings of the jury and proposing to award Hoang nothing. CR 436-444. Hoang\n\nfiled her response on December 11, 2014. CR 484-499. Appellees’ argument in the\n\nJNOV centered solely on the issue that no separate jury issue was submitted for\n\ndamages and attorney’s fees were not recoverable as damages. Hoang filed her\n\nresponse opposing the JNOV since Appellees were not entitled to judgment as a\n\nmatter of law because attorney’s fees are damages under a hold harmless agreement.\n\nAlternatively, Appellees argued that because the jury found a breach of the hold\n\nharmless agreement and found reasonable attorney’s fees, she was entitled to\n\nattorney’s fees under her claims pursuant to Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §37.001 et\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fseq (the “Texas Declaratory Judgment Act”). On May 11, 2015, this Court entered a\n\njudgment overruling the Jury’s findings and entering a Judgment awarding a take\n\nnothing in favor of Appellants against Hoang. CR 501; CR 507-08.\n\n      Hoang filed her Motion for New Trial on June 9, 2011 which was overruled by\n\noperation of law. Hoang filed her Notice of appeal. CR 509-510.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\f                          SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n      The Trial Court improperly granted Appellees’ JNOV because Appellees were\n\nnot entitled to recover as a matter of law because Hoang’s attorney’s fees which the\n\njury found constituted damages. Under hold harmless agreements, a party can recover\n\nher costs of defending the lawsuit as damages.          See Crimson Exploration v.\n\nIntermarket Management, LLC, 341 S.W.3d 432 (Tex. Civ. App.-Houston [1st Dist.]\n\n2010, no pet.). Attorney’s fees and expenses are recoverable under general “hold\n\nharmless” indemnity agreements even though they do not expressly provide for legal\n\nfees and expenses. See Ohio Oil Co. v. Smith, 365 S.W.2d 621, 623 (Tex. 1963);\n\nGarcia v. Sky Climber, Inc., 470 S.W.2d 261, 269-70 (Tex. Civ. App.-Houston [1st\n\nDist.], writ ref’d). Since the only damages incurred by Hoang could be her attorney’s\n\nfees, the submission of the attorney’s fee questions and the jury’s finding was proper.\n\nTherefore, Hoang was entitled to the judgment against Appellees for the $230,000 as\n\nfound by the jury.\n\n      Alternatively, if the Court finds that a separate damages was necessary, the\n\nCourt erred in not submitting the question to the jury over Hoang’s objection. The\n\nTrial Court found the separate damages question to be duplicative and refused to\n\nsubmit it to the jury. Since Hoang did submit a jury question on contract damages and\n\nthe Court refused the submission, the issue that attorney’s fees are damages is a\n\n“deemed finding” and the Court can enter a finding as such. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 279.\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\f      The Trial Court also abused its discretion by not granting Hoang her attorney’s\n\nfees under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §37.009. Hoang properly pled her cause of\n\naction under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §37.009. The jury found the reasonable and\n\nnecessary attorney’s fees incurred by Hoang were $230,000. The fees were equitable\n\nand just in light of the circumstances of this case. Appellees, through counsel in\n\nclosing argument, admitted that they had brought suit in this case against at least two\n\nother parties, whom they did not believed did anything wrong, but had insurance or\n\nwere a source of funds for the lawsuit. Hoang was sued for exactly the same reason.\n\nAppellee’s and Appellees’ counsel’s conduct of suing innocent people just to fund\n\ntheir lawsuit justifies the award of attorney’s fees under the equitable and just\n\nstandard. Further, Appellees’ signing of a hold harmless agreement and then initiating\n\nsuit against the very party that they agreed to hold harmless justifies attorney’s fees\n\nunder the equitable and just standard. Furthermore, Appellees were awarded in excess\n\nof $1,2 million in damages , including treble damages for which they now own a\n\njudgment against the Seller for that amount. The award of attorneys’ fees as damages\n\nagainst Appellees will not impose the same type of financial burden on Appellees as\n\nin the typical case of a since losing plaintiff and a single prevailing defendant. Under\n\nthese circumstances, the award of attorneys fees to Hoang under Tex. Civ. Prac. &\n\nRem. Code §39.001 is just and equitable and the Court erred in not doing so.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\f                      ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES\n\nI.

Appellees were not entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law in contravention of the damages awarded by the jury.\n\nFurthermore, a jury’s answers to a question should only be disregarded if (1) the jury\n\nquestion was improperly submitted, (2) even though properly submitted the jury\n\nquestion was rendered immaterial by other findings, or (3) the findings cannot change\n\nthe effect of the verdict. See Salinas v Rafati, 948 S.W.2d 286, 288 (Tex. 1997);\n\nSpencer v. Eagle Star Ins., Co., 876 S.W.2d 154, 157 (Tex. 1994).\n\n      As shown below, Appellees cannot show that the question upon whch the jury\n\nfound in favor of Hoang was improperly submitted. The primary argument raised by\n\nAppellees in their JNOV was the assertion that there was not a separate question of\n\nactual damages, apart from the findings on attorney’s fees submitted to the jury and\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\fthat attorney’s fees are not recoverable as damages.        Appellees never raised this\n\nobjection at the charge conference, nor did they challenge the attorney’s fees question\n\nas submitted. Even if they had raised this objection, as shown below, the question on\n\ndamages was properly submitted. Alternatively, to the extent the question on damages\n\nwas not properly submitted, this Court can either award damages based on the deemed\n\nfindings or remand the case to the Trial Court solely to make a determination\n\nregarding the proper damages to be awarded as a result of Appellees’ breach of the\n\nhold harmless provision.\n\n      A.     Claims Against Hoang were Subject to the Release and Hold\n             Harmless Provision of the Acceptance Agreement.\n\n      1.     Hoang is a Third Party Beneficiary to the Acceptance Agreement\n\n      The Acceptance Agreement, which was agreed to and signed by Appellees at\n\nclosing stated that Appellees “acknowledge that neither the Real Estate Agent(s) or\n\nBroker(s) . . . have made any warranties or representations as to the condition of the\n\nabove referenced property, or as to the requirements of the parties under their contract\n\nof sale, and accordingly the undersigned Purchasers release and hold harmless from\n\nany and all liability in regard to the same”. SCR at 266.\n\n      Under Texas law, releases are effective against named parties to the release or\n\nparties described with such particularity that their identity is not in doubt.\n\nMem’l Med Ctr. of E. Tex v. Keszler, 943 S.W.2d 433, 434 (Tex. 1997)(Emphasis\n                                          -13-\n\fadded.) In this case, it is undisputed that Hoang was the real estate agent for the\n\nChau, the Seller and that Appellees were aware at all times that Hoang was the real\n\nestate agent for Chau. Indeed, Appellees claims in this lawsuit relate to alleged failure\n\nto disclose and/or misrepresentations to Appellees by Hoang and the Seller. Because\n\nHoang’s identity was never in doubt, Hoang was protected by the release and hold\n\nharmless agreement in the Acceptance Agreement.\n\n      Furthermore, a release agreement, valid on its face is a complete bar to any\n\naction based on matters covered by the release, unless the release is set aside. Tamez\n\nv. Southwestern Motor Transport, Inc., 155 S.W.3d 564, 569-71 (Tex. App-San\n\nAntonio 2004, no pet.)      Hoang is a third party beneficiary who suffered actual\n\ndamages in having to defend against a suit in which Appellees had clearly agreed to\n\nrelease and hold Hoang harmless.\n\n      2.     Appellees Waived Any Argument that Hoang is Not Protected by the\n             Release and Hold Harmless Provisions of the Acceptance Agreement\n\n      Finally, any argument by the Appellees that Hoang was not protected by the\n\nrelease and hold harmless provisions of the Acceptance Agreement were waived by\n\nAppellees. Appellees neither submitted, nor requested the subnmission of any\n\nquestions on whether an agreement existed between them and Hoang with respect to\n\nthe release and hold harmless obligations. Failure to submit a jury issue waives the\n\nargument. Tex. R. Civ. P. 279; Washington v. Reliable Life Ins. Co., 581 S.W.2d 153,\n\n                                          -14-\n\f156-157 (Tex. 1979). By their failure to submit any issue, Appellees have waived this\n\nargument.\n\n      B.     Attorney’s Fees are Damages Under General Hold Harmless\n             Agreements\n\n      Appellees argued that Hoang cannot recover attorney’s fees as damages and that\n\nattorney’s fees are not damages under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §38.001. Hoang\n\ndisagrees that the attorney’s fees cannot be recovered as damages in circumstances\n\nthat exist in the present case. Furthermore, Hoang was not seeking her attorney’s fees\n\nunder under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §38.001, but rather Hoang was seeking\n\nher attorney’s fees as damages for breach of a hold harmless agreement. Under the\n\nhold harmless agreement and circumstances in the present case, the only damages\n\nHoang could have sustained was her cost of defending the lawsuit, i.e. her attorney’s\n\nfees which are recoverable as damages under Texas law. Therefore, Texas courts have\n\nheld that attorney’s fees are awarded as damages under “hold harmless” indemnity\n\nprovisions and are not awarded under §38.001. See Crimson Exploration, Inc. 341\n\nS.W.3d at 446.\n\n      Under Texas law, an indemnitee may recover the expenses of litigating an\n\nindemnified claim. Monical & Powell, Inc. v. Bechtel Corporation, 404 S.W.2d 911,\n\n914 (Tex. Civ. App-Eastland, 1966, writ ref’d n.r.e); T.J. Kline, Inc. v. DAG\n\nManagement, Inc. 1995 WL500298 at 3 (Tex. App.-Dallas 1995, no writ); Keystone\n                                         -15-\n\fEquity Management v Thoen, 30 S.W.2d 339, 340 (Tex. App-Dallas, 1987, no writ).\n\nAttorney’s fees and court costs are recoverable under general “hold harmless”\n\nindemnity agreements even though they do not expressly provide indemnity for legal\n\nfees or expenses. Ohio Oil Co., 365 S.W.2d at 623; Garcia, 470S.W.2d 261, 269-70\n\n(Tex. Civ. App-Houston [1st Dist] 1971, writ ref’d). Otherwise an indemnitee would\n\nnot be fully protected. Monical & Powell, Inc. 404 S.W.2d at 914; T.J. Kline, 1995\n\nWL500298 at 3.\n\n      In Ohio Oil, the Texas Supreme Court reviewed the following two indemnity\n\nprovisions:\n\n      “15. OHIO INDEMNIFIED:\n\n      Ohio shall not be liable or responsible for and Contractor shall save and\n      hold harmless Ohio from and against any and all claims and damages of\n      every kind, for injury to or death of any person or persons and for all\n      damage to loss of property, arising out of or attributed, directly or\n      indirectly, to the operations of Contractor hereunder. Contractor shall\n      likewise indemnify Ohio for any or all injury or damage to property\n      belonging to Ohio for any or all injury or damage to property belonging\n      to Ohio, arising out of or in connection with or resulting from any and\n      all acts or omissions of Contractor hereunder.\n\n      17.     STATUTES TO BE COMPLIED WITH:\n\n             (a) Contractor agrees to comply with the Workmen’s\n      Compensation Act of the State of New Mexico and to pay or cause to be\n      paid all compensation, medical or hospital bills which may become due\n      or payable thereunder, and to protect and indemnify Ohio from and\n      against any and all liability by reason of injury of employees of\n      Contractor. Contractor shall furnish Ohio with a certificate from the\n\n                                        -16-\n\f      State Agency charged with the administration of the Workmen’s\n      Compensation Act evidencing Contractor’s compliance therewith.\n\nOhio Oil Co., 365 S.W.2d at 623. The Supreme Court affirmed the trial court’s\n\ndecision that the indemnitor was liable for both damages and legal fees and expenses\n\nunder these indemnity provisions. Ohio Oil Co., 365 S.W.2d at 623-24. The Court\n\nheld that when the indemnitor has agreed to save and hold harmless the indemnitee\n\nfrom liability for any and all claims and damages, the indemnitee is entitled to recover\n\nfrom the indemnitor all reasonable expenses incurred in defending the claim asserted\n\nagainst him. Ohio Oil Co., 365 S.W.2d at 627-28.\n\n      Similarly in Garcia, the Court examined the following indemnity provisions.’\n\n      3. The lessee [Texas Concrete Silo] . . . agrees. . . to pay all claims and\n      damages arising from defects in the machinery and equipment . . .\n\n      5. . . . lessee agrees to hold . . . [Sky Climber] . . . harmless from any\n      claim of whatsoever kind or nature. . . This hold harmless agreement\n      shall encompass any claims arising from either or both personal injury\n      and property damage . . .\n\nGarcia, 470 S.W.2d at 269.      The Garcia court held that these general provisions\n\nincluding indemnity for legal fees and expenses incurred by the indemnitee. See also\n\nMonical & Powell, 404 S.W.2d at 914 (court held that indemnitee may recover against\n\nthe indemnitor for all reasonable expenses in settling the claim against indemnitee).\n\n      In the present case, under the Acceptance Agreement, Appellees agreed to hold\n\nharmless Hoang from any liability in regard to claims arising from any alleged\n\n                                          -17-\n\fwarranties or representations as to the condition of the subject property. SCR 226.\n\nThe claims asserted against Hoang by the Appellees specifically related to purported\n\nwarranties and representations by Hoang regarding the condition of the subject\n\nproperty. CR at 105-107. Therefore, Hoang is entitled to recover her costs and\n\nexpenses associated with defending the lawsuit under the hold harmless agreement\n\nwhich the jury found that Appellees breached. See Ohio Oil Co., 365 S.W. 2d at 627-\n\n78; Garcia 470 S.W.2d at 261; See also Patch v. Amoco Oil Co., 845 F.2d 571, 573\n\n(5th Cir.1988) (indemnitee would not be held “harmless” where it was not found\n\nnegligent by jury unless entitled to recover costs of litigation); Monical & Powell, 404\n\nS.W.2d at 914; Crimson Exploration Inc. 341 S.W.2d at 446. (parties are not\n\nprecluded from recovering their defense expenses.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\f      C.     Appellees’ Argument that Hoang Cannot Recover Attorney’s Fees\n             Under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §38.001 is Misplaced and Not\n             Relevant\n\n      Appellees contend that Hoang cannot recover attorney’s fees as damages under\n\nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §38.001. Despite Appellees’ contention, Hoang was not\n\nseeking the attorney’s fees under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §38.001. Hoang was\n\nseeking her damages under the hold harmless agreement.\n\n      Attorney’s fees consitute damages under hold harmless agreements. They are\n\nnot awarded under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §38.001. Crimson Exploration,\n\n341 S.W.3d at 446.     An indemnitee is not required to prove monetary damages\n\nbeyond attorney’s fees in order to recover its actual attorney’s fees.\n\n      Therefore, Appellees’ contention that Hoang is not entitled to recover her\n\nattorney’ss fees under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §38.001 is inapplicable and not\n\nrelevant.\n\n      D.     The Jury Determined Reasonableness of Attorney’s Fees\n\n      Once the jury found that Appellees breached the Acceptance Agreement, Hoang\n\nbecame entitled to recover her attorney’s fees. Crimson Exploration, 341 S.W.3d at\n\n444 (citing Patch v Amoco Oil Co., 845 F.2d 571, 573 (5th Cir. 1988)). Because\n\nattorney’s fees are within the control of the party seeking indemnification, they are\n\nsubject to the reasonablenss test. Id.\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\f       In this case, reasonableness was submitted to the jury and the jury found that\n\nHoang’s reasonable attorney’s fees were $230,000. CR 421-422. Therefore, Hoang\n\nis entitled to recover $230,000 from Appellees.\n\n       E.     The Express Negligence Doctrine Does Not Preclude Enforcement of\n              the Hold Harmless Provision\n\n       1.     The Express Negligence Doctrine Is Not Applicable\n\n       Appellees raised the argument that the hold harmless agreement was not\n\nconspicuous, did not provide fair notice and could not be used to limit Hoang’s\n\nliability for her own negligence. Not only did Appellees waive this defense, but the\n\nexpress negligence doctrine is not applicable.\n\n       If, an indemnity agreement or hold harmless agreement seeks to limit a party’s\n\nliability for its own negligence, the party attempting to limit its liability must give fair\n\nnotice and the clause should be conspicuousness. See Dresser Industries, Inc. v. Page\n\nPetroleum, Inc., 853 S.W.2d 505, 507–09 (Tex.1993). Under the express negligence\n\ndoctrine, a party who wishes to contractually shift risk from itself for the\n\nconsequences of its future negligence must specifically express that intent within the\n\nfour corners of an agreement. See Ethyl Corp. v. Daniel Constr. Co., 725 S.W.2d 705,\n\n707–08 (Tex.1987); Dresser Industries, Inc., 853 S.W.2d at 508. Stated generally, the\n\nexpress negligence doctrine provides that contracts will not be construed so as to\n\n\n\n                                            -20-\n\findemnify a person against his own negligence unless such intention is expressed in\n\nspecific terms. Ohio Oil Co., 365 S.W.2d at 624.\n\n      Fair notice requirements to indemnity agreements and releases only apply when\n\nsuch exculpatory agreements are utilized to relieve a party of liability for its own\n\nnegligence in advance. Dresser Industries, Inc., 853 S.W.2d at 508. In the present\n\ncase, Hoang was not attempting to shift liability for her own negligence. She is not\n\nseeking indemnity for the consequences of her own negligence. No claims of\n\nnegligence were brought against Hoang by Appellees or any third parties. No third\n\nparties are seeking any claims against the Appellees that are attributable to the conduct\n\nof Hoang, nor is Hoang seeking to be indemnified for any such claims by any third\n\nparties. Further, Hoang is a third party beneficiary to the Acceptance Agreement.\n\nThere was no attempt to shift liability and there is no indemnification for “the\n\nconsequences” of a party’s own negligence.\n\n      Hoang is seeking recovery due to the conduct of the Appellees who signed the\n\nhold harmless agreement agreeing to indemnify Hoang. Hoang is not utilizing the\n\nhold harmless language to relieve herself from liability for her own negligence,\n\ninstead she is utilizing the agreement/release to impose liability upon the Appellees\n\nfor their own conduct and breach by their refusal to honor the hold harmless\n\nagreement.\n\n\n                                          -21-\n\f      2.     Appellees’ Waived Any Arguments that the Hold Harmless Clause\n             Was Not Conspicuous or Did Not Provide Fair Notice.\n\n      Further, Appellees have waived any argument that the hold harmless clause was\n\nnot conspicuous or did not provide fair notice because they never pled this defense nor\n\npresented any evidence.\n\n      When a release is interposed and established as a bar against the plaintiff's\n\naction, the plaintiff must plead and obtain findings on any fact issues that will avoid\n\nor invalidate the release. Dresser Industries, Inc. 821 S.W.2d 359, 364-365; Womble\n\nv. Atkins, 160 Tex. 363, 331 S.W.2d 294, 296 (1960); Ellis v. Woods, 453 S.W.2d 509,\n\n510 (Tex. Civ. App.—El Paso 1970, no writ).\n\n      In Dresser, the Defendant pled and established the release as an affirmative\n\ndefense and obtained a finding that the plaintiff’s representative had the authority to\n\nbind plaintiff to the agreement. Consequently, plaintiff had the burden of obtaining\n\nany finding that would avoid the effect of the release. Since plaintiff did not obtain\n\na finding that the provision was not conspicuous enough to give fair notice, the\n\nplaintiff waived any defenses that it may have had to the release’s enforcement.\n\nDresser Industries, Inc, 281 S.W.2d at 364-365.\n\n      In the present case Hoang obtained a finding that the Appellees breached the\n\nrelease. CR 421-22. Appellees did not obtain any finding that the release was not\n\nconspicuous to give fair notice. Further, Appellees did not raise objections with the\n\n                                         -22-\n\fCourt to challenge the conspicuousness of the release language or with respect to any\n\nother provision of the agreement. RR Vol. 3 at 48-55. Having made no argument\n\nregarding conspicuousness at trial, Appellees’ arguments as to conspicuous are\n\nwaived. See Vera v. North Star Dodge Sales, Inc., 989 S.W.2d 13, 15-17\n\n(Tex.App.–San Antonio,1998, no pet.). See also Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a).\n\nII.   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY REFUSING TO SUBMIT HOANG’S\n      QUESTION ON BREACH OF CONTRACT DAMAGES (Issue No. 2\n      Restated)\n\n             In the case at hand, Appellees agreed to release and hold Hoang harmless\n\nfrom any and all claims pertaining to the condition of the Property. A “release,” or\n\n“hold harmless agreement,” is a contractual agreement whereby one party assumes\n\nliability inherent in a situation thereby relieving the other party of responsibility.\n\nDresser Industries, Inc., 853 S.W.2d at 508 (Tex. 1993). Appellees do not dispute\n\nsigning the Acceptance Agreement.\n\n      Despite Appellees’ agreement to release and hold Hoang harmless and despite\n\naccepting responsibility for any liability pertaining to the condition of the property,\n\nAppellees nevertheless filed suit against Hoang seeking to impose the liability on\n\nHoang for the condition of the property. This was a clear breach of the terms and\n\nconditions of the Acceptance Agreement by the Appellees. As a direct result of\n\n\n\n\n                                         -23-\n\fAppellees bringing suit against Hoang, Hoang incurred damages in the form of\n\ndefense costs in having to defend against Appellees’ claims. RR Vol. 3 at 9-11.\n\n      Hoang properly brought and was allowed to bring a claim for breach of contract\n\nby the Appellees for violating the terms and conditions of the Acceptance Agreement.\n\nCR 156-165. Hoang provided evidence at trial on the fees incurred in having to\n\ndefend against the suit as a result of Appellees’ violation and breach and was cross\n\nexamined on the fees incurred. At the charge conference, Hoang submitted jury\n\nquestions on whether the Appellees violated the Acceptance Agreement and what sum\n\nof damages would Hoang be owed as a result of their breach. CR 306-339. The Court\n\ninquired as to the whether the defense costs incurred by Hoang were the actual\n\ndamages she was seeking and Hoang concurred that her damages were her costs of\n\ndefense. Vol 3 at 53, Vol. 4 at 15-16. The Trial Court found the separate breach of\n\ncontract damage question to be duplicative of the attorney’s fees question which was\n\nincluded in the proposed charge. Therefore, the Trial Court concluded that the\n\nattorney’s fees question would provide for defenses costs as damages. RR Vol.. 3 at\n\n53, Vol 4 at 15-16. However, by accepting Appellees’ JNOV arguments and refusing\n\nto award Hoang damages in accordance with the Jury’s findings, the Trial Court is\n\nnow implying that the attorney’s fees question was not sufficient, and that there\n\nshould have been a separate breach of contract damage question. Therefore, the Trial\n\n\n                                        -24-\n\fCourt erred in improperly removing and refusing to submit the actual breach of\n\ncontract damage question submitted by Hoang in her proposed charge and by failing\n\nto include said question in the final jury charge despite Hoang’s requests to do so.\n\nA.    Hoang Properly Submitted Her Breach of Contract Damage Question and\n      the Court’s Refusal To Submit It to the Jury was Error\n\n      A party is entitled to attorney’s fees if it prevails on a cause of action for which\n\nattorney’s fees are recoverable. State Farm Life Ins. Co., v. Beaston, 907 S.W.2d 430,\n\n437 (Tex. 1995). Hoang properly submitted a breach of contract claim for which\n\nattorney’s fees were recoverable. Hoang properly submitted a breach of contract\n\ndamage question and an attorney’s fees question as part of her breach of contract\n\nclaim. The Court erred in failing to include the damages question, despite including\n\nthe attorney’s fees question which awarded the same damages being sought by Hoang\n\nfor her actual damages.\n\n       It is undisputed that the jury made a finding that the Appellees violated the\n\nAcceptance Agreement thereby entitling Hoang to damages and attorney’s fees.\n\nAppellees’ counsel cross examined Hoang and her attorney with respect to the defense\n\ncosts incurred and the jury properly awarded a value based on the evidence presented.\n\nRR Vol. 13 at 9-11. The court erred in failing to include the breach of contract\n\ndamage question and has committed further error by failing to accept the findings by\n\nthe jury.\n\n                                          -25-\n\f      Appellees raised the argument that the award of attorney’s fees to Hoang was\n\nimproper because there was no separate findings of actual damages other than\n\nattorney’s fees awarded to Hoang. However, Hoang did submit a jury question on\n\nbreach of contract damages and the Court refused the submission, stating since the\n\nonly damages that Hoang incurred were the costs of defense, i.e. her attorney’s fees;\n\ntherefore, a separate breach of contract damage question was not necessary. RR Vol.\n\n3 at 53, Vol. 4 at 15-16. If such refusal, as shown below, is not a deemed finding, it\n\nwould be reversible error. By requesting the question and the Court refusing it on the\n\nrecord, Hoang preserved the error. See Dallas Mkt Ctr. Dev. Co. v Liedeker, 958 S.W.\n\n2d 382, 386-387 (Tex. 1987) overruled on other grounds Torrington Co. v Stutzman,\n\n46 S.W.3d 829 (Tex. 2000). (Error can be preserved by court stating on the record that\n\nthe jury question is refused).\n\n      When a trial court omits a jury question, the party who relies on that question\n\nmust tender that question in writing in substantially correct form and obtain a ruling\n\nin order to preserve error. Chubb Lloyds Ins. Co. of Texas v. Andrew's Restoration,\n\nInc., 323 S.W.3d 564, 584 (Tex. App.–Dallas, 2010) aff’d in part, rev’d in part Cruz\n\nv Andrews Restoration, Inc. 364 S.W.3d 817 (Tex. 2012). See Tex. R. Civ. P. 276 See\n\nalso Johnson v. Johnson, 869 S.W.2d 490, 492 (Tex. App.-Eastland 1993, writ\n\ndenied).\n\n\n                                         -26-\n\f      An oral ruling by a court on a written request will suffice “when the court's\n\nrefusal is otherwise clear from the record.” Liedeker, 958 S.W.2d at 387. In Liedeker,\n\nthe record reflected that the appellant submitted written requests to the trial judge, the\n\njudge said he would sign them later, and through inadvertence the judge never signed\n\nthem. The Supreme court held that the trial court's “statements on the record clearly\n\npreserved [appellant]'s complaint.” Liedeker, 58 S.W.2d at 387.\n\n      Similarly, in the present case, Hoang court specifically asked for her actual\n\nbreach of contract damage question. CR 318-319, 330-331 The Court refused the\n\nsubmission stating that since the only damages that Hoang was seeking was her\n\nattorney’s fees, such question was not necessary. RR Vol. 3 at 53, Vol. 4 at 15-16.\n\nThe Court did not submit the question, and inadvertently forgot to sign the question\n\npresented to it by Hoang’s counsel. Therefore, Hoang’s question on damages was\n\npreserved.\n\nB.    Hoang’s Attorney’s Fees as Damages is a Deemed Finding\n\n      Since Hoang did submit a separate question as to breach of contract damages\n\nto the Trial Court, and the Trial Court refused the submission of such question, and\n\nAppellees never objected to the submission of the attorney’s fees and the breach of\n\ncontract/release questions, the issue that attorney’s fees are damages is a “deemed\n\nfinding. This Court can enter a finding as such.\n\n\n                                           -27-\n\f      Tex. R. Civ. P. 279 provides that when a ground of recovery or defense consists\n\nof more than one element, if one or more of such elements necessary to sustain such\n\nground of recovery or defense, and necessarily referable thereto, are submitted to and\n\nfound by the jury, and one or more of such elements are omitted from the charge,\n\nwithout request or objection, and there is factually sufficient evidence to support a\n\nfinding thereon, the trial court, at any time before the judgment is rendered, can make\n\nand file written findings on such omitted element or elements in support of the\n\njudgment. If no such written findings are made, such omitted element or elements\n\nshall be deemed found by the court in such manner as to support the judgment. Tex.\n\nR. Civ. P. 279.\n\n      It is undisputed that the jury awarded Hoang her reasonable and necessary\n\nattorneys’s fees in the sum of $230,000.00. CR 422. The Trial Court could have made\n\na written finding that such attorney’s fees constituted Hoang’s damages. Even if no\n\nsuch written findings are made, such omitted element or elements shall be deemed\n\nfound by the Trial Court in such manner as to support the judgment. See Gulf States\n\nUtilities Co. v. Low, 79 S.W.3d 561, 564-66 (Tex. 2002).\n\n      In Low, the Texas Supreme Court held that “when an incomplete theory is\n\nsubmitted without complaint, the parties are deemed to have waived a jury trial on the\n\nomitted issue and to have agreed to submit the issue to the trial court. Low, 79 S.W.3d\n\n\n                                         -28-\n\fat 564. See, e.g., Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc. v. Tucker, 806 S.W.2d 914, 925\n\n(Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 1991, writ dism'd w.o.j.); Wilson v. Remmel Cattle Co., 542\n\nS.W.2d 938, 942 (Tex.App.-Amarillo 1976, writ ref'd n.r.e.); see also Little Rock\n\nFurniture Mfg. Co. v. Dunn, 148 Tex. 197, 222 S.W.2d 985, 991 (1949)(holding that\n\npetitioner who did not object to improperly conditioned submission waived right to\n\na jury answer on the unanswered issue, and the issue must be deemed as having been\n\nanswered by the court in such manner as to support the judgment).\n\n      More importantly, Appellees against who the issue would be deemed, had an\n\nopportunity to object to the submission of the two jury questions without the damage\n\nquestion. Appellees did not object. They cannot now complain that the damage\n\nissue was missing since they did not object prior to the submission of such issues. See\n\nDiGiuseppe v Lawler, 269 S.W.3d 588, 599 (Tex. 2008).\n\n      If one or more elements is omitted from the charge, then the omitted element\n\nmust be deemed found by the trial court in a manner that supports its judgment Tri v.\n\nJ.T.T., 162 S.W.2d 552, 558 (Tex. 2005). See also, In the Interest of JFC, ABC, &\n\nMBC, 96 S.W.3d 256, 262-63 (Tex. 2002).\n\n      Since Hoang submitted the proper jury question and the jury found the\n\nreasonable and necessary fees, the issue of attorney’s fees as damages is a deemed\n\n\n\n\n                                         -29-\n\ffinding and the Trial Court should have entered the judgment in favor of Hoang for\n\nthe $230,000.\n\nIII.   THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN FAILING TO AWARD\n       ATTORNEY’S FEES UNDER THE DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACT\n       (Issue No. 3 Restated)\n\nA.     Hoang was entitled to Attorney’s Fees under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code\n       §37.009\n\n       Hoang brought a cause of action under the Texas Declaratory Judgment Act\n\n(the “Declaratory Judgment Act”) to determine that Appellants had released Hoang\n\nunder the hold harmless agreement in the Acceptance Agreement. A court may award\n\ncosts and reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees which are equitable and just. Tex.\n\nCiv. Prac. & Rem. Code §37.009. The Court had the discretion to award attorney’s\n\nfees under the Texas Declaratory Judgment Act. Bocquet v. Herring, 972 S.W.2d 19,\n\n20 (Tex. 1998).\n\n       The Declaratory Judgment Act imposes four limitations on the Court’s\n\ndiscretion; 1) that the fees are reasonable; 2) that the fees are necessary; 3) that the\n\nfees are equitable and 4) that the fees are just. The first two limitations, reasonable\n\nand necessary are fact issues which should be decided by the trier of the fact and the\n\nsecond two limitations, fair and equitable are legal issues that are matters of law to\n\nbe decided by the Court. Ridge Oil Company, Inc. v Guinn Investments, Inc.; 148\n\nS.W.3d. 143, 161 (Tex. 2003); Bocquet, 972 S.W.2d at 21.\n                                          -30-\n\f      In the present case, the Court submitted the issue of reasonable and necessary\n\nfees to the jury to decide. CR 421-422. The jury handed down a verdict that the\n\nreasonable and necessary attorney’s fees for the services of Hoang’s attorney’s was\n\n$230,000. CR 422.\n\nB.    Hoang’s Declaratory Judgment Action was Properly Pled\n\n      In the present case, Hoang brought an action under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.\n\nCode §37.001 et seq., seeking a declaration that Appellees released Hoang under the\n\nhold harmless agreement in the Acceptance Agreement. The Declaratory Judgment\n\naction was not filed solely as a means to recover attorney’s fees as Appellees argue.\n\nOnly when a party brings a declaratory judgment action by way of a counterclaim or\n\namended petition and the declaratory judgment involves only issues already raised by\n\nthe original claim, does Appellees’ argument prevail. See Adams v. First Nat'l Bank\n\nof Bells/Savoy, 154 S.W.3d 859, 873 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2005, no pet.); Flagship Hotel,\n\nLtd. v. City of Galveston, 117 S.W.3d 552, 556 (Tex. Civ. App-Texarkana 2003, writ\n\ndenied). This was simply was not the case in the present case.\n\n      Appellees brought claims against Hoang for violations of the Texas Trade\n\nPractices Act, fraud, statutory fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud. Hoang brought\n\ncounterclaims for breach of contract, promissory estoppel and an action under the\n\ndeclaratory judgment act seeking a declaration for interpretation of the Acceptance\n\n\n                                        -31-\n\fAgreement that Appellees had released Hoang. CR 156-165. Hoang’s counterclaims\n\nunder the Declaratory Judgment Act were distinct and separate claims from\n\nAppellees’ claims. Any party may sue and seek a judicial determination of contractual\n\nrights. Stark v. Benckenstein,156 S.W.3d 112, 116 (Tex. App.–Beaumont, 2004, pet.\n\ndenied); Hartman v. Sirgo Operating, Inc., 863 S.W.2d 764, 767 (Tex. App.-El Paso\n\n1993, writ denied). A release constitutes a contract. Schlumberger Technology Corp.\n\nv. Swanson, 959 S.W.2d 171, 178 (Tex.1997). Hoang was entitled to request a\n\ndetermination of questions of construction or validity arising under the Acceptance\n\nAgreement and to obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other legal relations\n\nthereunder. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 37.004(a); Hartman, 863\n\nS.W.2d at 767.\n\n      Appellees’ raised the argument that Appellant’s pleadings were insufficient\n\nwhich was simply a red herring. There is no particular type of pleading required for\n\ncauses of action under the Declaratory Judgments Act. James v. Hitchcock Indep.\n\nSchool Dist., 742 S.W.2d 701, 704 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1987, writ\n\ndenied). Moreover, pleadings under the Declaratory Judgment Act are to be liberally\n\nconstrued. Frost v. Sun Oil Co. (Delaware), 560 S.W.2d 467, 473 (Tex. Civ.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1977, no writ). Hoang’s Fifth Amended Answer and\n\nCounter-claim clearly articulated Hoang’s claim for declaratory judgment and her\n\n\n                                        -32-\n\frights to attorney’s fees under the Declaratory Judgment Act. See CR 156-165. It is\n\nnot necessary for a party moving for attorney's fees in a declaratory judgment action\n\nto specify the statutory authority for such an award in the motion, so long as the party\n\npled for attorney's fees. Purvis Oil Corp. v. Hillin, 890 S.W2d 931, 939 (Tex. App.-El\n\nPaso 1994, no pet.) See also Cap Rock Elec. Co-Op, Inc. v. Texas Utilities Elec. Co.,\n\n874 S.W.2d 92, 102 (Tex. App. – El Paso 1994, no pet.); Housing Authority of the\n\nCity of Harlingen v. Valdez, 841 S.W.2d 860, 868 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1992,\n\nwrit denied): District Judges of Collin County v. Commissioners Court of Collin\n\nCounty, 677 S.W.2d 743, 746 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1984, writ ref'd n.r.e.).\n\n      In Purvis Oil Corp, Hillin pled for attorney's fees in its amended answer.\n\nSimilarly, Hoang pled for attorney’s fees under §37.009 in her pleadings. Since it was\n\nproperly plead, the Court has the discretion to award Hoang her attorney’s fees. See\n\nPurvis Oil, 890 S.W.2d at 939.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -33-\n\f       C.     An award of Attorney’s Fees to Hoang is Equitable and Just\n\n       Equitable and just are questions of law for the Court to decide. Bocquet, 972\n\nS.W.2d at 21. Whether the fees are equitable and just depends, “not on direct proof,\n\nbut on the concept of fairness, in light of all the circumstances of the case.” Approach\n\nResources I, L.P. v. Clayton, 360 S.W.3d 632, 639-640 (Tex.App.–El Paso 2012, no\n\nwrit). See also Ridge Oil Co., 148 S.W.3d at 162. The award of attorney’s fees is\n\nwithin the sound discretion of the court. See Purvis Oil Corp. 890 S.W.2d at 938\n\nciting Cap Rock Elec. Co-op., Inc., 874 S.W. 2d at 101 (an award of attorney's fees\n\nrests in the sound discretion of the trial court, and its judgment will not be reversed\n\non appeal without a clear showing of abuse of discretion); See also Owen Elec.\n\nSupply, Inc. v. Brite Day Constr., Inc., 821 S.W.2d 283, 288 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[1st Dist.] 1991, writ denied).\n\n       The Trial Court abused his discretion because under the circumstances and facts\n\nof this case, awarding Hoang her attorney’s fees in this case is equitable and just. The\n\ntestimony solicited by the Appellees’ counsel was that Hoang’s attorney’s fees were\n\nequal or close to what he was asking the jury to award him in his case in chief.1\n\nThere was no great disparity in the amounts being sought by Hoang. The jury found\n\n\n       1\n        The jury awarded Appellees’ attorney $205,000 for attorney’s fees and appellate\nattorney’s fees of $41,000 and $25,000 making a total award to Appellees’ attorney of $271,000.\nC$R 407-427.\n\n                                             -34-\n\fthe fees to be reasonable and necessary. As shown below, Hoang only incurred the\n\nfees because, despite having little or no evidence against Hoang, Appellees persisted\n\nin bringing claims against Hoang all the way through trial, despite executing the hold\n\nharmless agreement. Appellees initiated the lawsuit against Hoang based upon alleged\n\nclaims of fraud and statutory fraud which were basically frivolous.         Appellees,\n\nthroughout the trial, presented no evidence to support their allegations. This was\n\nconfirmed by the jury findings.       Appellees admitted that there had been no\n\nrepresentations or misrepresentations to them by Hoang, having never spoken to her\n\nexcept to exchange pleasantries at closing. No independent evidence of any of\n\nAppellees’ allegations against Hoang existed, yet Appellees forced her to defend\n\nherself for the better part of three (3) years against their unfounded allegations.\n\n      Moreover, Appellees testified throughout the trial that they brought suit against\n\nat least two other parties, Grace Inspection Homes, Inc. and Michael Nguyen, whom\n\nthey did not believe did anything wrong, but had insurance or were a source of funds\n\nfor the lawsuit. Appellees own attorney admitted in his closing arguments that the\n\njury should not hold his clients responsible for his advise to sue parties for the sole\n\npurpose that they had were sources of income, not because they were liable in any\n\nmanner. RR Vol. 3A 12.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -35-\n\f      Appellees although they do not willingly admit it, sued Hoang for exactly the\n\nsame reason. Appellees sued Hoang in hopes of getting a judgment that they could\n\nthen take against the Texas Real Estate Trust fund, not because they really believed\n\nthat she misled them or had knowledge of any of the water damage. Appellees did not\n\nhave any knowledge of anything that Hoang knew until several months into the case\n\nwhen she unequivocally testified that she had no knowledge of any of the alleged\n\nwater damage that had occurred when the Seller owned the house. Hoang consistently\n\ntook the position that she had no knowledge of any water damage and the jury founder\n\nher to be credible. RR Vol. 2 at 20-21, 30, 37-39.          Appellees and Appellees’\n\ncounsel’s conduct of suing innocent people just to fund their lawsuit justifies the\n\naward of attorney’s fees under the equitable and just standard. See RR Vol.3A 12.\n\nDespite having executed and willingly entered into the Acceptance Agreement at\n\nclosing which contained the release and hold harmless agreement, Appellees persisted\n\nin bringing claims against Hoang.          Appellant’s actions cost Hoang at least\n\n$230,000.00 in legal fees as the cost of defense. RR Vol. 15, Ex. 16.\n\n      Further, an award of damages against the Appellees will not impose the same\n\ntype of financial burden on them or give rise to the same equities as it would in a\n\ntypical case involving a single losing plaintiff and single prevailing defendant. In this\n\ncase, despite losing on all jury questions involving Hoang, Appellees obtained a\n\n\n                                          -36-\n\fjudgment in excess of $1,200,000, against Chau, the Seller of the subject property.\n\nHaving prevailed against Chau, the practical net effect of entering judgment in favor\n\nof Appellee for her attorney's fees would merely reduce Appellees’ collection rights\n\nfrom approximately $1,200,000 to approximately $1,000,000, after netting out\n\nHoang’s attorney's fees of $230,000. On the other hand, failing to award Hoang her\n\nattorney's fees leaves her with an attorney's fees obligation of $230,000, despite\n\nfavorable jury findings on all causes of action and despite having committed no\n\nwrongdoing and having been released and indemnified by Appellees. Finally, the $1.2\n\nmillion plus judgment arose from the purchase of a home by Appellees from\n\ndefendant Chau for approximately $145,000. CR 31. Appellees' judgment against\n\nChau included additional damages under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act\n\nwhich constitute a windfall to Appellees. Awarding Hoang’s out of pocket attorney's\n\nfees against a windfall judgment in favor of Appellees is the only fair and equitable\n\nresult.\n\n          The jury, as the trier of fact, did not find Hoang guilty of any wrong doing.\n\nMore importantly, the jury through their answer affirmed that Appellees not only\n\nagreed to hold Hoang harmless, but actually failed to do so. Awarding Hoang her\n\nattorney’s’ fees’, based on the jury's fact findings, is “equitable and just.” See AVCO\n\nCorp., Textron Lycoming Reciprocating Engine Div. of AVCO Corp. v. Interstate\n\n\n                                           -37-\n\fSouthwest, Ltd., 251 S.W.3d 632, 670 (Tex. App.–Houston [14 Dist.], 2007, writ\n\ndenied). Since the jury had found that the attorney’s fees were necessary and\n\nreasonable and the evidence was such that Hoang was released by Appellees, the Trial\n\nJudge abused his discretion by not awarding Hoang her attorney’s fees under Tex.\n\nCiv. Prac. & Rem. Code §37.009.\n\n                         CONCLUSION AND PRAYER\n\n      The Trial Court erred in granting Appellee’s Judgement Non Obstante Verdicto.\n\nHoang is entitled to recover her attorney’s fees of $230,000 for breach of the hold\n\nharmless agreement. Hoang respectfully requests this Court reverse the judgment of\n\nthe trial court and render judgment in her favor for $230,000.00 plus post judgment\n\ninterest as allowed by law. Alternatively, this Court should remand the sole issue of\n\nHoang’s damages under the hold harmless agreement.\n\n                                       Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                       LAW OFFICE OF MYNDE S.

All the questions and answers are important. No one should say that any question\n            or answer is not important.\n\n            6.      Answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" to all .questions unless you are told otherwise. A \"Yes\"\n            answer must be based on a preponderance of the evidence.

If you do not find that a preponderance of the evidence supports\n     a \"Yes\" answer, then answer ''No.\" A preponderance of the evidence is not measured by the\n     number of witnesses or by lhe number of documents admitted in evidence. For a fact to be\n     proved by a preponderance of the evidence, you must find th.e fact is more likely 1rue than not\n     true.\n\n             A fact may be establii;hed by direct evidence or by circumstantial evidence or both. A\n     tact is established by direct evidence when proved by documentary evidence or by witnesses\n     who saw the act done or heard the words spoken. A fact is established by circumstantial evidence\n     when it may be fairly and reasonably inferred from other facts proved.\n\n            7.      Do not decide who you think should win before you answer the questions and\n            then just answer the questions to match your decision.

Do not answer questions by drawing straws or by any method of chance,\n\n            9.     Some questions might ask you for a dollar amount. Do not agree in advance to\n            decide on a dollar amount by adding up each juror's amount and then figuring the\n            average.\n\n            I 0.   Do not trade your answers. For example, do not say: \"I will answer this question\n            your way if you answer another question my way.\"\n\n            11.     Unless otherwise instructed, the answers to the que.~tions must be based on the\n            decision of at least IO of the 12 jurors. The same IO jurors must agree on every answer.\n            Do not agree to be bound by a vote of anything less than l Ojurors, even if it would be a\n            majority.\n\n             lf you do not follow these instmctions, you will be guilty of juror misconduct, and I\n     m.ight have to order a new trial and start this process over again. This would waste your time and\n     the parties' money, and would require the taxpayers of this county to pay for another trial. If a\n     juror breaks any of these rules, tell that person to stop and repon it to me immediately.\n\n             Depending upon your answers to this Charge, there may be a need to take brief,\n     additional testimony and for you to deliberate upon additional questions after you have\n     completed your initial deliberalions.\n                                                2\n                                                                                                408\n\f                                           QUESTION NO. 1\n\n        Did any of the persons named below engage in any false, misleading, or deceptive act or\npractice that Trevor and Jorja Gilbert relied on to their detriment and that was a producing cause\nof damages to them?\n\n              \"Producing cause\" means a cause that was a substantial factor in\n              bringing about the damages, if any, and without which the damages would\n              not have occurred.

Plaintiffs sued Defendant Hoang for violations of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act, fraud,\n\n       slatutoty fraud, and civil conspiracy.\n\n2.     Defendant Hoang answered and raised defenses of failure to mitigate damages, assumption\n\n       of the risk, release and waiver, but also br0t1ght a counterclaim for breach of contract,\n\n       promissory estoppel at common law and sought declaratory relief. All these defenses and\n\n       the counterclaim were based upon one sentence in a document prepared by the title\n\n       company entitled \"Acceptance of Title and Closing Agreements.\" The sentence recited\n\n       hold harmless language, and although was signed by tl1e Gilberts and tl1e seller/defendants,\n\n       Ahn Van Dan and Hong Bich Chau (collectively \"Chau Defendants\") at the closing of the\n\n       real estate tl'ansaction, it was not signed or authorized by the third party realtors    01·   their\n\n      supervising broke!'s.\n\n                                            Page I of 11\n\n\n\n                                                                                                  434\n\f3.   On November 20, 2014. a jury awarded to the Gilberts what can only be deemed a large\n\n     verdict against the Chau Defendants for $1,384,000 for knowingly and intentionally\n\n     violating the DTPA, and for common law fraud, and statutory fraud. However, the jury did\n\n     not find the listing/selling realtor of the Chau Defendants (Hoang) liable under any of the\n\n     Gilberts' causes of action. The jury further answered \"Yes\" to whether the Gilberts failed to\n\n     comply with an agreement lo release and hold the realtors and their brokers, including\n\n     Defendant Hoang, hrumless. The jury also dete1mined that $230,000.00 was a reasonable\n\n     fee for necessary legal services ofHoang's attorney.\n\n4.   The Gilberts now move the Court for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict regarding the\n\n     recoverability of attorney's fees of the Hoang's lawyer, as there was never any claim for\n\n     recovery of (nor did she disclose or prove) any damages as a result of the Gilberts' alleged\n\n     breach of contract. Additionally, there was no evidence of consideration to the Gilberts for\n\n     their promise.   Further, Hoang's Counsel did not properly allocate her attorney's fees\n\n     between the time spent defending against the Gilberts' claims and that incurred for the\n\n     counterclaim. Finally, Hoang cannot use a declru:atory judgment solely as a vehicle to\n\n     recover attorney's foes.\n\n\n\n\n                                         Page2of 11\n\n\n\n                                                                                            435\n\f                                             II.\n      DEFENDANT HOANG DID NOT SEEK- NOR RECOVER-DAMAGES\n\n5.   To obtain an award of attorney's fees under Section 38.001 of the Civil Practice and\n\n     Remedies Code, a party must (1) prevail on a cause of action for which attorney's fees are\n\n     recoverable, and (2) recover damages. State Fann Life I,1s. Co. v. Beaston, 907 S.W.2d 430,\n\n     437 (Tex.1995); See also Rodg,!ts v. RAB lnvestnutnts, Ltd., 816 S.W.2d 543, 551\n\n     (Tex.App. -Dallas 1991, 110 writ), A party mu.st satisfy tlte two re(Juirements to recover\n\n     attorney's fees. See State at 437.\n\n6.   Here, Defendant Hoang presented neither pleadings nor a shl'ed of evidencc upon which she\n\n     might have independently recovered actual damages as a result ol' any lrrcach of contract by\n\n     the Gilbe1ts. Likewise (and due to the lack of pleading and. proof), the jury did not award\n\n     any actual or even \"nominal\" damages to Hoang. Jn her Fourth Amended Answer and\n\n     Counte!'claim. HoUllg filed a counterclaim fo1· breach of contract, promissmy estoppel, and\n\n     plead fol' n declaratory judgment based on one sentence in the Acceptance Title and Closing\n\n     Document. ln this claim, Defendant Hoang claimed, \"As a result of the Counter-Defendants\n\n     breach of their hold haimless agreement. Counter-Plaintiff has been damaged in an amount\n\n     of not less than $50,000.00.\" This is the only time Hoang ever mentioned any damages\n\n     suffered, and despite this, she proved-up no specific instance of ham1 caused by the\n\n     Plaintiffs' alleged breach, and she made no claim for actual damages whatsoever.\n\n7.   l11roughout the entire three year litigation Hoang foiled lo plead or prove any specific\n\n     damage she suffered as a result of the alleged breach of contract. Although she served six\n\n     (6) separate sets of disclosures, Hoang never set forth any damages she suffered or incun-ed\n\n\n                                          Page3of 11\n\n\n\n                                                                                           436\n\f      caused by or even due to Gilberts' alleged breach of contract, nor did she ever disclose any\n\n      specific monetmy value of such damages. Hoang only pied recove1y of teasonablc and\n\n      necessary attorney's fees. Additionally, throughout trial Hoang presented no testimonial or\n\n      documentary evidence of how, and by what amount, the alleged breach damaged her. Again,\n\n      the only evidence of a dollar amount of anything lhal was presented was of attorney's fees\n\n      allegedly incu!'red.\n\n8.    In Green Intern., Inc. v. Solis, although the jury found that Solis failed to comply with the\n\n      Woodville Subcontract, !he Jury awmded zero damages to Green for this breach. Because\n\n      Green failed 10 recover damages on its breach of co11tract claim. Green was not entitled to\n\n      recover attorney's fees under Section 38.001. Green int'/, J11c. v. So{ls, 951 S.W.2d 384, 390\n\n      (Tex.1997).\n\n9.    Hoang did not even present evidence of nominal damages from which to attach an award of\n\n      attorney's fees. The law requires a counter-plaintiff to recover some damages in order to be\n\n      awarded attorney's fees. \"If the law were otherwise, it would follow that it is available for\n\n      virtually every debtor, heing sued for the nonpayment ol' a contractual obligation to pay. to\n\n      file a 'counterclaim' asse11ing that he has sustained a 'loss' in the amount being sued for by\n\n      his creditor, and if the debtor is SLtccessful in defeating 1U1y part of the claim, lie is entitled lo\n\n      attorney's fees as an adjunct to his counterclaim.\" rrr Commercial Fin Co171. v. Riehn, 796\n\n      S.W.2d 248. 256 (Tex.App. - Dallas 1990, no writ).\n\n10.   1n sumnuu·y, because Defendant Hoang did not present evidence of damages resulting from\n\n      her breach of contract claim. Section 38.001 of the Texas Civil Practices and Remedies\n\n      Code;, does not allow recove1y of attorney's fees.\n\n                                              Page4of 11\n\n\n\n                                                                                                     437\n\f                                 III.\n      NO CONSIDERATION BETWEEN THE GILBERTS AND DEFENDANT HOANG\n\nlL      To prove   ru1   action for breach of contract. a plaintiff must establish the existence of    im\n\n\n        enforceable contract.

The elements of an enforceable contt·uct aJ'e:\n\n        (1) an offer; (2) an acceptance in suict compliance with the terms of the offer; (3) a meeting\n\n        of the minds; (4) a communication that each pm1y consented to the terms of the contract; (5)\n\n        execution and delivery of the contract with an intent ii become mutual and binding on both\n\n        pal'lies; Md (6) consideration.

(citing Alex Shuslwnojf Mgmt. Servs., L.P. v. Johnson, 209 S.W.3d 644,\n\n        659 (Tex.2006)). Consideration consists of either a benefit to the promisor or a detiiment lo\n\n        the promise.

Angelou v. African\n\n        Overseas Union, 33 S.W.3d 269, 280 (Tex.App.-Houston [14u1 Dist.] 2000, no pet);\n\n        Westergnm v. Natio11al Pmperty Holdings, LP., 409 S.W.3d 110, 130 (Tex.App.-Houston\n\n        [14'11 Dist.], 2013). But the bollom line is th:it there must be some consideration.\n\n12.     Here. there was no evidence presented al trial (or any stage oflitigation) which established\n\n        consideration passing from the Plaintiffs to the Defendant Hoang. Additionally. there is no\n\n        evidence of an offer, acceptance, 01· a meeting ol' the minds. The Gilbe11s merely signed the\n\n\n                                               Page5of II\n\n\n\n                                                                                                    438\n\f      Acceptance of Title and Closing Document: concerning the Chau Defendants only. Hoang\n\n      never signed the document, nor was she a party to it.\n\n13.   The Acceptance Agreement stated: \"The undersigned Purchasers acknowledge that neither\n\n      the Real Estate Agent(s), or Broker(s) or FIDELITY NATIONAL TITLE INSURANCE\n\n      COMPANY have made any watrnnties or representations as lo the condition of the above\n\n      referenced prope1ty, or as to the requirements of the parties under their contract of sale, a:nd\n\n      accordingly, the undersigned Purchasers release and hold them hamlless from any and all\n\n      liability in regard to the same.\" See Exhibit A. Hoang based her breach of contract claim on\n\n      this boilerplate language which did not specifically name the sellers' realtor, Chi True\n\n      Hoang, in a contrnct fo1· which Defendant Hoang was not a party, and gave no\n\n      considel'ation.\n\n14.   Additionally, even if Hoang had been a party to this agreement, and there was proper\n\n      consideration for the Gilberts' promise, this clause was a contract of adhesion. That is, the\n\n      Gilbe1ts were required to execute this document ill 01·der to pw·chase the home. Texas law\n\n      defines an adhesion contract as a contract in which one party has absolutely no bargaining\n\n      power or ability to change the contract terms. See /11 re H.E. Butt Groce1y Co.• 17 S.W.3d\n\n      360, 370-71 (Tex.App.-Houston [14d' Dist.] 2000. orig. proceeding). Here, the Plaintiffs had\n\n      no opportunity to negotiate this provision, or negotiate an alternative one. This language was\n\n      placed in the middle of literally hundreds of pages of legal documents, and not pointed out\n\n      to the Gilbe11s. TI1e Gilberts cmmot be held liable for signing such an agreement which was\n\n      not discussed nor negotiated between any patties at closing - least of all. lhe Plaintiffs or\n\n      Defendant Hoang.\n\n                                            Page 6 of ll\n\n\n\n                                                                                                439\n\f15.   As a maUer of law, lhe Plainliffs cannot be held liable for filing suit against Defendant\n\n      Hoang for violations of the DTPA and fraud, which may have violated such a contract of\n\n      adhesion.\n\n                                               IV.\n                  COUNSEL FOR HOANG FAILED TO ALLOCATE FEES\n\n16.   l11e general rule is that attorney's fees must be segregated between those services rendered\n\n      for prosecuting a suit, and fees for services renderoo in defense of a claim against a\n\n      defendant. Hannes v. Arklatex Corp .. 615 S.W.2d 177, 180 (Tex,1981). One claiming\n\n      attorney's fees has the burden of proof to segregate those recoverable from an opponent\n\n      ti·om those which are not. Natural Gas Clearinghouse v. Midgard Energy Co., I 13 S.W.3d\n\n      400, 416-17 (Tex.App.-Amarillo 2003, pet. denied); Hmska v. First State Bank, 747 S.W.2d\n\n      783, 785 (Tex. 1988).\n\n17.   For the Defendant Hoang to recover attorney's fees, she must distinguish between the fees\n\n      incurred while defending against the Plaintiffs' claims of fraud and violations of the DTPA\n\n      from those incurred in pursuing her claim for breach of contract. Defendant Hoang did not\n\n      allocate or otherwise segregate her fees in this regard. The law requires her to introduce\n\n      evidence to show what portion of the attorney's fees was applicable to the counterclaim fol'\n\n      hreach of contract. Instead, she submitted to the jury, one lump sum, commingling all fees\n\n      incull'ed for the defense of the Gilberts' claims, and the breach of contract/counterclaim\n\n      cause or action. There was no evidence by which the jury could apportion the atto111ey's fees\n\n      between the defense and the prosecution of the countet•claim.\n\n18.   As a matter of fact, Hoang did not file her counterclaims for breach of contract and\n\n\n                                          Page7of II\n\n\n\n                                                                                             440\n\f        promissory esloppel until March 1. 2013. Clearly. all fees incu1Tcd prior lo lhis dale go\n\n        towards defending ngainst the Plaintiffs' claims of fraud and violntions of the OTPA.\n\n        Tirns. even if the Court were to take over the jury's fact-finding duti.es at this point in the\n\n        case (which would be improper). all fees incurred prior to Mmch 1, 2013 would not be\n\n        recoverable.\n\n19.     lf Hoang could recover attorney's fees (despite the fact that she did not present evidence of\n\n        damages for the alleged breach of contract), she cannot he awarded the amount found by the\n\n        jury because she failed to distinguish which fees m·e ac!uulJy recoverable in prosecution of\n\n        the counlerclaim.\n\n                                                  v.\n      HOANG'S DECLARATORY JUDGMENT SOUGHT NO AFFRIMATIVE RELIEF\n\n20.     A declaratory judgment is not appropriate when a controversy is already pending, and the\n\n        declaratory judgment simply answers the claims and asks for no relief outside the scope of\n\n        the main suit.

To state a claim\n\n      for affirmative relief, a defensive pleading must assert. a cause of action independent of the\n\n      claims already asserted by the plaintiff. i.e.. the defendant could recover benefits.\n\n      compensation. or relief. even if the plaintiff abandoned its cause of action. Id. For example,\n\n      in suits asse11ing breaches of contracts or deeds, where declaratory counterclaims seeking\n\n      construction of such instruments may constitute claims for affimmtive relief because, in\n\n      contrast to a \"one-time occurrence\" giving rise to the plaintiff's suit, they concern the\n\n      partjes' ongoing and future relationship. Id.\n\n21.   Hoang did not seek any affimiative relief for her claim of breach of contract for which she\n\n      basis her declaratory Judgment. She has not made a claim to recover benefits. nor does she\n\n      seek compensation or relief from the alleged breach. There is nothing in the language of this\n\n      clause that concerns any on-going relationship between the Plaintiffs and Hoang. In fact,\n\n      Hoang is not even a pm1y to the agreement in the first place. TI1is is boilerplate language\n\n      which does not specifically name the defendant.\n\n22.   In filing for a declaratory judgment on her breach of contract claim, the Defend.ant Hoang is\n\n      requesling just that: a declaration that the Plaintiffs btcachoo their contract. There are no\n\n      damages sought. As stated previously, Defendant Hoang did not present any evidence of\n\n      damages attributable to this alleged breach. mid the jury did 1101 find any such damages.\n\n23.   While the jury did find that the Plaintiffs breached the clause lo release m1d hold harmless\n\n      the Defendant Hoang - and may be entiUed to a judgment on this basis - this declaratory\n\n                                            Page 9 of J l\n\n\n\n                                                                                              442\n\f      judgment cannot be used as a vehicle for the Defendant Hoang to recover attorney's fees in\n\n      the absence of claimed or proven damages.\n\n                                             VI.\n                                         CONCLUSION\n\n24.   Hoang cannot collect a judgment for any award of attorney's fees the jury may have found\n\n      \"reasonable.\" Hoang did not recover any damages from her breach of contract claim;\n\n      produced no evidence of consideration for the Gilberts' promise to hold hannless unnamed\n\n      realtors; did not properly allocate her attorney's fees; and she caimot use a declaratory\n\n      judgment solely as a vehicle to recover attorney's fees.\n\n25.

In support of her motion for entry of judgment and\n\nin further response and opposition to Plaintiffs' JNOV, Hoang rnspectfully shows the court as\n\nfollows:\n\n                                         BACKGROUND\n\n        1.     Plaintiff brought claims against Hoang for violations under the Texas Deceptive\n\nTrade Practice Act., for fraud, statutory fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud.\n\n       2.      Hoang brought counter-claims against Plaintiffs for damages and attorney fees under\n\nthe Texas Declaratory Judgment Act and for breach of contract based upon the hold harmless\n\nagreement in the Acceptance of Title and Closing Agreements (the \"Acceptance Agreement\"). The\n\nAcceptance Agreement was signed by Plaintiffs specifically to hold Defendants harmless from the\n\nexact type offrivilous claims that were alleged against Hoang by Plaintiffs.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                     484\n\f       3.      After 7 full days of trial, the case was submitted to the jury. The Court submitted\n\nHoang's questions as to whether Plaintiffs' breached the Acceptance Agreement.\n\n       4.      Hoang specifically requested a specific damage question, but the Court refused the\n\nsubmission stating that since the only damages were in the nature of attorneys fees, the question on\n\nHoang' s attorneys fees was sufficient.\n\n       5.      The jury subsequently rendered its verdict A tiue and correct copy of the Jury\n\nVerdict is attached hereto as Exhibit \"A\".\n\n       6.      The Jury specifically found that:\n\n               a.     Hoang did not engage in any false, misleading or deceptive act or practice\n                      that Plaintiffs relied upon to their detriment and that was a producing cause\n                      of damage to them; and\n\n               b.     Hoang did not engage in any unconscionable action or course of action that\n                      was a producing cause to Plaintiffs; and\n\n               c.     Hoang did not commit fraud against Plaintiffs; and\n\n               d.     Hoang did not commit statutory fraud against Plaintiff; and\n\n               e.     Hoang was not part of a conspiracy to commit fraud;\n\n       7.      The Jury specifically found tliat Plaintiff filed to comply with release and hold\n\nharmless agreement. This jury quesiion was predicated upon no findings on any type ofwrong-doing\n\nby Hoang. Since Hoang did not engage in any wrong doing and the jury expressly found such, the\n\nexpress negligence doctrine does not apply to the hold hamiless agreement.\n\n       8.      The jury also found that a reasonable fee necessary for the services of Hoang's\n\nattorneys was $230,000.00.\n\n       9.      On November 25, 2014 Plaintiffs filed the JNOV.\n\n        10.    Hoang filed her Judgment Motion on November 26, 2014.\n\n\n\n                                                   -2-\n\n\n\n                                                                                              485\n\f        11.     After an initial hearing on both Motions, this Court requested additional briefing: on\n\n1) what would constitute \"fair and equitable\" under the Texas Declaratory Judgment Act, 2) whether\n\nattorneys fees' can be damages for a breach of the hold hamiless agreement, and 3) whether the hold\n\nharmless agreement needed to be conspicuo11s.\n\n                                ARGUMENTS & AUTHORITIES\n\nI.     The Court has discretion to awal'd Iloang her attorneys' fe~s under Tex. Ci\\/. Prac. &\n       Rem. Code Ann. §37.009\n\n       A.      Awarding Hoang attorneys fees under §37.009 is equitable and Just\n\n        12.     Under the Texas Declaratmy Judgment Act (\"the Declaratmy Judgment Act\"), a\n\ncourt may award costs and reasonable and necessary attorney's t'ees as which are equitable and just.\n\nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 37.009. Under the Declaratmy Judgment Act, the Court lias the\n\ndiscretion to award attorneys fees. Bocq11e1 v. Herring, 972 S.W.2d 19, 20 (Tex.1998)\n\n        13.     The Declaratory Judgment Act imposes four limitations on the Court's discretion:;\n\nI) that the fees are reasonable; 2) that the fees are necessary; 3) that the fees are equitable and 4) that\n\nthe fees are just. The first two limitations, reasonable and necessary are fact issues which should\n\nbe decided by the trier of the fact and the second two limitations, fair and equitable are legal issues\n\nthat are matters oflaw to be decided by the Court.

In tJ1e present case, the Cornt submitted the issue of reasonable and necessary to the\n\njury to decide. The jury handed down a verdict that the reasonable and necessary attorneys fees for\n\ntl1e services of Hoang's attorneys was $230,000. See Exhibit\" A\", Question 13 at p.16. Therefore,\n\nthis Court must now decide if the attorneys fees being sought by Hoallg are equitable and just.\n\n        IS.     Equitable and just are questions oflaw for the Court to decide.

Awarding Hoang her attorneys foes in this case is equitable and just The testimony\n\nsolicited by the Plaintiffs' counsel was that Hoang's attorneys fees were equal or close to what he\n\nwas asking the jury to award him in his casein chief. 1 There was no great dispa!'ity in the amounts\n\nbeing sought by Hoang. The jury found the fees to be reasonable and necessary. As shown below,\n\nHoang only incurred the fees because, despite having little or no evidence against Hoang, Plaintiffs\n\nhad persisted in bringing the claims against her all the way through trial, despite executing the hold\n\nharmless agreement.\n\n        17.     Plaintiffs initiated the lawsuit against Hoang based upon frivilous claims of alleged\n\nfraud and statutory fraud. Plaintiffs, through trial, had essentially no evidence to support their\n\nallegations. This was confirmed by the ju1y findings. See Ex. A. The only evidence presented by\n\nP)aintiffs against Hoang was theinconsistenttestimony ofaco-defendantAndy Dang, whom the jury\n\nfound not credible. Plaintiffs admitted that there had been no representations or misrepresentations\n\nto them by Hoang, having never spoken to her except to exchange pleasantries at closing. No\n\n\n\n        'The jury awarded Plaintiff's attorney $205,000 for attorneys fees and appellate attorneys\nfees of $41,000 and $25,000 making a total award to Plaintiffs' attorney of$271,000. See Ex. A\n                                                  -4.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                 487\n\findependent evidence of any of Plaintiffsallegations against Hoang existed, yet Plaintiffs forced her\n\nto defend herself for the better pa11 of three (3) years against their unfounded allegations.\n\n       18.     Moreover, Plaintiffs testified throughout the trial that they brought suit against at\n\nleast two other parties, Grace Inspection Homes, Inc. and Michael Nguyen, whom they did not\n\nbelieve did anything wrong, but had insurance or were a source of funds for the lawsuit. Plaintiffs'\n\nown attorney admitted in his closing arguments that the jury should not hold his clients 1·esponsible\n\nfor his advise to sue parties for the sole purpose that they had were sources ofincome, not because\n\nthey were liable in any manner.\n        19.     Plaintiffs, although they do not willingly admit it, sued Hoang for exactly the same\n\nreason. Plaintiffs sued Hoang in hopes of getting a judgment that they could then take against the\n\nTexas Real Estate Tn1st fund, not because they really believed that she misled them or had\n\nknowledge of any of the water damage. Plaintiffs' did not have any knowledge of anythh1g that\n\nHoang knew until several months into the case when Dang testified inconsistently that he did or\n\ndidn't tell her about the water damage in his deposition. By this time, tliey had already sued Hoang.\n\nHoang consistently took the position that she had no knowledge. of any water damage and the Jury\n\nfounder her to be credible. Plaintiffs' and Plaintiffs' counsels' conduct of suing innocent people just\n\nto fund their lawsuit justifies the award of attorneys fees under the equitable and just standard.\n\n        20.     Further, despite having executed and willingly entered into the Acceptance\n\nAgreement at closing which contained the release and hold harmless agreement, Plaintiffs persisted\n\nin bringing claims against Hoang. Plaintiffs' actions cost .Hoang at least $210,000.00 in legal fees\n\nas the cost of defonse. 2\n\n\n\n        2lnfact, by bringing the JNOV, Plaintiffs are continuing to cost Hoang attorneys fees,\nAlthough the jury did not find any appellate fees, this Cou11 can. award the same under the same\nstandards as set forth in this brief. Hoang should be entitled to additional attorneys fees of not\n\n                                                  -5-\n\n\n\n                                                                                                 488\n\f       21.      The ju1y, as the trier of fact, did not find Hoang guilty of any wrong doing. More\n\nimportantly, the Jury through their answer afiirmed that Plaintiffs not only agreed to hold Hoang\n\nharmless, but actually failed to do so. Awarding Hoang her attorneys' fees', based on the jury's\n\nfact findings, is \"equitable and just.\" See AVCO C0171.. Textron Lycoming Reciprocali11g E'ngine\n\nDiv. ofAVCO Corp. v. lnwrstate Somlzwest, /,rd., 251 S.WJd 632, 670 (Tex,App.~Bouston [14\n\nDist.],2007).\n\n       B.       Hoang's Declaratory Judgment Action was P1·operly Pied\n\n       22.      In the present case, Hoang brought an action under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code\n\n§37.001 et seq., seeking a declaration that Plaintiffs released Hoang under the hold hannless\n\nagreement in the Acceptance Agreement. The Declaratory Judgment action was not filed solely as\n\na means to recover attorneys fees as Plaintiff argue. Only when a party brings a declaratory\n\njudgment action by way of a counterclaim or amended petition and the declaratory judgment\n\ninvolves only issues already raised by the original claim, does Plaintiffs' argument prevail.

Hoang is Also Entitle to Attorneys Fees as Damages for .Breach of the Hold Harmless\n       Agreement\n\n       27.     Although the Court can award the attorneys fees under §37.009, and does not need\n\nto reach the question as to whether Hoang is entitled to the $230,000 as damages under her breach\n\nof contract action, this Court requested briefing on the issue.\n\n       A.      Damages in the Form of Attorneys Fees Are Proper under Hold Harmless\n               Agreements\n\n               1.      Hoang Can Recover Attorneys Fees as Damages\n\n       28.     Plaintiffs argue that Hoang catmotrecover attorneys fees as damages under §38.00 l.\n\nHowever, Hoang disagrees that the attorneys' fees cannot be damages and does not necessarily seek\n\nthem under §3 8.00 I. Hoang was seeking her damages for breach of a hold harm less agreement. As\n\nsuch, the only damages Hoang could have sustained was her cost of defending the lawsuit, i.e. her\n\nattorneys' fees which are recoverable 11nder Texas law.\n\n       29.     Texas law is clear that an indemnitee may recover the expenses of litigating an\n\nindemnified claim ifindemnity arises either under law or under a contract.

Similarly in the present case, Plaintiffs under the Acceptance Agreement agreed to\n\nhold harmless Hoang from any claims brought regarding the condition of the property. Despite this\n\nagreement, Plaintiffs, brought such claims against Hoang themselves. Not only is it equitable and\n\njust to award Hoang her attorneys fees under §37.009, Hoang would be entitled to recover her costs\n\nand expenses under the hold harmless agreement which the jury found that Plaintiffs breached.

Under hold harn1less agreements, attorneys fees are awarded as damages nad not\n\nunder §38..00 I. See Crimson Exploration, 341 S.W.3d at 446.\n\n               2.      Ho11ngProperly Submitted her damage question 11nd the Court's refusal\n                       to submit it to the jury was error\n\n       33.     Plaintiffs further argue that attorney's fees to Hoang are improper becaL1sethere was\n\nno separate findings of actual damages other than the attorneys fees' awarded to Hoang. However,\n\nHoang did submit a jury question on damages and the Court refused the submission, stating since\n\nthe only damages that Hoang incun·ed were the costs of defense, i.e. her attorneys fees, therefore a\n\nseparate damage question was not necessary. If such refusal, as shown below, is not a deemed\n\nfinding, it would be reversible error. By requesting the question and the Court refusing it on the\n\nrecord, Hoang as preserved the error. See D{d/as Mkr Ctr. Dev. Co. v Uedeker, 958 S. W. 2d 382,\n\n386-387 (Tex. 1987) overruled on other f1ro1mds Torringto11 Co. v Stutzman, 46 S.W.3d 829 (Tex.\n\n2000) (Error can be preserved by court stating on the record that the jury question is refused).\n\n       34.     When a trial court omits a jury question, the party who relies on that question must\n\ntender that question in writing in substantially correct form and obtain a ruling in order to preserve\n\nerror.

An oral ruling by a court on a written request will suffice \"when the court's refusal\n\nis otherwise clear from the record.\" Liedeker, 958 S.W.2d at 3S7. Ill Liedeker, the record reflected\n\nthat the appellant submitted written requests to the tial judge, the judge said he would sign them\n\nlater, and through inadvertence the judge never signed them. The Supreme court held that the trial\n\n\n\n                                                 -JO-\n\n\n                                                                                                493\n\fcourt's \"statements on the record clearly prese1ved [appellant]'s complaint.'' Liedeke,; 58 S.W.2d\n\nat 387.\n          36.   Similarly, in the present case, Hoang court specifically asked for her actual damage\n\nquestion. The Court refused the submission stating that since the only damages that Hoang were\n\nseeking were her attorneys fees, such question was not necessary. The Court did not submit the\n\nquestion, and inadvettently forgot to sign the question presented to it by Hoang's counsel.\n\nTherefore, Hoang's question on damages was preserved.\n\n                3..    lloang's Attorneys .Fees as Damages is a Deemed Finding\n\n          37.   Since Hoang did submit a separate question as to damages to this Court, and the\n\nCourt refused the submission of such question, and Plaintiff never objected to the submission of the\n\nattorneys' fees and the breach ofcontract/release questions, the issue that attorneys fees are damages\n\nis a \"deemed finding. This Court can enter a finding as such,\n          3S.   Tex. R. Civ. P. 279 provides that when a ground of recovery or defense consists of\n\nmore than one element, ifone or more of such elements necessary to sustain such ground of recovery\n\nor defense, and necessarily referable thereto, are submitted to and fo,mdby the jury, and one or more\n\nof such elements are omitted from the charge, without request or objection, and there is factually\n\nsufficient evidence to support a finding thereon, the trial court, at any time befol'e the judgment is\nrendered, can make and file written findit1gs 011 such omitted element or elements in support of the\n\njudgment. lfno such written findings are made, such omitted element or elements shall be deemed\n\nfound.by the court in such manner as to support the judgment Tex. R. Civ. P, 279.\n\n          39.   Itis undisputed that tl1ejury awarded Hoang her reasonable and necessaiy fees in the\n\nsum of$230,000.00. The Court can make a written finding that such attorneys fees constituted the\n\ndamages. Even if no such written findings are made, such omitted element or elements shall be\n\n\n                                                 -I 1-\n\n\n                                                                                                494\n\fdeemed found by the court in such manner as to support the judgment. See Gu((S1ates Utilities Co.\n\nv. Low, 79 S.W.3d 561, 564-66 (Tex. 2002).\n       40.     In Low, the Court held that \"when an incomplete theory is submitted withot1t\n\ncomplaint, the parties are deemed to have waived a jury trial on the omitted issue and to have a.greed\n\nto submit the issue to the trial court.

More importantly, Plaintiffs, against who tl1e issue would be deemed, had an\n\nopportunity to object to the submission of the two jury questions without the damage question.\n\nPlaintiffs did not object. They cannot now complain that the damage issue was missing since they\n\ndid not object prior to the submission of such issues. See DiGuesppe v Lawler, 269 S.W.3d 588, 599\n\n(Tex. 2008).\n\n       42.     If one or more elements is omitted from the charge, then the omitted element must\n\nbe deemed found by the trial court in a manner that supports its judgment. Chon Tri v J. T.

Since Hoang submitted the proper jury question and the jury found the reasonable\n\nand necessary fees, the issue of attorneys fees as damages is a deemed finding and the Court should\n\nenter the judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -12-\n\n\n\n                                                                                                495\n\f        B.

If an indemnity agreement or hold harmless agreement seeks to limit a party's\n\nliability for its own negligence, then the party attempting to limit is liability must give fair notice\n\nand the clause should be conspicuousness. See Dresser Indus., Inc. v. Page Petroleum, Inc., 853\n\nS.W.2d 505, 507-09 (Tex.l993). Under the express negligence doctline, a party who wishes to\n\ncontractually shift risk from itself for the consequences of its future negligence must specifically\n\nexpress that intent within the four corners of an agreement. See Ethyl Coq1. v. Daniel Constr. Co.,\n\n725 S. W.2d 705, 707-08 (Tex.1987); Dresser Indus .• Inc.• 853 S.W .2d at 508.\n\n       45.     Fairnotice requirements to indemnity agreements and releases only apply when such\n\nexculpatory agreements are utilized to relieve a party of liability for its own negligence in adva11ce.\n\nDresser, 853 S.W.2d at 508. In the present case, Hoang was not attempting to shift liability for her\n\nown negligence. She is not seeking indemnity for the consequences of her own negligence. No\n\nclaims of negligence were brought against Hoang by Pla.intiffs or any third parties. No third patties\n\nare seeking any claims against the Plaintiffs that are attributable to the conduct of Hoang, nor is\n\nHoang seeking to be indemnified for any such claims by any third parties. Further, Hoang is a third\n\nparty beneficiary to the Acceptance Agreement. There was no attempt to shift liability and there is\n\nno indemnific.ation for \"the consequences\" of a party's own negligence.\n\n       46.     Hoang is seeki ngrecovery due to the conduct of the Plaintiffs. Hoang is not utilizing;\n\nthe hold harmless language to relieve herself from liability for her own negligence, instead she is\n\nutilizing the agreement/release to impose liability upon the Plaintiffs for their own conduct and\n\nbreach in b1inging their claims against Hoang.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -13-\n\n\n\n                                                                                                496\n\f        C.

In Dresser, the Defendant pied and established the release as an affomative defense\n\nand obtained a finding that the plaintiffs representative had the authority to bind plaintiff to the\n\nagreement. Consequently, plaintiff had the burden of obtaining any finding that would avoid the\n\neffect of the release.

Further, Plaintiffs did not raise objections with the Court to challenge the\n\nconspicuousness of the release language or with respect to any other provision of the agreement,\n\nHaving made no ar1,,1.1ment regarding conspicuousness at trial, Plaintiffs arguments as to conspicuous\n\nare waived.

Code\n\n§37.009 because the jury found the fees to be reasonable and necessary and such fees would be\n\nequitable and just. Hoang was merely a victim ofPlaintiffs' own litigation and conduct and the jury\n\nfound   110   wrong-doing by Hoang that would have released Plaintiffs from the hold harmless\n\n                                                  -14-\n\n\n\n                                                                                                  497\n\fagreement. The only protection that Hoang would be afforded under the hold harmless agreement\n\nwould be the award of her attorneys fees.\n\n        52.

The\n\njury returned its verdict finding (1) that Hoang was not liable to Appellees for any of\n\nthe Appellees’ claims against Hoang and (2) that Appellees breached the hold\n\nharmless agreement. The jury then awarded Hoang $230,000 for her attorney’s fees\n\nwhich she incurred as damages under the hold harmless agreement. Appellees then\n\nfiled their JNOV. Appellees’ argument in the JNOV centered solely on the issue that\n\nno separate jury issue was submitted for damages and attorney’s fees were not\n\nrecoverable as damages. Hoang filed her response opposing the JNOV since\n\nAppellees were not entitled to judgment as a matter of law because attorney’s fees are\n\ndamages under hold harmless indemnity agreements. Alternatively, Hoang argued\n\nthat since the jury found a breach of the hold harmless agreement and found\n\nreasonable attorney’s fees, she was entitled to attorney’s fees under her claims\n\npursuant to Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §37.001 et seq (the “Texas Declaratory\n\n\n\n\n                                          -1-\n\fJudgment Act”). The Trial Court granted the JNOV and entered a take nothing\n\njudgment in favor of Appellees. It is from this judgement that Hoang appeals.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f             STATEMENT OF ORAL ARGUMENT\n\nThe Court should grant oral argument for the following reasons:\n\n      a.

Anh Van Dang and Hong Bich Chau\n\n(collectively “Chau” or “Seller”) for violations of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act,\n\nfraud, statutory fraud and civil conspiracy to commit fraud arising out of the purchase\n\nof a piece of property in Harris County, Texas (the “Property”). CR 105-107. Chau\n\nwas the seller of the Property and Hoang was the real estate agent for the Seller. CR\n\n23-31, RR 35-37.\n\n      Appellees’ claims against Hoang centered solely on the argument that Hoang\n\nfailed to disclose and/or misrepresented material information about the condition of\n\nthe Property which Appellees claim Hoang had gained from her knowledge as the real\n\nestate agent for the Seller. CR 105-107. Hoang brought counterclaims for (1) breach\n\nof a hold harmless agreement that was signed by Appellees at closing which was part\n\nof the Acceptance of Title and Closing Agreements (“Acceptance Agreement”) and\n\n(2) for a declaratory judgment seeking to establish that the hold harmless provision\n\nin the Acceptance Agreement released Hoang from any liability. CR 156-165.\n\n      Appellees do not dispute signing the Acceptance Agreement. The Acceptance\n\nAgreement clearly stated that Appellees “acknowledge that neither the Real Estate\n\nAgent(s) or Broker(s) . . . have made any warranties or representations as to the\n\ncondition of the above referenced property . . . and accordingly the undersigned\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fPurchasers release and hold them harmless from any and all liability in regard to\n\nthe same.” SCR at 266.\n\n      Since the breach of the hold harmless agreement was the act of Appellees suing\n\nHoang, the only damages that Hoang could claim in her counterclaims were the her\n\ncosts to defend herself against the actions of the Appellants who had agreed to hold\n\nher harmless under the Acceptance Agreement.          These damages constituted her\n\nattorney’s fees. CSR at 266. RR 41-42, RR11.\n\n      The case was tried to a jury in November 2014. At the jury charge conference,\n\nHoang requested and submitted a standard form breach of contract question, a\n\nstandard form breach of contract damages question, and a standard form reasonable\n\nand necessary attorney’s fees question, all from the Texas Pattern Jury Charge. Due\n\nto the fact that Appellees had sued Hoang for fraud, Hoang’s questions were\n\nconditioned upon the jury’s finding that Hoang was not liable to Appellees on any of\n\ntheir causes of action against her. Because Hoang’s breach of contract question was\n\nconditioned on findings of no liability by Hoang, the only damages arising from the\n\nhold harmless obligation were attorney’s fees.\n\n      The Trial Court submitted the conditioned breach of contract question and the\n\nreasonable and necessary attorney’s fees question to the jury, but refused to submit the\n\nbreach of contract damages question. The Trial Court refused the submission of the\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fbreach of contract damage question because the only damages, if any, arising from the\n\nhold harmless obligation were Hoang’s cost of defense, i.e. her attorney’s fees.\n\nTherefore, the Trial Court concluded that a question on the amount of reasonable and\n\nnecessary attorney’s fees was sufficient to establish Hoang’s damages. CR 306-339;\n\nRR Vol.3 at 5, Vol. 4 at 15:16. Hoang’s counsel objected on the record to the Trial\n\nCourt’s refusal to submit the contract damages question. RR Vol. 3 at 53. The Trial\n\nCourt overruled the objection for the reason that the attorney’s fee question submitted\n\nwould cover the damages for the breach of contract cause of action damages. CR 406;\n\nRR Vol3 at 53; RR Vol. 4 at 15-16. The Trial Court property submitted the question\n\nas to whether the Appellees breached the Acceptance Agreement with respect to\n\nHoang. CR 421-22.\n\n      The case was submitted to the jury on November 20, 2014 without the breach\n\nof contract damages question for Hoang. The jury found:\n\n             a.     Hoang did not engage in any false, misleading or deceptive act or\n                    practice that Appellees relied upon to their detriment and that was\n                    a producing cause of damage to them; and\n\n             b.     Hoang did not engage in any unconscionable action or course of\n                    action that was a producing cause to Appellees; and\n\n             c.     Hoang did not commit fraud against Appellees; and\n\n             d.     Hoang did not commit statutory fraud against Appellees and\n\n             e.     Hoang was not part of a conspiracy to commit fraud;\n\n                                          -7-\n\f             f.    Appellees breached the agreement to release and hold Hoang\n                   harmless.\n\nCR 409-413, 418, 421. However, the jury did find that the Seller had committed\n\nfraud and awarded Appellees in excess of 1.2 million in damages against the Seller.\n\nCR 409-413, 415-417, 420\n\n      Based on finding that Hoang had not committed any wrongdoing, the jury then\n\nanswered the questions approved by the Court with respect to Hoang’s counterclaims\n\nagainst the Appellees. The Jury found that Appellees failed to comply with the release\n\nand hold harmless agreement. CR 421. The jury also found that a reasonable fee\n\nnecessary for the services of Hoang’s attorney was $230,000.00. CR 422.\n\n      On November 25, 2014, Appellants filed their JNOV seeking to overrule the\n\nfindings of the jury and proposing to award Hoang nothing. CR 436-444. Hoang\n\nfiled her response on December 11, 2014. CR 484-499. Appellees’ argument in the\n\nJNOV centered solely on the issue that no separate jury issue was submitted for\n\ndamages and attorney’s fees were not recoverable as damages. Hoang filed her\n\nresponse opposing the JNOV since Appellees were not entitled to judgment as a\n\nmatter of law because attorney’s fees are damages under a hold harmless agreement.\n\nAlternatively, Appellees argued that because the jury found a breach of the hold\n\nharmless agreement and found reasonable attorney’s fees, she was entitled to\n\nattorney’s fees under her claims pursuant to Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §37.001 et\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fseq (the “Texas Declaratory Judgment Act”). On May 11, 2015, this Court entered a\n\njudgment overruling the Jury’s findings and entering a Judgment awarding a take\n\nnothing in favor of Appellants against Hoang. CR 501; CR 507-08.\n\n      Hoang filed her Motion for New Trial on June 9, 2011 which was overruled by\n\noperation of law. Hoang filed her Notice of appeal.

Civ. App.-Houston [1st\n\nDist.], writ ref’d). Since the only damages incurred by Hoang could be her attorney’s\n\nfees, the submission of the attorney’s fee questions and the jury’s finding was proper.\n\nTherefore, Hoang was entitled to the judgment against Appellees for the $230,000 as\n\nfound by the jury.\n\n      Alternatively, if the Court finds that a separate damages was necessary, the\n\nCourt erred in not submitting the question to the jury over Hoang’s objection. The\n\nTrial Court found the separate damages question to be duplicative and refused to\n\nsubmit it to the jury. Since Hoang did submit a jury question on contract damages and\n\nthe Court refused the submission, the issue that attorney’s fees are damages is a\n\n“deemed finding” and the Court can enter a finding as such. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 279.\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\f      The Trial Court also abused its discretion by not granting Hoang her attorney’s\n\nfees under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §37.009. Hoang properly pled her cause of\n\naction under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §37.009. The jury found the reasonable and\n\nnecessary attorney’s fees incurred by Hoang were $230,000. The fees were equitable\n\nand just in light of the circumstances of this case. Appellees, through counsel in\n\nclosing argument, admitted that they had brought suit in this case against at least two\n\nother parties, whom they did not believed did anything wrong, but had insurance or\n\nwere a source of funds for the lawsuit. Hoang was sued for exactly the same reason.\n\nAppellee’s and Appellees’ counsel’s conduct of suing innocent people just to fund\n\ntheir lawsuit justifies the award of attorney’s fees under the equitable and just\n\nstandard. Further, Appellees’ signing of a hold harmless agreement and then initiating\n\nsuit against the very party that they agreed to hold harmless justifies attorney’s fees\n\nunder the equitable and just standard. Furthermore, Appellees were awarded in excess\n\nof $1,2 million in damages , including treble damages for which they now own a\n\njudgment against the Seller for that amount. The award of attorneys’ fees as damages\n\nagainst Appellees will not impose the same type of financial burden on Appellees as\n\nin the typical case of a since losing plaintiff and a single prevailing defendant. Under\n\nthese circumstances, the award of attorneys fees to Hoang under Tex. Civ. Prac. &\n\nRem. Code §39.001 is just and equitable and the Court erred in not doing so.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\f                      ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES\n\nI.

The primary argument raised by\n\nAppellees in their JNOV was the assertion that there was not a separate question of\n\nactual damages, apart from the findings on attorney’s fees submitted to the jury and\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\fthat attorney’s fees are not recoverable as damages.        Appellees never raised this\n\nobjection at the charge conference, nor did they challenge the attorney’s fees question\n\nas submitted. Even if they had raised this objection, as shown below, the question on\n\ndamages was properly submitted. Alternatively, to the extent the question on damages\n\nwas not properly submitted, this Court can either award damages based on the deemed\n\nfindings or remand the case to the Trial Court solely to make a determination\n\nregarding the proper damages to be awarded as a result of Appellees’ breach of the\n\nhold harmless provision.\n\n      A.

In this case, it is undisputed that Hoang was the real estate agent for the\n\nChau, the Seller and that Appellees were aware at all times that Hoang was the real\n\nestate agent for Chau. Indeed, Appellees claims in this lawsuit relate to alleged failure\n\nto disclose and/or misrepresentations to Appellees by Hoang and the Seller. Because\n\nHoang’s identity was never in doubt, Hoang was protected by the release and hold\n\nharmless agreement in the Acceptance Agreement.\n\n      Furthermore, a release agreement, valid on its face is a complete bar to any\n\naction based on matters covered by the release, unless the release is set aside.

Furthermore, Hoang was not seeking her attorney’s fees\n\nunder under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §38.001, but rather Hoang was seeking\n\nher attorney’s fees as damages for breach of a hold harmless agreement. Under the\n\nhold harmless agreement and circumstances in the present case, the only damages\n\nHoang could have sustained was her cost of defending the lawsuit, i.e. her attorney’s\n\nfees which are recoverable as damages under Texas law.

OHIO INDEMNIFIED:\n\n      Ohio shall not be liable or responsible for and Contractor shall save and\n      hold harmless Ohio from and against any and all claims and damages of\n      every kind, for injury to or death of any person or persons and for all\n      damage to loss of property, arising out of or attributed, directly or\n      indirectly, to the operations of Contractor hereunder. Contractor shall\n      likewise indemnify Ohio for any or all injury or damage to property\n      belonging to Ohio for any or all injury or damage to property belonging\n      to Ohio, arising out of or in connection with or resulting from any and\n      all acts or omissions of Contractor hereunder.\n\n      17.     STATUTES TO BE COMPLIED WITH:\n\n             (a) Contractor agrees to comply with the Workmen’s\n      Compensation Act of the State of New Mexico and to pay or cause to be\n      paid all compensation, medical or hospital bills which may become due\n      or payable thereunder, and to protect and indemnify Ohio from and\n      against any and all liability by reason of injury of employees of\n      Contractor.

The Supreme Court affirmed the trial court’s\n\ndecision that the indemnitor was liable for both damages and legal fees and expenses\n\nunder these indemnity provisions. Ohio Oil Co., 365 S.W.2d at 623-24. The Court\n\nheld that when the indemnitor has agreed to save and hold harmless the indemnitee\n\nfrom liability for any and all claims and damages, the indemnitee is entitled to recover\n\nfrom the indemnitor all reasonable expenses incurred in defending the claim asserted\n\nagainst him. Ohio Oil Co., 365 S.W.2d at 627-28.\n\n      Similarly in Garcia, the Court examined the following indemnity provisions.’\n\n      3. The lessee [Texas Concrete Silo] . . . agrees. . . to pay all claims and\n      damages arising from defects in the machinery and equipment . . .\n\n      5. . . . lessee agrees to hold . . .

This hold harmless agreement\n      shall encompass any claims arising from either or both personal injury\n      and property damage . . .\n\nGarcia, 470 S.W.2d at 269.      The Garcia court held that these general provisions\n\nincluding indemnity for legal fees and expenses incurred by the indemnitee. See also\n\nMonical & Powell, 404 S.W.2d at 914 (court held that indemnitee may recover against\n\nthe indemnitor for all reasonable expenses in settling the claim against indemnitee).\n\n      In the present case, under the Acceptance Agreement, Appellees agreed to hold\n\nharmless Hoang from any liability in regard to claims arising from any alleged\n\n                                          -17-\n\fwarranties or representations as to the condition of the subject property. SCR 226.\n\nThe claims asserted against Hoang by the Appellees specifically related to purported\n\nwarranties and representations by Hoang regarding the condition of the subject\n\nproperty.

Therefore, Hoang is entitled to recover her costs and\n\nexpenses associated with defending the lawsuit under the hold harmless agreement\n\nwhich the jury found that Appellees breached.

The Express Negligence Doctrine Does Not Preclude Enforcement of\n              the Hold Harmless Provision\n\n       1.     The Express Negligence Doctrine Is Not Applicable\n\n       Appellees raised the argument that the hold harmless agreement was not\n\nconspicuous, did not provide fair notice and could not be used to limit Hoang’s\n\nliability for her own negligence. Not only did Appellees waive this defense, but the\n\nexpress negligence doctrine is not applicable.\n\n       If, an indemnity agreement or hold harmless agreement seeks to limit a party’s\n\nliability for its own negligence, the party attempting to limit its liability must give fair\n\nnotice and the clause should be conspicuousness.

Under the express negligence\n\ndoctrine, a party who wishes to contractually shift risk from itself for the\n\nconsequences of its future negligence must specifically express that intent within the\n\nfour corners of an agreement. See Ethyl Corp. v. Daniel Constr.

Stated generally, the\n\nexpress negligence doctrine provides that contracts will not be construed so as to\n\n\n\n                                            -20-\n\findemnify a person against his own negligence unless such intention is expressed in\n\nspecific terms.

Dresser Industries, Inc., 853 S.W.2d at 508. In the present\n\ncase, Hoang was not attempting to shift liability for her own negligence. She is not\n\nseeking indemnity for the consequences of her own negligence. No claims of\n\nnegligence were brought against Hoang by Appellees or any third parties. No third\n\nparties are seeking any claims against the Appellees that are attributable to the conduct\n\nof Hoang, nor is Hoang seeking to be indemnified for any such claims by any third\n\nparties. Further, Hoang is a third party beneficiary to the Acceptance Agreement.\n\nThere was no attempt to shift liability and there is no indemnification for “the\n\nconsequences” of a party’s own negligence.\n\n      Hoang is seeking recovery due to the conduct of the Appellees who signed the\n\nhold harmless agreement agreeing to indemnify Hoang. Hoang is not utilizing the\n\nhold harmless language to relieve herself from liability for her own negligence,\n\ninstead she is utilizing the agreement/release to impose liability upon the Appellees\n\nfor their own conduct and breach by their refusal to honor the hold harmless\n\nagreement.\n\n\n                                          -21-\n\f      2.

THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY REFUSING TO SUBMIT HOANG’S\n      QUESTION ON BREACH OF CONTRACT DAMAGES (Issue No. 2\n      Restated)\n\n             In the case at hand, Appellees agreed to release and hold Hoang harmless\n\nfrom any and all claims pertaining to the condition of the Property. A “release,” or\n\n“hold harmless agreement,” is a contractual agreement whereby one party assumes\n\nliability inherent in a situation thereby relieving the other party of responsibility.\n\nDresser Industries, Inc., 853 S.W.2d at 508 (Tex. 1993). Appellees do not dispute\n\nsigning the Acceptance Agreement.\n\n      Despite Appellees’ agreement to release and hold Hoang harmless and despite\n\naccepting responsibility for any liability pertaining to the condition of the property,\n\nAppellees nevertheless filed suit against Hoang seeking to impose the liability on\n\nHoang for the condition of the property. This was a clear breach of the terms and\n\nconditions of the Acceptance Agreement by the Appellees. As a direct result of\n\n\n\n\n                                         -23-\n\fAppellees bringing suit against Hoang, Hoang incurred damages in the form of\n\ndefense costs in having to defend against Appellees’ claims. RR Vol. 3 at 9-11.\n\n      Hoang properly brought and was allowed to bring a claim for breach of contract\n\nby the Appellees for violating the terms and conditions of the Acceptance Agreement.\n\nCR 156-165. Hoang provided evidence at trial on the fees incurred in having to\n\ndefend against the suit as a result of Appellees’ violation and breach and was cross\n\nexamined on the fees incurred. At the charge conference, Hoang submitted jury\n\nquestions on whether the Appellees violated the Acceptance Agreement and what sum\n\nof damages would Hoang be owed as a result of their breach. CR 306-339. The Court\n\ninquired as to the whether the defense costs incurred by Hoang were the actual\n\ndamages she was seeking and Hoang concurred that her damages were her costs of\n\ndefense. Vol 3 at 53, Vol. 4 at 15-16. The Trial Court found the separate breach of\n\ncontract damage question to be duplicative of the attorney’s fees question which was\n\nincluded in the proposed charge. Therefore, the Trial Court concluded that the\n\nattorney’s fees question would provide for defenses costs as damages. RR Vol.. 3 at\n\n53, Vol 4 at 15-16. However, by accepting Appellees’ JNOV arguments and refusing\n\nto award Hoang damages in accordance with the Jury’s findings, the Trial Court is\n\nnow implying that the attorney’s fees question was not sufficient, and that there\n\nshould have been a separate breach of contract damage question. Therefore, the Trial\n\n\n                                        -24-\n\fCourt erred in improperly removing and refusing to submit the actual breach of\n\ncontract damage question submitted by Hoang in her proposed charge and by failing\n\nto include said question in the final jury charge despite Hoang’s requests to do so.\n\nA.    Hoang Properly Submitted Her Breach of Contract Damage Question and\n      the Court’s Refusal To Submit It to the Jury was Error\n\n      A party is entitled to attorney’s fees if it prevails on a cause of action for which\n\nattorney’s fees are recoverable. State Farm Life Ins. Co., v. Beaston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1742706\"><a href=\"/opinion/1742706/state-farm-life-ins-co-v-beaston/\"><span class=\"volume\">907</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n437 (Tex. 1995). Hoang properly submitted a breach of contract claim for which\n\nattorney’s fees were recoverable. Hoang properly submitted a breach of contract\n\ndamage question and an attorney’s fees question as part of her breach of contract\n\nclaim. The Court erred in failing to include the damages question, despite including\n\nthe attorney’s fees question which awarded the same damages being sought by Hoang\n\nfor her actual damages.\n\n       It is undisputed that the jury made a finding that the Appellees violated the\n\nAcceptance Agreement thereby entitling Hoang to damages and attorney’s fees.\n\nAppellees’ counsel cross examined Hoang and her attorney with respect to the defense\n\ncosts incurred and the jury properly awarded a value based on the evidence presented.\n\nRR Vol. 13 at 9-11. The court erred in failing to include the breach of contract\n\ndamage question and has committed further error by failing to accept the findings by\n\nthe jury.\n\n                                          -25-\n\f      Appellees raised the argument that the award of attorney’s fees to Hoang was\n\nimproper because there was no separate findings of actual damages other than\n\nattorney’s fees awarded to Hoang. However, Hoang did submit a jury question on\n\nbreach of contract damages and the Court refused the submission, stating since the\n\nonly damages that Hoang incurred were the costs of defense, i.e. her attorney’s fees;\n\ntherefore, a separate breach of contract damage question was not necessary. RR Vol.\n\n3 at 53, Vol. 4 at 15-16. If such refusal, as shown below, is not a deemed finding, it\n\nwould be reversible error. By requesting the question and the Court refusing it on the\n\nrecord, Hoang preserved the error. See Dallas Mkt Ctr. Dev.

In Liedeker,\n\nthe record reflected that the appellant submitted written requests to the trial judge, the\n\njudge said he would sign them later, and through inadvertence the judge never signed\n\nthem. The Supreme court held that the trial court's “statements on the record clearly\n\npreserved [appellant]'s complaint.” Liedeker, 58 S.W.2d at 387.\n\n      Similarly, in the present case, Hoang court specifically asked for her actual\n\nbreach of contract damage question. CR 318-319, 330-331 The Court refused the\n\nsubmission stating that since the only damages that Hoang was seeking was her\n\nattorney’s fees, such question was not necessary. RR Vol. 3 at 53, Vol. 4 at 15-16.\n\nThe Court did not submit the question, and inadvertently forgot to sign the question\n\npresented to it by Hoang’s counsel. Therefore, Hoang’s question on damages was\n\npreserved.\n\nB.    Hoang’s Attorney’s Fees as Damages is a Deemed Finding\n\n      Since Hoang did submit a separate question as to breach of contract damages\n\nto the Trial Court, and the Trial Court refused the submission of such question, and\n\nAppellees never objected to the submission of the attorney’s fees and the breach of\n\ncontract/release questions, the issue that attorney’s fees are damages is a “deemed\n\nfinding. This Court can enter a finding as such.\n\n\n                                           -27-\n\f      Tex. R. Civ. P. 279 provides that when a ground of recovery or defense consists\n\nof more than one element, if one or more of such elements necessary to sustain such\n\nground of recovery or defense, and necessarily referable thereto, are submitted to and\n\nfound by the jury, and one or more of such elements are omitted from the charge,\n\nwithout request or objection, and there is factually sufficient evidence to support a\n\nfinding thereon, the trial court, at any time before the judgment is rendered, can make\n\nand file written findings on such omitted element or elements in support of the\n\njudgment. If no such written findings are made, such omitted element or elements\n\nshall be deemed found by the court in such manner as to support the judgment. Tex.\n\nR. Civ. P. 279.\n\n      It is undisputed that the jury awarded Hoang her reasonable and necessary\n\nattorneys’s fees in the sum of $230,000.00. CR 422. The Trial Court could have made\n\na written finding that such attorney’s fees constituted Hoang’s damages.

The first two limitations, reasonable\n\nand necessary are fact issues which should be decided by the trier of the fact and the\n\nsecond two limitations, fair and equitable are legal issues that are matters of law to\n\nbe decided by the Court.

The Declaratory Judgment\n\naction was not filed solely as a means to recover attorney’s fees as Appellees argue.\n\nOnly when a party brings a declaratory judgment action by way of a counterclaim or\n\namended petition and the declaratory judgment involves only issues already raised by\n\nthe original claim, does Appellees’ argument prevail.

App.—Houston\n\n[1st Dist.] 1991, writ denied).\n\n       The Trial Court abused his discretion because under the circumstances and facts\n\nof this case, awarding Hoang her attorney’s fees in this case is equitable and just. The\n\ntestimony solicited by the Appellees’ counsel was that Hoang’s attorney’s fees were\n\nequal or close to what he was asking the jury to award him in his case in chief.1\n\nThere was no great disparity in the amounts being sought by Hoang. The jury found\n\n\n       1\n        The jury awarded Appellees’ attorney $205,000 for attorney’s fees and appellate\nattorney’s fees of $41,000 and $25,000 making a total award to Appellees’ attorney of $271,000.\nC$R 407-427.\n\n                                             -34-\n\fthe fees to be reasonable and necessary. As shown below, Hoang only incurred the\n\nfees because, despite having little or no evidence against Hoang, Appellees persisted\n\nin bringing claims against Hoang all the way through trial, despite executing the hold\n\nharmless agreement. Appellees initiated the lawsuit against Hoang based upon alleged\n\nclaims of fraud and statutory fraud which were basically frivolous.         Appellees,\n\nthroughout the trial, presented no evidence to support their allegations. This was\n\nconfirmed by the jury findings.       Appellees admitted that there had been no\n\nrepresentations or misrepresentations to them by Hoang, having never spoken to her\n\nexcept to exchange pleasantries at closing. No independent evidence of any of\n\nAppellees’ allegations against Hoang existed, yet Appellees forced her to defend\n\nherself for the better part of three (3) years against their unfounded allegations.\n\n      Moreover, Appellees testified throughout the trial that they brought suit against\n\nat least two other parties, Grace Inspection Homes, Inc. and Michael Nguyen, whom\n\nthey did not believe did anything wrong, but had insurance or were a source of funds\n\nfor the lawsuit. Appellees own attorney admitted in his closing arguments that the\n\njury should not hold his clients responsible for his advise to sue parties for the sole\n\npurpose that they had were sources of income, not because they were liable in any\n\nmanner. RR Vol. 3A 12.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -35-\n\f      Appellees although they do not willingly admit it, sued Hoang for exactly the\n\nsame reason. Appellees sued Hoang in hopes of getting a judgment that they could\n\nthen take against the Texas Real Estate Trust fund, not because they really believed\n\nthat she misled them or had knowledge of any of the water damage. Appellees did not\n\nhave any knowledge of anything that Hoang knew until several months into the case\n\nwhen she unequivocally testified that she had no knowledge of any of the alleged\n\nwater damage that had occurred when the Seller owned the house. Hoang consistently\n\ntook the position that she had no knowledge of any water damage and the jury founder\n\nher to be credible. RR Vol. 2 at 20-21, 30, 37-39.          Appellees and Appellees’\n\ncounsel’s conduct of suing innocent people just to fund their lawsuit justifies the\n\naward of attorney’s fees under the equitable and just standard. See RR Vol.3A 12.\n\nDespite having executed and willingly entered into the Acceptance Agreement at\n\nclosing which contained the release and hold harmless agreement, Appellees persisted\n\nin bringing claims against Hoang.          Appellant’s actions cost Hoang at least\n\n$230,000.00 in legal fees as the cost of defense. RR Vol. 15, Ex. 16.\n\n      Further, an award of damages against the Appellees will not impose the same\n\ntype of financial burden on them or give rise to the same equities as it would in a\n\ntypical case involving a single losing plaintiff and single prevailing defendant. In this\n\ncase, despite losing on all jury questions involving Hoang, Appellees obtained a\n\n\n                                          -36-\n\fjudgment in excess of $1,200,000, against Chau, the Seller of the subject property.\n\nHaving prevailed against Chau, the practical net effect of entering judgment in favor\n\nof Appellee for her attorney's fees would merely reduce Appellees’ collection rights\n\nfrom approximately $1,200,000 to approximately $1,000,000, after netting out\n\nHoang’s attorney's fees of $230,000. On the other hand, failing to award Hoang her\n\nattorney's fees leaves her with an attorney's fees obligation of $230,000, despite\n\nfavorable jury findings on all causes of action and despite having committed no\n\nwrongdoing and having been released and indemnified by Appellees. Finally, the $1.2\n\nmillion plus judgment arose from the purchase of a home by Appellees from\n\ndefendant Chau for approximately $145,000. CR 31. Appellees' judgment against\n\nChau included additional damages under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act\n\nwhich constitute a windfall to Appellees. Awarding Hoang’s out of pocket attorney's\n\nfees against a windfall judgment in favor of Appellees is the only fair and equitable\n\nresult.\n\n          The jury, as the trier of fact, did not find Hoang guilty of any wrong doing.\n\nMore importantly, the jury through their answer affirmed that Appellees not only\n\nagreed to hold Hoang harmless, but actually failed to do so. Awarding Hoang her\n\nattorney’s’ fees’, based on the jury's fact findings, is “equitable and just.” See AVCO\n\nCorp., Textron Lycoming Reciprocating Engine Div. of AVCO Corp. v.

The bailiff will\n                               give your notes to me promptly after collecting them from ycm. I will make sure your notes arc\n                               kept in a safe, secure location and not disclosed to anyone. After you complete your\n                               deliberations, the bailiff will collect your notes. When you are released from jury duty, the bailiff\n                               will promptly destroy your notes so that nobody can read what you wrote.\n\n                                      Here arc the instructions for answering the questions.\n\n                                       l.     Do not let bias, prejudice, or sympathy play any part in your decision.\n\n                                      2.      Base your answers only on the evidence admitted in court and on the law that is in\n                                      these instructions and questions. Do not consider or discuss any evidence that was not\n                                      admitted in the courtroom.\n                                      3..     You are to make up your own minds about the facts. Yoti arc the sole judges of\n                                      the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to give their testimony. But on matters of\n                                      law, you must follow all of my instructions.\n\n\n                                                                                                                             407\n\f,.\n             4.      If my instructions use a word in a way that is different from its ordinary meaning,\n             use the meaning I give you, which will be a proper legal definition.\n\n            5.     All the questions and answers are important. No one should say that any question\n            or answer is not important.\n\n            6.      Answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" to all .questions unless you are told otherwise. A \"Yes\"\n            answer must be based on a preponderance of the evidence. Whenever a question requires\n            an answer other than \"Yes\" or \"No,\" your answer m11st be based on a preponderance ol9(\"\".\n            the evidenc7 u\"'-i....- ().) ~ ,.~i.u_ 1,._,,..fn,,o&,...                           ~\n                                     1\n            The term \"preponderance of the evidence\" means the greater weight of credible\n     evidence presented in this case. If you do not find that a preponderance of the evidence supports\n     a \"Yes\" answer, then answer ''No.\" A preponderance of the evidence is not measured by the\n     number of witnesses or by lhe number of documents admitted in evidence. For a fact to be\n     proved by a preponderance of the evidence, you must find th.e fact is more likely 1rue than not\n     true.\n\n             A fact may be establii;hed by direct evidence or by circumstantial evidence or both. A\n     tact is established by direct evidence when proved by documentary evidence or by witnesses\n     who saw the act done or heard the words spoken. A fact is established by circumstantial evidence\n     when it may be fairly and reasonably inferred from other facts proved.\n\n            7.      Do not decide who you think should win before you answer the questions and\n            then just answer the questions to match your decision. Answer eacl1 question carefully\n            wilhout considering who will win. Do not discuss or consider the effcet your answers will\n            have.\n\n            8.      Do not answer questions by drawing straws or by any method of chance,\n\n            9.     Some questions might ask you for a dollar amount. Do not agree in advance to\n            decide on a dollar amount by adding up each juror's amount and then figuring the\n            average.\n\n            I 0.   Do not trade your answers. For example, do not say: \"I will answer this question\n            your way if you answer another question my way.\"\n\n            11.     Unless otherwise instructed, the answers to the que.~tions must be based on the\n            decision of at least IO of the 12 jurors. The same IO jurors must agree on every answer.\n            Do not agree to be bound by a vote of anything less than l Ojurors, even if it would be a\n            majority.\n\n             lf you do not follow these instmctions, you will be guilty of juror misconduct, and I\n     m.ight have to order a new trial and start this process over again. This would waste your time and\n     the parties' money, and would require the taxpayers of this county to pay for another trial. If a\n     juror breaks any of these rules, tell that person to stop and repon it to me immediately.\n\n             Depending upon your answers to this Charge, there may be a need to take brief,\n     additional testimony and for you to deliberate upon additional questions after you have\n     completed your initial deliberalions.\n                                                2\n                                                                                                408\n\f                                           QUESTION NO. 1\n\n        Did any of the persons named below engage in any false, misleading, or deceptive act or\npractice that Trevor and Jorja Gilbert relied on to their detriment and that was a producing cause\nof damages to them?\n\n              \"Producing cause\" means a cause that was a substantial factor in\n              bringing about the damages, if any, and without which the damages would\n              not have occurred.

Plaintiffs sued Defendant Hoang for violations of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act, fraud,\n\n       slatutoty fraud, and civil conspiracy.\n\n2.     Defendant Hoang answered and raised defenses of failure to mitigate damages, assumption\n\n       of the risk, release and waiver, but also br0t1ght a counterclaim for breach of contract,\n\n       promissory estoppel at common law and sought declaratory relief. All these defenses and\n\n       the counterclaim were based upon one sentence in a document prepared by the title\n\n       company entitled \"Acceptance of Title and Closing Agreements.\" The sentence recited\n\n       hold harmless language, and although was signed by tl1e Gilberts and tl1e seller/defendants,\n\n       Ahn Van Dan and Hong Bich Chau (collectively \"Chau Defendants\") at the closing of the\n\n       real estate tl'ansaction, it was not signed or authorized by the third party realtors    01·   their\n\n      supervising broke!'s.\n\n                                            Page I of 11\n\n\n\n                                                                                                  434\n\f3.   On November 20, 2014. a jury awarded to the Gilberts what can only be deemed a large\n\n     verdict against the Chau Defendants for $1,384,000 for knowingly and intentionally\n\n     violating the DTPA, and for common law fraud, and statutory fraud. However, the jury did\n\n     not find the listing/selling realtor of the Chau Defendants (Hoang) liable under any of the\n\n     Gilberts' causes of action. The jury further answered \"Yes\" to whether the Gilberts failed to\n\n     comply with an agreement lo release and hold the realtors and their brokers, including\n\n     Defendant Hoang, hrumless. The jury also dete1mined that $230,000.00 was a reasonable\n\n     fee for necessary legal services ofHoang's attorney.\n\n4.   The Gilberts now move the Court for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict regarding the\n\n     recoverability of attorney's fees of the Hoang's lawyer, as there was never any claim for\n\n     recovery of (nor did she disclose or prove) any damages as a result of the Gilberts' alleged\n\n     breach of contract. Additionally, there was no evidence of consideration to the Gilberts for\n\n     their promise.   Further, Hoang's Counsel did not properly allocate her attorney's fees\n\n     between the time spent defending against the Gilberts' claims and that incurred for the\n\n     counterclaim. Finally, Hoang cannot use a declru:atory judgment solely as a vehicle to\n\n     recover attorney's foes.\n\n\n\n\n                                         Page2of 11\n\n\n\n                                                                                            435\n\f                                             II.\n      DEFENDANT HOANG DID NOT SEEK- NOR RECOVER-DAMAGES\n\n5.   To obtain an award of attorney's fees under Section 38.001 of the Civil Practice and\n\n     Remedies Code, a party must (1) prevail on a cause of action for which attorney's fees are\n\n     recoverable, and (2) recover damages.

Here, Defendant Hoang presented neither pleadings nor a shl'ed of evidencc upon which she\n\n     might have independently recovered actual damages as a result ol' any lrrcach of contract by\n\n     the Gilbe1ts.

Counter-Plaintiff has been damaged in an amount\n\n     of not less than $50,000.00.\" This is the only time Hoang ever mentioned any damages\n\n     suffered, and despite this, she proved-up no specific instance of ham1 caused by the\n\n     Plaintiffs' alleged breach, and she made no claim for actual damages whatsoever.\n\n7.   l11roughout the entire three year litigation Hoang foiled lo plead or prove any specific\n\n     damage she suffered as a result of the alleged breach of contract. Although she served six\n\n     (6) separate sets of disclosures, Hoang never set forth any damages she suffered or incun-ed\n\n\n                                          Page3of 11\n\n\n\n                                                                                           436\n\f      caused by or even due to Gilberts' alleged breach of contract, nor did she ever disclose any\n\n      specific monetmy value of such damages.

Additionally, throughout trial Hoang presented no testimonial or\n\n      documentary evidence of how, and by what amount, the alleged breach damaged her. Again,\n\n      the only evidence of a dollar amount of anything lhal was presented was of attorney's fees\n\n      allegedly incu!'red.\n\n8.    In Green Intern., Inc. v.

For the Defendant Hoang to recover attorney's fees, she must distinguish between the fees\n\n      incurred while defending against the Plaintiffs' claims of fraud and violations of the DTPA\n\n      from those incurred in pursuing her claim for breach of contract. Defendant Hoang did not\n\n      allocate or otherwise segregate her fees in this regard. The law requires her to introduce\n\n      evidence to show what portion of the attorney's fees was applicable to the counterclaim fol'\n\n      hreach of contract. Instead, she submitted to the jury, one lump sum, commingling all fees\n\n      incull'ed for the defense of the Gilberts' claims, and the breach of contract/counterclaim\n\n      cause or action. There was no evidence by which the jury could apportion the atto111ey's fees\n\n      between the defense and the prosecution of the countet•claim.\n\n18.

To state a claim\n\n      for affirmative relief, a defensive pleading must assert. a cause of action independent of the\n\n      claims already asserted by the plaintiff. i.e.. the defendant could recover benefits.\n\n      compensation. or relief. even if the plaintiff abandoned its cause of action. Id. For example,\n\n      in suits asse11ing breaches of contracts or deeds, where declaratory counterclaims seeking\n\n      construction of such instruments may constitute claims for affimmtive relief because, in\n\n      contrast to a \"one-time occurrence\" giving rise to the plaintiff's suit, they concern the\n\n      partjes' ongoing and future relationship. Id.\n\n21.   Hoang did not seek any affimiative relief for her claim of breach of contract for which she\n\n      basis her declaratory Judgment. She has not made a claim to recover benefits. nor does she\n\n      seek compensation or relief from the alleged breach. There is nothing in the language of this\n\n      clause that concerns any on-going relationship between the Plaintiffs and Hoang. In fact,\n\n      Hoang is not even a pm1y to the agreement in the first place. TI1is is boilerplate language\n\n      which does not specifically name the defendant.\n\n22.   In filing for a declaratory judgment on her breach of contract claim, the Defend.ant Hoang is\n\n      requesling just that: a declaration that the Plaintiffs btcachoo their contract.

In support of her motion for entry of judgment and\n\nin further response and opposition to Plaintiffs' JNOV, Hoang rnspectfully shows the court as\n\nfollows:\n\n                                         BACKGROUND\n\n        1.     Plaintiff brought claims against Hoang for violations under the Texas Deceptive\n\nTrade Practice Act., for fraud, statutory fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud.\n\n       2.      Hoang brought counter-claims against Plaintiffs for damages and attorney fees under\n\nthe Texas Declaratory Judgment Act and for breach of contract based upon the hold harmless\n\nagreement in the Acceptance of Title and Closing Agreements (the \"Acceptance Agreement\"). The\n\nAcceptance Agreement was signed by Plaintiffs specifically to hold Defendants harmless from the\n\nexact type offrivilous claims that were alleged against Hoang by Plaintiffs.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                     484\n\f       3.      After 7 full days of trial, the case was submitted to the jury. The Court submitted\n\nHoang's questions as to whether Plaintiffs' breached the Acceptance Agreement.\n\n       4.      Hoang specifically requested a specific damage question, but the Court refused the\n\nsubmission stating that since the only damages were in the nature of attorneys fees, the question on\n\nHoang' s attorneys fees was sufficient.\n\n       5.      The jury subsequently rendered its verdict A tiue and correct copy of the Jury\n\nVerdict is attached hereto as Exhibit \"A\".\n\n       6.      The Jury specifically found that:\n\n               a.     Hoang did not engage in any false, misleading or deceptive act or practice\n                      that Plaintiffs relied upon to their detriment and that was a producing cause\n                      of damage to them; and\n\n               b.     Hoang did not engage in any unconscionable action or course of action that\n                      was a producing cause to Plaintiffs; and\n\n               c.     Hoang did not commit fraud against Plaintiffs; and\n\n               d.     Hoang did not commit statutory fraud against Plaintiff; and\n\n               e.     Hoang was not part of a conspiracy to commit fraud;\n\n       7.      The Jury specifically found tliat Plaintiff filed to comply with release and hold\n\nharmless agreement. This jury quesiion was predicated upon no findings on any type ofwrong-doing\n\nby Hoang. Since Hoang did not engage in any wrong doing and the jury expressly found such, the\n\nexpress negligence doctrine does not apply to the hold hamiless agreement.\n\n       8.      The jury also found that a reasonable fee necessary for the services of Hoang's\n\nattorneys was $230,000.00.\n\n       9.      On November 25, 2014 Plaintiffs filed the JNOV.\n\n        10.    Hoang filed her Judgment Motion on November 26, 2014.\n\n\n\n                                                   -2-\n\n\n\n                                                                                              485\n\f        11.     After an initial hearing on both Motions, this Court requested additional briefing: on\n\n1) what would constitute \"fair and equitable\" under the Texas Declaratory Judgment Act, 2) whether\n\nattorneys fees' can be damages for a breach of the hold hamiless agreement, and 3) whether the hold\n\nharmless agreement needed to be conspicuo11s.\n\n                                ARGUMENTS & AUTHORITIES\n\nI.

Awarding Hoang her attorneys foes in this case is equitable and just The testimony\n\nsolicited by the Plaintiffs' counsel was that Hoang's attorneys fees were equal or close to what he\n\nwas asking the jury to award him in his casein chief. 1 There was no great dispa!'ity in the amounts\n\nbeing sought by Hoang. The jury found the fees to be reasonable and necessary. As shown below,\n\nHoang only incurred the fees because, despite having little or no evidence against Hoang, Plaintiffs\n\nhad persisted in bringing the claims against her all the way through trial, despite executing the hold\n\nharmless agreement.\n\n        17.     Plaintiffs initiated the lawsuit against Hoang based upon frivilous claims of alleged\n\nfraud and statutory fraud. Plaintiffs, through trial, had essentially no evidence to support their\n\nallegations. This was confirmed by the ju1y findings. See Ex. A. The only evidence presented by\n\nP)aintiffs against Hoang was theinconsistenttestimony ofaco-defendantAndy Dang, whom the jury\n\nfound not credible. Plaintiffs admitted that there had been no representations or misrepresentations\n\nto them by Hoang, having never spoken to her except to exchange pleasantries at closing. No\n\n\n\n        'The jury awarded Plaintiff's attorney $205,000 for attorneys fees and appellate attorneys\nfees of $41,000 and $25,000 making a total award to Plaintiffs' attorney of$271,000. See Ex. A\n                                                  -4.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                 487\n\findependent evidence of any of Plaintiffsallegations against Hoang existed, yet Plaintiffs forced her\n\nto defend herself for the better pa11 of three (3) years against their unfounded allegations.\n\n       18.     Moreover, Plaintiffs testified throughout the trial that they brought suit against at\n\nleast two other parties, Grace Inspection Homes, Inc. and Michael Nguyen, whom they did not\n\nbelieve did anything wrong, but had insurance or were a source of funds for the lawsuit. Plaintiffs'\n\nown attorney admitted in his closing arguments that the jury should not hold his clients 1·esponsible\n\nfor his advise to sue parties for the sole purpose that they had were sources ofincome, not because\n\nthey were liable in any manner.\n        19.     Plaintiffs, although they do not willingly admit it, sued Hoang for exactly the same\n\nreason. Plaintiffs sued Hoang in hopes of getting a judgment that they could then take against the\n\nTexas Real Estate Tn1st fund, not because they really believed that she misled them or had\n\nknowledge of any of the water damage. Plaintiffs' did not have any knowledge of anythh1g that\n\nHoang knew until several months into the case when Dang testified inconsistently that he did or\n\ndidn't tell her about the water damage in his deposition. By this time, tliey had already sued Hoang.\n\nHoang consistently took the position that she had no knowledge. of any water damage and the Jury\n\nfounder her to be credible. Plaintiffs' and Plaintiffs' counsels' conduct of suing innocent people just\n\nto fund their lawsuit justifies the award of attorneys fees under the equitable and just standard.\n\n        20.     Further, despite having executed and willingly entered into the Acceptance\n\nAgreement at closing which contained the release and hold harmless agreement, Plaintiffs persisted\n\nin bringing claims against Hoang. Plaintiffs' actions cost .Hoang at least $210,000.00 in legal fees\n\nas the cost of defonse. 2\n\n\n\n        2lnfact, by bringing the JNOV, Plaintiffs are continuing to cost Hoang attorneys fees,\nAlthough the jury did not find any appellate fees, this Cou11 can. award the same under the same\nstandards as set forth in this brief. Hoang should be entitled to additional attorneys fees of not\n\n                                                  -5-\n\n\n\n                                                                                                 488\n\f       21.      The ju1y, as the trier of fact, did not find Hoang guilty of any wrong doing. More\n\nimportantly, the Jury through their answer afiirmed that Plaintiffs not only agreed to hold Hoang\n\nharmless, but actually failed to do so. Awarding Hoang her attorneys' fees', based on the jury's\n\nfact findings, is \"equitable and just.\" See AVCO C0171.. Textron Lycoming Reciprocali11g E'ngine\n\nDiv. ofAVCO Corp. v. lnwrstate Somlzwest, /,rd., 251 S.WJd 632, 670 (Tex,App.~Bouston [14\n\nDist.],2007).\n\n       B.       Hoang's Declaratory Judgment Action was P1·operly Pied\n\n       22.      In the present case, Hoang brought an action under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code\n\n§37.001 et seq., seeking a declaration that Plaintiffs released Hoang under the hold hannless\n\nagreement in the Acceptance Agreement. The Declaratory Judgment action was not filed solely as\n\na means to recover attorneys fees as Plaintiff argue. Only when a party brings a declaratory\n\njudgment action by way of a counterclaim or amended petition and the declaratory judgment\n\ninvolves only issues already raised by the original claim, does Plaintiffs' argument prevail.

Although the Court can award the attorneys fees under §37.009, and does not need\n\nto reach the question as to whether Hoang is entitled to the $230,000 as damages under her breach\n\nof contract action, this Court requested briefing on the issue.\n\n       A.      Damages in the Form of Attorneys Fees Are Proper under Hold Harmless\n               Agreements\n\n               1.      Hoang Can Recover Attorneys Fees as Damages\n\n       28.     Plaintiffs argue that Hoang catmotrecover attorneys fees as damages under §38.00 l.\n\nHowever, Hoang disagrees that the attorneys' fees cannot be damages and does not necessarily seek\n\nthem under §3 8.00 I. Hoang was seeking her damages for breach of a hold harm less agreement. As\n\nsuch, the only damages Hoang could have sustained was her cost of defending the lawsuit, i.e. her\n\nattorneys' fees which are recoverable 11nder Texas law.\n\n       29.

The Court refused the submission stating that since the only damages that Hoang were\n\nseeking were her attorneys fees, such question was not necessary. The Court did not submit the\n\nquestion, and inadvettently forgot to sign the question presented to it by Hoang's counsel.\n\nTherefore, Hoang's question on damages was preserved.\n\n                3..    lloang's Attorneys .Fees as Damages is a Deemed Finding\n\n          37.   Since Hoang did submit a separate question as to damages to this Court, and the\n\nCourt refused the submission of such question, and Plaintiff never objected to the submission of the\n\nattorneys' fees and the breach ofcontract/release questions, the issue that attorneys fees are damages\n\nis a \"deemed finding.
