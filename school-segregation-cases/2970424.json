OLSON, AND CAREY ROBERTS,\n                          Appellees\n\n\n\n                   On Appeal from the 295th District Court\n                            Harris County, Texas\n                      Trial Court Case No. 2010-11229\n\n\n                                 OPINION\n\n      Appellant, Sentinel Integrity Solutions, Inc. (“Sentinel”), sued appellees,\n\nMistras Group, Inc., Jody W. Olson, and Carey Roberts, for damages arising out of\n\nOlson’s alleged breach of a covenant not to compete in his employment agreement\n\fwith Sentinel and Mistras’s alleged tortious interference with the employment\n\nagreement. In bench conference before the submission of the charge to the jury,\n\nSentinel agreed with the defendants that the scope of the covenant not to compete\n\nwas overbroad as to its geographic limits. The trial court submitted eight questions\n\nto the jury on Sentinel’s claims against Mistras and Olson’s claims for attorney’s\n\nfees. The jury charge did not address the enforceability of the covenant not to\n\ncompete or Olson’s alleged breach, and Sentinel did not object to the charge. The\n\njury returned a verdict finding no liability on the part of any of the defendants.\n\nAfter the jury reached its verdict, the court reformed the covenant not to compete\n\nat Sentinel’s request. The trial court then entered judgment that Sentinel take\n\nnothing on its claims and that it pay Olson’s attorney’s fees pursuant to Texas\n\nBusiness and Commerce Code section 15.51.\n\n      In seven issues, Sentinel argues that: (1) “the covenant not to compete [was]\n\nenforceable as a matter of law,” that “even if the contract was ‘at will,’ the\n\ncovenant was enforceable,” that the trial court had a mandatory duty under section\n\n15.51(c) to reform the covenant not to compete to cause its limitations “to be\n\nreasonable and to impose a restraint that is not greater than necessary” and “to\n\nEnforce the covenant as reformed,” and that “[t]he trial court erred in determining\n\nthe covenant was unenforceable and ordering the parties to a jury trial” and “in\n\nplacing the issue of attorneys’ fees before the jury”; (2) the evidence was\n\n                                         2\n\finsufficient to support the jury’s finding, pursuant to section 15.51, that Sentinel\n\nknew at the time of execution of the employment agreement that the covenant did\n\nnot contain reasonable limitations and that it sought to enforce the limitations to a\n\ngreater extent than was necessary to protect its business interests; (3) the attorney’s\n\nfees awarded were not “actually incurred” by Olson; (4) the attorney’s fees were\n\nnot properly segregated; (5) the conditional appellate attorney’s fees were not\n\nactually and reasonably incurred; (6) the trial court’s award of $750,000 in\n\nattorney’s fees for trial expenses and $200,000 in conditional appellate fees should\n\nbe reversed and rendered or reformed; and (7) the trial court erred in granting pre-\n\njudgment interest on attorney’s fees.\n\n      We remand the award of appellate attorney’s fees. We further modify the\n\njudgment to delete the award of pre-judgment interest and affirm as modified.\n\n                                    Background\n\n      Olson works as an inspector of oil and gas refinery equipment. He obtained\n\ncertification from the American Petroleum Institute in 2002 and worked for a\n\nvariety of companies supervising “turnarounds,” or inspections that are conducted\n\nunder time-sensitive conditions while the facility is shut down. In February 2008,\n\nOlson began working for Sentinel, a Houston-based inspection company, as a\n\nturnaround supervisor. In January 2009, Sentinel promoted Olson to the position\n\nof assistant division manager of the Corpus Christi office.\n\n\n                                          3\n\f      On August 1, 2009, Sentinel’s general manager, Scott Corey, presented\n\nOlson with an employment agreement. The agreement provided the effective date\n\nfor Olson’s promotion to assistant division manager and stated the covered duties\n\nand managerial responsibilities covered by the agreement.         The employment\n\nagreement also contained a covenant not to compete, which provided, inter alia,\n\nthat Sentinel “has and will disclose” confidential information regarding customers,\n\ncustomer representatives, employees, and specialized training. The covenant not to\n\ncompete required that Olson “refrain from competing with the Company or\n\notherwise engaging in ‘Restricted Activities’ (as defined below), for a reasonable\n\nperiod of time” in order to protect the confidential information. The covenant\n\ndefined the “Restricted Period” as “a period of three (3) years after the Termination\n\nDate [during which Olson] will not, directly or indirectly, as an employee, officer,\n\ndirector, shareholder, proprietor, agent, partner, recruiter, consultant, salesman,\n\nindependent contractor or in any other individual or representative capacity engage\n\nin any of the Restricted Activities.”     The covenant also provided that, upon\n\ntermination without cause, or in other circumstances within Sentinel’s discretion, it\n\nwould pay Olson four weeks’ salary.\n\n      The covenant not to compete defined “Restricted Activities” as including:\n\n      (i)    Conducting, engaging or participating in . . . Inspection, Risk\n             Based Inspection and Asset Integrity Management services in\n             any capacity in which Employee served while working with\n             Company, if such activity is on behalf of a customer that\n                                         4\n\f              Employee called upon or serviced while employed by\n              Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term “Restricted\n              Activities” as defined herein shall apply only if Employee\n              voluntarily terminates his employment with Employer, or if\n              Employer terminates Employee’s employment with Employer\n              for cause as defined in this Agreement[;]\n\n      (ii)    Recruiting, hiring, and/or attempting to recruit or hire . . . any\n              employees . . . of the Company; or contacting or\n              communicating with any other employees of the Company or\n              any of its Customers for the purpose or with the intent of\n              inducing such other employees to terminate their employment\n              with the Company or a Customer. . . ;\n\n      (iii)   Communicating, by any means, . . . with any Customer or\n              Customer Representative, to or for which the Company has\n              provided services at any time during Employee’s employment\n              by Company;\n\n      (iv)    Communicating, by any means . . . with an employee of the\n              Company after the Termination Date, provided, however, that\n              the foregoing shall not be deemed to preclude any casual\n              contacts which are strictly social . . . ;\n\n      (v)     Using, disclosing, publishing, copying, distributing           or\n              communicating any Company Information of any nature;\n\n      (vi)    Using, disclosing, publishing, copying, distributing or\n              communicating any Confidential Information of any nature.\n\n      The covenant not to compete defined the “Restricted Area” as including\n\nseven cities and four counties in Texas, plus locations in California, Utah,\n\nLouisiana, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Wyoming, and Trinidad and Tobago. The\n\nRestricted Area also included “a twenty (20) mile radius around all customers’\n\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\fjobsites and/or project facilities that Employee called on or serviced on behalf of\n\nEmployer in all geographic regions, wherever located.”\n\n      The covenant not to compete also provided:\n\n      Employee and Company agree that the limitations as to time and\n      scope of activity to be restrained are reasonable and do not impose a\n      greater restraint on Employee than is necessary to protect the property\n      rights and other business interests of Company. Notwithstanding the\n      foregoing, Employee reserves the right to seek reformation of the\n      limitations as to the time and scope of activity in a court of competent\n      jurisdiction, in accordance with Section 9, paragraph (a) hereunder.\n\nThe modification provision in Section 9, paragraph (a) provided in relevant part:\n\n      If any part of this Agreement is adjudged by a court of competent\n      jurisdiction to exceed the applicable legal limitation, then such\n      provisions shall be reformed to the maximum time, geographic or\n      other limitations permitted by applicable law, it being the parties’\n      intention to permit the reviewing court to modify this Agreement to\n      the extent necessary to cure any such invalidity or unenforceability.\n\n      Olson signed the employment agreement on August 7, 2009. After several\n\nmonths of employment as an assistant manager, Olson determined that the\n\ndemanding managerial position was a strain on his family and contacted appellee\n\nCarey Roberts, a man Olson had met while working for a previous employer.\n\nRoberts worked for Mistras, a company that specialized in non-destructive testing.\n\nIn the fall of 2009, Mistras offered Olson a job as a turnaround inspector—the type\n\nof job he had previously had at Sentinel before his promotion to assistant manager\n\nand the execution of the employment agreement. Olson remained at Sentinel as an\n\n\n\n                                         6\n\fassistant manager until he gave his notice of termination in December 2009, and he\n\nbegan working for Mistras as a turnaround supervisor in January 2010.\n\n      On February 23, 2010, Sentinel filed its original petition and request for\n\ninjunctive relief, alleging that the covenant not to compete was enforceable against\n\nOlson under section 15.50(a) of the Texas Business and Commerce Code, 1 which\n\nrequires that, in addition to being part of otherwise enforceable agreement, a\n\ncovenant not to compete must contain reasonable limitations as to time,\n\ngeographical area, and scope of activity to be restrained in order to be enforceable;\n\nthat Olson breached the covenant not to compete; and that Mistras and Roberts\n\ntortiously interfered with the contract between Olson and Sentinel by hiring\n\nOlson.2 Sentinel’s petition sought damages and attorney’s fees, and it included a\n\ndemand for a jury trial. It also sought injunctive relief in the form of a request for\n\na temporary restraining order and a temporary injunction. Sentinel also pled, “In\n\nthe alternative, if the Court should find that the covenant not to compete is not\n\nreasonably limited as to time, geographical area, or scope of activity, the Court\n\n\n\n\n1\n      See TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. § 15.50(a) (Vernon 2011).\n2\n      Sentinel also originally alleged that Olson breached a confidentiality agreement,\n      breached a fiduciary duty owed to Sentinel, misappropriated Sentinel’s trade\n      secrets, including theft of software productivity tools, and committed computer\n      fraud and abuse.\n\n                                          7\n\fshould reform the covenant as provided by Texas Business & Commerce Code\n\n§ 15.51(c).”\n\n      The trial court conducted a hearing in May 2010, and, on July 12, 2010, it\n\ndenied Sentinel’s application for a temporary injunction and granted summary\n\njudgment dismissing Sentinel’s claims for “theft/misappropriation of trade secrets\n\nunder the Theft Liability Act, theft of trade secrets, computer fraud abuse, civil\n                                              3\nconspiracy, and breach of fiduciary duty.”        Sentinel appealed the denial of its\n\napplication for a temporary injunction to this Court, but it eventually moved to\n\ndismiss the appeal after the record and briefing were filed.4 This Court issued a\n\nmemorandum opinion granting Sentinel’s motion to dismiss on January 18, 2011.\n\n      The case was tried to a jury from September 27 through October 14, 2011.\n\nOlson presented evidence that, prior to signing the employment agreement in\n\nAugust 2009, he questioned Corey about the terms of the non-compete clause in an\n\ne-mail exchange. Olson stated:\n\n      I have read the contract and I am happy with the terms and conditions\n      and ready to sign it and send it back. However the three year no\n      compete with two weeks of compensation seem[s] inadequate. . . .\n\n\n3\n      The trial court also issued numerous other orders, including an order granting in\n      part Sentinel’s motion to compel arbitration, an order granting Sentinel’s\n      subsequent motion to vacate the order compelling arbitration, and an order\n      granting Olson’s motion for partial summary judgment.\n4\n      The interlocutory appeal resulted in cause number 01-10-00607-CV.\n\n                                          8\n\f      Three years seem[s] a long time with two weeks of compensation. I\n      think six months would be fair for a three year no compete.\n\nCorey responded:\n\n      The no compete does not prevent you from working TA’s, etc., or\n      from being employable within the inspection industry. So if you were\n      fired, laid-off, etc. tomorrow, you would simply pick up the phone\n      and call one of your many choices to go to work as an inspector.\n      During the agreement period (3 years) it provides 4 weeks of\n      compensation, not 2 as stated in your emails. . . . 4 weeks of\n      compensation is plenty considering that no one else in our industry\n      would even consider this. The 2 weeks you are referring to is for the\n      period of time following the expiration of the 3 year agreement, if that\n      were to even happen.\n\n      Olson also testified regarding the nature of his work for Mistras.         He\n\ntestified that he worked as a turnaround supervisor, doing inspections just as he\n\nhad done prior to his promotion at Sentinel. He testified that he occasionally\n\ncontacted people on Mistras’s list of independent contractors to see who was\n\navailable to work on upcoming turnarounds, but he got those names from Mistras,\n\nand the contractors were not employees of Sentinel. He did not have the authority\n\nto hire them or determine their pay. He did not perform any managerial duties for\n\nMistras.\n\n      Corey testified at trial that Sentinel wanted to enforce the covenant not to\n\ncompete as written in the employment agreement. He stated that he believed\n\nOlson was prevented from performing for a competitor any duties encompassed by\n\nthe role of a manager for Sentinel: “If he became a manager for us, and also that\n\n\n                                         9\n\fincluded sweeping the floors at Sentinel, that means that he can’t go to [Mistras]\n\nand sweep the floors, in my opinion. ‘In any capacity,’ is what it says. Now,\n\ninspector, manager, supervisor, dishwasher, it doesn’t matter.”\n\n      Regarding the geographic area covered by the non-compete, Corey testified\n\nthat “[w]hen we wrote this geographic area that’s covered [in the covenant not to\n\ncompete], there’s no possible way we could have a crystal ball to know what Mr.\n\nOlson, or any other manager, what projects or what areas they may be working in\n\ntomorrow, next week, or next year.” He explained that they solved this problem by\n\nincluding broad provisions: “So we do the best job we can to list the specifics that\n\nwe know about at the time a contract is put in place to cover pretty much all the\n\ngeneral areas that we think or anticipate would be covered. And if there’s other\n\nareas that are added, then they would be covered; and that’s why we have\n\nprovisions that allow the court to modify it.”\n\n      John Zavitsanos, attorney for Olson, Mistras, and Roberts, testified\n\nregarding Olson’s reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees.\n\n      Before submitting the case to the jury, Sentinel’s counsel stated, on the\n\nrecord but outside the presence of the jury, “We agree that the geographical\n\nrestrictions are overbroad. We do not agree that the rest of the noncompete or the\n\nagreement to which it is—otherwise enforceable agreement to which it is ancillary\n\nor part of is unenforceable as written.” Counsel for Sentinel also agreed that the\n\n                                         10\n\f“provision regarding the geographical scope” of the non-compete agreement\n\nneeded to be reformed. 5 Sentinel maintained, however, that it had a valid tortious\n\ninterference claim against Mistras “for interfering with the remainder of Mr.\n\nOlson’s employment agreement.”\n\n      At the formal charge conference, the trial court presented a jury charge that\n\nasked: whether Sentinel provided Olson a definite term of employment, specialized\n\ntraining, or confidential information in connection with the non-competition\n\nagreement (Question 1); whether Mistras intentionally interfered with the\n\nemployment agreement between Olson and Sentinel and, if so, whether Sentinel\n\nsuffered any damages as a result (Questions 2 through 6); whether Olson had made\n\nthe factual showing necessary to obtain attorney’s fees under section 15.51(c)\n\n(Question 7); and the amount of Olson’s reasonable attorney’s fees for defending\n\nagainst Sentinel’s claim that he breached the covenant not to compete (Question 8).\n\nSentinel did not object in any way to the jury charge. 6\n\n      In its verdict, returned on October 14, 2011, the jury found no liability on the\n\npart of any of the defendants to Sentinel. It found that Sentinel had provided Olson\n\n\n5\n      Sentinel states in its brief that it made a request for reformation “in open court.”\n      The agreement that the geographical area covered by the covenant would need to\n      be reformed is the only discussion of potential reformation recorded in the record.\n6\n      The record does not contain any indication of the changes, if any, that were made\n      to the jury charge based on Sentinel’s concession that the geographical scope of\n      the covenant not to compete was overbroad and needed to be reformed.\n                                           11\n\fwith confidential information in connection with the non-competition agreement,\n\nbut it had not provided a definite term of employment or specialized training; that\n\nMistras did not intentionally interfere with the employment agreement between\n\nOlson and Sentinel; that Sentinel knew at the time the employment agreement was\n\nsigned that the covenant not to compete contained limitations as to time,\n\ngeographical area, or scope of activity to be restrained that were not reasonable and\n\nthat it sought to enforce the limitations to a greater extent than necessary to protect\n\nits business interest; and that “a reasonable fee for the necessary services of Jody\n\nOlson’s attorneys in this case in defending the claim that Jody Olson breached the\n\nnon-competition agreement in this case” was $750,000 for preparation and trial,\n\n$150,000 for an appeal to the court of appeals, and $50,000 for an appeal to the\n\nTexas Supreme Court.\n\n      On October 17, 2011, Sentinel filed an application for reformation of the\n\ncovenant not to compete and permanent injunction, which it subsequently amended\n\non October 31, 2011.       Sentinel asked the trial court to restrict Olson from\n\ncompeting within a 100-mile radius of its Corpus Christi office, the area in which\n\nOlson had worked for Sentinel, and from working or performing services for any\n\nSentinel clients for whom Olson “worked or [whom he] called on, regardless of\n\nlocation.” It also sought reformation of the scope of activities, asking that Olson\n\nbe restricted from acting as a manager in the inspection business, as a turnaround\n\n                                          12\n\fsupervisor, or as a supervisor. On October 21, 2011, Sentinel moved to withdraw\n\nthe case from the jury, asking the trial court to render judgment, and on October\n\n24, 2011, Sentinel filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, arguing\n\nthat the evidence was legally insufficient on the attorney’s fees issue.\n\n      The trial court reformed the non-compete agreement, but it did not order a\n\npermanent injunction. It also entered final judgment awarding Olson attorney’s\n\nfees in the amount of $750,000 for fees incurred during litigation in the trial court\n\nand $200,000 in conditional appellate attorney’s fees, and it awarded Olson,\n\nMistras, and Roberts court costs as prevailing parties. The final judgment also\n\nincluded an award of pre-judgment interest on the amount of attorney’s fees\n\nincurred by Olson that had already been paid.\n\n                             Covenant Not to Compete\n\n      In part of its first issue, Sentinel argues that the trial court erred in failing to\n\ndetermine enforceability as a matter of law and that the covenant not to compete\n\nbetween it and Olson was enforceable as a matter of law. It argues, “Because the\n\ncovenant is enforceable, the trial court should have reformed it and abused its\n\ndiscretion in failing to do so.”\n\nA.    Enforceability of the Covenant Not to Compete\n\n      Olson argues that Sentinel waived its complaints that the trial court erred in\n\nfailing to determine enforceability as a matter of law and that the covenant not to\n\n\n                                           13\n\fcompete was enforceable as a matter of law. We agree. Rather than seeking a\n\nruling from the trial court that the covenant not to compete was enforceable,\n\nSentinel requested a jury trial seeking damages against Olson and Mistras.\n\nSentinel then conceded on the last day of trial that the covenant was overbroad and,\n\ntherefore, not enforceable as written. Sentinel’s counsel agreed on the record that,\n\nat least as to geographical area, the covenant not to compete was overbroad, and it\n\nspecifically informed the trial court that it believed that the geographical area\n\ncovered by the covenant required reformation. See TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN.\n\n§ 15.50(a) (Vernon 2011) (requiring that, in addition to being part of otherwise\n\nenforceable agreement, covenant not to compete must contain reasonable\n\nlimitations as to time, geographical area, and scope of activity to be restrained in\n\norder to be enforceable); see also Marsh USA Inc. v. Cook, 354 S.W.3d 764, 777\n\n(Tex. 2011) (holding that “[t]he hallmark of enforcement is whether or not the\n\ncovenant is reasonable” and stating that “the statute’s core inquiry is whether the\n\ncovenant” contains reasonable limitations).       Sentinel cannot now complain on\n\nappeal that it got what it asked for. See Tittizer v. Union Gas Corp., 171 S.W.3d\n\n857, 862 (Tex. 2005) (“[A] party cannot complain on appeal that the trial court\n\ntook a specific action that the complaining party requested, a doctrine commonly\n\nreferred to as ‘the invited error’ doctrine.”).\n\n\n\n\n                                           14\n\f      Furthermore, Sentinel did not object to the submission of Question 1, asking\n\nthe jury whether Sentinel provided additional consideration in connection with the\n\nnon-competition agreement. See Cruz v. Andrews Restoration, Inc., 364 S.W.3d\n\n817, 829 (Tex. 2012) (complaint to jury charge is waived unless specifically\n\nincluded in objection); Mo. Pac. R.R. Co. v. Cross, 501 S.W.2d 868, 873 (Tex.\n\n1973) (holding that failure to object before charge is read to jury waives\n\ncomplaint). Nor did Sentinel present the trial court with a request for a legal ruling\n\non this issue prior to the submission of the charge to the jury. See TEX. R. APP. P .\n\n33.1 (providing that complaint by timely request, objection, or motion in trial court\n\nis required to preserve issue for consideration on appeal).\n\n      Thus, Sentinel has waived, for purposes of appeal, any argument that the\n\ntrial court was obligated to make a legal ruling on the enforceability of the\n\ncovenant not to compete.\n\n\nB.    Reformation of the Covenant Not to Compete\n\n      Sentinel also argues that the trial court had a duty to reform the covenant not\n\nto compete under Business and Commerce Code section 15.51. 7 Because the trial\n\ncourt did reform the covenant, at Sentinel’s request, and Sentinel does not\n\n7\n      In part of its second issue, Sentinel argues, “Then, there is the matter of the trial\n      court’s failure or refusal to act upon Sentinel’s continued requests for\n      reformation.” Sentinel does not support its assertion that it made repeated requests\n      for reformation with citations to the record, nor does our review of the record\n      reveal any request for reformation other than the motion for reformation Sentinel\n      filed after the jury returned its verdict.\n                                           15\n\fchallenge the reformed covenant on appeal, we construe this as an argument that\n\nthe trial court erred in failing to reform the covenant not to compete until after the\n\ncase had been submitted to the jury.\n\n      The Covenants Not to Compete Act provides procedures and remedies in\n\nactions to enforce covenants not to compete. It provides:\n\n      If the covenant is found to be ancillary to or part of an otherwise\n      enforceable agreement but contains limitations as to time,\n      geographical area, or scope of activity to be restrained that are not\n      reasonable and impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect\n      the goodwill or other business interest of the promisee, the court shall\n      reform the covenant to the extent necessary to cause the limitations\n      contained in the covenant as to time, geographical area, and scope of\n      activity to be restrained to be reasonable and to impose a restraint that\n      is not greater than necessary to protect the goodwill or other business\n      interest of the promisee and enforce the covenant as reformed . . . .\n\nTEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. § 15.51(c) (Vernon 2011). Reformation pursuant to\n\nsection 15.51 is a remedy to be granted at a final hearing, whether on the merits or\n\nby summary judgment, not as interim relief. Gray Wireline Serv., Inc. v. Cavanna,\n\n374 S.W.3d 464, 470 (Tex. App.—Waco 2011, no pet.); Cardinal Health Staffing\n\nNetwork, Inc. v. Bowen, 106 S.W.3d 230, 238–39 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n\n2003, no pet.).\n\n      The record reflects that, other than a one sentence pleading in the alternative\n\nin its original petition, Sentinel maintained throughout the course of the litigation\n\nthat the covenant not to compete was enforceable as written. It did not abandon\n\nthis argument until almost the end of trial, when it conceded that, at least as to the\n                                         16\n\fgeographical area, the covenant did not contain reasonable restrictions and needed\n\nto be reformed. It did not affirmatively ask the trial court to reform the agreement\n\nuntil after jury had returned its verdict, but, once Sentinel requested reformation,\n\nthe trial court reformed the agreement. Because Sentinel never sought a final\n\nhearing on this issue before the jury trial took place, and because it would have\n\nbeen inappropriate for the trial court to reform the covenant without holding a final\n\nhearing, we conclude that Sentinel has failed to show error on the part of the trial\n\ncourt.\n\n         Moreover, Sentinel has made no showing or argument that, had it timely\n\nsought reformation, rather than seeking it after rendition of the jury’s verdict on the\n\ncharge to which it agreed, the jury’s findings on liability would have been\n\ndifferent. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i) (requiring appellant’s brief to “contain a clear\n\nand concise argument for the contentions made, with appropriate citations to\n\nauthorities and to the record”).\n\n         We overrule Sentinel’s first issue as it relates to the enforceability of the\n\ncovenant not to compete.\n\n                                    Attorney’s Fees\n\n         In its remaining issues, Sentinel complains of the award of attorney’s fees to\n\nOlson under Business and Commerce Code section 15.51(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                           17\n\fA.    Facts Relating to Attorney’s Fees\n\n      John Zavitsanos, attorney for Olson, testified regarding the attorney’s fees\n\nincurred in this case. He stated that Olson incurred attorney’s fees and that Mistras\n\nadvanced Olson’s fees pursuant to an agreement between them. Sentinel did not\n\nobject to this testimony. However, in its motion for judgment notwithstanding the\n\nverdict, Sentinel argued that Olson did not properly disclose his indemnification\n\nagreement with Mistras and that the evidence was legally insufficient to prove that\n\nOlson incurred the expense of attorney’s fees because he did not admit into\n\nevidence a copy of a written document demonstrating his arrangement with\n\nMistras. Mistras argued that it had disclosed the potential indemnity to Sentinel\n\nand attached its responses to Sentinel’s requests for disclosure under Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 194.2, in which it stated, “Defendants . . . may have indemnity rights\n\npursuant [to] the Amended and Restated Bylaws of [Mistras].”\n\n      Mistras also attached to its motion for entry of judgment a copy of the\n\nassignment of claims executed between Olson and Mistras, Mistras’s certificate of\n\nincorporation and bylaws, and correspondence in which Mistras informed Sentinel\n\nof its intention to seek reimbursement from Sentinel for fees Mistras had advanced\n\nin defense of the claims against Olson. The assignment of claims stated that Olson\n\nmight be entitled to “Indemnification Rights” based on his employment with\n\nSentinel or other applicable law, that Mistras had advanced payment of attorney’s\n\n\n                                         18\n\ffees and other costs “for Olson’s benefit through at least October 7, 2011,” and that\n\n“Mistras [might] terminate advancement of Fees and Costs, in Mistras’s sole and\n\nabsolute discretion, at any time after October 7, 2011.” It also stated that “Mistras\n\nshall have the sole and absolute right to recover its entire actual Fees and Costs,\n\nwithout limitation, out of any recovery from the Indemnification Rights.”\n\n      Olson introduced a summary of the attorney’s fees incurred in the case,\n\nsupported by the billing records, which was admitted without objection.8 The\n\ndocumentary evidence of Olson’s attorney’s fees included approximately 170\n\npages of redacted billing records reflecting the tasks performed by various\n\nattorneys and support personnel, the amount of time required for those tasks, the\n\nbillable rate charged by the various attorneys and personnel, and other litigation\n\nexpenses incurred in the course of the litigation. The summary reflected total\n\nactual billings of $734,750 and included an estimate that Olson would incur an\n\nadditional $100,000 in fees through the October 2011 trial, for a total of $834,750.\n\n      Olson also presented the testimony of Zavitsanos, his attorney. Zavitsanos\n\ntestified that Mistras paid the fees in this case because it “had an arrangement\n\nwhere they would advance the fees for him.” Zavitsanos testified that the billings\n\nsubmitted were “net hours” and did not include time that he “wrote off” for his\n\n\n8\n      Olson also presented the affidavit of the business manager for Zavitsanos’s law\n      firm, attesting to the amount of attorney’s fees that Mistras had already paid on\n      Olson’s behalf.\n                                         19\n\fown review of associate attorney work that he “did not feel was appropriate to\n\ndouble up” or for extra research for which the client should not have been billed.\n\nHe also testified that the summary contained an estimate of the “time and money\n\nthat will be spent through the conclusion of this trial for the month of October” that\n\nhad not been billed to the client yet. He testified that during trial and “probably for\n\nthe two weeks before” the attorneys “probably work at least 12 to 14 hours a day,\n\nmaybe more.” He testified that the trial itself lasted three and half weeks.\n\n      Zavitsanos also testified that the summary and attached bills did not include\n\nevery expense incurred—he testified that he knew some attorneys had worked on\n\nthe case whose hours were not reflected in the billing. The summary also did not\n\ninclude attorney time spent consulting with experts on damages or computer\n\nforensics, expenses related to attorney travel to Memphis where Olson was\n\nworking at one point during the pending litigation, or expenses related to Roberts.\n\nZavitsanos stated, “I’m limiting myself to the fees that we are entitled to under the\n\nBusiness and Commerce Code section that concerns noncompetes.”\n\n      Zavitsanos also testified generally about his qualifications and experience,\n\nstating that he had been practicing law in the Houston area, among other locations,\n\nsince he graduated from law school in 1987 and had done “a fair number of\n\nemployment cases and trade secret cases and things of that sort.” He also testified\n\nthat he was board certified in civil trial law. He stated that he was familiar with the\n\n                                          20\n\frates charged by attorneys in Harris County and the rates for this specific type of\n\ncase involving employment disputes.\n\n      Regarding the work performed in this particular case, Zavitsanos testified\n\nthat the number of “emergency matters that Sentinel requested” early on in the case\n\nrequired intensive work that prevented firm employees from working on other\n\nmatters.   Zavitsanos also stated that discovery in this case was “very, very\n\nchallenging.”    He outlined the usual course of discovery in a case of this\n\ncomplexity, including written discovery, depositions, and forensic computer\n\nexperts, and he stated,\n\n      And all of that was done here; but it was done repeatedly, repeatedly,\n      repeatedly, repeatedly. I mean, I cannot recall—I have been doing\n      this almost 25 years. I cannot recall a case where we have had to\n      get—we have had to file so many motions to get basic information out\n      of the other side as much as this case.\n\nHe testified that the temporary injunction hearing was delayed by prolonged\n\ndiscovery on Sentinel’s part, that when the hearing occurred, it lasted for a week as\n\nopposed to the more typical two or three hour hearing, and that Sentinel also filed\n\nan interlocutory appeal challenging the trial court’s denial of its application for\n\ntemporary injunction.     Zavitsanos testified that the firm expended “close to\n\n$100,000 responding to that appeal; and then right before we were to appear before\n\nthe court of appeals to argue the case, [Sentinel] dropped the appeal.”\n\n\n\n\n                                         21\n\f      After the parties had designated that they were prepared to proceed to trial\n\nand the case had been assigned a preferential trial setting, Sentinel also pursued\n\narbitration “out of left field” against Olson, which it then subsequently dropped\n\nafter four months. Zavitsanos stated that this arbitration action “probably involved\n\nover $150,000 in fees that [Mistras] paid, over 150,000 that was unnecessary”\n\nbecause Sentinel later changed its position and returned to the trial court to try all\n\nof its claims. He also testified that defending this case was very difficult because\n\nSentinel repeatedly changed legal theories and added and dropped numerous\n\nfactual allegations and because Sentinel had taken “some very novel [legal]\n\npositions.”\n\n      Zavitsanos testified that “at least 90 percent” of the amount reflected in the\n\nsummary and billing had been devoted to defending Olson against the enforcement\n\nof the “noncompetition agreement versus any of these other claims that . . . might\n\nhave been in and out of the case at other times or not before the jury at this time.”\n\nHe stated: “[A]ll the current claims, they all stem from the construction, the\n\napplication, the reading of Mr. Olson’s agreement.” He specifically stated that\n\n“with the exception of about 10 percent” of the total included in the summary and\n\nattached billings, “every minute is either directly related to . . . the noncompete\n\nclaims concerning Jody Olson or claims that are intertwined so tightly with the\n\nnoncompete that you can’t—you can’t separate one from the other.” He went on to\n\n                                         22\n\fgive the specific examples of “the week-long temporary injunction hearing, that\n\nwas only about a noncompete, nothing else” and stated that “the work reflected on\n\nthe invoices that we are requesting reimbursement for under the statute, it is either\n\ndirectly related—directly related to the noncompete issues or intertwined with the\n\nnoncompete issues.” Although Sentinel’s counsel questioned Zavitsanos about the\n\n“intertwined” nature of the claimed attorney’s fees, Sentinel did not object to the\n\nevidence supporting the request for attorney’s fees on any basis.\n\n      Zavitsanos testified that, of the approximately $834,000 in billing presented\n\nas evidence, Olson was requesting ninety percent of that as related to defending\n\nagainst the claims under the covenant not to compete, which amounted to\n\n$751,275. He stated that due to the length of the trial, and the fact that “an appeal\n\nwould involve a review of the entire record and research of the issues that they\n\nhave raised,” an appeal in this case “would be about $150,000.” In the event of\n\nfurther appeal to the Texas Supreme Court, the fees would be an additional\n\n$50,000 because “most of the work would have been done with the court of\n\nappeals.” He testified that, based on his experience and familiarity with rates\n\ncharged for similar services, he believed that the rates reflected in the billing and\n\nthe amount of time billed were reasonable and necessary.\n\n\n\n\n                                         23\n\fB.    Submission of Olson’s Entitlement to Attorney’s Fees to Jury\n\n      In the second part of its first issue, Sentinel argues that the trial court erred\n\nin submitting the issue of Olson’s entitlement to attorney’s fees to the jury. It\n\nargues that the issue of attorney’s fees was a question of law for the trial court to\n\ndetermine and that the trial court erred in “allowing an ‘advisory jury’ to\n\ndetermine” the issues in Question 7 of the jury charge. In its second issue, it\n\nargues that the trial court erred in granting judgment for attorney’s fees because\n\nthere is no evidence, or insufficient evidence, that Sentinel knew at the time of the\n\nexecution of the agreement that the covenant did not contain limitations as to time,\n\ngeographical area, and scope of activity to be restrained that were reasonable or\n\nthat it sought to enforce the covenant to a greater extent than was necessary.\n\n      Because this case involves the enforcement of a covenant not to compete,\n\nthe Covenants Not to Compete Act applies and preempts “any other . . . procedures\n\nand remedies,” including the common law. TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. § 15.52\n\n(Vernon 2011); Glattly v.

BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. § 15.51(c). Because the statute provides that “the\n\ncourt may award” attorney’s fees, the award of attorney’s fees is within the trial\n\ncourt’s discretion and is not mandatory. Spring v. Walthall, Sachse & Pipes, Inc.,\n\nNo. 04-09-00474-CV, 2010 WL 2102988, at *11 (Tex. App.—San Antonio May\n\n26, 2010, no pet.) (mem. op.) (citing Bocquet v. Herring, 972 S.W.2d 19, 20 (Tex.\n\n1998) (holding that statutes providing that court “may award” are permissive and\n\nrequire abuse of discretion to overturn order granting or denying award)).\n\n      As a predicate to an award of attorney’s fees under section 15.51(c), Olson\n\nhad to prove that (1) Sentinel knew at the time the employment agreement was\n\nexecuted that the covenant did not contain limitations as to time, geographical area,\n\nand scope of activity to be restrained that were reasonable and the limitations\n\nimposed a greater restraint than necessary to protect Sentinel’s goodwill or other\n\nbusiness interest, and (2) Sentinel sought to enforce the covenant to a greater\n\nextent than was necessary to protect its goodwill or other business interest.

See TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. § 15.51(c);\n\nSpring, 2010 WL 2102988, at *12.\n\n       Sentinel does not provide any argument on appeal that these determinations\n\nshould be construed as questions of law rather than as questions of fact. Sentinel\n\ndid not object to the jury charge in this case before it was submitted to the jury, and\n\nit never requested that the trial court, rather than the jury, make the factual\n\ndetermination required by section 15.51(c).        Thus, it waived any complaint\n\nregarding the submission of this issue to the jury. See Cruz, 364 S.W.3d at 829\n\n(complaint to jury charge is waived unless specifically included in objection);\n\nCross, 501 S.W.2d at 873 (holding that failure to object before charge is read to\n\njury waives complaint).\n\n       However, the jury question complained of—Question 7—asked whether\n\n“Sentinel (1) [knew] at the time the Employment Agreement was signed that the\n\ncovenant not to compete did not contain limitations as to time, geographical area,\n\nor scope of activity to be restrained that were reasonable and (2) [sought] to\n\nenforce the limitations to a greater extent than necessary to protect [its] business\n\ninterest[.]”   It did not ask the jury whether Olson was ultimately entitled to\n\nattorney’s fees based on that finding; that determination was made by the trial\n\ncourt in rendering the final judgment. Cf. Burrow v. Arce, 997 S.W.2d 229, 245–\n\n                                          26\n\f46 (Tex. 1999) (concluding that, although contested fact issues may be resolved by\n\njury, ultimate decision regarding equitable remedy of forfeiture of attorney’s fees\n\nis discretionary but “must be made by the court”).\n\n      Sentinel argues, in its second issue, that “[t]he trial court erred in adopting\n\nthe ‘advisory jury’s’ answer to Question No. 7,” or, in the alternative, that the\n\nevidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the jury’s answer to\n\nQuestion 7. Regardless of whether the trial court or the jury made the required\n\nresolution of the fact questions in Question 7, the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nsupporting the predicate findings of section 15.51 is subject to the same review.\n\nSee Catalina v. Blasdel, 881 S.W.2d 295, 297 (Tex. 1994) (holding that trial\n\ncourt’s findings of fact have same weight as jury’s verdict, and we review legal\n\nand factual sufficiency of evidence used to support them as we would review jury’s\n\nfindings).\n\n      In a legal sufficiency, or “no-evidence” review, we determine whether the\n\nevidence would enable reasonable and fair-minded people to reach the verdict\n\nunder review. City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 827 (Tex. 2005). In\n\nconducting this review, we credit favorable evidence if a reasonable fact-finder\n\ncould, and we disregard contrary evidence unless a reasonable fact-finder could\n\nnot. Id. We consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the finding under\n\nreview and indulge every reasonable inference that would support it.

Id. at 810.\n\n      In reviewing the factual sufficiency of the evidence, we “must consider and\n\nweigh all the evidence and should set aside the judgment only if it is so contrary to\n\nthe overwhelming weight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust.” Arias\n\nv. Brookstone, L.P., 265 S.W.3d 459, 468 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2007,\n\npet. denied) (citing Cain v. Bain, 709 S.W.2d 175, 176 (Tex. 1986) (per curiam)).\n\n      The jury found, and the trial court impliedly agreed, that Sentinel knew at\n\nthe time the employment agreement was signed that it did not contain reasonable\n\nlimitations and that Sentinel sought to enforce the limitations to a greater extent\n\nthan necessary to protect its business interests. Olson cites Corey’s testimony that\n\nhe purposely made the geographical area covered by the non-compete provision\n\nbroad “to cover pretty much all of the general areas that we think or anticipate\n\nwould be covered” and Corey’s testimony that he relied on a provision allowing a\n\ntrial court to reform the agreement if necessary. The covenant not to compete\n\nexpressly stated that “Employee and Company agree that the limitations as to time\n\nand scope of activity to be restrained are reasonable,” but it was silent on the\n\n                                          28\n\freasonableness of the geographic area.        Olson argues that this supports a\n\nconclusion that Corey did not attempt to tailor the non-compete provisions to areas\n\nwhere Olson would be working, even though the terms of the agreement itself\n\nshowed that Corey knew such specificity could be required by a court reforming\n\nthe agreement.\n\n      Olson also cites his e-mail to Corey, stating that the three-year time\n\nlimitation in the non-compete was excessive considering that he would only\n\nreceive two weeks’ severance pay, and Corey’s response, stating that Olson would\n\nstill be entitled to work as an inspector doing turnarounds. Olson argues that this\n\nexchange supports a conclusion that Corey knew that the three-year period of\n\nenforcement for the broad provisions regarding the activities to be restricted—\n\nwhich included a general restriction against “[c]onducting, engaging or\n\nparticipating in . . . Inspection, Risk Based Inspection and Asset Integrity\n\nManagement services in any capacity in which Employee served while working\n\nwith Company”—were unreasonable.\n\n      Olson also cites evidence supporting the finding that Sentinel attempted to\n\nenforce the limitations of the non-compete to a greater extent that was necessary to\n\nprotect its business interests.    Sentinel sought to enforce the non-compete\n\nprovision’s general ban on “competing,” including restricting Olson from working\n\nin geographic areas that were not tailored to Olson’s work on behalf of Sentinel or\n\n                                        29\n\feven to Sentinel’s own current business. Sentinel also sought to prevent Olson\n\nfrom working for Mistras, where Olson worked conducting inspections, in spite of\n\nCorey’s assurance in the e-mail that the non-compete did not prevent Olson from\n\nworking turnarounds as an inspector. Corey testified that Sentinel wanted to\n\nprevent Olson from doing work for a competitor “in any capacity” that overlapped\n\nwith managerial duties at Sentinel: “If he became a manager for us, and also that\n\nincluded sweeping the floors at Sentinel, that means that he can’t go to [Mistras]\n\nand sweep the floors, in my opinion. ‘In any capacity,’ is what it says. Now,\n\ninspector, manager, supervisor, dishwasher, it doesn’t matter.”\n\n      We agree that this evidence supports the jury’s factual determination in\n\nQuestion 7. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the finding, we\n\nconclude that there is more than a scintilla of evidence that Corey knew at the time\n\nhe entered into the employment agreement on behalf of Sentinel that the non-\n\ncompete was unnecessarily broad and lacked reasonable limitations and that\n\nSentinel sought to enforce the covenant to a greater extent than necessary to protect\n\nits interests. See City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 810, 822.\n\n      Sentinel, however, cites Corey’s testimony that he obtained the form for the\n\nemployment agreement with the covenant not to compete on the internet, Olson’s\n\ntestimony that he signed the employment agreement of his own free will, and the e-\n\nmail Olson sent to Corey stating that he was happy with the terms and conditions\n\n                                         30\n\fin the employment agreement to support its argument that the evidence was\n\ninsufficient to support the findings here.       Nevertheless, even considering this\n\nevidence, we cannot conclude that the finding was so contrary to the overwhelming\n\nweight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust. See Arias, 265 S.W.3d at\n\n468.\n\n       We conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support the predicate\n\nfindings required by section 15.51(c) to permit an award of attorney’s fees.\n\n       Even in light of the jury’s finding, Sentinel argues that Lazer Spot, Inc. v.\n\nHiring Partners, Inc. prevents an award of attorney’s fees here because, as it\n\nargues in its brief, “the court of appeals expressly held that the new employers of a\n\npromisor under a covenant not to compete with a former employer are not entitled\n\nto recover attorney’s fees.” See 387 S.W.3d 40, 53 n.24 (Tex. App.—Texarkana\n\n2012, pet. denied) (“Because the express language of the statute does not apply\n\nhere, Lazer Spot is not entitled to attorney’s fees under Section 15.51(c). We find\n\nno authority to support the proposition that a third party, such as Lazer Spot, is\n\nentitled to attorney’s fees pursuant to this section of the statute.”) (internal citations\n\nomitted). However, Lazer Spot is distinguishable because the award of attorney’s\n\nfees here was made to Olson himself, not to Mistras.\n\n       The only other argument that Sentinel advances on appeal opposing the trial\n\ncourt’s determination that Olson was entitled to attorney’s fees is its argument that\n\n                                           31\n\fthe trial court’s error contributed to the attorney’s fees in this case: “Failing to\n\nperform its duty as a matter of law, the trial court committed errors of law that\n\ncontributed to lengthy litigation, and unnecessary increased fees. The trial court\n\nparticipated in and compounded the error resulting in the instant challenged fee\n\naward.” We have already concluded that the trial court did not fail to perform its\n\nduty to reform the covenant not to compete. Although the protracted litigation in\n\nthis case may have served to increase the amount of attorney’s fees incurred,\n\nSentinel, as the plaintiff, was in a better position to resolve the matter than the trial\n\ncourt.\n\n         Thus, Sentinel has failed to show that the trial court abused its discretion in\n\nawarding Olson attorney’s fees. See TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. § 15.51(c);\n\nSpring, 2010 WL 2102988, at *11 (stating that because statute provides that “the\n\ncourt may award” attorney’s fees, award of attorney’s fees is within trial court’s\n\ndiscretion and is not mandatory).\n\n         We overrule Sentinel’s first and second issues.\n\nC.       Amount of Attorney’s Fees\n\n         In its third issue, Sentinel argues that the trial court erred in granting\n\njudgment for $750,000 in attorney’s fees because the fees were not “actually and\n\nreasonably incurred by the promisor in defending the action to enforce the\n\ncovenant.” See TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. § 15.51(c) (allowing promisor, like\n\n\n                                            32\n\fOlson, who has established statutory predicate facts, to recover “the costs,\n\nincluding reasonable attorney’s fees, actually and reasonably incurred by the\n\npromisor in defending the action to enforce the covenant”).\n\n      The issue of the amount of attorney’s fees to be awarded here was a fact\n\nquestion that was submitted to the jury. See Garcia v. Gomez, 319 S.W.3d 638,\n\n642 (Tex. 2010) (“Generally, the determination of reasonable attorney’s fees is a\n\nquestion of fact. . . .”); Bocquet, 972 S.W.2d at 21 (analyzing attorney’s fees under\n\nDeclaratory Judgments Act and stating, “In general, ‘[t]he reasonableness of\n\nattorney’s fees, the recovery of which is authorized by . . . statute, is a question of\n\nfact for the jury’s determination’”) (quoting Trevino v. Am. Nat’l Ins. Co., 168\n\nS.W.2d 656, 660 (Tex. 1943) (analyzing award of attorney’s fees in conjunction\n\nwith suit on insurance policy)); Stewart Title Guar. Co. v. Aiello, 941 S.W.2d 68,\n\n73 (Tex. 1997) (“The award of appellate fees is a question of fact for the jury. As\n\nsuch, we will not disturb the jury’s decision to award the Aiellos less than they\n\nrequested.”).\n\n      The jury charge asked the jury, “What is a reasonable fee for the necessary\n\nservices of Jody Olson’s attorneys in this case in defending the claim that Jody\n\nOlson breached the non-competition agreement in this case, stated in dollars and\n\ncents?” The jury was given a list of factors to consider in determining the amount\n\nof a reasonable fee. It found that Olson was entitled to $750,000 for preparation\n\n                                          33\n\fand trial, $150,000 for an appeal to the Court of Appeals, and $50,000 for an\n\nappeal to the Supreme Court of Texas.\n\n      Sentinel did not object to this question before the charge was submitted to\n\nthe jury. Thus, it has waived any complaint that the jury did not consider fees\n\n“actually incurred” in reaching its answer.      See Cruz, 364 S.W.3d at 829\n\n(complaint to jury charge is waived unless specifically included in objection);\n\nCross, 501 S.W.2d at 873 (holding that failure to object before charge is read to\n\njury waives complaint). We measure the sufficiency of the evidence to support the\n\njury’s answer against the charge that was actually given. See Osterberg v. Peca,\n\n12 S.W.3d 31, 55 (Tex. 2000) (“[I]t is the court’s charge, not some other\n\nunidentified law, that measures the sufficiency of the evidence when the opposing\n\nparty fails to object to the charge.”); Soon Phat, L.P. v. Alvarado, 396 S.W.3d 78,\n\n90 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2013, pet. denied) (“When the parties have\n\nnot objected at trial to the substance of the law set forth in the jury charge, we\n\nreview sufficiency of the evidence in light of legal standards contained in the\n\nunobjected-to charge.”).\n\n      Regarding the amount of attorney’s fees, the party applying for the award\n\nbears the burden of proof. El Apple I, Ltd. v. Olivas, 370 S.W.3d 757, 762–63\n\n(Tex. 2012). In El Apple, the supreme court stated:\n\n      That proof should include the basic facts underlying the lodestar,\n      which are: (1) the nature of the work, (2) who performed the services\n                                        34\n\f      and their rate, (3) approximately when the services were performed,\n      and (4) the number of hours worked. An attorney could, of course,\n      testify to these details, but in all but the simplest cases, the attorney\n      would probably have to refer to some type of record or documentation\n      to provide this information.\n\nId. at 763. Thus, the supreme court held that, when applying for a fee under the\n\nlodestar method, “the applicant must provide sufficient details of the work\n\nperformed before the court can make a meaningful review of the fee request” and\n\nthat such evidence includes “documentation of the services performed, who\n\nperformed them and at what hourly rate, when they were performed, and how\n\nmuch time the work required.” Id. at 764.\n\n      Here, the record contains a summary of Olson’s attorney’s fees, showing a\n\n“grand total” of $834,750 in fees incurred through the end of trial. This summary\n\nwas supported by approximately 170 pages of redacted bills detailing the services\n\nthat resulted in those fees, including the type of services performed, the amount of\n\ntime expended on each service, the identity of the person who performed them and\n\ntheir billable rates, and the dates the services were performed.        Zavitsanos’s\n\ntestimony on the amount of fees incurred explained and expounded upon the\n\nbillings admitted into the record and the fees incurred as a result of the trial that\n\nhad not yet been billed to Olson.       Zavitsanos further testified, based on his\n\nknowledge of the rates in Harris County and his experience with similar litigation,\n\nthat the fees requested were reasonable and necessary. His testimony detailed the\n\n\n                                         35\n\fwork done on this case, including an emergency injunction hearing, a temporary\n\ninjunction hearing, an interlocutory appeal, extensive discovery, an aborted\n\narbitration, and numerous other motions and pleadings required to defend Olson\n\nagainst Sentinel’s claim that he breached his covenant not to compete. Zavitsanos\n\nopined that at least ninety percent of the work included in total billed amount of\n\n$834,750 was work that either directly related to defending Olson on the non-\n\ncompete claim or was so intertwined that it could not be separated. The jury\n\nawarded Olson almost ninety percent of the total billing.\n\n      Sentinel argues that “the evidence establishes the sum of $271,384.75 in\n\nattorneys, paralegals, secretaries and others’ fees were billed from the inception of\n\nthe case until just after the trial court’s four day temporary injunction hearing\n\nregarding the covenant not to compete.”        However, Zavitsanos’s uncontested\n\ntestimony established that numerous legal proceedings occurred following the\n\ntemporary injunction hearing in which Olson incurred attorney’s fees in defending\n\nagainst Sentinel’s claim that he breached the non-compete, including an\n\ninterlocutory appeal of the trial court’s denial of the temporary injunction,\n\nSentinel’s attempt to pursue arbitration against Olson, and a three-and-a-half-week\n\ntrial. Other than this argument, Sentinel does not contest the reasonableness of\n\nOlson’s attorney’s rates or the amount of time spent on representing Olson.\n\n\n\n\n                                         36\n\f      We conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury’s award of\n\n$750,000 in attorney’s fees to Olson.\n\n      We overrule Sentinel’s third issue.\n\nD.    Segregation of Fees\n\n      In its fourth issue, Sentinel argues that the trial court erred in awarding\n\n$750,000 in attorney’s fees because the fees were not segregated.\n\n      Because attorney’s fees are only recoverable pursuant to a contract or\n\nstatute, “fee claimants have always been required to segregate fees between claims\n\nfor which they are recoverable and claims for which they are not.” Tony Gullo\n\nMotors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 311 (Tex. 2006) (citing Aiello, 941\n\nS.W.2d at 73). However, the supreme court has recognized a narrow exception\n\n“when discrete legal services advanced both a recoverable and unrecoverable\n\nclaim” and thus “are so intertwined that they need not be segregated.” Id. at 313–\n\n14. The court stated:\n\n      This standard does not require more precise proof for attorney’s fees\n      than for any other claims or expenses. Here, Chapa’s attorneys did\n      not have to keep separate time records when they drafted the fraud,\n      contract, or DTPA paragraphs of her petition; an opinion would have\n      sufficed stating that, for example, 95 percent of their drafting time\n      would have been necessary even if there had been no fraud claim.\n      The court of appeals could then have applied standard factual and\n      legal sufficiency review to the jury’s verdict based on that evidence.”\n\nId. at 314.\n\n\n\n                                        37\n\f      Here, Zavitsanos testified that the amount included in the summary and\n\nsupporting bills introduced at trial did not include every fee and expense incurred\n\nin the course of trial. For example, Zavitsanos testified that Carey Roberts, one of\n\nthe other defendants in this case, was “swallowing” his attorney’s fees because\n\nthere was no valid legal basis for him to request them from the court. Zavitsanos\n\nfurther testified that the amounts sought by Olson were all for work related directly\n\nto defending against Sentinel’s claim that he breached the covenant not to compete\n\nor for work that was intertwined with that claim. Zavitsanos opined that, of the\n\nwork presented in the billing admitted at trial, “at least” ninety percent of it was\n\nnecessary in defending Olson against Sentinel’s claim for breach of the covenant\n\nnot to compete.\n\n      On appeal, Sentinel does not identify any specific amount of time or items of\n\nwork that were included in the fees requested by Olson that were attributable only\n\nto non-recoverable legal fees, aside from its general allegation that “[t]here is no\n\nevidence discre[te] legal services promoted both the defense of the tortious\n\ninterference claims against Mistras, as well as the claim for attorney fees to reform\n\nthe non-compete agreement.” As indicated above, Zavitsanos’s testimony is some\n\nevidence that numerous, discrete legal services either related directly to the claim\n\nagainst Olson or were intertwined with that claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                         38\n\f      Thus, we conclude that Olson’s evidence supporting his attorney’s fees was\n\nsufficiently segregated. See id. at 313–14. We have already concluded that the\n\nevidence was sufficient to support the jury’s award. See id. at 314.\n\n      We overrule Sentinel’s fourth issue.\n\nE.    Conditional Appellate Fees\n\n      In its fifth issue, Sentinel argues that the trial court erred in awarding Olson\n\nconditional appellate attorney’s fees because there was “no evidence that such fees\n\nwere or have been actually and reasonably incurred.”\n\n      We read the trial court’s judgment as awarding appellate attorney’s fees only\n\nafter the expense is incurred as a result of Sentinel’s unsuccessful appeal. We\n\ntherefore reject Sentinel’s position and conclude that the record demonstrates,\n\nbased on Zavitsanos’s testimony, that Olson did incur attorney’s fees in defending\n\nagainst Sentinel’s unsuccessful appeal to this Court. See Law Offices of Windle\n\nTurley, P.C. v. French, 164 S.W.3d 487, 493 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2005, no pet.)\n\n(rejecting argument that conditional appellate attorney’s fees had not been\n\n“incurred” as required by Civil Practice and Remedies Code for award of\n\nattorney’s fees). However, pursuant to the supreme court’s holding in El Apple,\n\nwe conclude that the record on appeal does not, at this time, contain sufficient\n\nevidence supporting the amount of attorney’s fees incurred by Olson on appeal.\n\nSee 370 S.W.3d at 764 (“For purposes of lodestar calculations, [evidence\n\n\n                                         39\n\fsupporting a request for attorney’s fees] includes, at a minimum, documentation of\n\nthe services performed, who performed them and at what hourly rate, when they\n\nwere performed, and how much time the work required.”). The only evidence\n\nsupporting the award of appellate attorney’s fees was Zavitsanos’s very general\n\ntestimony that Olson would incur about $150,000 in fees if the case were appealed\n\nto this Court and an additional $50,000 in fees in the event of an appeal to the\n\nTexas Supreme Court.\n\n      Accordingly, we sustain part of Sentinel’s fifth issue and remand for the trial\n\ncourt to adjust the amount of appellate attorney’s fees awarded to conform to the\n\napplicable lodestar calculations.\n\nF.    Pre-judgment Interest on Attorney’s Fees\n\n      In its sixth issue, Sentinel argues that the trial court erred in granting pre-\n\njudgment interest on attorney’s fees.\n\n      Sentinel first argues that award of pre-judgment interest on the attorney’s\n\nfees was improper because section 15.52 preempts any other provisions or law that\n\nmight entitle Olson to relief. Olson does not address the preemption issue at all.\n\nHowever, the statute permits recovery of “the costs, including reasonable\n\nattorney’s fees, actually and reasonably incurred by the promisor in defending the\n\naction to enforce the covenant.”        TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. § 15.51(c)\n\n(emphasis added). The purpose of pre-judgment interest is to compensate a party\n\n\n                                          40\n\ffor the lost use of money due as damages during the lapse of time between the\n\naccrual of the claim and the date of the judgment. City of Houston v. Texan Land\n\n& Cattle Co., 138 S.W.3d 382, 388 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2004, no\n\npet.). While the lost use of the money paid as attorney’s fees might, in some\n\ncircumstances, be considered a cost incurred in defending the action to enforce the\n\ncovenant under section 15.51, that does not appear to be the situation here. Olson\n\ndid not pay the attorney’s fees, so he did not incur any costs in the form of lost use\n\nof the money paid in attorney’s fees on his behalf by Mistras.\n\n      Thus, we conclude under the facts of this case, that the award of pre-\n\njudgment interest on the attorney’s fees that had already been paid on Olson’s\n\nbehalf do not fall under the permitted statutory recovery. See TEX. BUS. & COM.\n\nCODE ANN. § 15.51(c). This court and others have held that the Covenants Not to\n\nCompete Act preempts “any other . . . procedures and remedies,” including the\n\ncommon law. See id. § 15.52; Glattly, 332 S.W.3d at 645; Perez v. Tex. Disposal\n\nSys., Inc., 103 S.W.3d 591, 593–94 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2003, pet. denied)\n\n(concluding that employer that was not entitled to fees under section 15.51 was\n\nalso not entitled to fees under any other statute because section 15.51’s remedies\n\nprovisions, including provision addressing attorney’s fees, preempts award under\n\nany other law).\n\n\n\n\n                                         41\n\f      We sustain Sentinel’s challenge on this issue, and delete the award of pre-\n\njudgment interest from the judgment. 9\n\n                                      Conclusion\n\n      We reverse the award of conditional appellate attorney’s fees and remand for\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion. We further modify the judgment\n\nto delete the award of pre-judgment interest and affirm as modified.\n\n\n\n                                                 Evelyn V. Keyes\n                                                 Justice\n\nPanel consists of Justices Keyes, Higley, and Bland.\n\n\n\n\n9\n      Thus, we need not address Sentinel’s contention that there is a split in the courts of\n      appeals regarding the award of pre-judgment interest on paid attorney’s fees. See\n      Nova Cas. Co. v. Turner Constr. Co., 335 S.W.3d 698, 706 (Tex. App.—Houston\n      [14th Dist.] 2011, no pet.) (recognizing that some courts of appeals have held that\n      award of pre-judgment interest on attorney’s fees paid before judgment is\n      improper, but concluding that award of such pre-judgment interest is within trial\n      court’s discretion). Nor do we need to address Sentinel’s seventh issue, arguing\n      that the evidence was insufficient to support the trial court’s award of pre-\n      judgment interest.\n                                            42\n\f",

(“Sentinel”), sued appellees,\n\nMistras Group, Inc., Jody W. Olson, and Carey Roberts, for damages arising out of\n\nOlson’s alleged breach of a covenant not to compete in his employment agreement\n\fwith Sentinel and Mistras’s alleged tortious interference with the employment\n\nagreement. In bench conference before the submission of the charge to the jury,\n\nSentinel agreed with the defendants that the scope of the covenant not to compete\n\nwas overbroad as to its geographic limits. The trial court submitted eight questions\n\nto the jury on Sentinel’s claims against Mistras and Olson’s claims for attorney’s\n\nfees. The jury charge did not address the enforceability of the covenant not to\n\ncompete or Olson’s alleged breach, and Sentinel did not object to the charge. The\n\njury returned a verdict finding no liability on the part of any of the defendants.\n\nAfter the jury reached its verdict, the court reformed the covenant not to compete\n\nat Sentinel’s request. The trial court then entered judgment that Sentinel take\n\nnothing on its claims and that it pay Olson’s attorney’s fees pursuant to Texas\n\nBusiness and Commerce Code section 15.51.\n\n      In seven issues, Sentinel argues that: (1) “the covenant not to compete [was]\n\nenforceable as a matter of law,” that “even if the contract was ‘at will,’ the\n\ncovenant was enforceable,” that the trial court had a mandatory duty under section\n\n15.51(c) to reform the covenant not to compete to cause its limitations “to be\n\nreasonable and to impose a restraint that is not greater than necessary” and “to\n\nEnforce the covenant as reformed,” and that “[t]he trial court erred in determining\n\nthe covenant was unenforceable and ordering the parties to a jury trial” and “in\n\nplacing the issue of attorneys’ fees before the jury”; (2) the evidence was\n\n                                         2\n\finsufficient to support the jury’s finding, pursuant to section 15.51, that Sentinel\n\nknew at the time of execution of the employment agreement that the covenant did\n\nnot contain reasonable limitations and that it sought to enforce the limitations to a\n\ngreater extent than was necessary to protect its business interests; (3) the attorney’s\n\nfees awarded were not “actually incurred” by Olson; (4) the attorney’s fees were\n\nnot properly segregated; (5) the conditional appellate attorney’s fees were not\n\nactually and reasonably incurred; (6) the trial court’s award of $750,000 in\n\nattorney’s fees for trial expenses and $200,000 in conditional appellate fees should\n\nbe reversed and rendered or reformed; and (7) the trial court erred in granting pre-\n\njudgment interest on attorney’s fees.\n\n      We remand the award of appellate attorney’s fees. We further modify the\n\njudgment to delete the award of pre-judgment interest and affirm as modified.\n\n                                    Background\n\n      Olson works as an inspector of oil and gas refinery equipment. He obtained\n\ncertification from the American Petroleum Institute in 2002 and worked for a\n\nvariety of companies supervising “turnarounds,” or inspections that are conducted\n\nunder time-sensitive conditions while the facility is shut down. In February 2008,\n\nOlson began working for Sentinel, a Houston-based inspection company, as a\n\nturnaround supervisor. In January 2009, Sentinel promoted Olson to the position\n\nof assistant division manager of the Corpus Christi office.\n\n\n                                          3\n\f      On August 1, 2009, Sentinel’s general manager, Scott Corey, presented\n\nOlson with an employment agreement. The agreement provided the effective date\n\nfor Olson’s promotion to assistant division manager and stated the covered duties\n\nand managerial responsibilities covered by the agreement.         The employment\n\nagreement also contained a covenant not to compete, which provided, inter alia,\n\nthat Sentinel “has and will disclose” confidential information regarding customers,\n\ncustomer representatives, employees, and specialized training. The covenant not to\n\ncompete required that Olson “refrain from competing with the Company or\n\notherwise engaging in ‘Restricted Activities’ (as defined below), for a reasonable\n\nperiod of time” in order to protect the confidential information. The covenant\n\ndefined the “Restricted Period” as “a period of three (3) years after the Termination\n\nDate [during which Olson] will not, directly or indirectly, as an employee, officer,\n\ndirector, shareholder, proprietor, agent, partner, recruiter, consultant, salesman,\n\nindependent contractor or in any other individual or representative capacity engage\n\nin any of the Restricted Activities.”     The covenant also provided that, upon\n\ntermination without cause, or in other circumstances within Sentinel’s discretion, it\n\nwould pay Olson four weeks’ salary.\n\n      The covenant not to compete defined “Restricted Activities” as including:\n\n      (i)    Conducting, engaging or participating in . . . Inspection, Risk\n             Based Inspection and Asset Integrity Management services in\n             any capacity in which Employee served while working with\n             Company, if such activity is on behalf of a customer that\n                                         4\n\f              Employee called upon or serviced while employed by\n              Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term “Restricted\n              Activities” as defined herein shall apply only if Employee\n              voluntarily terminates his employment with Employer, or if\n              Employer terminates Employee’s employment with Employer\n              for cause as defined in this Agreement[;]\n\n      (ii)    Recruiting, hiring, and/or attempting to recruit or hire . . . any\n              employees . . . of the Company; or contacting or\n              communicating with any other employees of the Company or\n              any of its Customers for the purpose or with the intent of\n              inducing such other employees to terminate their employment\n              with the Company or a Customer. . . ;\n\n      (iii)   Communicating, by any means, . . . with any Customer or\n              Customer Representative, to or for which the Company has\n              provided services at any time during Employee’s employment\n              by Company;\n\n      (iv)    Communicating, by any means . . . with an employee of the\n              Company after the Termination Date, provided, however, that\n              the foregoing shall not be deemed to preclude any casual\n              contacts which are strictly social . . . ;\n\n      (v)     Using, disclosing, publishing, copying, distributing           or\n              communicating any Company Information of any nature;\n\n      (vi)    Using, disclosing, publishing, copying, distributing or\n              communicating any Confidential Information of any nature.\n\n      The covenant not to compete defined the “Restricted Area” as including\n\nseven cities and four counties in Texas, plus locations in California, Utah,\n\nLouisiana, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Wyoming, and Trinidad and Tobago. The\n\nRestricted Area also included “a twenty (20) mile radius around all customers’\n\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\fjobsites and/or project facilities that Employee called on or serviced on behalf of\n\nEmployer in all geographic regions, wherever located.”\n\n      The covenant not to compete also provided:\n\n      Employee and Company agree that the limitations as to time and\n      scope of activity to be restrained are reasonable and do not impose a\n      greater restraint on Employee than is necessary to protect the property\n      rights and other business interests of Company. Notwithstanding the\n      foregoing, Employee reserves the right to seek reformation of the\n      limitations as to the time and scope of activity in a court of competent\n      jurisdiction, in accordance with Section 9, paragraph (a) hereunder.\n\nThe modification provision in Section 9, paragraph (a) provided in relevant part:\n\n      If any part of this Agreement is adjudged by a court of competent\n      jurisdiction to exceed the applicable legal limitation, then such\n      provisions shall be reformed to the maximum time, geographic or\n      other limitations permitted by applicable law, it being the parties’\n      intention to permit the reviewing court to modify this Agreement to\n      the extent necessary to cure any such invalidity or unenforceability.\n\n      Olson signed the employment agreement on August 7, 2009. After several\n\nmonths of employment as an assistant manager, Olson determined that the\n\ndemanding managerial position was a strain on his family and contacted appellee\n\nCarey Roberts, a man Olson had met while working for a previous employer.\n\nRoberts worked for Mistras, a company that specialized in non-destructive testing.\n\nIn the fall of 2009, Mistras offered Olson a job as a turnaround inspector—the type\n\nof job he had previously had at Sentinel before his promotion to assistant manager\n\nand the execution of the employment agreement. Olson remained at Sentinel as an\n\n\n\n                                         6\n\fassistant manager until he gave his notice of termination in December 2009, and he\n\nbegan working for Mistras as a turnaround supervisor in January 2010.\n\n      On February 23, 2010, Sentinel filed its original petition and request for\n\ninjunctive relief, alleging that the covenant not to compete was enforceable against\n\nOlson under section 15.50(a) of the Texas Business and Commerce Code, 1 which\n\nrequires that, in addition to being part of otherwise enforceable agreement, a\n\ncovenant not to compete must contain reasonable limitations as to time,\n\ngeographical area, and scope of activity to be restrained in order to be enforceable;\n\nthat Olson breached the covenant not to compete; and that Mistras and Roberts\n\ntortiously interfered with the contract between Olson and Sentinel by hiring\n\nOlson.2 Sentinel’s petition sought damages and attorney’s fees, and it included a\n\ndemand for a jury trial. It also sought injunctive relief in the form of a request for\n\na temporary restraining order and a temporary injunction. Sentinel also pled, “In\n\nthe alternative, if the Court should find that the covenant not to compete is not\n\nreasonably limited as to time, geographical area, or scope of activity, the Court\n\n\n\n\n1\n      See TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. § 15.50(a) (Vernon 2011).\n2\n      Sentinel also originally alleged that Olson breached a confidentiality agreement,\n      breached a fiduciary duty owed to Sentinel, misappropriated Sentinel’s trade\n      secrets, including theft of software productivity tools, and committed computer\n      fraud and abuse.\n\n                                          7\n\fshould reform the covenant as provided by Texas Business & Commerce Code\n\n§ 15.51(c).”\n\n      The trial court conducted a hearing in May 2010, and, on July 12, 2010, it\n\ndenied Sentinel’s application for a temporary injunction and granted summary\n\njudgment dismissing Sentinel’s claims for “theft/misappropriation of trade secrets\n\nunder the Theft Liability Act, theft of trade secrets, computer fraud abuse, civil\n                                              3\nconspiracy, and breach of fiduciary duty.”        Sentinel appealed the denial of its\n\napplication for a temporary injunction to this Court, but it eventually moved to\n\ndismiss the appeal after the record and briefing were filed.4 This Court issued a\n\nmemorandum opinion granting Sentinel’s motion to dismiss on January 18, 2011.\n\n      The case was tried to a jury from September 27 through October 14, 2011.\n\nOlson presented evidence that, prior to signing the employment agreement in\n\nAugust 2009, he questioned Corey about the terms of the non-compete clause in an\n\ne-mail exchange. Olson stated:\n\n      I have read the contract and I am happy with the terms and conditions\n      and ready to sign it and send it back. However the three year no\n      compete with two weeks of compensation seem[s] inadequate. . . .\n\n\n3\n      The trial court also issued numerous other orders, including an order granting in\n      part Sentinel’s motion to compel arbitration, an order granting Sentinel’s\n      subsequent motion to vacate the order compelling arbitration, and an order\n      granting Olson’s motion for partial summary judgment.\n4\n      The interlocutory appeal resulted in cause number 01-10-00607-CV.\n\n                                          8\n\f      Three years seem[s] a long time with two weeks of compensation. I\n      think six months would be fair for a three year no compete.\n\nCorey responded:\n\n      The no compete does not prevent you from working TA’s, etc., or\n      from being employable within the inspection industry. So if you were\n      fired, laid-off, etc. tomorrow, you would simply pick up the phone\n      and call one of your many choices to go to work as an inspector.\n      During the agreement period (3 years) it provides 4 weeks of\n      compensation, not 2 as stated in your emails. . . . 4 weeks of\n      compensation is plenty considering that no one else in our industry\n      would even consider this. The 2 weeks you are referring to is for the\n      period of time following the expiration of the 3 year agreement, if that\n      were to even happen.\n\n      Olson also testified regarding the nature of his work for Mistras.         He\n\ntestified that he worked as a turnaround supervisor, doing inspections just as he\n\nhad done prior to his promotion at Sentinel. He testified that he occasionally\n\ncontacted people on Mistras’s list of independent contractors to see who was\n\navailable to work on upcoming turnarounds, but he got those names from Mistras,\n\nand the contractors were not employees of Sentinel. He did not have the authority\n\nto hire them or determine their pay. He did not perform any managerial duties for\n\nMistras.\n\n      Corey testified at trial that Sentinel wanted to enforce the covenant not to\n\ncompete as written in the employment agreement. He stated that he believed\n\nOlson was prevented from performing for a competitor any duties encompassed by\n\nthe role of a manager for Sentinel: “If he became a manager for us, and also that\n\n\n                                         9\n\fincluded sweeping the floors at Sentinel, that means that he can’t go to [Mistras]\n\nand sweep the floors, in my opinion. ‘In any capacity,’ is what it says. Now,\n\ninspector, manager, supervisor, dishwasher, it doesn’t matter.”\n\n      Regarding the geographic area covered by the non-compete, Corey testified\n\nthat “[w]hen we wrote this geographic area that’s covered [in the covenant not to\n\ncompete], there’s no possible way we could have a crystal ball to know what Mr.\n\nOlson, or any other manager, what projects or what areas they may be working in\n\ntomorrow, next week, or next year.” He explained that they solved this problem by\n\nincluding broad provisions: “So we do the best job we can to list the specifics that\n\nwe know about at the time a contract is put in place to cover pretty much all the\n\ngeneral areas that we think or anticipate would be covered. And if there’s other\n\nareas that are added, then they would be covered; and that’s why we have\n\nprovisions that allow the court to modify it.”\n\n      John Zavitsanos, attorney for Olson, Mistras, and Roberts, testified\n\nregarding Olson’s reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees.\n\n      Before submitting the case to the jury, Sentinel’s counsel stated, on the\n\nrecord but outside the presence of the jury, “We agree that the geographical\n\nrestrictions are overbroad. We do not agree that the rest of the noncompete or the\n\nagreement to which it is—otherwise enforceable agreement to which it is ancillary\n\nor part of is unenforceable as written.” Counsel for Sentinel also agreed that the\n\n                                         10\n\f“provision regarding the geographical scope” of the non-compete agreement\n\nneeded to be reformed. 5 Sentinel maintained, however, that it had a valid tortious\n\ninterference claim against Mistras “for interfering with the remainder of Mr.\n\nOlson’s employment agreement.”\n\n      At the formal charge conference, the trial court presented a jury charge that\n\nasked: whether Sentinel provided Olson a definite term of employment, specialized\n\ntraining, or confidential information in connection with the non-competition\n\nagreement (Question 1); whether Mistras intentionally interfered with the\n\nemployment agreement between Olson and Sentinel and, if so, whether Sentinel\n\nsuffered any damages as a result (Questions 2 through 6); whether Olson had made\n\nthe factual showing necessary to obtain attorney’s fees under section 15.51(c)\n\n(Question 7); and the amount of Olson’s reasonable attorney’s fees for defending\n\nagainst Sentinel’s claim that he breached the covenant not to compete (Question 8).\n\nSentinel did not object in any way to the jury charge. 6\n\n      In its verdict, returned on October 14, 2011, the jury found no liability on the\n\npart of any of the defendants to Sentinel. It found that Sentinel had provided Olson\n\n\n5\n      Sentinel states in its brief that it made a request for reformation “in open court.”\n      The agreement that the geographical area covered by the covenant would need to\n      be reformed is the only discussion of potential reformation recorded in the record.\n6\n      The record does not contain any indication of the changes, if any, that were made\n      to the jury charge based on Sentinel’s concession that the geographical scope of\n      the covenant not to compete was overbroad and needed to be reformed.\n                                           11\n\fwith confidential information in connection with the non-competition agreement,\n\nbut it had not provided a definite term of employment or specialized training; that\n\nMistras did not intentionally interfere with the employment agreement between\n\nOlson and Sentinel; that Sentinel knew at the time the employment agreement was\n\nsigned that the covenant not to compete contained limitations as to time,\n\ngeographical area, or scope of activity to be restrained that were not reasonable and\n\nthat it sought to enforce the limitations to a greater extent than necessary to protect\n\nits business interest; and that “a reasonable fee for the necessary services of Jody\n\nOlson’s attorneys in this case in defending the claim that Jody Olson breached the\n\nnon-competition agreement in this case” was $750,000 for preparation and trial,\n\n$150,000 for an appeal to the court of appeals, and $50,000 for an appeal to the\n\nTexas Supreme Court.\n\n      On October 17, 2011, Sentinel filed an application for reformation of the\n\ncovenant not to compete and permanent injunction, which it subsequently amended\n\non October 31, 2011.       Sentinel asked the trial court to restrict Olson from\n\ncompeting within a 100-mile radius of its Corpus Christi office, the area in which\n\nOlson had worked for Sentinel, and from working or performing services for any\n\nSentinel clients for whom Olson “worked or [whom he] called on, regardless of\n\nlocation.” It also sought reformation of the scope of activities, asking that Olson\n\nbe restricted from acting as a manager in the inspection business, as a turnaround\n\n                                          12\n\fsupervisor, or as a supervisor. On October 21, 2011, Sentinel moved to withdraw\n\nthe case from the jury, asking the trial court to render judgment, and on October\n\n24, 2011, Sentinel filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, arguing\n\nthat the evidence was legally insufficient on the attorney’s fees issue.\n\n      The trial court reformed the non-compete agreement, but it did not order a\n\npermanent injunction. It also entered final judgment awarding Olson attorney’s\n\nfees in the amount of $750,000 for fees incurred during litigation in the trial court\n\nand $200,000 in conditional appellate attorney’s fees, and it awarded Olson,\n\nMistras, and Roberts court costs as prevailing parties. The final judgment also\n\nincluded an award of pre-judgment interest on the amount of attorney’s fees\n\nincurred by Olson that had already been paid.\n\n                             Covenant Not to Compete\n\n      In part of its first issue, Sentinel argues that the trial court erred in failing to\n\ndetermine enforceability as a matter of law and that the covenant not to compete\n\nbetween it and Olson was enforceable as a matter of law. It argues, “Because the\n\ncovenant is enforceable, the trial court should have reformed it and abused its\n\ndiscretion in failing to do so.”\n\nA.    Enforceability of the Covenant Not to Compete\n\n      Olson argues that Sentinel waived its complaints that the trial court erred in\n\nfailing to determine enforceability as a matter of law and that the covenant not to\n\n\n                                           13\n\fcompete was enforceable as a matter of law. We agree. Rather than seeking a\n\nruling from the trial court that the covenant not to compete was enforceable,\n\nSentinel requested a jury trial seeking damages against Olson and Mistras.\n\nSentinel then conceded on the last day of trial that the covenant was overbroad and,\n\ntherefore, not enforceable as written. Sentinel’s counsel agreed on the record that,\n\nat least as to geographical area, the covenant not to compete was overbroad, and it\n\nspecifically informed the trial court that it believed that the geographical area\n\ncovered by the covenant required reformation. See TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN.\n\n§ 15.50(a) (Vernon 2011) (requiring that, in addition to being part of otherwise\n\nenforceable agreement, covenant not to compete must contain reasonable\n\nlimitations as to time, geographical area, and scope of activity to be restrained in\n\norder to be enforceable); see also Marsh USA Inc. v.

Sentinel cannot now complain on\n\nappeal that it got what it asked for. See Tittizer v. Union Gas Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1560763\"><a href=\"/opinion/1560763/tittizer-v-union-gas-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">857</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 862 (Tex. 2005) (“[A] party cannot complain on appeal that the trial court\n\ntook a specific action that the complaining party requested, a doctrine commonly\n\nreferred to as ‘the invited error’ doctrine.”).\n\n\n\n\n                                           14\n\f      Furthermore, Sentinel did not object to the submission of Question 1, asking\n\nthe jury whether Sentinel provided additional consideration in connection with the\n\nnon-competition agreement.

P .\n\n33.1 (providing that complaint by timely request, objection, or motion in trial court\n\nis required to preserve issue for consideration on appeal).\n\n      Thus, Sentinel has waived, for purposes of appeal, any argument that the\n\ntrial court was obligated to make a legal ruling on the enforceability of the\n\ncovenant not to compete.\n\n\nB.    Reformation of the Covenant Not to Compete\n\n      Sentinel also argues that the trial court had a duty to reform the covenant not\n\nto compete under Business and Commerce Code section 15.51. 7 Because the trial\n\ncourt did reform the covenant, at Sentinel’s request, and Sentinel does not\n\n7\n      In part of its second issue, Sentinel argues, “Then, there is the matter of the trial\n      court’s failure or refusal to act upon Sentinel’s continued requests for\n      reformation.” Sentinel does not support its assertion that it made repeated requests\n      for reformation with citations to the record, nor does our review of the record\n      reveal any request for reformation other than the motion for reformation Sentinel\n      filed after the jury returned its verdict.\n                                           15\n\fchallenge the reformed covenant on appeal, we construe this as an argument that\n\nthe trial court erred in failing to reform the covenant not to compete until after the\n\ncase had been submitted to the jury.\n\n      The Covenants Not to Compete Act provides procedures and remedies in\n\nactions to enforce covenants not to compete. It provides:\n\n      If the covenant is found to be ancillary to or part of an otherwise\n      enforceable agreement but contains limitations as to time,\n      geographical area, or scope of activity to be restrained that are not\n      reasonable and impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect\n      the goodwill or other business interest of the promisee, the court shall\n      reform the covenant to the extent necessary to cause the limitations\n      contained in the covenant as to time, geographical area, and scope of\n      activity to be restrained to be reasonable and to impose a restraint that\n      is not greater than necessary to protect the goodwill or other business\n      interest of the promisee and enforce the covenant as reformed . . . .\n\nTEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. § 15.51(c) (Vernon 2011). Reformation pursuant to\n\nsection 15.51 is a remedy to be granted at a final hearing, whether on the merits or\n\nby summary judgment, not as interim relief. Gray Wireline Serv., Inc. v. Cavanna,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">374</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">464</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 470 (Tex.

App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n\n2003, no pet.).\n\n      The record reflects that, other than a one sentence pleading in the alternative\n\nin its original petition, Sentinel maintained throughout the course of the litigation\n\nthat the covenant not to compete was enforceable as written. It did not abandon\n\nthis argument until almost the end of trial, when it conceded that, at least as to the\n                                         16\n\fgeographical area, the covenant did not contain reasonable restrictions and needed\n\nto be reformed. It did not affirmatively ask the trial court to reform the agreement\n\nuntil after jury had returned its verdict, but, once Sentinel requested reformation,\n\nthe trial court reformed the agreement. Because Sentinel never sought a final\n\nhearing on this issue before the jury trial took place, and because it would have\n\nbeen inappropriate for the trial court to reform the covenant without holding a final\n\nhearing, we conclude that Sentinel has failed to show error on the part of the trial\n\ncourt.\n\n         Moreover, Sentinel has made no showing or argument that, had it timely\n\nsought reformation, rather than seeking it after rendition of the jury’s verdict on the\n\ncharge to which it agreed, the jury’s findings on liability would have been\n\ndifferent. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i) (requiring appellant’s brief to “contain a clear\n\nand concise argument for the contentions made, with appropriate citations to\n\nauthorities and to the record”).\n\n         We overrule Sentinel’s first issue as it relates to the enforceability of the\n\ncovenant not to compete.\n\n                                    Attorney’s Fees\n\n         In its remaining issues, Sentinel complains of the award of attorney’s fees to\n\nOlson under Business and Commerce Code section 15.51(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                           17\n\fA.    Facts Relating to Attorney’s Fees\n\n      John Zavitsanos, attorney for Olson, testified regarding the attorney’s fees\n\nincurred in this case. He stated that Olson incurred attorney’s fees and that Mistras\n\nadvanced Olson’s fees pursuant to an agreement between them. Sentinel did not\n\nobject to this testimony. However, in its motion for judgment notwithstanding the\n\nverdict, Sentinel argued that Olson did not properly disclose his indemnification\n\nagreement with Mistras and that the evidence was legally insufficient to prove that\n\nOlson incurred the expense of attorney’s fees because he did not admit into\n\nevidence a copy of a written document demonstrating his arrangement with\n\nMistras. Mistras argued that it had disclosed the potential indemnity to Sentinel\n\nand attached its responses to Sentinel’s requests for disclosure under Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 194.2, in which it stated, “Defendants . . . may have indemnity rights\n\npursuant [to] the Amended and Restated Bylaws of [Mistras].”\n\n      Mistras also attached to its motion for entry of judgment a copy of the\n\nassignment of claims executed between Olson and Mistras, Mistras’s certificate of\n\nincorporation and bylaws, and correspondence in which Mistras informed Sentinel\n\nof its intention to seek reimbursement from Sentinel for fees Mistras had advanced\n\nin defense of the claims against Olson. The assignment of claims stated that Olson\n\nmight be entitled to “Indemnification Rights” based on his employment with\n\nSentinel or other applicable law, that Mistras had advanced payment of attorney’s\n\n\n                                         18\n\ffees and other costs “for Olson’s benefit through at least October 7, 2011,” and that\n\n“Mistras [might] terminate advancement of Fees and Costs, in Mistras’s sole and\n\nabsolute discretion, at any time after October 7, 2011.” It also stated that “Mistras\n\nshall have the sole and absolute right to recover its entire actual Fees and Costs,\n\nwithout limitation, out of any recovery from the Indemnification Rights.”\n\n      Olson introduced a summary of the attorney’s fees incurred in the case,\n\nsupported by the billing records, which was admitted without objection.8 The\n\ndocumentary evidence of Olson’s attorney’s fees included approximately 170\n\npages of redacted billing records reflecting the tasks performed by various\n\nattorneys and support personnel, the amount of time required for those tasks, the\n\nbillable rate charged by the various attorneys and personnel, and other litigation\n\nexpenses incurred in the course of the litigation. The summary reflected total\n\nactual billings of $734,750 and included an estimate that Olson would incur an\n\nadditional $100,000 in fees through the October 2011 trial, for a total of $834,750.\n\n      Olson also presented the testimony of Zavitsanos, his attorney. Zavitsanos\n\ntestified that Mistras paid the fees in this case because it “had an arrangement\n\nwhere they would advance the fees for him.” Zavitsanos testified that the billings\n\nsubmitted were “net hours” and did not include time that he “wrote off” for his\n\n\n8\n      Olson also presented the affidavit of the business manager for Zavitsanos’s law\n      firm, attesting to the amount of attorney’s fees that Mistras had already paid on\n      Olson’s behalf.\n                                         19\n\fown review of associate attorney work that he “did not feel was appropriate to\n\ndouble up” or for extra research for which the client should not have been billed.\n\nHe also testified that the summary contained an estimate of the “time and money\n\nthat will be spent through the conclusion of this trial for the month of October” that\n\nhad not been billed to the client yet. He testified that during trial and “probably for\n\nthe two weeks before” the attorneys “probably work at least 12 to 14 hours a day,\n\nmaybe more.” He testified that the trial itself lasted three and half weeks.\n\n      Zavitsanos also testified that the summary and attached bills did not include\n\nevery expense incurred—he testified that he knew some attorneys had worked on\n\nthe case whose hours were not reflected in the billing. The summary also did not\n\ninclude attorney time spent consulting with experts on damages or computer\n\nforensics, expenses related to attorney travel to Memphis where Olson was\n\nworking at one point during the pending litigation, or expenses related to Roberts.\n\nZavitsanos stated, “I’m limiting myself to the fees that we are entitled to under the\n\nBusiness and Commerce Code section that concerns noncompetes.”\n\n      Zavitsanos also testified generally about his qualifications and experience,\n\nstating that he had been practicing law in the Houston area, among other locations,\n\nsince he graduated from law school in 1987 and had done “a fair number of\n\nemployment cases and trade secret cases and things of that sort.” He also testified\n\nthat he was board certified in civil trial law. He stated that he was familiar with the\n\n                                          20\n\frates charged by attorneys in Harris County and the rates for this specific type of\n\ncase involving employment disputes.\n\n      Regarding the work performed in this particular case, Zavitsanos testified\n\nthat the number of “emergency matters that Sentinel requested” early on in the case\n\nrequired intensive work that prevented firm employees from working on other\n\nmatters.   Zavitsanos also stated that discovery in this case was “very, very\n\nchallenging.”    He outlined the usual course of discovery in a case of this\n\ncomplexity, including written discovery, depositions, and forensic computer\n\nexperts, and he stated,\n\n      And all of that was done here; but it was done repeatedly, repeatedly,\n      repeatedly, repeatedly. I mean, I cannot recall—I have been doing\n      this almost 25 years. I cannot recall a case where we have had to\n      get—we have had to file so many motions to get basic information out\n      of the other side as much as this case.\n\nHe testified that the temporary injunction hearing was delayed by prolonged\n\ndiscovery on Sentinel’s part, that when the hearing occurred, it lasted for a week as\n\nopposed to the more typical two or three hour hearing, and that Sentinel also filed\n\nan interlocutory appeal challenging the trial court’s denial of its application for\n\ntemporary injunction.     Zavitsanos testified that the firm expended “close to\n\n$100,000 responding to that appeal; and then right before we were to appear before\n\nthe court of appeals to argue the case, [Sentinel] dropped the appeal.”\n\n\n\n\n                                         21\n\f      After the parties had designated that they were prepared to proceed to trial\n\nand the case had been assigned a preferential trial setting, Sentinel also pursued\n\narbitration “out of left field” against Olson, which it then subsequently dropped\n\nafter four months. Zavitsanos stated that this arbitration action “probably involved\n\nover $150,000 in fees that [Mistras] paid, over 150,000 that was unnecessary”\n\nbecause Sentinel later changed its position and returned to the trial court to try all\n\nof its claims. He also testified that defending this case was very difficult because\n\nSentinel repeatedly changed legal theories and added and dropped numerous\n\nfactual allegations and because Sentinel had taken “some very novel [legal]\n\npositions.”\n\n      Zavitsanos testified that “at least 90 percent” of the amount reflected in the\n\nsummary and billing had been devoted to defending Olson against the enforcement\n\nof the “noncompetition agreement versus any of these other claims that . . . might\n\nhave been in and out of the case at other times or not before the jury at this time.”\n\nHe stated: “[A]ll the current claims, they all stem from the construction, the\n\napplication, the reading of Mr. Olson’s agreement.” He specifically stated that\n\n“with the exception of about 10 percent” of the total included in the summary and\n\nattached billings, “every minute is either directly related to . . . the noncompete\n\nclaims concerning Jody Olson or claims that are intertwined so tightly with the\n\nnoncompete that you can’t—you can’t separate one from the other.” He went on to\n\n                                         22\n\fgive the specific examples of “the week-long temporary injunction hearing, that\n\nwas only about a noncompete, nothing else” and stated that “the work reflected on\n\nthe invoices that we are requesting reimbursement for under the statute, it is either\n\ndirectly related—directly related to the noncompete issues or intertwined with the\n\nnoncompete issues.” Although Sentinel’s counsel questioned Zavitsanos about the\n\n“intertwined” nature of the claimed attorney’s fees, Sentinel did not object to the\n\nevidence supporting the request for attorney’s fees on any basis.\n\n      Zavitsanos testified that, of the approximately $834,000 in billing presented\n\nas evidence, Olson was requesting ninety percent of that as related to defending\n\nagainst the claims under the covenant not to compete, which amounted to\n\n$751,275. He stated that due to the length of the trial, and the fact that “an appeal\n\nwould involve a review of the entire record and research of the issues that they\n\nhave raised,” an appeal in this case “would be about $150,000.” In the event of\n\nfurther appeal to the Texas Supreme Court, the fees would be an additional\n\n$50,000 because “most of the work would have been done with the court of\n\nappeals.” He testified that, based on his experience and familiarity with rates\n\ncharged for similar services, he believed that the rates reflected in the billing and\n\nthe amount of time billed were reasonable and necessary.\n\n\n\n\n                                         23\n\fB.    Submission of Olson’s Entitlement to Attorney’s Fees to Jury\n\n      In the second part of its first issue, Sentinel argues that the trial court erred\n\nin submitting the issue of Olson’s entitlement to attorney’s fees to the jury. It\n\nargues that the issue of attorney’s fees was a question of law for the trial court to\n\ndetermine and that the trial court erred in “allowing an ‘advisory jury’ to\n\ndetermine” the issues in Question 7 of the jury charge. In its second issue, it\n\nargues that the trial court erred in granting judgment for attorney’s fees because\n\nthere is no evidence, or insufficient evidence, that Sentinel knew at the time of the\n\nexecution of the agreement that the covenant did not contain limitations as to time,\n\ngeographical area, and scope of activity to be restrained that were reasonable or\n\nthat it sought to enforce the covenant to a greater extent than was necessary.\n\n      Because this case involves the enforcement of a covenant not to compete,\n\nthe Covenants Not to Compete Act applies and preempts “any other . . . procedures\n\nand remedies,” including the common law.

Olson cites Corey’s testimony that\n\nhe purposely made the geographical area covered by the non-compete provision\n\nbroad “to cover pretty much all of the general areas that we think or anticipate\n\nwould be covered” and Corey’s testimony that he relied on a provision allowing a\n\ntrial court to reform the agreement if necessary. The covenant not to compete\n\nexpressly stated that “Employee and Company agree that the limitations as to time\n\nand scope of activity to be restrained are reasonable,” but it was silent on the\n\n                                          28\n\freasonableness of the geographic area.        Olson argues that this supports a\n\nconclusion that Corey did not attempt to tailor the non-compete provisions to areas\n\nwhere Olson would be working, even though the terms of the agreement itself\n\nshowed that Corey knew such specificity could be required by a court reforming\n\nthe agreement.\n\n      Olson also cites his e-mail to Corey, stating that the three-year time\n\nlimitation in the non-compete was excessive considering that he would only\n\nreceive two weeks’ severance pay, and Corey’s response, stating that Olson would\n\nstill be entitled to work as an inspector doing turnarounds. Olson argues that this\n\nexchange supports a conclusion that Corey knew that the three-year period of\n\nenforcement for the broad provisions regarding the activities to be restricted—\n\nwhich included a general restriction against “[c]onducting, engaging or\n\nparticipating in . . . Inspection, Risk Based Inspection and Asset Integrity\n\nManagement services in any capacity in which Employee served while working\n\nwith Company”—were unreasonable.\n\n      Olson also cites evidence supporting the finding that Sentinel attempted to\n\nenforce the limitations of the non-compete to a greater extent that was necessary to\n\nprotect its business interests.    Sentinel sought to enforce the non-compete\n\nprovision’s general ban on “competing,” including restricting Olson from working\n\nin geographic areas that were not tailored to Olson’s work on behalf of Sentinel or\n\n                                        29\n\feven to Sentinel’s own current business. Sentinel also sought to prevent Olson\n\nfrom working for Mistras, where Olson worked conducting inspections, in spite of\n\nCorey’s assurance in the e-mail that the non-compete did not prevent Olson from\n\nworking turnarounds as an inspector. Corey testified that Sentinel wanted to\n\nprevent Olson from doing work for a competitor “in any capacity” that overlapped\n\nwith managerial duties at Sentinel: “If he became a manager for us, and also that\n\nincluded sweeping the floors at Sentinel, that means that he can’t go to [Mistras]\n\nand sweep the floors, in my opinion. ‘In any capacity,’ is what it says. Now,\n\ninspector, manager, supervisor, dishwasher, it doesn’t matter.”\n\n      We agree that this evidence supports the jury’s factual determination in\n\nQuestion 7. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the finding, we\n\nconclude that there is more than a scintilla of evidence that Corey knew at the time\n\nhe entered into the employment agreement on behalf of Sentinel that the non-\n\ncompete was unnecessarily broad and lacked reasonable limitations and that\n\nSentinel sought to enforce the covenant to a greater extent than necessary to protect\n\nits interests. See City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 810, 822.\n\n      Sentinel, however, cites Corey’s testimony that he obtained the form for the\n\nemployment agreement with the covenant not to compete on the internet, Olson’s\n\ntestimony that he signed the employment agreement of his own free will, and the e-\n\nmail Olson sent to Corey stating that he was happy with the terms and conditions\n\n                                         30\n\fin the employment agreement to support its argument that the evidence was\n\ninsufficient to support the findings here.       Nevertheless, even considering this\n\nevidence, we cannot conclude that the finding was so contrary to the overwhelming\n\nweight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust. See Arias, 265 S.W.3d at\n\n468.\n\n       We conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support the predicate\n\nfindings required by section 15.51(c) to permit an award of attorney’s fees.\n\n       Even in light of the jury’s finding, Sentinel argues that Lazer Spot, Inc. v.\n\nHiring Partners, Inc. prevents an award of attorney’s fees here because, as it\n\nargues in its brief, “the court of appeals expressly held that the new employers of a\n\npromisor under a covenant not to compete with a former employer are not entitled\n\nto recover attorney’s fees.” See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 53 n.24 (Tex. App.—Texarkana\n\n2012, pet. denied) (“Because the express language of the statute does not apply\n\nhere, Lazer Spot is not entitled to attorney’s fees under Section 15.51(c). We find\n\nno authority to support the proposition that a third party, such as Lazer Spot, is\n\nentitled to attorney’s fees pursuant to this section of the statute.”) (internal citations\n\nomitted). However, Lazer Spot is distinguishable because the award of attorney’s\n\nfees here was made to Olson himself, not to Mistras.\n\n       The only other argument that Sentinel advances on appeal opposing the trial\n\ncourt’s determination that Olson was entitled to attorney’s fees is its argument that\n\n                                           31\n\fthe trial court’s error contributed to the attorney’s fees in this case: “Failing to\n\nperform its duty as a matter of law, the trial court committed errors of law that\n\ncontributed to lengthy litigation, and unnecessary increased fees. The trial court\n\nparticipated in and compounded the error resulting in the instant challenged fee\n\naward.” We have already concluded that the trial court did not fail to perform its\n\nduty to reform the covenant not to compete. Although the protracted litigation in\n\nthis case may have served to increase the amount of attorney’s fees incurred,\n\nSentinel, as the plaintiff, was in a better position to resolve the matter than the trial\n\ncourt.\n\n         Thus, Sentinel has failed to show that the trial court abused its discretion in\n\nawarding Olson attorney’s fees.

CODE ANN. § 15.51(c) (allowing promisor, like\n\n\n                                            32\n\fOlson, who has established statutory predicate facts, to recover “the costs,\n\nincluding reasonable attorney’s fees, actually and reasonably incurred by the\n\npromisor in defending the action to enforce the covenant”).\n\n      The issue of the amount of attorney’s fees to be awarded here was a fact\n\nquestion that was submitted to the jury.

El Apple I, Ltd. v. Olivas, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">757</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 762–63\n\n(Tex. 2012). In El Apple, the supreme court stated:\n\n      That proof should include the basic facts underlying the lodestar,\n      which are: (1) the nature of the work, (2) who performed the services\n                                        34\n\f      and their rate, (3) approximately when the services were performed,\n      and (4) the number of hours worked. An attorney could, of course,\n      testify to these details, but in all but the simplest cases, the attorney\n      would probably have to refer to some type of record or documentation\n      to provide this information.\n\nId. at 763. Thus, the supreme court held that, when applying for a fee under the\n\nlodestar method, “the applicant must provide sufficient details of the work\n\nperformed before the court can make a meaningful review of the fee request” and\n\nthat such evidence includes “documentation of the services performed, who\n\nperformed them and at what hourly rate, when they were performed, and how\n\nmuch time the work required.” Id. at 764.\n\n      Here, the record contains a summary of Olson’s attorney’s fees, showing a\n\n“grand total” of $834,750 in fees incurred through the end of trial. This summary\n\nwas supported by approximately 170 pages of redacted bills detailing the services\n\nthat resulted in those fees, including the type of services performed, the amount of\n\ntime expended on each service, the identity of the person who performed them and\n\ntheir billable rates, and the dates the services were performed.        Zavitsanos’s\n\ntestimony on the amount of fees incurred explained and expounded upon the\n\nbillings admitted into the record and the fees incurred as a result of the trial that\n\nhad not yet been billed to Olson.       Zavitsanos further testified, based on his\n\nknowledge of the rates in Harris County and his experience with similar litigation,\n\nthat the fees requested were reasonable and necessary. His testimony detailed the\n\n\n                                         35\n\fwork done on this case, including an emergency injunction hearing, a temporary\n\ninjunction hearing, an interlocutory appeal, extensive discovery, an aborted\n\narbitration, and numerous other motions and pleadings required to defend Olson\n\nagainst Sentinel’s claim that he breached his covenant not to compete. Zavitsanos\n\nopined that at least ninety percent of the work included in total billed amount of\n\n$834,750 was work that either directly related to defending Olson on the non-\n\ncompete claim or was so intertwined that it could not be separated. The jury\n\nawarded Olson almost ninety percent of the total billing.\n\n      Sentinel argues that “the evidence establishes the sum of $271,384.75 in\n\nattorneys, paralegals, secretaries and others’ fees were billed from the inception of\n\nthe case until just after the trial court’s four day temporary injunction hearing\n\nregarding the covenant not to compete.”        However, Zavitsanos’s uncontested\n\ntestimony established that numerous legal proceedings occurred following the\n\ntemporary injunction hearing in which Olson incurred attorney’s fees in defending\n\nagainst Sentinel’s claim that he breached the non-compete, including an\n\ninterlocutory appeal of the trial court’s denial of the temporary injunction,\n\nSentinel’s attempt to pursue arbitration against Olson, and a three-and-a-half-week\n\ntrial. Other than this argument, Sentinel does not contest the reasonableness of\n\nOlson’s attorney’s rates or the amount of time spent on representing Olson.\n\n\n\n\n                                         36\n\f      We conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury’s award of\n\n$750,000 in attorney’s fees to Olson.\n\n      We overrule Sentinel’s third issue.\n\nD.    Segregation of Fees\n\n      In its fourth issue, Sentinel argues that the trial court erred in awarding\n\n$750,000 in attorney’s fees because the fees were not segregated.\n\n      Because attorney’s fees are only recoverable pursuant to a contract or\n\nstatute, “fee claimants have always been required to segregate fees between claims\n\nfor which they are recoverable and claims for which they are not.” Tony Gullo\n\nMotors I, L.P. v. Chapa, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 311 (Tex. 2006) (citing Aiello, 941\n\nS.W.2d at 73). However, the supreme court has recognized a narrow exception\n\n“when discrete legal services advanced both a recoverable and unrecoverable\n\nclaim” and thus “are so intertwined that they need not be segregated.” Id. at 313–\n\n14. The court stated:\n\n      This standard does not require more precise proof for attorney’s fees\n      than for any other claims or expenses. Here, Chapa’s attorneys did\n      not have to keep separate time records when they drafted the fraud,\n      contract, or DTPA paragraphs of her petition; an opinion would have\n      sufficed stating that, for example, 95 percent of their drafting time\n      would have been necessary even if there had been no fraud claim.\n      The court of appeals could then have applied standard factual and\n      legal sufficiency review to the jury’s verdict based on that evidence.”\n\nId. at 314.\n\n\n\n                                        37\n\f      Here, Zavitsanos testified that the amount included in the summary and\n\nsupporting bills introduced at trial did not include every fee and expense incurred\n\nin the course of trial. For example, Zavitsanos testified that Carey Roberts, one of\n\nthe other defendants in this case, was “swallowing” his attorney’s fees because\n\nthere was no valid legal basis for him to request them from the court. Zavitsanos\n\nfurther testified that the amounts sought by Olson were all for work related directly\n\nto defending against Sentinel’s claim that he breached the covenant not to compete\n\nor for work that was intertwined with that claim. Zavitsanos opined that, of the\n\nwork presented in the billing admitted at trial, “at least” ninety percent of it was\n\nnecessary in defending Olson against Sentinel’s claim for breach of the covenant\n\nnot to compete.\n\n      On appeal, Sentinel does not identify any specific amount of time or items of\n\nwork that were included in the fees requested by Olson that were attributable only\n\nto non-recoverable legal fees, aside from its general allegation that “[t]here is no\n\nevidence discre[te] legal services promoted both the defense of the tortious\n\ninterference claims against Mistras, as well as the claim for attorney fees to reform\n\nthe non-compete agreement.” As indicated above, Zavitsanos’s testimony is some\n\nevidence that numerous, discrete legal services either related directly to the claim\n\nagainst Olson or were intertwined with that claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                         38\n\f      Thus, we conclude that Olson’s evidence supporting his attorney’s fees was\n\nsufficiently segregated. See id. at 313–14. We have already concluded that the\n\nevidence was sufficient to support the jury’s award. See id. at 314.\n\n      We overrule Sentinel’s fourth issue.\n\nE.    Conditional Appellate Fees\n\n      In its fifth issue, Sentinel argues that the trial court erred in awarding Olson\n\nconditional appellate attorney’s fees because there was “no evidence that such fees\n\nwere or have been actually and reasonably incurred.”\n\n      We read the trial court’s judgment as awarding appellate attorney’s fees only\n\nafter the expense is incurred as a result of Sentinel’s unsuccessful appeal. We\n\ntherefore reject Sentinel’s position and conclude that the record demonstrates,\n\nbased on Zavitsanos’s testimony, that Olson did incur attorney’s fees in defending\n\nagainst Sentinel’s unsuccessful appeal to this Court. See Law Offices of Windle\n\nTurley, P.C. v. French, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1442844\"><a href=\"/opinion/1442844/law-offices-of-windle-turley-v-french/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">487</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 493 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2005, no pet.)\n\n(rejecting argument that conditional appellate attorney’s fees had not been\n\n“incurred” as required by Civil Practice and Remedies Code for award of\n\nattorney’s fees). However, pursuant to the supreme court’s holding in El Apple,\n\nwe conclude that the record on appeal does not, at this time, contain sufficient\n\nevidence supporting the amount of attorney’s fees incurred by Olson on appeal.\n\nSee 370 S.W.3d at 764 (“For purposes of lodestar calculations, [evidence\n\n\n                                         39\n\fsupporting a request for attorney’s fees] includes, at a minimum, documentation of\n\nthe services performed, who performed them and at what hourly rate, when they\n\nwere performed, and how much time the work required.”). The only evidence\n\nsupporting the award of appellate attorney’s fees was Zavitsanos’s very general\n\ntestimony that Olson would incur about $150,000 in fees if the case were appealed\n\nto this Court and an additional $50,000 in fees in the event of an appeal to the\n\nTexas Supreme Court.\n\n      Accordingly, we sustain part of Sentinel’s fifth issue and remand for the trial\n\ncourt to adjust the amount of appellate attorney’s fees awarded to conform to the\n\napplicable lodestar calculations.\n\nF.    Pre-judgment Interest on Attorney’s Fees\n\n      In its sixth issue, Sentinel argues that the trial court erred in granting pre-\n\njudgment interest on attorney’s fees.\n\n      Sentinel first argues that award of pre-judgment interest on the attorney’s\n\nfees was improper because section 15.52 preempts any other provisions or law that\n\nmight entitle Olson to relief. Olson does not address the preemption issue at all.\n\nHowever, the statute permits recovery of “the costs, including reasonable\n\nattorney’s fees, actually and reasonably incurred by the promisor in defending the\n\naction to enforce the covenant.”        TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. § 15.51(c)\n\n(emphasis added). The purpose of pre-judgment interest is to compensate a party\n\n\n                                          40\n\ffor the lost use of money due as damages during the lapse of time between the\n\naccrual of the claim and the date of the judgment.

Texan Land\n\n& Cattle Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1449435\"><a href=\"/opinion/1449435/city-of-houston-v-texan-land-and-cattle-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">382</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 388 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2004, no\n\npet.). While the lost use of the money paid as attorney’s fees might, in some\n\ncircumstances, be considered a cost incurred in defending the action to enforce the\n\ncovenant under section 15.51, that does not appear to be the situation here. Olson\n\ndid not pay the attorney’s fees, so he did not incur any costs in the form of lost use\n\nof the money paid in attorney’s fees on his behalf by Mistras.\n\n      Thus, we conclude under the facts of this case, that the award of pre-\n\njudgment interest on the attorney’s fees that had already been paid on Olson’s\n\nbehalf do not fall under the permitted statutory recovery. See TEX. BUS. & COM.\n\nCODE ANN. § 15.51(c). This court and others have held that the Covenants Not to\n\nCompete Act preempts “any other . . . procedures and remedies,” including the\n\ncommon law.
