First,\n\nwe must address whether a single detachment petition and a\n\nsingle vote on that petition, pursuant to the terms of the\n\nHome       Rule   City   Act,   MCL   117.1   et    seq.,    may   encompass\n\nterritory to be detached from one city and added to more\n\nthan one township.1         Second, if a single detachment petition\n\nand a single vote may encompass territory to be added to\n\nmore than one township, we must determine whether a writ of\n\nmandamus compels the Secretary of State to issue a notice\n\ndirecting an election on the change of boundaries sought by\n\nplaintiffs in each case.          Because we conclude that the Home\n\nRule City Act does not allow a single detachment petition\n\nand a single vote on detachment for adding territory to\n\nmultiple townships, mandamus is not proper in these cases.\n\nAccordingly,       the   decisions    of    the    Court    of   Appeals   are\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n       1\n       While the Home Rule City Act, MCL 117.1 et seq.,\naddresses various processes, the issue before this Court\npertains solely to the process of detachment.\n\n\n\n                                       2\n\n\f              I. STATEMENT OF FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n\n                   Casco Twp v Secretary of State\n\n      Plaintiffs in this case are two adjacent townships—\n\nCasco Township and Columbus Township—and residents of those\n\ntownships who seek to detach territory from defendant city\n\nof   Richmond.      The    territory     sought    to    be     detached    is\n\nterritory   that    was    previously     annexed       to    the   city   of\n\nRichmond.\n\n      Plaintiffs seek to present the ballot issue covering\n\nboth townships in a single petition.              This would result in\n\na single vote about whether to detach territory from the\n\ncity of Richmond and add the territory to Casco Township\n\nand Columbus Township.       The residents of one township would\n\nbe voting on the return of property to their township, as\n\nwell as the return of property to a township in which they\n\ndo not reside.       The Secretary of State refused to approve\n\nan election on plaintiffs’ petition because an election on\n\nthe petition would allow residents of one township to vote\n\non, and possibly determine, a change in the boundaries of\n\nanother township in which they do not reside.\n\n      Plaintiffs     filed    a     complaint      for        mandamus     and\n\ndeclaratory      relief.          The    circuit        court       dismissed\n\nplaintiffs’ complaint for mandamus to compel the Secretary\n\nof State to act because it was not clear that a single\n\n\n                                    3\n\n\fpetition seeking detachment from a city and addition of the\n\nterritory to two townships was permitted by the Home Rule\n\nCity Act.        The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of\n\nthe circuit court.              Casco Twp v Secretary of State, 261\n\nMich App 386; 682 NW2d 546 (2004).                     We granted plaintiffs’\n\napplication for leave to appeal and ordered that the case\n\nbe argued and submitted with Fillmore Twp v Secretary of\n\nState, 471 Mich 890 (2004).\n\n                  Fillmore Twp v Secretary of State\n\n       Plaintiffs    are        Fillmore       Township   and    electors      from\n\nfour townships—Fillmore Township, Holland Charter Township,\n\nPark    Township,        and    Laketown        Township-and     the    city    of\n\nHolland    who    want     to    detach    territory      from    the    city   of\n\nHolland    and     add    the     territory       to    the   four     townships.\n\nPlaintiffs       filed    a     joint   detachment        petition      with    the\n\nSecretary of State, asking that the petition be certified\n\nand that a single election be held regarding the territory\n\nthat was proposed to be detached from the city of Holland.\n\nThe    Secretary    of    State     refused       to   certify    the   petition\n\nbecause the petition involved an effort to detach territory\n\nfor addition to more than one township.\n\n       Plaintiffs filed a complaint for mandamus in the Court\n\nof Appeals, and the complaint was held in abeyance pending\n\nthe decision in the Casco Twp case.                       Unpublished order,\n\n\n                                          4\n\n\fentered      May     19,       2003    (Docket        No.    245640).         Plaintiffs’\n\ncomplaint was subsequently denied by the Court of Appeals\n\non the basis of the Casco Twp decision.                             Unpublished order,\n\nentered      May     6,    2004       (Docket         No.    245640).         We     granted\n\nplaintiffs’         application            for    leave      to   appeal     and     ordered\n\nthat the case be argued and submitted with the Casco Twp\n\ncase.       471 Mich 890 (2004).2\n\n                               II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        The proper interpretation of a statutory provision is\n\na question of law that this Court reviews de novo.                                   Lincoln\n\nv   Gen     Motors    Corp,          461    Mich      483,    489-490;       607    NW2d    73\n\n(2000).         A   trial       court’s          decision     regarding       a     writ   of\n\nmandamus is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.                                   In re MCI\n\nTelecom Complaint, 460 Mich 396, 443; 596 NW2d 164 (1999).\n\n                                      III. ANALYSIS\n\n        These       cases            involve          an     issue      of         statutory\n\ninterpretation.                The         primary           goal       of         statutory\n\ninterpretation            is    to    give       effect      to   the   intent       of    the\n\nLegislature.         Id. at 411.             The first step is to review the\n\n\n        2\n       Justice Young states that the majority “fails to\nconvey adequately the true character of the boundary\ndisputes at issue.” Post at 4. Yet the relevant facts are\nconveyed, and it is of no import if the history of these\ncases was contentious or of a calculated nature.      The\nstatutory analysis is the same whether the parties were\nfriends, foes, or something in between.\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\n\flanguage of the statute.                       If the statutory language is\n\nunambiguous, the Legislature is presumed to have intended\n\nthe    meaning           expressed        in        the    statute        and        judicial\n\nconstruction is not permissible.\n\n       The Home Rule City Act, MCL 117.1 et seq., addresses\n\nfour       processes—incorporation,                  consolidation,            annexation,\n\nand detachment.3              The issue before this Court pertains only\n\nto    the    process          of    detachment.            Detachment          means     that\n\nterritory is taken from an existing city and added to an\n\nexisting township.\n\n       Section       6       of    the   Home       Rule   City    Act,        MCL     117.6,\n\nprovides      that       a    detachment        be    initiated      by    “proceedings\n\noriginating      by          petition      therefor         signed        by     qualified\n\nelectors who are freeholders residing within the cities,\n\nvillages, or townships to be affected thereby . . . .”\n\n(Emphasis      added.)              Notably,         MCL   117.8     and       MCL    117.11\n\ndelineate the procedure for submitting a petition for a\n\nchange of boundaries.                    MCL 117.8(1) provides in relevant\n\npart that “the board shall, by resolution, provide that the\n\nquestion        of           making        the         proposed        incorporation,\n\nconsolidation, or change of boundaries be submitted to the\n\nqualified electors of the district to be affected at the\n\n       3\n       Recent amendments to the act do not affect the issue\nin this case.\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\n\fnext general election or at a special election before the\n\nnext general election.”               (Emphasis added.)                Likewise, MCL\n\n117.11(2)    provides          that    “the        question       of        making    the\n\nincorporation,          consolidation,           or     change        of     boundaries\n\npetitioned for shall be submitted to the electors of the\n\ndistrict    to    be    affected.”           (Emphasis         added.)         Michigan\n\nelection law defines a qualified elector as “any person who\n\npossesses the qualifications of an elector as prescribed in\n\nsection 1 of article 2 of the state constitution and who\n\nhas resided in the city or township 30 days.”4                             MCL 168.10.\n\n     Because          Casco    Township          voters    do     not        reside    in\n\nColumbus    Township,         they    are    not       “qualified      electors”       of\n\nColumbus Township who can sign a petition and vote on the\n\ndetachment       of    territory      from       the    city     of    Richmond       for\n\naddition of the territory to Columbus Township.                               Likewise,\n\nbecause Columbus Township voters do not reside in Casco\n\n\n     4\n         Const 1963, art 2, § 1 provides the following:\n\n          Every citizen of the United States who has\n     attained the age of 21 years, who has resided in\n     this state six months, and who meets the\n     requirements of local residence provided by law,\n     shall be an elector and qualified to vote in any\n     election except as otherwise provided in this\n     constitution.     The legislature shall define\n     residence for voting purposes.\n\n     Pursuant to US Const, Am XVI, the minimum voting age\nis now eighteen years.\n\n\n\n                                            7\n\n\fTownship,         they        are     not     “qualified        electors”        of       Casco\n\nTownship who can sign a petition and vote on the detachment\n\nof territory from the city of Richmond for addition of the\n\nterritory to Casco Township.                          Therefore, a single petition\n\nand    a    single        vote      on     multiple      detachments       violate          the\n\nstatutory language of the Home Rule City Act.\n\n       Additional support for this position is found in the\n\nstatutory language used in other parts of the Home Rule\n\nCity       Act.         MCL     117.9(1)         defines       the    “district        to     be\n\naffected” as the following:                       “The district to be affected\n\nby    every       such        proposed      incorporation,           consolidation,          or\n\nchange of boundaries shall be deemed to include the whole\n\nof each city, village, or township from which territory is\n\nto    be    taken        or    to     which      territory      is    to   be    annexed.”\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n       A change of boundaries for the district to be affected\n\nencompasses            only     one       city    and    one    township        because       a\n\ntownship’s             voters       can     be    qualified          electors        only     in\n\nrelation          to     their       own      township’s        proposed        change        of\n\nboundaries and are affected only by their own township’s\n\nproposed      change           of    boundaries.           Therefore,       it       is     only\n\nplausible that the “district to be affected” encompasses\n\none    city        and        one     township.            Accordingly,          a     single\n\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\n\fdetachment petition and a single vote may only encompass\n\nterritory to be added to one township.5\n\n     Language in MCL 117.13, which sets forth the procedure\n\nfollowing an election, further supports the principle that\n\neach township is considered a separate entity and there\n\nmust be separate votes with respect to the territory to be\n\ndetached from one city and added to each township.                 MCL\n\n117.13    states,   “Territory   detached    from   any   city   shall\n\nthereupon become a part of the township or village from\n\nwhich it was originally taken . . . .”         This indicates that\n\nthe “district to be affected” is limited to the city in\n\nwhich the territory is located and the single township that\n\nseeks the return of the territory.\n\n     Further, interpreting the “district to be affected” in\n\ndetachment proceedings as the city from which the territory\n\nis to be detached and the township to which the territory\n\nis   to   be   added   recognizes     that   the    consequences    of\n\ndetachment may be quite different for each township that\n\n     5\n       Other jurisdictions have held similarly. See, e.g.,\nCity of Lake Wales v Florida Citrus Canners Coop, 191 So 2d\n453, 457 (Fla App, 1966) (A qualified elector in area 1\ncannot vote for the annexation in area 2 because the area 1\nvoter is not within the territory affected.); People ex rel\nSmith v City of San Jose, 100 Cal App 2d 57, 60; 222 P2d\n947 (1950) (An annexation election was improperly held\nbecause voters had to vote for the annexation of two\nparcels and could not vote separately for the annexation of\neach parcel.).\n\n\n\n                                 9\n\n\fseeks to gain property.             For example, property rights and\n\nliabilities    must    be     adjusted      between    the    city    and      the\n\ntownship when there is a detachment.                   MCL 123.1.          Debts\n\nmust be apportioned and land may need to be sold.                              MCL\n\n123.2; MCL 123.3.          The potential for dramatically different\n\nconsequences    of    detachment      are    clearly    indicated         in   the\n\nFillmore Twp case.         Four townships seek to detach land from\n\nthe city of Holland.         The Fillmore Township parcel is 1,054\n\nacres, the Holland Charter Township parcel is 3.33 acres,\n\nthe Park Township parcel is 1.27 acres, and the Laketown\n\nTownship    parcel    is     0.77    acres.      It    is     reasonable        to\n\nconclude    that     the    effect    of    detachment       will    be    quite\n\ndifferent when one parcel is 1,054 acres and one parcel is\n\na mere 0.77 acres.\n\n     Moreover, allowing a single petition and a single vote\n\non detachment from one city for the addition of territory\n\nto multiple townships does not allow voters to render a\n\nvote in support of the addition of territory to only one\n\ntownship.      MCL 168.643a requires, in relevant part, the\n\nfollowing:\n\n          A question submitted to the electors of this\n     state or the electors of a subdivision of this\n     state shall, to the extent that it will not\n     confuse the electorate, be worded so that a “yes”\n     vote will be a vote in favor of the subject\n     matter of the proposal or issue and a “no” vote\n\n\n\n                                      10\n\n\f       will be a vote against the subject matter of the\n       proposal or issue.\n\n       However, a single vote on detaching territory from one\n\ncity and adding the territory to multiple townships does\n\nnot allow a voter who may only favor one of the multiple\n\nadditions of territory to cast a “yes” vote.                       As stated by\n\nthis Court in Muskegon Pub Schools v Vander Laan, 211 Mich\n\n85, 87; 178 NW 424 (1920), “Separate subjects, separate\n\npurposes,      or      independent           propositions     should    not   be\n\ncombined so that one may gather votes for the other.”                         In\n\nVander Laan, this Court noted that the erection of three\n\nnew school buildings showed a common purpose and were part\n\nof a comprehensive plan to meet the educational needs of\n\nthe city.       In contrast, we find that detaching territory\n\nfrom    one     city      and     adding      the      territory   to   multiple\n\ntownships does not indicate a common purpose because the\n\nneeds    and     consequences           of       the   additions   to   various\n\ntownships      may       differ    remarkably.             Combining    multiple\n\nadditions of territory in a single detachment petition so\n\nthat    there       is    only      a    single        vote   indeed    combines\n\nindependent propositions “so that one may gather votes for\n\nthe other.”\n\n       When put into context, the text of the Home Rule City\n\nAct is unambiguous—a petition and a vote about detachment\n\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\n\fmust involve only one city and one township.                                    A contrary\n\nreading    of     the     statutory         language       belies      the      fact     that\n\nthere will always be two parties to a detachment—the city\n\nand the township.             Justice Young’s focus on the word “each”\n\nin the statute ignores that the provisions must be read in\n\ncontext.         Interpreting          the    word     “each”         to    mean   that     a\n\ndetachment petition can encompass more than one township is\n\ncontrary     to        the        statutory        language      that          relates      to\n\nqualified electors and ignores the fact that the Home Rule\n\nCity       Act      encompasses               four        distinct             procedures–\n\nincorporation,          consolidation,             annexation,        and      detachment.\n\nLanguage     in     the      statute        that     at    first       may      appear      to\n\nindicate     that       multiple       townships          may   be     involved        in   a\n\nsingle detachment petition and a single vote must be read\n\nin context and in consideration of the statutory language\n\nregarding qualified electors.                      Significantly, residents of\n\none township are not qualified electors in a detachment\n\nproceeding        when       it     comes     to     determining           a    change      of\n\nboundaries       for     another      township,        and      the    statute      cannot\n\nproperly be interpreted in this manner.6\n\n\n\n       6\n       This is consistent with principles espoused in past\ncases from this Court.    See, e.g., Robertson v Baxter, 57\nMich 127, 129; 23 NW 711 (1885) (“No person not living in\nthe township has any voice in its affairs.”).\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\n\f      Further,       Justice      Young’s      reliance     on    this   Court’s\n\ndecision in Walsh v Secretary of State, 355 Mich 570, 574;\n\n95   NW2d    511     (1959),      is   misplaced.           Walsh    dealt       with\n\nannexation,       not      detachment.         Notably,     in   the   multiple­\n\ntownship annexation at issue in Walsh, the votes of each\n\nterritory were considered separately.                   In essence, a single\n\ntownship could “veto” the annexation from taking place, no\n\nmatter how many voters approved of the annexation in other\n\ntownships.          In contrast, in the detachment procedure at\n\nissue in these cases, the voters in a township have no\n\n“veto”    power.          The   wishes    of    an    entire     township     could\n\neffectively be ignored because voters in other townships\n\nbelieve that a detachment would be in their best interests.\n\nThe “package” proposal in Walsh is hardly analogous to the\n\ndetachment proceedings at issue in these cases.\n\n      Our conclusion that a single detachment petition and a\n\nsingle vote on that petition may only encompass territory\n\nto   be     added    to     one   township       is    in   accord     with      the\n\nunambiguous statutory language.                  Thus, the Legislature is\n\npresumed     to     have    intended     the    meaning     expressed       in   the\n\nstatute and judicial construction is not permissible.\n\n      Finally, a writ of mandamus could be properly issued\n\nin these cases only if plaintiffs proved that (1) they had\n\na clear legal right to the performance of the specific duty\n\n\n                                         13\n\n\fthat they sought to be compelled, and (2) the Secretary of\n\nState had a clear legal duty to perform the act.                         In re\n\nMCI, supra at 442-443.      Because the Home Rule City Act does\n\nnot allow a single detachment petition and a single vote on\n\nthat petition to encompass territory to be detached from\n\none city and added to more than one township, there was no\n\nclear legal right to have the Secretary of State authorize\n\neach petition for a single vote.                  Therefore, there was no\n\nclear legal duty that required the Secretary of State to\n\nact, and the writs of mandamus were properly denied in both\n\ncases before this Court.\n\n                           IV. CONCLUSION\n\n     The Home Rule City Act, MCL 117.1 et seq., does not\n\nallow a single petition and a single vote to encompass\n\ndetachment of territory from a city for the addition of\n\nthat territory to multiple townships; thus, the Secretary\n\nof   State   did   not    have    a     clear       legal    duty   to     act.\n\nTherefore,     mandamus    was    not        an      appropriate     remedy.\n\nAccordingly,    the   decisions       of    the    Court    of   Appeals   are\n\naffirmed.\n\n                                       Michael F.

(concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n\n       We granted leave to appeal in these consolidated cases\n\nto determine whether (1) the Home Rule City Act (HRCA)1\n\npermits          the   use    of    a     single    detachment      petition      and\n\nelection when the territory to be detached from a city is\n\nto be transferred to more than one township and, (2) if\n\nsuch       a     procedure    is     allowed       under    the    HRCA,     whether\n\nplaintiffs2 are entitled to mandamus relief.                        I agree with\n\nthe majority that plaintiffs are not entitled to writs of\n\nmandamus because I believe that any request for mandamus\n\nrelief is premature at this time.                          I disagree, however,\n\nwith       the    majority’s       conclusion      that     the   HRCA     does   not\n\npermit the use of a single detachment petition and vote\n\nthereon when transferring land to multiple townships.\n\n       The        Legislature       was    well    aware     of    the     political\n\ngamesmanship           that   occurs       between    municipalities         in   the\n\ncontext of boundary disputes.                    Indeed, our Constitution was\n\nchanged          to    free   the       Legislature    from       this     political\n\n\n\n\n       1\n           MCL 117.1 et seq.\n       2\n       Unless otherwise indicated, “plaintiffs” will be used\nto refer collectively to the plaintiffs in both of the\ncases that were consolidated. Similarly, “defendants” will\nbe used to refer to the defendants in both cases\ncollectively, unless otherwise noted.\n\n\n\n                                            2\n\n\fquagmire.3           By   enacting      the        HRCA,       the     Legislature\n\nestablished     a    standardized       procedure         to    effectuate        such\n\nchanges in a manner that it viewed as fair and reasonable.\n\nA   plain    reading      of   all    relevant      language         in    the    HRCA\n\ndemonstrates that the use of a single detachment petition\n\nwhen transferring land to multiple townships is permitted.\n\nThe Court of Appeals focused only on select text in the\n\nHRCA and thereby gave the statute a particular meaning that\n\nis insupportable when one considers all the language used\n\nby the Legislature in the HRCA.                   Its exercise in selective\n\nstatutory      interpretation           not        only         undermines         the\n\nLegislature’s intent in passing the HRCA, but also injects\n\nthe   judiciary—armed          only    with       ill-defined          notions      of\n\n“fairness”     and    “justice”—as      a     referee      in    the      inherently\n\npolitical, contentious, and tactical process of altering\n\nmunicipal boundaries. The majority opinion, while avoiding\n\nexplicit reliance on extra-textual policy justifications,\n\ndoes not, in my view, give full meaning to all the relevant\n\nwords in the statute.\n\n      Accordingly,         I    respectfully            dissent           from     the\n\nmajority’s     conclusion       that    a     single    detachment          petition\n\ninvolving     multiple     townships         is   not   permitted         under   the\n\n\n      3\n          See the discussion in part III(A)(1) of this opinion.\n\n\n\n                                        3\n\n\fHRCA.       In Casco Twp, I would grant the plaintiffs’ request\n\nfor declaratory relief and deny their claim for a writ of\n\nmandamus.       In Fillmore Twp, because the plaintiffs only\n\nsought a writ of mandamus, I would deny entirely their\n\nrequest for relief.\n\n                           I. FACTS   AND       PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n        The   majority     fails    to          convey     adequately           the       true\n\ncharacter of the boundary disputes at issue.                                 By glossing\n\nover much of the relevant history, the majority understates\n\nthe     inherently    political       and           calculated         nature       of    the\n\ndisputes.4\n\n                           A. CASCO TWP         V   SECRETARY   OF   STATE\n\n        The land at issue in this case has a long, contentious\n\nhistory.       In July 1996, intervening defendants, Walter and\n\nPatricia Winkle, filed a petition with the State Boundary\n\nCommission (SBC) seeking to annex to the city of Richmond\n\napproximately        157    acres     of        land     that        they     and        other\n\n\n        4\n        Contrary to the majority's assertion, I do not\ncontend that the factual background of these cases should\nalter the statutory analysis. Ante at 5 n 2.    Instead, I\nsimply point out that the majority opinion, in my view,\ninadequately describes the true tactical and strategic\ncharacter of these ongoing territorial disputes. Moreover,\nthe lower courts clearly believed that the ability of\nvillages and townships to use the HRCA to their advantage\nwas unfair.      Providing the full history of these\nterritorial disputes helps to reveal the lower courts’\npolicy views.\n\n\n\n                                           4\n\n\fresidents owned in Casco Township and Columbus Township.\n\nThe Winkles hoped to develop their land for commercial use,\n\nbut believed that commercial development could not occur\n\nunless their property was connected to the water and sewer\n\nlines offered by the city of Richmond.\n\n      Before       the   Winkles’        July       1996    petition,       however,\n\nColumbus     Township       and    neighboring             Lenox    Township       had\n\nentered     into    an    agreement       pursuant         to   1984   PA    425    to\n\ntransfer land from Columbus Township to Lenox Township.5                             A\n\nsimilar 425 agreement was reached between Casco Township\n\nand Lenox Township.             These 425 agreements were designed to\n\nprevent future annexations, such as the one initiated by\n\nthe   Winkles      in    July    1996.         In   November       1997,    the    SBC\n\ndetermined that the 425 agreements were invalid and decided\n\ninstead to approve the annexation petition filed by the\n\nWinkles.6      After protracted litigation, the SBC’s decision\n\nwas eventually upheld by the Court of Appeals.7                            The Court\n\n\n      5\n       1984 PA 425 provides a detailed mechanism by which\nmunicipal entities may transfer land to one another by\ncontract. MCL 124.21      et seq. Such intergovernmental\ntransfers are commonly referred to as “425 agreements.”\n      6\n       A referendum is not required for an annexation if the\nterritory to be affected includes one hundred or fewer\nresidents. MCL 117.9(4).\n      7\n       Casco Twp v State Boundary Comm, 243 Mich App 392;\n622 NW2d 332 (2000).\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\n\fof   Appeals        found   that   the        425    agreements    between     the\n\ntownships of Columbus, Casco, and Lenox were “sham[s]” and\n\n“essentially an attempt to avoid annexation,” and upheld\n\nthe SBC’s decision approving the annexation initiated by\n\nthe Winkles.8          In July 2001, this Court denied leave to\n\nappeal.9\n\n      In December 2001, plaintiffs filed a single detachment\n\npetition with the Secretary of State, seeking to transfer\n\nfrom the city of Richmond to Casco Township and Columbus\n\nTownship      the    same   land   that       was     involved    in   the   prior\n\nannexation.10            The   disputed             territory     consisted     of\n\n\n      8\n           Id. at 402.\n      9\n           465 Mich 855 (2001).\n      10\n        Under the HRCA, a detachment petition is normally\nsubmitted to the county for certification.       MCL 117.6\nHowever, if the territory to be affected is situated in\nmore than one county, certification must be sought from the\nSecretary of State.     At the time that plaintiffs filed\ntheir petitions, § 11 of the HRCA provided:\n\n           When the territory to be affected by any\n      proposed incorporation, consolidation or change\n      is situated in more than 1 county the petition\n      hereinbefore provided shall be addressed and\n      presented to the secretary of state . . . . [MCL\n      117.11.]\n\nBecause the city of Richmond is located in both St. Clair\nCounty and Macomb County, the plaintiffs filed the\ndetachment petition with the Secretary of State pursuant to\n§ 11.\n\n\n\n\n                                         6\n\n\fapproximately          eighty-seven         acres       in    Casco   Township    and\n\nseventy acres in Columbus Township.\n\n       Unsure whether the HRCA permitted the use of a single\n\ndetachment petition to transfer land to multiple townships,\n\nthe Secretary of State requested an official opinion from\n\nthe    Attorney        General     interpreting           the     HRCA.     Citing    a\n\npending       lawsuit    in     Eaton       County,      Michigan,        involving   a\n\nfactually       similar        dispute,11         and   the     Attorney    General’s\n\npolicy of declining to issue opinions that might affect\n\nongoing litigation, the Attorney General refused to issue a\n\nformal opinion construing the HRCA.                       However, in a May 2002\n\nmemorandum to the Department of State, Bureau of Elections,\n\nthe Attorney General's Office provided “informal advice”\n\nregarding        the     use     of     a    single          detachment     petition.\n\nRecognizing that there were “no cases directly on point\n\nthat        specifically       address       the        issue,”     the    memorandum\n\ninformed the Department of State that it was “reasonable to\n\n       11\n        In City of Eaton Rapids v Eaton Co Bd of Comm'rs,\n(Eaton Circuit Court, Docket No. 02-235-AZ 2002), residents\nof Eaton Rapids Township and Hamlin Township filed a single\ndetachment petition to detach land from the city of Eaton\nRapids.   Unlike the present case, however, the territory\ninvolved in Eaton Rapids was situated in only one county,\nthus eliminating the need for involvement by the Secretary\nof State. In Eaton Rapids, the trial court upheld the use\nof a single detachment petition.      The Court of Appeals\nsubsequently denied leave to appeal in an unpublished\norder, entered April 16, 2002. (Docket No. 240215).\n\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\n\frefuse to certify” the petition.12                 The Secretary of State\n\nsubsequently    notified      the    plaintiffs          that      she     would   not\n\ncertify the detachment petition.\n\n     The following month, the plaintiffs filed a complaint\n\nin   the   Ingham     Circuit       Court,       seeking        declaratory        and\n\nmandamus relief against the defendants.                         After holding a\n\nhearing, the circuit court denied the plaintiffs’ request\n\nfor mandamus relief, ruling that the HRCA was not “patently\n\nclear” regarding whether a single detachment petition may\n\nbe used to transfer land to more than one township.                                The\n\ncircuit    court      then   dismissed           the     plaintiffs’          lawsuit\n\nwithout    having     addressed      their       request        for      declaratory\n\nrelief.\n\n     The    plaintiffs       appealed       to    the        Court    of      Appeals,\n\nclaiming   that     the   circuit     court       erred       in     denying    their\n\nrequest for mandamus relief and in dismissing their lawsuit\n\nwithout deciding their request for declaratory relief.                              In\n\ndivided    opinions,      the    Court       of        Appeals       affirmed      the\n\njudgment   of   the    circuit      court.13           The    Court      of    Appeals\n\nmajority held that the HRCA was ambiguous as to whether a\n\n     12\n       Memorandum from the Attorney General's Office to the\nDepartment of State, Bureau of Elections (May 14, 2002).\n     13\n        Casco Twp v Secretary of State, 261 Mich App 386;\n682 NW2d 546 (2004).\n\n\n\n\n                                       8\n\n\fsingle     detachment    petition         was    permitted.         Given       the\n\nambiguity, the majority decided that it “must consider the\n\nobject of the statute and apply a reasonable construction\n\nthat is logical and best accomplishes the HRCA’s purpose.”14\n\n      Acknowledging      that      there        was   “no    case       law    that\n\ndirectly addresse[d] the current situation,”15 the majority\n\nconcluded that it was “clearly unfair” to allow the use of\n\na   single    detachment     petition         when    transferring       land   to\n\nmultiple townships.16           Accordingly, the Court of Appeals\n\ndenied the plaintiffs’ request for mandamus relief.                             The\n\nCourt of Appeals further held that the circuit court had\n\n“implicitly” denied the plaintiffs’ request for declaratory\n\nrelief     and   affirmed    the    circuit       court’s     ruling      denying\n\ndeclaratory      relief.17         The    dissent      disagreed        with    the\n\nmajority’s conclusion that the HRCA was ambiguous and noted\n\nthat the plain text of the HRCA permitted the use of a\n\nsingle     detachment    petition        to   transfer      land   to    multiple\n\n\n\n\n      14\n           Id. at 392-393.\n      15\n           Id. at 393.\n      16\n           Id. at 394.\n      17\n           Id. at 395.\n\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\n\ftownships.     We granted leave to appeal and consolidated the\n\ncase with Fillmore Twp v Secretary of State.18\n\n                             B. FILLMORE TWP         V   SECRETARY   OF   STATE\n\n      As with the territory involved in the companion case\n\nof Casco Twp v Secretary of State, the disputed territory\n\nin this case also has a complex history.                             In 1997, Fillmore\n\nTownship     and    the       city       of     Holland        entered          into     a    425\n\nagreement through which land in Fillmore Township was to be\n\ntransferred        to    Holland.               Pursuant        to        the      referendum\n\nprovision in 1984 PA 425, qualified electors in Fillmore\n\nTownship filed a petition calling for a referendum on the\n\n425   agreement         with       the    city        of    Holland.              The    voters\n\nultimately defeated the 425 agreement in the referendum.\n\n      Several months after the 425 agreement was defeated,\n\nin    late    1998,      landowners             in       Fillmore         Township           filed\n\npetitions with the SBC to annex approximately 1,100 acres\n\nto the city of Holland.                   The SBC approved the annexation,\n\nthereby      transferring            approximately              1,100           acres        from\n\nFillmore     Township         to    Holland.               Seeking        to    reverse       the\n\nannexation     effected         by       the    SBC’s        decision,          in      February\n\n2000, electors in Fillmore Township filed a petition with\n\nthe   Secretary         of     State      to         detach    the        land       that     was\n\n\n      18\n           471 Mich 890 (2004).\n\n\n\n                                               10\n\n\fpreviously annexed.             In August 2000, voters in Fillmore and\n\nHolland defeated the detachment proposal by a vote of 3,917\n\nto 2,614.\n\n     In    October       2002,       the    plaintiffs      submitted        a    single\n\ndetachment       petition       to    the     Secretary         of   State,19      again\n\nhoping to detach from the city of Holland the territory\n\nthat was previously annexed from Fillmore Township.                                   In\n\naddition        to     the      Fillmore          Township-city         of       Holland\n\ndetachment,          however,      the     petition        also      included      three\n\nsmaller detachments by which land would be detached from\n\nthe city of Holland and added to Laketown Township, Park\n\nTownship, and Holland Charter Township.                           Because the HRCA\n\nprovides        that    “the       whole     of     each    city,      village,        or\n\ntownship” to be affected by the detachment is entitled to\n\nvote,20    by    adding      the     additional         three   townships        to   the\n\nsingle     detachment          petition,          the    voting      base    for      the\n\ndetachment election was greatly expanded.\n\n     The     following         table       summarizes       the      acreage     to   be\n\ntransferred by the detachment and the number of voters that\n\n\n\n\n     19\n       Certification by the Secretary of State was required\nunder § 11 of the HRCA because the city of Holland is\nsituated in both Ottawa County and Allegan County.\n     20\n          MCL 117.9 (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n                                            11\n\n\fwould        be   added   to   the   voting     base   by   including   each\n\nadditional township in the single detachment petition:21\n\n\n         Municipality                  Acres To Be      Registered Voters\n                                      Received from      (as of November\n                                     the Detachment           2002)\n\n\nCity of Holland                          -----                 19,771\n\n\nFillmore Township                        1,054                 1,854\n\n\nLaketown Township                            0.77              4,166\n\n\nHolland Charter Township                     3.33              15,221\n\n\nPark Township                                1.27              11,989\n\n\n\nThus,        by   including    the   three     additional   townships   and\n\ndetaching only an extra 5.37 acres, the voting base of the\n\ndistrict to be affected would be expanded by an additional\n\n31,376 voters over what the voting base would be if only\n\nFillmore Township and the city of Holland were involved.\n\n        In November 2002, the Secretary of State refused to\n\ncertify the detachment petition, relying on the September\n\n2002 decision by the circuit court disallowing the use of a\n\nsingle detachment petition in Casco Twp.

The   Court     of         Appeals    ordered      that        the\n\nplaintiffs’ case be held in abeyance pending its resolution\n\nof Casco Twp.           In March 2004, the Court of Appeals issued\n\nits opinion in Casco Twp, affirming the circuit court’s\n\ndecision          disallowing   the     use        of   a     single     detachment\n\npetition.          Citing its opinion in Casco Twp, the Court of\n\nAppeals then denied the plaintiffs mandamus relief by order\n\nin May 2004.22          We granted leave to appeal and consolidated\n\nthe case with Casco Twp v Secretary of State.23\n\n                            II.

ANALYSIS\n\n              A. THE HRCA   AND THE   SINGLE DETACHMENT PROCEDURE\n\n                            1.HISTORY   OF THE   HRCA\n\n     The HRCA, enacted in 1909, is an intricate statute\n\nthat has been amended in piecemeal fashion numerous times\n\nover the past century.        Before the enactment of the HRCA,\n\nthe Legislature directly enacted municipal boundary changes\n\non   a    case-by-case   basis        through     special   legislation.\n\nDelegates    to   the    1907-1908        constitutional      convention\n\nrecognized the substantial burden this process imposed, as\n\nwell as the confusion that resulted from hundreds of pieces\n\n\n\n\n(…continued)\n\n594, 597; 664 NW2d 705 (2003); Silver Creek Drain Dist v \n\nExtrusions Div, Inc, 468 Mich 367, 373; 663 NW2d 436\n\n(2003). \n\n     25\n        Taxpayers of Michigan Against Casinos v Michigan,\n471 Mich 306, 317-318; 685 NW2d 221 (2004); Wayne Co v\nHathcock, 471 Mich 445, 455; 684 NW2d 765 (2004); DeRose v\nDeRose, 469 Mich 320, 326; 666 NW2d 636 (2003).\n     26\n        Baraga Co v State Tax Comm, 466 Mich 264, 268-269;\n645 NW2d 13 (2002); In re MCI Telecom Complaint, 460 Mich\n396, 443; 596 NW2d 164 (1999).\n\n\n\n\n                                  14\n\n\fof such special legislation.          The convention’s Address to\n\nthe People stated:\n\n            One of the greatest evils brought to the\n         attention of the Convention was the abuse\n         practiced     under      local     and    special\n         legislation. The number of local and special\n         bills passed by the last legislature was four\n         hundred fourteen, not including joint and\n         concurrent resolutions.     The time devoted to\n         the consideration of these measures and the\n         time required in their passage through the\n         two houses imposed a serious burden upon the\n         state.      This    section    [prohibiting   the\n         enactment of special acts when a general act\n         can be made applicable], taken in connection\n         with the increased powers of local self­\n         government granted to cities and villages in\n         the revision, seeks to effectively remedy\n         such condition. . . . The evils of local and\n         special legislation have grown to be almost\n         intolerable,    introducing     uncertainty   and\n         confusion into the laws, and consuming the\n         time and energy of the legislature which\n         should be devoted to the consideration of\n         measures   of   a    general   character.      By\n         eliminating this mass of legislation, the\n         work of the legislature will be greatly\n         simplified and improved.[27]\n\n    27\n        2 Proceedings & Debates, Constitutional Convention\n1907, pp 1422-1423 (emphasis in original).       In their\nAddress to the People, the delegates were referring to\nConst 1908, art 5, § 30, which provided:\n\n          The legislature shall pass no local or\n     special act in any case where a general act can\n     be made applicable, and whether a general act can\n     be made applicable shall be a judicial question.\n     No local or special act, excepting acts repealing\n     local or special acts in effect January 1, 1909\n     and receiving a 2/3 vote of the legislature shall\n     take effect until approved by a majority of the\n     electors voting thereon in the district to be\n     affected.\n\n\n\n                                15\n\n\f        Based            on     this     overwhelming            dissatisfaction             with\n\nspecial          legislation            as     a     means       to    adjust       municipal\n\nboundaries,              delegates        to       the     1907-1908         constitutional\n\nconvention           debated        whether        to    direct       the   Legislature       to\n\nenact        a    general         municipal         boundary        statute       that   would\n\nprovide          a   framework          for    all       future       municipal      boundary\n\nchanges.             The        delegates          proposed,       and      the    people     of\n\nMichigan         eventually            ratified,         Const     1908,    art     8,   §   20,\n\nwhich provided:\n\n                The legislature shall provide by a general\n             law for the incorporation of cities, and by a\n             general law for the incorporation of villages\n             . . . .\n\n        With art 8, § 20 as a constitutional mandate, the\n\nLegislature enacted the HRCA the following year in order to\n\nestablish            a        comprehensive,            standardized        procedure        for\n\ninitiating               and      approving         all      changes         to      municipal\n\nboundaries,                   including            incorporations,                annexations,\n\ndetachments, and consolidations.28\n\n                              2. RELEVANT PROVISIONS      OF THE   HRCA\n\n        As the majority correctly notes, three provisions of\n\nthe HRCA are directly relevant in the present case.                                          The\n\n\n\n        28\n       The substance of Const 1908, art 8, § 20 was carried\nforward into our current Constitution as Const 1963, art 7,\n§ 21.\n\n\n\n                                                   16\n\n\fdetachment process is specifically authorized by § 6 of the\n\nHRCA, which provides:\n\n              Cities may be incorporated or territory\n           detached therefrom or added thereto, or\n           consolidation made of 2 or more cities or\n           villages into 1 city, or of a city and 1 or\n           more villages into 1 city, or of 1 or more\n           cities or villages together with additional\n           territory    not     included     within     any\n           incorporated city or village into 1 city, by\n           proceedings originating by petition therefor\n           signed    by  qualified    electors   who    are\n           freeholders  residing    within   the    cities,\n           villages, or townships to be affected thereby\n           . . . .[29]\n\nHowever, because both the city of Richmond and the city of\n\nHolland are located in more than one county, rather than\n\nfiling their detachment petitions with the county under §\n\n6, plaintiffs in both cases were required to file their\n\npetitions with the Secretary of State pursuant to § 11 of\n\nthe   HRCA.      At   the   time   of   the   present   lawsuits,   §   11\n\nprovided:\n\n              When the territory to be affected by any\n           proposed   incorporation,   consolidation, or\n           change is situated in more than 1 county the\n           petition   hereinbefore   provided   shall be\n           addressed and presented to the secretary of\n           state, with 1 or more affidavits attached\n           thereto sworn to by 1 or more of the signers\n           of said petition, showing that the statements\n           contained in said petition are true, that\n           each signature affixed thereto is the genuine\n           signature of a qualified elector residing in\n           a city, village, or township to be affected\n\n      29\n           MCL 117.6 (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n                                    17\n\n\f          by the carrying out of the purposes of the\n          petition and that not less than 25 or such\n          signers reside in each city, village or\n          township to be affected thereby.              The\n          secretary     of  state   shall   examine    such\n          petition and the affidavit or affidavits\n          annexed, and if he shall find that the same\n          conforms to the provisions of this act he\n          shall so certify, and transmit a certified\n          copy of said petition and the accompanying\n          affidavit or affidavits to the clerk of each\n          city, village or township to be affected by\n          the carrying out of the purposes of such\n          petition, together with his certificate as\n          above provided, and a notice directing that\n          at the next general election occurring not\n          less than 40 days thereafter the question of\n          making the incorporation, consolidation or\n          change of boundaries petitioned for, shall be\n          submitted to the electors of the district to\n          be affected, and if no general election is to\n          be held within 90 days the resolution may fix\n          a date preceding the next general election\n          for a special election on the question. If he\n          shall find that said petition and the\n          affidavit or affidavits annexed thereto do\n          not conform to the provisions of this act he\n          shall certify to that fact, and return said\n          petition and affidavits to the person from\n          whom they were received, together with such\n          certificate. The several city, village and\n          township clerks who shall receive from the\n          secretary      of   state   the     copies    and\n          certificates above provided for shall give\n          notice of the election to be held on the\n          question       of    making     the      proposed\n          incorporation, consolidation or change of\n          boundaries as provided for in section 10 of\n          this act.[30]\n\n\n\n     30\n        MCL 117.11 (emphasis added).    Effective January 1,\n2005, § 11 was amended. None of the amendments is material\nto the resolution of the present cases.\n\n\n\n\n                                 18\n\n\f     Lastly, the phrase “district to be affected,” as used\n\nin § 11, is defined by § 9 of the HRCA:\n\n             The district to be affected by the\n          proposed   incorporation,  consolidation,  or\n          change of boundaries is considered to include\n          the whole of each city, village, or township\n          from which territory is to be taken or to\n          which territory is to be annexed.[31]\n\n                  3. PRINCIPLES   OF   STATUTORY INTERPRETATION\n\n     When interpreting a statute, a court’s duty is to give\n\neffect to the intent of the Legislature based on the actual\n\nwords used in the statute.32             If the statutory language is\n\nclear and unambiguous, no further construction is necessary\n\nor permitted.33     The statute is enforced as written.34          It\n\nis the duty of the judiciary to interpret, not write, the\n\nlaw.35\n\n\n     31\n          MCL 117.9(1) (emphasis added).\n     32\n       Shinholster v Annapolis Hosp, 471 Mich 540, 548-549;\n685 NW2d 275 (2004).\n     33\n       Lansing Mayor v Pub Service Comm, 470 Mich 154, 157;\n680 NW2d 840 (2004); In re MCI, supra at 411.\n     34\n        Stanton v Battle Creek, 466 Mich 611, 615; 647 NW2d\n508 (2002); Huggett v Dep’t of Natural Resources, 464 Mich\n711, 717; 629 NW2d 915 (2001); Anzaldua v Band, 457 Mich\n530, 535; 578 NW2d 306 (1998); Sanders v Delton Kellogg\nSchools, 453 Mich 483, 487; 556 NW2d 467 (1996).\n     35\n       Koontz v Ameritech Services, Inc, 466 Mich 304, 312;\n645 NW2d 34 (2002); State Farm Fire & Cas Co v Old Republic\nIns Co, 466 Mich 142, 146; 644 NW2d 715 (2002).\n\n\n\n\n                                       19\n\n\f       In    Lansing        Mayor    v    Pub       Service    Comm,      this       Court\n\nrepudiated      prior       case    law     that     held     that    a   statute      is\n\nambiguous if it is susceptible to more than one meaning or\n\nif “reasonable minds can differ” regarding the statute’s\n\nmeaning.36      Instead, as this Court stated in Lansing Mayor,\n\na      statutory          provision       is        ambiguous        only       if     it\n\n“‘irreconcilably            conflict[s]’          with   another     provision,        or\n\nwhen    it    is        equally    susceptible        to    more     than   a    single\n\nmeaning.”37             In ascertaining whether an ambiguity exists,\n\ntherefore,          a    court     must   employ         conventional       rules      of\n\nconstruction and “give effect to every word, phrase, and\n\nclause in a statute.”38\n\n               4. THE PLAIN TEXT OF THE HRCA PERMITS THE USE\n             OF ASINGLE DETACHMENT PETITION TO TRANSFER LAND TO\n                      MULTIPLE TOWNSHIPS\n\n       At its core, the Court of Appeals opinion in Casco Twp\n\nrepresents a deliberate decision to subordinate the actual\n\ntext of the HRCA in favor of the Court of Appeals’ own\n\nabstract notions of fairness and justice.                            By choosing to\n\ngive meaning to only some of the words in the HRCA and\n\nignoring      others,        the    Court      of    Appeals       substituted        its\n\n       36\n            Lansing Mayor, supra at 165.\n       37\n            Id. at 166 (emphasis in original; citation omitted).\n       38\n            Id. at 165, 168; Koontz, supra at 312.\n\n\n\n\n                                            20\n\n\fconception of “fairness” for the policy determination made\n\nby the Legislature in writing the HRCA.39   While this à la\n\ncarte method of statutory interpretation that focuses only\n\non certain words in a statute is extraordinarily effective\n\nat allowing a court to reach a conclusion that it views as\n\n“fair” or “just,” it is an affront to the separation of\n\npowers principle.   As this Court has stated numerous times,\n\nit is the duty of the judiciary to effectuate the intent of\n\nthe Legislature by giving effect to every “word, phrase,\n\nand clause in a statute.”40\n\n\n\n\n     39\n        The Court of Appeals opinion is replete with\nreferences to “fairness,” “injustice,” “prejudice,” and\n“absurd results.”   Casco Twp, supra, 261 Mich App at 391,\n394. The Court of Appeals stated, “In simple terms, it is\nclearly unfair that citizens of one township be allowed to\nvote on issues that affect another township.    Indeed, the\ntownships’ combined voting strength could be used to\noverwhelm the city’s voting strength.” Id. at 394.\n\n     Appellees also rely on vague notions of “fairness” and\n“justice” in support of their position.    See Winkle brief\nat 17 (permitting a multiple-township detachment would lead\nto “absurd results which create injustice”); Secretary of\nState brief at 35 (“‘[p]ublic policy requires that statutes\ncontrolling the manner in which elections are conducted be\nconstrued as fair as possible’”); City of Holland brief at\n20 (a multiple-township detachment is “one of the most\negregious examples of . . . inherent mischief”).\n     40\n        Lansing Mayor, supra at 168; Koontz, supra at 312;\nWickens v Oakwood Healthcare Sys, 465 Mich 53, 60; 631 NW2d\n686 (2001).\n\n\n\n\n                              21\n\n\f        A close analysis of the text of the HRCA demonstrates\n\nthat      the     statute       is    not       ambiguous         and   that     a    single\n\ndetachment petition may be used to detach land from a city\n\nand add it to multiple townships.                            Although the majority\n\nfocuses       extensively        on    §    9     of   the    HRCA,41      the       majority\n\nnotably fails to give full effect to the Legislature’s use\n\nof the word “each” in § 9.\n\n        The section of the HRCA under which plaintiffs filed\n\ntheir        petitions,     §    11,       provides      that       “the     question        of\n\nmaking        the    incorporation,              consolidation          or     change        of\n\nboundaries          petitioned        for,       shall       be    submitted         to     the\n\nelectors of the district to be affected . . . .”42                                        Under\n\n§ 9, the HRCA defines “the district to be affected” as\n\n“includ[ing] the whole of each city, village, or township\n\nfrom which territory is to be taken or to which territory\n\nis   to      be   annexed.”43          By    defining         “the      district       to    be\n\naffected” as including the whole of “each” city, village,\n\nor     township,       the       Legislature           contemplated            that       “the\n\ndistrict to be affected” could include multiple townships\n\nin a detachment proceeding.\n\n\n        41\n             Ante at 8. \n\n        42\n             MCL 117.11 (emphasis added). \n\n        43\n             MCL 117.9 (emphasis added). \n\n\n\n\n                                                22\n\n\f     The word “each” is not defined in the HRCA.               Pursuant\n\nto MCL 8.3a, undefined statutory terms are to be given\n\ntheir plain and ordinary meaning, unless, of course, the\n\nundefined word is a term of art.44          Because “each” is not a\n\nterm of art, this Court must therefore give the word its\n\nplain meaning.         As this Court stated in Horace v City of\n\nPontiac,45    “[w]hen considering a nonlegal word or phrase\n\nthat is not defined within a statute, resort to a layman's\n\ndictionary    .    .   .   is   appropriate.”46    Moreover,     it   is\n\nappropriate       to    use     a   dictionary    from   the     period\n\ncontemporaneous to the statute’s enactment in order to give\n\n     44\n          MCL 8.3a provides:\n\n          All words and phrases shall be construed and\n     understood according to the common and approved\n     usage of the language; but technical words and\n     phrases, and such as may have acquired a peculiar\n     and appropriate meaning in the law, shall be\n     construed   and  understood   according  to  such\n     peculiar and appropriate meaning.\n\nSee also Cox v Flint Bd of Hosp Managers, 467 Mich 1, 18;\n651 NW2d 356 (2002); Koontz, supra at 312; Donajkowski v\nAlpena Power Co, 460 Mich 243, 248-249; 596 NW2d 574\n(1999).\n     45\n          456 Mich 744; 575 NW2d 762 (1998).\n     46\n       Id. at 756; see also Halloran v Bhan, 470 Mich 572,\n578; 683 NW2d 129 (2004); People v Jones, 467 Mich 301,\n304; 651 NW2d 906 (2002); Stokes v Millen Roofing Co, 466\nMich 660, 665; 649 NW2d 371 (2002); Robinson v Detroit, 462\nMich 439, 456 n 13; 613 NW2d 307 (2000); Consumers Power Co\nv Pub Service Comm, 460 Mich 148, 163; 596 NW2d 126 (1999).\n\n\n\n\n                                    23\n\n\ffull effect to the intent of the Legislature that enacted\n\nthe statute.47\n\n     Although the HRCA has been amended frequently over the\n\npast century, the relevant provisions of §§ 9 and 11 have\n\nremained unchanged in the HRCA since 1909, the year the\n\nHRCA was originally enacted.     The word “each” is defined by\n\nThe New American Encyclopedic Dictionary as “every one of a\n\nnumber    considered     separately,     all.”48         The    Century\n\nDictionary defines “each” as “Being either or any unit of a\n\nnumerical    aggregate      consisting     of      two     or     more,\n\nindefinitely.”49   Funk & Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary of\n\nthe English Language defines “each” as “Being one of two or\n\nmore . . . Every one of any number or aggregation. . . .”50\n\n\n     47\n        Cain v Waste Management, Inc (After Remand), 472\nMich 236, 247; ____ NW2d ____ (2005); see also Title\nOffice, Inc v Van Buren Co Treasurer, 469 Mich 516, 522;\n676 NW2d 207 (2004).      Writing for the Court in Title\nOffice, Justice Cavanagh noted that, in construing the word\n“transcript” in the 1895 Transcripts and Abstracts of\nRecords Act (TARA), it was proper for the Court to consult\na dictionary in use “[a]t the time of enactment of [the]\nTARA.” Id. (emphasis added).\n     48\n        The New American Encyclopedic Dictionary, p 1575\n(1907) (emphasis added).\n     49\n        The Century Dictionary: An Encyclopedic Lexicon of\nthe English Language, p 1813 (1906) (emphasis added).\n     50\n        Funk & Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary                 of   the\nEnglish Language, p 779 (1913) (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n                                24\n\n\f     It is clear, therefore, that the word “each,” as used\n\nin 1909, means “all” and “every,” and plainly encompasses\n\nmultiple entities.        Indeed, by using “each” in § 9, the\n\nLegislature    effectively     said,      as   a    definitional          matter,\n\nthat “the district to be affected” is to be comprised of\n\n“all” or “every” city, village, or township affected by the\n\nboundary    change.      The   “district”          is   not   limited          to   a\n\npredetermined number, but rather includes every municipal\n\nentity from which territory is to be taken or to which\n\nterritory is to be added.          Thus, while “the district to be\n\naffected”     can     certainly     contain         just      two     municipal\n\nentities, it can also include more than two entities.51\n\n     Defendants     argue   that    the    Legislature’s            use   of    the\n\nword “each” is not determinative because, by using “each,”\n\nthe Legislature was simply referring to the two municipal\n\nentities    that      necessarily      must    be       involved          in    any\n\ndetachment proceeding:         the city that will lose the land\n\n\n\n\n     51\n       The Legislature’s use of the word “each” was not\nlimited solely to § 9 and the definition of “the district\nto be affected.”    For example, the same provision under\nwhich plaintiffs filed their petitions, § 11, directly\nstates that the Secretary of State shall transmit a\ncertified copy of the petition to “each city, village or\ntownship to be affected by the carrying out of the purposes\nof such petition . . . .” MCL 117.11 (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n                                    25\n\n\fand the township that will gain the land.52                       Defendants’\n\nargument    is    unpersuasive.         Had   the     Legislature      intended\n\n“each” to refer only to the two sides involved in a typical\n\ndetachment       proceeding—the     donor      city    and    the     recipient\n\ntownship—and       not     to   multiple      recipient      townships,     the\n\nLegislature would have used the word “both,” not “each.”53\n\nThe Legislature, however, did not limit “the district to be\n\naffected” to only two municipal entities by using the word\n\n“both.”      Instead,      it   deliberately     used     the    distributive\n\nadjective “each,” thereby referring to every municipality\n\naffected.        It   is    only   by    assuming     that    “each”     refers\n\nexclusively to the donor and recipient municipalities in a\n\nconventional       detachment      proceeding         that      the    majority\n\nposition may be sustained.              There is no textual basis for\n\n\n\n\n     52\n        The majority makes a similar, though more general,\nargument.   It notes that a reading of the HRCA “contrary”\nto its own “belies the fact that there will always be two\nparties to a detachment—the city and the township.”   Ante\nat 12 (emphasis in original). Conspicuously, the majority\nneglects to give meaning to the Legislature’s use of the\nword “each.”\n     53\n        The New American Encyclopedic Dictionary, p 580\n(1907) defines “both” as “two taken together” and The\nCentury Dictionary: An Encyclopedic Lexicon of the English\nLanguage, p 636 (1906) defines “both” as “The one and the\nother; the two; the pair or the couple, in reference to two\npersons or things . . . .”\n\n\n\n\n                                        26\n\n\fmaking this assumption or otherwise limiting the customary\n\nmeaning of “each.”54\n\n\n     54\n       Further examination of the text of § 11 demonstrates\nthat a single detachment petition may be used to transfer\nland to multiple townships. For example, § 11 states, “The\nseveral city, village and township clerks who shall receive\nfrom the secretary of state the copies and certificates\nabove provided shall give notice of the election to be held\n. . . .” The word “several” is defined by The New American\nEncyclopedic Dictionary (1907) as “Consisting of a number;\nmore than two.”     The use of “several,” therefore, also\nindicates that the Legislature envisioned a situation under\nwhich a single detachment petition could be used to\ntransfer land to multiple townships. While it is true that\n“several” can also mean “separate” or “individual”—e.g.,\n“they go their several ways”—such a meaning exists only in\nthe context of a plurality.       “Several” only indicates\n“individual” or “separate” if there is a larger collective\nwhole to begin with.\n\n     At oral argument, defense counsel conceded that the\nword “several,” as used in the HRCA, means “more than a\ncouple.”\n\n          Justice Young:    I’m asking you to look at\n     section 11 that refers near the end:        “The\n     several city, village and township clerks who\n     shall receive from the Secretary of State copies\n     of the certificates.”    I’m looking at the term\n     “several” there. Does that not indicate at least\n     the potential for multiple—\n\n          Counsel: Well again we go to kind of the\n     dictionary look at the definition and “several”\n     can mean one individual.\n\n          Justice Young: Really?\n\n          Counsel: I’m sorry, you’re talking about a\n     city, village or –\n\n          Justice Young:   Doesn’t “several” mean more\n     than a couple?\n                                               (continued…)\n\n\n                             27\n\n\f     This construction of the HRCA is bolstered by the fact\n\nthat, throughout § 11, the words “petition” and “election”\n\nare used in the singular even though the words “each” and\n\n“several” are used in the same sentences when modifying\n\n“city, village or township.”       For example, § 11 states that\n\nthe Secretary of State must transmit “a certified copy of\n\nsaid petition . . . to the clerk of each city, village           or\n\ntownship to be affected by the carrying out of the purposes\n\nof such petition . . . .”55             Section 11 further provides\n\nthat “[t]he several city, village and township clerks . . .\n\nshall give notice of the election to be held . . . .”56\n\nWhile it is true that MCL 8.3b states that, in construing\n\nstatutes, “[e]very word importing the singular number only\n\n\n\n(…continued)\n\n            Counsel:   Yes.\n     55\n       MCL 117.11 (emphasis added). The word “petition” is\nused in the singular three other times in § 11:\n\n          The secretary of state shall examine such\n     petition and the affidavit or affidavits annexed\n     . . . . If he shall find that said petition and\n     the affidavit or affidavits annexed thereto do\n     not conform to the provisions of this act he\n     shall certify to that fact, and return said\n     petition and affidavits to the person from whom\n     they were received . . . .

MCL 8.3b states only that the singular “may”\n\nextend to the plural.\n\n      This Court addressed MCL 8.3b in Robinson, in which we\n\nconstrued     the       phrase    “the      proximate         cause”    within      the\n\ncontext of the governmental immunity statute.57                        As we noted\n\nin Robinson, MCL 8.3b \"only states that a word importing\n\nthe   singular      number       ‘may     extend’        to   the    plural.        The\n\nstatute does not say that such an automatic understanding\n\nis required.”58          We went on to hold that MCL 8.3 “provides\n\nthat the rule stated in § 3b shall be observed ‘unless such\n\n      57\n           MCL 691.1407(2) provides:\n\n              Except as otherwise provided in this\n           section,    and    without   regard   to  the\n           discretionary or ministerial nature of the\n           conduct   in    question,  each   officer and\n           employee of a governmental agency . . . is\n           immune from tort liability for an injury to a\n           person or damage to property caused by the\n           officer, employee, or member while in the\n           course of employment or service . . . if all\n           of the following are met:\n\n                                  *        *         *\n\n              (c) The officer's, employee's, member's,\n           or volunteer's conduct does not amount to\n           gross negligence that is the proximate cause\n           of the injury or damage. [Emphasis added.]\n      58\n           Robinson, supra at 461 n 18.\n\n\n\n\n                                           29\n\n\fconstruction would be inconsistent with the manifest intent\n\nof the Legislature.’”59               This Court concluded that because\n\nthe Legislature chose to use the definite article “the”\n\nwithin       the     phrase    “the     proximate           cause,”       it     “clearly\n\nevince[d] an intent to focus on one cause.”60\n\n       The same is true in the present case.                            In § 11, the\n\nLegislature         consistently       referred         to       “petition”       in   the\n\nsingular and used the phrase “the election.”                               There is no\n\nprincipled basis by which to say that “the” means “one” in\n\nRobinson, but “the” does not mean “one” when referring to\n\n“the election” mandated by § 11.\n\n       Taken together, all of these textual clues demonstrate\n\nthat    the      HRCA   permits       the    use       of    a    single       detachment\n\npetition and election when transferring land to more than\n\none township.           Unlike the majority, which focuses only on\n\nselect words in the HRCA, I believe that this Court is\n\nobligated to give effect to every word the Legislature used\n\nin writing the HRCA.               I would hold, therefore, that the\n\nCourt       of     Appeals    erred    in         finding        that   the     HRCA    is\n\nambiguous.              No    provision           of    the        HRCA        conflicts,\n\nirreconcilably or otherwise, with any other provision of\n\n       59\n            Id. \n\n       60\n            Id. at 458-459 (emphasis added). \n\n\n\n\n\n                                            30\n\n\fthe HRCA.        Nor is the HRCA equally susceptible to more than\n\na   single       meaning.       A    plain        reading   of     §§   9   and    11\n\ndemonstrates that the procedure used by plaintiffs in the\n\npresent cases is permissible under the HRCA.\n\n        The majority casually dismisses this Court’s decision\n\nin Walsh v Secretary of State,61 which explicitly recognized\n\nand permitted a single petition for a multiple–municipality\n\nannexation under the HRCA.                In Walsh, we examined §§ 9 and\n\n11 of the HRCA.             The case involved an annexation by the\n\ncity of Lansing in which it sought to acquire four parcels\n\nof land from Lansing Township and one parcel situated in\n\nboth     Lansing     Township       and     Delta     Township.         A    single\n\npetition was filed with the Secretary of State for this\n\nmultiple-township annexation.                    Although voters in the city\n\nof Lansing and Lansing Township approved the annexation,\n\nvoters in Delta Township did not.\n\n        The    plaintiffs     in    Walsh        argued   that   the    annexation\n\nattempt       was   divisible       and     that     we   should    approve       the\n\nannexation of the parcels in Lansing Township, given that\n\nthe Lansing Township voters approved the annexation.                          This\n\nCourt        disagreed.      We     held     that     the   annexation      was     a\n\n“package proposition” and that, under the vote tabulation\n\n        61\n             355 Mich 570; 95 NW2d 511 (1959).\n\n\n\n\n                                           31\n\n\fprovisions of § 9 in effect at the time, if any one of the\n\n“voting     units”    voted       against      the     proposal,      the        whole\n\nproposal failed.62\n\n     While     it    is    true   that     Walsh      involved   an     analogous\n\nannexation rather than a detachment, and that the primary\n\nfocus in Walsh was on the vote tabulation provisions of the\n\nHRCA, not the definition of “district to be affected,” this\n\nCourt accepted the use of a single “package” petition even\n\nthough the land that was to be annexed consisted of five\n\ndistinct parcels in two separate townships.                          Accordingly,\n\nthe single petition procedure used by plaintiffs in the\n\npresent     cases     is    not     “novel”      as      defendants        contend.\n\nIndeed, as Walsh demonstrates, this Court’s own case law\n\nhas countenanced the use of such a procedure under the HRCA\n\nin the closely analogous annexation context.\n\n          5. THE MAJORITY’S RELIANCE ON THE HRCA’S “QUALIFIED\n          ELECTOR” REQUIREMENT AND THE ELECTION CODE IS MISPLACED\n\n     The     majority       bases    its       holding     primarily        on     the\n\n“qualified     elector”      requirement        in    §§   6   and    11    of    the\n\nHRCA.63    Section 6 provides that detachment proceedings must\n\nbe initiated by\n\n\n     62\n          Id. at 574. \n\n     63\n          Ante at 6-7. \n\n\n\n\n\n                                         32\n\n\f             proceedings originating by petition therefor\n             signed    by  qualified   electors   who   are\n             freeholders  residing   within   the   cities,\n             villages, or townships to be affected thereby\n             . . . .[64]\n\nSection 11 requires affidavits showing that\n\n             each signature affixed [to the petition] is\n             the genuine signature of a qualified elector\n             residing in a city, village or township to be\n             affected by the carrying out of the purposes\n             of the petition and that not less than 25 of\n             such signers reside in each city, village or\n             township to be affected thereby.[65]\n\nThe majority concludes that any multiple-township petition\n\nalways        violates      the    “qualified         elector\"     rule    because     a\n\nsignatory        who   is    a     qualified      elector     of    township      A   is\n\nobviously not a qualified elector of township B, in that\n\nthe signatory is not a resident of the territory “to be\n\naffected” in township B.\n\n        The    majority’s         analysis      is    flawed.       The    “qualified\n\nelector”        provision         of   §   11     merely    requires       that    each\n\nsignatory be a qualified elector of “a” city, village, or\n\ntownship affected by the detachment and that there be at\n\nleast        twenty-five          signatures         from   “each”    municipality\n\naffected.        It is uncontested in the present cases that at\n\nleast        twenty-five     qualified          electors    from    each    city      and\n\n        64\n             MCL 117.6 (emphasis added). \n\n        65\n             MCL 117.11 (emphasis added). \n\n\n\n\n\n                                            33\n\n\ftownship        involved    signed   the       petitions.66          What   the\n\nmajority’s argument is actually advancing is the unstated\n\npredicate point that the “district to be affected” cannot\n\nencompass more than one township.                  However, because the\n\nLegislature has permitted the “district to be affected” to\n\ninclude multiple townships, as the textual analysis above\n\nand the Walsh case demonstrate, then every township that is\n\nbundled into the single petition is necessarily “affected”\n\nwithin the meaning of the “qualified voter” provision in §\n\n11.67\n\n        The    majority’s     reliance    on   §   643a   in   the    Michigan\n\nElection Law, MCL 168.643a, is also misplaced.68                      While it\n\nis true that § 643a requires electoral questions to be\n\nsubmitted to voters in a “yes or no” format, there is no\n\n        66\n        Similarly, § 6 simply            requires that the signatories\nbe qualified electors of                  “the cities, villages, or\ntownships to be affected                 thereby.”     The Legislature\nconspicuously referred to the            municipalities in the plural.\n        67\n        The majority also relies on MCL 117.13, which\nstates, “Territory detached from any city shall thereupon\nbecome a part of the township or village from which it was\noriginally taken . . . .”     Ante at 9.    Contrary to the\nmajority’s assertion, this language does not prohibit the\nuse of a single detachment petition involving multiple\ntownships.   It merely delineates which municipality will\ncontrol the territory after the detachment is effectuated.\nThe language of § 13 applies with equal force if multiple\ntownships are involved in a single detachment proceeding.\n        68\n             Ante at 10-11.\n\n\n\n\n                                     34\n\n\freason      why     a    single   detachment        petition       and      referendum\n\ninvolving          multiple    townships       violates      this       requirement.\n\nIndeed, that was the exact situation in Walsh, which held\n\nthat     the       multiple-township       annexation           was     a    “package”\n\nproposition and not divisible.\n\n       In fact, the precise case that the majority cites for\n\nits § 643a rationale–Muskegon Pub Schools v Vander Laan69–\n\ninvolved       a    multiple-issue       proposal        that     was    put       to   the\n\nvoters in a single “yes or no” format and upheld by this\n\nCourt.       In Vander Laan, a school district bundled bonding\n\nproposals for three separate school buildings into a single\n\nquestion       to       be   submitted   to     the      voters.            This    Court\n\nunanimously          approved      the     use      of      the       multiple-issue\n\nproposal.70         Although the Vander Laan Court acknowledged the\n\nrule established in other jurisdictions that “[s]eparate\n\nsubjects,          separate    purposes,       or   independent         propositions\n\nshould not be combined [in a single electoral question] so\n\nthat one may gather votes for the other,” it noted that\n\nthere was no statutory basis for the rule in Michigan.71\n\nNevertheless,            the   Vander    Laan       Court       still       imposed       a\n\n       69\n            211 Mich 85; 178 NW 424 (1920).\n       70\n            Id. at 88-89.\n       71\n            Id. at 87.\n\n\n\n\n                                         35\n\n\f“separate       subjects”          rule    and     ultimately           upheld    the\n\nmultiple-issue proposal because it “was characterized by\n\none common purpose . . . .”72\n\n       I question the majority’s reliance on Vander Laan when\n\nthe    Vander    Laan     Court      itself      noted    that      there   was   no\n\nstatutory basis for the “separate subjects” electoral rule\n\nthat    it    recognized.          Rather       than    rely   on   a    judicially\n\ncreated rule that was premised on policy concerns in an\n\nunrelated       area,    I     prefer     to     base    my    analysis     of    the\n\nmultiple-township detachment procedure on the actual text\n\nof the HRCA.            However, to the extent that Vander Laan—a\n\ncase that did not even involve the HRCA—is controlling in\n\nthe    present    cases,       I   believe      that    the    multiple-township\n\ndetachments      are     in    accord     with    its    holding        because   the\n\ndetachments are united by a “common purpose.”\n\n                    6.       DEFENDANTS’ REMAINING ARGUMENTS\n\n       Defendants argue that to construe the HRCA so as to\n\npermit a single, multiple-township petition would lead to\n\n“absurd results.”               However, in People v McIntire,73 this\n\nCourt rejected the absurd results “rule” of construction,\n\nnoting that its invocation is usually “‘an invitation to\n\n       72\n            Id. at 88. \n\n       73\n            461 Mich 147; 599 NW2d 102 (1999). \n\n\n\n\n\n                                          36\n\n\fjudicial lawmaking.’”74           It is not the role of this Court to\n\nrewrite    the     law    so    that    its    resulting      policy       is   more\n\n“logical,” or perhaps palatable, to a particular party or\n\nthe Court.       It is our constitutional role to give effect to\n\nthe intent of the Legislature by enforcing the statute as\n\nwritten.75       What defendants in these cases (or any other\n\ncase) may view as “absurd” reflects an actual policy choice\n\nadopted by a majority of the Legislature and approved by\n\nthe Governor. If defendants prefer an alternative policy\n\nchoice,    the    proper        forum   is     the    Legislature,     not      this\n\nCourt.       After       all,    the    Legislature       has      shown    little\n\nreluctance in amending the HRCA over the past century.\n\n     The defendants in Fillmore Twp also argue that if the\n\ndetachment    of     1.27      acres    from    the    city   of    Holland     for\n\naddition to Park Township is permitted, it would violate\n\nthe “contiguity” rule articulated by this Court in Genesee\n\nTwp v Genesee Co,76 a case involving an annexation of land\n\n\n\n     74\n       McIntire, supra at 156 n 2, quoting Scalia, A Matter\nof Interpretation: Federal Courts and the Law (New Jersey:\nPrinceton University Press, 1997), p 21.\n     75\n        See People v Javens, 469 Mich 1032, 1033 (2004)\n(Young, J., concurring).

In\n\nGenesee Twp, this Court stated:\n\n               “So, as to territorial extent, the idea of\n            a city is one of unity, not of plurality; of\n            compactness or contiguity, not separation or\n            segregation. Contiguity is generally required\n            even in the absence of statutory requirement\n            to that effect, and where the annexation is\n            left   in  the    discretion of   a  judicial\n            tribunal, contiguity will be required as a\n            matter of law.”[77]\n\nRecognizing        that    the   requirement       of    contiguity        was   not\n\n“covered      by   any    specific      provision       of    the    [HRCA],”    the\n\nCourt in       Genesee       Twp instead based its holding on non­\n\ntextual policy grounds:                “the purpose sought to be served\n\n[by    the    HRCA]      and   the     practical      aspects       of   annexation\n\n. . . .”78\n\n       However,       this     Court    revisited       the    contiguity        rule\n\neight years later in Owosso Twp v City of Owosso.79                                We\n\nspecifically          stated     in      Owosso        that     “the       judicial\n\nrequirement of ‘contiguity’” articulated in Genesee Twp had\n\nbeen “superseded” when the Legislature amended § 9 of the\n\n\n\n\n       77\n         Id.   at  603,   quoting                 37     Am     Jur,      Municipal\nCorporations, § 27, pp 644-645.\n       78\n            Id. at 602.\n       79\n            385 Mich 587; 189 NW2d 421 (1971).\n\n\n\n\n                                         38\n\n\fHRCA in 1970.80      We found that the “substantive standards”\n\nestablished by the Legislature when it amended § 9 clearly\n\ndisplaced the court-made contiguity rule.81                         Defendants in\n\nthe present cases would apparently have this Court ignore\n\nthe    legislative     intent     of         §     9      and    resuscitate    the\n\njudicially created contiguity rule in the HRCA context.                           I\n\nwould decline the invitation.\n\n                   7. CONSTITUTIONALITY          OF THE   HRCA\n\n      Because I believe that the HRCA permits the use of a\n\nsingle detachment petition involving multiple townships, it\n\nis necessary to determine whether the HRCA’s authorization\n\nof    such    a   procedure     is     constitutional.                  Defendants,\n\nparticularly those in Fillmore Twp, contend that bundling\n\nnumerous townships into a single petition and referendum\n\nunconstitutionally      dilutes      the         vote     of     city   residents.82\n\n\n\n      80\n           Id. at 588-590.\n      81\n       Id. at 590. The Court of Appeals elaborated on this\npoint in Bloomfield Charter Twp v Oakland Co Clerk, 253\nMich App 1, 34; 654 NW2d 610 (2002).\n      82\n        It is worth noting that these consolidated cases do\nnot involve any allegations of discrimination, or the\nimpairment of voting rights, on the basis of race or any\nother   suspect   classification.      See,  e.g.,   Gerken,\nUnderstanding the right to an undiluted vote, 114 Harv L R\n1663 (2001).   The sole issue of contention here is one of\npure numerical vote dilution.     Defendants claim that too\nmany township voters would be included in the voting base\n                                                (continued…)\n\n\n                                       39\n\n\fDefendants   argue   that   such    vote   dilution   is   prohibited\n\nunder the Equal Protection Clause of US Const, Am XIV.83\n\n\n\n(…continued)\n\nif these referenda are allowed to proceed, to the extent\n\nthat city voters would no longer have a meaningful vote. \n\n     83\n        While defendants allege violations of both the\nfederal and state equal protection clauses, they base their\nvote dilution argument almost entirely on federal case law.\nThey cite no Michigan cases analyzing vote dilution under\nConst 1963, art 1, § 2.    Instead, defendants simply state\nin their brief that “Michigan courts interpret the state\nequal protection clause similarly to the Fourteenth\nAmendment.” City of Holland brief at 39.\n\n     It is important to note that the text of our state\nEqual Protection Clause is not entirely the same as its\nfederal counterpart:\n\n     US Const, Am XIV provides in pertinent part:\n\n          No State shall make or enforce any law which\n     shall abridge the privileges or immunities of\n     citizens of the United States; nor shall any\n     State deprive any person of life, liberty, or\n     property, without due process of law; nor deny to\n     any person within its jurisdiction the equal\n     protection of the laws. [Emphasis added.]\n\n     Const 1963, art 1, § 2 provides:\n\n          No   person   shall   be denied   the   equal\n     protection of the laws; nor shall any person be\n     denied the enjoyment of his civil or political\n     rights or be discriminated against in the\n     exercise thereof because of religion, race, color\n     or   national   origin.   The  legislature   shall\n     implement     this    section    by    appropriate\n     legislation.\n\nSee also Lind v Battle Creek, 470 Mich 230, 234-235; 681\nNW2d 334 (2004) (Young, J., concurring).\n\n                                                       (continued…)\n\n\n                                   40\n\n\f     Given the facts surrounding defendants’ vote dilution\n\nclaim,     it    is   easy    to       understand     their     argument.       As\n\ndiscussed in part I(B) of this opinion, it is obvious, for\n\nexample, that the plaintiffs in Fillmore Twp deliberately\n\nincluded the three additional townships—Laketown, Holland\n\nCharter,        and   Park—as      a    means    to    equalize    the      voting\n\ndisparity        between     the       city     of    Holland    and     Fillmore\n\n\n(…continued)\n     Therefore, it is insufficient for defendants to rely\nsolely on federal case law regarding vote dilution, or\nMichigan cases interpreting the federal Equal Protection\nClause, and then boldly announce that Const 1963, art 1, §\n2 provides the same protections against vote dilution as US\nConst, Am XIV.\n\n     Because defendants have failed to address vote\ndilution directly under Const 1963, art 1, § 2, I decline\nto examine the issue.    As this Court stated in Mitcham v\nDetroit, 355 Mich 182, 203; 94 NW2d 388 (1959):\n\n          It is not enough for an appellant in his\n     brief simply to announce a position or assert an\n     error and then leave it up to this Court to\n     discover and rationalize the basis for his\n     claims, or unravel and elaborate for him his\n     arguments, and then search for authority either\n     to sustain or reject his position. The appellant\n     himself must first adequately prime the pump;\n     only then does the appellate well begin to flow.\n\n     Moreover, the constitutional provision upon which\ndefendants base their argument, Const 1963, art 1, § 2, was\nnot relied on by the Court of Appeals. It was Const 1963,\nart 1, § 1 that the Court of Appeals referenced in its\nopinion. Casco Twp, supra, 261 Mich App at 394 n 27.\n\n     Accordingly, I analyze defendants’ vote dilution\nargument solely under US Const, Am XIV—the issue that was\nfully briefed by the parties.\n\n\n\n                                          41\n\n\fTownship.        In the initial August 2000 detachment vote that\n\nincluded only the city of Holland and Fillmore Township,\n\nvoters rejected the detachment by a vote of 3,917 to 2,614\n\n(approximately       sixty   percent       against,    forty       percent    in\n\nfavor).      Recognizing that the number of voters in the city\n\nof   Holland      exceeded   the    number       of   voters      in    Fillmore\n\nTownship by 19,771 to 1,854, almost a 10.7 to 1 margin, the\n\nplaintiffs bundled the three additional townships into the\n\npetition     by   seeking    to   detach    an    additional       5.37     acres\n\n(0.77 acres for Laketown Township, 3.33 acres for Holland\n\nCharter Township, and 1.27 acres for Park Township).                          By\n\ndoing so, the plaintiffs were able to add an additional\n\n31,376 township voters to the voting base of the “district\n\nto be affected” and thereby exceed the voting base of the\n\ncity of Holland.          In order to evaluate defendants’ claims\n\nof   unconstitutional        vote    dilution—an           issue       on   which\n\nMichigan courts have been relatively silent—it is necessary\n\nto explore briefly the history of federal vote dilution law\n\nunder      the    Equal   Protection       Clause     of    the        Fourteenth\n\nAmendment.84\n\n\n      84\n        As an initial matter, it is important to note that\nthe state action requirement under Fourteenth Amendment\njurisprudence is satisfied here.    Although the detachment\npetitions in both cases were circulated and signed by\nprivate citizens, the involvement of the Secretary of State\n                                               (continued…)\n\n\n                                     42\n\n\f      The     idea     of     “vote    dilution”85         as    a      cognizable\n\nconstitutional         harm     originated          in     the        context    of\n\ncongressional        and    state   legislative          apportionment       cases.\n\nInitially,      courts       refused   to     get        involved      in    claims\n\nregarding vote dilution.            The issue was viewed as best left\n\nfor the political process and considered nonjusticiable.\n\nThe   leading    case       establishing     this    view       was    the   United\n\nStates Supreme Court’s decision in Colegrove v Green,86 in\n\n\n\n(…continued)\n\nin certifying the petitions and ordering local authorities\n\nto hold elections is sufficient to constitute state action. \n\nSee, e.g. Ellison v Garbarino, 48 F3d 192, 195 (CA 6, 1995)\n\n(“running elections” is a “typical example[ ]” of state\n\naction). \n\n      85\n           Professor Melvyn R. Durchslag has noted:\n\n           Voter dilution cases fall into two broad\n      categories. First, there are those in which\n      dilution occurs because (1) some persons are\n      given votes weighted more heavily than others\n      similarly situated merely on the basis of\n      residence, (2) votes are weighted according to a\n      factor which the state determines is reflective\n      of “interest,” or (3) persons are excluded\n      altogether from voting because the state deems\n      them to be “uninterested.” Second, there are\n      those in which dilution occurs because equal\n      franchise is granted to persons allegedly without\n      interest, or with significantly less interest\n      than other voters.

Stating that\n\nthe   harm      was     one   to    “Illinois         as   a     polity”    and    not   a\n\nprivate        wrong,    the       Court    refused         to    intervene.87           In\n\nrejecting the notion that the Court should get involved in\n\nwhat it viewed as a political question, Justice Frankfurter\n\nwrote        that    “[c]ourts     ought        not   to    enter    this    political\n\nthicket.”88          He went on to note:\n\n                The remedy for unfairness in districting\n             is to secure State legislatures that will\n             apportion properly, or to invoke the ample\n             powers of Congress. . . .   The Constitution\n             has left the performance of many duties in\n             our governmental scheme to depend on the\n             fidelity of the executive and legislative\n             action and, ultimately, on the vigilance of\n             the people in exercising their political\n             rights.[89]\n\n        However, approximately fifteen years after Colegrove,\n\nthe Supreme Court reversed course in the landmark case of\n\nBaker v Carr.90           In Baker, the Court was presented with a\n\nconstitutional           challenge         to     the      apportionment          of   the\n\n\n        87\n             Id. at 552. \n\n        88\n             Id. at 556. \n\n        89\n             Id. \n\n        90\n             369 US 186; 82 S Ct 691; 7 L Ed 2d 663 (1962). \n\n\n\n\n\n                                            44\n\n\fTennessee          General        Assembly.              Despite       significant\n\ndemographic         shifts      that   occurred         within   Tennessee,      the\n\nstate had not reapportioned its legislative districts in\n\nover sixty years.               Voters filed suit and claimed that, in\n\nlight        of   the   drastic    change       in   population,       the   state’s\n\nfailure to reapportion the General Assembly amounted to a\n\nviolation         of    their     equal   protection        rights      under    the\n\nFourteenth Amendment.\n\n        The Court rejected the “political question” rationale\n\nused in Colegrove and held that the issue presented by the\n\nvoters was justiciable.                Justice Brennan, writing for the\n\nCourt,        stated    that    “the   mere      fact    that    the   suit     seeks\n\nprotection of a political right does not mean it presents a\n\npolitical question.”91             The Court went on to hold that the\n\nEqual Protection Clause provided a proper vehicle by which\n\nto challenge the Tennessee apportionment system.92                            In its\n\n\n        91\n             Id. at 209.\n        92\n         Id. at 237.     Commentators have questioned the\nSupreme Court’s reliance on the Equal Protection Clause in\nBaker, suggesting, instead, that the Republican Form of\nGovernment Clause, US Const, art IV, § 4, would have been\nmore appropriate.     As Judge Michael W. McConnell has\nwritten:\n\n             A districting scheme so malapportioned that\n        a minority faction is in complete control,\n        without regard to democratic sentiment, violates\n        the basic norms of republican government.     It\n                                                 (continued…)\n\n\n                                          45\n\n\fsweeping holding, the Court did not provide any guidelines\n\nregarding how the Equal Protection Clause should be applied\n\nto voting rights cases nor establish any standards by which\n\n\n\n(…continued)\n     would thus appear to raise a constitutional\n     question under Article IV, Section 4, which\n     states that “the United States shall guarantee to\n     every State in this Union a Republican Form of\n     Government.”   Constitutional standards under the\n     Republican Form of Government Clause are ill­\n     developed, but surely a government is not\n     “republican” if a minority faction maintains\n     control, and the majority has no means of\n     overturning it.

Karlan has noted:\n\n         [T]he doctrinal move to one person, one vote\n    was in no sense compelled, either by precedent or\n    by the absence of any alternative avenues to\n    judicial oversight. The decision to rely on the\n    Equal Protection Clause, rather than on the\n    Guaranty Clause, has always puzzled me. Justice\n    William Brennan’s explanation—that there was\n    precedent       suggesting       the       general\n    nonjusticiability of the Guaranty Clause—would\n    make more sense if not for the fact that there\n    was also absolutely square precedent refusing to\n    entertain   malapportionment  claims   under   the\n    Fourteenth Amendment [citing Colegrove].    If the\n    Court had to overrule some precedent to review\n    apportionment and the refusal to reapportion,\n    then why was overruling Fourteenth Amendment\n    precedent—and developing a unique set of equal\n    protection principles that apply nowhere else in\n    constitutional   law—the   superior  alternative?\n    [Karlan, Politics by other means, 85 Va L R 1697,\n    1717-1718 (1999).]\n\n\n\n\n                            46\n\n\fto implement the new role for the judiciary in such cases.\n\nInstead, the Court simply stated, “Nor need the [voters\n\nchallenging the apportionment], in order to succeed in this\n\naction, ask the Court to enter upon policy determinations\n\nfor   which   judicially   manageable      standards   are   lacking.\n\nJudicial standards under the Equal Protection Clause are\n\nwell developed and familiar . . . .”93\n\n      With Baker creating the opening, courts soon began to\n\nwade head-high into the thicket of vote dilution claims.\n\n      93\n         Baker, supra at 226.        In dissent, Justice\nFrankfurter sharply criticized the Court for casting aside\nthe “political question” rationale of Colegrove.        He\nchallenged the majority’s conclusion that courts were\nequipped to handle such voting rights cases.       Justice\nFrankfurter stated:\n\n            The Framers carefully and with deliberate\n      forethought refused . . . to enthrone the\n      judiciary.

In\n\nReynolds, the Court stated that “the overriding objective\n\nmust    be    substantial      equality      of   population        among     the\n\nvarious      districts,   so   that    the    vote    of     any    citizen   is\n\napproximately equal in weight to that of any other citizen\n\nin the State.”96\n\n       The Court later made the one-person, one-vote standard\n\napplicable to local governments in Avery v Midland Co.97                       In\n\nAvery, the Court invalidated the apportionment system for\n\nthe Commissioners Court of Midland County, Texas, because\n\nit consisted of “single-member districts of substantially\n\nunequal population,” which favored rural voters over city\n\nvoters.98         The     Court    reasoned          that,     because        the\n\nCommissioners       Court       exercised         “general         governmental\n\n       94\n            376 US 1; 84 S Ct 526; 11 L Ed 2d 481 (1964).\n       95\n            377 US 533; 84 S Ct 1362; 12 L Ed 2d 506 (1964).\n       96\n            Id. at 579.\n       97\n            390 US 474; 88 S Ct 1114; 20 L Ed 2d 45 (1968).\n       98\n            Id. at 475-476.\n\n\n\n\n                                      48\n\n\fpowers”99 and its actions had a “broad range of impacts on\n\nall the citizens of the county,”100 the one-person, one vote\n\nstandard should apply.101\n\n     As     Wesberry,    Reynolds,     Avery,   and     their   progeny\n\ndemonstrate, the one-person, one-vote standard has become a\n\nwell-established         principle      in      equal       protection\n\njurisprudence.     At the same time, two notable exceptions to\n\n\n     99\n         Id. at 476, 484-485.       Under Texas law, the\nCommissioners   Court    possessed   wide-ranging   powers,\nincluding the authority to appoint officials and fill\nvacancies in county offices, contract on behalf of the\ncounty, build roads, administer welfare programs, run\nelections, issue bonds, set tax rates, and adopt the county\nbudget.

See\nKramer v Union Free School Dist No 15, 395 US 621; 89 S Ct\n1886; 23 L Ed 2d 583 (1969) (invalidating a New York law\nthat restricted voting in school district elections to\nowners and lessees of taxable property within the school\ndistrict and to parents of children attending the schools);\nCipriano v City of Houma, 395 US 701; 89 S Ct 1897; 23 L Ed\n2d 647 (1969) (invalidating a state law that limited the\nvote in a municipal bond election to taxpayers); City of\nPhoenix v Kolodziejski, 399 US 204; 90 S Ct 1990; 26 L Ed\n2d 523 (1970) (same); Hadley v Junior College Dist of Metro\nKansas City, 397 US 50; 90 S Ct 791; 25 L Ed 2d 45 (1970)\n(applying the one-person, one-vote standard to a junior\ncollege electoral district); Bd of Estimate of New York\nCity v Morris, 489 US 688; 109 S Ct 1433; 103 L Ed 2d 717\n(1989) (invalidating the city of New York’s Board of\nEstimate because each of the five New York City borough\npresidents possessed an equal vote on the Board, even\nthough the boroughs had “widely disparate populations”).\n\n\n\n\n                                 49\n\n\fthe one-person, one-vote rule are just as firmly entrenched\n\nin equal protection analysis.             The first involves so-called\n\n“special      purpose      districts.”        Under       this     exception,\n\nelectoral districts that serve a specialized purpose, such\n\nas   a     water    storage   district,     are    exempt        from     strict\n\nscrutiny      and    the    rigid   one-person,       one-vote          standard\n\nbecause they perform functions that “‘so disproportionately\n\naffect different groups that a popular election’” is not\n\nwarranted.102\n\n     The second, and more relevant, exception to the one­\n\nperson,     one-vote    standard    involves      changes    to     municipal\n\nboundaries.         Indeed,   the   Supreme       Court    recognized       the\n\nunique nature of boundary changes as early as 1907 in the\n\nseminal case of Hunter v Pittsburgh,103 nearly sixty years\n\nbefore the one-person, one-vote standard was established.\n\nIn Hunter, the city of Allegheny was annexed to the city of\n\n\n     102\n        Salyer Land Co v Tulare Lake Basin Water Storage\nDist, 410 US 719, 728-729; 93 S Ct 1224; 35 L Ed 2d 659\n(1973), quoting Hadley, supra at 56. Nearly a decade after\nSalyer, in Ball v James, 451 US 355; 101 S Ct 1811; 68 L Ed\n2d 150 (1981), the Supreme Court extended the Salyer\n“special purpose district” exception to a water district\nthat served many urban customers (including the city of\nPhoenix), unlike the district in Salyer, which served\nmostly agricultural users.   See also Briffault, Who rules\nat home?: One person/One vote and local governments, 60 U\nChi L R 339, 359-360 (1993).\n     103\n           207 US 161; 28 S Ct 40; 52 L Ed 151 (1907).\n\n\n\n                                    50\n\n\fPittsburgh.        Under state law, the votes in both cities on\n\nthe annexation were aggregated.           Voters in Allegheny, who\n\nwere greatly outnumbered by voters in Pittsburgh, claimed\n\nthat    their     votes   were   unconstitutionally   diluted.   The\n\nSupreme Court rejected the dilution claim and held that\n\nstates have complete control over municipalities:\n\n                The State, therefore, at its pleasure may\n             modify or withdraw all such powers, may take\n             without compensation such property, hold it\n             itself, or vest it in other agencies, expand\n             or contract the territorial area, unite the\n             whole   or  a    part   of it  with   another\n             municipality, repeal the charter and destroy\n             the corporation. All this may be done,\n             conditionally or unconditionally, with or\n             without the consent of the citizens, or even\n             against their protest. In all these respects\n             the State is supreme, and its legislative\n             body, conforming its action to the state\n             constitution, may do as it will, unrestrained\n             by any provision of the Constitution of the\n             United States. Although the inhabitants and\n             property owners may by such changes suffer\n             inconvenience, and their property may be\n             lessened in value by the burden of increased\n             taxation, or for any other reason, they have\n             no right by contract or otherwise in the\n             unaltered or continued existence of the\n             corporation or its powers, and there is\n             nothing in the Federal Constitution which\n             protects    them     from  these    injurious\n             consequences. The power is in the State and\n             those who legislate for the State are alone\n             responsible for any unjust or oppressive\n             exercise of it.[104]\n\n\n\n       104\n             Id. at 178-179.\n\n\n\n\n                                    51\n\n\f      This Court fully embraced the rationale of Hunter in\n\nMidland Twp v State Boundary Comm.105               The case involved an\n\nequal protection challenge to provisions of the HRCA that\n\nprovided     for   a   referendum    if     the    area    to   be   affected\n\nincluded more than one hundred persons, but excluded the\n\npossibility     of     a   referendum     when    one    hundred     or   fewer\n\npersons were affected.           In rejecting the equal protection\n\nargument, Justice Levin, writing for the Court, directly\n\nrelied on Hunter and held, “No city, village, township or\n\nperson has any vested right or legally protected interest\n\nin the boundaries of such governmental units.”106\n\n      Although Hunter preceded the establishment of the one­\n\nperson, one-vote standard by half a century, its holding\n\nhas     endured        throughout         modern        equal      protection\n\njurisprudence.107          Indeed, municipal boundary changes have\n\n\n      105\n            401 Mich 641, 664-666; 259 NW2d 326 (1977).\n      106\n         Id. at 664 (emphasis added).

New York law\n\nprovided that such an amendment could only become effective\n\nupon    approval     by    separate     majorities      of   the   voters   who\n\nlived in the cities within the county and of the voters who\n\nlived outside the cities.               The amendment to the charter\n\nfailed both times that it was put to a vote.                       Although a\n\nmajority of the city voters and a majority of the overall\n\nvotes    cast      were   in   favor   of     the   amendment,     a   separate\n\nmajority of non-city voters in favor of the amendment was\n\nnever achieved in either election.                  Residents of the cities\n\nfiled suit, claiming that the concurrent-majority voting\n\nscheme       unconstitutionally        diluted      their    voting    strength\n\nbecause       it    gave       a   small      number    of     rural     voters\n\ndisproportionate voting strength.\n\n       The     Supreme     Court    unanimously        rejected    the    equal\n\nprotection challenge.110            In upholding the New York voting\n\nscheme, the Court focused on two points.                     First, it found\n\nthat the Reynolds line of cases dealing with one person,\n\none vote in the context of legislative representation were\n\n\n       110\n          Chief Justice Burger concurred in the judgment,\nbut did not write a separate opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                        54\n\n\fof “limited relevance” in analyzing the “single-shot” type\n\nof referendum facing the voters in Niagara County because\n\nthe “expression of voter will is direct” in a referendum.111\n\nSecond,     the     Court     found    significant         the    fact     that   the\n\nvoters within the cities and those outside the cities would\n\nbe   affected       differently       if    the    county    were    to     adopt    a\n\ncounty executive model of government.112                    The Court directly\n\ncompared      the      situation      at     hand    to     one     involving       an\n\nannexation        of   land    by     municipalities        and     the    distinct\n\ninterests that would exist in such a context.113                            Applying\n\nrational basis review, the Court went on to hold that the\n\nstatute’s      concurrent-majority                voting    provision        merely\n\nrecognized        “substantially       differing       electoral         interests”\n\nand that it did not amount to a violation of the Equal\n\nProtection Clause.114\n\n      Lockport         is   particularly          instructive       in     resolving\n\ndefendants’        equal      protection         claims.

The   expressed           will   of   the\n\nvoters       in   the        detachment       elections         will     be    direct     and\n\nunfiltered.\n\n       Like       the    Supreme        Court       in    Lockport,       I     also      find\n\nsignificant the existence of disparate electoral interests\n\nbetween city and township residents.                            In the present cases,\n\nit is undisputed that the voters in the townships and those\n\nin     the    cities         have     “substantially             differing       electoral\n\ninterests.”              If      the     detachments             are     approved,        one\n\nmunicipality           will    lose     land    and       others       will    gain    land,\n\nthereby implicating divergent interests in the city and the\n\ntownships on a wide range of issues, including police and\n\nfire protection, school districts, taxes, sewer systems,\n\nroad         construction,             commercial             development,           garbage\n\ncollection, etc.115 Indeed, the majority itself recognizes\n\nthis     fact      by        noting     the     “potential         for        dramatically\n\n\n\n\n       115\n             See, e.g., Lockport, supra at 269-271.\n\n\n\n\n                                              56\n\n\fdifferent           consequences”          among     municipalities         if   the\n\ndetachments are permitted.116\n\n        Given these differing electoral interests, I believe\n\nit is rational for the Legislature to permit the use of a\n\nsingle        detachment      petition      to     transfer   land     to   multiple\n\ntownships and that such a procedure does not violate the\n\nEqual Protection Clause.                   As the parties noted in their\n\nbriefs        and    at    oral     argument,      boundary    disputes      between\n\ntownships           and    cities    are    nothing     new.         Indeed,     such\n\ngamesmanship is not only commonplace, but to be expected\n\ngiven         the    inherently      valuable       nature    of     land   in   our\n\nsociety.             For    example,       cities    often     craft    annexation\n\nproposals with surgical precision so that the territory to\n\nbe acquired from a township contains one hundred or fewer\n\ninhabitants and is thus exempt from a public referendum.117\n\n\n        116\n              Ante at 10.\n        117\n        Amicus brief of the Michigan Townships Association\nat 2-3. As discussed in n 6 of this opinion, an annexation\nof territory that contains one hundred or fewer residents\nis subject only to approval by the SBC. MCL 117.9(4).\n\n     Justice Levin recognized the gamesmanship that occurs\nbetween cities and townships in Midland Twp, supra at 679,\nstating that “[c]ity and township strategies based on [the\none hundred-resident referendum threshold] are unavoidable.\nIn general, the city will seek to limit the area proposed\nfor annexation so that there are insufficient residents for\na referendum and the township will seek to extend the area\nto require a referendum. The motive or purpose of the city\n                                               (continued…)\n\n\n                                            57\n\n\fBy repeating this process numerous times, a city may be\n\nable to acquire large amounts of land without ever seeking\n\napproval from voters.\n\n       In light of such tactical territorial disputes between\n\ncities       and     townships,     it     is    not   irrational       for    the\n\nLegislature to permit several townships to amplify their\n\nvoting strength by combining several different parcels into\n\na     single       detachment      petition.           In    fact,     with    the\n\nsignificant population disparities that exist between large\n\ncities and small townships, such a bundled petition may be\n\nthe    only       way     that   certain       detachments    could     ever    be\n\neffectuated.            By permitting several townships to combine\n\nefforts in a single petition, the Legislature has simply\n\nrecognized         that    differing     electoral     interests      exist    and\n\nthat, occasionally, similar entities will need to combine\n\nforces       in    order    to   have    any    meaningful     opportunity      at\n\nadvancing          their    interests      and     achieving     the     various\n\nboundary changes authorized under the HRCA.118                         I believe\n\n\n\n(…continued)\n\nor township in drawing the proposed boundaries or                               in   \n\nrequesting a revision of boundaries is not material.” \n\n       118\n        In addition to minimizing the effects of population\ndisparities between cities and townships, there are\nnumerous other reasons why the Legislature may have\npermitted the use of a single petition to transfer land to\nmultiple townships.   For example, it is possible that the\n                                               (continued…)\n\n\n                                         58\n\n\fthat     such    a   view   by    the     Legislature    is   entirely\n\nreasonable.119\n\n       Lockport and Hunter demonstrate that the one-person,\n\none-vote     standard   does     not     apply   in   cases   involving\n\nmunicipal boundary changes as it does, for example, in the\n\ncontext of legislative representation.120             Instead, states\n\n\n\n(…continued)\nLegislature recognized the substantial financial expense\nthat townships and cities face when holding elections and\nthat, by combining numerous detachments in one election, it\nwould be less expensive for the taxpayers to have a single\nelection   than  to   have   several   separate  detachment\nelections.\n       119\n         I find the cases on which defendants rely\nunpersuasive. In Hayward v Clay, 573 F2d 187 (CA 4, 1978),\nthe Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals applied strict scrutiny\nto an annexation proceeding that required separate majority\napproval by freeholders. Hayward is easily distinguishable\nfrom the present cases.       Hayward involved a grant of\ndisproportionate voting strength to freeholders.     No such\nland-based distinction in voting strength exists in the\npresent cases.   Instead, the franchise is extended to all\nregistered   voters   in    the   affected   municipalities,\nregardless of land ownership status. Defendants also cite\nCarlyn v City of Akron, 726 F2d 287 (CA 6, 1984), in which\nthe Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals refused to apply strict\nscrutiny to an annexation proceeding.    While I appreciate\nthe dicta that defendants cite from Carlyn regarding when\nstrict scrutiny is to apply, I would choose instead to base\nour resolution of this federal law question on clear\nprecedent from the United States Supreme Court.\n       120\n          Indeed, Lockport and Hunter, taken together,\nillustrate that any claim of vote dilution in the municipal\nboundary change context will be difficult to sustain,\nabsent dilution based on some suspect category such as\nrace.   The Supreme Court explicitly rejected “dilution by\naggregation” in Hunter and “dilution by disproportionate\n                                               (continued…)\n\n\n                                   59\n\n\fmaintain broad discretion over municipal boundary changes—\n\ndiscretion that is subject to rational basis review.121               The\n\nfact    that   the   state   has   chosen    to    exercise   this   power\n\npartially through mechanisms provided under the HRCA, which\n\nincludes public referenda on privately initiated boundary\n\nchanges, in no way diminishes the state’s plenary control\n\nover    municipal    boundaries.          Therefore,   considering    the\n\ndiffering      electoral     interests      that    undoubtedly      exist\n\n\n\n(…continued)\nweight” in Lockport.    With both types of dilution having\nbeen flatly rejected by the Supreme Court, it seems quite\nclear that such cases are not viewed as traditional vote\ndilution matters, but as matters involving a state’s\nabsolute authority over municipal boundaries.\n       121\n         As Professor Briffault has written in discussing\nthe effect of Lockport:\n\n            To apply strict scrutiny to the distribution\n       of the vote concerning boundary changes would\n       inevitably entail a constitutional review of the\n       states’ municipal formation and boundary change\n       policies. But there are no generally accepted\n       principles for determining whether a particular\n       local government ought to exist, what that unit’s\n       geographic dimensions ought to be, or whether a\n       particular territory ought to be in that or\n       another local unit. Thus, deference to the states\n       is   consistent   with   both   the   lack   of   a\n       constitutional vantage point for examining state\n       municipal formation and boundary change policies\n       and the traditional jurisprudence of federalism\n       that    treats   local    governments   as    state\n       instrumentalities and leaves the creation and\n       structure of local governments to the states.\n       [Briffault, supra, 60 U Chi L R at 395-396.]\n\n\n\n\n                                    60\n\n\fbetween municipalities in a detachment proceeding and the\n\ngross disparities in population that arise, I believe that\n\nthe Legislature acted rationally in permitting, under the\n\nHRCA,         the   use   of     a   single         detachment        petition      when\n\ntransferring land to more than one municipality.\n\n        While       the   wisdom     of     such     a      policy   choice    by   the\n\nLegislature might be debated, this Court is not the proper\n\nforum for such an undertaking.                           Our role is limited to\n\ndetermining whether the HRCA conforms to the Constitution.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, I believe that it does.\n\n                               B.

PLAINTIFFS ARE NOT ENTITLED           TO   MANDAMUS RELIEF\n\n        While I agree with the majority that plaintiffs are\n\nnot     entitled         to    mandamus        relief,     I    disagree     with      the\n\nmajority’s rationale.               The majority concludes that mandamus\n\nrelief is improper because the HRCA does not permit the use\n\nof    a       single          detachment       petition        involving         multiple\n\ntownships and, therefore, plaintiffs have no “clear legal\n\nright” to the relief they seek.128                       For the reasons stated,\n\nI disagree with that conclusion.                      However, I believe that\n\nplaintiffs are not entitled to writs of mandamus because a\n\nrequest for such relief is premature at this time.\n\n        As already discussed, before a writ of mandamus will\n\nbe    issued,        a     plaintiff       must      complete         all   conditions\n\nprecedent to the act that the plaintiff seeks to compel.129\n\nWhile     it    is       possible       that    plaintiffs          may   have   already\n\nsatisfied        all      requirements           imposed       by     the   HRCA,      the\n\nSecretary of State has yet to make such a determination.\n\nThe   Secretary          of     State    deferred     her      examination        of   the\n\n\n\n(…continued)\n\nVan Buren Co Clerk, 290 Mich 180, 183-184; 287 NW 425\n\n(1939); Toan, supra at 34; Sumeracki, supra at 171; Gowan, \n\nsupra at 470-473. \n\n        128\n              Ante at 13.\n        129\n              See n 124 of this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                               63\n\n\fpetitions until the antecedent question of whether the HRCA\n\npermits the use of a single petition involving multiple\n\ntownships was resolved.              The Secretary of State has not yet\n\nexamined      the       petitions    to     determine       whether         they   comply\n\nwith all the other requirements of the HRCA.                                 Therefore,\n\nplaintiffs’ requests for mandamus relief are premature.\n\n                                    IV.    CONCLUSION\n\n       The HRCA is not ambiguous.                    A plain reading of §§ 9\n\nand 11 demonstrates that the use of a single detachment\n\npetition      is    permitted       when     seeking        to      transfer     land     to\n\nmultiple townships.             Moreover, such a procedure comports\n\nwith    the        Equal    Protection            Clause       of     the    Fourteenth\n\nAmendment.               Plaintiffs       are      not     entitled         to   mandamus\n\nrelief, however, because the Secretary of State has yet to\n\nexamine      the        petitions     to      determine           whether        all     the\n\nconditions         mandated    by     the         HRCA     have      been    satisfied.\n\nAccordingly, in Casco Twp, I would reverse the decisions of\n\nthe    Court       of    Appeals      and    the         trial      court    and       grant\n\ndeclaratory relief.           Because the plaintiffs in Fillmore Twp\n\ndid    not     seek      declaratory        relief,        I      would     affirm       the\n\ndismissal of their mandamus action.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully concur in\n\npart and dissent in part.\n\n                                             Robert P.

CAVANAGH, J.</p>\n<p>These consolidated appeals present two issues. First, we must address whether a single detachment petition and a single vote on that petition, pursuant to the terms of the Home Rule City Act, MCL 117.1 <i>et seq.,</i> may encompass territory to be detached from one city and added to more than one township.<sup>[1]</sup> Second, if a single detachment petition and a single vote may encompass territory to be added to more than one township, we must determine whether a writ of mandamus compels the Secretary of State to issue a notice directing an election on the change of boundaries sought by plaintiffs in each case. Because we conclude that the Home Rule City Act does not allow a single detachment petition and a single vote on detachment for adding territory to multiple townships, mandamus is not proper in these cases. Accordingly, the decisions of the Court of Appeals are affirmed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. STATEMENT OF FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Casco Twp. v. Secretary of State</i></h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs in this case are two adjacent townships-Casco Township and Columbus Township-and residents of those townships who seek to detach territory from defendant city of Richmond. The territory sought to be detached is territory that was previously annexed to the city of Richmond.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs seek to present the ballot issue covering both townships in a single petition. This would result in a single vote about whether to detach territory from the city of Richmond and add the territory to Casco Township and Columbus Township. The residents of one township would be voting on the return of property to their township, as well as the return of property to a township in which they do not reside. The Secretary of State refused to approve an election on plaintiffs' petition because an election on the petition would allow residents of one township to vote on, and possibly determine, a change in the boundaries of another township in which they do not reside.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs filed a complaint for mandamus and declaratory relief. The circuit court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint for mandamus to compel the Secretary of State to act because it was not clear that a single petition seeking detachment from a city and addition of the territory to two townships was permitted by the Home Rule City Act. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the circuit court. <i>Casco Twp. v. Secretary of State,</i> 261 Mich.App. 386, 682 N.W.2d 546 (2004). We granted plaintiffs' application for leave to appeal and ordered that the case be argued and submitted with <i>Fillmore Twp. v. Secretary of State,</i> 471 Mich. 890, 688 N.W.2d 281 (2004).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Fillmore Twp. v. Secretary of State</i></h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs are Fillmore Township and electors from four townships-Fillmore Township, Holland Charter Township, Park Township, and Laketown Township-and the city of Holland who want to detach territory from the city of Holland and add the territory to the four townships. Plaintiffs filed a joint detachment petition with the Secretary of State, asking that the petition be certified and that a single election be held regarding the territory that was proposed to be detached from the city of Holland. The Secretary of State refused to certify the petition because the petition involved an effort to detach territory <span class=\"star-pagination\">*105</span> for addition to more than one township.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs filed a complaint for mandamus in the Court of Appeals, and the complaint was held in abeyance pending the decision in the <i>Casco Twp.</i> case. Unpublished order, entered May 19, 2003 (Docket No. 245640). Plaintiffs' complaint was subsequently denied by the Court of Appeals on the basis of the <i>Casco Twp.</i> decision. Unpublished order, 2004 WL 2374737, entered May 6, 2004 (Docket No. 245640). We granted plaintiffs' application for leave to appeal and ordered that the case be argued and submitted with the <i>Casco Twp.</i> case. 471 Mich. 890, 688 N.W.2d 281 (2004).<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</h2>\n<p>The proper interpretation of a statutory provision is a question of law that this Court reviews de novo. <i>Lincoln v. Gen. Motors Corp.,</i> 461 Mich. 483, 489-490, 607 N.W.2d 73 (2000). A trial court's decision regarding a writ of mandamus is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <i>In re MCI Telecom. Complaint,</i> 460 Mich. 396, 443, 596 N.W.2d 164 (1999).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>These cases involve an issue of statutory interpretation. The primary goal of statutory interpretation is to give effect to the intent of the Legislature. <i>Id.</i> at 411, 596 N.W.2d 164. The first step is to review the language of the statute. If the statutory language is unambiguous, the Legislature is presumed to have intended the meaning expressed in the statute and judicial construction is not permissible.</p>\n<p>The Home Rule City Act, MCL 117.1 <i>et seq.,</i> addresses four processes-incorporation, consolidation, annexation, and detachment.<sup>[3]</sup> The issue before this Court pertains only to the process of detachment. Detachment means that territory is taken from an existing city and added to an existing township.</p>\n<p>Section 6 of the Home Rule City Act, MCL 117.6, provides that a detachment be initiated by \"proceedings originating by petition therefor signed by <i>qualified electors</i> who are freeholders residing within the cities, villages, or townships to be affected thereby ....\" (Emphasis added.) Notably, MCL 117.8 and MCL 117.11 delineate the procedure for submitting a petition for a change of boundaries. MCL 117.8(1) provides in relevant part that \"the board shall, by resolution, provide that the question of making the proposed incorporation, consolidation, or change of boundaries be submitted to the <i>qualified electors</i> of the district to be affected at the next general election or at a special election before the next general election.\" (Emphasis added.) Likewise, MCL 117.11(2) provides that \"the question of making the incorporation, consolidation, or change of boundaries petitioned for shall be submitted to the <i>electors</i> of the district to be affected.\" (Emphasis added.) Michigan election law defines a qualified elector as \"any person who possesses the qualifications of an elector as prescribed in section 1 of article 2 of the state constitution and who has resided in the city or township 30 days.\"<sup>[4]</sup> MCL 168.10.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*106</span> Because Casco Township voters do not reside in Columbus Township, they are not \"qualified electors\" of Columbus Township who can sign a petition and vote on the detachment of territory from the city of Richmond for addition of the territory to Columbus Township. Likewise, because Columbus Township voters do not reside in Casco Township, they are not \"qualified electors\" of Casco Township who can sign a petition and vote on the detachment of territory from the city of Richmond for addition of the territory to Casco Township. Therefore, a single petition and a single vote on multiple detachments violate the statutory language of the Home Rule City Act.</p>\n<p>Additional support for this position is found in the statutory language used in other parts of the Home Rule City Act. MCL 117.9(1) defines the \"district to be affected\" as the following: \"The district to be affected by every such proposed incorporation, consolidation, or <i>change</i> of boundaries shall be deemed to include the whole of each city, village, or township from which <i>territory</i> is to be taken or to which <i>territory</i> is to be annexed.\" (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>A <i>change</i> of boundaries for the district to be affected encompasses only one city and one township because a township's voters can be qualified electors only in relation to their own township's proposed change of boundaries and are <i>affected</i> only by their own township's proposed change of boundaries. Therefore, it is only plausible that the \"district to be affected\" encompasses one city and one township. Accordingly, a single detachment petition and a single vote may only encompass territory to be added to one township.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Language in MCL 117.13, which sets forth the procedure following an election, further supports the principle that each township is considered a separate entity and there must be separate votes with respect to the territory to be detached from one city and added to each township. MCL 117.13 states, \"Territory detached from any city shall thereupon become a part of the township or village from which it was originally taken....\" This indicates that the \"district to be affected\" is limited to the city in which the territory is located and the single township that seeks the return of the territory.</p>\n<p>Further, interpreting the \"district to be affected\" in detachment proceedings as the city from which the territory is to be detached and the township to which the territory is to be added recognizes that the consequences of detachment may be quite different for each township that seeks to gain property. For example, property rights and liabilities must be adjusted between the city and the township when there is a detachment. MCL 123.1. Debts must be apportioned and land may <span class=\"star-pagination\">*107</span> need to be sold. MCL 123.2; MCL 123.3. The potential for dramatically different consequences of detachment are clearly indicated in the <i>Fillmore Twp.</i> case. Four townships seek to detach land from the city of Holland. The Fillmore Township parcel is 1,054 acres, the Holland Charter Township parcel is 3.33 acres, the Park Township parcel is 1.27 acres, and the Laketown Township parcel is 0.77 acres. It is reasonable to conclude that the effect of detachment will be quite different when one parcel is 1,054 acres and one parcel is a mere 0.77 acres.</p>\n<p>Moreover, allowing a single petition and a single vote on detachment from one city for the addition of territory to multiple townships does not allow voters to render a vote in support of the addition of territory to only one township. MCL 168.643a requires, in relevant part, the following:</p>\n<blockquote>A question submitted to the electors of this state or the electors of a subdivision of this state shall, to the extent that it will not confuse the electorate, be worded so that a \"yes\" vote will be a vote in favor of the subject matter of the proposal or issue and a \"no\" vote will be a vote against the subject matter of the proposal or issue.</blockquote>\n<p>However, a single vote on detaching territory from one city and adding the territory to multiple townships does not allow a voter who may only favor one of the multiple additions of territory to cast a \"yes\" vote. As stated by this Court in <i>Muskegon Pub. Schools v. Vander Laan,</i> 211 Mich. 85, 87, 178 N.W. 424 (1920), \"Separate subjects, separate purposes, or independent propositions should not be combined so that one may gather votes for the other.\" In <i>Vander Laan,</i> this Court noted that the erection of three new school buildings showed a common purpose and were part of a comprehensive plan to meet the educational needs of the city. In contrast, we find that detaching territory from one city and adding the territory to multiple townships does not indicate a common purpose because the needs and consequences of the additions to various townships may differ remarkably. Combining multiple additions of territory in a single detachment petition so that there is only a single vote indeed combines independent propositions \"so that one may gather votes for the other.\"</p>\n<p>When put into context, the text of the Home Rule City Act is unambiguous-a petition and a vote about detachment must involve only one city and one township. A contrary reading of the statutory language belies the fact that there will <i>always</i> be two parties to a detachment-the city and the township. Justice Young's focus on the word \"each\" in the statute ignores that the provisions must be read in context. Interpreting the word \"each\" to mean that a detachment petition can encompass more than one township is contrary to the statutory language that relates to qualified electors and ignores the fact that the Home Rule City Act encompasses four distinct procedures-incorporation, consolidation, annexation, and detachment. Language in the statute that at first may appear to indicate that multiple townships may be involved in a single detachment petition and a single vote must be read in context and in consideration of the statutory language regarding qualified electors. Significantly, residents of one township are not qualified electors in a detachment proceeding when it comes to determining a change of boundaries for another township, and the statute cannot properly be interpreted in this manner.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*108</span> Further, Justice Young's reliance on this Court's decision in <i>Walsh v. Secretary of State,</i> 355 Mich. 570, 574, 95 N.W.2d 511 (1959), is misplaced. <i>Walsh</i> dealt with annexation, not detachment. Notably, in the multiple-township annexation at issue in <i>Walsh,</i> the votes of each territory were considered separately. In essence, a single township could \"veto\" the annexation from taking place, no matter how many voters approved of the annexation in other townships. In contrast, in the detachment procedure at issue in these cases, the voters in a township have no \"veto\" power. The wishes of an entire township could effectively be ignored because voters in other townships believe that a detachment would be in their best interests. The \"package\" proposal in <i>Walsh</i> is hardly analogous to the detachment proceedings at issue in these cases.</p>\n<p>Our conclusion that a single detachment petition and a single vote on that petition may only encompass territory to be added to one township is in accord with the unambiguous statutory language. Thus, the Legislature is presumed to have intended the meaning expressed in the statute and judicial construction is not permissible.</p>\n<p>Finally, a writ of mandamus could be properly issued in these cases only if plaintiffs proved that (1) they had a clear legal right to the performance of the specific duty that they sought to be compelled, and (2) the Secretary of State had a clear legal duty to perform the act. <i>In re MCI, supra</i> at 442-443, 596 N.W.2d 164. Because the Home Rule City Act does not allow a single detachment petition and a single vote on that petition to encompass territory to be detached from one city and added to more than one township, there was no clear legal right to have the Secretary of State authorize each petition for a single vote. Therefore, there was no clear legal duty that required the Secretary of State to act, and the writs of mandamus were properly denied in both cases before this Court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The Home Rule City Act, MCL 117.1 <i>et seq.,</i> does not allow a single petition and a single vote to encompass detachment of territory from a city for the addition of that territory to multiple townships; thus, the Secretary of State did not have a clear legal duty to act. Therefore, mandamus was not an appropriate remedy. Accordingly, the decisions of the Court of Appeals are affirmed.</p>\n<p>YOUNG, J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>We granted leave to appeal in these consolidated cases to determine whether (1) the Home Rule City Act (HRCA)<sup>[1]</sup> permits the use of a single detachment petition and election when the territory to be detached from a city is to be transferred to more than one township and, (2) if such a procedure is allowed under the HRCA, whether plaintiffs<sup>[2]</sup> are entitled to mandamus relief. I agree with the majority that plaintiffs are not entitled to writs of mandamus because I believe that any request for mandamus relief is premature at this time. I disagree, however, with the majority's conclusion that the HRCA does not permit the use of a single detachment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*109</span> petition and vote thereon when transferring land to multiple townships.</p>\n<p>The Legislature was well aware of the political gamesmanship that occurs between municipalities in the context of boundary disputes. Indeed, our Constitution was changed to free the Legislature from this political quagmire.<sup>[3]</sup> By enacting the HRCA, the Legislature established a standardized procedure to effectuate such changes in a manner that it viewed as fair and reasonable. A plain reading of <i>all</i> relevant language in the HRCA demonstrates that the use of a single detachment petition when transferring land to multiple townships is permitted. The Court of Appeals focused only on select text in the HRCA and thereby gave the statute a particular meaning that is insupportable when one considers <i>all</i> the language used by the Legislature in the HRCA. Its exercise in selective statutory interpretation not only undermines the Legislature's intent in passing the HRCA, but also injects the judiciary-armed only with ill-defined notions of \"fairness\" and \"justice\"-as a referee in the inherently political, contentious, and tactical process of altering municipal boundaries. The majority opinion, while avoiding explicit reliance on extra-textual policy justifications, does not, in my view, give full meaning to all the relevant words in the statute.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the majority's conclusion that a single detachment petition involving multiple townships is not permitted under the HRCA. In <i>Casco Twp.,</i> I would grant the plaintiffs' request for declaratory relief and deny their claim for a writ of mandamus. In <i>Fillmore Twp.,</i> because the plaintiffs only sought a writ of mandamus, I would deny entirely their request for relief.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>\n<p>The majority fails to convey adequately the true character of the boundary disputes at issue. By glossing over much of the relevant history, the majority understates the inherently political and calculated nature of the disputes.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. CASCO TWP. v. SECRETARY OF STATE</h2>\n<p>The land at issue in this case has a long, contentious history. In July 1996, intervening defendants, Walter and Patricia Winkle, filed a petition with the State Boundary Commission (SBC) seeking to annex to the city of Richmond approximately 157 acres of land that they and other residents owned in Casco Township and Columbus Township. The Winkles hoped to develop their land for commercial use, but believed that commercial development could not occur unless their property was connected to the water and sewer lines offered by the city of Richmond.</p>\n<p>Before the Winkles' July 1996 petition, however, Columbus Township and neighboring Lenox Township had entered into an agreement pursuant to 1984 PA 425 to transfer land from Columbus Township to Lenox Township.<sup>[5]</sup> A similar 425 agreement <span class=\"star-pagination\">*110</span> was reached between Casco Township and Lenox Township. These 425 agreements were designed to prevent future annexations, such as the one initiated by the Winkles in July 1996. In November 1997, the SBC determined that the 425 agreements were invalid and decided instead to approve the annexation petition filed by the Winkles.<sup>[6]</sup> After protracted litigation, the SBC's decision was eventually upheld by the Court of Appeals.<sup>[7]</sup> The Court of Appeals found that the 425 agreements between the townships of Columbus, Casco, and Lenox were \"sham[s]\" and \"essentially an attempt to avoid annexation,\" and upheld the SBC's decision approving the annexation initiated by the Winkles.<sup>[8]</sup> In July 2001, this Court denied leave to appeal.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>In December 2001, plaintiffs filed a single detachment petition with the Secretary of State, seeking to transfer from the city of Richmond to Casco Township and Columbus Township the same land that was involved in the prior annexation.<sup>[10]</sup> The disputed territory consisted of approximately eighty-seven acres in Casco Township and seventy acres in Columbus Township.</p>\n<p>Unsure whether the HRCA permitted the use of a single detachment petition to transfer land to multiple townships, the Secretary of State requested an official opinion from the Attorney General interpreting the HRCA. Citing a pending lawsuit in Eaton County, Michigan, involving a factually similar dispute,<sup>[11]</sup> and the Attorney General's policy of declining to issue opinions that might affect ongoing litigation, the Attorney General refused to issue a formal opinion construing the HRCA. However, in a May 2002 memorandum to the Department of State, Bureau of Elections, the Attorney General's Office provided \"informal advice\" regarding the use of a single detachment petition. Recognizing that there were \"no cases directly on point that specifically address the issue,\" the memorandum informed the Department of State that it was \"reasonable to refuse to certify\" the petition.<sup>[12]</sup> The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*111</span> Secretary of State subsequently notified the plaintiffs that she would not certify the detachment petition.</p>\n<p>The following month, the plaintiffs filed a complaint in the Ingham Circuit Court, seeking declaratory and mandamus relief against the defendants. After holding a hearing, the circuit court denied the plaintiffs' request for mandamus relief, ruling that the HRCA was not \"patently clear\" regarding whether a single detachment petition may be used to transfer land to more than one township. The circuit court then dismissed the plaintiffs' lawsuit without having addressed their request for declaratory relief.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Appeals, claiming that the circuit court erred in denying their request for mandamus relief and in dismissing their lawsuit without deciding their request for declaratory relief. In divided opinions, the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the circuit court.<sup>[13]</sup> The Court of Appeals majority held that the HRCA was ambiguous as to whether a single detachment petition was permitted. Given the ambiguity, the majority decided that it \"must consider the object of the statute and apply a reasonable construction that is logical and best accomplishes the HRCA's purpose.\"<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p>Acknowledging that there was \"no case law that directly addresse[d] the current situation,\"<sup>[15]</sup> the majority concluded that it was \"clearly unfair\" to allow the use of a single detachment petition when transferring land to multiple townships.<sup>[16]</sup> Accordingly, the Court of Appeals denied the plaintiffs' request for mandamus relief. The Court of Appeals further held that the circuit court had \"implicitly\" denied the plaintiffs' request for declaratory relief and affirmed the circuit court's ruling denying declaratory relief.<sup>[17]</sup> The dissent disagreed with the majority's conclusion that the HRCA was ambiguous and noted that the plain text of the HRCA permitted the use of a single detachment petition to transfer land to multiple townships. We granted leave to appeal and consolidated the case with <i>Fillmore Twp. v. Secretary of State</i><i>.</i><sup>[18]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. FILLMORE TWP. v. SECRETARY OF STATE</h2>\n<p>As with the territory involved in the companion case of <i>Casco Twp. v. Secretary of State</i><i>,</i> the disputed territory in this case also has a complex history. In 1997, Fillmore Township and the city of Holland entered into a 425 agreement through which land in Fillmore Township was to be transferred to Holland. Pursuant to the referendum provision in 1984 PA 425, qualified electors in Fillmore Township filed a petition calling for a referendum on the 425 agreement with the city of Holland. The voters ultimately defeated the 425 agreement in the referendum.</p>\n<p>Several months after the 425 agreement was defeated, in late 1998, landowners in Fillmore Township filed petitions with the SBC to annex approximately 1,100 acres to the city of Holland. The SBC approved the annexation, thereby transferring approximately 1,100 acres from Fillmore Township to Holland. Seeking to reverse the annexation effected by the SBC's decision, in February 2000, electors in Fillmore Township filed a petition with the Secretary of State to detach the land that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*112</span> was previously annexed. In August 2000, voters in Fillmore and Holland defeated the detachment proposal by a vote of 3,917 to 2,614.</p>\n<p>In October 2002, the plaintiffs submitted a single detachment petition to the Secretary of State,<sup>[19]</sup> again hoping to detach from the city of Holland the territory that was previously annexed from Fillmore Township. In addition to the Fillmore Township-city of Holland detachment, however, the petition also included three smaller detachments by which land would be detached from the city of Holland and added to Laketown Township, Park Township, and Holland Charter Township. Because the HRCA provides that \"the <i>whole</i> of each city, village, or township\" to be affected by the detachment is entitled to vote,<sup>[20]</sup> by adding the additional three townships to the single detachment petition, the voting base for the detachment election was greatly expanded.</p>\n<p>The following table summarizes the acreage to be transferred by the detachment and the number of voters that would be added to the voting base by including each additional township in the single detachment petition:<sup>[21]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\n                          Acres To Be\n                         Received from      Registered Voters\n  Municipality           the Detachment   (as of November 2002)\n  City of Holland           - - - -              19,771\n  Fillmore Township          1,054                1,854\n  Laketown Township          0.77                 4,166\n  Holland Charter Township   3.33                15,221\n  Park Township              1.27                11,989\n</pre>\n<p>Thus, by including the three additional townships and detaching only an extra 5.37 acres, the voting base of the district to be affected would be expanded by an additional 31,376 voters over what the voting base would be if only Fillmore Township and the city of Holland were involved.</p>\n<p>In November 2002, the Secretary of State refused to certify the detachment petition, relying on the September 2002 decision by the circuit court disallowing the use of a single detachment petition in <i>Casco Twp.</i> In response to the Secretary of State's refusal to certify the petition, the plaintiffs filed an original mandamus action in the Court of Appeals seeking to have the Court order the Secretary of State to certify the petition and schedule an election. The Court of Appeals ordered that the plaintiffs' case be held in abeyance pending its resolution of <i>Casco Twp.</i> In March 2004, the Court of Appeals issued its opinion in <i>Casco Twp.,</i> affirming the circuit court's decision disallowing the use of a single detachment petition. Citing its opinion in <i>Casco Twp.,</i> the Court of Appeals then denied the plaintiffs mandamus relief by order in May 2004.<sup>[22]</sup> We granted leave to appeal and consolidated the case with <i>Casco Twp. v. Secretary of State</i><i>.</i><sup>[23]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*113</span> II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</h2>\n<p>Whether the HRCA permits the use of a single detachment petition to transfer land to multiple townships is a matter of statutory interpretation, which is a question of law that is reviewed by this Court de novo.<sup>[24]</sup> The constitutionality of the HRCA's detachment procedure is also a question of law that is subject to review de novo.<sup>[25]</sup> This Court reviews a lower court's decision regarding a request for mandamus relief for an abuse of discretion.<sup>[26]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. THE HRCA AND THE SINGLE DETACHMENT PROCEDURE</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. HISTORY OF THE HRCA</h2>\n<p>The HRCA, enacted in 1909, is an intricate statute that has been amended in piecemeal fashion numerous times over the past century. Before the enactment of the HRCA, the Legislature directly enacted municipal boundary changes on a case-by-case basis through special legislation. Delegates to the 1907-1908 constitutional convention recognized the substantial burden this process imposed, as well as the confusion that resulted from hundreds of pieces of such special legislation. The convention's Address to the People stated:</p>\n<blockquote>One of the greatest evils brought to the attention of the Convention was the abuse practiced under local and special legislation. The number of local and special bills passed by the last legislature was <i>four hundred fourteen,</i> not including joint and concurrent resolutions. The time devoted to the consideration of these measures and the time required in their passage through the two houses imposed a serious burden upon the state. This section [prohibiting the enactment of special acts when a general act can be made applicable], taken in connection with the increased powers of local self-government granted to cities and villages in the revision, seeks to effectively remedy such condition.... The evils of local and special legislation have grown to be almost intolerable, introducing uncertainty and confusion into the laws, and consuming the time and energy of the legislature which should be devoted to the consideration of measures of a general character. By eliminating this mass of legislation, the work of the legislature will be greatly simplified and improved.<sup>[27]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>Based on this overwhelming dissatisfaction with special legislation as a means <span class=\"star-pagination\">*114</span> to adjust municipal boundaries, delegates to the 1907-1908 constitutional convention debated whether to direct the Legislature to enact a general municipal boundary statute that would provide a framework for all future municipal boundary changes. The delegates proposed, and the people of Michigan eventually ratified, Const. 1908, art. 8, § 20, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote>The legislature shall provide by a general law for the incorporation of cities, and by a general law for the incorporation of villages ....</blockquote>\n<p>With art. 8, § 20 as a constitutional mandate, the Legislature enacted the HRCA the following year in order to establish a comprehensive, standardized procedure for initiating and approving all changes to municipal boundaries, including incorporations, annexations, detachments, and consolidations.<sup>[28]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF THE HRCA</h2>\n<p>As the majority correctly notes, three provisions of the HRCA are directly relevant in the present case. The detachment process is specifically authorized by § 6 of the HRCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote>Cities may be incorporated or <i>territory detached therefrom</i> or added thereto, or consolidation made of 2 or more cities or villages into 1 city, or of a city and 1 or more villages into 1 city, or of 1 or more cities or villages together with additional territory not included within any incorporated city or village into 1 city, by proceedings originating by petition therefor signed by qualified electors who are freeholders residing within the cities, villages, or townships to be affected thereby. . . .<sup>[29]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>However, because both the city of Richmond and the city of Holland are located in more than one county, rather than filing their detachment petitions with the county under § 6, plaintiffs in both cases were required to file their petitions with the Secretary of State pursuant to § 11 of the HRCA. At the time of the present lawsuits, § 11 provided:</p>\n<blockquote>When the territory to be affected by any proposed incorporation, consolidation, or change is situated in more than 1 county the petition hereinbefore provided shall be addressed and presented to the secretary of state, with 1 or more affidavits attached thereto sworn to by 1 or more of the signers of said petition, showing that the statements contained in said petition are true, that each signature affixed thereto is the genuine signature of a qualified elector residing in a city, village, or township to be affected by the carrying out of the purposes of the petition and that not less than 25 or such signers reside in each city, village or township to be affected thereby. The secretary of state shall examine such petition and the affidavit or affidavits annexed, and if he shall find that the same conforms to the provisions of this act he shall so certify, and transmit a certified copy of said petition and the accompanying affidavit or affidavits to the clerk of <i>each</i> city, village or township to be affected by the carrying out of the purposes of such petition, together with his certificate as above provided, and a notice directing that at the next general election occurring not less than 40 days thereafter the question of making the incorporation, consolidation or change of boundaries petitioned for, shall be submitted to the electors of <i>the district to be affected,</i> and if no general election is to be held within 90 days the resolution may fix a date preceding the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*115</span> next general election for a special election on the question. If he shall find that said petition and the affidavit or affidavits annexed thereto do not conform to the provisions of this act he shall certify to that fact, and return said petition and affidavits to the person from whom they were received, together with such certificate. The <i>several</i> city, village and township clerks who shall receive from the secretary of state the copies and certificates above provided for shall give notice of the election to be held on the question of making the proposed incorporation, consolidation or change of boundaries as provided for in section 10 of this act.<sup>[30]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>Lastly, the phrase \"district to be affected,\" as used in § 11, is defined by § 9 of the HRCA:</p>\n<blockquote>The district to be affected by the proposed incorporation, consolidation, or change of boundaries is considered to include the whole of <i>each</i> city, village, or township from which territory is to be taken or to which territory is to be annexed.<sup>[31]</sup></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. PRINCIPLES OF STATUTORY INTERPRETATION</h2>\n<p>When interpreting a statute, a court's duty is to give effect to the intent of the Legislature based on the actual words used in the statute.<sup>[32]</sup> If the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, no further construction is necessary or permitted.<sup>[33]</sup> The statute is enforced as written.<sup>[34]</sup> It is the duty of the judiciary to interpret, not write, the law.<sup>[35]</sup></p>\n<p>In <i>Lansing Mayor v. Pub. Service Comm</i><i>.,</i> this Court repudiated prior case law that held that a statute is ambiguous if it is susceptible to more than one meaning or if \"reasonable minds can differ\" regarding the statute's meaning.<sup>[36]</sup> Instead, as this Court stated in <i>Lansing Mayor,</i> a statutory provision is ambiguous only if it \"`irreconcilably conflict[s]' with another provision, or when it is <i>equally</i> susceptible to more than a single meaning.\"<sup>[37]</sup> In ascertaining whether an ambiguity exists, therefore, a court must employ conventional rules of construction and \"give effect to every word, phrase, and clause in a statute.\"<sup>[38]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. THE PLAIN TEXT OF THE HRCA PERMITS THE USE OF A SINGLE DETACHMENT PETITION TO TRANSFER LAND TO MULTIPLE TOWNSHIPS</h2>\n<p>At its core, the Court of Appeals opinion in <i>Casco Twp.</i> represents a deliberate decision <span class=\"star-pagination\">*116</span> to subordinate the actual text of the HRCA in favor of the Court of Appeals' own abstract notions of fairness and justice. By choosing to give meaning to only <i>some</i> of the words in the HRCA and ignoring others, the Court of Appeals substituted its conception of \"fairness\" for the policy determination made by the Legislature in writing the HRCA.<sup>[39]</sup> While this à la carte method of statutory interpretation that focuses only on certain words in a statute is extraordinarily effective at allowing a court to reach a conclusion that it views as \"fair\" or \"just,\" it is an affront to the separation of powers principle. As this Court has stated numerous times, it is the duty of the judiciary to effectuate the intent of the Legislature by giving effect to every \"word, phrase, and clause in a statute.\"<sup>[40]</sup></p>\n<p>A close analysis of the text of the HRCA demonstrates that the statute is not ambiguous and that a single detachment petition may be used to detach land from a city and add it to multiple townships. Although the majority focuses extensively on § 9 of the HRCA,<sup>[41]</sup> the majority notably fails to give full effect to the Legislature's use of the word \"each\" in § 9.</p>\n<p>The section of the HRCA under which plaintiffs filed their petitions, § 11, provides that \"the question of making the incorporation, consolidation or change of boundaries petitioned for, shall be submitted to the electors of <i>the district to be affected</i>....\"<sup>[42]</sup> Under § 9, the HRCA defines \"the district to be affected\" as \"includ[ing] the whole of <i>each</i> city, village, or township from which territory is to be taken or to which territory is to be annexed.\"<sup>[43]</sup> By defining \"the district to be affected\" as including the whole of \"each\" city, village, or township, the Legislature contemplated that \"the district to be affected\" could include <i>multiple</i> townships in a detachment proceeding.</p>\n<p>The word \"each\" is not defined in the HRCA. Pursuant to MCL 8.3a, undefined statutory terms are to be given their plain and ordinary meaning, unless, of course, the undefined word is a term of art.<sup>[44]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*117</span> Because \"each\" is not a term of art, this Court must therefore give the word its plain meaning. As this Court stated in <i>Horace v. City of Pontiac,</i><sup>[45]</sup> \"[w]hen considering a nonlegal word or phrase that is not defined within a statute, resort to a layman's dictionary ... is appropriate.\"<sup>[46]</sup> Moreover, it is appropriate to use a dictionary from the period contemporaneous to the statute's enactment in order to give full effect to the intent of the Legislature that enacted the statute.<sup>[47]</sup></p>\n<p>Although the HRCA has been amended frequently over the past century, the relevant provisions of §§ 9 and 11 have remained unchanged in the HRCA since 1909, the year the HRCA was originally enacted. The word \"each\" is defined by <i>The New American Encyclopedic Dictionary</i> as \"<i>every</i> one of a number considered separately, <i>all.</i>\"<sup>[48]</sup><i>The Century Dictionary</i> defines \"each\" as \"Being either or any unit of a numerical aggregate consisting of two <i>or more,</i> indefinitely.\"<sup>[49]</sup><i>Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary of the English Language</i> defines \"each\" as \"Being one of two <i>or more ... Every</i> one of any number or aggregation....\"<sup>[50]</sup></p>\n<p>It is clear, therefore, that the word \"each,\" as used in 1909, means \"all\" and \"every,\" and plainly encompasses <i>multiple</i> entities. Indeed, by using \"each\" in § 9, the Legislature effectively said, as a definitional matter, that \"the district to be affected\" is to be comprised of \"all\" or \"every\" city, village, or township affected by the boundary change. The \"district\" is not limited to a predetermined number, but rather includes <i>every</i> municipal entity from which territory is to be taken or to which territory is to be added. Thus, while \"the district to be affected\" can certainly contain just two municipal entities, it can also include <i>more than</i> two entities.<sup>[51]</sup></p>\n<p>Defendants argue that the Legislature's use of the word \"each\" is not determinative because, by using \"each,\" the Legislature was simply referring to the two municipal entities that necessarily must be involved in any detachment proceeding: the city that will lose the land and the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*118</span> township that will gain the land.<sup>[52]</sup> Defendants' argument is unpersuasive. Had the Legislature intended \"each\" to refer only to the two sides involved in a typical detachment proceeding-the donor city and the recipient township-and not to multiple recipient townships, the Legislature would have used the word \"both,\" not \"each.\"<sup>[53]</sup> The Legislature, however, did not limit \"the district to be affected\" to only two municipal entities by using the word \"both.\" Instead, it deliberately used the distributive adjective \"each,\" thereby referring to <i>every</i> municipality affected. It is only by assuming that \"each\" refers exclusively to the donor and recipient municipalities in a <i>conventional</i> detachment proceeding that the majority position may be sustained. There is no textual basis for making this assumption or otherwise limiting the customary meaning of \"each.\"<sup>[54]</sup></p>\n<p>This construction of the HRCA is bolstered by the fact that, throughout § 11, the words \"petition\" and \"election\" are used in the singular even though the words \"each\" and \"several\" are used in the same sentences when modifying \"city, village or township.\" For example, § 11 states that the Secretary of State must transmit \"a certified copy of said <i>petition</i> ... to the clerk of <i>each</i> city, village or township to be affected by the carrying out of the purposes of such <i>petition</i>....\"<sup>[55]</sup> Section 11 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*119</span> further provides that \"[t]he <i>several</i> city, village and township clerks ... shall give notice of <i>the election</i> to be held....\"<sup>[56]</sup> While it is true that MCL 8.3b states that, in construing statutes, \"[e]very word importing the singular number only may extend to and embrace the plural number,\" it is important to remember that MCL 8.3b is <i>permissive,</i> not mandatory. MCL 8.3b states only that the singular \"may\" extend to the plural.</p>\n<p>This Court addressed MCL 8.3b in <i>Robinson,</i> in which we construed the phrase \"<i>the</i> proximate cause\" within the context of the governmental immunity statute.<sup>[57]</sup> As we noted in <i>Robinson,</i> MCL 8.3b \"only states that a word importing the singular number `may extend' to the plural. The statute does not say that such an automatic understanding is required.\"<sup>[58]</sup> We went on to hold that MCL 8.3 \"provides that the rule stated in § 3b shall be observed `unless such construction would be inconsistent with the manifest intent of the Legislature.'\"<sup>[59]</sup> This Court concluded that because the Legislature chose to use the definite article \"the\" within the phrase \"the proximate cause,\" it \"clearly evince[d] an intent to focus on <i>one</i> cause.\"<sup>[60]</sup></p>\n<p>The same is true in the present case. In § 11, the Legislature consistently referred to \"petition\" in the singular and used the phrase \"<i>the</i> election.\" There is no principled basis by which to say that \"the\" means \"one\" in <i>Robinson,</i> but \"the\" does not mean \"one\" when referring to \"<i>the</i> election\" mandated by § 11.</p>\n<p>Taken together, all of these textual clues demonstrate that the HRCA permits the use of a <i>single</i> detachment petition and election when transferring land to more than one township. Unlike the majority, which focuses only on select words in the HRCA, I believe that this Court is obligated to give effect to <i>every</i> word the Legislature used in writing the HRCA. I would hold, therefore, that the Court of Appeals erred in finding that the HRCA is ambiguous. No provision of the HRCA conflicts, irreconcilably or otherwise, with any other provision of the HRCA. Nor is the HRCA <i>equally</i> susceptible to more than a single meaning. A plain reading of §§ 9 and 11 demonstrates that the procedure used by plaintiffs in the present cases is permissible under the HRCA.</p>\n<p>The majority casually dismisses this Court's decision in <i>Walsh v. Secretary of State,</i><sup>[61]</sup> which explicitly recognized and permitted a single petition for a multiple-municipality annexation under the HRCA. In <i>Walsh,</i> we examined §§ 9 and 11 of the HRCA. The case involved an annexation by the city of Lansing in which it sought to acquire four parcels of land from Lansing Township and one parcel situated in both Lansing Township and Delta Township. A <i>single</i> petition was filed with the Secretary <span class=\"star-pagination\">*120</span> of State for this multiple-township annexation. Although voters in the city of Lansing and Lansing Township approved the annexation, voters in Delta Township did not.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs in <i>Walsh</i> argued that the annexation attempt was divisible and that we should approve the annexation of the parcels in Lansing Township, given that the Lansing Township voters approved the annexation. This Court disagreed. We held that the annexation was a \"package proposition\" and that, under the vote tabulation provisions of § 9 in effect at the time, if any one of the \"voting units\" voted against the proposal, the whole proposal failed.<sup>[62]</sup></p>\n<p>While it is true that <i>Walsh</i> involved an analogous annexation rather than a detachment, and that the primary focus in <i>Walsh</i> was on the vote tabulation provisions of the HRCA, not the definition of \"district to be affected,\" this Court accepted the use of a single \"package\" petition even though the land that was to be annexed consisted of five distinct parcels in two separate townships. Accordingly, the single petition procedure used by plaintiffs in the present cases is not \"novel\" as defendants contend. Indeed, as <i>Walsh</i> demonstrates, this Court's own case law has countenanced the use of such a procedure under the HRCA in the closely analogous annexation context.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>5. THE MAJORITY'S RELIANCE ON THE HRCA'S \"QUALIFIED ELECTOR\" REQUIREMENT and the ELECTION CODE is MISPLACED</h2>\n<p>The majority bases its holding primarily on the \"qualified elector\" requirement in §§ 6 and 11 of the HRCA.<sup>[63]</sup> Section 6 provides that detachment proceedings must be initiated by</p>\n<blockquote>proceedings originating by petition therefor signed by <i>qualified electors</i> who are freeholders residing within the cities, villages, or townships to be affected thereby ....<sup>[64]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>Section 11 requires affidavits showing that</p>\n<blockquote>each signature affixed [to the petition] is the genuine signature of a <i>qualified elector</i> residing in a city, village or township <i>to be affected</i> by the carrying out of the purposes of the petition and that not less than 25 of such signers reside in <i>each</i> city, village or township to be affected thereby.<sup>[65]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>The majority concludes that any multiple-township petition always violates the \"qualified elector\" rule because a signatory who is a qualified elector of township A is obviously not a qualified elector of township B, in that the signatory is not a resident of the territory \"to be affected\" in township B.</p>\n<p>The majority's analysis is flawed. The \"qualified elector\" provision of § 11 merely requires that each signatory be a qualified elector of \"a\" city, village, or township affected by the detachment and that there be at least twenty-five signatures from \"each\" municipality affected. It is uncontested in the present cases that at least twenty-five qualified electors from <i>each</i> city and township involved signed the petitions.<sup>[66]</sup> What the majority's argument is actually advancing is the unstated predicate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*121</span> point that the \"district to be affected\" cannot encompass more than one township. However, because the Legislature has permitted the \"district to be affected\" to include multiple townships, as the textual analysis above and the <i>Walsh</i> case demonstrate, then every township that is bundled into the single petition is necessarily \"affected\" within the meaning of the \"qualified voter\" provision in § 11.<sup>[67]</sup></p>\n<p>The majority's reliance on § 643a in the Michigan Election Law, MCL 168.643a, is also misplaced.<sup>[68]</sup> While it is true that § 643a requires electoral questions to be submitted to voters in a \"yes or no\" format, there is no reason why a single detachment petition and referendum involving multiple townships violates this requirement. Indeed, that was the exact situation in <i>Walsh,</i> which held that the multiple-township annexation was a \"package\" proposition and not divisible.</p>\n<p>In fact, the precise case that the majority cites for its § 643a rationale-<i>Muskegon Pub. Schools v. Vander Laan</i><sup>[69]</sup> involved a multiple-issue proposal that was put to the voters in a single \"yes or no\" format and <i>upheld</i> by this Court. In <i>Vander Laan,</i> a school district bundled bonding proposals for three separate school buildings into a single question to be submitted to the voters. This Court <i>unanimously</i> approved the use of the multiple-issue proposal.<sup>[70]</sup> Although the <i>Vander Laan</i> Court acknowledged the rule established in other jurisdictions that \"[s]eparate subjects, separate purposes, or independent propositions should not be combined [in a single electoral question] so that one may gather votes for the other,\" it noted that there was no statutory basis for the rule in Michigan.<sup>[71]</sup> Nevertheless, the <i>Vander Laan</i> Court still imposed a \"separate subjects\" rule and ultimately <i>upheld</i> the multiple-issue proposal because it \"was characterized by one common purpose . . . .\"<sup>[72]</sup></p>\n<p>I question the majority's reliance on <i>Vander Laan</i> when the <i>Vander Laan</i> Court itself noted that there was no statutory basis for the \"separate subjects\" electoral rule that it recognized. Rather than rely on a judicially created rule that was premised on policy concerns in an unrelated area, I prefer to base my analysis of the multiple-township detachment procedure on the actual text of the HRCA. However, to the extent that <i>Vander Laan-</i> a case that did not even involve the HRCA-is controlling in the present cases, I believe that the multiple-township detachments are in accord with its holding because the detachments are united by a \"common purpose.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>6. DEFENDANTS' REMAINING ARGUMENTS</h2>\n<p>Defendants argue that to construe the HRCA so as to permit a single, multiple-township petition would lead to \"absurd results.\" However, in <i>People v. McIntire,</i><sup>[73]</sup> this Court rejected the absurd results <span class=\"star-pagination\">*122</span> \"rule\" of construction, noting that its invocation is usually \"`an invitation to judicial lawmaking.'\"<sup>[74]</sup> It is not the role of this Court to rewrite the law so that its resulting policy is more \"logical,\" or perhaps palatable, to a particular party or the Court. It is our constitutional role to give effect to the intent of the Legislature by enforcing the statute <i>as written.</i><sup>[75]</sup> What defendants in these cases (or any other case) may view as \"absurd\" reflects an actual policy choice adopted by a majority of the Legislature and approved by the Governor. If defendants prefer an alternative policy choice, the proper forum is the Legislature, not this Court. After all, the Legislature has shown little reluctance in amending the HRCA over the past century.</p>\n<p>The defendants in <i>Fillmore Twp.</i> also argue that if the detachment of 1.27 acres from the city of Holland for addition to Park Township is permitted, it would violate the \"contiguity\" rule articulated by this Court in <i>Genesee Twp. v. Genesee Co.,</i><sup>[76]</sup> a case involving an annexation of land from Genesee Township to the city of Mt. Morris. In <i>Genesee Twp.,</i> this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\"So, as to territorial extent, the idea of a city is one of unity, not of plurality; of compactness or contiguity, not separation or segregation. Contiguity is generally required even in the absence of statutory requirement to that effect, and where the annexation is left in the discretion of a judicial tribunal, contiguity will be required as a matter of law.\"<sup>[77]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>Recognizing that the requirement of contiguity was not \"covered by any specific provision of the [HRCA],\" the Court in <i>Genesee Twp.</i> instead based its holding on non-textual policy grounds: \"the purpose sought to be served [by the HRCA] and the practical aspects of annexation . . . .\"<sup>[78]</sup></p>\n<p>However, this Court revisited the contiguity rule eight years later in <i>Owosso Twp. v. City of Owosso.</i><sup>[79]</sup> We specifically stated in <i>Owosso</i> that \"the judicial requirement of `contiguity'\" articulated in <i>Genesee Twp.</i> had been \"superseded\" when the Legislature amended § 9 of the HRCA in 1970.<sup>[80]</sup> We found that the \"substantive standards\" established by the Legislature when it amended § 9 clearly displaced the court-made contiguity rule.<sup>[81]</sup> Defendants in the present cases would apparently have this Court ignore the legislative intent of § 9 and resuscitate the judicially created contiguity rule in the HRCA context. I would decline the invitation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>7. CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE HRCA</h2>\n<p>Because I believe that the HRCA permits the use of a single detachment petition involving multiple townships, it is necessary to determine whether the HRCA's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*123</span> authorization of such a procedure is constitutional. Defendants, particularly those in <i>Fillmore Twp.,</i> contend that bundling numerous townships into a single petition and referendum unconstitutionally dilutes the vote of city residents.<sup>[82]</sup> Defendants argue that such vote dilution is prohibited under the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const., Am. XIV.<sup>[83]</sup></p>\n<p>Given the facts surrounding defendants' vote dilution claim, it is easy to understand their argument. As discussed in part I(B) of this opinion, it is obvious, for example, that the plaintiffs in <i>Fillmore Twp.</i> deliberately included the three additional townships-Laketown, Holland Charter, and Park-as a means to equalize the voting disparity between the city of Holland and Fillmore Township. In the initial August 2000 detachment vote that included only the city of Holland and Fillmore Township, voters rejected the detachment by a vote of 3,917 to 2,614 (approximately sixty percent against, forty percent in favor). Recognizing that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*124</span> number of voters in the city of Holland exceeded the number of voters in Fillmore Township by 19,771 to 1,854, almost a 10.7 to 1 margin, the plaintiffs bundled the three additional townships into the petition by seeking to detach an additional 5.37 acres (0.77 acres for Laketown Township, 3.33 acres for Holland Charter Township, and 1.27 acres for Park Township). By doing so, the plaintiffs were able to add an additional 31,376 township voters to the voting base of the \"district to be affected\" and thereby exceed the voting base of the city of Holland. In order to evaluate defendants' claims of unconstitutional vote dilution-an issue on which Michigan courts have been relatively silent-it is necessary to explore briefly the history of federal vote dilution law under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.<sup>[84]</sup></p>\n<p>The idea of \"vote dilution\"<sup>[85]</sup> as a cognizable constitutional harm originated in the context of congressional and state legislative apportionment cases. Initially, courts refused to get involved in claims regarding vote dilution. The issue was viewed as best left for the political process and considered nonjusticiable. The leading case establishing this view was the United States Supreme Court's decision in <i>Colegrove v. Green,</i><sup>[86]</sup> in which voters challenged the Illinois congressional districting scheme because several of the districts were comprised of larger populations than others. Stating that the harm was one to \"Illinois as a polity\" and not a private wrong, the Court refused to intervene.<sup>[87]</sup> In rejecting the notion that the Court should get involved in what it viewed as a political question, Justice Frankfurter wrote that \"[c]ourts ought not to enter this political thicket.\"<sup>[88]</sup> He went on to note:</p>\n<blockquote>The remedy for unfairness in districting is to secure State legislatures that will apportion properly, or to invoke the ample powers of Congress. . . . The Constitution has left the performance of many duties in our governmental scheme to depend on the fidelity of the executive and legislative action and, ultimately, on the vigilance of the people in exercising their political rights.<sup>[89]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>However, approximately fifteen years after <i>Colegrove,</i> the Supreme Court reversed course in the landmark case of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*125</span> <i>Baker v. Carr.</i><sup>[90]</sup> In <i>Baker,</i> the Court was presented with a constitutional challenge to the apportionment of the Tennessee General Assembly. Despite significant demographic shifts that occurred within Tennessee, the state had not reapportioned its legislative districts in over sixty years. Voters filed suit and claimed that, in light of the drastic change in population, the state's failure to reapportion the General Assembly amounted to a violation of their equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p>The Court rejected the \"political question\" rationale used in <i>Colegrove</i> and held that the issue presented by the voters was justiciable. Justice Brennan, writing for the Court, stated that \"the mere fact that the suit seeks protection of a political right does not mean it presents a political question.\"<sup>[91]</sup> The Court went on to hold that the Equal Protection Clause provided a proper vehicle by which to challenge the Tennessee apportionment system.<sup>[92]</sup> In its sweeping holding, the Court did not provide any guidelines regarding how the Equal Protection Clause should be applied to voting rights cases nor establish any standards by which to implement the new role for the judiciary in such cases. Instead, the Court simply stated, \"Nor need the [voters challenging the apportionment], in order to succeed in this action, ask the Court to enter upon policy determinations for which judicially manageable standards are lacking. Judicial standards under the Equal Protection Clause are well developed and familiar . . . .\"<sup>[93]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*126</span> With <i>Baker</i> creating the opening, courts soon began to wade head-high into the thicket of vote dilution claims. Two years after <i>Baker,</i> the Supreme Court decided <i>Wesberry v. Sanders</i><sup>[94]</sup> and <i>Reynolds v. Sims,</i><sup>[95]</sup> which established, as a fundamental tenet of equal protection jurisprudence, the \"one-person, one-vote\" standard for congressional districts and state legislative districts, respectively. In <i>Reynolds,</i> the Court stated that \"the overriding objective must be substantial equality of population among the various districts, so that the vote of any citizen is approximately equal in weight to that of any other citizen in the State.\"<sup>[96]</sup></p>\n<p>The Court later made the one-person, one-vote standard applicable to local governments in <i>Avery v. Midland Co.</i><sup>[97]</sup> In <i>Avery,</i> the Court invalidated the apportionment system for the Commissioners Court of Midland County, Texas, because it consisted of \"single-member districts of substantially unequal population,\" which favored rural voters over city voters.<sup>[98]</sup> The Court reasoned that, because the Commissioners Court exercised \"general governmental powers\"<sup>[99]</sup> and its actions had a \"broad range of impacts on all the citizens of the county,\"<sup>[100]</sup> the one-person, one vote standard should apply.<sup>[101]</sup></p>\n<p>As <i>Wesberry, Reynolds, Avery,</i> and their progeny demonstrate, the one-person, one-vote standard has become a well-established principle in equal protection jurisprudence. At the same time, two notable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*127</span> exceptions to the one-person, one-vote rule are just as firmly entrenched in equal protection analysis. The first involves so-called \"special purpose districts.\" Under this exception, electoral districts that serve a specialized purpose, such as a water storage district, are exempt from strict scrutiny and the rigid one-person, one-vote standard because they perform functions that \"`so disproportionately affect different groups that a popular election'\" is not warranted.<sup>[102]</sup></p>\n<p>The second, and more relevant, exception to the one-person, one-vote standard involves changes to municipal boundaries. Indeed, the Supreme Court recognized the unique nature of boundary changes as early as 1907 in the seminal case of <i>Hunter v. Pittsburgh,</i><sup>[103]</sup> nearly sixty years before the one-person, one-vote standard was established. In <i>Hunter,</i> the city of Allegheny was annexed to the city of Pittsburgh. Under state law, the votes in both cities on the annexation were aggregated. Voters in Allegheny, who were greatly outnumbered by voters in Pittsburgh, claimed that their votes were unconstitutionally diluted. The Supreme Court rejected the dilution claim and held that states have complete control over municipalities:</p>\n<blockquote>The State, therefore, at its pleasure may modify or withdraw all such powers, may take without compensation such property, hold it itself, or vest it in other agencies, expand or contract the territorial area, unite the whole or a part of it with another municipality, repeal the charter and destroy the corporation. All this may be done, conditionally or unconditionally, with or without the consent of the citizens, or even against their protest. In all these respects the State is supreme, and its legislative body, conforming its action to the state constitution, may do as it will, unrestrained by any provision of the Constitution of the United States. Although the inhabitants and property owners may by such changes suffer inconvenience, and their property may be lessened in value by the burden of increased taxation, or for any other reason, they have no right by contract or otherwise in the unaltered or continued existence of the corporation or its powers, and there is nothing in the Federal Constitution which protects them from these injurious consequences. The power is in the State and those who legislate for the State are alone responsible for any unjust or oppressive exercise of it.<sup>[104]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>This Court fully embraced the rationale of <i>Hunter</i> in <i>Midland Twp. v. State Boundary Comm.</i><sup>[105]</sup> The case involved an equal protection challenge to provisions of the HRCA that provided for a referendum if the area to be affected included more than one hundred persons, but excluded the possibility of a referendum when one hundred or fewer persons were affected. In rejecting the equal protection argument, Justice Levin, writing for the Court, directly relied on <i>Hunter</i> and held, \"No <span class=\"star-pagination\">*128</span> city, village, township <i>or person</i> has any vested right or legally protected interest in the boundaries of such governmental units.\"<sup>[106]</sup></p>\n<p>Although <i>Hunter</i> preceded the establishment of the one-person, one-vote standard by half a century, its holding has endured throughout modern equal protection jurisprudence.<sup>[107]</sup> Indeed, municipal boundary changes have traditionally been exempted from the one-person, one-vote rule and strict scrutiny review.<sup>[108]</sup> This issue was addressed in detail by the Supreme Court in the leading case of <i>Town of Lockport v Citizens for Community Action at the Local Level, Inc.,</i><sup>[109]</sup> which involved a claim by city voters that their votes were unconstitutionally diluted by rural voters.</p>\n<p>In <i>Lockport,</i> Niagara County, New York, sought to amend its charter in order to provide for a strong form of county government headed by a county executive. New York law provided that such an amendment could only become effective upon approval by separate majorities of the voters who lived in the cities within the county and of the voters who lived outside the cities. The amendment to the charter failed both times that it was put to a vote. Although a majority of the city voters and a majority of the overall votes cast were in favor of the amendment, a separate majority of non-city voters in favor of the amendment was never achieved in either election. Residents of the cities filed suit, claiming that the concurrent-majority voting scheme unconstitutionally diluted their voting strength because it gave a small number of rural voters disproportionate voting strength.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court <i>unanimously</i> rejected the equal protection challenge.<sup>[110]</sup> In upholding the New York voting scheme, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*129</span> the Court focused on two points. First, it found that the <i>Reynolds</i> line of cases dealing with one person, one vote in the context of legislative <i>representation</i> were of \"limited relevance\" in analyzing the \"single-shot\" type of referendum facing the voters in Niagara County because the \"expression of voter will is direct\" in a referendum.<sup>[111]</sup> Second, the Court found significant the fact that the voters within the cities and those outside the cities would be affected differently if the county were to adopt a county executive model of government.<sup>[112]</sup> The Court directly compared the situation at hand to one involving an annexation of land by municipalities and the distinct interests that would exist in such a context.<sup>[113]</sup> Applying rational basis review, the Court went on to hold that the statute's concurrent-majority voting provision merely recognized \"substantially differing electoral interests\" and that it did not amount to a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.<sup>[114]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Lockport</i> is particularly instructive in resolving defendants' equal protection claims. Similar to the Niagara County referendum in <i>Lockport,</i> the detachment elections in the present cases are also \"single-shot\" referenda, thus marginalizing much of the rationale surrounding the <i>Reynolds</i> line of cases pertaining to legislative <i>representation.</i> The expressed will of the voters in the detachment elections will be direct and unfiltered.</p>\n<p>Like the Supreme Court in <i>Lockport,</i> I also find significant the existence of disparate electoral interests between city and township residents. In the present cases, it is undisputed that the voters in the townships and those in the cities have \"substantially differing electoral interests.\" If the detachments are approved, one municipality will lose land and others will gain land, thereby implicating divergent interests in the city and the townships on a wide range of issues, including police and fire protection, school districts, taxes, sewer systems, road construction, commercial development, garbage collection, etc.<sup>[115]</sup> Indeed, the majority itself recognizes this fact by noting the \"potential for dramatically different consequences\" among municipalities if the detachments are permitted.<sup>[116]</sup></p>\n<p>Given these differing electoral interests, I believe it is rational for the Legislature to permit the use of a single detachment petition to transfer land to multiple townships and that such a procedure does not violate the Equal Protection Clause. As the parties noted in their briefs and at oral argument, boundary disputes between townships and cities are nothing new. Indeed, such gamesmanship is not only commonplace, but to be expected given the inherently valuable nature of land in our society. For example, cities often craft annexation proposals with surgical precision so that the territory to be acquired from a township contains one hundred or fewer inhabitants and is thus exempt from a public referendum.<sup>[117]</sup> By repeating this <span class=\"star-pagination\">*130</span> process numerous times, a city may be able to acquire large amounts of land without ever seeking approval from voters.</p>\n<p>In light of such tactical territorial disputes between cities and townships, it is not irrational for the Legislature to permit several townships to amplify their voting strength by combining several different parcels into a single detachment petition. In fact, with the significant population disparities that exist between large cities and small townships, such a bundled petition may be the only way that certain detachments could ever be effectuated. By permitting several townships to combine efforts in a single petition, the Legislature has simply recognized that differing electoral interests exist and that, occasionally, similar entities will need to combine forces in order to have any meaningful opportunity at advancing their interests and achieving the various boundary changes authorized under the HRCA.<sup>[118]</sup> I believe that such a view by the Legislature is entirely reasonable.<sup>[119]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Lockport</i> and <i>Hunter</i> demonstrate that the one-person, one-vote standard does not apply in cases involving municipal boundary changes as it does, for example, in the context of legislative representation.<sup>[120]</sup> Instead, states maintain broad discretion over municipal boundary changes-discretion that is subject to rational basis review.<sup>[121]</sup> The fact that the state has <span class=\"star-pagination\">*131</span> chosen to exercise this power partially through mechanisms provided under the HRCA, which includes public referenda on privately initiated boundary changes, in no way diminishes the state's plenary control over municipal boundaries. Therefore, considering the differing electoral interests that undoubtedly exist between municipalities in a detachment proceeding and the gross disparities in population that arise, I believe that the Legislature acted rationally in permitting, under the HRCA, the use of a single detachment petition when transferring land to more than one municipality.</p>\n<p>While the wisdom of such a policy choice by the Legislature might be debated, this Court is not the proper forum for such an undertaking. Our role is limited to determining whether the HRCA conforms to the Constitution. For the foregoing reasons, I believe that it does.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. MANDAMUS RELIEF</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. NATURE OF THE REMEDY</h2>\n<p>A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy used to enforce duties mandated by law.<sup>[122]</sup> It is entirely discretionary in nature.<sup>[123]</sup> Before seeking mandamus relief, a plaintiff must complete all conditions precedent to the act that the plaintiff seeks to compel,<sup>[124]</sup> including a demand of performance made on the official charged with performing the act.<sup>[125]</sup> Once this threshold is met, the plaintiff, bearing the burden of proof,<sup>[126]</sup> must demonstrate: (1) a clear legal right to the act sought to be compelled; (2) a clear legal duty by the defendant to perform the act; (3) that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*132</span> act is ministerial, leaving nothing to the judgment or discretion of the defendant; and (4) that no other adequate remedy exists.<sup>[127]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. PLAINTIFFS ARE NOT ENTITLED TO MANDAMUS RELIEF</h2>\n<p>While I agree with the majority that plaintiffs are not entitled to mandamus relief, I disagree with the majority's rationale. The majority concludes that mandamus relief is improper because the HRCA does not permit the use of a single detachment petition involving multiple townships and, therefore, plaintiffs have no \"clear legal right\" to the relief they seek.<sup>[128]</sup> For the reasons stated, I disagree with that conclusion. However, I believe that plaintiffs are not entitled to writs of mandamus because a request for such relief is premature at this time.</p>\n<p>As already discussed, before a writ of mandamus will be issued, a plaintiff must complete <i>all</i> conditions precedent to the act that the plaintiff seeks to compel.<sup>[129]</sup> While it is possible that plaintiffs may have already satisfied all requirements imposed by the HRCA, the Secretary of State has yet to make such a determination. The Secretary of State deferred her examination of the petitions until the antecedent question of whether the HRCA permits the use of a single petition involving multiple townships was resolved. The Secretary of State has not yet examined the petitions to determine whether they comply with all the <i>other</i> requirements of the HRCA. Therefore, plaintiffs' requests for mandamus relief are premature.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The HRCA is not ambiguous. A plain reading of §§ 9 and 11 demonstrates that the use of a single detachment petition is permitted when seeking to transfer land to multiple townships. Moreover, such a procedure comports with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Plaintiffs are not entitled to mandamus relief, however, because the Secretary of State has yet to examine the petitions to determine whether all the conditions mandated by the HRCA have been satisfied. Accordingly, in <i>Casco Twp.,</i> I would reverse the decisions of the Court of Appeals and the trial court and grant declaratory relief. Because the plaintiffs in <i>Fillmore Twp.</i> did not seek declaratory relief, I would affirm the dismissal of their mandamus action.</p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  While the Home Rule City Act, MCL 117.1 <i>et seq.,</i> addresses various processes, the issue before this Court pertains solely to the process of detachment.</p>\n<p>[2]  Justice Young states that the majority \"fails to convey adequately the true character of the boundary disputes at issue.\" <i>Post</i> at 109. Yet the relevant facts are conveyed, and it is of no import if the history of these cases was contentious or of a calculated nature. The statutory analysis is the same whether the parties were friends, foes, or something in between.</p>\n<p>[3]  Recent amendments to the act do not affect the issue in this case.</p>\n<p>[4]  Const. 1963, art. 2, § 1 provides the following:\n</p>\n<p>Every citizen of the United States who has attained the age of 21 years, who has resided in this state six months, and who meets the requirements of local residence provided by law, shall be an elector and qualified to vote in any election except as otherwise provided in this constitution. The legislature shall define residence for voting purposes.</p>\n<p>Pursuant to U.S. Const., Am. XVI, the minimum voting age is now eighteen years.</p>\n<p>[5]  Other jurisdictions have held similarly. See, e.g., <i>City of Lake Wales v. Florida Citrus Canners Coop.,</i> 191 So.2d 453, 457 (Fla.App., 1966) (A qualified elector in area 1 cannot vote for the annexation in area 2 because the area 1 voter is not within the territory affected.); <i>People ex rel.

See, e.g., <i>Baxter v.

Instead, I simply point out that the majority opinion, in my view, inadequately describes the true tactical and strategic character of these ongoing territorial disputes. Moreover, the lower courts clearly believed that the ability of villages and townships to use the HRCA to their advantage was unfair. Providing the full history of these territorial disputes helps to reveal the lower courts' policy views.</p>\n<p>[5]  1984 PA 425 provides a detailed mechanism by which municipal entities may transfer land to one another by contract.

MCL 117.6 However, if the territory to be affected is situated in more than one county, certification must be sought from the Secretary of State. At the time that plaintiffs filed their petitions, § 11 of the HRCA provided:\n</p>\n<p>When the territory to be affected by any proposed incorporation, consolidation or change is situated in more than 1 county the petition hereinbefore provided shall be addressed and presented to the secretary of state ....

Writing for the Court in <i>Title Office,</i> Justice Cavanagh noted that, in construing the word \"transcript\" in the 1895 Transcripts and Abstracts of Records Act (TARA), it was proper for the Court to consult a dictionary in use \"[<i>a</i>]<i>t the time of enactment</i> of [the] TARA.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[48]  <i>The New American Encyclopedic Dictionary,</i> p. 1575 (1907) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[49]  <i>The Century Dictionary: An Encyclopedic Lexicon of the English Language,</i> p. 1813 (1906) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[50]  <i>Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary of the English Language,</i> p. 779 (1913) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[51]  The Legislature's use of the word \"each\" was not limited solely to § 9 and the definition of \"the district to be affected.\" For example, the same provision under which plaintiffs filed their petitions, § 11, directly states that the Secretary of State shall transmit a certified copy of the petition to \"each city, village or township to be affected by the carrying out of the purposes of such petition....\" MCL 117.11 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[52]  The majority makes a similar, though more general, argument. It notes that a reading of the HRCA \"contrary\" to its own \"belies the fact that there will <i>always</i> be two parties to a detachment-the city and the township.\" <i>Ante</i> at 107 (emphasis in original). Conspicuously, the majority neglects to give meaning to the Legislature's use of the word \"each.\"</p>\n<p>[53]  <i>The New American Encyclopedic Dictionary,</i> p. 580 (1907) defines \"both\" as \"<i>two</i> taken together\" and <i>The Century Dictionary: An Encyclopedic Lexicon of the English Language,</i> p. 636 (1906) defines \"both\" as \"The one and the other; <i>the two;</i> the pair or the couple, in reference to <i>two</i> persons or things....\"</p>\n<p>[54]  Further examination of the text of § 11 demonstrates that a single detachment petition may be used to transfer land to multiple townships. For example, § 11 states, \"The <i>several</i> city, village and township clerks who shall receive from the secretary of state the copies and certificates above provided shall give notice of the election to be held....\" The word \"several\" is defined by <i>The New American Encyclopedic Dictionary</i> (1907) as \"Consisting of a number; <i>more than two.</i>\" The use of \"several,\" therefore, also indicates that the Legislature envisioned a situation under which a single detachment petition could be used to transfer land to <i>multiple</i> townships. While it is true that \"several\" can also mean \"separate\" or \"individual\" -e.g., \"they go their <i>several</i> ways\"-such a meaning exists only in the context of a <i>plurality.</i> \"Several\" only indicates \"individual\" or \"separate\" if there is a larger collective whole to begin with.\n</p>\n<p>At oral argument, defense counsel conceded that the word \"several,\" as used in the HRCA, means \"more than a couple.\"</p>\n<p><i>Justice Young:</i> I'm asking you to look at section 11 that refers near the end: \"The several city, village and township clerks who shall receive from the Secretary of State copies of the certificates.\" I'm looking at the term \"several\" there. Does that not indicate at least the potential for multiple.</p>\n<p><i>Counsel:</i> Well again we go to kind of the dictionary look at the definition and \"several\" can mean one individual.</p>\n<p><i>Justice Young:</i> Really?</p>\n<p><i>Counsel:</i> I'm sorry, you're talking about a city, village or </p>\n<p><i>Justice Young:</i> Doesn't \"several\" mean more than a couple?</p>\n<p><i>Counsel:</i> Yes.</p>\n<p>[55]  MCL 117.11 (emphasis added).

Contrary to the majority's assertion, this language does not prohibit the use of a single detachment petition involving multiple townships. It merely delineates which municipality will control the territory after the detachment is effectuated.

The Court of Appeals elaborated on this point in <i>Bloomfield Charter Twp. v. Oakland Co. Clerk,</i> 253 Mich. App. 1, 34, 654 N.W.2d 610 (2002).</p>\n<p>[82]  It is worth noting that these consolidated cases do not involve any allegations of discrimination, or the impairment of voting rights, on the basis of race or any other suspect classification. See, e.g., Gerken, <i>Understanding the right to an undiluted vote,</i> 114 Harv. L. R. 1663 (2001). The sole issue of contention here is one of pure numerical vote dilution. Defendants claim that <i>too many</i> township voters would be included in the voting base if these referenda are allowed to proceed, to the extent that city voters would no longer have a <i>meaningful</i> vote.</p>\n<p>[83]  While defendants allege violations of both the federal and state equal protection clauses, they base their vote dilution argument almost entirely on federal case law. They cite no Michigan cases analyzing vote dilution under Const. 1963, art. 1, § 2. Instead, defendants simply state in their brief that \"Michigan courts interpret the state equal protection clause similarly to the Fourteenth Amendment.\" City of Holland brief at 39.\n</p>\n<p>It is important to note that the text of our state Equal Protection Clause is not entirely the same as its federal counterpart:</p>\n<p>U.S. Const., Am. XIV provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p>No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; <i>nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.</i> [Emphasis added.]</p>\n<p>Const. 1963, art. 1, § 2 provides:</p>\n<p>No person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws; nor shall any person be denied the enjoyment of his civil or political rights or be discriminated against in the exercise thereof because of religion, race, color or national origin. The legislature shall implement this section by appropriate legislation.</p>\n<p>See also <i>Lind v. Battle Creek,</i> 470 Mich. 230, 234-235, 681 N.W.2d 334 (2004) (Young, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>Therefore, it is insufficient for defendants to rely solely on federal case law regarding vote dilution, or Michigan cases interpreting the <i>federal</i> Equal Protection Clause, and then boldly announce that Const. 1963, art. 1, § 2 provides the same protections against vote dilution as U.S. Const., Am. XIV.</p>\n<p>Because defendants have failed to address vote dilution directly under Const. 1963, art. 1, § 2, I decline to examine the issue. As this Court stated in <i>Mitcham v. Detroit,</i> 355 Mich. 182, 203, 94 N.W.2d 388 (1959):</p>\n<p>It is not enough for an appellant in his brief simply to announce a position or assert an error and then leave it up to this Court to discover and rationalize the basis for his claims, or unravel and elaborate for him his arguments, and then search for authority either to sustain or reject his position. The appellant himself must first adequately prime the pump; only then does the appellate well begin to flow.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the constitutional provision upon which defendants base their argument, Const. 1963, art. 1, § 2, was not relied on by the Court of Appeals. It was Const. 1963, art. 1, § 1 that the Court of Appeals referenced in its opinion. <i>Casco Twp., supra,</i> 261 Mich.App. at 394 n. 27, 682 N.W.2d 546.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, I analyze defendants' vote dilution argument solely under U.S. Const., Am. XIV-the issue that was fully briefed by the parties.</p>\n<p>[84]  As an initial matter, it is important to note that the state action requirement under Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence is satisfied here. Although the detachment petitions in both cases were circulated and signed by private citizens, the involvement of the Secretary of State in certifying the petitions and ordering local authorities to hold elections is sufficient to constitute state action. See, e.g. <i>Ellison v. Garbarino,</i> 48 F.3d 192, 195 (C.A.6, 1995) (\"running elections\" is a \"typical example[ ]\" of state action).</p>\n<p>[85]  Professor Melvyn R. Durchslag has noted:\n</p>\n<p>Voter dilution cases fall into two broad categories. First, there are those in which dilution occurs because (1) some persons are given votes weighted more heavily than others similarly situated merely on the basis of residence, (2) votes are weighted according to a factor which the state determines is reflective of \"interest,\" or (3) persons are excluded altogether from voting because the state deems them to be \"uninterested.\" Second, there are those in which dilution occurs because equal franchise is <i>granted</i> to persons allegedly without interest, or with significantly less interest than other voters.

Commentators have questioned the Supreme Court's reliance on the Equal Protection Clause in <i>Baker,</i> suggesting, instead, that the Republican Form of Government Clause, U.S. Const., art. IV, § 4, would have been more appropriate. As Judge Michael W. McConnell has written:\n</p>\n<p>A districting scheme so malapportioned that a minority faction is in complete control, without regard to democratic sentiment, violates the basic norms of republican government. It would thus appear to raise a constitutional question under Article IV, Section 4, which states that \"the United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government.\" Constitutional standards under the Republican Form of Government Clause are ill-developed, but surely a government is not \"republican\" if a minority faction maintains control, and the majority has no means of overturning it. [McConnell, <i>The redistricting cases: Original mistakes and current consequences,</i> 24 Harv. J. L. &amp; Pub. Policy 103, 105-106 (2000).]</p>\n<p>Professor Pamela S. Karlan has noted:</p>\n<p>[T]he doctrinal move to one person, one vote was in no sense compelled, either by precedent or by the absence of any alternative avenues to judicial oversight. The decision to rely on the Equal Protection Clause, rather than on the Guaranty Clause, has always puzzled me. Justice William Brennan's explanation-that there was precedent suggesting the general nonjusticiability of the Guaranty Clause-would make more sense if not for the fact that there was also absolutely square precedent refusing to entertain malapportionment claims under the Fourteenth Amendment [citing <i>Colegrove</i>]. If the Court had to overrule some precedent to review apportionment and the refusal to reapportion, then why was overruling Fourteenth Amendment precedent-and developing a unique set of equal protection principles that apply nowhere else in constitutional law-the superior alternative?

Justice Frankfurter stated:\n</p>\n<p>The Framers carefully and with deliberate forethought refused . . . to enthrone the judiciary.

As discussed in n. 6 of this opinion, an annexation of territory that contains one hundred or fewer residents is subject only to approval by the SBC. MCL 117.9(4).\n</p>\n<p>Justice Levin recognized the gamesmanship that occurs between cities and townships in <i>Midland Twp, supra</i> at 679[, 259 N.W.2d 326], stating that \"[c]ity and township strategies based on [the one hundred-resident referendum threshold] are unavoidable. In general, the city will seek to limit the area proposed for annexation so that there are insufficient residents for a referendum and the township will seek to extend the area to require a referendum. The motive or purpose of the city or township in drawing the proposed boundaries or in requesting a revision of boundaries is not material.\"</p>\n<p>[118]  In addition to minimizing the effects of population disparities between cities and townships, there are numerous other reasons why the Legislature may have permitted the use of a single petition to transfer land to multiple townships. For example, it is possible that the Legislature recognized the substantial financial expense that townships and cities face when holding elections and that, by combining numerous detachments in one election, it would be less expensive for the taxpayers to have a single election than to have several separate detachment elections.</p>\n<p>[119]  I find the cases on which defendants rely unpersuasive. In <i>Hayward v. Clay,</i> 573 F.2d 187 (C.A.4, 1978), the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals applied strict scrutiny to an annexation proceeding that required separate majority approval by freeholders. <i>Hayward</i> is easily distinguishable from the present cases. <i>Hayward</i> involved a grant of disproportionate voting strength to <i>freeholders.</i> No such land-based distinction in voting strength exists in the present cases. Instead, the franchise is extended to <i>all</i> registered voters in the affected municipalities, regardless of land ownership status. Defendants also cite <i>Carlyn v. City of Akron,</i> 726 F.2d 287 (C.A.6, 1984), in which the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals <i>refused</i> to apply strict scrutiny to an annexation proceeding. While I appreciate the dicta that defendants cite from <i>Carlyn</i> regarding when strict scrutiny is to apply, I would choose instead to base our resolution of this federal law question on clear precedent from the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>[120]  Indeed, <i>Lockport</i> and <i>Hunter,</i> taken together, illustrate that any claim of vote dilution in the municipal boundary change context will be difficult to sustain, absent dilution based on some suspect category such as race. The Supreme Court explicitly rejected \"dilution by <i>aggregation</i>\" in <i>Hunter</i> and \"dilution by <i>disproportionate weight</i>\" in <i>Lockport.</i> With both types of dilution having been flatly rejected by the Supreme Court, it seems quite clear that such cases are not viewed as traditional vote dilution matters, but as matters involving a state's absolute authority over municipal boundaries.</p>\n<p>[121]  As Professor Briffault has written in discussing the effect of <i>Lockport:</i>\n</p>\n<p>To apply strict scrutiny to the distribution of the vote concerning boundary changes would inevitably entail a constitutional review of the states' municipal formation and boundary change policies. But there are no generally accepted principles for determining whether a particular local government ought to exist, what that unit's geographic dimensions ought to be, or whether a particular territory ought to be in that or another local unit. Thus, deference to the states is consistent with both the lack of a constitutional vantage point for examining state municipal formation and boundary change policies and the traditional jurisprudence of federalism that treats local governments as state instrumentalities and leaves the creation and structure of local governments to the states.

CAVANAGH, J.</p>\n<p>These consolidated appeals present two issues. First, we must address whether a single detachment petition and a single vote on that petition, pursuant to the terms of the Home Rule City Act, MCL 117.1 <i>et seq.,</i> may encompass territory to be detached from one city and added to more than one township.<sup>[1]</sup> Second, if a single detachment petition and a single vote may encompass territory to be added to more than one township, we must determine whether a writ of mandamus compels the Secretary of State to issue a notice directing an election on the change of boundaries sought by plaintiffs in each case. Because we conclude that the Home Rule City Act does not allow a single detachment petition and a single vote on detachment for adding territory to multiple townships, mandamus is not proper in these cases. Accordingly, the decisions of the Court of Appeals are affirmed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. STATEMENT OF FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Casco Twp. v. Secretary of State</i></h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs in this case are two adjacent townships-Casco Township and Columbus Township-and residents of those townships who seek to detach territory from defendant city of Richmond. The territory sought to be detached is territory that was previously annexed to the city of Richmond.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs seek to present the ballot issue covering both townships in a single petition. This would result in a single vote about whether to detach territory from the city of Richmond and add the territory to Casco Township and Columbus Township. The residents of one township would be voting on the return of property to their township, as well as the return of property to a township in which they do not reside. The Secretary of State refused to approve an election on plaintiffs' petition because an election on the petition would allow residents of one township to vote on, and possibly determine, a change in the boundaries of another township in which they do not reside.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs filed a complaint for mandamus and declaratory relief. The circuit court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint for mandamus to compel the Secretary of State to act because it was not clear that a single petition seeking detachment from a city and addition of the territory to two townships was permitted by the Home Rule City Act. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the circuit court. <i>Casco Twp. v.

Plaintiffs filed a joint detachment petition with the Secretary of State, asking that the petition be certified and that a single election be held regarding the territory that was proposed to be detached from the city of Holland.

ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>These cases involve an issue of statutory interpretation. The primary goal of statutory interpretation is to give effect to the intent of the Legislature. <i>Id.</i> at 411, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1985493\"><a href=\"/opinion/1985493/in-re-mci-telecommunications-complaint/\"><span class=\"volume\">596</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">164</span></a></span>. The first step is to review the language of the statute. If the statutory language is unambiguous, the Legislature is presumed to have intended the meaning expressed in the statute and judicial construction is not permissible.</p>\n<p>The Home Rule City Act, MCL 117.1 <i>et seq.,</i> addresses four processes-incorporation, consolidation, annexation, and detachment.<sup>[3]</sup> The issue before this Court pertains only to the process of detachment. Detachment means that territory is taken from an existing city and added to an existing township.</p>\n<p>Section 6 of the Home Rule City Act, MCL 117.6, provides that a detachment be initiated by \"proceedings originating by petition therefor signed by <i>qualified electors</i> who are freeholders residing within the cities, villages, or townships to be affected thereby ....\" (Emphasis added.) Notably, MCL 117.8 and MCL 117.11 delineate the procedure for submitting a petition for a change of boundaries. MCL 117.8(1) provides in relevant part that \"the board shall, by resolution, provide that the question of making the proposed incorporation, consolidation, or change of boundaries be submitted to the <i>qualified electors</i> of the district to be affected at the next general election or at a special election before the next general election.\" (Emphasis added.) Likewise, MCL 117.11(2) provides that \"the question of making the incorporation, consolidation, or change of boundaries petitioned for shall be submitted to the <i>electors</i> of the district to be affected.\" (Emphasis added.) Michigan election law defines a qualified elector as \"any person who possesses the qualifications of an elector as prescribed in section 1 of article 2 of the state constitution and who has resided in the city or township 30 days.\"<sup>[4]</sup> MCL 168.10.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*106</span> Because Casco Township voters do not reside in Columbus Township, they are not \"qualified electors\" of Columbus Township who can sign a petition and vote on the detachment of territory from the city of Richmond for addition of the territory to Columbus Township. Likewise, because Columbus Township voters do not reside in Casco Township, they are not \"qualified electors\" of Casco Township who can sign a petition and vote on the detachment of territory from the city of Richmond for addition of the territory to Casco Township. Therefore, a single petition and a single vote on multiple detachments violate the statutory language of the Home Rule City Act.</p>\n<p>Additional support for this position is found in the statutory language used in other parts of the Home Rule City Act. MCL 117.9(1) defines the \"district to be affected\" as the following: \"The district to be affected by every such proposed incorporation, consolidation, or <i>change</i> of boundaries shall be deemed to include the whole of each city, village, or township from which <i>territory</i> is to be taken or to which <i>territory</i> is to be annexed.\" (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>A <i>change</i> of boundaries for the district to be affected encompasses only one city and one township because a township's voters can be qualified electors only in relation to their own township's proposed change of boundaries and are <i>affected</i> only by their own township's proposed change of boundaries. Therefore, it is only plausible that the \"district to be affected\" encompasses one city and one township. Accordingly, a single detachment petition and a single vote may only encompass territory to be added to one township.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Language in MCL 117.13, which sets forth the procedure following an election, further supports the principle that each township is considered a separate entity and there must be separate votes with respect to the territory to be detached from one city and added to each township. MCL 117.13 states, \"Territory detached from any city shall thereupon become a part of the township or village from which it was originally taken....\" This indicates that the \"district to be affected\" is limited to the city in which the territory is located and the single township that seeks the return of the territory.</p>\n<p>Further, interpreting the \"district to be affected\" in detachment proceedings as the city from which the territory is to be detached and the township to which the territory is to be added recognizes that the consequences of detachment may be quite different for each township that seeks to gain property. For example, property rights and liabilities must be adjusted between the city and the township when there is a detachment. MCL 123.1. Debts must be apportioned and land may <span class=\"star-pagination\">*107</span> need to be sold. MCL 123.2; MCL 123.3. The potential for dramatically different consequences of detachment are clearly indicated in the <i>Fillmore Twp.</i> case. Four townships seek to detach land from the city of Holland. The Fillmore Township parcel is 1,054 acres, the Holland Charter Township parcel is 3.33 acres, the Park Township parcel is 1.27 acres, and the Laketown Township parcel is 0.77 acres. It is reasonable to conclude that the effect of detachment will be quite different when one parcel is 1,054 acres and one parcel is a mere 0.77 acres.</p>\n<p>Moreover, allowing a single petition and a single vote on detachment from one city for the addition of territory to multiple townships does not allow voters to render a vote in support of the addition of territory to only one township. MCL 168.643a requires, in relevant part, the following:</p>\n<blockquote>A question submitted to the electors of this state or the electors of a subdivision of this state shall, to the extent that it will not confuse the electorate, be worded so that a \"yes\" vote will be a vote in favor of the subject matter of the proposal or issue and a \"no\" vote will be a vote against the subject matter of the proposal or issue.</blockquote>\n<p>However, a single vote on detaching territory from one city and adding the territory to multiple townships does not allow a voter who may only favor one of the multiple additions of territory to cast a \"yes\" vote. As stated by this Court in <i>Muskegon Pub. Schools v. Vander Laan,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></span>, 87, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></span> (1920), \"Separate subjects, separate purposes, or independent propositions should not be combined so that one may gather votes for the other.\" In <i>Vander Laan,</i> this Court noted that the erection of three new school buildings showed a common purpose and were part of a comprehensive plan to meet the educational needs of the city. In contrast, we find that detaching territory from one city and adding the territory to multiple townships does not indicate a common purpose because the needs and consequences of the additions to various townships may differ remarkably. Combining multiple additions of territory in a single detachment petition so that there is only a single vote indeed combines independent propositions \"so that one may gather votes for the other.\"</p>\n<p>When put into context, the text of the Home Rule City Act is unambiguous-a petition and a vote about detachment must involve only one city and one township. A contrary reading of the statutory language belies the fact that there will <i>always</i> be two parties to a detachment-the city and the township. Justice Young's focus on the word \"each\" in the statute ignores that the provisions must be read in context. Interpreting the word \"each\" to mean that a detachment petition can encompass more than one township is contrary to the statutory language that relates to qualified electors and ignores the fact that the Home Rule City Act encompasses four distinct procedures-incorporation, consolidation, annexation, and detachment. Language in the statute that at first may appear to indicate that multiple townships may be involved in a single detachment petition and a single vote must be read in context and in consideration of the statutory language regarding qualified electors. Significantly, residents of one township are not qualified electors in a detachment proceeding when it comes to determining a change of boundaries for another township, and the statute cannot properly be interpreted in this manner.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*108</span> Further, Justice Young's reliance on this Court's decision in <i>Walsh v. Secretary of State,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1241064\"><a href=\"/opinion/1241064/walsh-v-secretary-of-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">570</span></a></span>, 574, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1241064\"><a href=\"/opinion/1241064/walsh-v-secretary-of-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span> (1959), is misplaced. <i>Walsh</i> dealt with annexation, not detachment. Notably, in the multiple-township annexation at issue in <i>Walsh,</i> the votes of each territory were considered separately. In essence, a single township could \"veto\" the annexation from taking place, no matter how many voters approved of the annexation in other townships. In contrast, in the detachment procedure at issue in these cases, the voters in a township have no \"veto\" power. The wishes of an entire township could effectively be ignored because voters in other townships believe that a detachment would be in their best interests. The \"package\" proposal in <i>Walsh</i> is hardly analogous to the detachment proceedings at issue in these cases.</p>\n<p>Our conclusion that a single detachment petition and a single vote on that petition may only encompass territory to be added to one township is in accord with the unambiguous statutory language. Thus, the Legislature is presumed to have intended the meaning expressed in the statute and judicial construction is not permissible.</p>\n<p>Finally, a writ of mandamus could be properly issued in these cases only if plaintiffs proved that (1) they had a clear legal right to the performance of the specific duty that they sought to be compelled, and (2) the Secretary of State had a clear legal duty to perform the act. <i>In re MCI, supra</i> at 442-443, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1985493\"><a href=\"/opinion/1985493/in-re-mci-telecommunications-complaint/\"><span class=\"volume\">596</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">164</span></a></span>. Because the Home Rule City Act does not allow a single detachment petition and a single vote on that petition to encompass territory to be detached from one city and added to more than one township, there was no clear legal right to have the Secretary of State authorize each petition for a single vote. Therefore, there was no clear legal duty that required the Secretary of State to act, and the writs of mandamus were properly denied in both cases before this Court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The Home Rule City Act, MCL 117.1 <i>et seq.,</i> does not allow a single petition and a single vote to encompass detachment of territory from a city for the addition of that territory to multiple townships; thus, the Secretary of State did not have a clear legal duty to act. Therefore, mandamus was not an appropriate remedy. Accordingly, the decisions of the Court of Appeals are affirmed.</p>\n<p>YOUNG, J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>We granted leave to appeal in these consolidated cases to determine whether (1) the Home Rule City Act (HRCA)<sup>[1]</sup> permits the use of a single detachment petition and election when the territory to be detached from a city is to be transferred to more than one township and, (2) if such a procedure is allowed under the HRCA, whether plaintiffs<sup>[2]</sup> are entitled to mandamus relief. I agree with the majority that plaintiffs are not entitled to writs of mandamus because I believe that any request for mandamus relief is premature at this time. I disagree, however, with the majority's conclusion that the HRCA does not permit the use of a single detachment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*109</span> petition and vote thereon when transferring land to multiple townships.</p>\n<p>The Legislature was well aware of the political gamesmanship that occurs between municipalities in the context of boundary disputes. Indeed, our Constitution was changed to free the Legislature from this political quagmire.<sup>[3]</sup> By enacting the HRCA, the Legislature established a standardized procedure to effectuate such changes in a manner that it viewed as fair and reasonable. A plain reading of <i>all</i> relevant language in the HRCA demonstrates that the use of a single detachment petition when transferring land to multiple townships is permitted. The Court of Appeals focused only on select text in the HRCA and thereby gave the statute a particular meaning that is insupportable when one considers <i>all</i> the language used by the Legislature in the HRCA. Its exercise in selective statutory interpretation not only undermines the Legislature's intent in passing the HRCA, but also injects the judiciary-armed only with ill-defined notions of \"fairness\" and \"justice\"-as a referee in the inherently political, contentious, and tactical process of altering municipal boundaries. The majority opinion, while avoiding explicit reliance on extra-textual policy justifications, does not, in my view, give full meaning to all the relevant words in the statute.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the majority's conclusion that a single detachment petition involving multiple townships is not permitted under the HRCA. In <i>Casco Twp.,</i> I would grant the plaintiffs' request for declaratory relief and deny their claim for a writ of mandamus. In <i>Fillmore Twp.,</i> because the plaintiffs only sought a writ of mandamus, I would deny entirely their request for relief.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>\n<p>The majority fails to convey adequately the true character of the boundary disputes at issue. By glossing over much of the relevant history, the majority understates the inherently political and calculated nature of the disputes.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. CASCO TWP. v. SECRETARY OF STATE</h2>\n<p>The land at issue in this case has a long, contentious history. In July 1996, intervening defendants, Walter and Patricia Winkle, filed a petition with the State Boundary Commission (SBC) seeking to annex to the city of Richmond approximately 157 acres of land that they and other residents owned in Casco Township and Columbus Township. The Winkles hoped to develop their land for commercial use, but believed that commercial development could not occur unless their property was connected to the water and sewer lines offered by the city of Richmond.</p>\n<p>Before the Winkles' July 1996 petition, however, Columbus Township and neighboring Lenox Township had entered into an agreement pursuant to <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">PA</span> <span class=\"page\">425</span></span> to transfer land from Columbus Township to Lenox Township.<sup>[5]</sup> A similar 425 agreement <span class=\"star-pagination\">*110</span> was reached between Casco Township and Lenox Township. These 425 agreements were designed to prevent future annexations, such as the one initiated by the Winkles in July 1996. In November 1997, the SBC determined that the 425 agreements were invalid and decided instead to approve the annexation petition filed by the Winkles.<sup>[6]</sup> After protracted litigation, the SBC's decision was eventually upheld by the Court of Appeals.<sup>[7]</sup> The Court of Appeals found that the 425 agreements between the townships of Columbus, Casco, and Lenox were \"sham[s]\" and \"essentially an attempt to avoid annexation,\" and upheld the SBC's decision approving the annexation initiated by the Winkles.<sup>[8]</sup> In July 2001, this Court denied leave to appeal.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>In December 2001, plaintiffs filed a single detachment petition with the Secretary of State, seeking to transfer from the city of Richmond to Casco Township and Columbus Township the same land that was involved in the prior annexation.<sup>[10]</sup> The disputed territory consisted of approximately eighty-seven acres in Casco Township and seventy acres in Columbus Township.</p>\n<p>Unsure whether the HRCA permitted the use of a single detachment petition to transfer land to multiple townships, the Secretary of State requested an official opinion from the Attorney General interpreting the HRCA. Citing a pending lawsuit in Eaton County, Michigan, involving a factually similar dispute,<sup>[11]</sup> and the Attorney General's policy of declining to issue opinions that might affect ongoing litigation, the Attorney General refused to issue a formal opinion construing the HRCA. However, in a May 2002 memorandum to the Department of State, Bureau of Elections, the Attorney General's Office provided \"informal advice\" regarding the use of a single detachment petition. Recognizing that there were \"no cases directly on point that specifically address the issue,\" the memorandum informed the Department of State that it was \"reasonable to refuse to certify\" the petition.<sup>[12]</sup> The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*111</span> Secretary of State subsequently notified the plaintiffs that she would not certify the detachment petition.</p>\n<p>The following month, the plaintiffs filed a complaint in the Ingham Circuit Court, seeking declaratory and mandamus relief against the defendants. After holding a hearing, the circuit court denied the plaintiffs' request for mandamus relief, ruling that the HRCA was not \"patently clear\" regarding whether a single detachment petition may be used to transfer land to more than one township. The circuit court then dismissed the plaintiffs' lawsuit without having addressed their request for declaratory relief.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Appeals, claiming that the circuit court erred in denying their request for mandamus relief and in dismissing their lawsuit without deciding their request for declaratory relief. In divided opinions, the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the circuit court.<sup>[13]</sup> The Court of Appeals majority held that the HRCA was ambiguous as to whether a single detachment petition was permitted. Given the ambiguity, the majority decided that it \"must consider the object of the statute and apply a reasonable construction that is logical and best accomplishes the HRCA's purpose.\"<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p>Acknowledging that there was \"no case law that directly addresse[d] the current situation,\"<sup>[15]</sup> the majority concluded that it was \"clearly unfair\" to allow the use of a single detachment petition when transferring land to multiple townships.<sup>[16]</sup> Accordingly, the Court of Appeals denied the plaintiffs' request for mandamus relief. The Court of Appeals further held that the circuit court had \"implicitly\" denied the plaintiffs' request for declaratory relief and affirmed the circuit court's ruling denying declaratory relief.<sup>[17]</sup> The dissent disagreed with the majority's conclusion that the HRCA was ambiguous and noted that the plain text of the HRCA permitted the use of a single detachment petition to transfer land to multiple townships. We granted leave to appeal and consolidated the case with <i>Fillmore Twp. v. Secretary of State</i><i>.</i><sup>[18]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. FILLMORE TWP. v. SECRETARY OF STATE</h2>\n<p>As with the territory involved in the companion case of <i>Casco Twp. v. Secretary of State</i><i>,</i> the disputed territory in this case also has a complex history. In 1997, Fillmore Township and the city of Holland entered into a 425 agreement through which land in Fillmore Township was to be transferred to Holland. Pursuant to the referendum provision in <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">PA</span> <span class=\"page\">425</span></span>, qualified electors in Fillmore Township filed a petition calling for a referendum on the 425 agreement with the city of Holland. The voters ultimately defeated the 425 agreement in the referendum.</p>\n<p>Several months after the 425 agreement was defeated, in late 1998, landowners in Fillmore Township filed petitions with the SBC to annex approximately 1,100 acres to the city of Holland. The SBC approved the annexation, thereby transferring approximately 1,100 acres from Fillmore Township to Holland. Seeking to reverse the annexation effected by the SBC's decision, in February 2000, electors in Fillmore Township filed a petition with the Secretary of State to detach the land that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*112</span> was previously annexed. In August 2000, voters in Fillmore and Holland defeated the detachment proposal by a vote of 3,917 to 2,614.</p>\n<p>In October 2002, the plaintiffs submitted a single detachment petition to the Secretary of State,<sup>[19]</sup> again hoping to detach from the city of Holland the territory that was previously annexed from Fillmore Township. In addition to the Fillmore Township-city of Holland detachment, however, the petition also included three smaller detachments by which land would be detached from the city of Holland and added to Laketown Township, Park Township, and Holland Charter Township. Because the HRCA provides that \"the <i>whole</i> of each city, village, or township\" to be affected by the detachment is entitled to vote,<sup>[20]</sup> by adding the additional three townships to the single detachment petition, the voting base for the detachment election was greatly expanded.</p>\n<p>The following table summarizes the acreage to be transferred by the detachment and the number of voters that would be added to the voting base by including each additional township in the single detachment petition:<sup>[21]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\n                          Acres To Be\n                         Received from      Registered Voters\n  Municipality           the Detachment   (as of November 2002)\n  City of Holland           - - - -              19,771\n  Fillmore Township          1,054                1,854\n  Laketown Township          0.77                 4,166\n  Holland Charter Township   3.33                15,221\n  Park Township              1.27                11,989\n</pre>\n<p>Thus, by including the three additional townships and detaching only an extra 5.37 acres, the voting base of the district to be affected would be expanded by an additional 31,376 voters over what the voting base would be if only Fillmore Township and the city of Holland were involved.</p>\n<p>In November 2002, the Secretary of State refused to certify the detachment petition, relying on the September 2002 decision by the circuit court disallowing the use of a single detachment petition in <i>Casco Twp.</i> In response to the Secretary of State's refusal to certify the petition, the plaintiffs filed an original mandamus action in the Court of Appeals seeking to have the Court order the Secretary of State to certify the petition and schedule an election. The Court of Appeals ordered that the plaintiffs' case be held in abeyance pending its resolution of <i>Casco Twp.</i> In March 2004, the Court of Appeals issued its opinion in <i>Casco Twp.,</i> affirming the circuit court's decision disallowing the use of a single detachment petition. Citing its opinion in <i>Casco Twp.,</i> the Court of Appeals then denied the plaintiffs mandamus relief by order in May 2004.<sup>[22]</sup> We granted leave to appeal and consolidated the case with <i>Casco Twp. v. Secretary of State</i><i>.</i><sup>[23]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*113</span> II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</h2>\n<p>Whether the HRCA permits the use of a single detachment petition to transfer land to multiple townships is a matter of statutory interpretation, which is a question of law that is reviewed by this Court de novo.<sup>[24]</sup> The constitutionality of the HRCA's detachment procedure is also a question of law that is subject to review de novo.<sup>[25]</sup> This Court reviews a lower court's decision regarding a request for mandamus relief for an abuse of discretion.<sup>[26]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. THE HRCA AND THE SINGLE DETACHMENT PROCEDURE</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. HISTORY OF THE HRCA</h2>\n<p>The HRCA, enacted in 1909, is an intricate statute that has been amended in piecemeal fashion numerous times over the past century. Before the enactment of the HRCA, the Legislature directly enacted municipal boundary changes on a case-by-case basis through special legislation. Delegates to the 1907-1908 constitutional convention recognized the substantial burden this process imposed, as well as the confusion that resulted from hundreds of pieces of such special legislation. The convention's Address to the People stated:</p>\n<blockquote>One of the greatest evils brought to the attention of the Convention was the abuse practiced under local and special legislation. The number of local and special bills passed by the last legislature was <i>four hundred fourteen,</i> not including joint and concurrent resolutions. The time devoted to the consideration of these measures and the time required in their passage through the two houses imposed a serious burden upon the state. This section [prohibiting the enactment of special acts when a general act can be made applicable], taken in connection with the increased powers of local self-government granted to cities and villages in the revision, seeks to effectively remedy such condition.... The evils of local and special legislation have grown to be almost intolerable, introducing uncertainty and confusion into the laws, and consuming the time and energy of the legislature which should be devoted to the consideration of measures of a general character. By eliminating this mass of legislation, the work of the legislature will be greatly simplified and improved.<sup>[27]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>Based on this overwhelming dissatisfaction with special legislation as a means <span class=\"star-pagination\">*114</span> to adjust municipal boundaries, delegates to the 1907-1908 constitutional convention debated whether to direct the Legislature to enact a general municipal boundary statute that would provide a framework for all future municipal boundary changes. The delegates proposed, and the people of Michigan eventually ratified, Const. 1908, art. 8, § 20, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote>The legislature shall provide by a general law for the incorporation of cities, and by a general law for the incorporation of villages ....</blockquote>\n<p>With art. 8, § 20 as a constitutional mandate, the Legislature enacted the HRCA the following year in order to establish a comprehensive, standardized procedure for initiating and approving all changes to municipal boundaries, including incorporations, annexations, detachments, and consolidations.<sup>[28]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF THE HRCA</h2>\n<p>As the majority correctly notes, three provisions of the HRCA are directly relevant in the present case. The detachment process is specifically authorized by § 6 of the HRCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote>Cities may be incorporated or <i>territory detached therefrom</i> or added thereto, or consolidation made of 2 or more cities or villages into 1 city, or of a city and 1 or more villages into 1 city, or of 1 or more cities or villages together with additional territory not included within any incorporated city or village into 1 city, by proceedings originating by petition therefor signed by qualified electors who are freeholders residing within the cities, villages, or townships to be affected thereby. . . .<sup>[29]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>However, because both the city of Richmond and the city of Holland are located in more than one county, rather than filing their detachment petitions with the county under § 6, plaintiffs in both cases were required to file their petitions with the Secretary of State pursuant to § 11 of the HRCA. At the time of the present lawsuits, § 11 provided:</p>\n<blockquote>When the territory to be affected by any proposed incorporation, consolidation, or change is situated in more than 1 county the petition hereinbefore provided shall be addressed and presented to the secretary of state, with 1 or more affidavits attached thereto sworn to by 1 or more of the signers of said petition, showing that the statements contained in said petition are true, that each signature affixed thereto is the genuine signature of a qualified elector residing in a city, village, or township to be affected by the carrying out of the purposes of the petition and that not less than 25 or such signers reside in each city, village or township to be affected thereby. The secretary of state shall examine such petition and the affidavit or affidavits annexed, and if he shall find that the same conforms to the provisions of this act he shall so certify, and transmit a certified copy of said petition and the accompanying affidavit or affidavits to the clerk of <i>each</i> city, village or township to be affected by the carrying out of the purposes of such petition, together with his certificate as above provided, and a notice directing that at the next general election occurring not less than 40 days thereafter the question of making the incorporation, consolidation or change of boundaries petitioned for, shall be submitted to the electors of <i>the district to be affected,</i> and if no general election is to be held within 90 days the resolution may fix a date preceding the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*115</span> next general election for a special election on the question. If he shall find that said petition and the affidavit or affidavits annexed thereto do not conform to the provisions of this act he shall certify to that fact, and return said petition and affidavits to the person from whom they were received, together with such certificate. The <i>several</i> city, village and township clerks who shall receive from the secretary of state the copies and certificates above provided for shall give notice of the election to be held on the question of making the proposed incorporation, consolidation or change of boundaries as provided for in section 10 of this act.<sup>[30]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>Lastly, the phrase \"district to be affected,\" as used in § 11, is defined by § 9 of the HRCA:</p>\n<blockquote>The district to be affected by the proposed incorporation, consolidation, or change of boundaries is considered to include the whole of <i>each</i> city, village, or township from which territory is to be taken or to which territory is to be annexed.<sup>[31]</sup></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. PRINCIPLES OF STATUTORY INTERPRETATION</h2>\n<p>When interpreting a statute, a court's duty is to give effect to the intent of the Legislature based on the actual words used in the statute.<sup>[32]</sup> If the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, no further construction is necessary or permitted.<sup>[33]</sup> The statute is enforced as written.<sup>[34]</sup> It is the duty of the judiciary to interpret, not write, the law.<sup>[35]</sup></p>\n<p>In <i>Lansing Mayor v. Pub. Service Comm</i><i>.,</i> this Court repudiated prior case law that held that a statute is ambiguous if it is susceptible to more than one meaning or if \"reasonable minds can differ\" regarding the statute's meaning.<sup>[36]</sup> Instead, as this Court stated in <i>Lansing Mayor,</i> a statutory provision is ambiguous only if it \"`irreconcilably conflict[s]' with another provision, or when it is <i>equally</i> susceptible to more than a single meaning.\"<sup>[37]</sup> In ascertaining whether an ambiguity exists, therefore, a court must employ conventional rules of construction and \"give effect to every word, phrase, and clause in a statute.\"<sup>[38]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. THE PLAIN TEXT OF THE HRCA PERMITS THE USE OF A SINGLE DETACHMENT PETITION TO TRANSFER LAND TO MULTIPLE TOWNSHIPS</h2>\n<p>At its core, the Court of Appeals opinion in <i>Casco Twp.</i> represents a deliberate decision <span class=\"star-pagination\">*116</span> to subordinate the actual text of the HRCA in favor of the Court of Appeals' own abstract notions of fairness and justice. By choosing to give meaning to only <i>some</i> of the words in the HRCA and ignoring others, the Court of Appeals substituted its conception of \"fairness\" for the policy determination made by the Legislature in writing the HRCA.<sup>[39]</sup> While this à la carte method of statutory interpretation that focuses only on certain words in a statute is extraordinarily effective at allowing a court to reach a conclusion that it views as \"fair\" or \"just,\" it is an affront to the separation of powers principle. As this Court has stated numerous times, it is the duty of the judiciary to effectuate the intent of the Legislature by giving effect to every \"word, phrase, and clause in a statute.\"<sup>[40]</sup></p>\n<p>A close analysis of the text of the HRCA demonstrates that the statute is not ambiguous and that a single detachment petition may be used to detach land from a city and add it to multiple townships. Although the majority focuses extensively on § 9 of the HRCA,<sup>[41]</sup> the majority notably fails to give full effect to the Legislature's use of the word \"each\" in § 9.</p>\n<p>The section of the HRCA under which plaintiffs filed their petitions, § 11, provides that \"the question of making the incorporation, consolidation or change of boundaries petitioned for, shall be submitted to the electors of <i>the district to be affected</i>....\"<sup>[42]</sup> Under § 9, the HRCA defines \"the district to be affected\" as \"includ[ing] the whole of <i>each</i> city, village, or township from which territory is to be taken or to which territory is to be annexed.\"<sup>[43]</sup> By defining \"the district to be affected\" as including the whole of \"each\" city, village, or township, the Legislature contemplated that \"the district to be affected\" could include <i>multiple</i> townships in a detachment proceeding.</p>\n<p>The word \"each\" is not defined in the HRCA. Pursuant to MCL 8.3a, undefined statutory terms are to be given their plain and ordinary meaning, unless, of course, the undefined word is a term of art.<sup>[44]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*117</span> Because \"each\" is not a term of art, this Court must therefore give the word its plain meaning. As this Court stated in <i>Horace v. City of Pontiac,</i><sup>[45]</sup> \"[w]hen considering a nonlegal word or phrase that is not defined within a statute, resort to a layman's dictionary ... is appropriate.\"<sup>[46]</sup> Moreover, it is appropriate to use a dictionary from the period contemporaneous to the statute's enactment in order to give full effect to the intent of the Legislature that enacted the statute.<sup>[47]</sup></p>\n<p>Although the HRCA has been amended frequently over the past century, the relevant provisions of §§ 9 and 11 have remained unchanged in the HRCA since 1909, the year the HRCA was originally enacted. The word \"each\" is defined by <i>The New American Encyclopedic Dictionary</i> as \"<i>every</i> one of a number considered separately, <i>all.</i>\"<sup>[48]</sup><i>The Century Dictionary</i> defines \"each\" as \"Being either or any unit of a numerical aggregate consisting of two <i>or more,</i> indefinitely.\"<sup>[49]</sup><i>Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary of the English Language</i> defines \"each\" as \"Being one of two <i>or more ... Every</i> one of any number or aggregation....\"<sup>[50]</sup></p>\n<p>It is clear, therefore, that the word \"each,\" as used in 1909, means \"all\" and \"every,\" and plainly encompasses <i>multiple</i> entities. Indeed, by using \"each\" in § 9, the Legislature effectively said, as a definitional matter, that \"the district to be affected\" is to be comprised of \"all\" or \"every\" city, village, or township affected by the boundary change. The \"district\" is not limited to a predetermined number, but rather includes <i>every</i> municipal entity from which territory is to be taken or to which territory is to be added. Thus, while \"the district to be affected\" can certainly contain just two municipal entities, it can also include <i>more than</i> two entities.<sup>[51]</sup></p>\n<p>Defendants argue that the Legislature's use of the word \"each\" is not determinative because, by using \"each,\" the Legislature was simply referring to the two municipal entities that necessarily must be involved in any detachment proceeding: the city that will lose the land and the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*118</span> township that will gain the land.<sup>[52]</sup> Defendants' argument is unpersuasive. Had the Legislature intended \"each\" to refer only to the two sides involved in a typical detachment proceeding-the donor city and the recipient township-and not to multiple recipient townships, the Legislature would have used the word \"both,\" not \"each.\"<sup>[53]</sup> The Legislature, however, did not limit \"the district to be affected\" to only two municipal entities by using the word \"both.\" Instead, it deliberately used the distributive adjective \"each,\" thereby referring to <i>every</i> municipality affected. It is only by assuming that \"each\" refers exclusively to the donor and recipient municipalities in a <i>conventional</i> detachment proceeding that the majority position may be sustained. There is no textual basis for making this assumption or otherwise limiting the customary meaning of \"each.\"<sup>[54]</sup></p>\n<p>This construction of the HRCA is bolstered by the fact that, throughout § 11, the words \"petition\" and \"election\" are used in the singular even though the words \"each\" and \"several\" are used in the same sentences when modifying \"city, village or township.\" For example, § 11 states that the Secretary of State must transmit \"a certified copy of said <i>petition</i> ... to the clerk of <i>each</i> city, village or township to be affected by the carrying out of the purposes of such <i>petition</i>....\"<sup>[55]</sup> Section 11 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*119</span> further provides that \"[t]he <i>several</i> city, village and township clerks ... shall give notice of <i>the election</i> to be held....\"<sup>[56]</sup> While it is true that MCL 8.3b states that, in construing statutes, \"[e]very word importing the singular number only may extend to and embrace the plural number,\" it is important to remember that MCL 8.3b is <i>permissive,</i> not mandatory. MCL 8.3b states only that the singular \"may\" extend to the plural.</p>\n<p>This Court addressed MCL 8.3b in <i>Robinson,</i> in which we construed the phrase \"<i>the</i> proximate cause\" within the context of the governmental immunity statute.<sup>[57]</sup> As we noted in <i>Robinson,</i> MCL 8.3b \"only states that a word importing the singular number `may extend' to the plural. The statute does not say that such an automatic understanding is required.\"<sup>[58]</sup> We went on to hold that MCL 8.3 \"provides that the rule stated in § 3b shall be observed `unless such construction would be inconsistent with the manifest intent of the Legislature.'\"<sup>[59]</sup> This Court concluded that because the Legislature chose to use the definite article \"the\" within the phrase \"the proximate cause,\" it \"clearly evince[d] an intent to focus on <i>one</i> cause.\"<sup>[60]</sup></p>\n<p>The same is true in the present case. In § 11, the Legislature consistently referred to \"petition\" in the singular and used the phrase \"<i>the</i> election.\" There is no principled basis by which to say that \"the\" means \"one\" in <i>Robinson,</i> but \"the\" does not mean \"one\" when referring to \"<i>the</i> election\" mandated by § 11.</p>\n<p>Taken together, all of these textual clues demonstrate that the HRCA permits the use of a <i>single</i> detachment petition and election when transferring land to more than one township. Unlike the majority, which focuses only on select words in the HRCA, I believe that this Court is obligated to give effect to <i>every</i> word the Legislature used in writing the HRCA. I would hold, therefore, that the Court of Appeals erred in finding that the HRCA is ambiguous. No provision of the HRCA conflicts, irreconcilably or otherwise, with any other provision of the HRCA. Nor is the HRCA <i>equally</i> susceptible to more than a single meaning. A plain reading of §§ 9 and 11 demonstrates that the procedure used by plaintiffs in the present cases is permissible under the HRCA.</p>\n<p>The majority casually dismisses this Court's decision in <i>Walsh v. Secretary of State,</i><sup>[61]</sup> which explicitly recognized and permitted a single petition for a multiple-municipality annexation under the HRCA. In <i>Walsh,</i> we examined §§ 9 and 11 of the HRCA. The case involved an annexation by the city of Lansing in which it sought to acquire four parcels of land from Lansing Township and one parcel situated in both Lansing Township and Delta Township. A <i>single</i> petition was filed with the Secretary <span class=\"star-pagination\">*120</span> of State for this multiple-township annexation. Although voters in the city of Lansing and Lansing Township approved the annexation, voters in Delta Township did not.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs in <i>Walsh</i> argued that the annexation attempt was divisible and that we should approve the annexation of the parcels in Lansing Township, given that the Lansing Township voters approved the annexation. This Court disagreed. We held that the annexation was a \"package proposition\" and that, under the vote tabulation provisions of § 9 in effect at the time, if any one of the \"voting units\" voted against the proposal, the whole proposal failed.<sup>[62]</sup></p>\n<p>While it is true that <i>Walsh</i> involved an analogous annexation rather than a detachment, and that the primary focus in <i>Walsh</i> was on the vote tabulation provisions of the HRCA, not the definition of \"district to be affected,\" this Court accepted the use of a single \"package\" petition even though the land that was to be annexed consisted of five distinct parcels in two separate townships. Accordingly, the single petition procedure used by plaintiffs in the present cases is not \"novel\" as defendants contend. Indeed, as <i>Walsh</i> demonstrates, this Court's own case law has countenanced the use of such a procedure under the HRCA in the closely analogous annexation context.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>5. THE MAJORITY'S RELIANCE ON THE HRCA'S \"QUALIFIED ELECTOR\" REQUIREMENT and the ELECTION CODE is MISPLACED</h2>\n<p>The majority bases its holding primarily on the \"qualified elector\" requirement in §§ 6 and 11 of the HRCA.<sup>[63]</sup> Section 6 provides that detachment proceedings must be initiated by</p>\n<blockquote>proceedings originating by petition therefor signed by <i>qualified electors</i> who are freeholders residing within the cities, villages, or townships to be affected thereby ....<sup>[64]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>Section 11 requires affidavits showing that</p>\n<blockquote>each signature affixed [to the petition] is the genuine signature of a <i>qualified elector</i> residing in a city, village or township <i>to be affected</i> by the carrying out of the purposes of the petition and that not less than 25 of such signers reside in <i>each</i> city, village or township to be affected thereby.<sup>[65]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>The majority concludes that any multiple-township petition always violates the \"qualified elector\" rule because a signatory who is a qualified elector of township A is obviously not a qualified elector of township B, in that the signatory is not a resident of the territory \"to be affected\" in township B.</p>\n<p>The majority's analysis is flawed. The \"qualified elector\" provision of § 11 merely requires that each signatory be a qualified elector of \"a\" city, village, or township affected by the detachment and that there be at least twenty-five signatures from \"each\" municipality affected. It is uncontested in the present cases that at least twenty-five qualified electors from <i>each</i> city and township involved signed the petitions.<sup>[66]</sup> What the majority's argument is actually advancing is the unstated predicate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*121</span> point that the \"district to be affected\" cannot encompass more than one township. However, because the Legislature has permitted the \"district to be affected\" to include multiple townships, as the textual analysis above and the <i>Walsh</i> case demonstrate, then every township that is bundled into the single petition is necessarily \"affected\" within the meaning of the \"qualified voter\" provision in § 11.<sup>[67]</sup></p>\n<p>The majority's reliance on § 643a in the Michigan Election Law, MCL 168.643a, is also misplaced.<sup>[68]</sup> While it is true that § 643a requires electoral questions to be submitted to voters in a \"yes or no\" format, there is no reason why a single detachment petition and referendum involving multiple townships violates this requirement. Indeed, that was the exact situation in <i>Walsh,</i> which held that the multiple-township annexation was a \"package\" proposition and not divisible.</p>\n<p>In fact, the precise case that the majority cites for its § 643a rationale-<i>Muskegon Pub. Schools v. Vander Laan</i><sup>[69]</sup> involved a multiple-issue proposal that was put to the voters in a single \"yes or no\" format and <i>upheld</i> by this Court. In <i>Vander Laan,</i> a school district bundled bonding proposals for three separate school buildings into a single question to be submitted to the voters. This Court <i>unanimously</i> approved the use of the multiple-issue proposal.<sup>[70]</sup> Although the <i>Vander Laan</i> Court acknowledged the rule established in other jurisdictions that \"[s]eparate subjects, separate purposes, or independent propositions should not be combined [in a single electoral question] so that one may gather votes for the other,\" it noted that there was no statutory basis for the rule in Michigan.<sup>[71]</sup> Nevertheless, the <i>Vander Laan</i> Court still imposed a \"separate subjects\" rule and ultimately <i>upheld</i> the multiple-issue proposal because it \"was characterized by one common purpose . . . .\"<sup>[72]</sup></p>\n<p>I question the majority's reliance on <i>Vander Laan</i> when the <i>Vander Laan</i> Court itself noted that there was no statutory basis for the \"separate subjects\" electoral rule that it recognized. Rather than rely on a judicially created rule that was premised on policy concerns in an unrelated area, I prefer to base my analysis of the multiple-township detachment procedure on the actual text of the HRCA. However, to the extent that <i>Vander Laan-</i> a case that did not even involve the HRCA-is controlling in the present cases, I believe that the multiple-township detachments are in accord with its holding because the detachments are united by a \"common purpose.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>6. DEFENDANTS' REMAINING ARGUMENTS</h2>\n<p>Defendants argue that to construe the HRCA so as to permit a single, multiple-township petition would lead to \"absurd results.\" However, in <i>People v. McIntire,</i><sup>[73]</sup> this Court rejected the absurd results <span class=\"star-pagination\">*122</span> \"rule\" of construction, noting that its invocation is usually \"`an invitation to judicial lawmaking.'\"<sup>[74]</sup> It is not the role of this Court to rewrite the law so that its resulting policy is more \"logical,\" or perhaps palatable, to a particular party or the Court. It is our constitutional role to give effect to the intent of the Legislature by enforcing the statute <i>as written.</i><sup>[75]</sup> What defendants in these cases (or any other case) may view as \"absurd\" reflects an actual policy choice adopted by a majority of the Legislature and approved by the Governor. If defendants prefer an alternative policy choice, the proper forum is the Legislature, not this Court. After all, the Legislature has shown little reluctance in amending the HRCA over the past century.</p>\n<p>The defendants in <i>Fillmore Twp.</i> also argue that if the detachment of 1.27 acres from the city of Holland for addition to Park Township is permitted, it would violate the \"contiguity\" rule articulated by this Court in <i>Genesee Twp. v. Genesee Co.,</i><sup>[76]</sup> a case involving an annexation of land from Genesee Township to the city of Mt. Morris. In <i>Genesee Twp.,</i> this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\"So, as to territorial extent, the idea of a city is one of unity, not of plurality; of compactness or contiguity, not separation or segregation. Contiguity is generally required even in the absence of statutory requirement to that effect, and where the annexation is left in the discretion of a judicial tribunal, contiguity will be required as a matter of law.\"<sup>[77]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>Recognizing that the requirement of contiguity was not \"covered by any specific provision of the [HRCA],\" the Court in <i>Genesee Twp.</i> instead based its holding on non-textual policy grounds: \"the purpose sought to be served [by the HRCA] and the practical aspects of annexation . . . .\"<sup>[78]</sup></p>\n<p>However, this Court revisited the contiguity rule eight years later in <i>Owosso Twp. v. City of Owosso.</i><sup>[79]</sup> We specifically stated in <i>Owosso</i> that \"the judicial requirement of `contiguity'\" articulated in <i>Genesee Twp.</i> had been \"superseded\" when the Legislature amended § 9 of the HRCA in 1970.<sup>[80]</sup> We found that the \"substantive standards\" established by the Legislature when it amended § 9 clearly displaced the court-made contiguity rule.<sup>[81]</sup> Defendants in the present cases would apparently have this Court ignore the legislative intent of § 9 and resuscitate the judicially created contiguity rule in the HRCA context. I would decline the invitation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>7. CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE HRCA</h2>\n<p>Because I believe that the HRCA permits the use of a single detachment petition involving multiple townships, it is necessary to determine whether the HRCA's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*123</span> authorization of such a procedure is constitutional. Defendants, particularly those in <i>Fillmore Twp.,</i> contend that bundling numerous townships into a single petition and referendum unconstitutionally dilutes the vote of city residents.<sup>[82]</sup> Defendants argue that such vote dilution is prohibited under the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const., Am. XIV.<sup>[83]</sup></p>\n<p>Given the facts surrounding defendants' vote dilution claim, it is easy to understand their argument. As discussed in part I(B) of this opinion, it is obvious, for example, that the plaintiffs in <i>Fillmore Twp.</i> deliberately included the three additional townships-Laketown, Holland Charter, and Park-as a means to equalize the voting disparity between the city of Holland and Fillmore Township. In the initial August 2000 detachment vote that included only the city of Holland and Fillmore Township, voters rejected the detachment by a vote of 3,917 to 2,614 (approximately sixty percent against, forty percent in favor). Recognizing that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*124</span> number of voters in the city of Holland exceeded the number of voters in Fillmore Township by 19,771 to 1,854, almost a 10.7 to 1 margin, the plaintiffs bundled the three additional townships into the petition by seeking to detach an additional 5.37 acres (0.77 acres for Laketown Township, 3.33 acres for Holland Charter Township, and 1.27 acres for Park Township). By doing so, the plaintiffs were able to add an additional 31,376 township voters to the voting base of the \"district to be affected\" and thereby exceed the voting base of the city of Holland. In order to evaluate defendants' claims of unconstitutional vote dilution-an issue on which Michigan courts have been relatively silent-it is necessary to explore briefly the history of federal vote dilution law under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.<sup>[84]</sup></p>\n<p>The idea of \"vote dilution\"<sup>[85]</sup> as a cognizable constitutional harm originated in the context of congressional and state legislative apportionment cases. Initially, courts refused to get involved in claims regarding vote dilution. The issue was viewed as best left for the political process and considered nonjusticiable. The leading case establishing this view was the United States Supreme Court's decision in <i>Colegrove v. Green,</i><sup>[86]</sup> in which voters challenged the Illinois congressional districting scheme because several of the districts were comprised of larger populations than others. Stating that the harm was one to \"Illinois as a polity\" and not a private wrong, the Court refused to intervene.<sup>[87]</sup> In rejecting the notion that the Court should get involved in what it viewed as a political question, Justice Frankfurter wrote that \"[c]ourts ought not to enter this political thicket.\"<sup>[88]</sup> He went on to note:</p>\n<blockquote>The remedy for unfairness in districting is to secure State legislatures that will apportion properly, or to invoke the ample powers of Congress. . . . The Constitution has left the performance of many duties in our governmental scheme to depend on the fidelity of the executive and legislative action and, ultimately, on the vigilance of the people in exercising their political rights.<sup>[89]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>However, approximately fifteen years after <i>Colegrove,</i> the Supreme Court reversed course in the landmark case of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*125</span> <i>Baker v. Carr.</i><sup>[90]</sup> In <i>Baker,</i> the Court was presented with a constitutional challenge to the apportionment of the Tennessee General Assembly. Despite significant demographic shifts that occurred within Tennessee, the state had not reapportioned its legislative districts in over sixty years. Voters filed suit and claimed that, in light of the drastic change in population, the state's failure to reapportion the General Assembly amounted to a violation of their equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p>The Court rejected the \"political question\" rationale used in <i>Colegrove</i> and held that the issue presented by the voters was justiciable. Justice Brennan, writing for the Court, stated that \"the mere fact that the suit seeks protection of a political right does not mean it presents a political question.\"<sup>[91]</sup> The Court went on to hold that the Equal Protection Clause provided a proper vehicle by which to challenge the Tennessee apportionment system.<sup>[92]</sup> In its sweeping holding, the Court did not provide any guidelines regarding how the Equal Protection Clause should be applied to voting rights cases nor establish any standards by which to implement the new role for the judiciary in such cases. Instead, the Court simply stated, \"Nor need the [voters challenging the apportionment], in order to succeed in this action, ask the Court to enter upon policy determinations for which judicially manageable standards are lacking. Judicial standards under the Equal Protection Clause are well developed and familiar . . . .\"<sup>[93]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*126</span> With <i>Baker</i> creating the opening, courts soon began to wade head-high into the thicket of vote dilution claims. Two years after <i>Baker,</i> the Supreme Court decided <i>Wesberry v. Sanders</i><sup>[94]</sup> and <i>Reynolds v. Sims,</i><sup>[95]</sup> which established, as a fundamental tenet of equal protection jurisprudence, the \"one-person, one-vote\" standard for congressional districts and state legislative districts, respectively. In <i>Reynolds,</i> the Court stated that \"the overriding objective must be substantial equality of population among the various districts, so that the vote of any citizen is approximately equal in weight to that of any other citizen in the State.\"<sup>[96]</sup></p>\n<p>The Court later made the one-person, one-vote standard applicable to local governments in <i>Avery v. Midland Co.</i><sup>[97]</sup> In <i>Avery,</i> the Court invalidated the apportionment system for the Commissioners Court of Midland County, Texas, because it consisted of \"single-member districts of substantially unequal population,\" which favored rural voters over city voters.<sup>[98]</sup> The Court reasoned that, because the Commissioners Court exercised \"general governmental powers\"<sup>[99]</sup> and its actions had a \"broad range of impacts on all the citizens of the county,\"<sup>[100]</sup> the one-person, one vote standard should apply.<sup>[101]</sup></p>\n<p>As <i>Wesberry, Reynolds, Avery,</i> and their progeny demonstrate, the one-person, one-vote standard has become a well-established principle in equal protection jurisprudence. At the same time, two notable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*127</span> exceptions to the one-person, one-vote rule are just as firmly entrenched in equal protection analysis. The first involves so-called \"special purpose districts.\" Under this exception, electoral districts that serve a specialized purpose, such as a water storage district, are exempt from strict scrutiny and the rigid one-person, one-vote standard because they perform functions that \"`so disproportionately affect different groups that a popular election'\" is not warranted.<sup>[102]</sup></p>\n<p>The second, and more relevant, exception to the one-person, one-vote standard involves changes to municipal boundaries. Indeed, the Supreme Court recognized the unique nature of boundary changes as early as 1907 in the seminal case of <i>Hunter v. Pittsburgh,</i><sup>[103]</sup> nearly sixty years before the one-person, one-vote standard was established. In <i>Hunter,</i> the city of Allegheny was annexed to the city of Pittsburgh. Under state law, the votes in both cities on the annexation were aggregated. Voters in Allegheny, who were greatly outnumbered by voters in Pittsburgh, claimed that their votes were unconstitutionally diluted. The Supreme Court rejected the dilution claim and held that states have complete control over municipalities:</p>\n<blockquote>The State, therefore, at its pleasure may modify or withdraw all such powers, may take without compensation such property, hold it itself, or vest it in other agencies, expand or contract the territorial area, unite the whole or a part of it with another municipality, repeal the charter and destroy the corporation. All this may be done, conditionally or unconditionally, with or without the consent of the citizens, or even against their protest. In all these respects the State is supreme, and its legislative body, conforming its action to the state constitution, may do as it will, unrestrained by any provision of the Constitution of the United States. Although the inhabitants and property owners may by such changes suffer inconvenience, and their property may be lessened in value by the burden of increased taxation, or for any other reason, they have no right by contract or otherwise in the unaltered or continued existence of the corporation or its powers, and there is nothing in the Federal Constitution which protects them from these injurious consequences. The power is in the State and those who legislate for the State are alone responsible for any unjust or oppressive exercise of it.<sup>[104]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>This Court fully embraced the rationale of <i>Hunter</i> in <i>Midland Twp. v. State Boundary Comm.</i><sup>[105]</sup> The case involved an equal protection challenge to provisions of the HRCA that provided for a referendum if the area to be affected included more than one hundred persons, but excluded the possibility of a referendum when one hundred or fewer persons were affected. In rejecting the equal protection argument, Justice Levin, writing for the Court, directly relied on <i>Hunter</i> and held, \"No <span class=\"star-pagination\">*128</span> city, village, township <i>or person</i> has any vested right or legally protected interest in the boundaries of such governmental units.\"<sup>[106]</sup></p>\n<p>Although <i>Hunter</i> preceded the establishment of the one-person, one-vote standard by half a century, its holding has endured throughout modern equal protection jurisprudence.<sup>[107]</sup> Indeed, municipal boundary changes have traditionally been exempted from the one-person, one-vote rule and strict scrutiny review.<sup>[108]</sup> This issue was addressed in detail by the Supreme Court in the leading case of <i>Town of Lockport v Citizens for Community Action at the Local Level, Inc.,</i><sup>[109]</sup> which involved a claim by city voters that their votes were unconstitutionally diluted by rural voters.</p>\n<p>In <i>Lockport,</i> Niagara County, New York, sought to amend its charter in order to provide for a strong form of county government headed by a county executive. New York law provided that such an amendment could only become effective upon approval by separate majorities of the voters who lived in the cities within the county and of the voters who lived outside the cities. The amendment to the charter failed both times that it was put to a vote. Although a majority of the city voters and a majority of the overall votes cast were in favor of the amendment, a separate majority of non-city voters in favor of the amendment was never achieved in either election. Residents of the cities filed suit, claiming that the concurrent-majority voting scheme unconstitutionally diluted their voting strength because it gave a small number of rural voters disproportionate voting strength.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court <i>unanimously</i> rejected the equal protection challenge.<sup>[110]</sup> In upholding the New York voting scheme, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*129</span> the Court focused on two points. First, it found that the <i>Reynolds</i> line of cases dealing with one person, one vote in the context of legislative <i>representation</i> were of \"limited relevance\" in analyzing the \"single-shot\" type of referendum facing the voters in Niagara County because the \"expression of voter will is direct\" in a referendum.<sup>[111]</sup> Second, the Court found significant the fact that the voters within the cities and those outside the cities would be affected differently if the county were to adopt a county executive model of government.<sup>[112]</sup> The Court directly compared the situation at hand to one involving an annexation of land by municipalities and the distinct interests that would exist in such a context.<sup>[113]</sup> Applying rational basis review, the Court went on to hold that the statute's concurrent-majority voting provision merely recognized \"substantially differing electoral interests\" and that it did not amount to a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.<sup>[114]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Lockport</i> is particularly instructive in resolving defendants' equal protection claims. Similar to the Niagara County referendum in <i>Lockport,</i> the detachment elections in the present cases are also \"single-shot\" referenda, thus marginalizing much of the rationale surrounding the <i>Reynolds</i> line of cases pertaining to legislative <i>representation.</i> The expressed will of the voters in the detachment elections will be direct and unfiltered.</p>\n<p>Like the Supreme Court in <i>Lockport,</i> I also find significant the existence of disparate electoral interests between city and township residents. In the present cases, it is undisputed that the voters in the townships and those in the cities have \"substantially differing electoral interests.\" If the detachments are approved, one municipality will lose land and others will gain land, thereby implicating divergent interests in the city and the townships on a wide range of issues, including police and fire protection, school districts, taxes, sewer systems, road construction, commercial development, garbage collection, etc.<sup>[115]</sup> Indeed, the majority itself recognizes this fact by noting the \"potential for dramatically different consequences\" among municipalities if the detachments are permitted.<sup>[116]</sup></p>\n<p>Given these differing electoral interests, I believe it is rational for the Legislature to permit the use of a single detachment petition to transfer land to multiple townships and that such a procedure does not violate the Equal Protection Clause. As the parties noted in their briefs and at oral argument, boundary disputes between townships and cities are nothing new. Indeed, such gamesmanship is not only commonplace, but to be expected given the inherently valuable nature of land in our society. For example, cities often craft annexation proposals with surgical precision so that the territory to be acquired from a township contains one hundred or fewer inhabitants and is thus exempt from a public referendum.<sup>[117]</sup> By repeating this <span class=\"star-pagination\">*130</span> process numerous times, a city may be able to acquire large amounts of land without ever seeking approval from voters.</p>\n<p>In light of such tactical territorial disputes between cities and townships, it is not irrational for the Legislature to permit several townships to amplify their voting strength by combining several different parcels into a single detachment petition. In fact, with the significant population disparities that exist between large cities and small townships, such a bundled petition may be the only way that certain detachments could ever be effectuated. By permitting several townships to combine efforts in a single petition, the Legislature has simply recognized that differing electoral interests exist and that, occasionally, similar entities will need to combine forces in order to have any meaningful opportunity at advancing their interests and achieving the various boundary changes authorized under the HRCA.<sup>[118]</sup> I believe that such a view by the Legislature is entirely reasonable.<sup>[119]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Lockport</i> and <i>Hunter</i> demonstrate that the one-person, one-vote standard does not apply in cases involving municipal boundary changes as it does, for example, in the context of legislative representation.<sup>[120]</sup> Instead, states maintain broad discretion over municipal boundary changes-discretion that is subject to rational basis review.<sup>[121]</sup> The fact that the state has <span class=\"star-pagination\">*131</span> chosen to exercise this power partially through mechanisms provided under the HRCA, which includes public referenda on privately initiated boundary changes, in no way diminishes the state's plenary control over municipal boundaries. Therefore, considering the differing electoral interests that undoubtedly exist between municipalities in a detachment proceeding and the gross disparities in population that arise, I believe that the Legislature acted rationally in permitting, under the HRCA, the use of a single detachment petition when transferring land to more than one municipality.</p>\n<p>While the wisdom of such a policy choice by the Legislature might be debated, this Court is not the proper forum for such an undertaking. Our role is limited to determining whether the HRCA conforms to the Constitution. For the foregoing reasons, I believe that it does.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. MANDAMUS RELIEF</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. NATURE OF THE REMEDY</h2>\n<p>A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy used to enforce duties mandated by law.<sup>[122]</sup> It is entirely discretionary in nature.<sup>[123]</sup> Before seeking mandamus relief, a plaintiff must complete all conditions precedent to the act that the plaintiff seeks to compel,<sup>[124]</sup> including a demand of performance made on the official charged with performing the act.<sup>[125]</sup> Once this threshold is met, the plaintiff, bearing the burden of proof,<sup>[126]</sup> must demonstrate: (1) a clear legal right to the act sought to be compelled; (2) a clear legal duty by the defendant to perform the act; (3) that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*132</span> act is ministerial, leaving nothing to the judgment or discretion of the defendant; and (4) that no other adequate remedy exists.<sup>[127]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. PLAINTIFFS ARE NOT ENTITLED TO MANDAMUS RELIEF</h2>\n<p>While I agree with the majority that plaintiffs are not entitled to mandamus relief, I disagree with the majority's rationale. The majority concludes that mandamus relief is improper because the HRCA does not permit the use of a single detachment petition involving multiple townships and, therefore, plaintiffs have no \"clear legal right\" to the relief they seek.<sup>[128]</sup> For the reasons stated, I disagree with that conclusion. However, I believe that plaintiffs are not entitled to writs of mandamus because a request for such relief is premature at this time.</p>\n<p>As already discussed, before a writ of mandamus will be issued, a plaintiff must complete <i>all</i> conditions precedent to the act that the plaintiff seeks to compel.<sup>[129]</sup> While it is possible that plaintiffs may have already satisfied all requirements imposed by the HRCA, the Secretary of State has yet to make such a determination. The Secretary of State deferred her examination of the petitions until the antecedent question of whether the HRCA permits the use of a single petition involving multiple townships was resolved. The Secretary of State has not yet examined the petitions to determine whether they comply with all the <i>other</i> requirements of the HRCA. Therefore, plaintiffs' requests for mandamus relief are premature.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The HRCA is not ambiguous. A plain reading of §§ 9 and 11 demonstrates that the use of a single detachment petition is permitted when seeking to transfer land to multiple townships. Moreover, such a procedure comports with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Plaintiffs are not entitled to mandamus relief, however, because the Secretary of State has yet to examine the petitions to determine whether all the conditions mandated by the HRCA have been satisfied. Accordingly, in <i>Casco Twp.,</i> I would reverse the decisions of the Court of Appeals and the trial court and grant declaratory relief. Because the plaintiffs in <i>Fillmore Twp.</i> did not seek declaratory relief, I would affirm the dismissal of their mandamus action.</p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  While the Home Rule City Act, MCL 117.1 <i>et seq.,</i> addresses various processes, the issue before this Court pertains solely to the process of detachment.</p>\n<p>[2]  Justice Young states that the majority \"fails to convey adequately the true character of the boundary disputes at issue.\" <i>Post</i> at 109. Yet the relevant facts are conveyed, and it is of no import if the history of these cases was contentious or of a calculated nature. The statutory analysis is the same whether the parties were friends, foes, or something in between.</p>\n<p>[3]  Recent amendments to the act do not affect the issue in this case.</p>\n<p>[4]  Const. 1963, art. 2, § 1 provides the following:\n</p>\n<p>Every citizen of the United States who has attained the age of 21 years, who has resided in this state six months, and who meets the requirements of local residence provided by law, shall be an elector and qualified to vote in any election except as otherwise provided in this constitution. The legislature shall define residence for voting purposes.</p>\n<p>Pursuant to U.S. Const., Am. XVI, the minimum voting age is now eighteen years.</p>\n<p>[5]  Other jurisdictions have held similarly. See, e.g., <i>City of Lake Wales v. Florida Citrus Canners Coop.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">191</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">453</span></span>, 457 (Fla.App., 1966) (A qualified elector in area 1 cannot vote for the annexation in area 2 because the area 1 voter is not within the territory affected.); <i>People ex rel.

See, e.g., <i>Baxter v. Robertson,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">127</span></span>, 129, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">711</span></span> (1885) (\"No person not living in the township has any voice in its affairs.\").</p>\n<p>[1]  MCL 117.1 <i>et seq.</i></p>\n<p>[2]  Unless otherwise indicated, \"plaintiffs\" will be used to refer collectively to the plaintiffs in both of the cases that were consolidated. Similarly, \"defendants\" will be used to refer to the defendants in both cases collectively, unless otherwise noted.</p>\n<p>[3]  See the discussion in part III(A)(1) of this opinion.</p>\n<p>[4]  Contrary to the majority's assertion, I do not contend that the factual background of these cases should alter the statutory analysis. <i>Ante</i> at 105 n. 2. Instead, I simply point out that the majority opinion, in my view, inadequately describes the true tactical and strategic character of these ongoing territorial disputes. Moreover, the lower courts clearly believed that the ability of villages and townships to use the HRCA to their advantage was unfair. Providing the full history of these territorial disputes helps to reveal the lower courts' policy views.</p>\n<p>[5]  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">PA</span> <span class=\"page\">425</span></span> provides a detailed mechanism by which municipal entities may transfer land to one another by contract.

MCL 117.6 However, if the territory to be affected is situated in more than one county, certification must be sought from the Secretary of State. At the time that plaintiffs filed their petitions, § 11 of the HRCA provided:\n</p>\n<p>When the territory to be affected by any proposed incorporation, consolidation or change is situated in more than 1 county the petition hereinbefore provided shall be addressed and presented to the secretary of state .... [MCL 117.11.]</p>\n<p>Because the city of Richmond is located in both St. Clair County and Macomb County, the plaintiffs filed the detachment petition with the Secretary of State pursuant to § 11.</p>\n<p>[11]  In <i>City of Eaton Rapids v. Eaton Co. Bd. of Comm'rs,</i> (Eaton Circuit Court, Docket No. 02-235-AZ 2002), residents of Eaton Rapids Township and Hamlin Township filed a single detachment petition to detach land from the city of Eaton Rapids. Unlike the present case, however, the territory involved in <i>Eaton Rapids</i> was situated in only one county, thus eliminating the need for involvement by the Secretary of State. In <i>Eaton Rapids,</i> the trial court <i>upheld</i> the use of a single detachment petition.

Writing for the Court in <i>Title Office,</i> Justice Cavanagh noted that, in construing the word \"transcript\" in the 1895 Transcripts and Abstracts of Records Act (TARA), it was proper for the Court to consult a dictionary in use \"[<i>a</i>]<i>t the time of enactment</i> of [the] TARA.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[48]  <i>The New American Encyclopedic Dictionary,</i> p. 1575 (1907) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[49]  <i>The Century Dictionary: An Encyclopedic Lexicon of the English Language,</i> p. 1813 (1906) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[50]  <i>Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary of the English Language,</i> p. 779 (1913) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[51]  The Legislature's use of the word \"each\" was not limited solely to § 9 and the definition of \"the district to be affected.\" For example, the same provision under which plaintiffs filed their petitions, § 11, directly states that the Secretary of State shall transmit a certified copy of the petition to \"each city, village or township to be affected by the carrying out of the purposes of such petition....\" MCL 117.11 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[52]  The majority makes a similar, though more general, argument. It notes that a reading of the HRCA \"contrary\" to its own \"belies the fact that there will <i>always</i> be two parties to a detachment-the city and the township.\" <i>Ante</i> at 107 (emphasis in original). Conspicuously, the majority neglects to give meaning to the Legislature's use of the word \"each.\"</p>\n<p>[53]  <i>The New American Encyclopedic Dictionary,</i> p. 580 (1907) defines \"both\" as \"<i>two</i> taken together\" and <i>The Century Dictionary: An Encyclopedic Lexicon of the English Language,</i> p. 636 (1906) defines \"both\" as \"The one and the other; <i>the two;</i> the pair or the couple, in reference to <i>two</i> persons or things....\"</p>\n<p>[54]  Further examination of the text of § 11 demonstrates that a single detachment petition may be used to transfer land to multiple townships. For example, § 11 states, \"The <i>several</i> city, village and township clerks who shall receive from the secretary of state the copies and certificates above provided shall give notice of the election to be held....\" The word \"several\" is defined by <i>The New American Encyclopedic Dictionary</i> (1907) as \"Consisting of a number; <i>more than two.</i>\" The use of \"several,\" therefore, also indicates that the Legislature envisioned a situation under which a single detachment petition could be used to transfer land to <i>multiple</i> townships. While it is true that \"several\" can also mean \"separate\" or \"individual\" -e.g., \"they go their <i>several</i> ways\"-such a meaning exists only in the context of a <i>plurality.</i> \"Several\" only indicates \"individual\" or \"separate\" if there is a larger collective whole to begin with.\n</p>\n<p>At oral argument, defense counsel conceded that the word \"several,\" as used in the HRCA, means \"more than a couple.\"</p>\n<p><i>Justice Young:</i> I'm asking you to look at section 11 that refers near the end: \"The several city, village and township clerks who shall receive from the Secretary of State copies of the certificates.\" I'm looking at the term \"several\" there. Does that not indicate at least the potential for multiple.</p>\n<p><i>Counsel:</i> Well again we go to kind of the dictionary look at the definition and \"several\" can mean one individual.</p>\n<p><i>Justice Young:</i> Really?</p>\n<p><i>Counsel:</i> I'm sorry, you're talking about a city, village or </p>\n<p><i>Justice Young:</i> Doesn't \"several\" mean more than a couple?</p>\n<p><i>Counsel:</i> Yes.</p>\n<p>[55]  MCL 117.11 (emphasis added). The word \"petition\" is used in the singular three other times in § 11:\n</p>\n<p>The secretary of state shall examine such <i>petition</i> and the affidavit or affidavits annexed.... If he shall find that said <i>petition</i> and the affidavit or affidavits annexed thereto do not conform to the provisions of this act he shall certify to that fact, and return said <i>petition</i> and affidavits to the person from whom they were received .... [<i>Id.</i> (emphasis added).]</p>\n<p>[56]  <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[57]  MCL 691.1407(2) provides:\n</p>\n<p>Except as otherwise provided in this section, and without regard to the discretionary or ministerial nature of the conduct in question, each officer and employee of a governmental agency ... is immune from tort liability for an injury to a person or damage to property caused by the officer, employee, or member while in the course of employment or service ... if all of the following are met:</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>(c) The officer's, employee's, member's, or volunteer's conduct does not amount to gross negligence that is <i>the proximate cause</i> of the injury or damage.

See, e.g., Gerken, <i>Understanding the right to an undiluted vote,</i> 114 Harv. L. R. 1663 (2001). The sole issue of contention here is one of pure numerical vote dilution. Defendants claim that <i>too many</i> township voters would be included in the voting base if these referenda are allowed to proceed, to the extent that city voters would no longer have a <i>meaningful</i> vote.</p>\n<p>[83]  While defendants allege violations of both the federal and state equal protection clauses, they base their vote dilution argument almost entirely on federal case law. They cite no Michigan cases analyzing vote dilution under Const. 1963, art. 1, § 2. Instead, defendants simply state in their brief that \"Michigan courts interpret the state equal protection clause similarly to the Fourteenth Amendment.\" City of Holland brief at 39.\n</p>\n<p>It is important to note that the text of our state Equal Protection Clause is not entirely the same as its federal counterpart:</p>\n<p>U.S. Const., Am. XIV provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p>No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; <i>nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.</i> [Emphasis added.]</p>\n<p>Const. 1963, art. 1, § 2 provides:</p>\n<p>No person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws; nor shall any person be denied the enjoyment of his civil or political rights or be discriminated against in the exercise thereof because of religion, race, color or national origin. The legislature shall implement this section by appropriate legislation.</p>\n<p>See also <i>Lind v.

XIV.</p>\n<p>Because defendants have failed to address vote dilution directly under Const. 1963, art. 1, § 2, I decline to examine the issue. As this Court stated in <i>Mitcham v. Detroit,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2081862\"><a href=\"/opinion/2081862/mitcham-v-city-of-detroit/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">182</span></a></span>, 203, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2081862\"><a href=\"/opinion/2081862/mitcham-v-city-of-detroit/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></a></span> (1959):</p>\n<p>It is not enough for an appellant in his brief simply to announce a position or assert an error and then leave it up to this Court to discover and rationalize the basis for his claims, or unravel and elaborate for him his arguments, and then search for authority either to sustain or reject his position. The appellant himself must first adequately prime the pump; only then does the appellate well begin to flow.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the constitutional provision upon which defendants base their argument, Const. 1963, art. 1, § 2, was not relied on by the Court of Appeals. It was Const. 1963, art. 1, § 1 that the Court of Appeals referenced in its opinion. <i>Casco Twp., supra,</i> 261 Mich.App. at 394 n. 27, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1866985\"><a href=\"/opinion/1866985/casco-twp-v-secretary-of-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">682</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">546</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, I analyze defendants' vote dilution argument solely under U.S. Const., Am. XIV-the issue that was fully briefed by the parties.</p>\n<p>[84]  As an initial matter, it is important to note that the state action requirement under Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence is satisfied here. Although the detachment petitions in both cases were circulated and signed by private citizens, the involvement of the Secretary of State in certifying the petitions and ordering local authorities to hold elections is sufficient to constitute state action. See, e.g. <i>Ellison v. Garbarino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"689937\"><a href=\"/opinion/689937/rick-r-ellison-v-aj-garbarino-md-william-m-hogan-md-stewart/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span>, 195 (C.A.6, 1995) (\"running elections\" is a \"typical example[ ]\" of state action).</p>\n<p>[85]  Professor Melvyn R. Durchslag has noted:\n</p>\n<p>Voter dilution cases fall into two broad categories. First, there are those in which dilution occurs because (1) some persons are given votes weighted more heavily than others similarly situated merely on the basis of residence, (2) votes are weighted according to a factor which the state determines is reflective of \"interest,\" or (3) persons are excluded altogether from voting because the state deems them to be \"uninterested.\" Second, there are those in which dilution occurs because equal franchise is <i>granted</i> to persons allegedly without interest, or with significantly less interest than other voters.

Commentators have questioned the Supreme Court's reliance on the Equal Protection Clause in <i>Baker,</i> suggesting, instead, that the Republican Form of Government Clause, U.S. Const., art. IV, § 4, would have been more appropriate. As Judge Michael W. McConnell has written:\n</p>\n<p>A districting scheme so malapportioned that a minority faction is in complete control, without regard to democratic sentiment, violates the basic norms of republican government. It would thus appear to raise a constitutional question under Article IV, Section 4, which states that \"the United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government.\" Constitutional standards under the Republican Form of Government Clause are ill-developed, but surely a government is not \"republican\" if a minority faction maintains control, and the majority has no means of overturning it. [McConnell, <i>The redistricting cases: Original mistakes and current consequences,</i> 24 Harv. J. L. &amp; Pub. Policy 103, 105-106 (2000).]</p>\n<p>Professor Pamela S. Karlan has noted:</p>\n<p>[T]he doctrinal move to one person, one vote was in no sense compelled, either by precedent or by the absence of any alternative avenues to judicial oversight. The decision to rely on the Equal Protection Clause, rather than on the Guaranty Clause, has always puzzled me. Justice William Brennan's explanation-that there was precedent suggesting the general nonjusticiability of the Guaranty Clause-would make more sense if not for the fact that there was also absolutely square precedent refusing to entertain malapportionment claims under the Fourteenth Amendment [citing <i>Colegrove</i>]. If the Court had to overrule some precedent to review apportionment and the refusal to reapportion, then why was overruling Fourteenth Amendment precedent-and developing a unique set of equal protection principles that apply nowhere else in constitutional law-the superior alternative?

In dissent, Justice Frankfurter sharply criticized the Court for casting aside the \"political question\" rationale of <i>Colegrove.</i> He challenged the majority's conclusion that courts were equipped to handle such voting rights cases. Justice Frankfurter stated:\n</p>\n<p>The Framers carefully and with deliberate forethought refused . . . to enthrone the judiciary. In this situation, as in others of like nature, appeal for relief does not belong here. Appeal must be to an informed, civically militant electorate. . . .</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>Unless judges, the judges of this Court, are to make their private views of political wisdom the measure of the Constitution-views which in all honesty cannot but give the appearance, if not reflect the reality, of involvement with the business of partisan politics so inescapably a part of apportionment controversies-the Fourteenth Amendment, \"itself a historical product,\" provides no guide for judicial oversight of the representation problem.

As discussed in n. 6 of this opinion, an annexation of territory that contains one hundred or fewer residents is subject only to approval by the SBC. MCL 117.9(4).\n</p>\n<p>Justice Levin recognized the gamesmanship that occurs between cities and townships in <i>Midland Twp, supra</i> at 679[, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1243449\"><a href=\"/opinion/1243449/midland-twp-v-boundary-comm/\"><span class=\"volume\">259</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">326</span></a></span>], stating that \"[c]ity and township strategies based on [the one hundred-resident referendum threshold] are unavoidable. In general, the city will seek to limit the area proposed for annexation so that there are insufficient residents for a referendum and the township will seek to extend the area to require a referendum. The motive or purpose of the city or township in drawing the proposed boundaries or in requesting a revision of boundaries is not material.\"</p>\n<p>[118]  In addition to minimizing the effects of population disparities between cities and townships, there are numerous other reasons why the Legislature may have permitted the use of a single petition to transfer land to multiple townships. For example, it is possible that the Legislature recognized the substantial financial expense that townships and cities face when holding elections and that, by combining numerous detachments in one election, it would be less expensive for the taxpayers to have a single election than to have several separate detachment elections.</p>\n<p>[119]  I find the cases on which defendants rely unpersuasive. In <i>Hayward v. Clay,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"354232\"><a href=\"/opinion/354232/marion-hayward-delores-grant-nancy-little-lawrence-m-libater-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">573</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></a></span> (C.A.4, 1978), the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals applied strict scrutiny to an annexation proceeding that required separate majority approval by freeholders. <i>Hayward</i> is easily distinguishable from the present cases. <i>Hayward</i> involved a grant of disproportionate voting strength to <i>freeholders.</i> No such land-based distinction in voting strength exists in the present cases. Instead, the franchise is extended to <i>all</i> registered voters in the affected municipalities, regardless of land ownership status. Defendants also cite <i>Carlyn v. City of Akron,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"430669\"><a href=\"/opinion/430669/donald-e-carlyn-v-city-of-akron/\"><span class=\"volume\">726</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">287</span></a></span> (C.A.6, 1984), in which the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals <i>refused</i> to apply strict scrutiny to an annexation proceeding. While I appreciate the dicta that defendants cite from <i>Carlyn</i> regarding when strict scrutiny is to apply, I would choose instead to base our resolution of this federal law question on clear precedent from the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>[120]  Indeed, <i>Lockport</i> and <i>Hunter,</i> taken together, illustrate that any claim of vote dilution in the municipal boundary change context will be difficult to sustain, absent dilution based on some suspect category such as race. The Supreme Court explicitly rejected \"dilution by <i>aggregation</i>\" in <i>Hunter</i> and \"dilution by <i>disproportionate weight</i>\" in <i>Lockport.</i> With both types of dilution having been flatly rejected by the Supreme Court, it seems quite clear that such cases are not viewed as traditional vote dilution matters, but as matters involving a state's absolute authority over municipal boundaries.</p>\n<p>[121]  As Professor Briffault has written in discussing the effect of <i>Lockport:</i>\n</p>\n<p>To apply strict scrutiny to the distribution of the vote concerning boundary changes would inevitably entail a constitutional review of the states' municipal formation and boundary change policies. But there are no generally accepted principles for determining whether a particular local government ought to exist, what that unit's geographic dimensions ought to be, or whether a particular territory ought to be in that or another local unit. Thus, deference to the states is consistent with both the lack of a constitutional vantage point for examining state municipal formation and boundary change policies and the traditional jurisprudence of federalism that treats local governments as state instrumentalities and leaves the creation and structure of local governments to the states.
