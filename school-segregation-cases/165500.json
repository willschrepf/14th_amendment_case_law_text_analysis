GAITHER,\n by and through Pearl Gaither, Personal\n Representative,\n\n           Plaintiff,\n                                                           Civil Action No. 03-01458 (CKK)\n      v.\n\n DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, et al.,\n\n           Defendants.\n\n\n                                  MEMORANDUM OPINION\n                                    (December 19, 2011)\n\n       Plaintiff Pearl Gaither (“Plaintiff”), the representative of the estate of Mikal R. Gaither\n\n(“Gaither”), brings this action against the District of Columbia and a series of Individual\n\nDefendants seeking damages in connection with Gaither’s fatal stabbing while he was\n\nincarcerated pending sentencing at the District of Columbia’s Central Detention Facility. The\n\nIndividual Defendants in this case fall into two groups: (1) Odie Washington, Marvin L. Brown,\n\nand Dennis Harrison, three high-ranking officials in the District of Columbia’s Department of\n\nCorrections or the Central Detention Facility; and (2) Zerline Brooks (“Brooks”), Gounod\n\nToppin (“Toppin”), and Joseph White (“White”), the three line officers that were assigned to\n\nGaither’s cellblock on the day of his death (collectively, the “Defendant Correctional Officers”).\n\n       In this case, Plaintiff claims, among other things, that the Defendant Correctional Officers\n\nviolated 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (“Section 1983”) by acting with “deliberate indifference” to a serious\n\nrisk of inmate-on-inmate violence that threatened Gaither’s safety and proximately caused his\n\ndeath, in contravention of his rights under the Fifth and Eighth Amendments to the United States\n\fConstitution. Currently before the Court is the Defendant Correctional Officers’ [232/233]\n\nMotion for Summary Judgment as to Plaintiff’s Constitutional Claims Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1983 (“Motion for Summary Judgment”). Relying upon the doctrine of qualified immunity, the\n\nDefendant Correctional Officers now seek judgment in their favor on Plaintiff’s Section 1983\n\nclaims against them in their personal capacities. Upon careful consideration of the parties’\n\nsubmissions, the relevant authorities, and the record as a whole, the Court shall GRANT the\n\nDefendant Correctional Officers’ [232/233] Motion for Summary Judgment.\n\n                                      I. BACKGROUND\n\n       The Court assumes familiarity with its prior opinions in this action, which set forth in\n\ndetail the extensive factual and procedural background of this case.\n\n       A.      Factual Background\n\n       On December 14, 2002, at approximately 5:40 p.m., Gaither was fatally stabbed by fellow\n\ninmates while incarcerated in the District’s Central Detention Facility. See Estate of Gaither ex\n\nrel. Gaither v. District of Columbia (“Gaither1”), 655 F. Supp. 2d 69, 74 (D.D.C. 2009). At the\n\ntime of his death, Gaither was awaiting sentencing in the Superior Court of the District of\n\nColumbia, having already pleaded guilty to one felony count of distribution of cocaine. See id. at\n\n75. The District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department conducted an investigation into\n\nthe incident, ultimately concluding that two of Gaither’s fellow inmates had forced Gaither into\n\nan open cell and proceeded to stab him, resulting in his death. See id. at 75-76. Subsequently, a\n\ngrand jury found that Gaither had been killed because of his involvement in a separate grand jury\n\ninvestigation into the murder of an individual by the name of Kenneth Muldrow. See id. at 76.\n\n       At the time of his stabbing, Gaither was located in the Northeast Three Cellblock (“NE-\n\n\n                                                2\n\f3”) of the Central Detention Facility. The Defendant Correctional Officers—Brooks, Toppin,\n\nand White—were the line officers that were assigned to NE-3 that day. Pl.’s Resp. to Def.\n\nCorrectional Officers’ Stmt. of Material Fact to Which There Is No Genuine Dispute (“Pl.’s\n\nResp. Stmt.”), ECF No. [238], ¶¶ 1-3; Resp. to Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. Regarding Material Facts and\n\nSuppl. to Def. Correctional Officers’ Stmt. of Material Facts Not in Dispute (“Defs.’ Reply\n\nStmt.”), ECF No. [240-1], ¶¶ 1-3. Toppin was the “bubble officer” and was designated as the\n\n“Officer-in-Charge.” Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶¶ 19, 38; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶¶ 19, 38. Brooks and\n\nWhite were serving as “floor officers.” Dep. of Zerline W. Brooks (“Brooks Dep.”), ECF Nos.\n\n[233-2], [238-1], at 17, 119. None of the Defendant Correctional Officers witnessed Gaither’s\n\nstabbing. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 48; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶ 48.\n\n       The Defendant Correctional Officers were required to maintain supervision over the\n\ncellblock at all times. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 49; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶ 49. It is undisputed that the\n\nDefendant Correctional Officers did not have a role in establishing formal policies at the Central\n\nDetention Facility. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶¶ 4-6; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶¶ 4-6. Nonetheless, at the time\n\nof Gaither’s stabbing, the Central Detention Facility’s “critical minimum staffing” policy\n\nrequired the presence of three correctional officers in NE-3 at all times.1 Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 33;\n\nDefs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶ 33. It was impossible to maintain visual supervision over the entire\n\n\n\n       1\n          Although the Defendant Correctional Officers fail to dispute this proffered factual\nstatement, they assert at other points in their briefing that the applicable staffing policy only\nrequired the presence of two correctional officers in NE-3. As the Court has previously had the\nopportunity to observe, the evidence on this point is contradictory and the issue is not amenable\nto resolution at this stage of the proceedings. Gaither1, 655 F. Supp. 2d at 89-91. For purposes\nof resolving the pending motion, the Court shall draw the inference most favorable to Plaintiff as\nthe non-movant—namely, that the critical minimum staffing policy at the time of the incident\nrequired the presence of three correctional officers in NE-3.\n\n                                                 3\n\fcellblock with less than three correctional officers. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 35; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶\n\n35. The “bubble officer” could not see into the cells, parts of the gym, and several areas of the\n\ncellblock tiers. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 35; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶ 35. Meanwhile, a single “floor\n\nofficer” could not see cells on the opposite side of the cellblock or on the other side of the tier.\n\nPl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 35; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶ 35. The difficulties in supervising inmates on the\n\ncellblock were compounded when all 160 inmates housed in NE-3 were released from their cells\n\nat once. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 37; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶ 37.\n\n       In December 2002, two similar incidents of violence at the Central Detention Facility\n\npreceded Gaither’s stabbing, albeit in different cellblocks. While the Defendant Correctional\n\nOfficers maintain that they were unaware of these prior incidents, there is evidence in the record\n\nthat would permit a reasonable trier of fact to infer that such information was passed on to the\n\nDefendant Correctional Officers at roll calls prior to Gaither’s stabbing. Dep. of Gary A. Binson\n\n(“Binson Dep.”), ECF Nos. [233-3], [238-2], at 133, 138-39; Dep. of Marvin L. Brown (“Brown\n\nDep.”), ECF No. [238-3], at 228-30; Am. Resps. to Reqs. for Admission, ECF No. [238-15], at\n\n5-6.\n\n               1.      Defendant Brooks\n\n       At the time Gaither was attacked, there were only two guards physically present at NE-\n\n3—Toppin and White. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 11; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶ 11. Brooks left NE-3 at 5:30\n\np.m., shortly before Gaither was stabbed, in order to escort four diabetic inmates to the facility’s\n\ninfirmary to receive insulin shots. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 7; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶ 7. Upon her return\n\nto NE-3 at approximately 5:40 p.m., Brooks noticed Gaither running from the top right tier of the\n\ncellblock covered in blood. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 21; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶ 21.\n\n\n                                                   4\n\f       When Brooks left NE-3, the inmates on the cellblock were in the process of being fed.\n\nStmt. of Material Fact to Which There Is No Genuine Issue (“Defs.’ Stmt.”), ECF No. [233], ¶ 9;\n\nPl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 9. It is unclear whether the inmates were locked in their cells. Brooks Dep. at\n\n22; Dep. of Gounod Toppin (“Toppin Dep.”), ECF Nos. [233-1], [238-4], at 197, 200-01; Pl.’s\n\nEx. 5 at DC014137. For purposes of the pending motion, the lack of clarity is immaterial. The\n\nCommand Center had “cleared the count” for NE-3 at 5:15 p.m., shortly before Brooks left the\n\ncellblock. Brooks Dep. at 38-39, 80-81; Pl.’s Ex. 5 at DC014137. Brooks concedes that, once\n\nthe count is cleared by the Command Center, the guards on the cellblock release the inmates\n\nfrom their cells. Brooks Dep. at 38-39. Therefore, a reasonable trier of fact could infer that\n\nBrooks could have anticipated that it was likely that the inmates on NE-3 would be released\n\nsometime around the time she left the cellblock. The parties agree that Brooks did not make the\n\ndecision to release the inmates, whenever it occurred. Defs.’ Stmt. ¶ 25; Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 25.\n\n       It is undisputed that Brooks was ordered by Toppin to leave NE-3 to escort inmates to the\n\ninfirmary. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 39; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶ 39. Consistent with this account, Brooks\n\ntestified at her deposition that she had no discretion in the matter. Brooks Dep. at 65, 138.\n\nNonetheless, Plaintiff maintains, with support in the record, that escorting inmates to the\n\ninfirmary for insulin shots would not constitute the kind of emergency necessary to drop below\n\nthe critical staffing requirement for the cellblock. Binson Dep. at 31-36; Brown Dep. at 93-94.\n\nInstead, the appropriate response would have been to wait for a relief officer to be dispatched\n\nfrom the Command Center or to contact the Command Center to obtain such relief. Binson Dep.\n\nat 31-36; Brown Dep. at 93-94.\n\n       At her deposition taken several years after the incident, Brooks testified that it “bothers”\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fher when there are less than three correctional officers in the cellblock. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 36;\n\nDefs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶ 36. Indeed, Brooks testified that you “really need four” correctional\n\nofficers. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 36; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶ 36; Brooks Dep. at 46-47, 88-90. Although\n\nPlaintiff challenges Brooks’ failure to obtain relief prior to escorting inmates to the infirmary, it\n\nis undisputed that she played no role in the assignment of correctional officers to NE-3. Defs.’\n\nStmt. ¶ 29; Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 29.\n\n                2.      Defendant Toppin\n\n        On the day of the incident, Toppin was the “bubble officer” and was designated as the\n\n“Officer-in-Charge.” Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶¶ 19, 38; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶¶ 19, 38. In that role,\n\nToppin was responsible for making sure that relief was available prior to any officer leaving the\n\ncellblock. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 38; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶ 38.\n\n        Toppin ordered Brooks to leave NE-3 to escort inmates to the infirmary to receive insulin\n\nshots. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 39; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶ 39. Toppin did so without attempting to\n\nsecure relief for Brooks’ post. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 39; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶ 39. According to\n\nPlaintiff, this was a violation of the facility’s policy because it failed to maintain the critical\n\nstaffing complement on the cellblock and Toppin should have instead called his supervisor to\n\nsecure a relief officer to escort the inmates to the infirmary. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 39; Defs.’ Reply\n\nStmt. ¶ 39. At his deposition, Toppin explained that the Post Orders2 for NE-3 at the time only\n\nrequired two guards to be in the cellblock at all times. Toppin Dep. at 222-23. However, the\n\nPost Orders themselves do not address specific staffing numbers, but instead refer to “post\n\n\n\n        2\n           The Post Orders are designed to “[e]stablish policies and procedures for the safe,\nefficient and orderly operation of Housing Unit Northeast Three.” Pl.’s Ex. 7 at DC013063.\n\n                                                    6\n\fanalysis charts” that have never been produced in this case. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 12; Defs.’ Reply\n\nStmt. ¶ 12. In any event, at his deposition taken several years after the incident, Toppin testified\n\nthat he personally believed it was “impossible” to provide a “reasonable level of security” over\n\n160 inmates in NE-3 with only two correctional officers. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 36; Defs.’ Reply\n\nStmt. ¶ 36.\n\n       Toppin was “unaware that there was a separate post for relief officers.” Pl.’s Resp. Stmt.\n\n¶ 39 (citing Toppin Dep. at 63). Rather, Toppin appears to have been operating under the\n\nunderstanding that one of the three officers assigned to NE-3 was, in effect, the “relief officer”\n\nfor the shift. Toppin Dep. at 62-63. However, staffing rosters from the day of the incident show\n\nthat six officers were assigned to “Relief/Escort” above and beyond the staffing assignments for\n\neach cellblock. Pl.’s Ex. 12 at DC011269.\n\n               3.      Officer White\n\n       At the time of Gaither’s stabbing, White was manually closing the cell doors on the lower\n\nright tier of NE-3. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶¶ 40-41; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶¶ 40-41. Policy required\n\nclosing cell doors immediately after they were opened in order to keep inmates from gaining\n\naccess to other inmates’ cells. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 43; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶ 43. Closing the cell\n\ndoors manually was a lengthy process that could take a single guard as long as an hour to\n\ncomplete. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 42; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶ 42.\n\n       B.      Procedural Background\n\n       Plaintiff brings this action as the personal representative of Gaither estate. The\n\nprocedural history of the case is extensive and has been recited at length elsewhere. Over the\n\nyears, the Court has resolved a litany of discovery-related motions, dispositive motions, and\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fmotions for reconsideration. More recently in the litigation, the Court granted Plaintiff leave to\n\nfile a Third Amended Complaint in order to articulate an alternative theory of liability. See\n\nEstate of Gaither ex rel. Gaither v. District of Columbia, 272 F.R.D. 248 (D.D.C. 2011). In her\n\nThird Amended Complaint, Plaintiff claims, among other things, that the Defendant Correctional\n\nOfficers violated Section 1983 by acting with “deliberate indifference” to a serious risk of\n\ninmate-on-inmate violence that threatened Gaither’s safety and proximately caused his death, in\n\ncontravention of his rights under the Fifth and Eighth Amendments to the United States\n\nConstitution. See Third Am. Compl., ECF No. [228], ¶¶ 59-61, 69-78.\n\n       As a result of this development, which modestly expanded the legal scope of Plaintiff’s\n\nconstitutional claims, the Court granted the Defendant Correctional Officers leave to revisit their\n\nqualified immunity defense in a supplemental motion for summary judgment. See Mem. Op. and\n\nOrder, ECF No. [225]. Previously, the Court had found the Defendant Correctional Officers’\n\ntreatment of the qualified immunity issue wanting, and had denied them summary judgment on\n\nthat basis. See Gaither1, 655 F. Supp. 2d at 94-99.\n\n       In accordance with the schedule set by the Court, the Defendant Correctional Officers\n\nfiled the pending Motion for Summary Judgment. See Mem. of P. & A. in Supp. of Defs. Joseph\n\nWhite, Zerline Brooks and Gonoud [sic] Toppin’s Mot. Judgment [sic] Plaintiff’s [sic] Claims\n\n[sic] Constitutional Claims Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (“Defs.’ Mem.”), ECF No. [233].\n\nPlaintiff filed an opposition. See Pl.’s Mem. of Law in Opp’n to Def. Correctional Officers’ Am.\n\nMot. for Summ. J. (“Pl.’s Opp’n”), ECF No. [237]. The Defendant Correctional Officers filed a\n\nreply. See Reply Br. to Pl.’s Mem. of P. & A. in Opp’n to Defs. Joseph White, Zerline Brooks\n\nand Gonoud [sic] Toppin’s Am. Mot. for Summ. J. as to Pl.’s Constitutional Claims Pursuant to\n\n\n                                                 8\n\f42 U.S.C. § 1983 (“Defs.’ Reply”), ECF No. [240]. The motion is therefore fully briefed and\n\nripe for a decision. In an exercise of its discretion, the Court finds that holding oral argument on\n\nthe motion would not assist the Court in rendering its decision. See LCV R 7(f).\n\n                                     II. LEGAL STANDARD\n\n        Summary judgment is appropriate where “the movant shows that there is no genuine\n\ndispute as to any material fact and [that it] . . . is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” FED .\n\nR. CIV . P. 56(a). The mere existence of some factual dispute is insufficient on its own to bar\n\nsummary judgment; the dispute must pertain to a “material” fact. Id. Accordingly, “[o]nly\n\ndisputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will\n\nproperly preclude the entry of summary judgment.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S.\n\n242, 255 (1986). Nor may summary judgment be avoided based on just any disagreement as to\n\nthe relevant facts; the dispute must be “genuine,” meaning that there must be sufficient\n\nadmissible evidence for a reasonable trier of fact to find for the non-movant. Id.\n\n        In order to establish that a fact is or cannot be genuinely disputed, a party must (a) cite to\n\nspecific parts of the record—including deposition testimony, documentary evidence, affidavits or\n\ndeclarations, or other competent evidence—in support of its position, or (b) demonstrate that the\n\nmaterials relied upon by the opposing party do not actually establish the absence or presence of a\n\ngenuine dispute. FED . R. CIV . P. 56(c)(1). Conclusory assertions offered without any factual\n\nbasis in the record cannot create a genuine dispute sufficient to survive summary judgment.\n\nAss’n of Flight Attendants-CWA, AFL-CIO v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., 564 F.3d 462, 465-66 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2009). Moreover, where “a party fails to properly support an assertion of fact or fails to\n\nproperly address another party’s assertion of fact,” the district court may “consider the fact\n\n\n                                                   9\n\fundisputed for purposes of the motion.” FED . R. CIV . P. 56(e).\n\n       When faced with a motion for summary judgment, the district court may not make\n\ncredibility determinations or weigh the evidence; instead, the evidence must be analyzed in the\n\nlight most favorable to the non-movant, with all justifiable inferences drawn in his, her, or its\n\nfavor. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 255. If material facts are genuinely in dispute, or undisputed\n\nfacts are susceptible to divergent yet justifiable inferences, summary judgment is inappropriate.\n\nMoore v. Hartman, 571 F.3d 62, 66 (D.C. Cir. 2009). In the end, the district court’s task is to\n\ndetermine “whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a\n\njury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.” Liberty Lobby,\n\n477 U.S. at 251-52. In this regard, the non-movant must “do more than simply show that there is\n\nsome metaphysical doubt as to the material facts,” Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith\n\nRadio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986); “[i]f the evidence is merely colorable, or is not\n\nsufficiently probative, summary judgment may be granted,” Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 249-50\n\n(internal citations omitted).\n\n                                III. PRELIMINARY MATTERS\n\n       As a preliminary matter, Plaintiff argues that the Defendant Correctional Officers’\n\n[232/233] Motion for Summary Judgment should be denied outright and in its entirety because,\n\nin contravention of this Court’s prior instructions, their opening memorandum cites directly to\n\nevidence in the record rather than to their statement of material facts. See Pl.’s Opp’n at 7-8.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not the first time that the Court has had the opportunity to address the\n\nDefendant Correctional Officers’ chosen approach. Previously, in connection with the very same\n\nsubject matter underlying the pending Motion for Summary Judgment, the Court chastised the\n\n\n                                                 10\n\fDefendant Correctional Officers for “fail[ing] to couple their factual arguments with specific\n\ncitations to their accompanying statement of material facts and instead improperly cit[ing]\n\ndirectly to evidence in the record.” Mem. Op. and Order, ECF No. [225], at 6. As the Court\n\nobserved then, such an approach “obscure[s] whether the facts relied upon [are] disputed.” Id.\n\n       Despite this admonition, the Defendant Correctional Officers’ opening memorandum in\n\nconnection with the pending Motion for Summary Judgment adopts the identical approach\n\npreviously found wanting by the Court. Conspicuously absent from the Defendant Correctional\n\nOfficers’ opening memorandum is a single reference to their statement of materials facts.\n\nInstead, the Defendant Correctional Officers once again cite exclusively to evidence in the\n\nrecord.3 Once again, this obscures whether the facts relied upon by the Defendant Correctional\n\nOfficers are disputed and “impermissibly shifts counsel’s burden to locate and identify the\n\nrelevant facts, and leaves this Court to guess which of the many factual statements set forth in\n\n[the Defendant Correctional Officers’ opening memorandum] are disputed and, if disputed,\n\nwhether the dispute is genuine.” Glass v. LaHood, 786 F. Supp. 2d 189, 199 (D.D.C.), aff’d, No.\n\n11-5144 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 8, 2011) (unpublished summary affirmance). As the Defendant\n\nCorrectional Officers were previously warned, such an approach is unacceptable.\n\n       Counsel for the Defendant Correctional Officers, C. Vaughn Adams, Esq., admits the\n\nnon-compliance, explaining that he cited directly to evidence in the record “[t]hrough habit\n\ndeveloped during years of practice” and submitting that the Defendant Correctional Officers\n\n“should not be penalized” for counsel’s error. Defs.’ Reply at 2. Of course, the Court would\n\n\n       3\n           In contrast, the Defendant Correctional Officers’ reply memorandum cites to the\nparties’ statements of material facts, directly referencing evidence in the record only for purposes\nof emphasizing key facts, areas of disagreement, and the like.\n\n                                                 11\n\fexpect that one “habit” that would be developed during years of practice is adherence to the\n\ninstructions of the presiding judge, but the Court shall not belabor the point. Under the unique\n\ncircumstances in this case, the Court declines to exercise its discretion to visit the “sins of\n\ncounsel” upon the innocent Defendant Correctional Officers by denying the pending Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment outright and in its entirety, a step that would deprive the Defendant\n\nCorrectional Officers of their qualified immunity defense, which implicates an immunity from\n\nsuit that is effectively lost if this case proceeds to trial. Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526\n\n(1985). Nonetheless, the Court declines to sift through the Defendant Correctional Officers’\n\nsubmissions in order to crystallize the record for the parties. In an exercise of the Court’s\n\ndiscretion, factual assertions absent from the parties’ statements of material facts or not readily\n\ndiscernible from the face of the parties’ pleadings shall be disregarded. To the extent this affects\n\nthe outcome of the pending motion, the fault and accountability must rest with the Defendant\n\nCorrectional Officers, and not Plaintiff or this Court.\n\n                                         IV. DISCUSSION\n\n       Through her Section 1983 claims, Plaintiff contends that the Defendant Correctional\n\nOfficers acted with “deliberate indifference” to a serious risk of inmate-on-inmate violence that\n\nthreatened Gaither’s safety and proximately caused his death, in violation of his rights under the\n\nFifth and Eighth Amendments to the United States Constitution.4 It is well-established that\n\n“prison officials have a duty to protect prisoners from violence at the hand of other prisoners.”\n\n\n       4\n           It remains to be definitively resolved which Amendment should apply to the facts of\nthis case, something that turns on Gaither’s detention status at the time of his death. See\nGaither1, 655 F. Supp. 2d at 84-88. However, because the parties are in agreement that the legal\nprinciples governing the pending motion are identical under both Amendments, the Court need\nnot, and shall not, resolve the matter here.\n\n                                                  12\n\fFarmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 831, 833 (1994) (internal quotation marks, notations, and citation\n\nomitted). Plaintiff can prevail on her claim if she establishes both (1) that the challenged\n\nconditions of incarceration posed a “substantial risk of serious harm,” and (2) that the Defendant\n\nCorrectional Officers’ state of mind was one of “deliberate indifference” to inmate health or\n\nsafety. Id. at 834.\n\n       By its terms, this standard requires “more than mere negligence.” Id. at 835. While a\n\ndefendant need not act with “the purpose of causing harm” or the “knowledge that the harm will\n\nresult,” he must nonetheless be deliberately indifferent. Id. “[I]t is not enough . . . that the guard\n\nought to have recognized the risk,” Riccardo v. Rausch, 375 F.3d 521, 526 (7th Cir. 2004)\n\n(emphasis in original); he must both know of and disregard an excessive risk to inmate health or\n\nsafety, Farmer, 511 U.S. at 835. In other words, not only must the defendant be “aware of facts\n\nfrom which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of harm exists,” he must actually\n\nand consciously “draw the inference.” Id. at 837. Thus, a plaintiff may not recover based on “an\n\nofficial’s failure to alleviate a significant risk that he should have perceived but did not.” Id. at\n\n838. “Whether a prison official had the requisite knowledge of a substantial risk is a question of\n\nfact subject to demonstration in the usual ways, including inference from circumstantial\n\nevidence, and a factfinder may conclude that a prison official knew of a substantial risk from the\n\nvery fact that the risk was obvious.” Id. at 842 (internal citations and quotations omitted); see\n\nalso Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 736, 738 (2002) (the district court “may infer the existence of this\n\nsubjective state of mind from the fact that the risk of harm is obvious”).\n\n       In this case, Plaintiff contends that the Defendant Correctional Officers were “deliberately\n\nindifferent” by exposing the inmates in NE-3, including Gaither, to a substantial threat of an\n\n\n                                                  13\n\finmate-on-inmate attack. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant Correctional Officers\n\n“left the unit woefully understaffed, failed to maintain supervision over the inmates, released all\n\ninmates from their cells to roam freely about, allowed the cell doors to remain open for an\n\nextended periods [sic] of time, violated numerous jail policies, and displayed a complete\n\ndisregard to the unsafe conditions of the jail.” Pl.’s Opp’n at 21; see generally Third Am.\n\nCompl., ECF No. [228], ¶¶ 59-61, 69-78.\n\n        In their [232/233] Motion for Summary Judgment, the Defendant Correctional Officers\n\nargue that they enjoy qualified immunity from Plaintiff’s Section 1983 claims against them in\n\ntheir personal capacities. “Qualified immunity shields federal and state officials from suit unless\n\na plaintiff alleges facts showing (1) that the official violated a statutory or constitutional right,\n\nand (2) that the right was ‘clearly established’ at the time of the challenged conduct.” Ashcroft v.\n\nAl-Kidd, __ U.S. __, 131 S. Ct. 2074, 2080 (2011) (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800,\n\n818 (1982)). “[C]onduct violates clearly established law when, at the time of the challenged\n\nconduct, the contours of a right are sufficiently clear that every reasonable officer would have\n\nunderstood that what he is doing violates that right.” Id. at 2083 (internal quotation marks and\n\nnotations omitted) (quoting Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987)). The district court\n\nhas the discretion to decide “which of the two prongs of the qualified immunity analysis should\n\nbe addressed first in light of the circumstances in the particular case at hand.” Pearson v.\n\nCallahan, 555 U.S. 223, 236 (2009). In this case, the Court’s analysis begins and ends with the\n\nsecond prong of the qualified immunity inquiry.5 For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds\n\n\n        5\n         Plaintiff suggests that the Court should read the Defendant Correctional Officers’\nMotion for Summary Judgment as confined to the first prong of the qualified immunity analysis.\nSuch a miserly interpretation is unwarranted. While the Defendant Correctional Officers’ papers\n\n                                                   14\n\fthat the contours of the right at issue in this case were not sufficiently clear that every reasonable\n\nofficer would have understood that the Defendant Correctional Officers’ actions violated that\n\nright.\n\n         The second prong of the qualified immunity analysis “insulates officials from liability\n\nwhen a legal question governing their conduct is unclear, not when a jury question concerning\n\ntheir conduct is close.” Harris v. District of Columbia, 932 F.2d 10, 16 n.4 (D.C. Cir. 1991)\n\n(emphasis in original). Succinctly stated, “[i]f the law did not put the officer on notice that his\n\nconduct would be clearly unlawful, summary judgment based on qualified immunity is\n\nappropriate.” Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 202 (2001) (emphasis added). As a result, qualified\n\nimmunity operates to protect an officer when he “makes a decision that, even if constitutionally\n\ndeficient, reasonably misapprehends the law governing the circumstances she confronted.”\n\nBrosseau v. Haugen, 543 U.S. 199, 198 (2004) (per curiam) (citing Saucier, 533 U.S. at 206).\n\n“When properly applied, it protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly\n\nviolate the law.” Al-Kidd, 131 S. Ct. at 2085 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n         In her opposition, Plaintiff argues at considerable length that the alleged constitutional\n\nviolation was “clearly established” at the time of Gaither’s death. See Pl.’s Opp’n at 20-23. In\n\nso doing, she cites to a total of five cases addressing the “deliberate indifference” standard. Two\n\nof those decisions—Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 736 (2002), and Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 831\n\n\ncertainly could and should have been more clear—for example, by segregating their analysis\nbetween the two prongs—their papers were sufficient to put Plaintiff on notice that both prongs\nof the qualified immunity analysis were in dispute. See, e.g., Defs.’ Mem. at 12 (claiming that\nthe Defendant Correctional Officers “in good faith believed that their actions were reasonable\nand lawful”). In any event, because Plaintiff has already taken the opportunity to address the\nsecond prong at great length in her opposition, the Court shall, in an exercise of its discretion,\nreach the issue here. See Pl.’s Opp’n at 20-23.\n\n                                                  15\n\f(1994)—originate from the United States Supreme Court. One—Morgan v. District of\n\nColumbia, 824 F.2d 1049 (D.C. Cir. 1987)—originates from the United States Court of Appeals\n\nfor the District of Columbia Circuit. Two more—Hardy v. District of Columbia, 601 F. Supp. 2d\n\n182 (D.D.C. 2009), and Austin v. District of Columbia, Civil Action No. 05-2219 (JDB), 2007\n\nWL 1404444, at *9 (D.D.C. May 11, 2007)—originate from this Court.\n\n       A.      Plaintiff’s Reliance on Decisions from this Court Post-Dating the Conduct at\n\n               Issue is Misplaced\n\n       It appears from this collection of cases that Plaintiff misapprehends how the “clearly\n\nestablished” inquiry actually works in practice. As an initial matter,“[b]ecause the focus is on\n\nwhether the officer had fair notice that her conduct was unlawful, reasonableness is judged\n\nagainst the backdrop of the law at the time of the conduct.” Brosseau, 543 U.S. at 198 (emphasis\n\nadded). For this reason, with one exception that is of no help to Plaintiff,6 decisions post-dating\n\nthe conduct at issue “are of no use in the clearly established inquiry.” Id. at 200 n.4. In this case,\n\nbecause the challenged conduct occurred on December 14, 2002, Plaintiff’s reliance on Hardy\n\nand Austin, which were decided in 2009 and 2007 respectively, is misplaced.\n\n       Even if this were not the case, there is an established hierarchy of legal authority that\n\nPlaintiff altogether ignores. In evaluating whether the constitutional violation was “clearly\n\nestablished,” this Court’s first resort is to cases from the United States Supreme Court and the\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and only thereafter to cases\n\nfrom other courts “exhibiting a consensus view—if there is one.” Bame, 637 F.3d at 384\n\n\n       6\n          Cases post-dating the challenged conduct may be considered if they reflect the\n“uncertain state of the law” at the relevant point in time. Bame v. Dillard, 637 F.3d 380, 384\n(D.C. Cir. 2011); see also infra Part IV.D.\n\n                                                 16\n\f(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Absent controlling authority from the Supreme\n\nCourt or the Court of Appeals, the consensus view must be “robust.” Al-Kidd, 131 S. Ct. at\n\n2084. However, neither Hardy nor Austin reflect a robust consensus view that is relevant to the\n\nactual facts at issue in this case.\n\n        True, in Hardy, this Court was faced with comparable allegations that prison guards\n\nfailed to supervise, monitor, and deter inmate-on-inmate assaults. See Hardy, 601 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n186, 189-90. However, in finding that the plaintiffs in that case alleged enough factual matter to\n\nstate a sufficiently plausible “deliberate indifference” claim to survive a motion to dismiss, the\n\nCourt emphasized that the defendants in that case were alleged to be “at the top of the chain of\n\ncommand,” possessing “complete knowledge of the long history” of violations at the facility in\n\nquestion. Id. at 190. Indeed, they were among the highest-ranking officials responsible for\n\nsupervising the facility, and were therefore uniquely positioned to make policy decisions\n\naffecting inmate health and safety. In sharp contrast, the Defendant Correctional Officers are\n\nmerely the line officers that were assigned to Gaither’s cellblock on the day in question. Even\n\nassuming, counter-factually, that Hardy had been decided prior to Gaither’s death, nothing in that\n\ndecision would have put the Defendant Correctional Officers on notice that their actions would\n\nbe adjudged as if they, again counter-factually, had the authority to make wide-ranging changes\n\nto the operations and policies of the Central Detention Facility. Cf. Farmer v. Moritsugu, 163\n\nF.3d 610, 615 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (per curiam) (noting that the defendant was not the person\n\nresponsible for making the pertinent determination giving rise to the alleged constitutional harm).\n\nBoth in terms of their knowledge and agency, the Defendant Correctional Officers and the\n\ndefendants in Hardy simply are not similarly situated.\n\n\n                                                 17\n\f         This Court’s unpublished decision in Austin is even more inapposite. In that case, the\n\nplaintiff claimed that the defendant failed to provide him access to adequate medical treatment\n\ndespite being on actual notice of the underlying medical condition; there was no claim in the\n\nmold of the one asserted in this case. See Austin, 2007 WL 1404444, at *7-8.\n\n         In short, the Court finds that Hardy and Austin do not support a finding that the\n\nconstitutional violation alleged in this case was “clearly established” at the time of Gaither’s\n\ndeath.\n\n         B.     Plaintiff’s Remaining Authorities Do Not Show that the Alleged Constitutional\n\n                Violation Was “Clearly Established”\n\n         The Court therefore turns to the three remaining authorities relied upon by Plaintiff,\n\nwhich at least were decided before the conduct at issue and are binding on this Court.\n\n         First, the Court of Appeals’ decision in Morgan v. District of Columbia, 824 F.2d 1049\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1987), which Plaintiff cites only for the general and unremarkable proposition that a\n\nprisoner has a constitutional right to be protected from the unreasonable threat of violence from\n\nhis fellow inmates, see Pl.’s Opp’n at 21, is of no help to Plaintiff. The Court of Appeals’\n\ndecision in that case was confined to the propriety of the district court’s resolution of post-trial\n\nmotions relating to the Section 1983 claims asserted against the District of Columbia itself. The\n\nCourt of Appeals did not address the plaintiff’s claims against the individual officers, which were\n\ndismissed before the end of the trial. See id. at 1055. For this reason, the Court of Appeals\n\nanalyzed the “deliberate indifference” standard with reference to a broad range of actors,\n\nimputing all their knowledge and systemic failings to the District of Columbia. See id. at 1058-\n\n61. In other words, as was the case with Hardy, the Defendant Correctional Officers and the\n\n\n                                                  18\n\fdefendants in Morgan are not similarly situated. Morgan involved a different kind of case\n\naltogether, one that turned in large part on the contours of municipal liability under Section 1983.\n\nApart from articulating the general legal framework for “deliberate indifference” claims, a matter\n\naddressed below, the decision would have provided no meaningful guidance to line officers like\n\nthe Defendant Correctional Officers, let alone such guidance that would show that the specific\n\nconstitutional violation alleged in this case was “clearly established” at the time of Gaither’s\n\ndeath.\n\n         Second, Plaintiff’s reliance on the Supreme Court’s decision in Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S.\n\n736 (2002), is similarly misplaced, albeit for different reasons. While that case did involve\n\nclaims against lower-level prison guards, the nature of the conduct at issue in that case was so\n\nradically different from the alleged constitutional violation in this case that it need not detain this\n\nCourt long. In Hope, even though the plaintiff had already been “subdued, handcuffed, placed in\n\nleg irons, and transported back to the prison,” thereby abating any safety concerns, prison guards\n\nnonetheless proceeded to knowingly and unnecessarily handcuff the plaintiff to a “hitching post”\n\nfor seven hours, exposing him “to the heat of the sun, to prolonged thirst and taunting, and to a\n\ndeprivation of bathroom breaks that created a risk of particular discomfort and humiliation.” Id.\n\nat 738. As the Supreme Court found, this “wanton treatment was not done of necessity, but as\n\npunishment.” Id. at 745. Quite simply, Plaintiff’s suggestion that the Defendant Correctional\n\nOfficers’ alleged conduct in this case involves anything even remotely approximating the\n\n“obvious cruelty” at issue in Hope is not well taken. See Pl.’s Opp’n at 23.\n\n         Finally, in Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 831 (1994), the Court did not actually reach the\n\nmerits of the case, instead remanding for further development of the factual record. Rather, the\n\n\n                                                  19\n\ffocus of the Supreme Court’s opinion was articulating the principles applying to “deliberate\n\nindifference” claims generally, a matter the Court addresses below. Regardless, the allegations in\n\nFarmer were likewise radically different than those now before the Court. The claim in that case\n\nfocused on allegations that the defendants transferred the plaintiff, a “diagnosed” transsexual\n\nwho had undergone estrogen therapy and physical surgery, to a unit especially prone to sexual\n\nassaults. See id. at 829-31.\n\n       C.      Plaintiff’s Reliance Upon the General Principles Governing “Deliberate\n\n               Indifference” Claims Is Similarly Misplaced\n\n       Plaintiff does not actually appear to rely on the five authorities cited in her opposition for\n\ntheir actual factual matter. Indeed, with the exception of Hardy, the cases do not receive any\n\nmeaningful factual exegesis anywhere in Plaintiff’s analysis of the “clearly established” inquiry.\n\nSee Pl.’s Opp’n at 20-23. Rather, Plaintiff relies on these authorities primarily insofar as they\n\nrelate the principles governing “deliberate indifference” claims generally. Such an approach, as\n\napplied to the facts of this case, is misguided.\n\n       At the outset, the Court pauses to acknowledge that when a district court is called upon to\n\ndetermine whether a constitutional violation was “clearly established” at a particular moment in\n\ntime, it need not find that the facts of the prior case law are identical or even substantially similar\n\nto the facts at hand—provided, that is, that the state of the law at the time of the incident gave the\n\ndefendant fair warning that his actions were unconstitutional. Bame, 637 F.3d at 384. In other\n\nwords, although there need not be a case “directly on point,” “existing precedent must have\n\nplaced the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.” Al-Kidd, 131 S. Ct. at 2083.\n\nSignificantly, the Supreme Court has repeatedly warned courts “not to define clearly established\n\n\n                                                   20\n\flaw at a high level of generality.” Id. at 2084. The “clearly established” inquiry “must be\n\nundertaken in light of the specific context of the case, not as a broad general proposition.”\n\nSaucier, 533 U.S. at 201. “[T]he right that the official is alleged to have violated must have been\n\n‘clearly established’ in a more particularized, and hence more relevant sense.” Anderson, 483\n\nU.S. at 649.\n\n       Plaintiff glosses over these principles entirely in her opposition. See Pl.’s Opp’n at 20-\n\n23. Instead, she characterizes the constitutional violation in this case as the failure to take\n\nreasonable measures to guarantee the safety of inmates from violence at the hands of other\n\nprisoners, or in a similarly broad manner. See id. at 21. So framed, the legal standards identified\n\nby Plaintiff are, like the legal landscape confronted by the Supreme Court in Brosseau v. Haugen,\n\n543 U.S. 199 (2004) (per curiam), cast at an unacceptably “high level of generality.” 543 U.S. at\n\n199. The general and unremarkable proposition that an officer’s deliberate indifference to inmate\n\nhealth and safety may run afoul of the Fifth and Eighth Amendments “is of little help in\n\ndetermining whether the violative nature of [the] particular conduct [at issue in this case] is\n\nclearly established.” Al-Kidd, 131 S. Ct. at 2084. Indeed, allowing Plaintiff to frame the “clearly\n\nestablished” right in such a broad and unilluminating manner would allow her “to convert the\n\nrule of qualified immunity . . . into a rule of virtually unqualified liability simply by alleging\n\nviolation of extremely abstract rights.” Anderson, 483 U.S. at 639.\n\n       The Court does not doubt that, in “an obvious case,” the general principles applicable to\n\n“deliberate indifference” claims “can ‘clearly establish’ the answer, even without a body of\n\nrelevant case law.” Brosseau, 543 U.S. at 199. The punitive use of the hitching post at issue in\n\nHope arguably provides such an “obvious” example. See Hope, 536 U.S. at 741 (“Arguably, the\n\n\n                                                  21\n\fviolation was so obvious that our own Eighth Amendment cases gave respondents fair warning\n\nthat their conduct violated the Constitution.”). This case, however, does not present such an\n\nobvious case. Distilled to its essence, the record shows that, on the day of the incident, White\n\nleft NE-3 in order to escort diabetic inmates to the infirmary to receive insulin shots at the\n\ndirection of the officer-in-charge without securing a relief officer, knowing that the inmates had\n\nbeen or were likely to be imminently released from their cells, knowing that it would be more\n\ndifficult for the remaining officers to supervise the inmates once released from their cells, and\n\nbelieving that you “really need four” officers to supervise NE-3; Toppin, as the officer-in-charge,\n\nfailed to obtain relief for Brooks before she left the cellblock, unaware that there was a separate\n\npost for relief officers, while believing it was impossible to supervise all the inmates on the\n\ncellblock with two officers; and White remained on the floor and was occupied with a task that\n\nhe was required to perform, albeit allegedly not as quickly as would have been desirable. It is\n\nundisputed that the Defendant Correctional Officers never had a role in making formal policy at\n\nthe Central Detention Facility and there is nothing in the record to suggest that the Defendant\n\nCorrectional Officers had any authority or power over broader staffing and safety conditions.\n\n       The Court need not decide whether this factual record does or does not in fact amount to\n\na constitutional violation. Rather, the important point is that Plaintiff has not and cannot point to\n\na single case predating the challenged conduct that would indicate that the precedent existing at\n\nthe time of Gaither’s death “placed the . . . constitutional question beyond debate.” Al-Kidd, 131\n\nS. Ct. at 2083. In the final analysis, after reviewing the legal landscape “in light of the specific\n\ncontext of this case” and “not as a broad general proposition,” Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201, the\n\nCourt cannot conclude that the Defendant Correctional Officers were on notice that their conduct\n\n\n                                                  22\n\fwould be “clearly unlawful,” id. at 202.7 Accordingly, summary judgment based on qualified\n\nimmunity is appropriate.\n\n        D.      The Court’s Conclusion is Supported by the Divergence of Conclusions as to How\n\n                the“Deliberate Indifference” Standard Applies in this Context\n\n        As discussed above, the general rule is that a district court may not consider cases post-\n\ndating the conduct at issue or non-precedential cases that are not reflective of a robust consensus\n\nin determining whether the alleged constitutional violation was “clearly established” at the time\n\nof the challenged conduct. However, cases post-dating the challenged conduct may be\n\nconsidered if they reflect the “uncertain state of the law” at the relevant point in time. Bame, 637\n\nF.3d at 384. In addition, the district court may consider whether “lower courts have reached\n\ndivergent conclusions” as to how a broad constitutional standard applies in a particular fact\n\nsituation.

Ct. 2633, 2643 (2009).\n\n        In this case, a review of the case law falling with this category reveals that there is, at the\n\nvery least, a divergence of conclusions as to how the “deliberate indifference” standard applies to\n\n\n        7\n          This remains true even if the Court assumes, as Plaintiff presses, that the Defendant\nCorrectional Officers ran afoul of the Central Detention Facility’s policies governing staffing and\nlike matters. The Court does not doubt that regulations and policies may, in appropriate\ncircumstances, provide a reasonable officer with warning that his conduct might be\nunconstitutional. Indeed, in Hope, the Supreme Court examined a state correctional regulation in\ndetermining whether the defendants had fair warning of the unconstitutionality of their conduct.\nSee Hope, 536 U.S. at 741. However, the relationship between the regulations and the\nconstitutional violation in that case was far less attenuated than it is in this case: if the defendants\nin Hope followed the regulation at issue, that would have transformed the very “wanton”\nconstitutional practice from a punitive to correctional measure. See id. at 744. Furthermore, the\nSupreme Court emphasized that the defendants “frequently” disregarded the regulation,\nevidencing a “course of conduct” tending to prove that “they were fully aware of the wrongful\ncharacter of their conduct.” Id. Meanwhile, the record in this case does not establish a\ncomparable course of conduct indicative of the state of mind required to support a “deliberate\nindifference” claim.\n\n                                                  23\n\fline officers charged with failings similar to those challenged in this action. See Burnley v.\n\nEvans, 249 F. App’x 492, 493-94 (8th Cir. 2007) (per curiam) (concluding that even if guard\n\nreleased inmates in violation of a policy requiring continuous supervision of inmates, the record\n\nat best showed “mere negligence”); Tucker v. Evans, 276 F.3d 999, 1001-02 (8th Cir. 2002)\n\n(concluding that even if there was a substantial risk of harm to inmates, allegations that an officer\n\nin the control booth failed to properly supervise the unit and perform inspection duties “fail[ed]\n\nto rise to the level of a constitutional wrong” and at best demonstrated negligence); Jones v. Allen\n\nParish Correctional Ctr., No. 06-0056, 2008 WL 726077, at *3 (W.D. La. Mar. 20, 2008)\n\n(concluding that allegations that officers in the control room allowed a fellow inmate to gain\n\naccess and fatally stab another inmate were insufficient, even where officers acknowledged that it\n\nwould be “better” to have additional staff on the floor); Muhammad v. Sielaff, No. 91 Civ. 7275\n\n(LAP), 1995 WL 459244, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 3, 1995) (concluding that plaintiff’s allegations\n\nthat correctional officers did not pay “close enough attention to their responsibilities to monitor\n\ninmates” or were not at their “proper post” did not rise “to the level of culpability required for\n\ndeliberate indifference,” but rather were consistent with negligence); but see Krein v. Norris, 309\n\nF.3d 487, 491-92 (8th Cir. 2002). This divergence of opinions further evidences that a\n\nreasonable officer in the Defendant Correctional Officers’ position could have believed that his\n\nconduct was within the bounds of an appropriate response.\n\n                                        V. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the reasons set forth above, the Court finds that the constitutional violation alleged in\n\nthis case was not “clearly established” at the time of Gaither’s death, rendering summary\n\njudgment based on qualified immunity appropriate. Accordingly, the Court shall GRANT the\n\n\n                                                 24\n\fDefendant Correctional Officers’ [232/233] Motion for Summary Judgment and DISMISS\n\nPlaintiff’s Section 1983 claims against the Defendant Correctional Officers in their personal\n\ncapacities.

Gaither\n\n(“Gaither”), brings this action against the District of Columbia and a series of Individual\n\nDefendants seeking damages in connection with Gaither’s fatal stabbing while he was\n\nincarcerated pending sentencing at the District of Columbia’s Central Detention Facility. The\n\nIndividual Defendants in this case fall into two groups: (1) Odie Washington, Marvin L. Brown,\n\nand Dennis Harrison, three high-ranking officials in the District of Columbia’s Department of\n\nCorrections or the Central Detention Facility; and (2) Zerline Brooks (“Brooks”), Gounod\n\nToppin (“Toppin”), and Joseph White (“White”), the three line officers that were assigned to\n\nGaither’s cellblock on the day of his death (collectively, the “Defendant Correctional Officers”).\n\n       In this case, Plaintiff claims, among other things, that the Defendant Correctional Officers\n\nviolated 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (“Section 1983”) by acting with “deliberate indifference” to a serious\n\nrisk of inmate-on-inmate violence that threatened Gaither’s safety and proximately caused his\n\ndeath, in contravention of his rights under the Fifth and Eighth Amendments to the United States\n\fConstitution. Currently before the Court is the Defendant Correctional Officers’ [232/233]\n\nMotion for Summary Judgment as to Plaintiff’s Constitutional Claims Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1983 (“Motion for Summary Judgment”). Relying upon the doctrine of qualified immunity, the\n\nDefendant Correctional Officers now seek judgment in their favor on Plaintiff’s Section 1983\n\nclaims against them in their personal capacities. Upon careful consideration of the parties’\n\nsubmissions, the relevant authorities, and the record as a whole, the Court shall GRANT the\n\nDefendant Correctional Officers’ [232/233] Motion for Summary Judgment.\n\n                                      I. BACKGROUND\n\n       The Court assumes familiarity with its prior opinions in this action, which set forth in\n\ndetail the extensive factual and procedural background of this case.\n\n       A.      Factual Background\n\n       On December 14, 2002, at approximately 5:40 p.m., Gaither was fatally stabbed by fellow\n\ninmates while incarcerated in the District’s Central Detention Facility. See Estate of Gaither ex\n\nrel. Gaither v. District of Columbia (“Gaither1”), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2432618\"><a href=\"/opinion/2432618/estate-of-gaither-ex-rel-gaither-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">655</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 74 (D.D.C. 2009). At the\n\ntime of his death, Gaither was awaiting sentencing in the Superior Court of the District of\n\nColumbia, having already pleaded guilty to one felony count of distribution of cocaine. See id. at\n\n75. The District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department conducted an investigation into\n\nthe incident, ultimately concluding that two of Gaither’s fellow inmates had forced Gaither into\n\nan open cell and proceeded to stab him, resulting in his death. See id. at 75-76. Subsequently, a\n\ngrand jury found that Gaither had been killed because of his involvement in a separate grand jury\n\ninvestigation into the murder of an individual by the name of Kenneth Muldrow. See id. at 76.\n\n       At the time of his stabbing, Gaither was located in the Northeast Three Cellblock (“NE-\n\n\n                                                2\n\f3”) of the Central Detention Facility. The Defendant Correctional Officers—Brooks, Toppin,\n\nand White—were the line officers that were assigned to NE-3 that day. Pl.’s Resp. to Def.\n\nCorrectional Officers’ Stmt. of Material Fact to Which There Is No Genuine Dispute (“Pl.’s\n\nResp. Stmt.”), ECF No. [238], ¶¶ 1-3; Resp. to Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. Regarding Material Facts and\n\nSuppl. to Def. Correctional Officers’ Stmt. of Material Facts Not in Dispute (“Defs.’ Reply\n\nStmt.”), ECF No. [240-1], ¶¶ 1-3. Toppin was the “bubble officer” and was designated as the\n\n“Officer-in-Charge.” Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶¶ 19, 38; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶¶ 19, 38. Brooks and\n\nWhite were serving as “floor officers.” Dep. of Zerline W. Brooks (“Brooks Dep.”), ECF Nos.\n\n[233-2], [238-1], at 17, 119. None of the Defendant Correctional Officers witnessed Gaither’s\n\nstabbing. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 48; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶ 48.\n\n       The Defendant Correctional Officers were required to maintain supervision over the\n\ncellblock at all times. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 49; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶ 49. It is undisputed that the\n\nDefendant Correctional Officers did not have a role in establishing formal policies at the Central\n\nDetention Facility. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶¶ 4-6; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶¶ 4-6. Nonetheless, at the time\n\nof Gaither’s stabbing, the Central Detention Facility’s “critical minimum staffing” policy\n\nrequired the presence of three correctional officers in NE-3 at all times.1 Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 33;\n\nDefs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶ 33. It was impossible to maintain visual supervision over the entire\n\n\n\n       1\n          Although the Defendant Correctional Officers fail to dispute this proffered factual\nstatement, they assert at other points in their briefing that the applicable staffing policy only\nrequired the presence of two correctional officers in NE-3. As the Court has previously had the\nopportunity to observe, the evidence on this point is contradictory and the issue is not amenable\nto resolution at this stage of the proceedings. Gaither1, 655 F. Supp. 2d at 89-91. For purposes\nof resolving the pending motion, the Court shall draw the inference most favorable to Plaintiff as\nthe non-movant—namely, that the critical minimum staffing policy at the time of the incident\nrequired the presence of three correctional officers in NE-3.\n\n                                                 3\n\fcellblock with less than three correctional officers. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 35; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶\n\n35. The “bubble officer” could not see into the cells, parts of the gym, and several areas of the\n\ncellblock tiers. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 35; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶ 35. Meanwhile, a single “floor\n\nofficer” could not see cells on the opposite side of the cellblock or on the other side of the tier.\n\nPl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 35; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶ 35. The difficulties in supervising inmates on the\n\ncellblock were compounded when all 160 inmates housed in NE-3 were released from their cells\n\nat once. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 37; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶ 37.\n\n       In December 2002, two similar incidents of violence at the Central Detention Facility\n\npreceded Gaither’s stabbing, albeit in different cellblocks. While the Defendant Correctional\n\nOfficers maintain that they were unaware of these prior incidents, there is evidence in the record\n\nthat would permit a reasonable trier of fact to infer that such information was passed on to the\n\nDefendant Correctional Officers at roll calls prior to Gaither’s stabbing. Dep. of Gary A. Binson\n\n(“Binson Dep.”), ECF Nos. [233-3], [238-2], at 133, 138-39; Dep. of Marvin L. Brown (“Brown\n\nDep.”), ECF No. [238-3], at 228-30; Am. Resps. to Reqs. for Admission, ECF No. [238-15], at\n\n5-6.\n\n               1.      Defendant Brooks\n\n       At the time Gaither was attacked, there were only two guards physically present at NE-\n\n3—Toppin and White. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 11; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶ 11. Brooks left NE-3 at 5:30\n\np.m., shortly before Gaither was stabbed, in order to escort four diabetic inmates to the facility’s\n\ninfirmary to receive insulin shots. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 7; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶ 7. Upon her return\n\nto NE-3 at approximately 5:40 p.m., Brooks noticed Gaither running from the top right tier of the\n\ncellblock covered in blood. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 21; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶ 21.\n\n\n                                                   4\n\f       When Brooks left NE-3, the inmates on the cellblock were in the process of being fed.\n\nStmt. of Material Fact to Which There Is No Genuine Issue (“Defs.’ Stmt.”), ECF No. [233], ¶ 9;\n\nPl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 9. It is unclear whether the inmates were locked in their cells. Brooks Dep. at\n\n22; Dep. of Gounod Toppin (“Toppin Dep.”), ECF Nos. [233-1], [238-4], at 197, 200-01; Pl.’s\n\nEx. 5 at DC014137. For purposes of the pending motion, the lack of clarity is immaterial. The\n\nCommand Center had “cleared the count” for NE-3 at 5:15 p.m., shortly before Brooks left the\n\ncellblock. Brooks Dep. at 38-39, 80-81; Pl.’s Ex. 5 at DC014137. Brooks concedes that, once\n\nthe count is cleared by the Command Center, the guards on the cellblock release the inmates\n\nfrom their cells. Brooks Dep. at 38-39. Therefore, a reasonable trier of fact could infer that\n\nBrooks could have anticipated that it was likely that the inmates on NE-3 would be released\n\nsometime around the time she left the cellblock. The parties agree that Brooks did not make the\n\ndecision to release the inmates, whenever it occurred. Defs.’ Stmt. ¶ 25; Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 25.\n\n       It is undisputed that Brooks was ordered by Toppin to leave NE-3 to escort inmates to the\n\ninfirmary. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 39; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶ 39. Consistent with this account, Brooks\n\ntestified at her deposition that she had no discretion in the matter. Brooks Dep. at 65, 138.\n\nNonetheless, Plaintiff maintains, with support in the record, that escorting inmates to the\n\ninfirmary for insulin shots would not constitute the kind of emergency necessary to drop below\n\nthe critical staffing requirement for the cellblock. Binson Dep. at 31-36; Brown Dep. at 93-94.\n\nInstead, the appropriate response would have been to wait for a relief officer to be dispatched\n\nfrom the Command Center or to contact the Command Center to obtain such relief. Binson Dep.\n\nat 31-36; Brown Dep. at 93-94.\n\n       At her deposition taken several years after the incident, Brooks testified that it “bothers”\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fher when there are less than three correctional officers in the cellblock. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 36;\n\nDefs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶ 36. Indeed, Brooks testified that you “really need four” correctional\n\nofficers. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 36; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶ 36; Brooks Dep. at 46-47, 88-90. Although\n\nPlaintiff challenges Brooks’ failure to obtain relief prior to escorting inmates to the infirmary, it\n\nis undisputed that she played no role in the assignment of correctional officers to NE-3. Defs.’\n\nStmt. ¶ 29; Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 29.\n\n                2.      Defendant Toppin\n\n        On the day of the incident, Toppin was the “bubble officer” and was designated as the\n\n“Officer-in-Charge.” Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶¶ 19, 38; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶¶ 19, 38. In that role,\n\nToppin was responsible for making sure that relief was available prior to any officer leaving the\n\ncellblock. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 38; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶ 38.\n\n        Toppin ordered Brooks to leave NE-3 to escort inmates to the infirmary to receive insulin\n\nshots. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 39; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶ 39. Toppin did so without attempting to\n\nsecure relief for Brooks’ post. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 39; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶ 39. According to\n\nPlaintiff, this was a violation of the facility’s policy because it failed to maintain the critical\n\nstaffing complement on the cellblock and Toppin should have instead called his supervisor to\n\nsecure a relief officer to escort the inmates to the infirmary. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 39; Defs.’ Reply\n\nStmt. ¶ 39. At his deposition, Toppin explained that the Post Orders2 for NE-3 at the time only\n\nrequired two guards to be in the cellblock at all times. Toppin Dep. at 222-23. However, the\n\nPost Orders themselves do not address specific staffing numbers, but instead refer to “post\n\n\n\n        2\n           The Post Orders are designed to “[e]stablish policies and procedures for the safe,\nefficient and orderly operation of Housing Unit Northeast Three.” Pl.’s Ex. 7 at DC013063.\n\n                                                    6\n\fanalysis charts” that have never been produced in this case. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 12; Defs.’ Reply\n\nStmt. ¶ 12. In any event, at his deposition taken several years after the incident, Toppin testified\n\nthat he personally believed it was “impossible” to provide a “reasonable level of security” over\n\n160 inmates in NE-3 with only two correctional officers. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 36; Defs.’ Reply\n\nStmt. ¶ 36.\n\n       Toppin was “unaware that there was a separate post for relief officers.” Pl.’s Resp. Stmt.\n\n¶ 39 (citing Toppin Dep. at 63). Rather, Toppin appears to have been operating under the\n\nunderstanding that one of the three officers assigned to NE-3 was, in effect, the “relief officer”\n\nfor the shift. Toppin Dep. at 62-63. However, staffing rosters from the day of the incident show\n\nthat six officers were assigned to “Relief/Escort” above and beyond the staffing assignments for\n\neach cellblock. Pl.’s Ex. 12 at DC011269.\n\n               3.      Officer White\n\n       At the time of Gaither’s stabbing, White was manually closing the cell doors on the lower\n\nright tier of NE-3. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶¶ 40-41; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶¶ 40-41. Policy required\n\nclosing cell doors immediately after they were opened in order to keep inmates from gaining\n\naccess to other inmates’ cells. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 43; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶ 43. Closing the cell\n\ndoors manually was a lengthy process that could take a single guard as long as an hour to\n\ncomplete. Pl.’s Resp. Stmt. ¶ 42; Defs.’ Reply Stmt. ¶ 42.\n\n       B.      Procedural Background\n\n       Plaintiff brings this action as the personal representative of Gaither estate. The\n\nprocedural history of the case is extensive and has been recited at length elsewhere. Over the\n\nyears, the Court has resolved a litany of discovery-related motions, dispositive motions, and\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fmotions for reconsideration. More recently in the litigation, the Court granted Plaintiff leave to\n\nfile a Third Amended Complaint in order to articulate an alternative theory of liability. See\n\nEstate of Gaither ex rel. Gaither v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.D.C. 2011). In her\n\nThird Amended Complaint, Plaintiff claims, among other things, that the Defendant Correctional\n\nOfficers violated Section 1983 by acting with “deliberate indifference” to a serious risk of\n\ninmate-on-inmate violence that threatened Gaither’s safety and proximately caused his death, in\n\ncontravention of his rights under the Fifth and Eighth Amendments to the United States\n\nConstitution. See Third Am. Compl., ECF No. [228], ¶¶ 59-61, 69-78.\n\n       As a result of this development, which modestly expanded the legal scope of Plaintiff’s\n\nconstitutional claims, the Court granted the Defendant Correctional Officers leave to revisit their\n\nqualified immunity defense in a supplemental motion for summary judgment. See Mem. Op. and\n\nOrder, ECF No. [225]. Previously, the Court had found the Defendant Correctional Officers’\n\ntreatment of the qualified immunity issue wanting, and had denied them summary judgment on\n\nthat basis. See Gaither1, 655 F. Supp. 2d at 94-99.\n\n       In accordance with the schedule set by the Court, the Defendant Correctional Officers\n\nfiled the pending Motion for Summary Judgment. See Mem. of P. & A. in Supp. of Defs. Joseph\n\nWhite, Zerline Brooks and Gonoud [sic] Toppin’s Mot. Judgment [sic] Plaintiff’s [sic] Claims\n\n[sic] Constitutional Claims Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (“Defs.’ Mem.”), ECF No. [233].\n\nPlaintiff filed an opposition. See Pl.’s Mem. of Law in Opp’n to Def. Correctional Officers’ Am.\n\nMot. for Summ. J. (“Pl.’s Opp’n”), ECF No. [237]. The Defendant Correctional Officers filed a\n\nreply. See Reply Br. to Pl.’s Mem. of P. & A. in Opp’n to Defs. Joseph White, Zerline Brooks\n\nand Gonoud [sic] Toppin’s Am. Mot. for Summ. J. as to Pl.’s Constitutional Claims Pursuant to\n\n\n                                                 8\n\f42 U.S.C. § 1983 (“Defs.’ Reply”), ECF No. [240]. The motion is therefore fully briefed and\n\nripe for a decision. In an exercise of its discretion, the Court finds that holding oral argument on\n\nthe motion would not assist the Court in rendering its decision. See LCV R 7(f).\n\n                                     II. LEGAL STANDARD\n\n        Summary judgment is appropriate where “the movant shows that there is no genuine\n\ndispute as to any material fact and [that it] . . . is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” FED .\n\nR. CIV . P. 56(a). The mere existence of some factual dispute is insufficient on its own to bar\n\nsummary judgment; the dispute must pertain to a “material” fact. Id. Accordingly, “[o]nly\n\ndisputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will\n\nproperly preclude the entry of summary judgment.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><a href=\"/opinion/111719/anderson-v-liberty-lobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 255 (1986). Nor may summary judgment be avoided based on just any disagreement as to\n\nthe relevant facts; the dispute must be “genuine,” meaning that there must be sufficient\n\nadmissible evidence for a reasonable trier of fact to find for the non-movant. Id.\n\n        In order to establish that a fact is or cannot be genuinely disputed, a party must (a) cite to\n\nspecific parts of the record—including deposition testimony, documentary evidence, affidavits or\n\ndeclarations, or other competent evidence—in support of its position, or (b) demonstrate that the\n\nmaterials relied upon by the opposing party do not actually establish the absence or presence of a\n\ngenuine dispute.

PRELIMINARY MATTERS\n\n       As a preliminary matter, Plaintiff argues that the Defendant Correctional Officers’\n\n[232/233] Motion for Summary Judgment should be denied outright and in its entirety because,\n\nin contravention of this Court’s prior instructions, their opening memorandum cites directly to\n\nevidence in the record rather than to their statement of material facts. See Pl.’s Opp’n at 7-8.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not the first time that the Court has had the opportunity to address the\n\nDefendant Correctional Officers’ chosen approach. Previously, in connection with the very same\n\nsubject matter underlying the pending Motion for Summary Judgment, the Court chastised the\n\n\n                                                 10\n\fDefendant Correctional Officers for “fail[ing] to couple their factual arguments with specific\n\ncitations to their accompanying statement of material facts and instead improperly cit[ing]\n\ndirectly to evidence in the record.” Mem. Op. and Order, ECF No. [225], at 6. As the Court\n\nobserved then, such an approach “obscure[s] whether the facts relied upon [are] disputed.” Id.\n\n       Despite this admonition, the Defendant Correctional Officers’ opening memorandum in\n\nconnection with the pending Motion for Summary Judgment adopts the identical approach\n\npreviously found wanting by the Court. Conspicuously absent from the Defendant Correctional\n\nOfficers’ opening memorandum is a single reference to their statement of materials facts.\n\nInstead, the Defendant Correctional Officers once again cite exclusively to evidence in the\n\nrecord.3 Once again, this obscures whether the facts relied upon by the Defendant Correctional\n\nOfficers are disputed and “impermissibly shifts counsel’s burden to locate and identify the\n\nrelevant facts, and leaves this Court to guess which of the many factual statements set forth in\n\n[the Defendant Correctional Officers’ opening memorandum] are disputed and, if disputed,\n\nwhether the dispute is genuine.” Glass v.

As the Defendant\n\nCorrectional Officers were previously warned, such an approach is unacceptable.\n\n       Counsel for the Defendant Correctional Officers, C. Vaughn Adams, Esq., admits the\n\nnon-compliance, explaining that he cited directly to evidence in the record “[t]hrough habit\n\ndeveloped during years of practice” and submitting that the Defendant Correctional Officers\n\n“should not be penalized” for counsel’s error.

Under the unique\n\ncircumstances in this case, the Court declines to exercise its discretion to visit the “sins of\n\ncounsel” upon the innocent Defendant Correctional Officers by denying the pending Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment outright and in its entirety, a step that would deprive the Defendant\n\nCorrectional Officers of their qualified immunity defense, which implicates an immunity from\n\nsuit that is effectively lost if this case proceeds to trial.

Nonetheless, the Court declines to sift through the Defendant Correctional Officers’\n\nsubmissions in order to crystallize the record for the parties. In an exercise of the Court’s\n\ndiscretion, factual assertions absent from the parties’ statements of material facts or not readily\n\ndiscernible from the face of the parties’ pleadings shall be disregarded.

DISCUSSION\n\n       Through her Section 1983 claims, Plaintiff contends that the Defendant Correctional\n\nOfficers acted with “deliberate indifference” to a serious risk of inmate-on-inmate violence that\n\nthreatened Gaither’s safety and proximately caused his death, in violation of his rights under the\n\nFifth and Eighth Amendments to the United States Constitution.4 It is well-established that\n\n“prison officials have a duty to protect prisoners from violence at the hand of other prisoners.”\n\n\n       4\n           It remains to be definitively resolved which Amendment should apply to the facts of\nthis case, something that turns on Gaither’s detention status at the time of his death. See\nGaither1, 655 F. Supp. 2d at 84-88. However, because the parties are in agreement that the legal\nprinciples governing the pending motion are identical under both Amendments, the Court need\nnot, and shall not, resolve the matter here.\n\n                                                  12\n\fFarmer v.

Plaintiff can prevail on her claim if she establishes both (1) that the challenged\n\nconditions of incarceration posed a “substantial risk of serious harm,” and (2) that the Defendant\n\nCorrectional Officers’ state of mind was one of “deliberate indifference” to inmate health or\n\nsafety. Id. at 834.\n\n       By its terms, this standard requires “more than mere negligence.” Id. at 835.

In other words, not only must the defendant be “aware of facts\n\nfrom which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of harm exists,” he must actually\n\nand consciously “draw the inference.” Id. at 837. Thus, a plaintiff may not recover based on “an\n\nofficial’s failure to alleviate a significant risk that he should have perceived but did not.” Id. at\n\n838. “Whether a prison official had the requisite knowledge of a substantial risk is a question of\n\nfact subject to demonstration in the usual ways, including inference from circumstantial\n\nevidence, and a factfinder may conclude that a prison official knew of a substantial risk from the\n\nvery fact that the risk was obvious.” Id. at 842 (internal citations and quotations omitted); see\n\nalso Hope v.

Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant Correctional Officers\n\n“left the unit woefully understaffed, failed to maintain supervision over the inmates, released all\n\ninmates from their cells to roam freely about, allowed the cell doors to remain open for an\n\nextended periods [sic] of time, violated numerous jail policies, and displayed a complete\n\ndisregard to the unsafe conditions of the jail.” Pl.’s Opp’n at 21; see generally Third Am.\n\nCompl., ECF No. [228], ¶¶ 59-61, 69-78.\n\n        In their [232/233] Motion for Summary Judgment, the Defendant Correctional Officers\n\nargue that they enjoy qualified immunity from Plaintiff’s Section 1983 claims against them in\n\ntheir personal capacities. “Qualified immunity shields federal and state officials from suit unless\n\na plaintiff alleges facts showing (1) that the official violated a statutory or constitutional right,\n\nand (2) that the right was ‘clearly established’ at the time of the challenged conduct.” Ashcroft v.\n\nAl-Kidd, __ U.S. __, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"217703\"><a href=\"/opinion/217703/ashcroft-v-al-kidd/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

May 11, 2007)—originate from this Court.\n\n       A.      Plaintiff’s Reliance on Decisions from this Court Post-Dating the Conduct at\n\n               Issue is Misplaced\n\n       It appears from this collection of cases that Plaintiff misapprehends how the “clearly\n\nestablished” inquiry actually works in practice. As an initial matter,“[b]ecause the focus is on\n\nwhether the officer had fair notice that her conduct was unlawful, reasonableness is judged\n\nagainst the backdrop of the law at the time of the conduct.” Brosseau, 543 U.S. at 198 (emphasis\n\nadded). For this reason, with one exception that is of no help to Plaintiff,6 decisions post-dating\n\nthe conduct at issue “are of no use in the clearly established inquiry.” Id. at 200 n.4. In this case,\n\nbecause the challenged conduct occurred on December 14, 2002, Plaintiff’s reliance on Hardy\n\nand Austin, which were decided in 2009 and 2007 respectively, is misplaced.\n\n       Even if this were not the case, there is an established hierarchy of legal authority that\n\nPlaintiff altogether ignores. In evaluating whether the constitutional violation was “clearly\n\nestablished,” this Court’s first resort is to cases from the United States Supreme Court and the\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and only thereafter to cases\n\nfrom other courts “exhibiting a consensus view—if there is one.” Bame, 637 F.3d at 384\n\n\n       6\n          Cases post-dating the challenged conduct may be considered if they reflect the\n“uncertain state of the law” at the relevant point in time. Bame v. Dillard, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">637</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">380</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 384\n(D.C.

Absent controlling authority from the Supreme\n\nCourt or the Court of Appeals, the consensus view must be “robust.” Al-Kidd, 131 S. Ct. at\n\n2084. However, neither Hardy nor Austin reflect a robust consensus view that is relevant to the\n\nactual facts at issue in this case.\n\n        True, in Hardy, this Court was faced with comparable allegations that prison guards\n\nfailed to supervise, monitor, and deter inmate-on-inmate assaults. See Hardy, 601 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n186, 189-90. However, in finding that the plaintiffs in that case alleged enough factual matter to\n\nstate a sufficiently plausible “deliberate indifference” claim to survive a motion to dismiss, the\n\nCourt emphasized that the defendants in that case were alleged to be “at the top of the chain of\n\ncommand,” possessing “complete knowledge of the long history” of violations at the facility in\n\nquestion. Id. at 190. Indeed, they were among the highest-ranking officials responsible for\n\nsupervising the facility, and were therefore uniquely positioned to make policy decisions\n\naffecting inmate health and safety. In sharp contrast, the Defendant Correctional Officers are\n\nmerely the line officers that were assigned to Gaither’s cellblock on the day in question. Even\n\nassuming, counter-factually, that Hardy had been decided prior to Gaither’s death, nothing in that\n\ndecision would have put the Defendant Correctional Officers on notice that their actions would\n\nbe adjudged as if they, again counter-factually, had the authority to make wide-ranging changes\n\nto the operations and policies of the Central Detention Facility. Cf. Farmer v. Moritsugu, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184722\"><a href=\"/opinion/184722/farmer-dee-v-moritsugu-kenneth/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">610</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 615 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (per curiam) (noting that the defendant was not the person\n\nresponsible for making the pertinent determination giving rise to the alleged constitutional harm).\n\nBoth in terms of their knowledge and agency, the Defendant Correctional Officers and the\n\ndefendants in Hardy simply are not similarly situated.\n\n\n                                                 17\n\f         This Court’s unpublished decision in Austin is even more inapposite. In that case, the\n\nplaintiff claimed that the defendant failed to provide him access to adequate medical treatment\n\ndespite being on actual notice of the underlying medical condition; there was no claim in the\n\nmold of the one asserted in this case. See Austin, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1404444</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7-8.\n\n         In short, the Court finds that Hardy and Austin do not support a finding that the\n\nconstitutional violation alleged in this case was “clearly established” at the time of Gaither’s\n\ndeath.\n\n         B.     Plaintiff’s Remaining Authorities Do Not Show that the Alleged Constitutional\n\n                Violation Was “Clearly Established”\n\n         The Court therefore turns to the three remaining authorities relied upon by Plaintiff,\n\nwhich at least were decided before the conduct at issue and are binding on this Court.\n\n         First, the Court of Appeals’ decision in Morgan v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"492013\"><a href=\"/opinion/492013/andrew-ellsworth-morgan-v-district-of-columbia-two-cases/\"><span class=\"volume\">824</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1049</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1987), which Plaintiff cites only for the general and unremarkable proposition that a\n\nprisoner has a constitutional right to be protected from the unreasonable threat of violence from\n\nhis fellow inmates, see Pl.’s Opp’n at 21, is of no help to Plaintiff. The Court of Appeals’\n\ndecision in that case was confined to the propriety of the district court’s resolution of post-trial\n\nmotions relating to the Section 1983 claims asserted against the District of Columbia itself. The\n\nCourt of Appeals did not address the plaintiff’s claims against the individual officers, which were\n\ndismissed before the end of the trial. See id. at 1055. For this reason, the Court of Appeals\n\nanalyzed the “deliberate indifference” standard with reference to a broad range of actors,\n\nimputing all their knowledge and systemic failings to the District of Columbia. See id. at 1058-\n\n61. In other words, as was the case with Hardy, the Defendant Correctional Officers and the\n\n\n                                                  18\n\fdefendants in Morgan are not similarly situated. Morgan involved a different kind of case\n\naltogether, one that turned in large part on the contours of municipal liability under Section 1983.\n\nApart from articulating the general legal framework for “deliberate indifference” claims, a matter\n\naddressed below, the decision would have provided no meaningful guidance to line officers like\n\nthe Defendant Correctional Officers, let alone such guidance that would show that the specific\n\nconstitutional violation alleged in this case was “clearly established” at the time of Gaither’s\n\ndeath.\n\n         Second, Plaintiff’s reliance on the Supreme Court’s decision in Hope v. Pelzer, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">736</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002), is similarly misplaced, albeit for different reasons. While that case did involve\n\nclaims against lower-level prison guards, the nature of the conduct at issue in that case was so\n\nradically different from the alleged constitutional violation in this case that it need not detain this\n\nCourt long. In Hope, even though the plaintiff had already been “subdued, handcuffed, placed in\n\nleg irons, and transported back to the prison,” thereby abating any safety concerns, prison guards\n\nnonetheless proceeded to knowingly and unnecessarily handcuff the plaintiff to a “hitching post”\n\nfor seven hours, exposing him “to the heat of the sun, to prolonged thirst and taunting, and to a\n\ndeprivation of bathroom breaks that created a risk of particular discomfort and humiliation.” Id.\n\nat 738. As the Supreme Court found, this “wanton treatment was not done of necessity, but as\n\npunishment.” Id. at 745. Quite simply, Plaintiff’s suggestion that the Defendant Correctional\n\nOfficers’ alleged conduct in this case involves anything even remotely approximating the\n\n“obvious cruelty” at issue in Hope is not well taken. See Pl.’s Opp’n at 23.\n\n         Finally, in Farmer v. Brennan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">831</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1994), the Court did not actually reach the\n\nmerits of the case, instead remanding for further development of the factual record. Rather, the\n\n\n                                                  19\n\ffocus of the Supreme Court’s opinion was articulating the principles applying to “deliberate\n\nindifference” claims generally, a matter the Court addresses below. Regardless, the allegations in\n\nFarmer were likewise radically different than those now before the Court. The claim in that case\n\nfocused on allegations that the defendants transferred the plaintiff, a “diagnosed” transsexual\n\nwho had undergone estrogen therapy and physical surgery, to a unit especially prone to sexual\n\nassaults. See id. at 829-31.\n\n       C.      Plaintiff’s Reliance Upon the General Principles Governing “Deliberate\n\n               Indifference” Claims Is Similarly Misplaced\n\n       Plaintiff does not actually appear to rely on the five authorities cited in her opposition for\n\ntheir actual factual matter. Indeed, with the exception of Hardy, the cases do not receive any\n\nmeaningful factual exegesis anywhere in Plaintiff’s analysis of the “clearly established” inquiry.\n\nSee Pl.’s Opp’n at 20-23. Rather, Plaintiff relies on these authorities primarily insofar as they\n\nrelate the principles governing “deliberate indifference” claims generally. Such an approach, as\n\napplied to the facts of this case, is misguided.\n\n       At the outset, the Court pauses to acknowledge that when a district court is called upon to\n\ndetermine whether a constitutional violation was “clearly established” at a particular moment in\n\ntime, it need not find that the facts of the prior case law are identical or even substantially similar\n\nto the facts at hand—provided, that is, that the state of the law at the time of the incident gave the\n\ndefendant fair warning that his actions were unconstitutional. Bame, 637 F.3d at 384. In other\n\nwords, although there need not be a case “directly on point,” “existing precedent must have\n\nplaced the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.” Al-Kidd, 131 S. Ct. at 2083.\n\nSignificantly, the Supreme Court has repeatedly warned courts “not to define clearly established\n\n\n                                                   20\n\flaw at a high level of generality.” Id. at 2084. The “clearly established” inquiry “must be\n\nundertaken in light of the specific context of the case, not as a broad general proposition.”\n\nSaucier, 533 U.S. at 201. “[T]he right that the official is alleged to have violated must have been\n\n‘clearly established’ in a more particularized, and hence more relevant sense.” Anderson, 483\n\nU.S. at 649.\n\n       Plaintiff glosses over these principles entirely in her opposition. See Pl.’s Opp’n at 20-\n\n23. Instead, she characterizes the constitutional violation in this case as the failure to take\n\nreasonable measures to guarantee the safety of inmates from violence at the hands of other\n\nprisoners, or in a similarly broad manner. See id. at 21. So framed, the legal standards identified\n\nby Plaintiff are, like the legal landscape confronted by the Supreme Court in Brosseau v. Haugen,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">199</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2004) (per curiam), cast at an unacceptably “high level of generality.” 543 U.S. at\n\n199. The general and unremarkable proposition that an officer’s deliberate indifference to inmate\n\nhealth and safety may run afoul of the Fifth and Eighth Amendments “is of little help in\n\ndetermining whether the violative nature of [the] particular conduct [at issue in this case] is\n\nclearly established.” Al-Kidd, 131 S. Ct. at 2084. Indeed, allowing Plaintiff to frame the “clearly\n\nestablished” right in such a broad and unilluminating manner would allow her “to convert the\n\nrule of qualified immunity . . . into a rule of virtually unqualified liability simply by alleging\n\nviolation of extremely abstract rights.” Anderson, 483 U.S. at 639.\n\n       The Court does not doubt that, in “an obvious case,” the general principles applicable to\n\n“deliberate indifference” claims “can ‘clearly establish’ the answer, even without a body of\n\nrelevant case law.” Brosseau, 543 U.S. at 199. The punitive use of the hitching post at issue in\n\nHope arguably provides such an “obvious” example. See Hope, 536 U.S. at 741 (“Arguably, the\n\n\n                                                  21\n\fviolation was so obvious that our own Eighth Amendment cases gave respondents fair warning\n\nthat their conduct violated the Constitution.”). This case, however, does not present such an\n\nobvious case. Distilled to its essence, the record shows that, on the day of the incident, White\n\nleft NE-3 in order to escort diabetic inmates to the infirmary to receive insulin shots at the\n\ndirection of the officer-in-charge without securing a relief officer, knowing that the inmates had\n\nbeen or were likely to be imminently released from their cells, knowing that it would be more\n\ndifficult for the remaining officers to supervise the inmates once released from their cells, and\n\nbelieving that you “really need four” officers to supervise NE-3; Toppin, as the officer-in-charge,\n\nfailed to obtain relief for Brooks before she left the cellblock, unaware that there was a separate\n\npost for relief officers, while believing it was impossible to supervise all the inmates on the\n\ncellblock with two officers; and White remained on the floor and was occupied with a task that\n\nhe was required to perform, albeit allegedly not as quickly as would have been desirable. It is\n\nundisputed that the Defendant Correctional Officers never had a role in making formal policy at\n\nthe Central Detention Facility and there is nothing in the record to suggest that the Defendant\n\nCorrectional Officers had any authority or power over broader staffing and safety conditions.\n\n       The Court need not decide whether this factual record does or does not in fact amount to\n\na constitutional violation. Rather, the important point is that Plaintiff has not and cannot point to\n\na single case predating the challenged conduct that would indicate that the precedent existing at\n\nthe time of Gaither’s death “placed the . . . constitutional question beyond debate.” Al-Kidd, 131\n\nS. Ct. at 2083. In the final analysis, after reviewing the legal landscape “in light of the specific\n\ncontext of this case” and “not as a broad general proposition,” Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201, the\n\nCourt cannot conclude that the Defendant Correctional Officers were on notice that their conduct\n\n\n                                                  22\n\fwould be “clearly unlawful,” id. at 202.7 Accordingly, summary judgment based on qualified\n\nimmunity is appropriate.\n\n        D.      The Court’s Conclusion is Supported by the Divergence of Conclusions as to How\n\n                the“Deliberate Indifference” Standard Applies in this Context\n\n        As discussed above, the general rule is that a district court may not consider cases post-\n\ndating the conduct at issue or non-precedential cases that are not reflective of a robust consensus\n\nin determining whether the alleged constitutional violation was “clearly established” at the time\n\nof the challenged conduct. However, cases post-dating the challenged conduct may be\n\nconsidered if they reflect the “uncertain state of the law” at the relevant point in time. Bame, 637\n\nF.3d at 384. In addition, the district court may consider whether “lower courts have reached\n\ndivergent conclusions” as to how a broad constitutional standard applies in a particular fact\n\nsituation. Safford Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 v. Redding, __ U.S. __, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145852\"><a href=\"/opinion/145852/safford-unified-school-dist-1-v-redding/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2633</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2643 (2009).\n\n        In this case, a review of the case law falling with this category reveals that there is, at the\n\nvery least, a divergence of conclusions as to how the “deliberate indifference” standard applies to\n\n\n        7\n          This remains true even if the Court assumes, as Plaintiff presses, that the Defendant\nCorrectional Officers ran afoul of the Central Detention Facility’s policies governing staffing and\nlike matters. The Court does not doubt that regulations and policies may, in appropriate\ncircumstances, provide a reasonable officer with warning that his conduct might be\nunconstitutional. Indeed, in Hope, the Supreme Court examined a state correctional regulation in\ndetermining whether the defendants had fair warning of the unconstitutionality of their conduct.\nSee Hope, 536 U.S. at 741. However, the relationship between the regulations and the\nconstitutional violation in that case was far less attenuated than it is in this case: if the defendants\nin Hope followed the regulation at issue, that would have transformed the very “wanton”\nconstitutional practice from a punitive to correctional measure. See id. at 744. Furthermore, the\nSupreme Court emphasized that the defendants “frequently” disregarded the regulation,\nevidencing a “course of conduct” tending to prove that “they were fully aware of the wrongful\ncharacter of their conduct.” Id. Meanwhile, the record in this case does not establish a\ncomparable course of conduct indicative of the state of mind required to support a “deliberate\nindifference” claim.\n\n                                                  23\n\fline officers charged with failings similar to those challenged in this action. See Burnley v.\n\nEvans, 249 F. App’x 492, 493-94 (8th Cir. 2007) (per curiam) (concluding that even if guard\n\nreleased inmates in violation of a policy requiring continuous supervision of inmates, the record\n\nat best showed “mere negligence”); Tucker v. Evans, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776149\"><a href=\"/opinion/776149/elaine-tucker-co-administrator-of-the-estate-of-william-edward-tucker/\"><span class=\"volume\">276</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">999</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1001-02 (8th Cir. 2002)\n\n(concluding that even if there was a substantial risk of harm to inmates, allegations that an officer\n\nin the control booth failed to properly supervise the unit and perform inspection duties “fail[ed]\n\nto rise to the level of a constitutional wrong” and at best demonstrated negligence); Jones v.

La. Mar. 20, 2008)\n\n(concluding that allegations that officers in the control room allowed a fellow inmate to gain\n\naccess and fatally stab another inmate were insufficient, even where officers acknowledged that it\n\nwould be “better” to have additional staff on the floor); Muhammad v. Sielaff, No. 91 Civ. 7275\n\n(LAP), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">459244</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 3, 1995) (concluding that plaintiff’s allegations\n\nthat correctional officers did not pay “close enough attention to their responsibilities to monitor\n\ninmates” or were not at their “proper post” did not rise “to the level of culpability required for\n\ndeliberate indifference,” but rather were consistent with negligence); but see Krein v. Norris, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779687\"><a href=\"/opinion/779687/ben-krein-v-larry-norris-director-of-the-arkansas-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">309</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">487</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 491-92 (8th Cir. 2002). This divergence of opinions further evidences that a\n\nreasonable officer in the Defendant Correctional Officers’ position could have believed that his\n\nconduct was within the bounds of an appropriate response.\n\n                                        V. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the reasons set forth above, the Court finds that the constitutional violation alleged in\n\nthis case was not “clearly established” at the time of Gaither’s death, rendering summary\n\njudgment based on qualified immunity appropriate. Accordingly, the Court shall GRANT the\n\n\n                                                 24\n\fDefendant Correctional Officers’ [232/233] Motion for Summary Judgment and DISMISS\n\nPlaintiff’s Section 1983 claims against the Defendant Correctional Officers in their personal\n\ncapacities.
